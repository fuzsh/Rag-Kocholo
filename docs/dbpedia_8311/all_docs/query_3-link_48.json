        "text": "Bands like Van Halen, The Alan Parsons Project, Phish, and Santana all are named after members in the band. But what about bands named after people not in the band? Here's a look at eight of them.\n\n1. Pink Floyd\n\nThereâs a record executive in the song âHave A Cigarâ that says, âOh, by the way, which oneâs Pink?â Thing is, of course, this was the band responding to (and mocking) the often-asked question. But in reality, the name of the band comes from band member Syd Barrett, who took the name of bluesman Pink Anderson and combined it with Floyd Council, another bluesman. So if youâre ever trying to come up with a good name for another successful rock band, you might consider Anderson Council.\n\n2. Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nNope, Mr. Skynyrd never played for the southern rockers. In fact, the band named themselves after their gym teacher and basketball coach, Mr. Leonard Skinner. After Skinner died, one of the surviving members of the rock band had this to say: âCoach Skinner had such a profound impact on our youth that ultimately led us to naming the band, which you know as Lynyrd Skynyrd, after him. Looking back, I cannot imagine it any other way.â\n\n3. Hootie and the Blowfish\n\nWhile some think that front man Darius Rucker was Hootie and his bandmates were the Blowfish, the truth is that Rucker was both Hootie and the Blowfish. As for the meaning: it came from two of Ruckerâs college friends, one who wore glasses that made him look like an owl (Hootie) and another with puffed up cheeks (the Blowfish).\n\n4. Tilly and the Wall\n\nNope, thereâs no Tilly here. The name comes from a kidsâ book, according to an interview with Jamie Pressnall, the bandâs resident tap dancer. âItâs actually the title of a childrenâs book. Itâs just about outsiders overcoming obstacles, that kind of story,â she said. âWe didnât even think about the story that much, but it ended up fitting our band really well.â\n\n5. Belle and Sebastian\n\nNo Belle. No Sebastian here. Just some band mates inspired by Belle & SÃ©bastien, a 1960s novel by CÃ©cile Aubry about a 6-year-old boy named SÃ©bastien and his dog Belle.\n\n6. Freddy Jones Band\n\nSorry to disappoint again, but not only is there no Freddy Jones or Jones Freddy in the band, but apparently the band has never definitively revealed the nameâs source.\n\n7. Aiden\n\nThis Seattle-based band doesnât have an Aiden. Instead, the band members named the group after a character in the 2002 film The Ring.\n\n8. Alice Cooper\n\nThey were first called the Earwigs, then Nazz, before settling on Alice Cooper. The name is said to have been inspired by their Ouija board, which put them in contact with a spirit named Alice Cooper. When lead singer, Vincent Furnier, went solo, he took the name for himself.\n\nRead more retro music stories:\n\nA version of this story ran in 2011; it has been updated for 2024."
