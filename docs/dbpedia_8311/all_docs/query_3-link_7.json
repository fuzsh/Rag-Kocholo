        "text": "This is a list of band names, with their name origins explained and referenced with reliable sources.\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\n2Cellos – The band consists of two members who both play the cello.\n\n3 Doors Down – The band started out with drummer/vocalist Brad Arnold, bassist Todd Harrell and guitarist Matt Roberts. As they decided to tour outside of their hometown of Escatawpa, Mississippi and into Foley, Alabama, they came up with their official name as they saw a building with a sign with most of its letters fallen off, reading \"Doors Down\". Since at the time they started out with 3 band members the name stuck and called themselves 3 Doors Down.[1]\n\n311 – 311 is an Omaha, Nebraska, police code for indecent exposure. One rainy day, 311 bassist P-Nut and some friends went skinny dipping in a public pool. They were apprehended by police. One of P-Nut's friends, Jim Watson, was arrested, cuffed (naked), and taken home to his parents. He was issued a citation for a code 311. The band found the incident amusing, so they based their name on it.[2]\n\n10cc – By his own account, Jonathan King chose the name for the band after signing them to his record label UK Records, after having a dream in which he was standing in front of the Hammersmith Odeon in London where the boarding read \"10cc The Best Band in the World\". A widely repeated claim, disputed by King, but confirmed in a 1988 interview by Lol Creme and also on the webpage of Graham Gouldman's current line-up, is that the band name represented a volume of semen that was more than the average amount ejaculated by men (\"cc\" being an abbreviation of cubic centimetre), thus emphasising their potency or prowess.[3]\n\n50 Cent – The artist adopted the nickname \"50 Cent\" as a metaphor for change, after having served time at boot camp for selling drugs to an undercover police officer.[4] The name was inspired by Kelvin Martin, a 1980s Brooklyn robber known as \"50 Cent\"; the artist chose it \"because it says everything I want it to say. I'm the same kind of person 50 Cent was. I provide for myself by any means.\"[5]\n\n100 gecs – The name came from a spray-painted phrase seen by the duo in Chicago.[6]\n\n1349 – Named after the year the Bubonic plague reached Norway.[7]\n\nThe 1975 – Lead singer Matthew Healy said in an interview that he came up with the name after discovering an old art journal from a beatnik, with one of the dates listed as \"June 1st, the 1975\". Healy said that he thought the placement of \"the\" in a recorded date was intriguing, and decided to use it as the name for the band.[8]\n\n1910 Fruitgum Company - The album liner notes explain Frank Jeckell found a bubblegum wrapper in a jacket found inside an attic which had the name on it. However, Frank has stated in interviews that this wasn't true, and that when the band (originally Jeckell and the Hydes) signed with Super K Productions, they were given the name. He later happened to find a slot machine that had the text inscribed under one of the jackpot reels \"Copyright 1910 Bell-Fruit-Gum Mills Novelty Co., Chicago\" and believes the 1910 Fruitgum Company name originated from it.[9]\n\nA\n\n[edit]\n\na-ha – A title that member Pål Waaktaar contemplated giving to a song. Morten Harket was looking through Waaktaar's notebook and came across the name \"a-ha\". He liked it and said, \"That's a great name. That's what we should call ourselves.\" After checking dictionaries in several languages, they found out that a-ha was an international way of expressing recognition, with positive connotations. It was short, easy to say, and unusual.[10]\n\nA-Teens – The 'A' stands for ABBA since they started as a cover band for the group; their name was originally ABBA-Teens but was changed upon the request from Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson to avoid confusion. The group later did other songs, such as \"Upside Down\".[11]\n\nABBA – a palindromic acronym from the initials of the first names of the band members: Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad.[12] A producer of canned fish was already using the name Abba so the band asked permission from them to use the name ABBA.[13]\n\nAC/DC – Malcolm and Angus Young developed the idea for the band's name after their sister seeing \"AC/DC\" on an electric sewing machine, \"why not AC/DC\".[14]\n\nAce of Base – The band's first studio was in the basement of a car repair shop, and they considered themselves to be the \"masters\" of the studio. \"Ace of Base\" was derived from \"masters of the basement\".[10]\n\nA Day to Remember – A former member's ex-girlfriend used the term and the name stuck.[15]\n\nAdiemus – Creator Karl Jenkins invented the word, unaware at the time that it means \"We will draw near\" in Latin.[16]\n\nAiden – After a character from the 2002 film The Ring.[17]\n\nAir Supply – Five years before the band's signing, Graham Russell saw the name in a dream.[10]\n\nThe Airborne Toxic Event – Named by leader Mikel Jollett after a section in Don DeLillo's novel White Noise in which a poisonous gas cloud results from a chemical spill from a train car. Jollett saw a similarity between the life-altering perspective shift in the novel's protagonist and the life-altering series of events that gave rise to the band, and the themes of mortality and media consumption resulting from the gas cloud in the novel are a source of inspiration for the band.\n\nAKB48 – After Tokyo's area Akihabara (colloquially shortened to Akiba), a mecca for electronics shopping and geeks. The group was formed as theater-based, to perform at its own theater at Akihabara on a daily basis, so that fans could always go and see them live. It still performs there every day, although, after the group's popularity went up, tickets started being distributed only via an online lottery.[18]\n\nAlexisonfire – from contortionist stripper Alexis Fire, which nearly resulted in a lawsuit from the stripper's representatives.[19]\n\nAlice Cooper – Alice Cooper was a band before frontman Vincent Furnier started a solo career under the same name. Allegedly, Alice Cooper was the name of a spirit members of the band came in contact with through a ouija,[10] though Furnier has also claimed that he wanted their name to contrast with their sound, and Alice Cooper sounds like somebody's grandmother.\n\nAlice in Chains – The name was taken from lead singer Layne Staley's previous group, the glam metal band Alice N' Chains.[20] Staley shed some light on the subject in a Rolling Stone article in 1992: \"The name came from a side project of my old group [Alice N' Chains]. We were going to have this band that dressed up in drag and played heavy metal as a joke.\"[21] Alice N' Chains' bassist Johnny Bacolas explained the name in the 2011 book Everybody Loves Our Town: A History of Grunge.[22] Bacolas and Russ Klatt (the lead singer of Slaughter Haus 5),[23] were at a party in North Seattle talking about backstage passes. One of the passes said \"Welcome to Wonderland\", and they started talking about that being an Alice in Wonderland-type thing, until Klatt started saying, \"What about Alice in Chains? Put her in bondage and stuff like that.\"[22] Bacolas thought the name \"Alice in Chains\" was cool and brought it up to his Sleze bandmates and everyone liked it, so they changed the name of the band. Since three of the members had very Christian mothers, they thought spelling it \"Alice N' Chains\" made it not sound a bondage name.[22] After Staley left Alice N' Chains, he contacted his former bandmates and asked for permission to use the name with his new band with guitarist Jerry Cantrell.[24]\n\nAlien Ant Farm – Bassist Terry Corso said the name was a day dream he had about how Earth is just an experiment for aliens from other planets.\n\nThe All-American Rejects – The \"All-Americans\" and \"the Rejects\", both suggested to the band as names, were merged.[25]\n\nAll Time Low – When in high school, members Alex Gaskarth, Jack Barakat, Rian Dawson, and Zack Merrick made a list of possible band names, one of which being \"All Time Low\". The name came from New Found Glory's song \"Head On Collision\".\n\nAlt-J–The spoken form of the band ∆, alt + j is the keyboard shortcut used to type ∆ on a Mac computer. ∆ is a mathematical symbol for change.[26]\n\nAlunaGeorge – From the first names of the members, Aluna Francis and George Reid.\n\nAmon Amarth – Named after \"Mount Doom\", in Tolkien's Elvish speech.[27]\n\nAnamanaguchi – The name came about from a member in one of Peter Berkman's former bands pronouncing gibberish in the style of Jabba the Hutt;[28] The band has also explained it as coming from the members' internships at Armani (Berkman and James DeVito), Prada (Ary Warnaar), and Gucci (Luke Silas) while studying fashion at Parsons School of Design.[29]\n\nAnberlin – Band member Stephen Christian has offered the explanations that he planned naming his first daughter Anberlin[30] and that the name was a modification of the phrase \"and Berlin\" from a list of cities Christian wanted to visit.[31] The one story that Christian asserts is true, however, is that he heard the word in the background noise of the Radiohead song \"Everything in Its Right Place\".[32]\n\n...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead – Initially claimed to be a line in a Mayan ritual chant,[33] though lead singer Conrad Keely has since admitted the story was a joke.[34]\n\nAnimals as Leaders – Inspired by the 1992 novel Ishmael by Daniel Quinn, guitarist Tosin Abasi coined the name as a reminder that \"we're all essentially animals\". Abasi went into further depth by saying, \"The name is kind of like, a lot of what we do is completely removed from the fact that we're all essentially animals. We have a niche on the planet and we have a role in sustainable sort of ecology. But we've gone against our natural calling. The name is acknowledging that we do have more of a natural role on the planet. It's also like, who would follow an animal to do anything? I think of the name as being both nonsensical and really literal.\"[35]\n\nApollo 440 – From the Greek god Apollo and the frequency of concert pitch–the A note at 440 Hz, often denoted as \"A440\", and the Sequential Circuits sampler/sequencer, the Studio 440.\n\nApulanta – Means \"fertiliser\" in Finnish. Invented as a joke when the band had to come up with a \"punk\" sounding name.\n\nArcade Fire – Based on a story that singer Win Butler heard as a kid. He was told that an arcade in Exeter had burnt down, killing many youths.[36]\n\nArt of Noise – After the 1913 manifesto called The Art of Noises by Italian Futurist Luigi Russolo.[37]\n\nDie Ärzte – Decided when the band noticed that the folder with the umlaut \"Ä\" was empty in most record stores. The band often stylises their name, which is grammatically correct German, with three dots in the umlaut in the letter \"Ä\", as a parody of the heavy metal umlaut. No language using the Latin alphabet has a three-dot diacritic.\n\nAs I Lay Dying – After the 1930 novel As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner.[38]\n\nAsh – The band chose the first short word they liked in the dictionary, as stated in the CD booklet of Intergalactic Sonic 7\"s.\n\nAsking Alexandria – According to band member Danny Worsnop, the name was taken from Alexander the Great.\n\nAtreyu – After a character in 1979 novel The NeverEnding Story and the 1984 movie of the same name.[39]\n\nAudioslave – According to lead guitarist Tom Morello, the name supposedly came to singer Chris Cornell in a vision.[40]\n\nAuto-Icon – Derived from the term Auto-Iconization first attributed to Jeremy Bentham, Utility and Democracy: The Political Thought of Jeremy Bentham. Auto-Icon Started as a one-man project in Los Angeles in 1999 with the end of the century and Y2K looming, it seemed to founding member J. Hébert any one could call themselves an \"Icon\".\n\nAutomatic Pilot – From psychiatric testimony characterizing Dan White's state of mind while killing George Moscone and Harvey Milk.[41]\n\nThe Avalanches – Taken from the 1960s surf rock band of the same name.\n\nAvenged Sevenfold – Taken from the Book of Genesis, from the passage \"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.\"\n\nAvicii – Stage name of Tim Bergling; he explained that the name Avicii means \"the lowest level of Buddhist hell\" (Avīci) and he chose the moniker because his real name was already used upon creating his Myspace page.[42][43]\n\nA Wilhelm Scream – The Wilhelm scream is a frequently-used film and television stock sound effect first used in 1951 for the film Distant Drums.[44] The band were previously named 'Koen' and then 'Smackin Isaiah' before finally settling on the current appellation.\n\nAwolnation – The name is derived from leader Aaron Bruno's high school nickname. In an interview with Kristin Houser of the LA Music Blog, he stated that he \"would leave without saying goodbye\" because it was just easier, so that's where the name AWOL (slang from the military acronym for Absent Without Leave) came from.\"[45]\n\nB\n\n[edit]\n\nThe B-52's – From the name of a beehive hairstyle, itself named for the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress.\n\nBabymetal – According to Kobametal (the band's producer), the name came to him by revelation (as a \"divine message\"). It is a play on the words \"heavy metal\".[46]\n\nBachman–Turner Overdrive – A combination of band members' last names and the magazine Overdrive. The band's name had previously been \"Bachman-Turner\". All band members agreed that Bachman-Turner Overdrive sounded cooler.[citation needed]\n\nBackstreet Boys – After a flea market in Orlando, Florida.[47]\n\nBad Religion – Bad Religion's Greg Graffin on their name:\n\nYou have to remember that we were fifteen-year-old punks–we wanted to piss people off. Anything that might make parents, teachers, and people with authority bristle was up for discussion. We also wanted a name that would suggest a great logo for stickers and T-shirts. Many of the names were compelling but too repulsive. Smegma, Vaginal Discharge, and Head Cheese might make for great logos but were quickly rejected as not representative of our songs. We played around with a lot of names involving the word \"bad\"–Bad Family Planning, Bad Politics. When we hot [sic] on Bad Religion, it seemed perfect. That year, 1980, was a time of rising prominence for televangelists like Jimmy Swaggart, Pat Robertson, and Jim Bakker. The year before, Jerry Falwell had founded the Moral Majority, which was having a powerful influence on the presidential election between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Religion was a hot topic, and those TV preachers seemed like a good target to us, though we didn't think they could possibly last for more than a few years. We knew that most people were so defensive about their religious ideas that they would be highly offended by our name–a major plus! And then Brett came up with a logo that represented our philosophical stance. We felt complete.[48]\n\nBadding – After the children's literary character Paddington Bear.\n\nBadfinger – Originally called \"The Iveys\" after a street in Swansea, Wales. Once the band was signed to Apple Records by The Beatles the band took the opportunity to change their name. The name \"Badfinger\" was derived from \"Bad Finger Boogie\", the working title of The Beatles' \"With a Little Help from My Friends\".[49]\n\nThe Band – They were originally known as The Hawks, after their original lead singer Ronnie Hawkins. While working with Bob Dylan in the 1960s, they decided to change their name, but were unable to agree on a new name. They finally decided to simply call themselves \"The Band\" after being derisively referred to as \"the band\" by critics of Dylan's new electric direction on the 1966 tour.[50]\n\nBananarama – Partially named after the Roxy Music song Pyjamarama.\n\nBarenaked Ladies – Two members–Steven Page and Ed Robertson–were bored at a Bob Dylan concert and turned to amusing each other, pretending they were rock critics, inventing histories and comments about the Dylan band. They also made up various fictional band names, one of which was \"Barenaked Ladies\".[51][52] On another front, Robertson had agreed to perform with his cover band in a battle of the bands at Nathan Phillips Square for the Second Harvest food bank. The band broke up and he forgot about the gig. When he received a phone call a week before the show, asking him to confirm the gig, he improvised that the name of the band had changed to \"Barenaked Ladies\", recalling the name from the Dylan concert. He then called Page and asked if he wanted to do the gig; Page reportedly could not believe Robertson had given that name.[51][52][53] The two played the show on October 1, 1988,[54] They arranged three rehearsals and missed them all. The two played the show on October 1, 1988, but instead of competing, they played while the other bands set up, playing every song they could think of that they both knew. The show went well and the pair continued performing and started writing songs together.[51][52][55]\n\nBastille – Lead singer Dan Smith was born on July 14, Bastille Day.\n\nBat & Ryyd – Originally named Batman & Ryydman, but shortened to \"Bat & Ryyd\" after a complaint from composer Kari Rydman.[56]\n\nBauhaus – Originally named \"Bauhaus 1919\" after the German Bauhaus art movement, and shortened to \"Bauhaus\" in 1979.\n\nBeastie Boys – Has the backronym \"Boys Entering Anarchistic States Towards Inner Excellence\"[57]\n\nThe Beatles – The Crickets were cited as an inspiration for the name. Additionally, the misspelling of \"beetles\" was a play on words, describing the \"beat\" of the band.[58]\n\nThe Beautiful South – The Beautiful South were an English alternative rock group formed at the end of the 1980s by two former members of Hull group The Housemartins, Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway. Heaton explained at the time that the name was partly a sarcastic reflection of his own dislike of southern England, and partly an attempt to force macho men to utter the word 'beautiful'.[59]\n\nBee Gees – From \"B.G.\", the initials of all three of band member Barry Gibb, radio DJ Bill Gates and speedway promoter and driver Bill Goode. The similarity to \"Brothers Gibb\" is just a coincidence.[60][61][62]\n\nBelle & Sebastian – From Belle et Sébastien, a children's book by French writer Cécile Aubry.[63]\n\nBetween the Buried and Me – The band name was derived from a phrase in Counting Crows' song \"Ghost Train\"\n\nBiffy Clyro – There are many rumours of the origin of Biffy Clyro's name. These are that, one time, lead singer Simon Neil bought a Cliff Richard pen, which was therefore a \"Cliffy biro\". They then changed this to Biffy Clyro. Another theory is that 'Biffy Clyro' were a Welsh tribe. The third rumour is that Biffy Clyro was a former player of the band's football team, Ayr United. They have never confirmed any of these.\n\nBig Drill Car – The band members have claimed in interviews that their name was inspired by the movie Journey to the Center of the Earth.[64]\n\nBilly Talent – After a character in the film Hard Core Logo (although the name in the film and the book by Michael Turner it was adapted from is spelled \"Billy Tallent\").[65]\n\nThe Birthday Massacre – The name of the band's early song. According to their vocalist Chibi: \"It kind of works well for the music that we're making. Sort of contrasty, you know? Birthday, and massacre. Light, and dark. Cute, and evil.\"[66] The band was originally known as Imagica, but adopted the current name to avoid confusion with another group. The song \"The Birthday Massacre\" was then renamed to \"Happy Birthday\".\n\nThe Black Crowes – The group originally called themselves Mr. Crowe's Garden, after a favorite children's book. They performed under that name until they signed with Def American Records in 1989. They renamed themselves in response to the suggestion of a producer.[67][68]\n\nBlack Flag – Suggested by guitarist Greg Ginn's brother, Raymond Pettibone, because \"if a white flag means surrender, a black flag means anarchy.\"[69]\n\nThe Black Keys – When the duo grew up in Akron, Ohio, a schizophrenic man residing in a halfway house used to call their homes to ask for crayons, Diet Coke and cigarettes. His messages would always end with him saying \"...don't be a black key. Don't be a b-flat.\"[70]\n\nBlack Rebel Motorcycle Club – The film The Wild One featured two motorcycle gangs, the Beetles and Black Rebels Motorcycle Club. In a reference to the story that The Beatles took their name from one motorcycle gang, Peter Hayes (guitarist) and Robert Levon Been (bassist) originally named their band \"The Other Gang\", but switched to Black Rebel Motorcycle Club when The Other Gang did not catch on.[71][72]\n\nBlack Sabbath – Originally known as Earth, the group wanted to change their name as another group had the same name.[73] The group saw a local cinema playing a film titled Black Sabbath and marvelled that people paid money to be frightened.[73]\n\nBlind Melon – Bass player Brad Smith's father used this term to refer to some hippies who lived in a commune near his house.[74]\n\nBlink-182 – The \"Blink\" was thought up by Tom DeLonge when the band consisted of DeLonge, Mark Hoppus, and their friend Scott Raynor. (They previously called themselves Duck Tape.) An Irish electronica artist was already using the name Blink, so they added a random number to the end.\n\nBlondie – A nickname given to frontwoman Debbie Harry by truck drivers who catcalled \"Hey, Blondie\" to Harry as they drove by.[75]\n\nBlue October – The front man of Blue October, Justin Furstenfeld, spent a brief stint in a mental hospital in October 1997. Furstenfeld stated that afterwards he wrote songs to keep depression away which led to the forming of the band.[76]\n\nBoards of Canada – Named in tribute to the National Film Board of Canada. The brothers spent part of their youth growing up in Canada, and credit the Film Board's documentaries as a source of inspiration for their sound.[77]\n\nbob hund – From a cartoon dog named Bob that the band once saw on TV.\n\nThe Boomtown Rats – As revealed in his autobiography, Bound for Glory, this was the name of Woody Guthrie's boyhood gang, named after his hometown, Oklahoma City, known as 'Boomtown' during the oil boom.\n\nBon Iver – Suggested by an episode of Northern Exposure in which, after the first snow of winter, people greet each other with bon hiver (pronounced [bɔn‿ivɛʁ], French for \"good winter\").[78][79] This was initially transcribed by Vernon as \"boniverre\". When he learned of its proper French spelling, he elected not to use it, deciding \"hiver\" reminded him too much of liver; he had been bedridden with a liver ailment when he watched the show.[80]\n\nBon Jovi – An alternative spelling of Jon Bon Jovi's last name Bongiovi, following the example of the other famous two-word bands such as Van Halen, as suggested by Pamela Maher.\n\nBonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band – A combination of Bonzo the dog and the Dada art movement.\n\nBoston - After the city of Boston, Massachusetts, where the band was formed.

The microphone's owner appeared on stage to say \"I'd like to thank Benjamin for breaking my f*cking microphone.\"[82]\n\nBring Me the Horizon – From a line said by Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, \"Now ... bring me that horizon\".[83]\n\nBurzum – Means \"darkness\" in Tolkien's Black Speech.[27]\n\nBush – The band chose the name in reference to a district of West London named Shepherd's Bush where the founding members once lived.[84]\n\nButthole Surfers – The band, who previously changed their name at every gig, was performing an earlier version of 1984's \"Butthole Surfer\" when the announcer forgot the band's name and used the title of the song instead. They were forced to keep this name after the performance hit fame.[85]\n\nBuzzcocks – The band took their name from a Time Out review of the 1976 T.V. show Rock Follies with the headline \"It's the Buzz, Cock!\" (Cock was slang for \"mate\".) The band members liked the subversiveness of it.[86]\n\nC\n\n[edit]\n\nCage The Elephant – After one of their shows, a mentally ill man approached frontman Matt Shultz, hugged him and said \"you have to cage the elephant\".\n\nCake – Rather than referring to the foodstuff, the name is meant to be \"like when something insidiously becomes a part of your life...[we] mean it more as something that cakes onto your shoe and is just sort of there until you get rid of it\".[87]\n\nCansei de Ser Sexy – Portuguese for \"tired of being sexy\", an alleged quote of Beyoncé Knowles, one of the largest musical influences upon this Brazilian band.[88]\n\nCarach Angren – From Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, named after a pass in Mordor.

You know I enjoyed smoking weed and you know it was just like such a 'yeah the domain's open'. I don't have to have any like underscores.\"[91]\n\nCharli XCX – When playing at illegal warehouse parties, she needed a stage name and chose Charli XCX, which was her MSN Messenger screen name. The \"XCX\" stands for \"kiss Charli kiss\".[92]\n\nCheap Trick – Inspired by the band's attendance of a Slade concert, where bassist Tom Petersson commented that the band used \"every cheap trick in the book\" as part of their act.[93]\n\nChildish Gambino – Donald Glover used a Wu-Tang Clan name generator in his sophomore year of college at NYU, inputting his real name and coming up with Childish Gambino.[94]\n\nChildren of Bodom – After being told by Spinefarm Records that the band's name had to change (the group having previously been signed to another label under the name Inearthed), the group looked through a local phone book to search for inspiration, coming across Lake Bodom. The band, like most of Finland, was already aware of the unsolved murder of three teenagers camping at the lake. The band believed they had found an impacting name with an interesting story behind it, and so chose the name Children of Bodom.

It later came to light that Marshall Tucker, a blind piano tuner, had rented the space before the band, and his name was inscribed on the key. In his book, Top Pop Singles, 1955–2002, music historian Joel Whitburn attributes \"Marshall Tucker\" to the owner of the band's rehearsal hall.\n\nMatchbox Twenty – Originally titled \"Matchbox 20\", the band took its name from a softball jersey with a \"20\" on it and a patch that had \"Matchbox\" written on it.

He dropped the A when he learned that \"The Megadeaths\" was a former name of Pink Floyd.[214]\n\nMercedes Bentso – A portmanteau of Mercedes-Benz and benzodiazepine.[215]\n\nMetric – Initially, their name was Mainstream.

J. and the Bear. \"A friend of the band had gone on a date\", explained the singer-guitarist Jake Snider, \"and one of us asked him afterwards how the date went. Our friend said, 'You know that TV show from the '70s, B.J. and the Bear? It was like that... minus the Bear.'

They did it in reverse. \"Key\" at the end of \"monkey\" suggests a Key (be it Ab, Am, C# or whatever). So they altered \"-key\" and got \"-kee\" and they had the name.\n\nThe Moody Blues – The band were originally named The M&B 5 after the Birmingham brewery Mitchells & Butlers. This was changed and the new name was inspired by a Duke Ellington song named \"Mood Indigo\".\n\nMoottörin Jyrinä – Moottorin jyrinä means \"the rumble of an engine\" in Finnish.

Vocalist Ben Lovett indicated that the name was meant to invoke the sense of an \"antiquated family business name\".\n\nMuse – Front-man Matthew Bellamy stated that the band's name was mainly chosen because it looked professional on posters and the like. However, Bellamy has also stated that the name could possibly have stemmed from being raised in a family interested in Ouija and spirits. The bandmates first heard the word when someone in their hometown of Teignmouth, England, suggested that the reason for a lot of the town's populace becoming members of bands was a muse hovering over the town.\n\nMy Bloody Valentine – Kevin Shields and Colm Ó Cíosóig formed My Bloody Valentine in early 1983 with lead vocalist David Conway. Conway, who performed under the pseudonym Dave Stelfox, suggested a number of potential band names, including the Burning Peacocks, before the trio settled on My Bloody Valentine.[225] Shields has since claimed he was unaware that My Bloody Valentine was the title of a 1981 Canadian slasher film when the name was suggested.[226]\n\nMy Chemical Romance – Bassist Mikey Way, before joining the band, had a job at Barnes & Noble.

Salinger book of short stories of that name; Loeb, an English major, wanted a literary moniker.[229]\n\nNirvana – Before settling on a permanent name, the band had played under many different names including 'Throat Oyster' and 'Ted, Ed, Fred'. In Buddhism, nirvana means release from the cycle of rebirth and suffering.

After Spence's death, the name stuck.[230]\n\nNOFX – guitarist Eric Melvin says that he came up with the name, inspired by the broken up punk band \"Negative FX\".

Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs auditioned acquaintance Liam Gallagher as a replacement. After Gallagher joined the group, the band's name was changed to Oasis, which was inspired by a place where Inspiral Carpets played, the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon.[235]\n\nOdesza – the band's name was taken from the name of Harrison Mills' uncle's sunken vessel, which itself was named after the Ukrainian city of Odesa. Only his uncle and one other crew mate survived.[236] Since the spelling \"Odessa\" was already being used by a Scottish synth band, they instead chose to use a form of the Hungarian spelling, replacing the \"ss\" with \"sz\".[237] The correct spelling in Hungarian is Odessza.\n\nThe Offspring – after a B-movie called The Offspring: They Were Born to Kill. Until 1986 the band was named Manic Subsidal.[238][239]\n\nOf Mice & Men – After the novel by John Steinbeck.

However, the name stuck and they continued to use it.[citation needed]\n\nOne Ok Rock – Comes from \"one o'clock\", the time that the band used to practice on weekends, but due to the Japanese language making no distinction between R's and L's, they changed \"O'CLOCK\" to \"O'CROCK\" (or \"O'KROCK\"), which was then separated to become \"OK ROCK\".[240]\n\nOpeth – Derived from the word \"Opet\", taken from the Wilbur Smith novel Sunbird. In this novel, Opet is the name of a (fictional) Phoenician city in South Africa whose name is translated as \"City of the Moon\" in the book.[241]\n\nP\n\n[edit]\n\nPanic! at the Disco – Lifted from the lyrics of a song called \"Panic\", by Name Taken: \"Panic at the disco/Sat back and took it so slow.\"[242]\n\nPantera – Named after guitarist Dimebag Darrell's car, a De Tomaso Pantera.\n\nParamore – According to lead singer Hayley Williams, the name \"Paramore\" came from the maiden name of the mother of one of their first bass players.[243] Once the group learned the meaning of the homophone paramour (\"secret lover\"), they decided to adopt the name, using the Paramore spelling.[244]\n\nParis Match – From the title of a song by The Style Council.[245]\n\nPassion Pit – The band culled their name from the Variety Slanguage Dictionary, a glossary of Variety's frequently used slang, which was provided by the Hollywood insider publication to help not-so-savvy readers decipher its content. The magazine used the term to refer to drive-in theatres, because of their privacy and romantic allure for teenagers.[246]\n\nPearl Jam – The band's first name was \"Mookie Blaylock\" after the All-Star basketball player, but the name was changed to \"Pearl Jam\" due to trademark concerns.

In an interview with David Paton, he said that the idea came from the producer's girlfriend. While Ian Bairnson was involved with the band's first album, he was not an official member of the band until their second album, Second Flight.[253]\n\nPink Floyd – Playing under multiple names, including \"Tea Set\", when the band found themselves on the same bill as another band with the same name, Syd Barrett came up with the alternative name The Pink Floyd Sound, after two blues musicians, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council.[254][255] For a time after this they oscillated between The Tea Set and The Pink Floyd Sound, with the latter name eventually winning out. The Sound was dropped fairly quickly, but the definite article was still used regularly until 1970. The group's UK releases during the Syd Barrett era credited them as The Pink Floyd as did their first two U.S. singles. The albums More and Ummagumma (both 1969) credit the band as Pink Floyd, produced by The Pink Floyd, while Atom Heart Mother (1970) credits the band as The Pink Floyd, produced by Pink Floyd. David Gilmour is known to have referred to the group as The Pink Floyd as late as 1984.[256]\n\nPixies – Selected randomly from a dictionary by guitarist Joey Santiago.

Shortened to The Pogues after complaints received by the BBC.[260]\n\nPoliça – According to singer Channy Leaneagh, Poliça is Polish for \"policy\", and she sees it as a reference to an unwritten code that guides the members when they play together, as well as its work ethic.[261] (Contrary to this explanation, the Polish word for \"policy\" is actually polityka.) In another interview, Leaneagh claimed that they wanted something unique, and she had a file on her computer which, following a corruption during a computer crash, had come back as \"Poliça\".[262]\n\nPopeda – an intentional misspelling of the name of the iconic Soviet car GAZ-M20 Pobeda.[263]\n\nPorno for Pyros – Inspired by the 1992 Los Angeles riots.[264]\n\nPortishead – After the English town of Portishead, Somerset, the hometown of one of the band's founding members, Geoff Barrow.[265]\n\nThe Postal Service – Chosen because of the band's production method: producer Jimmy Tamborello would mail raw versions to vocalist Ben Gibbard, who would edit them and mail them back through the United States Postal Service.[266]\n\nPress Play On Tape – From the message displayed by the Commodore 64 home computer when starting to load a program from the cassette tape drive.

Singer Freddie Mercury came up with the new name for the band, later saying: \"Years ago I thought up the name 'Queen' ... It's just a name, but it's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid ... It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations. I was certainly aware of gay connotations, but that was just one face of it.\"[271]\n\nQueens of the Stone Age – A name given by Chris Goss, who said the name implied they were \"heavy enough for the boys and sweet enough for the girls\", while 'Kings of the Stone Age' was described to be \"too macho\" and lopsided.\n\nQueensrÿche – Were originally called \"The Mob\".

So the band decided to use the last name Ramone even though it's not their surname.[278]\n\nR.E.M. – Vocalist Michael Stipe drew the initialism randomly out of the dictionary. The term refers to the rapid eye movement phase of sleep. Stipe says that is not the reason why the band is named R.E.M.[279]\n\nReel Big Fish – The band chose this name in favor of \"The Fisher King\", a reference to the film of the same name, as well as \"Dull Boy Jack\", a reference to The Shining. The final name was chosen almost arbitrarily, under the notion that it could be changed later. Bassist Matt Wong suggested \"Real Big Fish\", and Aaron Barrett suggested changing the \"A\" to a second \"E\". However, the name stuck, much to the chagrin of the band.\n\nRelient K – Named after the car that guitarist Matt Hoopes drove in high school, a Plymouth Reliant K car.

The name is also a nod to the band's anti-conventional rock image; in a 1986 interview, band founder Tony James remembered reading that, after seeing Sputnik pass over the earth, Little Richard gave up rock and roll. James \"took that as a good omen\" for the band's name choice.[292]\n\nSigur Rós – After the little sister of the band's vocalist, Jón Þór Birgisson (Jónsi), whose name is Sigurrós (without a space).

Their friend Jason Larsen was called \"slow one\" by his French-speaking boss, which with the French accent sounded more like \"Sloan\". The original agreement was that they could name the band after their friend's nickname as long as he was on the cover of their first album. As a result, it is Larsen who appears on the cover of Sloan's Peppermint EP.[299]\n\nSmashing Pumpkins – Frontman Billy Corgan had come up with this name as a joke years before the band had ever formed.
