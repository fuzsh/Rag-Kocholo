        "text": "How's it going fellow die hard hard core ZEPPELIN fanatics? I hope the week has been treating all of you well. My overtime hours at work are about to overwhelm me so please forgive me if I cannot answer all of your posts/responses in a timely manner. My next thread is on a legendary all-female band that needs no introduction the world over. If my brain is correct, THE RUNAWAYS (Solo artists Joan Jett and Lita Ford included) are the ONLY all-female band to be included in the VH-1 Top 100 All-time Greatest Hard Rock Songs Ever. It would be inappropriate for me to mention all of the legendary female performers in Rock's glorious past without mentioning THE RUNAWAYS. So without further delay, AND AWAY WE GO!\n\nTHE RUNAWAYS will forever go down in Rock n' Roll history and be remembered for becoming the first true ALL-FEMALE Hard Rock band. Get a load of this line-up: Joan Jett (Born Joan Larkin) on Guitar, Lita Ford on Guitar, Cherie Currie on Lead Vocals, Jackie Fox (Born Jacqueline Fuchs) on Bass and the late Sandy West (Born Sandy Pesavento) on the Drums. Cherie Currie would actually beat out MADONNA in being the first female frontwoman to wear Lingerie as her regular wardrobe on a regular basis. Lita Ford would openly admit that numerous guys in many of their audiences, would throw condoms on stage. Vicki Blue A.K.A. Victory Tischler-Blue would later replace the departed Jackie Fox on Bass in the late 1970's in order to keep THE RUNAWAYS' sound fully intact. However, Blue's seizures would become one of the contributing factors that would lay THE RUNAWAYS to rest permanently. How unfair! THE RUNAWAYS' musical influences were the mighty LED ZEPPELIN, BLACK SABBATH, THE BEATLES, THE ROLLING STONES, AEROSMITH, DAVID BOWIE, KISS, PINK FLOYD, THE WHO, THE KINKS and DEEP PURPLE. Put all of these influences together and you have some of the most Hard-driven, Guitar-driven Hard Rock n Roll ever recorded by an all-female band.\n\nThe Genesis of the most popular line-up of THE RUNAWAYS can be traced all the way back to Los Angeles in 1975. There were other vocalists and guitarists that were in THE RUNAWAYS but were soon replaced by the legendary line-up that we are all accustomed to. When the line-up of Jett, Ford, Currie, Fox and West joined forces, there was no looking back and this all-female Hard Rock band had one mission in life, \"TO BLOW EVERYONE AWAY!\" In reality, they did just that. And just think, while still in their teens, THE RUNAWAYS were the first all-female Rock Band that actually wrote their own songs and played their own instruments. It wasn't until THE RUNAWAYS met manager/hustler Kim Fowley that the band started to show signs of life and gain worldwide popularity.\n\nWhen you think of THE RUNAWAYS, you think of their ass kickin' Hard Rockin' songs such as \"Cherry Bomb,\" \"Blackmail,\" \"Secrets,\" \"I Love Playin' With Fire,\" \"Born To Be Bad,\" \"Take It Or Leave It,\" \"Queens Of Noise,\" \"You Drive Me Wild,\" \"Neon Angels On the Road To Ruin,\" \"Wasted,\" \"Wait For Me\" and \"Waitin' For The Night\" to name a few. Believe me when I tell you that these songs do kick ass while Rockin'.\n\nIt is just too bad that THE RUNAWAYS officially disbanded in 1979. While still in their prime, THE RUNAWAYS was a great band that still had so much to give. This band was for real and still had so much to accomplish in Rock n' Roll. However, THE RUNAWAYS legend did not end in 1979. Female Rockers Joan Jett and Lita Ford would successfully move on in lighting up the Rock n' roll world by entertaining their audiences with their spectacular solo careers. Cherie Currie would successfully wind up recording a solo album with her sister Marie and take up a career in acting. Believe it or not, Bass player Jackie Fox would end up going to Harvard Law School and wind up becoming a very successful entertainment Lawyer. WOW! The late Sandy West would wind up becoming a Bounty Hunter and a Collector for Loan Sharks. WOW! When Sandy West died of Cancer on that fateful day of 21 October 2006, Rock n' Roll lost one of its premiere pioneer female drummers ever besides Karen Carpenter. Vicki Blue would eventually pursue a career behind the camera in film and TV. However, Blue would film a DVD Documentary entitled Edgeplay, The Story of THE RUNAWAYS! This film was made with the full cooperation of the band with the exception of Joan Jett! Word now has it that Joan Jett is filming a movie about THE RUNAWAYS with all of the band members' full participation and cooperation. THE RUNAWAYS, without a doubt, has forever left their mark in Rock n' Roll history and their legacy of music will never be forgotten as long as music still exists. And as the saying goes, \"AND THE REST IS ROCK N' ROLL HISTORY,\" am I wrong? R.I.P. Sandy Pesavento A.K.A. Sandy West, Born 10 July 1959, Died 21 October 2006 at age 47. LONG LIVE ROCK N' ROLL! ROCK ON!"
