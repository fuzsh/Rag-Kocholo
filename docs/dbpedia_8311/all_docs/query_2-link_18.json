The trio are later joined by vocalist Cherie Curry - subject of their song \"Cherry Bomb\" - and lead guitarist Lita Ford. Steele is fired and replaced by Jackie Fox. In 1976 the band signs to Mercury Records, release their self-titled debut album and embark on a worldwide tour that sees them at the heart of the punk scene alongside acts like the Ramones, Generation X and The Sex Pistols. By the Fall of 1977, tensions have reached a breaking point between the egos of Ford and Currie, and the singer acrimoniously leaves to forge a solo career with her twin sister Marie - Jett takes over vocal duties. Currie's solo career is short-lived, as she falls prey to the demons of drug addiction that have haunted much of her adult life. Fowley finds himself sacked shortly afterwards, to be replaced by Toby Mamis, whose resum√© includes work with Suzi Quatro and Blondie. By 1979 the band have burned out and the members go their separate ways. Joan Jett and Lita Ford forge successful solo careers, and Jackie Fox returns to education, eventually becoming an entertainment lawyer. Sandy West's career does not take off, and she is forced to take a series of jobs outside the music business, including working in construction, before succumbing to lung cancer in 2006 at the age of 47. Fowley retains the rights to The Runaways' name and in 1984, in the shadow of significant success by the band's former members, he attempts another - unsuccessful - iteration of the band based around teenage New Zealand singer Gayle Welch.\n\nCategories\n\nGirl Power\n\nMilestones"
