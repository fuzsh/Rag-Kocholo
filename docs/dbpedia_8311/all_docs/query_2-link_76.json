It does not include any travel costs.\n\nPlease note that many acts charge higher rates for events taking place on Fridays and Saturdays in summer.\n\nOccasionally, a rate lower than the listed price may be obtainable on selected dates. This will be advertised in the act's \"about\" section.\n\nNow taking their finely-honed sound to weddings and parties across the UK, The Runaways perform a mixture of funk/soul and rock classics as well as their more modern, pop repertoire.\n\nWith influences stretching across Stevie Wonder and Prince to Bruno Mars, Pharrell and Coldplay, you know that your party will have something for everyone!\n\nThe band's charismatic lead singer has already caught the attention of major labels. His high-energy, star-turn performances are a masterclass on keeping an audience engaged and motivated to the end. He won't rest until every last audience member is dancing and singing along!\n\nThe band are made up of multi-instrumentalists, songwriters and producers. Though still young, they've already blown away audiences at music festivals and private parties across the UK.\n\nFronted by their talented singer-producer-songwriter, the members of The Runaways have performed regularly at wedding and function venues across the UK as well as with original artists that have featured on BBC Introducing.\n\nNow playing together for six years, the band have bucketloads of on-stage chemistry, talent and charisma which will draw you in and leave you shouting for encores!\n\nDue to demand, please expect quotes which may be significantly higher than the advertised \"from\" price for weekends between May-October.\n\n“The Runaways were incredible! They played for our wedding, and were the perfect addition to the evening. They had a brilliant selection of music, perfect for the crowd and the style of wedding. They were so much fun, 10 out of 10, we would definitely recommend. Thank you The Runaways!”\n\nEmma, Wedding, The Great House at Sonning, Reading, July 2024\n\n“We used Function Central to book our wedding band - The Runaways. The whole process was really easy and it was nice to be able to listen and watch some of the previous events the band had done. The frontman of the band, was great - he made the process easy and it was wonderful that they learnt our first dance song as well. They performed it so beautifully! The band were absolutely incredible and all the guests said after how brilliant they were. Their singer has an incredible voice and the whole band was just immaculate - really wonderful at bringing the crowd together. Would absolutely recommend them for your wedding or any other event!”\n\nEmma, Wedding, Woking, June 2024\n\n“We booked The Runaways for our wedding last month with complete ease from Function Central, and we were completely blown away by how incredible the whole evening was! Function Central put us in touch with the band directly earlier than suggested to give us peace of mind with planning and were so quick to reply. We can’t thank The Runaways enough for making our wedding reception exactly what we hoped, everyone was on the dance floor all night and have been raving about how amazing they were ever since! Special thanks to Luca for adding in his saxophone unexpectedly, as we absolutely love a sax!”\n\nGrace, Wedding, Guildford, June 2024"
