He thinks only of the place he was happiest—the island where he used to live. He wants to go back, but they won’t let him out of the hospital.\n\nSo Gottfried Junior, his namesake, helps Grandpa make a plan to run away. They think of everything. Their deception is so complete that when Gottfried Junior finally decides to tell the truth, no one believes him."
