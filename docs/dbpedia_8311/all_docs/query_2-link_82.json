        "text": "The Runaways almost always get a mention when it comes to influence, especially when it comes to women in the rock world and rightfully so.\n\nServing as a launchpad for Joan Jett and Lita Ford, The Runaways released four studio albums and the killer Live In Japan live album from 1976-1978. However, everyone’s go-to song for the band is “Cherry Bomb” from their self-titled debut album, which was released on June 1, 1976.\n\nIt’s understandable why: “Cherry Bomb” is a great meat and potatoes rock song. The problem with this, though, is The Runaways are so much more than just one song. If you’re looking for more examples, here are ten other songs by The Runaways everyone should know."
