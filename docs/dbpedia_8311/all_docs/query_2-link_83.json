The band featured an all female line-up, and boasted such (soon to become) household names as Joan Jett, Lita Ford, and Cherie Curie among their ranks. The bands four albums - 'The Runaways' (1976), 'Queens Of Noise' (1976), 'Waitin' For The Night' (1977), 'And Now... The Runaways' (1978) - all appear in their entirety on 'Neon Angels On The Road To Ruin 1976-1978' five CD boxed set released in 2023 by Cherry Red Records. The fifth album in the set, is the bands live album 'Live In Japan' (1977), recorded at the Tokyo Koseinenkin Kaikan in June 1977. Formed in 1975 by the rock impresario Kim Fowley, The Runaways became the first all female rock band to catch the eye of a record buying public. The bands self titled debut album released in 1976 featured the hit single 'Cherry Bomb' - reaching number six on the American Billboard Hot 100 charts! Respected in their day by bands such as Blondie and The Ramones, the band have been cited as a major influence by the likes of Courtney Love, Bikini Kill, L7, The Donnas, Babes In Toyland, and many, many more! The Runways place in rock history is very secure, their name forever etched in a time of evolution and expansion for rock music. So whether you're an avid fan who just wants to own everything The Runaways, a newcomer to the \"all female\" band line-up who wants to know how it all began, or someone who knows the name but not the music - 'Neon Angels On The Road To Ruin 1976-1978' boxed set will satisfy all your needs. Overall, a fantastic boxed set, 'Neon Angels On The Road To Ruin 1976-1978' is the complete collection from one of the earliest all female rock bands.
