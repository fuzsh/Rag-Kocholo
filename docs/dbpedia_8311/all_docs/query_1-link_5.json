        "text": "Post by wilkinss77 on\n\nwhy do the runaways get classed as punk? they didn't dress like punks, & their music doesn't sound like punk to me- i'd call them classic heavy metal. in fact, when the band were around, they were usually considered to be a hard rock/heavy metal outfit, not punk. it seems to be recently that they started to get called a 'punk' band, with a couple of websites about the movie describing them as a 'female sex pistols' (go figure that one out if you can!). but why?\n\nPost by jettigre on\n\nI just have to laugh at the mis-information above.\n\nThe Runaways Heavy Metal ?\n\nNo !\n\nThey are more ''PUNK'' then Metal !\n\nThey have been the female ''PUNK'' sex pistols for the past 35 years so that is nothing NEW !\n\nPost by annihilator on\n\nTheir musical style is definitely hard rock. It's not heavy enough to be classified as 'metal', and it's definitely not punk as a musical genre, maybe just the attitude. I think the definition \"punk\" was refused by band members as well, at least a couple of them.\n\nI definitely can't see any resemblance between The Runaway's gigs and Sex Pistol's. Or the technique. Or the songwriting.\n\nPost by wilkinss77 on\n\nnot when cherie & jackie were in the band, she didn't. she only picked up the punk look after they became a 4-piece. & even then, she was the exception. none of the others adopted the punk look. their look was more glam rock than anything else during cherie & jackie's time, & they never sounded like punk- more like led zep, as the music press described them. even fallspeed, in this forum, compares their music to led zep (see the johnny guitar thread).\n\nPost by dagtoking1 on\n\nIt is rather curious isn't it? To me the Runaways are a rock band. Why do people label the Pretenders, Billy Idol, and Blondie as punk when they really are not; it was the times and the people they were playing/hanging with I think.\n\nPost by jettigre on\n\nBlondie was Punk in the beginning just listen to their early stuff.so was Billy Idol & even The Go Go's before they all went more POP in the 80's but in the 70's ? HELL YEAH , THEY WERE PUNK !\n\nI think people need to study up on their music more before commenting !\n\nPost by wilkinss77 on\n\nIt is rather curious isn't it? To me the Runaways are a rock band. Why do people label the Pretenders, Billy Idol, and Blondie as punk when they really are not; it was the times and the people they were playing/hanging with I think.\n\nwell, in the cases of blondie & billy idol, it's understandable- blondie started out as a punk band, although they changed their style to that of 'new wave' by the time they recorded, & billy idol started out in the punk bands chelsea, & generation x. but the pretenders were never punk, & the stranglers never called themselves punk either- they were new wave rock- call the stranglers punk & their fans will correct you. to get back on topic, yes, you are right, the runaways are hard rock, not punk. incidentally, when i refer to them as heavy metal, i'm talking about what was accepted as metal in the '70s- bands like deep purple, led zeppelin & thin lizzy- this, to me, is the kind of music the runaways played.\n\nPost by paulinajett on\n\nThey never were like a Punk band, they were influenced by Punk bands same as Hard Rock bands.\n\nFor me TR were a Rock band, not a Punk band or Hard Rock band. Maybe people started to say that they we're a Hard Rock or Punk band with WFTN since that was their record with ''heavy'' songs. Don't know if you guys are getting my point..\n\nPost by isitdayornight on\n\nThat is an issue that really used to tick me off back in the day. I think when The Runaways came out, their sound and image(s) were new and unique at the time. A lot of 'critics' really didn't know what to label them, which they obviously felt was necessary. I think the fact that their attitude and sound, especially after their third album, was pretty aggressive and even their look -- Joan's jet black hair, leather jacket, razor blade necklace, etc. was comparable to The Sex Pistols, they were identified more in that category. I was at a midnight showing of 'The Song Remains the Same' in 1978 wearing a Runaways t-shirt and a guy looked at it and said,\"Oh, we've got a punker here!\" not meaning anything by it, but it sill pissed me off and I said, \"The Runaways are not punk!\"\n\nPost by wilkinss77 on\n\n@fallspeed said:\n\nThey definitely were part of the scene.\n\nOn their first UK tour, their opening act was the Suburban Studs, a punk group.\n\nlots of non-punk bands in the late '70s had punk bands opening for them. over here, the runaways albums weren't included in the punk/new wave section in record stores, they were in the rock section, & nobody who knew about them called them punk. as for their association with the punk scene, that was only really joan, & only after WFTN."
