        "text": "Yay, most definitely. The records were uneven for the most part, but they had a few joints that were cool in that Hollywood proto-punk style that was hot for a minute around '75/76. I saw them at Eric's in Liverpool on their first UK tour in '76. I was at an age where I'd probably only have been slightly disappointed if they'd turned out to be garbage, but they were fucking terrific - great, ragged fun, particularly if you happened to be an adolescent boy at the time. I had a major crush on Joan Jett for years afterwards.\n\nI never saw the biopic with Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart, although I thought putting them in the movie was an inspired bit of casting. Vicki Blue, who replaced Jackie Fox (far left) on bass after the second album, later made a flawed but watchable documentary about the band a few years back called Edgeplay. It was hampered from the jump by Joan Jett's refusal to take part or to approve the use of any of the band's music, but there are some hair-raising interviews with the rest of them. Lita Ford was the only one apart from Joan who had any kind of post-Runaways career, and she came across as grateful and a little surprised to have got out at the other end in more or less one piece. Sandy West (RIP) seemed to have hit a pretty nasty downward spiral after the band split, and Cherie Currie was clearly still at war with Kim Fowley when she was interviewed. After Fowley died, I read somewhere that he and Cherie had recently finally reconciled, and that she'd spent a lot of time looking after him when he was dying.\n\nThis is the only footage of the o.g. line-up that they could clear for that doc, presumably because it wasn't an original. There's a lot of stuff out there of varying quality. Some of it's a bit sloppy, but they were teenagers so it hardly matters. They were always a better band than they were given credit for."
