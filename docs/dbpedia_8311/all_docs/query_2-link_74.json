        "text": "FAQ\n\nWho are the Runaways?\n\nThe Runaways was an all-girl rock band formed by Joan Jett and Sandy West in 1975. The band was together from 1975 to 1979, although their last performance was New Year’s Eve in 1978.\n\nDuring their time together, they put out 5 albums:\n\n-The Runaways\n\n-Queens of Noise\n\n-Live in Japan\n\n-Waitin’ for the Night\n\n-And Now…the Runaways\n\nWho was in the Runaways?\n\nThe band went through many lineups. The first two members were Joan Jett (rhythm guitar, vocals) and drummer Sandy West, who individually got in touch with their future manager, Kim Fowley, about forming an all-girl rock band. Kim Fowley brought fourteen year old Kari Krome into the fold as a songwriter, and then found a bassist and lead singer for the band, Sue Thomas (AKA Micki Steele). Lita Ford was added as lead guitarist.\n\nMicki Steele soon left after doing some live shows and making a demo tape with Joan and Sandy. She was replaced by lead singer Cherie Currie and bassist Peggy Foster. Peggy Foster lasted less than a month, and was replaced by Jackie Fox. Not long after Micki and Peggy left, Kari left as well.\n\nThis lineup, Cherie, Joan, Sandy, Lita, and Jackie, lasted for two years and is the most famous and well known lineup the Runaways ever had. They are often referred to as the “Fabulous Five.”\n\nThe summer of 1977 left the band in turmoil, with Jackie leaving during the Runaways’ tour of Japan, with Cherie soon to follow. They replaced Jackie with Vicki Blue, bassist, and Joan took over as lead vocalist. In mid-late 1978, Vicki also left, due to health and personal reasons, and Laurie McAllister replaced her on bass.\n\nList of members:\n\n- Joan Jett (1975-1979): Rhythm Guitar, Vocals, Lead Vocals\n\n-Sandy West (1975-1979): Drums, some vocals\n\n-Kari Krome (1975-1976): Songwriter\n\n-Micki Steele (1975): Lead Vocals, Bass\n\n-Lita Ford (1975-1979): Lead Guitar, some vocals\n\n-Cherie Currie (1975-1977): Lead Vocals\n\n-Peggy Foster (1975): Bass\n\n-Jackie Fox (1975-1977): Bass\n\n-Vicki Blue (1977-1978): Bass\n\n-Laurie McAllister (1978): Bass\n\nWhere can I go to learn more about the Runaways?\n\nThere is a lot of information about the Runaways out there, in various forms. There are blogs, old magazine articles, autobiographies, documentaries, biographies, and one biopic.\n\nTo start, I would suggest watching The Runaways (2010). There are many issues with this movie from a historical perspective, which is discussed in a later FAQ, but it is an entertaining and accessible intro to the story of the Runaways.\n\nNext, I would suggest reading Cherie Currie’s memoir, Neon Angel. The majority of the autobiography involves her time in the Runaways, and it provides some really fun anecdotes about the various members of the band. However, it comes from Cherie’s perspective and so does not include the whole story, and some aspects of it may be embellished. Other Runaways, specifically Jackie Fox, have taken issue with some of the events she describes. But nevertheless, it is a really good read, very well written, and provides a look into the life of one of the central figures in the Runaways’ story. PLEASE NOTE: This book contains descriptions of rape and other sexual and physical assault, including pedophilia and kidnapping. It is not a light read and may be triggering for some people.\n\nQueens of Noise: The Real Story of the Runaways is a nonfiction history of the Runaways written by Evelyn McDonnell. It provides probably the most complete telling of the Runaways story that is currently out there, detailing every lineup the Runaways had and includes interviews with and quotes from many of the members of the band. It has also been referred to as “the queerest telling” of the Runaways, and that’s no lie.\n\nThe documentary Edgeplay was directed by Victory Tischler-Blue, who was one of the bassists for the Runaways. It includes interviews with many of the members of the band and some of the figures central to the band’s story (Kim Fowley, Suzi Quatro, and parents of the band members). It does not include anything from Joan Jett, who declined to participate as she did not like the subjects that the documentary decided to focus on.\n\nJackie Fox at one point had a blog with stories and pictures from her time in the Runaways. She has since taken it down, but some wonderful person saved the stories and posted them here, bless them. She is a good writer and there’s a lot of cool stuff included in the blog.\n\nDid Joan and Cherie date?\n\nSort of, I guess. Cherie has been pretty explicit in her autobiography, the documentary Edgeplay, and various interviews that she and Joan had sexual relations at least once or twice. She also considered Joan her closest friend during her time in the Runaways. Whether or not that equates to dating, I don’t know.\n\nJoan has not directly touched on the subject, as far as I am aware, but has no issues with how the Runaways (2010) movie portrayed their relationship.\n\nDid Joan and Cherie love each other?\n\nThat is only something the two of them can answer.\n\nWho else did Joan date?\n\nFor a couple of years during the Runaways, Joan lived with a woman named Lisa Curland in an apartment across from the Whisky A Go Go. It is widely acknowledged by multiple sources that Lisa was Joan’s girlfriend.\n\nAll other rumored relationships, as far as I know, are just that: rumors. Joan is incredibly private about her personal life, and I will not do much speculating about her various relationships.\n\nWhat do you think about the Runaways movie?"
