        "text": "Very often a band will crop up who have an either hilarious, ingenious or just downright ridiculous name. For instance, there are bands called Goldfish Don’t Bounce and Stark Naked & The Car Thieves. No, I have no idea either, but you get the picture.\n\nSo here’s what happens. You and some friends get a band together. You spend a while thrashing guitars and sighing about concepts and direction, and then comes the time when you need to give yourselves a name. Where do you even begin? Well if you find yourselves called ‘Four Average Kids Who Play Instruments etc.’ then you may need to rethink it. Here are some band name etymologies from some of the brilliant bands we love. Where some are true, others are merely unconfirmed suggestions by the bands. Have a little look and listen to what inspires the bands that inspire us.\n\nPARAMORE\n\nAccording to Hayley Williams, this name was the maiden name of the mother of one of the band’s first bass players. Initially the band were unaware that ‘Paramour’ also meant ‘secret lover’. Once they discovered this, they decided to stick with it using the altered spelling.\n\nANBERLIN\n\nIn an interview with Spin Magazine (2010) lead vocalist Stephen Christian revealed that after years of speculation the band name was actually inspired by Radiohead. In the record ‘Everything In Its Right Place’, Christian believed he could hear Thom Yorke singing the word ‘Anberlin’ over and over in the background. He liked it as a word and so made it his band name.\n\n+44 (PLUS FORTY FOUR)\n\nAs the spinoff project of Travis Barker and Mark Hoppus, this name is a reference to the international dialing code for the UK where the two first chatted about the project.\n\nJIMMY EAT WORLD\n\nAccording to Jimmyeatworldonline.com the origin of this band name comes from the sibling rivalry between guitarist Tom Linton’s younger brothers Jimmy and Ed. To insult Jimmy one day, Ed drew a picture on his door showing Jimmy with a globe in his mouth and the caption ‘Jimmy Eat World’, meaning that he was so fat he could eat the world.\n\nSUM-41\n\nThese guys were originally a NOFX cover band under the moniker ‘Kaspir’. In 1996 they decided to change their name for a Supernova show which took place on the forty first day into the summer. This is apparently where the name originated. Job done.\n\nTAKING BACK SUNDAY\n\nAll sources claim to know the origins of this band, but there are two differing stories. Firstly, there is the speculation it is a reference to the b-side to ‘How Soon Is Now’ by The Smiths. Back when John Nolan was present the first time around, him and former bassist Jesse Lacey (now of Brand New) were best friends and huge fans of The Smiths. The second suggestion is that the name originated from a record by fellow Long Island band ‘The Waiting Process’ who were inspired by a grandmother that they should take back Sunday from the Christian people.\n\nTHE MAINE\n\nThis band name was apparently inspired by a record from the band Ivory named ‘The Coast of Maine’. The band shortened it down and used it as their title. If you listen below, you can hear the inspirational similarities.\n\nBLINK 182\n\nBack in the day these boys were originally called ‘Blink’. Due to an Irish band possessing the same name, they were forced to change it by adding the numbers to the end. Seemingly these numbers are random but a few sources suggest that ‘182’ is the number of times Tony Montana (Al Pacino) says f*** in the movie Scarface. Why didn’t we think of that?\n\nFALL OUT BOY\n\nInitially unnamed, they asked the audience at their second show for name suggestions. One audience member shouted ‘Fallout Boy’ in reference to the character of Radioactive Man’s sidekick in The Simpsons. The name stuck and they became a global sensation. Here’s them recording the theme and confirming the origins of the name.\n\nYELLOWCARD\n\nThe name ‘Yellowcard’ was also known as a so called ‘party foul’ at a high school party. Such as dropping a drink on the floor or falling down. Everyone seemed to adopt the football/soccer refereeing rules and shout out ‘yellowcard!’ This clicked as a name.\n\nKIDS IN GLASS HOUSES\n\nIt’s never been a secret that KIGH take a huge amount of inspiration from Glassjaw. The band name is inspired specifically by the Glassjaw record ‘Tip Your Bartender’, and the lyric “Not throwing stones at you anymore…”. Rather poetic.\n\nOver and out."
