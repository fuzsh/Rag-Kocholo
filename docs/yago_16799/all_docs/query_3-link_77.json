        "text": "4.5 stars\n\nThe power of community, the healing abilities of positive growth and shared love. Inciting Joy is a collection of \"feel good\" that I think is the perfect balm for those struggling in these times.\n\nSense of joy: ★★★★★\n\nFlow of stories: ★★★★\n\nWriting style: ★★★★\n\nThere are some books that are both shockingly simple to describe and yet so vastly large they feel impossible to shrink down into the purposes of a review. Inciting Joy is one of those reads.\n\nRoss Gay's essays in this collection all have a central theme—joy, of course—but each feels layered, framed through a different quirk of the lens, and reliant on different modes to convey their message. Joy, like all emotions, is a complex and ever-changing thing.\n\nGrowth and green things are a prominent note in this collection. Ideas of life and growing are no strangers to joy.\n\nMore surprising to some might be the inclusion of grief and exploration of loss as a means to receive the sharper, more poignant pieces of joy and uplifting emotional resonance.\n\nBeautiful, sharp, soft, and layered, Inciting Joy is a unique thumbprint on a world that often focuses on the sharp and critical. Sit down with Ross Gay for a while and feel some love. It'll help... I promise.\n\nThank you to Algonquin Books for my copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n5 stars\n\nChills. A powerful entry into the nonfiction true crime canon and the fight for justice against murdered women in America. I highly recommend the audiobook.\n\nAudiobook narration: ★★★★★\n\nPacing: ★★★★★\n\nStorytelling: ★★★★★\n\nI am tired of hearing stories of women being raped and murdered while trying to exist on this planet.\n\nI am enraged at the audacity of the white men who kill them and other marginalized communities.*\n\nAnd I am here for every expose, every carefully researched dagger into the canon of retribution and justice served in the hands of other voices who are determined to be heard and determined to change history.\n\nWelcome to Trailed: One Woman's Quest to Solve the Shenandoah Murders.\n\nIn May 1996, two young women, Lollie Winans and Julie Williams, were murdered in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. They were in their mid-20s, they were much in love with each other, and they loved being in the wilderness. They were experienced trail hikers and they had done this many times before. But this time, they never made it out of the woods.\n\nIn the years that followed their brutal murder, the National Park Service (NPS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) spent countless man hours hunting for their killer. They settled pretty quickly on Damien Rice. Rice had assaulted another woman in the park. He seemed unstable. He was in the area for the time period of their deaths. The case seemed black and white...to the investigators.\n\nIt didn't seem to matter that the perpetrator's DNA left on the crime scene didn't match Damien Rice's countless DNA records. It didn't seem to matter that this very organized and sexuality-based hate crime did not fit Rice's M.O. by any description. And it didn't seem to matter that there were several eyewitness testimonies that appeared to contradict the official timeline of Lollie and Julie's final days alive.\n\nJournalist Kathryn Miles was working as a college professor at Unity College, an environmental science and wilderness leader in the country, when she discovered the emotional footprint left on the campus by its former student, Lollie Winans. One of the murdered women from Shenandoah. The college continued to grieve Lollie's loss, and Miles found herself pulled into the case with its emotional resonance and endless question marks about validity of the investigating team's justice.\n\nKathryn Miles decided to do some digging.\n\nAnd then she couldn't stop.\n\nMeticulously researched, engrossing described, and involving a cast of characters spanning professions, states, and decades, Trailed is a memorable piece of long-form reporting. I devoured it in two days, listening to the audiobook in every spare moment of my day.\n\nTrue crime and mystery audiobook fans will recognize the narrator--Gabra Zackman's voice echoes from her previous works in I'll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara and other crime stories centered around women such as Sadie by Courtney Summers and The Night Before by Wendy Walker.\n\nA tragic story, but one that needed to see the light. Rest in peace, Julie and Lollie. We hope you have found justice here.\n\nThank you to Algonquin Books and Libro.fm for my copies in exchange for an honest review.\n\n*The statistics show the murderers skew alarmingly toward cis-het white men, I am not making a personal judgement with that fact. It is also illuminated within this nonfiction text.\n\n4 stars\n\nOur planet's resources are finite, including arguably the most important one: the water. Explained in engaging snapshots and covering several different environmental topics related to water and its use, misuse, and conservation, this book is a must-read for our younger audiences. (And us adults, too!)\n\nConcepts: ★★★★★\n\nReadability: ★★★★★\n\nPacing: ★★★\n\nWhen the World Runs Dry: Earth's Water in Crisis is the kind of nonfiction read that I hope gets taught in schools. Because I, a fully grown adult with basic knowledge of our water troubles, learned way too much information for the first time.\n\nI feel like we all should be well versed in the global situation of water. We need it to survive, it keeps everything alive, and yet... some of us remain ignorant of its journey and struggles in the current state of our Earth.\n\nTailored to younger readers, this slim book had a TON of information processed in easy-to-digest bites. A little bit on the Flint water crisis and its implications in Michigan, USA. A little bit on the history and harms of fracking. A little bit on harmful red algae. A little bit on dry wells. A little bit on a lot of things, told in an accessible and informative way.\n\nI certainly learned a lot, and I appreciated the author for her time spent on dosing it down to the entry point level for a lot of very complicated topics.\n\nWe only have so much water, y'all...\n\nA powerful read to absorb on this Earth Day. I recommend for all!\n\nThank you to the publisher for my copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n4.5 stars\n\nShort stories are little windows into infinite worlds, don't you think? At times heartfelt, at times reminiscent, at times difficult, this selection of contemporary shorts seemed to almost have it all. The world in small doses, each tale a different tone.\n\nEnjoyment: ★★★★\n\nDiversity in topics: ★★★★★\n\nResonance: ★★★★★\n\nSo let's start off with a bit of truth from me to you--I am not a contemporary reader. I am a speculative, horrific, fantastical type of reader. I actively try to escape the bounds of this world with new ones (better ones?) and find little time left for stories of the everyday.\n\nSo why did I read this? There's no dragons, no horrors. There are only people and their stories. And they are so very grounded in reality.\n\nSmall Odysseys exists because of a different form of storytelling within the same vein—the Selected Shorts program in New York. Pre-pandemic, that program existed to bring to life short stories with the talented voices of trained actors and a live audience through the power of broadcasting. As Neil Gaiman himself states in the foreword, this was truly a delight for anyone interested in stories as it existed in the cross-section of literature, theater, and radio in a way that resonated with lots of people.\n\nSo because of that gem in our culture, we now have this short story collection curated Hannah Tinti, the brains behind the original concept.\n\nSmall Odysseys was truly a delight. As they're short stories, it's hard to describe them without giving too much of their contents away so I won't do any summarizing here. Some of my favorites included Un-Selfie by Aimee Bender and Bedtime Story by Victor LaValle.\n\nJust dive in, like I did, and enjoy the ride.\n\nThank you to the publisher for my copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n4.5 stars\n\nLooking at emotions, feelings, love in forms, and concepts surrounding the self, Crushing is a memorable graphic novel.\n\nConcepts: ★★★★\n\nArtwork: ★★★★★\n\nThemes: ★★★★\n\nHmmm. How to talk about a graphic novel that doesn't use words to communicate? Seems ironic to use words themselves to talk about it. But let's give it a go anyway.\n\nCrushing is going to mean something different for everyone. That's part of its beauty.\n\nWithout words, without a harshly formed boundary created by the usual narrative structure, characters, or plot, this is a story that works like a mirror of sorts, reflecting your own impressions back on to you.\n\nFor that reason alone, it's pretty impossible to describe to others and rate semi-objectively. My rating comes from my own personal reaction to these illustrations and the feelings and memories they evoked in me. This wasn't a feel-good story of romance like we'd usually highlight in February, but love and feelings are not limited to the popular or even the typical.\n\nCrushing as a title on its own is an interesting play. Having a crush on someone, but also feeling literally crushed and the acting of self crushing under/within/on—the title is similar to its contents in the way that it waits for you, the reader, to react in order to derive meaning.\n\nMy review is a bit of nonsense. But this is a graphic novel of feelings, emotions, and reflection. It evoked in me a sense of self-reflection, moodiness, and a strange sense of nostalgia tinged with a complex lingering vibe that I'm still pondering.\n\nWhat will Crushing evoke in you?\n\nThank you to the publisher for my copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n5 stars\n\nA stunning collection, accessibly told and beautifully illustrated. A must-read for all, frankly, regardless of age. This reader (me) learned a lot and loved the reading experience.\n\nArtwork: ★★★★★\n\nEase of reading: ★★★★★\n\nEnjoyment: ★★★★★\n\nAuthor Tracey Baptiste starts out this collection in the same way that I'd like to start this review:\n\nHow much do we, as global citizens, really know about Africa's influence on the world's culture and history?\n\nWhen we celebrate Black History Month in the United States, the narrative is almost exclusively tied to the discussions of enslavement and European-American oppression inflicted on African individuals in the relatively recent past.\n\nWe rarely, if ever, go further back than that.\n\nDue to this limited scope on history—and, as a larger conversation that the author addresses, due to biases and misinterpreted histories that exist of those prior time periods--little is commonly known to this day in popular history and culture about the African continent.\n\nIn this collection, the author delves into those histories and global ties that bind Africa to our earliest beginnings of culture, language, and civilization. Who molded dynasties? Who built the cities? What African man was the richest man to ever live in the world? What women shaped our earliest cultures?\n\nI learned a tremendous amount of information in this slim volume, and frankly I was shocked at my own lack of basic knowledge—in the briefly of introduction examples in the author's first section, she shares the literal size of the African continent without its usual distortions in our most common world maps.\n\nDid you know that the countries of the United States, China, India, Japan, Eastern Europe, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, and more ALL fit within the borders of the African continent?\n\nI did NOT. In other words, Africa is second only to Asia in terms of sheer continental size.\n\nThat is just one brief, yet large, example of the knowledge to be gained from this extremely readable and enjoyable collection of short stories on Africa's earliest figures.\n\nI loved it and am thrilled to help spread the word about this collection.\n\nThank you to the publisher for my copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n4.5 stars\n\nCompelling, transformative, and reflective—this memoir of \"the last nomad\" is a must-read for fans of memoir and nonfiction.\n\nWriting: ★★★★\n\nEngagement: ★★★★★\n\nPacing: ★★★ 1/2\n\nThe Last Nomad is one of those books where it arrived to my house, I said \"oh, let me get a feel for the writing...I'll just read the first page\" and then 45 minutes later, I realized I was several chapters in and fully, completely invested in the story.\n\nThe best type of book, am I right?\n\nShugri Said Salh's compelling memoir details her experience as her family's \"last\" nomad. Now, as she immediately explains, Salh knows she is not the literal \"last nomad\" in the world. Not by a long shot. But for her familial line, generations of whom had existed similar lives as nomads in the Somali deserts, Salh IS their last nomad—her upbringing as a nomad transformed into her adulthood as a mother living in present-day suburban California.\n\nWhat does it mean to straddle two lifestyles, worlds, and realities so dramatically?\n\nFrom survival to excess, the hunt for water to the overabundance of brand options, the intimate oral histories of your elders to the immediacy of the now at the cost of the internal memory, The Last Nomad highlight's Salh's desire to record her story for posterity and for her children to keep the link to the past within her and her family. And, luckily, for us readers too. She quotes the African proverb, \"when an elder dies, a library burns\" and with this poignant remark as a touchstone, she walks us through her life experiences.\n\nI don't want to get too specific with her stories, as it would merely be a pale regurgitation of Salh's own words, so take my word for it--The Last Nomad is one-of-a-kind. It'll linger with me for some time.\n\nMany thanks to the publish for my copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n4.5 disturbed stars\n\nAmongst Jack the Ripper, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, H.H. Holmes, and the birth of the modern medical movement... there was another man murdering prostitutes and women of no means in London and Chicago. His story has somehow faded in the background of more sensationalized figures—and yet his reign of murders was no less terrifying.\n\nResearch: ★★★★★\n\nEase of reading: ★★★★\n\nContextualization: ★★★★★\n\n\"Enjoyment\": ★★★★★\n\n\"In the span of fifteen years, Dr. Thomas Neill Cream poisoned at least ten people in the United States, Britain, and Canada, a death toll with almost no precedents. Structured around Cream’s London murder trial in 1892, when he was finally brought to justice, The Case of the Murderous Dr. Cream exposes the blind trust given to medical practitioners, as well as the flawed detection methods, bungled investigations, corrupt officials, and stifling morality of Victorian society that allowed Cream to prey on vulnerable and desperate women, many of whom had turned to him for medical help.\"\n\nI've pulled right from the book's blurb above because I think it's a near-perfect way to describe the contents of this piece of research.\n\nAre you aware of London's Jack the Ripper? Of course.\n\nBut are you aware of Dr. Thomas Neill Cream? You should be, as he was worse.\n\nThe only way I can describe my reading experience for this book is: baffling and horrifying. Here was a white man from a rich Canadian family hiding behind a doctor's degree in the late 1800s—who managed to evade justice for literal decades of murdering across three countries. He was suspected, questioned, arrested, and identified as a predator on multiple occasions throughout his reign of global terror... and yet money, corruption, sexism, racism, and more kept him on the streets.\n\nHow did he do it? HOW did he get away with it, when his murders were nearly identical, he was tied to the scenes of the crime and the victims, and his mental state gave him away at nearly every turn with erratic behaviors and letters of confession sent to the police?\n\nAuthor Dean Jobb takes us on this chilling, ominous journey through immaculately researched chapters and photos detailing every leg of Dr. Cream's life. In a similar manner to The Devil and the White City, this work includes direct quotations in a narrative style—all sourced—and play-by-play journeys from each of Dr. Cream's murderous explorations. The writing style with dialogue and descriptions made for an easy, almost fictional/narrative read, but this is no work of fiction.\n\nI found it chilling to see Dr. Cream in photos, and even more disturbing to read the blackmail letters he sent to the police and the documents written down about him at the time. Seeing the plight of the Victorian single woman—often existing at society's fringes in prostitution, one of the few lucrative positions available to her—and her fatal encounters with a doctor whom she thought she could trust... chilling.\n\nDean Jobb has done a fantastic job with this work. I put it right up there with Devil in the White City and The Butchering Art, both nonfiction works dealing with similar subject matter.\n\nThe only elements of this work that I wish the author had provided more context for were the discussions on sexism and race that played out in Dr. Cream's ability to evade justice. He preyed on white female prostitutes, and in one particular court case his lawyer was easily able to discredit a witness because she was a Black woman. Jobb discusses the sexism at work during these times in an afterword at the end—most likely as a way to keep the editorialization minimal within the \"narrative\" timeline—but he does not go into detail on the levels of racism at play. Even though we as readers could reasonably take it as a given, due to the time period, it would have been appropriate to give that topic more airtime.\n\nThank you to Algonquin Books for my copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\n5 stars\n\nThe future is hopeful. And it's being led by our youngest generation.\n\nWalk in the steps of those who protested in 1903 in the March of the Mill Children and see where the fight continues on in those who participated in the George Floyd protests... as well as all of the ones that came between. 15 powerful stories. 1 nation.\n\nOrganization of stories: ★★★★★\n\nResonance: ★★★★★\n\nEnjoyment: ★★★★★\n\nWhen you think of a line of protesters, who do you picture? How old are they?\n\nIf you're like me, the group of people attending a social protest is a varied group in my imagination but, in general, they have one thing in common—they're adults. Adults tend to have louder voices, more ability to self-advocate, and more experience to draw from in an organized space. Right?\n\nIn Kids on the March, you'd be wrong.\n\nDelving into 15 stories of kid-led and kid-focused protests for social justice, this slim volume packs a very memorable punch. When the youngest of us know what is right, and what is wrong, and they decide to speak up... their voices are loud enough to be heard. And they have a right to their space.\n\nI devoured this collection. There's no other word for it. Author Michael B Long is on to something when he pulls us along on a journey through the twentieth century's most active youth-led protests—and the changes they demanded. From young children desperate for more ethical work hours in 1903 to the 1951 Strike for a Better School that led to the Brown v. Board of Education titan of social justice to the more modern March for Our Lives and the Black Lives Matter protests.... this is a powerful body of work. And an inspiring one.\n\n\"Let us pray with our legs. Let us march in unison to the rhythm of justice, because I say enough is enough.\" -Demetri Hoth, Senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (2018)\n\nI recommend this to all, especially my fellow Americans.\n\nMany thanks to Algonquin for Young Readers for my copy in exchange for an honest review."
