THE STONEMAN MURDERS is a refreshing change from the crass and vulgar films churned out in the name of middle-of-the-road cinema. Watch it!.On the whole, THE STONEMAN MURDERS is an engrossing fare that would appeal more to the multiplex junta of big centres.\n\nVisit Site for More\n\nRatings: 2/5 Reviewer:Rajeev Masand Site:Ibnlive\n\nAs it is, The Stoneman Murders is not entirely a waste of time, and it’s helped enormously by an inspired performance from Kay Kay Menon. I’ll go with two out of five, and a recommendation to catch it at a late evening show with a bucket of popcorn. At an hour and forty minutes in running time, it’s a pretty painless watch.\n\nRatings: 2.5/5 Reviewer:Nithya Ramani Site:Rediff\n\nLet me be honest. I had very little expectations from this week’s release, The Stoneman Murders. But I was pleasantly surprised with what I saw.Writer-director Manish Gupta does a wonderful job in telling the story, which has a very realistic touch. Despite being a murder mystery, Gupta avoids gore and bloodshed, and makes it visually appealing.The Stoneman Murders is worth a watch\n\nVisit Site for More\n\nRatings: 3/5 Reviewer:Gaurav Malini Site:Indiatimes\n\nThe Stoneman Murders is a fictitious tale based on the real life footpath stoning incidents that made headlines in the early 80s in Mumbai. While the mystery behind the case still remains unsolved, the appeal of the film lies in its smart storytelling that cinematically solves the mystery behind the murders and furthermore explains how the case still remains unsolved in police records and public eye till today. The Stoneman Murders is a modest murder mystery that doesnt prematurely kill the thrill."
