        "text": "Inspiration.\n\nSuch amazing strength of spirit.\n\nWords of such encouragement – resilience – inspiration – hope – written even in despair\n\nBy two young, heartbroken, high school students who survived a deadly horrific trauma.\n\nSurprised and terrified by a horrible act of fatal violence in their very own school.\n\nNeeding to express their overwhelming feelings, two of the drama students wrote this song.\n\nJust hours after the tragedy.\n\nTurning their heartache, pain, grief, and terror into a beautiful piece of musical art.\n\n“We’re not gonna let you win\n\nWe’re putting up a fight\n\nYou may have brought the dark but together we will shine the light,”\n\n** Written and performed by Stoneman Douglas HS students, 16-year-old Sawyer Garrity and 15-year-old Andrea Peña a few days after their school endured a mass shooting that killed 17 people. If you have not heard the song, it’s heartbreaking and inspirational.\n\nListen to this song:\n\nAs said by CNN: “The Stoneman Douglas High school drama club perform “Shine,” a song they wrote in the wake of the shooting at their Parkland, Florida, school. For more information visit: ShineMSD.org “\n\nClick here to read more about this tragic incident.\n\nWhat an incredible piece of music!\n\nThese high school students remind me of the beauty of spirit I see in dissociative trauma survivors. And this tragedy reminds me of how I’ve seen DID survivors rise above the unspeakable horrors that should have never happen.\n\nThe incident in Parkland, Florida happened quickly, suddenly with an explosion of pain, violence, heartache, grief, and terror. Those students, teachers, families, and community members will be forever changed. Many of those affected will be actively experiencing PTSD and anxiety, and afraid to leave their homes, having nightmares, and flashbacks. And by now, many of these trauma survivors will be overwhelmed in depression and despair.\n\nDID survivors know these places of pain very well.\n\nDID survivors know what it’s like to be terrified, to be afraid for their lives, to escape with just an inch of life to spare.\n\nDID survivors know what it’s like to experience violent injuries, and woundings, and have their bodies attacked without reason.\n\nDID survivors know what it’s like to have PTSD, flashbacks, nightmares, crippling fear, and debilitating depression.\n\nDID survivors know what it’s like to have their lives changed by someone else’s violent rampages.\n\nDID survivors have been in places that exist beyond comprehension for those of us who believe in compassion and kindness, goodness, and love.\n\nAND… like Sawyer Garrity and Andrea Peña, you’ve risen above the tragedy, and you’ve learned to shine.\n\nYou’ve learned how to overcome the evil darkness that tried to destroy you.\n\nYou have been stronger than those who hurt you.\n\nI hope that you listen to this song, a few dozen times. Listen over and over.\n\nMaybe even pull out some pen and paper, and write more words of feeling, of expression, of soul-speak. Write, draw, sing, journal what feels true to you. Let all your system join in, especially the ones who sit closest to your trauma, and pain.\n\nListen to the song again. Remember to encourage ALL of your insiders to listen to, and feel, and sit inside the music as well.\n\nClaim the words.\n\nClaim the encouragement.\n\nClaim the inspiration for yourself as well.\n\nIt belongs to you.\n\nAnd to your inside people.\n\nYou may not have been at that high school, but you’ve been to those places of violence all too many times.\n\nAnd yet…. you still shine. Your DID system shines. Your inside group is totally amazing. You are leaders in life, because you have risen so far above the depths of darkness.\n\nYou can love.\n\nYou can laugh.\n\nYou are stronger.\n\nYou are something special.\n\nYou have raised your voices.\n\nYou have made a difference in this world.\n\nYou DO shine!\n\nAnd I am so very very very proud to know YOU, because YOU and your incredible DID System are my absolute heroes too.\n\nI wish you the very very best in your resilient, shiny, healing journey.\n\nWarmly,\n\nKathy"
