        "text": "The Electric Vendetta is the third episode of the fourth series of the popular ITV crime drama Midsomer Murders and originally aired on 2nd September 2001.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nWhile some of the residents of Midsomer Parva have a particular interest in the appearance of crop circles, the police have a definite interest when the bodies of naked men start appearing in them. Local UFOlogist Lloyd Kirby preaches that extra-terrestrials are at work, but Barnaby looks to more earthly explanations.\n\nPlot, Part 1[]\n\n40 Years Ago: Sir Christian Aubrey and Peter Rhodes, Marquis of Ross are dueling. Sir Christian slices Lord Peter on the face and he falls to the ground. The duel is halted. Sir Christian tries to shake Lord Peter's hand. Lord Peter says, \"It'll never be over. Jamais vaincu.\"\n\nPresent day: In the middle of a field, Sally Boulter is making out with Steve Ramsey. They can hear Sir Harry Chatwyn who is on the edge of the field with his dog. Sir Harry fires a couple of shots. Sally and Steve run away.\n\nFirst Body: Sir Harry sees crop circles cut into his field. In the center circle is a dead naked body.\n\nLady Beatrice Chatwyn is driving into town. There is a sign in front of the post office \"Midsomer UFOlogy CENTRE and Crop Circle Tours.\" Lady Beatrice goes into the UFOlogy Centre and calls to Lloyd Kirby. She tells him that if they hurry, they might get to the crop circle before the police.\n\nDCI Barnaby and DS Troy arrive to look at the body in the crop circle. Troy says he looks scared to death. He is naked lying on his stomach with holes at the base of the spine, a chunk of hair missing, burn marks on his hands and a terrified expression. Troy asks Barnaby if he thinks the crop circles are made by flying saucers. Barnaby says last he heard they are made with a board and a bit of string.\n\nLady Beatrice arrives at the field with the crop circles with Lloyd and goes immediately to yell at her husband, Sir Harry. He had said he'd give her 20 minutes start, but the police are already there on the scene. Sir Harry tells the detectives he was out hunting partridge and saw the crop circle. Sir Harry says, \"Then I realised there was something in the circle. So I went down to have a look and lo and behold there was this chap lying starkers in the middle of it.\"\n\nLloyd Kirby comes up to speak to Barnaby. He says, \"I can help you. I'm Lloyd Kirby. The UFOlogist from Midsomer Parva...This bears all the marks of extraterrestrial activity. It's been my lifelong field of study,\" Lloyd gives Barnaby a copy of his book, \"Close Encounters of the Midsomer Kind.\" Lloyd says, \"There are altogether too many instances of people being abducted like this...We use the term \"Unidentified Flying Objects\" because nobody upon this earth has yet been able to identify one. Mind if I took a few pictures for my newsletter? Crop circles are ten a penny but an abduction site like this - that's something else.\" Troy stops him from taking photos.\n\nAt the lab, Pathologist, Dr. Michael Rycroft says the man was electrocuted by something very strong. Troy comes in and says the victim is Ronald Stokes, aged 58, and he has three convictions for GBH and one for wounding. Barnaby wonders what was he doing in Midsomer Parva. Dr. Rycroft continues, \"The shock travelled up his left arm and stopped his heart.\" Barnaby says, \"That would account for the expression on his face then? And the puncture marks on his back?\" Rycroft says, \"They're not deep. They don't go into the spine or anything like that. And they were inflicted an hour or two after death.\" It seems likely that he was electrocuted elsewhere and somebody dumped his body in the crop circle.\n\nBack at the Chetwyn home, Lady Beatrice is at home when Sir Harry walks in and watches his daughter and her husband through the window. Sir Harry says to Lady Beatrice, \"Have you any idea what people say about you associating with Lloyd Kirby?\" Lady Beatrice says, \"It doesn't concern me what people think. Lloyd Kirby may be interested in extraterrestrial forms of life but he has more humanity in his little finger than you have in your entire body!\"\n\nBarnaby and Troy go to the UFO Center. They ask Lloyd to come to the police station. Barnaby wants to know if Lloyd moved the body into the crop circle. Barnaby also points to photos in Lloyd's book showing a man with puncture marks in his back and hair shaved. Lloyd says, \"That's where samples of spinal fluid were taken...It's widely believed among UFOlogists that tufts of hair are taken so that studies can be made of the DNA.\" The discovery of the body has been good for business. Lloyd says, \"I have a minibus full of enthusiasts due at the centre at any minute. I'm due to give them a lecture on the Midsomer crop circles.\" Barnaby tells him that the crop circle where the body was found is a crime scene and the penalties for disturbing it can be very, very, severe. Lloyd says, \"I'm giving a talk tonight in the village hall. Pop in. You might learn a thing or two. I don't expect you to take me seriously. People all over the world have reported extraterrestrial activity, and they're always called cranks or liars.\" Sir Christian Aubrey has arrived and is offering bail for Lloyd. Sir Christian says he's known Lloyd since he and Lady Beatrice were children. He's completely harmless. Sir Christian says, \"He came to Burma 20 years ago. I was Consul-General in Rangoon at the time and Lloyd was sentenced to death for smuggling hеrοin. It was a trumped-up charge. Lloyd was an easy target. We managed to get him off.\" Barnaby says, \"Well, he's not been arrested and I do not intend to charge him.\"\n\nPlot, Part 2[]\n\nSir Harry Chatwyn arrives at the Newton Lane Health Centre in Midsomer Parva and asks Receptionist, Sally Boulter, if she could arrange a home visit for him. This is code for arranging a sexual liaison.\n\nSir Harry Chatwyn arrives home. Steve Ramsey is yelling at his wife, Lucy Ramsey. Steve says, \"What kind of ironing do you call this, you stupid cow? Look at the creases!\" Lucy says, \"I said I'd take them to the cleaners.\" Sir Harry says, \"What's all the shouting for?\" Lucy says, \"He's going on about his trousers.\" Steve says, \"Look at the creases! How am I supposed to wear these now?\" Sir Harry says, \"Why don't you iron them yourself if you're so particular?\" Lucy says, \"Stay out of it, Daddy.\" Sir Harry says, \"You were probably only going to take them off, so why bother?\" Lucy says, \"I'll do them again.\" Steve says, \"No you won't. What did I marry into?!\" and walks out.\n\nIn the dark woods, next to the field with the crop circles, a man is trying to persuade his date to have sex in the middle of a crop circle.\n\nAt the UFO meeting, Lady Beatrice calls the meeting to order. Lloyd says, \"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming here. Ah, crop circles. They're nothing new, you know. Nowadays, people reckon that these are made by hoaxers. But in many parts of the world, they've long been the focus of serious religious belief. So this evening, I'm going to show you who makes them and why.\" Sir Harry, sitting in the back, says, \"I'll tell you who makes them, Lloyd. Nutters like you! Who ruin tons of good wheat every year. Ought to be a law against you.\" He walks out and the crowd mutters. Lloyd continues, \"Sorry about the interruption, but I notice that Mr Barnaby, who is investigating the death of the man whose body was found in the crop circle, has come along this evening. Good to see the police are taking a serious interest in what we've all known for years. We are not alone in this universe. And yet, the authorities have an entire department which is set up to rubbish what we say and to vilify anyone who claims a close encounter. An entire department? (Crowd mutters) This smacks to me of taking it very seriously indeed.\" The crowd claps.\n\nSecond Body: (Eerie music) The couple goes to a crop circle and the man takes off his clothes. The woman stretches her hand out and touches a dead body. She starts screaming.\n\nBarnaby and Troy leave the UFO meeting. Troy reports another body been discovered. in a second crop circle. As they are driving, enormous headlights start coming toward them. Barnaby gets out of the car and starts to walk toward the lights. He tells the driver of the combine harvester to dim his lights in oncoming traffic.\n\nBarnaby and Troy see a body in the same condition as the previous one. Troy says, \"It's Eddie Field, the burglar from Aspern Tallow.\"\n\nSir Harry goes to Ivy Cottage to meet with Sally Boulter. She asks where he's been- he's late? Sir Harry says there are police crawling all over the big wheat field. They found another body in a crop circle. Sir Harry tells Sally they are going to have to find another place to meet. His son-in-law, Steve, says he's gonna make Ivy Cottage a nice little love-nest for him and Lucy. Except he's too busy chasing round after Sally to do anything about it. Sir Harry tells Sally not to see Steve anymore. He's only been married a month. She threatens to tell Lady Beatrice if he interferes.\n\nDr. Rycroft says the second body was electrocuted. He's found traces of a mineral oil used in engineering and there's silver oxide on his hands. Barnaby tells Troy that Eddie Field was involved with a small foundry business run by a local man, Dave Ripert. Ripert was suspected of melting down stolen bullion. Troy says there was a burglary in Badger's Drift last night at The Beeches. It had Eddie Field's name written all over it.\n\nAt the Chatwyn home, Lucy goes outside to confront her husband, Steve. She says, \"You were out clubbing in Causton last night, weren't you?\" Steve says, \"What if I was? Think I enjoy being stuck out in the middle of a field? I'm sick of your parents. Sick of them hating each other and taking it out on me.\" Lucy says, \"We're supposed to be living in Ivy Cottage. Why don't you come and help me get it ready?\" Steve says, \"Why don't you ask your father why? He wants it for himself, if you ask me. Anything to get away from your mother as long as it stops short of divorce.\" Lucy says, \"It doesn't belong to Sir Harry. It's Mummy's and she wants me to have it.\" Steve says, \"Get her to do something about it, then. Instead of hanging around with that nutcase, Lloyd. God, insanity doesn't run in your family, it gallops.\" Lucy says, \"I hate you. I wish I'd never married you.\" Steve says, \"But you did because you like what Stevie does to you, don't you, my sweet little chicken?\" Lucy slaps him and calls him a bastard.\n\nBarnaby asks Troy what was stolen at The Beeches? Troy says, \"TV and video, jewelry, bits of china, some silver, and a couple of paintings. The owner was out at the time. It wasn't reported till the early hours.\" Troy opens the door of the old foundry. No one's been in the place for over a year, according to the agent. Barnaby finds an object in the furnace. Someone has tried to melt it down. He tells Troy to check it out in the stolen antiques register. They find food that says use by the 10th- two days ago. Barnaby tells Troy to go and see what Mr Ripert has to say about all this.\n\nTroy goes to Dave Ripert's. Ripert won't let him in the house without a warrant. Troy asks about the foundry at Midsomer Parva. Dave says it doesn't belong to him anymore. Troy leaves and Sally walks down the stairs. There are stolen items all over the place. Dave says they should hide the stuff at Sally's place. Elderly sisters, Alice Leonard and Marian Leonard watch Sally and Dave move things and call the police.\n\nBarnaby goes to interview Lady Beatrice. She tells him Lloyd's mother was housekeeper at her home. His father was the farm foreman. She and Lloyd were born on the same day. They were playmates and childhood sweethearts. Then, inconveniently, they fell in love. Lady Beatrice says, \"My parents were self-made. They moved here to acquire class. My father was determined I should marry gentry, so he threatened Lloyd's parents with dismissal unless they agreed to send Lloyd to Australia. I was made to marry Sir Harry. No money, but a title. And all the bad habits to go with it. I gave birth to Lucy and there the marriage ended in all but appearance.\" Since Lloyd has returned they have friendship. Even love of a kind.\n\nPlot, Part 3[]\n\nMURDER 1: In the evening, Sally and Steve put their clothes back on after making out in the crop circle. Someone is watching them from the woods. Steve gets in his car and turns on the engine. The car electrocutes him. The next morning, Lloyd is bringing people to see the crop circles when he spies Steve's truck. He sees a charred dead body inside.\n\nBarnaby is investigating Steve's burnt truck. Lloyd says, \"This is getting serious.\" Barnaby says, \"Why do you say that, Lloyd?\" Lloyd says, \"Because Steve was electrocuted, that's why. This has nothing whatever to do with extraterrestrial forms of life.\" Barnaby says, \" I agree with you, Lloyd. This is murder.\" Troy comes up and tells Barnaby that one of the old dears at the post office reported seeing Dave Ripert unloading boxes at the health centre. They were going into the flat upstairs. The receptionist lives there, a girl named Sally Boulter. Drives a VW, black, which was parked outside Ripert's when he refused to let Troy in.\n\nAt the morgue, Sir Harry goes to identify Steven Ramsey's body. Lucy starts to cry and her mother hugs her.\n\nAt the police lab, the techs examine the burnt car. The tech says, \"Everything electrical has blown. The bulbs, the fuses. The wiring loom's been welded together. Whatever it was, it was a bit more powerful than a domestic supply.\" Barnaby asks, \"What about other vehicle tracks where the pick-up was found?\" The tech says, \"Sir Harry Chatwyn's Landrover, combine harvester, horses' hoof prints. As he says, they use that track all the time.\" Barnaby shows Troy and the techie photos from Lloyd's book. The photographs were taken, supposedly, in Idaho in 1970. And the man was electrocuted in a manner very similar to Steve Ramsey. There was no satisfactory explanation so the flying saucer freaks put it down to extraterrestrial interference. Barnaby wonders if someone closer to home may have been influenced by the pictures.\n\nAt the Post Office/store, Barnaby speaks to Alice. She says poor Steve was not married a month yet. It was a village occasion. Steve was well liked by the girls, especially by Sally Boulter. Sally is also sweet with Sir Harry.\n\nAt the nursing home, Sir Christian visits with his wife, Lady Isabel. She says, \"What on earth is happening in our quiet little backwater, Christian? Poor Lloyd's alien chums littering our cornfields with corpses. Do you suppose he's safe himself?\" Sir Christian says, \"I'm not sure that he is, to tell you the truth. He's stuck his neck out on all this. I wouldn't be all that surprised if someone put it in a noose.\" Lady Isabel says, \"Oh, good God, darling. The poor boy doesn't deserve that. Anyway, I shall be most upset if I pop off before they get to the bottom of it all. Though, where I'm going... ..perhaps all will be revealed? How wonderfully lucky I've been... ..to have had a lifetime in love. Take me home, please, Christian. Just one more time?\"\n\nBarnaby walks through the woods on the edge of the field and looks at electric lines. He finds a fenced in power station. The lock for the station has been cut through and there are tire tracks.\n\nTroy goes to speak to Sally Boulter. Troy says, \"I believe you're a friend of Dave Ripert's?\" Sally says, \"Dave's been helping me move stuff out of my Gran's place. I've been clearing out the house since she died. She left me some lovely old things. Perhaps you'd like to come and see them when I get it straightened out?\"\n\nTroy goes to sit beside Barnaby at the UFO meeting. Reverend Ellis says, \"Welcome, everyone. I know that you're all perturbed, as I am, by these unfortunate events in our village. For myself, I'm sure that these dreadful deaths will turn out to be not the work of any alien hand but of man himself, guided by the Prince of Darkness and I would like to...\" Lloyd stands up and says, \"I'd like to say something if I may? I believe that the first of these terrible deaths was an unfortunate accident.(members of the audience heckle)....a casualty of scientific research into our human nature, by extraterrestrial intelligence of quite awesome power.\" (audience yells- Rubbish! Oh, let him finish, will you?) .. Sir Harry says, \"Can't someone shut the fool up? ( Applause ) Lloyd continues, \"But as for the subsequent two deaths, I agree with the police. They had nothing whatever to do with...\" Sir Harry says, \"Absolute tosh, Lloyd! The only person around here to see any one of these so-called flying saucers is you. (Crowd chat and argue). The Reverend asks Barnaby to comment. Barnaby says, \"What we do know, what we can be sure of, is that all three victims were electrocuted. The circumstances in which the first two men came to die - accident or design - is yet unknown. But the third man, the unfortunate Steven Ramsey was murdered. Of that there can be no doubt but please let me reassure you that the person or persons responsible will be brought to justice.\" The vicar quotes bible verses and a member of the audience quotes back. Sir Harry leaves the meeting.\n\nPlot, Part 4[]\n\nBarnaby goes after Sir Harry and asks about his opinion of his late son-in-law, Steve Ramsey? Was he opposed to the marriage? Sir Harry says, \"Implacably. I was, as ever, overruled.\" Barnaby continues, \"And I believe you objected to his relationship with Miss Boulter?\" Sir Harry says, \"You're damned right I did. What would you have done if it had been your own daughter?\" Barnaby says, \"Just one more question, please, Sir Harry. The electricity substation between your two big wheat fields? Do you hold a key to it? Nothing to do with me, dear chap. Property of the electricity supply company. I'm damned if I can remember their name.\"\n\nAt Sir Christian Aubrey's home, Lady Isabel says, \"There is one piece of unfinished business I'd dearly love to settle. I can't bear to think of Peter all that way up in Ross with his heart poisoned by feelings of revenge.\" Sir Christian says, \" He's got the produce and the profits of the finest distillery in Scotland to comfort him.\" Lady Isabel says, \"I know you've protected us through the years, but... ..but if I were to offer him forgiveness now, if I were to ask him, do you think he'd come and see me?\"\n\nAt Ivy Cottage, Sally tells Sir Harry she's not in the mood. She says, \"You did it, didn't you? Killed Steve. God, you hated him. You were jealous of him doing it with me and you certainly didn't want him marrying Lucy.\" Sally asks if she can keep some stuff her grandmother gave her in the cottage. \"Pots and pans, bits and pieces. It's just till I get a bigger place.\" Sir Harry says, \"Of course. Want me to come and pick them up with the Landrover?\" Sally says, \"I'll stick them in the back of the car.\" She then decides she is in the mood for sex with Sir Harry.\n\nTroy tells Barnaby that the wheat in the circles was burnt by butane gas, which comes in cylinders for gas blowtorches. It is available at any DIY store. The detectives go over to Sir Christian Aubrey's home. He introduces them to his wife, Lady Isabel. She asks, \"Are you investigating these mysterious deaths?\" Barnaby says, \"Indeed we are, Lady Isabel.\" Sir Christian says, \"I'd heard, wrongly as it turned out, that Lloyd had been arrested, so I came to bail him out.\" Lady Isabel says, \"Lloyd? What on Earth would you arrest Lloyd for?\" Sir Christian says, \"Didn't you have an idea he might've put the body in the crop circle to drum up business for his UFOlogy Centre?\" Barnaby says, \"Yes, we had thought that.\" Lady Isabel says, \"He's one of nature's eccentrics, Mr Barnaby. He has a disarming innocence about him. He's had it ever since childhood. And in spite of what's happened, it's still there. Lloyd will die as innocent as the day he was born.\" Troy asks, \"So what do you think happened in the wheat field then, sir?\" Sir Christian says, \"I believe that someone took advantage of the situation and poor Lloyd swallowed it, hook, line and saucer.\" Lady Isabel says, \"All men are credulous animals. We must all believe in something.\" Sir Christian shows them a flying saucer. He says, \"Lloyd made that on death row in a Rangoon jail with nothing but flour, water and papier mache.\" Barnaby sees another machine and asks, \"Is that the Wimshurst machine?\" Sir Christian says, \"Yes, indeed. All these belonged to my father. He was a science teacher.\" Sir Christian has to leave to take his wife back to the nursing home. Outside Barnaby says to Troy, \"Let's come back another day, when the coast is clear.\"\n\nSir Harry, Lady Beatrice and Lucy leave the funeral. Lady Beatrice says, \"This is your doing, Harry. I know it is.\" Sir Harry says, \"Don't talk rubbish.\" Lady Beatrice says, \"You've said not a single word of regret. Not one.\" Lucy says, \"Please, Mummy. Not now.\"\n\nTroy and Barnaby break into Sir Christian's house. Troy shuts the door and when he goes back to open it his hand gets electrocuted a few inches from the knob. (Alarm beeps softly.) Barnaby also tries and same thing happens to him. (Alarm beeps softly.) Troy tries the back door. Same thing happens. (Alarm beeps softly.) Barnaby says, \"The whole place must be wired.\" Barnaby tries using a golf club with a rubber handle, which gets electrocuted. (Alarm beeps softly.) Troy says, \"Could that kill a man?\" Barnaby says, \"Yes, it could Troy. Especially if he's got a weak heart. Use your mobile, get onto the station. Tell them to send a man up here with rubber gloves.\" Troy says, \"There's no signal. Just static. I'll have to try the landline.\" Barnaby says, \"No, no, no. Wait - hang on, hang on.\" He tries using the golf club and it gets electrocuted. (Alarm beeps softly.) Troy says, \"How long do you think it'll be before he's back?\" Barnaby replies, \"I've got no idea, but I've got a feeling it'll be worth waiting for.\"\n\nAt the nursing home, Lady Isabel is in bed, hooked up to machines. She says, \"You look worried, my love.\" Sir Christian says, \"Lloyd called to say...\" Lady Isabel says, \"Goodbye?\"\n\nBack at Sir Christian's house, Troy and Barnaby are sleeping. Troy wakes up. There is a trash collector outside. They both yell at the man, but he can't hear them. Meanwhile, Sally is busily carrying stolen silver and other items upstairs at Ivy Cottage.\n\nPlot, Part 5[]\n\nSir Christian arrives home and turns off the alarm. He opens the door carefully and looks around. He grabs a sword. He sees the police sleeping. Sir Christian says, \"Well, well. Did you come back for another few turns of the Wimshurst machine?\" Barnaby says, \"We are investigating a series of murders, Sir Christian.\" Sir Christian says, \"And no doubt you have a search warrant in your pocket, do you? It's alright, gentlemen. You can get up now. I've switched everything off.\" Barnaby says, \"That's a lethal security system you have here, Sir Christian. Thing like that could kill a man.\" Sir Christian says, \"It's kept intruders out of my home for years.\" Sir Christian is invited to the police station and arms the system before he leaves.\n\nLloyd is with Lady Beatrice. He looks sad. Lady Beatrice says, \"I don't like seeing you like this, Lloyd. I'm convinced that Sir Harry murdered Steve.\" Lloyd says, \"Will they put him away?\" Lady Beatrice says, \"I hope so. I do hope so.\" Lloyd says, \"After we got back from the Roxy that night, I made the crop circle with board and string, I put the body in it, I clipped his hair and I put the holes in his back. He died at someone else's house. He wasn't murdered. Anyway, I agreed to get rid of the body. And I'm so sorry I deceived you. I just wanted people to take extraterrestrial visitation more seriously. And look what I've unleashed.\" Lady Beatrice tells him to go back to the cottage and wait for her there.\n\nLloyd goes up the stairs and goes into his old room in Ivy Cottage. Sally is lying on the bed looking at the silver. She says, \"Hello, Lloyd. What a surprise.\" Lloyd says, \"Sally? I thought this place was...empty. What are you doing with all this stuff?\" Sally says, \"It's, ah, treasure, Lloyd, and it's all mine.\" Lloyd asks, \"Where'd you get it from?\" Sally says, \"Well, that's for me to know and you not to find out. But it didn't come from Mars.\" Dave Ripert comes up and tosses Lloyd down the stairs.\n\nAt the police station, Sir Christian says, \"I came home from the hospice after visiting Lady Isabel to find a man lying on the floor. He'd been dead for a couple of hours. You see, this man - Oh, what was his name? Ronnie Stokes. He'd been sent to kill me. It wasn't the first time. In the early days there were maybe half a dozen attempts on my life. Latterly, we'd begun to relax. The idea was that anyone coming to Midsomer Parva with malicious intent was to get the shock of his life, if you'll excuse the pun. Sadly, he was killed instead.\" Barnaby asks, \"And who sent these people to try to kill you, Sir Christian?\" Sir Christian says, \"I'm afraid that starts 40 years ago. You see when I was a student at Oxford, I fell in love with Lady Isabel, but my great friend, Peter Rhodes, the Marquis of Ross, was also in love with her.\" (Flashback: Peter says, \"I know, we'll decide it with a duel.\" Isabel says, \"You're crazy! You're crazy, the both of you.\" Christian duels and cuts Peter's face.) \"Peter was so incensed at having lost that he vowed to kill me. So he sits up in the family distillery in Scotland with nothing better to do than plot revenge.\" Barnaby queries, \"And these men he sent?\" Sir Christian says, \"Usually the local police took care of them. I had them deported quietly. The other day was a mistake. A big mistake.\" Barnaby says, \"Could I bring you back to Lloyd, please, Sir Christian? You see, I mean, with respect, I can't believe you would be able to lift a 13-stone man on your own.\" Sir Christian says, \"Yes, alright. Lloyd took him out to the wheat field.\" Barnaby says, \"And the puncture marks and the funny haircut?\" Sir Christian says, \"I'm sure they didn't fool you for a minute, did they?\" Troy leaves. Sir Christian continues, \"Mr Barnaby, Lady Isabel is dying. May I sign a statement and be taken to her?\" Troy walks in. Barnaby leaves the interrogation.\n\nPlot, Part 6[]\n\nMURDER 2: Troy tells Barnaby that Lloyd Kirby's been found dead in a crop circle. \"Yet another body on Sir Harry Chatwyn's land.\" At the crop circle, Troy points out, \"There's no missing hair. And no puncture marks.\" At the morgue, Dr. Rycroft says, \"It's not like the others, Barnaby. The nose is broken and the neck, too, which is no doubt what killed him.\"\n\nLord Peter Rhodes drives his car down to Midsomer Parva. He stops at the Post Office and tells the clerk he is looking for Sir Christian Aubrey. Brook House and asks for directions.\n\nBarnaby and Troy tell Sir Harry they would like a word with him about a murder. Sir Harry volunteers, \"I hated him and I loved her. I couldn't let it go on any longer.\" Barnaby asks, \"Was it because he was having an affair with your wife?\" Sir Harry says, \"My wife? He was having an affair with that doctor's receptionist, Sally Boulter.\" Barnaby asks, \"So why did you kill Lloyd Kirby?\" Sir Harry says, \"Lloyd Kirby? I didn't says anything about killing Lloyd Kirby. He's a lunatic. Is he dead?\" Barnaby says, \"I'm afraid so. And I believe you killed Steven Ramsey. Would you mind telling us how it happened?\" (Flashback: Eerie music. Steve gets into his truck and turns the key and is electrocuted while Sir Harry watches from the woods. He removes the cables from the electrical station and from the bumper of the truck. Then he tows the truck to where it was found.) Barnaby says, \"Sir Harry Chatwyn, I'm arresting you for the murder of Steven Ramsey.\" Lucy and Lady Beatrice walk in. Lucy says, \"Daddy, what's going on?\" Lady Beatrice says, \"He's been arrested for the murder of your husband.\" Lucy says, \"No! There must be some mistake! He's my father. He wouldn't do that, would you, Daddy?\" Sir Harry says, \"I couldn't bear him treating you as he did. He was no good, Lucy.\" Lady Beatrice says, \"I hope you rot in hell!\" Sir Harry says, \"I probably will. But I didn't kill Lloyd.\" Lady Beatrice says, \"Lloyd? What are you talking about?\" Barnaby says, \"I'm afraid it's true, Lady Chatwyn. Lloyd Kirby was found dead in a crop circle.\" Lady Beatrice says, \"No! Not Lloyd!\"\n\nAt Sir Christian's house, Lord Peter breaks in and slams the door. He looks around, goes to open the back door and gets shocked. (Alarm goes off). He reaches for the front door and gets shocked. (Alarm goes off). He sits in a chair. He looks at the photo of Lady Isabel and remembers when they were young. (Flashback: Sir Christian slashes his face). He sees someone riding off on a bike and throws a ball out the window to get their attention.\n\nDave Ripert comes in to talk to Sally. He says he's got \"ferry tickets for Holland tonight. I've done a deal for the silver with a guy in Amsterdam. Boat's at two.\" They will need to pack the stuff up beforehand. Dave will pick up Sally at nine.\n\nPlot Denouement[]\n\nSir Christian is driven home by the police. He sees Lord Peter's car outside of his house. He says, \"He had that car at Oxford, you know. 40-odd years ago.\" Sir Christian turns off the alarm. Inside, Lord Peter says, \"Hello, Sir Christian. God, I wouldn't have recognized you. Not even my scotch, Sir Christian, where's your loyalty?\" Barnaby asks if he sent Ronald Stokes to try and kill Sir Christian? Lord Peter asks what happened to him? Barnaby replies, \"Well, unlike you, he didn't survive Sir Christian's electrical defences.\" Lord Peter says, \"Good old Sir Christian. Always one step ahead. But you do look as though you could do with a large one of these.\" He pours a scotch and gives it to Sir Christian. They drink. Barnaby says, \"You do realise that you'll be charged with conspiracy to murder, don't you?\" Lord Peter says, \"It should never have happened. None of this. I should have let it go all those years ago, but I couldn't. I was too proud. Too jealous. Jamais vaincu, never defeated. That's the family motto, you know.\" Sir Christian says, \"Lady Isabel's been asking for you. She wants us to be friends. Before she dies.\" At the nursing home, Lord Peter holds Lady Isabel's hand. He remembers when she was young. He says, \"Isabel. It's Peter. I've come to ask you to forgive me.\" Lady Isabel's eyes open and then close. Lord Peter says, \"I'm truly sorry for everything I've done. Goodbye, Isabel.\"\n\nNatural Death: Sir Christian goes to sit on Lady Isabel's bed side. He kisses her hand.\n\nBarnaby says, \"Sir Christian, I don't want to intrude on your grief, but will you answer me one last question please? Did you kill Lloyd to shut him up?\" Sir Christian says, \"I've never killed anyone in my life.\" Lord Peter is escorted to a police car.\n\nAt The Chatwyn home, Lady Beatrice tells Barnaby, \"Lloyd seemed very unhappy about something... ..and he wanted to go away for a few days. I wasn't to tell a living soul.\" Barnaby says, \"In the circumstances don't you think that's a bit academic? You said that he was brought up here, on the farm, and that his father was the farm manager. Where did they live?\" Lady Beatrice says, \"It was our secret place. It was where we were happiest as children.\"\n\nAt Ivy Cottage, Dave Ripert and Sally Boulter put boxes in the trunk of a car. \"Two more and we're done.\" Barnaby says, \"You're thinking of opening an antique shop, are you Mr Ripert?\" Dave throws a box at Barnaby and gets in his car and races off. Barnaby says to Troy, \"The girl.\" Barnaby gets in his car and chases after Dave.\n\nThird Body: Dave messes with the radio. Next thing he runs into the combine harvester, which has just turned on its lights. Dave is lying on the hood of the car, covered in glass.\n\nReverend Ellis conducts the funeral for Lloyd. Lady Beatrice and Lucy put a flying saucer on top of his coffin.\n\nAt home, Barnaby shows Joyce a comic of an alien he was scared of when he was a kid. He says, \"Every night before I turned out the light I used to look under the bed to see if he was there to capture me and carry me off to God knows what galaxy on the other side of the universe.\" Barnaby says he will just bin the lot, but Joyce says no- they will fetch a fortune at the Causton Charity Shop.\n\nCast[]\n\nGalleries[]\n\nBody Count[]\n\nSupporting Cast[]\n\nEpisode Images[]\n\nArrests[]\n\nSir Harry Chatwyn for the murder of Steve Ramsey\n\nSir Peter Rhodes for sending men down to murder Sir Christian Aubrey who were then accidentally electrocuted by Sir Aubrey's security system.\n\nLloyd Kirby for tampering with victims of death and arranging the dead bodies in the middle of crop circles.\n\nDave Ripert for the murder of Lloyd Kirby; Theft/Burglary.\n\nThis is the 14th time a murderer has died before arrest.

Producers later revealed the explanation had been forgotten in editing.\n\nWhen Barnaby and Troy are testing the door handles and the telephone while trapped in the house, 2 things are not true to reality:\n\nAs they reach for the door handles, the electricity passing through their arms would have caused the retraction muscles in their forearms to cause their hands to close into a fist. But they do not.\n\nThe wiring in the telephone is too light to support a dangerous electric current and the phone is made out of plastic, which is an insulator. The person touching the phone would not receive a shock.\n\nVideos[]"
