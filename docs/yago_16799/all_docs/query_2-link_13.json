        "text": "Piyush Jha, director of Chalo America (2000), King of Bollywood (2004) and Sikander (2009) is also the writer of several crime novels Mumbaistan , Compass Box Killer and Anti-Social Network . His latest novel is the recently launched Raakshas, India’s No. 1 Serial Killer . “Serial killing is a kind of macabre art perfected by psychopaths, either on a pleasure trip or a trail of revenge. India has had a fair share of these criminals, too – Raman Raghav, Auto Shanker, The Stoneman, Beerman, The Pandher and Koli duo, The Joshi-Abhyankar Killers and Shobraj,” notes Piyush.\n\nIn Raakshas , Jha writes about a methodical killer, who he doesn’t name, till the end. “They are largely a nameless, faceless lot of criminals and most often, names are foisted on them by the public and the investigative agencies,” he says. At the end of his novel, Jha mentions the names of some lesser known serial killers – Amardeep Sada, Mohan Kumar (Cyanide Mohan), Umesh Reddy, Darbara Singh (the Baby Killer), Chandrakant Jha (the Body Parts Killer), Sadashiv Sahu (the Godhuli Killer), Devendra Sharma (the Taxi Killer) and Shankariya (the Hammer Man) all of whom have been equally menacing.\n\nHow has this influenced the writing of his novel? “I have been influenced to a small extent by the real serial killers of India.”"
