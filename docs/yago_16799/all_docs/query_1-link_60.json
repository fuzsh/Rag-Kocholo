        "text": "Mumbai v/s Ajmal Kasab, now a film on the real story behind 26/11! Writer of Ram Gopal Varmaâ€™s â€˜Sarkarâ€™ and director of 'The Stoneman Murders', Manish Gupta is all set to reveal the real motive behind 26/11 terror attacks on Mumbai through his forthcoming film â€˜Mumbai v/s Ajmal Kasabâ€™. The film which is yet to go on floors has been delayed due to budgeting issues. The casting is yet to be finalised. â€œMy film is a documentary-drama unlike the previous film â€˜Total 10â€™ which was made on Kasab. That was a â€˜Deshdrohiâ€™ kind of film. Just like Black Friday which revealed the real story behind the Mumbai bomb blasts and was based on a researched book by former crime reporter Hussain Zaidi, mine will be a film based on immense research. The script of the film is ready and is backed by credible proof. I know how sensitive the topic is and thus I have ensured that Kasab is not glamourised or sympathised with in my filmâ€ says Manish Gupta. Manish adds, â€œNo body really knows why 26/11 happened. Only a certain section of the press knows the real story. 26/11 was Pakistanâ€™s way of diverting USâ€™s attention from Lashkar-e-taiba and Taliban, terrorist groups which operate from Pak-Afghanistan border. It shows how youngsters for livelihood enrol themselves in Lashkar, get trained, are brainwashed and then become a full fledged terrorists. What exactly happened on 26/11 night will also be shown in the film. My film is through Kasabâ€™s eyes.â€ So will the current Kasab trial and verdict alter the script we ask? â€œNot really. My film is based on the 40 page court document where Kasab has confessed to various things, besides he keeps changing his statements. Inputs by journalist Kartikeya Tripati who has attended Kasabâ€™s all court hearings has also helped me in making this film. Iâ€™ve crosschecked the information I have received from various sources to ensure the film is as authentic as possible.â€ â€œOn a personal note, I want Kasab to get a life sentence instead of a death penalty as he should be tortured every day of his life and be made a living example of shame so that every budding terrorist knows his fateâ€, concludes Manish. ************************************************************************ Good Now very soon Kasab will get life sentence and become an actor and play Kasab in the movie... then gets pardoned and opens his own film company in India..... :hitler:\n\nKasab costing Maharashtra Rs 2 lakh per day; 35 crore spent so far MUMBAI: The cash-strapped Congress-led Democratic Front government in Maharashtra has been spending well over Rs 2 lakh a day on India's priciest prisoner — Ajmal Kasab — the lone surviving gunman in the worst-ever terror attack on the metropolis on November 26, 2008. \"We have no option but to spend such a huge amount for his security. Since Kasab was caught alive, we were able to take the most sensitive criminal case to its logical conclusion,\" a senior government official told TOI on Tuesday. Elaborating on the threat perception, the official said, \"Since the possibility of an attack on him isn't ruled out, a high level team of sleuths from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police has been deployed at the Arthur Road jail. In addition, more than half a dozen watch towers have been set up in the jail premises and neighbouring areas. ITBP guards have been deployed exclusively for Kasab's security.\" Additional police force has been provided for the watch towers and an adequate number of police constables have been deployed in and around the jail premises, the official added. So far, the government has spent Rs 35 crore on Kasab for creating special infrastructure for his security. \"Even the Centre insisted on setting up special infrastructure for protecting Kasab. Security measures taken by the state government were personally monitored by home minister P Chidambaram,\" he said. The official said a special high security cell was created to house Kasab in the Arthur Road jail. \"The special cell is so powerful that even if there is a direct attack, it will not be damaged. We've taken all possible precautions,\" he said. Other than the special cell, a special ward has been constructed at the government-run J J Hospital for Kasab's treatment. \"Kasab has a stomach ailment. Earlier, he was being treated at one of the government hospitals in the metropolis. But, it was felt that if ever a need arose to admit him to a hospital, full-proof arrangement should be made. Therefore, we constructed a special prison ward in the J J Hospital. It's also bullet-proof,\" he said. On Kasab's current health status, the official said that he is examined by a team of doctors at least once a day. \"Doctors examine him within the jail premises and treat him there itself. Once the judicial proceedings are over, the doctors will take a decision on the further course of medical treatment.\" ********************************************************************* Dont worry.... 1.5 lakhs of the 2 lakhs are going into Indian pockets only :winky:"
