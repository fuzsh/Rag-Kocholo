        "text": "\"Florida's Flooded Future\" by Patricia Turner\n\nIn the aptly named \"Women Take Issue\" exhibit, three female\n\nartists expressed their concerns about some of the issues facing\n\nour world today. The art of Patricia Turner, Beau Wild and Fran\n\nGardner confronted the viewer with societal woes as varied as world\n\nhunger, mass shootings, the resurgence of white supremacy and the\n\ntreatment of women. It was an incredibly powerful show.\n\nIn \"Florida's Flooded Future,\" Turner\n\nhighlights the effects of climate change, an issue that hits very\n\nclose to home. In January, Sarasota received a $10M grant from the\n\nState of Florida for infrastructure projects that include raising\n\nVan Wezel Way and improving the shoreline at Bay Park to protect\n\nagainst erosion and damage caused by increased flooding. Miami\n\nBeach recently announced plans to raise some of its streets by two\n\nfeet to counter rising seas. These are just two recent examples of\n\nmeasures state and local governments are taking to fight the\n\neffects of climate change.\n\nIn her piece, Turner has cleverly affixed two puzzles\n\ndepicting Florida to her hand-dyed fabric that brings to mind the\n\nwaters surrounding us. (If you can enlarge the images in this post,\n\nplease do!) Both puzzles are partially covered with netting that\n\nrepresents rising waters. When I asked Turner how she came up with\n\nthe idea of incorporating physical puzzles into the piece, she took\n\na moment to consider. \"Well,\" she said, \"Dealing\n\nwith climate change is a puzzle, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Empath\" by Fran Gardner\n\nIn Fran Gardner's artist statement, she talks about\n\nthe inspiration she finds in petroglyphs, architecture and\n\ngraffiti. \"Think about the caves of Lascaux, the pyramids and\n\nthe surfaces of train cars,\" she says. Her work, like the art\n\nforms referenced, \"speak to the human urge for mark leaving,\n\nreferring to that enduring historical record while becoming a part of it.\"\n\nIn \"Empath,\" viewers can clearly see what\n\nGardner means by this statement. Her mixed media piece is filled\n\nwith marks and writings and images that give the work an ancient\n\nand magical feel. Then there is the central figure, a woman\n\nbeautifully painted in a style that is simultaneously realistic and\n\nabstract. But why is she naked? Does it represent her\n\nvulnerability? And why is she in this position on the ground? Has\n\nher empathy caused her to become physically overwhelmed?\n\nDetail from \"Empath\" by Fran Gardner\n\nMost people look at a work of art for less than 30 seconds\n\nbefore moving on. (Hence the rise of the slow art movement.) But a\n\nviewer is rewarded for taking the time to really look at the detail\n\nin \"Empath.\" The writing below the figure provides the\n\nexplanation for her emotion. It reads, in part, \"in december\n\n2012 a gunman walked into Sandy Hook elementary school in New Town\n\nConnecticut and killed 20 children 6 adults and himself since then\n\nthere have been more than 1600 mass shootings...\" One of\n\nthose shootings was the 2018 murder of 17 people at Marjorie Stoneman\n\nDouglas, a high school in my sister's community of Parkland,\n\nFlorida.\n\n\"Women Take Issue\" was an exhibit that made\n\nme uncomfortable and upset and angry. It was a strong reminder of\n\nthe power of art. I suspect this is exactly what Turner hoped for\n\nwhen putting the show together.

Gamble\n\nWell before the word \"Covid\" became part of our daily vocabulary, Patricia Turner approached the Sidney & Berne Davis Art Center in Fort Myers about hosting an exhibit entitled \"Women Take Issue.\" The Center liked the idea. In fact, they liked it so much that they asked if she could curate exhibits for all three of the Center's gallery spaces. Never one to turn down a challenge, she agreed.\n\nPatricia's vision included one gallery focused on art celebrating the 100th anniversary of women winning the right to vote. (The original exhibit was scheduled for 2020 after all.) When the shows were postponed to February 2022 due to Covid, Turner embraced the nexus with Black History Month. She pivoted to a selection from the HERstory Quilts collection celebrating strong African-American women. What a show!\n\nWhen I entered the room, I was surrounded by images of both women with whom I was familiar and women to whom I was being introduced for the first time. There was Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth and Ruby Bridges and Barbara Jordan. And of course no such exhibit would be complete without a depiction of Rosa Parks. I loved artist Nneka Gamble's inclusion of an \"EQUAL\" sign in place of arrest information in Parks' mug shot.\n\n\"Nina: A Theme with Variations\"\n\nby Sherri Culver\n\nAnother portrait featured Nina Simone, the self-described \"freedom singer\" who originally trained -- at Julliard no less -- to be a classical pianist. The depiction had as much energy in it as Simone herself.\n\nSimone might be best known for \"Mississippi Goddam,\" a song that became a Civil Rights anthem. The song was an outpouring of anger and grief about the racially motivated murders of Emmett Till and Medgar Evers. She is said to have written it in a single hour.\n\nNot surprisingly, \"Mississippi Goddam\" was banned in several Southern states at the time of its release. (I'm sure DeSantis would like to ban it today.) Hundreds of copies of the record that had been sent to radio stations and record stores were broken in half and returned.\n\nBut every coin (and record) has two sides. \"Mississippi Goddam\" was a rallying cry to those fighting against racism. Simone performed the song in front of a crowd of 10,000 people at the end of the marches from Selma to Montgomery. In 2019 the song was chosen by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\" To watch Simone sing her anthem, click here.\n\n\"Nichelle Nichols: The Next Generation\"\n\nby Joanne S. Best\n\nI was never a Trekkie (I know, big surprise) so I had no idea who Nichelle Nichols was when I came upon this quilt. A careful look, though, reveals that she's making the Vulcan salute in one of the images. A clue!\n\nEach wall card for the exhibit included detailed information about why the artist chose to depict her subject. After explaining that Nichols' involvement with \"Star Trek\" was intended to \"add a little color to the bridge,\" Joanne S. Best wrote (in part): \"Many taboo subjects got past the censors by being staged on other worlds, not the least of which was the first televised interracial kiss. Nichols has continued to support girls entering the sciences and has been an asset in recruiting minority and female personnel into NASA...including Sally Ride, Mae Jemison and Charles Bolden.\"\n\nIn addition to the wall cards, viewers were invited to make a call to hear more from the artist about her work. If you have a couple of minutes, call 703-520-6404 ext. 1467 for some insight from Best. There is a lot of intention behind each component of her work, including the X's and O's that commemorate that groundbreaking kiss.\n\n\"Liberte de l'air\" by Ricki S. Selva\n\nI'll leave you with a portrait of Bessie Coleman, a groundbreaking stunt pilot. It was a long way from the cotton fields of Texas where Coleman was raised to Le Crotoy, France where she received her flight training. (In the U.S., Coleman's identity as a Black woman gave flight schools two reasons to reject her.) At the age of 29, she obtained her international pilot's license and came back to the United States to show off her stuff.\n\nColeman (who became known as \"Queen Bess\") appeared at air shows performing tricks like loop-the-loops. The mere thought of it makes me nauseous. She also spoke at churches, schools and theaters about attaining her dream (with video that surely impressed her audiences). While Coleman needed the money from these engagements to finance her career, she would only speak at venues that permitted mixed race audiences.\n\nColeman's final flight was a test run with her mechanic at the controls. She was 34 years old. A stray wrench became stuck in the engine, and the plane flipped over. Coleman was not wearing a seat belt and fell 3,000 feet to her death. The mechanic crashed the plane and also died. It was a dramatic ending to the life of a woman who truly lived her dream.\n\nEach quilt in the exhibit was wonderful, and I wanted more. Happily, there's a book! The quilts shown here are just four of the 108 mixed media fiber art works included in \"HERstoryQuilts: A Celebration of Strong Women.\" The book was put together by Susanne Miller Jones, who also curated the exhibit. I am looking forward to receiving my copy.\n\nHere's to inspiring women everywhere!"
