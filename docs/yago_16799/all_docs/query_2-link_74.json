        "text": "UPDATED 2/16/18\n\nA second member of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School marching band has been identified as a victim in Wednesday's school shooting in Parkland, Florida: Alex Schachter, 14, was a freshman baritone player in the marching band.\n\nBoth Schachter and Gina Montalto, a 14-year-old freshman who also competed for the FMBC 5A state champion Eagle Regiment band, were among the 17 people who were killed by the shooter. The suspect has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder after attempting to escape in a fleeing crowd of students and being caught nearby by police.\n\nSchachter also played the trombone in the school's orchestra program.\n\n“The improvement I witnessed from him was admirable and inspiring,” Alexander Kaminsky, director of bands, told the Sun Sentinel. “I felt he really had a bright future on the trombone.”\n\nDuring the shooting, students and teachers locked themselves in classrooms, including the wind symphony class taking place in the Stoneman Douglas band room. Band director Alex Kaminsky shared that the wind symphony students were safely evacuated following the lockdown.\n\nThe marching arts community learned of Montalto's passing on Wednesday night through the circulation of a Facebook post by color guard choreographer/designer Andy Mroczek."
