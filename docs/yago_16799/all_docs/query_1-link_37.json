        "text": "Hi Bobby\n\nThanks for recommending this one.\n\nAfter a long time I have seen a honest attempt to make a true suspense movie. Exactly this is what I expected from Talaash. KK\\'s role easily would have been a blessing for worn out Khans, Kumars and wannabees.\n\nWhat I liked about this movie is that there are absolutely no attempts to compromise on the story line to stretch the movie. Absence of songs and forced item numbers makes it even more watchable. KK is once again in his full form.\n\nBeing a avid reader of Surender Mohan Pathak mystery novels I can\\'t overlook the fact that how the protagonist explains and solves the mystery. The style and feel is 99% close to the Suneel Series investigation stories written by the great SM Pathak Saab.\n\nIt is very difficult to make a satisfying suspense investigation thriller. Rahasya does it almost pretty well but course there are a few loop holes and unconvincing explanations which failed to impress me as well as mentioned in your review.\n\nFor some reason this movie reminded me of a Raaj Kumar starrer CBI investigation thriller Police Public which I watched during the late 80s. Do you feel the same?\n\nThanks once gain for recommending this.\n\n- Abel\n\nHi Abel Desai,\n\nGreat to know that you loved the film too and the pleasure was really mine in recommending it to all like-minded friends of BTC.\n\nAnd yes it does remind you of those Surender Mohan Pathak mystery novels for sure.\n\nAnd regarding POLICE PUBLIC, I still recall the film and Raj Kumar with his unique persona and the girl falling from the top.\n\nBut since all investigative thrillers actually follow the same format so one might feel the similarities.\n\nHowever I would love to watch the film again too.\n\nCheers!"
