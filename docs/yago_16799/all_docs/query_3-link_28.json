        "text": "STORY – 1\n\nDIRECTOR – 1\n\nACTOR – 1\n\nMUSIC – 1\n\nCULT – 1\n\nVERDICT – 5/5\n\nPROS –\n\n1) This season we learn that the actual identity of murderer is still not known to audiences and the plot reveals that everyone got some history with the murder victim.\n\n2) Adah Sharma as Rosie highlights this season. Her scene when she caughts maid Kamini was one of the best written scene.\n\n3) Annapurna Soni as Kamini is another talent to look for.\n\n4) The cliffhanger climax reveals that Sonu’s real name is Shashwat Lamba. Hope season 3 won’t come after a gap of 3 years.\n\nCONS –\n\nN/A\n\nQUOTE –\n\nIns. Tambe: ye ek number ka chutiya hai ya bahot bada genius.\n\nIns Digendra: har chutiya genius ho sakta hai, aur har genius … chutiya, abhi dekhna hai hum logon ki ginti kahan hone wali hai.\n\nSTORY – 1\n\nDIRECTOR – 1\n\nACTOR – 1\n\nMUSIC – 1\n\nCULT – 1\n\nVERDICT – 5/5\n\nPROS –\n\n1) A young police officer with an OCD of taking revenge decides to takes revenge for a humiliating incident from his senior officer by tarnishing his image. He takes tips from a veteran thief and starts night robbery which ultimately leads to the suspension of his senior. The plot takes a turn when one of his victim allegedly commits suicide.\n\n2) The first half is exceptional. Nail biting thriller.\n\n3) Jeethu Joseph scenic village set-up works like a charm.\n\n4) Main BGM theme.\n\n5) Maniyan, the veteran thief. Fascinating character.\n\nCONS –\n\n1) The third act fails the movie. The entire “tantric serial killer” twist is incoherent with the main plot.\n\n2) A climax similar to The Stoneman Murders (2009).\n\nQUOTE –\n\n“Theft is an intoxication that women or alcohol cannot give. Once you taste it, you must get caught for the intoxication to subside.”\n\nSTORY – 1\n\nDIRECTOR – 1\n\nACTOR – 1\n\nMUSIC – 1\n\nCULT – 0\n\nVERDICT – 4/5\n\nPROS –\n\n1) A veteran cop investigating the murder of a young real estate agent discovers that the murder is deeply linked to drugs, money laundering, and also the police department.\n\n2) Benicio del Toro as the hardened detective is absolutely brilliant. Good old cop-drama thriller without any silly sub-plots.\n\n3) Yair Elazar Glotman soundtrack is a revelation. He’s giving Hans Zimmer a run for his money.\n\n4) The screenplay is tight and gripping to the last minute. An impressive debut for director Grant Singer.\n\nCONS –\n\nN/A\n\nQUOTE –\n\nTom: How far would you go?\n\nPeter: Excuse me?\n\nTom: No, are you willing to die for it?\n\nPeter: I… I don’t know what we’re talking about here, Tom.\n\nTom: You don’t know what the fuck I’m talking about?\n\nPeter: No. Absolutely no idea.\n\nTom: Holy shit. You’re fucking cute. I’m warning you, man. Don’t let me fucking catch you.\n\nSTORY – 0\n\nDIRECTOR – 0\n\nACTOR – 0\n\nMUSIC – 0\n\nCULT – 0\n\nVERDICT – 0/5\n\nPROS –\n\n1) The detective couple while attend the wedding of Vikram “The Maharajah” on his private island, gets involved in another case when the groom is kidnapped.\n\n2) A one time watch comedy with only a few funny moments.\n\nCONS –\n\n1) Lazy plot, lazy execution.\n\nQUOTE –\n\nMiller: You’ve done hostage negotiation?\n\nNick: I’m married to this lady. Everything’s a negotiation.\n\nSTORY – 1\n\nDIRECTOR – 1\n\nACTOR – 1\n\nMUSIC – 0\n\nCULT – 0\n\nVERDICT – 3/5\n\nPROS –\n\n1) Daniel Craig reprising his role as master detective Benoit Blanc as he takes on a new case revolving around a tech billionaire on his private island in Greece.\n\nCONS –\n\n1) A fun one-time watch murder-mystery.\n\nQUOTE –\n\nBenoit Blanc: His dock doesn’t float. His wonder fuel is a disaster. His grasp of disruption theory is remedial at best. He didn’t design the puzzle boxes. He didn’t write the mystery. Et voila! It all adds up. The key to this entire case. And it was staring me right in the face. Like everyone in the world, I assumed Miles Bron was a complicated genius. But why? Look into the clear centre of this glass onion. Miles Bron is an idiot!\n\nMiles Bron: Oh, please, just tell us who tried to kill me.\n\nBenoit Blanc: Nobody tried to kill you, you vainglorious buffoon!\n\nSTORY – 1\n\nDIRECTOR – 1\n\nMUSIC – 0\n\nCULT – 1\n\nVERDICT – 3/4\n\nPROS –\n\n1) A man is found murdered in his home. His wife and friend appear as prime suspects. The plot-twist is the man faked his own death to avoid revenge from an old gang called VV341 which he betrayed in America 15 years ago.\n\n2) Peter O’Toole as Sherlock Holmes\n\n3) An animated movie rightly captured the essence of a Sherlock Holmes mystery.\n\nCONS –\n\nN/A\n\nQUOTE –\n\nWatson: And what is this further matter?\n\nHolmes: Whatever happened to this missing dumb-bell.\n\nSTORY – 1\n\nDIRECTOR – 1\n\nACTOR – 1\n\nMUSIC – 0\n\nCULT – 0\n\nVERDICT – 3/5\n\nPROS –\n\n1) Three unrelated people in different parts of London got murdered in a similar manner where the corpse was left surrounded by smashed china.\n\n2) A gripping adaptation of “The Adventure of the Six Napoleons“.\n\n3) Evelyn Ankers as Naomi Drake – the femme fatale.\n\n4) Rondo Hatton as The mysterious giant Creeper.\n\nCONS –\n\nN/A\n\nQUOTE –\n\nDr. John H. Watson: Amazing. And the Borgia Pearl’s inside that?\n\nSherlock Holmes: If it isn’t, I shall retire to Sussex and keep bees.\n\nSTORY – 1\n\nDIRECTOR – 0\n\nACTOR – 0\n\nMUSIC – 0\n\nCULT – 0\n\nVERDICT – 1/5\n\nPROS –\n\n1) A Duke in order to hide his affair, creates the myth of Jack the Ripper along with his fellow Freemasons, and starts a rampage of murders of any known acquaintance of his secret lover.\n\nCONS –\n\n1) The screenplay is boring and dull\n\n2) James Mason as Dr. John Watson looks too old for the role.\n\n3) The final 15-minutes where Holmes gives a drag monologue kills the movie.\n\nQUOTE –\n\nWatson: Holmes, what he said about the government being involved, that can’t be.\n\nHolmes: I’m afraid it is.\n\nWatson: How high up?\n\nHolmes: Perhaps to the throne.\n\nSTORY – 1\n\nDIRECTOR – 1\n\nACTOR – 1\n\nMUSIC – 0\n\nCULT – 1\n\nVERDICT – 4/5\n\nPROS –\n\n1) A cop suspended for judicial killing ran a parallel investigation on a serial killer in 1980s Mumbai who is killing its victims by smashing their heads with stones.\n\n2) A solid thriller with a twist ending.\n\n3) Manish Gupta’s direction is gripping. Being the writer also, he picked an intriguing piece of history for the plot.\n\nCONS –\n\n1) Sloppy editing.\n\n2) Arbaaz Khan is hardly there. His character is poorly developed and executed.\n\nQUOTE –\n\n“ye hatyaein nahin, bali hai”"
