        "text": "On talking about challenges of making films on such realistic subjects which comes with a lot of responsibility in terms of research he said, \"While writing and directing a realistic courtroom drama, the research needs to be very thorough, the dialogues need to be written very meticulously and the production design needs to be very precise. Many writers and directors do not take the pains to visit actual courtrooms to study how a courtroom actually functions. Meticulous detailing of court procedures, dialogues and production design will be evident to viewers in my film 420 IPC. Writing comes very naturally to me because I approach it as an organic process. Once my research is complete, the script flows on its own.\n\nSharing about casting Ranvir Shorey and Vinay Pathak and others he revealed, \"In 420 IPC, Vinay’s character was that of an urban CA whose morality is ambiguous and whose demeanour is amusing. I could not think of anyone apart from Vinay Pathak to play this role. Ranvir Shorey and I were friends in college. We met after 28 years at the Filmfare awards night 2020 where I was nominated for best screenplay for Section 375 and Ranvir was nominated for best supporting actor for Sonchiriya. I spoke to him about 420 IPC, soon he read the script and instantly said a yes. I liked Gul Panag’s work in a recent web series, so I got in touch with her. Being a law student, she appreciated the intricate detailing of legal procedures in my script. I cast Rohan because the character was that of a 28-year old, urban, English-spouting lawyer. Rohan has an inherent sophistication in his demeanour. He was the apt choice for this role.\""
