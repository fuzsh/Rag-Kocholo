Manish Gupta, who last made the critically acclaimed Rahasya, reportedly based on the Aarushi murder case, has been trying really hard to bring another film on the floors. The film, christened Rahasya 2, is based on the sensational Sheena Bora murder case that has her mother Indrani Mukerjea as the primary accused.

Manish, who had been a protégé of Ram Gopal Verma, had first approached Viacom with the film. The production house, which had initially shown interest, however, later developed cold feet and backed out. The director, not losing hope, then approached Eros, but even they rejected his proposal.

However, the The Stoneman Murders director, who had written Sarkar and D for RGV, is still positive. But strangely enough, no production house wants to take up the scandalous project.

Rahasya had starred Kay Kay Menon, Tisca Chopra and Ashish Vidyarthi in the lead roles. Meghna Gulzar had also made a film based on the Aarushi murder case, titled Talvar, starring Irrfan Khan, Neeraj Kabi and Konkona Sen Sharma in the lead roles.

It remains to be seen if Rahasya 2 gets greenlit and Manish is able to emulate the critical acclaim of the first instalment.
