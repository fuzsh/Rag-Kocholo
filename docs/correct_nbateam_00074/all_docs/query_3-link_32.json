        "text": "OAKLAND – All he needed to do was look at the walls of the Warriors practice facility.\n\nThen, Mike Dunleavy Jr. could admire the Warriors’ three NBA championship banners they won in the past four years. He could see the Warriors’ four All-Stars in Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. He could reflect on how that drastically differed from his five-year stint with the Warriors (2002-07).\n\n“We weren’t very good,” Dunleavy said following practice on Wednesday with both a laugh and obvious understatement. “It’s ironic just to see how things have changed here.”\n\nThose changes have become well documented as the Warriors have collected championship hardware, acquired and developed a flush of All-Star talent and sparked envy and charges that they have ruined the NBA. Here is another change: in their never-ending quest to remain excellent, the Warriors hired Dunleavy as a pro scout for the 2018-19 season. Dunleavy, who lives in New York with his wife and three children, will mostly scout Eastern Conference teams that play primarily in New York, Brooklyn, Boston and Philadelphia.\n\n“We’ve been a little short in pro scouting. Pro scouting is someone that sees NBA games in person,” Warriors general manager Bob Myers said. “It may seem like I see a lot of NBA, but I may only see an Eastern Conference team once when we play them here at home. That’s not enough to truly evaluate the player in a trade.”\n\nDunleavy said Myers “always kept in contact” ever since the former agent once represented Dunleavy during most of his 15-year NBA career that ended after the Atlanta Hawks waived him following the 2016-17 season. So over the past year, Myers spoke with Dunleavy about joining their front office. Though the Warriors lean on advance scout Scott Vaughan to evaluate opponents leading up to a game, the Warriors will have Dunleavy scout players the Warriors may acquire in trades or free agency.\n\n“We found a little role for me,” Dunleavy said. “It’s the appropriate amount of workload I’m looking for right now. Good thing to get my feet wet and start learning some stuff.”\n\nDunleavy does not exactly need a history lesson on the Warriors.\n\nWant real-time Warriors news texted to your phone?

But the Warriors might mostly remember Dunleavy for something less glorious. After the Warriors selected Dunleavy at No. 3 in the 2002 NBA draft, he averaged a combined 10.6 points per game on 43.2 percent shooting through five seasons. That coincided with the Warriors finishing with a combined 164-246 record and one winning season on the 2006-07 “We Believe” team (42-40).\n\nWant real-time Warriors news texted to your phone?

I was probably too oriented and interested in getting the team to be better and playing better with my teammates. I should’ve been more aggressive. I should’ve taken more shots and launch.”\n\nInstead, Dunleavy averaged modest numbers his rookie season (5.7 points on 40.3 percent shooting). After Dunleavy showed some steady improvement in 2003-04 (11.7 points on 44.9 percent shooting), the Warriors signed him to a five-year, $44 million extension. But he spent his last two seasons with the Warriors struggling to retain his starting position. The Warriors then traded him to Indiana with Troy Murphy, Ike Diogu and Keith McLeod for Stephen Jackson, Al Harrington, Sarunas Jasikevicius and Josh Powell.\n\n“I played 15 years in the NBA. I had a great time and enjoyed it,” said Dunleavy, who also had stints in Indiana (2006-2011), Milwaukee (2011-2013), Chicago (2013-2016), Cleveland (2016-17) and Atlanta (2017). “I couldn’t be happier. I wish I won a ring. But that didn’t work out. That was a fun ride.”\n\nThat fun ride with the Warriors included what Dunleavy called “a lot of interesting stories, for better and for worse.” What was Dunleavy’s most interesting story? He chuckled, paused for a few seconds and smiled. Dunleavy then reflected on his third NBA season coinciding with the Warriors hiring Mike Montgomery, a longtime college basketball coach. On the first day of practice, former Warriors forward Eduardo Najera attempted layoffs off the shot clock above the basket. Dunleavy then observed Montgomery going ballistic.\n\n“Eddy was a great guy and fun teammate,” Dunleavy said, shaking his head. “But it summed up how things were going right now for the team and organization.”\n\nAnd now? The Warriors have five NBA All-Stars after acquiring DeMarcus Cousins last summer at the taxpayer midlevel exception ($5.3 million). They are set to move next season to Mission Bay to play at Chase Center, the Warriors’ privately financed arena budgeted for $1 billion. To think, Dunleavy only considered the Warriors longtime director of team operations Eric Housen and team spokesman Raymond Ridder as the team’s only sources of excellence and stability.\n\n“Ironically, those are the two things that have stayed. Everything else has changed,” Dunleavy said. “Everything else has taken off. They have some really good players in here finally and a great coach. The ownership on down has done an amazing job.”\n\nYet, the Warriors hardly seem satisfied. Durant and Thompson will become unrestricted free agents next summer. Green will be an unrestricted free agent in 2020. And as much as the Warriors expressed confidence they can retain all of their All-Stars, they also have contingency plans.\n\nTo help with that process, the Warriors hired a former player and father of a former longtime NBA coach and executive (Mike Dunleavy Sr.).\n\n“That’s going to be really helpful for us,” Kerr said of Dunleavy’s presence. “He’s also a great guy and cool person, fun to be around and good to have in your building.”\n\nThis time, the Warriors’ building seems much different to Dunleavy even if it technically still looks the same."
