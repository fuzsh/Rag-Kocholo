        "text": "Rocky Widner/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nGolden State Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. says Stephen Curry can get \"whatever he wants\" on his next contract.\n\n\"All that stuff will get figured out, and I think Steph will be—I'd say, pretty confident he'll be a Warrior for life,\" Dunleavy said (h/t The Athletic's Anthony Slater).\n\nCurry is eligible to sign a one-year extension this summer. He is currently signed through the 2025-26 season, after which he is slated to become an unrestricted free agent.\n\nThe Warriors star is set to earn a salary of $55.7 million next season, with that total projected to rise to $59.6 million in 2025-26, per Spotrac.\n\nCurry could ink an extension for one year and $62.6 million this summer to keep him with the team through the 2026-27 campaign. If he waits until next offseason, however, he will be eligible for a two-year, $130 million extension (h/t ESPN's Bobby Marks).\n\nWaiting until next summer could allow Curry to assess the direction of his team. The Warriors have some work to do to return to title contention after missing out on the playoffs altogether last season.\n\nWhen inking Curry to his last four-year, $215 million extension in 2021, former Warriors general manager Bob Myers said the contract was made \"with the vision of (Curry) playing his entire career with our franchise.\"\n\nCurry shared a similar sentiment earlier this week when he told Yahoo Sports' Vincent Goodwill that he \"can clearly say I want to be a Warrior for life.\"\n\nThe Warriors star went on to add: \"I always want to win, plain and simple. There's no contentment on just cashing a check and playing basketball and riding it out. Pressure is applied on like, I want to win, and I want to be in the best position to make that happen.\n\n\"Doesn't guarantee anything, but until that changes, and I feel that energy changes, I go about my business the same way.\"\n\nIt may take more than a maximum contract to keep Curry in the Bay Area if he doesn't think the Warriors can compete for a title in the near future. Dunleavy and Golden State will hope offseason additions Kyle Anderson, Buddy Hield and De'Anthony Melton can help encourage Curry to finish out his career with the franchise by helping Golden State return to the playoffs next spring."
