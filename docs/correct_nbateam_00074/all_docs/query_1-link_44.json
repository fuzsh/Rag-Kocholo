        "text": "It’s been a long time since Mike Dunleavy Jr. played for the Golden State Warriors. After being drafted third overall in the 2002 NBA Draft by the Warriors, Dunleavy spent four and a half years in Oakland. But during those years, the team struggled to find any semblance of success.\n\nNow, less than two years removed from retiring as a player, and more than a decade removed from his stint with the Dubs, Dunleavy has returned to the Warriors organization. Only this time, it’s in the front office, as he’ll be joining the team as a pro scout.\n\nSince Dunleavy’s departure, the team has changed owners, changed general managers, and changed coaches, over and over. Most importantly, they’ve changed players, and are now full of stars.\n\nAt Wednesday’s practice, Dunleavy met with the media, and joked about how the once-futile organization that drafted him hasn’t changed much.\n\n“It’s just funny walking in here the other day, and not much has changed since I got drafted. You come up the stairs and all of the stuff is the same, except there are three things up there that are new,” Dunleavy said, while laughing and pointing at the championship banners adorning the walls of the Warriors’ practice center. Furthermore, he had some great fun anecdotes about his former agent and current boss, GM Bob Myers.\n\nDunleavy also told some stories about his time as a player for the Warriors, including when Mike Montgomery took over as coach and had some surprises about the state of the team."
