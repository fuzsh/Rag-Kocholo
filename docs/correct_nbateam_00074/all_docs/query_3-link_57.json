        "text": "In a pregame media availability on Friday, Cheryl Miller ripped the league’s record new broadcast rights package and the negotiators who put it together. Miller called for a number four-times higher than the reported $2.2 billion over 11 years that the WNBA reportedly will receive starting in 2025. The new deal could be as much as six-times higher than the current deal struck in 2016. “I’m not great with numbers,” Miller told reporters in Phoenix. “That’s a lowball.”\n\nIn the USC legend and longtime basketball voice’s view, the NBA and its broadcast partners undervalued the WNBA in negotiations. “We certainly have come a long way, and I’m not about gauging, but it’s a long time overdue,” Miller said. “Women’s basketball is in a great place right now.” The NBA negotiated the new deals on behalf of the WNBA, as they have with each package since the women’s league was created nearly three decades ago.\n\nJake Fischer: “There was discussions of Russell Westbrook being the outgoing piece in whatever sign-and-trade machinations do come about, and then the Jazz would have waived him. That conversation was happening like day two of free agency, so don’t know what the exact holdups are to be honest. I haven’t really checked too much, but that’s just, you know, something that’s out there. If the Nuggets don’t end up being able to get Westbrook, there’s still plenty of interesting point guards available in the market, most notably Tyus Jones. I think he’s looking for much more than what Denver will be able to provide, and you’ve got some interesting potential minimum guys like Spencer Dinwiddie, Dennis Smith Jr… I mean Markelle Fultz is still out there, so I’m not saying that I know of any potential connections there between those guys and Denver, I’m just saying the backup point guard market still seems to be quite rich in terms of optionality, so I if I was a Nuggets fan I would be feeling decent about it.”\n\nThe Golden State Warriors head coach was asked about the ice-hockey rotation he has experienced in USA Basketball’s friendly games before London, and then Paris. “We’ll see if we do it, but I like what I see so far defense, defense, defense”, he first began. “If we can bring in fresh troops five minutes later, keep doing that, and keep defending teams the way we’ve done at times, then I like our chances to win. We’re gonna score, we have guys who can score. It has to be about defense. Whatever gives us the best chance to defend our opponents, that’s what we’re gonna do”, he obviously added."
