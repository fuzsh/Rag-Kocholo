        "text": "It was announced this week that the Golden State Warriors had begun the process of moving their front office operation from Oakland and Oracle Arena to San Francisco and Chase Center. Amidst the move, the franchise is making personnel changes to the front office, starting with some key promotions.\n\nGeneral manager Bob Myers has excelled at one of the toughest jobs in the Warriors organization and now he has some help from Mike Dunleavy, Jr., who was promoted to assistant general manager.\n\nDunleavy, Jr. played 15 seasons in the NBA before retiring in 2017 and starting his second NBA career in the Warriors front office. Last year, Dunleavy, Jr., the son of retired head coach Mike Dunleavy Sr., explained his desire to stay in the game past his playing days:\n\nAs I was winding down my career, I knew I wanted to stay in the game. I knew I didn’t want to do media. Everybody always asks me if I want to coach, expecting me to say yes because my dad coaches, my brother coaches. I just always had more of an interest in this side of it, the front-office side.\n\nFor me, it’s not much of a change from just watching games. I’m always evaluating, whether it’s opponents or rookies. So it’s somewhat natural for me.\n\nIf his success with the team continues, Dunleavy could retire in Golden State, where his NBA career began.\n\nDunleavy, Jr. played for Golden State from 2002-07 before becoming a bit of a journeyman and lacing up for the Indiana Pacers for five seasons, the Milwaukee Bucks for two and Chicago Bulls for two.\n\nDunleavy’s 2016-17 final season was split between the Atlanta Hawks and the Cleveland Cavaliers."
