        "text": "The Golden State Warriors announced on Friday that Mike Dunleavy, Jr. has been promoted to general manager.\n\nDunleavy previously served as the Warriorsâ€™ vice president of basketball operations for the past two years and as assistant general manager before that.\n\nHe played in the NBA for 15 years, with a four-year stint for the Warriors from 2002 to 2007. Dunleavy was drafted by the Warriors as the third overall pick in the 2002 NBA Draft after a three-year college basketball career with Duke University.\n\nThe announcement comes after Bob Myers, the former president and general manager who was the architect of four NBA championships, stepped down last month.\n\nMyers hired Dunleavy as a scout in 2018.\n\nDunleavy's name quickly surfaced as a potential candidate after Myers' resignation."
