        "text": "Matt Williams\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nOverview: A heady small forward who has started to show how good he can be in the right setting. Has great size for the perimeter. Doesnt have great physical strength. Possesses below average athleticism for his position. Doesnt compensate with toughness. Shows a great feel for the game. Can work on and off the ball offensively. Able to initiate the offense. Shoots the ball well from the perimeter. Developed good fundamentals at Duke, where he was part of the team that won the NCAA Championship in 2001. Needed a few seasons to come around in the NBA. One of the most fundamentally sound players in the game today. Son of Los Angeles Clippers Head Coach Mike Dunleavy.\n\nOffense: A crafty, versatile offensive player who has really come into his own. Has a high basketball IQ and supreme size at his position. Gets one quarter of his offense as a spot up shooter and another quarter in transition. Does most of his damage as a jump shooter. Has a very fundamental stroke and shows great footwork out on the perimeter. Great catch and shoot player. Very good from beyond the arc. Shows great consistency off the dribble. Likes to pull up when driving right. Not a very good finisher at the rim. Lacks the strength to lay the ball in with contact. Gets to the line at a decent rate. Shoots a very respectable percentage. Great ball handler and passer for his size. Will drive and dish periodically. Will get a little bit too aggressive with his dribble sometimes. Isnt strong enough to recover the ball when he loses it. Very nice offensive option.\n\nDefense: A heady defensive player who doesnt have the physical assets to be a standout, but is big and smart enough to get by. Displays good help side fundamentals. Reads ball handlers extremely well when he is playing off the ball. Will make an effort to use his length to deny penetration, but he is susceptible to both quicker and stronger players. Wont leak out in transition. Does his best to help with rebounding duties. Very disciplined defender. Not dynamic, but wont make many mistakes either."
