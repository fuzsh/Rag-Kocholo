        "text": "Some Indiana basketball fans — Pacers and Hoosiers alike — were a bit miffed the Pacers passed on IU star Trayce Jackson-Davis not once, but twice in the second round of Thursday's NBA draft.\n\nThe Pacers selected Mojave King of G League Ignite at No. 47 and Miami's Isaiah Wong at No. 55, while the former Center Grove star and Hoosiers All-American fell all the way to the second-to-last pick in the draft, going No. 57 to the Golden State Warriors.\n\nOn Friday morning, Pacers general manager Chad Buchanan joined 107.5 The Fan's \"Kevin and Query\" show to discuss the draft, and was asked about the team's decision to pass on the 2019 IndyStar Mr. Basketball.\n\n“I mean, we love Trayce Jackson-Davis as a player,\" Buchanan said. \"And sometimes it has got to be a mutual interest. You don’t want to have a player with you that is not coming in wanting to be there. You know, Trayce is going to be a terrific player, like I said, we were big fans. Obviously, our roster and what he is at the position he plays wasn’t a great fit, and we understood that, his representatives understood that. But if we would have been in a situation where we didn’t have four players at his position, I think Trayce would have been a good option for us, and like I said, we were big fans of his game.”\n\nInsider: Despite Jackson-Davis' slide, it's hard to imagine better fit than Golden State\n\nInsider: Pacers didn't grab the spotlight in NBA draft as expected but they did get better\n\nHost Jake Query asked a follow up: \"Then was there discussion, I would assume from that, from Trayce Jackson-Davis or his camp that he would have been happier elsewhere and that he didn’t feel Indiana was a fit for him?\"\n\n“I think that’s accurate to say,” Buchanan responded.\n\nThe Pacers' frontcourt already includes Myles Turner, Isaiah Jackson, Jalen Smith and Daniel Theis. Meanwhile, the Warriors seem to be a good spot for Jackson-Davis. New Golden State general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. (a former Pacer) said TJD was \"another guy we had high on the board. We're surprised we got him that far.\"\n\nDunleavy Jr. also said the plan is to keep Jackson-Davis on the team's 15-man roster. \"He'll be there. He'll be on the regular, call it, 15-man roster,\" Dunleavy told reporters in a post-draft news conference. \"Not sure we'll carry 15, but he'll be on the main roster. And, you know, we're not overly loaded in the frontcourt — we've got (Kevon) Looney, hopefully we get Draymond (Green) back — but here's a guy that will provide us insurance, and hopefully he'll be able to grow within our program.\"\n\nDoyel: Pacers won't get off mediocrity treadmill with nickel-and-dime moves from draft\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the draft, Jackson-Davis and the Warriors seem like a great fit.\n\n\"Just the way that they play, obviously they’re a team with a bunch of shooters and I think that’s where I excel — playing (in) one on one coverage, so I got to make the most out of my opportunity,\" Jackson-Davis told IndyStar. \"Obviously, I pass the ball at a very high level coming in. Hopefully, backing up Kevon Looney and just earning my minutes and doing what I do best. And so I just got to make the most of my opportunity there, learn from a hall-of-fame coach and so that’s what I’m gonna do.”"
