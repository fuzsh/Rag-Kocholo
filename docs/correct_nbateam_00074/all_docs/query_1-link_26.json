        "text": "The Warriors and team executive Mike Dunleavy Jr. have agreed to terms to make Dunleavy the team’s new general manager, the team announced Friday. Here’s what you need to know:\n\nDunleavy has been with Golden State as an executive since 2018, starting as a scout and rising to assistant general manager and, most recently, vice president of basketball operations.\n\nDunleavy replaces Bob Myers, who announced in May he was stepping away from the franchise he helped build into a four-time champion.\n\nDunleavy had a 15-year playing career in the NBA, playing in Golden State his first four-plus seasons.\n\nThe Athletic’s instant analysis:\n\nWhat does this mean for the Warriors?\n\nThey opted for an internal promotion and, in some ways, the status quo for a front office that had been preparing for a Myers departure and running in a pretty self-sustained way under him. Dunleavy joined the Warriors five years ago, ascended from pro scout to assistant GM quickly and had been filling in essentially as a co-GM under Myers for more than a year now, attending league meetings in his place and joining the team on the road for many trips as the senior member of the front office.\n\nMyers’ voice will be missed, but the organization knows how Dunleavy operates and is comfortable with it. — Slater\n\nWhy is this timing important?\n\nA massive offseason sits ahead in the coming days. Dunleavy will officially be introduced at a news conference Monday. The draft is Thursday. Free agency is the following week. The Warriors have a whole lot of crucial decisions coming.\n\nThey are attempting to work out a reasonable long-term deal with Draymond Green, who has an opt out of his contract on June 29th, if he wants it. They have the 19th pick in the draft. They are also exploring various avenues to upgrade the roster while dealing with a skyrocketing tax bill. — Slater\n\nBackstory\n\nFollowing a period of substantial contract extension talks, Myers and the Warriors parted ways after 12 seasons. The former executive of the year was one of the most influential voices in the franchise.\n\nDunleavy, who has represented the team at league general manager meetings, was pegged by many as the natural successor. He has attended prospect workouts leading up to this year’s NBA Draft and has been given more visibility and responsibility within the organization.\n\nRequired reading\n\nWarriors’ president, GM Bob Myers stepping away: What this means for Golden State\n\nBob Myers leaves Warriors after 4 NBA titles — and it wasn’t because of money\n\n(Photo: Garrett Ellwood / NBAE via Getty Images)"
