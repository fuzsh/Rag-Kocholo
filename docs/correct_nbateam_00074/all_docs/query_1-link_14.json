        "text": "In today’s Dub Hub:\n\nWarriors general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. held his pre-draft press conference where he discussed the current state of the team, including his emphasis on the internal development of the team’s young core.\n\nWarriors guarantee Kevon Looney’s $8 million contract prior to the Monday deadline on his contract, according to ESPN.\n\nESPN’s Bobby Marks lists the rules of the first and second aprons outlined in the CBA.\n\nGolden State Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. held a press conference on Monday to discuss the current state of the team ahead of Wednesday’s NBA Draft. From Klay Thompson’s contract negotiations to the possibility of making a trade, Dunleavy touched on several of the biggest news topics surrounding the team this offseason.\n\nOne of the more interesting answers from Dunleavy was his response to potentially making a trade. While he started his presser saying that “all options are on the table”, he continually emphasized the importance of internal development. Dunleavy notes the difficulty of executing a trade in the NBA, so focusing on the development of the team’s young core may be the organization’s best path to improvement.\n\nFor more on this and other news around the NBA, here is our latest news round-up for Tuesday, June 25th:\n\nWarriors News:\n\nGeneral manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. believes ‘internal development’ gives the Warriors their best chance at improvement\n\nSources: Warriors guarantee Kevon Looney’s $8M contract | ESPN\n\nWhile this keeps Looney on the Warriors’ roster for now, sources told ESPN he could be part of a trade package depending on how Golden State’s roster changes through free agency.\n\nWith Looney’s now guaranteed deal and the $30 million non-guaranteed contract of guard Chris Paul, Golden State has $175 million in salary. The guarantee date for Paul is June 28.\n\nAggregate 2024 NBA Mock Draft: Paul George, Tyrese Maxey free agency; Zach LaVine trade talks | Hoops Hype\n\nThe Golden State Warriors have several upcoming items on the offseason agenda, including Klay Thompson’s free agency, attempting to extend forward Jonathan Kuminga, and figuring out whether to guarantee Kevon Looney’s salary for the upcoming season.\n\nKuminga will likely be a Warrior going forward unless he’s needed in a trade package for an All-NBA player, HoopsHype has learned.\n\nAccording to league sources who spoke with HoopsHype, it would be a surprise if Looney was waived by the Warriors before his salary guarantees ahead of free agency, echoing a report from The Athletic. Trading Looney is a possibility.\n\nSix candidates for Warriors to consider as Atkinson’s replacement | NBC Sports Bay Area\n\nFrank Vogel\n\nHe has one of the longest resumés in the NBA, spending 10 years as an assistant before becoming head coach for four different teams (Indiana Pacers, Orlando Magic, Lakers, Phoenix Suns) over the past 14 years. He lasted only one season in Phoenix, being fired after the Suns were swept in a first-round Western Conference playoff series in April. Vogel, 51, still had four seasons remaining on a five-year, $31 million contract. He is a widely respected coach mostly aligned with building a strong defense.\n\nBrandin Podziemski signs a multi-year shoe deal with the company Rigorer\n\nNBA News:\n\nSources: Raptors’ Scottie Barnes to sign max rookie extension | ESPN\n\nThe deal — the richest in Raptors history — guarantees Barnes $225 million and would escalate to the supermaximum should he make an All-NBA team, All-Defensive team or earn MVP honors. The deal is a statement that Barnes is indeed the franchise player and the young star the organization plans to build its future around.\n\nESPN’s Bobby Marks outlines the rules of the CBA’s first and second aprons\n\nNew Lakers head coach JJ Redick held his introductory press conference on Monday\n\nIn case you missed it at Golden State of Mind:\n\nMike Dunleavy Jr. on Klay Thompson: ‘We want him back’\n\nAnd on Monday, general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. re-affirmed the organization’s desire to do exactly that. While speaking to reporters at a pre-draft media availability, Dunleavy — who is starting his second year as the GM — refused to offer details on how negotiations have gone with Thompson, but he did make it crystal clear that they want him back.\n\n“We want him back,” Dunleavy said. “We’ve said that all along. Hopefully he comes back.”"
