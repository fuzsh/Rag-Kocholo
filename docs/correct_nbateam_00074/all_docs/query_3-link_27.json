        "text": "Sharpshooting Bahamian Buddy Hield expressed excitement at the opportunity to play for the Golden State Warriors in his first interaction with Warriors media on Thursday.\n\nThe 31-year-old joined the seven-time NBA Champions through a sign-and-trade with the Philadelphia 76ers in early July.\n\nThe Warriors will be the fifth team Hield has represented since being drafted sixth overall by the New Orleans Pelicans in the 2016 NBA Draft.\n\n“Excited! Excited for the opportunity to come in here and learn from great players, a great organization, great coach, and be a sponge and an open book to everybody around me,” was Hield’s response to a question about his emotions heading into his first season in San Francisco.\n\nHield was brought in by the Warriors as a like-for-like replacement for franchise legend Klay Thompson who left for the Dallas Mavericks in Free Agency after 13 seasons and four titles with the Warriors.\n\nThe Bahamian says he isn’t feeling the pressure of trying to replicate what Thompson gave the Warriors.\n\n“There’s no pressure, I just have to come and do my job. What Klay has done for this organization has been tremendous. I love Klay a lot and I watched him over the years and he’s special,” he said.\n\n“The way he can get hot and change the game as a two-way player. I think it’s fun being in that role,” he added.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of the Warriors during their run of dominance in the Steph Curry-Draymond Green-Klay Thompson era has been their complicated offensive scheme.\n\nHield believes practice is the key to learning where he fits into the offense quickly.\n\n“Taking it day by day in practice, watching a lot of film. Practice will be really important. I’ve watched these guys play since college. Even in the pros when they play, they’re always a fun team to watch,” he said.\n\n“I think it’s a great fit and it shouldn’t be that hard but everything takes time,” he added.\n\nRussell Westbrook is on the move once again, but isn't yet at his final destination.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers agreed to send Westbrook to the Utah Jazz on Thursday, as part of a sign-and-trade deal, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.\n\nThe Jazz are expected to reach a contract buyout agreement with Westbrook, opening the door for him to join the Denver Nuggets.\n\nDenver will be the sixth team Westbrook has played for in the last seven seasons.\n\nTo complete the trade, Utah will also receive a swap of second-round draft picks and cash from Los Angeles, while shipping guard Kris Dunn to the Clippers.\n\nThe 35-year-old Westbrook was named the NBA MVP in 2016-17, averaging a career-high 31.6 points, along with 10.7 rebounds and 10.4 assists.\n\nIn 2023-24 for the Clippers, he averaged career lows of 11.1 points and 4.5 assists with 5 boards. He came off the bench in 57 of the 68 games he played, shooting 27.3 per cent from 3-point range - the second-lowest mark among the 226 players with at least 150 attempts from beyond the arc.\n\nThe Nuggets still believe he can provide depth off the bench and help them make another run at a title after being eliminated in the Western Conference semi-finals in May.\n\nThe Clippers were ousted by the Dallas Mavericks in the first round, with Westbrook averaging 6.3 points, 4.2 rebounds and 1.7 assists in the six play-off games.\n\nIn 1,162 games in a 16-year career, Westbrook has averages of 21.7 points, 8.1 assists and 7.1 rebounds. His 199 career triple-doubles are the most in NBA history.\n\nDunn has career averages of 7.9 points, 4.2 assists and 3.3 boards since being drafted fifth overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2016.\n\nIn starting 32 of 66 games for the Jazz last season, the 30-year-old Dunn averaged 5.4 points, 3.8 assists and 2.9 rebounds.\n\nKyrie Irving has undergone surgery on a broken hand, but is expected to be fit for the start of next season.\n\nIrving was part of the Dallas Mavericks team that reached the NBA Finals, only to go down to the dominant Boston Celtics.\n\nThe 32-year-old sustained his injury while training earlier in July, and has now gone through surgery to fix the issue.\n\nPosting on X, Irving wrote: \"Tribe, Thank you for all the messages and prayers. God truly knew that I needed to take a break from basketball after the long season and give myself some time to heal.\n\n\"I am in love with getting better at my craft, but now I must rest and recover.\"\n\nWhile the Mavs did not confirm a timetable for Irving's return, it has been reported he is anticipated to return to action in around two and a half months.\n\nThe 2024-25 season is set to begin in October.\n\nIrving averaged 25.6 points per game in the regular season across 2023-24.\n\nThe Mavs have brought in Klay Thompson as a free agent this off-season."
