        "text": "The Golden State Warriors announced Mike Dunleavy Jr. as the team’s next general manager on Friday following Bob Myers’ step down from the position in May.\n\n“We think Mike is the perfect fit to lead our basketball operations department,” Co-Executive Chairman and CEO Joe Lacob said in the June 16 statement. “He has a wealth of basketball knowledge, stemming from his family upbringing, a 15-year NBA playing career and five seasons serving under Bob Myers in our front office.”\n\nGolden State was the first stop in Dunleavy’s career, picked No. 3 by the Warriors in the 2002 draft from Duke.\n\nThe 42-year-old spent nearly five seasons in the bay before getting traded to the Pacers in 2007 and eventually retired in 2017 after bouncing around the league.\n\nMyers, who stepped down after an 11-season run that included four NBA championships, was Dunleavy’s agent in the early stages of his playing days and brought his former client back to the Warriors in 2018 as a pro scout.\n\nDunleavy climbed the management ladder, was promoted to assistant GM in 2019 and became the vice president of basketball operations in 2021.\n\n“The one thing he knew he didn’t want to do was coach,” Myers said, according to The Athletic. “Which is a little bit surprising because I think he’d be a good coach. But he was focused on the front office.”\n\nOnce Myers resigned –– which is effective June 30 –– many believed Dunleavy would be pegged as his successor based on his history and previous work with the organization.\n\n“He’s young and energetic, has established numerous relationships around the league and communicates well with players and coaches — all important traits in this business. Mike’s ready for this challenge and responsibility,” the Warriors’ statement said.\n\nDunleavy was tossed the reins during a turning point for the Golden State squad.\n\nThe new GM is tasked with crunching the numbers to either preserve or construct a new era for the team.\n\nCenter Draymond Green, who has been with the Warriors since 2012, has a $26.7 million player option next season with expected contract extension discussions.\n\nKlay Thompson is also in the final year of his contract and will hit the free agency market in 2024, looking to get paid –– big time.\n\nThe Warriors posted a 44-38 record in the 2022-23 season.\n\nThe group fell to the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference semifinals after ousting Sacramento in the first round."
