        "text": "Steve McPherson\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n12 min read\n\n·\n\nJan 23, 2018\n\n--\n\nIn 2016, I started collecting material for what I envisioned would be a book on — for lack of a better term — journeymen and glue guys in the NBA. That is, players who weren’t superstars or All-Stars but who nonetheless managed to make a career of it, sticking in the league for 10+ years and being contributors wherever they went. I’ve always been fascinated by this type of player: athletes who were often the best player on any team they were on right up until they reached the highest echelon of the sport and then had to learn how to adapt to that.\n\nWith the future of said project very much up in the air due to some life and career changes, I thought I would post some of the interviews I did as Q+As. I spoke with Mike Dunleavy via phone in the summer of 2016 while he was on the Chicago Bulls and before he was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers ahead of the 2016–17 season. Even though he was at Duke with Shane Battier and also went to a not great NBA team, his experience in the league and his takeaways from it are quite different from Shane’s. Dunleavy has played for the Golden State Warriors, Indiana Pacers, Milwaukee Bucks, Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers and Atlanta Hawks and won the NCAA Championship with Duke in 2001.\n\nWhat would you tell your rookie self if you could go back?\n\nHonestly, I would say: be less team-oriented. I think coming out of college, playing at Duke, I jumped into the NBA and all my thoughts were about the team and making the team better and making the right plays. And when you come in the league as a high draft pick [3rd pick in 2002 by Golden State], everybody expects you to produce. Looking back on it, I would have been a little more selfish and I think at times that’s kind of hurt me in my career. I haven’t pushed enough, shot more, dribbled more, made more plays. I think it’s worked out for me fine in the long run, but I think looking back on it I’d probably be less team-oriented.\n\nIronically, that’s why I’m still playing now. I think I’m a pretty team-oriented guy and teams see me as somebody that can help them win. So I’m hanging on because of that.\n\nDid you become a team-oriented player at Duke, or did it start earlier?\n\nI think through high school, growing up with my dad as a coach. I think any coach’s sons have a good understanding of the game and what wins and what loses. Just always been a team-oriented player and when you get to the pros, it’s just a little different. Especially back in the early 2000s, it was a different game. Now there’s a transition where it’s more like Golden State and these teams where you move the ball and share a lot. But back then it was just a lot of isolation and that’s where the stars really thrive. So for me, I kinda got caught in between. I think I would have been a little better off if I was about ten years younger coming in now. It’s probably more conducive to my skill set.\n\nDo you think you could have been more of a star-type player if you had made that change in your approach early on?\n\nYeah, I think I could have, yeah. I didn’t have the right perspective on it. Early on in my career it hurt me. As I’ve gotten older, though, I’ve been able to adapt into a role that I can play on a winning team, play a lot of minutes and have a really good role. That’s been great for me, I love doing that. But early on, you know, there are superstars in the league and then there are next-tier guys that make the All-Star team, you do things like that. Basically, you have a couple good years where your team’s doing well and you get a lot of guys that make the All-Star team and I just didn’t … you know, my mindset wasn’t there. It was playing for a bad franchise, trying to improve the team, and I wasn’t thinking enough about myself.\n\nHow much of where your career ultimately went was a product of being drafted by Golden State?\n\nSo a lot of guys, unless you come in the league and you’re LeBron or just a born superstar, a lot of it’s situational. What situation, what environment are they in with the organization will determine how well they’ll do. I got off to a rough start, being the third pick on a bad team and an organization that was trying to find their way. And here they are now, they have! But back then, it was tough for young players. It wasn’t the best place to be. But I feel like I made the most of it and I’ve had a good career.\n\nWhen I talked to Shane, he talked about the lack of vets on the Memphis Grizzlies who could act as mentors, whereas Tayshaun Prince talked about how important coming into that Detroit team as it was really shaped the player he became. What was your experience with the Warriors like?\n\nThose are two perfect examples of opposite ends of the spectrum of guys that are probably in the same realm of how good they are and Tayshaun got a championship within five years and really became a really good player right away and then Shane, him and I, really had to kind of dig it out a little because you come into these situations — and it really starts at the top with the organizations. They’re trying to find their way. There was a new coach, there was a front office that was sort of undefined. It was all over the place. Those are tough environments for young players, especially us coming from Duke where everything was so set up and polished.\n\nShane also talked about how at Duke you started out as a role player on a team with established stars who were juniors and seniors and then you learned to take on those roles eventually.\n\nYou work your way up. You play every role. You play the freshman, rookie role where your minutes are all over the place and you have some good games and some bad. Then you mature in your sophomore year, a little bit bigger and then your junior year and then in Shane’s case your senior year, he was national player of the year. To go through that progression probably gave him a great — and myself included to a certain extent — idea of how to play different roles. I’ve been willing to score on a team and I’ve been just kind of a key contributor. You learn how to do them all.\n\nAnd the Warriors at that time were not structured like that.\n\nYeah, it was kind of like the blind leading the blind. We had some good vets, definitely some guys I learned from, Antawn Jamison, second and third year guys, Cliff Robinson, Avery Johnson was on the team with me. You definitely learn from those guys, but the overall environment … people were just passing through. It wasn’t a destination. It was tough for young guys.\n\nHow does that kind of environment come about on a team?\n\nEven though it’s a great area, a great market, the team had not had a lot of success. There wasn’t a lot of continuity between the general manager and the coaching staff and they’ve completely turned it around now. It’s just complete synergy. They are where they are now. A lot of that’s turned since they made the change and brought in new owner, new management, new coach and they’re all on one page.\n\nAs someone who’s gotten to experience the culture on several different teams, just how different can that culture be team to team? How much of a change was it to go to Indiana?\n\nAfter my experience with Golden State, going to Indiana, it was a little more organized, yeah. Unfortunately, that situation, was they were just getting over the brawl and they were cleaning house. And that was just timing again. They had just come off winning 60 games and the brawl happened and I go there and they pretty much start rebuilding again. Again, it was a much better situation for me, but we weren’t winning a lot of games. So it wasn’t ideal.\n\nIn your career, have you been a mentor to young guys?\n\nYeah, I really try and help guys because I know guys helped me when I was younger and you want to pay that back. Just knowing the game and watching a lot of games and understanding it, you just want to pass your knowledge along. Right now, on our team, Doug McDermott, I’m trying to help him out as much as I can, because similar positions, similar players. It’s tough at the same time because I remember when I was in his shoes and everybody is telling you a million things. I’m pretty careful not to overdo it: a thing here, a thing there. Otherwise, it’s just information overload and you just have to experience and figure things out yourself.\n\nTayshaun talked about the importance of trying to get at guys right when something happens because the game moves so fast, it can flash right by them and they lose touch with the context.\n\nIf you can do it when you’re on the floor with them, that’s better. The younger guys don’t remember plays the way we do. I mean, we can go back and remember almost the entire game and what happened here, what happened there. New guys, it’s just a blur. You’re right: if I go up to the guy on the bus and go, “Hey remember that play in the second quarter, you know, you did this and you should do that,” they’re kind of like, “Yeah, okay …” You can tell they don’t really get it. Maybe that’s just the new generation with the short attention span and the Internet and the iPhones and all that but yeah: I agree with him on that.\n\nHow long does it take before you can get that comprehensive recall of a game afterwards? When does it slow down?\n\nI think … When I was in Indiana, I played for Jim O’Brien. And he was a really particular, detail-oriented coach and we watched a lot of film. He stopped practice all the time to point things out and I really, really learned a lot from him on both ends of the court. We watched a lot of film and that just helped me see things. The game slowed down for me. At that point, I felt that I had a great grasp of how to play in this league and felt like, at that point, I could share my thoughts with other people. I felt really comfortable with how the game worked.\n\nA while, then.\n\nYeah, that’s five, six, seven years.\n\nDo people — both fans and new players — underestimate how much experience players need to be really effective?\n\nThe young guys that struggle right off the bat but are somewhat intelligent, eventually can figure it out. The guys that don’t really have a feel for the game and are maybe not as bright, they struggle early on, it’s gonna be tough. If they can’t pick things up and see the game the right way, they may never get it. You’re not going to last. Guys just don’t last. You gotta have a good brain and be somewhat intelligent to be able to figure things out when you’re struggling and make the adjustments you need to make.\n\nHow much of working with younger guys is pure technical stuff and how much is understanding the NBA life — the travel, the training, the media, the attention?\n\nIt’s a combination. Tough to say. I throw in a lot of the things you mention. Leading by example as well. Hopefully there are days where I can go in and not say a word to these younger guys but they see me getting in there early and leaving late, setting the right example. That’s a part of it as well. As far as the other stuff, probably 50/50 — as far as technical basketball stuff and then the other side of living the life and habits and things like that.\n\nHow has the league changed over the course of your career? Are there fewer vets now?\n\nAs far as the veterans, they’re few and far between because they just don’t put up with guys anymore that carry any baggage. You better be in the category of guys like Shane and Tayshaun and myself where you know you’re bringing something positive to the table and very few negatives. If you’re bringing more negatives than positives, they’ll look to kick you out of the league as fast as they can. Nobody will be interested in you.\n\nBut as far as changes in the league, the other thing that’s a huge change since I’ve been in the league is just the size and strength of guys. The rules have changed and they want more of a free flowing, open game. When I came in, all the small forwards were practically as big as LeBron. These guys were power forward size. You had to come in and deal with that and it was just a much more physical, pounding game. It’s changed and I think it’s changed for the better. It’s way more enjoyable to watch and more skilled players are needed. I guess that’s another big change.\n\nTayshaun seemed to lament at least a little bit the loss of some of that toughness in the league.\n\nThe game is way better now. Anybody that says differently is incredibly biased. To add on to what Tayshaun’s saying, when we came in the game, our first few years in the league, the way we look — we’re both thinner guys — they took us down on the block every time and tried to post us up. Literally. All 30 teams had a guy that would do that. Nowadays, I probably play post defense ten times a year total. That’s a huge difference.\n\nAre guys just not learning to play in the post on offense? Is that why you’re not defending on the block as much as well?\n\nI think it’s been devalued. The 3-pointer is valued, it’s a considerably more efficient shot. So instead of working on your post game in the summertime and all these different types of moves, it’s better to sit and shoot 500 corner 3s. Post game especially from perimeter players has become pretty scarce.\n\nIs that maybe a market inefficiency in the league?\n\nFor sure. I’m a believer in that and I believe there’s a place for that in being able to take advantage of matchups. I think it’s a great area to score from. But just the way the game has changed and coaches’ philosophies of wanting to spread it out, play pick and roll, you know, shoot 30, 40 3s … I don’t know if it’s an oversight by coaches or front offices, but it’s just become a dinosaur. You mentioned LeBron: there’s a few guys that do it and are so good and efficient at it. Really their strength is just being able to get to the basket and get fouled. But in terms of teaching post moves and McHale moves and Kareem hook shots and stuff like that, that’s just not encouraged.\n\nAt this point in your career, what gets you excited to go out and play the game?\n\nI just love the preparation. I love going in to shootaround and working and getting ready for tonight’s game and coming back early. I just love, kind of, the lead up and then the scouting the preparing for it. And then the game plays itself. I still enjoy it. When I don’t enjoy working and preparing to do that, it will probably be time for me.\n\nSo it’s a craft thing.\n\nOh absolutely. I still have the desire to get in the gym the next morning and work on my shot and things like that. I guess when you don’t care anymore it’s time to hang it up."
