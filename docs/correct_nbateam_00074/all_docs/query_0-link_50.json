        "text": "It took more than three hours Thursday, and into Friday morning, but Trayce Jackson-Davis now has clarity on where he’ll be playing basketball next.\n\nNo, his hometown Indiana Pacers didn’t select him at 47 or 55. It would’ve come 32 years after they selected his father, Dale Davis, 13th overall. And Dale wore No. 32.\n\nThe Pacers, who have excess frontcourt players and limited open roster spots, instead selected Mojave King and then Isaiah Wong.\n\nAnd so around 12:15 a.m., as teams continued to draft other players, Jackson-Davis tweeted: “Y’all will regret it… I promise you.”\n\nThe Golden State Warriors, the team he began the pre-draft workout process with, ultimately was able to trade back into the draft to select him with the 57th overall pick. The TV broadcast was at commercial when this happened so he never heard his name announced by Mark Tatum, the NBA’s Deputy Commissioner.\n\nThe Warriors sent cash considerations to the Washington Wizards for the rights to the second-to-last pick in the draft.\n\nJackson-Davis plans to sign a three-year deal with a team option in Year 3, a league source told Fieldhouse Files.\n\nAnd new Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr., a former Pacer, said Jackson-Davis will be part of the 15-man roster right away. That’s important because players selected after about 40 are typically signed to a two-way or non-guaranteed contract.\n\nOh, and Jackson-Davis’ agent? That’s James Dunleavy — Mike’s brother.\n\nThis is the perfect example of a tax team using the new Second Pick Exception.\n\nThe 23-year-old forward spent draft night surrounded by friends and family at a restaurant in downtown Indy. His IU teammates even rode up from Bloomington on a bus to be there and celebrate alongside their leader.\n\nThis is a very strong situation TJD is joining.\n\nCoached by Steve Kerr, learning from one of the all-time greats in Steph Curry, playing in one of the best arenas in the country at the Chase Center while living in San Francisco. Rent will be high and it’s far from family and friends, but he’s joining a well-run franchise that is all about winning.\n\nClick here to read my feature on Jackson-Davis, who said “I know I can help a team.”\n\nWatch what he had to say following his workout for the Pacers:"
