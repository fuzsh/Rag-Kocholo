        "text": "15-year NBA veteran and former Warrior Mike Dunleavy Jr. highlights the team’s additions to the basketball operations staff, as he comes on board as a Pro Scout. Dunleavy averaged 11.2 points, 4.3 rebounds and 2.2 assists over his playing career in addition to taking home second-team All-American honors as a junior at Duke.\n\nThe son of former NBA player and coach Mike Dunleavy Sr., it’s hard to argue with the basketball pedigree of Dunleavy Jr.\n\nSome other notable additions include Carl Bergstrom (Performance Coach), Brett Ballesteros (Assistant Athletic Trainer and Assistant Performance Coach), Gerry Ramogida (Performance Therapist) and Nick Kerr (Assistant Video Coordinator).\n\nBergstrom has worked with the MLS’ Vancouver Whitecaps, the NHL’s Vancouver Canucks, and with the Canadian Women’s Olympic Soccer team.\n\nBallesteros was with the Warriors during the 2014-15 championship season before working with Stanford’s football and track and field programs.\n\nRamogida has consulted for the Canucks as well as the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks, in addition to being on the staff of Canada’s Olympic and World Track and Field Championship teams.\n\nKerr served as a Quality Assurance Assistant with the Spurs last season after being a graduate assistant at Cal-Berkley, where he also played his final collegiate season."
