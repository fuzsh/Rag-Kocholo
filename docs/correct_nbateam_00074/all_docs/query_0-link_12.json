        "text": "Beaverton, Ore. -- Jesuit High School inducted class of 1999 alumnus and Chicago Bulls small forward Mike Dunleavy, Jr., into the Jesuit Hall of Fame. The induction ceremony and luncheon were held on Tuesday, November 24, at 12:45 p.m. in the Jesuit High School Smith Gym.\n\nDunleavy first attended Jesuit in his junior year, 1997-1998. He led the Crusaders to their first 20-win season and a quarterfinal appearance at the state tournament -- the first since 1976. This earned him Metro League Player of the Year and First Team All-State. During his senior year, Jesuit won the first Metro League title since 1970 and the first state championship in school history. Dunleavy again earned Metro League Player of the Year and First Team All-State, as well as Oregon Player of the Year.\n\nAfter graduation, Dunleavy attended Duke University. He played basketball for three seasons before entering the NBA Draft in 2002. Duke's record during Dunleavy's time was 95-13. During his sophomore year, Duke won the national championship, and Dunleavy scored 21 points in the championship game. In his three years, Dunleavy received several honors, including First-Team NABC All-American and Academic All-American.\n\nIn 2002, Dunleavy entered the NBA Draft and was chosen by the Golden State Warriors in the first round, third pick. He played for the Warriors from 2002-2007. He was later traded to the Indiana Pacers in 2007 and started all 82 games, averaging 19.1 points per game. Dunleavy went on to play for the Milwaukie Bucks in 2011 and finally for the Chicago Bulls in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, Dunleavy set a playoff career-high of 35 points, including a franchise playoff record for most three-point field goals with eight against the Washington Wizards in game three of their 2014 NBA Playoffs first round match-up, which the Bulls won 100-97.\n\nDunleavy's father is Mike Dunleavy, Sr., a former NBA coach and player. Dunleavy and his wife, Sarah, have three children and currently reside in Chicago, Ill."
