        "text": "Mike Dunleavy Jr\n\nSF, 6’9, 230lbs, 36 years old, 15 years of experience\n\nStill very good at spotting up, and will occasionally take a couple of dribbles against an overplay, but is limited to catching-and-shooting now without the speed to get open off the ball as well as others. Also continues to struggle with injuries and is merely a minimum salary candidate at this point.\n\nPlayer Plan: $5,175,000 contract for 2017/18 with only a $1,662,500 guaran-teed portion. Waive and stretch.\n\nRead full article\n\n[...] In comparison, 36 such players have signed within those parameters in 2013. And in contrast to 2008, those names are often established quality role players who aren't quite stars and who rightly aren't being paid like it. At the top end, players like Monta Ellis, Jose Calderon, Brandon Jennings, Jarrett Jack, Jeff Teague and Carl Landry are all getting acceptable prices, perhaps $2 million annually less than they would have done five years ago. At the bottom end, established role players like Marreese Speights, Tony Allen and Chris Kaman are getting paid adequately for their useful role player production. And unlike in 2008, those deals like Kaman's are not too long. See also Greg Stiemsma, Tyler Hansbrough, Mike Dunleavy Jr, Dorell Wright and Randy Foye, none more than three years in length, some as short as one.\n\nRead full article\n\nMike Dunleavy Jr. – Chicago Bulls\n\nDunleavy has been one of the best sixth men in the NBA over the past two seasons. It has been largely unheralded due to Milwaukee’s mediocrity and the play of other sixth men candidates, but it is nonetheless true. Now 33, Dunleavy is on the downside of his career with a significant knee injury in his history, but none of that diminishes how good he has been. He has developed into a quality shooter, who can get open without the ball and who can always get a shot away at 6’9, and who can still do more than just catch and shoot if needs be. His price of two years and just over $6 million is extremely fair for his services, and negates the loss for Chicago of Kyle Korver, whose new four year $24 million would have been too much for a reserve.\n\nRead full article"
