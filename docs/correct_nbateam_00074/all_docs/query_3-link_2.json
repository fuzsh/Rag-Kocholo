        "text": "We had an incredible time hosting our annual Bring Your Kids To Work Day, where the next generation experienced the dedication and teamwork behind the Golden State Warriors. We are extremely proud of the excitement and joy our team brought to these 30 future all-stars!\n\nOn Sunday, June 30th, Golden State Warriors’ team members marched in the San Francisco Pride Parade alongside our friends from Kaiser Permanente and Accenture. Each year, the Warriors and Kaiser Permanente partner to support numerous Pride Month initiatives throughout the Bay Area. This year, members of the Warriors Dance Teams and the Bay Blue Notes also participated in the parade, providing entertainment and tunes along the route. We are incredibly proud of the representation and growth of our Pride Alliance ERG and appreciate the continued support from our partners at Accenture to assist in our organization’s DEI efforts. We are committed to creating safe and inclusive space at our games and beyond!\n\nJoin us in welcoming our 2024 Summer Interns to the Golden State Warriors team! Our internship program provides participants an inside look at various departments at Golden State Warriors, Santa Cruz Warriors, Chase Center and Golden State Entertainment. Our interns will spend the next several weeks learning about the different elements of the sports and entertainment industry!\n\nWarriors Basketball Academy, powered by Rakuten, is celebrating its 25th Anniversary this summer through a variety of activations, including 36 camp sessions at 20 Bay Area locations for youth ages seven to 17. Look who stopped by to surprise our campers ... Stephen Curry! Registration for summer camp sessions is available at gswacademy.com\n\nWarriors Gaming Squad (WGS), the NBA 2K League affiliate team of the Golden State Warriors, has won the 2024 NBA 2K League Championship following a 3-0 series win against Celtics Crossover Gaming. With the win, WGS becomes the first franchise in league history to win multiple tournaments (THE TURN and THE TIPOFF) and the NBA 2K League Championship in the same season and the second franchise in league history to repeat as champions (Wizards District Gaming, 2020 and 2021).\n\nGeneration Thrive graduated its third cohort of Bridging the Bay, Igniting Leaders of Change, presented by Rocket Lawyer to provide capacity-building and resources for executive and c-suite leaders guiding Bay Area pre-kindergarten through 12th-grade youth-serving nonprofits. We are inspired by the commitment of 16 nonprofit executives who came together to refine their leadership skills and transformative peer learning. Spanning three months of intensive leadership development training, participants gained skills in self-awareness, communication, critical thinking, inclusion, and collaboration, and received executive coaching sessions. This cohort represented organizations focused on youth development, educational equity, mental health, and violence prevention."
