        "text": "Michael Joseph Dunleavy Jr. (born September 15, 1980) is an American professional basketball executive and former player who is the general manager for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils, earning consensus second-team All-American honors in 2002. Dunleavy was selected by Golden State with the third overall pick of the 2002 NBA draft. He played in the NBA for the Warriors, Indiana Pacers, Milwaukee Bucks, Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers and Atlanta Hawks. He is the son of former NBA player and head coach Mike Dunleavy Sr.\n\nHigh school career\n\nAs a 1999 graduate of Jesuit High School in Beaverton, Oregon, Dunleavy led them to the 1999 4A State Boys Basketball Championship over North Salem High School, 65–38. Dunleavy attended the University School of Milwaukee for his freshman year, and Homestead High School in Mequon, Wisconsin for his sophomore year.\n\nCollege career\n\nDunleavy played at Duke University from 1999 to 2002. As a sophomore, he played on Duke's national championship team and scored a team-high 21 points in the title game, including 3 three-pointers during a decisive 11–2 second-half Duke run. As a junior, Dunleavy was a first-team NABC All-American, averaging 17.3 points per game and 7.2 rebounds per game for the 31–4 Blue Devils.\n\nIn 2001–02, Dunleavy, Jay Williams, and Carlos Boozer each scored at least 600 points for the season, a feat only matched at Duke by Jon Scheyer, Kyle Singler, and Nolan Smith in the 2009–10 season.\n\nProfessional career\n\nGolden State Warriors (2002–2007)\n\nDunleavy was selected by the Golden State Warriors third overall in the 2002 NBA draft.\n\nIn November 2005, the Warriors signed Dunleavy to a 5-year, $44 million contract extension. During the 2005–06 season, Dunleavy lost his starting role as small forward for a number of games, due partly to a shooting slump. He won back the starting job later in the season and was expected to start at his new position of power forward for the 2006–07 season. Some early struggles, however, prompted Warriors head coach Don Nelson to send Dunleavy back to the bench, juggling his lineup in search of better team chemistry and winning results.\n\nIndiana Pacers (2007–2011)\n\nOn January 17, 2007, Dunleavy was dealt to the Indiana Pacers along with teammates Troy Murphy, Ike Diogu, and Keith McLeod for Stephen Jackson, Al Harrington, Šarūnas Jasikevičius, and Josh Powell. In his first full season with the Pacers, Dunleavy started all 82 games and averaged a career-high 19.1 points per game.\n\nDuring the 2010–2011 season, the Indiana Pacers advanced to the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2006 thanks to a regular-season finale win over the Washington Wizards coupled with a Charlotte Bobcats loss to the Orlando Magic. Dunleavy scored 14 points in the 136–112 victory. Dunleavy also ended his career playoff drought of nine years and 624 games. He was the second-active leader in this category behind former Warriors and Pacers teammate Troy Murphy, who also ended his drought as a part of the Boston Celtics.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks (2011–2013)\n\nFollowing the 2011 NBA lockout, Dunleavy signed a two-year, $7.5 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks on December 10. His best game as a Buck came on November 3, 2012, when he recorded 29 points and 12 rebounds against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nChicago Bulls (2013–2016)\n\nOn July 10, 2013, Dunleavy signed with the Chicago Bulls, on a reported two-year deal worth about $6 million.\n\nOn April 25, 2014, Dunleavy set a playoff career-high 35 points including a franchise playoff record for most three-point field goals with 8 against the Washington Wizards in game three of their 2014 NBA Playoffs first round match-up, which the Bulls won 100–97.\n\nDunleavy injured his right ankle against the Denver Nuggets on January 1, 2015, and was sidelined for over a month.\n\nOn July 14, 2015, Dunleavy re-signed with the Bulls to a reported three-year, $14.4 million contract. After missing the Bulls' first 16 games of the season due to a back injury, he was ruled out for a further four-to-six weeks on December 3 due to the injury requiring additional rehabilitation.\n\nAfter appearing to throw punches at the Bucks' Michael Carter-Williams in a decisive game 6 in round one of the 2015 playoffs − which the Bulls won 120-66, eliminating the Bucks − Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Bucks retaliated against Dunleavy's \"dirty\" play with a hard foul, leading to Antetokounmpo being ejected from the game. Since, Dunleavy has been perhaps the most hated current or former player among fans of the Bucks, with the vulgar initialism \"FMD\" being commonly used online.\n\nOn February 1, 2016, using the flexible assignment rule, Dunleavy was assigned to the Santa Cruz Warriors, the D-League affiliate of the Golden State Warriors, with the goal to practice there during the Bulls' West Coast road trip. Two days later, he was recalled by the Bulls. On February 6, Dunleavy made his season debut for the Bulls after missing the first 49 games. He played 14 minutes and scored five points in a 112–105 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers (2016–2017)\n\nOn July 7, 2016, Dunleavy was traded, along with the rights to Vladimir Veremeenko, to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for the rights to Albert Miralles. He made his debut for the Cavaliers in the team's season opener on October 25, 2016, against the New York Knicks. In 22 minutes off the bench, he recorded four points, four rebounds, two assists and three steals in a 117–88 win. On December 23, 2016, he scored a season-high 14 points in a 119–99 win over the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nAtlanta Hawks (2017)\n\nOn January 7, 2017, Dunleavy was traded, along with Mo Williams and a future first-round draft pick, to the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for Kyle Korver. After Dunleavy initially refused to report to the Hawks while seeking a buyout of his contract, he changed his mind and agreed to join the team. On January 10, he reported to the team and passed his physical. Three days later, he made his debut for the Hawks, scoring six points on a pair of three-pointers in a 103–101 loss to the Boston Celtics. On January 15, he scored 20 points off the bench in a 111–98 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. It was his first 20-point performance since a first-round playoff game for Chicago on April 30, 2015. On March 3, 2017, Dunleavy was diagnosed with right ankle synovitis. He returned to action on March 22 against Washington after a 13-game injury layoff.\n\nDunleavy's final NBA game was Game 6 of the 2017 Eastern Conference First Round on April 28, 2017, in a 99–115 loss to the Washington Wizards. In his final game, Dunleavy only played for 71 seconds, substituting towards the end of the first quarter for Tim Hardaway Jr.. He would subsequently sit out the rest of the game, as the Hawks went on to lose the game and the series to Washington 4–2. On June 30, 2017, he was waived by the Hawks, and retired shortly afterwards.\n\nExecutive career\n\nOn September 24, 2018, Dunleavy was hired by the Golden State Warriors as a pro scout. On August 29, 2019, Dunleavy was promoted to assistant general manager of the Warriors. On September 30, 2021, Dunleavy was promoted to vice president of basketball operations. He won his first NBA championship after the Warriors defeated the Boston Celtics in six games in the 2022 NBA Finals. On June 16, 2023, Dunleavy was promoted to general manager of the Warriors following Bob Myers' subsequent step down from the position.\n\nPersonal life\n\nDunleavy has two younger brothers: Baker, who played at Villanova from 2002 to 2006 and is the former head coach at Quinnipiac; and James, who was a walk-on for USC and is currently an NBA player agent. His father is Mike Dunleavy Sr., former Los Angeles Clippers and Portland Trail Blazers coach, retired NBA player, and the former head coach at Tulane. While growing up, Dunleavy attended a residential sports camp in Eagle River, Wisconsin called Camp Menominee. In 2008, Camp Menominee honored Dunleavy by naming its basketball courts \"The Mike Dunleavy Jr. Courts\".\n\nNBA career statistics\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high\n\nRegular season\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2002–03 Golden State 82* 3 15.9 .403 .347 .780 2.6 1.3 .6 .2 5.7 2003–04 Golden State 75 69 31.1 .449 .370 .741 5.9 2.9 .9 .2 11.7 2004–05 Golden State 79 79 32.5 .451 .388 .779 5.5 2.6 1.0 .3 13.4 2005–06 Golden State 81 68 31.8 .406 .285 .778 4.9 2.9 .7 .4 11.5 2006–07 Golden State 39 6 26.9 .449 .346 .772 4.8 3.0 1.0 .3 11.4 2006–07 Indiana 43 43 35.6 .454 .283 .792 5.7 2.6 1.1 .2 14.0 2007–08 Indiana 82* 82* 36.0 .476 .424 .834 5.2 3.5 1.0 .4 19.1 2008–09 Indiana 18 14 27.5 .401 .356 .815 3.8 2.4 .7 .5 15.1 2009–10 Indiana 67 15 22.2 .410 .318 .842 3.5 1.5 .6 .2 9.9 2010–11 Indiana 61 44 27.6 .462 .402 .800 4.5 1.7 .7 .5 11.2 2011–12 Milwaukee 55 3 26.3 .474 .399 .811 3.7 2.1 .5 .1 12.3 2012–13 Milwaukee 75 3 25.9 .442 .428 .820 3.9 1.9 .5 .5 10.5 2013–14 Chicago 82* 61 31.5 .430 .380 .854 4.2 2.3 .8 .6 11.3 2014–15 Chicago 63 63 29.2 .435 .407 .805 3.9 1.8 .6 .3 9.4 2015–16 Chicago 31 30 22.7 .410 .394 .784 2.7 1.3 .5 .3 7.2 2016–17 Cleveland 23 2 15.9 .400 .351 .737 2.0 .9 .3 .1 4.6 2016–17 Atlanta 30 0 15.8 .438 .429 .846 2.3 1.0 .3 .2 5.6 Career 986 585 27.7 .441 .377 .803 4.3 2.2 .7 .3 11.2\n\nPlayoffs\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2011 Indiana 5 0 14.4 .350 .300 .667 1.2 1.6 .8 .0 5.0 2013 Milwaukee 4 0 22.8 .567 .438 .889 4.0 2.0 .5 .0 12.3 2014 Chicago 5 5 32.6 .472 .462 .667 3.6 2.4 .6 .2 13.2 2015 Chicago 12 12 32.4 .489 .482 .947 4.0 2.6 .8 .4 10.9 2017 Atlanta 6 0 8.8 .429 .400 1.000 .8 .3 .2 .0 2.0 Career 32 17 24.0 .480 .451 .840 2.9 1.9 .6 .2 8.8\n\nSee also"
