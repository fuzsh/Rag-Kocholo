        "text": "Since the beginning of NBA times, the greats have found new and imaginative ways for their teams to maintain peak motivation.\n\nMichael Jordan was a master at this us-against-the-world craft. Phil Jackson, whose Zen Master ways were so focused on perfecting one’s psychological approach, used to distribute books to his players with this goal in mind (including, not surprisingly, one about Jordan).\n\nThe list goes on. And as new Golden State general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. revealed during The Athletic NBA Show Tampering podcast on Monday afternoon, this proud Warriors group, which is hell-bent on winning a fifth title, is apparently on it.\n\nAs Dunleavy discussed, the league made all sorts of changes over the summer that adversely affected the Warriors’ ability to keep their dynasty alive. First, it was the “second apron” that came with the new collective bargaining agreement, a revamped luxury tax threshold that comes with serious roster consequences for all who dare to spend above it. Then came the star player resting rule, officially deemed the Player Participation Policy, which adds an element of NBA control to this tricky load management issue that we haven’t seen since the days of the late David Stern.\n\nFrom Warriors owner Joe Lacob on down, the Warriors see these unwelcome obstacles as ways to increase parity and, by proxy, put an end to their storied run. And their reaction to it all, Dunleavy said, has been a mixture of flattery and frustration.\n\n“I think first and foremost, for Joe and the whole franchise, I think (the rules changes are) a compliment,” Dunleavy said when asked about the “second apron.” “You know, they’re making rules to prevent you from succeeding. And I think that’s the way that some of us are, and certainly Joe, sees it. (There are now) financial implications that would maybe keep us from going to a certain level.\n\n“The (star player) rest stuff as well, a little bit, seems to be targeted at a roster similar to ours. So I think first of all, you take it as a compliment when, you know, just like Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar), (when) they took the dunk out (of the college game during his days at UCLA). … You’ve gotta first let it soak in and feel like, ‘OK, we did something right (for the changes to be seen as necessary).’ ”\n\nIt has been less than four months since Dunleavy was named Warriors GM, following in the massive footsteps of the widely celebrated Bob Myers, yet he’s comfortable acting as one of the primary faces — and voices — of this storied franchise. His path from his playing days to this high-profile front office role has been short, with Dunleavy’s 15-year career ending with the Atlanta Hawks in 2017 before he joined the Warriors as a pro scout a year later.\n\nHe was elevated to assistant general manager in the summer of 2019, vice president of basketball operations two years later and general manager when Myers decided to resign in late May. Along the way, he has been seen internally as the kind of respected, capable and trusted presence who could lead the front office in the same sort of steady way Myers had during his 11-year run. That time is now.\n\nThe 43-year-old discussed a variety of topics in our 25-minute sit-down, from their hopes of winning it all despite the league’s new regulations to the Chris Paul trade, the roster decisions that remain, his ethos as a rising front office executive and the contract questions that loom for coach Steve Kerr and Klay Thompson. These are the highlights of the interview, but the entire conversation can be found here:\n\nOn his choice to pursue a career as an executive after his playing days …\n\nWhether it’s the Players Association (or) the NBA, they bang you over the head with (the message that), ‘The ball doesn’t bounce forever, and you’ve got to figure out what you’re going to do next’ (when you retire). And for me, I always knew I wanted to stay in basketball. I’m incredibly passionate about it, love the game. …My dad (Mike Dunleavy) coached, my brother (Baker) is a college coach. I thought it through, and was like, ‘You know what, that’s not what I want to do.’ I didn’t love, particularly, the transient lifestyle and (had) just played 15 years in the league, and you’re going to all the road games, all the home games. It’s just a lot. So with a young family, I thought the front office side was probably more to my liking, and I’ve enjoyed it. The scouting part of it, the long-term strategic thinking, and just kind of building a team. I like that. … I’ve learned a lot, and been very fortunate to be here with the Warriors for five years, whether it’s Bob Myers, (executive vice president of basketball operations) Kirk Lacob, or Steve Kerr, our players, and throughout the organization picked up so many things. And, you know, I feel fortunate to be in this situation right now.\n\nOn the June 22 trade to land 38-year-old Paul, which went down just six days after Dunleavy was named GM, and the choice to go all-in with older veterans while saying goodbye to a young talent in 24-year-old Jordan Poole …\n\nThe CP stuff developed over maybe a week or 10 days. That was not a long-term deal that we were working on. It happened fast. (But) I think this league, and this job is all about capitalizing on time horizons. And right now, we’re in the thick of a period where we feel like we can still contend, and we want to take advantage of that. You don’t know how quickly your window will close. But I think our guys, whether it’s Steph (Curry), it’s Draymond (Green, who was given a four-year, $100 million deal in the summer), it’s Klay, those core guys have shown an ability to continue to play at a high level.\n\nComing off a championship, you know, just two years ago, I think we all feel like we’re still right there. And so to make a move to bring in Chris was, I mean, some may see it as short-sighted, short-term. But yeah, it helps us win now and then it gives us some future financial flexibility. And the hardest part is, as you mentioned, trading a young player that we liked that is only going to keep getting better. But you’ve got to make some tough decisions in this business. This is one that we calculated and felt made sense for now and moving forward.\n\nI think (the idea of adding Paul) first came up when the news came out that Phoenix was not going to bring Chris back. They were going to either buy him out or trade him or whatever it was. And that probably came out in early June. From there, we just (realized that) all of a sudden the guy is going to be available. I think we initially thought of it as, ‘Can we get him on a minimum contract in free agency if he’s waived? And then it just kept building from there. We identified him as a guy we thought could help our team. And the reason that was was just his experience, his leadership. We struggled last year and in years past with taking care of the ball. We struggled sometimes at the end of games with decision-making. So we felt like ‘Yeah, Chris is a little bit older. But he fits with our group, and he can help us in some areas that we’re deficient in. So it started to make sense. And then we had to make the salaries and the money work and all that, and we did. But that was sort of how it all began.\n\nOn the history between Paul and the Warriors that made the move so surprising to so many …\n\nYeah, I think you realize that these guys are all adults. Our guys that have been here, the veterans plus Chris, who has been around the league played many years, they all have one thing in common at this point in their careers. They want to win. And that common thread, we felt like, will unify the group. There may be some awkwardness or uncomfortableness, which I think probably is more so in the media than it is with these guys. I mean, they’re already connected, getting together in different areas, playing.\n\nAs Kerr shared in his Monday media session, Paul even took an early morning flight in August from his Los Angeles home to the Bay Area so that he could join his new teammates for a late-summer training session.\n\nSo that stuff, I don’t have a whole lot of worries about that. But I think just the common thread of competitiveness, intelligence and just being adults, those things make me believe that this thing can work out. I think for those guys, Draymond (and) Steph, especially, like you said, they’ve been through the wars with Chris for so many years and Chris the same way, that I think it came down to just that initial idea of it. There’s a little bit of a shock. And then once you settle in and think about it, and the ways that it would work, I think they quickly came back to, ‘This is kind of a no-brainer.’ And that’s the way we felt as an organization, as a front office, was that this deal makes a lot of sense. And barring anything where somebody’s pushing back against it on either side, we should go through with it.\n\nOn the question of whether these Warriors, who recently decided against adding Dwight Howard, have enough size …\n\nYeah, I think looking at it going into training camp right now, we have five guys who can give us minutes at the five (center) position. And I think about it through camp, making sure everybody gets the appropriate amount of reps, our rookie, Trayce Jackson-Davis, we drafted in the second round, we want him to get some reps. (Usman) Garuba (the 21-year-old big man who signed a two-way deal in late September), the same thing. He’s a young player, and we want him to play. So I think as we kind of look at that and evaluate it. We want to make sure there are enough reps in camp and early on in the season. But we’ll constantly be evaluating it. I think we’ll keep flexibility open, you know, and sure, we could add a big. We could add a wing. Maybe there’s an injury, and we need to add a guard. So I think for us, more so than any position of need right now, we’re focused on flexibility and we’ll see where we go from here.\n\nOn the Warriors managing to reinvest in their core and add Paul (whose $30 million salary for next season is nonguaranteed) while also maintaining financial flexibility going forward …\n\n(It’s) not only the second apron (that they’re below) but for us to have the financial flexibility to get below the tax, we have that in our back pocket as well. So I think we don’t just look at it as one thing. We look at it (in) multiple ways, and I think we’ve got that flexibility right now that’s good while also having a good team. So we’re in a sweet spot right now. We’ll see where it goes from here. And as we talked at the beginning, it’s kind of a year-to-year thing and we’ll continue to evaluate.\n\nOn the Kerr and Thompson contract situations …\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWhere do Klay Thompson extension talks with the Warriors stand?\n\nYeah, I think it’s in a good spot in the sense (that) both sides, you know, want to be back. We want those guys to continue to be here. I think those guys want to find ways to re-sign or extend their contracts. So that’s the most important thing right off the bat. And I think from there, you know, you’re hopeful a deal can get done. So we’ll continue to talk with their representation and work through it. But yeah, I mean, we — it’s hard to imagine what it would look like without Steve coaching this group or Klay being a part of it. So we want to continue to pursue that.\n\nOn how his five years of Warriors experience prepared him for this job …\n\nI think for me, thinking about my experience just alone here in five years and what I’ve gone through, I mean (look at) the draft process alone. We’ve drafted at the top, at No. 2, we’ve drafted in the lottery — eight and 14. We drafted this year at 19. My first year we were 28. So as a team, that means you’ve been all over the place. We’ve been a championship team, been a second-round playoff team, we’ve lost in the Play-In Tournament, had the worst record in the league. So for me, the years that we weren’t good (weren’t) great, but it’s a learning experience. And so for me building a team or, you know, maybe extending this window, the main thing is I think you’ve got to do it around your personnel and your coaching staff and all that. And for me being here, I have a good understanding of what our group likes, what our group needs, and will continue to go forward with that until we need to pivot or adjust in some way. And I think there’s been a good history of that here, whether it’s been the (Andrew) Wiggins move, some small little tweaks here and there. The group has done a good job, and I think we can do that moving forward.\n\n(Photo of Bob Meyers, Mike Dunleavy Jr. and Steve Kerr: Jesse D. Garrabrant / NBAE via Getty Images)"
