The Golden State Warriors are promoting Mike Dunleavy Jr. to be the team's new general manager, the team announced Friday.

ESPN was the first to report the hiring.

Dunleavy, Jr. was the Warriors' vice president of basketball operations. He will take over for former president and general manager Bob Myers, who recently stepped down last month after 11 seasons with the team.

Dunleavy, Jr. spent 15 seasons in the NBA and was drafted third overall in the 2002 draft by Golden State, spending four seasons with the team. He averaged 11.2 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 2.2 assists in his career.

The Warriors have some decisions to make this offseason after they were bounced from the playoffs in six games by the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference semifinals.

Veteran forward Draymond Green, 33, has a player option set at $27.6 million player option for next season as the team is staring down a hefty luxury tax bill of nearly $500 million.

Although the core of the team will be back next season, the Warriors are paying Stephen Curry nearly $52 million, and Klay Thompson is on the books for $43 million in the last year of his deal. Jordan Poole will make $28 million and Andrew Wiggins is set to make $24 million.
