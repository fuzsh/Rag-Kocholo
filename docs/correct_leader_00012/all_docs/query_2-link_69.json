        "text": "Both the individual whose personally identifiable information (PII) was the subject of the misuse and the organization that maintained the PII may experience some degree of adverse effects. Depending on the type of information involved, an individual may suffer social, economic, or physical harm resulting in potential loss of life, loss of livelihood, or inappropriate physical detention. If the information lost is sufficient to be exploited by an identity thief, for example, the person may suffer from a loss of money, damage to credit, a compromise of medical records, threats, and/or harassment. The individual may also suffer tremendous losses of time and money to address the damage. Other potential harms which may result from the compromise of an individual's PII include embarrassment, improper denial of government benefits, blackmail, and discrimination.\n\nLikewise, organizations may experience harm as a result of a loss of PII maintained by the organization. Harm may include administrative burden, remediation costs, financial losses, loss of public reputation and public trust, and legal liability.\n\nThe Privacy Act of 1974 as amended at 5 U.S.C. 552a, is a code of fair information practices which mandates how Federal agencies, like the Department of Defense, maintain personally identifiable information (PII), i.e., records that uniquely identify you. The basic provisions of the Act require government agencies to:\n\ncollect only information that is relevant and necessary to carry out an agency function;\n\nmaintain no secret records on you;\n\nexplain, at the time the information is being collected, why it is needed and how it will be used;\n\nensure that the records are used only for the reasons given, or seek your permission when another purpose for their use is considered necessary or desirable;\n\nprovide adequate safeguards to protect the records from unauthorized access and disclosure;\n\nallow you to see the records kept about you and provide you with the opportunity to correct inaccuracies in your records,\n\nallow you to find out about disclosures of your records to other agencies and persons.\n\nThe Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of these records without the written consent of the individual(s) to whom the records pertain unless one of the twelve disclosure exceptions enumerated in the Act applies. These records are held in Privacy Act 'systems of records.' A notice for each such system of records is published in the Federal Register. These notices identify the legal authority for collecting and storing the records, individuals about whom records will be collected, what kinds of information will be collected, and how the records will be used.\n\nThe Privacy Act binds only Federal agencies, and covers only records in the possession and control of Federal agencies.\n\nA system of records notice (SORN) is a description of any Privacy Act system of records. SORNs generally describe the 'who, what, where, and why' of a system and describe the processes for individuals to access or contest the information being held on them in that system. SORNs are required to be published in the Federal Register for a period of public comment before the system data collection (paper based or electronic) is started.\n\nIf you receive a notification from DoD that there has been an actual or suspected compromise of your personal information, directly contact the office sending the letter. Note that you should never give out your personal information, such as a Social Security number or financial account number over the phone unless you are certain that you are speaking with an official DoD representative. If you have any concerns over the authenticity of such a notice, contact the specific privacy office to verify.\n\nWhen a Federal agency requests that you provide personal information (name, date of birth, social security number, etc) for a system of records, regardless of the method used to collect the information (i.e., forms, personal or telephonic interview, etc), a Privacy Act Statement (PAS) is required. If the information requested will not be included in a system of records, a PAS is not required."
