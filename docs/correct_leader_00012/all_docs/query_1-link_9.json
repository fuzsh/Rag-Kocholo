        "text": "Gifts and Items Sent to the Prime Minister and His Family\n\nMany Canadians choose to offer gifts to the Prime Minister and his family. These are kind and generous gestures. However, the Trudeau family believes that this goodwill would be better directed toward community, charity, and family.\n\nAdditionally, security regulations and the Federal Accountability Act passed in 2006 prevent and preclude the Prime Minister and his family from accepting many gifts. All monetary gifts and gift certificates will be returned to the sender. Some items, such as perishable goods, cannot be accepted for security reasons. Other items may be severely damaged due to security screening processes. We would be very disappointed to learn that any item of personal value was damaged as a result of these measures and ask that you refrain from sending these valuables.\n\nFinally, we would ask that you consider the impact your efforts could have for those in need across Canada. The Prime Minister and his family would be heartened to know that you are focusing your generosity as a volunteer or benefactor of a dedicated charitable organization.\n\nPrivacy"
