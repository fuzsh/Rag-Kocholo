        "text": "The biggest night of Justin Trudeau's political life is about to unfold, with his job on the line as he seeks a parliamentary majority. But first, who is the Liberal leader and what change has he brought to the country since 2015?\n\nThe 49-year-old hopes to lead his party into a third term in office, after two years dominated by the public health crisis.\n\nAfter that stunning rise to power six years ago, his first term and the realities of governing took the shine off his reputation as a beacon for the left.\n\nHe narrowly won a second term, but the 2019 election saw his power reduced.\n\nTwo years later this snap election could provide him with the mandate he seeks - or be his downfall.\n\nWhen Justin Trudeau was just four months old, then-US President Richard Nixon predicted the infant would one day follow in his father's footsteps.\n\nAt a gala dinner during a state visit to Ottawa in 1972, Mr Nixon addressed his Canadian counterpart: \"Tonight we'll dispense with the formalities. I'd like to toast the future prime minister of Canada: to Justin Pierre Trudeau.\"\n\nAccording to CBC, the elder Trudeau responded that should his son ever lead the country, \"I hope he has the grace and skill of the president.\"\n\nWhile Mr Nixon's political career, of course, ended in disgrace, Mr Trudeau went on to dominate Canadian politics until the mid-1980s, provoking passionate and polarising opinions.\n\nHis first election in 1968 inspired a frenzied fandom among young voters that became known as \"Trudeaumania\". And his administration included many historic accomplishments like making both French and English the official languages of the federal government.\n\nJustin lived much of his childhood in the public eye. The family's security detail gave him the codename \"Maple 3\".\n\nBut as he grew up he shied away from politics. He attended McGill University then the University of British Columbia, where he earned a degree in education. He became a teacher.\n\nIn 1998, his youngest brother Michel was killed in an avalanche in British Columbia. That tragedy forced him into the public spotlight and he became a spokesman for avalanche safety.\n\nWhen his father died two years later at the age 80, Mr Trudeau delivered the eulogy at the nationally televised funeral. His speech was widely praised and led many to ponder his potential for public office for the first time.\n\nHe married his wife Sophie Gregoire, a Quebecois television and radio reporter, in 2004. They have three children.\n\nMr Trudeau became more politically active following his father's death. He won the Liberal nomination in the Papineau riding in 2007 and became MP in 2008. Even at this early point he was seen as leadership material for the Liberal party.\n\nHe was re-elected as MP in 2011.\n\nAfter declining to run for leadership of the Liberal party several times, Mr Trudeau finally declared his intention to run in 2012. During the campaign, he was criticised by his opponents for his inexperience and lack of policy positions - the same line of attack used in this general election campaign - but won the position in a landslide in 2013.\n\nThe pandemic was his big test - it's been a tough 18 months for the country. His worst period was when the vaccinations got over to a terribly slow start but Canada now has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world.\n\nWhen he called the election it looked like the country was past the worst but then the Delta took hold again and his party's popularity took a hit.\n\nIf the Liberals don't win the 15 extra seats needed for a majority, questions will be raised about Trudeau's future."
