        "text": "Pierre Trudeau, who has died of prostate cancer aged 80, was Canada's most intellectual and flamboyant prime minister. His disdain for Quebec nationalism, belief in a bilingual, multicultural federation and commitment to the constitutional entrenchment of civic rights and freedoms were the hallmarks of his 17 years in government.\n\nElected to the Canadian parliament in 1965, he rose meteorically to the leadership of the Liberal party in 1968. He won three successive general elections, lost to the Conservatives in 1979, then led the Liberals back to power in 1980. In his final government, he secured a clear No vote in Quebec's first referendum on sovereignty-association, and entrenched Canada's constitution with a charter of rights and freedoms.\n\nTrudeau was born in Montreal in 1919 - a date confirmed only after he won the Liberal leadership, claiming to be a year younger than he was. His mother had Scottish and French-Canadian roots. His father was pur laine Québécois, an ambitious Montreal lawyer from a long line of unilingual peasant-farmers. Though his early death traumatised Pierre, his shrewd business deals secured the family a $1m fortune.\n\nBy all accounts, Trudeau was a competitive young man, encouraged by his father to achieve athletic prowess and educated with disciplined intensity at Brébuf, the Jesuit college for Quebec's francophone elite. Physically and intellectually agile, he had a need to win or have the final word.\n\nAfter completing law school in 1943 - while campaigning against conscription - and articling for a year in Montreal, he took courses in political economy at Harvard, the Sorbonne and the London School of Economics, where he mastered ideas of constitutional liberalism, Parisian personalism and British Fabianism, before heading home via a year-long journey through the Middle East and Asia.\n\nBack in Quebec in 1949, Trudeau was shocked to find Quebec gripped by the regressive, Catholic nationalism that underscored Maurice Duplessis's corrupt Union Nationale govern- ment. Gerard Pelletier, a journalist he befriended in Paris, invited him to witness an asbestos workers' strike, an event that reinforced Trudeau's determination to oppose Duplessis and brought him and Pelletier into contact with the union leader, Jean Marchand, for the first time.\n\nLike many Quebec intellectuals who loathed Duplessis, Trudeau escaped to Ottawa and a junior job in the Privy Council Office preparing background material for constitutional conferences. He found the federal capital dull, and its bureaucracy patronising to French-Canadians, so returned to Quebec in 1951, worked as a civil liberties lawyer for the labour movement and edited a collection, The Asbestos Strike, challenging Duplessis. Consequently blocked from an academic law position at the Université de Montréal, he co-founded Cité Libre, a journal that called for reason over nationalist passion. Federalism, by virtue of bringing diverse ethnic groups into a single state, he argued, would allow Frenchness to thrive in Canada.\n\nDuplessis died in 1959 and Quebec underwent a quiet revolution. The provincial Liberals won the 1960 election and created a welfare state to replace the Catholic church in healthcare and education. While most Quebec intellectuals welcomed this period, Trudeau used the university post he quickly acquired to attack the secular neo-nationalism of the Quebec state and the separatist movement it spawned. On November 5 1965, he stood with Marchand and Pelletier in the federal election, determined to address the French-Canadian question from Ottawa.\n\nHad the Quebec wing of the Liberal party been stronger, and Prime Minister Lester Pearson not been facing nationalist militancy in the province, the three men might have had fewer opportunities to influence the debate. As it was, in December 1965, Marchand persuaded Pearson to make Trudeau his parliamentary secretary, a job that gave him status within the Quebec caucus, access to the centres of government power and the international experience of travelling through the Francophonie to build support against Quebec separatism. In April 1967, Trudeau entered Pearson's cabinet as justice minister.\n\nIt was the centennial summer, when President de Gaulle, touring Canada, called for \"Le Québec Libre\". But the erudite bachelor Trudeau, who rode a Harley-Davidson and wore sandals in the legislature, worked through it, doggedly revising the criminal code. He modernised laws on divorce, homosexuality and abortion, arguing that \"the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation\".\n\nPrecisely what went on in Trudeau's own bedroom was always a subject of speculation. His extended bachelorhood and homosexual law reform encouraged rumours. But it was his liaisons with women that inverted his mantra of \"reason over passion\". There was nightclubbing at Commonwealth conferences, an affair with Barbra Streisand, and his secret marriage in 1971 to Margaret Sinclair, a beautiful, west coast flower child of a former cabinet minister. Some 30 years his junior, she bore him three children, helped win the 1974 election and then rebelled with doped-out indiscretions.\n\nTrudeaumania took root in February 1968, when he announced his candidacy for the Liberal leadership, soon after a televised showdown with Quebec's premier. He was the only French-Canadian running to head a party that alternates between francophone and anglophone leaders. His charisma and ability to reason clearly in both languages appealed at a time when Quebec tensions were, quite literally, exploding in mail-boxes around Montreal. Canadians adored this sexy genius, who wanted to create a \"just society\".\n\nOn April 6 1968, after four ballots and seven-and-a-half hours of voting, Trudeau set out to rebuild Canada in his own image... \"this beautiful, rich and energetic country of ours can become a model in which every citizen will enjoy his fundamental rights, in which two great linguistic communities and people of many cultures will live in harmony and in which every individual will find fulfilment.\" Three weeks later, sworn in as Canada's 15th prime minister, he called a general election and, on June 25 1968, the day after nationalist demonstrators stoned him in Montreal, he secured the first federal Liberal majority since 1953.\n\nTrudeau set Canada on as independent a foreign policy course as possible in north America, opening diplomatic relations with China and reducing Canada's commitment to Nato. But his primary concerns were to counter Quebec nationalism, build national unity, overhaul government and ensure Canada's constitutional decolonisation.\n\nThe 1969 Official Languages Act was his key response to state-centred nationalism in Quebec. It institutionalised bilingualism, created a federal bureaucracy that employs French-Canadians at every level, and delivers services in French and English. The strategy aimed to attract bright young francophones to work in Ottawa, not Quebec, and ensure that the provincial francophone majority, and the francophone minorities elsewhere, identified with the federal state.\n\nLike so many of Trudeau's ideas, it was brilliant in principle but problematic in practice. It granted individual rights and new employment opportunities to French-Canadians, reduced the domination of anglophone mandarins in Ottawa, but failed to counter Quebec nationalism's mystical appeal or anticipate the backlash. Although Trudeau tried to enhance national unity with a department of regional and economic expansion, he never undercut the resentment that citizens west of Winnipeg felt about his obsession with Quebec. Trudeau restructured the cabinet committee system, expanded the prime minister's office, and engaged the Liberal party in a massive, exercise of policy innovation, establishing task forces on everything. Though designed to build policy on liberal principles and encourage participation in his \"just society\", these measures frustrated the party faithful, who were used to brokerage politics, and irritated the electorate when policymaking took too damn long.\n\nTrudeau's rationality was fundamentally challenged on October 5 1970, when the terrorist Front de Libération du Québec (FLQ) kidnapped James Cross, the British trade commisioner in Montreal. Five days later, the FLQ abducted (and later murdered) the Quebec labour minister, Pierre Laporte. Urged on by Quebec's liberal premier, Robert Bourassa, Trudeau took the drastic step of invoking the War Measures Act in peacetime.\n\nHis popularity soared, but the promoter of civil liberties had put the military on the streets, suspended habeas corpus and legitimised massive arrests of FLQ suspects. Civil libertarians and Quebec nationalists never forgave him.\n\nWhen Trudeau called a general election in 1972 - with the slogan \"The Land is Strong\" - his campaign strategy proved weak. The love-in was over, and unemployment had soared. In his drive to bilingualise Canada, calm insurrection in Quebec, and overhaul Ottawa, he had forgotten to oil the party machine, failed to curb inflation and dismissed the bilingual backlash as bigotry. The Liberals scraped back to power with 109 seats, against the Tories' 107, and Trudeau formed a minority government with support from the New Democratic party (NDP).\n\nTrudeau, the pragmatist, now surrounded himself with professional party men. His speeches became emotional, his contacts with the party faithful more personal, and policy implementation was faster as deals were forged with the NDP. Pensions and family allowances increased, and the Foreign Investment Review Agency was created to boost economic sovereignty. After two years, he went back to the electorate with Margaret at his side, and the Liberals secured a majority third term.\n\nAlthough Trudeau and his cabinet reverted to protracted planning exercises, creating a new tax structure to redistribute resources from richer to poorer provinces, he ensured Canada's entry to the G7 group and initiated trade contracts with the EEC, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific rim. Petro-Canada was created to placate westerners and, in 1978, the Canadian Human Rights Commission was established to root out discrimination. But inflation and unemployment spiralled as the Liberals found themselves unable to cope with the impact of the 1973 oil crisis.\n\nIn October 1976, they reversed their election promise, established the Anti-Inflation Board and imposed wage and price controls. To cap it all, in November 1976, Trudeau's old rival, René Lèvesque, led the nationalist Parti Québécois (PQ) to victory in the provincial election, determined to seek a new sovereign-association between Quebec and Canada. PQ's victory re-energised Trudeau's fight against nationalism, but by now Margaret was against him. She spent their sixth wedding anniversary at a Rolling Stones concert, and told People magazine that her nipple outlines excited state visitors. Two months later, the couple separated.\n\nIn May 1979, the Liberals' inability to boost the Canadian economy brought Joe Clark's Conservatives to minority government. Trudeau was shattered and, in November, he announced his retirement.\n\nBut it was not the end. Three weeks later, the Conservative government was defeated. Trudeau stayed on, and, in February 1980, won another majority government. In that final term, there was the second oil crisis, an intensification of energy battles with western Canada and new tensions in the US-Canadian relationship after Ronald Reagan won the presidency. But the May 1980 Quebec referendum produced a clear 60-40 victory for the federalists, and a historic battle between Levesque and Trudeau.\n\nFor Levesque it was horrendous. If the Conservatives had stayed in power, his social-democratic government would have had an easier time promoting sovereignty-association. But Trudeau's icy logic exposed sovereignty association as a weak compromise that would ensure Quebec's eventual secession. Days before the plebiscite, he promised Quebeckers that if they voted No he would renew the constitution.\n\nHe did just that. On May 21 1980, he set about getting the constitution patriated from Britain. Over lunch at Downing Street, he informed Mrs Thatcher that the Canadian constitution was coming home - although neither she, nor her advisers, had enough understanding of Canadian constitutional politics to anticipate what followed.\n\nIn October 1980, having failed yet again to get the provincial premiers to agree on a constitutional amendment formula, Trudeau announced that he was taking unilateral action on a \"people's package\" to patriate the constitution and entrench it with a charter of rights. He was challenged by three provinces in the Canadian supreme court, who all used provincial diplomats in London to lobby British backbenchers.\n\nIn September 1981, the supreme court decided that although Trudeau's initiative was constitutionally legitimate, it betrayed conventions which held that the majority of premiers should agree to constitutional amendments. On November 5 1981, 16 years to the day that Trudeau was first elected to parliament, the federal government and nine provinces came to a patriation deal that Quebec would not sign.\n\nAboriginal leaders were livid, claiming that their contract with the Crown had been negated. But the process for patriating Canada's constitution, complete with a charter of rights and a clause allowing governments to opt out of certain sections for five years at a time, went ahead in Westminster. On April 17 1982, in pouring rain, the Queen and Trudeau signed the proclamation of a new Canadian constitution and the Quebec government was bound by a charter it loathed.\n\nIn many senses, Trudeau had won his battle against Quebec nationalism. He had overseen the creation of a charter that will have a lasting impact on Canadian jurisprudence, but he had not managed to create the pan-Canadian nation-building instrument that would fully clarify the relationship between all Canadians and the federal state.\n\nTwo years later, he left office and found a perch in a Montreal law firm. He raised his sons, produced a self-justifying memoire, canoed his heart out and fathered a daughter by the constitutional lawyer, Deborah Coyne. He read lots, wrote less and travelled more.\n\nHe re-emerged in full force in 1987 and 1991 to speak out against new constitutional proposals to recognise Quebec as a distinct society, a stance that won him some respect in western Canada, but rekindled nationalist loathing in Quebec. Indeed, in October 1995, when Prime Minister Jean Chrétien staged a desperate, mass-Canadian rally in Montreal to save Canada from its closest call ever in the second Quebec referendum, Trudeau, the man who had championed federalism all his life, was asked to stay away.\n\nHe kept custody of his three sons Justin, Sacha, and Michel after his separation and later divorce. Michel died in a skiing accident in 1998. His other two sons and daughter survive him.\n\nAnnis May Timpson\n\nJoseph Phillippe Pierre Yves Elliot Trudeau, politician, born October 18 1919; died September 28 2000"
