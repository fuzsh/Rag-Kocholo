Jean Carroll's legal efforts against Trump. The two civil trials resulted in a judge ruling that Trump owed Carroll more than $88 million in damages for sexual abuse and defamation.\n\n— Jake Piazza\n\nTrump lands in Milwaukee for RNC\n\nPatrick T.

Josh Shapiro earlier Sunday, who had spoken with his family. The governor said his family wanted to let the public know that Comperatore \"died a hero\" by using his body as a shield to protect them at the rally.\n\n\"These victims and their families are certainly in our thoughts today,\" State Commissioner Colonel Christopher Paris said. \"The Pennsylvania State Police continue to work tirelessly alongside our federal, state and local partners as this investigation continues.\"\n\n— Rebecca Picciotto\n\nSecret Service says RNC security plan is unchanged, firearms allowed in outer perimeter\n\nScott Olson | Getty Images\n\nThe Secret Service will not change its security plan for the Republican National Convention, despite the alleged assassination attempt Saturday.\n\n\"There have been no changes to our current operational security plans for this event,\" Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, the RNC coordinator for the Secret Service, said at a Sunday press conference, adding that the plan has been developed over 18 months and has been designated the highest level of security.\n\n\"We are confident in these security plans that are in place for this event and we're ready to go.\"\n\nFirearms will not be allowed inside the convention, nor within the Secret Service's security perimeter. But outside of that perimeter, just blocks away from the GOP convention, firearms will be permitted.\n\nThe convention will take place from Monday to Thursday in Wisconsin, an open-carry state. As a result, the Secret Service said it did not have jurisdiction over firearm regulation outside of its outlined security perimeter and deferred to the state's law enforcement.\n\n\"We have to respect the Second Amendment right to carry your firearm,\" Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman said at the press conference. \"As that is your right, please exercise your right in a responsible manner.\"\n\n\"The Milwaukee Police Department will not tolerate any particular behaviors outside of what is legally allowed in regards to that right,\" Norman added.\n\n— Rebecca Picciotto\n\nRehab center where gunman worked said his record was 'clean'\n\nRebecca Droke | Afp | Getty Images\n\nA Bethel Park rehab facility said that the 20-year old gunman worked as its dietary aide, noting that his background check and job performance had never raised an alarm.\n\n\"We are shocked and saddened to learn of his involvement as Thomas Matthew Crooks performed his job without concern and his background check was clean,\" Marcie Grimm, an administrator at Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, the suspected shooter's employer, wrote in a statement.\n\nGrimm said that the facility is \"fully cooperating\" with law enforcement as the FBI continues its investigation.\n\n\"We condemn all acts of violence,\" Grimm wrote.\n\n— Rebecca Picciotto\n\nSuspected shooter pointed gun at municipal officer, sheriff says\n\nCarlos Osorio | Reuters\n\nMoments before the suspected shooter opened fire on former President Donald Trump, a municipal police officer confronted him, said Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Slupe in an interview with The Washington Post.\n\nThe officer lifted himself high enough to look onto the roof, Slupe said, and the suspected shooter pointed his gun at the peering officer. Slupe said the officer was holding the edge of the roof, so he was not holding his gun in his hand, and then dropped down.\n\nMoments later, the gunman opened fire on the rally, according to Slupe's account to The Washington Post.\n\n\"He lets go because he doesn't want to get killed,\" Slupe said to The Washington Post.\n\nThe officer from the roof was investigating an earlier report of a suspicious individual, according to the Washington Post.\n\n— Jake Piazza\n\nCNBC's Joe Kernen speaks with former President Trump\n\nBrendan Mcdermid | Reuters\n\nCNBC Squawk Box anchor Joe Kernen spoke with former President Trump on Sunday, according to Kernen's post on X.\n\n\"He asked me to pass on to all that he's doing great and is gratified by all the encouragement and support, from both sides of the aisle,\" Kernen wrote, adding, \"He was in amazing spirits, added he has a little problem with his right ear but was glad he turned his head at the last minute.\"\n\nKernen called in to MSNBC with Katy Tur shortly afterward and recapped the roughly three-minute conversation.\n\nTrump told Kernen he received calls from both sides of the aisle, including from some people he did not expect to hear from.\n\n— Jake Piazza\n\nFBI says shooter was a 'lone actor' based on investigation so far, confirms weapon type\n\nKevin Lamarque | Reuters\n\nThe FBI agents investigating the Trump assassination attempt said the suspected gunman acted alone but that there are still many questions that need to be answered.\n\n\"At this point the investigation, it appears that he was a lone actor,\" FBI executive assistant director Robert Wells said during a call with reporters, noting that the investigation is still in its early phases.\n\nKevin Rojek, the FBI special agent leading the investigation, said that the bureau has confirmed that the suspected shooter used an AR-style 556 rifle, which was purchased legally.\n\nMany questions remain as the investigation continues.\n\nRojek added that they have not yet \"identified an ideology\" associated with the gunman and that the FBI is still working to piece together the timeline of the events leading up to the assassination attempt.\n\nThe FBI said it had searched the suspected gunman's vehicle and that it is working to get full access to his phone and social media accounts, in order to understand his motive and the sequence of events leading up to the shooting.\n\nDuring the vehicle search, Rojek said, the FBI found a \"suspicious device\" that was inspected by bomb technicians. The device is still under analysis.\n\nThe FBI officials noted that they are also keeping tabs on the fallout of the events and monitoring the upcoming Republican and Democratic conventions. The FBI said it has not so far identified any existing public safety concerns related to this shooting's aftermath.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray were also on the call and extended their condolences to the shooting victims.\n\n\"Our hearts are with them and with those critically injured and their families,\" Garland said.\n\nWray said the bureau has dedicated the \"full force of the FBI to this investigation.\" That includes criminal and national security teams, tactical support, teams to process crime scene evidence, victim services, specialists, the FBI lab and its operational technology division, he said.\n\nThe FBI officials said it has received over 2,600 tips so far, each of which the bureau plans to investigate. They reiterated that the public should report any knowledge of the situation to their tip line at 1-800-CALLFBI (1-800-225-5324) or online at fbi.gov/butler.\n\n— Rebecca Picciotto\n\nHow the Trump assassination attempt could impact the Republican National Convention\n\nJoe Raedle | Getty Images\n\nThe reported attempted assassination of Donald Trump, just two days before the Republican National Convention kicks off, will likely supercharge the emotional energy of what was already expected to be an intense four-day bout of Trump fanfare.\n\n\"When he [Trump] walks in that arena for the first time, the decibel level will be so high it will be almost unmeasurable,\" Corey Lewandowski, a close Trump ally who is advising the RNC, said Sunday.\n\nAside from the elevated emotional intensity, the general structure and schedule of the Milwaukee convention is set to remain the same, Wisconsin GOP Chair Brian Schimming said in a press conference, noting that he had spoken with RNC Chair Michael Whatley.\n\nThat schedule includes the highly-anticipated announcement of Trump's vice presidential pick, which is expected Wednesday.\n\nIn a Truth Social post Sunday, Trump said he was looking forward to addressing the nation from the convention in Wisconsin. Later Sunday, he was en route to the Badger State.\n\nThe RNC has over 80 names on its speaker lineup, including former GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley, who on Sunday accepted her invitation to speak.
