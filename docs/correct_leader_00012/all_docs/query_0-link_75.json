        "text": "The 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution, passed in the 1940s, limited the President to two 4-year terms. Franklin Roosevelt was the only President to serve more than 8 years (1933-1945). In Canada, however, there is no limit to the length of time the Prime Minister can stay in office. William Lyon Mackenzie King currently holds the record for the longest serving Prime Minister, at more than 21 years. Macdonald, Trudeau, and Laurier all served more than 15 years each. On the other end of the scale, Sir Charles Tupper and John Turner both served for just over two months.\n\nIt also may be interesting to note here that five of Canada's Prime Ministers died in office or as Members of Parliament after being Prime Minister.\n\nRankPrime MinisterDates of OfficeLength of Term 1.The Right Honourable William Lyon Mackenzie King29 Dec 1921 - 28 Jun 1926\n\n25 Sep 1926 - 7 Aug 1930\n\n23 Oct 1935 - 15 Nov 19487824 days\n\n21 years, 5 months, and 1 day 2.The Right Honourable Sir John A.
