        "text": "The head of the PMO is granted virtually uninhibited access to the Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers. He or she oversees the activities of the Prime Minister’s staff, and can also serve as an important political adviser. In addition, the head of the PMO has the duty of liaising with the Privy Council Office (PCO), and attends the weekly meetings of the PCO’s senior staff as the representative of the PMO.\n\nThe functions served by the PMO, itself, have greatly evolved over time. In the ministries which followed Confederation, the Prime Minister’s secretaries mainly fulfilled basic service roles, such as responding to routine correspondence. In more recent times, with the institutionalization of the PMO, the raison d’être of the PMO and its staff has expanded to include a wider variety of tasks, including the provision of policy advice, information gathering, communications, planning, and strategizing.\n\nSOURCES\n\nBiographies of Prime Ministers, popular and academic books on Canadian politics.\n\nMemo from Jack Pickersgill.\n\nInterviews with:\n\nE.A. Pickering (King)\n\nJack Granatstein (King)\n\nGordon Roberston (Pearson Marc Lalonde)\n\nProfessor Waite (Thompson)\n\n*Huguette Fournier (Pearson, Lalonde)\n\nTom Kent (Pearson)\n\n*(Marc Lalonde's Secretary, Montréal - Office of Stikeman & Elliot.)"
