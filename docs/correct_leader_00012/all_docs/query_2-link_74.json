        "text": "Each year the Veterans Day National Committee publishes a commemorative Veterans Day poster. The Committee selects a poster from artwork submitted by artists nationwide. It also distributes the winning design to VA facilities, military installations around the world, and across cities and towns in our nation. It then serves as the cover of the official program for the Veterans Day Observance at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nOver the years these posters have illustrated the rich history of our country’s service men and women. The poster reflects our pride and patriotism in saluting Veterans while providing the thematic artistry for the year.\n\nThe theme for Veterans Day 2024 is “A Legacy of Loyalty and Service.” Veterans are proud of their military service in defending our Nation. Honor reflects the military value and tradition of answering the call to duty. There is distinct honor in serving to protect our way of life and the Constitution of the United States of America. We encourage artists to consider Veteran history of loyalty and service to our Nation and the honor we owe them for fulfilling patriotic duties.\n\nThe Veterans Day National Committee (VDNC) is made of almost 50 Veteran Serving Organizations that oversee national planning and coordination of the Veterans Day observance.\n\nNon-profit Veterans organizations that are national in scope, of good reputation, in existence and involved with Veterans for a minimum of five (5) years, and dedicated to a wide range of Veteran’s issues can apply for Associate Membership on the Veterans Day National Committee.\n\nVDNC History and Membership\n\nVDNC By-laws\n\nHistory of Veterans Day\n\nVeterans Day Facts\n\nFor questions and more information about Veterans Day Observances, please contact the Veterans Day Coordinator."
