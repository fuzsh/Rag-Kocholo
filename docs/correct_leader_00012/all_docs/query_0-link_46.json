        "text": "In Canada, there has been much fretting about how the nation’s just-ended federal-election campaign was its longest and most expensive, and how it was sullied by negative advertising from Stephen Harper’s Conservative Party, all of which made it seem troublingly American. Now there’s another parallel: Canada has its first Prime Ministerial dynasty, with Justin Trudeau following his father, Pierre, in the office. (One un-American thing: Trudeau’s Liberal Party won by outflanking the leftist New Democratic Party on the left, brazenly promising to run budget deficits and spend billions on infrastructure.) Trudeau, who is forty-three, has led the Liberals for two and a half years, and until recently he was viewed by critics as “not ready”—as Trudeau Lite. (Or, possibly, on the basis of photos taken at the weigh-in for a charity boxing match and since gone viral, as Paul Ryan Plus.) Trudeau himself invited comparison with his father, in 2013, when he tweeted a GIF of himself and his wife, Sophie Grégoire, dancing backstage before a campaign speech for the Party leadership. It was a likably antic moment, but it couldn’t compete with Pierre Trudeau’s pirouettes, particularly the one he executed during a G-7 Summit, at Buckingham Palace, when the Queen wasn’t looking.\n\nSome observers began speculating about a political role for Justin in 2000, when, as a twenty-eight-year-old secondary-school teacher, he delivered a dramatic eulogy at his father’s televised state funeral. (The honorary pallbearers included Jimmy Carter, Fidel Castro, and Leonard Cohen.) But the first person to predict that he would succeed his father was, of all people, Richard Nixon. At a state dinner in Ottawa, in 1972, when Justin was just a few months old, Nixon raised a glass of champagne to “the future Prime Minister of Canada.” Pierre Trudeau had been elected in 1968, atop a wave of “Trudeaumania,” and suddenly, around the world, Canada became synonymous with cool, for reasons other than the weather. The first couple of the counterculture, John (of Beatlemania fame) and Yoko, were much taken with the new leader. He was, Ono said, “more beautiful than we expected.” Lennon added, “If all politicians were like Mr. Trudeau, there would be world peace.” The Prime Minister replied, in what may be interpreted as an archetype for the “don’t-do-stupid-stuff” policy formulation, “I must say that ‘give peace a chance’ has always seemed to me to be sensible advice.”\n\nTrudeau undercut his own image early on. In October, 1970, the Quebec Liberation Front kidnapped James Cross, a British diplomat, and murdered Pierre Laporte, a Quebec cabinet minister. Trudeau responded by invoking the War Measures Act. Civil liberties were suspended, separatists were arrested, and troops were deployed in the streets. Outside Parliament, in a remarkable confrontation with a journalist who complained that Canada risked becoming a “police state,” Trudeau said, “There’s a lot of bleeding hearts around who just don’t like to see people with helmets and guns. All I can say is, Go on and bleed.” The reporter asked, “At any cost? How far would you go with that? How far would you extend that?” Trudeau’s famous answer: “Just watch me.” The public overwhelmingly supported his action, but his hard stance didn’t seem to impress the law-and-order stalwart Nixon, who, Ottawa toast notwithstanding, called Trudeau a “son of a bitch” and “a pompous egghead” on the Watergate tapes.\n\nThe “October Crisis” passed, though Quebec separatism remained a problem for Trudeau, who championed a bilingual, multicultural, and unified Canada.\n\nAnd, as he sought to liberalize Canadian society—he is credited most prominently with advancing the Charter of Rights and Freedoms—he never lost the pugnacious edge. He clashed with the press and with protesters, and lobbed an obscenity at Conservative M.P.s, in what became known as the “fuddle-duddle” affair. Justin Trudeau acknowledged both sides of his father in his eulogy, when he said, “Many people say he didn't suffer fools gladly, but I’ll have you know he had infinite patience with us.” He then told a story about how, when he was eight years old, he went to a restaurant with his father, where he spotted one of his father’s rivals and told a nasty joke about him. He said, “My father looked at me sternly with that look I would learn to know so well, and said, ‘Justin, never attack the individual. We can be in total disagreement with someone without denigrating them as a consequence.’ ”\n\nPierre Trudeau was Prime Minister for fifteen years; he was voted out of office in 1979, but was returned the following year, and served again until 1984, when he chose to step down. (A reporter asked, “Will you miss this?” His reply: “No.”) Having split from his wife, Margaret, Trudeau turned his attention to raising his children, publicly intervening only on occasion to safeguard his legacy.\n\nThis week, Justin Trudeau took the Liberal Party from third place in the polls to win the election, and he will lead a majority government. His platform includes fighting climate change (although he does not oppose the Keystone Pipeline), legalizing marijuana, reforming the criminal-justice system, and working to right wrongs perpetrated against First Nation people. After the cold incumbency of the Harper government, Trudeau is aiming to make Canada cool again."
