Famous British comedy actor John Cleese is fuming over his divorce settlement, according to an article on Sky News Online. The actor, who was married for 16 years to psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger, is being forced to pay close to $20 million over the course of 7 years in the divorce settlement.

The settlement calls for Cleese to pay Eichelberger £8m in cash and assets, which includes an apartment in New York and £2m mews house in Holland Park, west London. Eichelberger will also receive £600,000 a year for seven years. This will leave Cleese a £10m fortune.

Cleese is said to be upset over the size of the divorce settlement, being quoted as saying:

“What I find so unfair is that if we both died today, her children would get much more than mine,”

Here we have the very sad story of a man who has worked in the entertainment industry for 40 years and is now being forced to give away more than half of his assets to his ex-wife. When they met in 1990, Eichelberger was living in a third floor council flat in London with her two sons from a previous marriage.

While most of us do not have a net worth of tens of millions of dollars, we all work very hard nevertheless for the income and luxuries we have amassed. That hard work, and the futures of our children, should not be put into jeopardy due to an outrageous divorce settlement. Stories like these are strong arguments for pre-nuptial agreements. For those that have been married without them, their best defense against outrageous divorce settlements is an experienced California divorce attorney like those at Wallin & Klarich.
