        "text": "John Cleese? Who mentioned John Cleese? That's right, John Cleese did. In fact, he can't shut up about him.\n\nAt first, when Alyce Faye Eichelberger was awarded $20 million in her divorce from the Python star, it seemed rather a lot. They had only been married for nine years, they had no children in common and previously, Miss Eichelberger was living in a third-floor council flat. It was, obviously, another example of the ludicrous injustice of the American divorce laws.\n\nCleese has now embarked on a new tour – \"How To Finance Your Divorce\" – in which he rubbishes his ex-wife, and provokes untold hilarity by calculating how many other women he could have got for that money, and how much each intimate marital moment set him back. And when not on stage, he's on Twitter, tweeting – naturally – about himself.\n\nShould he commit suicide on his 70th birthday, he asked, and how? No topic is too dark, as long as it revolves around the lodestar that is himself.\n\nMiss Eichelberger is a psychotherapist, so she may have already picked up that we might have a little dose of egomania here, with complications caused by a touch of monomania. And a spot of sexism? Just possibly."
