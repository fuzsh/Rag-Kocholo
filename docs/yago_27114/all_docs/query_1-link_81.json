        "text": "Comedy legend John Cleese will be bringing his Alimony Tour\n\nto The Lowry and the Liverpool Empire later this month. Best known for his idiosyncratic turns in Monty Python’s Flying Circus and Fawlty Towers, Cleese is bringing his unique comedic perspective to audiences across the UK.\n\nThe comedian’s marriage to his third wife Alyce Faye Eichelberger\n\nended in 2008 and Cleese claims the tour will fund his alimony. The\n\ndivorce settlement is believed to be in the region of £12 million.\n\nCleese’s career started as a sketch writer for BBC Radio’s Dick Emery Show and then The Frost Report.\n\nMonty Python was created with Cleese co-writing and starring in four\n\nseries and three films. He went on to achieve further great success as\n\nthe neurotic hotel manager Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers, which he co-wrote with then wife Connie Booth.\n\nAfter huge UK success Cleese went on to crack the USA with A Fish Called Wanda, which he wrote and starred in with Jamie Lee Curtis. The late 1990s saw thim appear in Bond movies The World is Not Enough and later Die Another Day.\n\nFrom writing to starring in plays, musicals, theatrical and comedy\n\nproductions, to films and sitcoms, Cleese has done it all, and now he\n\nplans to tell all about his jam-packed life.\n\nCleese says “it\n\nis an evening of well honed anecdotes, psychoanalytical tit-bits,\n\ndetails of recent surgical procedures, and unprovoked attacks on former\n\ncolleagues, especially Michael Palin”."
