        "text": "John Cleese has a timely reason for coming to San Diego to perform his one-man show Wednesday night at the Spreckels Theatre. He wants — no, needs — your money.\n\n“I have to pay a million dollars a year in alimony until I’m 76,” said the 70-year-old comedian, film actor and author. “After that, I think I’ll have more time to do other things I want to do.”\n\nTo the casual observer, this may sound like the punch line to a sketch from Cleese’s days as a member of the pioneering English comedy troupe Monty Python, which in September celebrated the 40th anniversary of the debut of its enormously influential BBC TV series.\n\nOr, perhaps, an especially droll outtake from his tenure as Basil Fawlty, the famously ill-tempered innkeeper on the TV series “Fawlty Towers,” which debuted in 1975 and has just been released in an expanded DVD package.\n\nGuess again.\n\nTo hear Cleese tell it, his now third ex-wife, American psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger, was awarded a $13 million divorce settlement from him this year. That does not include the $1 million a year in alimony he must pay her through 2015.\n\nCleese being Cleese, this unfortunate (at least for him) turn of events was pivotal in inspiring his ongoing solo tour. Billed as “A Final Wave at the World,” his series of solo shows is subtitled “The Alimony Tour, Part One.”\n\nUnder any name, the tour may be a prelude to a book he is now contemplating writing, tentatively titled “May Divorce Be With You.” He also hopes to soon begin work with his daughter, Camilla, on a musical version of “A Fish Called Wanda,” the hit 1988 film comedy he co-wrote.\n\n“Although I’ve accrued a lot of wealth and lost a lot of wives — or ex-wives — I’ve never been particularly interested in money. I just want to have enough,” said Cleese, whose law degree from Cambridge University was apparently of little use in negotiating his latest divorce settlement.\n\n“Just ‘having enough’ was not true when I was living with Alyce, because I got such a luxurious lifestyle that I was feeding the beast most of the time. It’s been nice to get out of that place. When I was married to Alyce, I didn’t have time to stop and write anything (very meaningful), as I was used to taking the next job to make money.”\n\nThis does not, he hastens to add, apply to the “an evening with”-styled solo tour that brings him to San Diego.\n\n“I actually enjoy doing this show,” said the native of Weston-super-Mare, a seaside resort town in Somerset, England. “I have to earn money and can’t think of a more pleasant way of doing it. At the end of the evening, I do some Q&A, which is pretty spontaneous and I frequently have no idea where I’m going when I start to answer. The infuriating thing is, that’s the part people like best, not the stuff that’s been carefully honed.”\n\nCleese’s costly failed marriage is also alluded to in the official description of his solo tour: “In which Professor, Doctor, Doctor Cleese will be discussing his career in the zany and hilarious world of comedy, as well as his most pressing medical problems, his inability to find a suitable female companion, his mistrust of folk-dancing, and his latest plan for world peace.”\n\nThe professor and double doctor designation is both whimsy and fact for Cleese, who has been awarded two honorary doctorates. Speaking from his Santa Barbara home, he cackled with glee about his status as a “phony professor” at Cornell University.\n\nMake that a bona fide “phony.”\n\nImprobable as it may seem to those who know him best for such classic Monty Python routines as “Dead Parrot,” “The Cheese Shop” and “Ministry of Silly Walks,” Cleese has been a professor-at-large at Cornell in upstate New York since 1998.\n\n“In my role as a visiting professor I’ve done a sermon, because I’m interested in certain aspects of religion,” he said. “I talk to the hotel management school, to actors, to psychology classes.”\n\nIt is perhaps the blessing and the curse of being John Cleese that the above statement, while delivered without a hint of irony, sounds like a surreal example of his life imitating his art, while skewing both at the same time.\n\n“I laugh more now than I did in Monty Python, because I was much more on edge and denying my own depression at the time,” he said. “As a result of doing a lot of what Americans call ‘work,’ I don’t carry depression now and I’m much more playful and lighthearted. But I don’t produce so much comedy material now.”\n\nThe son of an insurance salesman and his wife, Cleese was a rising TV comedy talent when he co-founded Monty Python in 1969 with Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, Graham Chapman and Terry Gilliam, the lone American member.\n\nThe TV series, which ran from 1969 to 1974, was followed by three popular feature films, including 1975’s “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” (a medieval spoof that Idle transformed in 2005 into the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical “Monty Python’s Spamalot”).\n\nEven without the success of “Spamalot,” Monty Python made an enduring global impact with its TV series, albums and live performances, which included sold-out shows at the 18,000-capacity Hollywood Bowl. The troupe’s fans range from fellow comics Jimmy Fallon and Russell Brand to actor Tom Hanks and hard-core punk-rock icon Henry Rollins.\n\n“Monty Python’s records were like food for me as a kid, because — after hearing them — you knew it was cool to be weird,” Rollins said.\n\n“I’d put on my Monty Python records before I went to high school each day in suburban Maryland. I had to have my insulation of John Cleese to be able walk through the place.”\n\nCleese left Monty Python after the first three seasons of its TV series because he felt repetition had set in and because Chapman, his main writing partner, had become “a fully fledged alcoholic.”\n\n“Did we know we were doing anything revolutionary?” Cleese mused. “Knowing it would be revolutionary means we knew how successful it would be, and I don’t think we had any pretensions to know it would be. When we started Monty Python, we didn’t know how many viewers we had. We just wanted to amuse.\n\n“We relied on simple response — Did the group laugh? — in which case it was in. If they did not laugh, it was out. Eric (Idle) said it was a very good process, because all these people in Monty Python were astute about comedy. The only person who gave me a better set of notes is when Steve Martin watched ‘A Fish Called Wanda.’ ”\n\nAh, yes, the hit comedy film that Cleese and his daughter will soon begin rewriting as a musical. Does he have any musical or choreographic talent?\n\n“None at all,” he replied. “So, we’ll do a musical with almost no dancing and with songs that are very short.”"
