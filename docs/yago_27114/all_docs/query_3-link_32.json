        "text": "Monty Python legend John Cleese has been quite open about his money woes in the past, but he’s finally a free man!\n\nThe comedian, who has been paying off a £12 million divorce settlement to third wife Alyce Faye Eichelberger for several years, has managed to pay off all of the alimony at last.\n\nJohn has admitted in the past he has taken on work he wouldn’t have otherwise done because he needed money to cover the six-figure monthly payouts.\n\nIn 2011, he toured the country in the aptly titled Alimony Tour. And he even cites money as one of his motivations for reuniting with the Pythons for a sell-out residency at London’s The O2 last year.\n\nBut it’s all change now, as John tells ShortList: “The past seven years I’ve been earning to pay off the alimony. But I’m now free to do things that interest me. I’ve adapted a Georges Feydeau farce called Bang Bang. There’s a good chance it will be on in the West End.”\n\nThe 76-year-old star has also revealed that he will NEVER work for the BBC again, despite starring in some of its most popular shows including Fawlty Towers.\n\nHe said: “There’s no way I want to work in TV, especially at the BBC. I have a nasty feeling a large proportion of the commissioning editors have no idea what they’re doing. I said this the other day, and a younger comic said, ‘No, there’s one at the BBC.’ Just the one.”"
