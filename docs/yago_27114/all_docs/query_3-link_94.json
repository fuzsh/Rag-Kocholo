        "text": "Comic John Cleese has seen his £2million-a-year maintenance payments to his ex-wife halved in the first celebrity credit crunch divorce.\n\nThe Monty Python legend’s fortune has taken a bashing in the recession.\n\nAnd a judge agreed to cut the £106,000 a month he was paying to his third wife Alyce Faye Eichelberger, 64, to £57,000.\n\nNow other crunch-hit celebs and tycoons could start a rush to appeal to have their own divorce settlements slashed.\n\nCleese, 69, bitterly attacked the original deal last May, claiming he would be forced to work at 70 to “feed the beast”, and got the payments cut when when his divorce was quietly finalised in January.\n\nHe told a court in Santa Barbara, California, that the £2million-a-year support was based on his 2007 earnings, but in 2008 he had a “lean year” and his income is now £76,363 a month.\n\nThe Fawlty Towers star said he has been forced to sell two properties at a massive loss since his wife filed for divorce in 2007.\n\nHis £19million horse ranch in California sat on the market for a year before selling for a cut-price £11million. Cleese also put his nearby beach house up for sale in November for £7.4million. But the property remains unsold despite Cleese dropping the price to £6million.\n\nBut the actor still managed to joke about his third divorce: “It’s going to be very, very expensive, but it will be worth every penny.”\n\nCleese, whose marriages to Fawlty Towers co-star Connie Booth and Barbara Trentham ended in divorce, wed American-born psychotherapist Alyce in 1992. They were together for 15 years before announcing their split last year.\n\nThey didn’t have any children but Alyce still demanded half his income during their marriage and annual maintenance.\n\nCleese, who dated comedienne Barbie Orr, 27, before a falling out, admitted he has earned more than £14million in the past six years.\n\nMeanwhile, City tycoon Brian Myerson, 50, appealed his divorce settlement this week.\n\nHe is waiting to hear if he can get a cut in his £9.5million payment because of the change in his circumstances in the financial crisis.\n\nnews@sundaymirror.co.uk"
