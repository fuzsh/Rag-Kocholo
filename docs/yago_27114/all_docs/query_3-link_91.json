        "text": "John Cleese's daughter Camilla branded her new stepmother a ''child'' during a comedy set.\n\nThe budding comedienne took many shots at her father and the rest of her family whilst performing at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland, most notably against Jennifer Wade, who, at 42, is 30 years her 'Fawlty Towers' star spouse's junior.\n\nDuring her set, 30-year-old Camilla - whose mother Barbara Threntham was John's second wife - joked: ''Recently we got a new child in the family - my new stepmom.\n\n''My dad, about two years ago, married lucky lady number four, his soulmate du jour. She's great, we actually have a lot in common - we're both six foot, blonde and inappropriately aged to be married to my dad.''\n\nHowever, Camilla insisted she thinks Jennifer - who married her dad in 2012 - is ''really nice''.\n\nShe added: ''But she's really nice and I'm not so that's different.''\n\nCamilla's late mother was married to the actor - who was her second husband - from 1981 to 1990, and the comic joked about the fact they have both married multiple times.\n\nShe told the crowd: ''They've been married for almost 42 years - to seven different people. Not that the same time, we're not Mormon or anything like that, not even close.\n\n''If most people have a family tree, we have a family tumbleweed, it just keeps rolling along picking up dirt and debris, nobody knows how they are related to anyone else, we just know not to f*** each other, because we're not Mormon.''\n\nShe later subtly referred to her dad's third wife, Alyce Faye Eichelberger, as the devil or Lucifer.\n\nThe psychotherapist divorced the 'Monty Python' star in 2008 and secured a hefty sum in the settlement.\n\nCamilla said: ''[Jennifer] is so much cooler than the last one. Her name was Lucy ... fer. She was a treat.''"
