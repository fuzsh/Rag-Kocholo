        "text": "As John Cleese embarks on his \"Alimony Tour\", which he says he needs to pay for his divorce from his third wife Alyce Faye Eichelberger, Jennifer Wade, his new girlfriend, tells Mandrake that she is helping the comedian to make ends meet.\n\nThe statuesque Wade has been doing some nude modelling for the sculptor Jonathan Wylder and is paid a commission for each of his works that are sold. “I need that money to pay her alimony,” she says of Eichelberger.\n\nCleese, 71, divorced the American psychotherapist in 2008, after agreeing a £12 million settlement in finance and assets, including £600,000 a year for seven years.\n\nWade, 40, a jewellery designer, is divorced from her first husband, the Old Harrovian businessman Richard Norris.\n\nShe boasts: “After I divorced, my lawyer said to me he wanted to put up a photograph of me in his office with a sign above it saying, 'The woman who took nothing’.\n\n“John jokes that he will put up a picture of Alyce with a sign saying, 'The woman who took everything’.”\n\nCleese’s previous wives were his Fawlty Towers co-star Connie Booth, by whom he has a daughter, Cynthia, and the American actress Barbara Trentham, by whom he has a second daughter, Camilla. He has hinted that he might be about to make Wade his fourth wife.\n\n“I like the idea of it,” he said. “I think it’s a lovely idea to spend a lot of time with someone.”\n\nWade, who is English but spent much of her childhood in America, established her jewellery business after separating from Norris, 45, in 2007.\n\n“It’s not going to put her on the Rich List, but she’s not a dilettante,” said one of Cleese’s acquaintances."
