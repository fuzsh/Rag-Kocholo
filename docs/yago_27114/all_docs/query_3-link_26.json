        "text": "Fawlty Towers star John Cleese claims a reported $23 million divorce settlement with this third wife will leave him poorer than her and bound to work well into his 70s.\n\nThe renowned comedy actor is giving his American former wife of 16 years, Alyce Faye Eichelberger, $15.8 million in cash and assets as well as $1.1 million a year for seven years under the terms of their divorce settlement, Britain's Daily Telegraph reported.\n\nThe papers to finalise the settlement were lodged in a Californian court last week.\n\nCleese, 70, is reportedly writing a one-man show to be titled My Alyce Faye Divorce Tour.\n\nHe said of the outcome: \"I got off lightly. Think what I'd have had to pay Alyce if she had contributed anything to the relationship.\"\n\nBut the actor has also reportedly complained it will leave him poorer than Eichelberger, a psychotherapist with two sons from a previous marriage.\n\n\"What I find so unfair is that if we both died today, her children would get much more than mine,” Cleese said.\n\n\"At least I will know in future if a I go out with a lady they will not be after me for my money.\"\n\nCleese also said in a recent interview the settlement would force him to keep working.\n\n\"In my 70th year I will still be spending two months a year doing work that is of no interest to me and which is probably slightly spiritually depleting in order to feed the beast,\" he said.\n\nFriends say Cleese is furious about the arrangement, which gives Eichelberger an apartment in New York, a $4 million house in London and half a beach house they're selling in California.\n\n\"John has worked all his life and will now have to continue working because he has seen a huge chunk of what he has worked for going to his former wife who he rescued from a council flat,” friend and former film director Michael Winner said.\n\n\"It is an extraordinary world which means John is left with much less than his former wife even though he is the star who did all the work.\n\n\"The settlement defies human belief. John is extremely cross about it and I don't blame him.\n\n\"The settlement comes after two years of harrowing legal argument.”"
