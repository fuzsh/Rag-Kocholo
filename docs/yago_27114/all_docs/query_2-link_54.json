I quickly turned the channel – just in time to see that the show was being dedicated to the late John Cleese.\n\n“How could John Cleese have died without my being aware of it?\n\n“Stunned, I sat there for a minute and decided I was not in the mood to watch the show any longer.\n\n“As I opened my eyes at 5:55 a.m. this morning, his death was the first thing that crossed my mind. I planned to look for the information on the Internet after I read the paper today.\n\n“I called my son, since he has always been a fan of Monty Python, and gave him the news. He didn’t respond, so I kept talking about their shows and their wonderful sense of the absurd. I heard the click of keys on a keyboard tray, so I knew he was looking it up.\n\n” ‘Wikipedia doesn’t know he’s dead,’ he replied. ‘Neither do the other Web sites.’\n\n” ‘Well, I know what I read!’ I replied a little testily.\n\n” ‘Mom,’ he replied patiently, ‘it is a Monty Python show.” ‘\n\n“Slowly and joyfully, it dawned on me: John Cleese lives! But I really wish they hadn’t done that to me. I would have gone around all day telling people that John Cleese was dead and how he was such a great comedian and how he was my hero and he was the master of the absurd and what a loss for the entire world. I would have shed a tear or two.\n\n“I’m glad I talked to my son this morning. He saved me from making a fool of myself again. Thanks, Steve.”\n\nOopps!\n\nThe Retired Pedagogue of Arden Hills: “Subject: The Godzilla of the North Metro!\n\n“I thought it might have been corrected in the interim, but eight months after I first noticed the gaffe on my receipt from the gas station, it appeared exactly the same on the most recent one: ‘EAT BETHEL MARATHON.’ ”\n\nThe Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon\n\nBH of Oakdale: “I’ve never sent anything to Bulletin Board before, but I do read through BB occasionally.\n\n“The idea of the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon has always intrigued me. I certainly think I had one.\n\n“While reading the Pioneer Press, I glanced at an article under the heading ‘Nation & World Briefing.’ In the article about Oxford University coping with floods and a discussion of the need for local residents to seek refuge, a stubborn 90-year-old woman explained why she was not willing to leave her home: ‘I’ve still got a pair of Wellingtons, haven’t I?’ I made my assumptions, having never heard of ‘Wellingtons.’\n\n“Fifteen minutes later, I returned to reading the latest and final edition of the Harry Potter series, which I started two days ago. Within 10 minutes I was reading about a character named Xenophilius Lovegood – and, lo and behold (on Page 403), he returns from an errand outside by the stream with ‘his thin legs now encased in Wellington boots….’\n\n“Maybe this type of boot is common in England (or even around these parts), but I had never heard of them before. I was a bit stunned by the timing.”\n\nThe Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon?\n\nTiny Dancer in Shore-view: “I was driving home Saturday from the Voyageurs Park area and finally got a radio station on, and the guy on the radio was talking about either an article he read or some kind of news bite about a dog that whines when the bobber goes down in the water, and that the dog finally got his own rod. I remember this little tidbit because we had spent a week fishing – with two fish caught and one released. We sure could have used some help fishing.\n\n“When I got home, the first thing I did is (a whole week without papers, TV, cell phones; it was bliss) read the Bulletin Board, and the first article is from Inver Grove Heights Granny about her son and his fishing dog.\n\n“Is this a B-M of BB fame?”\n\nBULLETIN BOARD SAYS: B-M? No. That’s a Joy of Juxtaposition. The radio guy was un-doubtedly reading Bulletin Board, and so were you.\n\nThat shouldn’t even be a coincidence! That should be state law!\n\nVanity, thy name is …\n\nFriendly Bob of Fridley: “Subject: Divided loyalties.\n\n“Spotted these two license plates, on cars parked by Lake Calhoun, within a couple of minutes of each other.\n\n“Minnesota plate: ‘UTAH.’\n\n“Florida plate: ‘MNSOTAH.’ ”\n\nRed’s Offspring, north of St. Paul: “No. 2 Down on the TMS DAILY CROSSWORD PUZZLE read: ‘Lah-di __.’\n\n“That reminded me of a plate which I had spotted on a Lexus in a Fort Myers parking lot: ‘LA D DA1.’\n\n“If only it had been No. 1 Down!”\n\nLife (and death) as we know it\n\nSB Grammy: “Friday, I spent most of the afternoon sitting with family at North Memorial Hospital in the Trauma ICU center. It was a day that I never wish to repeat, nor would I want to see anyone else have to go through. Hence my message.\n\n“My 20-year-old nephew was driving to work on Thursday morning in his truck, with no seatbelt on. Something distracted him, and he lost control of his vehicle and hit a culvert. What the truck did in the next few minutes, none of us know, but he broke all the bones in his head from his jawbone upward. Other than a slight laceration on his right ear, there were no physical signs of trauma.\n\n“Friday morning, once the immediate family all arrived – some from as far away as California – they had to make the decision as to whether they were going to donate his organs or not, as he was proclaimed brain-dead. What a hard thing for a mother to have to do. From my perspective, the family did the right thing, and they have donated all viable organs, which will give someone else a chance at a good life, and for that we are all grateful.\n\n“But this could have turned out different if he had been wearing his seatbelt. I know many young people (and by young people, I am referring to those who are not in the OTD category) do not wear their seatbelts because they do not want anyone telling them what to do and how to live their lives, but it is very important to wear it. Please, please put them on.\n\n“As for the people who work at North Memorial Hospital: They are wonderful people, and enough cannot be said about them. My nephew’s nurse, Megan, was wonderful with him and with all of the family, making sure that we were comfortable, that we had all the time we needed with him, and kept us informed of everything that was happening and the reasons they were happening. There was no question that went unanswered, other than the standard ‘Why him?’\n\n“So again, please, people, buckle up – not just because it is the law, but because you could be saving your life.”\n\nIn memoriam\n\nOr: Our community of strangers\n\nWrites Lori of Eagan: “Yesterday (Saturday), on the day of his funeral, you put something in the BB that my cousin KS (bless her soul) wrote in about my dad. It was well timed because his funeral was that day, and my mom was very touched by this. I had tried to write in a few times, but was unable to finish anything, so thank you so much.\n\n“Anyway, when planning the lunch for after the funeral, the very kind funeral coordinator let us know that our estimated number of 200 for lunch was a bit high for someone who’d made it to 92. Well, despite the dementia he’d been dealing with for the last 10 years, I think we met that number and then some. What a tribute to a great guy. I would love to forward the eulogy, but since it took six minutes to read, perhaps that’s a bit much. I am including the last paragraph:\n\n” ‘Dad was an inherently happy man, but I think it was winning the heart of his one true love, my mom, that kept him grinning year after year. He was recently telling us the story of meeting her, and although this more recent version is quite a bit different from the original, there’s one thing that remained the same. He said: “And I thought to myself, ‘Oh, now there’s a pretty girl.’ ” He thought that for 57 years! He adored her. I never heard Dad utter an unkind remark about Mom, and I think this speaks to the beautiful relationship they had, and that this has affected how we interact with those we care about. Their example taught us how to love and respect our spouses. You know, my dad has been on the road to his heaven for a while now. He’s taken lots of detours, but that was in his nature. He always said he saw more interesting things by turning the wrong way! Honestly, could he be any more positive about things! I will miss his intelligent, happy, corny, wonderful self, but I’m glad he has found his way home.’ ”\n\nKnow thyself!\n\nMSHKA in Maplewood: “On Thursday, July 26, my friend and I were lamenting how fast time goes, and how behind we are in things we should be doing. He said: ‘I’m so behind, I still have snow to shovel from last winter.’\n\n“(It was 96 degrees on July 26, 2007.)”\n\nUnclear on the concept (responsorial)\n\nSaturday’s Bulletin Board included this note from Walt of Wayzata: “From the front page of the Minneapolis Red Star Trombone, Friday, July 27th: It’s item No. 4 under ‘HAVE YOU HEARD?‘ down in the bottom-right-hand corner of the page: ‘Lindsay Lohan got this advice from her lawyer: “Whatever you’ve done in the past, do a 360-degree turn and go the other way.” ‘\n\n“If she does a 360-degree turn, she’s gonna be going the same way she was going in the first place!”\n\nWe presently heard from The Other Princess: “As many times as she has been in and out of rehab this year, I’d say that she’s already done several 360-degree turns. Maybe the dizziness isn’t all an act.”\n\nAnd from Rick of La Crescent: “It looks to me like Ms. Lohan is working on a sequel to one of her previous movies. The title will be ‘Lindsay Fully Loaded.’ ”\n\nBand Name of the Day:\n\nFully Loaded\n\nWeb Site of the Day – recommended by The Wordsmith:\n\nThis year’s winners of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, at tinyurl.com/yvc69b\n\nOriginally Published: July 31, 2007 at 11:01 p.m."
