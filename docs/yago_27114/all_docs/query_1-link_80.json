The book is thought to be able to command an advance of around £2 million (NZ$4.1 million) from potential publishers.\n\nJohn told The Sun newspaper: \"I don't think anybody's ever done one like this. I'd been putting it off - partly because I was too busy, and also because it was too difficult trying to remember things.\"\n\nThe 71-year-old star has previously said he needs to earn about £1 million (NZ$2.06 million) a year to pay off the settlement and he is currently on a comedy tour of the UK, dubbed The Alimony Tour, which finishes on July 2.\n\n- BANG!
