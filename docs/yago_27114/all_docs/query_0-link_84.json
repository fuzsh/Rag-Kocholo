        "text": "Comedy legend John Cleese is selling props and film memorabilia online in an ongoing attempt to fund a huge divorce settlement, claims the Daily Mail.\n\nThe Monty Python star is offering signed photographs of iconic scenes from Monty Python and film props from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Last month Cleese sold a 1987 Bentley Eight for £17,500 on the same site, along with a promise to have lunch with the buyer and associated memorabilia.\n\nCleese separated from his third wife – an American psychotherapist called Alyce Faye Eichelberger – in 2008 after 16 years of marriage. In an ‘acrimonious’ divorce settlement, she was awarded £12 million in money and assets, including payments of £612,000 a year until 2016, as well as properties in London and New York.\n\nCleese claimed the settlement had left her richer than him, telling the Telegraph: “At least I will know in future if I go out with a lady they will not be after me for my money.”\n\nThe comedian married his fourth wife, Jennifer Wade, who is 31 years his junior, in August last year."
