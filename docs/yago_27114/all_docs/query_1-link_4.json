        "text": "It must have been a nice change for Harriet Harman to find her Britain's Most Hated status challenged last week by a surprise contender: Alyce Faye Eichelberger Cleese. Like \"Harperson\", \"Poison Alyce\", as she is familiarly known, has been careless enough to let herself become sexually unattractive to leading commentators. But worse: she has just relieved her ex, John Cleese, of £12.5m, leaving him, it is estimated, with no more than £10m to hide, like some latterday Silas Marner, beneath the bare floorboards of his pathetic rented cottage.\n\nHer critics protest that this is far too much for a marriage which lasted 16 years and produced no children. What sort of example does it set to other unappealing people who may have to split £22.5m and all kinds of homes between them, with just a few top matrimonial lawyers to help them ratchet up the take? Some speculate that awards on this monstrous scale will put men off marriage and therefore damage the interests of decent, British women. Even if, after most British divorces, it is women who end up worse off.\n\nCleese's friend, Michael Winner, likes to stress that, before she met Cleese, Ms Eichelberger lived in a council flat. Perhaps he worries that she will spend all the money on scratch cards and pizza. As a fellow admirer of Cleese's early work, I could only think it a shame the Californian court did not double her award, or triple it – whatever it took to reduce him to a state of abject, embittered penury.\n\nFor even his greatest fans would have to admit that Mr Cleese has not said or done a funny thing for years. Other than, perhaps, become a therapy nut and marry a professional therapist with a name like a pantomime fairy. Indeed, in his self-help books about the achievement of emotional well-being, Cleese revealed a latent gift for unendurable tedium that seemed almost miraculous from the creator of Basil Fawlty. Could he have been influenced by Alyce Faye, winner of a \"Better Life\" award for her own self-help book, How to Manage Your Mother?\n\nHere he is, anyway, in Life and How to Survive It, discussing the wonders of psychotherapy with his collaborator, the late Robin Skynner. \"So you're saying that the main factor that helps the patient to become aware of the taboo emotions, and therefore to integrate them, is the relaxed and accepting atmosphere that the therapist provides.\" After Skynner agrees, John presses on. \"What about meditation? A lot of people, and I'm among them, find it not only calms our emotions, but that it makes us feel more 'together'.\"\n\nSince Ms Eichelberger-Fawlty hit the jackpot, however, we seem to have got the old, untogether Cleese back again. \"At least I will know in future if I go out with a lady they will not be after me for my money,\" he said. Perhaps the ladies will even be attracted by his GSOH? \"I got off lightly,\" joked the gallant Python. \"Think what I'd have had to pay Alyce if she had contributed anything to the relationship.\"\n\nIf he maintains this form in a new show whose working title is \"My Alyce Faye Divorce Tour\", the Cleese-Eichelberger divorce promises to be the best marriage breakdown entertainment since Heather Mills, unmollified by her award of £24.3m, emptied a jug of water over Paul McCartney's (and Alyce Faye's) solicitor, Fiona Shackleton.\n\nNot only does the Eichelberger-Cleese show, crucially for the nation's guilt-free enjoyment, feature another utterly charmless couple whose separation could have been made in heaven; now that Cleese appears to have put meditation behind him we can hope for some of the showbusiness touches that made the Madonna and Guy kabbala-style separation so compelling. Highlights: \"This song is for the emotionally retarded\" (her); sex was like \"cuddling up to a piece of gristle\" (him).\n\nNo need, either, to worry that even if Mr Cleese has surrendered his privacy, Ms Eichelberger deserves to have hers respected. Check out AlyceFaye.com, for her thoughts on life, fine wines and luxury hotels, sumptuously illustrated with captioned holiday snaps. \"Great knotty pine,\" she writes under one shot, the interior of a holiday cabin. \"Kitchen storage,\" elaborates another, a close-up of some utensils. Then we have some pipes: \"The hearth and central heating.\" At least Mr Cleese can see where his £12.5m is going.\n\nSuch is Eichelberger's obvious, post-divorce contentment that it seems a wonder she should be reviled as an embarrassment to women, instead of canonised by the many followers of the fashionable, retro line in emancipatory thinking that now urges women to put security before independence. Since 1996, when The Rules became an international bestseller, with its step-by-step system for trapping Mr Right, more and more of the women's self-help market (formerly a tear-sodden exploration of why they loved too much), has been taken over by books which use evolutionary psychology to prop up their argument that, basically, we are hard-wired to be Wags.\n\n\"With all due respect, feminism has not changed men or the nature of romantic relationships,\" say the authors of The Rules. \"Women crave security and bonding. This has been true since civilisation began!\" By, security, they mean \"closing the deal\": a proposal of marriage. Within which, of course, the rules should still be observed: \"Always be pleased and flattered because your husband wants to have sex with you.\"\n\nIn the latest man-finding manuals, including quite aspirational ones, even romance is likely to be disregarded, along with a potential husband's creepy habits, as a girlish, time-wasting impediment to what is, in effect, a unilaterally arranged marriage. \"It's time to start treating your life like reality, not a fairy tale,\" urge the authors of the latest gold-digger's guide, Smart Girls Marry Money. \"We live in a world that runs on dollars and good sense.\"\n\nIn this hard-headed, post-feminist context, Alyce Faye and her fellow beneficiaries of vast, ludicrously unmerited divorce settlements should surely shine as inspirational role models. If it is clever, as more and more women seem to think, to use marriage as a means to security, income and property, it must be surpassingly so to lose the marriage part, when it goes wrong, but hang on to the security, cash and houses.\n\nAnd all this Alyce Faye sensationally achieved at an age when, according all the experts on finding a man in middle age, she was already disabled by tired-looking skin plus, in her case, the implacable hostility of Mr Michael Winner. At least, on the my-enemy's-enemy principle, she must enjoy the support of various Winner-hating chefs.\n\nWhether the achievements of Alyce Faye as she embarks on her new life, photographing utensils, are a good thing for women or a bad one may become clearer this autumn, following publication of several new books on the strange state of modern feminism. But I think we can be certain about one thing. The tale of Mr Cleese and Ms Eichelberger makes Woody Allen look like a really brilliant advertisement for psychotherapy."
