Canada's Premier Spice Girls Tribute Band took Toronto by storm when they emerged last winter, selling out their first two shows at The El Mocambo. Die-hard Spice Girls fans waited in line for hours, buzzing with excitement and eager to sing and dance to their favorite songs. When the music started, the crowd went wild. "People were literally climbing the stage," laughs Anika Johnson, who plays Sporty Spice, â€œthey thought we were the real thing!". The girls sold out another show a few months later at Lee's Palace and dazzled audiences at NXNE and Pride this summer.

The band is made up of some of Toronto's most passionate performers and musicians, united by a shared love for the greatest girl band of all time: The Spice Girls. The tribute band has traveled across the continent, dazzling audiences at clubs, festivals, concert halls, and theaters everywhere.

Fans and critics agree that this Spice Girls Tribute Band brings you as close as you can get to the real thing and always leaves you wanting more. With costumes, accents, 90s makeup, a six-piece band, and the platform shoes to match, this tribute act has gained a stellar reputation for always throwing the best party in town!
