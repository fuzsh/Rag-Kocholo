        "text": "PillowtalkZayn\n\nZayn's \"Pillowtalk\" reached #1 on the Hot 100, something his former One Direction bandmates never achieved.\n\nThe Girl From IpanemaStan Getz and Astrud Gilberto\n\nThere really is a Girl From Ipanema. Her name is Helo Pinheiro, and she would walk \"Like a samba\" past the bar the songwriters frequented, providing the inspiration.\n\nMMMbopHanson\n\nThe chipper-sounding \"MMMbop\" by Hanson has a heavy lyrical theme, asking us to look at the big picture and value what is lasting in life: our support systems.\n\nAll I Wanna DoSheryl Crow\n\n\"All I Wanna Do\" by Sheryl Crow started with the first line from an obscure poem called \"Fun\" that read, \"All I wanna do is have some fun.\"\n\nLife During WartimeTalking Heads\n\nThe 1979 song \"Life During Wartime\" by Talking Heads deals with how technology could be exploited to take down the framework of society and enable government surveillance.\n\nThe Kids Aren't AlrightFall Out Boy\n\nFall Out Boy's \"The Kids Aren't Alright\" song title is not a reference to The Offspring's 1998 single of the same name. It actually alludes to The Who's 1979 rockumentary film called The Kids Are Alright.\n\nThe Truth Is Out There: A History of Alien SongsSong Writing\n\nThe trail runs from flying saucer songs in the '50s, through Bowie, blink-182 and Katy Perry.\n\nIntentionally AtrociousSong Writing\n\nA selection of songs made to be terrible - some clearly achieved that goal.\n\ndUg Pinnick of King's XSongwriter Interviews\n\ndUg dIgs into his King's X metal classics and his many side projects, including the one with Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam.\n\nTanita TikaramSongwriter Interviews\n\nWhen she released her first album in 1988, Tanita became a UK singing sensation at age 19. She talks about her darkly sensual voice and quirky songwriting style."
