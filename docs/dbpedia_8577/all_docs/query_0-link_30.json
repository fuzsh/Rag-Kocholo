        "text": "Janis Joplin is one of the most revered and iconic rock n’ roll singers of all time, a tragic and misunderstood figure who thrilled millions of listeners and blazed new creative trails before her death in 1971 at age 27. With massive hits including “Me and Bobby McGee” and “Piece of My Heart,” and such classic albums as Cheap Thrills and Pearl, Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Joplin was one of the definitive stars to emerge during the musical and cultural revolution of the 1960s. She delivered a breakout performance at the Monterey Pop Festival, and was one of the memorable acts at Woodstock. Her legacy has only grown since her passing.\n\nJanis Joplin Life and Career Timeline\n\nJanuary 19, 1943\n\nJanis Lyn Joplin is born in Port Arthur, TX, to Seth and Dorothy Joplin.

After high school graduation, she attends Lamar State College of Technology in Beaumont, TX, in the summer.\n\n1961\n\nJanis moves to Venice, CA.\n\n1962\n\nJanis enrolls at The University of Texas at Austin and begins to study art.
