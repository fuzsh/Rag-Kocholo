        "text": "American country singer (1932–2022)\n\nNot to be confused with Loretta Lynch.\n\nLoretta Lynn (née Webb; April 14, 1932 – October 4, 2022) was an American country music singer and songwriter. In a career spanning six decades, Lynn released multiple gold albums. She had numerous hits such as \"Hey Loretta\", \"The Pill\", \"Blue Kentucky Girl\", \"Love Is the Foundation\", \"You're Lookin' at Country\", \"You Ain't Woman Enough\", \"I'm a Honky Tonk Girl\", \"Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)\", \"One's on the Way\", \"Fist City\", and \"Coal Miner's Daughter\". The 1980 musical film Coal Miner's Daughter was based on her life.\n\nLynn received many awards and other accolades for her groundbreaking role in country music, including awards from both the Country Music Association and Academy of Country Music (ACM) as a duet partner and an individual artist. She was nominated 18 times for a Grammy Award and won three times.[1] As of 2022, Lynn was the most awarded female country recording artist and the only female ACM Artist of the Decade (the 1970s). Lynn scored 24 No. 1 hit singles and 11 number-one albums. She ended 57 years of touring on the road after she suffered a stroke in 2017 and broke her hip in 2018.[2]\n\nEarly life and career\n\n[edit]\n\nLynn was born Loretta Webb in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, on April 14, 1932.[3] She was the oldest daughter and second child born to Clara Marie \"Clary\" (née Ramey; May 5, 1912 – November 24, 1981) and Melvin Theodore \"Ted\" Webb (June 6, 1906 – February 22, 1959). Ted was a coal miner and subsistence farmer.[4] The family claims Cherokee heritage on Lynn's mother's side, but have not been officially recognized by that tribe.[5] She was named after the film star Loretta Young.[6] The other Webb children were:\n\nMelvin \"Junior\" Webb (December 4, 1929 – July 2, 1993)[7][8]\n\nHerman Webb (September 3, 1934 – July 28, 2018)[7][8]\n\nWillie \"Jay\" Lee Webb (February 12, 1937 – July 31, 1996)[9][8]\n\nDonald Ray Webb (April 2, 1941 – October 13, 2017)[7][8]\n\nPeggy Sue Wright (née Webb; born March 25, 1943)[8][10]\n\nBetty Ruth Hopkins (née Webb; born January 5, 1946)[8][11]\n\nCrystal Gayle (born Brenda Gail Webb; January 9, 1951)[8][12]\n\nLoretta's father Ted died at the age of 52 from a stroke four years after relocating with her mother and younger siblings to Wabash, Indiana. He had also been battling black lung disease at the time of his death.[13]\n\nThrough her matriline, Lynn was distant cousins with country singer Patty Loveless.[14]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n1960–1966: Early country success\n\n[edit]\n\nLynn began singing in local clubs in the late 1950s. She later formed her own band, the Trailblazers which included her brother Jay Lee Webb. Lynn won a wristwatch in a televised talent contest in Tacoma, Washington, hosted by Buck Owens. Lynn's performance was seen by Canadian Norm Burley of Zero Records, who co-founded the record company after hearing Loretta sing.[15]\n\nZero Records president, Canadian Don Grashey, arranged a recording session in Hollywood, where four of Lynn's compositions were recorded, including \"I'm A Honky Tonk Girl,\" \"Whispering Sea,\" \"Heartache Meet Mister Blues,\" and \"New Rainbow.\" Her first release featured \"Whispering Sea\" and \"I'm a Honky Tonk Girl\". Lynn signed her first contract on February 2, 1960, with Zero. Her album was recorded at United Western Recorders in Hollywood, engineered by Don Blake and produced by Grashey.[16][17] Musicians who played on the songs were steel guitar player Speedy West,[18] fiddler Harold Hensley, guitarist Roy Lanham, Al Williams on bass, and Muddy Berry on drums.[19][user-generated source?] Lynn commented on the different sound of her first record: \"Well, there is a West Coast sound that is definitely not the same as the Nashville sound [...] It was a shuffle with a West Coast beat\".[18]\n\nThe Lynns toured the country to promote the release to country stations,[15] while Grashey and Del Roy took the music to KFOX in Long Beach, California.[17] When the Lynns reached Nashville, the song was a hit, climbing to No. 14 on Billboard's Country and Western chart, and Lynn began cutting demo records for the Wilburn Brothers Publishing Company. Through the Wilburns, she secured a contract with Decca Records.[15] The first Loretta Lynn Fan Club formed in November 1960. By the end of the year, Billboard magazine listed Lynn as the No. 4 Most Promising Country Female Artist.[20]\n\nLynn's relationship with the Wilburn Brothers and her appearances on the Grand Ole Opry, beginning in 1960,[21] helped Lynn become the No. 1 female recording artist in country music. Her contract with the Wilburn Brothers gave them the publishing rights to her material. She unsuccessfully fought the Wilburn Brothers for 30 years to regain the publishing rights to her songs after ending her business relationship with them. Lynn stopped writing music in the 1970s because of the contracts. Lynn joined the Grand Ole Opry on September 25, 1962.[4]\n\nLynn credited Patsy Cline as her mentor and best friend during her early years in music. In 2010, when interviewed for Jimmy McDonough's biography of Tammy Wynette, Tammy Wynette: Tragic Country Queen, Lynn said of having best friends in Patsy and Tammy during different times: \"Best friends are like husbands. You only need one at a time.\"[22]\n\nLynn released her first Decca single, \"Success\", in 1962, and it went straight to No. 6, beginning a string of top 10 singles that would run throughout the 1970s. Lynn's music began to regularly hit the Top 10 after 1964 with songs such as \"Before I'm Over You\", which peaked at No. 4, followed by \"Wine, Women and Song\", which peaked at No. 3. In late 1964, she recorded a duet album with Ernest Tubb. Their lead single, \"Mr. and Mrs. Used to Be\", peaked within the Top 15. The pair recorded two more albums, Singin' Again (1967) and If We Put Our Heads Together (1969). In 1965, her solo career continued with three major hits, \"Happy Birthday\", \"Blue Kentucky Girl\" (later recorded and made a Top 10 hit in the 1970s by Emmylou Harris), and \"The Home You're Tearing Down\". Lynn's label issued two albums that year, Songs from My Heart and Blue Kentucky Girl.[23]\n\nLynn's first self-penned song to crack the Top 10, 1966's \"Dear Uncle Sam\", was among the first recordings to recount the human costs of the Vietnam War.[4] Her 1966 hit \"You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)\" made Lynn the first country female recording artist to write a No. 1 hit.[24]\n\n1967–1980: Breakthrough success\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1967, Lynn released the single \"Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)\",[25] It was her first number one country hit.[26]\n\nLynn's next album, Fist City, was released in 1968. The title track became Lynn's second No. 1 hit, as a single earlier that year, and the other single from the album, \"What Kind of a Girl (Do You Think I Am)\", peaked within the top 10. In 1968, her next studio album, Your Squaw Is on the Warpath, spawned two Top 5 Country hits, including the title track and \"You've Just Stepped In (From Stepping Out on Me)\". In 1969, her next single, \"Woman of the World (Leave My World Alone)\", was Lynn's third chart-topper, followed by a subsequent Top 10, \"To Make a Man (Feel Like a Man)\". Her song \"You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)\", was an instant hit and became one of Lynn's all-time most popular. Her career continued to be successful into the 1970s, especially following the success of her autobiographical hit \"Coal Miner's Daughter\", which peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Chart in 1970. The song became her first single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 83. She had a series of singles that charted low on the Hot 100 between 1970 and 1975. In 1978, she became a special guest star on The Muppet Show. The song \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" later served as the impetus for her bestselling autobiography (1976) and the Oscar-winning biopic, both of which share the song's title.[27]\n\nIn 1973, \"Rated \"X\"\" peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Chart and was considered one of Lynn's most controversial hits. The following year, her next single, \"Love Is the Foundation\", also became a No. 1 country hit from her album of the same name. The second and last single from that album, \"Hey Loretta\", became a Top 5 hit. Lynn continued to reach the Top 10 until the end of the decade, including 1975's \"The Pill\", one of the first songs to discuss birth control. Many of Lynn's songs were autobiographical, and as a songwriter, Lynn felt no topic was off limits, as long as it was relatable to women.[28] In 1976, she released her autobiography, Coal Miner's Daughter, with the help of writer George Vecsey. It became a bestseller, with more than 8 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list.[29]\n\nProfessional partnership with Conway Twitty\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1971, Lynn began a professional partnership with Conway Twitty. As a duo, Lynn and Twitty had five consecutive No. 1 hits between 1971 and 1975, including \"After the Fire Is Gone\" (1971), which won them a Grammy award; \"Lead Me On\" (1971); \"Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man\" (1973); \"As Soon as I Hang Up the Phone\" (1974); and \"Feelins'\" (1974). For four consecutive years, 1972–1975, Lynn and Twitty were named the \"Vocal Duo of the Year\" by the Country Music Association. The Academy of Country Music named them the \"Best Vocal Duet\" in 1971, 1974, 1975, and 1976. The American Music awards selected them as the \"Favorite Country Duo\" in 1975, 1976, and 1977. The fan-voted Music City News readers voted them the No. 1 duet every year between 1971 and 1981, inclusive. In addition to their five No. 1 singles, they had seven other Top 10 hits between 1976 and 1981.[30]\n\nAs a solo artist, Lynn continued her success in 1971, achieving her fifth No. 1 solo hit, \"One's on the Way\", written by poet and songwriter Shel Silverstein. She also charted with \"I Wanna Be Free\", \"You're Lookin' at Country\", and 1972's \"Here I Am Again\", all released on separate albums. The next year, she became the first country star on the cover of Newsweek.[31] In 1972, Lynn was the first woman to be nominated and win Entertainer of the Year at the CMA awards. She won the Female Vocalist of the Year and Duo of the Year with Conway Twitty, beating out George Jones and Tammy Wynette and Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton.[32]\n\nTribute album for Patsy Cline, other projects, and honors\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1977, Lynn recorded I Remember Patsy, an album dedicated to her friend, singer Patsy Cline, who died in a plane crash in 1963. The album covered some of Cline's biggest hits. The two singles Lynn released from the album, \"She's Got You\" and \"Why Can't He Be You\", became hits. \"She's Got You\", which went to No. 1 by Cline in 1962 and went to No. 1 again by Lynn. \"Why Can't He Be You\" peaked at No. 7. Lynn had her last No. 1 hit in 1978 with \"Out of My Head and Back in My Bed\".[23]\n\nIn 1979, Lynn had two Top 5 hits, \"I Can't Feel You Anymore\" and \"I've Got a Picture of Us on My Mind\", from separate albums.[33]\n\nDevoted to her fans, Lynn told the editor of Salisbury, Maryland's newspaper the reason she signed hundreds of autographs: \"These people are my fans... I'll stay here until the very last one wants my autograph. Without these people, I am nobody. I love these people.\" In 1979, she became the spokesperson for Procter & Gamble's Crisco Oil. Because of her dominant hold on the 1970s, Lynn was named the \"Artist of the Decade\" by the Academy of Country Music. She is the only woman to have won this honor.[34]\n\nLynn became a part of the country music scene in Nashville in the 1960s. In 1967, she had the first of 16 No. 1 hits, out of 70 charted songs as a solo artist and a duet partner.[35] Her later hits include \"Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)\", \"You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)\", \"Fist City\", and \"Coal Miner's Daughter\".[36]\n\nLynn focused on women's issues with themes about philandering husbands and persistent mistresses. Her music was inspired by issues she faced in her marriage. She increased the boundaries in the conservative genre of country music by singing about birth control (\"The Pill\"), repeated childbirth (\"One's on the Way\"), double standards for men and women (\"Rated 'X'\"), and being widowed by the draft during the Vietnam War (\"Dear Uncle Sam\").[37]\n\nCountry music radio stations often refused to play her music and in a 1987 interview she said eight of her songs had been banned.[38]\n\nHer bestselling 1976 autobiography, Coal Miner's Daughter, was made into an Academy Award–winning film with the same title in 1980, starring Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones. Spacek won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role as Lynn. Lynn's album Van Lear Rose, released in 2004, was produced by the alternative rock musician Jack White. Lynn and White were nominated for five Grammys and won two.[39][40]\n\nLynn received numerous awards in country and American music. She was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1983, the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1988, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2008. She was honored in 2010 at the Country Music Awards. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2013.[41] Lynn was a member of the Grand Ole Opry since joining on September 25, 1962. Her debut appearance on the Grand Ole Opry was on October 15, 1960. Lynn recorded 70 albums including 54 studio albums, 15 compilation albums, and a tribute album.[42][unreliable source?][43]\n\n1980–1989: Movie and popularity\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 5, 1980, the film Coal Miner's Daughter debuted in Nashville and soon became the No. 1 box office hit in the United States. The film starred Sissy Spacek as Loretta and Tommy Lee Jones as her husband, Doolittle \"Mooney\" Lynn. The film received seven Academy Award nominations, winning the Best Actress Oscar for Spacek, a gold album for the soundtrack album, a Grammy nomination for Spacek, Country Music Association and Academy of Country Music awards, and several Golden Globe awards. The 1980s featured more hits, including \"Pregnant Again\", \"Naked in the Rain\", and \"Somebody Led Me Away\".[31] Lynn's last Top 10 record as a soloist was 1982's \"I Lie\", but her releases continued to chart until the end of the decade.[23]\n\nOne of her last solo releases was \"Heart Don't Do This to Me\" (1985), which reached No. 19, her last Top 20 hit. Her 1985 album Just a Woman spawned a Top 40 hit. In 1987, Lynn lent her voice to a song on k.d. lang's album Shadowland with country stars Kitty Wells and Brenda Lee, \"Honky Tonk Angels Medley\". The album was certified gold and was Grammy nominated for the four women. Lynn's 1988 album Who Was That Stranger would be her last solo album for MCA, which she parted ways with in 1989.[44] She was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1988.[45]\n\n1990–2004: Return to country and second autobiography\n\n[edit]\n\nLynn returned to the public eye in 1993 with a hit album, the trio album Honky Tonk Angels, recorded with Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette.[46] The album peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Country charts and No. 42 on the Billboard Pop charts and charted a single with \"Silver Threads and Golden Needles\". The album sold more than 800,000 copies and was certified gold in the United States and Canada. The trio was nominated for Grammy and Country Music Association awards. Lynn released a three-CD boxed set chronicling her career on MCA Records. In 1995, she taped a seven-week series on the Nashville Network (TNN), Loretta Lynn & Friends.[47]\n\nIn 1995, Loretta was presented with the Pioneer Award at the 30th Academy of Country Music Awards.[48] In 1996, Lynn's husband, Oliver Vanetta \"Doolittle\" Lynn, died five days short of his 70th birthday. In 2000, Lynn released her first album in several years, Still Country, in which she included \"I Can't Hear the Music\", a tribute song to her late husband. She released her first new single in more than 10 years from the album, \"Country in My Genes\". The single charted on the Billboard Country singles chart and made Lynn the first woman in country music to chart singles in five decades. In 2002, Lynn published her second autobiography, Still Woman Enough, and it became her second New York Times Best Seller, peaking in the top 10. In 2004, she published a cookbook, You're Cookin' It Country.[49]\n\n2004–2022: Late career resurgence\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2004, Lynn released Van Lear Rose, the second album on which Lynn either wrote or co-wrote every song. Produced by Jack White of The White Stripes, the album featured guitar and backup vocals by White. The collaboration garnered Lynn high praise from the mainstream and alternative rock music press, such as Spin and Blender.[50] Rolling Stone voted it the second best album of 2004, and it won the Grammy Award for Best Country Album of the Year.[51]\n\nLate in 2010, Sony Music released a new compilation album, Coal Miner's Daughter: A Tribute to Loretta Lynn, featuring stars like Reba McEntire, Faith Hill, Paramore, and Carrie Underwood performing Lynn's classic hits spanning 50 years. The album produced a Top 10 hit music video on Great American Country of the single \"Coal Miner's Daughter\", featuring Lynn, Miranda Lambert and Sheryl Crow. The track cracked the Billboard singles chart, making Lynn the only female country artist to chart in six decades. Lynn's concerts during this period included performances at the Nelsonville Music Festival in Nelsonville, Ohio, in May 2010,[52] and at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival on June 11, 2011.[53] In 2012, Lynn published her third autobiography, Honky Tonk Girl: My Life in Lyrics.[54] She also contributed \"Take Your Gun and Go, John\" to Divided & United: Songs of the Civil War, released on November 5, 2013.[55]\n\nIn November 2015, Lynn announced the completion of a new album, Full Circle. Released in March 2016, the album debuted at No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 200[56] and went on to become Lynn's 40th album to make the Top 10 on Billboard's best selling country chart. It featured a combination of new songs and classics, and duets with Elvis Costello and Willie Nelson.[57]\n\nLynn's holiday album White Christmas Blue was released in October 2016.[58] In December of the same year, Full Circle was nominated for Country Album of the Year in the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.[59]\n\nFollowing Full Circle, the album Wouldn't It Be Great was released by Legacy Recordings in September 2018 after being delayed by health issues, which had caused Lynn to cancel all of her scheduled tour dates in 2017.[60][61] Lynn was named Artist of a Lifetime by CMT in 2018.[62] On October 19, 2019, Lifetime aired the movie Patsy & Loretta which highlighted the friendship of Lynn and Patsy Cline.[63]\n\nOn March 19, 2021, Lynn released her 50th studio album Still Woman Enough, the fourth album of her deal with Legacy Recordings. Recorded in sessions at Cash Cabin in Tennessee, it features Carrie Underwood and Reba McEntire on the title track, alongside duets with Tanya Tucker and Margo Price on re-recordings of \"You Ain't Woman Enough\" and \"One's on the Way\", respectively.[64]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMarriage\n\n[edit]\n\nLynn was married to Oliver Vanetta \"Doolittle\" Lynn (August 27, 1926 – August 22, 1996) almost 50 years until her husband died at age 69. On January 10, 1948, 15-year-old Loretta Webb married 21-year-old Oliver Vanetta Lynn, better known as \"Doolittle\", \"Doo\", or \"Mooney\".[65] They had met only a month earlier. The Lynns left Kentucky and moved to the northwest Washington state logging community of Custer when Lynn was seven months pregnant with the first of their six children.[5] The happiness and heartache of her early years of marriage would help to inspire Lynn's songwriting.[16] In her 2002 autobiography, Still Woman Enough, and in an interview with CBS News the same year, she recounted how her husband cheated on her regularly and once left her while she was giving birth.[28] Lynn and her husband fought frequently, but she said that \"he never hit me one time that I didn't hit him back twice.\" Loretta said that her marriage was \"one of the hardest love stories\".[page needed] In one of her autobiographies, she recalled:\n\nI married Doo when I wasn't but a child, and he was my life from that day on. But as important as my youth and upbringing was, there's something else that made me stick to Doo. He thought I was something special, more special than anyone else in the world, and never let me forget it. That belief would be hard to shove out the door. Doo was my security, my safety net. And just remember, I'm explainin', not excusin'... Doo was a good man and a hard worker. But he was an alcoholic, and it affected our marriage all the way through.\n\nChildren\n\n[edit]\n\nLoretta and her husband had six children together. Their eldest daughter, Betty Sue, was born on November 26, 1948, and died of complications associated with emphysema on July 29, 2013.[68][69] Second child and eldest son, Jack Benny Lynn, born December 7, 1949, was found dead by drowning on July 24, 1984, after going missing while horse riding on his mother's Hurricane Mills ranch.[70][71] Their third and fourth children are Ernest Ray Lynn, born May 27, 1951, and Clara Marie \"Cissie\" Lynn, born less than a year later on April 7, 1952.[72] Their youngest children, twin daughters Peggy Jean and Patsy Eileen, were born on August 6, 1964; they are named after Lynn's sister, Peggy Sue Wright, and her friend, Patsy Cline.[72] Patsy's daughter and Loretta's granddaughter, Emmy Russell, auditioned for season 22 of American Idol, making the cut and earning the golden ticket to Hollywood.[73]\n\nLoretta Lynn's Ranch\n\n[edit]\n\nLynn owned a ranch in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee, known as Loretta Lynn's Ranch. Billed as \"the seventh largest attraction in Tennessee\",[74] it features a recording studio, museums, lodging, restaurants, and western stores. Traditionally, three holiday concerts are hosted annually at the ranch, Memorial Day Weekend, Fourth of July Weekend, and Labor Day Weekend.[75][76]\n\nSince 1982, the ranch has hosted Loretta Lynn's Amateur Championship motocross race, the largest amateur motocross race of its kind. The ranch also hosts GNCC Racing events. The centerpiece of the ranch is its large plantation home which Lynn once resided in with her husband and children. She had not lived in the antebellum mansion in more than 30 years prior to her death. Lynn regularly greeted fans who were touring the house. A replica of the cabin in which Lynn grew up in Butcher Hollow is one of its main features.[75][77]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the height of her popularity, some of Lynn's songs were banned from radio airplay, including \"Rated \"X\"\", about the double standards divorced women face; \"Wings Upon Your Horns\", about the loss of teenage virginity; and \"The Pill\", about a wife and mother becoming liberated by the birth-control pill.
