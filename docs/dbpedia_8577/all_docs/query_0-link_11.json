        "text": "It’s the early 2000s, so dust off your VHS camcorder and your punk audio cassettes and come along for the ride with The New Normals, a young queer Canadian indie band, as they escape their small town for the excitement and promise of Toronto. The lead singer, Evan, is a trans guy with a gift for songwriting and a desire to live life to the fullest. He writes the songs with his girlfriend Isis who plays the keyboard. They’ve got a cis guy drummer in love with a cis girl bassist. And then there is Lou, the introverted lead guitarist.\n\nBased on the 2017 short film of the same name that played at Frameline42, this indie punk trans new wave feature refreshingly throws a trans guy into the spotlight without feeling the need to focus on his transness. We Forgot to Break Up instead asks the crucial question: Can The New Normals survive a love triangle and overnight success?"
