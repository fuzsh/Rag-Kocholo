        "text": "CARNIVAL CELEBRATION: GREAT FUN TOGETHER, ALL POWERED BY LNG\n\nYou know, it’s hard work making effortlessly-fun vacations. That’s why we’re looking forward to kicking back with you on the new Carnival Celebration as we toast to the last 50 years. So please bring that unique Carnival spirit... and know that this ship’s bringing the fun. Just like sister ship Mardi Gras®, Carnival Celebration has six Zones — themed areas that bring together incredible experiences and flavor. New flavors you haven’t experienced yet — nobody has! — are heating up at Latitudes™, The Golden Jubilee™ and Emeril’s Bistro 1397™. (Mmm, new Emeril.) Carnival Celebration also marks the return of innovations like BOLT® — our onboard rollercoaster, Bonsai Teppanyaki™, RedFrog® Tiki Bar, Family Feud™ Live, Havana Bar™, Seuss at Sea™, and Playlist Productions™. Perhaps best of all, all the fun you’ll have on Carnival Celebration is powered by clean LNG fuel!\n\nread more\n\nMEET THE GODMOTHER\n\nIt’s Cassidy Gifford! We all know Cassidy’s mom, Kathie Lee Gifford, from some of the most memorable moments in Carnival’s history. But among Kathie Lee’s proudest accomplishments is definitely her daughter, who’s now serving as godmother to Carnival Celebration. (Just as Kathie Lee did for the original M.S. Celebration!) Cassidy grew up around Carnival, spending countless family vacations at sea, and plenty of time on the set of TV shoots… which she still does today — Cassidy’s an actress. We can’t wait to welcome both daughter and mother aboard this amazing ship!\n\nread more\n\nMEET THE NAMING CEREMONY\n\nNew ships usually start sailing with a naming ceremony, to help send the ship on its way with everyone’s best wishes. But you can probably guess that when Carnival does a naming ceremony, it’s all that… plus a show, plus a party! For Carnival Celebration this involved the ship’s godmother Cassidy Gifford and her mom, Carnival legend Kathie Lee. Plenty of other fun folks were on-hand, including Emeril, who was there to cut the ribbon at his new restaurant, Bistro 1397… and the whole event coincided with the big ribbon cutting of the amazing Terminal F at PortMiami. Now that’s what we call a naming! Let’s sail!\n\nread more\n\nCelebration Central\n\nCelebration Central is designed to make an impression… and that’s good because it’s going to be your first one! You can count on Carnival Celebration’s atrium to set the vacay vibes for your whole cruise. Look up and you’re honestly in for an eyeful — floor-to-ceiling windows, 14-foot LED screens, a ceiling of 1,400 color-changing lights… everything points to BIG FUN happening in here. And even if you’re just passing through, know that you’ll definitely be back later. Center Stage features a rotating selection of live entertainment, while Tropicale Bar serves up great drinks with a nostalgia chaser nodding to our first ship to sport the iconic red, white and blue funnel. Aquaria Bar features an ocean-themed glass mural pulled from Carnival Victory that’s now a two-deck high decorative wall. (Also: great drinks here too!) Then there’s fan-faves, from cups of comfort at JavaBlue™ Café to great eats at Bonsai Sushi™ and Bonsai Teppanyaki™, and some very entertaining reasons to come back, like Piano Bar 88, The Punchliner Comedy Club™ and more.\n\nread more\n\nThe Gateway\n\nWhen you’re cruising on Carnival Celebration there’s just so much destination to be found… even right on board. That’s because here, in The Gateway zone, “international flavor” isn’t just an expression, but a way of life! Design, décor, cuisine and even the entertainment is inspired by grand locations, landmarks from around the world. You’ll find a rotating selection of these vistas brilliantly displayed right on the innovative LED windows and ceiling, plus theme nights that match — including Abroad in Europe, Far East Voyage and Mexico Lindo — which each feature food, drink and entertainment to match. But every moment is a special occasion thanks to onboard spots that are proud to import their flavor from all over. We’re talking restaurants and bars like Latitudes™ with its old-school railway station vibe, The Golden Jubilee™ featuring a unique mix of great drinks and live music, plus Emeril’s Bistro 1397™, which is deliciously all over the map. And don’t miss your chance to sip a little cocktail magic at returning fan-favorite Alchemy Bar®.\n\nread more\n\nSummer Landing\n\nGo ahead and call Summer Landing 'the greatest chill spot at sea'... and we'll be right there with you, any time of year! What's three letters long and goes great with chilling outdoors? BBQ, so we're building a Guy's Pig & Anchor Smokehouse | Brewhouse into this zone so it always tastes like summer here with freshly-smoked faves designed by Guy Fieri and original Parched Pig® beers brewed just feet away. If you're wondering where the pool and whirlpool are, we're so alike, you and us... and that's why we're sure you're gonna love The Watering Hole, a poolside bar we're building for aficionados of backyard-style relaxation. And for military folks — or folks who just want to raise a glass to them — please report to Heroes Tribute™ Lounge for great service. We know you guys like soft serve too, so we're throwing in a Swirls™ location — one of two! And why wouldn't we? At Summer Landing, fun this cool is literally always in season.\n\nread more\n\n820 Biscayne\n\nWe’re at home anywhere we sail… but you can only have one hometown, and for Carnival that is unmistakably Miami. So it’s not hard at all to locate the inspiration for 820 Biscayne on Carnival Celebration. If you’re wondering about the nameplate, that’s the address where it all got started — but nobody has to wonder where all the fun, flavor and good looks you’ll find in this zone were sourced. After all, it’s so authentically Miami… just check out the art deco designs, neon splashes and great flavors! On that note there’s Bar 820 for tropical cocktails and Cuban coffee, plus Deco Deli serving up a selection of classic sandwiches… Cuban faves included. And while Miami isn’t quite known as a pizza town, we don’t think you’ll mind that we’re serving up the cheesy stuff until 4 a.m. at Miami Slice. (Roll up your sleeves and dig in!) And like any cosmopolitan center, dining quality and variety counts big. That’s why you’ll find Cucina del Capitano and Rudi’s Seagrill restaurants in the neighborhood.\n\nread more\n\nLido\n\nIf you’ve cruised with us before, you know Lido... but aboard Carnival Celebration® this poolside zone features even more delicious and fun experiences among the familiar flavors. Evolving the classic poolside rum-bar was a tall order, but RedFrog Tiki Bar will be serving up the good stuff across two decks’ worth of South Pacific atmosphere. Also first-time-fresh is Street Eats, bringing together highlights from the world’s fast-good cuisine like kebab, bao buns and seriously upgraded fries. Shaq’s latest Big Chicken™ restaurant is here, and fan-fave spots like Guy’s Burger Joint™, the New England-inspired Seafood Shack™, and BlueIguana Cantina™ taco spot aren’t done with your taste buds yet. And for folks hoping we haven’t forgotten: yes, Lido is absolutely home to one of two Swirls™ locations, the free soft-serve spot!\n\nread more\n\nTHE ULTIMATE PLAYGROUND\n\nDon't let the name fool you — this zone is ages everybody and up. Kids, you're going to love this. And adults, the playground has grown up with you. So yay for play! Of course The Ultimate Playground starts with BOLT®, the first rollercoaster at sea, an all-electric thrill ride that puts the power of speed in your hands. But that's only the beginning — this playground has the largest Carnival WaterWorks™ ever with three huge spiraling slides, plus SportSquare™ is here featuring an entire mini-golf course, full-court basketball and a ropes course. And, of course, more. Ultimate enough for you?\n\nread more\n\nBOLT: ULTIMATE SEA COASTER\n\nadditional\n\nAboard Carnival Celebration® you’ll meet BOLT®: the fastest — and first! — rollercoaster at sea. Strap in and zoom your motorcycle-style speed machine around an open-air course high, high above sea level. You know how on most rollercoasters... actually, never mind. Forget other coasters because this all-electric thrill ride puts you in the driver’s seat. That means you actually get to control how fast you go, so hit the gas and try for the fastest time, go for the biggest thrill — plus some amazing 360° ocean views! And for the folks who choose to chill: go light on the pedal, and this just might be the coaster for you!\n\nread more\n\nSpace Cruisers\n\nincluded\n\nExploration is one reason we love Carnival cruises, but why stop at the seas? For cruisers ages 2–11, there’s a new vacation experience introducing kids at Camp Ocean to the wonder of space exploration. Space Cruisers™, debuting on Carnival Celebration, was developed in partnership with the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, so budding astronomy fans can enjoy NASA-inspired activities to help them blast off to a love of the cosmos. Activities vary by age group, but some include designing a personal mission patch, building and racing Mars Rovers, designing and testing bridge physics, playing space-themed bingo, plus hands-on learning about how objects orbit in space. 3, 2, 1… FUN!\n\nread more\n\nLatitudes\n\nadditional\n\nThe classic railway-inspired mechanical flap board is definitely the first thing you’ll notice about Latitudes™, but what sticks with you about this bar may just be something else. For instance, the drinks: specialty cocktails crafted not just to refresh, not merely to delight… but to actually match the scenery. What scenery, you’re wondering? At Latitudes no matter where we’re sailing, the views come to you from any corner of the world. Innovative virtual windows invite you to take in some of Earth’s most breathtaking views as you sit back and sip something delicious, whether you’re here for a special event, an occasion celebration… or simply a delicious departure from the ordinary.\n\nread more\n\nFamily Feud Live\n\nincluded\n\nThe show has been delighting viewers at home for generations, but you never had the chance to buzz-in on a cruise ship… until now! Carnival ships are the only place you’ll find Family Feud™ Live, and on every sailing we’ll be hosting games on an authentic Family Feud™ set — right down to the iconic Face-Off podium, plus all the excitement of Fast Money. Family Feud Live will be emceed by none other than your cruise director, so if you’re game, sign up your team of five for an audition… and make sure they bring that Family Feud spirit. And, of course, everybody’s welcome to grab a seat in the audience to catch all the hilarious action!\n\nread more\n\nWATERWORKS\n\nincluded\n\nFor those who flock to waterparks just ready to make a splash, we’d suggest sliding on over to WaterWorks™ aboard Carnival Celebration®. Three large-scale spiraling slides, a giant dumping bucket, twin racing slides and more — you know, the works — are all practically overflowing for your hydro-delight. When you spot the big slides on board you’ll see that they mean business, splashy business: Blue Lightning™ is packed with headfirst, high-speed twists and turns, while Orange Thunder™ starts you off standing before propelling you down into a world of wetness… and of course, our signature Twister™ slide keeps on thrilling splash-seekers.\n\nread more\n\nCENTER STAGE + PLAYLIST PRODUCTIONS\n\nincluded\n\nThey’re not plays, they’re not exactly concerts… these shows are something else entirely. Every performances is built on amazing songs you know and love, presented like you’ve never seen before. Multi-talented performers fill the stage with song, dance... and superstar attitude. Then they sometimes leave the stage behind, like in The Most Magnificent Circus and We Are One where they soar above the audience. Or Color My World, a show where they break into actual live-graffiti painting, right on stage. Carnival Celebration plays host to a lineup of all-new shows, plus fan-favorites Celestial Strings, which reimagines rock and pop favorites as symphonic classical compositions, and Amor Cubano with the rhythmic sounds of today’s Latin hits.\n\nread more\n\nSERENITY ADULT-ONLY RETREAT\n\nincluded\n\nSomebody at Carnival knows just what you need, and it's pretty much exactly the Serenity Adult-Only Retreat™. Look, you'll still be on the same ship as the kids, the hoopla, and all the Carnival-style excitement... but you could easily forget, because when you're at Serenity you could not be further from it all. The world you'll find yourself in is one of complete peace, sea breezes and, of course, a nearby bar. It's the place to get done the kind of stuff you just can't seem to do anywhere else — reconnect with your partner, finish that book, or do absolutely, blissfully, nothing at all.\n\nread more\n\nThe Golden Jubilee\n\nadditional\n\nEven when you’re looking to the future, you still think about the past. So that’s why — if you were us — you might pay tribute to 50 years of Carnival fun and history by creating a space like The Golden Jubilee™! The atmosphere makes you want to grab a vintage cocktail (lucky for you, that’s the house specialty) and raise a glass with your neighbor… but this bar is just as much an entertainment spot, helping the good times flow with a stage that puts you up close to live performances. The décor transports you decades back through time, and this aesthetic is made of actual artifacts from Carnival ships of the past, mixed with design elements inspired by our earliest ships. Outside, there’s even a Carnival history exhibit! They built great stuff back then, and we still do! This may just remind you to think about the fun history you’re creating throughout your vacation.\n\nread more\n\nCLOUD 9 SPA\n\nadditional\n\nTrue or false: cruises are a time for relaxation.

You can count on these comedians to not hold back either. Since some of them get up and say exactly what’s on their mind, we also schedule family-friendly performances… so the only red faces in the audience are from laughing a little too hard.\n\nread more\n\nEmeril's Bistro 1397\n\nadditional\n\nEmeril’s second restaurant at sea does something a little different. While the heart of Emeril’s Bistro 1397™ is in the same delicious place — his hometown Creole dishes from New Orleans — the new restaurant also keeps its passport at the ready, collecting extra flavor inspiration from every corner of the world. Then it serves up international dishes… all with Emeril’s signature culinary flair! From one day to the next you’ll find new stuff on the menu — so make sure to come back and see what surprising specialties are ready to delight you for breakfast, lunch or dinner.\n\nread more\n\nCucina del Capitano\n\nincluded\n\nAt Cucina del Capitano® on Carnival Celebration®, who you’ve got gathered around the table is truly as important as what’s being served there.

Your first meal at Cucina del Capitano is on the house… and additional visits are just $8.\n\nread more\n\nBig Chicken\n\nincluded\n\nWhen Shaq tells you to build a chicken joint on board, you start warming up immediately. The big guy brings his poultry know-how and good taste to the seas with Big Chicken™ on Carnival Celebration®. Just like Shaq’s a multitalented entertainer, his restaurant is no one-trick chick. Step up to the counter for lunch or dinner and walk away with your choice of chicken sandwiches, crispy chicken strips or juicy fried chicken baskets... plus side dishes like potato salad and jalapeño slaw. Early-morning buzzer-beaters are invited to enjoy a breakfast of classics like chicken biscuits, a three-cheese omelet or our biscuit/egg combo featuring bacon or sausage. Snoozers are invited, too — breakfast is served until 3!\n\nread more\n\nRudi’s Seagrill\n\nadditional\n\nRudi’s Seagrill™ is the brainchild of cookbook author and master chef Rudi Sodamin. He has years of experience pleasing palates of vacationers… and this guy loves serving up a smile as much as Carnival does! But he’s serious about seafood, and an evening at Rudi’s proves it through the courses. Enjoy selections like seafood bisque and crab-stuffed lobster tail imperial — all served with an elegant flair that pays proper tribute to the beauty of the ocean from which so much fun, and flavor, arises.\n\nread more\n\nBonsai Teppanyaki\n\nadditional\n\nIt’s a meal, a performance, and it’s definitely unforgettable.

That’s right, when you’re just feet from the chef, you know they’re cooking to impress! Street Eats is Carnival’s tribute to this food phenomenon, with three ever-changing open-air stations. The first, Steam Dream, specializes in the steamiest stuff this side of the spa, featuring favorites like bao buns and pot stickers. Then there’s Mad Sizzle, which puts the “skill” in skillet with the likes of kebab and satay. And we’re definitely not about to forget Time Fries, which serves up every cruiser’s dream: fries loaded up with culinary creations from our chefs, like cheesesteak fries! On Carnival Celebration® you may be far from the street, but flavor’s right around the corner.\n\nread more\n\nSeafood Shack\n\nadditional\n\nA good seafood dish… mmm, quite the catch.

Steer a course for Carnival Celebration®... that’s where you’ll find this little shack by the sea, wherever in the world you happen to be!\n\nread more\n\nSTATEROOM DESIGN\n\nDesign is more than just the way things look — it's as much about how they work. And staterooms aboard Carnival Celebration® are packed with innovative changes to both. It's the way the ring-lit vanity mirror lights you evenly and shadow-free as you get ready. How the ottoman cushion flips over to serve as an extra table. And even those reading lights, recessed into the wall so you can read in bed without waking anyone! These details are really more than just details. Better comfort, lighting and storage all spring from a deep understanding we've developed around how people actually use their staterooms… and how small changes to the room add up to make the experience that much better. (Enough USB charging ports for everybody’s stuff? Oh yes!) Thoughtful, guest-centric design is how we do it… and all this in-room convenience comes paired with a fresh new look.\n\nread more\n\nHavana Staterooms & Suites\n\nConsider your Havana stateroom or suite your own island resort aboard Carnival Celebration®. Most important is the exclusive location: near the Havana Bar & Pool. This relaxation pool is your members-only spot, and the bar's a fun-for-all hotspot when the sun goes down. Indoors, all Havana staterooms feature a unique décor, but step up to a Havana Cabana for an extra-large outdoor chill space. Step into a Havana Cabana suite for even more space, plus a luxurious rain shower.

Designed for kicking back al fresco, you’re in for some amazing ocean views… views so stunning you’ll just have to feel ‘em to believe ‘em.\n\nread more\n\nSuites\n\nGet all the comforts of home, and even a few extras. Since your huge Suite on Carnival Celebration® affords you VIP status, you're in the priority line when getting on and off the ship… plus Suites come with exclusive perks! (Carnival Excel Suites pack even more, like concierge service and access to Loft 19™.) A Suite is the ultimate way to enjoy the ship, and the extra comfort definitely goes a long way, with more room to put your feet up or stretch out on the extra-large balcony.\n\nread more\n\nLOFT 19\n\nLoft 19™ was designed to afford you a unique opportunity for relaxation and indulgence. This retreat-style space invites you to soak up the sun all day from the comfort of a lounge chair or infinity whirlpool. This pairs so perfectly with Carnival Excel suites that staying in one actually gets you Loft 19 access! Drink service is always close at hand, plus you can even opt for a little private time — renting a cabana gets you more than just a place in the shade, but extras like fresh fruit, chilled towels, lunch delivery and concierge service. (Cabana rentals are open to everyone, though guests in Carnival Excel-level suites enjoy priority reservations.)\n\nread more"
