I am a fan, love their music.\n\n“I think it’s an envy thing, for being as high profile as they are,” Povaschuk added. “There’s been no dirt dug up on them, so I don’t understand the hate. I would say 90 per cent of the people in Hanna love them.”\n\nHe said one of the signs is to be moved near the town’s tourist information office, which will still give fans a chance for selfies. Another sign is to go to the local museum and the third has been given to former National Hockey League star Lanny McDonald, who is also from Hanna, to put in a restaurant he has in Montana.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nPovaschuk said there was a serious collision near one of the signs last spring when a vehicle was doing a U-turn to get to the sign. However, he said highway safety isn’t the reason the signs were removed.\n\nThe old signs were made of wood and in serious disrepair, he said.\n\nAn older electronic sign just off the highway is being refurbished and a new “Home of Nickelback” sign will be added, the mayor said.\n\nThere are no statues of lead singer Chad Kroeger and company in the town, but a number of murals of their past albums are proudly displayed.\n\n“The lady that did the album covers for us had moved away and we’ve commissioned her to come back and do the latest two album covers for us,” Povaschuk said.\n\nHe said the members of the band have continued to support their hometown, providing items for fundraisers. In the past, Kroeger and bandmate Ryan Peake have played at Hannapalooza, a local music festival, under the band’s original name, Village Idiot.\n\n“They’re still a very important component as to what we are.”\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
