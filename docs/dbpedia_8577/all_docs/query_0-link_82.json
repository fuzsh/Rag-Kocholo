        "text": "Danielle Hendricks Reyes is the runner-up of Big Brother 3 (US). She later competed on Big Brother 7 (US) and Big Brother: Reindeer Games.\n\nOn Big Brother 3 (US), Danielle started off on the outs of the game not being a part of the majority Cartel alliance. Due to Danielle’s game-long alliance and friendship with Jason Guy and her strategic skills. Danielle was able to take control of the game alongside Jason. After her ally Lisa Donahue won the final Head of Household competition, she brought Danielle with her to the final two. On Finale Night, Danielle lost the jury vote to Lisa as many of the jurors felt bitter about her diary rooms. Danielle was crowned the runner-up, only receiving a jury vote from her friend and ally Jason to win.\n\nOn Big Brother 7 (US), Danielle returned for All-Stars and was immediately targeted for being a strong strategic player. Throughout the season, she often campaigned to get out the Sovereign Six alliance. She was also a member of The Legion of Doom alliance that consisted of herself, James Rhine, Mike Malin, and Will Kirby, with the goal of evicting Janelle Pierzina. When her closest ally James was evicted in Week 7, the Legion of Doom was no more as Danielle vowed to go after Chilltown for their betrayal. When her ally Erika Landin won the Head of Household competition in Week 8, it seemed like Danielle was safe. Unfortunately for her, after Erika's target Janelle won the PoV, Mike and Will convinced Erika that Danielle was a major threat, which resulted in her being evicted by a unanimous 3-0 vote during the first half of the Double Eviction, placing 6th and becoming the fourth member of the jury.\n\nBecause of her social game and strong strategic abilities, she is often regarded as one of the greatest houseguests in Big Brother history and is named \"Greatest Player to Never Win\" by fans and many previous players, including Will Kirby.\n\nBiography[]\n\nRetrived from CBS.com\n\nAge: 30\n\nMarital Status: Married\n\nFrom: Fairfield, CA\n\nFavorites\n\nThree adjectives that best describe me: Strong minded, outgoing, sassy\n\nFavorite film: Pulp Fiction\n\nFavorite TV show: CSI\n\nFavorite actor: Robert De Niro\n\nFavorite actress: Cate Blanchett\n\nFavorite band: Queen, with Freddie Mercury\n\nFavorite hobbies: Exercising cooking, reading, dreaming that I'm going to win 500K!\n\nPersonal hero: My grandmother\n\nQ&A\n\nWhy did you want to be on BIG BROTHER? I had my first child at 16. I was married and pregnant with my second child by 20. Since then, my youth and my life have been dedicated to my family. I have no Danielle time. This is my opportunity to be a teenager again.\n\nWhat strengths do you bring to BIG BROTHER? I am always thinking ahead. I'm a natural leader.\n\nWhat weaknesses do you bring to BIG BROTHER? I'm a leader, not a follower. I am such an extrovert, people naturally like me as a person. I don't want to be too liked.\n\nWhat comfort item from home will you miss the most?: I'll miss TV. I'll miss my tacky pink robe (I've had it so long). I'll miss movies (I'm a movie junkie).\n\nWhat type of news from the outside world will you miss the most? Sports, preseason football. Who got traded? What's going on?\n\nDo you tend to perform better in physical or mental competitions? Most women would state mental. They expect men to dominate in the physical competition. Me? I'm all physical. All the men would want me on their team. Don't let my good looks fool you. I can get down and dirty with the men.\n\nHow do you plan to win BIG BROTHER? As innocent as a dove and sly as a snake. People will underestimate me. I will be fake as my implants. As soon as I step foot in the house, the game is on! Everyone there is my enemy.

She has since expressed her desire to compete on Survivor instead. She was replaced by Nicole Anthony.\n\nDanielle was interviewed for the Big Brother: 25th Anniversary Celebration ahead of Big Brother 25.\n\nDanielle, Britney Haynes and Frankie Grande appeared in the Big Brother 25 premiere, \"breaking into\" the new house in an attempt to change their fate from prior seasons, but when it backfired they accidentally unleashed the twist of the season onto the new houseguests.\n\nThe three later appeared in the season finale where they again broke into the new house, this time introducing Big Brother: Reindeer Games.\n\nDanielle has expressed desires to compete on other reality shows such as Survivor, House of Villains, The Challenge and The Traitors.[6]\n\nDanielle competed on the third season of Peacock's The Traitors with fellow Big Brother: Reindeer Games houseguest Britney. Derrick Levasseur is also rumored to have joined the cast later.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nDanielle is the first female to win the Power of Veto.\n\nShe is also the first houseguest to not use the Power of Veto.\n\nDanielle is the first African-American to win a Power of Veto competition.\n\nSince Big Brother 3, Danielle, along with Jason Guy, Derrick Levasseur, Jillian MacLaughlin, Anthony Douglas, Enzo Palumbo (on Big Brother 22), Todrick Hall and Bowie Jane Ball are the only houseguests to never be nominated until the final three.\n\nShe is the first runner-up not to go on the block until the final 3.
