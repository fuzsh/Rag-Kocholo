        "text": "The Institute for Public Administration (IPA) at the University of Delaware celebrated its legacy of applied research, professional development and the education of tomorrow’s leaders at its 50th anniversary celebration at Clayton Hall in October. IPA was established in 1973 by its founder and current director, Jerome R. Lewis.\n\nAs a research and public service center in the Joseph R. Biden, Jr. School of Public Policy and Administration, IPA’s 50th anniversary celebration brought together state leaders, alumni, faculty, staff, students and friends for a full day of festivities. The ceremony featured a dignified guest list of Delaware state and University leaders, including Gov. John Carney, U.S. Sen. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, Delaware State Sen. David Sokola and Delaware State Speaker Valerie Longhurst, along with UD President Dennis Assanis.\n\nThe morning session began with introductory remarks made by Biden School Dean Amy Ellen Schwartz. She introduced Lewis and read an official presidential letter sent directly from the Oval Office to Graham Hall. In his letter, President Biden stated, “For half a century, the Institute for Public Administration has embraced the responsibility of preparing students to succeed by equipping them with the resources they need to thrive in careers devoted to uplifting others.”\n\nThese sentiments were echoed throughout the day as alumni discussed how IPA served as a launching pad for their current careers and livelihoods while also allowing them to positively impact their communities. This was evident in the event’s archive room, where historical memorabilia showcased photos, documents, pamphlets, research studies and a timeline that walked guests through the history of IPA. A video featuring several alumni lit up the room with memorable stories and well wishes to IPA on reaching its golden year.\n\nOne clip showcased Savannah Edwards, AICP, a 2017 graduate of the master of public administration program and planner at the Rossi Group.\n\n“IPA, congratulations on fifty years of excellence and making Delaware known for more than just one type of IPA,” Edwards said. “Over the past 50 years, you have fostered a group of leaders who are sincerely and deeply committed to public service. A number of individuals like myself built the foundation for their careers at IPA … The numerous connections I established while at IPA continue to aid me in my career and have led to valuable friendships.”\n\nOther alumni expressed their gratitude for finding their first job by way of IPA, helping them to embark on successful careers. Some alumni referenced the infamous white University minivan as a vehicle that held great memories as they traveled across the state for events, internships and other programs.\n\nA history of the Biden School and IPA\n\nDuring the remainder of the morning session, Daniel Rich, professor of public policy emeritus at the Biden School and IPA senior fellow, discussed the dynamic history of IPA, explaining its roots and how it all came about. From program updates to name changes, IPA is no stranger to transitions. IPA was originally named the Delaware Public Administration Institute, and it was housed within the Division of Urban Affairs.\n\nIn 1996, the Delaware Public Administration Institute transitioned into the Institute for Public Administration, focusing on program expansion across the state of Delaware, promoting local government technical assistance, growing professional staff and providing professional development workshops and seminars. Although it has faced many changes, one thing that has not changed about IPA is its commitment to bringing optimal value to Delaware through its continued support of local governments, state agencies and students.\n\nThroughout his speech, Rich emphasized that IPA has continuously served as a great example for 21st century research centers. For many years, other policy programs and departments across the nation have sought out the expertise of this research center to develop their own. As Rich put it, “The Biden School and IPA are pillars of a 21st century engaged land-grant university.”"
