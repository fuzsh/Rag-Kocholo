        "text": "Clive Lewis MP was sworn in in the House of Commons yesterday\n\nControversy struck at the House of Commons yesterday when Labour MP and representative for Norwich South, Clive Lewis, staged a protest during his swearing in. An MP since 2015, Mr Lewis aimed to express his desires for a republic in Britain.\n\nLaw dictates members from both Houses of Parliament must take an oath of allegiance towards the Crown, His Majesty King Charles III. Without taking this oath, MPs cannot participate in debates, vote, claim their seat or receive a salary.\n\n‌\n\nNeglecting to do so may result in a £500 fine and lead to their seat being declared vacant \"as if they were dead\". This rule also applies to Members of the Lords, the UK Parliament reports.\n\nREAD MORE: Major Liverpool city centre project at the heart of Labour's plans\n\nThe surprising moment emerged on Wednesday, July 10, when Clive Lewis, part of the Labour Party and a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, utilised his swearing-in ceremony to voice his opposition to the concept of a monarchy. Mr Lewis shared news of his unconventional approach through a tweet: \"To be sworn in as an MP, you have to make an oath to the King. This is what I decided to say, in protest.\"\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from The Merseyside Report\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

More info\n\nThe full video can be viewed below:\n\nIn the footage Mr Lewis shared of himself performing the oath, he declared: \"I take this oath under protest, and in the hope that one day my fellow citizens will democratically decide to live in a republic. Until that time, I do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles, according to law.\"\n\n‌\n\nMr Lewis's actions sparked a storm of criticism on Twitter, with him being labelled a 'coward' and a 'disgrace' by several disgruntled people, reports the Mirror. Melanie Cycles tweeted: \"Meaningless virtue signalling. Either refuse to do it and stand by your actual convictions, or just do it as it should be done. But this isn't a protest it's empty posturing and virtue signalling.\"\n\nAnother commenter, tweeting under the handle 'Protect_ServeUK', vented: \"I'm sorry if you can't do this properly you should be marched out, and told that until such time as you can, then you're not an MP. Imagine police officers doing this during their oath of office's ceremonies. Disgusting.\"\n\n‌\n\nHowever, some people sided with Mr Lewis, referring to him as 'iconic'. Another user, Harvey, responded: \"The responses to this was so weird. Be a monarchist all you like, no need to insult Clive Lewis for disagreeing with you. Frankly, the opinion of a single backbencher shouldn't affect you that much.\"\n\nVik also chimed in stating: \"Incredible comments under this. An MP expressing a political opinion and communicating it to the voting public while also clearly expressing loyalty to the head of state is merely \"posturing\" and \"shouldn't be an MP\". Do the public know what politics is?.\""
