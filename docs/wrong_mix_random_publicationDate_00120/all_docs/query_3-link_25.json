        "text": "(1921-2016) Born in Shawnee, OK in 1921, Ashabranner died in 2016 at age 95. After graduating from OSU with a Masters in English, he taught at OSU for several years. In 1955, he accepted a curriculum development position in Ethiopia, leaving the US with his wife and two young daughters. For the next 30 years, Ashabranner worked in Libya, started the first Peace Corps Program in Nigeria, was the Peace Corps Director in India, and then the Deputy Director of the Peace Corps from 1967-1969. After serving for 10 years in the Philippines and Indonesia with the Ford Foundation, Ashabranner retired in 1985. In his retirement he wrote over 30 books for junior readers on cross-cultural topics and won over 40 awards for this body of work.\n\n\"[The Choctaw Code is] one of the very best books I've ever read for this age group. Through his Choctaw friend, Tom learns many things about the forest, its occupants, and people. He learns some things that will make him a much stronger man as he grows older. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about friendship and honor.\" - Renee\n\n\"[Crossover is] An amazing first novel! Quinn Baldwin will be someone to read for years to come. This book was sci-fiction about time-travel, history, family, and divorce. He wrote with words that any teenager might feel as the family comes apart. A successful, acceptable \"new normal\" is found at the end of the book for this loving family. It had the feel of a \"boy book\" even though the main character was a female. Lots of adventure and great character development, I would recommend this book to any young middle school friend. It was a thrilling, suspenseful story that wouldn't let me put it down.\" - Dosha\n\nPolly Basore was born and raised in Stillwater, Oklahoma. After graduating from Oklahoma State University with a Bachelor’s degree in journalism, Polly left Stillwater to pursue big-city dreams that took her to New York, Moscow and Washington, D.C, before settling in Witchita, KS in 1998. She spent 15 years as a journalist, and the following 15 exploring a variety of professions, including nonprofit communications director, grant writer, college adjunct professor, and philanthropist. Her three children’s books and two adult memoirs are written with purposeful vulnerability meant to engender compassion and inspire hope. Polly’s books are available at the Stillwater Public Library and on Amazon. Learn more about Polly on her website.\n\n“[In What Heaven Left Behind] Polly Basore chronicles how she triumphed over personal loss and despair to use an unexpected inheritance to become a vehicle for helping those who truly need it. She very honestly tells the reader of the pain she felt and mistakes she made on the way. Anyone who has experienced similar losses in their lives can easily relate to her feelings, but few of us use them to do so much good. I believe this very personal memoir will also do many people a lot of good.” - Frank Dudgeon\n\n“In today's world it seems harder to find ways to get children off of the computerized games to connect with them in a fun and entertaining way. [Action Games] is chock-full of vBarious ways for children who can follow directions to connect with each other in a Physical Education class setting. The greatest thing I found in reading this book is many of the games appear to be easy to modify for out of the classroom setting like birthday parties or family reunions for ages 6-50.” - Jewel Sample\n\nCaleb’s passion for ministry is rooted in his own life-changing experience of Christian hospitality. As a drug addict with a history of jail time, his future looked dark—until he encountered a group of believers who met him with acceptance instead of judgment. Caleb holds a B.A. from Oklahoma State University and a Master of Divinity degree from Gateway Seminary. He has worked as a college professor and a young adult pastor and currently works as an international recruitment specialist for OSU.\n\n“From crime to drug dealers to Turkey, to life in Christ—Caleb Camp does an awesome job detailing what the body of Christ can be. As the family of God, we have an exciting call to express the hospitality of God and be the family that millions of lonely people are looking for. I have a sense that this book will become the training manual that churches everywhere will want their small groups to use.” - Jason Peebles\n\n\"It was my pleasure to hear the author talk about this novel and to read passages from it [Paradise Love]. While I am a man and do not read romances, the passages were colorful, convincing, and would make a follower of the genre want to read on--and then share reflections with a friend or a book club. The author was quite eloquent on the topic of the rewards of writing and it was a delight to catch a glimpse at creativity in action.\" - Peter C. Rollins\n\n“Buy this book!! Alton Carter is a phenomenal guy, and you will love him after reading this book. Alton is as genuine in person as he is in his book. Overcoming adversity is something we all face at one time or another, but Alton does this with more courage than anyone I know. Alton will inspire you to make a positive difference in a child's life, just as caring adults have made in his. This is a must read!” - C. Prewitt\n\n“I absolutely loved this book! The 'Immortal Von B' combines a lot of elements I admittedly have a soft spot for...a spunky main character, rock music, Beethoven, and a sci-fi twist that brings the legendary composer into the modern world. This book has everything that makes the YA genre so fun to read - plenty of action, a main character you care about, and a great story that keeps you turning the pages. My only disappointment was that it ended way too soon. Bring on the sequel!” - Kyle West\n\nFred Causley has been a journalist, a working cowboy, a drywall professional and a freelance writer. With his wife, Mary, working to help feed the family, he graduated from Oklahoma State University in 1972 with a degree in agricultural journalism. He later obtained a master's degree in creative writing from OSU. In 1976, he began his career with the Department of Agricultural Journalism at Oklahoma State University. He served 25 years as an award winning science writer and editor, retiring in 2001. View his profile via his publisher's site wordandspiritpublishing.com.\n\n“The story is very creative and it is also well researched as there is a lot of historical information presented to bolster the plot as it progresses. The back-and-forth timeline enhances the build-up of heart pounding suspense. And though my tendency is to whizz through such storylines to find out what happens, I read it more slowly than usual. That is because the book is so cleverly written that it was fun to savor the artistry and craftsmanship used by the author to make her story come alive.” - Dana Williamson\n\nLisa Courtaway lives in Stillwater, Oklahoma and is married with four children. An entourage of four dogs and two cats follow her everywhere. She has worn many career-hats, from advertising to insurance to education. She loves a good ghost story, and has lived in several homes that spoke to her in mysterious ways. True crime stories, watching a binge-worthy series, reading, and taking care of her family are her favorites. Since she was young, people have often told her she should write a book ... so she did. Vist her website lisacourtaway.com.\n\n“I loved this book and not just because I grew up in Stillwater. Oh yes, I enjoyed the fun references to the old stomping grounds, but the story is the real star here. Creepy (in a good way) and full of suspense I was mesmerized from the beginning. I can’t wait for Lisa’s next contribution to the literary world!” - Maggie Yates\n\nWalt Cross has lived in the area since 1979 and is a Cushing and OSU graduate. Walt writes mostly non-fiction history books about the Old West and the military. He holds degrees in both history and science and is a combat veteran of the 7th U.S. Artillery. Born at Fort Hood, Texas, Walt is the son of a cavalryman as his father served in the 87th Cavalry. Go to this prolific author’s website to see additional titles or to purchase. His books are also available at the library.\n\n\"[Custer’s Lost Officer is a] Very readable and historically interesting account of the search for one of Custer's \"lost officers\" … Great detective work on the part of author Cross to track down both the actual remains and what probably happened to this young lieutenant…Cross provides a great deal of additional information about life in the US Cavalry during this campaign and insightful research on the battle itself. This is a fine read for those interested in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. If you want an ‘inside baseball’ look at an enigmatic participant in the battle and some CSI-style investigative work, it's a great book for you.\" - R. McNealy\n\n“Debora Davis has taken on a very challenging topic and presentation with this book. Five people are offered a day without consequences. Each of these people represent a literary archetype and make choices that many of the readers would make under the same circumstances...but as always there is a catch. And when the devil comes to collect his due, she does not shy from the results. There is no \"Hollywood\" style ending here where everyone ends up happily ever after. And kudos to her for having the guts to follow it through to the logical conclusion, even when she could have made herself a loophole. Anything else and I would have left feeling cheated. Debora has taken on quite a challenge. A multiple-viewpoint, intertwined story that many established writers would shy away from. She has met the challenge quite admirably.” - Michael Dean\n\n\"In 'Draftee,' Epplin deftly articulates his personal insights as a Vietnam draftee, the complex political and cultural history of the Vietnam War, and an elegant solution to our country’s Selective Service process, which survives largely unchanged to today. Epplin proposes a straightforward approach to democratize the country’s Selective Service process. His proposal would ensure that any future wars be fought by a representative sample of the US population. This would require every American, no matter their wealth or political connections, to have a little skin in the game when advocating for greater military involvement. Epplin’s proposal would also increase civic involvement and education, linking voluntary enrollment for future military service to participation as full citizens of the country. 'Draftee' proposes practical, powerful solutions to complex issues that have festered since the Vietnam Era.\" - A. Hanna\n\n“What a wonderful historical novel. I couldn't put it down, but of course, I did in order to let some of it be absorbed before I could enter into the story again. The author made me feel as if I were a silent witness to the unfolding of their love...a love that was strong enough for me to be a part of it, not as a stranger but someone who could fully understand their joys and sorrows. I like historical novels for just that reason. It's not just history that I'm reading but history that I'm experiencing. This was a powerful love story about two very real people living in an era made enticing and exciting by the author’s knowledge of it.” - Joyce F. Keller\n\n“Allyn Evans has written the companion traveler for women on this path. In her book, 'Grab the Queen Power, Live Your Best Life!,' she reveals inspiring accounts from her own life as she maps out a cultural trail from girlhood to adulthood. Along the way, she unveils reasons that many girls and women have learned to subjugate their personal power to the needs of others. Interviews with other women are interspersed throughout and underscore her stories. Spell binding and highly personal, the stories captivate, as they may easily belong to me or you, or one our sisters or best friends.” - Kathe Gogolewski\n\nJeffrey M. Fortney is a former U.S. Air Force firefighter and fire service training instructor. He worked for 21 years as a senior technical editor/photographer at Fire Protection Publications in Stillwater, Oklahoma, before retiring in 2023.\n\nK.M. Fortney is a computer specialist with the Edmon Low Library at Oklahoma State University.\n\n“Being a certified Techno-Geek, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I am always interested in stories that emphasize discovery and problem-solving, especially when technology is used to do so, over the pathos and mindless violence which is becoming all too common in SF these days. I grew up reading the \"hard\" SF by authors like Clarke, Asimov, Sheffield and Forward….the story brings to mind the kind of SF I enjoy; people overcoming obstacles to improve their lives and civilizations.” -Thomas J. Davis\n\n“This book is part personal experience, part self-help. The early chapters tell the story of the author's profound losses which isn't an \"easy read\" for those of us who pretend if we're \"good,\" we won't suffer tragedy. I'm glad I kept reading though because those early chapters laid a solid foundation for the unmistakable, Divine transformation of Julie Hunt's life...I highly recommend this book for anyone who has suffered loss, is going into loss or is stuck in the middle of loss. You will relate to Julie's journey while discovering some practical help for finding God's healing.” - Cindy Furubotten\n\nMelvin was born the seventh of eight siblings on a farm in Oklahoma. After leaving the farm at seventeen he utilized his farming and ranching skills to hire into commercial jobs, paying his own way through two college degrees. James' varied work experiences, gained throughout his career, contributed authenticity to the fictional characters and their situations as cleverly described in his writings. Cherished tales of his relatives' experiences during the dramatic eras of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, especially from the perspective of the southern Great Plains, keenly contributed to James’ book.\n\n“'Tares Among the Wheat' is very well-written and researched. The novel covers multiple generations as it tells about many adventures and misadventures while developing the main character’s family linage. It describes many hardships endured, relationships tested, loved ones lost, and portrays the cruelty and ruthlessness of American’s beginnings. It also shows there is kindness and unselfishness among the common man and a willingness to share their meager supplies with the unfortunate…The characters are human with human failings and the bad decisions that come with such traits. They are also endearing, showing the gentle side of the tough and determined men and woman who traveled West. The author leaves us wanting more as it concludes at a cliffhanger in the story and hints of hope …I’ve already ordered Volume two.” - Stephen\n\nA book brought Shannon Myers Kelly and Courtney Lynn Kelly together—and perhaps led to them becoming relatives. Shannon was looking for an artist to illustrate her future children’s book. In a phone call with her brother, Walter, who was going to college in Boston at the time, he suggested Courtney.\n\n“Courtney was living in Stillwater and practicing her art here, but not actually working in the field,” Shannon said. The two worked for a while on the book that would eventually become My Visit to Grandma Judy’s, but put it on the shelf when, as Courtney said, “life happened.” Part of that life happening included Courtney’s marriage to Walter.\"\n\n\"This delightful book is written for parents and grandparents as much as the children. The story is fast-paced, keeping young readers’ attention without taking too much time to read. Bedtime does not have to be a lengthy overblown storytime any more. This new little adventure is packed with fun and is full of the most wonderful entertaining images seen in a story book in years. The black and white illustrations are just like the books we parents grew up with.\" - Darren G. Thompson\n\n“I wanted a good summer read and I found it in Nate Lee's Imposter! I couldn't put it down as I kept wanting to figure out the plot. It kept me interested the entire time. I especially loved the overall message of the book. It has challenged me (in a great way!) to consider how I'm fostering my talents. Overall, loved it! Please write another!” - Alison S\n\n(1949-2016) Sherrill Lewis was a self-taught artist across diverse media. Since her senior year in high school, she has won awards for writing, art dolls, beadwork, crazy quilts, and photography. In 2010, her first technique-oriented book, Splendiferous Bead Motifs! was published. In 2014, Uncultured Pearl, her first novel in the Maggie Storm Blue Mystery Series, ultimately to have four installments, was published. Raised in Maine, Lewis moved to Stillwater in 1997 where she resided on an idyllic, never boring, five acres in Payne County, Oklahoma, with her husband Gene. She passed away in 2016.\n\n“I have read many, many ‘cozy’ books over the years but nothing like [Uncultured Pearl], absolutely brilliant. If you like a gentle cozy mystery with a bit of romance, you will love this book. Once you start reading it you will find it hard to put down. Sherrill Lewis’s beautiful description of the town of Baysinger Cove just swallows you up…The book gently guides you through Maggie Storm’s arrival to the town and on to the mystery or I should ‘whodunnit’. By the end I was full of emotion. All I can say is I cannot wait to read the next book.” - Angie B.\n\n“If you are looking for a superb book of stories and remembrances from a Southern Plains woman, look no further. You must have Vera Long's work on your bookshelf. Her writing is for all ages - perfect to share with your family and descendants. She was born in Texas in the year 1924, midway between World War I and World War II; at age ten, her family moved to Oklahoma. 'Vera Long: The Country Poet' captures experiences, perspectives, and emotions of this remarkable woman and others in America's Southern Plains.”\n\n“[The Eternal: Guardian of Light is] an epic masterpiece that catapults the reader through space and time on this memorable journey with Auren, as he takes on Glaxus. His mission is to seek revenge and save the woman he loves, but his story takes many twists and turns where Auren is tested to the limits before he finally meets his fate. A highly imaginative world, delivered with style. I understand this book is currently being developed for the screen, and I will be interested to see what that brings. Bravo!” - Rachel Tetley\n\nCarolyn West Meyer taught music in the Stillwater Public Schools from 1975 to 2004. Besides being an elementary music specialist, Carolyn and her husband Kel wrote and performed educational albums, cassettes, books, and operettas that were published by two national educational companies and distributed nationwide in the 1980s and 1990s. Later, they produced a television show for fifteen years that featured the local Animal Welfare and Humane Society dogs and cats to help them get forever homes quicker. They love to ride road bicycles and travel with their current dog, Beau. Visit Carolyn's author site at carolynwestmeyerbooks.com.\n\n“As a former dog owner I highly recommend this book for all adults to enjoy! Reading this book was like going on an adventure with the funnest family in the world. This book was hard to put down. Kel and Carolyn are adventurous souls, and their stories in this book are incredibly fascinating to experience through reading. They are both stunning story tellers, as she weaves some of his stories throughout the book perfectly throughout her own unfolding tales.” - Melda Crane\n\nAnne Nelson was born in Fort Sill, OK and grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska, and Stillwater, OK. She attended Yale, and began her journalistic career as a war correspondent in Central America. Beyond her award-winning work as a reporter, she has gone on to write several nonfiction/historical books. She also adapted her play, The Guys, into a feature film released in 2002. She teaches at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University. Visit her website anne-nelson.com.\n\n“An incredibly rich period of history - now almost unknown - of the internal opposition to Hitler during the Nazi reign. [In Red Orchestra] Anne Nelson takes us inside this labyrinth and makes it all clear, showing how some people from all walks of life and of all political persuasions were willing to risk everything to make this stand. A must read for people who want to know what it was really like in this dark time.” - W.M. Dunn\n\nSandra Onley, a teacher in the child development lab in the College of Human Sciences at Oklahoma State University, is the author of Halley the Sheepdog. The book includes illustrations instead of photographs, showing Halley’s point of view about her new home and family members. Onley says: “I am an early childhood teacher and I know the importance of reading to every child’s success in life. If a child can read, he can achieve his goals.”\n\n(1933-2017) Pettyjohn attended South Dakota School of Mines from 1952 to 1954and then joined the United States Marine Corps. After Honorable Discharge from the Corps in 1957, he returned to his studies on the G.I. Bill. In 1981 Pettyjohn became Head of the School of Geology at Oklahoma State University. He retired from OSU in 1995, and then wrote two historical fiction books – one novel and one short story collection – based around Marine Corps in the Great War. He passed away in 2017.\n\nBorn and raised in Syracuse New York, Potter moved to Oklahoma when her husband, Dr. Howard Potter, accepted the position of Head of Music at OSU. After the move the couple found that Howard’s mother had Oklahoma roots. Howard’s great grandfather actually lived in Stillwater in a house that pre-dated the music building that Howard works in. Potter says, “My mother-in-law’s diary crystalized things for me in that we all have a history, we all have life stories. We need to remember the moments and save them for our children or for the world!\n\n“Though the dark mystery behind the haunting of Morley Mansion, which occurred in Boston in the early 1900s, is the main thread of [Guilt is a Ghost], the real appeal for me is the pair of detectives on the case. Imagine Holmes and Watson investigating a murder mystery that’s wound up with Dr. Watson’s shameful past. Okay, maybe that’s too hard to imagine. But it works with the ghost-hunting, murder-solving Vera Van Slyke and her assistant, Lucille Parsell! Or should I say -- the woman going by the name of “Lucille Parsell”? (That’s not really a spoiler.) A quirky lead detective, a fun adventure, and a touching tale of a daughter coming to terms with her far-from-perfect mother.” - L.K. Koontz\n\nJeremy was raised in Stillwater, OK by a single mother and graduated from SHS. He then graduated from the US Air Force Academy and served as a Sortie Generation Officer and a Special Agent (Captain) in the USAF Office of Special Investigations (OSI) and was assigned to AFSOC (Air Force Special Operations Command). While in OSI, Jeremy was recruited by the FBI. He served in the FBI for 23 years as a Special Agent and spent 21 of those years as a SWAT operator, assault team leader, lead medic, senior firearms instructor, and sniper team leader. After completing 32 years of federal service, Jeremy still actively competes in several shooting sports and provides firearms training to police and armed citizens.\n\nJeremy has served in medical mission trips in Mexico, Ghana, Uganda, Togo, Ecuador, Haiti, and Nicaragua. Providing free medical care to others seems like a natural act as a follower of Jesus. He volunteers at his church, local shelters, food banks, and serves in a lay-counselor ministry.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page.\n\n\"This is a work of art with accurate and exhilarating details of a monumental challenge of the greatest test…making a sniper shot on game day. J Money’s account gives insight into the arduous conditions and perils of snipers and operators in a dangerous environment. Thank God for giving him wisdom and thanks to him for all of the training and commitment to prepare him for that day on Glass Mountain. I look forward to the rest of the book!\" - Doug F.\n\n\"Using a sharp historical lens, Peter Rollins examines American cultural history--focusing on myriad characters: Will Rogers, Benjamin Lee Whorf, Harriet Beecher Stowe, John James Audubon, and four major wars while explaining how language, satire, and motion pictures mirror the American psyche. Weaving in and out of personal reminiscences and historical interpretations, America Reflected offers especially strong insight into the nation's changing mores during a turbulent period that began with the rudimentary Model-A automobile and ended with high-altitude B-52 bombing attacks. Clearly, this innovative book--written by an experienced author, lecturer, critic, and editor--belongs in every library and research institution.” - Jo-Ann Dorio-Fyne\n\n“'Flying Hugs and Kisses' is a touching book written to help children understand more about SIDS. It offers a wonderfully creative way of coping for family members who are affected by SIDS. Jewel Sample does a very good job of assisting parents (or other family members) in explaining things at a child's level. I would have to imagine that there are many families that have been affected by SIDS sending the \"flying hugs and kisses\" described in the story to their lost loved ones after reading this book. Well done.” - N. Rehm\n\n“The true story of a hero far more interesting and heroic than any movie hero. And, as always, Fred Staff remains true to his training as an historian, while telling a tale of outlaws, cowboys, US Marshals and other familiar old west characters. In this case, the US Marshal is a former slave who just happens the toughest and most honest man of his times. [Young Bass Reeves] is a book that will hold your attention, from start to finish.” - Dennis Dorgan\n\nAbhi Sukhdial, a student at Stillwater High School (Class of 2026), is an Oklahoma NextGen Under 30 honoree in the Arts, a National winner of the PTA Reflections Arts-in-Education program, and the sole Oklahoma recipient of the 2022 Promising Young Writer Award bestowed by the National Council of Teachers of English.

It appeals to the sense of the dire consequences of ignoring climate change and what the future could hold for all civilization. The sense of urgency prevails throughout the novella, which can be easily described as a \"page-turner.\" The writer has carefully woven the sequence of events, going from the present to the past and back to the present in a carefully crafted manner. Undoubtedly, the reader remains engaged until the very end. This young writer shows great promise in being able to create a credible story with such precision and realistic characters. I highly recommend this novella to readers of all ages who like suspense, who like reading works that are relevant and thought-provoking, and who are concerned about issues that affect all of our world, especially the looming dangers of climate control. I can honestly say this novella has left a lasting impression upon me, and I hope it will do the same for many people of all ages! I look forward to reading more works by this incredible young author. And hopefully seeing this novella adapted into a screenplay. It would capture quite an audience! - Nancy J. Allford\n\nDavid Eric Tomlinson was born and raised in Stillwater, Oklahoma, educated in California, and now lives in Texas.

Check out his website daviderictomlinson.com.\n\n\"Tomlinson has nice timing, and a good handle on voice. The Dallas author is an Okie, born and raised, and you can really hear his characters. And the characters are nicely fleshed out, too — real human beings with flaws that never lapse into cartoon two-dimensionality. It's a book about hope, which comes at a good time. After last year's polarizing election, it feels good to see through the eyes of his creations — people who are really interested in understanding one another's lives as opposed to just shouting over them.\" - The Dallas Morning News\n\n“Beautifully written—sensuous, compelling, honest, and thought-provoking. As a guitar god of the 1960s, Gordon Hammond’s story is about fame and fortune and the high price that they exact. Too often we’re tempted to believe that the life of a superstar is one of luxury and ease, but The Beyond the Bridge series is a window into their reality, which is more often than not, a completely different reality than the one that is presented to the public. Waller does an excellent job of drawing the reader into their private, most intimate moments with the sensitivity and knowledge of one who has been on the inside of the fascinating world known as “Rock n’ Roll”. Highly recommended for anyone who loves music or anyone who simply loves a good character-driven story.” - K. Lynette Erwin\n\n“This book is an excellent reference for anyone interested in the Civil War in I.T. or in Native American history in general. It is comprehensive, and includes the history of the waging of war and the effect of war for both the \"Civilized Tribes\" and the Plains Indians. I am not literate enough to speak to its accuracy concerning the western tribes, but can attest to the book's accuracy concerning the war in the Cherokee Nation. The book concludes by examining the after effects of the war on shaping U.S. policy toward Native Americans. It is evenhanded in its treatment of both the Federal and Confederate sides of the conflict, and restrained -- beyond illustrating its effects with letters, facts, and oral histories -- in its comments on the clear immorality of post-war U.S. Indian policy.”- Margaret S. Verble"
