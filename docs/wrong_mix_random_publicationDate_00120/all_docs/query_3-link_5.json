        "text": "‎The East Coast Outside Sales Manager at Vendini values authenticity in people and music. A musician herself, she is a big James Taylor fan and has seen him in concert dozens of times. She also loves to travel to a country that evokes memories of her childhood, parents and a simpler life. Here, she reflects on her greatest loves, the best live event she’s ever seen, her favorite venues and how INTIX has changed her life.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWho do you admire most and why?\n\nTop of my list: my dad. He was the most patient human being I’ve ever known. I loved him and his cadence in life. Currently, I am in awe of the powerful stance by Emma Gonzalez and the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Parkland.\n\nWhat is the quality you like most in a person?\n\nAuthenticity.\n\nWhat is the quality you most like in a colleague?\n\nIn addition to authenticity, I would also say passion and honesty.\n\nWhat qualities are important to you in a leader?\n\nSomeone who is a great coach. I think it’s really important to have a coach who challenges your thinking, thinks outside the box, offers a fresh set of eyes and a new perspective. Someone who knows when I should be on the bench and when I should start.\n\nWhat or who is the greatest love of your life?\n\nThere are two. My music and my ex-wife. I never thought I would say that so easily a couple of years ago, but today I say that with absolute authenticity. As for music, I started playing piano when I was six and I was already playing by ear. I didn’t read music until I got to Berklee College of Music and it was force-fed. I started playing drums shortly after piano, and that’s what I pursued at Berklee.\n\nWhich talent would you most like to have?\n\nI would love to be a better guitar player and rip into a good Eric Clapton guitar solo.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest achievement?\n\nI was somewhat of an absentee daughter, the epitome of sowing my wild oats. But, I had a significant life change in my early 30s. After being physically (and emotionally) MIA for so many years, I was able to be present and available for my folks and get to know them well again before they passed, to show them that I’m okay.\n\nWhere would you most like to live?\n\nI love Boston, but in a fantasy world, I would love to live in Bermuda all the time.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\n\nRight now, I would have to say a lot of the artwork and personal things that belonged to my folks. I am lucky enough to have my dad’s watch. Things like this mean a great deal to me today.\n\nWhat do you value most in your friends?\n\nLoyalty.\n\nWho are your favorite writers?\n\nJohn Steinbeck and Spalding Grey.\n\nWhat’s the best live event you’ve ever seen and why?\n\nJames Taylor in 2016 at Tanglewood. It was my 38th or 39th time seeing him, and I was two rows from the stage. By the second half of the show, I was leaning on the stage. I looked away for a moment during “How Sweet It Is” and when I turned back, a background singer was handing me a mic to sing along. James Taylor inspired me to pursue music. He has such great humility, humanity and presence on stage.\n\nWhat is your favorite venue and why?\n\nTanglewood is literally in James Taylor’s backyard and has become one of my favourite venues. I also really like Jones Beach, which is very similar in size.\n\nWho is your favorite musician of all time and why?\n\nJames Taylor. He has been an inspiration to me for many reasons. His words and journey resonate with me. I think he is an amazing writer, incredible lyricist and storyteller, and he gathers some of the most incredible musicians who just make magic and who can play any variety of styles. You’ll hear rock n’ roll to a Bossa nova.\n\nWhat is your favorite place to visit or place you’d love to visit and why?\n\nI go back to Bermuda every year. My folks used to take us there, so we were exposed to it very early on. It’s a beautiful, very simple island. The people are magnificent. I go every year around my folks’ anniversary to honor that part of my life, even if it’s only for a long weekend. It’s close, it’s beautiful and it feels like home.\n\nIf you could go back in time, what advice would you give yourself?\n\nDon’t pursue immediate gratification over your long-term goal. Don’t get distracted by a shiny thing when you have a vision ahead of you. Keep true to the path.\n\nWhat do you like to do in your spare time?\n\nI love the gym. If I’m not working, playing music or watching politics on MSNBC, I want to be at the gym.\n\nIf you were granted three wishes today, what would they be?\n\nMy first would be more time with my folks and my family. If I am being 100 percent honest, I would also wish for financial security — to be able to have extra wiggle room at all times, pay off the house and have some play money. My third would be to do more for those who can’t. I try to do service or volunteer work on a regular basis but do that more often and more frequently would be pretty cool.\n\nWhy are you a member of INTIX?\n\nINTIX is an amazing community of subject matter experts. I’ve been in ticketing now for just over a year. I’ve done a lot of sales and technology, but nothing ticketing specific. I was amazed at the number of subject matter experts. It’s a really unique group of folks who know their business better than anyone.\n\nWhat do you get from INTIX?\n\nI get thought leadership, amazing new friends and new connections. I really was so amazed at how many people I met this past year and how many I’ve stayed in contact with to this day.\n\nWhat does INTIX give you that is different from everything else you are doing?\n\nIt’s the people. It’s industry leaders, regardless of the roles they hold. You have an opportunity to tap into them and it’s just an amazing collection of people. I’ve been sent to a handful of conferences and INTIX is unlike any other. It’s the people who make all the difference.\n\nWhat do you love most about your job?\n\nMy team and my colleagues at Vendini. It’s seriously the best team — from execs to marketing to support to sales.\n\nWho or what inspires you?\n\nMy boss might think I’m sucking up, but it’s our team here. We really work well together.\n\nWhat do you love most about our industry?\n\nWhat we do. I think we are providing an entry point to giving the average bear a break. It’s tough out there, life gets hard, and I think everybody deserves that reprieve. We allow them to go in, laugh and tap their toes. Our industry is the gateway, so we can get as many people to as many different experiences as possible, whether it’s music, dance, comedy or theatre. It’s that break from the heavy in the world that everybody lives with.\n\nWhat is your most memorable INTIX moment?"
