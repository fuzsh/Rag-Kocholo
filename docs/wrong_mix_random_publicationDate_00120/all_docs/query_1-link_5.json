        "text": "A couple of months ago, I went back to work after maternity leave. I had picked the return date at random when I was pregnant. It wasn’t quite a year and that made it a bit less scary to someone who previously couldn’t imagine leaving the workforce for that period of time. I’d smile politely when people questioned why it was less than a year, or said that I wouldn’t care about my job once my baby was born (I did still care, btw). In the weeks leading up to returning people often asked me in hushed tones how I felt about going back to work, like they were sure they would upset me by reminding me that it was coming up. I’d reply that I felt fine about it, and for the most part I did. It felt a bit surreal, but after months of swaddling and shushing, feeding and changing, it was almost a welcome break. I’ll admit that at times I am in a meeting and ‘I like to eat eapples and benaynays’ plays over in my head, or I stand and chat to a colleague and sway like I still have a baby in my arms. I’m still finding my feet, on what feels like constantly shifting sand, and working out my value as a worker and a leader who is also a mum. There are a couple of things I do know - it is as important as I thought it would be to me that my son have a working mum. That he understand that she exists as a whole person outside of him being his mum. That she have a way to be financially independent. That he see women outside of the home achieving their goals. And let’s be honest, I’m still trying to figure out what I want to do when I grow up and working that out makes me a better mum in the process. But even if it didn’t, it would be ok to do this just for me. It’s also as important that he sees his dad in the home, caring for him. Part of the reason some stress has been taken out of returning to work is because my husband has stepped in and taken leave from his work to be the primary care giver. It’s made me even more passionate about all the financial and structural obstacles we need removed so that dads can have an opportunity to care for their kids too. We have taken a financial hit that not all families have the privilege of making. We know that gendered violence occurs on a spectrum that starts with gender inequality, so we need investment into policies which address inequality on all levels. More parental leave and incentives for men and women to both take the leave are tangible ways we can help dads take on equal childcare and allow for cultural change around care-giving being a woman’s responsibility. I used to think transitioning back into the workplace after a baby was one transition. In reality, that transition happens everyday and some days it’s smoother than others. It’s wild the way we still expect women to return to work like they never had children. So, here’s to all the mums I see constantly making it all look effortless - I see you and I think you are truly amazing. #parernityleave #maternityleave #equality #gender #leadership #change"
