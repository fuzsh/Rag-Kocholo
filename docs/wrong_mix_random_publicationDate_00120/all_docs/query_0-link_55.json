        "text": "Welcome to the National Directory of Home Modification and Repair Resources!\n\nThis Directory provides home modification and repair resources (such as featured programs, funding, service providers, and consumer materials) for each state! Before jumping to a State Resource Page, skill up on the basics below! Then, continue on to the State Resource Pages by doing a state search below the map. We hope you find this information useful! Let us know if you have any questions or additions at homemods@usc.edu.\n\nThe National Directory of Home Modification and Repair Resources lists programs and businesses from across the United States. The USC Fall Prevention Center of Excellence has conducted several nationwide surveys to inform the Directory entries. It also accepts requests from organizations requests to be added to the Directory. Programs are only added if they fit within the scope of the Directory. USC does not endorse nor qualify any of the programs. This Directory is for informational purposes only and individuals must use their own caution and judgment when using these resources.\n\nThis project was supported, in part, by grant number 90PPHM0001 from the U.S. Administration for Community Living, Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, D.C. 20201. Grantees undertaking projects with government sponsorship are encouraged to express freely their findings and conclusions. Points of view or opinions do not, therefore, necessarily represent official ACL policy.\n\nInformation that the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology publishes on the World Wide Web may contain references or cross references to other agencies, products, programs, or links. USC does not endorse nor qualify any of the products, programs or links. The listing of these products, programs, and services is for informational purposes and individuals must use their own caution and judgment when using these resources. USC does not hold any liability or personal interest in any of these agencies, products, or services."
