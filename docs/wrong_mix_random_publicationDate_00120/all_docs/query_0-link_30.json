        "text": "Wed, 07/10/2024\n\nauthor\n\nChristy Little Schock\n\nShare\n\nLAWRENCE — More than 7,400 undergraduate students at the University of Kansas earned honor roll distinction for the spring 2024 semester.\n\nThe honor roll comprises undergraduates who meet requirements in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences and in the schools of Architecture & Design, Business, Education & Human Sciences, Engineering, Health Professions, Journalism & Mass Communications, Music, Nursing, Pharmacy, Professional Studies and Social Welfare.\n\nHonor roll criteria vary among the university’s academic units. Some schools honor the top 10% of students enrolled, some establish a minimum grade-point average, and others raise the minimum GPA for each year students are in school. Students must complete a minimum number of credit hours to be considered for the honor roll.\n\nSpring 2024 honorees are listed below and include students whose honor roll status was conferred before June 30. Students who believe their names were mistakenly omitted should directly contact their academic advisers. Not all students opt to have their names published.
