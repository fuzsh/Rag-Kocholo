        "text": "Centre County residents now have more local options for dressing their salads or marinating their pulled pork, thanks to products created and marketed by Bald Eagle Area High School agriculture students. After the successful launch of Hometown Honey Vinaigrette in October 2022, the students are preparing to release their second dressing, Mountain Maple Vinaigrette, to local markets this fall.\n\nBEA’s venture into the salad dressing business occurred after agriculture students created a honey-based dressing to accompany their hydroponically grown lettuce at a luncheon for local business leaders.\n\n“When people responded positively to the dressing, I wanted to see if we could create a marketable product that would also meet educational needs,” says agriculture teacher/FFA advisor Todd Biddle.\n\nClay and Melanie Phillips, proprietors of Village Eatinghouse Handcrafted Sauces in Karthaus, agreed to serve as mentors to the students, who Biddle assigned to research, production, marketing, and finance teams. The honey for the dressing was produced in student Michael Lewis’s apiary, and Susquehanna Mills was chosen as a local source for reasonably-priced oils. BEA faculty, staff, and students participated in taste tests, and the production team adjusted ingredient amounts in response to their feedback. The team then traveled to Village Eatinghouse to bottle the dressing according to Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture standards.\n\nThe Phillipses have been willing coaches for the students. “When asked to mentor this group of surprisingly mature and focused students from BEA, we had no expectations — but they blew us away with their thoroughness and their curiosity about the ins and outs of the specialty food industry,” they said in a written statement.\n\nMountain Maple Vinaigrette, BEA’s newest dressing, will feature locally produced Fetterolf Family Maple Syrup. BEA junior Adra Spotts played a key role in developing the recipe.\n\n“I started with research and developed two batches,” Spotts says. “Based on feedback from taste tests, we adjusted the amount of maple syrup to add more sweetness and added more Dijon mustard to balance it before testing the pH at Village Eatinghouse.” Spotts says that the pH of the product must not exceed 3.5 for shelf stability.\n\nArt teacher Dr. Renee Kredell has overseen the branding of both products. Her Art III students created the product name and label design for Hometown Honey Vinaigrette, featuring an eagle soaring over a valley, along with a beehive and honeycomb to represent the starring ingredient. After student groups combined six concepts into a final design, now former student Ethan Koleno completed the final rendering of the label.\n\n“For Maple Mountain Vinaigrette, we became more focused on defining how to create a brand and what it means visually,” Kredell says. “We focused on what ‘Hometown’ meant on the original label, so the eagle and valley design needed to be on the new bottle. We added the tapped maple tree and maple leaves and changed the checkerboard to fall colors.” Kredell has also helped the students to enhance their marketing efforts with a trifold brochure and a larger display board.\n\nBiddle hopes to continue working with his students to develop new products. “I want this to be a motivator for any student with the interest and desire to make a product,” he says. “If it meets Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture guidelines, we’ll continue to make new products. We may even do specialty products, such as barbecue sauce.” In fact, the students have already tested a plum barbecue sauce for possible release in the fall. Proceeds from dressing sales will help pay for competitions for the district’s FFA chapter.\n\nThe enterprise has benefited individual students as well. Freshman Owen Dechow, who has been responsible for the financial aspects of developing and marketing the products, appreciates the real-world experiences that he has gained. “I like the community outreach and public speaking,” he says. “It’s more extemporaneous. I can speak on the fly whenever I need to.”\n\nAdra Spotts has been so inspired by her experiences in food production that she has decided to make a career of it. “Because of the salad dressing project, I am going to attend Penn State for a degree in food science,” she says.\n\nHometown Honey Vinaigrette is currently available for purchase online at centremarkets.com and at A Basketful in Boalsburg, Ace Hardware in Milesburg and Martin’s Feed Mill in Coburn. Production of the product will pause, at least temporarily, when the team focuses on bringing Mountaintop Maple to shelves in October.\n\nBarbara Young is the gifted support teacher at Bald Eagle Area School District."
