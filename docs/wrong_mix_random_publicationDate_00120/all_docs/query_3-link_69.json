        "text": "Kelly Ann McGillis (born July 9, 1957) is an American actress. She is known for her film roles such as Rachel Lapp in Witness (1985), for which she received Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations; Charlie in Top Gun (1986); Made in Heaven (1987); The House on Carroll Street (1988); and as Katheryn Murphy in The Accused (1988). In her later career, she has starred in horror films such as Stake Land (2010), The Innkeepers (2011), and We Are What We Are (2013).\n\nEarly life\n\nMcGillis was born on July 9, 1957, in the southern California suburb of Newport Beach, the eldest of three daughters born to Virginia Joan (n√©e Snell), a homemaker, and Donald Manson McGillis, a physician. Her paternal ancestry is Scots-Irish, and her maternal ancestry is German; she also has Welsh ancestry. She attended Newport Harbor High School.\n\nMcGillis was raised in Los Angeles, and attended the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts at Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria, California. After getting her GED after dropping out of high school in 1975, she moved to New York City to study acting at the Juilliard School, where she graduated in 1983, Group 12.\n\nCareer\n\nFilm\n\nAfter making her film debut in Reuben, Reuben in 1983, McGillis's breakout role was that of an Amish mother in Witness (1985) for which she received Golden Globe and BAFTA award nominations. Her next high-profile role was that of flight instructor Charlotte Blackwood (call sign \"Charlie\") in the 1986 fighter-pilot film Top Gun starring Tom Cruise.\n\nIn 1987, McGillis acted in the romance film Made in Heaven, directed by Alan Rudolph, which was produced by Lorimar Productions.\n\nMcGillis played the part of caretaker for Miss Venable (Jessica Tandy) in 1988's The House on Carroll Street, which also starred Jeff Daniels. She overhears a suspicious conversation in the house next door and suspects that she's stumbled on a conspiracy to smuggle Nazi war criminals into the United States.\n\nAfter 1988's The Accused, she appeared in Cat Chaser with Peter Weller, a film she despised and which discouraged her from pursuing an acting career. McGillis appeared in dozens of television and film roles throughout the 1990s before taking a break from acting for a few years.\n\nMcGillis played the part of Babe Ruth's second wife, Claire Merritt Ruth, in The Babe (1992). From the late-1980s to the mid-1990s, McGillis appeared in Winter People (1989), and North (1994), her second Amish part in television or film, as well as several made-for-TV films.\n\nIn 1999, McGillis co-starred with Val Kilmer (who plays Virgil, a blind man), for a second time as his over protective sister in At First Sight.\n\nShe played the suspect in the disappearance of a young woman in The Monkey's Mask, an international lesbian cult film from 2000 starring Susie Porter. The film is based on the verse novel of the same name by Australian poet Dorothy Porter.\n\nTelevision\n\nMcGillis's early television roles included a part on the daytime soap One Life to Live in 1984.\n\nShe starred in the 1984 television movie Sweet Revenge (also known as Bittersweet Revenge) with Alec Baldwin.\n\nOther television films during the 1980s included Private Sessions in 1985, and as a narrator in Santabear's First Christmas. She also narrated the documentary Out of Ireland for PBS in 1995.\n\nStage\n\nWhile at Juilliard she performed in William Congreve's Love for Love, directed by John Bletchley. She appeared in a couple of off-broadway and Broadway theater productions during the 1980s in New York City.\n\nDuring the late-1980s and through the mid-2000s, McGillis was a featured actress at the prestigious Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington DC. In 2002, she appeared in production of John Webber's play \"The Duchess of Malfi\" at the Shakespeare Theatre, Washington, DC.\n\nIn 2004, she appeared in the stage play The Graduate as Mrs. Robinson, touring the United States. McGillis starred in a Pasadena Playhouse stage production of The Little Foxes by Lillian Hellman in May 2009, co-starring with Julia Duffy.\n\nHer stage work includes: Don Juan (1982), The Sea Gull (1985), Peccadillo (1985), The Merchant of Venice (1988), Twelfth Night (1989), Mary Stuart (1990), The Merry Wives of Windsor (1990), Hedda Gabler (1994), Mourning Becomes Electra (1997), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999), Measure for Measure (1999) and The Graduate (2004), together with additional roles in Love for Love, Six Characters in Search of an Author, Three Sisters and The Winter's Tale.\n\nShe also appeared in a production of Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune by Terrence McNally, which toured the United Kingdom in 2010.\n\nReturn to film and TV\n\nShe began working in television again in 2006, then in 2007 joined the cast of Showtime's The L Word for its fifth season.\n\nShe had a role in the 2010 vampire film Stake Land, directed by Jim Mickle, starring alongside Nick Damici, Connor Paolo and Danielle Harris.\n\nMcGillis was featured in a breast cancer docu-drama titled 1 a Minute, released in 2010.\n\nShe starred in Ti West's 2011 thriller The Innkeepers, We Are What We Are and Tio Papi in 2013, Grand Street, Love Finds You in Sugarcreek, Ohio (which was McGillis's third Amish-themed film), Z Nation, and an episode of Sisters of Mercy in 2014, and Blue in 2015.\n\nAn Uncommon Grace on Hallmark Channel was McGillis's fourth Amish themed film and she had the lead role in Mother of All Secrets in 2017 as Rose Lewis.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMcGillis married fellow Juilliard student Boyd Black in 1979; the couple divorced in 1981. In the mid-1980s, she dated actors Warren Beatty and Jodie Foster. She married Fred Tillman in 1989, and they have two daughters. The couple divorced in 2002.\n\nThe Centurion, a 110-foot schooner valued at $1.5 million owned by McGillis and her then-husband, Fred Tillman, was destroyed by fire in April 1996 at a marina in Dania, Florida. The fire started on an adjacent boat at the Port LauDania marina on a Dania Cutoff Canal and spread to the schooner. Tillman had brought the boat from the couple's home in Key West in hopes of selling it at the Fort Lauderdale Boat Show.\n\nMcGillis came out as a lesbian in 2009 during an interview with SheWired. In 2010, she entered into a civil union with Melanie Leis, a Philadelphia sales executive. They had met in 2000 when Leis was a bartender at the Caribbean Bar Grill & Brewery in Key West, Florida, which McGillis owned with her then-husband.\n\n.....\n\nMcGillis currently lives in Hendersonville, North Carolina. As of 2013, she has taught acting at the New York Studio for Stage and Screen (NYS3) in Asheville, North Carolina.\n\n2016 home invasion\n\nMcGillis was left scratched and bruised after being assaulted by a woman who broke into her North Carolina home on June 17, 2016. She said the attack, as well as others she has experienced in the past, led her to apply for a concealed carry gun permit to protect herself. Following the incident, a 38-year-old woman, Laurence Marie Dorn, was charged with second-degree burglary, misdemeanor larceny, misdemeanor stalking, assault and battery, and interfering with emergency communication. Dorn was later convicted of misdemeanor breaking and entering and sentenced to probation.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1983 Reuben, Reuben Geneva Spofford 1985 Witness Rachel Lapp 1986 Top Gun Charlotte 'Charlie' Blackwood 1987 Made in Heaven Annie Packert / Ally Chandler Unsettled Land Anda Santabear's High Flying Adventure Missy Bear (voice) Short 1988 The House on Carroll Street Emily Crane The Accused Assistant District Attorney Kathryn Murphy 1989 Winter People Collie Wright Cat Chaser Mary DeBoya Rabbit Ears: Thumbelina Narrator Video short 1991 Grand Isle Edna Pontellier 1992 Weather Is Good on Deribasovskaya, It Rains Again on Brighton Beach Marriott Manager The Babe Claire Merritt Ruth Rabbit Ears: Noah and the Ark Narrator Video short 1994 North Amish Mother 1998 Painted Angels Nettie Ground Control Susan Stratton 1999 At First Sight Jennie Adamson Settlement, The Fake Barbara / Ellie 2000 The Monkey's Mask Professor Diana Maitland 2001 No One Can Hear You Trish Burchall Morgan's Ferry Vonnie Carpenter Direct-To-Video 2007 Girl 27 Herself Documentary\n\nArchival footage\n\nSpecial Thanks Supergator Kim Taft 2010 Stake Land Sister 1 a Minute Herself\n\nNarrator (Voice) Documentary 2011 The Innkeepers Leanne Rease-Jones What Could Have Been Margaret 2013 We Are What We Are Marge Tio Papi Elizabeth Warden 2014 Grand Street Isabelle 2015 Blue Ms. Hutcherson 2021 Val Herself Documentary\n\nArchival footage\n\nArchival pictures 2022 Top Gun: Maverick Charlotte 'Charlie' Blackwood Archival footage from the 1986 film Top Gun\n\nUncredited\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1984 Sweet Revenge Katherine Dennison Breen TV film One Life to Live Glenda Livingston Unknown episodes 1985 Private Sessions Jennifer Coles TV film 1986 Santabear's First Christmas Narrator (voice) TV film 1992 Perry Mason: The Case of the Fatal Framing Mrs. Joel McKelvey TV film\n\nUncredited 1993 Bonds of Love Rose Parks TV film 1994 In the Best of Families: Marriage, Pride & Madness Susie Lynch TV film 1995 Dark Eyes Mila McGann Unsold TV pilot Remember Me Menly Nichols TV film Out of Ireland Narrator, Documentary Film PBS TV film 1996 We the Jury Alyce Bell TV film 1997 The Third Twin Dr. Jean 'Jeannie' Ferrami TV film 1998 Storm Chasers: Revenge of the Twister Jamie Marshall TV film Perfect Prey Audrey Macleah TV film 2000 The Wild Thornberrys Winema (voice) Episodes: \"Pack of Thornberrys\" The Outer Limits Nicole Whitley Episodes: \"Final Appeal: Parts 1 & 2\" Buzz Lightyear of Star Command Gorgeous Woman (voice) Episode: \"Planet of the Lost\" 2003 Journey To Planet Earth Narrator (voice) Documentary TV series\n\nEpisode 2: \"Land Of Plenty, Land Of Want\"\n\nEpisode 4: \"Rivers Of Destiny\"\n\nEpisode 6: \"The Urban Explosion\" 2006 Black Widower Nancy Westveld TV film 2008 The L Word Colonel Gillian Davis Episodes: \"Lesbians Gone Wild\", \"Lay Down the Law\" 2014 Love Finds You in Sugarcreek, Ohio Bertha Troyler TV film Z Nation Helen Episode: \"Sisters of Mercy\" 2017 An Uncommon Grace Elizabeth Conner Hallmark Channel TV film 2018 Maternal Secrets Rose Lewis TV film 2020 Dirty John Miriam Saslaw Season 2: \"The Betty Broderick Story\", Episode No. 5 (No. 13 overall): \"Scream Therapy\" (Uncredited)\n\nMusic Videos\n\nYear Title Artist Role Notes 1986 Danger Zone Kenny Loggins Charlotte 'Charlie' Blackwood Archival footage from the 1986 film Top Gun Take My Breath Away Berlin Charlotte 'Charlie' Blackwood Archival footage from the 1986 film Top Gun\n\nProducer\n\nYear Title Notes 1991 Grand Isle\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nYear Association Category Nominated work Result 1986 Golden Globe Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture Witness Nominated BAFTA Award Best Actress Witness Nominated Bravo Otto Best Actress Top Gun Won 1987 Bravo Otto Best Actress Made in Heaven Won Golden Ciak Best Actress Made in Heaven Won 1988 Bravo Otto Best Actress The Accused Bronze 2018 California Women‚Äôs Film Festival Best Supporting Actress Maternal Secrets Won Southampton International Film Festival Supporting Actress in a Feature Maternal Secrets Nominated\n\nSee also"
