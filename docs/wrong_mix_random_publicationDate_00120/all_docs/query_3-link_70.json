Following the incident, a 38-year-old woman, Laurence Marie Dorn, was charged with second-degree burglary, misdemeanor larceny, misdemeanor stalking, assault and battery, and interfering with emergency communication.[43] Dorn was later convicted of misdemeanor breaking and entering.[44]\n\nFilmography[]\n\nMain article: Kelly McGillis filmography\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nLua error in Module:Sister_project_links at line 367: attempt to index field 'wikibase' (a nil value)."
