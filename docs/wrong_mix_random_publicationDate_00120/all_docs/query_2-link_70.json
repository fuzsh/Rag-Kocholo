        "text": "Abstract Background The Cost of Living Crisis (CoLC), a real term reduction in basic income, risks individuals being unable to afford essentials such as heat, food and clothing. The impact of the CoLC is disproportionate â with different population sub-groups more likely to be negatively affected. The objective of this survey was to evaluate the perceived impact of the CoLC on the life and health of participants across four European countries. Methods A survey housing two questions to investigate the relationship between the CoLC and its perceived impact on life and health was developed. Four European countries (U.K., Sweden, Italy and Germany) took part via the YouGov platform. Logistic regression models were created for each country and question to evaluate which population characteristics were associated with a negative reported impact of the CoLC. Results A total of 8,152 unique individuals responded between 17th March and 30th March 2023. Each country was equally represented. Those aged 36â64 were more likely to report a negative impact of the CoLC on their life and health than younger participants (pâ<â0.001, pâ=â0.02 respectively). Across all countries, females were significantly more likely to report a negative impact on their life and health, however, when analysed according to country, in Sweden females were less likely to report a negative impact (pâ<â0.001). Those in lower income families or who reported poor health in the preceding 12 months were significantly more likely to report a negative impact of the CoLC on their life and health. There was no difference within the participant group on the reported impact of the CoLC based on location (rural vs. urban). Conclusions We demonstrate the disproportionate negative impact of the CoLC on both life and health in different population subgroups. Germany and Sweden appeared to be more resilient to the effects of the CoLC, particularly for certain population subgroups. It is important to understand the differing effects of a CoLC, and to learn from successful health and economic strategies in order to create targeted policy and create a population resilient to economic shocks."
