        "text": "MISSISSIPPI LEGISLATURE\n\n2024 Regular Session\n\nTo: Rules\n\nBy: Senator(s) Wiggins, England, Simmons (12th), Berry, Boyd, DeBar, Frazier, Hopson, McCaughn, McLendon, Michel, Norwood, Seymour, Sparks, Suber, Thompson\n\nSenate Concurrent Resolution 518\n\n(As Adopted by Senate and House)\n\nA CONCURRENT RESOLUTION MOURNING THE LOSS AND CELEBRATING THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND CAREER OF MISSISSIPPI MUSIC ICON AND TROPICAL ROCK LEGEND AND USM ALUMNUS JIMMY BUFFETT OF PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI, WHO CREATED HIS OWN GENRE OF MUSIC AND A WORLDWIDE MUSIC BUSINESS EMPIRE, AND EXPRESSING THE SYMPATHY OF THE LEGISLATURE ON THE PASSING OF THIS MISSISSIPPI MUSIC LEGEND.\n\nWHEREAS, Jimmy Buffett, the iconic Mississippi musician and celebrated music industry mogul, whose laid-back vibe built a music empire, passed away on September 1, 2023, at age 76; and\n\nWHEREAS, Buffett enjoyed a 50-plus year recording career that generated unparalleled devotion from fans, famously known as \"Parrotheads.\" Buffett was actually an astute, ambitious, aggressive businessman. His development of branded restaurants, books, beer, resorts, a Broadway show and a cruise line established Buffett a bona fide mogul; and\n\nWHEREAS, \"Wastin' away in Margaritaville,\" was the chorus of his most famous song, which became an international singalong. Buffett built an empire based largely on what is now known as \"Gulf and Western\" or \"Tropical Rock\" music that celebrated the Gulf of Mexico life, sunshine and nightlife. He memorialized his home state with songs like \"Pascagoula Run\" and \"Biloxi\"; and\n\nWHEREAS, Buffett was born on Christmas Day, 1946, in Pascagoula, Mississippi, where family and friends continue to live. He once said he arrived in the Florida Keys driving a 1946 Packard in about 1970 and found his musical niche during that decade with breezy, island-influenced party tunes. He became a pop star in 1977, when \"Margaritaville\" cracked the Top 10. The song has provided a soundtrack to countless happy hours in the decades since; and\n\nWHEREAS, Buffett's 1992 collection titled Boats, Beaches, Bars, and Ballads became one of the best-selling box sets ever and his annual summer concert tours with his Coral Reefer Band became major events, drawing thousands of \"Parrotheads\" who would dress up in Hawaiian shirts, leis, funny hats and other mellow party accessories. Some would follow Buffet's tour from city to city; and\n\nWHEREAS, business success soon eclipsed record sales. According to Buffett's website, the first Margaritaville restaurant opened in Key West, Florida, in 1987. The chain grew to 16 outlets and Harrah's Entertainment, Inc., teamed up with Buffett to develop the $700 million Margaritaville Casino & Resort in Biloxi, Mississippi, near where he was raised. Regardless of his commercial achievements, Buffett's legacy will be, in his words, \"helping people forget their troubles for a couple of hours.\" The singer told the Baltimore Sun in 1999 that his optimistic view of life brought fans to the humor and escapism in his work. And that was OK, because there already was enough serious material in the world. \"I was the life of the party,\" Buffett said; and\n\nWHEREAS, evidencing his all-around great business acumen, he became involved in such products as Landshark Lager, the Margaritaville and Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurant chains, boat shoes, salsa, hummus, tortillas, dips, tequila and blenders; and\n\nWHEREAS, Buffett was chairman of Margaritaville Holdings based in Palm Beach, Florida. He had a restaurant and a casino in Vegas, a casino in Mississippi and a hotel in Pensacola Beach, Florida; and\n\nWHEREAS, along with hit songs, Buffett wrote best-selling novels. In 2008 he was ranked by Vanity Fair as No. 97 on a list of the 100 most influential people in the world, and his fan base was broad and loyal. Even when he was in his 60s, his concert tickets fetched more than $100.00. \"I'm not about to apologize for being a good businessman,\" Buffett told the Washington Post in 1998. \"Too many people in music have ruined their lives because they weren't. I'm not a great singer, and I'm only a so-so guitar player. I started running the band years ago because nobody else could, and I turned out to be good at this stuff. There's never been any grand plan to this thing. I'm making it up as I go along. Just trying to work the system while maintaining my '60s anarchic soul\"; and\n\nWHEREAS, after Jimmy Buffett's death, the Southern Miss football team honored its celebrated alumnus. Southern Miss hosted Alcorn State at M.M. Roberts Stadium to kick off the 2023 season. Many Golden Eagles fans paid tribute to Buffett by sporting baseball jerseys the school unveiled during the 2011 season. As part of \"Parrothead Night at The Pete,\" the Southern Miss baseball team wore the pastel blue jerseys for the first time against the University of New Orleans on April 15, 2011. Before a moment of silence was held, the public address announcer said \"The University of Southern Mississippi joins the world in mourning his loss and reminds everyone as Jimmy would sing to you, 'Just enjoy this ride on my trip around the sun until it is done'\"; and\n\nWHEREAS, a proud supporter of his alma mater, Buffett, a native of Pascagoula, Mississippi, earned a degree in history from the university, where he was a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. A bronze marker located near \"The Hub,\" a historic center of student activity on the Hattiesburg campus, notes where he met musical collaborator Greg \"Fingers\" Taylor, who together founded the longtime chart-topping song machine \"The Coral Reefer Band\"; and\n\nWHEREAS, on September 15, 2015, Jimmy Buffett returned to his birthplace, where the City of Pascagoula honored him with the dedication of a small, yet significant bridge that crosses over the murky waters of Baptiste Bayou as it flows through the Mississippi Sound and into the Gulf of Mexico. The bridge, this particular bayou and location help signify the humble beginnings of Buffet and what he has become to mean to so many adoring and loyal fans. While visiting his grandparents' home on Parsley Avenue, Jimmy's grandfather, a ship captain, pulled out one of his treasured maps to share with his grandson. They took a brief walk to the nearby bayou, and his grandfather discussed with Jimmy something that would impact his life forever. Jimmy, the 'Son of a Son of a Sailor,' was told that bayou led to the rest of the world. He was told, \"The world is yours if you want it to be\" and at the dedication, he was met by a few thousand waiting fans and beautiful blue skies. Once on the stage, the City of Pascagoula presented Buffett with several honors. Mayor Jim Blevins presented Buffet with a key to the city, and the bridge over Baptiste Bayou was officially renamed the \"Jimmy Buffett Bridge.\" The Mississippi State Legislature also proclaimed May 6 as \"Jimmy Buffett Day\" in honor of the wedding anniversary of Buffetts' parents, James Jr., and Mary Buffett. Also presented to Buffett was the sign that would be erected at Pascagoula's three entrances. A sign that will proudly share with each passerby that Pascagoula is the birthplace of Jimmy Buffett; and\n\nWHEREAS, following the official ceremony, the band of two - Buffett and Mac McAnnally played nine songs that were fitting choices making reference to Pascagoula and the Gulf Coast. Buffett quoted Mark Twain by saying, \"You write what you know about.\" First up was his song \"Pascagoula Run\" from the 1989 album Off to See the Lizard, since it clearly uses Pascagoula within its title. The set continued with \"Life is Just a Tire Swing,\" \"Son of a Son of a Sailor,\" \"Bama Breeze\" and, of course, \"Margaritaville.\" The show ended on a much loved and emotional note with Buffett's ode to his grandfather, \"The Captain and the Kid.\" The City of Pascagoula, the Gulf Coast and the entire region has much appreciation for Jimmy Buffett and is happy to call him one of its own; and\n\nWHEREAS, Jimmy Buffett, Mac McAnally and the late B.B. King were among the inductees to the 2020 Mississippi Songwriter Hall of Fame. At the induction ceremony Pascagoula Mayor Steve Demetropoulos congratulated Buffett, who was born in the city on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. \"It's been said that Mississippi is the birth place of America's music. Well, Jimmy Buffett is America's music.\" Buffett responded, \"It's a long way from the Pascagoula run, and my early days growing up in Mississippi certainly had an impact on the way I wrote songs and what I wrote about. So, thank you Mississippi for that\";\n\nWHEREAS, Jimmy Buffett is survived by his wife of 46 years, Jane (Slagsvol) Buffett; daughters, Savannah Jane (Joshua) and Sarah Delaney; son, Cameron Marley (Lara); grandson, Marley Ray; his Montana sister, Laurie Buffett McGuane (Tom); their children, Heather Hume, Anne Buffett McGuane, Maggie McGuane and Thomas McGuane IV; his Alabama sister, Lucy Buffett and daughters, Mara Delaney Buffett O'Dwyer and Melanie Leigh Buffett; and many more wonderful cousins, nieces and nephews; and\n\nWHEREAS, Jimmy Buffett will be celebrated for his impact on Mississippi, American pop culture and his own style of rock music:\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI, That we mourn the loss and celebrate the contributions and career of Mississippi music icon and Tropical Rock legend and USM alumnus Jimmy Buffett of Pascagoula, Mississippi, who created his own genre of music and a worldwide music business empire, and express the sympathy of the Legislature on the passing of this Mississippi music legend.\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED That this resolution be presented to the surviving family of Jimmy Buffett, forwarded to the Mississippi Music Hall of Fame and the National Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and be made available to the Capitol Press Corps."
