As the Coronavirus spread around the world, the country, and the region, college life seemed to change overnight.\n\nTo honor your commitment, President Roger Stanford, Distinguished Alumni Chad Wehrs, and Student Ambassador Abdul Cole have created a special video message. We have also posted below the list of Fall 2019, Spring 2020, and Summer 2020 graduates – the people who would have walked across the stage.
