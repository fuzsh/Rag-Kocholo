        "text": "A NUMBER of mobile and broadband providers used by millions of Brits have axed \"sneaky\" charges for customers.\n\nThe firms are getting ahead of new Ofcom rules which are set to simplify mid-contract price rises.\n\nPreviously, increases were expressed to users as a percentage linked to inflation.\n\nNow, though, they will be clearly displayed in pounds and pence so Brits know exactly what they are facing and can compare rates.\n\nIncreases will also have to be set out at the time that you sign up to the deal and can't be sprung on you suddenly from October this year under the new rules.\n\nSeveral companies are implementing the changes from this month and have laid out what it means for their customers already.\n\nPrices can still rise, but it will be clearer by how much.\n\nAs the inflation rate can vary from one month to the next, it means it's unclear for customers exactly how much that rise is until confirmed.\n\nErnest Doku, telecoms expert at Uswitch, said the new rule \"provides certainty when it comes to the cost of your contract and makes it easier for customers to manage their finances\".\n\nPLUSNET\n\nFirst of all, Plusnet will apply a flat rate charge for all broadband customers, increasing by £3 a month each year.\n\nThe changes will be implemented on March 31 each year, so if you pay £30 a month now, that will go to £33 in 2025 and £36 in 2026.\n\nPreviously they increased by the rate of inflation plus 3.9%.\n\nThe change will apply to new and existing customers taking out fresh contracts from July 11.\n\nThe £3 price rise will then apply annually from March 31, starting in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile a 5% rise will apply to out-of-bundle services.\n\nThose who stay on a new contract without renewing will face the inflation plus 3.9% rise. What the rate of inflation is will depend closer to the time\n\nEE AND BT\n\nLikewise, broadband and mobile coverage from EE and BT will take a similar route.\n\nEE Mobile deals will rise by £1.50 a month along the same annual structure.\n\nUsers of connected devices, including laptops, tablets and smartwatches, will see the same increase.\n\nThis will be £2 for TV customers and £3 for broadband, with the same 5% rise in out-of-bundle prices.\n\nThat's instead of CPI inflation plus 3.9%. Under this rule it meant that bills increased by 7.9%, based on January's inflation being 4%.\n\nThe new rise in pounds will apply to new customers from March 31, 2025.\n\nThe provider has said those vulnerable customers on EE Basics or BT Home Essentials contracts will be exempt from any price rises.\n\nVODAFONE\n\nFinally, sticking with mobile deals, Vodafone will inform customers upfront about the exact cost of their contracts in pounds and pence, including when price rises will occur, from July 2.\n\nFor instance, customers who sign a contract in August 2024 will still see their bills adjusted in April 2025 and then again in April 2026 by a predetermined amount:\n\nIt will charge £1 a month more for phone coverage and £3 for its broadband.\n\nHowever, existing customers will not see an immediate change as it will only affect new customers or those renewing a contract with the telecom provider.\n\nVodafone customers who signed up for a mobile or broadband package before July 2 will still face inflation-linked price rises each April until they switch or change deal.\n\nThis means these customers' prices will rise by whatever December's inflation figure is plus 3.9%.\n\nFor example, if inflation stood at 3% in December 2024, the price of your contract would rise by 6.9% in April 2025.\n\nThis would mean someone paying £25 a month would see their bill rise by £1.73 to £26.73 a month.\n\nVodafone has said that price increases will not be applied to customers identified as financially vulnerable or those on social tariffs.\n\nIt comes after Sun Money revealed that firms were hiking deals by up to £50.\n\nWhat's changing?\n\nTelecoms firms have come under fire for above-inflation mid-contract price rises on fixed contracts for the past four years.\n\nDue to clauses in contracts, providers can impose annual rises, usually in April.\n\nThe hikes are tied to either the Consumer Price Index or Retail Price Index inflation rate, which has soared during the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nIt means millions of customers faced hikes of up to 8.8% this year — adding as much as £50 to bills.\n\nFirms argue that they need to be able to increase prices to keep up with rising costs.\n\nBut consumer experts argue that a fixed contract should live up to its name — and stay fixed.\n\nThe mobile and broadband provider has made the change following an Ofcom consultation that saw the regulator stress the need for price transparency.\n\nIt plans to ban mid-contract price increases that aren't set out at the point of signing up from October 2024.\n\nDame Melanie Dawes, chief executive at the regulator Ofcom, said: \"At a time when household finances are under serious strain, customers need prices to be crystal clear.\n\n\"But most people are confused by the unpredictability and complexity of inflation-linked price rise terms written into their contract, which undermines customers' ability to shop around.\n\n\"Our tougher protections would ban this practice once and for all, giving mobile customers the clarity and certainty that they need to secure the best deal to suit their needs and budgets.\""
