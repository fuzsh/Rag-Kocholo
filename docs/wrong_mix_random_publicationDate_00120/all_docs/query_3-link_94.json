        "text": "Labour MP Clive Lewis stages anti-monarchy protest\n\nLabour MP Clive Lewis has sparked an angry row after staging an anti-monarchy protest while pledging allegiance to King Charles when he was sworn in as an MP in the House of Commons this week.\n\nMr Lewis, who has represented Norwich South since 2015, expressed his hopes for a British republic, as opposed to the current monarchic system.\n\nHe said: “I take this oath under protest and in the hope that one day my fellow citizens will democratically decide to live in a republic.”\n\nAnd now, the pro-monarchy campaign group Royalists UK is seeking further clarity on whether the Labour MP’s affirmation itself was legal.\n\nDon't miss... Royalist campaigners call for Labour MP to lose whip over anti-monarchy protest [INSIGHT]\n\nThey said in a post on social media site X: “We have written to the Clerk of the House of Commons to dispute the validity of Mr Lewis's affirmation, during which he deliberated omitted allegiance to His Majesty's heirs and successors.\n\n“We also wish to establish the steps taken to ensure that MPs have taken their oaths or affirmations in accordance with the Promissory Oaths Act 1868 and the Oaths Act 1978.”\n\nThe allegiance is a legal requirement and MPs are not allowed to speak in debates, vote or receive their salary until they do so. The same applies to peers in the House of Lords.\n\nThe Royalist UK group previously said in a post on X: “Clive’s actions today undermine our constitutional traditions.\n\n“Labour should withdraw the whip immediately. This man should not represent the party of government.”\n\nDon't miss... Jon Ashworth blasted for 'thinking voters owe him' after Kay Burley grilling [VIDEO]\n\nThe campaigners were not the only ones to react with anger to the MP’s Parliamentary stunt, with some on social media branding it “disgusting” and another saying it was “empty posturing and virtue signalling”.\n\nProtect_ServeUK wrote: \"I'm sorry if you can't do this properly you should be marched out, and told that until such time as you can, then you're not an MP.\n\n“Imagine police officers doing this during their oath of office ceremonies. Disgusting.\"\n\nMelanie Cycles replied to the post: \"Meaningless virtue signalling.\n\n“Either refuse to do it and stand by your actual convictions, or just do it as it should be done.\n\n“But this isn't a protest it's empty posturing and virtue signalling.\"\n\nLabour and Mr Lewis were contacted for comment."
