        "text": "Faith in Covid vaccines is highest in the UK, with nearly nine in 10 saying they trust the jabs, a survey of people in 15 countries suggests.\n\nIsrael, where 83% expressed faith in vaccines, came next. Japan reported the lowest levels of trust at 47%.\n\nThe Imperial College London team, who have tracked people's attitudes to the vaccinations since November, say overall trust has climbed.\n\nBut they say there is still work to be done to boost confidence in vaccines.\n\nThe survey, in collaboration with YouGov, involved more than 68,000 people.\n\nSafety concerns\n\nIt found - in countries where vaccines were not yet widely available - the most common reason for not having a jab was not being eligible for one.\n\nThe UK and Israel are among the nations which have administered the highest number of vaccine doses to date.\n\nIn the UK, where 87% of survey respondents reported they had faith in the jab, more than half of all adults have now had both doses of a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nIn contrast, Japan's vaccination drive started late and was hampered by supply shortages and organisational hurdles.\n\nOther concerns highlighted in the survey revolved around potential side-effects and safety.\n\nIt also suggests confidence in health authorities varied.\n\nPeople in the UK had the highest level of confidence that health authorities would provide them with an effective vaccine, at 70%\n\nIn South Korea, the figure was 42%\n\nSarah Jones, one of the project leaders at Imperial College London, said she was encouraged that trust was increasing.\n\n\"However, our findings show that there is still much work to be done to reassure the public of the safety and effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines,\" she said.\n\n\"We hope that sharing the concerns people have raised will spur timely and targeted responses from governments that will inform and educate the public about the importance of vaccination.\"\n\nMelanie Leis, who co-led the project, said: \"From our data we can see that people trust different Covid-19 vaccines to different extents."
