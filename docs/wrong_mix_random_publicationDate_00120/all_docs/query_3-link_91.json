        "text": "A MAJOR broadband provider with one million customers is to axe \"sneaky\" mid-contract prices hikes from today.\n\nPlusnet, part of the BT Group, has said it will no longer raise prices mid-contract based on a percentage linked to inflation.\n\nPrices can still go up, but instead, they will be expressed in pounds and pence, giving customers a clearer idea of how much more they might pay,\n\nThe move comes ahead of plans by regulator Ofcom to bring in rules making this compulsory for all providers.\n\nIt plans to ban mid-contract price increases that aren't set out at the point of signing up from October 2024.\n\nPlusnet will start showing rises in pounds and pence from now on, instead of percentages for customers so they are less unpredictable.\n\nIt will apply mid-contract charges at a flat rate for all customers, which is a yearly increase of £3 per month.\n\nOut-of-bundle services will be subject to an annual 5% increase.\n\nFor example, from now, if a customer has a new broadband contract at £30 per month, their price from March 31, 2025 will be £33 per month and £36 per month from March 31, 2026.\n\nA Plusnet spokesperson said: \"We have introduced a pricing model aligned with Ofcom’s approach, offering our customers a predictable long-term view of their contract terms.\n\n\"These new contracts will make it simpler for our customers and provide more certainty on what annual price changes will be.”\n\nIn March, the firm increased prices by the CPI inflation plus 3.9%.\n\nAs the inflation rate can vary from one month to the next, it means it's unclear for customers exactly how much that rise is until confirmed.\n\nIn Plusnet's case, the rise was based on December's inflation data which was released in January.\n\nInflation was 4% which means the bills increased by 7.9% at the end of last month.\n\nErnest Doku, telecoms expert at Uswitch, said: \"Uswitch welcomes the greater clarity given to consumers by Plusnet’s decision to change to a ‘pounds and pence’ model for future mid-contract price increases.\n\n\"The new model provides certainty when it comes to the cost of your contract and makes it easier for customers to manage their finances.\n\n\"This move aligns with parent company BT who were the first provider to announce the new approach to mid-contract price rises earlier this year, followed by Vodafone more recently.\"\n\nBT and EE announced it would be making the change back in April.\n\nPlus, Vodafone has said it will no longer apply inflation-linked price rises for consumers and some small business customers.\n\nNew rules are on the way\n\nOfcom announced last month that firms will soon be ordered to clearly state any proposed price rises during fixed contracts in pounds and pence.\n\nThe regulator is seeking to ban firms from including any inflation-linked or percentage-based price rises on all new contracts.\n\nIf current plans go ahead, the new rules, which Ofcom has consulted on, should come into effect by October.\n\nOfcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes said: \"At a time when household finances are under serious strain, customers need prices to be crystal clear.\n\n\"But most people are confused by the unpredictability and complexity of inflation-linked price rise terms written into their contract, which undermines customers' ability to shop around.\n\n\"Our tougher protections would ban this practice once and for all, giving mobile customers the clarity and certainty that they need to secure the best deal to suit their needs and budgets.\"\n\nDo you have a money problem that needs sorting?
