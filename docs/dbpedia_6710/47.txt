Research

I am an Associate Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Rice University in Houston, Texas (USA).

I want to understand the origin of structure and matter in our cosmos. Some questions that interest me include: How did the universe first get populated with particles during the hot big bang (reheating after inflation)? What is the nature of dark matter (with focus on axions, vector and higher spin dark matter)? Can we probe the intrinsic spin of dark matter from astrophysics? My expertise lies in exploring the nonlinear dynamics of cosmological fields -- both in the context of the early universe and the contemporary universe. On the mathematical side, I am fascinated by solitons, their interactions and their relevance to cosmology. I have also delved into problems related to understanding aspects of Hubble tension, Dark Energy, gravitational waves, CMB spectral distortions, Black hole accretion discs and exoplanets.

I tend to get really excited about teaching and public outreach [recent Solar Eclipse Talk, 2024 ] (slides)
