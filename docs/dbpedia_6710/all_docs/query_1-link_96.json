        "text": "The IAU Division C Commission 55, Communicating Astronomy with the Public, played an active role in Union affairs within Division C, Education, Outreach and Heritage. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) vested considerable responsibility for its public outreach efforts in Commission 55 (C55), Communicating Astronomy with the Public. This article briefly recounts the origin and history of C55 over the past decade, and describes the work of C55 until it became Division C Commission C.C2 in 2015. As stated on our website, http://www.communicatingastronomy.org, C55 was founded on the principle that “it is the responsibility of every practising astronomer to play some role in explaining the interest and value of science to our real employers, the taxpayers of the world.” While this was true a decade ago, when the Working Group that eventually became C55 first took shape, it is even more true today, when funding for the astronomical sciences (and science more generally) is under th...\n\nThe business meeting was opened by the President, Dafydd Evans, who presented the agenda, which was approved. It was agreed that Norbert Zacharias should be the secretary of the meeting and take the minutes. This session was attended by about 20 participants.\n\nC46 is a Commission of the Executive Committee of the IAU under Division XII Union-Wide Activities. Aiming at improvement of astronomy education and research at all levels worldwide (through the various projects it initiates),maintains, develops, as well as through the dissemination of information. C46 has 332 members and it was managed by the Organizing Committee, formed by the Commission President (Rosa M. Ros, from Spain), the Vice-Presiden (John Hearnshaw, from New Zealand), the Retiring President (Magda Stavinschi, from Romania), the Vice-President of the IAU (George Miley, from Netherland) and the PG chairs: • Worldwide Development of Astronomy WWDA: John Hearnshaw • Teaching Astronomy for Development TAD: Edward Guinan and Laurence A. Marshall • International Schools for Young Astronomers ISYA; chair: Jean-Pierre de Greve • Network for Astronomy School Education NASE: Rosa M. Ros and Beatriz Garcia • Public Understanding at the times of Solar Eclipses and transit Phenomena PU...\n\nA good fraction of the Commission 55 (C55) Organizing Committee met in Beijing in August at the XXVIII IAU General Assembly, where C55 organized Special Session 14 (SpS14) entitled “Communicating Astronomy with the Public for Scientists.” During our C55 business meeting, and again during an impromptu gathering a few days later, we discussed changes in the IAU&#39;s organizational and programmatic structure and how these changes might affect C55. This report summarizes key points and offers some ideas about what we&#39;re calling “C55 v2.0.” For background and reference, see the C55 website at http://www.communicatingastronomy.org.\n\nIAU Commission 41 (History of Astronomy) was founded in 1948, and between 1991 and its termination in 2015 this Commission hosted seven different Working Groups (one of which was shared with Commission 40 (Radio Astronomy). In this paper we list the objectives of these seven Working Groups and track their progress. We conclude by evaluating the role that each C41 Working Group played in furthering research on the history of astronomy."
