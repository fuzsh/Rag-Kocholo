The CAREER award is presented to junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.\n\nProfessor Holz's research focuses on the interplay of general relativity, astrophysics, and cosmology. Recently he has been working on using gravitational waves and gravitational lensing as cosmological probes.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: Daniel E. Holz\n\nPizza with Professors\n\nOn February 20th, the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics (KICP) partnered with The Society of Women in Physics (SWIP) to hold \"Pizza with Professors,\" a dinner and discussion about the joys and stresses of pursuing a career in physics. KICP professors and post-doctoral fellows joined faculty from the Physics department in sharing dinner and experiences with around 50 enthusiastic undergraduate physics majors. The event was held in the Kersten Family Atrium of the University's Gordon Center for the Integrative Sciences and participants left with a better appreciation of what a career in physics or a related field ultimately requires.\n\nMarilena Loverde: ATLAS Peeped\n\nMarilena Loverde, who will be joining the KICP as a postdoc later this year, shows off another of her talents in the Washington Post's 5th Annual Peeps Diorama contest with her entry, \"ATLAS Peeped.\"\n\n\"ATLAS Peeped\", by Mark Trodden, Discover Magazine\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: Marilena LoVerde\n\nBrothers and Sisters4Science Discover the Universe with KICP Scientists!\n\nKICP Fellow Elise Jennings and Graduate Students Chris Greer and Immanuel Buder recently shared their enthusiasm for Cosmology by participating in Project Exploration's Brothers and Sisters4Science programs at local schools.\n\nRead more >>\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: Elise Jennings\n\nKICP Students: Immanuel Buder; Christopher Greer\n\nSPT/SAIC exhibit\n\nPhotos: SAIC SPT exhibit; South Pole Telescope assembly by Jason Smith\n\nAs part of our ongoing partnership with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), students in an Architecture, interior architecture and designed objects (AAIDO) studio course designed and constructed a portable exhibit about the South Pole Telescope. This installation pays homage to the 100 years of exploration and discovery at the South Pole and to the most recent scientific achievements of SPT.\n\nVisual imagery provides a glimpse into life and research at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. Interactive components include a backdrop of the ceremonial South Pole and Extreme Cold Weather (ECW) gear photo op and a multi-touch table that encourages self-guided exploration of images, videos and data. The first destination for the exhibit is the USA Science and Engineering Festival in Washington DC (April 27-29) where Tom Plagge, Tyler Natoli and Kyle Story will represent the SPT science team. Other planned deployments include The World Science Festival Street Fair and special events at SAIC.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: John E. Carlstrom; Randall H. Landsberg; Tom Plagge; Kathryn K.

Olinto\n\nElise Jennings has been awarded a Springer Thesis Prize\n\nKICP is pleased to announce that Elise Jennings has been awarded a Springer Thesis Prize for her thesis \"Simulations of Dark Energy Cosmologies\".\n\nSimulations of Dark Energy Cosmologies\n\nA major outstanding problem in physics is understanding the nature of the dark energy that is driving the accelerating expansion of the Universe. This thesis makes a significant contribution by demonstrating, for the first time, using state-of-the-art computer simulations, that the interpretation of future galaxy survey measurements is far more subtle than is widely assumed, and that a major revision to our models of these effects is urgently needed. The work contained in the thesis was used by the WiggleZ dark energy survey to measure the growth rate of cosmic structure in 2011 and had a direct impact on the design of the surveys to be conducted by the European Space Agency's Euclid mission, a 650 million euro project to measure dark energy.\n\nSpringer Theses Award\n\nSpringer Theses is restricted to truly outstanding original work that makes a substantial contribution to research in its field. The author of each thesis accepted into the series will receive a prize of €500. Theses will be published both in print and in Springer's prominent eBook programme, thus becoming accessible to millions of readers worldwide through SpringerLink. The prestige and visibility associated with the prize-winning publication will help to further the career of deserving students.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: Elise Jennings\n\nStephan S. Meyer and the WMAP team awarded the 2012 Gruber Cosmology Prize\n\nProf. Stephan S. Meyer will share the $500,000 award of the 2012 Gruber Cosmology Prize with NASA Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) lead Charles Bennett and other colleagues from the team.\n\nThe WMAP team used observations of the so-called \"echo of the Big Bang,\" the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, to determine the universe's vital statistics - its age, content, geometry, and origin. This feat in turn has helped transform cosmology itself into a precision science.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: Stephan S.

Particularly exciting has been his work on dark matter interpretations of the signals reported by the CoGeNT, CRESST and DAMA experiments. While we cannot say for certain yet whether these experiments are seeing dark matter particles, Chris' work has certainly helped to make these experiments and their anomalous results a \"hot topic\" among particle physicists and cosmologists.\"\n\n- Dan Hooper, PhD advisor\n\nChristopher has received a postdoctoral scholar position at the University of Utah.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: Daniel Hooper\n\nKICP Students: Christopher M.

Remarkably, the results show that galaxies such as our Milky Way have formed more than 80% of their stars over the last ten billion years of the evolution, and less than 20% during the first three billion years. This result is at variance with most simulations of galaxy formation and may help to explain why simulations generally fail to produce late-type disk galaxies with small bulges. In his paper, Sam has also uncovered a curious discrepancy between the star formation histories of dwarf galaxies derived using the method he used and those deduced from the color-magnitude diagram of stars for nearby dwarfs.\"\n\n- Andrey Kravtsov, PhD advisor\n\nSamuel has received a Prize Postdoctoral fellow position in the Center for Theory and Computation at the University of Maryland.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: Andrey V.

She led the effort to measure this lensing signal in Stripe 82 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with results that will help calibrate cluster masses and begin the community on the road to measuring tomography. For her thesis, Melanie studied the important effect that it is difficult to locate the true center of a galaxy cluster. This \"mis-ceterning\" problem leads to incorrect mass determinations. By using a combination of simulations and data from SDSS, Melanie quantified both the effect and various algorithms proposed to address it.\"\n\n- Scott Dodelson, PhD advisor\n\nMelanie has received a postdoctoral position at the Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: Scott Dodelson\n\nKICP Students: Melanie Simet\n\nScientific projects: Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\n\nChristopher Williams has been awarded a 2012 CCAPP Price Prize\n\nCongratulations to KICP graduate student Christopher Williams, who was awarded a 2012 CCAPP Price Prize for his work on novel methods for the detection of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays, which include the MIcrowave Detection of Air Showers (MIDAS) experiment.

Turner\n\nThe MIDAS telescope installed at the Pierre Auger Observatory\n\nThe MIDAS (MIcrowave Detection of Air Showers) experiment has been recently installed at the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina. MIDAS employs a novel technique to detect ultra-high energy cosmic rays, based on microwave emission from the cosmic ray shower developing in the atmosphere. Results from a prototype telescope, which was mounted at the 4.5 meter parabolic dish on the roof of the Kersten Physics Teaching Center at the University of Chicago, have been recently published on Physical Review D. Following the successful run in Chicago, the MIDAS camera and electronics were disassembled and shipped to Argentina, where simultaneous detection of ultra-high energy cosmic rays with the Pierre Auger Observatory will be pursued. Former KICP fellow Pedro Facal and graduate student Chris Williams traveled to Argentina between August and September to deploy the instrument on a new 5 meter parabolic dish located close the Los Leones Fluorescence Detector. The installation was completed in three weeks, and commissioning and calibration of the telescope are undergoing. MIDAS will take data for about a year searching for events detected in coincidence with the Pierre Auger Observatory.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: Pedro Facal; Paolo Privitera\n\nKICP Students: Christopher Williams\n\nScientific projects: Microwave Detection of Air Showers (MIDAS)\n\nCongratulations to Dr. Christopher Greer!\n\nCongratulations to Christopher Greer for successfully defending his PhD dissertation on \"Calibrating Optical Richness using Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Observations.\"\n\n\"Chris Greer made critical contributions to the building and deploying of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Array (SZA), an interferometric array of 3.5 meter mm-wave telescopes located at the CARMA site in California. He used the SZA to image the SZ effect for a sample of galaxy clusters selected by their richness in the SDSS maxBCG cluster catalog. His thesis provides the first joint calibration of the SZ and optical mass-observable relation. This work is important for using cluster surveys for constraining cosmology, in particular the nature of dark energy, and it provides the ground work for the upcoming joint analysis of the large South Pole Telescope and Dark Energy Survey data sets.\"\n\n- John Carlstrom, PhD advisor\n\nChristopher has received a postdoctoral researcher position at Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: John E.
