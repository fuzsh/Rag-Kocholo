A Q&A session will follow. A free meal will be provided each session!.\n\nPHYSICS 95Q. The Philosophies of Three Great Physicists. 3 Units.\n\nRichard Feynman has famously said, Philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds. A closer look at key moments in the history of physics, however, reveals a different picture. Contrary to the misconception that philosophy has nothing to offer to science in general, and physics in particular, watershed moments in the development of physics were inspired and motivated by deeply held philosophical principles. Similarly, important developments in physics have generated important and difficult philosophical questions. In this sophomore seminar we will explore three significant moments in the development of physics surrounding the works of Newton, Einstein, and Bohr. We will analyze the relationship between the prevailing philosophical views they espoused and the physics they produced. How did Newton come to the view of absolute and fixed space and time? What led Einstein to reject the notion of a fixed space and time and propose a relativistic, and even dynamic space-time? What is Bohr's influential doctrine of complementary, and why did several generations of physicists believe it to be an adequate philosophical response to quantum mechanics? We will see that the relationship between philosophy and physics is more similar to the relationship between mathematics and physics where progress in one area is often preceded and followed by progress in the second.\n\nPHYSICS 96N. Harmony and the Universe. 3 Units.\n\nHarmony is a multifaceted concept that has profoundly connects music, mathematics, physics, philosophy, physiology, and psychology. We will explore the evolution of our understanding of harmony and its immediate application in the function of musical instruments, and employ it as a nexus to understand its role in revolutionary scientific advances in gravity, relativity, quantum mechanics, and cosmology. In these explorations, we will examine some of the fundamental mathematical tools which provide us our current understanding of harmony. We will also see how the some concepts surrounding harmony are in tension, if not conflict, and how some great thinkers have followed them down down blind alleys and dead ends. The aim of the course is to show the enormous consequences of harmony in the evolution of our understanding of the universe, and how science itself progresses in fits, starts, and setbacks as old ideas intermingle with new developments. We will also see how objective/quantitative aspects of harmony interact with subjective/qualitative considerations, and how cultural perspectives and prejudices can affect the progression of science.\n\nPHYSICS 100.

No formal electronics experience is required beyond exposure to concepts from introductory Physics or Engineering courses (Ohm's law, charge conservation, physics of capacitors and inductors, etc.). Recommended prerequisite: PHYSICS 43 and 44 or PHYSICS 63 and 64, or Engineering 40A or 40M.\n\nPHYSICS 105.

Experimental Methods in Quantum Physics. 4 Units.\n\nExperimental physics lab course aimed at providing an understanding of and appreciation for experimental methods in physics, including the capabilities and limitations, both fundamental and technical. Students perform experiments that use optics, lasers, and electronics to measure fundamental constants of nature, perform measurements at the atomic level, and analyze results. Goals include developing an understanding of measurement precision and accuracy through concepts of spectral-analysis of coherent signals combined with noise. We explore the fundamental limits to measurement set by thermal noise at finite temperature, as well as optical shot-noise in photo-detection that sets the standard quantum limit in detecting light. Spectroscopy of light emitted from atoms reveals the quantum nature of atomic energy levels, and when combined with theoretical models provides information on atomic structure and fundamental constants of nature (e.g. the fine structure constant that characterizes the strength of all electro-magnetic interactions, and the ratio of the electron mass to the proton mass, me/mp. Experiments may include laser spectroscopy to determine the interatomic potential, effective spring constant, and binding energy of a diatomic molecule, or measure the speed of light. This course will provide hands-on experience with semiconductor diode lasers, basic optics, propagation and detection of optical beams, and related electronics and laboratory instrumentation.nFor lab notebooks the class uses an integrated online environment for data analysis, curve fitting, (system is based on Jupyter notebooks, Python, and document preparation).

We will also touch on theoretical ideas - all of them currently still being explored and hence controversial - concerning theories of unconventional metallic states - i.e. metallic states that cannot be well described in the context of a theory of weakly interacting quasiparticles. While the subject matter of this course is motivated by ongoing experimental studies in a variety of quantum materials and devices, the principle focus of the class will be on a coherent understanding of what is known and on crisply identifying what is not known.\n\nPHYSICS 490.
