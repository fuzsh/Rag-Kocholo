        "text": "Heidelberg Joint Astronomical Colloquium\n\nThe Heidelberg Joint Astronomical Colloquium typically takes place on Tuesdays at 16h in the Grand Lecture Hall of the old Physics Building at Philosophenweg 12. Due to the global Corona pandemic the colloquium is currently held via zoom. The current schedule is available at HePhySTO (https://www.physik.uni-heidelberg.de/hephysto/index.php?s=event&id=1)\n\nThere is a special HJAC youtube channel you can visit. This will always feature the most recent talks plus all previous ones. There is a possibility to subscribe to this channel. The final responsibility for the time of winter semester 2009/2010 to winter semester 2015/2016 goes to H.-G. Ludwig and N. Christlieb, for the period of winter term 2012/2013 to summer term 2016 it goes to C. Dullemond, for the time of winter semester 2016/2017 to summer semester 2019 it goes to R. Klessen, for the time of winter term 2019/2020 to winter term 2020/2021 it goes to D. Kruijssen. Since summer term 2021, the colloquium organisers are R. Tuffs and R. Klessen.\n\nThe colloquium is organized jointly by the six astronomical institutes in Heidelberg. These are Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI), Institut für theoretische Astrophysik (ITA), Landessternwarte (LSW), Max-Planck Institute für Astronomie (MPIA), Max-Planck Institut für Kernphysik (MPIK), and the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS).\n\nCurrent Program\n\nProgram of the winter term 2022/2023 (copied from HePhySTO):\n\nTesting theories of regulated star formation in clumpy, gas-rich disk galaxies\n\nProfessor Deanne Fisher\n\n18 Oct 2022, 16:00\n\nThe Sun as a Variable Star\n\nProfessor Sarbani Basu\n\n25 Oct 2022, 16:00\n\nHow the Sun and its siblings were born as a family but drifted apart\n\nProfessor Simon Portegies Zwart\n\n8 Nov 2022, 16:00\n\nMolecular Astrophysics at the Cryogenic Storage Ring\n\nDr Holger Kreckel\n\n15 Nov 2022, 16:00\n\nOur X-ray view of the Milky Way center, its outflow, and the circumgalactic medium\n\nDr Gabriele Ponti\n\n22 Nov 2022, 16:00\n\nThe connection(s) between galaxies and their gaseous halos\n\nDr Dylan Nelson\n\n29 Nov 2022, 16:00\n\nExploring the Diversity of Exoplanet Atmospheres\n\nDr Hannah Wakeford\n\n13 Dec 2022, 16:00\n\nHow heavy is the most massive star?\n\nProfessor Jorick Vink\n\n10 Jan 2023, 16:00\n\nMeasuring Hubble’s Constant to 1 percent using Pulsating Stars\n\nDr. Richard Anderson\n\n17 Jan 2023, 16:00\n\nConnecting Exoplanet Properties to Planet Formation: a New Paradigm Emerges\n\nProf. Ralph E.
