        "text": "Zierler:\n\nThis is David Zierler, oral historian for the American Institute of Physics. It is November 17th, 2020. I'm so happy to be here with Professor David N. Spergel. David, it's good to see you. Thank you so much for joining me today.\n\nSpergel:\n\nOh, pleasure.\n\nZierler:\n\nOK. So to start, would you please tell me your title or titles and institutional affiliations, and I pluralized both because I know you have many.\n\nSpergel:\n\nI am the Director of the Center for Computational Astrophysics at the Flatiron Institute, a new institute funded by the Simons Foundation. To give the full title, I am the Charles Young Professor of Astronomy on the Class of 1897 Foundation, Emeritus, at Princeton.\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh] David, let's unpack both of those a little bit. First of all, who was Charles Young and what is your connection to that named chair?\n\nSpergel:\n\nCharles Young was professor of astronomy at Princeton back in 1877. He had moved to Princeton from Dartmouth. I'd have to look up the history to be certain of it. The chair was set up back in 1927 when Henry Norris Russell, who was leading Princeton astrophysics, was offered a professorship at Yale. He was a Princeton alum, and his classmates endowed a research chair for him at their 30th reunion. It was one of the first research chairs endowed at Princeton, and it was a very nice one as it came with such substantial research funds. Henry Norris Russell held it for many years. After him, Lyman Spitzer held the chair. After Lyman Spitzer, Jerry Ostriker. After Jerry Ostriker, Scott Tremaine, and then I held it for a bit more than a decade.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd when did you go emeritus?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI went emeritus just over a year ago. I joined the Princeton faculty back in 1987 and was there until I moved to New York. When I first moved to New York to set up this new institute, I kept my Princeton position. I had a joint appointment for three years. I went back and forth. I felt that I sort of didn't want to hold two really good positions, so decided to take emeritus status.\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh]\n\nSpergel:\n\nIt really wasn't fair to the field to clog the system up. Princeton had been very good to me. I felt that it wasn't fair to Princeton to be part-time in that position. I also felt by taking emeritus status and giving up tenure, I was sending a message to the Simons Foundation and to the staff at the CCA. I chose emeritus status at a very young age I was 59 when I become an emeritus faculty member.\n\nI think that's actually worked out well. Princeton recently hired Eliot Quataert from Berkeley and that's a terrific move. I had been part of a series of really superb theoretical astrophysicists who held that chair. It was an honor to be on that list. I think Eliot is a great successor to that, so I was pleased how that worked.\n\nNew York has been really an exciting opportunity. Basically, Jim Simons turned to me and said, \"We want you to set up a center for computational astrophysics,\" gave me the funds to operate it, the resources to hire about 60 people, and the flexibility to do it in a way that I thought was most effective. I got to help design what is a beautiful space that I'm in right now, which is this Flatiron Institute, and got to very quickly build up something that I think has become an important center. We did this by starting out with a lot of joint hires: David Hogg from NYU, Greg Bryan from Columbia and Rachel Somerville from Rutgers. We then did a series of new hires,: Will Farr and Phil Armitage with Stony Brook and Yuri Levin with Columbia. Will moved from Britain, Phil from Colorado. Yuri Levin moved from Australia to Columbia for a joint position. We then hired a whole series of joint junior faculty to new positions. So we've, hired two at Columbia, Colin Hill and Melissa Ness, Blakesley Burkhart with Rutgers, Ruth Angus with the Museum of Natural History, Ken Van Tilburg with NYU and Chiara Mingarelli and Daniel Angles-Alcazar with U Conn. We’re just about to pursue two new joint hires, one with CUNY and one with Cooper Union. We’re also hired about a dozen people full-time at the junior faculty level. After two years, Rachel Somerville moved to full-time, and Shirley Ho moved here from a tenured position in Carnegie Mellon and a staff position at LBL. In addition, we’ve got about 25 postdocs, five visiting graduate students who are here for five months, and a number of sabbatical visitors.\n\nZierler:\n\nDavid, when did you connect with Jim Simons? How did that come together for you?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI had met Jim by being on an advisory board for him for math and physical sciences. I knew him a bit but not very well. He decided to set up this institute about seven years ago. He staged a retreat to Buttermilk Falls with a group of leading scientists looking for ideas on new directions for the foundation: he was expanding the Simons Foundation and wanted to think about what to do next. Ingrid Daubechies, the applied mathematician from Duke, at the meeting suggested, why don't you set up an institute focused on computational sciences? Ingrid may have wanted that institute at Duke. But Jim liked the idea and thought it would be interesting to set one up here in New York. He started by hiring Leslie Greengard to run a program initially called SCDA (Simons Center for Data Analysis) that grew into our computational biology institute, and then started looking around for other areas. I got a call from Andy Millis, who was, I think, associate director for physics at the Simons Foundation at the time, saying that they're interested in computational astrophysics, would I be willing to run a half-day workshop on what are the opportunities in computational astrophysics? I had no idea at the time that this was something that was going to lead to a position here. I just thought this was an opportunity to kind of promote the field and convince the Simons Foundation to make an investment in this area. I put together a half-day program, invited in Eliot, Lars Hernquist from Harvard, Rachel Somerville, Shirley Ho, David Hogg, and Greg Bryan. A number of the people who were there that day become involved in the center. We did a half-day program, at the end of which Jim asked me to come to his office and offered me this job on the spot, and sort of outlined what would be the resources available. I then took about a month trying to figure out whether I wanted to take this job. At the time, I was exploring another opportunity that I was on the short list for. I had been at Princeton for 30 years and had been department chair for 10. I was ready for the next challenge. This was an interesting challenge, and so I took this up.\n\nZierler:\n\nNow, of course, the Simons Foundation precedes the Flatiron Institute, but does the Center for Computational Astrophysics precede your tenure or were you the founding director for that?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI was the founding director. Will this transcript be published after December 16th?\n\nZierler:\n\nNo.\n\nSpergel:\n\nNo. It won't be published before December 16th?\n\nZierler:\n\nDefinitely not.\n\nSpergel:\n\nOK. Then, I can tell you that I'm going to then become the president of the Simons Foundation. That will become public knowledge December 16th.\n\nZierler:\n\nOK.\n\nSpergel:\n\nSo I'll actually stay here, and Jim Simons will announce his retirement and I'll start running the foundation here.\n\nZierler:\n\nDavid, for better or worse, given your experience and those of many of your colleagues, to what extent is the business model of the Flatiron Institute sort of—I don't know if poaching is the right word, but making offers that are just extremely too attractive for people to retain solely academic appointments?\n\nSpergel:\n\nWe actually haven't moved that many people to full-time positions. What I've tried to do is to make New York a real center for computational astrophysics. So I've have bribed universities to make hires.\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh]\n\nSpergel:\n\nThe model that we've used for a lot of these positions is we've picked up half the cost of the position for the first three to five years and picked up the startup.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nThis makes it much easier for a university to add a new line, often commit to new hires in advance of retirements. I like to joke that the position is almost free for five years and then there's a new dean so that's the next dean's problem.\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh]\n\nSpergel:\n\nIt's been very attractive to the surrounding universities. We've added nearly a dozen positions in the region in computational astrophysics. In the pre-COVID days, we were running about 50 workshops a year: many of them would attract a lot of the locals. We would run weekly meetings where people would be coming from Yale and Princeton and Stony Brook, and certainly from closer institutions [NYU, CUNY, Rutgers, Columbia]. We had a lot of people coming through from Europe: we were able to really take advantage of New York's location as a travel hub. I think that we have succeeded in the four years to really create an intellectual center where lots and lots of people would interact. I'm sure when COVID is done this will all come back. I felt that that was one of the kind of valuable ways we can use these resources. We've also tried to create new types of opportunities with the permanent positions: a number of the people we've hired are doing things that are really valuable in terms of developing codes and supporting those codes for the scientific community. Many of them worked on code development, something that are not directly valued in the universities, but important to the field\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nSome of this work is already supported in the national labs and places like Space Telescope Science Institute, but the focus there is often service for particular telescope projects or DOE mission-driven for the labs. We have the flexibility to support a number of people who are important to astrophysics and don’t fit into the universities or the national labs. I think that's been primarily how we've been using those resources.\n\nZierler:\n\nDavid, it sounds like your collaborations and affiliations with universities confers all of the benefits of having those institutional connections with none of the constraints of actually being either physically or administratively located within a university setting. So I wonder if you might explain how that translates to what kinds of things the Flatiron Institute, and specifically the Center for Computational Astrophysics, has been able to do as a result of this very unique place that it exists in the larger ecosystem?\n\nSpergel:\n\nA bunch of different things. One of the programs we set up is a visiting student program where students come for five months here. We provide housing and full support, and they work on a project with some of the research staff here. And this is a model where kind of—and we've actually expanded this through the Flatiron Institute to some of the other centers (Computational Biology, Computational Neuroscience and Computational Quantum Materials). \\Students doing computational work at their department and are often the only computational student, can come here and be part of a much larger community. Typically, most departments will have only one faculty member who thinks of themselves as a computational astrophysicist (or computational biologist). There's 60 people here on the staff. When you consider all the graduate students working with people here, there is more like 100 people coming here each week. I have four students from Princeton working with me who are coming here once a week, and the same is true of many of the people here. They've got students in surrounding places. So you have a community of more than a hundred people doing computational astrophysics that you're part of, and that's, I think, been very valuable for people. We set up a program this summer that worked very well, partnering with the National Society of Black Physicists. I felt that with COVID shutting everything down over the summer, it was clear to me in April that many people would lose their summer internships and not have opportunities. And I think for many people the chance to work before going to graduate school is just so important to have the experience of research.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nThe people who have been hurt by COVID the most are the people with the fewest resources.\n\nZierler:\n\nSure.\n\nSpergel:\n\nI think you see that both in terms of the deaths from COVID among the African American and Hispanic communities, but I think it's also the people who are most hurt by school closures and cancellations of summer programs. So we partnered with NSBP. We had 20 students this summer working remotely with our research staff and they had a great time, and papers and projects and came out and everything. And one of the nice things about being funded by the Simons Foundation and basically—I have a budget that I control pretty much as I see fit for supporting research that I can move quickly when there's opportunities like that. It’s also the way we can move quickly when there's something interesting scientifically. When neutron star collisions happen, and we want to organize a workshop two weeks later, we can just do it. And we don't have to apply for some grants to do it, we just do it. So that's really been fun to have that ability to make things happen.\n\nZierler:\n\nThis is a question I posed to Geoffrey West at the Santa Fe Institute, and I think it's quite relevant for you, as well. I've talked to so many deans of science and department chairs about the way that COVID is making everyone rethink really fundamental things in higher education. And people are legitimately concerned about—even at institutions like MIT and Caltech, they're really concerned about what's the value of an education if it's held online. And so I want to ask you, in what ways does COVID perhaps offer opportunities for the Flatiron Institute in its education mission, in terms of just rethinking the way that science is taught and the physicality of where science is taught? Has COVID offered any opportunities for the Flatiron Institute to offer new models in physics education and science education generally?\n\nSpergel:\n\nThere were some things we were doing already that put us in a good situation for continuing. So one of the things that was nice about building a building four years ago—or redoing a building—is that it was clear already that things like Zoom would be very valuable. So all of our classrooms are equipped with microphones in the ceilings and multiple cameras so every room we have is set up so that it could be used in the hybrid form. And so pre-COVID we were already running workshops where we had lots of participants in the room but also lots of people remote. And I think we will go back to that with even more remote participation. We were already recording all of our talks and we run summer schools where we have advanced topic lectures, and all that's posted to Zoom. And I would say this isn't a COVID change, we had done this before COVID, and I think we will just continue to do more of it. On the other hand, I have been suspicious of on-line education. Now, I taught an online class, I have an online course called Imagining other Earths. That was a freshman seminar that 40,000 students have taken. It's been available for eight years. So I certainly see a value in online education, but I do not see it in any way as a replacement for in-person education and the experience, perhaps most importantly, of working together with other students. In a way, the lectures could be online, but you need to be gathered in a room with others to do problem sets. That's how I learned physics as an undergrad. Some of the people I did problem sets with are still close friends. And I think that's very important for students, and I think they've really lost out this year at places like Princeton that went remote. I have a lot of respect for the places like Duke and Cornell that have made the effort to stay open.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd, David, just so I understand, the educational offerings of the Flatiron Institute, from every level from undergraduate to postdoc, do you see them as complementary to traditional academic environments or are any of those offerings understood to be alternatives to traditional academic environments?\n\nSpergel:\n\nNo, complementary.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nSo the model—we do not give out PhDs, we do not give out degrees. But, on the other hand, if you're a student and want to learn about machine learning and astrophysics, and that course is not really going to be open at your university, or you want to get really more deeply into computational fluid dynamics, we have advanced lectures and schools.\n\nZierler:\n\nI see.\n\nSpergel:\n\nAdvanced courses for specialists that we provide, often things a typical graduate program will not be able to offer.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd this is true even at the postdoc level, people are not being postdoctoral researchers at the Flatiron Institute, are they?\n\nSpergel:\n\nOh, no, people are being postdocs.\n\nZierler:\n\nOh, they are? OK.\n\nSpergel:\n\nYeah. We are competing with universities in many ways for postdocs, so we will compete with Harvard or Berkeley for a postdoc.\n\nZierler:\n\nRight. So four years is a relatively—it's barely one academic generation. How have the postdocs fared counterfactually, to where some of these postdocs might have gone otherwise?\n\nSpergel:\n\nWell, our postdocs have done very well. We very quickly got excellent people and they went to good places. The counterfactual is very hard to know because the people we made offers to, had they gone to Berkeley, they would've done well there, too. Now, one of the things we've done again regionally is we've made a whole bunch of joint postdoc offers, too. So a lot of our postdocs are spending two years at Columbia, two years here, and going back and forth. I've used that to also lengthen the postdocs, so some of them are four or five years. I would like to see a world in which people did not have to move around so much as postdocs. I think that that's been—it's difficult on peoples' lives. I think it's something that—it hurts everyone. It tends to hurt female postdocs more than males because spouses or partners are less likely to move. So the ability to be able to offer for these longer-term things and having the flexibility to do these joint positions I think has been working well for the people involved, so that's been good. And with the postdocs—one of the things I do this afternoon is I will chair the meeting to look at the candidates for the next set of hires—is we're hiring them as a cohort rather than hiring them stove-piped to particular projects attached with individual grants. And I think that tends to give a more diverse group of postdocs in multidimensions, certainly more diverse in terms of gender, and we at least have a modest number of people from under-represented groups, but also diverse in terms of we have a bunch of people whose backgrounds are more in particle physics or computer science. And this, I think, creates a place where we can learn from them and they can learn from us. So being able to view things as a cohort is sort of an opportunity to structure things differently.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd it certainly sounds like there are multidisciplinary opportunities that are more easily transversed than they would be in traditional academic departments?\n\nSpergel:\n\nYeah. Now, one of the areas where I think we—and, again, it's four years, so I think we've had an impact but it's very early. I invented this place from scratch and made up all these things from scratch, so I'm seeing how things go as they come along. One of the areas where we have made a big investment in machine learning and its applications. All of our centers here have people working in machine learning. Shirley Ho, who is running our group here, has built up a pretty big group of people. She has a crazy number of students working with her—20 graduate students all around the country working with researchers here on machine learning applications. David Hogg is also training a lot of students and postdocs in statistics and machine learning. There's a lot of interest among the students in applying machine learning to problems in physics and astrophysics, and not that many people trained in it. We’ve been working pretty closely with people at Center for Data Science at NYU and some of the folks like Bin Yu at Berkeley. We've been learning a lot from the machine learning community and we've become a place where people can learn statistics and machine learning and apply it to astrophysics. And I sort of see that as one of our opportunities is to move into new areas like that.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd either for financial need or for building those institutional relationships, is there ever any need to look for funding sources beyond the Simons Foundation, like the NSF or DOE or DOD?\n\nSpergel:\n\nBecause of our tax status we cannot accept funding from them.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nNow, that's here. Now, remember, lots of people have joint positions.\n\nZierler:\n\nRight.\n\nSpergel:\n\nSo I actually hold grants at Princeton. Many of my colleagues here with joint positions are holding grants at Columbia or NYU or Rutgers. The model we had is that—again, it's four years old, so, like, the model is still being invented—is that the graduate students are sitting at their home universities. The grants supporting the graduate students who are sitting at the universities. The postdocs are being supported entirely here.\n\nZierler:\n\nRight, right.\n\nSpergel:\n\nThe graduate students typically spend three, four days a week at their home university. They come here one or two days a week. One of the delicate balances with the surrounding universities is to make sure they feel that we are complementing and enhancing what they're doing; we're not stealing their students and faculty.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah. And I can think of a million examples, but one that just comes to mind is DARPA's interest in quantum computing must have a lot of overlap with the Flatiron Institute's interest in quantum computing.\n\nSpergel:\n\nSome, but we're interested more in quantum materials, so Antoine Georges' and Andy Millis' focus is on solving many electron problems in quantum materials which is different from the quantum computing. Our interest in machine learning is more resonant with a lot of the federal funds going to machine learning.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nSo one of the things we're doing—and I think there will be opportunities to do even more of this—is we've been partnering with NYU, Columbia and Princeton on proposals for centers for machine learning applications in the sciences. This is something where we're also taking advantage of the fact that New York is one of the centers for machine learning also on the industry side. Within a mile radius of where I am now, we've got Facebook's research center with Yann LeCun, and Samsung's and Microsoft and Google's big research centers. Pre-COVID, we were running—and this is Flatiron wide, but led out of astrophysics—weekly machine learning seminars. These attracted a lot of the industry researchers to. One of our abilities is the power to host meetings, where it's easier for someone from Facebook to meet someone from Google here than at either building.\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh] Sure.\n\nSpergel:\n\nIt's even easier for NYU and Columbia to meet here.\n\nZierler:\n\nSure. It's a safe space.\n\nSpergel:\n\nExactly. One of the things we've been trying to do is encourage those conversations. I am convinced that machine learning will be useful for physics. There's lots of little things that you get to do better. What's not clear to me yet is whether it will be transformative.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nI’m working on two big applications of machine learning to physics with various students and postdocs. One is a big program of forward-modeling the universe: start from initial conditions and run them forward to match our observation of the large-scale structure of the universe. Our goal is to infer the initial conditions of the universe.\n\nZierler:\n\nWow!\n\nSpergel:\n\nNow, to do that fast enough so that you can recover the 1011 values that you need for the initial conditions, you can't run an N-body and hydrosimulation that does galaxy information that many times. We are developing neural nets that learn from the hydrosimulations. We’ve run some of the largest set of N-body simulations and some of the largest sets of hydrosimulations here. We have a lot of computing here. We’re developing machine learning techniques to learn how to forward model from the simulations. This work raises interesting kinds of computer science questions about including symmetries in the neural networks. My hope is over the next five years we'll have the ability to do this forward modelling. We're now working on the inference problem with, if we could forward model, what's the best way to do the inference problem?\n\nZierler:\n\nIn determining the threshold for what counts as a transformative advance in physics, in this model, what are the foundational questions that you're after? Are these things like discovering dark energy, dark matter, that kind of thing?\n\nSpergel:\n\nThat's one set of things, and we can make progress on that. The other—and this is the second strand in my current machine learning work —is can we do multiscale physics with machine learning? So the way I think about this is, let's say I have some small box that I can simulate and evolve forward in time. I want to coarse grid the small box it so that I can have a set of rules describe what's happening in the small box, embed it in a bigger box, and evolve it forward and get statistically the same kind of result in the small box. So I can take a problem—and one of the things we've been looking at for this is turbulence and magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. So turbulence is, I don't know, a 150-year old problem. We know the underlying physics, but we can't simulate the dynamical range needed for the laboratory, and we'll probably never be able to simulate the dynamical range needed for astrophysics with just direct numerical simulation. So we always have to come up with subgrid models. And the way that I think about a subgrid model is I have some—say I could do all the physics right and I had some box with a billion numbers that I want to evolve forward and capture in cloud formation what's happening on the droplet scale, and turbulence what's happening on small scales, can I learn the laws of physics I need to have a more accurate subgrid model, to do something better than approximating the small scale physics with an effective viscosity? And we're working on a couple different approaches of doing that using machine learning. I think of machine learning as being an effective way to get a low-dimensional representation of a function in a high-dimensional space. The classic machine learning problems I think about is I give you lots of images of cats and dogs. Cats and dogs are pictures, and let's say with a megapixel camera so they represent points in a million-dimensional space and intensity as each picture, and I want to draw a surface in that million-dimensional space that separates cats from dogs. So I have a low dimensional representation of the key distinctions in that high-dimensional space. So what I'd like to do is have a low-dimensional representation of, say, something like turbulence where I describe it by more than a single number, an effective viscosity. I'd like to have a representation—I don't know, 10 numbers, 100 numbers. Can we use machine learning to do that? If we can, that to me would be transformative: there's a whole class of problems in physics that we can’t solve now. multiscale physics problems. These might now become doable. So that would be a fundamental progress not in understanding the basic laws but our ability to solve and make predictions in complex situations.\n\nZierler:\n\nSo for one obvious really big example, in just your understanding of what gap machine learning might fill, how might machine learning get us closer to understanding how gravity works with the standard model?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI'm not sure. So I see it more—the two strands we've been looking at are, can we use it to make more accurate predictions from observations? Can we get at things like neutrino mass? Which would be nice to know—I don't know at the end of the day how fundamental it will be—but by getting more value out of the observations we take. And the other is, can we address these multiscale problems?\n\nZierler:\n\nWell, David, let's do some oral history. We've been talking—\n\nSpergel:\n\nOK.\n\nZierler:\n\n—in this amazing discussion about all of your present—it's so exciting to hear that, but let's take it all the way back to the beginning. I'd like to start first with your parents. Tell me a little bit about them.\n\nSpergel:\n\nMy father was a physics professor, so I'm in the family business. My father grew up on the lower east side of New York. His parents were immigrants from Eastern Europe who came over around 1910. My grandfather actually before the first world war he came from what is Galicia was then part of the Austria Hungarian Empire. My grandmother on that side came from the region around Warsaw in Poland. My grandparents ran a grocery store. My father went to college. He went to RPI and then Rochester where he worked with Bob Marshak.\n\nZierler:\n\nOh, wow!\n\nSpergel:\n\nAnd then, the story my dad told was Bob Marshak told him that he would make sure that my dad never get an academic job. After graduation in 1965, my father went to work for Grumman Aerospace.\n\nZierler:\n\nUh-huh.\n\nSpergel:\n\nIn the '60s, City University was expanding,. He moved to be one of the founding faculty at York College in Jamaica, which serves mostly first-generation kids growing up in Queens. He was a physics professor there and eventually became the chair of natural sciences at York College. He retired a number of years ago. My mother grew up in Queens. She went to Cornell School of Home Economics [Now, Human Ecology]. She then would go on to teach high school for many years: high school home economics. She got tired of that and went to law school in her late 40s. She practiced for a few years and then taught law classes at York. I grew up in Huntington, Long Island: a comfortable middle-class upbringing with academic parents.\n\nZierler:\n\nYour parents are Jewish?\n\nSpergel:\n\nMy parents are Jewish.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid you grow up Jewishly connected at all?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI did. I was bar mitzvahed. My father was the vice-president of education at the conservative synagogue, so I went not only to Hebrew school but Hebrew high school. I can read Torah, I know the tropes, I know a little bit of Talmud. I went to public schools, but am modestly knowledgeable—not deeply knowledgeable, but modestly knowledgeable about Judaism.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid your father involve you in his career at all? In other words, did you know what it meant to be a physics professor even when you were a kid?\n\nSpergel:\n\nLittle bit. Not deeply. And I think in some ways one of the things that was helpful for me—well, certainly, I was exposed to it—but I also had a sense that it would be a career that I would enjoy. And while I certainly ended up going on a track that took me to sort of R1 top university path, I knew that I would be comfortable teaching physics at a mostly teaching institution. That to me was like a good thing to do and would be a fulfilling life. 'Cause I saw my dad was happy doing what he did. And I think that, looking at a lot of the students and postdocs who've worked with me, a lot of them feel real pressure to—if you're not at MIT or Berkeley, you're somehow just not a success. And I just think that was really good to have that background.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhen did you start to get interested in science? Was it early on?\n\nSpergel:\n\nPretty early on. I was interested in math and science. I was on the high school math team and did well in the competitions. I participated in what was then called the Westinghouse Science Talent Search.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd you probably benefited from excellent science and math education in high school?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI went to a good suburban high school, and I had some good teachers. It wasn't off scale great. It wasn't like Stuyvesant, it wasn't the very best, but it was a good education. I also read a lot\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd when you were thinking about undergraduate programs to apply to, were you specifically thinking about physics programs?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI was thinking about physics programs. I was also interested potentially in going into law. When I applied to colleges, I was debating between physics and law. Back in those days, you could apply early action to multiple places, so I applied to MIT, Yale, Princeton and Harvard.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat was your batting average?\n\nSpergel:\n\nThree out of four. Everywhere but Harvard. And I was on the waiting list at Harvard.\n\nZierler:\n\nI wonder if your father, just being in the field, if he had useful input on the different kinds of physics programs that you were considering, because these are schools with very different approaches to physics.\n\nSpergel:\n\nHe gave me good advice along the way, but that particular decision less so. That particular decision, that was actually more driven by the non-physics aspects of it. Yale physics at the time—may even still be true—I felt that Yale didn't treat physics like its most important department; it prioritized humanities. So it came down to Princeton and MIT for me, and then I decided I wanted to be in the liberal arts environment.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhere you could focus on physics but have a broader education?\n\nSpergel:\n\nYeah.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid you do a good job of taking advantage of that?\n\nSpergel:\n\nYeah, I did. I'd usually take one extra course a semester beyond the standard, so five classes a semester. I studied art and music and a lot of history and political science classes.\n\nZierler:\n\nWho were—this is not a question I would normally ask because undergraduates, their worldview is rather narrow, but given the influence of your father, I wonder if you were alive to the concept of trendiness in physics or what was considered at the time the really important research that was going on or the luminaries in the faculty? On that basis, what was really exciting during your time at Princeton as an undergraduate?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI was very lucky as an undergraduate in terms of who I was exposed to. I took, as a sophomore, quantum mechanics from Jim Peebles and really liked Jim as a professor. He was a very good teacher.\n\nZierler:\n\nHow so?\n\nSpergel:\n\nHe taught quantum mechanics when I was a sophomore and stat math and thermodynamics when I was a junior. I ended up taking four out of my eight core physics classes from Jim Peebles.\n\nZierler:\n\nBasically anything he taught you wanted to take?\n\nSpergel:\n\nExactly. During my sophomore year, Jim gave a lecture on the current state of cosmology as the last lecture of the quantum mechanics course. I really regret that I can not find the notes for this class. Jim and I discussed this, and he doesn’t have the notes either. I also asked several of my classmates— no one seems to have the notes. He gave a lecture on problems in cosmology. He talked about the flatness problem. He talked about dark matter. He talked about his understanding of cosmology in 1980. I was at the Nobel Prize ceremony when he got the Nobel Prize and I've known him well I really regret I don't have those notes and he didn't have those notes: it would have been interesting to capture his view at that moment. As a Princeton student, I knew about dark matter and things like that very early and understood that it was an important problem. I did my first junior paper with James Binney, who was a visiting assistant professor at the time, in galactic dynamics, and that was wonderful. My fall semester junior paper turned into a published paper. During the spring of my junior year I worked with Jill Knapp and developed a proposal to observe at the Very Large Array. As a senior, I observed at the VLA and at Green Bank. I had real significant radio astronomy experience. It snowed the entire time that I was at Green Bank so that didn’t lead to any science. The VLA observations lead to my second published paper: a mixture of observations and modelling.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat was Knapp working on when you connected?\n\nSpergel:\n\nShe was working on asymptotic giant branch stars.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nMy senior thesis looked at the transition of asymptotic giant branch stars to protoplanetary nebulae. We focused on how at the end of the mass loss phase the star ionized the gas around it. In my junior paper, I made estimates showing that the radio emissions should be detectable. I detected it in the observing run at the VLA in the Fall of my senior year and then spent the spring modelling the data. I was observing at the VLA when it was about half built and pretty quickly learned the software needed to do the mapping.\n\nZierler:\n\nDavid, I love to ask this question because it means different things at different places at different times. If you can isolate in your memory where these terms were and how they were used at Princeton when you were an undergraduate, both substantively, scientifically, and administratively, where is cosmology, where is astrophysics, and where is astronomy?\n\nSpergel:\n\nPrinceton had two department then and it still has two departments: a physics department and an astrophysics department. The astrophysics department was always astrophysics, it was never really astronomy. The focus on theoretical astrophysics goes back to Henry Norris Russell applying ideas from physics to understand spectra, and Spitzer studying plasma physics. Theory was always the focus at Princeton, perhaps because it was not close to a mountain. The department was called the department of astrophysical sciences. I think it was originally department of astronomy. I think Lyman Spitzer made it the department of astrophysical sciences in the '50s when he set up the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab and wanted that to be part of it. The physics department didn't want plasma physics. I believe that there was a third branch back in the 1950s. The physics department didn't really want atomic physics.\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh]\n\nSpergel:\n\nBut Spitzer wanted to be able to measure things like oscillator strengths to interpret spectra. So the astrophysics department absorbed all those things into astrophysical sciences. Subsequently, in physics decided that atomic physics and cosmology were interesting areas.\n\nZierler:\n\nWould anybody have called themselves a cosmologist at that point?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI'm pretty sure Jim Peebles would have called himself a cosmologist.\n\nZierler:\n\nUh-huh.\n\nSpergel:\n\nWhen I was an undergraduate, the senior people in cosmology were Jim Peebles and Jerry Ostriker, who was chair of the astrophysics department. Ostriker and Peebles had written papers back in '74 already on dark matter. I'm an undergraduate from '79 to '82.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nI think in writing those papers, Jim would've seen himself as the cosmologist, Jerry as an astrophysicist.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nWhen I was an undergraduate, I got to know Ethan Vishniac, who had been a graduate student with Bill Press and was then a postdoc with Jerry Ostriker pretty well.\n\nZierler:\n\nSo you connected with Bill Press at Princeton, not first at Harvard?\n\nSpergel:\n\nNo. I connected with Ethan. Ethan influenced my thinking about where to go to graduate school. In my graduate school application said that I wanted to do cosmology. I was interested in the growth of perturbations, how galaxies emerged.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nThis was around the time Bardeen was doing his work on gauge-invariant formalism, and I liked general relativity, I was intrigued by all that, so that was my plan, to go work on that. So I knew I wanted to do cosmology at that point.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhere was general relativity at Princeton when you were an undergraduate? What kind of exposure did you have to GR?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI took a course in general relativity with Rich Gott in my sophomore year, which I really enjoyed. Sitting in my office, I can see on my shelf one of the books that convinced me to become a physicist, Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler’s Gravitation. The book had track one (which was for undergraduates) and track two.\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh]\n\nSpergel:\n\nWe learned track one as undergrads. Princeton finished its classes in December, finals didn't start 'til mid-January. You had sort of four weeks between the end of classes and the start of finals. I actually read most of Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler during that month in my sophomore year. I was home with my family. I would read the book when I was home in Long Island When we went skiing and I would read at night and ski during the day. I would spend two to three hours each day reading Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler. I just thought that was so beautiful.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd given your interest in astronomy, did you ever consider for graduate school a nontheoretical avenue of pursuit?\n\nSpergel:\n\nNo. I wanted to be a theorist. I did enjoy doing the observations, but loved theory. For graduate school, the debate for me was between Harvard and Caltech. Princeton did not, and still does not admit its own undergraduates. I think it's a good policy—There was a view that you should go somewhere else. I debated between working with Roger Blandford at Caltech and working with Bill Press at Harvard. There were probably three factors that led me to go to Harvard. One was, my girlfriend my senior year had applied for and gotten a Rhodes scholarship to go to Oxford. I had written to James Binney about spending a year at Oxford and decided that would be worth doing. By the time all that happened, that relationship ended.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nBut I was still interested in going to Oxford and Bill Press was supportive of my taking a year off. In fact, we would manage to count it as a Harvard enrollment year on leave to Oxford. Roger Blandford was not supportive of that at the time. The other was when I went to visit Caltech, I asked the graduate students, \"How do you meet women here?\"\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh]\n\nSpergel:\n\nThey told me, \"You go to Pasadena Community College. You sign up for a sports class. You pretend that you're not a Caltech student and you can meet them. On the fifth date you confess you're at Caltech.\"\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh]\n\nSpergel:\n\nI went to Harvard to visit, and there was a steady flow of undergrads from Princeton to Harvard, so I knew a lot of people there already, and it was clear that I would have a social life.\n\nZierler:\n\nOr at Caltech you could just be Bill Press and be the kid of a Caltech professor and marry another kid of a Caltech professor.\n\nSpergel:\n\nThat was a possibility.\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh]\n\nSpergel:\n\nAlso, I just hit it off with him [Press]. We got along well.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat was Bill working on when you first connected with him? What was his project at the time?\n\nSpergel:\n\nHis big project was his book, Numerical Recipes. He was working on writing that. Before Harvard, I went to Oxford for a year, I worked with James Binney, we write a couple more papers together. I learned a lot of dynamics. I went to some of my first conferences. When I show up at Harvard as a graduate student, I am pretty far along. I had taken my AP tests in high school. I didn't have an AP physics in high school, but I just taught it to myself. And, of course, there it was helpful, if I had a question, I asked my dad, but I mostly just self-taught. So at Princeton I took, as an undergraduate, most of the required graduate classes my senior year. I was mostly taking graduate classes. So I took a class with Lyman Spitzer. I think I am the youngest—I know I am the youngest person to have taken a class with Lyman Spitzer.\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh] And what was the department at Harvard that you were part of? It wasn't the physics department?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI was in astronomy.\n\nZierler:\n\nRight, right.\n\nSpergel:\n\nI was in astronomy. I did sit in on the field theory classes at Harvard physics, so I was in class with Lisa Randall and the people like that. And actually at Oxford I got to know Brian Greene who was there with me. We worked together some. It was my first year in graduate school. So when I got to Harvard for graduate school, I had taken most of the graduate classes at Princeton, so I took the exams for the Harvard graduate classes when I arrived in September. This meant that I could skip them and graduate more quickly. I would go on to take my qualifying exam at the end of my first year. I only spent two and a quarter years at Harvard as a graduate student. I got my PhD very quickly. When I showed up in Fall 1983, Bill Press suggested to me to work on the solar neutrino problem and to work on an idea he had of having dark matter particles in the star serve as a way of transporting energy efficiently.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nThis was a dynamics problem. I had to compute the behavior of orbits of dark matter particles in the regime in which they had occasional collisions. It turned out to be a problem that I was very well suited for as I had spent the year with Binney learning about orbital dynamics.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah.\n\nSpergel:\n\nIt was just an orbital dynamics problem now with scattering, and I was able to develop a kinetic theory for it. This work led to our first paper on transport and looking at the dark matter properties. We realized the dark matter would annihilate, and Katie Freese—that was now my second year there—Katie Freese had shown up as a postdoc to work with Bill. Katie and I worked together pretty closely on that, and we wrote a paper with Katie and Lawrence Krauss on dark matter annihilation.\n\nZierler:\n\nThat was a big deal, that collaboration?\n\nSpergel:\n\nThat was a big—yeah, back then. When things later came out about Lawrence Krauss a few years ago as part of the Me Too movement, Katie and I emailed each other and said, we were ahead of the curve. We knew he was a problematic guy 30 years ago.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nBut I won't go into more detail on that experience, but—\n\nZierler:\n\nBut 30 years ago is a very long time ago in terms of what's acceptable and what's not, or what passes and what's not.\n\nSpergel:\n\nWell, he was very aggressive. I was a second-year graduate student, and he was pretty aggressive with intellectual property.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nBill Press protected his students, so I was ok. Soon after we finished our paper, Katie had a visitor, Andrzej Drukier, who was working on dark matter experiments. Katie brought the three of us together, we started talking. He talked about what one could do with these experiments. I started thinking about what the dark matter experiments would do. I realized that there would be this modulation effect; that, as the earth moves around the sun, its velocity relative to the dark matter halo would change with time. That would produce a modulation in the dark matter signal, that there'd be a higher rate in June when you're moving faster relative to the dark matter halo and the earth's motion is parallel to the sun's motion around the galaxy. In January it's antiparallel so there's a lower rate. And one of the ways you would know there's dark matter there is seeing this annual modulation. Now, the Italian DAMA experiment has claimed to see this signal It's certainly a statistically significant signal. However, they still haven't convinced most of the community that this is an astrophysical signal as opposed to background, but this was the distinctive signal, and we published that paper. And then, the final part of the thesis work was a collaboration with Andrzej, Graciela Gelmini and Frank Avignone. Frank Avignone and his group had a germanium experiment that was measuring germanium double beta decay. Andrzej recognized that this was a good experiment, it was very sensitive, it might be one we could constrain dark matter with. We did the first analysis actually of dark matter constraint from an experiment and we had published what would be the first dark matter exclusion plots as functions of dark matter mass and cross-section, these are now standard. We were actually able to rule out heavy fourth-generation neutrinos as a dark matter candidate. This paper was the fourth piece of the—or fifth piece as the thesis work. At the time, I also was working with George Field and Alex Vilenkin on cosmic strings. We met at the weekly early universe meeting that Alan Guth, Alex Vilenkin and Lawrence Krauss organized. This meeting brought together people from Harvard, MIT, and Tufts. I learned about the ideas of inflation and cosmic strings and things like that from the meeting I would write a paper with Alex Vilenkin and George Field on superconducting cosmic strings, an idea that Ed Witten had developed and looked into those. So I sort of learned a lot of stuff through those gathering.\n\nZierler:\n\nDavid, I'm curious about your dynamic with Bill as your graduate advisor, part of the thing that's so fun about him is that he's perennially young. He's always young no matter where he is, right? Given how young he was looking back, did that affect your dynamic? Did you work with him more in a collaborative way than you might have with the more senior person?\n\nSpergel:\n\nBill was always dynamic, but he—I did not think of Bill as young.\n\nZierler:\n\nEven though he must've been, what, like, 32, 33?\n\nSpergel:\n\nHe was, like, 33, but I was, like, 21.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah. You're both young.\n\nSpergel:\n\nSo we were both young, right. So I remember—every now and then I do this calculation where it's like, OK, I'm now—Bill back then seemed not quite old, but he wasn't young for me. Bill seemed middle-aged at 33. And I'm now 43, or I'm now 50, or I'm now 59, and, like, Bill, already—I now look at people who are 33 as so young, but, yeah. No, Bill was department chair, and I hadn't appreciated Bill's youthfulness 'til I got much older.\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh]\n\nSpergel:\n\nHe was my advisor. He was older. The same was true for James Binney, who I had worked with earlier. I did my first paper with James. I was 19. James was 30. I thought of him as much older than me—the dynamics group was James and Martin Schwarzschild. Martin was then 65—maybe 67. To me, they were just older.\n\nZierler:\n\nHow closely connected was your research with what Bill was doing at the time, just in terms of as a symbol of your intellectual partnership?\n\nSpergel:\n\nBill was, I think, spending probably most of his time on his Numerical Recipes book, but the thing we did together, we were collaborators. I would say the first two papers, this Press and Spergel, Spergel and Press paper really followed a model that I have often used as an advisor—Bill gave me the idea, I developed it, I would meet with Bill pretty regularly, present what I had done, he would encourage me, make suggestions. It was a mentor-mentee model. The next papers were with Katie Freese, and that was as collaborators. Katie was a couple years older than me, but she and I pretty quickly collaborated as equals, bouncing ideas off of each other. Bill was actually not a co-author on some of those papers, but we would be telling him what we're going. He was a good mentor for me in that, when I made that transition to that kind of work, he encouraged that. That was the next step to my intellectual development. Later, when I was a postdoc at the Institute and also as an assistant professor, Bill and I worked together on a couple of projects. At that point, we were collaborators.\n\nZierler:\n\nWho else was on your committee, your thesis committee?\n\nSpergel:\n\nIt was Bill Press, George Field, and it was supposed to be Alan Guth for the exam, but Alan couldn't make it, so Lawrence Hall was on my committee. John Huchra was the fourth member of the committee.\n\nZierler:\n\nAh. Alan would've been an outside reader from MIT?\n\nSpergel:\n\nThat's right.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid Harvard generally have outside readers for astronomy theses?\n\nSpergel:\n\nNo, but Alan was sort of outside but not too far outside. He was spending a day a week at the Center for Astrophysics.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nSpergel:\n\nOne of the things that Irwin Shapiro, who was director of the CFA, recognized was that the value of science at this new intersection—it was an exciting time in this area between particle physics, and astrophysics and cosmology was an area with a lot of possibility. Irwin had Lawrence Krauss come up a day a week from physics, had Alan Guth there a day a week. I think he was paying Alan as a consultant—I think. Not 100% certain but I'm pretty sure of that. So he was around.\n\nZierler:\n\nAfter you defended, what were the most compelling postgraduate opportunities for you? What were the things that you were considering?\n\nSpergel:\n\nBefore I defended, John Bahcall invited me to come to the Institute for Advanced Study for a week and offered me a long-term membership at the IAS,. It was a five-year postdoc and it was very clear that that was a great opportunity. I didn't actually apply for any jobs.\n\nZierler:\n\nThey reached out to you and it was a done deal?\n\nSpergel:\n\nYes, I didn’t apply. They offered me the job.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd the idea was the Institute would've been head and shoulders above anything else that you might've reached out for so why bother?\n\nSpergel:\n\nYeah, yeah. That was such a great opportunity.\n\nZierler:\n\nHow much of the attraction was working with John Bahcall and how much of it was just being in that intellectual environment for you?\n\nSpergel:\n\nA bit of both.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nAnd also, I knew I would return to interact with astrophysics at Princeton.\n\nZierler:\n\nSo you saw that as part of the deal, that you could have that opportunity to be part of the broader physics and astrophysics community at Princeton proper?\n\nSpergel:\n\nYeah. When I was a graduate student, Jerry Ostriker came up to visit Harvard for a week and told me that they would do a faculty search at Princeton and I would likely be would one of the top candidates.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nI knew that if I were to go to the IAS, I would be on track for this faculty search, too.\n\nZierler:\n\nSo you did see the postdoc as sort of a soft landing to a faculty position at Princeton?\n\nSpergel:\n\nThat's right. I actually defended my thesis in December 1985. I stayed at Harvard 'til May and then took off for about two-and-a-half months to travel around the world. I got one of these round-the-world tickets and went with a friend and went all over. Then went to the Institute. They did the faculty search in the fall of my first year as a postdoc. I was offered the faculty job—I don't remember the date, but winter or spring, sometime that first year. I negotiated to start my faculty job but be on leave the first year. I just stayed at the institute for two years. My second year at the institute I was on leave from the university and then moved over as an assistant professor.\n\nZierler:\n\nHow much exposure as an undergraduate did you have to the Institute? I mean, was this a mythical faraway place for you?\n\nSpergel:\n\nIt was a mythical faraway place.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah. Were there even opportunities for undergraduates to be invited? Would they even be welcome at the institute for seminars, even precocious undergraduates such as yourself?\n\nSpergel:\n\nNope. No. I would try to change that in later years, never quite successfully. There was this Tuesday lunch, which was famous, where people would come—and this is before the archives, so it was a time at which a lot of new results were shown there—and people would sit around this U-shaped table. And when I would first come there as a postdoc, John Bahcall, Lyman Spitzer, Martin Schwarzschild, Jerry Ostriker would sit at the head of the table, and the rest of us would sit below. It was really pretty hierarchical.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd what was John Bahcall working on when you connected with him?\n\nSpergel:\n\nA solar neutrino problem.\n\nZierler:\n\nUh-huh.\n\nSpergel:\n\nAnd also some stuff in galactic dynamics.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid you see this in terms of Bill Press's interests and motivations for you career as this was very sensible in terms of where he wanted you to go and who he wanted you to work with?\n\nSpergel:\n\nYeah. He encouraged me to work with John, both because of John's role as a mentor and John was very influential in being able to place his people in top positions. If you look at who went through the institute in sort of that 20-year period, John's first postdoc is Martin Rees, and then it's Roger Blandford, it's Lars Hernquist. You look through the list of people, say, who are now in the National Academy and who are theoretical astrophysicists, and a substantial fraction of them were postdocs with John. So it was clearly a good opportunity to go there as a postdoc.\n\nZierler:\n\nBeyond the sort of cartoon version of the Institute as a place where geniuses just gathered for tea and discussed big ideas, in what way in the day-to-day was being in that intellectual environment specifically useful to your career at that point? Why was it good to be there for you?\n\nSpergel:\n\nThere were some smart people there. In many ways, one of the most productive things that came out for me of that year or two years was Leo Blitz was on sabbatical there. Leo Blitz was a radio astronomer at the University of Maryland. He was doing a lot of work in galactic dynamics, galactic structure with molecular cloud observations. I was interested in dark matter and I had gotten interested in dark matter experiments. And I knew for dark matter experiments we needed to know the dark matter orbits. And I knew if the dark matter was on radial orbits it would be different than the dark matter being isotropic in terms of its prediction for experiment. I also knew as a dynamicist I would make the galactic halo turn into a bar if it was on radial orbits, so I wanted to constrain it. So I started talking with Leo about this and this grew into a collaboration where we wrote a couple of papers, one showing that the dark matter halo had to be relatively spherical because of the way the disc rotated. We used the HI observations to trace the distribution of gas and showed that the gas was on close to circular orbits: the halo had to be relatively round so the dark matter orbits couldn't be too radial. And that got me interested in galactic dynamics and the idea of a bar. Leo and I then started looking at what could we tell about a bar in the Milky Way. I realized that there would be this perspective effect that if our galaxy was barred, the near side of the bar would appear brighter than the far side and would seem more extended, and we just sort of worked through what it would do. Leo realized that there was this infrared data that was just published from a balloon flight from a Japanese group that we could look at. We were able to show evidence for that from that flight. COBE was launched at this time. The COBE data was not yet public, but the COBE team would then reanalyze the results, and we would subsequently analyze the COBE data. This analysis gave the first photometric evidence that our galaxy was barred.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nThere was earlier work by de Vaucouleurs based on the gas motions in the inner galaxy that suggested our galaxy was a barred galaxy, but I think our work played a pretty significant role in shifting the paradigm of how our galaxy is viewed. We convinced many people we lived in a barred galaxy. I started this work as a postdoc. By the time, we published the papers, I was already a second or maybe third year assistant professor. One of the big benefits for me of being at the IAS was the opportunity to work with Leo and learn from him there. He was another important mentor for me.\n\nZierler:\n\nDavid, where was string theory at the Institute when you were there? Was this a big deal at that time?\n\nSpergel:\n\nIt was a big deal at the time.\n\nZierler:\n\nWho was talking about it, what were some of the exciting developments around string theory, and did you see any relevance of this work to your research?\n\nSpergel:\n\nSo, yeah, string theory was already a big deal when I was at Harvard. It continued. Ed Witten was the guru of string theory and was around. The string quartet papers with Gross and Harvey, those were all happening. String theory seemed very promising, seemed to be a path to a predictive theory of everything. I was very interested in seeing what ways could we say something interesting about string theory from cosmology.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nAmong the things we looked at when I was a graduate student at Harvard was what happened if you had E8 x E8 theory. It implied the existence of a whole another sector that looked like ours. We asked what would that mean in terms of inflation? So we thought through some of that. Ed Witten wrote this paper on superconducting cosmic strings and one of the things I learned a lot from at the institute was thinking through what that would mean physically. I worked on superconducting strings with Jeremy Goodman, who was another long-term member at the Institute who had moved with me—the two of us would be hired together to become junior faculty at Princeton. He and I worked with Tsvi Piran, who was visiting faculty at the Institute, and wrote a paper where we worked through the electrodynamics of superconducting cosmic string. We basically took Jackson’s book on classical electrodynamics, which treats a charged point particle moving on a world line, and worked out what that would do for a superconducting cosmic string moving on a world sheet. So that was fun. And then I started working with Bill Press actually on the electrodynamics of cosmic strings: could you make a dynamo out of a superconducting cosmic string?\n\nZierler:\n\nDavid, just to fast forward to the present on string theory, of course there are two camps, and the range on either side is there are people who have lost patience altogether that string theory is going to yield anything fundamental, and then the other side, there are people who think that lots of exciting things are happening and will continue to happen in string theory. I don't have to name names. You can probably think of who represents each side of the spectrum very well for yourself. But I'm curious, to fast-forward to now and looking to the future, where do you see yourself on that spectrum?\n\nSpergel:\n\nCloser to the optimist about string theory in that I see—string theory has certainly taught us a lot of interesting mathematics. It's turned out to be a useful way of connecting different areas of math and we certainly learned some things from there. The AdS/CFT correspondence has proved to be a powerful way of understanding complex theory. String theory has not lived up to our hopes as being this clear path towards a theory of quantum gravity, but there's sort of no guarantee that we will figure out quantum gravity in the next 50 years. So it may turn out to be the right direction, but we won't know for a long time. On the other hand, I do think we put too many eggs in one basket. I do think it was a mistake to encourage so many of the brightest minds in physics in the past three decades to go into string theory. Maybe if we had half the number of people go into string theory we would've made as much progress and had people explore other ideas. But as a cosmologist thinking about the early universe, I think that string-inspired theories are useful things to think about. On the other hand, I don't think we know that string theory is the extension of standard modeling that will work in the end.\n\nZierler:\n\nI wonder, David, if we can go back to an earlier part in our conversation. You know, historically one of the criticisms, of course, of string theory is that ultimately it dead ends into untestable propositions with things like multiverses.\n\nSpergel:\n\nYeah.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhere might machine learning bridge that gap? Where might machine learning offer modes of testability that currently don't exist in defense of string theory?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI don't see it. Machine learning has offered us ways to explore high-dimensional spaces effectively. If string theory had calculations that needed to be done that you couldn't do because of the dimensionality of a problem, machine learning might be able to help. The problem for string theory with multiverses is not that they can't do the calculation, it is the answer depends on unknown priors.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nI'm very Popperian in my approach to problems. If things aren't falsifiable, they're not interesting, and the multiverse to me isn't interesting. I had the good fortune on working cosmologic microwave background at the time at which—we know stuff now that we didn't know in 1980, and that's great. I don't see the multiverse advancing. I don't see ideas being ruled out. I have worked on ideas like the formation of structure with cosmic strings and the formation of structure with textures. While speculative, those ideas to me were interesting because they could be wrong. The multiverse is not a testable set of ideas, so it's just not interesting to me.\n\nZierler:\n\nBut that's separate from saying, if push comes to shove, do multiverses exist or not? That's a separate statement.\n\nSpergel:\n\nThat's separate, but that means it's a statement we'll never really know the answer to.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nSo there are things that could be true, but we can't disprove or prove them. That, to me, is—\n\nZierler:\n\nSo you're saying as a physicist and not a metaphysicist, it's just simply not interesting to you?\n\nSpergel:\n\nYeah. It's just I don't think it's likely to advance. I think of myself as a pretty practical physicist. I want to have theories that have implications for observations. Whether or not they're observations or experiment that we can do today. We don't have to be able to do that experiment or observations today, but that actually makes eventually testable predictions. I mean, that's why to me things like strings or textures in the early universe were interesting. That's why right now I have a student thinking about neutrino-neutrino interactions and how they might affect the microwave background, because you can test and disprove it and learn something. I think string theory is not untestable. There are testable ideas that come out of string theory: for example, the existence of lots of light axions, and Compatification leads to many dilatons. There are other potentially observational consequences. String theory often produces things that look like Chern-Simons terms in the Lagrangian when you compactify the Calabi-Yau manifold So that, then, has interesting potential physical implications. For me, this makes the string-inspired models, makes it worth understanding. String theory has certainly revealed a very rich mathematical structure, and people have learned a lot exploring in this mathematical structure. It's not something I've done personally, but I think there's a lot of great work there. The multiverse stuff, there's just not—it's not very deep. The anthropic principal is not a rigorous concept. If you talk to a philosopher who's really thought more rigorously about the philosophy of it, they often discount the work. To say that the universe exists because we're here, it’s a tautology. To me it's a bit like someone asking you, like, why are you wearing a red tie today? And my answer is, you're only asking that question because I'm wearing a red tie.\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh]\n\nSpergel:\n\nIt's a tautological answer.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah.\n\nSpergel:\n\nIt doesn't guide you to the next step. So to go back to that 1980 lecture by Jim Peebles that I went to as a sophomore, one of the things he talked about was why the universe is so close to flat. He talked about the fact that it required this fine tuning, that back at Big Bang nucleosynthesis, omega was different from one by a part in 1024and one of the ideas put forward for that was anthropic: if it were any larger, the universe would have collapsed. If it were any smaller, the universe would be empty. In the time between when I attended that lecture and when I went to graduate school, Andrei Linde, Guth, Sato, Steinhardt and others developed inflationary theory. It offered a dynamical solution to that problem. Whether inflation is the ultimate final theory or not we don't know yet, but it's been very successful in fitting a host of observations.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd when you say, \"dynamical solution,\" what do you mean? What does \"dynamical\" mean in this context?\n\nSpergel:\n\nThe dynamics of the scalar field drives the expansion of the universe. When the field is in the false vacuum state, the universe is dark energy-dominated. This dark energy drives inflation and makes omega equals one becomes an attractor rather than a repeller. This is physical explanation of why, for a wide set of initial conditions, the universe ends up flat. So I find that really attractive to have field dynamics explain the initial conditions. The anthropic solution to a problem I view as surrender. It's basically saying we will never figure out a dynamical system solution; we will not be able to understand this in terms of fundamental physics. The anthropic principle says a very set of initial conditions are need for sentient life, so we must have had those very peculiar initial conditions. Even if that turns out to be the correct answer, we’ve learned nothing. We've certainly not worked on the problem of the origin of the universe enough to give up. So if other people want to surrender, that's fine.\n\nZierler:\n\nDavid, while we're on the topic of your lack of charity towards tautology as it relates to unknowable questions in physics, I wonder what your response might be to those who ask, and particularly might have an agenda behind the question, how was the universe created out of nothing by itself? Does physics offer—does cosmology offer a credible answer to the idea that something can be created out of nothing, or do you simply reject that also as a tautology?\n\nSpergel:\n\nNo. It's an interesting question, and it's one that we may not—without a theory of quantum gravity, we may not be ready to answer that question yet, but it's an interesting one. I'd say the hint we have for that is that the total energy of the universe is very close to zero. This is something we now know observationally from measuring the geometry of the universe and seeing that it is close to flat. A flat universe implies that the total energy is zero, and we know that we can make quantum fluctuations of zero energy very easily. So I think that's a hint of what the answer might be. So without a theory of initial conditions, without a theory of quantum gravity, I don't think we can give a really solid answer. I do think that we have a hint that the quantum creation of the universe is at least worth thinking about.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd with or without machine learning, are you generally bullish on the idea of a grand unified theory?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI don't actually see machine learning as vital to the project of unifying the forces. It has worked really well up to now. For me, the most wonderful paper in physics is Wigner's paper on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics—\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh]\n\nSpergel:\n\n—which I'm constantly giving to students to read. One piece of the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics is that symmetries have turned out to be so fundamental for our understanding. The success of the Standard Model, the role of the Higgs, we've gone very far. Electroweak unification has worked, so why not grand unification? I am very optimistic that we will achieve at some point grand unification. I see machine learning—it's a tool for doing calculations and doing statistics in high-dimensional spaces but it's just a mathematical tool. That's all it really it is.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd it's dependent on advances and observation to yield data for the machine learning to process?\n\nSpergel:\n\nThat's right. The machine learning is limited by the training set. The computer doesn’t learn about new regions of parameter space.\n\nZierler:\n\nDavid, when you joined the faculty proper at Princeton, in what ways did that change or influence your research agenda or not? Were you looking to carry over the same questions from the Institute to the faculty?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI continued in much the same direction. I was working on projects ranging from the more observational, studying galactic structure with Leo Blitz, to thinking about defects. For the next step in my research, an important influence was that soon after I started as a faculty member, Neil Turok moved to Princeton as an assistant professor in the physics department. Now, at the time, both Neil and I lived in New York City as both of our spouses were working in New York. My wife was first a medical student, then an intern, then resident and finally a fellow at Mount Sinai and then Columbia. I commuted from New York to Princeton for six years, and Neil and I would take the train together. Neil had started thinking about textures, so I would work with him on textures. We found analytical solutions to texture equations and thought about their astrophysical implications. Neil came at this with a deeper understanding of fundamental physics than I had, and I came at it, I think, with a deeper understanding of astrophysics and computational methods. We wrote a couple of papers and had a productive collaboration. We were thinking about the predictions of the texture model for the microwave background and large-scale. When the COBE results came out, I was at the AAS meeting. I gave one of my first national press interviews about it. I was quoted by Mike Lemonick in , Newsweek saying “we are dead”. The level of fluctuations seen by COBE was too low for defects to seed the observed large scale structure formation. While it would take my colleagues who worked on defects another two or three years to be convinced of the death of the model, it was apparent to me already. I stopped working on defects. I had just gotten tenure at Princeton. I was a little depressed. I had spent about five years working on the texture mode and wondered what to do next. I decided with COBE out, it really changes cosmology; we should have a workshop and bring together the leaders in the field. I went and talked with Dave Wilkinson, Jim Peebles and Lyman Page about hosting a meeting in Princeton. Lyman I have known since graduate school.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nHe had moved to Princeton. He was a graduate student at MIT. When I was at Harvard, we had a close mutual friend, Lynne Deutsch, who was my officemate in graduate school and would become a Professor at Boston University. Sadly, Lynne passed away quite young.\n\nI organized this meeting. George Smoot and Chuck Bennett and people from COBE came. And at the meeting, I remember Rich Gott, a colleague in the astronomy department, got up and said, \"COBE proves the universe is flat.\" I thought, how do we know that?\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh]\n\nSpergel:\n\nThis motivated me to start thinking about negatively curved universes. Marc Kamionkowski had just arrived at the Institute for Advanced Study as a postdoc. Soon after he started at the IAS, he walked into my office and said, \"Let's work on something together.\" I suggested we think about the predictions for negatively curved universes. We worked through the theory and realized that in a negatively curved universe the Doppler peak would shift, acoustic peak would shift to smaller scales. The next set of microwave background experiments could measure the geometry of the universe. We then wrote a follow-up paper with Naoshi Sugiyama that looked at this in more detail. We modified his code to be able to make microwave background predictions for a negatively curved universes. I then giving talks about how we could measure the geometry of the universe with microwave background measurements. Lyman was excited by this, and Lyman and Chuck talked about it and they decided to bring me on as part of the proposal to NASA that became WMAP as the house theorist. (At the time, Dave Wilkinson was still alive and an active part of the project. We called it MAP [Microwave Anisotropy Probe]). For me, joining the MAP team was a big transformation in how I did science. Up to then I was working as a theorist on lots of little projects moving around from area to area.\n\nZierler:\n\nDavid, I just want to interject at this moment and return to the concept of themes, because in your career, this sounds like it's a real narrative turning point in terms of tenure, in terms of you are now latching onto a formative project that is really—it's going to make the name for yourself long term, right?\n\nSpergel:\n\nThat's right.\n\nZierler:\n\nSo to return to the concepts and themes surrounding astronomy and cosmology and theoretical astrophysics, given the fact that these terms are fluid administratively, scientifically, substantively, and also in terms of your own—the niche that you felt like you filled within the faculty or within the collaboration, how were these terms changing in your mind in terms of your approach to the research broadly conceived?\n\nSpergel:\n\nAt the time, I thought of myself as a particle astrophysicist. At one point, I used to claim that I had the office in the astrophysics department closest to physics—\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh]\n\nSpergel:\n\n—as I was the person in the department with closest ties with physics. I was also in this position where most people who thought of themselves as particle astrophysicists came from physics.\n\nZierler:\n\nCame from particle physics?\n\nSpergel:\n\nCame from particle physics. But I felt that I was on this trajectory where, for some—I don't know, accident or intentional—I was always in an astrophysics department. I was in the astrophysics department as an undergrad, as a graduate student of Harvard, I was the department of astronomy. At Princeton, I returned to the astrophysics department.\n\nZierler:\n\nRight. But just so I understand, you bypassed that big narrative of, like, particle physicists post-SSC who were looking for new frontiers and that was their entrée to astrophysics.\n\nSpergel:\n\nRight.\n\nZierler:\n\nYou bypassed all of that.\n\nSpergel:\n\nThat's right. Well, these were my collaborators and people I was learning from, but I felt—I always had a foot in the astronomy side and a foot in that community, so I spoke to both. But I would feel sometimes that working in an interdisciplinary area, there were times I felt I didn't fit in in either community. My astronomy colleagues saw my thinking about cosmic strings or string theory as working on made-up physics. I know this was true in my tenure letters and my external reviews.\n\nOnly two years ago, Sandy Faber, a very distinguished astrophysicist, asked me, “Why did you work on textures?” It is make-believe physics. I thought of it as exploring the physics we don't know yet. Astrophysicists can be intellectually conservative. John Bahcall was one of the people uncomfortable with particle astrophysics. Although, John was the person who I would argue did the most important work in particle astrophysics.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nSpergel:\n\nThe solar neutrino problem turned out to be the particle physics we learned through astrophysics. But I think he would've been very offended to be called a particle astrophysicist.\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh]\n\nSpergel:\n\nActually, I know he did not like being called a particle astrophysicist. But I point out to him that he was at the forefront of it. Many of my colleagues in astrophysics were nervous about the interactions with particle physics.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nOn the other hand, some of my colleagues in particle astrophysics would've viewed astrophysics departments as kind of backward and fuddy-duddy.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nSpergel:\n\nThey felt they didn't have anything to learn from them. But I think, of course, there's an enormous amount to learn from traditional astronomers. So on a good day I felt that I had the advantage of going back and forth between those two worlds.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah.\n\nSpergel:\n\nOn a bad day I wondered where I fit in.\n\nZierler:\n\nDavid, I want to ask about your early impressions of WMAP in the context of – at what point you realized that you were part of something fundamental? So just for an example, to set the stage, one of the things that's so fun about LIGO is that it was almost nothing for so long until very quickly it was everything. So that narrative of LIGO is it has that dramatic—it almost could've been a dud for really decades until the detection, right? At what point—now we know what WMAP has accomplished and what it will continue to accomplish. Did you appreciate even at the beginning that it was set up for greatness, that it was conceived to do fundamental things?\n\nSpergel:\n\nYeah, yeah. No, it was pretty clear—so I remember going to this first meeting where we started to design the experiment, and I already knew that we could measure the geometry of the universe. That was already clear to me before I walked into our first meeting. As soon as I saw the sensitivities that my experimental colleagues felt they'd achieve, I did a very rough calculation of how much we could learn about the basic properties of the universe. This became central to our proposal where I showed how accurately we could measure cosmological parameters. The calculation I did in the proposal arguably was actually a little bit of an oversell. For each parameter I assumed we knew every other parameter perfectly, so I just looked at one at a time. The simplification let me do the calculation more quickly. Soon after we started looking into MAP’s capabilities, I gave the Warner Prize lecture at the AAS meeting in January 1995 in Tucson where I talked about measuring cosmological parameters from the CMB: this was a new idea at the time. Marc Kamionkowski had heard the result and was excited by it and wanted to do a more detailed study. Marc had just started as a faculty member at Columbia. Marc brought in Arthur Kosowsky, who was a new postdoc at Princeton and was another former student of Mike Turner and Rocky Kolb's from Chicago, and Jerry Yungman. In 1997, the four of us did the first Fisher matrix calculations of how well MAP could determine the basic cosmological parameters. MAP launched in 2000, our first paper comes out in 2003, In our 1994 proposal, we had shown that if the experiment worked the way we hoped, that we could measure the basic parameters of the universe's age, of composition, and so on very accurately. It was clear to me at that point that the most interesting possibility would be if we could rule out Lambda-CDM rather than fit it to the data. Already in '94, before the supernova measurements, it was already the preferred model, but certainly not established the way it is today.\n\nIn the Warner Prize lecture, I got up and said, \"If we build this experiment we will measure the fundamental properties of the universe. And we'll have one of two possibilities, either we'll rule out what's now the most popular model or, if it's successful and if its adiabatic fluctuations, we will measure these basic properties to high precision.\" So I was pretty convinced that we would do that early on. Now, I don't think I convinced most other people. People thought it wasn’t possible. I remember talking to Mike Bolte after the results came out a decade later and he said, \"You were right that that would work this way.\" But experiments often promise more than they deliver, and I think that was probably most people's, say, interpretation of my talk. I went around the country d in the mid-'90s, gave a lot of colloquia where I talked about all the things we would learn. I suspect most people felt I was still this fairly young guy—I was 35—was a little suspect. I'd done all this stuff on strings and textures.\n\nThat's right. That's right. How did the collaboration work in terms of the different personalities and sensibilities involved? Who added what and in what ways?\n\nSpergel:\n\nIt worked really well. So what worked well was a bunch of them had worked together on COBE. I was on sabbatical visiting Leo Blitz in '94 when the proposal happened, so I got to know Gary Hinshaw and Chuck Bennett very well. Our families would do things together. I developed a very good relationship with the Goddard people. Lyman and I already knew each other very well. It was a really good team. In a way, we were helped by the fact that the team was too small for the task we had so we all had to work really hard. There was no time for politics. There was no fighting over turf because so much had to get done and there were so few of us. Lyman really led the optical design and a lot of the engineering design. Norm Jarosik played a big role in detector development. Gary Hinshaw became a really good leader and managed the software. Gary and I knew each other as graduate students at Harvard and we worked together quite well. I put together a very good group of students and postdocs around me who developed the software for analysis and interpretation. Chuck Bennett was a terrific project leader. He interfaced with NASA, he managed the engineers, he had a vision of how to get the most out of the scientists on the team. It was a really well-run project.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat were some of the major institutional funders that were necessary for WMAP's success?\n\nSpergel:\n\nWe competed in the Explorer program, so we sent a proposal in and it was one of 40 that were sent in and it was eventually selected. We were pretty much fully funded by NASA. NASA was the major and the dominant source of funds. We had some additional support from Princeton. Princeton gave Lyman some leave, and I had some resources to hire some students and postdocs, so Princeton certainly helped. But it was almost all NASA funding.\n\nZierler:\n\nIn what ways did you contribute to the nuts and bolts aspect of WMAP, just in terms of conceiving the actual instrumentation?\n\nSpergel:\n\nThe instrument design really came from Lyman and Chuck and others. They made the key choices for the detectors and the differential measurements. I developed the science requirements. I understood that to be able to measure the cosmological parameters accurately we needed to know the beam very well, so I showed how we would have to measure that to a high precision. The work pushed the team to develop ways to calibrate the beam. I showed that polarization measurements could be useful for measuring the optical depth, and starting to search for gravitational waves. I made the science case for measuring polarization to test the nature of the fluctuations. The experiment was “sold” in the proposal as a temperature experiment. That's what we promised NASA. However, we tried to make sure we could also achieve interesting polarization results. I helped make the case to achieve that sensitivity.\n\nZierler:\n\nDavid, last question for today's session and then, of course, we can pick back up on this tomorrow. I want to return to the idea of terms as they relate to WMAP. So when we're understanding the Standard Model of cosmology, we have inflation, we have expansion, and then shortly after with Saul Perlmutter we have acceleration, right?\n\nSpergel:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat are these three terms and how does WMAP enhance our understanding of one or all of them?\n\nSpergel:\n\nLet's come back to that, particularly I would say the history of acceleration. Saul and Adam played an important role in establishing it. We're doing this proposal, writing about this before their results come out. Already, it was the standard theory. We should probably talk—let's talk more about that this tomorrow. WMAP—and this is a longer conversation and have an 11:00 call—telling us both about the fluctuations that trace initial conditions that came out of inflation and how these fluctuations evolve to become galaxies. And how they evolved depends on the composition and geometry of the universe. When we proposed this and when we looked at this, it was getting at both pieces of this.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd on that note, I'll let you go. We'll pick right back up tomorrow.\n\nSpergel:\n\nTerrific. So I'll see you tomorrow.\n\nZierler:\n\nOK. Thanks so much, David.\n\nSpergel:\n\nOK.\n\nZierler:\n\nBye.\n\nSpergel:\n\nSure.\n\nZierler:\n\nOK. This is David Zierler, oral historian for the American Institute of Physics. It is November 18th, 2020. I'm so happy to be back with Professor David Spergel. David, thank you so much for joining me today.\n\nSpergel:\n\nPleasure.\n\nZierler:\n\nOK. So I want to build out on my question from yesterday where the last thing we touched on were these terms \"inflation,\" \"expansion,\" and \"acceleration\" of the universe. So let's just go chronologically in understanding the shoulders upon which WMAP was standing. Where was Alan Guth and inflation at the point of conception for WMAP?\n\nSpergel:\n\nThe inflation papers came out back in sort of 1982 to 1985,. By the time that WMAP was conceived the basic theoretical framework was pretty clearly established. The predictions of inflation were well established,: nearly scale-invariant spectrum with a spectral index slightly less than 1, and Gaussian and random phase. There was weak evidence for these predications. The COBE data was consistent with Gaussian fluctuations but really wasn't that sensitive to non-Gaussianities. The balloon and ground-based experiments were consistent with Lambda-CDM but not really able to measure with precision yet the spectrum, so that it was an idea that was theoretically attractive. It was something that people took seriously. Back in 1994 or 1998, I don’t think that many people understood that the upcoming CMB experiments, such as WMAP and Planck would measure the spectral index, constrain the tensor amplitude and the amount of non-Gaussianity with precision. On the other hand, the evidence for the expanding universe y goes back 70 years or 80 years before the mission. The data had been built up over time and basic paradigm of an expanding universe was pretty well established. There was growing evidence for the accelerating universe through the '80s and '90s. We had a lot of evidence suggesting that the total density in matter was less than the critical density. Dynamics, measurements of large-scale structure and cluster counts implied that the matter density was about 20-30% of the critical density. Inflation predicted a flat universe. There were papers by Peebles back in '83 and by Ostriker and [Paul] Steinhardt and Michael Turner and others suggesting our universe is vacuum energy dominated universe, a Lambda-CDM cosmology. By the early 1990s, the predictions of a Lambda-CDM cosmology were well understood.\n\nI remember back in 1994, I helped organize a conference in Princeton—\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nWe had a debate between advocates of the different cosmologies. We could not get anyone to defend a matter dominated CDM cosmology, standard CDM. To fill the slot in the debate, I volunteered represented it in the debate. I did not think that the evidence for it was compelling, but to complete the conference I did it. I presented some new data that Julianne Dalcanton had gotten in her thesis showing that there were larger numbers of low-surface brightness galaxies than people appreciated. I made the case that there could be enormous amounts of mass associated with these low-surface brightness galaxies and the total density of the universe in matter could equal the critical density. I won the debate and standard CDM got the most votes. . This victory was more of a demonstration of my high school debate skills than a convincing scientific argument.\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh]\n\nSpergel:\n\nThe debate was somewhat serious, but also somewhat in jest. It was the last session of a meeting. The supernova data showing acceleration was very important in some ways. While there was already growing evidence for vacuum energy, the supernova data and it was the “tipping point”. It convinced people outside cosmology to take dark energy seriously. In that sense, it was similar to Vera Rubin’s work on dark matter. Prior to her work, people who were sort experts in the subfield thought there was a case for dark matter. Her work convinced the broader scientific community.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nRubin's work really convinced the broader scientific community, and in the same way Perlmutter’s and Riess’s work convinced the community that this was likely true. People were leaning towards it. Data from some of the ground-based experiments, the Miller, Page, and Devlin work with TOCO and then the work with BOOMERanG with the CMB and MAXIMA, TOCO actually first, showed pretty clear evidence for an acoustic peak at about the degree scale. This suggests that the universe is flat. Now, there was some ambiguity at the time because there could be contributions from things like isocurvature fluctuations. These pre-WMAP experiments had already seen the first acoustic peak. WMAP measured the first peaks with precision. However, the basic picture of the properties of the fluctuations was already there, not solidly in place, but it was the preferred model.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm. To what extent did WMAP—not only did it demonstrate how much of the universe is comprised of dark energy, but to what extent did it further our understanding, our ongoing understanding, or what dark energy actually is?\n\nSpergel:\n\nSo let me just step back a bit and try to address all three questions with WMAP. When we look at the microwave background, we learn both about the initial conditions in the early universe that seed the fluctuations and how the fluctuations evolve. We learn both about the early universe at very high redshift and the physics of the universe (and hence its properties) 300,000 years after the Big Bang. WMAP showed that the fluctuations in temperature and polarization are correlated on very large scales: the detection of these adiabatic super-horizon fluctuations is one of WMAP’s most important results. If there was no inflation, then WMAP’s detection implied that these fluctuations were already in place before the universe started expanding. Inflation could explain these large-scale fluctuations: since inflation predicted the universe expanded superluminally. The temperature polarization correlations are strong evidence that either there was something special in the initial conditions or the universe went through a bounce, or you had something like inflation. You were really driven to something beyond what was the standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker expanding universe model. I think that was one of the important things we learned. We were able to measure the distance to the surface of last scatter by seeing the acoustic peak, and that gives us a constraint on the—basically measures the interval of the Hubble parameter from here now back to redshift of 1100. And that gives us a lot of constraints on what the dark energy could be.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nIt required the dark energy to have an equation of state close to that of vacuum energy. Another important thing that the WMAP measurements told us is that it requires that there be dark matter back at that time and that dark matter was non-baryonic.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nIn order to see the acoustic peaks the way we do, and particularly to see the third peak, you're seeing—so the physics of the microwave background fluctuations, or you've got this baryon photon fluid, where the electrons and protons are coupled by their electromagnetism and the electron and photons by collisions. The protons-electrons and photons form a single fluid that responds to the fluctuations by producing soundwaves. The soundwaves propagate out from dense regions and the cold dark matter stays in place. The deeper gravitational potential well associated with the dark matter produces a cold spot surrounded by a hot ring generated by the outflowing sound waves in the proton-electron-photon fluid. Without cold dark matter, you won’t get this distinctive pattern.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSpergel:\n\nWe see in the microwave sky the signature of non-baryonic dark matter. WMAP provided firm evidence that dark matter is something that doesn't interact with photons, electrons or protons. It's something new. Something beyond what's in the Standard Model.\n\nZierler:\n\nHow useful by order of elimination, in terms of understanding dark matter, if we can clear away what it's not, what does that leave us with?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI think that's how we have been making some progress, at least.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah.\n\nSpergel:\n\nBy figuring out what it's not, we move to figure out what it is. WMAP and the CMB observations show it's something beyond what we seen in any terrestrial experiment up to now. It eliminates many possibilities: very low mass stars or planets or black holes that formed after redshift of 1100. This dark component was there back at redshift of 1100. Since the universe was quite simple then, it's sort of cleaner to understand.\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm. One of the great success, obviously, of WMAP is determining with great precision the age of the universe. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the powers to which we can extrapolate in considering cosmic eschatology. In other words, what does this data tell us about how long it will take before the universe to end?\n\nSpergel:\n\nWe know that the geometry of the universe is close to flat, so then its future is governed by the properties of the dark energy. If the dark energy is a vacuum energy, the universe will expand forever in accelerating pace. It will get emptier and emptier. It will be a universe that ends in ice.\n\nIf we look back to the very early history of the universe, the universe went through a dark-energy driven accelerating phase that we call inflation. It's what generated the fluctuations. The inflation-driven accelerating phase ended with reheating, and the universe became dominated by radiation. We could be going through a similar temporary phase of dark energy driven expansion. The universe could be accelerating today because we have a scalar field trapped in a false vacuum state. It could either tunnel out of a minimum or roll down a hill and exit the false vacuum state. If this happens in our future, then the universe could become dominated by matter and radiation again. Our current dark energy-driven expansion could all be a temporary phase.\n\nHowever, given that the observed equation state of dark energy is very close w = -1 (vacuum energy domination), we can expect to be in the accelerating expansion phase for tens of billions of more years.\n\nThe most dramatic ending would be if the dark energy per unit volume grows with time. This possibility violates the strong energy condition: the vacuum energy just keeps growing and growing. In that case, the universe will be torn apart in a big rip. But even that ending is many billions of years in the future.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd when we're talking about tens of billions of years, it's possible then to anthropomorphize the universe. We might very well be in our teenage years; we might have a lot more ahead of us than we do behind us?\n\nSpergel:\n\nI think that's likely true, then.\n\nZierler:\n\nDavid, obviously, the outside world got to understand the enormous success of WMAP through all of the incredible awards that were bestowed on the primary researchers and the collaboration as a whole, but from the inside, when did you and your team really know how special this project was, when did that happen?\n\nSpergel:\n\nYou know, it didn't—the lead up to the launch, we had a sense that if things worked well that we would be able to m"
