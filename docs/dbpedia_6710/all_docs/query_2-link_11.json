        "text": "THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES\n\nAdvisers to the Nation on Science, Engineering, and Medicine\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general welfare. Upon the authority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Academy has a mandate that requires it to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone is president of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under the charter of the National Academy of Sciences, as a parallel organization of outstanding engineers. It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members, sharing with the National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal government. The National Academy of Engineering also sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research, and recognizes the superior achievements of engineers. Dr. Charles M. Vest is president of the National Academy of Engineering.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences to secure the services of eminent members of appropriate professions in the examination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public. The Institute acts under the responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its congressional charter to be an adviser to the federal government and, upon its own initiative, to identify issues of medical care, research, and education. Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg is president of the Institute of Medicine.\n\nThe National Research Council was organized by the National Academy of Sciences in 1916 to associate the broad community of science and technology with the Academy’s purposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal government. Functioning in accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the Council has become the principal operating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to the government, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities. The Council is administered jointly by both Academies and the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone and Dr. Charles M. Vest are chair and vice chair, respectively, of the National Research Council.\n\nwww.national-academies.org\n\nPreface\n\nThis volume contains the reports of the five Astro2010 Science Frontiers Panels (SFPs) and the four Astro2010 Program Prioritization Panels (PPPs). These panels were appointed by the National Research Council (NRC) to assist the Committee for a Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics in surveying the field of space- and ground-based astronomy and astrophysics and identifying promising areas of research in the coming decade, taking into consideration both new and previously identified concepts. The tasks assigned to the SFPs and PPPs are outlined in Appendix A. This volume also reflects the work of six Infrastructure Study Groups (ISGs) whose members were appointed by the NRC’s Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences to gather and analyze data on issues related to several broad topics. The results of the work of the three groups—the SFPs, PPPs, and ISGs—were advisory to the survey committee, whose task was to recommend priorities for the most important scientific and technical activities in astronomy and astrophysics for the decade 2010-2020.1 The survey committee’s recommendations are presented in a separate volume, New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics (The National Academies Press, Washington, D.C., 2010).\n\nThe survey was conducted in two overlapping phases. In the first phase, the five SFPs worked to identify science themes that define the research frontiers for the 2010-2020 decade in five areas: Cosmology and Fundamental Physics, the Galactic Neighborhood, Galaxies Across Cosmic Time, Planetary Systems and Star\n\nFormation, and Stars and Stellar Evolution. Drawing on the 324 white papers on science opportunities submitted to the NRC in response to an open call from the survey committee to the astronomy and astrophysics research community,2 as well as on briefings received from federal agencies that provide support for the field, the SFPs strove to identify the scientific drivers of the field and the most promising opportunities for progress in research in the next decade, taking into consideration those areas where the technical means and the theoretical foundations are in place for major steps forward. The SFPs were instructed to avoid advocacy for prioritization of specific new missions, telescopes, and other research activities. They also worked ahead of and therefore independent of the PPPs. As delineated in Chapters 1 through 5 of this volume, the input of each of the SFPs to the survey committee was organized by four science questions ripe for answering and general areas with unusual discovery potential.\n\nIn the second phase of the survey, the PPPs were charged to develop a ranked program of research activities in four programmatic areas: Electromagnetic Observations from Space; Optical and Infrared Astronomy from the Ground; Particle Astrophysics and Gravitation; and Radio, Millimeter, and Submillimeter Astronomy from the Ground. In addition to the draft science questions and discovery areas received from the SFP chairs at a joint meeting held in May 2009, the PPPs also reviewed the more than 100 proposals for research activities presented by the astronomy and astrophysics community for consideration by the survey.3 In addition the PPPs received briefings from federal agencies, project proponents, and other stakeholders at public sessions held in June 2009 at the summer meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Pasadena, California. In their final assembly of priorities the PPPs also took into account assessments of cost and schedule risk, and of the technical readiness of the research activities under consideration for prioritization, that were provided by an NRC-hired contractor, the Aerospace Corporation. As presented in Chapters 6 through 9 of this volume, each PPP report contains a proposed program of prioritized, balanced, and integrated research activities, reflecting the results of its in-depth study of the technical and programmatic issues and its consideration of the results of the independent technical evaluation and cost and schedule risk estimate. The survey committee received draft reports of the PPPs’ input on proposed programs at its fourth committee meeting in October 2009.\n\nThe SFPs and the PPPs conducted their work independent of each other, although coordinating calls among the panel chairs were held frequently. No members of the panels served on the survey committee, but the panel chairs did attend\n\nall but the final committee meeting, and liaisons from the committee attended panel meetings.\n\nThe six Infrastructure Study Groups that also provided input for the survey committee’s consideration consisted of 71 volunteer consultants drawn for the most part from the astronomy and astrophysics community. These groups gathered and analyzed data on issues in six areas—Computation, Simulation, and Data Handling (including archiving of astronomical data); Demographics (encompassing astronomers and astrophysicists working in different environments and subfields); Facilities, Funding, and Programs (including infrastructure issues such as support for laboratory astrophysics and technology development and theory); International and Private Partnerships; Education and Public Outreach; and Astronomy and Public Policy (benefits to the nation that accrue from federal investment in astronomy and from the potential contributions that professional astronomers can make to research of societal importance, and mechanisms by which the astronomy community provides advice to the federal government)—to describe recent trends and past quantifiable impacts on research programs in astronomy and astrophysics. The ISGs provided preliminary reports to the survey committee and the PPPs at the May 2009 so-called jamboree meeting, and their final reports were completed by the fall of 2009.\n\nIt then became the task of the survey committee to integrate the inputs from the SFPs and the PPPs, along with that from the ISGs, into a recommended program for all of astronomy and astrophysics for the decade 2010-2020.\n\nThe five SFPs, four PPPs, and six ISGs were critical components of the survey, not only for the content and critical analysis they supplied but also because of the connections they provided to the astronomy and astrophysics community. Moreover the panels completed a Herculean set of tasks in an extraordinarily short time. As presented in this volume, the results of their efforts were essential to the deliberations of the survey committee, the success of whose work depended critically on the sequential and orderly flow of information from the SFPs to the PPPs, and then to the committee as provided for in the survey plan and structure.\n\nIn addition, the survey as a whole benefited immensely from the broader participation of the astronomy and astrophysics community, which, over the course of the study and in particular in the first half of 2009, undertook a massive effort to provide input to the survey process. Included were informal reports from 17 community town hall meetings, more than 20 unsolicited e-mails, and 90-plus notices of interest for project activities, in addition to more than 450 white papers on topics including science opportunities, the state of the profession and infrastructure, and opportunities in technology development, theory, computation, and laboratory astrophysics. Critical to the success of the nine panels’ and six study groups’ work, these inputs were also an early product of the survey in that the white papers and various reports were made available on the NRC Web pages. On behalf of the survey\n\ncommittee and the panels, sincere thanks are extended to the volunteers from the research community who gave so much of their time to formulate this backbone of information and data as input for the Astro2010 survey process.\n\nThe survey committee also acknowledges with heartfelt thanks the critical input represented by the material provided in this volume. The reports of the SFPs and the PPPs stand as a testament to the hard work done by the panels, and especially their chairs. The full value of this tremendous effort will be recognized through the decade to come. The survey committee and the entire field of astronomy and astrophysics owe a great deal of thanks to all those who dedicated their time and effort to the Astro2010 survey activities.\n\nRoger D. Blandford, Chair\n\nCommittee for a Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics"
