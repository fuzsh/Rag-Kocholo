Research Associate, University of Maryland 8/01-Pres. See http://www.astro.umd.edu/~rauch/research/. Davis Postdoctoral Fellow, Johns Hopkins University 9/99-7/01 Developed a comprehensive package for numerical integration of hierarchical N-body systems using symplectic methods with Doug Hamilton. Expanded a subroutine library for tracing arbitrary geodesics in the Kerr metric, and examined the visual appearance of black hole accretion disks. Research Associate, University of Maryland 9/97-8/99 Investigated the stability properties of symplectic integrators applied to nearly-Keplerian problems in collaboration with Matt Holman; completed additional work on the dynamics of black holes in galactic nuclei. Postdoctoral Fellow, Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics 10/94-8/97 Worked with Scott Tremaine on resonant relaxation and pursued additional research on the dynamics of galactic nuclei. Graduate Student, California Institute of Technology 8/90-8/94 Undertook research with Roger Blandford on topics in gravitational microlensing, accretion disks, and active galactic nucleus dynamics and emission. Thesis topic: ``Black Holes and Accretion Disks in Active Galactic Nuclei: Microlensing, Caustics, and Collisional Stellar Dynamics'' Senior Research Project, Princeton University 1990 Published an undergraduate senior thesis on the possibility of limiting the cosmological density of compact dark matter objects through microlensing effects on distant supernovae (advisor: Bohdan Paczynski). Research Assistant, Cornell University 6/89-8/89 Worked with James Cordes on the feasibility of using interstellar scintillation data to constrain the size of pulsar magnetospheres, under the auspices of the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates program. Junior Term Projects, Princeton University 9/88-5/89 Completed two undergraduate term projects; one analyzed CCD photometry of the gravitational lens Q2237+0305 to test for microlensing-induced brightness variations among the images (advisor: Ed Turner); the other studied the consequences of a non-zero Î› cosmological model for the redshift distribution of quasars and the strength of the UV background (advisor: Jerry Ostriker).
