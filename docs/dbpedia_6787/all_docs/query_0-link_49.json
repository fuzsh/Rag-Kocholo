Namboodiripad is also close to Perinthalmanna.\n\nCurrent statistics\n\nLand Area: 34.41 kmÂ²\n\nPopulation 1991 Census: 39027\n\nKerala Assembly Constituency\n\nOrigin of the name\n\nEtymologically, Perinthalmanna derives its name from a Malayalam word perinthallu, which literally means big, rigorous fighting. The traditions associated with this ancient town state that in the olden days, sporting events, including martial activities, were organized under the leadership of Kakooth Nair, the commander-in-chief of Valluvakkonathiri. These sporting events were organized before Angadipuram Thirumandhamkunnu Temple (See below) festival, which was celebrated after harvesting of crops in the month of Makara, corresponding to the months of January/February) of the gregorian calendar. Another main event organized used to be Aattakalam or the stage for Kathakali performance. People from a cross section of the society participated in these festivities, and everyone wanted to see the place were the Perinthallu (that is, the rigorous fighting) took place (a place situated to the east of Angadipuram), which became known as Perinthallu, and got modified to its present form of Perinthalmanna under British influence.\n\nHistoric Perinthalmanna\n\nIn the olden days Valluvanad was an independent princely state. The ruler of Valluvanad was a witness during the offering of the title deed by king Veeraraghava in 1320. After the death of Cheraman Perumal(1320-1342) Kerala was divided among the rulers of Thiruvithamcoore, Kochi, Kolothunaadu, Kurumbanadu and Valluvanad states. The post of the ruler of Valluvanad was known as Valluvakkonathiri. The eldest member of Ayirazhi- Kadannamanna-aripra 'Kovilakam' became the Valluvakkonathiri. At first the capital of Valluvanad was Kuruvaand and later Angadipuram became the capital. As it was the land ruled by the Valluvakkonathiri it came to be known as Valluanad. Even at that time Perinthalmanna was considered to be the main center of Valluvanad. Both Perinthalmanna province and Angadipuram province were together known as Angadipuram. In the past The Perinthalmanna High School was known as Angadipuram Elementary School. Even the police station was known as Angadipuram Police Station.\n\nBritish period\n\nBackground\n\nFrom 1835 until late 19th century, violent disturbances surfaced from time to time in different parts of Malabar region, particularly in Eranad and Valluvanad, and the adjoining areas, which included Perinthalmanna. These disturbances and uprisings were basically agrarian unrest. After these disturbances subsided, relative peace returned to large areas currently comprising the state of Kerala. Malabar came under the direct administrative control of the British raj, and was made a part of the Madras Presidency.\n\nThe neutrality of this article is disputed.\n\nPlease see the discussion on the talk page. (December 2007)\n\nPlease do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved.\n\nMappila rebellion\n\nIn 1921, Mappila rebellion, also known as Mopla riots occurred. These incidents also affected Valluvanad. There were large scale religious violence and riots in different parts of valluvanad, followed by large scale exodus of people from the riot affected areas.\n\nAn investigation carried out by Sir Logan, the-then Collector and District Magistrate of Wygram found that the report given by Sir Steinch stating that riots were the out come of religious fanaticism was wrong. Sir Logan was appointed as a special officer to investigate into the matter and whether the complaint that the landlords did not give land to construct mosques is true or not. The report submitted by Sir Logan stated that the Muslims considered it to be a religious right to take arms against the landlords who maltreated the tenants and the government which supported such landlords[citation needed].\n\nAt that time, a notable incident that rocked Valluvanad was looting of the government treasury by the rioters, and some reports state that even currency notes, looted from the treasury, were found scattered on the roads. Even though these rumors instigated violence in Eranad and many other parts of Valluvanad, the residents of Perinthalmanna had to a certain extent refrained themselves from indulging in violence. The main reason for this is the social and cultural amity that existed in Perinthalmanna.\n\nLocal self governance\n\nPerinthalmanna was at first under Malappuram Taluk board and then under valluvanad Taluk board. This place became a Panchayath in 1933, and the Panchayath office was situated in the building where the lower primary school functioned. The first Panchayath president was P. Achuthan Menon. According to the local bodies Act, Panchayath president was selected by organizing a public meeting and raising the hands to show the support for each member. All the executive powers were vested on the Panchayath president.\n\nTourist spots\n\nKulirmala : This hill which lies close to Perinthalmanna town in the highest point from where we can get a glimpse of the whole town and the neighboring places.
