        "text": "With their epicurean life-style a thing of the past, the priestly community has taken to scrounging for a living. Along with affluence, some traditions like the teaching of the Vedas are also on the decline.\n\nMemories of another day haunt 67-year-old Parvati Namboodiri of Trichur. Once her family owned 100-odd acres of paddy-rich land. Today, left with a paltry three acres and no cash to cultivate even that, they are forced to scrounge to make both ends meet."
