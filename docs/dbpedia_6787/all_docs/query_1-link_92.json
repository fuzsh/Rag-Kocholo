The Chera kingdom was one of the three major Tamil kingdoms that ruled over most of Kerala and Tamil Nadu from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE¹². Muziris was a hub of trade and commerce, and had contacts with various civilizations, such as the Romans, the Greeks, the Persians, the Arabs, and the Chinese¹². Muziris was also a centre of culture and religion, and had temples, churches, synagogues, and mosques. Muziris declined after a flood in the 14th century CE². +Raja Rama Varma was the ruler of Cochin kingdom from 1790 to 1805. He was also known as Sakthan Thampuran, which means \"powerful lord\" in Malayalam. He was a visionary and a reformer, who made Thrissur his capital, and fortified it with walls and gates. He also promoted arts, culture, trade, and education in Thrissur. He is regarded as the founder of modern Thrissur². He was born in 1751 and died in 1805². Some of the notable events that took place during his rule were: - The Treaty of Seringapatam (1792), which ended the Third Anglo-Mysore War and ceded some territories of Cochin to the British East India Company². - The Treaty of Mangalore (1799), which ended the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and resulted in the death of Tipu Sultan². - The establishment of St. Thomas College (1889), which is one of the oldest colleges in Kerala². +The Temple Entry Proclamation was a decree issued by Maharaja Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma of Travancore in 1936, which allowed people of all castes to enter Hindu temples in Travancore. This was a revolutionary step that challenged the centuries-old practice of caste discrimination and untouchability in Kerala. The proclamation was influenced by social reformers like Narayana Guru and Ayyankali, and was supported by Mahatma Gandhi²⁴. +The Aikya Kerala Movement was a political movement that demanded a united Kerala state for all Malayalam-speaking people. It started in 1947 after India's independence, when Kerala was divided into three regions: Travancore-Cochin, Malabar District, and South Canara District. The movement was led by various political parties and leaders, such as E.M.S. Namboodiripad, K. Kelappan, Mannathu Padmanabhan, C.Kesavan etc. The movement succeeded in 1956 when Kerala state was formed by merging Travancore-Cochin with Malabar District and Kasaragod taluk of South Canara District²⁴."
