        "text": "This article interrogates the way in which the ‘state’ was imagined in Calcutta of the 1890s. Using a rare pamphlet of municipal sanitary propaganda written in the form of a drama, the article reveals a radically different vision of the state than the one available in the extant historiography. In this vernacular imagination of the state, the abstract institutional realities are recast as specific embodied hierarchies and exclusions. Since the text concerned was one intended for public propaganda, such a vision could neither be an idiosyncratic vision of an individual, nor could it be described as the ‘popular understanding’ of the state. Instead, as a piece of governmental propaganda that was presented as a drama, it had to be both the state's vision of itself and what it thought people usually thought it to be. The text thus becomes a window into what might be called a ‘vernacular state’, i.e. the state as it exists and sees itself existing in everyday contexts. The stark lines between ‘state’ and ‘society’ become blurred and reorganized in this vision of a vernacular state. The two key features that define the vernacular state are a simplified hierarchy of levels and its embodiment in bhadralok officials. The latter in turn signals a convergence between bhadralok authority and state interests and a consequent marginalization of subaltern citizens. Scholarly interest in the everydayness of the state is growing, but where this article seeks to add to that interest is by highlighting the issue of embodiment of the state's authority.\n\nLooking at the recent paradigms which are essentially based on giving voices to the marginal who are generally looked upon as ‘the other,’ this paper attempts to build upon the relationship between “the self,” “the other” and “the state.” Every society is based on certain norms, rules, customs and tradition. These social norms are based on the ‘politics of inclusion and exclusion.’ So if there are certain factions of peoples who are included in the social structures of a society, there are also certain sections of people who are excluded in those same social structures. Thus, we come across the ‘social divide.’ This ‘social divide’ is created, propagated and continued through generations. This paper attempts to delineate the origin of this ‘social divide’ which begins within a person as an individual develops social, cultural, religious, regional, gender, and political consciousness. The individual and civic consciousness is marred by these overlapping consciousness. Ambedkar tried to bridge this gap between “the self” and “the other,” between “civic consciousness” and other consciousness by offering a political solution for the “social divide” which he sought through the intervention of the state. The paper attempts to uncover the complex ties that exists between the individual and the state and which affects its relationship with the other.\n\nThis paper treats the Malayalam film Mukhamukham and the debates it engendered in the Kerala public sphere about the history and legacy of communism as an archive of passions and disavowals that have shaped the political subjectivities in contemporary Kerala and explores how the film offers a critique of the Left popular in Kerala. Through a critique of the ascetic modality of the communist hero, Mukhamukham offers a critique of the representative strategies through which the communist hero was produced in the early Left political melodramas in Malayalam, which have been a significant part of the Left’s constitutive role in the construction of the domain of the popular in Kerala. The attempt in this paper is to read the film as one that, while marked by liberal prejudices, offers a critique of the Left popular and certain prevailing notions on the Left in Kerala. The paper explores how the film represents the figure of the revolutionary; and the shift from the melodramatic conventio...\n\nThe concept of ‘Malaya’ continues to exert a powerful draw on our imagination, steeped in exotism and Orientalist reductions. Even decades after the end of the colonial period, it casts a long shadow over modern-day Malaysia and the rest of maritime Southeast Asia. How can we understand this constantly transforming subjectivity? Most importantly, how do we recognise the continuation of problems inherited from colonisation, and overcome these distorted discourses? Revisiting Malaya seeks to explicitly address these problems, taking regional Cold War divisions and historical links and fractures into consideration. By considering a wide range of topics presented by speakers at two landmark conferences, from the propaganda efforts of the Malayan Film Unit to the visionary writings of visionaries and revolutionaries, ranging from Usman Awang to Tan Malaka, this book uses ‘Malaya as method’ to better understand historical and contemporary realities.\n\nThere has been a peculiar habit with social discourse which has separated thought from practice as if to suggest that reflection and action are incompatible processes in the public sphere. Somehow intellectual work is characterized as pedantic and that productive action is all that matters. This particular piece attempts principally to debunk such rather limiting views of the public realm by exploring questions of praxis as issues of the public sphere. It chooses to argue that all intellectual work is productive work, and that all practice is fundamentally intellectual. For this purpose, this exploration will locate intellectual work using Jurgen Habermas’ conception of the “Public Sphere”; configure the intellectual as represented by Antonio Gramsci, Michel Foucault and Edward Said; and depict the identities of M K Gandhi and BR Ambedkar as “Indian” intellectuals who have transformed our society productively. In the process, this article will also examine the caste debates between Gandhi and Ambedkar in order to explain its relevance and significance in the contemporary social sphere. This article therefore endeavors to locate both praxis and the public sphere and the roles of Ambedkar and Gandhi in the caste debates as central to an understanding of the native intellectual in the public space today.\n\nCommunism arrived in the south Indian state of Kerala in the early twentieth century at a time when the matrilineal systems that governed caste-Hindu relations were crumbling quickly. For a large part of the twentieth century, the Communist Party – specifically the Communist Party of India (Marxist) – played a major role in navigating Kerala society through a developmental path based on equality, justice and solidarity. Following Lefebvre’s conceptualisation of (social) space, this paper explores how informal social spaces played an important role in communicating ideas of communism and socialism to the masses. Early communists used rural libraries and reading rooms, tea-shops, public grounds and wall-art to engage with and communicate communism to the masses. What can the efforts of the early communists in Kerala tell us about the potential for communicative socialism? How can we adapt these experiences in the twenty-first century? Using autobiographies, memoirs, and personal interviews, this paper addresses these questions.\n\nMy paper takes into consideration Neel Mukherjee's The Lives of Others as an opportunity to interrogate the effects of the timeserving practices of leading political parties in India during the first decades following the Partition separating India and Pakistan. They were made possible by the instrumental employment of military forces following an internal reorganisation in the '50s and '60s. The then young Indian state de facto deprived tribals of their lands for profit with the com- plicity of the police and the military, whose repressive force was em- ployed not only to repress and stifle any form of dissent or protest, but also to \"creatively\" produce normative discourses which represented a constant threat to national growth and development. By blurring the line between truth and fantasy, the military decisively contributed to the symbolic binding of tribals to an imaginary of fear which proved instrumental to the emergence of the \"modernity\" of the nation-state. From this perspective, Mukherjee's novel highlights how such biased forms of knowledge traversed the different networks composing the social body in its entirety."
