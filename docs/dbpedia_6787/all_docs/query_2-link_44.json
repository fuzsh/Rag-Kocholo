        "text": "Given that he was from a Brahmin family, his education began from Sanskrit scriptures and he started right at the top, from the Rig Veda, the book of the Aryans. Later he went to the community school started by the social-reform society Namboothiri Yogakshema Sabha. This Sabha was an advocate of modern education, one that criticised the caste system and its various injustices.\n\nTwo years later he joined the Congress Socialist Party to serve his nation from a position of power. He could not, however, relate very well with the ideas of the party.\n\nOnce inside, he quickly rose to prominence and played an important role in setting the party doctrines and giving an ideal role and shape to the politics of Kerala.\n\nBe it the high literacy rates, the increased salaries of civil employees, or the perfect sex ratio, it was all Namboodiripad and his 28 months as CM!"
