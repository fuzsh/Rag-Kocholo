        "text": "________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHistory of KERALA (CHERA Kingdom).\n\nLEGEND\n\nThe mother-country of Travancore was the Mandala kingdom Chera. The present day Travancore (19th Century) with an area of 6653.5 sq. miles is situated between the 8th and 10th degree of North latitude. Travancore was strongly protected by natural boundaries, the south and west by the Indian Ocean, the east by the range of high ghats, and the northern parts being mostly covered with backwaters, rivers and lakes. The situation of Travancore being unfavourable for the march of horses and elephants that formed the best portion of an army in those days saved it from incursions of foreign invaders.\n\nFrom its original state as Chera Mandalam, the largest of the three Mandala kingdoms covering the best portion of Southern India, it was reduced to a small province bounded by Canara, Coimbatore, Tinnevelly and the Indian Ocean. Subsequently it flourished under its present name Travancore and continued as a vassal state to the Rayers of Vijayanagar, when Viswanatha Naicker assumed the government of Madura. Under the Rayer dynasty, Travancore was still reduced and humiliated by being degraded to the low position of a feudatory chief. During the rule of Thirumali Naicker of Madura, the Malayalam Nanjenaud Rajah (King of Travancore) was included among the seventy two feudal chiefs to guard the bastions of the Pandian capital. From the position of a feudal State, Travancore rose again, slowly but surely, and recovered many of its lost possessions, both in the east and in the north.\n\nFrom the 3rd century A.D, to the 7th century A.D appears to have been the most flourishing period in modern history of the Chera kingdom. It then extended over the present Mysore, Coimbatore, Salem, South Malabar and Cochin. It was one of the three great old Dravidian kingdoms and already existed in the 3rd century B.C.\n\nThe Puranas describe the origin, in the Kirti Yugam (the first age) of three contemporary kings in South India called Cheran, Cholan and Pandyan, who ruled over three countries called after their names; Chera Mandalam, Chola Mandalam and Pandya Mandalam. These kings were brothers and were Soma Vamsa Kshatrias.\n\nThe Kshatrias are of two classes, namely, the Soorya Vamsa and the Soma Vamsa. The Hindu Chronology divides the age of the world into four Yugams (Periods). Kirti Yugam equals 4800 years, Theertha Yugam equals 3600 years, Dwapara Yugam equals 2400 years and Kali Yugam equals 1200 years. The whole being equivalent to 12,000 years.\n\nIn the Kirti Yugam two races of Kshatriyas were begotten; one from the sun and the other from the moon, on whom the administration of the whole earth originally fell. The mode of Government from the earliest times was that any king on becoming more powerful than all the others conquered them and declared himself Emperor. So also we have instances of Southern kingdoms of Pandya, Chola and Chera being ruled alternately by one among themselves as Emperor.\n\nIn Theertha Yugam (the second age), Kerala is said to have been recovered from the sea by Parasu Rama, the sixth incarnation of Vishnu. There are several versions, but the gist is almost the same. Parusu Rama flung his axe from Gokurnam and it fell at Cape Comorin, whereupon the sea receded from these two points to the present extend of the Malabar Coast and he called it Keralam. A large portion of the land between Kollam and Mangalapuram remained uncultivated during the reign of the Chera king Keralan, when the Bhramin warrior Parusu Rama visited the land of Keralam, established himself there. He organised a Brahmin community, introduced new system of Government, lived there for a considerable period of time and then retired.\n\nThe land between Gokurnam and Kannya Kumari have been submerged under the ocean at one time in the Theerth Yugam (the second age). The low-lands of the Malabar Coast have been raised from beneath the sea by subterranean forces.\n\nParusu Rama was born in the Theertha Yugam. He is the descendant of the renowned Rishi Bhrigu. Jamadagni and Renuka had five sons of whom the youngest was Parasu Rama. When Rama was a minor, one day Jamadagni left to procure things for his devotional services, while Renuka went to bring water from the nearby river Nurbuda. Renuka was distracted by seeing the beautiful reflection of a Gandharvan (Genii) called Chithrangaden, passing through the air. When Jamadagni returned he could not find his wife as usual. So when Renuka returned and on being questioned she confessed that she was delayed by seeing the beauty of Chithrangaden. The enraged Rishi asked each of his sons to kill their mother, but four of them refused on the plea that law prohibits killing of a womn and also that the woman was their mother. But Rama on being ordered immediately obeyed. The father pleased, asked Rama for any boon. Rama wished for his mother to be restored to life, which the father granted.\n\nSubsequently, Rama was sent to his great-grand father Brigu, to be educated in the Vedas and other literature. After completing his education he went to the Himalayas to meditate to Siva. This pleased Siva and he granted Rama all sorts of blessings and directed him to visit all the holy places on earth. Rama after his pilgrimage resumed his meditation in the Himalayas. It was during this time that a war broke out between the Devas and the Asuras, which the Asuras won. The Devas driven out of heaven appealed to Siva for help. Siva summoned Rama and asked him to help the Devas. Siva presented Rama with an axe called Parasu. From that day onwards he was known as Parasu Rama. He proceeded to war with the Asuras and gained a decisive victory. The Devas and Siva were extremely pleased with Parasu Rama and conferred on him the choicest blessings. Parasu Rama again repaired to the Himalayas for meditation. Siva, extremely pleased with Parasu Rama, paid him a visit and presented him with a supernatural chariot and an arrow which were to appear before him whenever he wished them. Parasu Rama then left the Himalayas and came to his great-grand father Brigu and spend time with him before returning to his parents’ home.\n\nKarthaveerarjuna, the king of Hehaya, on a hunting expedition entered the Jamadagni hermitage for a little refreshment. He took a fancy to the Rishi’s cow Kamadhenu. Jamadagni on refusing to part with the cow at any cost was beset by the king’s soldiers and left for dead. Parasu Rama on returning and seeing his father’s mutilated body was mortified. Brigu divining the state of affairs immediately repaired to the scene and on careful examination found that life was not extinct and with the aid of certain medicines restored life to Jamadagni. Parasu Rama went to the king Karthaveerarjuna and asked him to restore the cow and seek the pardon of the venerable sage. The king refused and in the ensuing battle the king was defeated and slain. The five sons of the king met Rama in battle and when they were about to fall victims to Rama’s Parasu, lay down their weapons and sought Rama’s pardon. They gave up the cow and made full reparation for the wrongs done by their father. Parashu Rama retired to the Himalayas and resumed his meditation. In his absence, the then reigning king, one of the sons of the late king Karthaveera of Hehaya, happened to pass by the hermitage of Jamadagni. On learning whose property it was, the king sword in hand entered the hermitage and decapitated Jamadagni with one blow. Renuka also perished on the funeral pyre. Sometime afterwards, Parasu Rama returned from the Himalayas and learning the fate of his parents, set out for the kingdom of Hehayas. He vowed to destroy all the Kshatriya kings. After going one round and finishing his work of destruction, he retired to the Himalayas to do penance. He repeated these deeds twenty one times. He then retired to the Mahendra hills to meditate. Kasyapa and other Rishies visited him there and advised him the best means for expiation for the sin of killing his mother and the Kshatriya race was to give up the whole of the conquered lands to the Brahmans. After which Parasu Rama passed many ages doing penance in a grotto in the Mahendra hills.\n\nDuring the interval, certain peculiar circumstances occurred which caused a sudden rise of the ocean, and the sacred shrine of Gokurnan, together several other remarkable shrines on the coast were submerged in the ocean. The Rishies interested in these sacred places sought Parasu Rama’s help. Rama came to Gokurnam and after making arrangements with Varuna, the God of the sea, flung his wooden spoon thus causing the sea to recede from Gokurnam to Cape Comorin.\n\nParusu Rama then invited the Brahmins, who having received grants of lands were located in sixty four gramams. He invited other castes also from foreign countries to occupy his new land. He restored the sovereignty of the original Chera, and after living on the coast for a long time, retired to his grotto on the Mahendra hills, where he is supposed to be still living.\n\nThe time occupied in establishing Keralam and as well as the period of Parusu Rama’s abode in land according to Kerala Ulppathy is fifty thousand years. According to details in Kerala Mahatmyam, Parusu Rama invited Brahmins from the north to settle in the country which he divided into 64 gramams and named Bhanu Vicrama as King over his land of Keralam (from Cape Comorin to Gokurnam). A gold coin, called Rasi, was then minted and made currency throughout his dominions. In ‘Valmiki Ramayanam’ we find that the emissaries of Rama were ordered to search for Seetha in Keralam also. We have now come to the end of the second age (Thretha Yugam).\n\nIn the third age, ‘Dwapara Yugam’ the king of Kerala is often mentioned in ‘Maha Bharatha’. The king of Kerala was one of the tributaries of Emperor Yudhishtira, and during the Great War, the Kerala king fought on the side of the Pandavas and died in the war. It is also said that the Pandavas, during their secret wanderings, visited Thiruvananthapuram and made several vows to the deity Padmanabha Swamy. During his pilgrimage Arjuna visited Madura, where he married the daughter of the Pandyan king, and by her had a son named Bebhruvahanen. On his way to Dwaraka, Arjuna visited Cape Comorin and Thiruvananthapuram and is generally believed to have consecrated a temple dedicated to Goddess Durga on the banks of a tank, which is still called Phalgunan Kulam (Arjuna’s tank).\n\nIn the fourth age (Kali Yugam) India was under the rule of Emperor Yudhistira, which is said to have ended in the 36th year of the Kali Yugam. Up to the tenth century of the Kali Yugam, 48 kings reigned over Chera kingdom. In the 1860th year of Kaliyugam there was born at Thiruvanjikolam, one of the most celebrated of the Chera Kings, Kulasekhara Perumal, who was installed as king when he passed his minority. His father was Kshatriya Dhrida Vritha Maha Rajah.\n\nIn our continuing researches, we find that the rule of Vicramadithya is said to have ended in 3179th year of the Kali Yugam. In the Bhavishyat Purana, it was predicted that Vicramadithya will be born one thousand years after the commencement of the Kali Yugam. He will live and rule, by divine blessing for 2000 years; that Dheera Kerala Vurmah, king of Keralam will be a contemporary of Vicramadithya and that the king will rule Keralam with great vigour and success. Now from this prediction we may conclude that Vicramadithya was born in the 1179th year of Kali Yugam and there were kings of Chera during the reign of that great monarch.\n\nOf the Pandyan kings who ruled Madura hundreds of years subsequent to the reign of Vicramadithya, Salivahana and Bhoja, had jurisdiction over Chera and Chola kings and that ‘Veera Vurmah Pandyan’ inherited the Pandyan kingdom and reigned forty years. He conquered Malayalam (Chera) country and other places and derived tribute from them. Thus we have come down to above 4000 years in the Kali Yugam.\n\nThough there were continual feuds between Chola and Chera, and occasional misunderstandings, and quarrels with the Pandya kingdom, Chera appears to have been of peaceable disposition and during any great struggle, retired to his Kerala possessions, which always afforded him an asylum from its peculiar position. It is seen that the Malayalam country afforded an asylum to the Pandyan king whenever his kingdom was invaded by his enemies.\n\nEARLY HISTORY\n\nThe Chera dynasty continued in power, though constantly engaged in warfare with its neighbours Pandya and Chola, till central Chera was overrun by the Konga Rajahs. The original dynasty of Chera finally retreated to its southern possessions and joined the family residing in the south (Travancore). In the 13th and 14th centuries Konga kings Narasinha II (1237-1278) and Hari Hara Raya, (1367-1391) exacted tribute from Chera kings. The remnant of the Chera kingdom extended up to Mysore frontier on the north, the district of Salem on the east, the Travancore coast up to Calicut on the North West. This kingdom of Chera is generally recognised as Kerala or Travancore. It must have been at this period that the old Chera was finally incorporated with Travancore and its original name Chera forgotten. This area was again reduced by their conquest by the Madura rulers and from them by the Carnatic Nabob.\n\nIt would appear that after the retirement of Parasu Rama from Keralam, the Brahmins rose to power, shook off the yolk of the Kerala kings and commenced their own rule within the limits of their 64 gramams. In the first century BC, the people of the 64 gramams convened a congress and after holding a consultation, resolved to establish four divisions of their gramams called Kalakams which division they denominated; Parinchaloor, Payennoor, Parppoor and Chenganiyoor respectively. Thus, the Brahmanical possession within the gramams was ruled for a very long time. But owing to dissention amongst them, anarchy and misrule prevailed. The Brahmins again resolved to have a president called Rakshapumshen, appointed to each of these four kalakams for a term of three years. This form of rule continued for a considerably long period, and these presidents who were also called numpies (trustees), were paid at the rate of one sixth of the produce of the land. But considering that they had each only three year’s tenure of office they availed themselves of their position to amass wealth for themselves and thus brought on ruinous results. The Brahmin community finally resolved to introduce a system of elective government and to appoint ruler for a term of twelve years but disputes having arisen at the election, they at last determined to apply to the king Cheran (Keralan) and so proceeded to Ceyapuram (Coimbatore) and brought from there a viceroy called Ceya Perumal to Keralam. The name of this perumal was ‘Cheraman Keralan’. The date of his installation have been in the Kali year 3316 (216 AD). It further observes that in all 25 perumals ruled over Keralam. The last finished his rule in Kali year 3528 (428 AD). The Perumal period is 212 years.\n\nIn the days of Parusu Rama and during the sway of the Perumals as Emperors of Keralam, several local chieftains appear to have been nominated to assist him in the administration. The families of these governors of the temples assumed power in course of time and became petty chiefs under the supreme sovereign, the Chera king. The families of these Kshatriyas are called Kovil Adhikarkel or Kovil of whom the Cochin Rajah is one. This Rajah’s caste name is Koviladhikarikal or Kovil. The first Perumal was ‘Cheraman Keralan’ and the last Perumal was Bhaskara Revi Vurmah. The ancient copper plates in the possession of the Syrian Christians of Kottayam and the Jews of Cochin contain grants made by three of the Cheraman Perumals, viz, Sree Veera Ragava Perumal, Sthanu Revi Gupta Perumal and Sree Bhaskara Revi Vurmah Perumal. The Cochin Rajah was the creature of the last Perumal and is said to have been his heir. The Zamorin was also created by the last Perumal who granted him his own sword and two small pieces of ground called Kolikode and Chullicaud, and invested him with regal power giving him the title Kunnala Konathiri (Zamorin).\n\nManigramam is a distinction given to the Syrian Christians by the Perumals, as they were regarded as a class of respectable people. Parusu Rama divided Keralam into 64 Brahmin gramams, each having a particular name. But to the new community of Syrians the second Perumal must have granted a gramam, denominated Manigramam, with the title of a principality. The original settlements of the Syrian community appears to have been at Makothayepatnam near the port of Cranganore and Curakkeni Kollum at Quilon. Tradition states that the Syrians came to this country in two bodies, one party landed near the modern Quilon at a place now engulfed by the sea. The other party at Kodungalore or Maha Devapatnam. Cheraman Perumal assumed his vice regal power in the Kali year 3445 (345 AD). The copper plate document referred to above was executed in the 36th year of his reign in the Kali Year 3481 (381 AD).\n\nThough several rajahs and petty chiefs rose up subsequent to the Perumal period, still the Namboory community maintained its power with the sixty four gramams, but owing to the neglect of devotional observances and religious performances, the prosperity of the community began to decline. At such a period, the great and renowned Vedanthist, Sankara Acharyar was born, which is said to have been half a century before the beginning of the Malayalam year and in the 8th century AD of the Christian era. Sankara Acharyar introduced various improvements amongst the Namboory community of Keralam in modification of the laws and ordinances of Parasu Rama, which are observed by the Brahmins as their religious bye laws. Sankara Acharayar finished his worldly career at the age of thirty two years at Baderikasramam near the Himalayas.\n\nThe Kovil Adhikarikal rose in power and became petty chiefs. These Devaswams became possessed of immense wealth and landed property to which numerous tenants were attached. These tenants became subject to the rules enacted by the trustees, independent of the king, within the limits of their landed property. In every Kovil (pagoda) before the hoisting of the annual festival flag, such tenants who had committed breach of the Devaswam rules were gibbetted. By such arbitrary conduct of the Devaswam people the sovereign power was over shadowed, and the king became indifferent to the mode in which the affairs were administered within the jurisdiction of the Devaswam and Brahmaswam lands. These powers of the Devaswam appear to have continued up to the early part of the eighth century. The rise of the Devswam to power greatly affected the military resources of the king, whose forces are chiefly constituted of the military trained out of the populace.\n\nBy the appointment of Parasu Rama, the king of Travancore and his relative the chief of Kolathnaud, had each 350,000 militia men each. The system of training soldiers by Parasu Rama and followed by the kings of Travancore and Kolathnaud was that every village should maintain its own militia. The name of every male child of the Nairs and others were to be registered as belonging to the militia six months after birth. Fencing and gymnastic schools called Kalery were to be established in every district under certain authorised masters called Gurukals and Asans to educate boys in the art of war. It consisted chiefly of sword exercises, arrow shooting, spear, lance and dagger exercises, wrestling and the use of shield, and the use of several other arts of offences and defence. These master were also required to train them in gymnastic exercises, sword and rope dancing for the entertainment of the public.\n\nTHE MALAYALAM ERA (MALABAR ERA)\n\nFor the command of the militia, trained men were expressly nominated, such as Munnilakaran (one who stands in the front of a company), Cherumanakaren (the one behind or close to the first, ranking perhaps with the present grades Subadar). Over several of these men there were noblemen, with titles of Karthavu (Lord),Kymal (nobleman) and such others like the old Barons and Knights of England. The head of the number of these noblemen was a petty chief of a State called Rajah who had to appear before the king with his levee of fighting men in time of war. The Gurukal had means of livelihood called Virithi, allowed them by the king, which consists of portions of lands. Similar privileges on a larger scale were granted to all the chiefs for maintaining the militia. The Rajahs and chiefs and their nobles were each head of 30,000, 15,000, 10,000, 5,000, and 3000 men of the militia.\n\nThe currency of Keralam was a gold coin called Rasi, first introduced by Parasu Rama. The coin Rasi has been extinct these last few centuries. Travancore minted its coins from the early Kali Yugam, called Kaliyuga Rajen fanam, which coin is not current during the 18th century. The gold fanam closely resembled the Rasi currency. A silver coin called the Chuckram was also issued from the mint from the earliest period.\n\nAfter the period of the Perumals, for the next two or three hundred years there are no precise accounts of the affairs of North Kerala. It was the period of the flourishing dynasties of Kadamba and Chalukya, and northern Kerala had been subject to the supremacy of these powers. During this interval there was an alliance between the Travancore and Kolathnaud Rajahs to repel the invaders of northern Kerala.\n\nIn the Kali year 3831 (731 AD) the Travancore king Veera Marthanda Vurmah performed Hirannya Garbham and Thulapurusha danam and ruled the kingdom for a long time. His nephew succeeded him. This Soveriegh died in the Kali year 3902 (802 AD). He was succeeded by his nephew Udaya Marthanda Vurmah who was educated and a highly accomplished monarch. His rule was prosperous and more remarkable than that of many of his predecessors.\n\nIn the Kali year 3926 (825 AD) when king Udaya Marthanda Vurmah was residing in Kollam, he convened a council of all the learned men of Kerala with the object of introducing a new era. It was resolved to adopt the new era from the first of Chingam of that year (15th August 825 AD), as Kollam year one. This arrangement was approved by all the wise men of the time and every neighbouring country began to adopt the same.\n\nKing Udaya Marthanda Vurmah died in the Kollam year five (830 AD). The names of succeeding kings are not in the records. It was about this period that the combined army of Travancore and Kolathnaud drove out the Vellalas from Kerala. Subsequently the kings reverted to the enjoyment of their respective possessions. On northern Kerala being cleared of the outsiders, the local chieftains began to rise and much fighting among them resulted. The descendants of the Eradi whom Perumal called Kunnala Konathiri now rose up and with the assistance of the Arabs conquered almost all of the northern chiefs, acquired large territories between Ponnani and northern Keralam and established himself as a powerful monarch.\n\nThe Cochin Rajah being considered the legitimate heir to the Perumal rose in the estimation of the people, especially of the Syrian community, who were rich and very influential, some of them being merchants carrying on business between Kodungalore and Quilon, and greatly attached to the chief ever since the end of Perumal rule. In the course of a few years the Cochin Rajah also became a great power. The then reigning king of Travancore being of a quiet and peaceable disposition, the ascendancy of Cochin was easily established. Hence the king of Travancore lost his sovereignty over almost all his northern possessions. The boundaries lay between Edavaye near Vurkalay in the north, Eratta Malay (eastern side of Udayagherry) in the south, to a distance of 70 miles in length and 20 miles in breadth. Nanjenaud and all other southern possessions have been taken over by the Pandyan king. This little country was ruled without and disturbances, either externally or internally, for a long period.\n\nTHE MIDDLE AGES\n\nIn the Kollam year 225 (1050 AD) the ancient pagoda at Trivandrum was rebuilt by a Travancore sovereign, whose name is not known. About this period, the Pandyan kingdom was invaded by the Mahommedans and the reigning king Paracarma Pandyan was taken prisoner and sent to Delhi. On this occasion the tutelary God of Madura was taken to Travancore for better security. The Travancore king showed no ill will to the Pandyans for appropriating territories of Travancore earlier. During the Mahommedan rule of the Pandyan kingdom, which lasted half a century, a feudatory chief under Travancore obtained possession of Nanjenaud, the southern part of Travancore and established himself as the ruler there. Subsequent to the conquest of Mysore by the Mahommedans and the relief of Madura kingdom, Nanja Koraven and his confederacy were driven away by the king of Travancore in the kollam year 292 (1117 AD).\n\nDuring the 5th century Malayam Era, and in the reign of King Adithya Vurmah, the Travancore royal family was under the necessity of adopting two females from the Kolathnaud royal family. They were settled at Attingal. The country around Attingal was assigned to them. King Adithya Vurmah extended his northern boundary till Vaikom in 505 M.E. (1330 AD). He died in 510 ME. (1335 AD). The son of the senior Rani of Attingal Sree Veera Rama Marthanda Vurmah, who was 28 years old then, was crowned king. This king reconstructed the palace near the pagoda at Trivandrum and built a fort around it. His government was most prosperous and his reign ended with his death in 550 M.E. (1376 AD). He had ruled for a period of 40 years. He was succeeded by his third brother, Eravi Vurmah, who resided at Trivandrum like his deceased brother, and ruled the kingdom with great credit to himself and to the entire satisfaction of his subjects. The king was anxious to perform the coronation ceremonies and collected the necessary funds for the same. While the preparations were advancing for this ceremony, the sovereign died in 557 M.E. (1382 AD), after a reign of seven years. He was succeeded by his nephew, Kerala Vurmah, who soon after ascending the throne performed the coronation ceremonies, and became ‘Kulasekhara Perumal’, but his highness died three months after his coronation.\n\nKerala Vurmah Kulasekhara Perumal was succeeded by his twin brother Chera Udaya Marthanda Vurmah. The reign of this sovereign was longer than that of all the Travancore monarchs. He ascended the throne at the age of sixteen and died at the ripe old age of seventy eight, after a reign of 62 years. After his coronation ceremonies he was styled ‘Kulasekhara Perumal’. During his reign all the southern possessions of Travancore on the Tinnevelly side were regained. His rule was of a mixed character, partly prosperous, and partly with troubles and vicissitudes. In consequence of the mild and unwarlike disposition of this king some of the subordinate chiefs in the east became refractory and there was constant fighting and uprising. The chief of Rettiapuram invaded Valliyoor and the king’s nephew was defeated in battle. Fearing disgrace the nephew committed suicide. The sovereign died in 619 M.E. (1444 AD).\n\nHe was succeeded by Venaud Mootha Rajah, who reigned for 14 years and died in 633 M.E. (1458 AD). From this year up to 855 M.E. (1680 AD), a period of about 225 years no detailed accounts of the reigns of the sovereigns can be found, except a list of their names and their dates of accession to the throne and the period of their reign. Venaud Mootha Rajah was succeeded by Sree Veera Marthanda Vurmah, who after a reign of 13 years died in 646 M.E. (1471 AD) and was succeeded by Adithya Vurmah whose reign lasted only 7 years. The successor of this sovereign was Eravi Vurmah who was installed on the throne in 653 M.E. (1478 AD), and ruled the country for 25 years, and his successor was Sree Marthanda Vurmah, who died in the very year of his installation. In 679 M.E. (1504 AD), Sree Veera Eravi Vurmah assumed the sovereignty and governed the kingdom for 24 years and on his death in 703 M.E. (1528 AD), King Marthanda Vurmah succeeded him and ruled for 9 years. He was succeeded by Udaya Marthanda Vurmh in 712 M.E. (1537 AD), who governed the kingdom for a period of 23 years and died in 735 M.E. (1560 AD). This sovereign was succeeded by Kerala Vurmah, who ruled only for 3 years. On his death in 738 M.E. (1563 AD) he was succeeded by Adithya Vurmah who died in the 4th year of his reign. Udaya Marthanda Vurmah was them installed on the throne in 742 M.E. (1567 AD) and ruled for a period of 27 years before he died.\n\nIn 769 M.E. (1594 AD) Sree Veera Eravi Vurmah assumed the sovereignty and after performing the coronation ceremonies took the family title ‘Kulashekara Perumal’. Several of his predecessors were unable to perform the coronation ceremony on account of difficulties in collecting the revenue, or in consequence of the obstructions thrown by the feudatory chiefs and nobles, as well as the Ettu Veetil Pillamars. Sree Veera Eravi Vurmah ruled the kingdom for 10 years and died in 779 M.E. (1604 AD) and was succeeded by Sree Veera Vurmah, whose rule ended after two years. Ravi Vurmah ascended the throne in 781 M.E. (1606 AD) and ruled for 13 years. Unny Kerala Vurmah succeeded him and began his reign in 794 M.E. (1619 AD), and ruled the country for 6 years. His successor Ravi Vurmah commenced his reign in 800 M.E. (1625 AD), reigned 6 years and died. He was succeeded by Unni Kerala Vurmah in 806 M.E (1631 AD) and he ruled the country for 30 years.\n\nKing Adithya Vurmah succeeded him in 836 M.E (1661 AD) and died in the 16th year of his reign under shocking circumstances. In 225 M.E (1050 AD) the ecclesiastical society was reorganised and was called Ettara Yogam – A society was formed consisting of eight and a ‘half member’, of whom eight were Potty Brahmins, each of whom had the privilege of a casting vote, and the sovereign who was considered a half member and had no vote in the transactions of the Devaswam affairs. By such an arrangement the affairs of the Devaswam became virtually vested in the hands of the 8 potty Brahmins, and they began to work the institution through their attaches, the Ettu Veetil Pillamar, who were the representatives of eight noble families. The sovereign had little or no influence over the Devaswam. He was simply required to be present at the usual periodical ceremonies. The power of the Yogakar became so great that they even imposed heavy fines upon the sovereign for wrongs done to the Devaswam institution. Devaswam possessed extensive landed property. Its sole managers were the Yogakar, who had the powers of despotic rulers over the Devaswam property and over every tenant and holders of the devaswam lands. The Ettu Veetil Pillamar were entrusted with the collection of the Devaswam revenue, and the villages where the Devaswam lands lay were divided into eight Adikarems. Each of the Ettu Veetil Pillamar was appointed a collector over the Adikarem, with powers of a petty chief. The king had no authority over these men. They rose in power and importance, and gradually became supreme lords in their villages, and in time became Madempimar (nobles and petty chiefs) who were not loyally attached to the crown.\n\nThe principal royal residence was at Sreevalumcode about 30 miles from the Devaswam headquarters at Trivendrum, which was solely under the despotic rule of the Yogakar and the Ettu Veetil Pillamar for a period of 235 years. So the reconstruction of the royal residence at Trivandrum in 510 M.E. (1335 AD) was not quite to the liking of the Yogakar. They were antagonised when the king took interest in their affairs and insisted upon having accounts submitted for periodical inspection. Though the king’s command was resisted by the Yogakar, Sree Veera Marthanda Vurmah quietly but effectively control during his reign of 40 years. The sovereign’s next two successors maintained the same policy in regard to Devaswam affairs. But subsequently the Yogakar and the Ettu Veetil Pillamar seemed to have regained their ascendancy and they gradually began to oppose the royal power. During the reign of the next seventeen sovereigns, extending a period of 187 years the hostilities from the Yogakar and the Ettu Veetil Pillamar and their confederates the Madempimar continued, but through the vigilant and pragmatic rule of those sovereigns no open outbreaks occurred.\n\nDuring the rule of Adithya Vurmah (1661 – 1677), on a certain night the palace caught fire and was burnt down. Not a single person from the villages or the Devaswam people who resided around the palace came forward to help put out the fire. It was suspected the the Yogakar and Ettu Veetil Pillamar were behind this nefarious act. The mild and spiritual king retired to the Puthencotta palace. The leaders of the confederates came in a body to the Puthencotta castle and requested an audience with the king, which was granted. They pretended to know nothing about the fire and attributed it to a mere accident and expressed their regret and professed to sympathise with the king. The Yogakar had come with nefarious intentions. They began to forward every day Nivedyams (sweetmeat) offered to the image of Padmanabha Swamy, for Pooja. One day the Nivedyam was poisoned. The king took ill and died suddenly.\n\nThe whole royal family at the time of the king’s death consisted of the king’s niece Umayamma Rani, and her six under age sons. On the death of the king, the confederates offered their condolences to the Rani and gave assurances of allegiance to her highness. They occupied the palace pretending to guard it against the intrusion of the disaffected and rebellious subjects.\n\nA few boys of the confederates befriended the five princes and played with them daily. One day these boys took the princes secretly, without the knowledge of the Rani, to a reservoir a few furlongs distant from the palace to play on the white sandy plane there and to bathe in the crystal clear water. While they were bathing some confederate came and seized the princes and drowned them in the reservoir. The Queen on receiving this sad news was plunged in sorrow, but she saw things in their true light and cursed the perpetrators. Unayamma Rani became Queen Regent in 852 M.E. (1677 AD). Her Highness finding the palace unsafe for her and her only son abandoned it and proceeded to a small palace in Neduvangaud.\n\nAt this time dissentions broke out amongst the confederates, and each feudatory chief became sole master of his own possessions. Misrule and anarchy prevailed throughout the country. Taking advantage of the situation in Travancore, a petty sirdar, under the Mogul Emperor wandering in the southern part of the peninsula with a brigade of horsemen plundering the unprotected territories invaded the southern part of Travancore. None of the nobles or chiefs were able to oppose this Mogul or arrest his progress. He advanced to Trivandrum and made his headquarters there. The Devaswam Yogakar shut the pagoda and fled the city for their lives. The Ettu Veetil Pillamar and the Madempimar too adopted the same course leaving the country at the mercy of the Mogul. A few Mahomedan servants attached to the Travancore royal house prevailed upon the mogul not to demolish or contaminate the pagoda or to convert any of the Hindus to Muslims.\n\nHer Highness Umayamma Rani finding it difficult to recover her kingdom from the Mogul sirdar invited one Kerala Vurmah a member of the Kottayam Rajah’s family. This Rajah was well versed in the art of warfare and was appointed Her Highness’s principal counsellor. He lost no time in raising an army. Rajah Kerala Vurmah led the army against the over confident Mogul sirdar and attacked him unexpectedly at Manacaud near Trivandrum. The Mughal did not have a sufficient force near him as his forces having been scattered taxes. The sirdar retreated and made a stand at Thiruvatar where he was reinforced by a contingent of horsemen and a fierce battle ensued. But the terrain was advantages to the foot soldiers of Rajah Kerala Vurmah. The Mogul cavalry was routed and the sirdar killed. Kerala Vurmah Rajah marched into Trivandrum. The Rani and her son soon followed. The palace a t Trivandrum was rebuilt. Kerala Vurmah reorganised the army, with the three hundred horses captured from the Mogul he created a battalion of cavalry, one regiment of swordsmen and one regiment of archers. He secured Trivandrum. After this he found no difficulty in bringing to obedience all the refractory chiefs and nobles. The Yogakar and the Ettu Veetil Pillamar were cowed, and became obedient to her Highness the Rani. The disaffected Madampimar and Ettu Veetil Pillamar perceiving that the strength of Her Highness the Rani’s Government rested with the Kerala Vurmah, conspired against him. On a certain night he was assassinated in his own house. The murderers remain unknown to date.\n\nIn 859 M.E (1684 AD) Umayamma Rani’s son, Prince Revi Vurmah attain his 16th year, and in accordance with the custom of the country, the sovereignty was transferred to him. On request of the Rani, the Kolatunaud king send two girls and two boys from the royal family for adoption in the Travancore family. A year after the adoption the Dowager Rani died and was soon followed to the grave by the elder of the two adopted girls. This younger of the girls became Attingal Mootha Thampuran. This Raani gave birth to a prince named Marthanda Vurmah in the year 881 M.E. (1706 AD). In 893 M.E. (1718 AD), King Revi Vurmah died and the eldest of the adopted princes, Unny Kerala Vurmah was proclaimed king of Travancore. This king was a quiet and weak ruler, and consequently the mischief makers began to acquire strength. In the course of two years they became powerful once more.\n\nANIZHAN THIRUNAL MARTHANDA VURMAH KULASEKHARA PERUMAL ( 1729–1758 )\n\nThe 14 year old Marthanda Varma could not tolerate such a state of affairs, and therefore requested his uncle, the reigning sovereign to let him take an active interest in the affairs of the Government. Armed with such powers the Prince lost no time in checking the rebellious spirit of the confederacy. He became the enemy of the Yogkar, the Ettu Veetil Pillamar and the Madempimar. The confederacy plotted against the prince and under these disagreeable circumstances the Prince was forced to shift from place to place, to avoid falling into the hands of the assassins. At different times and places the Prince was waylaid and nearly fell into the hands of the conspirators; but in every instance he providentially escaped. Once the Prince was trapped inside the pagoda. It was dusk and the priest changed clothes with the priest. Then the Prince carrying a brass vessel full of rice on his head, chanting manthras like a priest walked out. He whispered to the mob, like the priest told him to, that the Prince was lying concealed inside the temple. The priest donning the Prince’s clothes walked inside the temple peeping here and there as if he were in great anxiety. The mob entered the pagoda and fell upon the counterfeit prince and killed him. During his wanderings the Prince had to sleep on top of trees, under the roof of poor peasants, as well as in the midst of jungles.\n\nAfter six years of reign, Unny Kerala Vurmah died and was succeeded by his younger brother Rama Vurmah in 899 M.E. (1724 AD). His Highness in consultation with his nephew proceeded to Trichinopoly in 901 M.E (1726 AD) and entered into a treaty with the Madura Government by offering to renew the lapsed attachment to that crown and pay a certain sum of money annually. The sovereign was successful in obtaining from the Madura Government a force consisting of one thousand cavalry, and two thousand Carnatic sepoys. On the arrival of the force in Travancore all the Madempimar and refractory chiefs and insurgents fled, and consequently there was no work for the army, which was however retained for the purpose of overawing the insurgents.\n\nThe Yogakar and the Ettu Veetil Pillamar could not be brought under control, for they full well knew that the king could not take harsh measures against the Devaswam community. They continued their arrogant ways to the annoyance of the royal family. Consequently Prince Marthanda Vurmah was obliged to reside at Mavelikara and Attingal, with the senior Rani and her son, the little Prince Rama Vurmah. In 903 M.E. (1728 AD) when this prince was being taken to Attingal from Trivandrum, a party of men under Ettu Veetil Pillamar attacked the travellers at a place called Calakoottem. The vigilant measures adopted by the Kilimanoor Koil Thumpuran who was escorting the party saved the rani and her son. The Koil Thumpuran after sending the Rani and her son under a disguise to a neighbouring village got into the Rani’s palanquin and moved forward, with all the attendants. Thus drawing the attention away from the Rani. When the attack happened the koil Thumpuran jumped out sword in hand and killed many of the assailants, but was killed in the fierce fighting.\n\nIn the same year 903 M.E. (1728 AD) king Rama Vurmah died after a short illness. Various improvements were introduced by King Revi Vurmah during his reign. The power of the local chiefs were curtailed and special agents were appointed to various parts of the country, which was divided into districts, with the power to collect the revenue, which was roughly estimated before their appointment. After defraying the expenditure on religious and other institutions the agent was to pay the surplus into the king’s treasury. All such agents were recognised as king’s officers and thus the authority and influence of the Madempimar and petty chiefs were destroyed. After the death of this sovereign his successor Unny Kerala Vurmah was unable to enforce the above system generally, and in many parts of the country, especially in the southern districts of Nanjenaud anarchy once more prevailed. It was this state of affair that Rama Vurmah strove to remedy. Unfortunately he died before he could fully implement this system.\n\nMarthanda Vurmah succeeded his uncle King Rama Vurmah to the throne in 904 M.E. (1729 AD). His Highness was only 23 years old when he became king. The Kings attention was first directed to laying of the foundation of a good Government. The Maha Rajah raised an army of Maravers. He then send back the Trichinopoly forces back to the Pandyan Government. The feudatory chiefs and nobles after the withdrawal of the Pandyan forces began to rebel again. They combined and formed a confederacy as before and were joined by the two sons of the late sovereign, known as Kunju Thambies. One of them was Papu Thamby and the other Raman Thamby.\n\nIn addition to the new regiment of Maravars and Nairs, regiments of infantry with firearms were formed and maintained, fortifications were constructed at all the important frontiers and were garrisoned by detachments. Thus in a couple of years the country enjoyed peace and tranquillity. The Maha rajah was able to recover longstanding arrears from his chiefs and nobles, who were overawed by the sight of the new army. The restless and turbulent Kunju Thambies and the chiefs and nobles renewed their schemes and plots against the king’s life. Their leader was Papu Thamby and through him all the chiefs and nobles between Padmanabhapuram and Attingal were invited to join in the confederacy. The king received private intelligence about their foul designs. He employed spies to move about in disguise and to procure information.\n\nOne night two of the Ettu Veetil Pillamar convened a meeting of the confederacy and planned the assassination of the king. The assembly agreed that on the day of the Aarattu procession, the king would have to walk some distance preceding the idols, and that every one of the Ettu Veetil Pillamar and four Brahmin chiefs connected with the Yogakar should attend the Aarattu procession with their men (militia), armed with swords, lances and daggers should attend the procession. Near the sea beach, when the idols are housed as customary for pooja and when the king retires to the shed a party of men should suddenly attack and assassinate the king. This resolution was committed to writing on Ola (Palmyra leaf) and several copies were made for the information of the absent chiefs. In order to ensure secrecy these were put inside the soles of the footwear of the messengers and were dispatched to various places.\n\nAn old Pandaram, who was living in that building, which was a public inn, overheard the consultations. The chiefs who gathered for the treacherous plotting paid no heed to the old man as he was in the employ of Venganoor Pillay, one of the main plotters. But this man was one of the king’s spies. Thus the king came to know of the plot before daybreak and fortunately the king could secretly apprehend two of the messengers. The captured messengers were kept in private confinement in the palace and the two Olas (messages) were secured in the king’s own desk and everything was hushed up for the time being. The king as not alarmed by the conspiracy, which he was determined to trace to its origin and then extirpate the race of the conspirators. A strong force of cavalry and infantry accompanied the king on Aaratt day. An unusual force escorted the idols both in the front and rear. The king fearlessly walked in front of the idols. On seeing such preparations and precautions being taken during the procession, the chiefs and nobles were cowed and none of them had the boldness to strike the premeditated blow.\n\nSoon after the Aaratt festival the king made all the necessary arrangement for protecting the capital and defending himself against the chiefs and nobles. In 908 M.E (1733 AD) the king proceeded from Trivandrum to Nagercoil. While there he decided to extirpate his old enemies and punish their leaders, the Kunju Thambies. Secret instructions were given to seize all the nobles and chiefs simultaneously on a prearranged signal being given and to post horses between Nagercoil and Trivandrum for conveying the signal. The king then invited the Kunju Thambies. One morning as the king was sitting upstairs in the palace the Thambies came to see him. The king’s attendants were ordered to stop the Thamby at the door leading to the stair and to cut him down if he resisted. Papu Thamby came in and walked to the door leading to the stairs where he was stopped. Being the son of the late Rajah, he had the privilege of going to the royal presence without special permission. So when the guards wouldn’t let him through without special permission, he became irritated. Affronted, a quarrel ensued, which resulted in a bloody conflict. Papu Thamby drew his sword and was cut down. His brother, Raman Thamby witnessing the tragedy, without waiting to remonstrate, rushed upstairs with drawn sword and aimed a deadly blow at the king who was seated on a swinging cot. Providentially the point of the sword struck a low beam and the aim was deflected. Before he could strike a second time the king dexterously sprang upon the Thamby and seized the sword had and threw him down. The king was a tall and strong man, and a trained warrior. The king pinned the Thamby down and drew his knife from his girdle and thrust it deep into the chest of Raman Thamby. During the scuffle the king’s dress was smeared with blood. Rising up he opened the window and showed himself to his officers and men and gave the pre-arranged signal. Some of the Thambies followers who flocked to the spot to help their masters were cut down and a few of them escaped.\n\nBefore daybreak every one of the Madempimar and Ettu Veetil Pillamar, together with the three Pandarams and the Potty (the four Yogakar) were apprehended. The next day they were arraigned before the king at Kulculam. The king presided over the trial, the two ‘Olas’ were produced and both the apprehended messengers were called as witness. Each of the nobles and chiefs so arraigned was called to answer the charge of treason on which he was indicted. 42 of the nobles and chiefs and their confederates were tried, pleaded guilty and were sentenced to death. They were all hanged at a place called Mukhamandapam. The four Brahmins and a few others of the same cast were tried and found guilty, but the punishment of death in the case of Brahmins were not allowed by the laws of Manu, by which the Hindus are governed. The king sentenced them to be banished from the country, after making them outcastes by branding their foreheads with the figure of a dog. Orders were given to seize the women and children of the families of the traitors and give them over to the fishermen who lived on the sea beach, so that they might become out-castes and the race of Madempimars and Ettu Veetil Pillamar might not be revived in this age.\n\nIn 906 M.E. (1731 AD) the king of Quilon (Dasinganaud) formed an alliance with the king of Kayemkulam by adopting some members of the ruling family of the latter. This adoption was in direct opposition of the King of Travancore. Marthanda Vurmah led a powerful army towards Quilon under his command. After several battles at the Quilon frontier, Marthanda Vurmah being victorious advance to the capital of Dasinganaud. The king of Quilon sued for peace. Marthanda Vurmah acceded to the proposal, but compelled the Quilon king to cancel the adoption and .break off the alliance with Kayemkulam. Moreover, he decided that Dasinganaud should be annexed to Travancore, on the death of the only remaining king of the family. All these conditions were agreed to by the Quilon king. Marthanda Vurmah returned to Trivandrum with the king of Quilon, who was accommodated in one of the palaces called Valia Koikel. There he lived a more luxurious life than Marthanda Vurmah himself.\n\nThe Kayemkulam King made a pact with the Cochin rajah. A consultation was held by all the northern kingdoms presided over by the Cochin Rajah. They resolved upon assisting the king of Quilon. Spies spirited the king of Quilon to Kayemkulam. From there he was send with a strong force to Quilon. Marthanda Vurmah proceeded to reconquer Quilon, but the fortifications raised and the defensive measures adopted there with the assistance of the Cochin Rajah, supplemented by the European fire arms procured from the Dutch Governor of Cochin, made success for the Travancore army doubtful. After many fierce battles and loss of life suffered on both sides Marthanda Vurmah wisely retreated.\n\nThe Travancore army was strengthened with additions of Cavalry and infantry, new fire-arms were procured through English merchants. In 909 M.E. (1734 AD) was despatched against Quilon and Kayemkulam under the command of Thanu Pillay and Sthanapathy Cumaraswamy Pillay, aided by the able secretary Ram Iyen. The Kayemkulam king applied for the Dutch help, but it was refused on the plea that the war was brought on by the aggression of the Kayemkulam king. He was however supported by the king of Cochin. After several battles no advantage was gained by either side. The king of Kayemkulam finding that he could not hold out much longer decided to make a final push. He gambled, committing everything. He was a bold and powerful personage, took chief command of the army and the battle was severe and fierce. It lasted many hours and during the heat of the battle one of the bullets fired by the mounted sepoys of the Travancore army felled the king of Kayemkulam. The death of the king was not immediately noticed and so the battle continued for some time longer. When the loss of the sovereign became known all the commanders became disheartened gradually withdrew from the field. The spirit of the Kayemkulam army was revived by the younger brother of the fallen king. He took over the reins and being more courageous and obstinate than the late king, rallied the troop and the war continued with redoubled vigour.\n\nMarthanda Vurmah came to Quilon and infused fresh courage into the Travancore army. A special body of recruits was raised for the war with Kayemkulam. Secretary Rama Iyen proceeded to Tinnevelly and brought back a regiment of Maravers under the command of Ponnam Pandya Devan, procured a thousand mounted sepoys from Palayapattucar (Poligars) and marched the reinforcements by the hill roads through Kottarakaray. In the battle next day the Kayemkulam forces met with defeat for the first time. The war continued and slowly Rama Iyen’s army gained ground and advanced into Kayemkulam territories day by day. The Kayemkulam Rajah finding it impossible to hold out much longer appealed for help from the Dutch Governor and the Kochi Rajah. Since no help came from both the parties the Kayemkulam rajah sued for peace. Marthanda Vurmah suspended hostilities and the war came to a close. Marthanda Vurmah annexed Elayada Swaroopam (embracing, Shencottah, Clangaud, Kerkudi and Valliroor) on the Tinnevelly side, and Kottarakara and Pathanapuram on the northern side.\n\nSometime later in 909 M.E. (1734 AD) the king of Quilon died and the country was taken possession by the Kayemkulam rajah. The king of Kayemkulam was well supported by his friend the king of Cochin and the Dutch Governor in Cochin this time. All negotiations failed over time. The result was the declaration of a second war. In 914 M.E (1739 AD) Travancore forces marched against Kayemkulam. In 916 M.E (1741 AD) the Dutch installed the Rani of Eladaya Swaroopam as sovereign of that state. Marthanda Vurmah declared war on the Dutch. Marthanda Vurmah’s forces were victorious over the small Dutch detachment, with the large allied forces which supported the Rani. Many Dutch soldiers were killed and the allied forces fled. The Rani herself escaped and was given shelter in Cochin by the Dutch. After this signal defeat the Dutch retired to Cochin. The Travancore forces besieged Kayemkulam. Meanwhile the Dutch reinforcements from Ceylon landed at Colachel, and commenced to attack the villages and the small Travancore garrisons there. Marthanda Vurmah who was at Trivandrum hastened with all the forces at hand to the south. Rama Iyen Dalawah came from the north with a large reinforcement. When the fighting commenced it lasted a full two months. The Dutch after suffering much loss retreated to fort leaving behind several of their comrades dead, wounded and prisoners. Of the last there were 24 men consisting of both officers and privates. The siege of the Colachel fort began soon after. In the course of a few hours the fort was taken and the enemy driven to their ships, which sailed for Cochin.\n\nOf the Dutch prisoners two men attracted the Dalawah’s notice and were taken before the king. The king was struck with the appearance of one of them. The Dutch prisoners were overcome with the kind treatment they received from the king and decided to serve the king and were enlisted in the king’s army. Most of them distinguished themselves in the king’s service as Captains and Majors, and some of their descendants are still to be found in Travancore. Eustatious D’ Lanoy, a Flemish man whom the king had taken special notice of was made a Captain and was assigned to train a few companies of the king’s sepoys. D’Lanoy trained the sepoys so satisfactorily in a few months, that the king was delighted with his ability and military knowledge, appointed him Captain of the King’s body guards.\n\nMany battles were fought with the Kayemkulam kingdom, without either side obtaining any decisive victory. This was continued for an unusually long time, the Dutch rendering every support to the Kayemkulam king and also attacking certain parts of the Travencore country. The only actual defeat that the Travancore army met was when 6000 Travancore troops attacked the Dutch fort at Quilon. It was defended by a number of Nairs under the leadership of Autchutha Warrier, a Kariakar of the Kayemkulam king. He commanded the fort garrison and fought with desperate courage. The Travancore troops were forced to retreat. But the war still continued. In early 917 M.E. (1743 AD) the combined forces of the Kayemkulam Rajah and the Dutch forces marched to Kilimanoor and captured the fort there. Marthanda Vurmah raise an army of 5000 Nairs, and a corps of Sappers and Miners. He procured arms and ammunition from the English at Anjengo and the French at Mahe. He collected all the best guns from his forts. He divided his army into three divisions. The king assumed the chief command, the prince (heir apparent), Rama Iyen and Captain D’Lanoy were appointed to command each division. The siege of Kilimnoor fort commenced. The enemy held out for 68 days. After this defeat the remnants of the Dutch and Kayemkulam forces retreated to Quilon. The Travancore army advanced towards Kayemkulam. The hurdles were great and the fighting severe, but ultimately Marthanda Vurmah was victorious. The king of Kayemkulam sued for peace. He concluded a treaty in late 917 M.E (1743 AD) with Marthanda Vurmah, ceding the greater portion of his country to Travancore and binding himself to be a tributary and ally, paying an annual tribute of one elephant and 1000 rupees.\n\nThe Kayemkulam Rajah had not paid the tribute since the ratification of the treaty, evidently considering it degrading and beneath his dignity to do so. Marthanda Vurmah had reasons to believe that there existed a confederacy among the kings of Kayemkulam, Ambalapuzha and Changanacherry, and that was the cause of the non-payment of the tribute. Marthanda Vurmah send a force under Rama Iyen Dalawah in 921 M.E (1746 AD) to enforce the conditions of the treaty. The Kayemkulam king asked for 10 days’ time to decide whether to pay the tribute or give up the country, which was allowed by the Dalawah who had camped at Mavelikara. The king of Kayemkulam secretly removed all his family, his treasures, jewels and all that could be conveyed to the north in covered boats, accompanied by trustworthy attendants, with orders to proceed beyond Trichoor. Every night he emptied his palace of everything valuable in huge baggage boats called Kattu Munchee. After a week on the 8th day, the Rajah stole away from the palace to the north. On the 10th day Rama Iyen Dalawah found the palace empty and desolate.\n\nThe Quilon king after the fall of Kayemkulam dissociated himself from the fallen king and with the secret aid of the Dutch defied Marthanda Vurmah’s authority. The Travancore army was sent against the Quilon Rajah, and after several battles the King of Quilon was defeated and his country was annexed to Travancore.\n\nKing Marthanda Vurmah now directed Rama Iyen Dalawah to proceed against the king of Ambalapuzha. Though Ambalapuzha was a small kingdom, it had a well-trained army. The Ambalauzha king ordered his force under the command of Mathoo Panicker and several others, to garrison his southern frontier town of Thottappally, where the armies met and severe fighting commenced. The Ambalapuzha king was an ingenious chieftain and had invented different kinds of arrows, the points of which were all poisoned, so that even small wounds inflicted by these arrows resulted in death. The Travancore suffered severe losses and were forced to retreat. Superstition spread among the Nair troops that Deva Narayanen (Krishna Swamy) the household deity of the Rajah was personally conducting the war. Panic seized the Nair troops and none of the Hindu portion of the troops could be persuaded to fight the Ambalapuzha king’s forces. Rama Iyen Dalawah had to bring in Captain D’Lanoy with his Artillery and the Muslim and Christian corps. When the fighting renewed, Captain D’Lanoy worked his artillery with deadly effect. In the course of a few hours great loss was sustained by the Ambalapuzha forces. The Hindu forces were encouraged by the gains the Travancore Army made and joined the fight. Soon a good part of the Ambalapuzha forces were slain. Mathoo Panicker the commander in chief of the Ambalapuzha Army and Thekkaydathu Bhattathiry, the family priest of the Ambalauzha king, seeing their inability to resist the Travancore power, advised their king to yield and negotiate for peace, but the king would not listen. He placed too much confidence on his inventions and his archers and ordered the battle to be continued. Whereupon the battle was renewed and the Travancore army proved victorious and began advancing towards the capital. The king was adamant and willing to fight to the end, but Panicker and Bhattathiry seeing the senseless loss of life asked for a truce, suspending action on their part at the same time. When the Ambalapuzha King was informed of their conduct, he calmly turned to his favourite game of chess. Rama Iyen Dalawah advanced to the capital took the chess playing king prisoner and sent him to Trivandrum under a strong escort. The Ambalapuzha forces were disarmed and the territories were annexed by the Travancore kingdom. The prudent behaviour of Thekkaydathu Bhattathiry and Mathoo panicker were brought to the attention of King Marthanda Varmah, who conferred all the privileges exercised by the King of Ambalapuzha over the great temple of Ambalapuzha on the Bhattathiry and gave large grants of lands, in addition to the title of nobility upon Mathoo Panicker.\n\nMarthanda Vurmah did not stop here. Finding that the King of Kottayam and Vadakkankoor King had rendered assistance to the Kayemkulam Rajah, he directed his army under the command of the prince (his nephew), to attack these two countries. The war against the two kings were carried on and several battles fought, in the course of which Kottayam fort was captured and the king taken prisoner. As a consequence of the fall of Kottayam, the Vadakkankoor king fled to Calicut leaving his country to the mercy of the prince. Kottayam and Vadakkankoor were annexed to Travancore.\n\nThe last king of Kottayam (Thekkumkur) was Aditya Varma Manikandan and he resided in the Neerazhi Palace at Changanassery. It was a time when there arose a difference of opinion between Adityavarma and his younger brother Goda Varman. The king was willing for the alliance with Kochi, however, the crown prince was sympathetic to Travancore and Marthanda Varma. Goda Varman (crown prince of Thekkumkur) and Marthanda Varma of Travancore were classmates at Madurai when they were studying of Rajyadharma. After hearing of the military advance of the Travancore under the leadership of Ramayyan Dalawa and Captian De Lannoy; the crown prince of Thekkumkur (Goda Varman) then advised king Aditya Varma Manikandan to make a friendship with Travancore kingdom citing the downfall of princely state of Ambalapuzha (Chempakassery) and the fall of princely state Kayamkulam. Meanwhile, when Marthanda Varma seized Kayamkulam and Chempakassery, Aditya Varma realized that they were the next victims and sent his brother to Thiruvananthapuram for an unconditional peace mission and met Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma of Travancore and requested help.\n\nUnfortunately, Marthanda Varma asked Goda Varman, for a deal whereby Goda Varman will be in power in Kottayam as a vassal state of Travancore, if he helped to oust King Adithya Varman. Marthanda Varma had already heard of the rift between the brothers. The younger king was well-received in the southern part of Thekkumkur kingdom. The self-righteous crown prince would not betray his elder brother and decided to stay and persuade Marthanda Varma for a favourable treaty. The evil intelligence of Marthanda Varma and Ramayyan Dalawa planned together. He sent a messenger to the younger king and told him the fake news, saying, \"Depart to Kottayam immediately; the mother's health is bad\". The crown prince Goda Varman decided to leave, boarded the boat and headed north; Marthanda Varma gave him some gifts for Thekkumkur king Aditya Varma Manikandan. On the way, he descended on Anchuthengu Fort and received eleven ritual fire by the British authorities. From there he reached via Paravur Lake, Ashtamudi Lake, Kayamkulam Lake and Vembanadu Lake. The next day the boat of the crown prince reached Illyakkadavu at Thazhathangadi. Ramayyan's servants who followed by another boat and they slaughtered the crown prince Goda Varman and his servants. The next day was the declaration of war by Travancore. Crown prince's \"classmate” king Marthanda Varma challenges the Kottayam King Aditya Varman Manikandan for cheating and the killing of his younger brother.Ramayyan Dalawa spread the news that the Thekkumkur king Adithya Varman killed crown prince Goda Varman. He also said that king Adithya Varman send a false message saying that the mother of the prince was extremely ill and requested the attendance of the prince at her death bed. The prince it seems told king Marthanda Varma that the message was a lure to trap him, but Marthanda Varma disbelieved the prince and send him back saying that he ought to respect his mother’s wishes. And that the fears of the young prince proved to be true as King Aditya Varman had his brother strangled as he neared Changanachery and spread a report saying that the crown prince had died of a snake bite. In 925 M.E (1750 AD).\n\nRama Iyen Dalawah took possession of Changanacherry. Many of the nobles and chiefs called Karthavu, Kaimal, Elayadam and Panicker under the Kottayam (Thekkumkur) kingdom as well as those of Ambalapuzha and Vadakkunkur kingdoms are said to have presented themselves before King Marthanda Vurmah when he came to Changanacherry and acknowledged his sovereignty over them, and paid homage with large nuzzers. Rama Iyen Dalawah then marched north, and after fortifying the positions between Thekkumkur and Vadakkumkur from Kumarakam to the east up to the hills of Koondoor, marched to the north to settle the northern boundary which was extended to the southern bank of Periar, which runs to the west by Alwaye. The newly acquired territories included those lying on the south-east and north of the Cochin Rajah's capital, Thripoonithara, with the exception of the small kingdoms of Alangaud and Paravoor.\n\nThe Dutch on seeing the final fall and annexation of Kayemkulam, and knowing that they could not get pepper from Travancore, their rivals the English having monopolised the pepper trade in Marthanda Vurmah’s territory, were anxious to ratify the treaty with Travancore. In 923 M.E (1748 AD) the draft treaty was sanctioned, and the Cochin Governor was instructed to get it ratified without delay, but the Cochin council having made some slight modifications to which Marthanda Vurmah made fresh objections. The treaty was not ratified before a further reference to the Dutch Government. In 928 M.E (1753 AD) it was finally ratified.\n\nAbout this time the deposed king of Ambalapuzha escaped from Kodamaloor, where he was interred. He proceeded north and was joined by the Vadakkumkur and Thekkumkur kings and in consort with them resolved to recover their kingdoms. They appealed for support from the then most influential nobleman Paliathu Menon (Paliathu Autchen) and other nobles Kodasherry Karthavu, Koratee Kaimal and others who were all feudatory chiefs of the king of Cochin. Together they persuaded the king of Cochin to break the treaty with Travancore. As preparations for the war began, many disaffected Nairs from Kayemkulam, Ambalapuzha, Changanacherry and Ettumanoor joined them. The Dutch Governor at Cochin, though a friend of the Cochin Rajah, leaked information of the war preparations to the King of Travancore. When he Cochinites landed at Poracaud, the Travancore army was ready and waiting. They allowed the Cochin army to land and proceed forward. Squadrons of Travancore army by their right and prevented the retreat of the Cochin army. The Cochin army was decimated. The Cochin commanders Paliathu Menon and Kodakasherry Karthavu and several nobles of minor importance were captured. The many Nairs from Kayemkulam and other provinces in Travancore were searched out from the captured men and decapitated as an exemplary punishment. Rama Iyen then proceeded north and crossed Madathumkaray the southern boundary of the Cochin kingdom, about five miles north of Alleppey. He marched as far as Arookutty where he pitched his camp. Cochin Rajah sued for peace. The Dutch Governor also requested Marthanda Varmah to respect their limits. Marthanda Vurmah immediately ordered to return to Mavelikaray. Though Rama Iyen returned, he took care to retain possession of the country between Alleppey and Arookutty, which extends to about 24 miles into the Cochin kingdom.\n\nIn 927 M.E (1752 AD), Marthanda Vurmah purchased the country lying between Cape Comorin and Kalacaud, which had earlier belonged to the Travancore kingdom but was captured by the Pandyan king. He purchased if from Moodemiah, the Viceroy of the Carnatic Nabob. In 930 M.E (1755 AD) the kingdom of Travancore extended from Periar in the north to Kalacaud in the south.\n\nTowards the middle of 930 ME (1755 AD) the Zamorin of Calicut sent a formidable army to invade the Cochin Rajah’s territories. All the countries north of Cochin were taken possession of and military stations at Trichur, Cranganore and Paravoor established. On the remonstration of the Dutch further progress of the army, which was on its way to Thripoonithara to attack was arrested. The Dutch informed the Travancore king the plan of Zamorin to invade Travancore, and every preparation was made by Marthanda Vurmah to meet the invasion. The Zamorin’s forces came in a large fleet of native craft, and as it was being landed, Captain D’Lanoy’s force, accompanied by Raman Iyen’s met the enemy and after a fierce encounter, compelled the Zamorin’s forces to retreat with great loss of life and ammunition. Many of the boats were captured and destroyed and a part of the force was drowned. This defeat checked the Zamorin, but chagrined and humiliated as he was, he again began to prepare for another invasion. He gathered a huge force of Arabs and Nairs and was about to begin a second invasion, when Hyder Ali from Mysore made a descent on Malabar. He had to hasten back to protect his own dominions.\n\nIn 932 M.E (1757 AD) a new treaty with the Cochin Rajah was signed by King Marthanda Vurmah. General D’Lannoy was entrusted with the further improvements of the Travancore army, which now numbered above 50,000 trained troops of all branches such as infantry, cavalry, artillery and irregular troops, trained and drilled according to the European discipline. They were mostly armed with European weapons, procured from the English and the Dutch. The forces were commanded by Europeans, Eurasians, Nairs and Pathans. In 931 M.E (1756 AD) Rama Iyen Dalawah fell ill at Mavelikaray and soon afterwards expired. No successor was appointed in the place of Rama Iyen for the next two years. Marthanda Vurmah though only 53 years old, began to feel unwell and gradually became weak and infirm. Marthanda Vurmah expired, sinking quietly as if in a sleep, in the presence of all the members of the royal family, in the year 933 M.E (1758 AD).\n\nPOST MARTHANDA VURMAH PERIOD (King Rama Vurmah. 1758–1798 )\n\nRama Vurmah, the nephew of King Marthanda Vurmah succeeded him. He was 34 years old when he ascended the throne. The rules and regulations adopted by Marthanda Vurmah, had not been fully established in the newly acquired northern territories, which the new sovereign fully implemented. He further improved and remodelled the army, training and disciplining additional men and bringing the Travancore army to an equal footing with that of the Carnatic Nabob and the English. The revenue and judicial administration of the kingdom was improved. The acting Dalawah, Iyeppen Marthanda Pillay was confirmed in his appointment. The whole kingdom was made into three divisions, each under a Valia Sarvadhikariakar. These regions again were subdivided and placed under Sarvadhikariakar. The same was again made into districts and over each district a Kariakar was appointed. The districts were again subdivided into Maniums, Kelvies, Adhikarems and Proverthies. These were placed under the charge of Manikarens, Adhikaries and Proverthikars. All these officers had a staff or sub-officials such as writers, accountants, peons etc.\n\nThe Zamorin of Calicut still retained the possession of Cochin’s northern frontier from Trichur up to Paravoor and Alangaud, and threatened further encroachment on the Cochin kingdom. The king of Cochin sent his minister Paliathu Menon to Trivandrum and applied for assistance to drive away the Zamorin promising to reimburse every expense for that purpose. The Travancore king acceded to this proposal. The King of Cochin came to Trivandram in 937 M.E (1762 AD) and entered into a new treaty with the Travancore King. The king Rama Vurmah, then directed his Prime Minister Iyepen Marthanda Pillay to proceed with an army to the north, under the command of General D’Lanoy. The army on reaching Paravoor, drove away the Zamorin’s garrison stationed there. The army then was divided into two, one under the Dalawah, which proceeded to Trichur by Karoopadanay. The other under General D’Lanoy marched towards Chowghaut and commenced attack on that place. Though the Zamorin’s forces resisted stoutly for a time, still was no match for General D’Lanoy’s disciplined army and it was compelled to retreat. Thus both the divisions reached Trichur routing the Zamorin’s forces. From there both the divisions marched north together driving the Zamorin’s forces from its stronghold at Chalakaray and pursuing it as far as Kakadu. As the Travancore army was preparing to march to Calicut, the Zamorin sued for peace and the Travancore king accepted the offer. The Zamorin came to Trivandrum in 938 M.E (1763 AD) and a treaty of alliance was entered into. The Zamorin agreed to indemnify King Rama Vurmah the expenses of the war by paying a moderate sum of 150,000 rupees and at the same time promising perpetual friendship and fidelity. The Travancore kingdom built a strong garrison at Chalakaray and also despatching troops to Paravoor and other places to defend those place. Thus the borders of Travancore kingdom was extended further north.\n\nTheDalawah and General D’Lanoy on the orders of King Rama Vurmah devised a plan of fortification in the northern frontiers of the kingdom. A strong fort of laterite at Kuriapilly on the southern bank of the Cranganoor bar was built. From that a mud wall 20 feet thick and 12 feet high was constructed, which ran to the east up to the chain of hills to a distance of 30 miles. This wall was interspersed with stone batteries hand bastions at intervals and also small forts at certain locations adjoining the barrier. On the left side of the barrier a ditch was dug, measuring 16 feet widw and 20 feet deep, while on the right a road of similar breadth was made. On the side of the ditch close to the wall, bamboo and other thorny shrubs were planted. This was called Nedumcotta. General D’Lanoy adopted measures to keep the people in subjection to the rules, such as frequent marches through the country by military detachments in full military parade. All the lawless characters were kept in great awe by these measures.\n\nMaphuz Khan Sahib, the governor of the Pandyan Empire, under Carnatic Nabob, stationed at Tinnevely, rebelled against the Nabob and attacked Kalacaud the eastern province of Travancore. King Rama Vurmah sent one of his commandants Thamby Kumaren Chempaka Raman Pillay against the Khan’s forces. The battle was very severe. The Mohamedan forces were obliged to beat a retreat from the Aramboly lines, but the Khan retained not only the possession of Kalacaud, but assumed possession of the district of Shencottah and all other eastern districts belonging to Travancore. The King of Travancore represented the matter to the Nabob, who replaced Maphuz Khan and appointed Yusaff Khan as the new governor. Yusaff Khan found it difficult to subdue the refractory Governor and had to take the help of the Travancore King’s army to defeat Maphuz Khan. The eastern provinces were thus retaken, but this did not last long as Yusaff Khan in turn became disobedient to his master and established himself as an independent chief. He also secured aid from the French. In 937 M.E (1762 AD) a joint force of the Nabob and the English were sent against Yusaff, and the Travancore king was also requested to co-operate. Yusaff was captured and hanged by the order of the Nabob. After complicated negotiations, the Nabob agreed to restore some of the Travancore territories including Shencottah and Cape Comorin. In return the Travancore king had to renounce claims on Kalacaud.\n\nIn 938 M.E (1763 AD) soon after his victorious return from the north, Iyeppen Marthanda Pillay died and he was succeeded by Varkalay Subba Iyen, in 939 M.E (1763 AD). In 939 M.E (1764 AD) this able Dalawah persuaded the King of Paravoor to resign formally his sovereign rights in the Paravoor state in favour of Travancore and retire on a pension. A similar proposal to the Anangaud sovereign was also made, who after some hesitation at first, signed the treaty.\n\nIn 941 M.E (1766 AD) Hyder Ali of Mysore invaded and took possession of all the northern countries of Malabar. The opposition of several Nair chiefs and the Zamorin of Calicut proved ineffectual. The Zamorin committed suicide by burning himself and some of his relations and the courtiers in his own palace. Hyder took possession of all the petty states and the whole of the Zamorin’s domains and thus became master of the country between Cannanore and Ponnany. The Cochin king fearing the approach of Hyder Ali, offered his allegiance and paid a sum of two lacs rupees and eight elephants, binding himself at the same time as a tributary of the Mysore king.\n\nHyder Ali then turned his attention to Travancore. The Dutch who were friendly both to Hyder and to Travancore, had established themselves at the very northern frontier of the Travancore kingdom, and thus provided a barrier to Hyder Ali’s progress.\n\nIn 943 M.E (1768 AD) Dalawah Subba Iyen died and Gopala Iyen was appointed Dalawah. Meanwhile Hyder Ali was effectively checked by the English. He was defeated by the soldiers of the East India Company in several engagements with them. Hyder Ali sued for peace and a treaty was concluded with the East India Company in Madras in 1769 AD. In it special provisions were secured by the Company for the safety of the kingdom of Travancore.\n\nIn 949 M.E (1774 AD) Hyder Ali again entered the province of Malabar and began to commit devastations. The then Zamorin of Calicut fled his country with all his relatives and dependants and sought refuge in the kingdom of Travancore. On hearing of the flight of the Zamorin, Hyder Ali became enraged and commenced to march towards Travancore. As on the previous occasion, the Dutch East India Company stood in the way. Hyder Ali remonstrated with the Dutch and threatened to force an entrance. The Dutch declared that they could not allow passage without special permission from Batavia. At the same time they communicated with the Travancore king and asked if he was ready to join them in the offensive against Hyder Ali. But Rama Vurmah replied that the treaty of Madras prevented him from joining the Dutch from any such operations, but for the protection of his frontiers, and only for that purpose he would join them.\n\nHyder Ali had therefore seek a route through the Kingdom of Cochin. King Rama Vurmah on hearing this, set to work with his army in conjunction with the Dutch, strongly resisted the progress of Hyder’s forces through the Dutch frontier. General D’Lanoy’s health failed at this juncture and Valia Sarvadhikariakar Kessava Pillay and several other able commandants were the ones principally engaged on this occasion. Intimations of the unwarranted incursions of Hyder Ali was given to the Governor of Madras and a general war against Hyder Ali resulted. During the war General D’Lanoy fell ill at Udayagiri and died in the year 952 M.E (1777 AD). The war continued for several years and in the interval Hyder Ali died in 957 M.E (1782 AD). His son Tippu Sultan succeeded him and for a couple of years matters were in status quo. In the year 959 M.E (1784 AD) a fresh treaty was concluded by Tippu Sultan with the East India Company at Mangalore, when all hostilities ceased. The kingdom of Travancore flourished.\n\nTippu Sultan who had been watching the proceedings of the Travancore kingdom became jealous of the growing prosperity and he began to concert measures to bring Travancore under his sway. In the year 963 M.E (1788 AD) he renewed his incursions into the Malayalam territory. His depredations being accompanied with additional violence and cruelty. He proclaimed martial law between Ponnany and Cannanore. The worst of Tippo’s tyrannical proceedings was that he ordered the conversion of all the Hindus indiscriminately, whether of high or low caste, to the Mussulman faith, and all who objected to acknowledge the prophet were menaced with death. All the high caste Hindus fled from Malabar to Travancore. The Tippu was still more highly offended and demanded Rama Vurmah to send back the refugees, which the Travancore king declined to do so.\n\nThe King of Travancore interacted more with the English and asked for their help to protect his country from Tippu Sultan. They send soldiers and the king placed his army at their disposal. The king’s army were led by English officers. As the Dutch had already sold many of their minor possessions to Travancore, the king negotiated for the purchase of Monambam and all the northern Dutch possessions including the forts of Aycottah and Cranganore. The Dewan found no difficulty in coming to a speedy settlement in 1789 AD. The British did not like this settlement and conveyed their displeasure to the king of Travancore and threatened to withdraw their support to the king in the event of a war with Tippu Sultan. When the Sultan heard of the proceedings of the Madras Government, he thought it was too good an opportunity to be lost.\n\nIn 964 M.E (1789 AD) Tippu’s powerful army under his personal command, attacked the northern frontier of Travancore and attempted a breach of the barrier. The attack was ably and gallantly resisted by the Paravoor Battalion on duty there. A part of the Sultan’s army was ordered to breach the wall where it was not guarded. The progress through the breached wall was resisted by the Travancore army. Tippu had to bring reinforcements to make further progress. While the reinforcements were advancing the commanding officer of Tippu’s forces that breached the wall was killed and threw Tippu’s advance force into disorder and flight. The advancing reinforcement was checked by the fleeing forces. The panic became general and the retreating men fell into the ditch and were killed by the fleeing men falling on them. The bodies that filled the ditch enabled the reminder to pass over them. The Sultan himself was thrown down in the struggle and the bearers of the palanquin trampled to death. Though he was rescued from death by some his faithful followers, yet he received injuries. Tippu’s sword, signet ring and other personal ornaments fell into the hands of the Travancore army and several officers and men were taken prisoners. Tippu retreated with great shame and chagrin and Dewan Kesava Pillay returned to Trivandrum triumphant.\n\nTippu determined on retaliating, concentrated a large force on the northern frontier of the Travancore kingdom. The Madras Government was informed of the above proceedings and the Governor assured of assistance in the event of invasion by Tippu Sultan. No active measures were taken by the Madras Government till it was too late. Tippu’s forces commenced action in 964 M.E 1790 AD). It began as a small skirmish outside the wall. Tippu’s artillery began to work. Finding no perceptible effect on the wall, a few more batteries were erected and the largest guns were mounted, which opened a destructive fire. The wall resisted the fire for nearly a month, before a practicable breach of three quarter of a mile in length was effected. By this time the Travancore army abandoned the defence as useless and retreated. A portion of Tippu’s army under Lally, attacked the Cranganore fort, which was defended by the Travancore army under Captain Flory. Finding the defence of the fort impossible Captain Flory and his men abandoned the fort to the enemy, who demolished the fortifications the next day. Lally now proceeded to Kuriapally, which fort too was abandoned. Now the whole defensive line fell into the hands of Tippu. While this destructive warfare was going on the English regiments remained passive, on the plea that no orders have been received from the Governor of Madras to fight against the Sultan. When the orders were received, the Sultan had broken into the Travancore defensive lines. The English commander considered that the force under his command were no match for the victorious army of the Sultan, and that it would be injudicious to sacrifice his men. Seeing that the English forces did nothing to assist the Travancore army, Tippu was encouraged to march on to the interior committing devastation on his way. Devan Kesava Pillay was at Paravoor at the head of a strong force of the Travancore army with its European officers. But the advance of Tippu’s forces could not be stopped so the Devan thought it prudent to retreat.\n\nThe Sultans first object was to destroy the contemptible wall and fill up the ditch. The Sultan himself took a pick axe and set an example which was followed by everyone present and the demolition of the wall was completed by his army without much delay. The lawless force was let loose in the villages. They committed unspeakable atrocities and the country was laid to waste with fire and sword. Many of the inhabitants fled for shelter to the wild hills of Kunnathunaud, while many were taken captives. Hindu temples and Christian churches were equally desecrated. Towers of the temples, the churches, houses of the rich and poor were all burnt to ashes. All these atrocities and devastation were perpetrated with the express sanction of the Sultan, who with his main army marched southward and reached Alwaye.\n\nFortunately for the country providence intervened, the south west monsoon broke out with unusual severity, and all the rivers and streams flooded and overflowed. It rendered the Tippu army’s march impossible. As the country around is interspersed with numerous rivers and countless streams and intermixed with large paddy fields which all got submerged and the grounds slushy. The currents were so strong it was impossible even for experienced boatmen to make crossings. Tippu and his army were surprised at such a scene which they had never witnessed before and were bewildered. He had no idea what a Malabar monsoon was. His army had no shelter; no dry place; all their ammunitions and accoutrements got drenched. Even the very necessaries of life were washed away by the impetuous currents of the flooded rivers. Tippu was placed in a very awkward predicament. Having reduced to ashes every large temple, church and other edifices which could have afforded him and his army shelter and protection from the elements, Cholera, Small pox and other epidemics broke out. Provisions became scanty, and the scarcity was followed almost by famine. Numbers began to perish by disease and hunger.\n\nLord Cornwallis who was in Bengal and in charge of the military operations of the English East India Company blamed the Madras Government for neglect of duty and disobedience of orders. Tippu took exception to the military preparations made by the Madras Government and communicated the same to the Madras Governor. The Governor rejected Tippu’s claim and declared that from the moment Tippu attacked their ally, the king of Travancore, he had committed violation of the treaty. While Tippu was in his uncomfortable encampment at Alwaye, he learned that a large English force had reached Trichinopoly. He realised that there was no time to be lost. He divided his army into two divisions and ordered the retreat back to Palghaut, one portion via Chalakudy to Trichur, and the other via Cranganore and Chavakkadu to Palghaut. This hasty retreat was accompanied with the loss of a great portion of the army. This calamity was accelerated by the Travancore army under Dewan Kesava Pillay following in close pursuit.\n\nThe Travancore forces joined the British army at Palghautcherry, Coimbatore and Dindigul and fought under the command of the British officers. They fought along with the British forces against Tippu to the conclusion of the war and the treaty of Seringapatam. The East India Company demanded a large sum of money for expenses incurred by the Company’s military department in protecting Travancore against Tippu Sultan, even though in the treaty of 1788 AD it was expressly stated that Two regiments will be stationed in Travancore at the expense of Travancore State, for its protection and in the event of attack by an enemy and if additional forces are required they shall be maintained at the company’s expense entirely. King Rama Vurmah was already advanced in years and was in a troubled state of mind. Part of his country was devastated as also his army. He acquiesced to the English demand so as not to antagonise them. The king managed to pay 7 lacs in several instalments, but the British demanded 10 lacs per annum. The Devan raised another 7 lacs and in total paid 14 lacs to the British. In the negotiations, the British allowed the Travancore king the control of all the northern kingdoms under their chiefs. Devan Kesava Pillay was the chief administrator and arbitrator. In return the king of Travancore would collect from every one of these states, according to their ability, should supply Travancore Commissariat department with grain, which was to be given to the British as levy instead of the 10 lacs rupees per annum.\n\nThus slowly the British became more powerful and dictated terms to the Travancore Kingdom. They began to impose themselves in the policy of the Travancore kingdom. A new treaty with the English was concluded in 970 M.E (1795 AD). In it the powers of the king of Travancore were curtailed. It imposed on the king the obligation to abstain from all agession towards any other state. In the event of any dispute, it will be the English Company who will be the final arbitrator. It prohibited the king from allowing any one who is a citizen of a country at war with Britain or East India Company, in its territory. The king cannot enter into any engagements with any European or Indian States without the previous concurrence of the British Governments in India. When the company requires aid of troops to assist them in in war, it shall be incumbent on the reigning king to furnish such aid. This treaty was ratified in 972 M.E (1797 AD). At about this time the English having conquered the Dutch and annexed Cochin, the Dutch connection with Travancore ceased.\n\nKing Rama Vurmah ruled for a long period of 40 years. He lived to an advanced age of seventy three years and died in the year 973 M.E (1798 AD). There was only one male member in the royal family aged 16 years as the heir to the throne.\n\nKing Bala Rama Vurmah I (1798 - 1810) & Velu Thamby Dalawah\n\nBala Rama Vurmah ascended the throne at the age of sixteen years, on the death of his uncle King Rama Vurmah, in the year 973 M.E (1798 AD). He was a very weak and docile king. He was completely in the hands of favourites, among whom Sankaren Namboory, a native Brahmin from Calicut. He was an unscrupulous man. This covetous Namboory aimed for the Dewan’s post. The first steps he took was to set the young king against the old and worthy minister Kesava Dass. In 974 M.E (1799 AD) one Thottappaye Namboory of Cochin, a bosom friend of Sankaren Namboory, took advantage of this state of affairs and begged his friend to prevail upon the king to restore to Cochin the Karapuram territories annexed by Marthanda Vurmah. The document sanctioning the restoration of the Karapuram (Cherthalay district) to the Cochin Rajah, signed by the Travancore king was clandestinely handed over to Thottappaye without the knowledge of the Devan. The Devan on receiving private information of this treacherous transaction, a few hours later, made haste in pursuing the Namboory. He caught up with Thottappaye Namboory near Quilon and recovered the writ from him.\n\nA month or two after the anniversary of the late king’s death, 974 M.E (1799 AD) the Dewan was mortified to see Sankaren Namboory sitting in the State palanquin of the late king. A deep sense of reverence for the late king and a sense of duty impelled the Dewan to make strong and severe remarks on the improper conduct of the Namboory. The Namboory turned the mind of the king against the Dewan, and soon after this event, the Diwan appears to have received a commission of dismissal from the king and he was confined to his house under a guard. A few days after this the Dewan Kesava Dass was found dead in his own bed. The Dewan had no family living with him at the time of his death. It is generally believed that he was poisoned, at the instance of the Namboory, through the Dewan’s cook. In the year 975 M.E (1800 AD) when Colonel Macaulay arrived in Travancore after his appointment as Resident, he instituted an enquiry into the Dewan’s untimely death. Samprathy Kunjuneelam Pillay and others were arrested but in the absence of evidence they were discharged.\n\nThe field being clear now Sankaren Namboory prevailed upon the simple minded king to appoint him as Valia Sarvadhikariakar (prime minister) in 974 M.E 1799 AD). He selected for his council Chetty Thackalay Sankaranarayanen as finance minister and Mathoo Tharakan, an influential Syrian of the north, who held the salt, tobacco and other contracts like bringing timber grown in Malayattoor and other forests to Alleppey to sell it there, during the last reign. These two men were as unprincipled as the Namboory himself.\n\nThe financial position of the country was grave. The Namboory and his cohorts determined to remedy the financial embarrassments and thus please the young king and benefit himself at the same time. The council decided to raise a general tax. In accordance with a list which had been prepared the ministry began to summon people and demand immediate payment of the sums fixed in the list. Those who could not pay were subjected to the infamy of corporal punishment. This went on for a fortnight and a large sum of money was realised. Several respectable persons were flogged and imprisoned. In the course of these arbitrary and tyrannical proceedings, one Velu Thamy, an ex Tashildar was summoned and asked to pay an amount of 3,000 rupees (20,000 caly fanams). He informed the Namboory that he had not come there with the money and asked for three days’ time to procure the same. Velu Thamby proceeded south, and convened a meeting of all the heads of villagers in Nanjenaud. He convinced them to rise against this injustice and send emissaries as far as Alleppey for apprising the people. Velu Thamby and other leaders of the insurrection found no difficulty in inducing people to flock to their standard. The military secretly joined the assembly. Velu Thamby and his assembled multitude encamped outside the Trivandrum fort. The young king was alarmed and awakened to a sense of his duty. He deputed officials to meet Velu Thamby and the king acceded to all his demands. The Namboory prime minister was immediately dismissed and banished from the kingdom. Sankara Narayanen and Mathoo Tharakan were publicly flogged and their ears cut off and imprisoned. The unlawful taxes were withdrawn.\n\nSheraingheel Iyappen Chempaka Ramen Pillay was appointed as Valia Sarvadhikariakar (prime minister). Velu Thamby received the post of commercial minister. The new prime minister was an able and experienced man. He lost no time in all the evils introduced by the evil Namboory. He re-established the confidence of the people in the administration. Chempaka Ramen Pillay died 14 months after his appointment and was succeeded by Parachalay Padmanabhen Chempaka Ramen Pillay. He was not very able and was relived from office after eight months. There were two able men for the post of prime minister, Thamby Chempaka Ramen Cumaren and Erayimen, both related to the late Dewan Kesava Dass. But Kunjuneelam Pillay and his colleagues who were friends of Velu Thamby began to plot against them. The timid king consulted with Velu Thamby who had become Sarvadhikariakar by now. They were arrested on charges of treason along with Padmanabha Pillay and Neelam Pillay. Immediately after this, Velu Thamby was appointed Prime Minister (Valia Sarvadhikariakar). He proceeded to Alleppey to hold his office there, like Dewan Kesava Dass. Subsequent to the departure of the Prime Minister the death warrant of the two officers were signed. They were on a certain night dragged by the palace guards to the sea-beach and butchered in cold blood. This event took place in 976 M.E (1801 AD). Padmanabha Pillay and Neelam Pillay who were in confinement were sent to Mavelikara, but on the way Neelam Pillay jumped overboard at Anjengo bar and escaped. Padmanabha Pillay was executed on reaching Mavelikara. It is certain the Kunjuneelam Pillay who filled the office of the palace Samprathy (secretary) was the head of the cabal that effected the atrocious and disgraceful murder of the general (Thamby Chempaka Ramen Cumaren) who was the younger brother of Dewan Kesava Dass and the peishcar (Erayimen) the nephew of Dewan Kesava Dass. Kunjuneelam Pillay had considerable influence over the ignorant king who was immersed in pleasures and devoted his time to seraglio (harem) and the ceremonies of superstition.\n\nVelu Thamby was appointed Dalawah in 977 M.E (1802 AD), and he began a career unprecedented in many respects. He was a man of extraordinary ability and talents. He was bold and daring. Though his career had every appearance of despotism and cruelty, he was honest and fair. The first step he took was to establish order among the people, and ensure honest performance of their duties by the Sircar servants throughout the kingdom. To this effect he adopted punishments far exceeding the severity prescribed by the law of the country. The whole service was at once cleansed and corruption eradicated. Fraudulent appropriation of Sircar money was punished by incarceration in jails for lengthened periods, and even with death in addition to the forfeiture of the whole property belonging to the family of the delinquent without regard to the amount of fraud or embezzlement. Tampering with the Sircar records were punished with amputation of the palms or fingers of the right hand of the criminal. Bribery was punished with the infliction of corporal punishment on the back of the delinquent in public places. Perjury (the act of wilfully telling an untruth when on oath) was punished by cutting off the lips and nose of the criminal. Oppression of peasants or tenant farmers was visited with corporal punishment and forfeiture of property. This latter punishment was resorted to in almost every case where a Sarkar servant was convicted. Robbers and thieves were alike punished with the extreme penalty of the law. Pick-pocketing and lock breaking entailed on the criminals the loss of their palms or fingers. The violation of females and the offence of rape were often punished the offenders being beheaded. Stealing was general punished with flogging and in special cases with amputation, impalement or"
