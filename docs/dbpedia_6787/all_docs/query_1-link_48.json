        "text": "My first day back in Chennai, a wonderful city where I'm teaching for an eighth successive year. And what do I come across just outside where I am staying?\n\n​This unholy trinity: Ambedkar, Periyar, Marx.\n\nThey were on the back of Ganesh's auto-rick. And he was very happy to get out of his auto - I confess I interrupted his snooze - to be photographed with his political icons.\n\nB.R. Ambedkar (1891-1956) is the great political hero of India's Dalits and a distinguished jurist who was the main figure in the drafting of India's constitution.\n\nPeriyar (1879-1973) is regarded as the founder of the Dravidian moverment in Tamil Nadu, and renowned as an opponent of caste privilege and as a crusading atheist.\n\nAnd Karl Marx (1818-1883) is the German-born political philosopher who gave his name to Marxism and is regarded as providing the ideological foundations of communism.\n\n​The quote in Tamil which accompanies the three stylised portraits is from Ambedkar.\n\nWhen you think of communism in India, Kerala springs to mind - the only state which currently has a communist chief minister; and also West Bengal, which was for decades a CP stronghold, though not any longer.\n\nBut of the five seats in the directly elected house of the Indian Parliament currently held by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and its rivals the Communist Party of India, four represent constituencies in Tamil Nadu.\n\n​That's not because Tamil Nadu is inclining to the hard left, more a result of both parties' place in an alliance led by the DMK, the centre-left party which currently dominates Tamil politics."
