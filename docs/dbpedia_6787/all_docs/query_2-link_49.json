        "text": "IN the early 1930s, a young Brahmin from south Kerala gave up not only his enormous inherited property but also the mental encumbrance of the supremacy of the caste to which he was born to enter public life. For the next seven decades, whether in power or out of it, EMS was a frame of social and intellectual reference. In the late '60s, he started off in Kerala a political fashion of coalition governments which India was to adopt several years later. Ironically, he died within hours of the BJP, a party that he loathed and branded as Enemy No. 1, taking over power in Delhi on March 19."
