        "text": "In an unfortunate development, Kerala's veteran politician and member of the first Communist government headed by E M S Namboodiripad in 1957, K R Gowri Amma died in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday. She was 102.\n\nWhat happened to the legendary Communist leader?\n\nLegendary Communist leader K R Gowri Amma had been admitted to a private hospital due to age-related ailments.\n\nHow Gowri Amma died?\n\nShe breathed her last at 7 am on Tuesday while undergoing treatment in the ICU, hospital sources said, as per a report in PTI.\n\nGowri Amma: One of the most powerful women leaders in Kerala\n\n-Considered to be among the most powerful women leaders in Kerala, Gowri Amma, as she was fondly called, was the lone surviving member of the first Kerala legislative assembly.\n\n-After being expelled from the CPI(M) in 1994, Gowri floated a new political outfit -- Janathipathiya Samrakshana Samithi (JSS) -- which became a constituent of the Congress-led UDF in the state.\n\nShe was married to the late T V Thomas, who was also her cabinet colleague.\n\n-Gowri, who was the revenue minister in EMS Namboodiripad ministry, is credited with playing a key role in bringing the revolutionary Agrarian Relations Bill, which set the ceiling on the amount of land a family could own, paving the way for the landless farmers to claim excess land.\n\n-After the split in the Communist Party in 1964, Gowri joined the CPI (Marxist), while her husband remained with the CPI.\n\n-Born on July 14, 1919 in the sleepy Pattanakkad village of coastal Alappuzha to K A Ramanan and Parvathy Amma, Gowri was attracted to politics at a young age.\n\n-She was jailed in 1948, the year she joined the Communist Party, and defied adversities to build the organisation.\n\n-Gowri, the tallest woman politician of the state who never minced words to put her thoughts across, was elected to the Travancore-Cochin legislative assembly in 1952 and 1954.\n\n-After her successful foray to the state legislature in 1957 from Cherthala in Alappuzha, there was no looking back.\n\nChief Minister of Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan, tweeted, \"Com. K R Gauri was a brave fighter, dedicated her life to end exploitation, build an egalitarian society. She made seminal contributions in building the Communist movement & as an administrator. Let's show respects, by pledging to build a more progressive society. Red Salute!\""
