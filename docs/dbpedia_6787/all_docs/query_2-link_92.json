During his early years, he was fighted against the casteism and conservatism that existed in the Namboothiri community. That days, he became the active member of Valluvanadu Yogaskshema Sabha, an organization of progressive Namboothiri youth. In his college life, he was associated with Indian National Congress and Indian Independence Movement.
