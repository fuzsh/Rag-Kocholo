It serves as the administrative centre for the Perinthalmanna taluk, as well as a revenue division, a community development block, and a police sub-division bearing the same name.[2] It was formerly the headquarters of Valluvanad Taluk, which was one of the two Taluks in the Malappuram Revenue Division of the erstwhile Malabar District during the British Raj.[3] The city is located 23 kilometres (14 mi) southwest of the city of Malappuram at the centre of the Kozhikode–Malappuram–Perinthalmanna–Palakkad National Highway 966.[4]\n\nIt is one of the major commercial centers in the Malappuram district but is not a part of the Malappuram metropolitan area.\n\nThe city is home to several medical institutions and one of the three branches of Aligarh Muslim University in India, which is popularly known as AMU Malappuram Campus.[5][6][7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nPerinthalmanna(peru-major ,thallu-fight or marshal arts manna-area centre) and the neighbouring town of Angadipuram served as the capital of the Valluvanad Swaroopam dynasty.[8] Valluvanad was ruled by a Samanthan Nair clan known as Vellodis, similar to the Eradis of neighbouring Eranad and the Nedungadis of Nedunganad.
