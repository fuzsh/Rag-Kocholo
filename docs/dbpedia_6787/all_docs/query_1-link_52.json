        "text": "Kerala, known as “God’s Own Country,” has a rich political history marked by a succession of prominent leaders who have held the position of Chief Minister. Over the decades, these leaders have played a pivotal role in shaping the socio-economic and political landscape of the state. Here is a comprehensive list of former Chief Ministers who have contributed significantly to the development and progress of Kerala.\n\nChief Ministers of Kerala\n\nKerala, established on November 1, 1956, through the States Reorganisation Act, emerged by amalgamating Cochin, Malabar, Travancore, and the Kasaragod region of South Canara. Initially under governor rule, E. M. S. Namboodiripad of the Communist Party of India became the first Chief Minister in 1957. Presently, Pinarayi Vijayan holds the position since 2016. Kerala witnessed 12 Chief Ministers with intermittent periods of President’s rule. The predominant ruling parties have been the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Indian National Congress.\n\nFirst Chief Minister of Kerala\n\nE. M. S. Namboodiripad, representing the Communist Party of India, assumed office as Kerala’s inaugural Chief Minister in 1957. His leadership marked the commencement of Kerala’s political journey, following the state’s formation through the merging of various princely states and regions under the States Reorganisation Act.\n\nCurrent Chief Minister of Kerala\n\nPinarayi Vijayan has been serving as the Chief Minister of Kerala since 2016. Throughout his tenure, Vijayan has spearheaded initiatives aimed at fostering development, ensuring social equity, and promoting sustainable governance practices. Under his leadership, Kerala continues to navigate challenges while striving for comprehensive growth and prosperity across the state.\n\nLongest Serving Chief Minister of Kerala\n\nE.K. Nayanar holds the distinction of being Kerala’s longest-serving Chief Minister, with an impressive tenure of nearly 11 years in office. Known for his astute leadership and commitment to public service, Nayanar’s tenure was marked by significant contributions to the state’s development and welfare initiatives.\n\nShortest Serving Chief Minister of Kerala\n\nC. H. Mohammed Koya holds the record for the shortest tenure as Chief Minister of Kerala, serving for a mere 53 days. Despite the brevity of his time in office, Koya’s leadership left an impact on the state’s political landscape. His brief tenure underscores the volatility of Kerala’s political environment during that period.\n\nList of Former Chief Ministers of Kerala (1956-2024)\n\nKerala witnessed 12 Chief Ministers with intermittent periods of President’s rule. The predominant ruling parties have been the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Indian National Congress.\n\nHere is the complete list of former Chief Ministers of Kerala from 1956 to 2024:"
