        "text": "Perinthalmanna\n\nPerinthalmanna was the capital city of Valluvanad, a princely state ruled by the Valluvakonathiris. It is an important municipal town in Malapuram district and was known as the centre of trading activities. The birth place of veteran communist leader late EMS Namboodiripad, Elamkulam, is close to Perinthalmanna.\n\nThe first High school, first court and first Taluk office of the Malabar area were set up in Perinthalmanna by the East India Company. Perinthalmanna has many educational institutions and hospitals including a Medical College. Apart from the Government Hospital, there are a few private hospitals like Al-Shifa, Al-Salama, Moulana, etc. attracting patients from other parts of Kerala.\n\nThe National Highway No. 966 (Old NH 213) from Palakkad to Kozhikode passes through Perinthalmanna. There are plenty of private and KSRTC buses available to various destinations like Kozhikode, Palakkad, Thrissur, Guruvayur, Nilambur, Manjeri, Malappuram, Ottapalam, etc. A few inter-state buses also operate on this route. As the Calicut International Airport at Karippur is situated near to this highway, airline passengers from Ottapalam, Palakkad, Mannarkkad and Cherpulassery pass through Perinthalmanna. Angadipuram is the nearest railway station on the Shoranur - Nilambur line, which is 3 km away from Perinthalmanna.\n\nKodikuthimala and Pathaikkara are the important tourist spots in this area.
