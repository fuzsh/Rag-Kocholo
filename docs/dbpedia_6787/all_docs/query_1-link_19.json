        "text": "Marxism-Leninism and the Bourgeois Judiciary\n\nAuthor: E.M.S. Namboodiripad\n\nIn February 1968, the High Court of Kerala held E.M.S. Namboodiripad in contempt for certain ‘offensive’ remarks about the judiciary he had made publicly on November 9, 1967.

When he returns home, his children throw themselves on his bulk, demanding he read Shakespeare or the Grimm’s Fairy Tales to them.
