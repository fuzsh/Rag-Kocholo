        "text": "This year isn’t likely to be remembered for its television. Sure, TV will play its part in setting the historical record, but in an election year that’s also an Olympics year that’s also the second year in which Ben Affleck lost J. Lo (supposedly!), television will be critical in how we process 2024’s big events more than it will be remembered for producing its own entertainment and/or artistry. (Heck, I didn’t even mention Caitlin Clark!)\n\nBut boy, is it putting up a fight. The first half of 2024 is replete with admirable, ambitious, and downright astounding series. Lulu Wang’s “Expats” and Issa Lopez’s “True Detective: Night Country” kicked off the year with a staggering one-two combination. “Shōgun” was right on their heels, along with the surprise sensation “Baby Reindeer” and the long-anticipated “Mr. and Mrs. Smith.”\n\nAs Emmy season approached, the hits just kept on coming: Comedy lovers got “Hacks,” “Girls5Eva,” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” Fantasy fans were gifted “Interview with the Vampire,” “The Acolyte,” and “The Boys.” Telephiles rightly fawned over “The Sympathizer,” Ripley,” and “We Are Lady Parts.” Heck, even Ryan Murphy produced a good season of TV.\n\nGreat shows take top priority, of course, but there have also been signs of life in the industry’s ailing corners. Broadcast TV delivered (and renewed) an exciting new procedural in “Elsbeth.” Netflix unearthed a bonafide hit in “Baby Reindeer” and elevated experimental breakthroughs like “Scavengers Reign” (a former Max original) and “Everybody’s in L.A.” (a late-night talk show that finally clicked). The Oscars, or at least Ryan Gosling, was good. So were the Emmys (the first one, anyway.)"
