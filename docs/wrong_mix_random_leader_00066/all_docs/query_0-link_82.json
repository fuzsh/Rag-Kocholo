        "text": "Behind the Headlines Not so long ago, John Stankey could hardly answer when asked to name a TV show or movie that he liked. But the 54-year-old head of AT&T’s entertainment group — who will run Time Warner, assuming AT&T’s $85.4 billion acquisition wins federal approval, as expected — says it became clear to him in the past year or two that he had to buckle down and watch some entertainment. “I realized I had to spend more time getting exposed to what’s out there,” he tells THR in his first interview since he was tapped July 28 to run the to-be-renamed Time Warner. “It’s part of my work routine.” But he still doesn’t seem to have much of a list of favorites. Looking for programs to watch with his wife of…\n\nBehind the Headlines As Donald Trump wages war against “fake news,” his administration has been elevating conservative media to fill the void — and not just the Murdochs’ Fox News Channel. One of the outlets now getting White House attention? The Christian Broadcasting Network, dedicated to preparing “the nations of the world for the coming of Jesus Christ.” While CBN’s news division has had a Washington, D.C., bureau since the 1980s, the office recently was renovated and 10 staff positions — including correspondents, videographers and producers — have been added since Trump’s election. CBN founder Pat Robertson, 87, interviewed Trump on July 12 in what CNN noted at the time was the president’s first non-Fox News interview in two months. Trump said he’s mistreated by the mainstream media, but, he told Robertson, “That’s…\n\nGoodman Elisabeth Moss proves labels are unnecessary if you make the writing (and anyone in a shared scene) better, which she does in each role. Pamela Adlon morphed through the trials and tribulations of her self-defining series Better Things, raw and honest in every moment. Thandie Newton’s slow-burn, transitive awakening in Westworld took her from deep ensemble character to changemaking star. Fienberg In a cast of Emmy royalty, Jackie Hoffman stole every Feud scene with withering glances and perfectly timed Hollywood weariness. The Leftovers was her leading-lady turn, but Carrie Coon’s Fargo work soared with a precise accent, priceless reactions and stealthy emotion. The beloved Star Wars actress appeared in only one Catastrophe episode this season, but Carrie Fisher’s acid wit loomed large. DOWD: RICH FURY/GETTY IMAGES. LEFTOVERS: BEN KING/HBO.

HOFFMAN: KURT…\n\nI didn’t understand the relationship between the son and the father,” says Callum Turner of his starring role in Marc Webb’s The Only Living Boy in New York (out Aug. 11 from Amazon and Roadside). “It was completely alien to me.” Raised by a single mother, a club promoter, in what he calls “the less shiny end” of West London’s affluent Chelsea, Turner hoped to someday play soccer professionally — but it was his mother who introduced him to movies. “She figured she could have a break if she put me in front of the TV,” he says, “and that’s where my love of film came from.” Now, after getting noticed in a string of indies — Queen & Country, Green Room and Tramps — he is making the leap…\n\nLunch Order Maple Block Meat Co., the 2-year-old barbecue joint a short stroll from NFL Network in Culver City, says that Hollywood — from shows (Silicon Valley, Jimmy Kimmel Live!) to agencies (CAA, UTA) and studios (Sony, Fox) — accounts for 35 percent of its $400,000 annual catering business, which jumps about 15 percent in the summer months. The secret’s in the sauce, or perhaps the business plan: Backers include onetime Everybody Loves Raymond producer and I’ll Have What Phil’s Having host Phil Rosenthal.…\n\nHave You Been Invited to Magic Tuesday? Everyone Else Has Magic Tuesday might be the coolest industry gathering you’ve never heard of. Since 2016, Danny Samit, director of current series at FX, has entertained five to 10 VIPs (with more than 200 attending to date) with cocktails, food and magic nearly weekly at Hollywood’s Magic Castle. Samit typically ends the night as the star performer. “No one knows who is coming until they arrive,” he says of his guests — execs from networks, streamers, agencies and companies like Annapurna and The Weinstein Co. as well as talent from Atlanta, This Is Us and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. “Danny is hands down the best TV exec I’ve ever seen perform close-up magic,” quips Kimmel writer Josh Halloway. Adds This Is Us coexecutive producer…\n\nExecutive Suite At first glance, it’s hard to tell Warren Littlefield, 65, ever had another job before becoming a TV producer. His sun-soaked Santa Monica office is filled with mementos from his two latest endeavors: blankets, snow globes and, yes, that’s Nikki Swango’s iconic fur coat from FX’s Fargo along with press packets, look books and a premiere invite for Hulu breakout The Handmaid’s Tale. But look closely: Hanging in the corner is a photocopy of the Seinfeld testing sheet — a small window into the two decades the New Jersey native spent at NBC, the last nine as president of entertainment. Since leaving the network in 1998, Littlefield, who’s married with two adult children, has traded in Must See TV for Peak TV, teaming with platforms like FX and Hulu that…\n\nFor more than a decade, the plot of land along Santa Monica Boulevard on the lot adjacent to The Beverly Hilton sat idle, bedeviling a number of developers — including Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim — whose plans to develop the site where a Robinsons-May store once stood always seemed to unravel. So when the Dalian Wanda Group finally won approval in November to build a $1.2 billion hotel and condominium development there known as One Beverly Hills, it appeared the Chinese conglomerate had done what few financial titans before it could pull off. But now, given the precariousness of Wanda Group’s finances, the question of the moment is: Can the One Beverly Hills project survive, and if not, has the curse of this parcel of land returned? No, it hasn’t, a source…\n\nThe red-hot writer, producer, di rector, rapper and now mov ie s tar takes a brea k f rom Lando dut ies in London (where the Star Wars ’ Han Solo spinof f is underway) to d issect h is ext raordinar y r i se (‘you have t o conv ince them that you spea k old white man’), t hose Atlanta Emmy noms and h is planned Hol lywood takeover: ‘They don’t know what I know’ “It was hard to get FX to understand what I was doing [with Atlanta] at first. I had to, for lack of a better term, lie about it in a lot of ways because I was like, ‘If you hear this, it’s not going to sound good. It’s going to sound crazy,’ ”…\n\nOn April 21, Jimmy Kimmel and wife Molly McNearney welcomed their son, William “Billy” John, into the world, only to learn that he had a rare heart defect. At just 3 days old, Billy underwent emergency surgery at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. And in a tearful monologue 10 days later on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the host shared his ordeal with viewers, along with a plea on behalf of the Affordable Care Act: an emotional 13-minute speech that transfixed the nation and rocked the health care debate. Three months later, Kimmel offers an update on his son, more praise for the heroics at Children’s Hospital and some (very) cautious optimism about the future of health care. How’s Billy doing? He’s doing great. Young Billy made his first visit to our office today. He’s…\n\nFox 2000’s Hidden Figures, the Oscarnominated film about black female mathematicians who helped NASA put a man into space, may be long gone from theaters, but its impact is still being felt around the world. For the first time in the history of the U.S. State Department, Hollywood has inspired a program, #HiddenNoMore, that will bring 50 women working in science, technology, engineering and math — in countries from Cameroon to Mongolia — to the U.S. “This movie has sparked things we’ve never seen before,” says Liba Rubenstein, head of social impact for 21st Century Fox. “There has been no end to the demand for partnerships.” A few months after Hidden Figures’ 2016 release, the State Department called Fox saying it was being deluged with requests from embassies. In April and…\n\n→ A few years ago, Mike DeWitt was working on a gala video for The Gabriella Foundation, which funds dance instruction for underserved L.A. kids. DeWitt, whose Human Interest Films has done similar work for organizations from the L.A. Dodgers Foundation to the Saban Community Clinic, looked forward to feedback on an early rough cut from one of Gabriella’s board members, Meg Kasdan, and her husband, Lawrence. But the Oscar-nominated auteur, stone-faced, told DeWitt the video “needed a lot of work.” As if the stakes for a charity video weren’t high enough — the more powerful the reel, the more guests often give to the cause — in Hollywood, among those guests are likely to lurk some of cinema’s most skilled storytellers. THR spoke to DeWitt and Scott Mauro — who’s…\n\nnearly a decade after Scientology prompted a high-profile internet protest movement — sparked when the church attempted to remove a damaging YouTube video of member Tom Cruise speaking about the religion — comes the discovery of a new covert campaign to subvert online criticism of the organization’s social work. A series of forged court orders were submitted to Google (and possibly to Yahoo and Bing as well) in 2016 in an attempt to convince the search giant to expunge links to written objections to Scientology’s controversial anti-drug program Narconon. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment when asked whether it is investigating the issue, which involves the bogus signatures of judges from multiple states. Collectively, the material seeks to mend the standing of unbranded Narconon facilities in Michigan and their…\n\nThe Emmy race for outstanding reality competition program used to run like a Swiss watch. Six series would be nominated, an assortment of usual suspects (CBS’Survivor, Fox’sAmerican Idol) among them, and come the big night, the prize would always go to CBS stalwartThe Amazing Race. Producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Bertram van Munster offered perfected pageant waves, and the gang would all come back the following year with the assumption of a repeat. It was a streak that essentially lasted a decade beforeThe Voicefinally quashed it with consecutive wins in 2015 and 2016. Frontrunner status in the once-locked category now belongs to Mark Burnett’s NBC singing competition, and the field has finally opened up to more than just legacy shows. In 2016, NBC’sAmerican Ninja Warriorswiped a slot from Fox’s agingSo You…\n\nOn Aug. 7, the HBO data breach took a troubling turn as hackers leaked emails of a network executive in what they dubbed a second wave of dumps. To that point, the company had kept the leaks contained by deploying an army of bots to pull down leaked content. But with pilfered emails, HBO has fewer options to fight the spread. “There are a lot of tools now to rapidly respond when something that violates copyright law pops up on the internet, thanks to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,” says Nathaniel Gleicher, former director of cybersecurity policy for the Obama White House and ex-senior counsel for the U.S. Department of Justice’s computer crimes division. “With emails, it’s not exactly clear.” With the first wave of dumps, HBO was able to play a…\n\nThough they might be among the most reviled figures by Hollywood’s largely liberal crowd, the Koch brothers have been silent investors in Warner Bros.’ slate of movies for four years. Sources say Charles G. Koch and David H. Koch — who are worth a combined $96.2 billion and wield enormous power in backing conservative politicians — took a significant stake valued at tens of millions of dollars in RatPac- Dune Entertainment, the finance vehicle fronted by Brett Ratner and Len Blavatnik (formerly James Packer). As part of a $450 million deal struck in 2013, now-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin brought the brothers in — a move that was never disclosed because RatPac- Dune is a private company. Though Mnuchin is no longer involved with the slate financing facility, having recently put…\n\nChasing Space (AMISTAD, MAY 23) BY Leland Melvin AGENCY CAA In this inspirational memoir about his adventure-packed life, Melvin, an NFL player turned astronaut, traces his journey from the football field to outer space and the struggles he had to overcome (including a severe injury that left him deaf) along the way. The Talented Ribkins (MELVILLE HOUSE, AUG. 8) BY Ladee Hubbard AGENCY Paradigm Toni Morrison gave a glowing endorsement to this magical realism spin on W.E.B. Du Bois’ 1903 influential leadership essay “The Talented Tenth.” In Hubbard’s debut novel, a family of superpowered civil rights activists turns to petty crime.…\n\nPeople, Places, Preoccupations S he spent more than two decades as a gossip columnist for New York and, later, MSNBC, but once Jeannette Walls published a best-selling memoir about her harrowing childhood, The Glass Castle (Lionsgate’s film adaptation opens Aug. 11), she started picking up a different kind of intel about her subjects. “I stuck a microphone in this celebrity’s face and asked her who designed her outfit, and she told me,” she recalls of one night on the red carpet. “Then she — a very famous woman — asked me to turn the microphone off and thanked me for writing the book, saying it really helped her come to terms with her own father’s alcoholism.” Walls, 57, laid down the poison pen soon after. “I don’t condemn anybody who does…\n\n“I play a character in movies, but I also play a public character.” ANNA FARIS The Mom star, in her podcast days before announcing her split from husband Chris Pratt, revealing “it never feels like me” on the red carpet. “There’s definitely a loneliness.” “We think there’s a way to have our cake and eat it too.” LESLIE MOONVES The CBS CEO, telling analysts on an Aug. 7 earnings call that “Netflix getting 50 million international” subscribers inspired him to take CBS content direct to consumers via CBS All Access. “[He] let me know that his office was his favorite place to have sex.” CAROLINE HELDMAN The politics professor, in a Facebook post detailing unwanted sexual advances from Fox News host Eric Bolling after she was a guest on his show.

The question is prompting frank conversations among those in the TV industry. “It’s all fair in love and television writing,” says Master of None actor-writer Lena Waithe, “as long as it’s good, not exploitative and not ill-intentioned.” The current conversation was sparked by HBO’s July 19 announcement that its most successful showrunners, Game of Thrones’ David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, would make Confederate, a drama that imagines a modern-day Confederacy with an intact slavery industry. Two weeks later, Amazon revealed the details of Black America, its long-in-theworks drama with producer Will Packer and Boondocks creator Aaron McGruder. It’s another contemporary-set…\n\nMy batsuit is bigger. Fitness W ith age comes wisdom, but survey Hollywood’s growing crop of middleaged action stars and you’ll likely conclude that age also brings huge pecs and massive delts. As franchises Mission: Impossible (which debuted in 1996), The Fast and the Furious (2001) and Iron Man and the Marvel universe it spawned (2008) continue to churn out sequels, their stars Tom Cruise, 55, Vin Diesel, 50, and Robert Downey Jr., 52, have to look as ripped as they did when they took the role. Often more so. Because even as the stars age, body standards are getting more extreme. “Historically, the ideal superhero or action star was constructed around a sturdy build and a ruggedly handsome face,” says Philip Goglia, the nutritionist behind Chris Pratt’s miraculous transformation for Guardians of…\n\nAs you enter Stephen Glover’s apartment, your eyes can’t help but settle on a cluttered corner to the right of the door. Mixed in with several pairs of shoes, some booze, a few pieces of musical equipment, a stack of papers, a framed poster fromAtlanta’s first season and a slice or two of day-old pizza sits a pair of Golden Globe statues and a collection of Writers Guild awards. Somewhere else in the Hollywood apartment, which he shares with his buddy Swank, also a writer onAtlanta, is the AFI award the show earned in January. And come mid-September,an Emmy or two could join the collection. “It’s all just so crazy,” says Stephen, 29, who had never written an episode of TV before Donald enlisted him to join the staff. “I’m sure…\n\nn a town where the charity circuit once turned on six-figure bids for VIP experiences at industry galas, Omaze — the 5-year-old brainchild of Stanford grads Matt Pohlson and Ryan Cummins — has become a go-to philanthropy partner. Nearly every Hollywood shop, from AMC to Lucasfilm, has created an Omaze campaign (as have stars including Ben Stiller, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Charlize Theron), offering fans the chance to bid as little as $10 online for everything from lunch with Robert Downey Jr. on the Avengers set to a date with George Clooney. Pohlson and Cummins’ first campaign, in 2012, raised less than $1,000, but a breakthrough came in 2013 when they raised $1.8 million for anti-bullying organization Kind Campaign (the prize: a screening of the Breaking Bad finale with stars Bryan Cranston…\n\n→ At WME-IMG’s January retreat, where the agency announced a partnership with UNICEF — the brainchild of Tascha Rudder, who directs WME-IMG’s foundation — it was comedian and YouTube star Lilly Singh who represented the client roster on a panel about the initiatifirst digital influencer to be given this honor.” Toronto-born Singh, 28, who will appear in HBO’s Fahrenheit 451 , boasts 12 million subscribers on YouTube, where she goes by Superwoman. In India, where more than half of 1.3 billion citizens are younger than 25, she hopes to have a unique impact. She spoke to THR about what her trip taught her as an activist and entertainer. On my trip, I was eager to see a part of India I had never visited and to jump in on issues of…\n\nJames Cromwell, the 77-year-old star of such films as L.A. Confidential and the upcoming Jurassic World sequel, has been an activist for environmental causes, animal rights and civil rights for five decades. He’s been arrested multiple times for protesting — most recently with PETA (a group he’s worked with since his Oscarnominated turn in 1995’s Babe) at San Diego’s Sea World on July 25 — and even slips his mission into his movies. “For Jurassic World, I fought to get a line in about why our systems tend to go haywire and we lose control of the science,” he says. “I’m hoping that it stays in.” His July 31 interview with THR is his first since serving three days at New York’s Orange County Correctional Facility, after refusing to pay…\n\nIn their second year at bat, James Corden, 38, and his Late Late Show executive producers, Ben Winston, 35, and Rob Crabbe, 42, nabbed their second consecutive variety talk Emmy nomination — and scored another repeat in the interactive program category for their breakout Carpool Karaoke (which won its race last year and is about to spin off on Apple Music). The three partners recently chatted about how they’ve evolved their winning formula. JAMES CORDEN We were all in different places when the Emmy nominations came in. Where were you and how did you feel? BEN WINSTON I was annoyed because I couldn’t get hold of Rob because Rob was in bed, fast asleep, not replying to any texts or picking up his phone. I was nervous that we might not get…\n\nThere’s a new belle at the Emmys ball. Coming off a dark-horse win last year for outstanding host for a reality or reality competition program, RuPaul, 56, now sees his Drag Race enter this year’s Emmys as a heavyweight. In its first outing since graduating from Logo to VH1, Drag Race was showered with seven nominations (plus an eighth for its aftershow, RuPaul’s Drag Race: Untucked, in the unstructured reality category). They include, not surprisingly, nods for the show’s eye-popping hair and makeup; a second nom for RuPaul’s hosting duties; and, most significantly, a shot at the competition prize. As a fog of intolerance rolls over America, the timing feels especially right for a show like Drag Race — a cross-dressing decathlon with a punk-rock spirit — to take the…\n\nFilm RELEASE DATE Friday, Aug. 11 (Lionsgate) CAST Brie Larson, Woody Harrelson, Naomi Watts, Max Greenfield, Sarah Snook, Robin Bartlett, Ella Anderson, Chandler Head DIRECTOR Destin Daniel Cretton Rated PG-13, 127 minutes The ties that bind often embarrass or even shame, a near-universal reality that writer Jeannette Walls explored, unforgettably, through the extreme example of her childhood. Her 2005 book, The Glass Castle, is equal parts loving tribute and pained confessional, resisting sentimentalism at every turn. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mostly manages to do the same, though his concessions to the expectation for big-movie moments deliver occasionally strained results. Still, the feature, which reunites the filmmaker with his ShortTerm 12 star, Brie Larson, captures the essence of the memoir, with exceptionally potent work by Woody Harrelson and Naomi Watts as Rex and Rose Mary, the spirited,…\n\nAfter Berlin Station and Graves, the third time’s the charm for Epix’s scripted series: Get Shorty is absolutely top-notch. Creator-writer Davey Holmes (Shameless, In Treatment, Damages) understands what made Elmore Leonard’s novel (and the subsequent 1995 film starring John Travolta) work, and he has preserved the story’s central conceit: that crime and the film industry may actually be defined by the same low moral standards. But he tweaks the source material into his own distinctive tale of thieves and Hollywood intersecting, pulling off a tricky tonal balancing act that never falters in the first three episodes. Things kick off confidently, with a brilliantly shot pilot directed by Allen Coulter (The Sopranos) that showcases tour de force turns from Chris O’Dowd (Bridesmaids, Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children) and Ray Romano. O’Dowd plays…\n\nAmericans are cutting the cable cord at an alarming rate, and it could get worse. At least that’s the message from second-quarter earnings reports, and Wall Street appears a bit spooked, with shares of Comcast, Charter Communications, Dish Network and AT&T (home of DirecTV) all down in the first week of August. Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson estimates a whopping 941,000 subscribers cut the cord during the quarter, up from 809,000 in the same time frame a year earlier, a clear indication cord-cutting is accelerating. “The rate of pay TV subscriber erosion worsened, rising sequentially from 2.5 percent last quarter to 2.7 percent in the second quarter, the fastest rate of decline on record,” notes Moffett. The major providers have been countering the decline with skinny bundles of TV channels online through services…\n\nBehind the Headlines EMMY: THE RACE Iheard the term very early in my career. It was at lunch with an agent — not my agent but one of several on my team at the time — and at one point she just looked over at me and said: “Well, let’s face it. You’re a character actor.” This was not meant as a compliment. What she was saying, what most people mean when they call you a character actor, is that you’re going to live off of small parts. There are no lead roles in your future. Whatever is meant by it and regardless of who it comes from, it’s come to have no relevance to me. It’s a label, a category. And what most actors come into the world with, in my opinion,…\n\nHOW WME-IMG WILL SPEND ITS NEW $1.1B INVESTMENTS IN FILM, TV AND THEATER Deal of the Week What to do with $1.1 billion in cash?

To mark its 18th birthday, MrSkin.com, the web’s top repository of mainstream screen nudity, erected a billboard July 30 at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and La Brea Avenue featuring screenshots from all 43,412 female nude scenes on its servers. “We launched on Aug. 10, 1999 — we’re joking that we’re finally legal,” says Mr. Skin himself, CEO Jim McBride, a 54-year-old father of three from Chicago. The site, which sees 9 million uniques per month and costs $72 a year for full access, hit the big time when Judd Apatow heard McBride on The Howard Stern Show and wrote it into 2007’s Knocked Up — “the second-best movie product placement of all time, after E.T. and…\n\nThe Red Carpet Aug. 2 TCA Awards Beverly Hills, Aug. 5 Laugh Out Loud Los Angeles, Aug. 3 Party Crawler HFPA’s Golden Giveaways “Let’s celebrate the three things Donald Trump hates the most: foreigners, the press and actually giving money to charity,” host Chelsea Handler (1) deadpanned at the Beverly Wilshire, where the group, which also gives out the Golden Globe Awards, bestowed $2.8 million to education and entertainment nonprofits.

The most high-profile pacts have involved some of the biggest brands in both China and Hollywood, such as real estate behemoth Dalian Wanda, which bought Legendary Entertainment for $3.5 billion in 2016 and owns leading U.S. cinema exhibitor AMC Entertainment; internet giant Alibaba, which in October took an equity stake in Steven Spielberg’s shingle Amblin; China Media Capital, which owns part of Brian Grazer and Ron Howard’s Imagine Entertainment; and Fosun, financiers of Jeff Robinov’s Studio 8.

Now, with its grand opening a year away, Caruso has revealed its first restaurant to THR — an outpost of Hollywood favorite Madeo (Leslie Moonves and Matt Damon are regulars at the Beverly Boulevard original), which has committed to 4,000 square feet for a spinoff called FdeiM by Madeo (a nod to the Italian city, Forte dei Marme, from which the eatery’s founding Vietina family hail). “The plan has always been to find best-in-class retailers and restaurateurs and do something unique,” says Caruso. “We have a whole bunch of…\n\n‘A PRO BONO AMAZON’ FOR MOMS IN NEED Jessica Alba, Julie Bowen and Kelly Rowland are among the stars who’ve joined Baby2Baby in providing crucial items and support to at-risk families across L.A. Molly Sims is getting a little teary. “I have three children under 4. It’s so sad what these families go through,” says the model and wife of Netflix Original Films head Scott Stuber. She’s sitting with a few dozen other women — actresses (Julie Bowen, Michelle Monaghan), talent reps, interior and fashion and jewelry designers, and wives of producers and hedge funders — at the April board meeting of Baby2Baby, which in the past six years has grown into one of L.A.’s most high-profile philanthropies. The women take turns talking about why they serve as “Angel” ambassadors for the…\n\nEvery Wednesday afternoon, thousands of low-income teens in New York and Chicago are in the room where it happens, seeing the musical Hamilton for $10. With the show making its long-awaited opening at the Hollywood Pantages on Aug. 16, come this fall L.A. high schoolers also will have the chance to experience the Broadway smash. “There is no audience more honest on earth than 17-year-olds — they’re unjaded and scream at any action or kissing,” says Lin-Manuel Miranda, the musical’s creator and original lead, who next stars in Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns. “By the time they get to the theater, they’re buzzing. They’ve learned about the show and this chapter in American history, and they’re ready to go.” These Title I public school students, all participants in the Hamilton Education Initiative…\n\nAfter Nell Newman — daughter of Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward — started her foundation in 2010, she gave away up to a half-million dollars a year. She also helped direct more than $40 million in giving during the course of more than two decades as the founder of Newman’s Own Organics, a licensee of the Newman’s Own brand that her father co-founded (with writer and editor A.E. Hotchner) in 1982. But when Newman’s Own and its president and CEO Bob Forrester chose not to renew the license in 2015 — against Nell’s desires — she was left without a job or a means to fund her giving. Donations from the Nell Newman Foundation have since declined to a few tens of thousands a year. But now there is an unexpected…\n\nfSroomme Lmeaohm Renetms ini’s cwhiillld nheovoedr fade. Like the afternoon she rode a graffiti-covered B Train with her big sister, Nicole — at ages 8 and 10, their first time alone on New York City mass transit. Their journey took them from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, to Times Square — a seedy porn-theater mecca in the late ’70s — and the Church of Scientology building on 46th Street. There, they met their mother, Vicki, a divorcee whose new boyfriend had indoctrinated the family in the self-fulfillment movement. “We went all-in, because Scientology is an all-in proposition,” says Remini. “My mother thought she’d found the answers to her life and, you know, our future.” Three decades later, Remini is going home again. The 47-year-old actress and anti-Scientology activist is currently relocating from Los Angeles, her…\n\nVARIETY SKETCH SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE (NBC) SNLtopped off its most watched season in 23 years with its biggest nomination haul (22 in all, tying HBO’sWestworldfor the most this year).

In 1976, they were guests of President Gerald Ford, who had Captain & Tennille serenade them with “Muskrat Love.” The Reagans topped that: They had John Travolta, then 31, ask the princess, 24, to dance. The black-tie dinner was Washington’s Woodstock in terms of political glitter. The 80 guests included Clint Eastwood and Tom Selleck, who both danced with Diana. Neil Diamond sang “You Don’t Bring Me Flowers” and also waltzed with the princess. Opera star Leontyne Price sang “Summertime” from Porgy and Bess.
