It is typical for Select teams to play in the highest leagues within the Colorado Soccer Association.\n\nSelect teams will play in 2-4 tournaments and/or college showcases per year depending on the age group. Out-of-state travel should be expected for Select teams depending on age group. As such, elite-level players must have a substantial commitment to the sport of soccer for training and games\n\nBurgundy teams represent the second-most competitive teams in a given age group, and therefore these players and parents are required to demonstrate a higher commitment to training.\n\nThese teams are expected to train ten months out of the year, three days per week during the season, and weekend games. It is typical for Burgundy teams to play in the high Centennial or Champions divisions within the Colorado Soccer Association.\n\nBurgundy teams will play in 2-4 tournaments and/or college showcases per year depending on the age group. Out-of-state travel should be expected for high school age groups during the season. As such, elite-level players must have a substantial commitment to the sport of soccer for training and games.\n\nWhite teams are competitive teams that typically compete in mid-level CSA competitive leagues.\n\nSimilar to our top teams, these teams practice three days per week during the season, in addition to weekend games, and demand substantial time commitments from players. They typically play in 2-3 in-state tournaments and/or local college showcases per year depending on the age group. With the combined two seasons and off-season training during the winter, teams in this division play for ten months each year.\n\nBlue and gold teams offer players the opportunity to continue playing soccer and training with the guidance of our professionally trained coaching staff.\n\nBlue/Gold teams practice two to three days per week and participate in the Colorado Soccer Association Centennial League. It is common for Blue/Gold teams to play 2-3 in-state tournaments and/or college showcase events per year depending on the age group. Although Blue players will often participate in off-season Rapids camps, there is no expectation for teams to train in the off-season.\n\nAfter we form the teams for the Primary season, we will reach out to the families to gather interest in playing the Secondary season. We offer the second season to those players that are in Middle School (8th graders) or those 9th graders that choose to play with Rapids instead of their High School. The season is in fall for the boys and spring for the girls."
