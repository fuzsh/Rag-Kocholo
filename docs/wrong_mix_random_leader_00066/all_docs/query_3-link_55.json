        "text": "Daniel Nestor knows what it takes to win Grand Slam championships.\n\nNow, the Canadian doubles standout is taking his skills to padel.\n\nMore: Venus Receives AO Wild Card\n\nThe Pro Padel League (PPL)—North America’s first professional Padel league—announced that Ronnie Strasser, President and Chief Investment Officer of Strasser Asset Management, has purchased the league’s Miami franchise.\n\nA graduate of the Harvard Business School (OPM), Strasser is a Principal of Phantom Developments (a fifty-year-old real estate company that owns and manages millions of square-feet of commercial industrial property and has built numerous condominium projects in addition to those underway) and will be the Managing Director of the PPL’s Miami Franchise.\n\nStrasser is an avid tennis player and sports lover who has previously invested in professional sport. He is married to Sabrina Strasser, one of North America’s top ballroom Latin dancers, who is a well-known media figure.\n\n“I am grateful to the PPL for awarding me the Miami franchise and look forward to building one of the strongest Padel teams in North America,” said Ronnie Strasser in a statement. “As a businessman, I recognize the tremendous opportunity I have been given and as a sportsman I can’t wait for the competition.”\n\nJoining Strasser as an advisor to the Miami franchise is former ATP star Daniel Nestor who will advise on player relations, coaching, and recruitment for the team. Winning 91 men’s doubles titles during his career, Nestor won 12 Grand Slams, four ATP Tour Finals, and a gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\n“I love Padel and believe that Miami is going to be the epicenter of the sport. I am very excited to be working with Ronnie Strasser and the Miami franchise,” Nestor said.\n\nPhoto credit: Keith Allison/Wikimedia Commons"
