        "text": "41st AEROSPACE MECHANISMS SYMPOSIUM\n\nPasadena, California\n\nMay 16-18, 2012\n\nHosted by\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory and Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company\n\nOrganized by the Mechanisms Education Association\n\nSYMPOSIUM OBJECTIVES\n\nThis symposium is concerned with the problems of design, fabrication, test, and operational use of aerospace mechanisms. Emphasis is on hardware developments. The symposium provides a social and technical forum for personnel active in the field of mechanisms technology, as well as providing a source of information for others interested in this field. The symposium rotates among eight NASA Centers and attracts papers and attendees from all over the world.\n\nSYMPOSIUM LOCATION\n\nThe Hilton in Pasadena, California is the site for all technical sessions.\n\nSYMPOSIUM ACTIVITIES\n\nThe planned technical and social activities provide an opportunity for attendees to become professionally and personally acquainted. Dress attire is business casual unless noted.\n\nMECHANISMS COURSES – On Monday and Tuesday, May 14-15, two separate courses will be offered in the same hotel as the AMS. Be sure to mention the AMS special room rate when you make your Hilton reservations. Registration for the Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium is not included in either class price.\n\nSpace Mechanisms Course\n\nLaunchspace is providing a Special Edition of their popular space mechanisms course. To register, go to www.launchspace.com and register for course 1135SE. The Symposium price for this course is $695. A minimum of 30 attendees is required for this class to be held but this has not been a problem in the past as the class has actually been heavily oversubscribed. Register soon! Space is limited.\n\nThis course explores the technologies required for successful space mechanisms design and offers a detailed look at many of the key components common to most mechanisms. The materials necessary to achieve high performance are discussed. Examples of some of the many types of mechanisms will be included for illustration. In addition, the mechanisms relationship and interface with other vehicle systems will be explored. The course includes design and analysis examples to demonstrate the principles involved in understanding how mechanisms should work, and how design margins should be evaluated during the evolution of a program. For additional information about the course, see www.launchspace.com/1135.html.\n\nNote: Due to the special pricing (list price for this course is $1495), the textbook will not be provided as indicated in the catalog course description. The textbook, Space Vehicle Mechanisms: Elements of Successful Design, edited by P.L. Conley, is available for an additional $175, and may be ordered upon registration.\n\nBearing Analysis Course\n\n“The Analysis of Bearings for Space Vehicle Mechanisms” is a two-day bearing course by Alan Leveille, Peter Ward and Paul Bessette. The goal of the course is to provide the knowledge and design software tools needed to evaluate bearings for high reliability space vehicle mechanisms. The class fee ($1200) includes a license to use BRGS12, a basic ball bearing engineering analysis program. For more information go to www.alanleveille.com.\n\nCHECK-IN – On Tuesday evening, May 15, from 6:00-8:30 PM, check in and registration will be in the Skylight Arcade in the Hilton Pasadena. Symposium materials, including symposium proceedings, will be available, along with light refreshments.\n\nRECEPTION – On Wednesday evening, May 16, a reception will be held at the Hilton Pasadena’s California Ballroom. Supplier and poster paper displays will be exhibited during the evening along with demonstrations by local high school FIRST Robotics teams. A light buffet dinner will be served. The exhibits will be open for the enjoyment of all attendees and guests.\n\nSYMPOSIUM BANQUET – On Thursday evening, May 17, the symposium dinner will be in the Pasadena Conference Center, a short one-block walk from the Hilton Pasadena. (A shuttle can be provided for the disabled or those that need assistance.) The Chad Edwards Jazz Band will entertain during the social hour and banquet, followed by a stage show.\n\nFACILITIES TOUR – On Friday afternoon, May 18, there will be an exclusive tour of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which will include demonstrations of the MSL Rover test-bed. The tour is open to all attendees and guests. Buses depart from the hotel and return to the hotel after the tour. Please indicate upon registration if you and your guests will participate. Foreign Nationals interested in taking the facility tour (including guests) must provide additional information (as part of the registration on www.aeromechanisms.com) for access by May 1. Those received after May 1 may not be able to participate in the tour.\n\nGUEST ACTIVITIES – The Pasadena area offers the business and recreational traveler a combination of sophisticated charm, culture, history and fun. Activities include world-class art collections, historic architecture, and year-round ice skating. The Kidspace Children’s Museum, the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens, and the Griffith Observatory are a short drive away. There are biking, walking and running trails in great weather with picturesque views. Disneyland, Hollywood, and Universal Studios are amongst many other entertainments available in nearby Los Angeles. (See www.visitpasadena.com.)\n\nPRESENTERS’ MEETINGS – Presenting authors are required to attend a complimentary breakfast on the day of their presentation. (Note – only the presenters, not all authors of the paper.) This gathering gives the session participants an opportunity to meet their Session Chair and each other, and to review the session arrangements. The Symposium AV help will be available to discuss presentation requirements.\n\nSYMPOSIUM INFORMATION\n\nREGISTRATION – Advance registration is requested to facilitate planning and commitments. Please register on www.aeromechanisms.com. The registration fee is $550 ($300 for educators, $250 for students and retirees). Late registration for the symposium may be done at the hotel on Tuesday evening, May 15, and each day of the symposium. NOTE: If the registration payment is received after April 24, the fee will be $650 for all. This fee covers all sessions, proceedings, break refreshments, reception, symposium banquet, JPL facility tour, lunch for three days, and specified bus transportation. Guest tickets are $30 for the reception and $40 for the banquet.\n\nThe contact person for questions about registration is:\n\nMonica King\n\nMail Stop 79-24\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\n4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109\n\nPhone: (818) 354-3640\n\nFAX: (818) 393-4878\n\nemail: Monica.M.King@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nOr Don Sevilla at: dsevilla@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nIf arranging to pay by check or money order, they must be drawn on a U.S. bank in U.S. dollars. We cannot accept foreign currency.\n\nHOTEL RESERVATIONS – A block of rooms has been reserved at the Hilton Pasadena.
