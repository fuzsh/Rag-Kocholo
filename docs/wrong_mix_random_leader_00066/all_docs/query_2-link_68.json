        "text": "Canada will be without top singles player Milos Raonic and doubles ace Daniel Nestor for a Davis Cup tie this week against France.\n\nTennis Canada says Raonic, ranked 13th in the world in singles, is still recovering from a adductor tear suffered in the semifinals of the Australian Open.\n\nNestor, the world's No. 12 doubles player, will miss due to an undisclosed family matter.\n\n\"I am deeply saddened to not be able to join my team for the Davis Cup tie in Guadeloupe,\" Raonic said in a release. \"Davis Cup has always been and will continue to be a priority in my schedule.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"My body at this moment does not allow me to compete as the muscular tear I sustained in Australia has not completely healed.\"\n\nRaonic was forced to withdraw from tournaments in Delray Beach, Fla., and Acapulco because of the injury, which inhibits his ability to move side-to-side. He is expected to be out for another 10 to 12 days.\n\nNestor will miss a Davis Cup tie for only the second time in 15 years.\n\n\"The last few years we've come a long way and we've had some good opportunities to do well at Davis Cup and it's definitely frustrating that we haven't been able to field our top team and maximize our potential due to some of the injuries and unforeseen circumstances that have arisen,\" said Nestor.\n\nCaptain Martin Laurendeau has yet to announce replacements.\n\nAlready on the squad are Vasek Pospisil and Philip Bester, both of Vancouver, Frank Dancevic of Niagara Falls, Ont., and Adil Shamasdin of Toronto.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Daniel has answered the call for this team a record number of times over the past 20 years,\" said Laurendeau. \"For him to not be here, we know it's with very good reason.\n\n\"The rest of the team will have to refocus now and prepare thoroughly as we all know the tough challenge that awaits us against this French squad.\"\n\nThe draw is on Thursday. Play on clay courts begins in Guadeloupe on Friday."
