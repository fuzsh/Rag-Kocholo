        "text": "Luis Diaz and Alexis Mac Allister had a duel of the ages in the chaotic Copa America final between Colombia and Argentina, which saw the latter winning 1-0 thanks to an extra time goal.\n\nThe two Liverpool stars battled it out throughout the game, with both Diaz and Mac Allister having perfect opportunities to fire their side ahead. In a game filled with drama and history, Diaz and Mac Allister both led their teams to the limit, with both sides pushing through for the win.\n\nHeading into the contest, Mac Allister and Argentina were favored to win the final over his colleague. Considering how successful Argentina had been in the months and years, especially winning the 2022 World Cup, Mac Allister's side had the energy and experience to add a 16th Copa America title to the cabinet.\n\nREAD MORE: Luis Diaz and Alexis Mac Allister caught up in Copa America chaos as players' families in tears\n\nREAD MORE: Copa America final delayed after ticketless fans storm stadium in Miami\n\nTo start the final, it appeared as if Diaz had more energy as he tried to energize his side to its first Copa America win in over 20 years. About five minutes into the match, Diaz received a ball from Richard Rios just outside the box and immediately, the 27-year-old tried to make something happen.\n\nDiaz fired the ball just past an Argentinian defender, though Emiliano Martinez easily corraled the shot, which happened to be Colombia's first shot on goal of the night. When he wasn't attacking the Argentinian defense, the forward did what he could to keep the energy up.\n\nWith the ball speeding out of play, Diaz sprinted past the ball, impressively back-tapping the ball to his teammate to set up another opportunity. On the other hand, Mac Allister had played more conservatively, waiting for the game to come to him, which included a strong tackle on Jhon Cordoba.\n\nThe second half began with Mac Allister's side almost scoring. Just three minutes into the second half, Mac Allister made a run into the box and attempted to sail the ball in the back of the net but Camilo Vargas snuffed out any play the midfielder had in his mind.\n\nThen in the 56th minute, Mac Allister and Angel Di Maria almost connected on a goal, with the former heading a ball that appeared to be stopped by a Colombian arm. Diaz remained aggressive, using his speed to wreak havoc on the defence.\n\nMac Allister was forced to play even more of a central role for Argentina after star Lionel Messi was subbed off after sustaining an injury in the 66th minute. The Argentine legend was spotted tearful on the bench after being substituted and replaced by Nicolas Gonzalez, with the Liverpool midfielder keeping up his aggressive, but clean, play.\n\nEventually, Mac Allister was replaced by Leandro Paredes in the 97th minute while Diaz remained in the game. Throughout extra time, both sides appeared to be conserving their energy, with the Miami heat taking its toll on the players, leading to a scoreless period.\n\nDiaz's night ended just before the start of the second extra period, with manager Nestor Lorenzo electing to play Miguel Borja instead. It was noted that despite Diaz's skill on the pitch, his penalty track record has left much to be desired, hence the decision to pull the star.\n\nIn the end, it was Lautaro Martinez, who came in for Julian Alvarez, scoring a right-footed shot from the centre of the box to make it 1-0 in the 112th minute, for his fifth goal in the tournament, the most among all players. With the win, Argentina won their 16th Copa America title, which is the most, thanks to Mac Allister's play and Martinez's goal."
