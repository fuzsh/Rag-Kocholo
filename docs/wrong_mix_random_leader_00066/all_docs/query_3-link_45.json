        "text": "The 21st Gold Derby TV Awards nominations were announced on Tuesday, July 16, on the eve of Emmy nominations for the 2023 to 2024 television season. Click the video above to watch the fun announcement video. More than 1,200 registered Gold Derby users cast their votes in 30 categories covering dramas, comedies, movies, limited series, variety and more. Scroll down for our complete list of nominees in all categories, and vote right now for the winners here in our predictions center. Winner voting will go through July 30. Winners will be announced on August 14.\n\nFX’s “The Bear,” the reigning champion for Best Comedy Series, is the leading contender at these awards with 14 bids. In addition to trying to defend its title in that top category, it’s also up for Best Comedy Actor (Jeremy Allen White), Best Comedy Actress (Ayo Edebiri) and Ensemble of the Year. In this year’s race for Best Comedy, it’s up against “Abbott Elementary,” “Girls5eva,” “Hacks,” “Only Murders in the Building,” “Our Flag Means Death,” “Reservation Dogs” and “What We Do in the Shadows.”\n\nA brand new show has lorded over its competitors in the race for Best Drama Series: “Shogun,” with 13 nominations. The FX historical drama set in feudal Japan won’t have to worry about knocking off the reigning champion, “Succession,” which went off the air last year. But it does have to contend against 2021 winner “The Crown” with its robust 10 nominations, as well as “The Curse,” “Elsbeth,” “Fallout,” “The Gilded Age,” “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” and “The Morning Show.” Impressively, five of the eight contenders in the top category are freshman series, due in no small part to the fact that none of last year’s Gold Derby nominees for Best Drama were eligible to return this year, opening the door for a brand new slate.\n\nFX’s “Fargo” edged out Netflix’s “Baby Reindeer” as the most nominated limited series. “Fargo” has six bids to “Reindeer’s” five. They’re among eight nominees for Best Limited Series, a field we expanded to match Best Comedy and Best Drama due to the deep pool of eligible candidates in the field — hint, hint, Emmys. They’re joined by “The Fall of the House of Usher,” “Fellow Travelers,” “Lessons in Chemistry,” “Ripley,” “The Sympathizer” and “True Detective: Night Country.”\n\nVoting commences effective immediately and will be conducted through a plurality vote in most categories. That means you’ll just select one nominee from each category as your favorite, and whoever has the most votes wins. But in the Best Comedy, Best Drama and Best Limited Series races you’ll be able to rank your top three in order of preference. Your number-one choice will get three points, your second choice gets two points and your third choice gets one point.\n\nTo vote, you must have an account with Gold Derby, but don’t worry, registration is easy and totally free. Just visit our sign-up page and connect with Facebook, Google, Twitter, Apple or an email address of your choosing. Once you’re in, feel free to vote right away in our predictions center because you can come back and edit your ballot as often as you like if you change your mind or catch up on more of the nominees. No one’s votes are final until voting closes at the end of July 28. So what shows are your favorites? See the nominees below, then vote.\n\nClick here to see all past Gold Derby TV Awards winners and nominees. You can also find all past winners and nominees on individual IMDb pages for shows and performers. Each 2024 winner will receive a special trophy, and they will hopefully be able to provide us with many acceptance speeches for our August 14 ceremony.\n\nDRAMA SERIES:\n\n“The Crown”\n\n“The Curse”\n\n“Elsbeth”\n\n“Fallout”\n\n“The Gilded Age”\n\n“Mr. and Mrs. Smith”\n\n“The Morning Show”\n\n“Shogun”\n\nDRAMA ACTRESS:\n\nJennifer Aniston, “The Morning Show”\n\nRebecca Ferguson, “Silo”\n\nCarrie Preston, “Elsbeth”\n\nAnna Sawai, “Shogun”\n\nImelda Staunton, “The Crown”\n\nEmma Stone, “The Curse”\n\nDRAMA ACTOR:\n\nDonald Glover, “Mr. and Mrs. Smith”\n\nWalton Goggins, “Fallout”\n\nCosmo Jarvis, “Shogun”\n\nGary Oldman, “Slow Horses”\n\nHiroyuki Sanada, “Shogun”\n\nDominic West, “The Crown”\n\nDRAMA SUPPORTING ACTRESS:\n\nChristine Baranski, “The Gilded Age”\n\nElizabeth Debicki, “The Crown”\n\nMoeka Hoshi, “Shogun”\n\nYuka Kouri, “Shogun”\n\nGreta Lee, “The Morning Show”\n\nLesley Manville, “The Crown”\n\nFumi Nikaido, “Shogun”\n\nDRAMA SUPPORTING ACTOR:\n\nKhalid Abdalla, “The Crown”\n\nTadanobu Asano, “Shogun’\n\nBilly Crudup, “The Morning Show”\n\nJon Hamm, “The Morning Show”\n\nJonathan Pryce, “The Crown”\n\nKe Huy Quan, “Loki”\n\nBenny Safdie, “The Curse”\n\nDRAMA GUEST ACTRESS:\n\nMichaela Coel, “Mr. and Mrs. Smith”\n\nDale Dickey, “Fallout”\n\nClaire Foy, “The Crown”\n\nRashida Jones, “Silo”\n\nSarah Paulson, “Mr. and Mrs. Smith”\n\nParker Posey, “Mr. and Mrs. Smith”\n\nDRAMA GUEST ACTOR:\n\nNestor Carbonell, “Shogun”\n\nPaul Dano, “Mr. and Mrs. Smith”\n\nMichael Emerson, “Fallout”\n\nKyle MacLachlan, “Fallout”\n\nWagner Moura, “Mr. and Mrs. Smith”\n\nJohn Turturro, “Mr. and Mrs. Smith”\n\nDRAMA EPISODE:\n\n“The Crown” – “Ritz”\n\nWriters: Meriel Sheibani-Clare and Peter Morgan\n\nDirector: Alex Gabassi\n\n“The Crown” – “Sleep, Dearie Sleep”\n\nWriter: Peter Morgan\n\nDirector: Stephen Daldry\n\n“The Curse” – “Green Queen”\n\nWriters: Nathan Fielder and Benny Safdie\n\nDirector: Nathan Fielder\n\n“Shogun” – “Anjin”\n\nWriters: Rachel Kondo and Justin Marks\n\nDirector: Jonathan van Tulleken\n\n“Shogun” – “Crimson Sky”\n\nWriters: Rachel Kondo and Caillin Puente\n\nDirector: Frederick E.O.
