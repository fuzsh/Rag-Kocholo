        "text": "Among Schifrin’s other conducting credits are the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, the Mexico City Philharmonic, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestra of Saint Luke (New York City), and the National Symphony Orchestra of Argentina.\n\nIn 1986, the Glendale Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of Lalo Schifrin, performed at the Hollywood Bowl. His “Salute to the Statue of Liberty” was received with a tumultuous ovation by a crowd of 17,000 people. In 1987, Schifrin was commissioned to write the overture for the Pan American Games which he recorded in Toronto and premiered with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. In 1995, Schifrin composed ad conducted the finale for the Pan American Games, which were held in Argentina.\n\nIt is Schifrin’s ability to switch musical gears which makes him so unique in the music world. As a jazz musician he has performed and recorded with great personalities such as Dizzy Gillespie, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, and Count Basie.\n\nHis “Concerto for Guitar and Orchestra,” was recorded by the London Philharmonic Orchestra featuring soloist Angel Romero. “Dances Concertantes” for clarinet and orchestra which he conducted at the Pyramids of Teotihuacan in Mexico with Placido Domingo as the tenor soloist. The event was telecast in 1989. In 1999, this concert was released on CD, DVD and VHS.\n\nIn April, 1989, Lalo Schifrin was appointed Music Director of the Glendale Symphony Orchestra, and he served in that capacity for six years.\n\nHe was commissioned to write the Grand Finale for an event which took place in Caracalla, Italy, July 7th, 1990, to celebrate the finals of the World Cup Soccer Championship. In this concert, the Three Tenors, Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras sang together for the first time. The orchestras of the Rome and Florence opera companies were conducted by Zubin Mehta. The record and videotape of this event have gone on to become the biggest sellers in the history of classical music. Schifrin also was engaged to arrange the sequels for July 1994, also for Carreras, Domingo, Pavarotti and Zubin Mehta, which was performed at Dodger Stadium, again on the eve of the World Cup Soccer Championships; the Three Tenors event that was held in July of 1998 in Paris, France, and the latest one for the World Cup Finals in Japan.\n\nSchifrin was commissioned by the Steinway Foundation to write his “Piano Concerto No. 2,” which was premiered by the National Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, in Washington, D.C. at the Kennedy Center on June 11, 1992, featuring Cristina Ortiz as the soloist. In that year, he also produced, conducted and arranged a CD featuring Jose Carreras with the London Symphony Orchestra: “Friends for Life.”\n\nAmong Schifrin’s most recent commissions include “Fantasy for Screenplay and Orchestra” for Daniel Barenboim and the Chicago Symphony, premiered in 2002-2003 season, and Symphonic Impressions of Oman, which was commissioned by the Sultan of Oman, recorded in England with the London Symphony Orchestra, and released by Aleph Records in 2003. His recent key appearances in 2003 include Schifrin with the Georgian State Symphony Orchestra; with The Moscow Symphony Orchestra and with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nHis longtime involvement in both the jazz and symphonic worlds came together beginning in 1993 when he was featured as pianist and conductor for his on-going series of “Jazz Meets the Symphony” recordings, with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and such notable jazz stars as Ray Brown, Grady Tate, Jon Faddis, Paquito D’Rivera and James Morrison. “Thinking back, I believe the start of this project was really two of my early film scores, namely, ‘The Cincinnati Kid,’ in which Ray Charles sang backed by a symphony orchestra, and the famous chase scene through the streets of San Francisco in ‘Bullitt’ wherein I wrote a symphonic score combined with saxophone solos playing at very fast tempos.\n\nThen, years later, when I arranged music for Dizzy Gillespie, Ray Brown, Grady Tate and myself to play for a tour with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, I began to fully realize that the two distinct musical forms could be combined.” “Jazz Meets the Symphony” was internationally successful, and led to the release in July 1994 of “More Jazz Meets the Symphony.” The third of the series, “Firebird, Jazz Meets the Symphony, No. 3” was released in the summer of 1996 and received two Grammy nominations. The fourth in the series “Metamorphosis,” was released in the spring of 1998 on Schifrin’s own label, Aleph Records. The gift set contains the first four releases so far and is entitled “The Jazz Meets the Symphony Collection.” The fifth in the series, “Intersections, Jazz Meets the Symphony, No. 5” was released in late summer 2001. It is unique in that it has a full symphony orchestra, full jazz band, plus jazz stars Jeff Hamilton, Christian McBride, James Morrison and David Sanchez. Jazz Meets the Symphony No. 6 will be recorded in early 2005.\n\nIn November 1992, the Los Angeles Master Chorale premiered his “Cantares Argentinos” in a concert of Latin American music. Also during that month, Schifrin conducted the European premiere of his “Piano Concerto No. 2” with the Sophia Radio Symphony Orchestra. This concert marked the first Bulgarian telecast for the Eurovision Network. The full-length concert is featured in a film score CD “Something to Believe In” with Jeffrey Biegel and the Munich Rundfunk Orchestra.\n\nSchifrin wrote and adapted the music for “Christmas in Vienna” in 1992 featuring Diana Ross, Jose Carreras, and Placido Domingo. The telecast was released as a CD, laserdisc and video in 1993 on the Sony Classics label.\n\nSchifrin returned to Vienna in December 1995 where he arranged the entire program of Christmas music entitled, Christmas in Vienna,” sung by Jose Carreras, Natalie Cole and Placido Domingo. It was shown on PBS in America on December 23rd and 24th of that year and is shown regularly during the holiday season.\n\nIn 1993, Schifrin was commissioned to write his “Lili’Uokalani Symphony” in honor of the last monarch of Hawaii, Queen Lili’Uokalani. The work was premiered by the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra, and was recorded by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra with Schifrin conducting in the spring of 1995. It was released in November 1996 on the Urtext Digital Classics label.\n\nIn the spring of 1993, Schifrin conducted for a recording with the Vienna Volksoper Orchestra for Julia Migenes, “Julia Migenes in Vienna,” and conducted the recording of “Te Deum” by Charpentier for classical trumpet virtuoso, Maurice Andre and chamber orchestra in Pairs. Both projects were released in October 1993.\n\nHis 1996 conducted recording of “The Carnival of the Animals” by Camille Saint-Saens has been acclaimed by the electronic and print media. The narrations are by Audrey Hepburn, Charlton Heston, James Earl Jones, Dudley Moore, Walter Matthau, and Lynn Redgrave.\n\nHe also composed the score for Luis Valdez’ epic drama “Bandido!,” presented at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. The music showed the wide spectrum of Schifrin’s talents as a composer. Valdez contributed lyrics to certain pieces.\n\nThe Sultan of Oman commissioned Schifrin for his latest classical work, “Symphonic Sketches of Oman.” This symphony was recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra with Schifrin conducting in the autumn of 2001 and released shortly thereafter.\n\nOn December 8th, 1995 in Marseilles, Schifrin led a symphony orchestra in celebration of the Lumiere brothers’ invention of film, with a concert entitled “100 Ans de Cinema.” The concert featured singers Julia Migenes and Dee Dee Bridgewater, which was recorded by Warner Bros. Records in France. This recording, “Film Classics,” is currently in release of Aleph Records. This concert was reprised in Buenos Aires in 1998, and is scheduled for release on CD with Aleph Records in February 2002.\n\nIn addition to current commissions and film scoring activities, Schifrin tours extensively conducting symphony orchestras particularly featuring his repertoire of “Jazz Meets the Symphony.”\n\nOther conducting programs include film music, classical repertoire and jazz bands. The big band formations are frequently featured in performing “Gillespiana,” which has become a highly acclaimed classic. Recent performances have been the Playboy Jazz Festival, the Monterey Jazz Festival, the 80th birthday commemorative concert for Dizzy Gillespie in Englewood, New Jersey, television Big Band concert in Germany, WDR Big Band concert in Cologne, Germany; Carnegie Hall Jazz Band at Carnegie Hall, the Clark University Jazz Band in Atlanta at the I.A.J.E. (International Association of Jazz Educa-tors) and a concert in early 1998 with the BBC in London, England.\n\nIn October 1996 was the world premiere of “The Rhapsody for Bix.” Schifrin was commissioned by the Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Society to write a suite in honor of Davenport, Iowa’s native son, Bix Beiderbecke. This piece is on Schifrin’s current release “Metamorphosis.”\n\nIn June 1999, Schifrin premiered his “Latin Jazz Suite” with soloists Jon Faddis, David Sanchez, Ignacio Berroa, Alex Acuna and the WDR Big Band in Cologne, Germany. It was also performed with the BBC Big Band in London, England. In September 1999, the piece had its American premiere in Los Angeles at the Watercourt Plaza while, at the same time, the recording of the work was released. “Latin Jazz Suite” received a Grammy nomination, and was just released on DVD.\n\nIn January 2000, Schifrin premiered a new work for jazz big band, “Esperanto.” This work features soloists Jean-Luc Ponty, Don Byron, Nestor Marconi, James Morrison, Trilok Gurtu, Sydney Thiam, Greg Hutchinson, Simon Stockhausen and the WDR Big Band. “Esperanto” was released on CD in September, 2000.\n\nLalo Schifrin is a recipient of the 1988 BMI Lifetime Achievement Award. BMI also honored Schifrin in 2001 with a special composer’s award for his original cult classic theme to “Mission Impossible.” He was most recently honored in 2004 by French performing rights organization SACEM, along with the 57th Annual Cannes Film Festival, in recognition of his significant contribution to music, film and culture, and also in 2004 by the American Society of Music Arrangers & Composers (ASMAC) with the 65th Annual Golden Score Award.
