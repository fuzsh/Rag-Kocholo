        "text": "Ephram (Fedya) Nestor, a Bulgarian-born immigrant to the United States, was “an unusual person,” according to his second wife Barbara. She met him in 1933 when he was selling vegetables from his car and remembers not really liking him. “He stayed too long,” he “talked too much,” and worst of all to this devoted radical, he “passionately espoused the cause of Communism [but] he didn’t know too much about it.” Interviewed when she was ninety, sharp-witted Barbara Nestor still recalled how Fedya embarrassed her at a Marxist study group with his “foolish” statements and obvious lack of knowledge about Marx or communism. His family agreed he was “not much of a Communist” when he joined the local party in 1936 and could not be trusted with the simplest duties.[1] Nonetheless, the federal government deported Fedya in 1956 for his brief Communist Party (CP) membership.\n\nFedya would have been just another quiet casualty of Cold War anticommunist zeal had it not been for his wife’s discovery of his accrued Social Security benefits the previous year. In 1955 Barbara Nestor signed Fedya’s name to an Application for Old-Age Insurance Benefits and submitted a Wife’s Insurance Benefits application for herself. She was pleasantly surprised at her award of $27.80 per month, since she believed Fedya could never hold a steady job. After Fedya was deported, however, an official from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) informed Barbara in the curt language of bureaucracy that “no additional payments [were] due under the social security law.” She took Fedya’s case all the way to the Supreme Court, with the assistance of the American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born, arguing that the federal government had deprived Fedya of a vested property interest without due process of law and subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment.[2] Ultimately the Court disagreed. In the matter of Flemming v. Nestor (1960) the justices split five to four in favor of the government, reversing a district court ruling.[3]\n\nNo one at the time perceived Nestor as one of the most significant decisions of the term. The debate among the justices was brief. The press paid little attention.[4] But in retrospect the case was important for several reasons. First, it revealed confusion among even the most learned Americans about the legacy of the New Deal and the character of their so-called “welfare state,” a term that had only recently come into use. The program at issue in Fedya Nestor’s case, federal Old-Age Insurance (“Social Security”), was foundational to American security by the mid-twentieth century yet Americans fundamentally misunderstood it.[5] In support of the deported Nestor’s claim, his attorneys parroted the language of politicians and government officials, describing Social Security in terms of “contributions,” “premiums,” and “earned rights” (as opposed to “charity” or “relief”).[6] This language resonated with a district court judge and several Supreme Court justices. Yet Social Security was not insurance, the majority in Nestor made clear. “Earned” social insurance benefits were neither “property” nor contractual right.[7] This was a major pronouncement about the nature of America’s welfare state, one that has never been overturned.[8]\n\nSecond, Nestor is important for exemplifying the important role that courts and legal disputes played in the development of the welfare state. Historically and institutionally oriented political scientists and sociologists, who have done the bulk of the work on the development of the American welfare state, have overlooked this point. While attentive to lawmakers and statutes, their accounts of the welfare state have generally failed to consider litigation as a creator of policy capable of shaping and constraining future policy; they have not brought their insights about “path dependence” and “policy feedback” to bear on administrative and judicial decisions.[9] Historians have also overlooked this point, perhaps because of the enduring belief that while Franklin Delano Roosevelt lost his court-packing battle, he won the war, securing a New Deal Court that would no longer pass judgment on the wisdom of social and economic legislation. Cases like Nestor suggest that the courts after 1937 continued to influence social and economic policies, even if they now refrained from invalidating legislation wholesale. After all, the civil liberties, due process, and racial discrimination controversies that flooded into the courts throughout the next decades were often entangled with social welfare policies; litigants asked courts not only to vindicate their individual liberties, but to pass judgment on what the state owed them and what it could ask of them in return.[10]\n\nCases raising these questions about the welfare state became more frequent as domestic anticommunist fervor increased—a third point that Nestor illustrates—because during this Red Scare, political repression often occurred through revocation of government-funded privileges and entitlements. McCarthyism[11] punished thousands of targets not, for the most part, through death or imprisonment, but by removing security and dashing expectations—by taking away a job, revoking a license to work, or rescinding a promised old-age pension. Those who wanted to root out subversives took advantage of the dramatic growth of the state and its direct or indirect control over Americans’ social welfare. For example, as the federal government deported Fedya Nestor and revoked his Social Security benefits, other political radicals lost public housing, unemployment insurance, government-regulated licenses, and public-sector jobs.[12]Nestor shows how the breadth of the American welfare state and its hooks into American lives offered a new technology for policing, monitoring, and coercing American citizens.[13]\n\nFinally, Nestor not only highlighted a problem in post-war American life, it helped trigger a creative solution. At a time when it seemed that a communist presence was certain and national morals were in peril, when communities struggled with dramatic social and demographic changes, many people wanted the government to impose order and reinforce traditional values. But what tactics were appropriate? How should the government wield its growing power as welfare guarantor? And what mechanisms existed to prevent government agencies and administrators from abusing their discretion? The Nestor case and related controversies led Yale law professor Charles Reich to articulate a legal theory that spoke in conservative terms yet promised to protect the subsidies, benefits, and opportunities that the government provided. Reich’s famous 1964 article “The New Property”—in which he called Nestor “the most important of all judicial decisions concerning government largess”—likened the “valuables dispensed by the government” to the private property of the Founders. Reich urged courts to provide these new forms of wealth the same protections as the old in order to maintain an independent citizenry.[14] Eventually courts agreed, deciding in the late sixties and early seventies that the Constitution protected welfare payments, public housing, and other nontraditional forms of property from being taken without rigorous administrative procedures.[15] The Court has since stepped back from the redistributive implications of these decisions, but not from the acknowledgment that the state creates valuable interests on which many Americans depend.\n\nIn sum, Flemming v. Nestor is in one sense the story of a single deportee, a colorful, self-proclaimed “Tolstoyan” who lost his Social Security benefits in an unfortunate but not exceptional manner. But in another sense it is much bigger: it captures a complicated moment in American history, when Americans grappled with political repression, a growing expectation of government largess, and the intersection of the two. The case also had real consequences. It not only clarified one aspect of an “open-textured” welfare state, making law for millions of Americans, it contributed to a jurisprudence that attempted to reconcile the Constitution’s promises with the optimism, anxiety, and insecurity of post-war American life.\n\nFedya and Barbara Nestor: Dilettante and Crusader\n\nFedya Nestor’s encounter with the American legal system truly began with his second wife, Barbara Nestor (née Herman), and her children from her first marriage, who were far more engaged with politics than he. Barbara arrived in the United States from Hungary in 1888, at age four, and found socialism by age sixteen. She was a member of the Socialist Party in Denver until the Bolshevik Revolution of 1919 when she became a charter member of the Communist Labor Party in Denver,[16] and she remained an active grassroots organizer until her death in 1979.[17] She also passed her radical politics onto her children: her feisty daughter Dorothy went on to become the twenty-year chair of the CP in the Los Angeles area.[18]\n\nIronically the U.S. government deported not Barbara but her bumbling second husband Fedya, a childish dreamer who dabbled in communism but truly loved the “perpetual motion machine” he was building in the backyard.[19] Fedya came from Bulgaria in 1913 when he was twenty-three. Not wanting to fight in the Balkan Wars, Fedya fled to Switzerland where a doctor friend enabled his immigration to the United States. Barbara met him during the Great Depression when he was selling vegetables door-to-door in Los Angeles.[20] Although Barbara claimed she “didn’t like him very much” and found his admiration “nauseating,” he won her over with his good looks, spirited teasing, and love for her children. By 1933 Fedya was living with her and by 1936 they were married.[21]\n\nNineteen thirty-six was also the year in which Fedya joined the Communist Party. Fedya had a great love for the Soviet Union, but politically he was not very involved.[22] Although Barbara remembered Fedya joining picket lines and helping her shelter an accused murderer sent by the local CP branch, she was adamant that “[t]he most [Fedya] could do—and he didn’t do that well—was to help distribute The People’s World.”[23] Furthermore Fedya had little understanding of the Party’s ideology. “He thought he was a Communist,” mused Barbara, but “he really didn’t know much about Marxism.” He had been a “Tolstoyan” in Bulgaria and “a very weird kind of socialist.”[24] Barbara, who at age sixteen considered Marx’s manifesto her “bible,”[25] distinctly remembered taking the impish Fedya to her local John Reed club for Marxist intellectuals and being “so embarrassed” by his ignorance.[26] Barbara’s daughter Dorothy agreed: “He was basically a dreamer,” she said, whose politics were an incoherent mixture of anarchism and De Leon-style socialism.[27]\n\nDorothy, dubbed “the Little Dictator” by the local press for her leadership style, fiery temperament, and diminutive stature, was the real “subversive” in the family.[28] She joined the Young Communists League at age fourteen, mobilized farm and cannery workers throughout the 1930s, and worked as lead organizer for the Los Angeles County Communist Party in the 1940s. She was also the frequent object of FBI surveillance[29] and one of the eleven California Communist Party leaders famously arrested in 1951 for conspiring to bring about the violent overthrow of the U.S. Government. (The Supreme Court overturned her conviction under the Smith Act in the renowned case Yates v. United States.)[30] When federal immigration authorities commenced deportation proceedings against Fedya, the family assumed it was to get at Dorothy.[31] No one predicted how important his case would become.\n\nFedya’s legal history begins in 1953. A new law allowed federal authorities to deport aliens who were or had been members of the CP,[32] and they easily found three “stool pigeons” to testify about Fedya’s CP membership. The informants’ motives were suspect and their recollections inconsistent, but the judge overlooked all objections. The evidence constituted “reasonable, substantial and probative evidence of Communist Party membership,” he found, which Fedya’s silence (his attorney advised him not to testify) “further corroborat[ed].”[33] Meanwhile, as Fedya’s deportation case was on appeal, Barbara applied for Social Security benefits on the couple’s behalf. To her surprise HEW issued Fedya an award of $55.60 per month.[34] By July 1956, however (“right after Khrushchev’s speech,” Barbara remembered), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) had sent her white-haired husband on his way to Sofia, Bulgaria.[35] (His appeal was unsuccessful and some evidence suggests he actually wanted to go.)[36] HEW then terminated Fedya’s benefits, citing an obscure provision of the 1954 amendments to the Social Security Act.[37]\n\nHistorians of the welfare state often characterize the 1954 amendments as a triumph for the Social Security program because they extended coverage to previously uncovered sectors of the labor market and liberalized eligibility requirements. A program that legislators once restricted mainly to white, urban workers opened up, giving more Americans security and creating an even bigger constituency for the popular program.[38] But the amendment that applied to Fedya was illiberal and ungenerous, a reminder of a political climate that historians of the welfare state often forget. Section 402(n) allowed for the termination of old-age, survivor, and disability insurance benefits to an alien deported for participation in, inter alia, “subversive” activities.[39] The amendment was likely part of the flurry of legislation aimed at suspected Soviet spy and State Department official Alger Hiss.[40] In 1954, when Hiss was serving a prison sentence for perjury, legislators discovered he was due to receive a government pension of $700 a year, a development that left at least one representative “shocked—aghast—enraged—boiling mad.”[41] Section 402(n) aimed to prevent people like Hiss from reaping the rewards of the country they betrayed. This amendment prompted little discussion in Congress, but it mattered to Barbara Nestor. Her U.S. residency ensured the safety of her monthly Social Security check, but she believed HEW unfairly terminated her husband’s.[42] Accordingly, when her contestation of the agency’s decision failed, the Los Angeles Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born found attorneys to file a complaint for her in federal court.[43]\n\nA Life Becomes Law\n\n“[T]he sordid controversies of the litigants,” Benjamin Cardozo once said, “are the stuff out of which great and shining truths will ultimately be shaped.” Cardozo was describing the way in which a system of case law develops: cases become precedents that judges must follow, and thus principles rather than “chance and favor” dictate the outcome of controversies.[44] But Cardozo’s quote also describes how, when litigants bring their complicated, contradictory stories to court, the law and its functionaries impose order. Lawyers and judges shape the facts into a narrative that makes sense to them, pruning off the bits that straggle. Perhaps Barbara Nestor thought that litigating the Social Security issue would affect her husband’s deportation case, perhaps she wanted to make a point to the administrators that jilted her family, perhaps she simply wanted access to Fedya’s benefits, but in initiating a formal legal complaint she gave the story to others to tell. Along the way the legal system lost sight of the Nestors as individuals and instead connected their story to a larger debate about the relationship between liberty and security in a Cold War welfare state.\n\nBarbara Nestor did not have much contact with the attorneys that the Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born found for her. She remembered them simply as “able.”[45] Able indeed—and deeply embedded in the legal history of American anticommunism. The lawyers who took the Nestors’ case were partners Joseph Forer and David Rein, both Jewish, Ivy League law school graduates, and members of the left-wing National Lawyers Guild.[46] At a time when most lawyers were unwilling to associate with the politically unpopular targets of anticommunist politics and rigorously policed their own ranks,[47] Forer and Rein represented hundreds of alleged subversives and communists.[48] Between 1948 and 1964 the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to at least eighteen of Forer and Rein’s cases,[49] and the partners were involved in such famous proceedings as American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born v. Subversive Activities Control Board,[50]Rowoldt v. Perfetto,[51]Gold v. United States,[52] and the civil rights case District of Columbia v. JohnR. Thompson Co.[53]\n\nIn fact the pair’s very first civil liberties case was “a whopper,” to use Forer’s words: the case of Soviet spy Gerhardt Eisler, a German intellectual who worked for the Comintern while living in the United States in the 1930s.[54] From late 1946 when his case broke to 1949 when he escaped to East Germany, Eisler faced prosecutions for deportation, perjury, and contempt of Congress, each of which the public watched with fascination and horror. Eisler by then was homeless, penniless, and lacking any CP authority, but to the public he was “the quintessential embodiment of the specter of international Communism” and “the personification of the foreign elements that allegedly controlled the American Communist Party.”[55] Although Fedya Nestor was not nearly as important as Eisler, one of the most vilified characters of the early Cold War, the fact that the two shared attorneys suggests the role that everyone expected Nestor to play in the ensuing legal drama.\n\nOn May 5, 1958, Forer and Rein filed a complaint on Fedya Nestor’s behalf in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, arguing that the government acted unconstitutionally in revoking Nestor’s Social Security benefits. For one thing, they said, the deprivation was a penalty inflicted without a judicial trial. For another, it was an ex post facto punishment. In addition they called the government’s decision irrational (and thus a violation of due process)—it had nothing to do with the purposes of the Social Security program. Last, they invoked the First Amendment: the government was punishing Nestor for past membership in the Communist Party, which constituted protected speech.[56] For Forer and Rein this was a classic Cold War civil liberties case, one more battle for the rights of an unpopular minority.\n\nNestor won, but not for the reasons anyone expected. The case went to Judge Edward Allen Tamm, a protégé of J. Edgar Hoover’s from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[57] Tamm was so tied to Hoover, in fact, that when President Truman nominated him to the federal bench in 1948 the local bar association objected. Out of desperation some critics even questioned his law degree.[58] Tamm survived and in some ways was everything his opponents feared: a predictable conservative on the bench who continued to correspond with Hoover about everything from the socialist leanings of Hoover’s judicial enemies to the need for FBI-trained court administrators to “knock some sense into the heads of freaks” on the federal bench.[59] Yet in the case of the Bulgarian ex-communist, Fedya Nestor, Tamm wrote a lengthy decision in Nestor’s favor.\n\nWhat Tamm cared about was not one man’s civil liberties, but the sanctity of Social Security for the American people. He believed the politicians and administrators who described Social Security as an insurance program; he believed that workers, through their contributions to the program, earned their Social Security benefits. In legal terms, the program seemed to deserve the protections of contract or property. Tamm accepted that Congressional appropriations were not binding promises: Congress needed the ability to deal with inevitable political and economic fluctuations. But the ability to absolutely deprive a person of pension-like benefits after they had accrued—must that also follow? “This Court,” Tamm answered, “does not believe so.”[60]\n\nIf the law of contract did not protect Social Security Benefits, the law of property should, Tamm reasoned. Some case law directly contradicted that logic,[61] but a few cases at least suggested “that the nature of such benefits make [sic] them property rights.”[62] Furthermore, Tamm had statements from the secretary of HEW himself stating that the act of working in covered employment established “rights to benefits.” Once the right had been earned, an individual’s actions were not supposed to modify or restrict it.[63] Tamm knew that the HEW secretary had no authority to bind the courts, but it mattered to him that that the head of HEW thought of—and marketed—Social Security this way. Conveniently ignoring Nestor’s heritage and politics, Tamm concluded that the government deprived him of his Social Security benefits, his property, without due process of law.[64]\n\nHEW appealed the case directly to the Supreme Court. Judge Tamm’s decision not only looked like judicial intrusion into legislative territory (a separation of powers problem), it threatened to expand that sacred category of rights and obligations that the government protects as “property.”[65] The phrase “property rights” may not be used lightly in American jurisprudence. As Richard Adelstein notes, “property stands at the center of the relationship between the individual and the state”; “whom the state recognizes as having the authority to control the disposition of objects and ideas” determines a society’s institutions, customs, and hierarchies.[66] In the U.S. property may be especially important. Some legal historians go so far as to describe it as the basis of American civil society[67] and “the guardian of every other right.”[68] And all agree that in constitutional law property has a special place. It alone stands as the equal of liberty and life in the Constitution—something not to be taken, at least not without expensive, time-consuming procedures.[69] It also had a special place in Cold War political rhetoric: as a symbol of a free market and a free society, private property differentiated Americans from their enemies. In sum, the boundaries of property mattered.\n\nSome scholars have suggested that Fedya Nestor’s disloyalty was more important to the Court than the property issue and that the case’s outcome was simply “Court rationalization of the persecution of a communist who had been deported in 1956 but who had the audacity to demand his social security money.”[70] The several dissenters in the case alleged the same. Had the Court merely wanted to rationalize Nestor’s persecution, however, there were ways to do so that would not have simultaneously affected the interests of millions of American workers and their families. For example, the Court might have acknowledged a theoretical property interest in Social Security benefits, but held that Nestor’s right had not “vested” at the time Congress changed the law regarding communist deportees. There are other reasons as well to question the “Court rationalization” theory. While the sparse notes in the files of Justices Black and Douglas, both dissenters in the case, shed little light on the issue, Howard Lesnick, a clerk to Justice Harlan during the 1959–60 term, recalls that members of the Court were most concerned about Judge Tamm’s unorthodox use of the term “property” and the apparent judicial intrusion on the legislative function.[71] This seems right. In 1960, when the justices heard Flemming v. Nestor,[72] anticommunist sentiments were not gone—indeed, the politics of anticommunism were thriving—but the climate of fear associated with Senator McCarthy had lifted. And although most of the justices had taken a conservative stance on loyalty and security issues during the early Cold War period,[73] by 1956 the Court had welcomed one of its most liberal members ever (William J. Brennan).[74] The 1956–1957 term became famous for limiting political persecution.[75] Thus, a case that once fit with classic McCarthy-era controversies was by 1960 about guarding the boundaries of property, preventing leftist lawyers from carving out new rights, and respecting Congress as it grappled with the complexities of running a welfare state.[76]\n\nThe decision in Flemming v. Nestor was five to four in favor of HEW (Flemming), with Justice John Marshall Harlan writing for the majority. He began with an explanation of Social Security’s design. “Payments under the [Social Security] Act are based upon the wage earner’s record of earnings in employment”; “[t]he program is financed through a payroll tax levied on employees in covered employment.” But, he continued, “eligibility for benefits, and the amount of such benefits, do not in any true sense depend on contribution to the program through the payment of taxes.” Each contributor’s payroll taxes go into the Treasury as “internal-revenue collections” and from there into the program’s “Trust Fund.” Nothing akin to individual bank accounts exists. In other words Social Security was not like commercial insurance, where one’s benefits were entirely dependent on contractual premium payments, nor could the “noncontractual interest” of a covered employee be analogized to that of the holder of an annuity. The annuity holder has a firm entitlement; the covered employee something less.[77]\n\nJustice Harlan next discussed why it would be wrong to characterize a person’s accrued Social Security benefits as a “property right,” a title that other Cold War cases had forced into ambiguity. (For example, in Greene v. McElroy, a case involving revocation of a government contractor’s employee’s security clearance, a majority of the Court agreed that the “liberty” and “property” concepts of the Fifth Amendment encompassed “the right to hold specific private employment and to follow a chosen profession free from unreasonable government interference”).[78] Congress designed Social Security, Harlan explained, “to function into the indefinite future,” enduring inevitable fluctuations in economic and social conditions. To fulfill this goal Congress needed “flexibility and boldness in adjustment,” including the ability to narrow or even repeal provisions that promised certain benefits. If the Court were to agree with Judge Tamm that accrued Social Security benefits were “property,” a host of procedural protections would apply and Congress would lose its flexibility. The Constitution also prohibits the government from taking private property for public purposes without just compensation, meaning Congress might have to offer pay-outs to covered beneficiaries every time it lowered or restricted benefit levels, wreaking havoc on the national budget.[79]\n\nJustice Harlan insisted that the Court’s holding was fair. Nestor’s benefits were not “property,” but that did not mean the government could freely revoke them. In evaluating Congressional actions not involving a fundamental interest like liberty or property, the Court would still overturn laws that “manifest[ed] a patently arbitrary classification, utterly lacking in rational justification.” Not surprisingly, however, Justice Harlan found “[s]uch is not the case here.” When Congress terminated the benefits that accrued to people like Nestor, deported for Communist Party affiliation, Harlan reasoned, it might have been simply limiting benefits to people residing in the United States, perhaps because residents would be more likely than non-residents to invest their money in the U.S. economy. Then, having conjured a possible rational explanation, Harlan concluded that the Court “need go no further.” The Act depriving Nestor of his benefits was constitutional; Nestor had received all the protection the law mandated.[80]\n\nJustice Hugo Black vigorously disagreed.[81] Black and Harlan, though friends, came from different worlds and often found themselves on opposite sides of legal debates. Harlan was a Princeton graduate and Rhodes Scholar who seemed groomed for political greatness. His forbears included a governor, a congressman, and a Supreme Court justice (his namesake). Black, by contrast, came from an evangelical Baptist family in poor, isolated Clay County, Alabama. His training in law came not from Oxford or the “Eastern establishment,” but from the University of Alabama and his years as a small-time practitioner, police court judge, and county prosecutor. With little money and no family connections, Black entered national politics (he won a Senate seat in 1926) by combining his brand of southern populism with a short-lived membership in the powerful Ku Klux Klan.[82]\n\nOnce in the Senate Hugo Black was a tenacious foe of corruption, an advocate for the common man (the consumer, the farmer, the factory worker), and a reliable supporter of New Deal legislation, including the Social Security Act of 1935.[83] In fact, his personal papers are filled with correspondence from constituents about the Act—how it worked; whether they or their family members could benefit. Sincere letter writers detailed their personal situations and asked for their senator’s opinion.[84] Black likely told them the same thing that New Deal designers and administrators said: Social Security was insurance for the working man, earned by the individual and merely administered by the federal government.\n\nPerhaps in answering he consulted one of the clippings he saved, from the Tuscumbia Times. “The Truth About Old Age Benefits” discussed a hypothetical man, Jim Brown, who was nearly sixty and had a job in a mill. When old age overtakes Jim, the article explained, “the postman will bring him a Government check, every month, covering the amount of old-age benefits to which he is entitled” based on his wage record. And Jim “will have only himself to thank for this provision for his old age”—because he earned it.[85] Twenty-five years later the majority in Flemming v. Nestor wanted to take Jim’s right away, Black believed. With “nice words” and slick reasoning the majority told contributors “that despite their own and their employers’ payments the Government … is merely giving them something for nothing and can stop doing so when it pleases.” This, Justice Black wrote in dissent, was “a complete misunderstanding of the purpose Congress and the country had in passing that law.”[86]\n\nTo support his understanding of Congress’s purpose Justice Black cited Senator Walter F. George (D-Georgia), chairman of the Finance Committee in 1935 and presumably a representative of “congressional intent.” As Congress debated Social Security, Senator George emphasized the program’s compatibility with “the American concept that free men want to earn their security and not ask for doles—that what is due as a matter of earned right is far better than a gratuity.” In another passage Senator George stated: “Social Security is not a handout; it is not charity; it is not relief. It is an earned right based upon the contributions and earnings of the individual. As an earned right, the individual is eligible to receive his benefit in dignity and self-respect.”[87]\n\nThe majority not only overlooked ignored legislative history, Black continued, it overlooked binding legal precedents. Consider the 1934 case Lynch v. United States, which involved beneficiaries of War Risk Insurance, a WWI-era federal program that Congress subsequently repealed. The beneficiaries claimed that the repeal deprived them of property without due process of law, and the Court agreed. “[W]ar risk policies, being contracts, are property and create vested rights”; taking such property without just compensation violated the Fifth Amendment.[88] Black complained that the Nestor majority conveniently “puts the Lynch case aside.”[89]\n\nLast, Black invoked the very real expectations that Social Security created. “People who pay premiums for insurance usually think they are paying for insurance,” Justice Black wrote. They pay for security, not for the “flexibility and boldness” that the majority cited. Congress could deny coverage to new people or refuse to increase its obligations to existing beneficiaries, “[b]ut that is quite different from disappointing the just expectations of the contributors to the fund which the Government has compelled them and their employers to pay its Treasury.”[90] Justice Black denigrated the standard of review that the majority applied to such a flagrant act of dispossession. It amounted to no review at all.[91]\n\nThe End of Insurance and the Making of “New Property”\n\nWhen the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Flemming v. Nestor the public appeared unconcerned. Although the Court had not framed its decision in terms of loyalty, journalists characterized the case as just another one involving a “Red,” not applicable to loyal Americans[92] (a lacuna in coverage that at least one historian of Social Security finds shocking).[93] Some legal scholars took note, as they did with all cases handed down by the nation’s highest court, but their tone was detached and academic; most did not recognize or sympathize with the decision’s meaning for Social Security contributors.[94] The lone exception, it appears, was blind activist and professor Jacobus tenBroek, who in a speech to the San Diego Urban League characterized Nestor as part of an attack on the original meaning of Social Security and an example of the dangerous penetration of criminal law into social welfare programs.[95] TenBroek was right to emphasize Nestor’s importance. The case addressed one of the biggest unresolved questions of the American welfare state: the nature of its payouts.\n\nThis was indeed an open question. Politicians had their own ways of explaining the program to their constituents, while private insurers—the SSA’s main competitors—frantically broadcast a different message.[96] And within the federal government (never a policymaking monolith to begin with), different individuals, agencies, and branches of government had distinct interpretations of this crucial piece of the welfare state. Officials in the Social Security Administration, for example, were disturbed by Nestor. The director of the Bureau of Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, Victor Christgau, called Nestor’s portrayal of Social Security “quite unfortunate” and criticized Justice Department lawyers for telling the Court that old-age, survivors, and disability insurance was something other than “insurance.” The positions of HEW and the SSA were “quite to the contrary,” he emphasized.[97]Nestor essentially forced that disagreement into the open and required the Court to resolve it.[98] Today, despite Christgau’s grumblings, the SSA uses Nestor to show that benefits are “an earned right” only in the “moral and political sense,” not the “legal, contractual sense”; Social Security is not a “handout” but neither is it “a matter of right.” Nestor definitively settled the issue.[99]\n\nIf Flemming v. Nestor rejected one idea (that a person could have a traditional property- or contract-based right to Social Security benefits), it opened up space for another. Nestor attracted the attention of Yale professor Charles Reich, who made the case the centerpiece of his 1964 article “The New Property.”[100] In this classic artifact of legal liberalism, Reich articulated a vision of individual liberty and government largess that aimed to push the welfare state under the protective umbrella of the Constitution and prevent McCarthy-style persecution from happening again.\n\nOften historians and legal scholars do not associate “The New Property” with the issues of the 1950s because it had such a great impact in the late 1960s and 1970s, and because shortly after “The New Property” Reich started working on The Greening of America, his famous encomium to the consciousness of youth.[101] The article thus seems enmeshed in the social, political, and cultural upheaval of the sixties. It is also true that “The New Property” was not aimed at McCarthyism; if anything, it was aimed at establishing welfare rights. But as Robert Rabin astutely observed, “The New Property” is “firmly grounded in the political and cultural trauma of the Fifties.”[102] More specifically, it is grounded in Reich’s observations about how a powerful state, strengthened by its authority over New Deal social welfare programs, could enforce political and ideological conformity.\n\nFrom the late-1940s to the mid-1950s, according to Ellen Schrecker, “Americans at every level of society genuinely believed that Communism endangered the nation.” There were enough instances of supposed subversion, espionage, and sabotage to convince many people that communists were trying to undermine the American government and way of life.[103] People scrambled to protect the country, as well as their own reputations and institutions. The federal government implemented loyalty tests for employment, pursuant to executive order, but many private employers followed voluntarily. (Security-related industries adopted particularly stringent loyalty-security criteria, as did industries like law, education, communication, and entertainment).[104] State and local governments did their part by conditioning the use of public spaces and resources on loyalty, monitoring everything from fishing privileges to drivers’ licenses. Meanwhile, after several decades of steady public sector growth in which many families grew dependent on government employment,[105] officials enthusiastically rooted out subversive employees, often with flimsy evidence and Kafkaesque procedures.[106]\n\nCharles Reich, who during his years in Washington, D.C. sometimes went over to the Capitol “to watch Senator McCarthy and experience firsthand the atmosphere of fear and conformity which had taken over much of our government,” had several connections to victims of anticommunist zeal.[107] One was Dr. Edward K. Barsky. An executive board member of the apparently suspicious Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, Barsky received a subpoena from the House Committee on Un-American Activities in April 1946. Barsky and seventeen fellow board members were cited for contempt when they refused to surrender the organization’s records. Barsky paid a $500 fine and served a six-month sentence, but his ordeal was far from over. For his “crime” the State of New York suspended (and threatened to revoke) his license to practice medicine. Barsky sued, arguing that New York “deprive[d] him of property in his license and his established practice, without due process of law.”[108] Barsky’s case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, where Justice Black and his young law clerk, Reich, took great interest.\n\nReich had been thinking about the anticommunist manipulation of government-issued licenses, government jobs, and government services for several years. In 1951 Reich helped a fellow editor on the Yale Law Journal conceptualize a Note on passport denial, at the time a favorite State Department “weapon in the anti-communist crusade.”[109] On a more personal level, Reich feared he would be denied membership to the New York bar in 1952 because of his past associations. One of Reich’s mentors at Yale, Thomas Emerson, had earned the nickname “Tommy the Commie”[110] for his political work and Reich remembered “many rumors that the Committee [on Character and Fitness] would reject anyone thought to harbor left-wing tendencies.”[111] Meanwhile, as a Supreme Court clerk, Reich daily “read briefs and listened to arguments involving people who had been persecuted, exiled, or destroyed by their own government.”[112] Ultimately neither the government nor the bar association questioned Reich’s loyalty, but he lived with the knowledge that an arbitrary official action could take something precious from him. This may explain why Reich spent so “many hours and days discussing and debating” Barsky’s appeal in Justice Black’s chambers, even though a clear majority of the Court found the state’s action unobjectionable.[113] The case would come back to Reich in the early 1960s as he considered the holding in Flemming v. Nestor.\n\nIn 1960, when the Supreme Court issued its decision in Nestor, anticommunists seemed unaware of their victory. Meanwhile, both Fedya Nestor and his wife Barbara were far removed from the proceedings. Yet Nestor stood out, at least to Reich, because it epitomized what was particularly dangerous about this Red Scare. Anticommunists were not simply raiding union offices or jailing alleged radicals; they were throwing the full force of the welfare state behind their efforts.[114] They had gone beyond demanding loyalty oaths for high-security government jobs to demanding such oaths for almost all publicly administered goods, from professional licenses to housing.[115] And now they were imposing political conditions on a mandatory retirement savings program, a program grounded firmly in the language of entitlement (and thus supposedly above politics). Yes, the spirit of McCarthyism seemed to be flagging, and Nestor’s facts seemed too unique to stir fear in most Americans, but the case was an egregious example of a pattern of government conduct that had no discernible limit. The American welfare state had created expectations among its constituents—more and more every year, Reich observed—yet few protections existed to prevent legislators and administrators from exploiting these expectations should some future need to enforce loyalty or conformity arise.[116] Laws in the early 1960s that subjected welfare mothers to “midnight searches” (for men in their beds and men’s clothing in their closets) were one worrisome indication of the government’s latent power. The holding in Flemming v. Nestor was another.[117]\n\nThe term “welfare state” entered the American lexicon in the late 1940s, when opponents of Truman’s “Fair Deal” attempted to portray the program as a corruptor of American individualism and a communist plot. The term was an epithet to some, while to others it had positive connotations. In general, the existence of a “welfare state” in America was far from accepted.[118]By the late 1950s, however, scholars had recognized that the United States had a “welfare state” system of social welfare provision (or, as one law professor put it, a “welfare state standard” regarding poverty).[119] They also realized that whether good or bad, this increasingly extensive and complex system challenged traditional American values, customs, and legal concepts.[120] Reich’s “The New Property” married these concerns about the nature of the welfare state with the civil liberties questions raised by McCarthyism.\n\n“The New Property” catalogued the many ways in which “the valuables dispensed by government” were “steadily taking the place of traditional forms of wealth” and leaving Americans more dependent, often involuntarily, on the government. Income and benefits, jobs and occupational licenses, public resources and services—our wealth is increasingly in the form of these intangible goods, Reich told his readers, yet these goods are ours only by the grace of the government.[121] And the government, according to Reich, had misused its power in the past. He needed only gesture to the case law of the 1950s: Barsky v. Board of Regents,[122]Homer v. Richmond,[123]Borrow v. Federal Communications Commission[124]—and, of course, Nestor, the decision from the end of the McCarthy era that Reich considered “the most important of all judicial decisions concerning government largess.”[125] “The implications of Flemming v. Nestor are profound,” wrote Reich:\n\nNo form of government largess is more personal or individual than an old age pension. No form is more clearly earned by the recipient, who, together with his employer, contributes to the Social Security fund during the years of his employment. No form is more obviously a compulsory substitute for private property; the tax on wage earner and employer might readily have gone to higher pay and higher private savings instead. No form is more relied on, and more often thought of as property. No form is more vital to the independence and dignity of the individual.\n\nThe fact that the government could take this “property” away suggested a feudal order, Reich said, in which “[w]ealth is not ‘owned,’ or ‘vested’ in the holders” but rather “held conditionally” and subject to “the fulfillment of obligations imposed by the state.”[126] This “new feudalism” should disturb all Americans, he argued, because it eroded the essence of American national character: individualism and independence.[127] The Social Security pension system, for example, ostensibly “assur[ed] old people a stable, dignified, and independent basis of retirement,” consonant with American social values. Yet in Nestor “Congress and the Supreme Court jeopardized all these values to serve a public policy both trivial and vindictive—the punishment of a few persons for Communist Party membership now long past.”[128] A “feudal philosophy of largess and tenure may well be characteristic of collective societies,” like Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia, but it was not the American way.[129]\n\nReich proposed a deceptively simple solution. The institution of private property had long protected the individual against both the power of the state and the “ruthless pressures” of collective society, Reich argued, combining a Lockean understanding of property with his own dash of anticommunism.[130] In light of changing circumstances Americans needed to “create a new property” to perform this function. They needed a definition of property that encompassed diverse forms of government largess and endowed them with the procedural protections surrounding traditional forms of property, like hearings before fair tribunals, judicial review, and the opportunity to cross-examine evidence. As with traditional forms of property, “[t]he presumption should be that the professional man will keep his license, and the welfare recipient his pension,” Reich explained. And “[i]f revocation is necessary, not by reason of the fault of the individual holder, but by reason of overriding demands of public policy, perhaps payment of just compensation would be appropriate,” just as it would be if the government took a man’s land.[131] This would ensure that all citizens had the necessary modicum of property to be independent, upright citizens, capable of participating in the polity.[132] In essence, it was a solution to what Justice Douglas in 1949 called “the foremost problem of society”: “to cultivate and preserve incentive and independence for the individual and security for the masses of the people.”[133] It was also a brilliant sleight of hand. As Gregory Alexander explains, Reich’s theory not only justified legal recognition of the individual property interest in entitlements like Nestor’s Social Security benefits, which “are easily squared with the classical liberal theory of the legitimate means of acquiring property rights,” but also the property interest in “the true welfare benefit.”[134]\n\nReich’s argument proved to be one of the most influential of the late twentieth century. On the twenty-fifth anniversary of “The New Property,” the editors of the University of San Francisco Law Review found hundreds of journal pieces and at least fifty important cases that relied on “The New Property.”[135] The most consequential was Goldberg v. Kelly (1970), the case in which, to use the words of one critic, Justice Brennan attempted to transform Reich’s “academic and philosophical insights about the nature of property into the imperative language of constitutional law.”[136] In Goldberg, the Supreme Court not only mandated an evidentiary hearing before the termination of welfare benefits (a hefty procedural protection), Brennan suggested that welfare entitlements may now be “more like ‘property’ than a ‘gratuity.'” “Much of the existing wealth in this country takes the form of rights that do not fall within traditional common-law concepts of property,” Brennan explained, but this wealth needs property’s traditional protections.[137]\n\nIronically, Justice Black vehemently dissented, signaling that his protégé had carried the notion of property too far, that the leftist deportee Fedya Nestor really was more deserving than the welfare recipient John Kelly. “It somewhat strains credulity,” Black wrote, “to say that the government’s promise of charity to an individual is property belonging to that individual when the government denies that the individual is honestly entitled to receive such a payment.” He accused the majority of interpreting the Due Process Clause to “forbid [] any conduct that a majority of the Court believes ‘unfair,’ ‘indecent,’ or ‘shocking to their consciences,'” an interpretation that could easily allow the clause to “swallow up all other parts of the Constitution.” He also predicted that the effect of the decision would be just the opposite of what Reich intended: “that the government will not put a claimant on the rolls initially until it has made an exhaustive investigation to determine his eligibility”; people in desperate need would be disserved.[138]\n\nBlack’s gauge of bureaucratic behavior proved prescient, but in the short term Goldberg was a major victory for the diffuse “poor people’s movement” of public housing tenants, welfare mothers, legal services lawyers, and civil rights activists. It raised their hopes of constitutionalizing a more just, humane social order and gave them a weapon to use in their ground-level battles for welfare rights.[139]Goldberg also appeared to catalyze a “due process explosion” in which the Court “carried the hearing requirement from one new area of government action to another.”[140] The decision produced “considerable progeny in the Supreme Court and a much larger brood in the lower courts”: under its framework, the Court mandated that hearings precede the suspension of driver’s licenses, the repossession of chattels, the revocation of parole or probation, and even a student’s ten-day suspension from school.[141] By 1975, Judge Friendly famously wondered “whether government can do anything to a citizen without affording him ‘some kind of hearing.'”[142]\n\nThe answer, it turned out, was “yes.” By the following year, the Supreme Court held in Mathews v. Eldridge that the federal government did not have to provide an evidentiary hearing before terminating a person’s Social Security disability benefits. This decision also inaugurated a “balancing test” for due process cases, in which the Court weighed the so-called “private interest” against “the Government’s interest,” including the fiscal and administrative burdens that greater procedural protections would entail.[143] Although this approach continued to acknowledge the valuable interests that the welfare state created, it took the magic out of the word “property.” Whether a government benefit was “property” or not became curiously irrelevant.\n\nIn the end, then, “The New Property” did not lead to a revolution in constitutional law, nor did it result in greater security for most clients of the nation’s social welfare programs. Reich himself eventually acknowledged that “the moderate, due process, cost-benefit approach” of “The New Property” “must surely be deemed a failure” because “it does not work.”[144] Yet in at least one way it succeeded beyond Reich’s expectations: drawing on cases like Nestor, “The New Property” called attention to the tensions inherent in a state that guaranteed both social security and domestic security; it vividly illustrated the connections between the nation’s most progressive impulses and its darkest. These are observations that haunted other intellectuals of the post-war period and that haunt us still today.\n\nConclusion\n\nFedya Nestor’s stepdaughter, Dorothy Healey, was the last person in her family to see Fedya alive. In June 1961 Dorothy went with six other American communist leaders to Eastern Europe, where she found Fedya “a sadly disillusioned man.” “He had set off with such eagerness,” she remembered, but life in Bulgaria was not what he expected.[145] A high school sweetheart put him up for a time, but eventually threw him out. The Bulgarian government had no use for his perpetual motion machine or his political ideas. According to Barbara, Fedya wrote to her begging to return to the U.S., but she could do nothing for him.[146] His life seems to have ended in loneliness and disappointment.\n\nFedya Nestor’s encounter with the legal system, at least, demands remembering. The case not only set a vital precedent for all contributors to the Social Security program, it captured a complex moment in American history. The nation was at once grappling with political and ideological threats, adjusting to the changes wrought by World War II, and puzzling out the meaning of its welfare state, all while attempting to preserve the integrity of sacred concepts like “liberty” and “property.” Nestor’s case also anticipates some of the major disputes and concerns of the 1960s. As the war on domestic communism transitioned to a war on poverty and a war in Vietnam, Nestor’s questions about the nature of government largess, the scope of government responsibility, and the exercise of government power became even more pressing.\n\nMost important, Flemming v. Nestor should prompt scholars to think about the history of social welfare policy in new ways and to reevaluate periods that appear quiescent.[147] The case and its trajectory highlight the crooked path by which the American welfare state has developed (a path that traveled through the courts), the toll the welfare state has taken on competing interests like civil liberties, and the unusual combination of “insiders” and “outsiders,” the powerful and the powerless, that shaped its story. Often historians of the American welfare state turn to legislative debates, cabinet discussions, and boardroom meetings to understand the unique structure of American social welfare provision, overlooking the role of the courts and their diverse array of litigants. But as Susan Sterett has written in her work on public pension cases, the accessibility of the American court system ensured that “it was not only social workers and social insurance advocates and their legislative opponents who shaped policy,” but also the range of Americans that took their complaints to court—people like railroad executives, “cranky taxpayers,” and county commissioners. In this way, the law functioned “not only as a structure but as a site of contest”: “[l]itigation in specific cases contested the meanings that common-law categories contained for public payments.”[148] Cases like Flemming v. Nestor should urge historians to extend Sterett’s analysis beyond public pensions to public support of all kinds, beyond the New Deal era to subsequent decades of welfare state development and retrenchment, and beyond “cranky taxpayers” to welfare mothers, disbarred lawyers, “subversive” government employees, and evicted public housing tenants. Through their seemingly personal disputes—which often occurred right under the noses of crucial policymakers, administrators, and activists—litigants negotiated the boundaries, meaning, and power of the American welfare state.\n\nKaren M.

The mass-circulation news magazines such as Time and Newsweek did not mention the case. The decision and its shattering, momentous implications went undiscussed in the mainstream press. It was not like the aftermath of Helvering v. Davis [the 1937 case establishing the constitutionality of the Social Security program].” John Attarian, Social Security: False Consciousness and Crisis (New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 2002), 221. I found minimal coverage in the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times but none in other major papers like the Wall Street Journal or the Chicago Defender.

See, e.g., Deroy Murdock, “It’s Not Your Money,” American Enterprise 10 (1999): 76; Charles E. Rounds, Jr., “You Have No Legal Right to Social Security,” Consumers’ Research Magazine 80 (2000): 4; Robert Samuelsen, “Lots of Gain and No Pain!” Newsweek 145 (2005): 41 (discussing the pervasive belief that Social Security is an entitlement; citing Nestor as the myth-busting decision “you’ve never heard of”).\n\n6.ï¿½ President Franklin Delano Roosevelt famously claimed that this rhetoric would guarantee contributors “a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions.” Quoted in William E. Leuchtenburg, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal (New York: Harper & Row, 1963), 133.\n\n7.ï¿½Nestor became an important precedent for the Social Security Administration (SSA), which today maintains the full text of the decision on its website. Social Security Administration, “Supreme Court Case: Flemming v. Nestor,” http://www.ssa.gov/history/nestor.html (25 April 2006). Nestor is also a case that conservative judges cite whenever a person challenges a restricted or terminated social welfare benefit. For example in Weinberger v. Salfi, where Concetta Salfi challenged a provision of the Social Security Act that prohibited her from receiving widow’s benefits because she had not been married to her wage-earner husband long enough, Justice Rehnquist used Nestor as “the standard for testing the validity of Congress’ Social Security classification.” To him this meant that a restriction passed muster unless it “manifests a patently arbitrary classification, utterly lacking in rational justification.” 422 U.S. 749, 768 (1975). See also Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U.S. 78 (1971) (upholding a HEW decision to reduce Social Security benefits to beneficiaries also receiving state workmen’s compensation).\n\n8.ï¿½ It has, however, been called into question by subsequent Supreme Court characterizations of other government benefits. As attorney Matthew Hawes writes, “Logic dictates that any property interests recognized by the Court for welfare recipients should be more ephemeral than those ‘bought’ through contribution as in Social Security. Yet, just ten years after refusing to recognize any protectable rights for Social Security recipients, the Supreme Court first found constitutional protections for welfare beneficiaries in Goldberg v. Kelly.” Hawes calls Nestor “outdated case law.” Matthew H. Hawes, “So No Damn Politician Can Ever Scrap It: The Constitutional Protection of Social Security Benefits,” University of Pittsburgh Law Review 65 (Summer 2004): 898, 907; Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1969). See also Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976) (holding that continued receipt of Social Security disability benefits is a “statutorily created ‘property’ interest protected by the Fifth Amendment”).\n\n9.ï¿½ For an excellent review of the literature on law and the American state and a discussion of how scholars could examine law and courts more fruitfully, see John D.

Goluboff, The Lost Promise of Civil Rights (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2007), 5.\n\n11.ï¿½ Historians have long recognized “McCarthyism” as a problematic term. To borrow the words of M. J. Heale, “[Joseph R. McCarthy] did not inspire the anticommunist cause, to which he came very late. He contributed no new ideas, fashioned no legislation, commanded no coherent organization; he only briefly chaired a Senate committee, and that a minor one, and his tactics did lasting harm to his own mission.” M. J. Heale, American Anticommunism: Combating the Enemy Within,1830–1970 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990), 150. The term “McCarthyism” is also “invariably pejorative,” suggesting at best “an unfortunate overreaction to a genuine danger” and at worst “a conscious campaign to wipe out dissent.” Ellen Schrecker, Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America (Boston: Little, Brown, 1998), xii. Furthermore, “McCarthyism” denotes an aberrant period rather than one grounded in beliefs many Americans share today: that some ideologies are simply outside the sphere of “politics,” that the nation’s protections do not extend to its enemies, and that civil liberties must yield in times of war. Yet there are also good reasons for accepting the term. Heale notes that “before the eyes of the country and indeed of the world it was McCarthy who became the personification of American anticommunism, and for a time press and politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen, Congress and White House treated him as a power in the land.” Heale, American Anticommunism, 150. Historians have also adopted the term as their own, using it to refer to the efforts of “a broad coalition of politicians, bureaucrats, and other anticommunist activists” during the late 1940s and 1950s to “eliminate the alleged threat of domestic Communism” by “hound[ing]” a generation of radicals, their associates, and their institutions. Schrecker, Many Are the Crimes, xii. I use the term in this broader context and with a wariness of the crusade-like imagery it invokes.\n\n12.ï¿½ See, e.g., Blackman v.

The article had dramatic implications: it suggested that economic rights—for even the nation’s least “deserving”—should be on par with the freedoms in the Bill of Rights. But “The New Property” was not a radical text. Although Reich associated with various “leftwing” individuals and causes throughout his career, he wrote “The New Property” when he was part of a cohort at Yale Law School that was “relentlessly ambitious,” “politically timid,” and averse to activism. Laura Kalman, Yale Law School and the Sixties: Revolt and Reverberations (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2005), 50.

Nestor, interview, June 11, 1975, interview 10b segment 6 segkey: a1680.\n\n23.ï¿½ Once when Fedya was distributing the publication he told an unemployed black female acquaintance that he knew of a maid job for her, a remark she interpreted as chauvinistic and racist.

Barbara also insisted that Fedya was not “independent in his thinking” about the Party, instead following her and her daughter. “He wouldn’t read things himself unless [Dorothy] told him to.” Nestor, interview, December 27, 1974, interview 06d segment 4 segkey: a1608.\n\n27.ï¿½ Healey and Isserman, Dorothy Healey Remembers, 122.

Dorothy recalled that “[b]y 1951 the FBI was following my every move” and that every day she woke up to find “three carloads of FBI men” sitting in front of her house, which followed her as she drove her son to school and ran her errands. Government inquisitors at both the state and federal level also demanded her testimony.

Nestor, interview, December 27, 1974, interview 06d segment 3 segkey: a1606. This observation highlights the role of gender in Cold War political culture and practice, as well as how federal officials may have used the gendered nature of the welfare state for their punitive purposes. As Linda Gordon and others have discussed, the American welfare state developed in a fundamentally gendered way, privileging traditionally male occupations and rewarding male heads of families. Gordon, Pitied But Not Entitled: Single Mothers and the History of Welfare, 1890–1935 (New York: Freedom Press, 1994). By deporting Fedya, the family member with the most honorable and legitimate claims on the American welfare state, federal officials covertly punished Barbara and Dorothy.

Barbara also insisted that Fedya’s deportation was his fault: the socialist regime in Bulgaria normally would not accept deportees, but Fedya surreptitiously got a friend in the Bulgarian government to grant him the visa he needed.

They believed that the Cold War brought a “wave” of government repression “such as this country has never seen before.” Intending to become “prosperous corporation lawyers” they instead became, as they liked to joke, “unprosperous civil liberties lawyers.” Folder 14, Series II, The Forer and Rein Research Collection, 1941–2000, Historical Society of Washington, D.C.\n\n47.ï¿½ According to Schrecker, the FBI eagerly provided information to the ABA and local bar associations about left-wing lawyers’ groups and lawyers to facilitate internal anticommunist purges. Meanwhile, any attorney who relied on the Fifth Amendment risked disbarment for poor “moral character.” Not all members of the bar joined in anticommunist persecution, but “[t]he bar’s timidity made it almost impossible for Communists and alleged Communists to obtain counsel—especially if they did not want to be represented by someone who was already tainted [by having defended a communist].” Schrecker, Many Are the Crimes, 301–5; Belknap, Cold War Political Justice, 219–31. Bar associations at all levels also imposed loyalty oaths and refused admission to applicants with the slightest leftist leanings. See, e.g., Schware v. Board of Examiners, 353 U.S. 232 (1957) (reviewing a 1954 decision by the New Mexico State Board of Bar Examiners to deny Rudolph Schware’s application to take the bar exam because of his past CP membership, prior arrest record, and use of aliases); Konigsberg v. State Bar, 353 U.S. 252 (1957) (reviewing the California State Bar’s refusal to grant certification to Raphael Konigsberg for his refusal to answer questions about his political associations). In 1950 the ABA House of Delegates adopted a resolution urging that all attorneys be required to file affidavits declaring whether they were or had been members of the CP. In 1951 the House of Delegates voted unanimously to urge lawyers’ groups to expel all communists and advocates of Marxism-Leninism from legal practice. In 1953 the same body called for lawyers’ groups to examine any attorneys who invoked the Fifth Amendment for “fitness to continue to practice.” Belknap, Cold War Political Justice, 220. As late as 1957 the ABA took a strong anticommunist stance. For example after the Yates decision (eviscerating the Smith Act), the House of Delegates favored a legislative reversal of the Court.

Tamm, however, was a judge who did not fear reversal when he felt strongly enough. “When one is convinced that his dissent is predicated upon lawful grounds then there’s no hesitancy in continuing to dissent,” Tamm once told an interviewer, “and while the fact that a majority of the court may take the opposite side is sometimes frightening, it nevertheless is no reason for altering or changing one’s position.” Edward Tamm, interview by Alice O’Donnell, November 12, 1983, Federal Judicial Center, Washington, D.C.\n\n62.ï¿½Nestor v.

(They cite the starting date as 1962, when the conservative Charles Whittaker retired and the most articulate proponent of judicial restraint, Felix Frankfurter, resigned, replaced by Byron White and Arthur Goldberg.) The main divide on the Court in 1960 was between those like Justice Harlan, who believed that the Court could rationalize Congress’s actions for just about anything, thereby keeping laws in harmony with the Constitution, and people like Justice Black, who believed that devising benign, rational justifications for Congress’s actions was wrong when Congress never had such justifications in mind.

Cooper, Of Power and Right: Hugo Black, William O. Douglas, and America’s Constitutional Revolution (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992), 147. The most “notorious example” of the Court giving in to repressive anticommunism, according to Morton Horwitz, was Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951), in which the Court upheld eleven Smith Act convictions and eviscerated constitutional protections on free speech. Horwitz, The Warren Court, 57–59. Some decisions from this period are arguably better explained by certain justices’ predisposition to judicial restraint in cases implicating national security, but the most important point is that between 1950 and 1956 the Court as a collective “gave free rein to executive, legislative, and popular determination to destroy the domestic arm of the international Communist movement” by “accepting a generic ‘proof’ of Communism’s seditions nature” whereas after that period it was less willing.

Senator McCarthy pursued Brennan with his usual tactics during Brennan’s confirmation hearings, but only McCarthy himself voted against confirmation.\n\n75.ï¿½ Usually the Court avoided deciding cases on constitutional grounds (perhaps because of backlash over Brown), but by 1956 it was frequently overturning persecutions of alleged subversives on technical or procedural grounds. See, e.g., Schware, 353 U.S. 232 (1957) (holding that the New Mexico board of bar examiners denied Schware the right to practice law without due process when it found his past membership in the Communist Party and his use of aliases to raise “substantial doubts” about his moral character); Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513 (1958) (holding that California had used unconstitutional procedures to enforce a law making “nonadvocacy of overthrow of government by unlawful means” a condition precedent to a tax exemption); Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535 (1959) (holding that the procedures that the secretary of the interior followed in dismissing a government employee fell short of the requirements of due process).

Horwitz attributes the apparent retrenchment to the Jenner-Butler Bill, an anti-Court measure that Congress considered after the Court overrode Congressional committees and decrees on “Red Monday.” Horwitz, The Warren Court, 64–65.

Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 622 (1960) (Black, J., dissenting).\n\n90.ï¿½ Ibid., 624.\n\n91.ï¿½ Though Justice Douglas did not join Black’s dissent, he shared many of Black’s concerns. Douglas characterized a person’s accrued social benefits as “part of his property benefits.” He, too, cited Senator George’s characterization of Social Security as “an earned right.” Ibid., 630–31 (Douglas, J., dissenting).\n\n92.ï¿½ The entry in the New York Time’s Supreme Court round-up was as follows: “Upheld, 5 to 4, the constitutionality of a Congressional statute depriving certain deported aliens of Social Security benefits that they would otherwise have been entitled to.” “Supreme Court Actions,” New York Times, June 21, 1960. A more extensive piece noted the Court’s rejection of the idea of “accrued property rights” in Social Security, but focused on Nestor’s unique factual circumstances. “High Court Rejects Pension Plea by Man Deported as Former Red,” New York Times, June 21, 1960.\n\n93.ï¿½ See note 4 above.\n\n94.ï¿½ Among full-length law review articles on the case, I found only one that focused on the Court’s refusal to recognize accrued benefits as property rights: James P. Lewis, “The Property Interest in Social Security Benefits,” Maryland Law Review 21 (1961): 331–44. The several other articles focused on different aspects. See, e.g., “Retroactivity and First Amendment Rights,” University of Pennsylvania Law Review 110 (1961–1962): 394–435 and “Bill of Attainder and the Supreme Court in 1960—Flemming v. Nestor,” Washington University Law Quarterly (1961): 402–24.\n\n95.ï¿½ Jacobus tenBroek, “Social Security: Today’s Challenge in Public Welfare,” Vital Speeches of the Day 27 (1961): 411–15. For greater discussion of tenBroek’s role in shaping and critiquing the American welfare state, see Felicia Kornbluh, “A Disabled State: How Blind Activists Created Modern Social Welfare Policy” (paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Legal History, Baltimore, Md., November 17, 2006).\n\n96.ï¿½ The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and the National Association of Life Underwriters (NALU) had long tried to convince the public that Social Security was no substitute for real insurance. In fact, the Nestor opinion perfectly reinforced a recent NALU resolution to oppose use of insurance terminology in the Social Security Act. Carlyle Dunaway, general counsel to the NALU, noted that “the decision [Nestor] could prove extremely helpful to NALU in its current campaign to persuade Congress to delete all insurance terminology from the Social Security Act and to insert in the Act a forthright declaration that the Social Security program is not, and is not to be represented as, an insurance program.” Statement of Carlyle M. Dunaway, National Association News 55 (1960): 70, quoted in Lewis, “The Property Interest in Social Security Benefits,” 343 n 63.
