H | SeeSOR®\n\nHuntsville, Alabama\n\nArizona\n\nIt was and continues to be a pleasure working with Alex Spurr. I appreciated all her help and guidance. Her services are superior and her fees are reasonable.\n\nLinda Radke, Five Star Publications, Inc. | Story Monsters® and Story Monsters Ink®\n\nChandler, Arizona\n\nI am very pleased to have chosen SAUSSER SUMMERS, PC to file my trademark with USPTO. It started with a brief conversation with Brent. He advised me how best to proceed, I paid the fee, and my paperwork was ready to go within just a few days. He was very thorough and communicative throughout the whole process. This is a very good service that you provide. Glad I did not attempt to complete this process on my own. After reading what was submitted, I have no doubts that my unaided application would have been rejected for lack of detail. There is a lot to know. Thanks for helping me accomplish something that I put off for years. I’m looking forward to a successful result.\n\nDonna Tetreault | Sacred Waves\n\nTucson, Arizona\n\nVery efficient and affordable service.\n\nJohnny Mulder Mulder, Globotek USA, Inc. | ARIZONA BALLOONS®\n\nGlendale, Arizona\n\nArkansas\n\nAfter talking with Brent, and his staff I knew I had found the right people to take care of our needs. They kept in contact through the entire process, and led us the right with NO upsell. I’ll use Brent and this firm for all of our business needs. Thanks Brent.\n\nJason Baggett | CONTINGEN$E®\n\nMansfield, Arkansas\n\nI’d spent years debating whether or not I should apply for a trademark, but there didn’t seem to be a great deal of information available that helped me understand the process and/or actually confirm that doing so would be beneficial to my small business. As my business grew, I eventually realized I needed to invest in registering and I initially attempted to file myself, but just didn’t have the time or patience to rummage through all the legalese. I was extremely hesitant to hire a lawyer over the internet, but my local options were limited. The reviews and testimonials on the website for OnlineTrademarkAttorneys.com seemed legitimate, so I inquired via email and received a friendly response from Alex in less than 24 hours. I was able to complete the whole process after only 1 phone call and a few emails. I am overwhelmingly impressed with the entire transaction and professionalism of OnlineTrademarkAttorneys.com. The application and fees were affordable and Alex was responsive, friendly, fast, and accurate. The entire process was so painless, I highly recommend anyone seeking similar representation to look no further – it doesn’t get any better than this!\n\nJaimie Finley | POP-BLOX\n\nJonesboro, Arrkansas\n\nCalifornia\n\nI am general counsel for a large national real estate franchise company. Our trademarks are our bread and butter. After spending months dealing with office actions and bureaucracy while trying to register a mark our company had invested substantial effort into growing, I turned to SAUSSER & SPURR, LLC for help. The firm was professional and competent and had our registration completed soon after they were retained. The costs were very reasonable compared to other specialty firms and the time required of me and my team was minimal. I only wish I had reached out sooner. I highly recommend SAUSSER & SPURR, LLC for your trademark related legal needs.\n\nChristopher Moles, Esq. | Intero Real Estate Services, Inc.\n\nCupertino, California\n\nAlex Spurr helped me obtain my trademark hassle free!

Alex quickly understood the nature of my business, the work I do and the best strategy for ensuring success. I highly recommend the services of Sausser and Summers!\n\nLori Leyden | The Grace Process\n\nSanta Barbara, California\n\nI needed someone who could explain a process I did not know much about, and that is exactly what Alex did. She took the time to figure out what I needed, and explained clearly the best path to get there. This can be a very confusing process, but Alex made it very easy. She is very knowledgable and also a pleasure to work with. If I have friends or family that need marks, I would not hesitate to send them to Alex!\n\nRick Robles | Shoe Biters\n\nSanta Barbara, California\n\nI can’t thank the team enough for all the great work they’ve done.

Highly recommended!\n\nPeter Hwang | FATBOM®\n\nSanta Monica, California\n\nSausser Summers is a great law firm but it was only one person I interacted with. So she is the face of the whole firm to me. Alex Summers was really great to work with. I liked how she was fast to respond to whatever was necessary to get my trademark filed quickly and correctly. On top of every detail. Giving me the information I needed to ensure a successful filing into the Principal Database. It’s not hard to find an attorney to file something and it’s never cheap. I have experience with that. Alex told me what I needed to do to satisfy the requirements of Amazon and the trademark office. It was the knowledge of doing business with Amazon that brought me to Sausser Summers but I’ll reach out to Alex where ever she is working. Thank you all for your hard work in my behalf.

I found the OnlineTrademarkAttorneys.com after receiving an office action letter for the trademark I personally submitted. The office action letter did not look promising given the refusal classification. I was hesitant about getting an attorney involved given the complexity of my case. Nevertheless, after months of thinking about this I decided to see if Brent could help me out and turn thing around. He was honest and transparent about the process and I am happy to announce that my trademark got approved! It took me one year to come full circle and I am happy with the support Brent provided along the way. I recommend you hire a professional when it comes to trademark filing (don’t do what I did, being scrappy is not the best way to go with trademarks)…it will save you time and money in the end and you’ll have a better chance at getting things process the first time. Thanks for the help Brent!\n\nWendy Cartagena | Invested Millennial\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nHow easy it is to get the help you need on the phone, NOT!

He even answered my stupider questions without making me feel stupid…They should call Brent “Painless Parker”…but then he’d have to change his name to Parker. He probably already has cards printed. All kidding aside, my business attorney ran out of “Intellectual law” referrals…They’re happy to have whats his name to refer clients to.\n\nCraig Kennedy | Nevada Sierra Capital LLC\n\nBurbank, California\n\nAlex is an exceptional attorney in the trademark field. She’s timely, professional, and an all around good person that I would not hesitate to recommend for trademark work.\n\nRobert Richardson\n\nSan Francisco, California\n\nWe’ve worked with Alex of Sausser Summers, PC on multiple trademarks to date. We trust her to handle our trademark services because of the thoroughness of her work, great legal advice and timely responsiveness. The firm’s services are more than fair for the marketplace and we plan to be repeat customers for as long as they’ll have us.\n\nYume H.| Yume Consults LLC\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nGreat working with Alex, right off the bat she advised me that a trademark I had in mind that was similar to one owned by a big trademark-aggressive company was likely to be challenged by the said company. That insight helped me with rebranding and simplifying my message and coming up with a better mark that Alex has just filed for me, suggesting additional materials to include to make the mark more likely to be accepted. I feel confident we’ve done all that could have been done, now it’s up to USPTO.\n\nDavor Magdic | Kinetronix\n\nSanta Barbara, California\n\nWe had a terrific experience with Online Trademarks Attorneys. Alex examined our USPTO account and very swiftly assessed where we needed to make corrections and how we ought to go about making them. She is extremely knowledgeable and made certain that we understood why the changes should made and how they would benefit our business in the long run. If you are looking for assistance filing new trademarks or simply want to feel confident that your existing trademarks are all correctly filed, I would suggest contacting Online Trademark Attorneys right away. Their pricing structure is very reasonable and the communication throughout the process made us feel very comfortable that we had chosen the right attorneys to work with.\n\nJason Edwards| Sisquoc Healthcare\n\nSanta Barbara, California\n\nI had the great, good fortune to find Alex Summers while searching the internet for a trademark attorney. The process is a thousand times more complicated than I ever imagined. To try this on my own would have required a tangle of confusion and inaccuracies – maybe worse.\n\nAlex is responsive in a timely manner, easy to talk to and explains things so well. Her follow-up is clear, concise, and reassuring. I knew I was in good hands the first time we spoke. I also knew I was in way over my head. My project was at a point where several critical steps needed to converge, quickly. (I suspect Alex has a superhero cape in her closet.)\n\nMost people do their jobs well. The exceptional ones are truly caring, careful, professional and totally versed in what they do. Alex Summers is exceptional.\n\nAnnette Matrisciano | Grandma Bunny\n\nThousand Oaks, California\n\nBrent is so easy to work with and responsive.

From the start point to the filing of our application and currently now waiting for the USPTO examiner opinion. Mr Brent explains throughly the process to follow to apply for registration of a trademark, answers any kind of questions immediately and is always willing and attempt to take action if necessary, which is highly valuable I believe for any Company. I appreciate their high sense of professionalism, work and service. I highly recommend Mr Brent Sausser and his firm Online Trademark Attorneys.\n\nRoberto Melendez | Nature Fountain\n\nGlendale, California\n\nIt’s been a pleasure working with you.\n\nDennis A Domingos | Dog Well\n\nLompoc, California\n\nThe Best Decision I made.

I’ve already recommended them to two other small business owners, and I plan to engage them on other trademark applications as my business grows. They will not disappoint.\n\nJames Wilson | Embrace> By We\n\nCumming, Georgia\n\nFlorida\n\nI have such tremendous gratitude for the way that Alex has guided me through the entire process of registering our trademark for The Simple Seeds. She has always been courteous, helpful, and extremely patient whenever I called her with one of my many questions or concerns. She never hesitated to give me good sound advice whenever I wasn’t sure about some aspect of things. She took the time to make sure I understood all of the details, and the timelines involved with the entire process. If you’re looking for someone to be there for you, then Alex is that person. All I have left to say is, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!\n\nR. Mesker | THE SIMPLE SEEDS®\n\nBrooksville, Florida\n\nOur first contact with Sausser & Spurr Law was on a Friday to apply for a trademark for which we expected no problem. Brent replied back to us on Monday, the next business day, to advise that we might expect a challenge to our mark from a major global player with a remotely similar name and a history of aggressively defending their brand. He clearly and concisely presented our options and prospective timelines relating to each. After deliberating that week we submitted a new name, and Brent responded just as quickly. Within 24 hours he reported that our new mark appears unlikely to face any challenges, and we filed our formal application on Friday. Brent’s expedient, thorough and efficient handling of our needs made a potentially stressful experience a genuine pleasure.\n\nPeter Stoddard | Sports Gear One\n\nSanta Rosa Beach, Florida\n\nI found Brent to be very easy to work with. He helped to educate me on the components of getting a trademark, what the government looks at, length of time and more. I found the services to be reasonably priced and am happy with what we got.\n\nSteve Sigal | PRISTINA ORGANICS®\n\nClearwater, Florida\n\nI began working with Alex and Brent at the very beginning stages of my business. I was very skeptical when I started because I had always been advised of exorbitant fees by any law firm that I had ever considered. Especially in this area of trademark law which involves research. I had liked that there were flat fees associated with the initial search so I decided to give it a try…I’m sure glad I did. This is one of the best firms I have ever hired. I paid a very fair rate and all rates were disclosed to me up front so there were no surprises. I plan on using this firm for many years to come. I really want to thank you for making what most would feel is a complicated process, a very simple one on my end.\n\nCarmen Piccolo | STOPBYUS®\n\nBoca Raton, Florida\n\nThank you for such a pleasant experience. Everything has handled smoothly and professionally. Great company and attorney to work with.

Definitely recommend 100%. Thank you\n\nLena Sonko | Illucence Beauty\n\nPalm Bay, Florida\n\nOnlineTrademarkAttorneys.com is an amazing company! I was referred to them by a successful business colleague. After trying other companies for trademarks in the past, it was night and day in comparison.

Very professional, affordable and fast turn around. Highly recommended!\n\nGabriel Alvarado | Zulay Kitchen\n\nClearwater, Florida\n\nI was referred to Brent and my experience was pleasant. Brent was patient and insightful as this was my first time ever dealing with trademarks. I had quite a few questions and he was willing to take his time in explaining the process(es) and how to best navigate them. It was worth every single penny incurred as I am a firm believer in the “DIY” attitude, but that may not always be the best path when it comes to the legal system. Brent was responsive and kept me in the loop throughout the entire process. I would be happy to work with him and his team again.\n\nDaniel Ferrer | HISPANIC HUSTLE, LLC\n\nFort Rockledge, Florida\n\nI was referred to OnlineTrademarkAttorneys.com by a good friend of mine. I was in need of a trademark for an online business and I did not know where exactly to begin, all I knew was that I needed a trademark to protect my brand. The attorney that I spoke with personally was Brent D. Sausser, Esq. Brent was very understanding of my situation and he was also able to explain to me in full detail what I needed to do. He broke down all of The Who, what, where and why’s to me in layman’s terms. He took the time to answer all of my questions and I am extremely happy that I have chosen their professional services. I would definitely recommend them to anyone in need of their services and I myself plan on using them again in the future.\n\nDwayne Adams | Winber Layne\n\nPort St Lucie, Florida\n\nIt’s was awesome and nice service and fast, Thank you so much\n\nAli Abedalnabi | Zeno Chargers & More\n\nBrandon, Florida\n\nI have only the best impressions of working with the OnlineTrademarkAttorneys.com, especially – with Alex Summers. As of now, we are in the process of trademark registration for Develux. I receive detailed comments on all my questions, as well as the necessary support. Starting from the stage of pre-screening and ending with the application submission – everything went quickly and successfully. Highly recommended.\n\nVladyslava Bondarchuk | Develux\n\nKissimmee, Florida\n\nI found this company doing a simple Google search. It was one of the top tanked sites and I liked their website so I inquired about filing a few trademarks. Brent called me within an hour and was great- very informative, easy going, no pressure. After I started the application I had a couple questions so I called back. He answered the phone, then answered my questions, no problem. The following email correspondence was clear, concise and on point, and the online application was simple. The trademarks were filed in a couple days. Thank you, Brent! -Scott Reus\n\nScott Reus | Reuster Media\n\nLargo, Florida\n\nIdaho\n\nI found Brent and Alex to be very efficient and thorough, and they successfully protected my trademark in a firm way, but without getting adversarial (which usually only costs us clients more money.) I appreciated their friendliness, politeness, and availability on the phone to clarify all details concerned and will definitely be using their services again. I highly recommend them.\n\nGage Tarrant | Congress of Quantum Masters®\n\nBonners Ferry, Idaho\n\nWhat a phenomenal business you offer for small companies to receive big law firm services for a fraction of the price. OnlineTrademarkAttorneys.com streamlined the trademark process, listed fee’s up front, called me the day I filled out their form and provided impeccable service for ridiculously reasonable rates.

We were sent to the supplemental register and there we waited. When our 5 years passed, I reached out to our current attorney and they said they just didn’t think we would be able to get our TM on the principal register and not to waste the money. So, I listened to them, but I was frustrated. It was our trademark, others were using it and even Amazon would not recognize our supplemental register listing! On a whim I googled trademark lawyers and Onlinetrademarkattorneys.com appeared. I figured it was worth a shot. Well holy cow, here I am 15 years later, celebrating our companies 20th anniversary and today – we are officially trademarked on the principal register. I can’t say enough good things about Brent & his team. They carried us to the finish line.\n\nJoseph Tantillo | GREEKGEAR®\n\nBelleville, Illinois\n\nAlex was wonderful to work with. Communication was prompt, precise, and above expectations. Will continue to leverage this firm in the future.\n\nGreg Masanz | Universal CableTether\n\nLoves Park, Illinois\n\nThank you Brent for your responses and for assisting us with our trademark.

They explained the process in detail, and told us exactly what to expect and when to expect it. The USPTO has a complicated process made easy by Sausser Summers. It is well worth the money to do it right the first time, and these individuals do just that. I highly recommend letting them help you protect your business.\n\nChad Hillard| Permit America, Inc.\n\nFrankfort, Kentucky\n\nLouisiana\n\nI was extremely pleased with the service provided by Brent and Alex.

Very helpful people, thanks so much for your service!\n\nAdam Speedy | Speedyvite®\n\nRosedale, Maryland\n\nIntellectual property law has many complexities; therefore, it remains critically important to hire a law firm with strong domain experience within that niche of the law. As CEO of CashDuel I would only use OnlineTrademarkAttorneys.com in this regard. They are extremely knowledgeable, prompt and flawless in execution.\n\nLeon Richardson | CashDuel LLC\n\nBaltimore, Maryland\n\nUsing OnlineTrademarkAttorneys.com was a breeze.

Will continue using their service in the future.\n\nYi Ding | PetPlex, LLC\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts\n\nOnlineTrademarkAttorneys.com (OTA) did a fantastic job of transferring a trademark I owned from one of my businesses to another. Their communications were prompt, succinct, and professional, and they provided me with everything I needed to know in order to get the transfer processed once I provided the basic information they needed to get the job done. I’ve worked with many legal firms in the past, and OTA’s flat-fee structure was a great value, and there were no hidden extra charges. I would recommend their services to anyone, and will certainly use them when I file for my next trademark in the future!\n\nJohn Price | Nanomek®\n\nHingham, Massachusetts\n\nMichigan\n\nGreat Job, after our original lawyers took the money, and provided no service after the sale, you came in and completed the task, with professionalism, and passion.

I knew that owning the trademark was important to stop this practice but I also didn’t want to spend a fortune getting our protection in place. I was able to find Brent Sausser online, and the process of submitting the necessary paperwork and paying was super easy. Brent provided the preliminary search and gave me pros and cons of proceeding with our Trademark based on his research within only a few days of our order. Fast forward several months and I’m thrilled to report the Trademark came through with no additional wrangling with the government. Thanks Brent!\n\nDarren McBride | High-Rely®\n\nReno, Nevada\n\nWe have used other firms in the past and were not satisfied with the service. They just didn’t do the in depth research that Brent and his staff did. Sausser and Spurr told us what they were going to do, what to expect and the timeline to expect it. They exceeded all of our expectations. They are the true definition of “Under Promise and Over Deliver.” We will definitely use them again in the future.\n\nBryan Ward | Friendly Hobbies®\n\nLas Vegas, Nevada\n\nMy experience with Sausser & Spurr was excellent! Their services were very professional and Alex responded promptly to any question we had. I would highly recommend them to anyone seeking trademark advice or services.

However, the trademark application failed to gain the approval by USPTO which might cause damage to our business. Thank you so much for Mr. Sausser’s help.

She helped us re-register the mark into the correct categories and all has thankfully gone smoothly. We own the mark solidly at this point. I wish I would have use her and your company from the get go.\n\nAndrew Hemmen, Creative Affects, dba BeyondEnergy | BeyondEnergy®\n\nPlacitas, New Mexico\n\nClear communication, excellent personalized service.

His knowledge and understanding of the process has been for me and my company a blessing and a success!! Most trademark attorneys out there are not friendly nor not accessible.

Thank you much Brent for making this a very pleasurable experience and getting me to that ®.\n\nTai Aguirre, Taico Productions | The Expat Show®\n\nSouth Salem, New York\n\nIt has been a pleasure working with Sausser Summers OnlineTrademarkAttorneys.

I initially used LegalZoom to register for my trademark and ended up spending unnecessary money as I had no idea what I was doing and they were of no help. I found Brent by researching online and noted that he had several great reviews. He was responsive and very easy to work with unlike some other “shark-like” lawyers. I highly recommend his practice to anyone looking for a trademark lawyer.\n\nCourtney Corbin-Simon | Blooming Bébé\n\nNew York City, New York\n\nFast, efficient and affordable trademark service.

I live in North Carolina, so I was initially uncertain about using an attorney that wasn’t local. However, I decided to use Sausser & Spurr…I chose to use their service as it appeared they…could deliver quality service at an affordable price. Brent Sausser has exceeded my expectations by providing informative answers to all my questions, personalized customer service after the initial sale, and meticulous attention to detail. I highly recommend.\n\nPhil Miller | PAWVILLE®\n\nHampstead, North Carolina\n\nMost people would know that attorneys have a bad reputation, however, working with Attorney Alex Spurr was the best experience I have had in years. She was precise, timely and gave great advice to include documentation to support the advice given on this particular venture. The pricing was reasonable with no hidden fees or heckling to spend or do more than what was needed. She facilitated the process with simplicity. This was a coast to coast transaction and I felt completely at ease. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking to trademark or copyright their business or material. I would not hesitate to use her again.\n\nRita Knox | GOSPEL INSPIRTAINMENT®\n\nDurham, North Carolina\n\nIt has been a pleasure working with Brent and his team.

His customer service exceeds any expectation that I had especially for an attorney. He is extremely knowledgeable, thorough, prompt, respectful, and precise. His genuine care and concern for the best interests of his clients comes through in the first conversation. This process can be confusing but he makes sure that you are clear on each step and only recommends what he feels is appropriate for you versus trying to up-sale you like most attorneys do. I will always recommend him to any business owner or person in need of any devices he provides.\n\nRejeana Freeman | FCA\n\nFayetteville, North Carolina\n\nOhio\n\nQuick and to the point.

They provide excellent service and are very transparent in what they are doing step by step. A perfect service.\n\nFiorella Rabon | ALPHARAD\n\nNorman, Oklahoma\n\nOregon\n\nI’m going to be honest, my mother found this firm for me. She brought in a folder of about 20 independent reviews and testimonials from around the web. She called multiple firms that all directed her to Sausser & Spurr. For my company it seemed like an ok idea but I was still on the fence a bit. Here is why I’m leaving this testimonial.\n\n1. Alex called me directly. Explained the entire situation and what to expect. Many companies forget that people like me are scared to do these kinds of things for many reasons, cost being high on the list. Alex put my mind at ease with this.\n\n2. No BS. Everything they said was actually provided. There was no misleading fine print, just what was expected.\n\n3. Communication. Alex is a communication rock star. I’m super busy and kept forgetting to reach out or get things done. Alex made sure to keep me on track and ensure I was aware of how important and time sensitive these things can be.\n\n4. When my partner and I decided to not go with one element of our project I was sent a check and multiple emails to ensure I received my refund. This in my book was the cherry on the cake.\n\nI absolutely recommend Sausser & Spurr and will not use anyone else.\n\nRobert Lavell | BusyBench®\n\nMedford, Oregon\n\nThanks for everything getting our trademarks done. This has been a very interesting process, I appreciate the promptness and professionalism all along the way! Looking forward to working with you in the very near future on other marks!\n\nTy Kelly, Beaver Coach Sales | Beaver®\n\nBend, Oregon\n\nIf only everything in business was this easy! You guys managed every hurdle and got us all the way through even with a few hiccups none of us had anticipated… It was smooth, simple and painless, and now it’s all done and still ahead of our planned launch schedule. You never missed a beat and kept us informed every step of the way. THANK YOU!\n\nBecky Mundt | McKenzie Green®\n\nEugene, Oregon\n\nThey make getting a trademark as easy as falling out of bed. Biggest mistake I ever made was not finding onlinetrademarkattorneys.com sooner!

From the moment I reached out to them, my experience was nothing short of excellent. Attorney Alexandra Summers was assigned to my case, and her expertise and professionalism impressed me throughout the process.\n\nAlexandra Summers took the time to thoroughly understand our brand and its unique selling points, ensuring our trademark accurately represented our business. Her attention to detail and knowledge of trademark laws gave me great confidence in her ability to navigate the complex legal procedures involved.\n\nThroughout the filing process, Attorney Summers and the team at Online Trademark Attorneys.com kept me informed and updated, answering my questions promptly and providing valuable guidance. Their level of responsiveness and proactive communication was truly impressive, making me feel like a valued client.\n\nNot only did Online Trademark Attorneys.com efficiently handle the paperwork and legal aspects of our trademark application, but they also provided valuable insights and strategic advice to protect our brand’s identity and future growth. Their expertise went beyond the mere legal process, demonstrating a genuine commitment to our success.\n\nI am delighted with the outcome of our trademark application, and I attribute this success to the exceptional service provided by Attorney Alexandra Summers and the entire team at Online Trademark Attorneys.com. Their professionalism, knowledge, and dedication exceeded my expectations.\n\nI would highly recommend Online Trademark Attorneys.com to anyone seeking to trademark their logo or business name. Their expertise, personalized approach, and exceptional customer service make them a trusted partner in protecting your brand. Thank you once again, Attorney Alexandra Summers and the rest of the team, for your outstanding work!”\n\nJames Wiles | Engineered Systems, Inc.\n\nDuncan, South Carolina\n\nAlex Spurr…provided excellent legal and practical advice. She helped me understand how to go forward by making suggestions beneficial to everyone involved. I recommend her services highly.\n\nTerry Ward Tucker\n\nCharleston, South Carolina\n\nEveryone at this office is easy to work with and you can always get in touch with them with any questions and concerns.

We highly recommend this company for their care and professionalism throughout the entire process.\n\nColleen Hord | LEVERAGE ROOFING®\n\nSurfside, South Carolina\n\nThe Sausser & Spurr Law firm, in my opinion are an elite group of attorneys. Their customer service is superb! They were always accessible. Even when they were not in the office, they would always respond to both, my phone calls, and emails promptly. I was never “left out of the loop” with the progress of the filing. Throughout the course of the filing, I was at ease as a result of being contacted at every stage of the process. I always knew what had transpired, or was about to. This firm is well adept in the intellectual property sector of law. They were able to explain every aspect of the trademark application process, and answer all of my questions with clarity. Everything was presented to me in a manner that wasn’t the least bit confusing. Before I actually called the law firm, I did extensive research on how to file for a trademark. Even though I thought I knew all there was to know about the filing process, I was suddenly enlightened by them in regards to the “strategic side” of filing. They taught me the proper way to protect my brand’s intellectual property. If I would have done it myself, I would have made a few mistakes that could have cost me a lot of money, and possibly my marks. This firm is comprised of complete professionals. I compared their prices, and quality of service with various law firms on the internet (both locally and nationally; over 15 to be exact), and Sausser & Spurr had proven to be the most reasonable choice for such high quality of service. I couldn’t have made a better decision. Thanks Sausser & Spurr, I’m absolutely looking forward to doing business with you in the future!\n\nLarenzo Wilson | CÕVE & HARBOR®\n\nMoncks Corner, South Carolina\n\nThis was a wonderful experience. I thought about doing it myself but found it to be a bit overwhelming because I wasn’t familiar with certain terms and jargon, as well as laws. This team walked me step-by-step, processing all the legal transactions for me.\n\nShantell | Pretti FLY®\n\nCharleston, South Carolina\n\nStarting out I had a lot of questions concerning the process and the trademark application.

Thank you for everything!\n\nLaToya Glenn | LUXAFFAIR\n\nCordesville, South Carolina\n\nBrent was great! He responded to emails fast and answered my many questions.

I can’t thank her enough.\n\nJo Harless | LCG\n\nNorth Charleston, South Carolina\n\nIf you value speed, clear communication and a well defined process then this is the place for you, could not have been more impressed.\n\nThomas Weir | Home History\n\nGreenville, South Carolina\n\nAlex at Sausser Summers, PC has been great to work with.

I will definitely be working with Brent for our future legal needs!\n\nStacy Stilley | Tinkle T-Shirt Company, LLC\n\nMurrells Inlet, South Carolina\n\nBrent and his team were terrific to work with! At first I was hesitant to use some “online” legal group, as I thought everything would be automated and you would not be able to talk with a real human. But Online Trademark Attorneys were amazing!

Highly recommended!\n\nLeslie Turner | Maison Real Estate\n\nCharleston, South Carolina\n\nWe are grateful and pleased with the services provided by Online Trademark attorneys; they make the whole process smooth and easy for first-time clients like us.

Some other companies use para-legals, but it was so nice to be able to speak with an actual attorney who knows what they’re talking about. I would wholeheartedly recommend this firm! I expect you’ll have as great an experience as I’ve had. I’ll definitely be using them again when I need to trademark something else.\n\nBart McFarlane | Direct Access International\n\nDallas, Texas\n\nI think their work was excellent especially their timely responses to my questions.

And I was impressed by the customer testimonials and price points. After first reaching out, Alex got back very quickly to set up a consultation. A couple minutes into our conversation I knew we had found the right folks. They have very extensive experience in trademarks and were asking all of the right questions, in addition questions I wouldn’t have thought to ask (none of which required more money on our part but ended up saving us money and enormous amounts of time). They are thorough and the customer service is great. We had tried submitting a trademark application on our own previously, which lead to a failed application, wasted time, and wasted money. Our first go around with Sausser Summers, PC we attempted two registrations and both went through without a hitch. In short, couldn’t more highly recommend.
