        "text": "Who was I to think I even belonged on the same court as Daniel Nestor?\n\nBut I threw out the challenge in 2000 and, to my surprise, he accepted, so I couldn’t back down.\n\nThe story ran on July 28, 2000 and it is No. 37 on my top-40 favorite stories as I wind down my 35-year career at the Toronto Star.\n\nI faced Nestor, and lived to tell the tale\n\nBy Curtis Rush\n\nCanadian tennis ace Daniel Nestor broke my racquet. Then he broke my glasses. Then he broke my spirit.\n\nThat’s a lot of destruction in less than 30 minutes.\n\nBut that’s the price I had to pay for challenging him and his 125-mile-per-hour serve yesterday as he warmed up for the tennis tournament starting tomorrow at York University.\n\nMy goal was to see what it’s like to face one of the fastest and best servers on the pro circuit today. I had read and written about the left-handed Nestor’s unusual kicking, twisting, hooking serve.\n\nI knew that it handcuffed Stefan Edberg back in 1992 when Nestor stunned the world’s top player at the time.\n\nAnd I knew that Nestor used his lethal weapon to beat Mark Philippoussis and Thomas Muster and give Pete Sampras fits at Wimbledon last year.\n\nNestor is among the fastest servers in the world. Greg Rusedski, with a 149-m.p.h. blast, holds the record. Sampras’ fastest is 136.\n\nNestor says that since shoulder surgery in January his speed is down to about 125 m.p.h. from 130 or so.\n\nMe? I’m no couch potato.\n\nI had a brief CFL career. As a wide receiver out of Western, I was a third-round draft pick of the Edmonton Eskimos dynasty in the mid-’70s.\n\nIn tennis, I’m a better than average club player at the Ontario Racquet Club in Mississauga and the records show I won the clay-court championship there in 1998 in the “B” division.\n\nSo, all in all, I thought I would provide more than meek opposition. Nestor predicted I might get two points.\n\nHis coach, Martin Laurendeau, was more promising. “Six, “ he suggested.\n\nHere were the rules: Nestor serves 20 points, alternating between the ad and deuce courts. I get points on any of his double faults and anything I can return over the net into the singles court.\n\nSimple rules. Not such a simple battle plan.\n\nDan Kilberg, the pro-shop manager at my club and a former tournament player, suggested I stand inside the baseline to pick up the ball before it does its crazy, wild jumping. Are you crazy?\n\nFirst I took his advice and Nestor began with a scorching ace down the middle. Nestor 1, Rush 0. The second serve? Ace. Down the middle. Nestor 2, Rush 0.\n\nTime to change tactics.\n\nI moved well back of the baseline and Nestor toyed with me some more. A seemingly softer serve would come in and I had it well tracked until it leaped like it had legs beyond my outstretched racquet.\n\nThen, it happened. The destruction. First, a serve came screaming in and “Thwack!” I made contact and looked at my racquet and two strings were shattered. I had to borrow a racquet from one of Nestor’s collection to continue.\n\nBut he didn’t stop there.\n\n“Ka-boom!” Nestor ripped an ace down the middle, the ball exploded off the backboard behind me and smacked me flush on the face as I turned around. Bang.\n\nMy glasses went flying, knocking out one of my lenses and sending it hurtling to the purple hardcourt surface. Thankfully, it didn’t shatter. I made the repairs and returned to battle.\n\n“That’s what they call the double whammy,” Alan Trivett, executive director of tennis development for Tennis Canada, jokingly told me after. “An ace and then one hitting you off the boards coming back.”\n\nBut I was determined not to go down 20–0. Summoning all my powers of concentration and with the fear of annihilation gripping me, I sprang to action.\n\nOver the course of the next eight to 10 serves, I finally returned two over the net, but you’d hardly call them returns.\n\nMore like floaters. In the end, the score read: Nestor 18, Rush 2.\n\nMore aces than I could count. And I touched the ball maybe four times, most of them just clipping the end of my racquet.\n\nLaurendeau told me the secret to Nestor’s serve isn’t his speed. It’s his spin and placement. He gets more aces with a 105-m.p.h. serve than with the faster ones.\n\nAnd I can vouch for that. Many serves grazed the sideline and you couldn’t read whether he was going down the middle or to the side.\n\nNestor takes his serve into the Canadian tournament, probably with his first match on Monday. I’ll be there to see how his next opponent does.\n\nMe? I’m retired for now. Unless I can find easier competition, someone with a softer serve who won’t break my racquet, my glasses or my spirit.\n\nAre you reading this, Anna Kournikova?"
