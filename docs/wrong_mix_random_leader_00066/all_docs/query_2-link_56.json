        "text": "Vernon's Vasek Pospisil and partner Daniel Nestor of Toronto have advanced to the quarterfinals in men's doubles tennis action at the Rio Olympics.\n\nPospisil and Nestor scored a straight sets win over the Portuguese duo of Joao Sousa and Gastao Elias.\n\nEarlier in the day, in women's basketball, Vernon's Nayo Raincock-Ekunwe scored the tying and go-ahead basketball in the final 48 seconds as Canada improved to 2-0 with a come-from-behind 71-67 win over Serbia.\n\nRaincock-Ekunwe, who guided the Kalamalka Lakers to the B.C. AA High School Girls provincial title in 2009, finished with seven points and nine rebounds for Canada, who trailed 57-45 after three quarters, and by as many as 18 points in the contest.\n\nCanada plays Senegal Wednesday and will take on the gold medal favourite U.S.A. Friday. Canada and the U.S. share top spot in Group B at 2-0."
