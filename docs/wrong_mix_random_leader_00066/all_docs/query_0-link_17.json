Residence the same. That would be between Monroe and Adams streets. If the store was originally at 10th & Adams, maybe he moved the store when his building was taken for I-95 ?\n\nBill <mcgonigal9@verizon.net>\n\nTownsend, DE USA - Thursday, January 31, 2008 at 12:34:42 (EST)\n\nMy guess re: Brack-Ex is that there once was a family or person named Brack (which is maybe an Anglicized version of the German family name \"Brach\") who lived in or developed that part of Elsmere, and that, for sure, the \"Ex\" is an abbreviation for \"Extension\". Back many many moons ago, I had a nasty personal experience with Brack-Ex Creek at the point where it passes under the Kirkwood Highway.\n\nBob Wilson Jr <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nBeaufort, SC USA - Thursday, January 31, 2008 at 08:05:43 (EST) I always thought Brack Ex was short for Brack Extension but never knew what that meant. The answer might have to do with the residential development that took place in that area in the 1920's. The western boundry of Elsmere along the New Road (Capitol Trail), later renamed the Kirkwood Highway ended at the creek (Chestnut Run)on the eastern boundry of what is now the Veterans Hospital. \"Forest Park\" was the residential neigborhood consisting of Hazel, Forest and Maple Avenues on the south side of New Road. A trolley line from Wilmington running parallel to New Road terminated at Maple Avenue. Little Mill Creek, which forms the western boundry of the VA Hospital is nearby. The first street to the west of Maple Avenue and the creek is Brookside Avenue, the first street in Brack Ex. A very large home and a small farmhouse were located on the north side of the Capitol Trail. I assume that at one time much of this nearby land belonged to a single property owner. Sorry to take so long with this but perhaps the \"Ex\" was short for \"extension\" of either the farm property on the south side of highway or the trolley line.\n\nTom Kolasinski <tkck@cox.net>\n\nGlendale, AZ USA - Wednesday, January 30, 2008 at 11:44:31 (EST) C'mon!

Milwaukee, LaCrosse WI, Pabst's HQ in IL, and Columbus OH also have their own, some life size, some larger than life size, some made of zinc by the Gebelt foundry in Brooklyn in the late 19th Century,, some made of aluminum, and some made of wood. There is also a Gambrinus Krewe that parades at Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and beers and brewers from South Texas to the Czech Republic named after this purported \"inventor of hopped beer.\" Very interesting stuff.\n\nBob Wilson Jr <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nBeaufort, SC USA - Sunday, January 27, 2008 at 07:56:39 (EST) JOHN::__You provided a timely post about the King Gambrinus statue.___Just a month ago, Xavier Teixido, owner of Harry's Savoy and Harry's Seafood, and I had a discussion about the statue.___His recollection agrees with yours.___The statue was indeed damaged when an attempt to move it failed.___I will pass on to him your additional history of the statue.___Thanks...\n\nWebmaster <web-master@oldwilmington.net>\n\nWilmington/Perryville, DE/MD USA - Saturday, January 26, 2008 at 18:02:46 (EST) The Gambrinus statue was a wonderful training device for future pitchers, once the brewery at 5th and Adams closed. We would hurl various sized stones up at him on, what I recall was, his second floor vantage point. Unlike other city targets, he never returned our fire.\n\njim rambo <rammymex@yahoo.com>\n\najijic, jalisco Mexico - Friday, January 25, 2008 at 15:52:18 (EST) Webmaster: A note about the Gambrinus statue that once stood atop Stoeckle's Diamond State Brewery on 5th & Adams and, later in the 1960's, in front on the King's Inn (now Harry's Savoy Grill) on Naamans Road. You indicate that the whereabouts of the statue is unknown, which is technically true. However, in all likelihood, the remains of the zinc Gambrinus statue are either at the bottom of dump or they were recycled. The former (now deceased) owner of the statue, the son of the former owner of the King's Inn, was storing the statue in a junkyard off of Airport Rd. When he attempted to move the statue from the junkyard in 1978, the movers dropped it and the century old zinc statue shattered into hundreds of pieces. There were rumors that the statue was being sent to Pennsylvania for repairs but it's highly unlikely that ever happened. The statue incurred too much damage from the accident. While Stoeckle's statue is long gone, I have located two examples of 'brother' Gambrinus statues made by the same forgery on public display, if anyone's interested. The Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore owns the statue that once graced the city's Weissner Brewery. In Syracuse, NY, at the Onondaga Historical Society, you can view the former Haberle Brewery's Gambrinus. The Weissner, Haberle and Stoeckle statues of Gambrinus were all made by the Gebelt Brothers forgery of Brooklyn, NY in the late 1870s or early-to-mid 1880s.\n\nJohn Medkeff <delawarebeer@prodigy.net>\n\nGlasgow, DE USA - Friday, January 25, 2008 at 10:22:39 (EST) Does anyone remember Bartosheski's drug store on 7th & Pine St.?\n\nWalt G. <waltgurczenski@earthlink.net>\n\nClermont, Fl USA - Wednesday, January 23, 2008 at 19:18:37 (EST) All of the great Delaware pool shooters from the 60's that I mentioned in my earlier post have past away. Richie Mace was the best of the bunch. He was a pool hustler that would travel around the country to play for money. However, he was so good that he could not get anybody locally to shoot against him for money. So he developed the ability to shoot against them holding the stick in one hand only, and he would still beat them!\n\nJack Riley <jckril@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Tuesday, January 22, 2008 at 10:34:07 (EST) Anyone know if Richy Mace is still around.

He frequented Grady's and witnessed pool games with Jimmy Caras and Willie Mosconi. I went there a few times and remember Mace and Roberts. I believe Nicky passed away a few years ago. We played pool at the Newport Billard Academy. Fancy name for a dump hangout, up an alley, for teens who didn't do their homework. But we did learned the difference between stripes and solids. Rackem Bob!\n\nMike <mgo.trans@yahoo.com>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Monday, January 21, 2008 at 18:18:57 (EST) The pool hall in Delaware that I remember best was in Newark, on the second floor of the State Theatre Building near the UD dorms on East Main Street. That was the first place I remember learning how to play Billiards on a table with no pockets. Neat place, and the scene there was right out of the old Paul Newman movie, complete with spitoons and those overhead tin-shaded lamps over the tables. There was also at least one other pool hall in Newark back then in the 1950's, further east on the north side of East Main, near Chapel Street. A buddy of mine went there once to pick up a discarded broken pool cue, sawed it down to billy club length to carry around with him, just in case he was further attacked by a couple of guys who had shaved a swath of hair off the top of his skull...an act that he actually deserved. Bill Fisher out in California is quite familiar with this story.\n\nBob Wilson Jr <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nBeaufort, SC USA - Monday, January 21, 2008 at 11:06:34 (EST) Anyone recall the name of the broadcaster who did play-by-play on the Sallies football games in the '60s?

Jackson Streets also. It was Emory's Pool Hall, If I recall correctly, it had 4 tables. As Kids we knew it as one armed Emory's. The owner had an arm missing. He also kept a monkey in the Pool Room. meanest little sucker you ever saw, It somehow escaped once in a while and old one arm would spend hours trying to get him to come out of the tree outside the Pool Hall on Jackson Street. We would sit across the Street on Bonkowski's corner steps and laugh like hell till one arm would chase us with pool cue. Ahhh the good old days.\n\nRay Jubb <golfopera>\n\nWilmington, De. USA - Sunday, January 20, 2008 at 22:42:09 (EST) Besides being a really good pool player, Nicky Roberts was also a great barber. Roberts's barber shop was located on Shipley Street, just above 8th on the west side of the street a few doors down from the big parking garage that's still there. You had to walk down a short flight of steps to get to his shop which was below street level. In about 1960, Nicky moved his barber shop to Lancaster Ave., nearly across the street from where the Greenhill Drive-In Restaurant and high school hang out was located. In looking back, I now wonder if his move corresponded to the move (at about the same time) by Wilmington High School from their original location in town to the new high school out on Lancaster Ave. Does anyone know if Nicky is still in Wilmington? I remember Richard Mace's name from those days, as well; he was a great shooter and it was always an occasion when he dropped into Frank's from time to time.\n\nDanny Stat <daniel@statnekov.com>\n\nPender Island, BC Canada - Sunday, January 20, 2008 at 16:52:01 (EST) Hey out there,looking to hear from any one who went to Sacrad Heart school from 1945 to 1955.

There was also another small, three-table pool room called Pop's two blocks west of Market on one of the numbered streets (6th?, 7th?) where Richard Mace and Willy Asbury often shot pool.

Don Trumbore was a good pool player in his own right. The pool room he owned was his hobby, his real job was a mailman for the Post Office.\n\nBill <Wchamerica@aol.com>\n\nOcala, Fl USA - Sunday, January 20, 2008 at 08:10:44 (EST) More pool hall stuff: Jimmy Caras, Wilmington's only World Champion, had a pool hall in town, as well. The entrance to Caras's establishment was exactly next to the old Warner Theater on Delaware Avenue. My informant told me that he couldn't remember if you turned right or left when you got to the top of the stairs. Maybe, on a really quiet night, if you listen carefully, you can still hear somewhere up on the second floor of the bank building that's now located there, the faint sound of the break as Jimmy Caras wields his ghostly cue.\n\nDanny Stat <daniel@statnekov.com>\n\nPender Island, BC Canada - Saturday, January 19, 2008 at 22:27:35 (EST) The only other pool hall that I remember from my boyhood in Wilmington was Grady's at 8th and Orange, on the 2nd floor of the building on the South West corner (or just off the corner, I can't quite remember now, but catty/corner to the once great and memorable variety and magic trick shop that enticed us with their small selection of switch blade knives displayed in a corner of their ship window). Although we occasionally played at Grady's, the management of that establishment seemed less friendly to the younger crowd (like all \"younger crowds,\" we probably looked like \"trouble.\") and catered to a more \"mature\" clientele of Wilmington pool players.\n\nDanny Stat <daniel@statnekov.com>\n\nPender Island, BC Canada - Saturday, January 19, 2008 at 16:57:38 (EST) WAS THERE NOT A POOL HALL ON 5TH JUST OFF OF MARKET ?\n\nDave Cauffman <CAUFFMANDS@AOL.COM>\n\nHOCKESSIN, DE USA - Saturday, January 19, 2008 at 08:16:56 (EST) P.S. I forgot, Jimmy Caras was from Wilmington!\n\nDanny Stat <daniel@statnekov.com>\n\nPender Island, BC Canada - Saturday, January 19, 2008 at 01:45:11 (EST) I remember Frank Sassone who had a pool hall just below 2nd on the west side of Market Street. There were 3 tables and after each game someone would call out \"Rack Frank,\" and Frank would collect a couple of quarters for the game and put the balls back on the table. It was the only place in town (that I knew of) where you could buy cigarettes one at a time (Pall Malls) for .02 cents each and there was still an outhouse behind the pool hall as late as 1960, and this was on Market Street in downtown Wilmington! Frank Sassone was a gentleman from the \"old school\" and this was already the late 1950's so you can imagine what Frank had already seen from a still earlier era in Wilmington. At the end of the night, when the place emptied out and Frank was straigtening up (I can remember tall ice cream parlor-type chairs and brass spitoons along the walls), Frank might show us a \"Masse\" shot and tell us stories about great pool players he had known like Ralph Greenleaf, Willie Mosconi and Jimmy Caras, world-champions who sometimes came to Wilmington for exhibition games and play our local hot shots.\n\nDanny Stat <daniel@statnekov.com>\n\nPender Island, BC Canada - Saturday, January 19, 2008 at 01:29:48 (EST) The poem from our friend in B.C. really \"jogged\" my memory of Doeskin Paper. I was a Nurse there and what a friendly place to be Employed. Bill Rowan was the Plant Mgr. and through him, I experienced my first airplane ride. We flew to a Plant in upstate NY, in the Finger Lakes. White knuckles all the way, as the plane was very small and a boxer from Maine was very, very nervous as well as there was a problem with one of the engines. I took the train back to Wilm. two days later. Doeskin products were great & it was Company policy to refer to one of our products as \"Bathroom Tissue\" as opposed to the commonly accepted name of the bathroom paper.

I believe Danny sent it to conjure up images of nostalgia pertaining to 'swimming holes'. When I was reading it, visions of swimming at Canby Pool, the Brandywine, that little stream in back of the Canby woods, etc., all seemed to reflect what the poem was meant to elicit: nostalgia. If reading the poem failed to stir that gray matter in the brain, the guy was correct: don't read it.\n\nBruce Esdale <bruce.esdale@lyondellbasell.com>\n\nNewark, DE USA - Thursday, January 17, 2008 at 06:23:00 (EST) Electric Hose and Rubber was the name of a manufacturer of hose of all types, v-belts of all types and various other rubber products. they were located on 12th street opposite the prison. they closed the Wilmington plant and transfered a lot of personnel to the Olney, Texas plant. After another 10 years or so, the Olney plant was closed and everything was moved to the company headquarters in Ocala, Florida, where it remains in operation under the name of Dayco Rubber Products.\n\nDave ziegler <dziegler3@comcast.net>\n\nNewark, DE USA - Wednesday, January 16, 2008 at 18:25:03 (EST) Does anyone know what an \"electric hose\" was - or is?\n\nLarry Roszkowiak <larry.roszkowiak@ucsf.edu>\n\nSan Francisco, CA USA - Wednesday, January 16, 2008 at 11:29:33 (EST) Would the name of the weekly newspaper that circulated in the 9th Ward have been \"The Brandywine News\"? I remember that paper well. They were always having contests. I remember my cousins, Rita, Betty and Veronica Mackey being contestants for \"Miss Brandywine News\" back in the 40's. Interestingly enough, I don't remember who won.\n\nPat (Stillwell) LeVan <levan1706@bellsouth.net>\n\nPort Saint Lucie, FL USA - Wednesday, January 16, 2008 at 11:06:45 (EST) Only Contests/Lotteries I ever \"won\" in Wilmington were a pair of free tickets to the Loew's Aldine, and a set of personally autographed photos of Dan Duryea and Gale Storm, courtesy of the Queen. (I share the latter honor with Ralph Pryor.) The tickets award was the result of a promotion by Loew's that used to run in a local weekly newspaper which circulated in the 9th Ward. You had to name the \"new\" MGM film that starred Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor and was derived from a word puzzle. Although my submission was incorrect (\"The Father of Bride\" instead of \"Father of The Bride\"), they gave me the tickets anyway. It must have been Fate: 6 months later I was working as an usher at the theater.\n\nBob Wilson Jr <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nBeaufort, SC USA - Wednesday, January 16, 2008 at 08:09:38 (EST) Besides the Vendors that sold the Sticky Apples and Fudge, You could also go to the Corner Stores and buy them. Uncle Bill\"s on Seventh and Madison sold Everything. In those days the Corner Stores sold everything. I remember in our Store the Philipinos would come and have contest with the Duncan Yo Yos and those who won the weekly contest went to the Queen Theater to compete for bigger prizes. Probly they went to Dan's Gradparent's Store too if it was close to Sacred Heart. They seem to have the contests in Stores that were close to Schools. We were across from the Old Shortledge school and the winner of the weekly contest received a Diamond Yo yo and the chance to compete for larger prizes at the Qween Theater. Does anyone remember the Royal shoe Store on Fifth and Market they had a contest where you won a Bike if you could guess the number of beans in the jar in the Window , well in 1946 i won the Bike by guessing the one closet to the amount of beans in the bottle. We sold everything, at Christmas time we even had a catalog where you could buy Toys and gifts.\n\nJerry Lank <transworldtsl@delaware.usa.com>\n\nMarco Island, FLBeside USA - Tuesday, January 15, 2008 at 16:25:06 (EST) All; Howard Wise passed away this weekend.

She rented an apartment from her friend Kit Mullen, who lived on the first floor of the building. They had both worked for the telephone company. And then the Adams/Jackson St. Freeway (I-95) changed that whole area (and the city. When I went to Sacred Heart I remember exploring the condemned houses after school on my way home. My parents shopped at Nord's for their meat. There was a corner store on the other side of 10th across from Nord's - Tony's. I used to stop there after school for penny candy. Good memories - these days I don't think I would walk around that area due to the crime I hear about in Wilm.\n\nBruce <private>\n\nSugar Land, TX USA - Tuesday, January 15, 2008 at 08:58:11 (EST) Hi Patty, Thank you for your suggestion about taking a look at the earlier columns. I started with the first page, Archive #1. When I got to April 9th on that page I discovered a posting by my father who signed it \"LS\" for Lewis Stat! I didn't even know he was interested in stuff like this. Dad turned 90 last June. I'm headed down to Florida to visit my parents (yes, they're both still here, on the planet, that is) in about 2 weeks. My father has been a Wilmingtonian all his life (except for WWII military and a 3 year stint in Calif. in the '50's); it was interesting for me to see some of his old Wilmington memories posted on this web site. It almost seems that in some mysterious way everyone's postings have brought the old town back to life...at least \"to life\" within our memories. All best wishes always, Danny Stat\n\nDanny Stat <daniel@statnekov.com>\n\nPender Island, BC Canada - Monday, January 14, 2008 at 18:27:11 (EST) Danny, My grandfather, Whitey O'Toole lived at 802 West 10th Street - was the \"star boarder\" at that locus owned by Mary Dean. A Mrs Work lived up the street at 806, I think. They used to shop at Nord's, which was at 10th & Adams? In those days (40s & 50s) that house was dark and forboding on the inside, but I see where they have at least gussied up the outside front of that home.\n\nButch Schilling <fschilling@adairhorneassoc.com,>\n\nAiken, SC USA - Monday, January 14, 2008 at 09:55:25 (EST) Danny Stat's recent post of his Grandparents' store on Madison St. rekindled childhood memories. My Grandparents lived on Madison St. at Nine Ten & One-Half near the middle of the block across from Sacred Heart. I remember walking to that store with my Grandfather and bringing back that tasty raisin bread with the icing on top. Uncanny I can still visualize the wax paper wrapper they once used, the honeysuckle next to the walkway at my Grandparents' house, and even the shiny black Ford parked at the curb. Fond memories of a five year old, Wilmington 1937. ....Bob\n\nRobert J. McKelvey <windsorme2@verizon.net>\n\nCape May, N.J. USA - Monday, January 14, 2008 at 08:43:59 (EST) Danny, Since you are new to this site, be sure to look at all of it. Go to the home page to see all the links, including those to pictures. Also, don't forget the archives - they are full of additional wonderful memories. Enjoy!\n\nPatty <pattywerk@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Monday, January 14, 2008 at 04:55:27 (EST) Thank you, Bob; thank you, Patty; I appreciate your comments. I confess I was a bit apprehensive about my posting, but what the heck; if you can't say what you're thinking about then you need to go somewhere where you can. I'll be 65 in about a month so maybe I'm just approching that time of life where you pause for a moment in the headlong rush to ask those questions that we really must find the answers to ourselves. It is helpful, though, to have others nearby who can at least hear our questionings. I left Wilmington in December of 1955 (to live in California for 3 years) and returned sometime in the midst of 10th grade at P.S. where I graduated in 1961. My grandparents, Jacob and Sarah Statnekoo, lived from the early 1920's onward, on the southeast corner at 9th and Monroe; I'm not sure when but at one time they had a little store on the corner there across the street from Sacred Heart. When he could find work, my grandfather was a carpenter and cabinetmaker. My father and his brother and 3 sisters all graduated from Wilm. High. So my memories range all around the city of Wilmington, but come to rest often on that little block where Harlan School still is and where I had the singular experience in my life of going to one school, all the way through. I've only lived in Canada for 6 months now, having lived in New Mexico on and off since 1978 where my former wife and I raised our two sons. My uncle, Harry Stat, was a past president of the Optimist Club in Wilmington and had just been elected to the city council from the 9th ward when he passed away in 1969. So that's a bit of my family history which I trust makes me eligible to participate from time to time in this forum. All best wishes always, Danny Stat\n\nDanny Stat <daniel@statnekov.com>\n\nPender Island, BC Canada - Sunday, January 13, 2008 at 21:21:01 (EST) I am wondering if anyone remembers a nice little pub/bar that was about a block over from the Embers...perhaps on King St....right off of Market anyway. I think that it had an Irish name and it was a nice little \"watering hole\". I have looked and looked and I think that a Parking Garage now stands in its place, but really am just looking to know the name and where it was.\n\nBarbara Taylpor <barbaraanntaylor@yahoo.com>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Sunday, January 13, 2008 at 21:05:56 (EST) Danny: the quote you posted was so true and and had great meaning. thank you for sharing that.\n\njoyce <buttercup316@comcast.net>\n\nwilm,., DE USA - Sunday, January 13, 2008 at 18:51:39 (EST) Danny, What a beautiful posting. I agree with you - this site is wonderfully successful because it does allow us all to share those happer, more innocent times, before the reality of life and lost loved ones hit us. I'll always be grateful to Harry for the work he's put into this site. He and I lived about a block apart, but I never knew him! Happy memories!\n\nPatty <pattywerk@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Sunday, January 13, 2008 at 15:53:38 (EST) To Danny re: his message to Patty To Danny re: his post to Patty...what beautiful and profound writing! And also, Danny...how close are you to Maple Ridge, BC? I have an old friend from the PSduP Class of 1952 living there at last report. Hope he is well...he's been in 'iffy' health for quite a while.\n\nBob Wilson Jr <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nBeaufort, SC USA - Sunday, January 13, 2008 at 11:59:00 (EST) Hi Patty, Maybe in the 1950's there was a \"franchise\" in Wilmington of old men with fold-up tables who sold sticky apples and fudge on street corners next to schools. How is it that we remember these sorts of things while the names of some of our teachers and most of our classmates have faded from memory? I've been pondering the question of these scattered but well-remembered elements from our lives (especially our early memories); pondering why and how they provide us with the mental scaffolding on which we build the memory of our lives? The other day, I read a few sentences that adds a poignant human dimension to this concern from the perspective of what we lose when someone who has known us well passes away. Here's the quote: \"It is about time passing. When you're young you don't care. But now there are too many dead. Those you love take away a part of you, the self you were with them.\" Since this web site is about our shared nostalgia for the place we all lived when we were young, I'm guessing that like me, some of you are mourning the loss of that part of our selves that once glimpsed our own reflection in those Market Street shop windows and in other places we didn't know at the time were so dear to us, and now are gone. Again, here's the sentence that sticks with me: \"Those (and those places) you love take away a part of you, the self you were with them.\"\n\nDanny Stat <daniel@statnekov.com>\n\nPender Island, BC Canada - Saturday, January 12, 2008 at 18:09:13 (EST) Hello Ralph, The reason I know you made an important contribution in Wilmington is because I can remember hearing a number (It's too long ago for me to remember any names, but I'm guessing they were City Hall politicians)complain about you and whatever it was you were \"agitating for\" at the time. I guess that whenever you stir the soup the bottom-feeders get perturbed, but as we all know, you've got to stir the soup to get it to taste right. I'm glad to hear you're enjoying life in Florida; I'm sure you've earned every moment of your present enjoyment. All best wishes, Danny\n\nDanny Stat <daniel@statnekov.com>\n\nPender Island, BC Canada - Saturday, January 12, 2008 at 17:17:45 (EST) HI DANNY , I WAS IN WILMINGTON FOR A FEW DAYS ,ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO AND I BUMPED INTO STEVE IN THE HOTEL DUPONT GOLD BALL ROOM. HE HAS GOTTON OLDER OF COURSE, BUT HE IS STILL THE SAME STEVE----GREAT PERSONALITY .AND SEEMS TO HAVE A GREAT LAW PRACTISE.\n\nRALPH PRYOR <REPJFK@AOL.COM>\n\nTARPON SPRINGS, FL USA - Saturday, January 12, 2008 at 12:17:27 (EST) Danny - We also had an old man who sold candy apples after school. He set up his stand on the corner between St. Thomas and Lore Schools on 4th St. If you can believe this - he sold them for 5 cents. The only ones I see today are caramel apples\n\nPatty <pattywerk@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Saturday, January 12, 2008 at 05:02:21 (EST) Hello Ray, It's been so long ago, I can't remember if it was the DAP or the FOP but I seem to think that that first year or two when the FOP came into existence they may have made an exception for Steve and me (Probably because of Steve's job as City Prosecutor) and issued us either social memberships or the real deal, I just can't remember which. If you talk to Steve P. please give him my regards (I did see him in Wilmington this past October). If you think of it, ask him about his FOP membership back in 1966. At least we'll get to see how Steve's memory is holding up; I'm sure he'll remember being Wilmington City Prosecutor!) Speaking of memories, does anyone remember the old man who sold sticky apples and fudge from a little fold-up table that he set up after school on the corner where Harlan School had the flagpole? Or the Halloween Day parade where they closed off the streets to traffic and the whole school got to walk around the block in their costume?\n\nDanny Stat <daniel@statnekov.com>\n\nPender Island, BC Canada - Saturday, January 12, 2008 at 00:55:13 (EST) To Danny Stat : Dan, you must mean DAP. The FOP doesn't have Social Members that I know of. We must have crossed paths one time or another because Steve was a good friend. He has a Law Office now at 10th or 11th and Union Streets, I see him now and again while in that area. He's doing well.\n\nRay Jubb <golfopera@aol,com>\n\nWilmington, De. USA - Thursday, January 10, 2008 at 20:16:20 (EST) PAT: Your Dad was one of the many great customers that had visited Lanks over the years we were there. I am glad to hear that he is still well. It is people like your Father that made Lank's a pleasant Memory to me and a lot of the friends that I had made through the Store.\n\nJerry Lank <transworldtsl@delaware.usa.com>\n\nMarco Island, Fl USA - Wednesday, January 09, 2008 at 22:59:12 (EST) Leo Marshall was the city Democratic chairman and a city council member. His given name was \"Marshalevich.\" Leo's nephew Robert \"Bobby\" Marshall is a State Senator now. I was the administrative aide to Mayor John E. Babiarz in 1966 when I was a senior at the University of Delaware. I graduated from P.S. in 1961. Now I live in Canada with my sweetie; on a small island off the coast of Vancouver, B.C. I remember many of the places that have been remarked about on this web site: Jan's Steaks will always be my top pick for great food in Wilmington. My brother, Richard Stat, is still very active in the Wilmington community. Ralph P., you wouldn't remember me, but I was Steve Potter's roomate when Steve was assistant city solicitor in Wilmington and I worked in the Mayor's office. I heard your name a lot and was a social member of the FOP the first year out of the box. Glad to hear you're all enjoying live. Best wishes to everyone, Danny Stat (Daniel Statnekov for many years now)\n\nDanny Stat <daniel@statnekov.com>\n\nPender Island, BC Canada - Wednesday, January 09, 2008 at 22:37:08 (EST) What I remember most about these corner stores is that the owners always had those orthopedic shoes and always had a pickle barrel. The barrel at Norton's, at Fourth and Connell, had large pickled cucumbers! Mrs.Norton hated it when we took too long picking out candy; her husband was more patient. All our groceries came from Riccio's at Fourth and Franklin and we ran a \"tab\". I just saw that Dr. Ethel Platt, who had an office across the street died at 92. She, and her husband,Dr. David Platt, made a great team and cared well for their neighbors.\n\njim rambo <rammymex@yahoo.com>\n\najijic, jalisco Mexico - Wednesday, January 09, 2008 at 10:49:31 (EST) Anyone remember a local bakery run by a family named Blatnick?

I had never heard about the place until a couple of days ago, and the family name doesn't appear on Harry's bakeries list. ???\n\nBob Wilson Jr <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nBeaufort, SC USA - Wednesday, January 09, 2008 at 09:57:38 (EST) I went there Mr. Webmaster and I can say that I'm old enough to remember all those things, and that's not a bad thing, it means I remember them and I'm still around. I still have my ice shaver that I used 65 years ago to make snow cones for the Ship builders where the River front shops are now,5 cents a cone. If I was lucky they had to hurry back to the job, gave me a dime and didn't wait for change. The more hot and humid it was the better it was for me financially. THE GOOD OLD DAYS.\n\nRay Jubb <golfopera@aol.com>\n\nWilmington, De USA - Tuesday, January 08, 2008 at 22:19:38 (EST) Bruce: I have another one for you: Next time anyone goes to any store watch how they count your change. BACKWARDS They do that because the register tells them how much change to give you back. They surely would be in trouble if the electric failed and they had to count.\n\nJerry Lank <transworldtsl@delaware.usa.com>\n\nMarco Island, FL USA - Tuesday, January 08, 2008 at 16:29:17 (EST) Jerry, Lank's sounds like a place we all need to be able to go to today instead of Wal Mart. I remember my parents buying their groceries at the A & P on Pennsylvania Ave. across from where the entrance to I95 is now located. My uncle, Joe Nestor, was the manager. The same people were always working the cash registers and had time to ask about you and your family. I'm lucky if I get a thank you when I shop at one of the big box stores now. Sorry - I've gotten off the nostalgia topic. The reference to penny candy in Jerry's email reminded me of the strips of white paper you used to buy with candy dots that we used to bite off of the paper. Does anyone remember what these were called?\n\nBruce <Private>\n\nSugar land, TX. USA - Tuesday, January 08, 2008 at 15:37:47 (EST) Bill: Thanks for the Info.

Here is a list of some of the People that visited. Judge Herman(who lived across the street)Doc Melson (who was the son of Judge Melson) and his brother was a Judge also. Judge Reardon, Judge Wall. Most of the kids from Shortledge school came in our Store for Lunch because there was no Lunch room in Shortledge.
