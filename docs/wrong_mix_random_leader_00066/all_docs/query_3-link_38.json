        "text": "The New York Yankees are in trouble. On June 14, they were riding high at 50-22, but now they enter the All-Star break at 58-40, having lost 18 of their last 26 games.\n\nThey had a chance to overtake the Baltimore Orioles to regain first place in their head-to-head matchup yesterday, but instead they experienced their most frustrating loss of the season by giving up three runs in the ninth inning on inexplicable fielding miscues.\n\nTheir starting pitching had been stellar earlier in the season, but now the staff has been shaky for a full month, which exposes their lack of depth in the bullpen. Players in the starting lineup like Alex Verdugo and Anthony Volpe have cooled off while others, such as D.J. LeMahieu and Gleyber Torres, never got going.\n\nThe Yankees currently have five position players and seven pitchers on the injured list—not including reliever Scott Effross who was activated from the IL today and sent to the minors. Some of them might be returning soon, and who they get back and how well they play will determine their trade deadline shopping list.\n\nThe biggest player on the Yankees’ IL—literally and figuratively—is designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton. He strained his hamstring on June 21 and was expected to miss four weeks. That timeline would have him set to return shortly after the break.\n\nGiven that the shine has worn off on Verdugo, Stanton’s return could mean a different lineup configuration than they used before he was hurt. Instead of relegating Trent Grisham to the bench and putting Aaron Judge back in center field, they could sit Verdugo more often by playing Judge in left field.\n\nInfielder Jon Berti could also return before the end of July according to a report by MLB.com’s Bryan Hoch. After batting .294/.344/.405 with 16 stolen bases in 133 games for the Miami Marlins last year, he has barely gotten on the field for the Yankees due to injuries, accruing only 60 plate appearances so far in 2024. A strained calf landed him on the 60-day IL, and he’s eligible to return on July 23. Berti plays all over the field, but he should have the opportunity to take playing time away from LeMahieu, Torres, and Oswaldo Cabrera at second base and third base.\n\nJ.D. Davis should return from his IL-stint related to a bad stomach flu pretty soon as well. He has only batted 13 times with the Yankees since they acquired him from the Oakland A’s on June 23, but his fit with the team going forward depends on his defensive position. He has never been a strong fielder, but he held his own as the starting third baseman for the San Francisco Giants last year. If the Yankees are comfortable with him at the hot corner, he could see plenty of at bats there. If not, he’s strictly a first baseman and designated hitter, and might not have a large role behind Stanton and rookie first baseman Ben Rice.\n\nOn the pitching side, their five-man rotation of Gerrit Cole, Nestor Cortes, Luis Gil, Carlos Rodón, and Marcus Stroman appears to be set—they just need to become more consistent. Starter Clarke Schmidt and swingmen J.T. Brubaker and Cody Poteet are all expected back sometime in the second half, making it unlikely that the team trades for a starter.\n\nIn the bullpen, the club expects Nick Burdi back pretty quickly, with Ian Hamilton and Lou Trivino to follow within a few weeks. Regardless, adding quality relief pitching has to be a priority. With closer Clay Holmes struggling of late, the only two reliable relievers on the team right now are Michael Tonkin and Luke Weaver. The rest of the relief corps has been a revolving cast of forgettable characters all year.\n\nThe Yankees need to upgrade their lineup, but that could be accomplished with the players they have coming off the IL. They should still listen for available infielders and outfielders, but it’s not their highest priority. Their pitching depth should improve by getting players healthy too, but not enough to make them comfortable with what they have heading down the stretch."
