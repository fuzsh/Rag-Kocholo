        "text": "World champions Argentina will defend their Copa América title against Colombia in Miami on Sunday – the first time the two sides have faced off in the tournament’s final.\n\nThe Cafeteros beat Uruguay 1-0 in the second semi-final in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday night to secure their place in the title-decider.\n\nLed by Argentine coach Nestor Lorenzo, Colombia overcame a dangerous Celeste side with a goal from Jefferson Lerma after 38 minutes. After suffering a red card when right-back Daniel Munoz was irresponsibly sent off in first-half stoppage time, they managed to hang on for a famous victory.\n\nThe Cafeteros have not reached a Copa América final since 2001 when, as hosts, they took the title by beating Mexico in Bogotá.\n\n\"We are happy to put a smile on the faces of the Colombian people. We feel a lot of satisfaction. It's the best reward,\" said Lorenzo.\n\nReigning World Cup and Copa América champions Argentina are unsurprisingly the main candidates to lift the trophy on Sunday at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, though Colombia’s reputation is growing after seeing off challenges from Brazil and Uruguay, two of the region's heavyweights and favourites for the title.\n\nA year and a half after embroidering their third star on the AFA emblem, Argentina are chasing the “Triple Crown.” It would be a massive achievement if they can add the Copa title to their trophy cabinet.\n\nArgentina, with 15 titles, are the joint most successful team in competition’s history along with Uruguay. One more trophy would take them clear of their neighbours.\n\nColombia, however, are also right on form and extended a long unbeaten run to 28 matches (25 under Lorenzo) with the victory over Uruguay – breaking the national team’s previous record of 27 matches set by Francisco Maturana's team between 1992 and 1994.\n\nSo what will make the difference? Will it be Colombia’s star forward Luis Díaz or veteran playmaker James Rodríguez, who is in his best form for years?\n\nOr will we see another match-winning performance from Ángel Di María, who will retire from international football with Argentina after the tournament?\n\nAs the Copa America nears its epilogue, some are asking if Albiceleste skipper Lionel Messi could also be taking his last bow? Earlier this week, he said he was enjoying his “last battles” with the national team.\n\n\"Let's enjoy what we are experiencing as a national team. It's not easy for us to be in a final again, to be competing to be champions again. It's very difficult and we did it again,\" said Messi after reaching the final.\n\n\"I'm living it like everything else recently: enjoying it very much and being aware, like Fideo [Di María] and Ota [defender Nicolás Otamendi], that these are the last battles,\" said the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner.\n\nAfter winning the 2022 World Cup, Scaloni said he would save Messi a place for the 2026 World Cup in North America. It remains unclear if the captain will take the coach up on the offer, but first, there’s one more fight to win.\n\n– TIMES/AFP"
