        "text": "BUFF / STRAUB / HENSMAN / SMITH\n\nCONRAD BUFF III, FAIA (1926-1989)\n\nBuff was born and raised in Eagle Rock CA. His parents were Mary and Conrad Buff II, creators of illustrated children's books. Family acquaintances included Richard Neutra and Rudolph Schindler. Redesigning the Buff garage was one of Neutra's early independent architectural commissions. Buff attended Eagle Rock High School. He served in the Navy in WWII and graduated from USC School of Architecture in 1952, where he befriended fellow architect Donald C. Hensman.\n\nCALVIN C. STRAUB, FAIA (1920-1998)\n\nStraub was born in Macon GA. He studied at Texas A&M University and Pasadena City College before receiving his degree in architecture at USC in 1945. After serving in the Navy, Straub lectured at USC from 1946 to 1961 and later at Arizona State University. He worked for A. B. Gallion before entering into a partnership with Buff & Hensman (1956-1961) and Schoneburger Strau Florence (1972-1975). He wrote Design Process and Communications (1978) and The Man-Made Environment: An Introduction to World Architecture and Design (1983). Until retirement in 1988 he taught at Arizona State University where his world architecture class attended by more than 15,000 students. Straub also ran his own private practice earning over 30 awards. His archives are at Arizona State University.\n\nDONALD CHARLES HENSMAN, FAIA (1924-2002)\n\nHensman grew up in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles CA, graduated from Hollywood HS in 1941, and served in the Navy during WWII. He got an architecture degree from USC in 1952 where he later taught 1952 to 1963. Hensman retired in 1997. Just before he died in 2002, the Pasadena Heritage Oral History Project did a 10-part interview, led by Sarah Cooper. Parts: 1A 1B 2A 2B 3A 3B 4A 4B 5A 5B, courtesy of Pasadena Heritage.\n\nDENNIS GEORGE SMITH, AIA (1936-2022)\n\nSmith enrolled at the USC School in Architecture in 1954, studying under Don Hensman, Cal Straub, Garrett Eckbo, and Gregory Ain. Smith graduated in 1960, joined the National Guard, then worked for Jack Simison in La CaÃ±ada Flintridge. He designed a house for his parents that was across the street from BSH's Dubnoff House. He persuaded the LA Times to feature the Dubnoff House and that got him a job with the firm in 1963. He left in 1967 when work slowed down to work for other firms including Smith and Williams in Pasadena CA. Smith returned as an associate in 1974, became a partner in 1988, and led the firm upon Don Hensman's 1997 retirement.\n\nResearch by Catherine Westegaard Cramer and Michael Locke.\n\nIncredible John Crosse Bibliography\n\nSubdivisions: Bellehurst * Dow Knolls * Glendora * La Mirada 18723 * Lake Marie * Lakewood 13202 and 13205 * Lomita 16150 * Lomita 16610\n\nAround 1949 - The Raymond Joseph Sedlachek House, 3385 Beverly Glen Boulevard, Los Angeles CA. 1469sf.
