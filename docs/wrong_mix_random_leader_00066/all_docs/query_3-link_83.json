        "text": "As Wray & Nephew White Overproof Rum enters into the second year of its partnership with the Jamaica Premier League (JPL), it launched new-look jerseys at the Appleton Estate Jamaica Rum Festival.\n\nThe patrons of the festival, held at the Catherine’s Hall Sports Complex on July 18, 2023, experienced a fashion show showcasing six of the 14 team’s jerseys.\n\nThe fashion show unveiled the new kits for JPL 2024 season winner Cavalier FC, and the runner-up Mount Pleasant Football Academy. Also highlighted were the jerseys for Harbour View FC, Portmore United FC and Arnett Gardens FC and Montego Bay United FC (MBUFC).\n\nOn hand to see the show were executives of MBUFC, who lead the only top-tier professional football club from Jamaica’s western region, including Coach Rodolfo Zapata, General Manager Sumil Reid and Director Anthony Cameron.\n\n“These jerseys are another manifestation of the Wray Rum partnership with the JPL, said Kerry-Ann Bryan, brand manager of Wray & Nephew White Overproof Rum. “Our patrons at the Appleton Estate Jamaica Rum Festival were the first to see and appreciate this next layer of support.\n\n“Wray & Nephew has been a storied sponsor of football in Jamaica. We offer over $300 million in support across the Jamaica Football Federation national men’s and women’s programmes as well as to the JPL and Kingston and St Andrew Football Association (KSAFA),” Bryan explained after the jerseys were revealed.\n\nThe kits were produced in partnership with Admiral and brandish bold colours, unique patterns, and details that represent each club, its surrounding community and showcases each Football Club’s history. The 14 JPL teams will utilise the home and away vibrant kit designs for 2024/25 season.\n\nHaving launched the kits, Rum Fest eventgoers had the opportunity to get first dibs on their jersey pick from the Wray & Nephew White Overproof Rum football-themed festival booth.\n\nThe JPL and Admiral collection can also be purchased online via the Admiral website, or at the Locker Room Sports location in Kingston.\n\nLionel Messi will miss the annual MLS All-Star game in Columbus on Wednesday due to his ongoing ankle injury, MLS has confirmed.\n\nThe Argentina captain sustained the injury during his nation's Copa America final victory over Colombia on July 14.\n\nMessi subsequently left the pitch in tears, and watched from the dugout as substitute Lautaro Martinez struck an extra-time winner in Miami.\n\nThe eight-time Ballon d'Or winner was expected to be part of the annual clash between an MLS XI and Liga MX XI.\n\nHowever, he was listed as unavailable on the MLS website along with fellow Inter Miami forward Luis Suarez, though their team-mates Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets are both included.\n\nThe likes of Hugo Lloris, Christian Benteke and Federico Bernadeschi also feature in the MLS roster, while Andre-Pierre Gignac and Salomon Rondon will feature for the Liga MX All-Stars.\n\nIan Maatsen labelled Aston Villa head coach as \"brilliant\" as he prepares for the club's maiden appearance in this season's Champions League.\n\nMaatsen completed his £37.5million switch from Chelsea while on international duty with the Netherlands at Euro 2024.\n\nThe 22-year-old, who did not feature for Ronald Koeman's side in Germany, signed a six-year deal at Villa Park following an impressive loan spell with Borussia Dortmund last season.\n\nMaatsen made 16 Bundesliga appearances, scoring two goals and helping Die Schwarzgelben reach the Champions League final, playing the full duration of their 2-0 defeat to Real Madrid at Wembley.\n\nEmery led Villa to a fourth place finish in the Premier League, and has become well known for his success on the European stage during his time in Spain.\n\nThe Spaniard has won the Europa League on four different ocassions, while also guiding Villa to the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League last term.\n\n\"Last season they did very well and the coach obviously is a brilliant coach with a lot of experience in Europe,\" Maatsen told Aston Villa's official club website.\n\n\"They are playing Champions League football this season so it is exciting. \"He is a manager who loves to play football and win trophies.\n\n\"That was the challenge for me to come here and show the people that I am capable of doing these things at the highest level.\"\n\nMaatsen made his Champions League debut in Dortmund's last 16 fixture against PSV Eindhoven, going on to make seven appearances in the competition.\n\nAnd while many predict Emery's side to follow Newcastle after trying to juggle league and European commitments, the defender insisted that he is confident that Villa can become regulars in Europe's elite club competition.\n\n\"It's good because obviously we are here now to earn a spot in the Champions League every year - it's such a great competition.\"\n\nMaatsen is one of seven new arrivals at Villa Park, with Emery taking his spending this transfer window to £140million after the arrival of Amadou Onana from Everton was confirmed on Monday.\n\nVilla begin the 2024-25 season away to West Ham on August 17, a side they have failed to beat away from home in the league since a 2-1 victory at Upton Park back in April 2011."
