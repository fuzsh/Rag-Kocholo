        "text": "For immediate use\n\nMorehead-Cain Foundation announces Class of 2020\n\nFoundation welcomes 66 new scholars to UNC-Chapel Hill from across the state, the country and the globe\n\n(Chapel Hill, N.C. – April 22, 2016) – The Morehead-Cain Foundation—home of the first merit scholarship program in the United States, and founded at the first public university in the U.S.—is proud to announce its class of 2020.\n\nThis fall, Morehead-Cain will welcome to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 66 new Morehead-Cain Scholars from across North Carolina, the U.S. and the world.\n\nThe class of 2020 includes 35 scholars from North Carolina and 31 scholars from outside the state including: 24 scholars from 20 different states; three scholars from the United Kingdom; three scholars from Canada; one scholar from Italy; and one scholar from South Africa.\n\nThe Morehead-Cain Scholarship covers all expenses for four years of undergraduate study at UNC-Chapel Hill. It also features a distinctive program of summer enrichment experiences designed to support students as they learn and grow. During the course of four summers, scholars will have opportunities to complete an outdoor leadership course; commit themselves to public service in the U.S. or abroad; conduct research at sites around the world; and gain experience in private enterprise.\n\nThe Morehead-Cain Discovery Fund complements the Summer Enrichment Program. Scholars receive financial support and are encouraged, and to more deeply explore their interests, whether they involve studying under celebrated artists, attending leadership retreats, or obtaining wilderness first responder certification. From researching renewable energy technologies in Europe to tracing the path of native bumblebees in the Patagonia region of Chile, Morehead-Cain Scholars are given the resources to pursue educational opportunities wherever they may find them.\n\nThe selection criteria for Morehead-Cain Scholars are leadership, academic achievement, moral force of character and physical vigor. Recipients are chosen solely on the basis of merit and accomplishment.\n\nMore than 200 Morehead-Cain Scholars study on campus and make outstanding contributions across the full range of University life. From student government to community service to the performing arts, Morehead-Cain Scholars play a prominent role in Carolina’s vibrant student community. For example, during the past 10 years, six student body presidents, four student attorneys general and four honor court chairs have been Morehead-Cains.\n\nSince 2000, 14 Morehead-Cain Scholars have won Rhodes Scholarships to England’s Oxford University, one of the world’s most competitive and prestigious awards for graduate study. Since the first Morehead Scholars graduated from Carolina in 1957, 31 of Carolina’s 34 Rhodes Scholars have been Morehead-Cain Scholars.\n\nMorehead-Cains have accounted for 24 of the University’s 37 Luce Scholars and 19 of Carolina’s 30 Truman Scholars, among the nation’s most generous and distinguished awards for graduate study. Twenty-seven Morehead-Cain Scholars have won Fulbright Fellowships; three have won Gates Cambridge Scholarships for graduate study at the University of Cambridge in England; and two Morehead-Cains are among the inaugural class of Schwarzman Scholars, an elite China-based graduate scholarship enrolling its first students in 2016.\n\nLike the scholars, the 3,000 Morehead-Cain alumni across the world are a diverse and distinguished group. They include:\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning author Taylor Branch;\n\nU.S. Congressmen Jim Cooper and David Price;\n\nSallie Krawcheck, owner of Ellevate Network and former head of Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney;\n\nJonathan Reckford, chief executive officer of Habitat for Humanity International;\n\nKaren Stevenson, a U.S. Magistrate Judge and the first black American woman to win the Rhodes Scholarship;\n\nNew York Times columnist and author Frank Bruni;\n\nTim Sullivan, chief executive officer of Ancestry.com;\n\nAnn Livermore, current board of directors member and former executive vice president at Hewlett-Packard;\n\nAdam Falk, president of Williams College;\n\nMichelle Jana Chan, travel and adventure journalist and acting deputy editor of Condé Nast Traveler;\n\nBobby Evans, general manager of the San Francisco Giants;\n\nBest-selling novelist Shilpi Somaya Gowda;\n\nPeter Henry, dean of New York University’s Stern School of Business;\n\nDanae Ringelmann, co-founder of the crowd-funding platform Indiegogo; and\n\nFrancis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nFounded in 1945, the Morehead-Cain has been a model for countless merit awards throughout the country. These include the University of Virginia’s Jefferson Scholars Program, Duke University’s Benjamin N. Duke Scholars Program and Emory University’s Woodruff Scholars Program.\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.moreheadcain.org or call the foundation at (919) 962-1201.
