Just one win away from reaching the 1000 match win plateau in ATP doubles.\n\nDOB: Sept 4, 1972 In: Belgrade, Yugoslavia\n\nEarly Tennis Memory: “Winning my first ever match, first tournament I ever played (age ten). I thought I was great. Then the next day I got killed by one of the better players. (Remember his name?) I think his name was Campbell Berry.”\n\nChildhood Heroes: “Connors. I was a big Connors man when I was growing up. When I started playing tennis, I used to hit against the wall right beside our apartment and I used to pretend I was Jimmy Connors. I admired the way he used his emotions. He gave a hundred percent every match, got the crowd going, things like that.”\n\nGreatest Career Moment: “I don’t know, either winning gold or winning Wimbledon.”\n\nMost Painful Moment: “When I hit the top of the net on a follow-through – to put myself in the winning position at the US Open. Trying to win the first Grand Slam. We were up 5-4 serving in the tiebreaker in the second set. I hit a winner but as I was following-through I hit the top of the net. So instead of 6-4 (championship point), it’s 5-All. We had a couple of match points and lost it.”\n\nWhich Match Were You At Your Best: “Beat Guga at Davis Cup, singles.”\n\nStrangest Matches: “At the French Open one year I lost half my tooth in a collision with Mark Knowles. Going for a ball. That was kind of weird – to pick it up off the court and glue it back on later [smiles]. What else? My partner (Kiki Mladenovic) hit me on the ear last year, mixed doubles, on a late return. But that’s not strange, that’s normal. But I’ve hit my partner twice with serves on the side of the head. Actually, Knowles hit me on the side of the head – first serve. That hurt.”\n\nWhy Do You Love Playing Tennis: “Because I’m good at it [smiles]. I’m not good at anything else [laughs].” (This part of the Biofile was done in Newport in 2014 – below was done at US Open 2002.)\n\n———————————————————————————————————————-Tennis Hero: “Jimmy Connors – when I started playing tennis I used to hit against the wall right beside our apartment building and I used to pretend I was Jimmy Connors. I admired the way he used his emotions and gave a hundred percent every match, got the crowd going, things like that.”\n\nFirst Job: “Only job – helping my brother Alex deliver newspapers when I was six (Toronto Star).”\n\nClosest Tennis Friend(s): “Unfortunately my doubles partner (Knowles), although he’s the cockiest guy around he’s still my closest friend [smiles].”\n\nFunniest Players: “Well there’s no personalities in the game [laughs]. I’m gonna have to get back to you on that one. Knowles who is the funniest guy on Tour? (Knowles offers Mardy Fish). Mardy Fish – he’s got a great personality (James Blake chimes in with a smile: “Mardy Fish, he hates that).”\n\nToughest Competitors: “I’ve played all the big names. Just dominating the way they play. You do all the running. I’ve never played Hewitt, although we played him in doubles, I can imagine what it would be like in singles, getting every ball back.”\n\nMost Painful Moment: “Losing here (US Open) in the ’98 final. We were up 5-4 serving in the tiebreaker in the second. I hit a winner but as I was following through I hit the top of the net. So instead of 6-4 (championship point) – it was 5-all. We had a couple of match points and lost it.”\n\nGreatest Sports Moment: “Winning the gold medal for Canada in the Olympics 2000. Beating the Woodies in doubles in Sydney (with Sebastien Lareau).”\n\nNo tags\n\n<< Opinion: Kyrgios is the Heir Apparent"
