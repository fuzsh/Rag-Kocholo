        "text": "Triple-A: Memphis Redbirds (STL) 8, Norfolk Tides 5\n\nA six-run Memphis sixth inning tanked what was otherwise shaping up to be a tidy win for the Tides. With the score 5-2, the Tides’ Carlos Tavera allowed six hits, including two home runs to former Orioles farmhand César Prieto and Thomas Saggese. That duo had walked and homered in order back in the first against Norfolk starter Brandon Young. Otherwise, Young was fine, completing four innings without further damage. Colin Selby, Trey McGough and Nolan Hoffman all threw scoreless outings.\n\nThe Tides scored five runs, all in innings two through four. Nick Maton hit a two-run homer in the second inning. In the third, Jackson Holliday doubled, stole third, and scored on a wild pitch. In the fourth inning, Norfolk’s runs four and five scored on a Memphis throwing error and… ah yes, another hit by Jackson Holliday. He went 3-for-5 on the day and would seem to have his mojo back.\n\nNot much offense outside of that: Connor Norby and Billy Cook went hitless, and Coby Mayo had just a single. OK, we’re spoiled with Mayo, what can I say.\n\nBox Score\n\nDouble-A: Altoona Curve (PIT) 5, Bowie Baysox 3\n\nThe Baysox went 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position and left twelve men on. Of eight hits on the day, just one was for extra-bases, a Collin Burns double. Burns and Frederick Bencosme were the only Baysox with multiple hits. Matthew Etzel singled, walked and drove in a run. John Rhodes singled and walked.\n\nAltoona scored three runs on two home runs against starter Trace Bright in four innings. Levi Stoudt allowed in one more over an inning of work. Kyle Brnovich threw three innings, surrendering one more run.\n\nOutfielder Jud Fabian, MLB Pipeline’s No. 11 Orioles prospect, was removed from the game early after being hit in the head during an at-bat.\n\nBox Score\n\nHigh-A: Aberdeen IronBirds 8, Asheville Tourists (HOU) 7\n\nThis was a nailbiter, but don’t blame the starting pitching. Aberdeen built up an 8-1 lead largely on a trio of home runs. Tavian Josenberger hit his seventh in the first inning, and Jalen Vasquez and catcher Randy Florentino each hit a four-bagger in the second. It was a monster game for Florentino, who would add a second RBI with a fourth-inning double and two more RBI’s with another double in the sixth. Enrique Bradfield doubled in a run, too, and Mac Horvath went 2-for-4 with a double.\n\nStarter Jackson Baumeister was very good, going 4.2 innings with just one run allowed on a homer. But Daniel Lloyd’s no-good, very bad day made this one closer than it needed to be. Lloyd allowed four runs to score in the seventh and one more in the eighth on six hits total, including a homer. Cooper Chandler made it a one-run game when he surrendered a ninth-inning home run, but he kept his cool and got the save.\n\nBox Score\n\nLow-A: Delmarva Shorebirds 9, Lynchburg Hillcats (CLE) 0\n\nNo suspense here, and that’s just fine by us. Three Shorebirds pitchers combined for an absolute gem, holding the Hillcats to three hits, all singles, with no walks. Nestor German (1-3, 1.80 ERA in 12 games) threw 3.2 scoreless innings, Harif Frías retired the one batter he faced, and Blake Money earned the win with a dazzling five innings where he didn’t allow a baserunner.\n\nDelmarva hitters scored two in the third before blowing the game open in the eighth inning with seven runs. The first bunch came in a fun way, on back-to-back triples by Braylin Tavera and Aron Estrada and a single by Leandro Arias. The eighth inning was a mess, frankly, with two Lynchburg throwing errors and three wild pitches. But in the fray, Kevin Guerrero and Maikol Hernández each hit two-run doubles. Tavera, Arias, Guerrero and Cole Urman all had two or more hits.\n\nBox Score\n\nThis Week’s Schedule:\n\nO’s affiliates will be off until Friday, July 19."
