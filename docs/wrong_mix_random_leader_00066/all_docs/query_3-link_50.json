        "text": "Happy retirement Daniel!\n\nCanadian tennis legend Daniel Nestor officially retired from tennis last Saturday after playing in his final Davis Cup match and a career spanning almost 30 years. Nestor is the most decorated Canadian tennis player in history and one of the most decorated doubles tennis players ever. He was ranked the world No. 1 doubles player for a total of 108 weeks between 2002 and 2012. With his 91 ATP doubles titles, he is currently 10th for most men’s ATP titles in Open Era history and the third most decorated among doubles players. He was the first player in doubles tennis history to win every Grand Slam and Masters Series event, the Year-End Championships and Olympic gold medal at least once in his career. In January 2016, Nestor became the first doubles player in ATP history to win 1000 matches. From 1994 to 2016, he had a streak of 23 consecutive years with at least one men’s doubles title. He was continuously ranked in the top 100 in doubles from April 1994 to April 2018, a total of 1134 consecutive weeks. He was named ATP Doubles Team of the Year in 2002 and 2004 (with Mark Knowles) and 2008 (with Nenad Zimonjić), and the ITF World Champion in doubles in 2002 (with Knowles) and in 2008 (with Zimonjić). Nestor also received the Tennis Canada male player of the year award in 1997, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.\n\nNestor has won a Gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics with Sébastien Lareau, 4 ATP World Tour Finals with Mark Knowles (1), Nenad Zimonjić (2) and Max Mirnyi (1), 8 Grand Slam men’s doubles titles also with Knowles (3), Zimonjić (3) and Mirnyi (2), and 28 ATP Masters titles. In addition, he has won 4 Grand Slam mixed doubles titles with Elena Likhovtseva (1), Katarina Srebotnik (1) and Kristina Mladenovic (2). Over his career with the Canadian Davis Cup team, he has the records for most total wins (48), most doubles wins (33), most ties played (53) and most years played (25). He is also tied in third place for most singles wins (15). For his achievements, he was awarded the Davis Cup Commitment Award in 2012.\n\nIn singles, Nestor achieved a career-high singles ranking of world No. 58 in 1999. He has four wins over top-10 opponents, including a win over then world No. 1 Stefan Edberg in 1992, former world No. 1 players Andre Agassi and Thomas Muster in 1996, and top-5 player Thomas Enqvist in 1997. His best results in singles in Grand Slam tournaments were a fourth round appearance at the 1999 Wimbledon and third round finishes at the 1998, 1999 and 2001 Australian Open. He has also won 4 ATP Challenger titles in singles and 9 in doubles.\n\nNestor was appointed to the Order of Canada in November 2010. In 2011, he received a star on Canada’s Walk of Fame and was inducted at Elgin Theatre in Toronto. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by York University in August 2012. Nestor was inducted into the Canadian Tennis Hall of Fame in August 2018.\n\nHappy retirement Daniel, thank you for all you have done for Canadian tennis. We wish you all the best in your future projects."
