        "text": "When it comes to Neymar and the Brazil national team, the temptation — for the casual observer, at least — is to assume that we’re now firmly into epilogue territory.\n\nNeymar is 32 years old. He moved from Paris Saint-Germain to Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal in August last year, embracing near irrelevance at club level. He suffered a bad knee injury nine months ago and has not played since. Even before that, he had appeared a fading force in physical terms, that lovely gazelle spring of his early years a distant memory.\n\nIn international football, meanwhile, there has been a changing of the guard. Fifteen players have made their senior Brazil debuts since Neymar’s most recent cap, which came against Uruguay in October. Endrick, the Real Madrid-bound 17-year-old, is his nation’s new darling. Rodrygo is wearing the No 10 shirt and Vinicius Junior is the player the Brazilian public clings to in moments of peril.\n\nGame over, then? Have we reached the end of the Neymar era?\n\nNot a bit of it.\n\nThere’s a lot of optimism about this team. Luis Diaz is a true global star and a game-changing presence any national team would covet. James Rodriguez still has the ability to open up a defense with this vision and clinical passing. When he wears the Colombia shirt, the former Real Madrid No 10 plays at another level.\n\nOverall, Colombia is a solid side from top to bottom. Their harshest critics back home have issued an ultimatum: either win the Copa America or accept a role as a second-rate side when compared to Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.\n\nAgain, history is not on Colombia’s side when it comes to elevated expectations. The scars from the 1994 World Cup, also in the U.S., in which Colombia was deemed favorites but finished last in their group with two defeats in the three matches, remain unhealed. Colombia won its lone Copa America in 2001, as the hosts against a weakened field (Argentina withdrew late on over security concerns). They reached the semifinals of the 2016 and 2021 tournaments.\n\nThe time is now for Colombia to showcase the talent it possesses and lift a trophy against the best in the region.\n\nDespite a national team replete with European-based players (only one player from the squad plays in the Colombian league), Colombia still battles against its history at major tournaments.\n\nThe previous Copa America in 2021 was yet another example of them coming up short on the big stage, as they finished third after losing to eventual champions Argentina in a semifinal penalty shootout. The lack of a championship mindset continues to leave Colombia in the second-best category among South America’s top teams.\n\nTactically, they can be exposed in central midfield. Lorenzo believes 32-year-old James Rodriguez can still be Colombia’s talisman a decade on from his starring role at the 2014 World Cup but the playmaking No 10 will not be counted on to track an opposing midfield runner.\n\nNestor Lorenzo is into his second year as Colombia’s head coach. His appointment, in June 2022, was controversial. Lorenzo is Argentinian and he succeeded Reinaldo Rueda, a Colombian who failed to lead his nation to qualification for that year’s World Cup. Foreign managers in Colombia tend to divide the fanbase, though Lorenzo’s previous ties to the Colombian national team have eased that tension, for now.\n\nHe was the chief assistant under Jose Pekerman, another Argentinian, who coached Colombia to the 2014 and 2018 World Cup tournaments, either side of a third-place finish in the 2016 Copa. Pekerman remains well respected in Colombia and that helped Lorenzo earn some respect from the demanding fans and media who cover the team.\n\nThis is only Lorenzo’s second head-coaching position. After a lengthy career as an assistant at the club level and his time on Pekerman’s staff, he managed Peruvian side Melgar for a year and a half before getting the Colombia job.\n\nDespite that lack of experience as the top man, Lorenzo is yet to lose in over 20 matches in charge. The streak includes friendly wins against Germany (2-0) and Spain (1-0), and a key World Cup qualifying defeat of Brazil (2-1) in November last year. Colombia also thrashed the USMNT, 5-1 away, in a Copa warm-up game.\n\nIt is vanishingly rare for the side known as the Selecao (the selection) to compete at a tournament without a big, looming cloud of obligation in tow. Brazilian fans can be exceptionally demanding, and not always — not even often — in a manner that benefits their team.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the run-up to this Copa America has been refreshingly breezy. With no Neymar, no Casemiro and no Thiago Silva, this is not just a younger, fresher squad; it is also one with fewer bad memories, less psychological scar tissue, less accumulated trauma. There is a levity to the mood, among players and fans alike.\n\nDorival deserves huge credit for this. He will also be well aware that the momentum can shift in a fraction of a second — and that tournament football has its own internal gravity. If Brazil win today the usual expectations will probably kick in, and anything less than a spot in the semi-finals will be regarded as an abject failure.\n\nThey have staggering quality and depth in the wing department. Most obviously, there is Vinicius Junior, who appears ready to make this side his own after slowly emerging from the shadow of the injured Neymar at international level. His relationship with fellow Real Madrid man Rodrygo, who loves to drift over and join him on the left flank, will be critical to Brazil’s hopes today.\n\nThey are backed up by four further options: Raphinha, Gabriel Martinelli, Pepe and Savio. The latter, a left-footed flyer who can play on either side, is a new face in the squad but an exciting one. If his form on loan at Spanish side Girona last season is anything to go by, he will be an explosive trump card off the bench.\n\nOn a more prosaic note, the sense of security conferred by an excellent goalkeeper (Alisson) and solid centre-backs (Marquinhos and Eder Militao, or Gabriel if the latter is not fully fit after a season almost entirely lost to a knee injury) is not to be overlooked.\n\nIt’s lucky Dorival Junior has a reputation as a managerial firefighter, because he walked into a towering inferno when he took the Brazil job in January. He became their third coach since the 2022 World Cup little more than a year earlier — and the third one who wasn’t Carlo Ancelotti, the man the Brazilian federation had been expecting to lead the team at this Copa America and beyond.\n\nOn the pitch, performances had been poor, and results even worse: Brazil lost three of their first six World Cup qualifiers, leaving them sixth in the 10-team South American group, below Venezuela and also Ecuador, who started the campaign on minus three points. Dorival inherited a team low on confidence and devoid of direction, lurching along in the dark.\n\nIt would be an exaggeration to say that all is now wine and roses, but the outlook has certainly shifted since that low ebb.\n\nThe genial, paternalistic 62-year-old has been a breath of fresh air, uniting the squad and restoring an intangible sense of calm around the setup. It does not hurt that he is widely liked by journalists, many of whom have grown to know him well across his two decades in Brazilian club football.\n\nTactically, he is flexible rather than didactic. “I never arrive with a pre-conceived system,” Dorival explained at his first press conference. “I prefer to work out what I have at my disposal and then decide on tactics.”"
