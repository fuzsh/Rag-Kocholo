        "text": "The Springfield Lasers are taking their sixth trip to the World TeamTennis presented by GEICO (WTT) Championship Final after a 25-18 winner-take-all victory over the San Diego Aviators Thursday evening in Carlsbad, Calif.\n\nSpringfield won six of their final seven matches, with an 8-6 season record. Thursday’s win places Springfield in the league’s No. 2 spot, allowing the team to advance to the 2018 championship match against the top-seeded Philadelphia Freedoms (12-2), set for 1 p.m. CST at the Daskalakis Athletic Center on the campus of Drexel University in Philadelphia. Match coverage begins on ESPN3, with ESPN2 joining the live action at 2 p.m.\n\n“It feels great,” said Abigail Spears, who scored the winning point with a put-away volley in extended play. ”It’s my first final and as a team, we didn’t expect to be here in this position at this point, so we’re pretty happy. I think it’s just all the competition that we get here. It’s so fun, and a team atmosphere, and that’s what we love as players. We just love it.”\n\nThe Lasers got off to a fast start Thursday, with Serbian rookie Miomir Kecmanovic and new Lasers player Marcelo Demoliner taking men’s doubles 5-4. The Lasers’ Vania King, an American, dominated women’s singles 5-2, and Kecmanovic took men’s singles 5-3, giving the Lasers a commanding 15-9 halftime lead.\n\nSpringfield continued strong play in women’s doubles as King and American Abigail Spears edged over the Aviators 5-4, to extend Springfield’s lead to 20-13.\n\nAfter losing mixed doubles in a tiebreaker in a 5-4 tiebreaker, Spears and Demoliner clinched the win for Springfield as they won the first game in extended play.\n\nDemoliner, from Brazil, was traded to the team early Thursday to replace Canadian doubles specialist Daniel Nestor, whose personal schedule does not allow him to participate in Sunday’s final.\n\nSunday’s championship final with be the sixth for the Lasers, who have previously vied for the King Cup in 2014, 2013, 2010, 2009 and 1999.\n\nAll but one championship match has been under the leadership of South African Coach John-Laffnie “JL” de Jager, who has coached the Lasers for the last 12 consecutive seasons. De Jager is a three-time WTT Coach of the Year, including his first season with the Lasers, 2007, when he led the team to a 13-1 regular season record. Before coaching, de Jager played seven seasons of WTT.\n\nThe Springfield Lasers were established in 1996 and are one of the oldest teams in the WTT league. They are managed by the Springfield-Greene County Park Board and play home matches at Cooper Tennis Complex.\n\nFor more information on Springfield Lasers, visit springfieldlasers.com, or look for Springfield Lasers on Facebook or @SGFLasers on Twitter.\n\nFor more information on World TeamTennis, visit WTT.com"
