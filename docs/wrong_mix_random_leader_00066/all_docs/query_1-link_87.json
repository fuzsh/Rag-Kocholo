Nu2 Lupi (HD 136352) is a naked-eye (V=5.8) Sun-like star that was discovered to host three low-mass planets with orbital periods of 11.6, 27.6, and 107.6 days via radial velocity monitoring with HARPS. The two inner planets (b and c) were recently found to transit by TESS, prompting us to follow up the system with CHEOPS. This led to the exciting discovery that the outer planet d is also transiting. With its bright Sun-like star, long period, and mild irradiation (~5.7 times the irradiation of Earth), Nu2 Lupi d unlocks a completely new region in the parameter space of exoplanets amenable to detailed characterization. We measured its radius and mass to be 2.56+/-0.09 R_Earth and 8.82+/-0.94 M_Earth, respectively, and refined the properties of all three planets: planet b likely has a rocky mostly dry composition, while planets c and d seem to have retained small hydrogen-helium envelopes and a possibly large water fraction. This diversity of planetary compositions makes the Nu2 Lupi system an excellent laboratory for testing formation and evolution models of low-mass planets.\n\nLooking for a unicorn: Discovery of a nearby, mass gap black hole candidate\n\nschedule: Friday, 19:55 UT / 15:55 ET (invited)\n\nTharindu Jayasinghe (The Ohio State University)\n\nKrzysztof Z. Stanek, Todd A. Thompson, Christopher S. Kochanek, Dominick M. Rowan, Patrick J. Vallely, and David V. Martin (The Ohio State University)\n\nOur knowledge of compact object binaries is very biased. Historically, we have only identified them if they are accreting in mass transfer systems, contain pulsars or through the gravitational waves from merging systems. To fully understand their numbers, properties, formation mechanisms and evolutionary paths, new discoveries of non-interacting compact binaries are necessary. We discovered the closest known black hole candidate as a binary companion to V723 Mon. V723 Mon is a nearby (~460 pc), bright (V~8.3 mag), evolved (T_eff~4440 K, and L~173 Lâ) red giant in a high mass function, f(M)=1.72 Â± 0.01 Mâ, nearly circular binary (P~59.9 days, e~0). V723 Mon has previously been classified as an eclipsing binary, but its ASAS, KELT, and TESS light curves are those of a nearly edge-on ellipsoidal variable. Detailed models of the light curves constrained by the period, radial velocities and stellar temperature give an inclination of 87.0Â±2Â°, a mass ratio of q=0.33 Â± 0.02, a companion mass of M_comp=3.04 Â± 0.06 Mâ, the radius of the giant as R=24.9 Â± 0.7 Râ, and the giantâs mass as M_giant=1.00 Â± 0.07 Mâ. The simplest explanation for the massive companion is a single compact object, most likely a black hole in the \"mass gap\".\n\nNever-before-seen Variability in Evolved Supergiants as Revealed by TESS\n\nschedule: Wednesday, 13:00 UT / 09:00 ET (invited)\n\nTrevor Dorn-Wallenstein (University of Washington)\n\nEmily M. Levesque (1), Kathryn F. Neugent (1, 2), James R. A. Davenport (1), Brett M. Morris (3), Keyan Gootkin (1) (1): University of Washington Astronomy Department (2): Lowell Observatory (3): Center for Space and Habitability, University of Bern\n\nMassive stars drive the radiative, chemical, and kinematic evolution of their host galaxies. Despite the importance of these stars, the physical factors that govern their progression through the exotic evolved states that we observe them in are poorly understood. Thanks to TESS, high-quality light curves of massive stars in their evolved stages are revealing never-before-seen phenomena that may help answer our most urgent questions. In this talk, I will discuss the two âflavorsâ of variability revealed by TESS in cool supergiants and how they impact our understanding of massive stellar evolution: Stochastic low frequency variability (SLFV) previously known to exist in O and B stars appears to be ubiquitous across the upper HR-diagram. Simultaneously, we have found a new class of variable yellow supergiants that pulsate with frequencies above ~1 d^-1. Both of these discoveries open the intriguing possibility of probing the interiors of massive stars in their final phases before core collapse. Finally, I will highlight our ongoing work coupling TESS data with high resolution spectroscopy to determine the nature of SLFV in cool supergiants.\n\nTESS Data for Asteroseismology (TâDA) Stellar Variability Classification Pipeline\n\nschedule: Thursday, 13:50 UT / 09:50 ET (invited)\n\nJeroen Audenaert (Institute of Astronomy, KU Leuven)\n\nAudenaert, J.

Department of Chemistry and Physics, Florida Gulf Coast University Aerts, C. Institute of Astronomy, KU Leuven Department of Astrophysics, IMAPP, Radboud University Nijmegen Max Planck Institute for Astronomy\n\nThe TESS Data for Asteroseismology working group has created a stellar variability classification pipeline to automatically classify the tens of millions of stars observed by the NASA TESS mission down to a magnitude of 15. The overall strategy of the pipeline consists in training multiple distinct supervised classifiers with different learning algorithms and features, and then combine their predictions into a metaclassifier to make the final classification. This way the metaclassifier can leverage the specific strengths of each classifier and find the correlations across the different classifiers to come to an optimal prediction. We have successfully validated our pipeline by applying it to a labelled set of Kepler Q9 data and to the 167,000 stars in Q9. In this contribution, we will present the method and its validation on the Kepler data, as well as the detailed plan for the knowledge transfer to the TESS dataset.\n\nStudying Core-Collapse Supernovae with TESS: Light Curve Characterization and Progenitor Size Estimates\n\nschedule: Monday, 19:55 UT / 15:55 ET (invited)\n\nPatrick Vallely (The Ohio State University)\n\nVallely, P. J. (OSU); Kochanek, C. S. (OSU); Stanek, K. Z. (OSU) ; Fausnaugh, M. (MIT); Shappee, B. J. (Hawaii)\n\nWe present TESS observations of twenty bright core-collapse supernovae with peak magnitudes brighter than 18 mag. Existing semi-analytic models fit the light curves of the Type II supernovae well, but do not yield reasonable estimates of the progenitor radius or explosion energy, likely because they are derived for use with ultraviolet observations while TESS observes in the near-infrared. Fitting the data instead with numerically simulated light curves, the rising light curves of the Type II supernovae are consistent with the explosions of red supergiants and the radius distribution is comparable to what is observed in the Milky Way. While we do not identify shock breakout emission for any individual event, when we combine the fit residuals of the Type II supernovae in our sample, we do find a greater than 5-sigma flux excess in the ~1 day before the start of the light-curve rise. It is likely that this excess is due to shock breakout emission, and that during its extended mission TESS will observe a Type II supernova bright enough for this signal to be detected directly.\n\nMass measurement with ESPRESSO of rocky and mini-Neptune exoplanets detected by TESS\n\nschedule: Monday, 14:40 UT / 10:40 ET\n\nFranÃ§ois Bouchy (Geneva Observatory )\n\nF. Bouchy, F. Pepe, C. Lovis and the ESPRESSO consortium\n\nTESS follow-up efforts using high-precision spectrographs are successfully underway to characterize transiting planets with radii below 4 Rearth. The highly-stabilized and high-resolution spectrograph ESPRESSO has been in operation at ESO/VLT since September 2019. Its 2-magnitude gain and improved radial velocity precision with respect to HARPS-like instruments allows a in-depth exploration of the rocky and mini-Neptune population detected by TESS. We will give an overview of TESS low-mass planets characterized so far with ESPRESSO-GTO program which focuses on exoplanets smaller than 2 Rearth and sub-Neptunes with stellar irradiation between 50x and 200x Earthâs irradiation. We will also present preliminary results on the program focused on mini-Neptune candidates with relatively weak stellar irradiation or long orbital periods which are not expected to experience intense irradiation or strong tidal forces.\n\nWhat have we learned about binary exoplanet host stars?\n\nschedule: Wednesday, 21:45 UT / 17:45 ET\n\nDavid Ciardi (NASA)\n\nSteve B. Howell (NASA) & Elise Furlan (NASA Exoplanet Archive)\n\nIt is well established that about one-half of FGK exoplanet host stars are in binary star systems with bound companions often within 0.5â or less. ``Third-lightâ flux contamination dilutes the transit signal, leading to underestimated planetary radii and has implications for both planet and stellar properties. High-resolution imaging observations, using speckle interferometric instruments at the Gemini North and South 8-m telescopes, provide spatial resolutions of a few to several 100 au and contrast limits of 5 to 9 magnitudes for the majority of TESS host stars. We have observed ~600 TESS exoplanet host stars with angular and contrast limits that are not plagued, as other studies have been, by incompleteness at the closest separations. We found that exoplanet host binaries have a mean orbital separation greater than that of field stars and binary host stars show a strong observational bias against the detection of Earth-size planet transits. A situation leading to highly incorrect occurrence rates for rocky planets, especially those in longer period, habitable zone orbits. We will review the progress of this work and present information to extend the understanding of exoplanetary detection, formation, dynamics and evolution.\n\nMapping the Orbital Obliquities of Young Planets\n\nschedule: Wednesday, 20:20 UT / 16:20 ET\n\nChristopher P Wirth (Harvard University, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)\n\nGeorge Zhou: USQ, CfA Sam Quinn: CfA\n\nThe orbital obliquity of a young planet is a useful tracer of the systemâs formation and migration history, and a large number of these measurements could help us understand the mechanisms shaping and moving exoplanets. TOI-942 is a young (about 60 Myr) planetary system identified last year, with two Neptune-sized planets in 4.3-day and 10.1-day orbits. We observed two partial transits of the inner planet, TOI-942b, using the Planet Finder Spectrograph, and used the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect to measure the projected orbital obliquity. Combining this with TESS light curve data, we determined the true orbital obliquity of TOI-942b. This is one of the youngest planets to have its obliquity characterized, and one of even fewer residing in a multi-planet system. I will discuss the TOI-942 system in the context of other young planetary systems that have been characterized, and their implications on the evolution of exoplanetary architectures.\n\nRevisiting the Kepler field with TESS\n\nschedule: Wednesday, 21:15 UT / 17:15 ET\n\nMatthew Battley (University of Warwick)\n\nMichelle Kunimoto (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), David Armstrong (University of Warwick), Don Pollacco (University of Warwick)\n\nThe Kepler field proved to be transformational for the exoplanet community, resulting in over 2000 confirmed transiting exoplanets and redefining what is ânormalâ for an exoplanet. In year two of its primary mission, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) returned to the Kepler field, offering key re-observations of interesting systems which had not been re-observed from space for seven years. Here we present results from TESS observations of the Kepler field, including a direct comparison between Kepler and TESS photometry for known exoplanets and updated ephemerides for 22 Kepler planets and 4 Kepler candidates. This constitutes all Kepler planets and candidates with sufficient signal to noise in the TESS 2min dataset to allow for updated ephemerides. We also present a series of interesting O-C diagrams for the re-observed systems, alongside the results for new TTV fits of five known multi-planet systems with significant TTVs (Kepler-18, Kepler-25, Kepler-51, Kepler-89, and Kepler-396). Through this analysis, TESS has again shown itself to be an incredibly powerful instrument for exoplanet follow-up as well as a prolific planet-finder in its own right.\n\nObserving Helium Outflows for Irradiated Exoplanets with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 15:05 UT / 11:05 ET\n\nJessica Luna (University of Texas at Austin)\n\nBrendan Bowler, University of Texas at Austin Bill Cochran, University of Texas at Austin Adam Kraus, University of Texas at Austin Danny Krolikowski, University of Texas at Austin Michael Gully-Santiago, University of Texas at Austin Suvrath Mahadevan, Penn State University Caroline Morley, University of Texas at Austin Joe Ninan, Penn State University Gudmundur Stefansson, Princeton University Quang Tran, University of Texas at Austin Andrew Vanderburg, University of Wisconson-Madison\n\nThe helium triplet at 10830 Ã m lends evidence for atmospheric escape from transiting planets. This feature has been detected in planets from Neptune-mass to Jupiter-mass; to date, it has been observed for planets orbiting active stars with sufficient short-ð´ EUV photons to populate the excited energy levels that generate this absorption feature. TESS is rapidly finding new transiting planets, the brightest being some of the best targets, to measure escaping helium exospheres. We measure the strength of the helium 10830 Ã m feature during and outside of transit for a range of exoplanets using the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder (HPF) spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) at McDonald Observatory, intending to detect escaping helium from their atmospheres. We present a proof of concept that the HPF at HET serves as an instrument to detect escaping helium atmospheres by detecting WASP-69bâs known helium exosphere (Nortmann+18). We present analysis of our large survey, including 2 new planets discovered by TESS, to measure excess helium absorption during transit for planets with a range of surface gravities, host stellar spectra, sizes, and ages to test the effect they have on helium loss and inferred atmospheric escape rates.\n\nSearching for Planetary Systems around White Dwarfs\n\nschedule: Wednesday, 21:00 UT / 17:00 ET\n\nAndrew Vanderburg (University of Wisconsin-Madison)\n\nWhite dwarfs are the end-states of most stars known to host exoplanets today, but we know precious little about the fate of planetary systems after stellar death. We are using the TESS mission to address this gap in knowledge by searching for planetary systems transiting white dwarf stars. Despite the white dwarf stars' intrinsic faintness, TESS can efficiently survey many more white dwarfs than previous searches thanks to its high duty cycle, fast sampling, and wide field of view. I will present results from this search, including the discovery of a giant planet candidate transiting the white dwarf WD 1856+534 b.\n\nTFOP SG1 Transit Follow-up Results and Your TESS Paper\n\nschedule: Monday, 15:25 UT / 11:25 ET\n\nKaren Alicia Collins (Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian)\n\nThe TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) Sub Group 1 (SG1) team conducts TESS transit follow-up photometry for the TFOP community. For transits deeper than ~700 ppm, the primary goal is to confirm the transit on the target, or to identify an off-target source responsible for the TESS detection. For transits shallower than ~700 ppm, the primary goal is to measure the light curves of neighboring stars to rule out or identify off-target sources that could be responsible for the TESS detection. For transits confirmed on target, we often measure transit depths across multiple optical bands, which can increase confidence in the planetary nature of the TOI, or may provide evidence of a false positive. For interesting TTV systems, we conduct long-term transit timing measurements. The SG1 reduced data products often result in a multitude of files available on ExoFOP-TESS. In this presentation, I will describe how to quickly understand the current disposition of a TOI and how to quickly interpret the SG1 reduced data products available on ExoFOP-TESS. I will also describe how to extract SG1 transit follow-up photometry from ExoFOP-TESS for inclusion in the joint modelling effort for your TESS paper.\n\nThe Chemical link between stars and their rocky planets\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 15:20 UT / 11:20 ET\n\nVardan Adibekyan (The Instituto de AstrofÃ­sica e CiÃªncias do EspaÃ§o (IA))\n\nCaroline Dorn, SÃ©rgio G. Sousa, Nuno C. Santos, Bertram Bitsch, Garik Israelian, Christoph Mordasini, et al\n\nBecause of their common origin, it is expected (or assumed) that the composition of planet building blocks should (to a first order) correlate with stellar atmospheric composition, especially for refractory elements. In fact, information on the relative abundance of refractory and major rock-forming elements such as Fe, Mg, Si are commonly used to improve interior estimates for terrestrial planets (e.g. Dorn et al. 2015; Unterborn et al. 2016) and has even been used to estimate planet composition in different galactic populations (Santos et al. 2017). However, there is no direct observational evidence for the aforementioned expectation/assumption and was even recently questioned by Plotnykov & Valencia (2020). By using the largest possible sample of precisely characterized low-mass planets and their host stars, we show that the composition of the planet building blocks indeed correlates with the properties of the rocky planets. We also find that on average the iron-mass fraction of planets is higher than that of the primordial values, owing to the disk-chemistry and planet formation processes. This result can bring important implications for the future modelling of exoplanet composition.\n\nThe TESS-Keck Survey: Building a Statistical Sample of Sub-Neptunes Primed for Atmospheric Characterization\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 21:15 UT / 17:15 ET\n\nJoseph Murphy (University of California, Santa Cruz)\n\nThe TESS-Keck Survey team members (UC Santa Cruz, UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Riverside, UC Irvine, University of Hawai'i, University of Kansas, California Institute of Technology)\n\nThe TESS-Keck Survey (TKS) is a large, multi-semester Doppler survey of promising planet candidates from NASAâs ongoing TESS mission. TKS is actively monitoring close to 100 TESS systems with Keck-HIRES in pursuit of key questions in exoplanet astronomy across four broad science themes: bulk planet composition, system architectures, evolved systems, and the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. Precise planet mass measurements (> 5-sigma) are the critical first step in the interpretation of transmission spectra of small planets, as most absorption features are proportional to the atmospheric scale height which depends on both mass (surface gravity) and composition (atmospheric mean molecular weight). One of the lasting contributions from TKS will be the precise masses of ~20 sub-Neptune-size planets spanning a range of radii, orbital periods, and host star properties. In this talk, we describe the TKS selection function for atmospheric targets and summarize the surveyâs preliminary results. One of the key insights from our observations is that sub-Neptunes orbiting G dwarfs have emerged as a promising population for basing a demographic study of exoplanet atmospheres with JWST.\n\nThe origin of the radius valley: insights from formation and evolution models\n\nschedule: Monday, 14:55 UT / 10:55 ET\n\nJulia Venturini (International Space Science Institute)\n\nOctavio Guilera (CONICET-UNLP), Jonas Haldemann (University of Bern), Paula Ronco (Universidad Catolica de Chile), Christoph Mordasini (University of Bern)\n\nThe existence of a radius valley in the Kepler size distribution, which separates super-Earths from mini-Neptunes, stands as one of the most important observational constraints to understand the origin and composition of exoplanets with radii between that of Earth and Neptune. We provide insights into the existence of the radius valley from, first, a pure formation point of view, and second, a combined formation-evolution model. Our simulations include the evolution of dust by coagulation, drift and fragmentation; and the evolution of the gaseous disc by viscous accretion and photoevaporation. A planet grows from a moon-mass embryo by either silicate or icy pebble accretion, depending on its position with respect to the water ice line. We include gas accretion, type-I/II migration and photoevaporation driven mass-loss after formation. We find that while the first peak of the Kepler size distribution is undoubtedly populated by bare rocky cores, the second peak tends to be composed by half-rock/half-water planets with thin or non-existent H-He atmospheres.\n\nPATHOS: Looking for candidate exoplanets in stellar clusters and young associations\n\nschedule: Wednesday, 20:35 UT / 16:35 ET\n\nNardiello Domenico (Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille)\n\nThe accurate knowledge of the ages of stars hosting planets allows us to obtain an overview on the evolution of exoplanets and understand the mechanisms affecting their life. The measurement of the ages of stars in the Galaxy is usually affected by large uncertainties; an exception are the stellar clusters: for their coeval members, born at the same time from the same molecular cloud, ages can be measured with extreme accuracy through the use of theoretical models. In this context, the aim of the project PATHOS is the finding and characterization of candidate exoplanets orbiting members in stellar clusters and associations by using TESS high-precision light curves obtained with appropriate cutting-edge tools. In this talk, the most important results obtained in the first two years of the PATHOS project will be presented: a particular attention will be dedicated to the frequency of candidate exoplanets around stellar clusters' members and to the relationship between stellar age and planetary radius. Also, important results regarding stellar variability in youthful associations (<10 Myr) obtained with TESS light curves will be illustrated.\n\nA Homogeneous Population of TESS Planets Orbiting Subgiant Stars\n\nschedule: Wednesday, 21:30 UT / 17:30 ET\n\nAshley Chontos (Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawai'i at MÄnoa)\n\nDaniel Huber, Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawai'i at MÄnoa\n\nThe subgiant branch is a rapid phase of stellar evolution, which allows the precise determination of fundamental properties of stars and the planets that orbit them. The unique age constraint in combination with the precise properties of a quickly-evolving system also makes this population of planets an ideal sample to test and constrain timescales for the dynamical evolution of planets. Here we present a homogeneous population of TESS planets orbiting subgiant stars that have been extensively followed up with Keck/HIRES. The sample comprises more than 20 TESS planets ranging from sub-Neptunes to gas giant planets, including new non-transiting planets, with precisely measured ages, densities and orbital properties. We use the sample to investigate dynamical timescales for processes such as orbital period decay, which is expected to occur faster than circularization, thus producing a transient population of mildly eccentric planets. With host star masses ranging from ~1-1.8 Msun, we also explore correlations of bulk planet properties with stellar mass and metallicity.\n\nPrecise Mass Measurements of TESS's M Dwarf Planets with MAROON-X\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 21:30 UT / 17:30 ET\n\nMadison Brady (University of Chicago)\n\nMAROON-X is a new spectrograph at the 8-meter Gemini North telescope, designed to perform extreme-precision (30 cm/s) radial velocity measurements of late-type stars. This precision allows us to observe the faint RV signatures of terrestrial planets. With MAROON-X, we have already been able to precisely measure the masses of the TESS-discovered Gl 486b and LTT 1445Ab, both of which are JWST Cycle 1 targets. We are currently using this exciting new instrument to perform a volume-limited (d < 30 pc) RV survey of TESS transiting planet candidates around M dwarfs. Here we will present a status update of this project, including new planetary masses measured over the past year.\n\nCondensate cloud modulation seen in multi-epoch IGRINS and contemporaneous TESS monitoring of ultracool dwarfs\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 14:35 UT / 10:35 ET\n\nMichael Gully-Santiago (The University of Texas at Austin)\n\nCaroline Morley (UT Austin), Will Best (UT Austin), Yifan Zhou (UT Austin), Brendan Bowler (UT Austin)\n\nCondensate clouds should pervade the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and exoplanets, dictating the energy balance of these substellar objects and controlling their photometric and spectroscopic properties. Yet physical understanding of these clouds has largely been limited to coarse phenomenology: clouds are difficult to model and even more difficult to observe, owing to the absence of prominent spectral features and the intrinsic low luminosity of ultracool LT dwarfs. Here we present high resolution near-IR echelle spectra from IGRINS taken contemporaneously with TESS Sector 36 to quantify brown dwarf cloud modulation of Luhman 16AB, an exemplar L-T transition binary residing 2 pc from the Sun. The Sector 10, 36, and 37 lightcurves show conspicuous 10% peak-to-valley modulations arising from longitudinal asymmetries of cloud coverage, with rich harmonics suggestive of surface structures. The four epochs of IGRINS spectra sample both high and low states of cloud coverage of the B component, exhibiting wide agreement with custom cloudy synthetic grid models. We animate conceivable dynamic surface structures consistent with these two precision datasets.\n\nExploring the TESS Objects of Interest (TOI) Catalog\n\nschedule: Monday, 14:00 UT / 10:00 ET\n\nNatalia Guerrero (MIT)\n\nWe present over 3,000 exoplanet candidates discovered in the first year of the extended mission and two-year prime mission of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We describe updates to the process used to identify TOIs, investigate the characteristics of the new planet candidates, and highlight some notable TESS discoveries. The TESS Objects of Interest (TOI) Catalog includes both new planet candidates found by TESS and previously-known planets recovered by TESS observations. Nearly 200 TOIs are part of multi-planet systems and hundreds of TOIs are small planet candidates around nearby bright stars. TOIs provide a diverse set of system architectures and planet parameters well-suited for detailed follow-up observations.\n\nEvolution of the Hot Neptunian Desert With TESS\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 14:50 UT / 10:50 ET\n\nKatharine Hesse (MIT)\n\nMichelle Kunimoto (MIT), Ismael Mireles (University of New Mexico), Natalia Guerrero (MIT)\n\nThe hot Neptunian desert refers to the lack of Neptune-sized planets (~2 Re < Rp < ~9 Re) orbiting close to their stars (P < ~5 days) typically expected in exoplanet populations. This scarcity was predicted by population synthesis models due to the inability of gas giants below Jupiter size to hold onto volatile materials in close proximity to their stars but was unsupported by radial velocity surveys. However, the exoplanet distribution from Kepler does support the existence of this desert, with less than ten percent of confirmed planets and planet candidates falling into this radius and period range. A similar disparity exists in TESS with less than fifteen percent of planet candidates located in this short period Neptune range, although there are already a few TESS confirmed planets that fit the hot Neptune profile such as LTT 9779 b. As more candidates are found and confirmed, TESS will continue to populate the Hot Neptune Desert and help explain the formation and evolution of these objects.\n\nPlanet Hunters TESS: findings from the first 2.5 years of people-powered planet hunting in TESS data\n\nschedule: Monday, 15:10 UT / 11:10 ET\n\nNora Eisner (University of Oxford)\n\nOscar Barragan (University of Oxford), Suzanne Aigrain (University of Oxford), Chris Lintott (University of Oxford), Belinda Nicholson (University of Oxford) & the Zooniverse team\n\nI will present results from the Planet Hunters TESS (PHT) project, which harnesses the power of citizen science to find transit events in the TESS data by engaging tens of thousands of volunteers. To date, PHT citizen scientists have classified all two-minute cadence TESS data up to sector 35 and discovered over 100 planet candidates that weren't previously known. Most are long-period planets, but we also identify a wide range of other interesting planet and stellar systems. Our results show that humans can outperform the automated detection pipelines for certain types of transits, especially single (long-period) transits, as well as aperiodic transits (circumbinary planets) and planets around rapidly rotating, active (young systems), or otherwise variable stars. I will give an overview of our detection and vetting process, and show how our findings complement the population of planets identified by automated algorithms. Finally, I will present our most recent discovery, a system of two planets around the bright star HD 152843, which has outstanding prospects for atmospheric characterisation.\n\nMass measurement in the LHS3844 using ESPRESSO\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 20:45 UT / 16:45 ET\n\nRodrigo DÃ­az (Universidad de San MartÃ­n / ICAS)\n\nNicola Astudillo-Defru (Universidad CatÃ³lica de la SantÃ­sima ConcepciÃ³n, Chile) Xavier Bonfils (UniversitÃ© Grenoble Alpes, France) Jose-Manuel Almenara (UniversitÃ© Grenoble Alpes, France) Xavier Delfosse (UniversitÃ© Grenoble Alpes, France) Thierry Forveille (UniversitÃ© Grenoble Alpes, France) Paula Gorrini (Universidad de ConcepciÃ³n, Chile) Ronald Mennickent (Universidad de ConcepciÃ³n, Chile) Nicolas Unger (University of Geneva, Switzerland) Stephane Udry (University of Geneva, Switzerland) and the ExTrA team\n\nThe planet LHS 3844 b is an ultra short-period (USP) Earth-size planet orbiting a nearby (15 pc) M dwarf. Because of the brightness of the host star (Kmag = 9.1), the planet has raised a lot of attention. The lack of a thick atmosphere has already been determined using phase curves obtained from space, and the planet is scheduled to be observed during Cycle 1 of the James Webb Space Telescope. A complete characterisation of this planet, in particular the measurement of its mass, and the detection of additional planets in the system are important steps in understanding the formation and evolution of this target. They will also help in interpreting the future observations obtained from space. Here, we report the analysis of radial velocities of LHS 3844 measured by the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. The data allow us to determine the mass of the USP planet with a precision of around 10%, and shed light on the presence of additional companions. We present the details of the velocity analysis and announce the mass and density of the USP planet as well as the results of the Bayesian model comparison between models with different numbers of periodic signals.\n\nHunting for TESS planets around solar twins\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 21:45 UT / 17:45 ET\n\nTianjun Gan (Tsinghua University)\n\nMegan Bedell (Flatiron Institute), Sharon Xuesong Wang (Tsinghua University), Shude Mao (Tsinghua University), Karen Collins (Harvard & Smithsonian), Avi Shporer (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)\n\nThe Sun has been previously found to have a depletion in refractory elements compared to the volatile elements with respect to most nearby solar analogs. Previous studies show that this deficiency feature could be linked to the rocky body and giant planet formation, galactic chemical evolution as well as planet engulfment. However, it is still unclear which is the dominant reason due to the lack of well-characterized solar twins with known planets around. As a whole sky survey, TESS presents an exciting opportunity to build a sample to further study the solar depletion pattern. In this presentation, I will report the recent detection of a warm sub-Neptune around the solar twin HD 183579. The spectroscopic abundance analysis shows that HD 183579 does not show depletion of refractory elements as our Sun, despite both having rocky bodies. By studying the solar analogs hosting confirmed rocky planets in the California-Kepler Survey (CKS) sample, we also find a similar conclusion. It hints that rocky body formation may not be the key reason to the depletion feature we saw in our Sun. I will briefly overview the aforementioned four hypotheses and summarize of our new findings.\n\nTOI-1789 b: An inflated hot Jupiter around a late F type star\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 21:00 UT / 17:00 ET\n\nAkanksha Khandelwal (Physical Research Laboratory, India)\n\nAkanksha Khandelwal, PRL, India Priyanka Chaturvedi, TLS, Tautenburg, Germany Abhijit Chakraborty, PRL, India Rishikesh Sharma, PRL, India\n\nBased on precise radial velocities (RVs) from the two spectrographs, PARAS at PRL, India, and TCES, Tautenburg, Germany, we report the detection of a hot Jupiter at an orbital period of 3.2087 days around TOI-1789 (TIC ID 172518755). TOI-1789 is a 9.1 TESS magnitude F-type star with an effective temperature of about 6000 K. The mass measured for TOI-1789b from the radial velocity semi-amplitude of 77Â±18 m/s is 0.76Â±0.17 MJ. We compliment the space-based TESS data with several ground-based transit observations using PRLâs 43-cm telescope in the R-band at the Gurushikhar Observatory. With the simultaneous fitting of the multiple light curves and the RV data, we measure the planet radius of 1.40^+0.14_â0.11 RJ and a density of 0.34^+0.13_â0.11 g/cm3. This puts TOI-1789b in the category of inflated hot Jupiters, which makes it a suitable candidate for atmospheric studies via transmission spectroscopy, an important addition in improving our understanding of studying inflation mechanisms in hot Jupiters.\n\nA pre-main-sequence star that's chemically peculiar due to its planet-forming disk\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 13:40 UT / 09:40 ET\n\nSimon J. Murphy (University of Sydney)\n\nMeridith Joyce (ANU, Australia) Tim Bedding (USyd, Australia) Tim White (USyd, Australia) Mihkel Kama (UCL, UK)\n\nThe early evolution of a star is intertwined with that of its planets and protoplanetary disk. Recent results reveal that some stellar chemical peculiarities arise from separation of dust from gas in planet-forming disks. Thus stellar composition build-up is linked to planet formation and disk evolution, but many aspects of this remain unclear. Disk evolution is thought to be rapid (3â5 Myr timescales), but age estimates have previously relied upon the ages of stellar associations, which can be unreliable because of age dispersion within associations and episodic accretion. Hence, the ages and intrinsic metallicities of protoplanetary disks are rarely known precisely.\n\nI will discuss recent results for the pre-main-sequence star HD139614, where we use stellar pulsations to determine an age to better than 10% precision. I will describe the evolution of pulsation frequencies in pre-main-sequence stars and how this allows masses and metallicities to be determined in a degeneracy-free way, permitting stellar associations to be dated with much better precision. Finally, I will explain how a planet-forming disk has resulted in this star being chemically peculiar.\n\nTESS reveals gravity waves as a plausible mechanism for macroturbulence in massive stars\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 13:25 UT / 09:25 ET\n\nDominic M. Bowman (Institute of Astronomy, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200D, 3001 Leuven, Belgium)\n\nSiemen Burssens (Institute of Astronomy, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200D, 3001 Leuven, Belgium) Sergio SimÃ³n-DÃ­az (Instituto de AstrofÃ­sica de Canarias, 38200 La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain)\n\nMost massive stars end their lives as energetic supernovae and form a black hole or neutron star, which are strong drivers of galactic evolution. However the interior physics of massive stars, such as mixing and rotation, is not well known even during the main sequence phase of stellar evolution. Asteroseismology of gravity waves provides a unique way of probing beneath a star's opaque surface. Massive stars exhibit gravity waves excited from core convection and turbulent pressure fluctuations in their near-surface layers, which in turn produce an efficient mixing mechanism inside stars. Here we present the recent results on combining high-precision TESS photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy of massive stars. A clear relationship is found between the location of massive stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and the amplitudes and frequencies of stochastic photometric variability caused by gravity waves in their light curves. The common variability discovered in TESS photometry is strong evidence for gravity waves being a plausible mechanism for macroturbulence in massive stars, as gravity waves are unique in providing the dominant tangential velocity field required to explain macroturbulence.\n\nA 20-second Cadence View of Solar Type Stars and Their Planets with TESS\n\nschedule: Friday, 20:10 UT / 16:10 ET\n\nDaniel Huber (University of Hawaii)\n\nTim White (University of Sydney), Travis Metcalfe (White Dwarf Research Corporation), Ashley Chontos (University of Hawaii), Cynthia Ho (University College London), Vincent Van Eylen (University College London) and TASC Workings Groups 1 & 2\n\nI will present a systematic analysis of the first 20-second cadence light curves obtained by the TESS extended mission. The data show a strong magnitude-dependent increase in photometric precision compared to 2-minute cadence data, and I will discuss two early science results enabled by this improvement. First, we use asteroseismology of bright solar analogs to find evidence that the spread in the stellar age-activity relation is linked to stellar mass and thus convection zone depth. Second, we combine 20-second data and radial velocities to re-characterize pi Men c, which is now the closest transiting exoplanet for which a detailed asteroseismic characterization of the host star is possible. The results show that pi Men c sits at the upper edge of the planet radius valley for its orbital period, confirming that it has likely retained a volatile atmosphere and that the \"asteroseismic radius valley\" remains devoid of planets. Our analysis also strongly favors a circular orbit for pi Men c, suggesting efficient tidal dissipation if it formed via high-eccentricity migration. Combined, the early results demonstrate the extraordinary potential of TESS 20-second cadence data for stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science.\n\nA 'Quick Look' at All-Sky Galactic Archeology with TESS: 130,000 Oscillating Red Giants from the MIT Quick-Look Pipeline\n\nschedule: Wednesday, 21:00 UT / 17:00 ET\n\nMarc Hon (University of Hawai'i)\n\nDaniel Huber (University of Hawai`i) James S. Kuszlewicz (UniversitÃ¤t Heidelberg) Dennis Stello (UNSW Sydney) Jamie Tayar (University of Hawai`i) Joel C. Zinn (American Museum of Natural History) Mathieu Vrard (The Ohio State University) Marc H. Pinsonneault (The Ohio State University)\n\nWe present the first near all-sky yield of oscillating red giants from the TESS's prime mission. We systematically detect 129,323 oscillating giants across all light curves in the MIT Quick-Look Pipeline's first data release, which is interpreted as the an approximate lower bound to the possible total yield of oscillating giants from the first two years of TESS. By combining our seismic measurements with Gaia parallaxes, we present an unprecedented near all-sky Gaia-asteroseismology mass map. Moreover, we examine the spatial, kinematic, and chemical properties of our red giant sample to demonstrate the strong potential of TESS asteroseismology for studies of the Galaxy even with only one month of observations.\n\nHD 265435: a new candidate supernova progenitor in TESS\n\nschedule: Wednesday, 13:15 UT / 09:15 ET\n\nIngrid Pelisoli (University of Warwick)\n\nP. Neunteufel (MPA-Garching), S. Geier (University of Potsdam), T. Kupfer (Texas Tech University), U. Heber (University of Bamberg), A. Irrgang (University of Bamberg), D. Schneider (University of Bamberg), A. Bastian (University of Potsdam), J. van Roestel (Caltech), V. Schaffenroth (University of Potsdam), B. N. Barlow (High Point University)\n\nSupernova Ia are bright explosive events that can be used to estimate cosmological distances, allowing us to study the expansion of the Universe. They are understood to result from a thermonuclear detonation in a white dwarf that formed from the exhausted core of a star more massive than the Sun. However, the possible progenitor channels leading to an explosion are a long-standing debate, limiting the precision and accuracy of supernova Ia as distance indicators. In this talk, we will present HD 265435, a binary system discovered by TESS with an orbital period of less than a hundred minutes, consisting of a white dwarf and a hot subdwarf â a stripped core-helium burning star. The total mass of the system is 1.65Â±0.25 solar-masses, exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit. The system will merge due to gravitational wave emission in 70 million years, likely triggering a supernova Ia event. We used this detection to place constraints on the contribution of hot subdwarf-white dwarf binaries to supernova Ia progenitors.\n\nProspects for Galactic and Stellar Astrophysics in the TESS-CVZ and beyond\n\nschedule: Wednesday, 21:15 UT / 17:15 ET\n\nTed Mackereth (University of Toronto)\n\nAndrea Miglio (University of Bologna), Yvonne Elsworth (University of Birmingham), Benoit Mosser (Observatoire de Paris), Savita Mathur (IAC, Tenerife), Rafael Garcia (University Paris-Saclay), Domenico Nardiello (INAF, Padova)\n\nThe advent of space-based long-duration photometry of stars has brought about a revolution in our constraints on models of stellar structure and evolution. Not only that, but it has triggered a new era of high precision stellar parameter estimation, affording mass and, therefore, age estimates for large numbers of giant stars, whose ages have long been difficult to pin down, but are readily observable over large regions of the Milky Way. In this talk, I will present a new catalogue of ~5,500 red giants in the southern TESS-CVZ, whose seismic parameters, measured from TESS light curves have afforded high quality mass and age estimates. I will show how the TESS data, in combination with constraints from Gaia and other spectra-photometric data, allows relatively precise seismic measurements albeit with shorter duration and noisier data than Kepler. I will show that even at reduced precision in age, a large all-sky TESS data-set, informed by this more detailed data in the TESS-CVZ, will be able to provide important constraints on the stellar populations of the Milky Way.\n\nHelium Abundances from Subgiant Ensemble Asteroseismology\n\nschedule: Friday, 20:50 UT / 16:50 ET\n\nJ M Joel Ong (Yale University)\n\nM. Lund (Aarhus) Sarbani Basu (Yale) K. Stassun (Vanderbilt) J. Tayar (Hawaiâi) M. YÄ±ldÄ±z (Ä°zmir) Z. C. Orhan (Ä°zmir) S. Ãrtel (Ä°zmir) H. M. Antia (TIFR) T. Appourchaux (Paris-Sud) E. Corsaro (INAF) G. Davies (Birmingham) N. ThemeÃl (MPSS) D. Huber (Hawaiâi)\n\nStellar helium abundances strongly determine their structure and evolution. However, since helium cannot be detected directly in the photospheres of most stars, helium abundances are one of the most poorly-constrained inputs to stellar models. It is therefore typical to assume a relationship with the initial abundances of other heavy elements, typically of linear form described by a gradient ÎY/ÎZ. No observational consensus exists regarding empirically reasonable values of ÎY/ÎZ, or, for that matter, even whether such a linear relation is observationally justifiable. Separately, asteroseismology has proven to be an excellent tool with which to study the structure of stars. In particular, asteroseismology permits the inference of stellar helium abundances, either directly through acoustic-glitch measurements, or indirectly through the forward modelling of stellar oscillation mode frequencies. Using constraints on the initial helium abundance derived from ensemble asteroseismology and stellar forward modelling against individual mode frequencies of a collection of field stars in the TESS, Kepler, and K2 fields, we characterise the helium-metallicity relation of the brightest stars in the solar neighbourhood.\n\nActivity of TRAPPIST-1 analog stars with TESS\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 15:20 UT / 11:20 ET\n\nBÃ¡lint Seli (Konkoly Observatory)\n\nKrisztiÃ¡n Vida (Konkoly Observatory), Attila MoÃ³r (Konkoly Observatory), AndrÃ¡s PÃ¡l (Konkoly Observatory), Katalin OlÃ¡h (Konkoly Observatory)\n\nWe present an analysis of TRAPPIST-1 like ultracool dwarfs with TESS full-frame image photometry, in order to constrain their average magnetic activity properties. The sample includes stars close to TRAPPIST-1 on the Gaia color-magnitude diagram, up to 50 pc. 248 of these objects have been observed during the first two years of the TESS primary mission, we used their light curves to search for flares and rotational modulation. The ages of 88 stars were estimated using kinematic information, but there seems to be no strong correlation with rotational period. The composite flare frequency distribution shows a power-law index similar to TRAPPIST-1, and it is extended to higher energies. The results imply that while superflares can be expected every few decades, the flare rate of such stars is insufficient to fully destroy the possible ozone layer of orbiting planets.\n\nAge-Dating Red Giant Stars Associated with Galactic Disk and Halo Substructures\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 14:10 UT / 10:10 ET\n\nSamuel Grunblatt (American Museum of Natural History/Center for Computational Astrophysics)\n\nSamuel Grunblatt (AMNH/CCA), Joel C. Zinn (AMNH), Adrian Price-Whelan (CCA), Ruth Angus (AMNH/CCA), Nicholas Saunders (Hawaii), Marc Hon (Hawaii), Amalie Stokholm (Aarhus), Earl P. Bellinger (Aarhus), Sarah Martell (UNSW), Benoit Mosser (LESIA Paris), Emily Cunningham (CCA), Jamie Tayar (Hawaii), Daniel Huber (Hawaii), Jakob Lysgaard Rorsted (Aarhus), Victor Silva Aguirre (Aarhus)\n\nThe vast majority of Milky Way stellar halo stars were likely accreted from a small number of relatively large accretion events. However, the timing of these events is poorly constrained, relying on indirect dynamical mixing arguments or imprecise age measurements of stars associated with debris structures. Here, we aim to infer robust stellar ages for stars associated with galactic substructures to more directly constrain the merger history of the Galaxy. By combining kinematic and spectroscopic data with asteroseismology of TESS light curves, we infer stellar ages for a sample of 10 red giant stars that were kinematically selected to be associated with the stellar halo, a subset of which are associated with the Gaia-Enceladus halo substructure, and compare their ages to 3 red giant stars in the Galactic disk. We determine hierarchical ages for the populations of Gaia-Enceladus, halo and disk stars, finding a Gaia-Enceladus population age of 8 +/- 3 Gyr. This framework should allow distinct characterization of Galactic substructures using larger stellar samples and additional TESS data available in the near future.\n\nTesting substellar evolutionary models with transiting brown dwarfs from TESS\n\nschedule: Friday, 21:05 UT / 17:05 ET\n\nTheron Carmichael (Harvard University)\n\nDavid Latham (Center for Astrophysics), Jonathan Irwin (Center for Astrophysics), George Zhou (Center for Astrophysics), Karen Collins (Center for Astrophysics), and the TESS Follow-up Observing Program Working Group\n\nThis talk presents an analysis of transiting brown dwarf (BD) systems and examines their effectiveness as tests to substellar evolutionary models. The radius, mass, and age of transiting BD systems are the parameters most useful in testing these models and in this work, I show how my collaborators and I have used the TESS mission, the TRES spectrograph (and other spectroscopic follow up), and the Gaia mission in tandem to detect and characterize 14 new transiting BD systems with precise radius, mass, and age determinations (in most cases). One system has an age estimate from gyrochronology, which we use to constrain the youth of one transiting BD, TOI-811b, to less than 200 Myr. In addition, I apply parallax measurements from Gaia DR2 to improve the radius determinations of 10 transiting BD systems published prior to Gaia DR2 and the launch of the TESS mission. This work has significantly improved the radius determinations of 7 previously known transiting BDs, including CoRoT-15b and AD 3116b, whose radius uncertainties have been improved from 15% to 5-7%, making them much more effective for testing substellar evolutionary models.\n\nThe Disconnect between UV and White-Light Flares in Low-Mass Stars\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 14:35 UT / 10:35 ET\n\nJames A. G. Jackman (Arizona State University)\n\nEvgenya Shkolnik (ASU), Chase Million (Million Concepts), Scott Fleming (STScI)\n\nStellar flares are explosive phenomena that release radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. The far-UV emission from flares can dissociate atmospheric species and exacerbate atmospheric erosion. Yet, the near-UV flux may be necessary for the emergence of life on rocky planets around low-mass stars such as TRAPPIST-1. A detailed knowledge of the UV energies and rates of flares is therefore essential for our understanding of the habitability of M dwarf systems. However, measurements of UV flare rates require expensive campaigns with HST, meaning habitability studies instead often use UV rates based on extrapolations from white-light studies with TESS. Despite their use in contemporary habitability studies, such extrapolations are untested and their accuracy remains unconstrained. To this end, we have combined TESS white-light and archival GALEX UV photometry for M dwarfs from TESS cycles 1 to 3 to test the UV predictions of habitability studies. We will show how white-light flare studies underestimate the UV rates of flares, how to correct for this effect, and the impact our results have on our current understanding of the UV environments of exoplanets around M dwarfs.\n\nRotation Rates of Nearby 10 - 700 Myr Moving Groups with TESS\n\nschedule: Friday, 21:20 UT / 17:20 ET\n\nMark Popinchalk (CUNY/AMNH)\n\nJacqueline Faherty (AMNH), Jason Curtis (Columbia), Daniella Bardalez-Gagliuffi (AMNH), Johanna Vos (AMNH), Lisseth Gonzales (AMNH), Andrew Ayala (AMNH)\n\nThe local volume around the Sun is a laboratory for studying all aspects of star and planet formation. This is especially true regarding co-moving, co-evolving young associations. Since the release of Gaia DR2 and now Gaia eDR3, there have been a multitude of papers examining new coherent structures of stars near the Sun which allow us to establish precise ages. TESS has enabled us to inspect these ages using gyrochronology while concurrently reinvestigating the membership of certain objects with kinematics supplemented by rotation rates. We have measured rotation periods for hundreds of objects across 26 different associations with ages ranging from 10 Myr to 700 Myr. We used TESS FFI light curves as they yield reasonable rotation rates even when extracted from the raw data. We used a carefully vetted list of bonafide, candidate and potential members of new and known associations using full kinematics, Bayesian probability and radial velocities where possible. In this talk we will present our preliminary results of the color-period plots for several associations that demonstrate intriguing structure across mass and age which is likely linked to the physical evolution of stars across the main sequence.\n\nOn the Origin of Stochastic, Low-Frequency Photometric Variability in Massive Stars\n\nschedule: Friday, 20:25 UT / 16:25 ET\n\nMatteo Cantiello (CCA & Princeton)\n\nMatteo Cantiello (CCA & Princeton), Daniel Lecoanet (Northwestern), Adam S. Jermyn (CCA), Luca Grassitelli (Bonn)\n\nTESS observations have revealed a new type of variability: stochastic low-frequency photometric variability (SLF). This type of variability is ubiquitous in early type stars. It has been suggested that SLF arises due to either subsurface convection or internal gravity waves launched by the convective core. Here we show that relevant properties of convection in subsurface convective layers correlate very well with the timescale and amplitude of stochastic low-frequency photometric variability, as well as with the amplitude of macroturbulence. We suggest that SLF and surface turbulence in massive stars are caused by the the presence of subsurface convection. We show that an explanation for the observed surface photometric variability and macroturbulence relying on convective core driven internal gravity waves encounters a number of difficulties, and seems unlikely to be able to explain the observed trends.\n\nEvidence for Centrifugal Breakout around the Young M Dwarf TIC 234284556\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 14:50 UT / 10:50 ET\n\nElsa Katarina Palumbo (Caltech)\n\nBenjamin T. Montet (University of New South Wales), Adina D. Feinstein (University of Chicago), Luke Bouma (Princeton University), Joel Hartman (Princeton University), Lynne Hillenbrand (California Institute of Technology), Michael Gully-Santiago (University of Texas at Austin)\n\nMagnetospheric clouds, plasma that accumulates in dense clumps at a star's corrotation radius, have been proposed as an explanation for variable dips in the light curves of young stars such as Ï Ori E and RIK-210. However, the stellar theory that first predicted magnetospheric clouds also anticipated centrifugal breakout, an associated mass-loss mechanism for which there has been limited empirical evidence. Based on data from TESS, Gaia, LCO, ASAS-SN, and Veloce, we propose that the 45-million-year-old M 3.5 star TIC 234284556 is a candidate for a direct detection of centrifugal breakout. To assess this hypothesis, we examine changes in the dip parameters over three sectors of TESS data, analyze optical flaring as a proxy for magnetic activity, and interpret the presence of an anomalous brightening event that precedes the disappearance of the dip. We argue that TIC 234284556 and previously identified ``flux-dip\" stars together give us compelling evidence that centrifugal breakout is an important mass-loss mechanism. Finally, we consider possible mass-accumulation mechanisms and discuss how future observations may help us constrain M dwarfsâ wind mass loss rates or give us valuable data about extra-solar CMEs.\n\nTESS photometry of 'creme de la creme' of Eclipsing Binaries\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 13:55 UT / 09:55 ET\n\nKrzysztof HeÅminiak (NCAC ToruÅ)\n\nSince 2011 we have been conducting an extensive spectroscopic survey (CREME) of detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), and obtaining precise radial velocity (RV) data for hundreds of DEBs. The main goal was to identify and properly characterize new cases of poorly-studied or astrophysically interesting stars (e.g. low mass dwarfs, PMS, giants, pulsators, multiples, etc...). For most of them (currently ~200) we also gathered 2-minute cadence time series photometry from TESS through GI programs. Thanks to the superb data sets we are able to derive the values of fundamental stellar parameters (e.g. absolute masses, radii, temperatures) with a very high relative precision of 0.2-2%. To date we have identified for example ~40 DEBs with low-mass stars, 15 with (sub)giants, ~10 with pulsators of various kinds, ~80 multiples, or 5 with PMS components, as well as a number of exoplanet and BD candidates associated with eclipsing binaries.\n\nCombining TESS Asteroseismology and LBT Spectropolarimetry of the Exoplanet Host Star rho CrB\n\nschedule: Wednesday, 21:45 UT / 17:45 ET\n\nTravis Metcalfe (White Dwarf Research Corp.)\n\nJennifer van Saders (U.Hawaii) TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium (TASC)\n\nDuring the first half of main-sequence lifetimes, the evolution of rotation and magnetic activity in solar-type stars appears to be strongly coupled. Recent observations suggest that rotation rates evolve much more slowly beyond middle-age, while stellar activity continues to decline. One hypothesis to explain this decoupling is a shift in magnetic morphology from predominantly larger to smaller spatial scales. This hypothesis was recently tested with LBT spectropolarimetric measurements of the exoplanet host star rho CrB. We combine these observations with TESS asteroseismology to place new constraints on the evolution of magnetic morphology beyond middle-age. We then attempt to match these constraints with rotational evolution models, assuming either standard spin-down or weakened magnetic braking. We conclude that the asteroseismic age of rho CrB is consistent with the expected evolution of its mean activity level, and that weakened braking models can more readily explain its relatively fast rotation rate.\n\nThe search for nearby self-lensing black holes in the TESS primary mission\n\nschedule: Wednesday, 21:30 UT / 17:30 ET\n\nTansu (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)\n\nA large number of non-interacting black holes are expected to exist close to the solar system that have so far evaded detection in X-rays. Black holes with stellar companions aligned edge-on yield light curves with a rich set of features including periodic brightening induced by microlensing in addition to phase modulations due to relativistic effects and tidal distortions. The former self-lensing signature is a unique and compelling evidence of compactness and can yield a precise (percent level) mass measurement for the lensing black hole with broad implications for probing the black hole mass gap. I present the results of a comprehensive search for close-in, detached black holes using the TESS primary mission data. Using injection-recovery tests, I discuss the selection function of the search pipeline by characterizing its recall and precision. Resulting constraints on the occurrence rate start probing the common-envelope formation mechanism of black holes with stellar companions. A future confirmed detection will likely yield the black hole closest to the solar system, acting as a prototype for subsequent population studies that will complement gravitational waves and Gaia astrometry as probes of the black hole mass function.\n\nDetection of filament eruption from a superflares on a solar-type star\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 15:05 UT / 11:05 ET\n\nKosuke Namekata (National Astronomical Observatory of Japan)\n\nKosuke Namekata (1,2), Hiroyuki Maehara (2), Satoshi Honda (3), Yuta Notsu (4,5,6), Soshi Okamoto (1), Jun Takahashi (3), Masaki Takayama (3), Tomohito Ohshima (3), Tomoki Saito (3), Noriyuki Katoh (3), Miyako Tozuka (3), Katsuhiro L. Murata (6), Futa Ogawa (6), Masafumi Niwano (6), Ryo Adachi (6), Motoki Oeda (6), Kazuki Shiraishi (6), Keisuke Isogai (1), Daikichi Seki (1), Takako T. Ishii (1), Kiyoshi Ichimoto (1), Daisaku Nogami (1), Kazunari Shibata (1) (1)Kyoto University, (2)NAOJ, (3) University of Hyogo, (4) University of Colorado Boulder, (5) National Solar Observatory, (6) Tokyo Institute of Technology\n\nSolar flares are often accompanied by filament/prominence eruptions, sometimes leading to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that directly affect the Earth's environment. `Superflares' are found on some active solar-type stars, but the association of filament eruptions/CMEs is unknown. We report the first optical spectroscopic observation of superflares on solar-type star EK Dra with the Seimei telescope. The existence of H$Â¥alpha$ emission was confirmed by the simultaneous TESS white-light superflare. The observation shows the first evidence for a stellar filament eruption associated with a superflare on the solar-type star. After the superflare brightenings with the radiated energy of 2.0Ã10^{33}Â erg observed by TESS, a blue-shifted H-alpha absorption component with a velocity of -510 km s^{-1}Â appeared. The velocity gradually decayed in 2 hour with the surface gravity on EK Dra. We found that the temporal changes in the spectra of EK Dra greatly resemble that of the-Sun-as-a-star solar filament eruption. Moreover, the stellar filament mass ofã$1.1Â¥times10^{18}$ g is 10 times larger than that of the largest solar CMEs.ãThe filament eruption and a possible CME can greatly affect the planetary environment and stellar mass evolution.\n\nGalactic Kinematics and Flare Rates of a Volume-Complete Sample of Mid-to-Late M dwarfs\n\nschedule: Friday, 21:35 UT / 17:35 ET\n\nAmber Medina (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)\n\nJennifer Winters (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) Jonathan Irwin (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) David Charbonneau (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)\n\nWe present a study of the galactic kinematics, flare rates, chromospheric magnetic activity and rotation periods for an all-sky sample of 219 single stars within 15 parsecs and with masses between 0.1â0.3 Mâ observed during the TESS primary mission. From multi-epoch high-resolution spectroscopy, we measure the equivalent widths of various activity indicators, and we determine the stellar radial velocity which, when combined with Gaia astrometry, permits us to determine the galactic UVW space motions. The fraction of active stars increases with decreasing stellar mass from 26% at 0.25 Mâ to 44% at 0.17 Mâ. We find that stars with saturated flare rates have Rossby numbers less than 0.5 and belong to a kinetically cold population with ages less than 2 Gyr. The remaining stars have extremely low flare rates, long rotation periods, and kinematic ages in excess of 6 Gyr. We estimate the age at which stars transition from the rapidly flaring regime to the inactive one. This constraint on the history of the stellar radiation environment for the terrestrial planets known to orbit these stars will be important for interpreting planned JWST observations of their atmospheres.\n\nObserving the Brightest Stars with TESS\n\nschedule: Thursday, 19:45 UT / 15:45 ET\n\nTim White (University of Sydney)\n\nBenjamin Pope (University of Queensland)\n\nTESS is providing a wonderful opportunity to observe the brightest stars in the sky, stars that often have a long and rich history of observation. However the brightness of such stars present unique challenges, with saturation of the TESS cameras leading to long bleed columns that may bleed off the edge of the CCD. Not only does this result in aperture losses when doing simple aperture photometry, but it can also cause over-subtracted smear corrections because of an excess of charge in the smear rows. This affects not only these bright stars, but any star along the same CCD column. I will present our tools for overcoming these issues, and introduce our new open-source software package, mundey, which recalibrates TESS target pixel files and fixes anomalous smear corrections. I will demonstrate the efficacy of these tools by presenting TESS light curves of some of the brightest and well-known stars in the sky, including Sirius, Procyon, Canopus, and Polaris.\n\nOn the physical interpretation of quasi-periodic Gaussian Process models for stellar activity\n\nschedule: Thursday, 14:05 UT / 10:05 ET\n\nBelinda Nicholson (University of Oxford)\n\nSuzanne Aigrain (University of Oxford)\n\nQuasi-periodic (QP) Gaussian Process (GP) models are increasingly popular to model stellar activity signals in light curves and radial velocity (RV) time-series, owing to their ease of use and flexibility. In this study we simulations of rotating stars with evolving star-spots to investigate the extent to which the hyper-parameters of the most popular QP GP kernel are related to the physical parameters of the spots, in particular rotation period and spot life-time. We also compare GP hyper-parameters obtained by fitting a) simulated space-based light curves (from e.g. Kepler, TESS or PLATO), RV time-series with regular sampling, and RV time-series with more realistic, ground-based time-sampling. Insights from this exercise can help in the planning and analysis of RV follow-up of transiting planets discovered by TESS.\n\nDisentangling Blended Variable Stars in TESS Photometry\n\nschedule: Thursday, 19:30 UT / 15:30 ET\n\nMichael Higgins (Duke University)\n\nKeaton Bell - NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Washington\n\nWith a plate scale of 21\"/pixel, essentially every TESS light curve is a blend of multiple, potentially variable stars. Blended light from nearby stars introduce complications in the analysis of TESS photometry. These complications can be difficult to identify by inspection, and can lead to the potential misattribution of variability to the wrong source. Here we present an open source software tool that streamlines the process of disentangling blended variable stars in TESS photometry. Given a list of measured frequencies of sinusoidal variability, we fit the location in the time series pixel data where the signal-to-noise ratio is distributed as the TESS's pixel response function. This process outputs a sky location of the signals with uncertainties, along with the relative probabilities of these signals originating from Gaia sources within the Target Pixel File.\n\nA TESS View of Ambiguous Nuclear Transients\n\nschedule: Monday, 20:10 UT / 16:10 ET\n\nJason T. Hinkle (University of Hawaii)\n\nBenjamin J. Shappee (University of Hawaii), Patrick J. Vallely (Ohio State University), Michael M. Fasnaugh (MIT), Thomas W. -S Holoien (Carnegie Observatories), Katie Auchettl (University of Melbourne), Krzysztof Z. Stanek (Ohio State University), and Christopher S. Kochanek (Ohio State University)\n\nThe growth of ground-based transient surveys has driven the discovery of an increasing number of ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs). Properties of such sources impede their identification as members of a known class, like tidal disruption events (when a star gets ripped apart by a black hole), AGN (actively accreting supermassive black holes), or supernovae. Thus, ANTs represent a unique opportunity to probe the full range of behaviors occurring in galactic centers. In particular, the fast cadence and high photometric precision of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) allows for detailed studies of the variability properties of ANTs. Here, I discuss two ANTs discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN), each with multiple sectors of TESS data. The first, ASASSN-18el has been interpreted as a changing-look AGN, although the associated physical mechanism is unclear. The second, ASASSN-20hx paradoxically represents one of the most obvious ANTs to date. Using TESS data, I will provide constraints on pre-existing nuclear activity and measure flare rise/decline slopes. Finally, I will place these events in the context of known nuclear transient phenomena to establish a sample of well-studied ANTs.\n\nDouble, double toil and trouble: TESS captures two flares from ASASSN-14ko\n\nschedule: Monday, 20:25 UT / 16:25 ET\n\nAnna Payne (Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii)\n\nBenjamin Shappee (Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii), Katie Auchettl (University of Melbourne), Padi Boyd (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center), Michael Fausnaugh (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Jason Hinkle (Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii), Thomas Holoien (Carnegie Observatories), Mark Huber (Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii), Christopher Kochanek (The Ohio State University), Jack Neustadt (The Ohio State University), K.Z. Stanek (The Ohio State University), Todd Thompson (The Ohio State University), Michael Tucker (Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii), Patrick Vallely (The Ohio State University)\n\nASASSN-14ko is a periodically flaring transient at the center of the AGN ESO 253-G003 with a slowly decreasing period. ASASSN-14ko is incredibly unique compared to other nuclear transients: the flares recur frequently ~3 times per year over the last 7 years, with signatures present over X-ray, UV, and optical wavelengths. TESS observed this galaxy at exactly the right time to capture two separate flares during Sectors 4-6 and Sectors 31-33, providing the most detailed look of ASASSN-14ko's optical flare evolution. The TESS data were crucial for precisely constraining the outbursts' rise and decline and their model fits. Furthermore, TESS allowed for well-constrained timing of the two peaks which provided anchors on the timing model to accurately predict future flares. The photometric precision and high cadence of TESS allowed us to detect the differences between the two flares in the optical, revealing concretely for the first time that not all flares in the optical are precisely the same, as was previously thought. We considered several scenarios to explain ASASSN-14ko's periodic flares, but currently the most likely explanation is a repeating partial tidal disruption event -- the first detection of its kind.\n\nOptical Variability of the Dwarf AGN NGC 4395 from TESS\n\nschedule: Monday, 20:40 UT / 16:40 ET\n\nColin Burke (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)\n\nYue Shen (U Illinois) Yu-Ching Chen (U Illinois) Simone Scaringi (Texas Tech) Claude-Andre Faucher-Giguere (Northwestern) Xin Liu (U Illinois) Qian Yang (U Illinois)\n\nStochastic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosting supermassive black holes is ubiquitous across wavelengths and timescales. Unlike X-ray variability studies, measurements of high-quality optical light curves and power spectra of AGN are just beginning. A key question is if AGN variability properties can be related to physical properties of the accretion disk. In this talk, I will show early results from TESS demonstrating detection of variability in the archetypal dwarf AGN NGC 4395. Using the high-quality TESS light curve and careful systematic detrending, we found its variability properties are almost exactly as expected given its very low black hole mass of ~10^5 solar masses. This demonstrates the power of TESS light curves in identifying low-mass AGN with optical variability, and the potential to unlock a new window to our understanding of accretion disks across the entire range of supermassive black hole masses.\n\nDwarf planet light curves with TESS\n\nschedule: Friday, 13:50 UT / 09:50 ET\n\nCsaba Kiss (Konkoly Observatory)\n\nAndras Pal (Konkoly Observatory, Hungary), RÃ³bert SzakÃ¡ts (Konkoly Observatory, Hungary), Thomas MÃ¼ller (Max-Planck-Institut fÃ¼r extraterrestrische Physik, Germany)\n\nDespite that they are the brightest representatives of trans-Neptunian objects, many dwarf planets still miss a well-determined light curve and hence rotation period, in many cases due to the biases and aliases of ground-based observations. In this presentation we show results from the analysis of TESS light curves of the Kuiper belt dwarf planets Eris, Makemake and Orcus. These data are combined with thermal emission measurements to constrain the spin axis orientation and determine how the light curve can be caused by surface features. As all the three targets have a companion, the rotational information is also incorporated into a tidal evolution model that can be used to constrain the formation scenarios of the system, and, in some cases, give hints on the internal structure and material properties.\n\nSurveying the Trans-Neptunian Solar System with TESS\n\nschedule: Friday, 14:05 UT / 10:05 ET\n\nMalena Rice (Yale University)\n\nDan Foreman-Mackey (Center for Computational Astrophysics), Gabriella Contardo (Center for Computational Astrophysics), Greg Laughlin (Yale University)\n\nIn recent years, the observed orbital geometry of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) has provided intriguing evidence suggesting the existence of an as-yet undiscovered âPlanet Nine.â However, the statistical robustness of this claim has been heavily contested due to the uneven sky coverage of surveys searching for TNOs. We will present the first results from a new survey utilizing TESS full-frame images to search for TNOs, with a magnitude limit V~22. This survey is designed to extract the locations and magnitudes of undiscovered outer solar system objects, including both Planet Nine and the population of extreme trans-Neptunian objects pertinent to the Planet Nine hypothesis, using a blind shift-stacking search along all plausible outer solar system orbits. Together with the extensive sky coverage of the TESS mission, this search will place stringent constraints upon the undiscovered TNO population, with potential survey extensions to additional solar system populations.\n\nHow to deal with perturbing signals in radial-velocity follow-up\n\nschedule: Thursday, 14:20 UT / 10:20 ET\n\nMichaÃ«l Cretignier (Astronomy Department of the University of Geneva)\n\nXavier Dumusque, Yinan Zhao (Astronomy Department of the University of Geneva)\n\nWhen the m/s level radial-velocity (RV) precision wants to be reached to follow-up transiting candidates, it is mandatory to mitigate at best stellar, instrumental and atmospheric signals.\n\nTo do so, we developed a new code, YARARA, that analyses a time-series of high-resolution spectra for any given star, and model, using a combination of data-driven and physically-motivated approaches, the different flux contributions from i) the used spectrograph, ii) the tellurics, and iii) stellar activity. The RV derived from the cleaned HARPS spectra show generally a ~20% decrease in rms, which can be associated to a mitigation of the different perturbing signals. YARARA can be implemented for any high-resolution spectrograph data.\n\nTo go a step further in mitigating stellar activity, we can use the line-by-line RVs or spectra provided by YARARA and apply machine learning techniques such as PCA, ICA and others to separate a planetary signal from stellar activity, as the former affects all the spectral lines in the same way, which is not the case for the latter.\n\nYARARA plus data-driven approaches to separate stellar from planetary signal can significantly improve the detection of small-mass exoplanets.\n\nThe Latest in Precision RV Science and Synergies with TESS\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 19:30 UT / 15:30 ET (panel)\n\nJohanna Teske (Carnegie Earth and Planets Laboratory)\n\nNow is an exciting, perhaps \"revolutionary\", time to be an exoplanet scientist. Kepler provided us with a powerful foundation in exoplanet statistics and occurrence rates, which helped motivate the all-sky TESS Mission that has provided thousands of new, closer-by transiting planet candidates primed for detailed characterization. Spitzer and HST provided tantalizing glimpses of (mostly larger) exoplanet atmospheres, allowing us to pose hypotheses about atmospheric origin, evolution, and composition that will be addressed by the upcoming JWST. Furthermore, we are also in the midst of seminal growth in the ground-based detection and characterization of exoplanets via the radial velocity (RV) technique, a felicitous circumstance considering this technique kicked off observational exoplanet science over 25 years ago. In this talk, I will review the current state of precision RV science, describing the most cutting-edge instruments and what they are finding, as well as challenges to further advancement. I will also highlight how TESS is contributing to PRV science, and the synergies between the data analyses and results that are furthering our understanding of exoplanet evolution and demographics. Whether you are already a PRV fan, looking to learn more about how PRV and TESS connect, or both, this talk is for you!\n\nThe PLATO Mission\n\nschedule: Friday, 14:30 UT / 10:30 ET (panel)\n\nHeike Rauer (Institute of Planetary Research, DLR)\n\nPLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars) is ESAâs M3 mission and designed to detect and characterize extrasolar planets by high-precision, long-term photometric and asteroseismic monitoring of a large number of stars. PLATO will detect small planets around bright stars, including terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of solar-like stars. Planets will be characterized for their radius, mass, and age with high accuracy. PLATO will provide us the first large-scale catalogue of well-characterized small planets up to intermediate orbital periods, relevant for a meaningful comparison to planet formation theories. Thanks to accurate age estimates, PLATO will give us the ground to determine the various formation and evolution pathways that lead to planet and planetary system diversity. It will allow a comparative exoplanetology and to place our solar system planets in a broader context. PLATO is scheduled for a launch date end 2026. The payload instrument consists of 26 cameras with 12cm aperture each. For at least four years, the mission will perform high-precision photometric measurements to detect transiting planets and derive their radii and ages. The satellite data are complemented by a ground-based observing program to derive the planetary masses. This talk will present an overview of the PLATO instrument and the mission profile, its science goals, and its expected performances.\n\nAn asteroseismic tour of the HR diagram and new insights from TESS\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 13:00 UT / 09:00 ET (invited overview)\n\nMay Gade Pedersen (KITP, UCSB)\n\nA hundred years ago it was thought impossible that we would ever be able to study the interior physics of stars using in-situ observations. Less than fifty years later the first oscillations in the Sun were discovered and the field of helioseismology, which later also evolved into asteroseismology, started to take off. Asteroseismology is the study and interpretation of stellar oscillations, which penetrate deep into the stellar interiors and therefore carry information about the conditions within the star. This allows us to not only derive fundamental stellar parameters useful for the study of exoplanets, but also test our stellar structure and evolution models which form the basis of many fields in astrophysics. The past twenty years in particular have revolutionized the field of asteroseismology since the advent of space telescopes designed to provide high-precision, high-cadence, and long time base light curves of stars. This talk will provide a brief introduction to how asteroseismology works, as well as an overview of new insights gleaned from TESS for various oscillating stars across the HR diagram.\n\nBlips, Bursts, and Booms: New insights into Galactic transients, Active Galaxies, and Supernovae from TESS\n\nschedule: Monday, 19:30 UT / 15:30 ET (invited overview)\n\nMichael Fausnaugh (MIT)\n\nWith its large field-of-view and continuous monitoring, TESS opens a new window on transient and extragalactic time domain studies. I will review results from these fields over the last three years that were uniquely enabled by TESS. In particular, TESS data probes the physical processes governing gamma-ray emission in classical novae, and is adding to our understanding of accretion processes in active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events. TESS can also observe supernovae at the moment of explosion, which provides crucial data for supernova explosion physics and the nature of Type Ia supernova progenitors. I will conclude by describing likely contributions that TESS will make to transient and extragalactic astrophysics in the next year and future extended missions.\n\nTESSting Stellar Astrophysics\n\nschedule: Friday, 19:30 UT / 15:30 ET (invited overview)\n\nJamie Tayar (Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii)\n\nThere are still significant gaps in our understanding of stellar evolution, including questions related to rotation, magnetism, convection, and mixing. Kepler taught us many things, but it was limited in its fields, cadence, and sample size. I will show how the data from the TESS mission is allowing us to search for new types of variability, giving larger samples, providing additional information on old puzzles, and allowing us to combine photometry with the other types of data available for these bright stars. I will discuss how we can use this new data to better understand the physics of stellar interiors and evolution, and in turn use that understanding to make better models of stars, which can then be applied to characterizing exoplanetary systems as well as the populations of our own and other galaxies.\n\nThe hottest Jupiters orbiting evolved stars\n\nschedule: Wednesday, 13:54 UT / 09:54 ET (splinter talk)\n\nNicholas Saunders (Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaiâi)\n\nWhile the population of confirmed exoplanets around main-sequence stars continues to grow, the sample of planets transiting evolved stars is still limited, and traditional planet-search pipelines are not optimized for these stars. To uncover more planets orbiting post-main-sequence hosts, we have created a TESS photometry and planet search pipeline designed to target evolved stars using Full-Frame Image data. We present the first results from our search, highlighting the discovery of four hot Jupiters orbiting stars ranging from the subgiant to the red-giant branch. Using TESS photometry, ground-based photometry, and radial velocity measurements, we report masses between 0.5 and 2.0 Jupiter masses and radii between and 0.9 and 1.9 Jupiter radii. Two planets have periods <3 days, less than half the previous shortest known period of any planet around a red giant star. Additionally, two of the planets appear to be highly inflated, while the other two do not show any sign of inflation. The large spread in radii implies a complex relationship between planet mass, radius, incident flux, orbital properties and inflation efficiency. Our continued search will produce a statistical sample of planets which can be used to test theories of planet inflation and migration, and probe the demographics of planetary system evolution.\n\nThe CHEOPS Mission\n\nschedule: Friday, 14:30 UT / 10:30 ET (panel)\n\nWilly Benz (University of Bern)\n\nThe CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) was selected in 2012 as the first small mission (S-mission) in the ESA Science Programme and successfully launched on December 18, 2020 on a Soyouz-Fregat rocket from Kourou, French Guyana. It is a joint mission of ESA and Switzerland with important contribution by 10 additional ESA Member States. CHEOPS is the first mission dedicated to search for transits of exoplanets by means of ultrahigh precision photometry on bright stars already known to host planets. As a follow-up mission, CHEOPS is mainly dedicated to improving whenever possible existing radii measurements or provide first accurate measurements for a subset of those planets for which the mass has already been estimated from ground-based spectroscopic surveys. By unveiling transiting exoplanets with high potential for in-depth characterization, CHEOPS will also provide prime targets for future instruments suited to the spectroscopic characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres. A nominal mission duration of 3.5 years is foreseen to enable the execution of a broad and diverse science programme.\n\nMore Complete Orbital States with Transit Timing Variations and TESS\n\nschedule: Tuesday, 19:30 UT / 15:30 ET (panel)\n\nJuliette C Becker (Caltech)\n\nTo make the connection between the current states of exoplanet systems and their dynamical histories (including how planets may have formed and migrated), it is important that an orbital solution provides not just measures of the radii and masses of planets, but also the planetary orbital eccentricities and relative angular alignments. With sufficient quantity and quality of transit data, these important parameters can be extracted using transit timing variations (TTVs), presenting unique insights to the architectures of particularly multi-planet system. In this talk, I will summarize the recent history of TTVs and how TESS TTV data can be used to improve orbital solutions, discover unseen planets, and constrain planetary masses.\n\nStellar Age Determination\n\nschedule: Wednesday, 19:30 UT / 15:30 ET (panel)\n\nRuth Angus (American Museum of Natural History & Flatiron Institute)\n\nTESS provides many new opportunities to study young stars and exoplanets. For example, its light curves could help identify stars in young moving groups via their rotation periods, could reveal new young extrasolar planets, and could provide data needed to calibrate age-rotation relations for young stars and M dwarfs. In this talk I will discuss different methods available for dating cool young stars. TESS is particularly sensitive to the rotational variability of relatively rapidly rotating stars which are often young. I will discuss the promise and challenges presented by rotation-dating, also known as gyrochronology, for these rapidly rotating, young stars.\n\nActivities of the TESS Atmospheric Characterization Working Group (ACWG)\n\nschedule: Thursday, 20:20 UT / 16:20 ET (splinter talk)\n\nEliza Kempton (University of Maryland)\n\nThe Atmospheric Characterization Working Group (ACWG) for NASA's TESS mission was initially envisioned to conduct pre-launch activities for maximizing TESS's impact on exoplanet atmosphere studies. Now that TESS has completed its prime mission and entered its extended mission phase, the ACWG has shifted its focus. Currently and going forward, the role of the ACWG is to ensure the successful legacy of the TESS mission, specifically as it relates to the atmospheric characterization of its discovered exoplanets. In this context, success means pursuing a goal that the TESS-discovered exoplanets be observed by an optimal set of ground-based and spaced-based facilities in a coordinated manner, so as to extract population-level and individual planets' atmospheric properties. In this talk I will introduce the activities that the TESS ACWG has been undertaking to support its main goals. I will review criteria for joining the ACWG, and I will present the many ways in which the ACWG is working to support the atmospheric characterization community as it endeavors to further our understanding of the multitude of TESS-discovered exoplanets.\n\nA TESS view of evenings and mornings on distant exoplanets\n\nschedule: Thursday, 21:00 UT / 17:00 ET (splinter talk)\n\nNÃ©stor Espinoza (Space Telescope Science Institute)\n\nThe technique of transmission spectroscopy -the variation of the planetary radius with wavelength due to opacity sources in the planetâs terminator region- has been to date one of the most successful in the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres, providing key insights into the composition and structure of these distant worlds. One underlying assumption of the technique, however, is that the variations are the same in the entire terminator region. In reality, the morning and evening terminators might have distinct temperature, pressure and thus compositional profiles due to the inherent 3D nature of the planet which would, in turn, give rise to different spectra on each side of it. Motivated by the fascinating prospects of detecting this effect, we have started a theoretical and observational effort aimed at constraining these morning-to-evening signatures using the most precise transit lightcurves obtained by TESS to date. In this contribution, we present the first results of this effort, which includes a complete analysis of all known transiting exoplanets observed by TESS to date, a thorough study of lightcurve detrending methods and the most precise constraints on the morning and evening limbs on a distant exoplanet.\n\nThe Albedos and Phase Curves of Celestial Bodies\n\nschedule: Thursday, 20:30 UT / 16:30 ET (splinter talk)\n\nKevin Heng (University of Bern)\n\nThe study of the albedos of Solar System objects is at least a century old, at least in the Western world. The light of a planet or moon varying with orbital phase is known as its phase curve. I will concisely review and discuss historically important work, including seminal contributions by Lommel (1887), Seeliger (1888), Chandrasekhar (1960), Sobolev (1975) and Hapke (1981). These introductions set the stage for a detailed discussion of our recent work on generalising these classic works to derive closed-form, ab initio solutions for the geometric albedo and reflected light phase curve. This novel theoretical framework is applied to Kepler space telescope data of the hot Jupiter Kepler-7b, where we demonstrate that one may infer fundamental aerosol (single-scattering albedo, scattering asymmetry factor) and atmospheric (geometric albedo, Bond albedo, phase integral) properties from precise photometry alone, thus providing powerful complementary information to spectra. Another case study are the Cassini phase curves of Jupiter. By inverting the Cassini phase curves, we infer that aerosols in the Jovian atmosphere are large, irregular, polydisperse particles that may be responsible for causing coherent backscattering of sunlight.\n\nTESS Observations of Atmospheric Jets and Zonal Circulation in Ultracool Atmospheres\n\nschedule: Thursday, 20:50 UT / 16:50 ET (splinter talk)\n\nDaniel Apai (The University of Arizona)\n\nThe interplay between condensate clouds and atmospheric circulation is a key component in giant exoplanet atmosphere models, but one that is very difficult to observationally constrain. Brown dwarfs are easier-to-observe proxies of weakly-irradiated giant planets, which make up the majority of the giant exoplanet population. Brown dwarfs display rotational modulations, possibly due to their cloud cover modulated by planetary-scale waves. However, the long-term, continuous, high-precision monitoring data to test this hypothesis is lacking. We present here a high-precision lightcurve of the closest brown dwarfs, the binary system Luhman 16 AB. The TESS data, which cover about 100 rotations of Luhman 16 B, display continuous lightcurve evolution. The periodogram analysis reveals unprecedented information on atmospheric dynamics, rotation, and system geometry. Among other results, we find clear evidence for multiple high-speed atmospheric jets and zonal circulation in Luhman 16B. Our study provides what is likely the most constraining dataset on atmospheric circulation on weakly-irradiated brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets and paves the way toward direct observational tests of general circulation model predictions.\n\nModeling the impact of stellar XUV radiation and energetic charged particles on atmospheric escape and planetary habitability\n\nschedule: Thursday, 21:10 UT / 17:10 ET (splinter talk)\n\nDimitra Atri (NYU Abu Dhabi)\n\nStellar XUV radiation and energetic charged particles impact planetary atmospheres by inducing atmospheric escape, changes in chemistry and enhancing biological radiation dose on the surface. These effects can significantly impact planetary habitability. We use the Flare Frequency Distribution (FFD) of stars observed by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to calculate atmospheric escape rates of potentially habitable planets through the hydrodynamic escape channel. We compare the integrated loss of planetary atmospheres from flares and steady state stellar XUV around FGKM stars over 5 billion years and discuss its impact on their potential habitability. We also model how stellar particle events interact with exoplanetary magnetospheres and enhance radiation dose on their surfaces. Finally, we discuss studying these phenomena in greater detail on Mars using MAVEN data.\n\nMagnetically-driven hotspot reversals in ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres\n\nschedule: Wednesday, 14:18 UT / 10:18 ET (splinter talk)\n\nAlex Hindle (Newcastle University)\n\nRecent westward hotspot/brightspot offset measurements present significant exceptions from the norm of eastward hotspots found in the general hot Jupiter population. If these signals are to be trusted, they cannot be explained by hydrodynamic theory of synchronously rotating hot Jupiters, which predicts hotspots are always recirculated eastward of the substellar point. However, 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations predicted westward hotspot offsets would be possible in the hottest hot Jupiters (ultra-hot Jupiters). This is consistent with the emerging observational evidence as four out of the five westward measurements have been made on ultra-hot Jupiters, including one using TESS. Until now, however, the MHD mechanism that can drive such reversals has not been well understood. This talk will cover the findings of two recently submitted papers regarding the magnetic reversal mechanism. In the first part we will identify MHD mechanism responsible for hotspot reversals. In the second part, will physical consequences of the mechanism and apply a physically-motivated reversal criterion to a hot Jupiter dataset. Consequences include observational constraints of magnetic fields strengths and testable predictions that TESS can probe.\n\nMagnetically-driven hotspot reversals in ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres\n\nschedule: Thursday, 21:20 UT / 17:20 ET (splinter talk)\n\nAlex Hindle (Newcastle University)\n\nRecent westward hotspot/brightspot offset measurements present significant exceptions from the norm of eastward hotspots found in the general hot Jupiter population.
