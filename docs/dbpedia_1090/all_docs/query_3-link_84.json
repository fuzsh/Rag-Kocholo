Contributions welcome, send to editor@scuttlebutteurope.com\n\nBarcelona World Race\n\nIf during the pre-start hours in Barcelona there were fears that one Barcelona World Race duo might conjure up a breakaway in the opening days, so far such worries remain unfounded. Among the 'three musketeers' who are making the pace - albeit at speeds of an Sunday promenade today - there is still very little to choose between them.\n\nThe small advantage is back with Hugo Boss,Alex Thomson and Pepe Ribes, but Cheminees Poujoulat, Bernard Stamm and Jean Le Cam, and also Neutrogena, Guillermo Altadill and Jose Munoz have all had the lead during the last 24 hours and boat speeds in the very light downwind conditions remain very similar.\n\nThe British-Spanish duo on Hugo Boss only just have their nose in front by a matter of a few miles this afternoon. Seven miles to their west and a little behind are the Swiss-French skippers and a similar distance to their east are Neutrogena, the Spanish and Chilean pair.\n\nIn the grip of the light winds caused by a prevailing zone of high pressure, the trio are balancing the chance to work the best of the small pressure differences with a likely desire to stay in contact with the group.\n\nRanking at 14:00 UTC Sunday 4th January 2015\n\n1. Hugo Boss (A Thomson - P Ribes) 22,629 miles to finish\n\n2. Cheminées Poujoulat (B Stamm - J Le Cam) +2.7 miles to leader\n\n3. Neutrogena (G Altadill - J Munoz) +4.5\n\n4. GAES Centros Auditivos (A Corbella - G Marin) +24.7\n\n5. Renault Captur (J Riechers - S Audigane) +64.9\n\n6. One Planet One Ocean & Pharmaton (A Gelabert - D Costa) + 121\n\n7. We Are Water (B Garcia - W Garcia) + 210\n\n8. Spirit of Hungary (N Fa - C Colman) + 415\n\nwww.barcelonaworldrace.org\n\n* A new record for the 538-mile opening passage from Barcelona to Gibraltar was set by Alex Thomson and Pepe Ribes when they exited the Mediterranean on Hugo Boss on Thursday evening, leading the Barcelona World Race. But their passage into the Atlantic proved problematic when they then hit two unidentified objects and hooked a net around their keel in strong winds and muscular seas.\n\nHugo Boss marked a new race time to Gibraltar at 2 days 5 hrs 50 mins, reducing the 2011 record of Jean-Pierre Dick and Loick Peyron by 26 hours and 5 minutes.\n\nTornado Worlds\n\nPhoto by Martina Barnetova, www.mbphotos.cz. Click on image to enlarge.\n\nOur single placements at the Tornado Sailing World Championships on the Swan River in Perth speak for themselves: 3-12-1-2-4-10-2-4.9-1-2.\n\nBetween joy and frustration there were only a few hours. It was actually going quite well and after half of the series, we were on the third overall close to the leading teams from Greece and Australia. On the last day of sailing in 2014 it was even better with the places 1-2-4. However, the new year started not so nice...\n\nIn race 8, shortly after the start, an Australian team crashed into the back of our Tornado and took both rudders away including the fittings. Also we got a big hole in the stern of the boat. It was a disaster. We were completely shocked and thought we might sink. Fortunately, the club was only a few hundred meters away from the race track and we could just pull our boat ashore.\n\nThe protest hearing we won... [but not the redress we wanted]. The repair of the boat into the night cost our last nerves and forces. We made it, thanks to many great helpers in the Nedland Yacht Club and Windrush Composites. We made it to the start of the final race, where sailed to a first and second.\n\nBasically we had many top scorings and we were very close to the favorites. However, with the crash and the special jury decision we had no chance to win the overall ranking. -- Roland Gaebler\n\nFinal top five (place, skipper, nation, points)\n\n1. Iordanis Paschalidis, GRE, 21\n\n2. Brett Burvill, AUS, 28\n\n3. Roland Gaebler, GER, 29.9\n\n4. Gav Colby, AUS, 32\n\n5.

We'll rebuild our boat just as we rebuild our hopes and dreams.\"\n\nThe aim is to return the boat to the now six-strong fleet in Lisbon ready for the Leg 8 start on June 7.\n\nTeam Vestas Wind CEO Morten Albæk has told his skipper that the ultimate plan will be not just to return for the eighth leg start from Lisbon to Lorient but give the six other boats in the fleet a run for their money after that.\n\n\"That,\" he said, \"will be real success.\"\n\nwww.teamvestaswind.vestas.com\n\nTeam SCA Wins Abu Dhabi In-Port Race\n\nPhoto by Rick Tomlinson, rick-tomlinson.com. Click on image for photo gallery.\n\nTeam SCA led virtually from start to finish to romp to a convincing victory in the Volvo Ocean Race In-Port Race in Abu Dhabi on Friday after a lack of wind nearly forced a postponement.\n\nThe third race in the series began 1hr 40mins behind schedule - another 20 minutes and the action would have been scrapped for the day - because of the missing breeze.\n\nFinally, at 1540 local time/1140 UTC, race officials judged that the breeze had picked up enough for a viable race and the women of Team SCA never looked back.\n\nThey took a starboard course early on and by the first mark in the 3.2-nautical mile (nm), two-lap race, had established a 50-metre lead and they continued to build on it from then on with a display of consummate in-port sailing.\n\nIn the end, it almost looked easy as the Swedish-backed boat crossed the line, 1min 28secs ahead of second-placed Team Brunel (Bouwe Bekking/NED).\n\nAbu Dhabi Ocean Racing, who won the corresponding race here three years ago, again finished on the podium in third, 43 seconds further behind.\n\nIan Walker's crew lead the overall standings by two points from Team Brunel with Team SCA now in third.\n\nAbu Dhabi In-Port Race result:\n\n1.

Matt Stechmann (NZL) did just enough to take the title by one point from Luke O'Connell (NZL), who won a three way points tie with defending champion, Roger Blasse (AUS), who took third overall, and Greg Wilcox (NZL) in fourth.\n\nGoing into the final day, the fleet needed two more races to get in a valid series, so there was audible relief as the sailors arrived on Sunday morning to a sailable 15-20 knots on the bay. The day started damp and grey, following the overnight storm and rain, but by the second race the sky was clear and the sea breeze was pumping. The strong winds of Saturday had also left a large confused sea behind, but this soon moderated along with the wind.\n\nAfter a week of drama and waiting, the event then had a poetic ending. Black Rock YC Commodore, Andre Blasse (AUS), had spent the previous two years organising this championship, and dominated the final race to win by a massive margin. It was a very popular win.\n\nFinal top ten results after five races (one discard)\n\n1. Matt Stechmann, NZL, 18 points\n\n2. Luke O'connell, NZL, 19\n\n3. Roger Blasse, AUS, 19\n\n4.

Click on image to enlarge.\n\nThe International 14 class family are gathering in Australia for the 2015 World Championships and Australian Championships.\n\nSixty-nine teams are converging on Geelong for the seven race series being hosted by Royal Geelong Yacht Club on Corio Bay from the 7th to 16th January 2015.\n\nAlongside the home country contingent from all around Australia, there are 24 international teams. They are led by reigning World Champion, Britain's Archie Massey. He is joined by another 11 teams from Great Britain, two from Japan and two from Canada, three from Germany, four from the USA and one from Italy.\n\nThe line-up for the event is impressive with six of the top 10 from the last World Championships attending Geelong - Archie Massey (GBR), Andy Fitzgerald (GBR), Andy Partington (GBR), Katie Nurton (GBR), Scott Devine (AUS) and Lindsay Irwin (AUS).\n\nThe Practice Race is on Wednesday 7th with the racing commencing the next day.

For the boat's debut Coffs race the promised fresh nor'easters only teased, turning the usual dash into more of an amble. The most wind Beau Geste encountered was an 18 knot sea breeze this afternoon.\n\nJulian Farren-Price's evergreen steed of 14 years, About Time, delivered the Sydney owner and crew a third IRC overall handicap win.\n\nAbout Time equalled the record for the most IRC overall wins, joining Bob Oatley's Wild Oats X on the honour board.\n\nIRC is one of the three handicap systems owners opt to compete and be scored under for the annual coastal classic. The other two are ORCi and PHS.\n\nFarren-Price's Cookson 12 from the CYCA in Sydney is both the official IRC and ORCi overall winner ahead of Rob Hanna's TP52 Shogun V. The TP52 is on its way back to Geelong, a 780 nautical mile delivery to the owner's home port for the next event on the program; the Festival of Sails later this month.\n\nOn corrected time About Time beat Shogun V by 33 minutes under IRC over the 226 nautical mile race and on ORCi results the gap is greater wider at 51 minutes.\n\nPHS results are decided and the lovable Queensland veteran of the sport, Robbo Robertson, at the helm of his own design, a Robertson 950 called Corrobboree has taken top honours from Stephen Dadour's Dehler 41 Solutions and Sandor Tornai's Espresso Forte. -- Lisa Ratcliff\n\nwww.pittwatertocoffs.com.au\n\nFeatured Brokerage\n\nGitana 11. 1,320,000 Euros.\n\nEx.

Good conditions for the sailors to start the Worlds. All boats were able to compete and have fun. The wind was a bit shifty and around 8 to 12 knots. The brothers Newman did a pretty good job and ended as first and second overall. With 5 boats from Australia and 5 from overseas in the top 10, it's going to be interesting for the rest of the week.\n\nThe day started with almost no wind and about 40 (degrees) so really hot. The race committee decided to put up AP for a while, waiting for the sea breeze to come in. Liters of water went into the sailors, as they were sweating while doing nothing.\n\nIn the first race there was a general recall, as the fleet was a little too keen to get started.

Along with their win at the Datchet Flyer last month, this moves the multiple Endeavour Trophy champions into a commanding lead after four of the eight events in the GJW Direct Sailjuice Winter Series.\n\nDiscarding a 9th in the first race and counting a 3,1, Craig and Roberts won the Oxford Blue with 4 points, half the number of the runner-up, the Scorpion of Gray and Rhodes. Holman's D-Zero was 3rd overall. Nine different classes finished in the top 10, with Birrell and Brearey the leading trapeze boat in 9th. It was a good turnout for the RS Aero singlehanders, with this event counting as part of the RS Sailing/ Magic Marine RS Aero Winter Championship. Pete Barton was first of the Aeros, in 17th overall.\n\nSailRacer was running GPS tracking at this event, and fastest boat on the water was the 49er of Graeme Willcox and Andrew Tarboton which finished 15th overall.

The new America's Cup boats are lighter and faster than what we've had before.\n\n\"They will be powered by a wing and will fly above the water on foils. They're as much like airplanes as they are like traditional boats, so I know we'll have a lot to learn from the experience the engineers at airbus bring to the project.\"\n\nLambert Lai\n\nThe J/24 Class, and all who knew him, lost a great friend.

He arrived in upstate New York after his service to our country as an Army Medic in Vietnam. He finished his schooling and became a Physician's Assistant. He joined Sodus Bay Yacht Club and became an active participant in racing J/24s. He later joined Rochester Yacht Club and purchased his current J/24, Dr. Feel Good, which he campaigned in District 7 and along the East Coast.\n\nHe sailed in all major regattas including two J/24 World Championships, three North Americans, several Midwinters and Charleston Race Week. He campaigned his boat in all District 7 events. Lambert was also a friend to big boat sailing, never missing a chance to help out others. Lambert also served on Race Committees for many events including women's match racing, frostbiting and several other regattas. He served as the President of the US J/24 Class, and represented Rochester Yacht Club as organizer of the 2012 J/24 Worlds as well as many other regattas. Lambert has won many sailing awards over the years, but his commitment to District 7, the J/24 Class, to sailing, and to his many friends was the gift he gave to us.

It gave these competitors a chance to test their equipment and familiarising themselves with several of their competitors.\n\nThe friendly showdown was held by host club, Royal Geelong Yacht Club, close to the shoreline where waterfront visitors and office workers were able to enjoy the spectacle of the fast-paced racing.\n\nThe Team Racing trophy was taken out by Australia 1 - Brad Devine, Lindsay Irwin, David Heyter and Stuart Sloss - but not before several dramas almost derailed the campaign.\n\nThe Teams Racing course was set up close to shore in a different area to what will be used for the World Championships fleet racing which starts on Thursday.

Photo from the International Dragon Class of Australia. Click on image to enlarge.\n\nKevin Webb, Sarel van der Merwe, and Brad Stemmett sailing Banjo, a Farrier F9AX trimaran, have broken the 1,750-mile Governor's Cup Race record from Simon's Town to St Helena with a time of 9 days 13 hours and 36 seconds.\n\nWebb, van der Merwe and Stemmett arrived in Jamestown, St Helena at 01.53.36 today, in just enough time to shave off five hours from Banjo's previous race record of 9 day,18 hours and 59 minutes set by Frans Loots in 2010.\n\nAfter an exceptionally lively start from False Bay Yacht Club, Simon's Town on 27 December, when winds gusted up to 40kts, the race developed into a game of tactics with those opting for the more northern route towards St Helena generally benefiting from stronger, more consistent winds.\n\nWebb, van der Merwe and Stemmett weaved their way to an early on-the-water lead soon after the start and were first round Cape Point later that afternoon, which enabled them to slot into a downwind roller coaster ride in the relentless wind that lasted for several days.\n\nFurther down the racecourse the conditions are less favourable with many competitors struggling with boat speed in the light airs. With just five days until the cut-off time, the situation looks bleak, particularly for those still with over 700-nautical miles to go.\n\nAccording the Bram Weller - the Race Officer at the finish line in St Helena - there is a good chance some boats won't make the race deadline. \"It is very concerning the wind has dropped so much, and the outlook doesn't look promising either. As it stands at the moment half the fleet is not going to finish the race within the time limit which is 1200 GMT on Saturday 10 January, unless the race committee extends the deadline. At this stage there are just seven boats - Banjo, Black Cat, Avanti, Strumpet, Vulcan 44, Canace, and Revelation, who'll make it, while Carel Jacobs and team of the Baltic 42 Cool Runnings looks like they might miss the cut off by seven hours.\"\n\nGiven the conditions, the overall winner of the Governor's Cup 2014/15 is still uncertain although it is looking more and more certain that it could go to Klaus Wiswedel and team on Avanti (Vikers 41) in Racing division. -- Sue Pelling\n\ngovernorscup.sh\n\nwww.facebook.com/Governorscuprace\n\nSK2. Welcome To The New.\n\nThe fast and fun sportsboat with a canting keel. Developed by Swing Keel Sailing Ltd and built by Ovington boats.\n\nThe SK2 is equally a capable racer for 2-3 crew or a performance day-sailor with family and friends. Developed as a strict one design class in mind it is equally suitable for a wide range of mixed fleet racing. The SK2 has been shown to live happily and be equally competitive amongst dinghies, sportsboats and more varied inshore club fleets. A true cross-over boat.\n\nSK2's thoroughly developed package provides a new experience. The difference is the canting keel. Easily operate manually the canting keel provides additional righting moment and allows full use of SK2's powerful sailplan. Together this makes the SK2 suitable for a wide range of wind conditions.

Owning up to this unpardonable error for a sailor with a high reputation proved a challenging task, and it gave David the idea for the Yacht Club.\n\nSo invitations are issued to those who it is considered have performed a humorous and out-of-place incident afloat, and are prepared to admit it to their peer group ashore.

All we know is that the vessel developed a severe list as it left the Port of Southampton and the pilot and master of ship decided to ground it on the bank.\n\nA 200m exclusion zone is currently in place around the car carrier for safety reasons and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's Counter Pollution Team continue to monitor the situation, but as of yet, there is no sign of pollution.\n\nHoegh Autoliners have now appointed Svitzer to lead a salvage operation of the vessel.\n\nwww.ybw.com\n\n72 Hours Into Leg 3 and Dongfeng Still Leading\n\nGoing into day 4 (of what is expected to be a 20+ day leg) Dongfeng Race Team are leading the Volvo Ocean Race fleet by 17 nautical miles with 4,160 miles to go to Sanya, China. Going back to the fact this race is a one-design fleet, a 17 nautical mile lead on day 4 is a not a bad start, not that anyone particularly wants to admit it at this stage for fear of jinxing the situation.\n\nThere is currently 23 nautical miles separating the fleet between first and last position. Now past the Iranian exclusion zone they will stay north, close to the Pakistani coast to avoid a high pressure system to the south. Tonight they can expect more winds (15/16 knots) and less drifting as the higher winds mark a change from the light Gulf thermal conditions to the more established monsoon winds of India.\n\ndongfengraceteam.com\n\nPrince Philip Cup Australasian Dragon Championship\n\nWhimsical leading fellow Sydney boat Indulgence on a windy Port Philip.

He won the Prince Philip Cup on Hobart's River Derwent several years back, his first win in what is the Australasian championship for the Dragon class after half a century in the class.\n\nHe also went close to wining the Sydney Hobart Yacht Race with Caprice of Huon in 1972.\n\nAfter four races, Whimsical is on 10 points, with fellow RSYS member Wolf Breit in second place in Shapes after placings of 1-1-3-6 for 11 points. Among Shapes' experienced crew is Roger Hickman who last week skippered the ocean racing yacht Wild Rose to an overall victory in the Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race.\n\nThird overall is the West Australian entry, Wizzardy, skippered by Raymond Chatfield from Royal Freshwater Bay Yacht Club with 16 points from placings of 5-4-5-2.\n\nBritish yachtsman Robert Campbell and the crew of Indulgence, winners of the Ted Albert Memorial Regatta on Sunday, were OCS in race two yesterday today improved their overall standing to sixth with a first and a third place.\n\nRacing continues Tuesday, Thursday and Friday at Royal Brighton Yacht Club. -- Peter Campbell\n\nwww.dragonclass.org.au/prince-philip-cup/\n\nSailing and Marine Manager - Middle Island Vacancy\n\nThe Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club, one of the oldest sailing and rowing clubs in Hong Kong, is looking for a high calibre individual to fill the post of Sailing and Marine Manager.\n\nThis is a full-time contract based in Hong Kong commencing March / April 2015.

With racing yachts that include schooners, sloops and ketches of varying lengths and with displacements ranging from 50 to 600 tons, it is a challenging task.\n\nSelecting a handicap rule for any regatta is a decision that is made by each individual Regatta Organizer. It is not a decision made by the SYRA and the SYRA does not administer the rule. The YC Costa Smeralda, Bucket Regattas and Superyacht Cup Palma will use the ORCsy for their respective 2015 regattas.\n\nThe ORC began development of the new superyacht rule last summer and their working party includes respected names familiar to many in the handicapping arena - Andy Claughton, Nicola Sironi, Alessandro Nazareth, Paolo Massarini, and Martyn Prince of the Wolfson Unit at the University of Southampton.\n\nThe ORCSY handicap application is available now at the Superyacht section on the ORC website: www.orc.org/superyacht\n\nM2H Race Yacht Aground On Return Voyage\n\nThe winner of the Melbourne to Hobart Westcoaster Race, the Victorian yacht Seduction, early today ran aground on Gull Island in the Furneaux Islands on the return voyage from Hobart to Melbourne, with the delivery crew of five rescued by a Police launch within two hours.\n\nThe yacht was returning to Melbourne after competing in the ORCV 2014 Melbourne to Hobart ocean yacht race and was en route to Lady Barron on Flinders Island.\n\nThe crew was rescued by the Flinders Island police boat at approximately 0640 hours this morning.\n\nOther yachts in the vicinity heard their MAYDAY call, including two ORCV yachts returning from Hobart, Trybooking and Cartouche, which were then about four hours away on the west side of Cape Barren Island, but were not required in the rescue operation.\n\nThe yacht is currently still aground and investigations are under way regarding a salvage operation, including minimising the impact on the environment.\n\nSeduction won the ORCV 2014 Melbourne to Hobart Westcoaster in all three handicap divisions (AMS, IRC and PHS) and also won the Sovereign Series which also included to Cock of the Bay and the King of the Derwent races in all three handicap divisions. -- Peter Campbell\n\nKing Of Derwent Crown To The Fork In The Road\n\nFormer world champion and Olympic dinghy sailor Gary Smith today added another crown to his illustrious career, steering The Fork in the Road to victory in Hobart's iconic harbour race, the 2015 Lexus of Hobart King of the Derwent.\n\nThe noted Tasmanian yacht won the IRC handicap division of the spectacular round-the-buoys race giving her the coveted title of King of the Derwent to add to line or handicap honours in almost every offshore race in the State, including her fourth line honours win early this week in the National Pies Launceston to Hobart Race.\n\nSmith recently was inducted into the Tasmanian Sporting Hall of Fame, the first yachtsman to receive this honour in more than three decades.\n\nThe Fork in the Road also won the AMS division, with Seduction second and Paul Einedor's Beneteau Oceanis 37 third.\n\nThe PHS division went to Paul Einoder's Off-Piste from The Fork in the Road and Tony Ellis' Moonshadow.\n\nThe results of today's Lexus King of the Derwent has seen the National Pies Launceston to Hobart Series go to Off-Piste, taking out all three handicap categories, IRC, AMS and PHS. -- Peter Campbell\n\nLetters To The Editor - editor@scuttlebutteurope.com\n\nLetters are limited to 350 words.

From Truly Classics to super Js, from flat-bottomed racers to the F-class Firefly, the yard has built up an excellent reputation for its 'high up wind, down to earth' approach.\n\nFounded in 1985, Claasen Shipyards first made its name in the Dutch market for flat-bottomed yachts. By the mid-1990s the yard had started building yachts which combine traditional looks with ultra-modern underwater configurations: nineteen of these Truly Classics have been launched to date. Claasen has also been part of the J-class revival, launching Lionheart in 2010 and currently building 'SVEA', based on the 1937 design by Tore Holm.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nLandsail Tyres has been announced as title sponsor for the J-Cup 15, taking place from the Island Sailing Club in Cowes from 11th - 13th June 2015.\n\nEntries are already flying in, and thanks to the support of Landsail, competitor berthing at Cowes Yacht Haven Marina will be free of charge for the duration of the regatta.

At 40,000 nautical miles in length, it is the world's longest ocean race, also regarded as one of the toughest endurance challenges on the planet.\n\nAs the Clipper Race's official rope supplier, Marlow Ropes will once again provide each of the fleet's twelve Clipper 70 yachts with over 40,000 metres of high quality ropes which are made of modern, light weight fibres such as Dyneema.\n\nOcean Safety marks its sixth consecutive time as Clipper Race safety supplier and will continue to work closely with the race organisers to ensure that the safety standards of the 2015-16 circumnavigation are accurately met.\n\nChartCo, one of the world's largest stockists and distributors of nautical charts, navigational data and marine technical publications, is back on board for its fourth consecutive race as an official Clipper Race supplier.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe name Knierim stands for everything that is top of the range in the boat builder's craft and it has been doing this now for exactly 50 years. In its second generation, the yard has focused on building individual high-tech yachts, including the then unique German America's Cup racer Germany I (2006).\n\nThe story began in 1965 on the real estate occupied by a former lifeboat shed on the Eastern bank of the Kieler fjord. Günter Knierim's yacht and boatyard serviced and repaired solid timber fishing cutters.\n\nHowever, it wasn't very long before they concentrated on sporting boats. Plywood hulls were developed and even entire yachts laid down at Kiel. In the 70s, the quarter-tonne \"Vagabund\", with a chine hull, was the prototype for three successors. The first quarter-tonners, made from moulded plywood, the \"Attacke\" and the \"Kninispri\", followed and took the Mini Tonner world championship in the South of France in 1983.\n\nIn 1999, Gunnar Knierim, who won the Admirals' Cup in 1993 on Willi Illbruck's Pinta and had learned about refined composite technologies at the Admiral's Cup in New Zealand, took over as managing director. Two years later, he relocated the company to a colossal area on the Kiel Canal. To date, this courageous step has produced some 30 new builds, ranging from comfortable cruise ships for sailing round the world to high-tech racing yachts.\n\nFeatured Brokerage\n\n2009 Melges 32. 69,950 EUR.

Defending world champion Nathan Outteridge (AUS) was in the Yellow on a course further out and on the receiving end of bumpier conditions and scored 3-2-2-1 results.\n\nTwo drops are in place following the seven qualifying races. Burling is on 5 points and Outteridge on 7. Tomorrow the fleet will be divided into Gold and Silver, with the top half of leaderboard going through to the Gold fleet.\n\nSixteen countries are represented in the record fleet of 160: Australia (97), Austria (2), Denmark (1), France (5), Great Britain (7), Hong Kong (1), Ireland (3), Italy (5), Japan (5), New Zealand (1), Norway (8), South Africa (1), Sweden (2), Switzerland (7), the US Virgin Islands (1) and USA (13). -- Di Pearson\n\nTop five\n\n1.

If they can get their boat ready in time, the pair will deserve, as a minimum, an encouragement award. Early in the regatta they broke their mast. They then had a super start to Race 2 leading the fleet before a costly capsize. Then there was yesterday.\n\n\"We had major gear problems yesterday. A shroud gave way and it was game over.

The Tempest is unusual for a keelboat in having a trapeze and can reach remarkable speeds.\n\nSoling: designed by Jan Linge of Norway in 1965 based on ideas that emerged while tank testing a 5.5mR for the 1960 Olympics, ideas which were outside the 5.5mR rules. The Soling was selected as the men's triple-handed boat for the 1972 Olympics in selection trails at which it was the only survivor in heavy conditions at Kiel and remained an Olympic class until 2000.\n\nContessa 26: designed by Jeremy Rogers and heavily influenced by David Sadler and the Folkboat to produce a 25.6ft fibreglass boat that proved to be a very successful racer and capable of long-distance, blue-water cruising. -- David Elliot in Afloat\n\nafloat.ie\n\nOcean Cruising Club Announces Awards For 2014\n\nLondon, UK: The Ocean Cruising Club (The OCC) has announced the recipients of the OCC Awards for 2014.

That Rashley is so close to the top of the leaderboard is extraordinary.\n\nAt the 2014 Moth Worlds in Rashley's playground of Hayling Island, England, he pulled off five wins to Outteridge's four. It was winning the final race that sealed it for the Australian, the race in which the Brit finished 10th and left him second overall.\n\nKnowing the talent coming to the McDougall + McConaghy 2015 Moth Worlds, and determined to better his second overall at the 2014 Moth Worlds. Rashley arrived in Sorrento well before the event to practice and get used to the local conditions. However, not long into his stay, the Englishman suffered a disc protrusion.\n\n\"And if you walk the beach at these Worlds, you will find lots of guys who have had this problem and some who have it now; it comes from hiking and not being strong in your core.

Click on image to enlarge.\n\nThe entry list for the One Ton Revisited event in February/March has leveled out at seven. We are, however, liaising closely with three more potentials who are working hard to be a part of the action.\n\nThe Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron will be back on deck on Monday, 19 January, 2015, at which time we will quickly finalise arrangements for any group measure and weigh for validated IRC certification.\n\nThe latest to complete that process is Roger Foley's 39ft Carter design Wai Aniwa which has come in at 0.935 (with spinnaker).\n\nWai Aniwa is one of Chris Bouzaid's two One Ton Cup champions in the line-up. She won back the trophy for New Zealand in Sydney, in 1972. Roger plans to leave Wellington on 17 January and, via East Cape, and should be in Auckland around 22 January although, he says, \"We could stall to fish for a day or two en route\".\n\nThe other Bouzaid OTC champion in the fleet will be the iconic 36ft S&S design Rainbow II, which won the Cup in Heligoland in 1969 and launched New Zealand's drive to dominate world offshore racing and its attendant marine industry.\n\nRainbow II is still undergoing the extensive restoration that will see her back in fighting trim in time for the five-race OTR event.\n\nBouzaid has yet to finalise his crew but it could include include 1969 Hobart race win veterans Gil Littler and Steve (\"Sticky\") Armitage along with stalwart Roy Dickson who was navigator for both of Rainbow's campaigns in Heligoland.\n\nRacing schedule:\n\nSaturday 28th February, Race 1: 35 NM Race to Te Kouma\n\nMonday 2nd March, Race 2: 20 NM Hauraki Gulf\n\nTuesday 3rd March, Race 3: 20 NM Hauraki Gulf\n\nThursday 5th March, Race 4: 35-45 Long Gulf Course\n\nSaturday 7th March, Race 5: 25 NM Short Gulf Course\n\nAdditionally, we will be staging short-course harbour races in conjunction with the Volvo pro-am races on Thursday, 12 March and Friday, 13 March, and with the Volvo In-Port race on Saturday, 14 March. -- Alan Sefton\n\nThe Pope Files Complaint Against America's Cup Jurors\n\nThe former head of sailing's governing body has filed complaints of gross misconduct against the five members of an international jury that handed down the harshest penalties in America's Cup history.\n\nPaul Henderson of Toronto has requested hearings by the International Sailing Federation (ISAF). The action comes weeks after the Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced sailor Dirk de Ridder's suspension from sanctioned events from three years to 18 months. De Ridder was banned from the 34th America's Cup in September 2013 and Oracle Team USA was docked two points in a scandal involving manipulation of the weight distribution of boats that Oracle sailed in warmup regattas.\n\nHenderson filed individual complaints against jury members Bryan Willis of Great Britain and Graham McKenzie of New Zealand, based on depositions they gave during hearings before CAS, and a single complaint against the other three jury members, David Tillett of Australia, Josje Hofland of the Netherlands and John Doerr of Britain.\n\n\"All members of the AC 34 jury failed and violated the principles of ISAF by not providing an equitable and fair hearing to all sailors,\" Henderson wrote in his complaint against Tillett, Hofland and Doerr. -- Bernie Wilson, AP\n\nFull story: bigstory.ap.org\n\nPlans For America's Cup Team Dropped\n\nA late proposal that would have seen a Bermuda team compete in the 35th America's Cup has fallen by the wayside.\n\nA spokesman for a group behind the ambitious plan confirmed yesterday that they had considered entering a team, but have since had a change of heart.\n\n\"We were at one time in loose discussions about possibly entering a Bermuda boat in AC35, \" the spokesman told The Royal Gazette. \"[But] this is now definitely not going to happen.\"\n\nThe group's decision to drop plans for a home entry came after America's Cup legend Dennis Conner declined an offer to manage the team and help to raise funds to finance the campaign.\n\n\"I am not in any position to raise the money or actively manage the effort,\" said Mr Conner, a four-time America's C"
