        "text": "Argus Motoren was a German manufacturing firm known for their series of small inverted-V engines and the V-1 (flying bomb) pulse jet engine.\n\nHistory[]\n\nStarted in Berlin in 1906 as a subsidiary of Henri Jeannin's automobile business, Argus Motoren company spun off entirely in November 1906. Their early products were car and boat engines, but later that year they were contracted to produce engines for the French airship, Ville de Paris, supplying them with a converted boat motor. They turned increasingly to the aviation market, and were widely used by 1910, receiving an order from Sikorsky for one of his large airplanes under construction in Russia. During World War I Argus produced engines for the German army and air corps.\n\nAfter WWI the company manufactured automobile engines and acquired a majority interest in Horch Automobile in 1919.[1] In 1926 they resumed aircraft engine design, producing a series of inverted inline and V engines. Although all were at the \"low-power\" end of the market by the start of World War II, they saw extensive use in training aircraft and other utility roles. Most famous of these designs are the Argus As 10, used in the Fieseler Fi 156 Storch, in the Arado Ar 66 and in the Focke-Wulf Fw 56 St√∂sser; and the Argus As 410, used on many German trainers, including the Arado Ar 96.\n\nThe Berlin-Reinickendorf subcamp of Sachsenhausen concentration camp provided labor for the Argus-Werke.[2]\n\nList of Argus engines[]\n\nArgus 1908 4-cylinder[3]\n\nArgus As I 4-cylinder, 100-hp, year 1913[4]\n\nArgus As II 6-cylinder, 120-hp, year 1914[5]\n\nArgus As III 6-cylinder upright inline, used in WWI aircraft\n\nArgus As 5 odd radial-like arrangement 24-cylinder inline\n\nArgus As 7 9R 700 hp[3]\n\nArgus As 8 4-cylinder inverted inline[3]\n\nArgus As 10 8-cylinder inverted V[3]\n\nArgus As 12 16H 550 hp[3]\n\nArgus As 014 pulse jet engine for V-1 flying bomb and Tornado boat\n\nArgus As 044[3]\n\nArgus As 16 4-cylinder inverted inline 40 hp[3]\n\nArgus As 17 6-cylinder inverted inline 225 hp / 285 hp[3]\n\nArgus As 401 development and renumbering of the As 10\n\nArgus As 402[3]\n\nArgus As 403 radial engine project, not built.\n\nArgus As 410 12-cylinder inverted V[3]\n\nArgus As 411 12-cylinder inverted V[3]\n\nArgus As 412 24-cylinder H-block, prototyped[3]\n\nArgus As 413 similar to 412, never built[3]\n\nArgus 109-014\n\nArgus 109-044[3]\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of aircraft engines\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
