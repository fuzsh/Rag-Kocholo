Defending 420 Champions Seb Menzies/Blake McGlashan had no need to discard a score, knocking out another exceptional performance to claim two more race wins, making it four in a row.\r\n\r\nOver in the 420 Women and 420 U17 though, the discard came in useful, although the top two teams in each of the Women and U17 leader boards remain locked in a tiebreak.\r\n\r\nTwo more races on Monday 8 July will complete the 6-race qualification series and we are guaranteed to see the leader board shake up as teams make a massive push to advance to the gold fleet cut for the 6-race final series, which starts from 9 July.\r\n\r\n420 OPEN\r\nDefending World Champions Seb Menzies/Blake McGlashan hold tightly onto the overall lead, and team mates Mason Mulcahy/Andre Van Dam shift up the leaderboard to second overall from their 2,1 performance.\r\n\r\n“The day started with lighter wind but along the day it picked up and delivered amazing sailing conditions,” explained Mulcahy. “Vilamoura is a dream venue. I’m very happy with our performance today and I expect to get the best possible result.\"\r\n\r\nAll change behind, as Spain’s Spain’s Conrad Konitzer/Fernando Rodriguez move up three places, from 6th yesterday to 3rd today, after delivering solid results of 1,4.\r\n\r\nJumping up into the top 10 go Great Britain’s Haydn Sewell/William Heathcote, France’s Youen Fourn/Mathis Guessard and Spain’s  Pablo Ruiz/Miguel Martinez Fortun, with the biggest climb going to the British partnership who move up to fourth overall.\r\n\r\n“It was a very good day out on the water today,” said Sewell who counted results of 3,4. “It was challenging, tight racing and really fun – and the waves were fun.”\r\n\r\nCompeting at his first 420 Worlds, Sewell shared his thoughts on the reasons for their improved performance, saying, “We just had a bigger focus on our straight line boat speed and getting through the fleet and just sending it.\"\r\n\r\nA significant escalation also to Brazil’s Bernardo Peixoto/Marcos Arndt, the reigning 420 South American Champions, who climb to 16th.\r\n\r\n“We went very well. I really enjoyed it out there,” said Peixoto after racing.\r\n\r\n“The wind was very strong and is good conditions for us and we got really good results, a 2 and 6,” continued Arndt. “We are very happy. We hope for a top 10 overall.”\r\n\r\nThis pair also has the world’s premier youth event in their site, as they head to Poland and the Youth Sailing World Championship later this month, as Arndt concluded, “Our target is also the Youth Worlds, and we are here to train too.”\r\n\r\n420 Open – Top 10 after 4 Races\r\n1.

Moving up to third overall are Vita Heathcote/Milly Boyle, reigning British Spring National Champions and RYA Youth National Champions, after winning race 3 and following up with a third in race 4.\r\n\r\nFortunate for Keers/Chatterton that their UFD penalty in today’s race 3 was discarded, although they are fully aware there is no room for further mistakes. Still early days, but after 4 races there is just 2 points between the leading five teams.\r\n\r\nThe 73 boat 420 Women fleet has one more day of qualification series racing tomorrow, before the top 37 boats advance to gold gleet and the remaining 36 battle it out in the silver fleet.\r\n\r\nTaking a break from Olympic campaigning in the 470 Class is Great Britain’s Jess Lavery who makes a return to the 420 in partnership with Rebecca Coles. The pair scored 3,2 today and sit in 7th overall.\r\n\r\n“It was a bit of good breeze and it was absolutely wicked on the water,” grinned Lavery, who is also a former Youth Sailor of the Year and 420 Junior European silver medallist, alongside numerous 470 successes. “It is definitely a bit different,” she continued in reference to being a 420 Class coach, adding, “I just have to make sure I beat them all!\r\n\r\n“It has been really good racing a 420 and is a great chance to get some really good tactical racing in, which is also good practice for my 470 sailing.

Elisabetta FEDELE/Beatrice MARTINI (ITA 56729) - 14 pts\r\n\r\n420 U17\r\nThe leading two teams in the U17 fleet hold firm and locked in a tiebreak of 2 points each, with Odysseas Spanakis/Konstaninos Michalopoulos (GRE) and Ange Delerce/Timothee Rossi (FRA) counting 3 race wins each.\r\n\r\n“This is my first 420 World Championship and today was a good day because we won race 4 and got third in race 3,” commented Ange Delerce. The pair might be competing at their first ever 420 Worlds, but they already have established form picking up 8th in the U17 fleet at last year’s Junior Europeans and just last week winning the U17 division in the inaugural EUROSAF 420 Race Circuit.\r\n\r\nMoving up from 10th at the start of today to 3rd at the end are Spain’s Alberto Morales/Miguel Bethencourt from scores of 2,2. Only just though, as they are also on tiebreak with Germany’s Florian Krauss/Jannis Suemmchenm in fourth.\r\n\r\n420 U17 – Top 10 after 4 Races\r\n1.
