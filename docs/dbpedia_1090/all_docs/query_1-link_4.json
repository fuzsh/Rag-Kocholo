        "text": "Joining the teams who had been pre-event training in Gran Canaria were four Spanish 470 teams who headed back from the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final in Abu Dhabi, including what turned out to be the ultimate winners of Semana Olímpica Canaria de Vela.\n\nSailing on the final day of this year’s Semana Olímpica Canaria de Vela was once again characterised by strong wind and sea conditions, which allowed all the scheduled races to be run on time. In the twenty-six boat 470 fleet, both men and women were racing together, although with separate prizes awarded.\n\nThe World #8 ranked team of Onán Barreiros/Juan Curbelo (ESP) ended their 2014 season with a victory, after a closely fought battle with Russia’s Pavel Sozykin/Denis Gribanov and Mikhail Sheremetyev/Maxim Sheremetyev with just points between them. The Spanish partnership sealed their event win in the final race.\n\nIn the women’s 470, the win went to world #16 pairing Marina Gallego/Fátima Reyes (ESP), whose scoreline included a 2nd and 4th in the open fleet. Russians Alisa Kirilyuk/Lyudmila Dmitrieva came second and the bronze went to Spain’s Ángela/Patricia Cantero. Delight for Gallego/Reyes off the back of their 7th place result in Abu Dhabi."
