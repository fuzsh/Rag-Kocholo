New Jerseyans have developed a variety of small boats. Each type meets the challenges posed by the functions intended for itas well as by local coastal conditions. The sturdy Seabright skiff was designed to push out from, ride and land through the rough ocean surf. The Jersey garvey is used for clamming in bays and estuaries. Duck hunters use the Barnegat Bay sneakbox in bays and sheltered marshes. Back Cover: Traditional French-American boat builders have developed several different kinds of regional work boats. Each has a specific use within French Louisiana's vast network of waterways. The pirogue, originally a type of Native American boat adapted and modified by French settlers, is a flat-bottomed, low-draft boat used for trapping and fishing in shallow swamps and bayous. The chaland is a small rectangular flat-bottomed boat used for cross- ing abayou. The lake skiff—a larger boat with a flat bottom, pointed bow and blunt stern — is used for fishing in bays and in large coastal and interior lakes. Mlustration by Daphne Shuttleworth 1983 Festival of American Folklife Smithsonian Institution National Park Service June 23-27, June 30-July 4 Appreciating and Protecting Our Nation’s Rich Cultural Variety I would be less than candid about this year’s program were I not to admit to a degree of personal satisfaction in seeing at the Festival both my own home state of New Jersey and the people among whom I have done graduate study abroad and domestic folklore field research in Louisiana — French and French- Americans. To all New Jerseyans and to speakers of French from all climes, we wish a hearty welcome and bien venue. The fact that 1983 marks the 200th anniversary of the Treaty of Paris, which was ratified in Princeton, New Jersey, and which formally marked the end of the American Revolutionary War, testifies to the depth of our friendship with our ally and to the historic importance of the Garden State. But seeing “one’s own” represented at the Festival is only a small part of what we are about. The idea that shapes this year’s program — and any year’s program, for that matter — is the Smithsonian Institution’s abiding commitment to cultural conservation. The traditions you see represented have been brought to the National Mall not only for your enjoyment and intellectual edification, but also as a statement to the people who keep the traditions, to their communities and to the great American public that these cultural traditions are more than the artistic flowering of a healthy community. They are often the very roots of a group’s cultural identity, community feeling, and shared sense of style and, as such, are crucial to its well-being and productivity. They are certainly among those worthy of our interest and support. A concern for the continued existence of folk traditions has motivated the Festival project since it began in 1967. It has also served as the basis of our cooperation with the Folk Arts program of the National Endowment for the Arts, a cooperation that resulted last year in a Festival program honoring the recipients of NEA’s National Heritage Award. This year will see a similar program, and we hope that future years will as well. The bicentennial of manned flight, aptly turning our attention to France once again, gives us occasion to recognize the occupational folklife traditions that have grown, even as the technology of flight has evolved. These traditions help aviation workers give meaning to their occupational lives and ultimately serve us all by helping them perform with a sense of unity and purpose. We hope you find entertainment in the beautiful and significant traditions presented at this year’s Festival and that you come to understand their impor- tance in the lives of the performers and their communities. We also hope you will join with us in making our nation an environment in which myriad cultural traditions can flourish.

Dillon Ripley Secretary, Smithsonian Institution This year’s Festival is aptly delineated in a word coined by Horace Walpole (1717-1797) to name the happy discoveries one often makes unintentionally while in pursuit of another seemingly unrelated goal. Derived from an Iranian fairytale of three Sri Lankan princes who continually discover, by chance or by wit, things for which they were not searching, “serendipity” (from Serendip, an old name for Ceylon or Sri Lanka) describes the creative connections that have come to light among this year’s four apparently unrelated Festival programs: French and French-American traditions, New Jersey traditions, the Folklife of Flight, and the National Heritage Awards of the National Endowment for the Arts. A moment's reflection by those with an historical eye will trace the link between France and New Jersey through the 200th anniversary of the Treaty of Paris which formally brought the American Revolutionary War to conclusion and which was ratified by the Continental Congress then meeting in Princeton. Ona similar historical trajectory, one’s mind surveys the span between the culture of present-day American aviation workers and the beginnings of manned flight two hundred years ago in France in the balloon of the Montgol- fier brothers. And the final link to be discovered among the programs — one which truly turned up like a treasure to a royal Sri Lankan personage ona quest — is Dewey Williams, a National heritage Award winner from Alabama, who makes a yearly journey northward to lend his voice and spirit to an annual celebration of the continuing cultural ties that connect his community in the South with some of its members who have relocated in New Jersey. Dewey Williams’ festive community celebration, together with a re-created Montgolfier balloon, French and French-American performers and craftspeople, New Jerseyans who keep the rich traditions of their state, and present-day aviation workers will, I feel sure, uncover for you even more delightful serendipities during your visit to the 1983 Festival of American Folklife. Our American Cultural Heritage: Old World Traditions in the New World by Russell E. Dickenson, Director, National Park Service The National Park Service welcomes you to the annual Festival of American Folklife. We are pleased to co-sponsor with the Smithsonian Institution this celebration of our nation’s heritage. The Festival site is the National Mall, which is administered by the National Park Service. The Mall is one of the more than 330 areas administered by the National Park Service; it is particularly significant that the Festival is held on such lands, as National Parks are set aside to provide a full representation of the American story and to relate the achievements, customs and cultures of its people. The Festival serves this purpose, telling the American story through music, crafts and celebrations. The National Mall was set aside in 1790 under the L’Enfant Plan for the city of Washington. Extending from the Capitol to the Washington Monument, the Mall comprises 146 acres and is bordered by dynamic monuments, memorials and magnificent museums and art galleries which pay tribute to America’s place in the arts, sciences and history, and reflect the cumulative genius of its people. This year’s Festival will focus on the cultural traditions of the state of New Jersey, the nation of France, and the communities in this country where French traditions are still strong. Visitors will have the opportunity to see how Old World traditions meld with their New World counterparts to form our cherished American cultural heritage. We hope your visit will be enjoyable and will include a few moments to partake of the natural beauty found in the parks of our Nation’s Capital. SN The National Heritage Fellowships Program has been made possible through the collaboration and cooperation of the National Endowment for the Arts, the Smithsonian Institution, and Continental Telecom Inc. Bess Lomax Hawes is the Director of the Folk Arts Program of the National Endow- ment for the Arts.

Her publications include with co-author Bessie Jones, Step It Down: Games, Plays, Songs, and Stories from the Afro-American Heritage. Sister Mildred Barker Shaker Hymn Singet Maine Photo: John V. Goff National Heritage Fellowships Program by Bess Lomax Hawes Only a year ago, the Folk Arts Program at the National Endowment for the Arts joined with the Smithsonian Institution’s Office of Folklife Programs to present fifteen outstanding American artists with the very first National Herit- age Fellowships in the nation’s history. These fellowships were signalled by a certificate of honor hailing each of the fifteen as “a Master Traditional Artist who has contributed to the shaping of our artistic traditions and to preserving the cultural diversity of the United States.” The event represented this nation’s especial adaptation of the seminal Japa- nese concept of “living cultural treasures.” In inaugurating such a program in the United States, some accommodation was necessary to encompass the enormous range of artistic traditions that have entered this country during two hundred years of immigration. So rather than be exclusive we determined to revel in these big numbers, to rejoice in their great variety. Writing in the summer of 1982, we said of the first year’s fellowships: Each year [forward] we will greet, salute, and honor just a few examples of the dazzling array of artistic traditions we have inherited throughout our nation’s fortunate history. Each year, we will happily present yet another assortment of splendid master American folk artists and artisans who represent still different artistic forms and traditions. We believe that this can continue far into the future. . . Now the first anniversary in that future has rolled around, and we can present the second year’s nominations — a group of sixteen artists of equivalent excel- lence and perhaps even greater variety. A startling company, every one of them exhibits an authentic talent honed to brilliance by experience, passion, practice, and that exhausting relentless drive to “do it right.” Each “right” way, of course, represents a distillation of a particular group of people’s aesthetic choices over time, their especial picture of themselves as they most want to be seen. In presenting these sixteen superb traditional artists, then, we present the most elegant and creative aspects of sixteen segments of that part of humankind that has assembled together as citizens of the United States. It is a great joy. For this year of 1983, we commend to your attention: Sister Mildred Barker, the principal conservator of the song tradition of the Shaker Society, that tiny group whose intense concern for the aesthetic dimension has been evidenced as well through its distinctive furniture, archi- tecture, textile design, dance and music. Sister Barker, possessed of an accurate ear and a voice of great sweetness, has devoted much of her long life to her beloved Shaker music of which she is performer, librarian, scholar and music teacher all in one. Rafael Cepeda — a name synonymous with the indigenous Afro-Puerto Rican musical traditions known as bomba and plena. For over fifty years, with his wife, his three daughters, and his eight sons, Don Rafael’s “Familia Cepeda” has preserved and presented the complex drumming, dance steps, vocal im- provisation, and many-layered rhythmic pulses of bomba y plena to audiences across the island of Puerto Rico. Ray Hicks, story teller — since the dawn of history a most honorable pursuit. Ray’s stories, handed down through generations in his mountain family, tell about the little boy Jack, the one who killed the giant, chopped down the beanstalk, outwitted ogres, wild hogs and robbers, and served his mother and his King. Ray tells them masterfully in the Appalachian style of his forebears and in the telling brings alive the epic cycles of magic and adventure known in old Europe and around the world. Stanley Hicks, who stands with his cousin Ray as representative of the creative traditions that flourish in the close-knit families of Appalachia. He is a man that can “turn his hand to anything,” from making finely crafted dulcimers and banjos on which to pick dance tunes and sorrow songs to telling ghost stories and children’s tales. He sings the old ballads too, and when he can’t sit still any longer, he jumps up to dance the flat-footed “jumping jack” style he learned long ago. He reminds us of our grandfathers in the days when every man had to be not just a bread-winner but a teacher, philosopher, judge, and handyman, creating a whole life out of the wilderness. John Lee Hooker, who, according to the critic Tony Glover is part of a “rapidly thinning group, the first line of the post war bluesmen... standing as a link between the field hollers of old and the smack-soul of today. As long as men like Hooker are alive, so too will be the blues that was born in Missis- sippi.. . Its more than a musical style, it’s a tribute to the human spirit . . . Hooker is one of the giants.” Miguel Manteo, today holding the coveted title of “Papa Manteo,” the fifth in the line. He represents five generations of Sicilian-American puppeteers and the world of characters from the courtly chivalric past they bring to life from the ancient scripts detailing the epic adventures of Charlemagne and his knights. The Manteo Sicilian Marionette Theatre is a national treasure, alive, well, and flourishing in the heart of Brooklyn; Papa Manteo is its memory, its artistic conscience, and its star. Narciso Martinez, the pioneer of the button accordion, the expressive heart of the Texas-Mexican conjunto musical tradition. In the 19th century on small town bandstands across central and southern Texas, Czechoslovakian, Anglo, German and Mexican musicians swapped tunes, texts and musical ideas. Today the huapangos, redowas, polkas, and waltzes of “Don Chicho” Martinez bear happy witness to that fruitful period of musical interaction. They stand witness as well to the creative genius of the Texas-Mexican musicians who carved this new musical style out of the thorny southwestern landscape. Lanier Meaders, Georgia potter, a second generation craftsman whose strong straightforward shapes and pied alkaline glazes represent a tradition of creativity that stretches beyond Georgia into the larger pottery complex of the eastern seacoast states. Meaders’ earth-brown, olive-green and rusty-grey stonewear pieces have a vitality that bespeaks the self-sufficient frontier spirit; his signature face jugs demonstrate the wit and sophistication common to so many country people. Almeda James Riddle — the great lady of Ozark balladry. She once listed a hundred songs she could call to mind right then, and added that she could add another hundred to the list if she had the time. “Granny,” as she prefers to be called, sings in the unaccompanied way of southern ballad singers, and uses a decorated singing style of great antiquity, frilled with falsetto leaps, breaks, and vocal ornamentation. Her repertoire is extraordinary; her singing impeccable. Joe Shannon who plays the willeann (elbow) pipes of Ireland, one of the most technically complex musical instruments ever invented by man. A re- tired Chicago firefighter, Joe Shannon took up the pipes of his childhood in his later years to become the Irish American virtuoso on this extraordinary instru- ment. His performances are crammed with ornamentation of all kinds, each tune a stunning showpiece of epic proportions. Simon St. Pierre — lumberjack, fiddler, and acknowledged master of French-Canadian dance music. His reels and two-steps are exemplary, his rare Canadian waltz melodies elegant renditions of that complex tradition. In many of his tunes he accompanies himself with foot clogging, a practice common among old-time French-Canadian fiddlers that adds verve and energy and drive and spins the dancers down the floor. Alex Stewart, cooper and woodworker. He can make anything that can be made out of wood, he will tell you, and without using either glue or nails. He has made countless bowls, ladles, chairs, swings, tables, spinning wheel parts. But the strong lines of the traditional shapes of the cooper’s art — his barrels, buckets, piggins and churns, so elegantly crafted, so ingeniously joined — are the objects that remain longest in the memory and make you Rafael Cepeda Bomba and Plena Musician and Dancer Puerto Rico Photo: Luis Reyes Ray Hicks Appalachian Storyteller North Carolina Photo: Jack Schrader Stanley Hicks Appalachian Instrument Maker, Musician and Storyteller North Carolina Photo: Carroll Reece Museum, Johnson City, Tennessee John Lee Hooker Blues Guitarist/Singer Mississippi and California Photo: Marina Fusco Miguel “Papa” Manteo Sicilian-American Puppeteer New York Photo: Martha Cooper Narciso Martinez lexas-Mexican Conjunto Accordianist Texas Photo: Carlos Chavez Chamizal National Memorial, El Paso, Texas understand why the honest craftsmanship of Alex Stewart is honored the length and breadth of Tennessee. Ada Thomas, one of the remaining masters of double-weave basketry in the Chitimacha tribe of Louisiana. Chitimacha split cane work — long recognized for its extraordinary elegance — is intricately patterned with dyed strips of red, yellow, and black in designs taken from nature — “blackbird’s eye,” “rabbit teeth” and “mouse tracks.” Museum collections are fortunate to con- tain one of Ada Thomas's pieces, as she is one of the few nowadays who can handle the complex technique by which the inside and outside baskets are woven as one. Lucinda Toomer, a Black quilter from southwestern Georgia. Maude Wahlman, scholar of Afro-American quilting, writes, “She will not duplicate the same pattern in successive quilt blocks but chooses to take one pattern and manipulate it in multiple ways. Her visual improvisations establish Lucinda as an artist in total control of her art form in the same way that thematic musical improvisations indicate a master jazz musician.” Her work is dazzling, a superb example of the virtuosity to be found in the traditional arts. Lem Ward, who with his late brother, Stephen Ward, brought the making of duck decoys, once a purely functional traditional craft, into a widely acknowledged and formalized ornamental art form. Their seminal explorations into varying poses, positions, shapes, and painting techniques increased the range of effects available to all woodcarvers, and inspired hundreds of crafts- men to develop ever more realistic and elegant bird carving. Dewey P. Williams, the acknowledged master and patriarch of the Black Sacred Harp singing tradition of southeast Alabama. For forty years he has been “tuner” for his singing convention — a position reserved for the most competent singers. His vivid personality, engaging enthusiasm for his music, and compelling vocal style have helped keep an important aesthetic tradition alive. We are all in his debt. These, then, are the sixteen artists nominated in this year of 1983 — each of them exemplary, each of them representing another fragment of brilliant color in the American mosaic. And behind each stands a phalanx of other creative Americans, that reaches across neighborhoods and back through time. They are the ones from whom our honorees learned, the ones who made the mistakes, tested the limits, confirmed the aesthetic centers. In honoring our sixteen artists, we also honor their forebears, and this is, perhaps, the glory of the National Heritage Fellowships, that each one represents not a single creative genius but a linkage of people joined together to produce beauty and truth and meaning, each in their own special way. The National Endowment for the Arts’ National Heritage Fellowships will be awarded annually. The Folk Arts Program of the National Endowment for the Arts welcomes nominations for the 1984 Heritage Fellowships. Please send your nomination to the following address by October 31, 1983 — Folk Arts Program, National Endowment for the Arts, 1100 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20500.

Kean to fund New Jersey's participation in the 17th Annual Festival of American Folklife. LO New Jersey Folklife: An Overview by David S. Cohen When most people think about folklore, they think about some place other than New Jersey. Folklore is commonly identified with rural settings, and New Jersey is basically urban, suburban, and industrial. There are some rural areas in New Jersey — the truck farms of “the Garden State” and the Pine Barrens of South Jersey — but the former are fast disappearing and the latter survive only because they are preserved by the state. Most New Jerseyans live and work in the densely populated corridor that cuts across the mid-section of the state. But folklorists today recognize that there is also a folklore of the factory, a folklore of the city, and a folklore of ethnicity, and New Jersey provides a rich source for their study. While New Jersey was one of the first states to industrialize, its earliest industries were rural, not urban. The colonial iron industry was located in the mountains in the north and the bogs in the south, and there are still some today who know the art of producing charcoal — the fuel used in these early iron furnaces. Glass blowing was another rural industry in South Jersey, although abandoned iron-mining and glass-blowing towns in the Pine Barrens are New Jersey's ghost towns of today. There was plenty of opportunity for industrial and labor lore to develop early in New Jersey. In 1792 Alexander Hamilton and some businessmen founded the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures in order to develop Paterson as the first American industrial city. In the nineteenth century Paterson became a center of silk manufacturing in America. Newark developed a leather and tan- ning industry, and Trenton had the John A. Roebling Iron Works. The industrial development of the state was aided by the construction in the early nineteenth century of two canals — the Morris Canal across North Jersey and the Delaware and Raritan Canal across Central Jersey. The “tiller sharks” (boatmen) on the canals developed their own occupational folklore. Even today some scholars perceive a high-technology folklore in the form of jokes circulated in offices by copying machines and noncopyrighted games played on computers. The streets of New Jersey’s cities abound with traditional life as practiced for generations. One need only to walk through Hoboken or Bayonne to see children playing stick ball, hop scotch, and Double Dutch jump rope. Paterson has a farmers’ market where vendors peddle their produce. In “The Burg” (the Italian-American neighborhood in Trenton) one can see people sitting on their stoops visiting and talking with their neighbors. In fact, New Jersey even offers a rich variety of suburban folklore, which includes such diverse genres as jokes told by housewives at coffee klatsches, bridal showers and Tupperware parties, and masquerading by teenagers at the “Rocky Horror Picture Show.” New Jersey is populated by a large number of ethnic groups, many of which have clustered in city neighborhoods. There is a Cuban community in Union City, a Portuguese community in Newark, a Hungarian community in New Brunswick, and a Japanese community in rural Seabrook Farms. They are not the only ethnic groups in their locales, but they are the largest and give the neighborhood its identity, often reflected in foreign language signs in stores and restaurants. For many ethnic groups folk traditions are their symbols of identity. Their ethnicity is expressed in foodways, language, music, dance, and festivals (often in ethnic costume ). Some festivals, such as those presented weekly each summer at the Garden State Arts Center, are designed to present ethnic traditions to the public at large. Others, such as Italian-American saints’ festivals, are intended primarily for the members of the community, although the public is welcome. Such American expressions of ethnicity differ from those in the Old World, having been adapted to new settings. Music, such as Ukrainian troyisti muzyky (trio music), once performed informally at weddings, is now formally presented on a stage at a public festival with dancers in folk costume. Craft traditions that used to be a vital part of rural economy in the mother country are now miniaturized and made into a hobby. Blacks comprise one ethnic group in New Jersey with a particularly varied history. Because New Jersey had slavery, there are some Black families (many of whom have Dutch surnames) who can trace their ancestry to these New Jersey slaves and free Blacks. Most Blacks in New Jersey came north as part of the Great Migration during World War I. To their number were added West Indian Blacks, such as Haitians, Jamaicans, and Afro-Cubans. There are also two enclave populations in New Jersey — the Ramapo Moun- tain People, who descend from free Blacks who were culturally Dutch, and the Pineys, who used to live isolated in the Pine Barrens. The origin of both groups have been forgotten and legends have taken the place of history. While the past of the Ramapo Mountain People has been reconstructed, that of the Pineys is yet to be researched. New Jersey was once two colonies — East Jersey and West Jersey. The bound- ary line ran from a point of the upper Delaware River to the mouth of Little Egg Harbor on the Atlantic. There is still a distinct difference between North Jersey and South Jersey which is reflected in the major linguistic distinction between the Inland Northern and Midland dialects. In the north a small stream is called a “brook,” while in the south it is often called a “run.” There is also a difference in folk furniture styles; for instance, between North Jersey ladderback chairs, which resemble those from New England, and the South Jersey versions (such as those of generations of the Ware family of Cumberland County), which resemble chairs from Pennsylvania. There is even a difference between the split oak baskets made in South Jersey and the variety of basket types made in North Jersey. Beyond this basic north-south division, New Jersey is characterized by many other folk cultural regions. Red sandstone farmhouses with bell-shaped roofs, Dutch barns, and hay barracks (hay stacks with moveable roofs) define the Dutch culture areas in the northeast. Pattern-ended brick farmhouses and “plain-style” (simply decorated) meeting houses delimit the Quaker culture area in the southwest. Log houses and split-level bank barns reflect the Penn- sylvania German culture area in the northwest. Wood-frame saltbox houses and wing-headed tombstone carvings mark the Puritan influence in the north- central region. There is also a maritime cultural complex along the New Jersey Shore. It can be seen in such indigenous New Jersey boat types as the Sea Bright skiff (used in pound net fishing), the garvey (used in clamming), the sneakbox (used in duck hunting ), and the schooner (used in oystering ). Also part of the maritime tradition is the art of decoy carving, perhaps New Jersey's most famous folk art. There are still “mudwallopers,’ who make their living from trapping in the wetlands bordering on Delaware Bay. Because of its small size and complexity, people have concluded that the state lacks an identity. The identity of New Jersey, however, is found in the very diversity of its folklife. David S. Cohen is Coordinator of the Folk- life Program at the New Jersey Historical Commission and has written on New Jersey folklore and local history.

Whether salty, brackish, or fresh, water is everywhere in evidence — molding the state’s contours and toponymy, its technology and character. It appears under many guises, as bogs, rivers, swamps, marshes, bays, inlets, cripples, spongs, puddles, spillways, and watersheds. The names for some of these are the sole reminders of the American Indians who first attended to them, names like Metedeconk, Manasquan, Hopatcong, Raritan, and Kittattiny. Other names for water places — Bivalve, Camden, Port Republic, Barnegat Light, Keansburg, Atlantic City, Sandy Hook, Tuckerton, Asbury Park, Whitesbog — reflect more recent waves of settlement and events — the oyster industry, shipbuilding companies, the Coast Guard, Captain Kidd, tourism, legalized gambling, World War I, prohibition and rumrunning, Bruce Springsteen, and the nation’s first culti- vated blueberries. While North Jersey's cultural face generally bears the imprint of places in far-flung parts of the globe, much of South Jersey’s portrait emerges as part of the people’s response to the resources there. Perhaps most basic of all those resources is water. The coastal plains have been compared, in fact, to a giant sponge, through which water circulates freely, surfacing as fresh water in the swamps, as brackish water in the salt marshes (locally called “meadows” ), and as salt water in the bays. Residents of the coastal plains circulate with ease among the different settings, harvesting the resources they need, as the seasons and economy permit. Having “worked the cycle” for hundreds of years, South Jerseyans have been named by those resources — as baymen, woodsmen, mudwallopers, clamdiggers, and pineys — and have bequeathed to the state a rich legacy of folk technology and literature. The tides are omnipresent — the implied backdrop for the maritime tradi- tions displayed at this year’s Festival on the National Mall. The tide is present in the chanty “blowing” of the menhaden fishermen from Port Norris and in the glass pitchers blown at Millville; in the duck “stools” (decoys) carved on Barnegat Bay and in the salt hay twisted into rope on Delaware Bay. Its imprint is borne by the Jersey Garvey — that square-bowed, indigenous work boat used by clammerts. It is even present, some would say, in the faces of clammers weathered by salt spray flung up during vigorous swells. The moon, naturally, must be credited in part. Not the blue moon of Kentucky, or the Ozark moon of Arkansas, but the Jersey moon, of which Clifford Eayre has written: Rising up from the sea, she is grander to me, Than a thousand worlds dri ‘ting by. As she floats o’er the bay, she is well on her way ‘To her throne high in the sky. Hiding myriads of stars to the tune of guitars, That’s when all true lovers fall — For the mellow moon of old New Jersey Is the grandest moon of all. The moon, exerting its influence on the Atlantic Ocean, assisted in the past with the harvest of menhaden fish. Also known as “mossbunkers,” “alewives,” and “pogies,” they swim in enormous schools all along the Atlantic seaboard. y@ Before hydraulic pumps were introduced in the 1950s to bring fish aboard, the — a harvest was accomplished through the synchronization of men, music, and the sea itself. In the chanties the rhythms of the sea are fused with the rhythms of traditional Afro-American work songs, and the stories of the fishermen themselves. Robert Ames, of Port Norris, recalls the importance of the different rhythms in accomplishing the work: There’s no way in the world that thirty-two men can raise eighty ton of fish, unless they do it in a way that the sea helps them. . . You know what they say? When you're down there holdin’ on, they say, “Hold on, boys,” say, “Wait a minute,” say, “The sea’ll give it to you.” After awhile, she'll go down on a swell — she'll lighten up. The chanty leader was of special importance. He led the songs that, as Robert Ames tells it, gave the fishermen the power to raise those tons of fish: You know what a chanty man is? A chanty man is just someone on the boat that’s old and knows how to make rhythms for you — and make you feel good and make the work easier. He don’t have to be no captain, he don’t have to be no mate — just somebody with a lot of experience that likes to sing. In the songs, the working men played, invoking justice, for example, on the much resented captain and his mate: Captain, don’t you see? Dark cloud risin’ over yonder — Sign of rain, Lord, Lord, sign of rain. Captain, don’t you know, the whole damn crew is goin’ to leave you — Sign of rain, Lord, Lord, sign of rain. The products of South Jersey's different waters are intricately connected. Oil from menhaden fish was used to melt Jersey sand — a product of the tide’s relentless pounding on granite — to produce the celebrated Jersey gall glass. Sand was used as an insulator in the making of charcoal, another fuel used in the glass houses. Oysters were soaked in cedar water for flavoring, and Jersey Cedar, the swamp’s gift to the boatbuilder, drifts through the brackish estuaries in the form of Barnegat sneakboxes and duck decoys. Much of the material culture found on the coastal plains is unique to New Jersey. While ducks, for example, are found throughout the world, only in New Jersey were they first greeted with Barnegat sneakboxes and decoys. The sneakbox, an ingenious gunning skiff with multiple functions ranging froma sailboat to a stationary duck blind, fits hand-in-glove with the salt marshes of South Jersey. It is small enough that one man can pull it over land, and its spoon-shaped hull enables it to glide through areas marked as land on coastal Pe ie bd 7 Menhaden fishermen haul in their catch off the Atlantic coast, ca. 1955.

Its draft is so shallow that it could, as the saying goes, “follow a mule as it sweats up a dusty road.” Its accesssories include ice-hoods, for both “porridge” (slushy) and “pane” (hard) ice, and its hinged oarlocks and removable decoy rack promote the absence of profile so essential when it comes to fooling ducks, Jersey style. The Barnegat decoy, renowned for its dugout construction, is linked in tradition with the sneakbox. Duck stools in South Jersey, it is claimed, were hollowed out in order that several dozen could be carried on a sneakbox without overburdening it. While few men continue to make the classic sneakboxes and decoys, the artifacts have become emblems of a regional way of life — appearing on T-shirts, as miniatures in gift shops, and in local business establishments as decoration. When a South Jerseyan is not trapping for “marsh rabbits” (muskrats) in the meadows, or working the bay for clams, crabs, or oysters, he might turn inland to the fresh waters to supplement his income. There he can assist with the cranberry harvest, or gather a variety of plants to supply to the florist industry, or trap with fyke nets for “snappers.” The snapping turtle, that strange primor- dial beast that God made last, is featured as often in stories as it is in soups. “Every kind of meat there is,” reports Chatsworth’s Johnny Broome, can be found in a snapping turtle. You know why that is, don’t you? Because when God made the world and he made all the animals, he had a bunch of parts left over. So he threw all those together and made the snapping turtle. One trapper in South Jersey used to elicit gasps from his neighbors by kissing live snappers on their noses. While clams rank as one of New Jersey's most prolific maritime resources, New Jersey’s overall portrait is far more enhanced by the clamdigger himself. The old-time clamdigger — a figure extant in people’s memories since before the turn of the century — is often portrayed as an invincible, solitary, usually irascible but always beloved character. He is commonly seen working the bay with scratch rake and tongs from his garvey. While his life may be governed by the caprices of the tides, the weather, the economy, government policy, and the clams themselves, there is one thing it seems he can control: his self- portrait. Merce Ridgway, a Waretown clamdigger, celebrates his lot to the tune of “Frankie and Johnny.” Now, some people think a clamdigger, He’s got it mighty fine — Ridin’ along in his old work boat In the good old summertime. It's a beautiful day, Out on Barnegat Bay. Now, if you should chance to go closer, You'd see that he’s wrinkled and lined, From the rain and the snow, The wind that blows, But he don’t seem to mind Yeah, he’s sure got it fine — He goes all the time. In Tuckerton (nicknamed “Clamtown’), in Mazzarelli’s Tavern, hangs per- haps one of the most moving portraits. The subject of the painting is a patron of the tavern, Jeff Allen, a man who lays claim to the title of “old-time clamdigger.” The painter, Win Salmons, also a bayman, explained that Jimmy Mazzarelli had commissioned him to paint Jeff's portrait because he thought so much of him. Noting local responses to the painting, Salmons explained: The little smile he has is typical of his character and many people along the shore and the beach came over to see the painting, and when they saw, they said, “Why, that’s Jeff!” When Jeff came in to see it, he had a red hat on, and he saw it, and he smiled and walked over and he hung his hat on the painting and left it there for weeks! There may be other places in the world with salt marshes, moons, clamdiggers and Jeffs, perhaps even with the same names. But the face of South Jersey differs, as its features are chronicled in the stories, songs, artifacts, recipes and portraits that ensure that this place is the only one of its kind.

Gillespie The cuisine of New Jersey reflects the diversity of its ethnic population. Thus it is futile to suggest any one dish as “typical” of New Jersey, for one can find Cuban food in Union City, Portuguese food in Newark, Jewish food in West Orange, and Hungarian food in New Brunswick. In fact, nearly any ethnic cuisine one can think of is prepared and consumed on a daily basis somewhere in New Jersey. Most people who have attempted to characterize New Jersey's cuisine have focused on this rich ethnic diversity. There is another way, however, to view the topic — through a regional approach. New Jersey stretches from the mountains in the northwest through the urban corridor in the center to the Pine Barrens in the south. South Jersey is particularly different, lacking the population density of the rest of the state. In the middle of the Eastern Megalopolis the Pine Barrens — ironically named since they comprise a vast wilderness forest of oak and pine, occupying nearly a quarter of the state. A few of the people who live in this area have been there for many generations, some of them tracing their family history to pre- Revolutionary days. These people have evolved a distinct lifestyle; their way of life is based on a small community in a rural setting which has been relatively isolated for many years. As a result, their culture is very tightly knit and homogeneous. Outsiders, who had difficulty understanding these people, called them, derisively, “Pineys.” But in recent years the people themselves have embraced the term and now accept it with pride. Part of what makes the Piney distinctive is his commitment to self-sufficiency. The true Piney is fiercely proud of his ability to survive without being dependent on a regular employer. He may accept seasonal employment from time to time, but he remains fundamentally his own boss, free to walk off the job at any time. How does he manage to achieve this enviable freedom? Largely through his self-reliance which comes from an ability to live off the land. In practical terms, the South Jersey Piney relies on three resources — hunting, fishing, and gardening. To achieve success in these three realms depends upon an intimate knowledge of his landscape, and while the typical Piney may not have money in the bank, he usually has food on the table — and remarkably good fare at that. Over the years, the Piney has developed ways of preparing the food which he wrests from his environment. Fortunately for us, these recipes have been recently compiled by Arlene Martin Ridgway, who put them together in a book with the whimsical title, Chicken Foot Soup and Other Recipes from the Pine Barrens.' Here are three of them. The absolute mainstay of the Piney diet is venison. To the extent that the Piney can provide for his family by hunting game, he is independent of the supermarket. To the Piney, the deer hunt is not for sport; it is a ritual of survival. Deer Stew 2 pounds of deer meat, cut in 2-inch cubes Pepper 1 cup water 1 large onion, chopped, or 4 or 5 small whole white onions, peeled 3 medium potatoes, cut in quarters 3 carrots, cut in half lengthwise and in half again ' Printed with the permission of the Rutgers University Press. Sprinkle meat with pepper. Add other ingredients and cook covered until tender on low heat. Thicken with flour and water. Serves 6 (recipe courtesy of Mildred Arnold Winton, Barnegat, New Jersey) Fortunately for the Piney, he is never far away from a large body of water — either the Barnegat Bay or the Atlantic Ocean. Hence he can nearly always supplement his diet of game with clams, oysters and fish. Clamming and fishing are just part of growing up in the Pines, the skills passed along from father to son and the recipes from mother to daughter. Baked Bluefish 1 3-pound bluefish Bacon strips Stuffing: 2 slices dry bread, broken 1 small onion, finely minced 1 tablespoon butter Salt Pepper Onion salt Pinch of garlic salt Preheat oven to 350°. Clean and wash out bluefish well. Gore it to make openings for stuffing. Before stuffing fish, place in pan. Stuff fish and place bacon strips on the outside of the fish. Put 1 or 2 cups water in pan and bake for 1 hour. Serves 6 (recipe courtesy of Myrtle Taylor Ridgway, New Gretna, New Jersey) Even more reliable than hunting and fishing as a source for meals is the fam- ily garden. The land in the Pine Barrens is too sandy for large-scale commercial agriculture (except for cranberries and blueberries ), but it does lend itself well to the carefully cultivated small garden plot. This is not the casual weekend recreational activity we associate with the suburban gardener, for many of the gardening techniques are traditional rather than modern. For example, there is no reliance on commercial pesticides; instead, pests are removed individually by hand. A typical garden recipe distinctive of the region is the following: Turnip and “Tater” Stew 2 medium turnips, peeled and cut in 1-inch chunks 3 medium potatoes, peeled and cut in 1-inch chunks 8 ¥-inch thick slices salt pork 1 medium onion, diced 1 medium carrot, cut in '4-inch slices Y, green pepper, cut in 1-inch pieces 1 stalk celery, cut in 1-inch pieces 1 large clove garlic, minced Salt Pepper Sugar Seafood seasoning Dash gravy seasoning 3 teaspoons cornstarch Boil turnips and taters in water together until tender. While they cook, place salt pork in a cast-iron pan over medium heat. When enough grease has melted out and the salt pork is nicely browned, saute the rest of the vegetables together in the salt pork grease for approximately 10 minutes. When the turnips and taters are done, drain and add them to the rest of the mixture. Add just enough water to cover. Season with salt, pepper, sugar, seafood and gravy seasonings. Simmer approximately 25 minutes. When done, thicken with corn- starch dissolved in half a cup of water.

These threads combine to form the length, or warp, or the woven fabric. From the collection of The American Labor Museum Workers in the Silk: An Exploration of the Paterson. Silk Industry by John A. Herbst and Thomas D. Carroll Workers in the Paterson silk industry in the first third of this century sought employment there for two basic reasons: money and family. When asked why she had decided to enter the trade, one worker replied, “because it paid more money.” But she was also able to obtain a position in the mill because her father was a weaver there. Whatever their incentives to enter the trade, once hired, workers tended to remain at their jobs for a long time. New workers, especially those in semi- skilled positions, were generally trained by their supervisors. More highly skilled positions, such as that of weaver, usually required a more traditional form of training. One worker remembered that her father, a Jacquard weaver, had said: “You come down to work with me. Pll teach you to weave.” So I went down, and that’s where I learned to weave. Then they give me my own loom. This transmission of skill from parent to child seems to have been common practice in the Paterson silk industry. Paterson had achieved prominence in the nineteenth century as one of the great industrial cities in America. Centered around the Great Falls of the Passaic River, it grew as the nation’s first planned industrial center. It was sponsored in 1792 by Alexander Hamilton through the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures (S.U.M.), a private corporation which was to carry out Hamilton’s vision of an industrial nation. Hamilton and the $.U.M. began the creation of what was to become a powerful city of industry. Connected by a three tiered water-power system designed by Pierre L’Enfant, architect of Washington, D.C., Patersons’s nine- teenth century mills produced textiles, Colt revolvers, machinery, and locomotives. The city also became the major producer of silk in the United States, and it was this industry which had a pervasive effect on the population, for everyone had ties to the manufacture of this esteemed textile. By 1870, Paterson was famous as the “Silk City of the New World” or the “Lyons of America,” after the famous silk center of Europe in France. By 1876 more than 8,000 people worked in the silk industry; by 1910 their numbers had increased to more than 20,000. In contrast to other industries, which relied on unskilled laborers, the silk process required workers specialized in the techniques of warping and weaving. To fill this need, immigrants began arriving from European textile centers where their families had woven cotton, silk, wool, or linen for generations. Thus residents of Paterson today can trace their ancestry back to Macclesfield and Coventry in England, Belfast in Ireland, Krefeld in Germany, Biella and Commo in Italy, or Lodz in Poland. Families leaving these centers shared a common experience of protest against the industrialization of their craft. In the Old World, cottage or work- shop based craftspeople had held artisan positions with high status in their society. The gradual move to the factory system resulted not only in the displacement of workers through increased mechanization of the textile process, but a loss of economic independence and social standing for them as well. Consequently Paterson silk workers of varying nationalities shared an Openness to trade unionism. Arriving in Paterson, immigrants joined other families from their homelands in neighborhoods and streetcar suburbs of the city. The names of these ethnic enclaves reflect the occupations and countries of origin of the workers: Weaver- town, Dublin, Belgium Hill, Little Italy, and Little Holland. From tenements, private homes and company housing, workers left before dawn to begin their 10-12 hour day, six days a week in one of the 300 mills of Silk City. While on the job, mill workers wore good shoes for support because they were on their feet all day. They also changed clothing when they arrived at the mill and put on aprons, because oil and grease from the machinery would other- wise stain shirts and dresses. Additionally, female workers wore their hair short or kept it tied up high on their heads, since long hair and even apron strings could be caught by the drive belt or drawn into the loom mechanism itself. The mill environment, though clean and well-lit, was very noisy. One woman remembers going to visit her mother, who was a warper: “I used to hate to go through that mill, it was so noisy. I used to say, ‘Mom, how could you stand it?’ ” To cope with the noise “we had to talk loud, but you could talk over the machine.” Interaction among the workers was nevertheless limited, as the nature of the work demanded their close and constant attention, and because they were paid on a piecework system, which linked their wages directly to the amount of goods they produced. The worker was also aware of the importance of her place as a teamworker in the larger process of production. As one quill-winder noted when asked about the consequences of falling behind in her work, “Well, then, the weaver wouldn’t get his quills... his quills ran out at a certain time and he had to have the board ready for him to renew.” While on the job, most workers carried with them a small pair of scissors about two inches long, often in the pocket of their apron but usually in their hand: “You had the scissors in your hand all day long. . . little bitsy things, and you always had it on your finger.” Weavers also worked with other tools, which were laid before them on the loom: “The loom had a board across it, and it had a little groove in it. And you kept your pick and your shuttle-threader and your hook there.” The pick was used to remove flaws from the woven fabric, the shuttle-threader to position the silk that formed the weft, and the hook to pull broken threads of the warp through the reed. Weavers often had to make minor adjustments on the loom, as did other workers who tended the machinery in the mill: “You worked on a mechanical loom, and you got used to things that happened.” While a loomfixer patrolled the floor constantly, sometimes stopping to chat with the operators, in trouble- some cases, he would be summoned to solve the more complicated mechani- cal problems. c. 1880's A Jacquard loom fixed with a special punched card which programmed the design, and permitted the weaving of complicated patterns into fabric.

Picking up the Linen Threads; A Study in Industrial Folklore Austin: The Univerity of Texas Press, 1978 20 The machinery was, however, generally viewed favorably and even with pride by the mill workers, for accidents in the mills were few and usually not serious. When speaking of the power loom, one worker admiringly observed that “the mechanism was really a work of art.” Just as the machine was admired, so was the weaver, a position to which many less highly-skilled workers aspired. One woman who had been a quill-winder and subsequently a weaver described her feelings about the promotion succinctly: “You felt like you had accomplished something if you could master weaving on one of those looms. Because they were complicated, you know. You felt like you did something great.” A Glossary of Terms Jacquard — a loom fixed with an 18th century apparatus that was devised by Joseph Marie Jacquard of Lyons, France to permit the weaving of fabrics with complicated patterns. Loom — a machine which weaves the threads of the warp with the threads of the weft at right angles to produce a woven fabric. Reed — a tool composed of very thin pieces of flattened steel or brass which were set into a frame very much like the teeth of a comb. In the early days of weaving, these were usually made of reed or cane, hence the name. These “teeth” were set very closely together to form a very fine comb. The threads of the warp were drawn through the reed by the reed-sticker, who prepared the loom for weaving. Warp — those threads which combine to form the length of the woven fabric. The threads of the warp were wound onto a beam by warpers. This beam was placed in the bed of the loom opposite where the worker stood. The bed of the loom comprised most of its length from front to back. The weaver stood in front of the loom, facing the back. The warp was drawn toward the weaver, that is, through the bed and into the loom itself. Weft — the threads which formed the width of the woven fabric. In weaving, the loom separated the threads of the warp vertically, forming a space (sometimes called the shed) through which the threads of the weft were drawn. The threads of the weft were wound onto a quill by the quill-winder. The quill was then placed into the shuttle by the weaver. The shuttle was an oblong piece of wood with a depression in its upper side, into which the quill was placed. The shuttle was then driven through the gap in the warp, or shed, forming the weft of the fabric. The process was then repeated. The weft is also sometimes called the woof or the shoot. Occupational Folklife of New Jersey Harvesters by Rita Moonsammy From makeshift vendor stands, grocery stores, front yards, and backs of trucks are offered the varied fruits of New Jersey harvests: “Jersey ‘lopes,” “Jersey tomatoes,” “Muskrat meats — three pieces $1.00,” “Fresh Little Necks,” “Raritan Reds,” and “Fresh Blues” — all products of the diverse terrain of New Jersey's Coastal Plain. Along the bays and marshes of the Outer Coastal Plain, trappers and fishermen adjust their lives to the seasonal patterns of wildlife and schedule their days to conform with the tides. On the fertile soils and sandy loams of the Inner Coastal Plain, farmers follow occupational clocks and calendars based on moon cycles and growing seasons. Although their harvests are different, such groups who traditionally make their living off the land and water share some common features in their lives, and their folklore reflects the fact that nature is both their benefactor and their adversary. Town names like “Bivalve” and “Vineland,” and local nicknames like “Muskrat Capital of the World,” reflect the natural foundations of these human institutions. When Italian-American farmers around Vineland marked property boundaries with grapevines, they created visible symbols of their relationship to their lands. When trappers along the Maurice River call themselves “mudwallopers,” the reference is to the terrain of their activity. Occupational identity however, may change with the season, when work is geared toward a different harvest. For example, along the Delaware Bay, Route 553, Cumberland County. Muskrat fur oystermen long ago discovered that oysters spawn better in the fresher waters Bie eae as Cops Oc many Nes near the Delaware River but later grow better in the saltier Bay waters. Their SEE eee et tenes season starts in May, when they dredge up seed oysters, or “oyster plants,” from state-owned beds and deposit them on leased grounds in the Bay — one reason why they often call themselves “oyster planters.” Through the summer, however, while they wait for their crop to grow, they may fish, farm, or work on the boats. In September, they once again become oystermen, dredging up the bivalves until January. Similarly, the marshlands that fringe the coast offer many harvests, and, to the mudwalloper who reaps them, many occupations, but always his day is governed by the tides. Muskrat trappers trudge through the muddy meadow- lands from December through March. At lowering tides, they set traps along the labyrinth of inlets that weave in and out of the “marsh bunnies” (muskrats ) houses. Come spring, trapper becomes fisherman. He “makes a drift” by letting shad gill nets flow out behind his boat as the flood tide moves up the river. In the fall, about an hour before high tide, he pushes his railbird hunter’s boat into the marsh grass and reeds. Sleep is something to be caught between tasks. During intense work seasons, Sunday necessarily becomes the only day that man’s agenda supersedes nature’s. When the Delaware Bay dredgeboats worked under sail, due to the work schedule, Thanksgiving had to be observed on Sunday instead of Thursday in Port Norris. At Our Lady of Pompeii Parish in Vineland, the traditional Italian saint’s day celebration is held annually on the Sunday after Labor Day, rather than on the actual feast day. It becomes then a celebration of both harvest and belief. ‘Traditionally, “work socials” were the farmer's answer to man’s need for recreation when nature required that he work. When wheat needed threshing and hogs were to be slaughtered, several families joined forces to finish a job while they enjoyed each other's company.

The successful farmer or fisherman acquires as much knowledge as he can, both recent and traditional, weighs it against his own experience, discards what he finds useless, and develops his own approach. Astronomy plays a vital role in planting and harvesting, and the astrological depiction of cycles in The Farmer's Almanac finds its way into occupational language: “When the moon shifts, and the sign is in the arm, plant limas. Beans have to come on and set, and under some signs, they'll fall off.” The Italian- American maxim that peas planted on St. Giuseppe’s Feast Day will flourish represents a synthesis of belief and astronomical systems. Knowledge of the tides and the behavior of wildlife are important to trap- pers and fishermen: A trapper might say, What makes a big tide is the wind in the East and a full moon. And sometimes there’s what we call a ‘pogee’ tide. ‘Apogee,’ really, but we say ‘pogee.’ Has to do with the moon and that sort of thing. The pogee tides don’t come in very big, and they don’t go out very far. They're like a lazy tide. They don’t do much. The lobsterman’s technology is similarly based: the home-made lobster pot with its funnels, “kitchen,” where the bait is placed, and “parlor,” and the elaborate pound net for fishing are traps dependent upon traditional knowl- edge of how creatures respond to different stimuli. There is an abundance of weather lore among harvesters, for a farmer can see his year’s earnings washed away by torrential rains, or a fisherman can lose his life on stormy waters. Thus, while the fisherman keeps close check on marine weather forecasts, he will still take note of “sundog clouds,” or scan the heavens for the “mackerel skies and mare’s tails” that “make lofty ships fly low sails.” Stories of good harvests, and close calls, reflect the harvester’s view of this life as one full of risks. Many stories celebrate occasions of winning a gamble through wily skill and persistence. Such is this story from a lobsterman, Bill Richardson of Keyport, New Jersey: The biggest day I ever had offshore, I went out and we had one line. And it blowed up and got late. It was supposed to be lifted like today, and we had to leave it over. So, naturally, the next morning out, you'd lift that line first. So we lifted over a barrel of lobsters in that. Then we went out to where we were going to have this day’s work. And we lifted this line and had over a barrel on that! Well, then I went down on the south end, and we lifted that line and got over a barrel on that line! I said, “John, over a thousand today!” And he said to the other fellow, “Hear that, Frank? He’s talking through his hat again.” But I knew if the north and south were good, everything in between was, too. So, we lifted that line and grabbed the end line. Just as good!

Heritage Exhibition From June 23 through September 5, 1983, an exhibition honoring the 1983 National Heritage Fellowship recip- ients will be on display in the Na- tional Museum of American History. Recording Project This year, in addition to the archive-quality re- search tapes made of most perform- ances at the Festival of American Folklife, the focal performances from the French/French-American stage will be recorded for future publica- tion by the Smithsonian Collection of Recordings, a division of the Smithsonian Institution Press. The recordings will dramatically reinforce the 1983 Festival's concen- tration on French culture in America, permitting the direct comparison of two branches of the same musical tradition. And where else but at the Festival could such a musical conflu- ence be so authoritatively docu- mented? “This is exactly the kind of project we like to get involved in,” notes Bill Bennett, Executive Pro- ducer of the Smithsonian Collection. “When we can make a cultural state- ment with music of this caliber and broad appeal, it is remendously satisfying.” The support generated by this project illustrates the commitment that over the years has enabled the Festival to maintain the high stand- ards of presentation and perform- ance worthy of the folk arts and the national museum. The produc- tion effort is underwritten in part by a grant from the John and Clara Higgins Foundation. Reelsound, Inc. has donated the services of one of its state-of the-art mobile record- ing units, permitting high fidelity 16-track recording; the 3M Corp. has donated the tremendous quantities of Scotch™ recording tape that per- mit full coverage of the Festival; and the Sony Corp. has agreed to furnish one of their PCM-1610 digital tape recorders for the mastering process, as well as assorted condensors and — wireless microphone systems. Indi- vidual contributions by Lisa Null, who conceived of the project, and Gregg Lamping, who devoted thought, coordination, and profes- sional expertise, have made it reality. Plans for the release of the record- ing include the kind of thorough packaging that has been a hallmark of Smithsonian Collection record- ings: extensive liner essays, artist information, photographs, and award-winning graphic design. It is hoped that the planned 2-LP set (also available on one double-length cassette) will be ready for shipment in time for next year’s Festival. A se- lection of Smithsonian Collection recordings is available through the Museum Shops. : °c -. ~~ Te.
