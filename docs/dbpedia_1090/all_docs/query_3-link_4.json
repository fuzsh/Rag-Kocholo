        "meta_description": "Racing for the Open, Women and U17 fleets is run as a 3-day qualification and 3-day final series, with fleets split within each division. Teams tried to establish themselves in the game early on in today’s 2 races in a breeze of around 13-16 knots.\r\n\r\nQualification continues until 8 July, with re-seeding at the end of each day to mix up the fleets for the next day’s racing. Once qualification is complete, from 9-11 July the fleets will split into gold and silver as the battle for podium slots intensifies in the final 6 race showdown.\r\n\r\nRacing takes place across two course areas, with racing scheduled to get underway at 1400 hours on Sunday 7 July with two races planned for all fleets.\r\n\r\n420 OPEN\r\nDefending 420 Open World Champions Seb Menzies/Blake McGlashan from New Zealand opened with a powerful performance to seize the points and deliver back to back wins to lead the 89 boat fleet.\r\n\r\nJust behind in third on the leader board are team mates Mason Mulcahy/Andre Van Dam who seemed to surprised themselves, as Mulchay explained, “We didn’t expect to do very well because we have been in the boat for very little time, but it was a good day to get out there and get some keepers under our belt.\r\n\r\n“It was a pretty good day and nice wind. We are pretty happy but it is a long regatta so we are not getting too caught up about it.”\r\n\r\n420 Open - Top 10 Results after 2 Races\r\n1. Seb MENZIES/Blake MCGLASHAN (NZL 56674) - 2 pts\r\n2.

It was pretty speedy on that leg and quite wavy, and really good.\r\n\r\n“Game plan for tomorrow is to stay consistent with our results.”\r\n\r\nThe Spanish are competing at their second World Championship, after finishing second and top women’s team in the U17 fleet last year in the USA.\r\n\r\n“It was difficult because we are very close rivals,” said Blanca Cabot on their battle with the British pair. “But I have a very good partner in the boat and we are very strong and the wind was so, so good.“                  \r\n\r\n420 Women - Top 10 Results after 2 Races \r\n1.

We managed to work well with the waves and managed to come first in two races and we are very happy with this.\"\r\n\r\nTheir performance was equalled by France’s Ange Delerce/Timothee Rossi who took out both wins in the yellow fleet.
