The treatment of choice is surgery. Less frequently, it may appear in other locations such as the nails, glans penis, intertriginous areas and the perianal region, where conventional treatment may be complicated. We contribute a new case of perianal Bowen's disease, which responded to treatment with imiquimod with no evidence of clinical recurrence after 3 years of follow up. Imiquimod appears to be a therapeutic alternative for perianal Bowen's disease, which seems to have a particular tendency to recur in this location where surgery may also be complicated.\n\nPreservation of anal function after total excision of the anal mucosa for Bowen's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nReynolds, V H; Madden, J J; Franklin, J D; Burnett, L S; Jones, H W; Lynch, J B\n\n1984-05-01\n\nSix women with Bowen's disease of the anogenital area were treated by total excision of the anal mucosa, perianal skin and, in some cases, partial vulvectomy.

We sought to identify the impact of perianal disease on IBD outcomes in children, adolescents, and young adults. We studied 12,465 inpatient admissions for patients â¤20 years old with IBD in 2009 using the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID). Patients were stratified by their principal diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). Perianal disease (perianal abscess, anal fissure, or anal fistula), complex fistulas (rectourethral, rectovaginal, or enterovesical), and growth failure were defined by ICD-9 codes. Logistic regression was performed adjusting for CD or UC, gender, age, need for surgical intervention, fistulas, or growth failure. Of the 511 (4.1%) patients with perianal disease, 480 had CD (94%, pâ<â0.001). Girls were less likely to suffer perianal disease (ORâ=â0.63, CI 0.52-0.76, pâ<â0.001). Those with perianal disease were more likely to suffer complex fistulas (ORâ=â3.5, CI 1.98-6.20, pâ<â0.001) but less likely to suffer enteroenteral fistulas (ORâ=â0.30, CI 0.15-0.63, pâ=â0.001) than those without perianal disease. Perianal disease did not increase the incidence of growth failure (pâ=â0.997) but doubled the likelihood of an operation of any type during admission (pâ<â0.001). Additionally, patients with perianal disease spent on average 1.29 more days in the hospital (7.45 vs. 6.16 days, pâ<â0.001) and accrued $5838 extra in hospital charges (pâ=â0.005). Perianal disease in younger patients is associated with a longer length of stay, higher hospital charges, and increased rates of both perineal and abdominal operative procedures. These data support the notion that, similar to adults, the presence of perianal disease in pediatric Crohn's patients is associated with a more severe course.\n\nRadiation therapy for Bowen's disease of the skin\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLukas VanderSpek, Lauren A.; Pond, Gregory R.; Wells, Woodrow\n\n2005-10-01\n\nPurpose: To assess the clinical outcome in the radiation therapy (RT) of squamous carcinoma in situ of the skin (Bowen's disease). We focused on the local control rate and the toxicity according to the biologically effective dose (BED). Methods and Materials: A retrospective review was performed on 44 patients with Bowen's disease treated at Princess Margaret Hospital from April 1985 to November 2000. RT was the primary treatment for 32 patients, whereas 12 received RT for residual disease after local ablative therapy. Lesions were located as follows: scalp, 9 patients (20%); face, 12 (27%); trunk, 6 (14%), extremity, 12 (27%),moreÂ Â» perianal, 3 (7%), and penis, 2 (5%). Orthovoltage X-rays were used in the majority (39 of 44, 89%). There was no standard fractionation regimen: some physicians prescribed high doses, as for invasive skin cancer, whereas others prescribed lower doses because of the noninvasive nature of the disease, a sensitive anatomic location (e.g., extremity), or large treatment area. Because of the variations in fractionation regimens, BED was used as a common metric for biologic effect in the comparison of different regimens and analyzed for correlation with recurrence and toxicity. Local control was defined as the lack of persistent or recurrent disease at the treated site for the follow-up period. Grade 4 toxicity was defined as necrosis (cartilage/bone damage) and/or ulceration for a duration of >3 months. Results: The mean patient age was 67.7 years, and the male/female ratio was 29:15. The median pretreatment lesion size was 2.65 cm{sup 2} (range, 0.07-34.56 cm{sup 2}). Complete remission was achieved in 42 patients, with follow-up unavailable for the remaining 2 patients. Subsequently, 3 patients experienced recurrences at 0.2, 1.1, and 1-1.5 years after complete remission. One recurrence was Bowen's disease (local); the others were squamous cell carcinoma (one local, one marginal). Four patients experienced a new squamous lesion at a\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa and perianal Crohn disease: differential diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBassas-Vila, J; GonzÃ¡lez Lama, Y\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThe first description of perianal fistulas and complications in Crohn disease was made 75 years ago by Penner and Crohn. Published studies have subsequently confirmed that perianal fistulas are the most common manifestations of fistulising Crohn disease. Hidradenitis suppurativa was described in 1854 by a French surgeon, Aristide Verneuil. It is a chronic, inflammatory, recurrent and debilitating disease of the pilosebaceous follicle, that usually manifests after puberty with deep, painful and inflamed lesions in the areas of the body with apocrine glands, usually the axillary, inguinal and anogenital regions. The differential diagnosis between hidradenitis suppurativa and Crohn disease can be challenging, especially when the disease is primarily perianal. When they occur simultaneously, hidradenitis suppurativa and Crohn disease show severe phenotypes and patients can respond to anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy, although adalimumab is currently the only treatment with demonstrated efficacy in hidradenitis suppurativa and Crohn disease. In addition, there is sometimes a need for different complementary surgical procedures. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U. y AEDV.

Most Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV)-positive lesions in Bowen's disease are localized to the genital region or distal extremities (periungual sites) in which HPV type-16 is frequently detected. Patient was a 64-year-old construction worker for whom we detected 2 erythematous psoriasiform reticular scaly plaques on peri-umbilical and medial knee. Biopsy established the diagnosis of Bowen's disease and polymerase chain reaction assay showed HPV-6, -18 co-infection. Patient was referred for surgical excision.\n\nMedical and surgical management of perianal Crohnâs disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAdegbola, Samuel O.; Pisani, Anthea; Sahnan, Kapil; Tozer, Phil; Ellul, Pierre; Warusavitarne, Janindra\n\n2018-01-01\n\nCrohnâs disease is increasingly thought to encompass multiple possible phenotypes. Perianal manifestations account for one such phenotype and represent an independent disease modifier. In its more severe form, perianal Crohnâs disease confers a higher risk of a severe and disabling disease course, relapses, hospital admissions and operations. This, in turn, imposes a considerable burden and disability on patients. Identification of the precise manifestation is important, as management is nuanced, with both medical and surgical components, and is best undertaken in a multidisciplinary setting for both diagnosis and ongoing treatment. The introduction of biologic medication has heralded a significant addition to the management of fistulizing perianal Crohnâs disease in particular, albeit with modest results. It remains a very challenging condition to treat and further work is required to optimize management in this group of patients.

While several studies have examined the impact of pregnancy on luminal disease, limited literature exists in those with perianal CD. Decision regarding mode of delivery is a unique challenge in such patients due to concerns regarding the effect of pelvic floor trauma during delivery on pre-existing perianal involvement. Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of CD patients with established perianal disease undergoing either vaginal delivery or Caesarean section (C-section) at our institutions. We examined the occurrence of symptomatic perianal disease flares within 5 years after delivery in such women compared to non-pregnant CD controls. We also compared the occurrence of such flares between the two modes of delivery in women with established perianal CD. Results We identified 61 pregnant CD patients with established perianal disease (11 vaginal delivery, 50 via C-section) and 61 non-pregnant CD controls with perianal disease. One-third of the C-sections were primarily for obstetric indications. Six of the vaginal deliveries were complicated. Approximately 36% of cases had a symptomatic perianal flare within 1 year after delivery. This was similar across both modes of delivery (p=0.53), and similar to non-pregnant CD patients. There was no difference in the rates of perianal surgical intervention or luminal disease flares in our population based on mode of delivery, or between pregnant CD patients and non-pregnant CD controls. Conclusion We observed no difference in risk of symptomatic perianal flares in patients with established perianal CD delivering vaginally or via C-section.

We aimed to evaluate small bowel involvement and compare small bowel capsule endoscopy findings and inflammatory activity between patients with and without perianal disease. Retrospective single-center study including 71 patients - all patients with perianal CD (17 patients) who performed a small bowel capsule endoscopy were included, and non-perianal CD patients were randomly selected (54 patients). Clinical and analytical variables at diagnosis were reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v21.0 and a two-tailed p value <.05 was defined as indicating statistical significance. Patients had a median age of 30âÂ±â16 years with 52.1% females. Perianal disease was present in 23.9%. Patients with perianal disease had significantly more relevant findings (94.1% vs 66.6%, pâ=â.03) and erosions (70.6% vs 42.6%, pâ=â.04), however, no differences were found between the two groups regarding ulcer, villous edema and stenosis detection. Overall, patients with perianal disease had more frequently significant small bowel inflammatory activity, defined as a Lewis Scoreââ¥135 (94.1% vs 64.8%, pâ=â.03), and higher Lewis scores in the first and second tertiles (450âÂ±â1129 vs 0âÂ±â169, pâ=â.02 and 675âÂ±â1941 vs 0âÂ±â478, pâ=â.04, respectively). No differences were found between the two groups regarding third tertile inflammatory activity assessed with the Lewis Score. Patients with perianal CD have significantly higher inflammatory activity in the small bowel, particularly in proximal small bowel segments, when compared with patients without perianal disease.\n\nRecent developments in the surgical management of perianal fistula for Crohnâs disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGeltzeiler, Cristina B.; Wieghard, Nicole; Tsikitis, Vassiliki L.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPerianal manifestations of Crohnâs disease (CD) are common and, of them, fistulas are the most common. Perianal fistulas can be extremely debilitating for patients and are often very challenging for clinicians to treat. CD perianal fistulas usually require multidisciplinary and multimodality treatment, including both medical and surgical approaches. The majority of patients require multiple surgical interventions. CD patients with perianal fistulas have a high rate of primary non-healing, surgical morbidity, and high recurrence rates. This has led to constant efforts to improve surgical management of this disease process.

Regular re-evaluation of disease status to safely, readily and reliably detect the presence of inflammation and complications is paramount. Improvements in sonographic technology over recent years have facilitated a growing enthusiasm among radiologists and gastroenterologists in the use of ultrasound for the assessment of inflammatory bowel disease. Transabdominal intestinal ultrasound is accurate, affordable and safe for the assessment of luminal inflammation and complications in Crohn disease, and can be performed with or without the use of intravenous contrast enhancement. Perianal fistulizing disease is a common, complex and often treatment-refractory complication of Crohn disease, which requires regular radiological monitoring. Endoanal ultrasound is invasive, uncomfortable and yields limited assessment of the perineal region. Although magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis is established, timely access may be a problem. Transperineal ultrasound has been described in small studies, and is an accurate, painless and cost-effective method for documenting perianal fluid collections, fistulas and sinus tracts. In the present article, the authors review the literature regarding perineal ultrasound for the assessment of perianal Crohn disease and use case examples to illustrate its clinical utility.\n\nTreatment of peri-anal fistula in Crohn's disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSica, Giuseppe S; Di Carlo, Sara; Tema, Giorgia; Montagnese, Fabrizio; Del Vecchio Blanco, Giovanna; Fiaschetti, Valeria; Maggi, Giulia; Biancone, Livia\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAnal fistulas are a common manifestation of Crohnâs disease (CD). The first manifestation of the disease is often in the peri-anal region, which can occur years before a diagnosis, particularly in CD affecting the colon and rectum. The treatment of peri-anal fistulas is difficult and always multidisciplinary. The European guidelines recommend combined surgical and medical treatment with biologic drugs to achieve best results. Several different surgical techniques are currently employed. However, at the moment, none of these techniques appear superior to the others in terms of healing rate. Surgery is always indicated to treat symptomatic, simple, low intersphincteric fistulas refractory to medical therapy and those causing disabling symptoms. Utmost attention should be paid to correcting the balance between eradication of the fistula and the preservation of fecal continence.

Symptoms of chronic arsenic intoxication include general pigmentation or focal \"raindrop\" pigmentation of the skin and the appearance of hyperkeratosis of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. In addition to arsenic-related skin diseases including keratosis, Bowen's disease, basal-cell-carcinoma, and squamous-cell carcinoma, there is also an increased risk of some internal malignancies. Arsenic-related diseases are common in areas of the world where the drinking water has a high arsenic content. In this paper, we describe a 35-year-old male patient who had arsenic-related keratosis, squamous-cell carcinoma in the palmar area of his left hand, and Bowen's disease on his left thigh. The patient worked in a borax mine for 15 years, so he was exposed to arsenic in drinking water, airborne arsenic in his workplace, and had direct contact. The patient was treated for 11 months for arsenic-related keratosis until an axillary lymph node metastasis occurred; the lesion was excised and diagnosed to be malignant. Bowen's disease was detected when the patient was being treated for cancer. No other malignancy was found. The patient is still receiving regular follow-up care.

These are usually complex fistulas that adversely affect patients' quality of life, and their clinical management is difficult. Medical treatment sometimes achieves cessation of discharge and closure of the external opening; however, it is difficult to assess the status of the rest of the fistula tract. Magnetic resonance imaging is the method of choice with which to evaluate the condition of perianal fistulas and allows for assessment of the status of inaccessible areas. Magnetic resonance imaging also allows the clinician to evaluate other perianal manifestations of Crohn's disease that differ from the fistulas. This imaging technique is therefore a fundamental means of patient monitoring. When used in conjunction with assessment of the patient's morphological findings, it provides information that allows for both quantification of disease severity and evaluation of the response to treatment. New types of magnetic resonance sequences are emerging, such as diffusion, perfusion, and magnetisation transfer. These sequences may serve as biomarkers because they provide information reflecting the changes taking place at the molecular level. This will help to shape a new scenario in the early assessment of the response to treatments such as anti-tumour necrosis factor drugs. â¢ MRI is the method of choice with which to evaluate perianal fistulas. â¢ In perianal Crohn's disease, MRI is a fundamental means of patient monitoring. â¢ The usefulness of the Van Assche score for patient monitoring remains unclear. â¢ New MRI sequences' diffusion, perfusion, and magnetisation transfer may serve as biomarkers.\n\nAssessing the activity of perianal Crohn's disease: comparison of clinical indices and computer-assisted anal ultrasound.\n\nPubMed\n\nLosco, Alessandra; ViganÃ², Chiara; Conte, Dario; Cesana, Bruno Mario; Basilisco, Guido\n\n2009-05-01\n\nAssessing perianal disease activity is important for the treatment and prognosis of Crohn's disease (CD) patients, but the diagnostic accuracy of the activity indices has not yet been established. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy and agreement of the Fistula Drainage Assessment (FDA), Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI), and computer-assisted anal ultrasound imaging (AUS). Sixty-two consecutive patients with CD and perianal fistulae underwent clinical, FDA, PDAI, and AUS evaluation. Perianal disease was considered active in the presence of visible fistula drainage and/or signs of local inflammation (induration and pain at digital compression) upon clinical examination. The AUS images were analyzed by calculating the mean gray-scale tone of the lesion. The PDAI and gray-scale tone values discriminating active and inactive perianal disease were defined using receiver operating characteristics statistics. Perianal disease was active in 46 patients. The accuracy of the FDA was 87% (confidence interval [CI]: 76%-94%). A PDAI of >4 and a mean gray-scale tone value of 117 maximized sensitivity and specificity; their diagnostic accuracy was, respectively, 87% (CI: 76%-94%) and 81% (CI: 69%-90%). The agreement of the 3 evaluations was fair to moderate. The addition of AUS to the PDAI or FDA increased their diagnostic accuracy to respectively 95% and 98%. The diagnostic accuracy of the FDA, PDAI, and computer-assisted AUS imaging was good in assessing perianal disease activity in patients with CD. The agreement between the techniques was fair to moderate. Overall accuracy can be increased by combining the FDA or PDAI with AUS.\n\nHigh Risk of Anal and Rectal Cancer in Patients With Anal and/or Perianal Crohn's Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeaugerie, Laurent; Carrat, Fabrice; Nahon, StÃ©phane; Zeitoun, Jean-David; SabatÃ©, Jean-Marc; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Colombel, Jean-FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Allez, Matthieu; FlÃ©jou, Jean-FranÃ§ois; Kirchgesner, Julien; Svrcek, Magali\n\n2018-06-01\n\nLittle is known about the magnitude of the risk of anal and rectal cancer in patients with anal and/or perineal Crohn's disease. We aimed to assess the risk of anal and rectal cancer in patients with Crohn's perianal disease followed up in the Cancers Et Surrisque AssociÃ© aux Maladies Inflammatoires Intestinales En France (CESAME) cohort. We collected data from 19,486 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) enrolled in the observational CESAME study in France, from May 2004 through June 2005; 14.9% of participants had past or current anal and/or perianal Crohn's disease. Subjects were followed up for a median time of 35 months (interquartile range, 29-40 mo). To identify risk factors for anal cancer in the total CESAME population, we performed a case-control study in which participants were matched for age and sex. Among the total IBD population, 8 patients developed anal cancer and 14 patients developed rectal cancer. In the subgroup of 2911 patients with past or current anal and/or perianal Crohn's lesions at cohort entry, 2 developed anal squamous-cell carcinoma, 3 developed perianal fistula-related adenocarcinoma, and 6 developed rectal cancer. The corresponding incidence rates were 0.26 per 1000 patient-years for anal squamous-cell carcinoma, 0.38 per 1000 patient-years for perianal fistula-related adenocarcinoma, and 0.77 per 1000 patient-years for rectal cancer. Among the 16,575 patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease without anal or perianal lesions, the incidence rate of anal cancer was 0.08 per 1000 patient-years and of rectal cancer was 0.21 per 1000 patient-years. Among factors tested by univariate conditional regression (IBD subtype, disease duration, exposure to immune-suppressive therapy, presence of past or current anal and/or perianal lesions), the presence of past or current anal and/or perianal lesions at cohort entry was the only factor significantly associated with development of anal cancer (odds ratio, 11.2; 95% CI, 1\n\nPerianal Dermatitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAgullÃ³-PÃ©rez, Alfredo-Daniel; Hervella-GarcÃ©s, Marcos; Oscoz-Jaime, Saioa; Azcona-RodrÃ­guez, Maialen; Larrea-GarcÃ­a, MÃ³nica; Yanguas-Bayona, Juan-Ignacio\n\nPerianal complaints are often consulted in dermatology clinics, and in many cases, a conclusive diagnosis is not easily made. The aim of this study was to study and identify the epidemiological, clinical, and contact allergy features of patients with perianal dermatitis who attended at a contact dermatitis unit in a tertiary hospital in Spain. Adult patients with long-lasting (>4 weeks) perianal dermatitis were recruited during the past 10 years for investigation and follow-up. Every patient underwent a diagnostic workup consisting of dermatological exploration and patch tests with the standard and specific series, as well as the patients' own products. General surgical exploration was also performed in some patients. One hundred twenty-four patients were included. The MOAHLFA index was as follows: 43.5, 0, 4.8, 11.3, 1.6, 8.1, and 75. The main final diagnoses were allergic contact dermatitis (32.3%), psoriasis (24.2%), irritant contact dermatitis (17.7%), and lichen simplex (neurodermatitis) (10%). Eighty-one patients (66.1%) showed 1 or more positive reactions, and in 52 patients (43%), positive reactions relevant to the present disease were found. Contact allergy in patients with long-lasting perianal complaints is frequent. It is mandatory for these patients to be referred to a dermatologist for an adequate evaluation and patch testing. Methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone seems as the most common allergen implicated in perianal contact dermatitis.\n\n[Bowen's disease and squamous cell carcinoma in Haber's syndrome: two cases].\n\nPubMed\n\nLegoupil, D; Lemasson, G; Davaine, A-C; Misery, L\n\n2007-01-01\n\nHaber's syndrome is a rare form of autosomal dominant genodermatosis. Clinically, it is associated with rosaceiform dermatosis of the face that begins in childhood, and profuse keratotic lesions resembling seborrheic keratoses, seen predominantly on the trunk, the tops of the limbs and the scalp. We report two cases of Bowen's disease and cutaneous epidermoid carcinoma in Haber's syndrome patients. A 67 year-old woman with Haber's syndrome and with a familial history consulted for a budding lesion on the abdomen, histological examination of which confirmed epidermoid carcinoma. A 77 year-old woman presented a clinical picture consistent with Haber's syndrome, with three infiltrated erythematosquamous abdominal lesions. Histological examination of a biopsy sample confirmed the clinical diagnosis of Bowen's disease. The patient was successfully treated with imiquimod. These two cases appear to indicate the existence of an association between Haber's syndrome and the presence of cutaneous carcinomatous lesions. We propose the hypothesis of transformation of the keratoses seen in seborrheic keratosis. These lesions may be considered as pre-cancerous. Association with skin carcinomas requires regular monitoring of these patients. The use of imiquimod to treat lesions in patients with Bowen's disease resulted in complete cure.\n\nNon perianal fistulas in Crohn's disease and short bowel syndrome: what we can do?\n\nPubMed\n\nZildzic, Muharem; Alibegovic, Ervin\n\n2009-01-01\n\nCrohn's disease (CD) is a lifelong disease arising from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors, but seen predominantly in the developed countries of the world. The precise etiology is unknown and therefore a causal treatment is not yet available. Fistulating Crohn's disease includes fistulas arising in the perianal area, together with those communicating between the intestine and other organs or the abdominal wall. Non perianal fistulas include fistulas communicating with other viscera (urinary bladder, vagina), loops of intestine (enteroenteral fistulas) or the abdominal wall (enterocutaneus fistulas). The diagnostic approach is a crucial aspect in the management of fistulating CD as the findings influence the therapeutic strategy. Short bowel syndrome caused by extensive bowel resection should be initially treated with nutritional support and can caused serious treatment and reevaluating problems. We review this uncommon manifestation in a high risk patient after multiple operations and severely shortened bowel and also with non perianal fistulating CD.\n\nMRI predictors of treatment response for perianal fistulizing Crohn disease in children and young adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nShenoy-Bhangle, Anuradha; Nimkin, Katherine; Goldner, Dana; Bradley, William F; Israel, Esther J; Gee, Michael S\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the imaging standard for diagnosis and characterization of perianal complications associated with Crohn disease in children and adults. To define MRI criteria that could act as potential predictors of treatment response in fistulizing Crohn disease in children, in order to guide more informed study interpretation. We performed a retrospective database query to identify all children and young adults with Crohn disease who underwent serial MRI studies for assessment of perianal symptoms between 2003 and 2010. We examined imaging features of perianal disease including fistula number, type and length, presence and size of associated abscess, and disease response/progression on follow-up MRI. We reviewed imaging studies and electronic medical records. Statistical analysis, including logistic regression, was performed to associate MR imaging features with treatment response and disease progression. We included 36 patients (22 male, 14 female; age range 8-21Â years). Of these, 32 had a second MRI exam and 4 had clinical evidence of complete response, obviating the need for repeat imaging. Of the parameters analyzed, presence of abscess, type of fistula according to the Parks classification, and multiplicity were not predictors of treatment outcome. Maximum length of the dominant fistula and aggregate fistula length in the case of multiple fistulae were the best predictors of treatment outcome. Maximum fistula length <2.5Â cm was a predictor of treatment response, while aggregate fistula length â¥2.5Â cm was a predictor of disease progression. Perianal fistula length is an important imaging feature to assess on MRI of fistulizing Crohn disease.\n\nProspective Comparison of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Transrectal and Transperineal Sonography, and Surgical Findings in Complicated Perianal Crohn Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nBor, RenÃ¡ta; Farkas, Klaudia; BÃ¡lint, Anita; SzÅ±cs, MÃ³nika; ÃbrahÃ¡m, Szabolcs; Milassin, Ãgnes; Rutka, Mariann; Nagy, Ferenc; Milassin, PÃ©ter; Szepes, ZoltÃ¡n; MolnÃ¡r, TamÃ¡s\n\n2016-11-01\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal sonography are the two accepted imaging modalities for evaluation of perianal fistulas and abscesses. Transperineal sonography is a new technique that is easy to learn and can be performed at any time. The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the diagnostic accuracy of MRI, transrectal sonography, and transperineal sonography with surgical findings in patients with perianal Crohn disease. All patients with perianal Crohn disease underwent MRI, transrectal sonography, and transperineal sonography within a few days before surgery. Fistulas were classified as simple (43.8%) or complex (52.2%) based on surgical findings. Twenty-three patients with active perianal Crohn disease (12 women and 11 men; mean age, 29.9 years; current therapy: antibiotics, 69.6%; azathioprine, 56.5%; and biologics, 73.9%; previous surgery, 26.1%; and proportion of smokers, 39.1%) were included. Sensitivity values for MRI, transrectal sonography, and transperineal sonography for diagnosis of fistulas were 84.6%, 84.6%, and 100%, respectively. Transperineal sonography was more sensitive for diagnosis of perianal abscesses than MRI and transrectal sonography (100%, 58.8%, and 92.8%). Transperineal sonography is a very accurate diagnostic method with outstanding sensitivity compared with MRI and transrectal sonography for evaluation of complicated perianal Crohn disease. Due to its simplicity and low cost, it is recommended that transperineal sonography be the first diagnostic modality in these cases.

We present a series of 13 Bowen disease lesions treated using PDT. Complete responses were achieved in 11 (84%) of the lesions after 3 months of treatment; at 18 months, complete responses were seen in 9 (70%) of the lesions. Patients who presented a partial response or recurrence were treated with topical 5% imiquimod and achieved complete responses. The lesions that presented partial response or recurrence were the largest lesions, between 3 and 5cm in diameter. PDT in monotherapy or combined sequentially with imiquimod is an excellent and well-tolerated therapeutic option for Bowen disease. The treatment has few adverse effects and shows satisfactory results, particularly in multiple large lesions in areas of difficult surgical reconstruction or in elderly patients with a high surgical risk.

We aimed to assess whether pCD in children is associated with more severe outcomes as found in adults. Data were extracted from the ImageKids database, a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal cohort study. The study enrolled 246 children at disease onset or thereafter. All patients underwent comprehensive clinical, endoscopic, and radiologic evaluation at enrollment; 98 children had repeat evaluation at 18 months. Of the 234 included patients (mean age 14.2âÂ±â2.4 years; 131 [56%] boys), 57 (24%) had perianal findings, whereas only 21 (9%) had fistulizing perianal disease.

Recently, transperineal ultrasonography (TPUS) has been proposed as a simple, safe, time-sparing and useful diagnostic technique to assess different pathological conditions of the pelvic floor. The aim of this prospective single centre study was to evaluate the accuracy of TPUS versus MRI for the detection and classification of perineal disease in IBD patients. From November 2013 to November 2014, 28 IBD patients underwent either TPUS or MRI. Fistulae and abscesses were classified according to Parks' and AGA's classification methods. A concordance was assessed by k statistics. Overall, 33 fistulae and 8 abscesses were recognized by TPUS (30 and 7 by MRI, respectively). The agreement between TPUS and MRI was 75% according to Parks' classification (k=0.67) and 86% according to AGA classification (k=0.83), while it was 36% (k=0.34) for classifying abscesses. TPUS proved to be as accurate as MRI for detecting superficial and small abscesses and for classifying perianal disease. Both examinations may be performed at the initial presentation of the patient, but TPUS is a cheaper, time-sparing procedure. The optimal use of TPUS might be in follow-up patients.

The patient had been treated with oral and topical antifungals for inguinal tinea for several months and after that with topical corticosteroids for eczema for several more months. None of the regimens achieved any therapeutic effect. The histopathological evaluation revealed the presence of atypical keratinocytes in all layers of the epidermis with the altered epidermal pattern, spread parabasal mitotic activity, without secondary satellites, multiple dyskeratotic cells and multinucleated cells. The diagnosis of an intraepithelial non-invasive squamous cell carcinoma, associated with koilocytic dysplasia and hyperplasia was made, meeting the criteria for Bowen disease. An elliptic surgical excision of the lesion was made, while the defect was closed with single stitches, with excellent therapeutic and aesthetic result. First described by John T. Bowen in 1912, Bowen disease (BD) represents a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in situ with the potential for significant lateral spread. Treatment options include the application of topical 5-flurorouracil cream - useful in non-hairy areas, imiquimod cream or destructive methods such as radiation, curettage, cryotherapy, laser ablation and photodynamic therapy, especially useful in nail bed involvement. Despite the early lesions, surgical excision is the preferred treatment option, regarding the potential malignant transformation risk.\n\nQuadruple cancer including Bowen's disease after arsenic injections 40 years earlier: report of a case.\n\nPubMed\n\nMurata, K; Iwazawa, T; Takayama, T; Yamashita, K; Okagawa, K\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThis report describes the successful treatment of quadruple cancer including Bowen's disease in a 71-year-old man who had been given injections of salvarsan, an arsenic compound, for syphilis more than 40 years earlier.

This prospective hospital based study was conducted for a period of one year from April 2014 to April 2015 in the departments of Radiodiagnosis and Surgery of our institute. A total of 50 consecutive patients presenting with perianal fistulous disease fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study and taken up for MRI. The perianal fistulae were classified according to St James University hospital classification and tracks were assessed with regard to anatomical plane, length, ramifications, abscess formation, enteric communication, external cutaneous opening, enhancement and suprasphincteric extension. Surgical correlation was done in 31 patients who opted for surgical treatment. Rest of the 19 patients preferred alternative medicine for treatment or chose to postpone their surgery. The disease was much more prevalent in males in comparison to females with male to female ratio of 24:1. Grade 4 was the most common type of fistula (34%) while Grade 5 was the least common type (4%).MRI showed a high sensitivity of 93.7% and positive predictive value (PPV) of 96.7% when correlated with surgical findings. A substantial number of patients (38%) preferred alternative medicine or non surgical form of treatment. MRI is a very sensitive modality for the evaluation of perianal fistula. In our study group, the disease predominantly affected middle aged men. Ramifications and abscesses were commonly seen, affecting nearly half of the patients and majority of the patients had active fistulous tracks with posteriorly located enteric opening. Overall, transsphincteric fistulae were most common. Significant number of patients avoided surgery or showed preference for non surgical treatment.\n\nPerianal atypical leiomyoma: A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Pingliang; Ou, Hailing; Huang, Shen; Wei, Longxiang; Zhang, Sen; Liu, Jiali; Geng, Shuguang; Yang, Kun\n\n2017-12-01\n\nReports on perianal atypical leiomyoma, a perianal tumor, are rare. We confirmed a perianal atypical leiomyoma by its clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and immunohistochemistry. A 28-year-old female with a perianal mass found more than 4 years ago. The 5cm_4cm_4cm sized mass was located on the left side of the anus and vagina; The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed: A 4.1cmâÃâ5.2cmâÃâ4.9cm sized round mass was observed on the left side of the circumference.

Perianal atypical leiomyomas are benign tumors, but with the clinically atypical leiomyoma, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between potential malignant smooth muscle tumors,and there may be malignant changes. Surgery should ensure complete resection, and to avoid postoperative recurrence, there should be a regular follow-up.\n\nPrimary peri-anal adenocarcinoma of intestinal type - a new proposed entity.\n\nPubMed\n\nGill, Pelvender S; Wong, Newton A C S\n\n2018-02-21\n\nThe currently recognised subtypes of anal canal/peri-anal adenocarcinoma are those arising from low rectal mucosa or columnar cuff, fistula-related tumours and anal gland carcinoma. This report presents two examples of a hitherto undescribed subtype of peri-anal adenocarcinoma with an intestinal phenotype. A 74-year-old man had a peri-anal tumour locally excised, whereas a 73-year-old female underwent an abdominoperineal resection for peri-anal Paget's disease with an underlying carcinoma. Neither patient had a history of perineal fistulae, Crohn's disease or previous gastrointestinal neoplasia, and neither showed clinical, radiological or endoscopic evidence of another abdominal or pelvic tumour. Both resection specimens contained adenocarcinoma, which were similar in demonstrating an intestinal morphology and CDX2 immunopositivity. The man has shown a disease-free outcome thus far, but the woman has suffered with nodal and pelvic recurrence within a few months of surgery. The name 'primary peri-anal adenocarcinoma of intestinal type' is proposed for this previously unrecognised subtype of perineal neoplasia. Awareness of its distinct existence - by recognising its intestinal morphology and immunophenotype while excluding metastasis from the intestinal tract - should help to collate data to determine its specific prognosis and to formulate its best management.

Clinical trial. 12 dogs with perianal fistulas. Dogs received cyclosporine and ketoconazole orally (target whole blood trough cyclosporine concentrations of 400 to 600 ng/ml). Study endpoints were resolution of clinical signs, remission, and recurrence of disease. Adverse effects and cost of medications were reported. Results were compared with those from previous studies in humans and in dogs in which single agent cyclosporine treatment for perianal fistulas was used. All dogs had resolution of clinical signs. Eight dogs went into remission; however, 5 of those 8 had recurrence of fistulas. Adverse effects of treatment were minimal and well tolerated. Cost of treatment was comparable to traditional surgical options and less than single agent cyclosporine treatment. Administration of cyclosporine with ketoconazole is an effective and cost-comparable treatment for perianal fistulas in dogs.\n\nMulticentric squamous cell carcinona in a paca (Agouti paca) resembling Bowen's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nLuppi, Marcela M; Malta, Marcelo C C; Costa, Maria E L T; Motta, Rafael O C; Santos, Renato L\n\n2008-06-01\n\nAn 8-yr-old female paca (Agouti paca) was admitted at the Veterinary Hospital of the Belo Horizonte Zoo (Brazil) with an ulcerated cutaneous nodule of approximately 1.5 cm in diameter in the left ear.

All cutaneous nodules were histologically similar with features of squamous cell carcinoma. Considering the predominant in situ nature of the lesion as well as its multicentric localization, the disease reported here closely resembles Bowen's disease, which has been described in humans and which has been identified as a rare neoplastic disease of cats, with one single report in a dog.

Contrast-enhanced pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the radiologic study of choice used to diagnose PfCD in children. The aim was to study whether the various MRI-based radiologic parameters and score can help in staging and follow-up of patients with PfCD. We performed a retrospective chart review of children with PfCD who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI of the pelvis. The demographic profile, clinical status, and laboratory data of the patients at the time of each MRI examination were noted. Based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of MRI examinations, the MRIs were classified into 3 groups: severe disease, mild-to-moderate disease, and asymptomatic. Each MRI examination was reviewed by a radiologist, who was blinded to the clinical status of the patient. Of the radiologic parameters, the number of fistulas, the complexity of fistulas, and the number of abscesses were significantly lower in the asymptomatic group compared with the mild-to-moderate and severe disease groups. The Van Assche MRI-based score was significantly lower in the asymptomatic group compared with the mild-to-moderate disease (P = 0.01) and the severe disease group (P = 0.002). The percentage increase in fistula activity after gadolinium administration was significantly lower in the asymptomatic group compared with the mild-to-moderate disease (P = 0.026) and severe disease (P = 0.019) groups. The MRI-based scores were significantly higher in the MRI examinations performed at diagnosis compared with those that were performed while the patients were receiving the treatment (P = 0.017). The Van Assche MRI score and the percentage increase in fistula activity after gadolinium administration help in assessing the severity perianal Crohn disease. The Van Assche MRI score may be helpful in documenting healing during therapy of perianal Crohn disease.\n\n[Perianal and rectal ulcers due to abuse of paracetamol-codeine suppositories].\n\nPubMed\n\nWagner, G; Sand, C; Sachse, M M\n\n2015-03-01\n\nA 61-year-old woman presented with a progressive perianal ulcer which had developed 4 months ago. Upon further examination, another ulcer of the rectum was detected. Anorectal malignancies, viral infections or primary inflammatory bowel disease were not found. It could be demonstrated that the ulcers were induced by paracetamol and codeine suppositories. After discontinuation of these suppositories, the perianal ulcers healed almost completely within 3 weeks. The pathogenesis of paracetamol-induced ulcers is unknown.

The epidermal lesion showed a bowenoid papillomatous growth pattern with histologic features suggestive of infection by human papilloma virus (HPV). In the dermis a neoplasm made up by spindled or polygonal cells with wide clear cytoplasm and moderate nuclear pleomorphism was found. Immunohistochemical characteristics of these two lesions were clearly different. The atypical cells of the intraepidermal proliferation were positive for AE1-AE3 anticytokeratin antibody, EMA, p16, p53 and p63. The dermal tumor was positive for vimentin, CD10, CD68, CD99, alpha-1-antitrypsin and c-kit. Histological features and immunohistochemical profile of the dermal tumor corresponded to a CCAFXA, a very uncommon neoplasm of which only 10 cases have been reported.

Nodular hidradenocarcinoma (NH) is a rare malignant and aggressive tumor of the eccrine glands. The objective of this study is to report a case of perianal hidradenocarcinoma. We present the case of a 75-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. Physical examination revealed a small perianal tumor that was palpated near the anal canal. Biopsy was done. Pathology report revealed perianal hidradenoma. Rectosigmoidoscopy was normal. Computed tomography showed 1-cm adenopathies in inguinal and right iliac regions. Extensive resection of the tumor was done. Definitive pathology report was malignant eccrine acrospiroma. The patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy in the Oncology Service and died 1 month later.

Periumbilical and perianal streptococcal dermatitis are conditions that commonly occur in children and usually result from beta-hemolytic group A Streptococcus. Rarely, non-group A streptococcal and staphylococcal infections have been reported in adults. A 31-year-old woman developed perianal and periumbilical group G streptococcal dermatitis. Symptoms were present for six months and were refractory to clotrimazole 1 percent and betamethasone dipropionate 0.05 percent cream. The etiology of perianal and periumbilical dermatitis is unclear, but is perhaps explained by virulence of previously asymptomatic colonized bacteria. Perianal streptococcal dermatitis is more common in children. A number of adult infections have been reported, most of which were secondary to group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. Men are more often affected than women. Group G Streptococcus is rarely the infective etiology of perianal streptococcal dermatitis. This condition presents as a superficial well demarcated erythematous patch on clinical examination. Diagnosis is ascertained by diagnostic swabs and serological tests: antistreptolysin O (ASO) or anti-DNase titer. Treatments include oral amoxicillin, penicillin, erythromycin, and mupirocin ointment. Our patient expands on the clinical presentation typical of streptococcal dermatitis. We describe a rare occurrence of an adult woman infected with non-group A Streptococcus. Several conditions can mimic the presentation of perianal streptococcal dermatitis. Although rare, group G Streptococcus should be considered in the setting of virulent infections usually attributed to group A species. Streptococcal dermatitis can be added to the list of conditions affecting the umbilicus.\n\nPerianal sinuses in neonates and infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nAl-Wattar, Kais M\n\n2002-12-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the etiology of perianal abscess or discharges in neonates and infants and some of them are perianal sinuses with blind inner end without connection to the anal canal, and some of these cases have a different histological pattern. Complete surgical excision and primary closure of their wounds can cure these patients. Between January 1988 and December 2000, (81) neonates and infants (aged 2 weeks to 2 years) with perianal sinuses, fistula-in-ano abscess dealt in the Al-Zahrawi and Al-Khansa Teaching Hospitals, Mosul, Iraq, were studied. Fifty-one patients displayed an onset of symptoms during their first year of age, all cases had a gentle probing and proctoscopy under general anesthesia, and the discharge from abscess from the patients were sent for culture. Thirty patients with proper sinuses had excision of the sinus and primary closure; children with fistulae underwent fistulectomy; perianal abscesses drained. All the excised specimens were examined histopathologically. All children, except 3, were boys. Out of the 81 cases studied, 30 patients (37%) proved to have proper sinuses with blind inner end. Eight of these showed a different histological pattern, and in 2 cases, the histopathology was that of rectal duplication, the microbiology of the discharge from the proper sinuses was showing a predominance of non-gut derived organisms. All patients cured by excision of the sinuses and primary closure. Fistulae are the most common perianal discharging lesions in neonates and infants, blind sinuses are another cause in a considerable number. We propose a diagnostic strategy and treatment for those children presenting with discharging perianal lesions; for anticipation of these sinuses 3 points need to be considered before attempting surgery. 1) Blind sinus tract on gentle probing. 2) Normal anal and rectal mucosa on proctoscopy. 3) High bacterial yield of non-gut derived organisms on culture of the pus or discharge.

Following two incomplete surgical excisions of the tumour, the dog was treated by means of surgery combined with local radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy using one cycle of vincristine sulphate, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (VAC protocol). The dog died 252 days after the first combined therapy. Radiography at this time demonstrated enlargement of the iliac lymph nodes, suggesting metastasis of the tumour. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of treatment of canine perianal rhabdomyosarcoma.\n\nA theoretically based determination of bowen-ratio fetch requirements\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nStannard, D.I.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nDetermination of fetch requirements for accurate Bowen-ratio measurements of latent- and sensible-heat fluxes is more involved than for eddy-correlation measurements because Bowen-ratio sensors are located at two heights, rather than just one. A simple solution to the diffusion equation is used to derive an expression for Bowen-ratio fetch requirements, downwind of a step change in surface fluxes. These requirements are then compared to eddy-correlation fetch requirements based on the same diffusion equation solution. When the eddy-correlation and upper Bowen-ratio sensor heights are equal, and the available energy upwind and downwind of the step change is constant, the Bowen-ratio method requires less fetch than does eddy correlation. Differences in fetch requirements between the two methods are greatest over relatively smooth surfaces. Bowen-ratio fetch can be reduced significantly by lowering the lower sensor, as well as the upper sensor. The Bowen-ratio fetch model was tested using data from a field experiment where multiple Bowen-ratio systems were deployed simultaneously at various fetches and heights above a field of bermudagrass. Initial comparisons were poor, but improved greatly when the model was modified (and operated numerically) to account for the large roughness of the upwind cotton field.\n\nBowen durring EVA 1\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2011-02-28\n\nISS026-E-030715 (28 Feb. 2011) --- NASA astronauts Steve Bowen and Alvin Drew (mostly obscured at center right), both STS-133 mission specialists, participate in the mission?s first session of extravehicular activity (EVA) as construction and maintenance continue on the International Space Station.

Nevertheless, predicting the clinical course after surgery for perianal Crohn disease (PCD) is important because repeated operations may decrease patient's quality of life. The aim of this study was to predict the risk of reoperation in patients with PCD. Methods From September 1994 to February 2010, 377 patients with PCD were recruited in twelve major tertiary university-affiliated hospitals and two specialized colorectal hospitals in Korea. Data on the patient's demographics, clinical features, and surgical outcomes were analyzed. Results Among 377 patients, 227 patients were ultimately included in the study. Among the 227 patients, 64 patients underwent at least one reoperation. The median period of reoperation following the first perianal surgery was 94 months. Overall 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year cumulative rates of reoperation-free individuals were 68.8%, 61.2%, and 50.5%, respectively. In multivariate analysis (Cox-regression hazard model), reoperation was significantly correlated with an age of onset less than 20 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-3.48; P = 0.03), history of abdominal surgery (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.08-3.64; P = 0.03), and the type of surgery. Among types of surgery, fistulotomy or fistulectomy was associated with a decreased incidence of reoperation in comparison with incision and drainage (HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.09-0.42; P < 0.001). Conclusion Young age of onset and a history of abdominal surgery were associated with a high risk of reoperation for PCD, and the risk of reoperation were relatively low in fistulotomy or fistulectomy procedures.

The infant had suffered from perianal abscesses from 3Â weeks after birth. The abscesses repeatedly developed and spontaneously drained through the orifice. Twenty-seven days before admission, a live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) was given to the infant for the first time for routine immunization. His body temperature rose to 38Â°C 19Â days after receiving the OPV and fell 4Â days later. Flaccid paralysis of the right leg appeared 26Â days after receipt of the OPV. A Sabin type 3 poliovirus was isolated from a stool obtained at admission. The DNA sequences of the VP1 region of the isolated virus were more than 99% identical with those of the vaccine strain. Mild muscle atrophy with moderate motor impairment in the right leg persisted at 18Â months of age. One VAPP case provoked by a perianal abscess has been reported from the United Kingdom. Database search revealed that one of nine VAPP cases reported during 2003-2008 in Japan had a perianal abscess. Taken together, these reports and our case imply that we should give OPV with caution to infants with a perianal abscess.\n\nPerformance of the Bowen ratio systems on a 22 deg slope\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNie, D.; Flitcroft, I.; Kanemasu, E. T.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe Bowen ratio energy balance technique was used to assess the energy fluxes on inclined surfaces during the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE). Since air flow over sloping surface may differ from that over flat terrain, it is important to examine whether Bowen ratio measurements taken on sloping surfaces are valid. In this study, the suitability of using the Bowen ratio technique on sloping surfaces was tested by examining the assumptions that the technique requires for valid measurements. This was accomplished by studying the variation of Bowen ratio measurements along a selected slope at the FIFE site. In September 1988, four Bowen ratio systems were set up in a line along the 22 degree north-facing slope with northerly air flow (wind went up the slope). In July of 1989, six Bowen ratio systems were similarly installed with southerly air flow (the wind went down slope). Results indicated that, at distances between 10 to 40 meters from the top of the slope, no temperature or vapor pressure gradient parallel to the slope was detected. Uniform Bowen ratio values were obtained on the slope, and thus the sensible or latent heat flux should be similar along the slope. This indicates that the assumptions for valid flux measurements are reasonably met at the slope. The Bowen ratio technique should give the best estimates of the energy fluxes on slopes similar to that in this study.\n\nCyclosporin and ketoconazole interaction for treatment of perianal fistulas in the dog.\n\nPubMed\n\nMouatt, J G\n\n2002-04-01\n\nTo assess the use of concurrent ketoconazole and low dose cyclosporin administration in a group of dogs with clinical evidence of perianal fistulas, and to determine if this combination could be used to manage perianal fistulas effectively. Prospective clinical trial Sixteen dogs with clinical evidence of perianal fistulas were given ketoconazole (10 mg/kg once daily) and cyclosporin (1 mg/kg twice daily initially) for 16 weeks. Blood cyclosporin assays were performed regularly and cyclosporin doses were altered to achieve a stable blood level above 200 ng/mL. Regular examinations assessed the dogs' general health, changes in clinical behaviour, fistula size and number. A complete blood count and serum biochemical analysis was performed in all dogs before and after the treatment period, and after 8 weeks of treatment in 12 dogs. Dogs were assessed for recurrence of lesions at 1, 3 and 12 months after the trial. All dogs showed marked improvement in lesions and behaviour within 14 days of the medication. Fourteen dogs completed the trial. Two dogs were excluded due to concurrent disease. Thirteen dogs (93%) showed complete resolution of fistulas during the treatment period. Seven dogs (50%) had no recurrence after 12 months. Recurrence was seen in three dogs (21%) at 8, 10 and 12 months after treatment, and in three dogs (21%) within 1 month of treatment. The medication was well tolerated. Side effects included transient anorexia, vomiting and lethargy in some dogs, increased shedding of hair and gingival hyperplasia. Ketoconazole administration allowed a dramatic reduction in cyclosporin dose (over 90% in 12 dogs and 80% in the other two) compared to previously reported cases treated with cyclosporin alone. The use of combined ketoconazole and cyclosporin provided an effective treatment for perianal fistulas. Outcomes were similar to those seen with cyclosporin alone, but allowed a significant reduction in cyclosporin dose and, therefore, cost.

It is a disease of the apocrine sweat glands and may arise from each of the localizations where apocrine glands are prominent: axilla, nipples, umbilicus, perineum, groin, and buttocks. Extensive hidradenitis suppurativa of the perineal/perianal and the gluteal regions constitute a serious social problem. In this study, we present our experience with stage III extensive hidradenitis suppurativa cases, including our treatment methods and patient outcomes. A retrospective review of the medical records from January 1990 to July 2003 of 15 patients was performed. Fifteen patients underwent treatment for extensive hidradenitis suppurativa in the gluteal, perineal/perianal, and inguinal areas with total surgical excision. All patients were men (100%) and their mean age was 42.5 (range, 23-66) years. The patients underwent a total number of 21 operations. In 11 patients wounds were left open for secondary healing, and the mean time for complete wound healing in this group was 12.2 (range, 9.5-22) weeks. Two patients underwent primary wound closure by the application of rotation flaps, and their complete healing times were observed to be approximately 2 weeks. Delayed skin grafting was used for the remaining two patients in whom the wounds had been left open after the initial operation. In this group, complete wound healing took a total of 8 weeks. Only one diverting colostomy was needed in a patient in the delayed skin-grafting group. Squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed in the specimens of one patient treated with total excision followed by the application of a rotation flap. This patient had had complaints of gluteal discharge for approximately 30 years. The cancer recurred after 6 months in the perianal region and immediate abdominoperineal resection was performed. He died during the second postoperative month due to systemic\n\nObituary: George Hamilton Bowen Jr. (1925-2009)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWillson, Lee Anne; Struck, Curtis\n\n2011-12-01\n\nOur colleague and collaborator George Hamilton Bowen, Jr., passed away November 1, 2009 in Ames, Iowa. George was born June 20, 1925 in Tulsa, Oklahoma to George and Dorothy (Huntington) Bowen. He married Marjorie Brown June 19, 1948 in Redondo Beach, California; they had five children, with eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren at the time of his death. George H. Bowen's third or perhaps his fourth career was in astronomy. He was drafted into the navy in 1944, at the end of his first year as a student at Caltech, and ended his war-time service as an electronic technician on the aircraft carrier Shangri-La. He later said \"In just nine months, starting from scratch (Ohm's law!), we learned an amazing amount - not by memorization, of course, but by study and real understanding of the basic function of the most advanced AC circuits then being used for instrumentation, measurements, communications, control systems, and much more.\" He gained a confidence that he could quickly and accurately diagnose and solve technical problems that stood him well in future work. One accomplishment he took particular pride in was figuring out how the radar control used cams and gears to solve the trigonometry for accurate pointing. He also described how the captain was alarmed when weather conditions changed so that refraction no longer showed them distant, small boats around the curvature of Earth. After the war, George Bowen returned to undergraduate and eventually graduate study at Caltech, where he was recruited to the biophysics research group headed by future Nobel Laureate Max DelbrÃ¼ck. George often described his joy in working with these first-rate scientists and finding himself accepted as a part of the effort. He finished his BS with honors in 1949 and his PhD in 1953 with a thesis on \"Kinetic Studies on the Mechanism of Photoreactivation of Bacteriophase T2 Inactivated by Ultraviolet Light\" involving work with E Coli.

A retrospective review of a single quaternary referral centre's experience with PPD from January 1994 to December 2013 was performed. Medical records were reviewed to collect data on demographics, preoperative investigations, complications, pathology and recurrence. A review of existing literature was also performed. Five patients (four females, one male) with histologically confirmed PPD were identified. The median age of presentation was 72 (range 61 to 78). Three patients were recurrences following previous excisions and first presentations in two patients. Only one patient had an underlying diagnosis of cancer. The median time to diagnosis was 24 months. Four patients underwent wide local excision with skin graft and/or local flap reconstruction and one patient required an abdominoperineal excision for recurrence. Four patients had involved lateral margins despite wide local excision but follow-up to date has only revealed one local recurrence. A review of available literature suggests that synchronous cancers can occur in up to 33% of patients and that a further 10% may be associated with metachronous cancers. Surveillance recommendations seem anecdotal and do not appear to be supported by available literature. PPD is a management challenge. Association with synchronous and metachronous carcinomas may not be as strong as initially thought. Surgery is the mainstay treatment with the need to balance between minimizing disease recurrence and functional sequelae from excessive tissue loss.

A subset of pediatric patients with complex PCD require surgical intervention, although appropriate timing and treatment regimens remain unclear. This study aimed to describe a large pediatric cohort in a tertiary center to determine the range of surgical management in children with complex PCD. A retrospective review of children requiring operative intervention for PCD over 13 years (2002-2014) was performed. PCD was divided into simple and complex based on the type of surgical procedure, and the two groups were compared. The 57 children were divided into two groups: the simple group (N=43) underwent abscess drainage Â± seton insertion alone, and the complex group (N=14) underwent loop ileostomy Â± more extensive surgery. In the complex group, females were more predominant (57% of complex vs 30% of simple), and the average age at diagnosis was lower. Anti-TNF therapy was utilized in 79.1% of simple and 100% of complex PCD. All 14 complex patients underwent a defunctioning ileostomy, with 7 requiring further operations (subtotal colectomy=4, proctocolectomy Â± anal sparing=5, plastic surgery reconstruction with perineal flap/graft=4). Complex PCD represents a small but challenging subset of patients in which major surgical intervention may be necessary to alleviate the symptoms of this debilitating condition. retrospective case study with no control group - level IV.

When these data are evolved, they quickly approach a trumpet topology, suggesting that it would be preferable to use data that are in trumpet form from the outset. To achieve this, we extend the puncture method to allow the construction of Bowen-York trumpets, including an outline of an existence and uniqueness proof of the solutions. We construct boosted, spinning and binary Bowen-York puncture trumpets using a single-domain pseudospectral elliptic solver,moreÂ Â» and evolve the binary data and compare with standard wormhole-data results. We also show that for boosted trumpets the black-hole mass can be prescribed a priori, without recourse to the iterative procedure that is necessary for wormhole data.Â«Â less\n\nAll in the family: a belated response to Knudson-Martin's feminist revision of Bowen theory.\n\nPubMed\n\nHorne, K Blake; Hicks, Mary W\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe first formal attempt at revising Bowen theory within the marriage and family therapy literature is represented in the work of Knudson-Martin (1994).

In turn, we address several fundamental concerns with Knudson-Martin's critique and revision of Bowen theory. An alternative representation of Bowen Theory, as well as its relationship to feminist thought, is put forth.

Recurrent perianal inflammation has great etiologic diversity. A possible cause is cow's milk allergy (CMA). The aim was to assess the magnitude of this cause. Subjects and Methods. This follow up clinical study was carried out on 63 infants with perianal dermatitis of more than 3 weeks with history of recurrence. Definitive diagnosis was made for each infant through medical history taking, clinical examination and investigations including stool analysis and culture, stool pH and reducing substances, perianal swab for different cultures and staining for Candida albicans. Complete blood count and quantitative determination of cow's milk-specific serum IgE concentration were done for all patients. CMA was confirmed through an open withdrawal-rechallenge procedure. Serum immunoglobulins and CD markers as well as gastrointestinal endoscopies were done for some patients. Results. Causes of perianal dermatitis included CMA (47.6%), bacterial dermatitis (17.46%), moniliasis (15.87%), enterobiasis (9.52%) and lactose intolerance (9.5%). Predictors of CMA included presence of bloody and/or mucoid stool, other atopic manifestations, anal fissures, or recurrent vomiting. Conclusion. We can conclude that cow's milk allergy is a common cause of recurrent perianal dermatitis.

The key to understanding the treatment options and the likely success is deciphering the exact morphology of the tract(s) and the amount of sphincter involved. Our aim was to explore alternative platforms better to understand complex perianal fistulas through three-dimensional (3D) imaging and reconstruction. Methods: Digital imaging and communications in medicine images of spectral attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences were imported onto validated open-source segmentation software. A specialist consultant gastrointestinal radiologist performed segmentation of the fistula, internal and external sphincter. Segmented files were exported as stereolithography files. Cura (Ultimaker Cura 3.0.4) was used to prepare the files for printing on an Ultimaker 3 Extended 3D printer. Animations were created in collaboration with Touch Surgeryâ¢. Results: Three examples of 3D printed models demonstrating complex perianal fistula were created. The anatomical components are displayed in different colours: red: fistula tract; green: external anal sphincter and levator plate; blue: internal anal sphincter and rectum. One of the models was created to be split in half, to display the internal opening and allow complexity in the intersphincteric space to better evaluated. An animation of MRI fistulography of a trans-sphincteric fistula tract with a cephalad extension in the intersphincteric space was also created. Conclusion: MRI is the reference standard for assessment of perianal fistula, defining anatomy and guiding surgery. However, communication of findings between radiologist and surgeon remains challenging. Feasibility of 3D reconstructions of complex perianal fistula is realized, with the potential to improve surgical planning, communication with patients, and augment training.

Our aim was to define the success of SPCD management with a combined medical and surgical approach and to identify clinical and genetic factors predictive of healing. A retrospective chart review of patients with SPCD treated at the Penn State Milton S Hershey Medical Center was done. Primary end point was complete healing (ie normal clinical exam and no pain for at least 6 months). Genetic analysis of 185 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with Crohn's disease was performed in 78 patients. One hundred and thirty-five episodes of SPCD were identified in 114 patients with a mean follow-up of 77 Â± 7.4 months. Overall, 80 of 135 episodes healed (59.3%) and did not differ between those receiving anti-TNF and not (60.4% vs 56.8%). There appeared to be a consistent improved heal rate in each subcategory of surgically managed patients that received anti-TNF. Female sex was significantly predictive of healing in only those receiving anti-TNF agents (63.6% vs 25.0%; pÂ = 0.0005). Twenty-two (19.3%) patients ultimately received a permanent diversion with either a total proctocolectomy or completion proctectomy. Multivariate analysis suggested several single nucleotide polymorphisms in Crohn's disease-associated genes to be possibly associated with healing, but lost significance after Bonferroni correction. Overall, there is an approximate 60% rate of healing SPCD using a combined medical and surgical approach. About 20% of SPCD patients will require a permanent stoma. There were no clear genetic predictors of healing SPCD. Copyright Â© 2016 American College of Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated 300 rat and 200 mouse perianal impressions over 9 wk. Pinworm-positive perianal tape impressions from animals with worm burdens at necropsy were considered as true positives. Conversely, pinworm-negative perianal tape impressions from animals with worm burdens were considered false negatives. The sensitivity of perianal tape impressions for detecting Syphacia muris infections in rats was 100%, and for detecting Syphacia obvelata in mice was 85.5%. Intermittent shedding of Syphacia obvelata ova is the most probable explanation for the decreased sensitivity rate we observed in mice. We urge caution in use of perianal tape impressions alone for Syphacia spp. screening in sentinel mice and rats.\n\nBowen works with the Battery ORUs during EVA 1\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2010-05-17\n\nS132-E-008106 (17 May 2010) --- NASA astronaut Steve Bowen, STS-132 mission specialist, participates in the mission's first session of extravehicular acti"
