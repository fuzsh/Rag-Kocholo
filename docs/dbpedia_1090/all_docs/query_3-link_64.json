        "text": "The opening day of racing at the inaugural ISAF Sailing World Cup Final in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates has been described as spectacular, fantastic and perfect.\n\nSmiles were present before racing at the Abu Dhabi Sailing & Yacht Club, on the waters off of the Corniche and around Lulu Island and back ashore upon the conclusion of racing.\n\nA north westerly breeze that ranged between 9-14 knots greeted the sailors across the four race tracks. The outside courses saw big waves to add some spice to the sailors lives whilst the flat water on the inside Corniche course tested the sailors all round abilities.\n\nRacing for the 270 sailors from 38 nations across the ten Olympic and open kiteboarding fleet commenced at 12:00 local time and wrapped up with a full complement of races in the Olympic events.\n\nFinn\n\nSlovenia’s Vasilij Zbogar was dominant in Abu Dhabi’s conditions, picking up a pair of race wins in the 19-boat Finn fleet.\n\nAfter racing, ashore at the Abu Dhabi Sailing & Yacht, the Slovenian was visibly pleased yet shocked with his regatta opening, “I am a bit surprised with the two first places. It’s much better than I thought I would start. The conditions were perfect for my technique and weight and my boat speed was extremely good. The main issue was that I got a yellow flag in the first race which was a bit annoying but I still finished first.”\n\nZbogar’s victories came by different margins. A close encounter with Jake Lilley (AUS) in the opening race saw him take the victory by a narrow two seconds. He ramped it up in the second race, taking the gun by 30 seconds over Pieter Jan Postma (NED) and Zbogar wants to continue in the same way on the second day, “I hope we will have the same conditions. I will try to keep this first place until the end but I know it is going to be very hard. Today it was really nice sailing conditions and I’m looking forward to the next few days.”\n\nAbu Dhabi is a new venue for the Slovenian and he has taken to it well, not only the sailing side but offshore as well, “Until now, Abu Dhabi has been a big surprise for me. Everybody was a bit sceptical at first, maybe the venue and the sailing conditions weren’t right but here we are and people are extremely helpful, everything is extremely well organised and the sailing is spectacular.\n\n“I think all the sailors are really happy and they all see it’s a big step forward in Olympic classes.”\n\nLilley trails the Slovenia by five points in second place whilst Croatia’s Ivan Kljakovic Gaspic occupies third overall, a point behind Lilley.\n\n49erFX\n\nNew Zealand’s Alex Maloney and Molly Meech started the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final with a bang by taking the opening race victory in the 17-boat 49erFX fleet.\n\nThe pair picked up a second victory in the third race of the day but a sandwiched tenth tarnishes their good start. Nonetheless the Kiwis had some great racing as Maloney explained, “It was beautiful conditions out there with a nice Abu Dhabi breeze and really nice waves. We were on Course C in front of the Emirates Palace and it was pretty nice out there. The first and last race we had 8-10 knots and it dropped down and got a bit interesting, it’s really nice racing out there.\n\n“We were pretty disappointing with our performance at the Worlds but we had a good break and have had some good preparation for Abu Dhabi. We were in Rio for three weeks and we’re feeling a lot more confident again and a lot more focused.”\n\nWhilst the Kiwis lead, it’s the Italian pairing of Giulia Conti and Francesca Clapcich who were the masters of consistency as they notched up a race win and a pair of seconds. They sit second overall by nature of the Kiwis discarding their tenth and Conti’s face was full of smiles after racing, “It was perfect, perfect conditions. There were 10-14 knots with good waves and we enjoyed it a lot. We had good results and that’s why we enjoyed it a lot.\n\n“We felt very comfortable with the boat. It’s good to have a brand new boat as we used to sail with a pretty old one so there are a lot of differences in performance. It’s just perfect to escape from winter and to be here, we love it.”\n\nConti was also full of praise for everything she has seen thus far at the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final in Abu Dhabi, “We are staying in such a beautiful hotel and the people here are just so gentle and kind. They’re so curious about sailing as well. The venue is just perfect. There is plenty of space so we can move around without having the problem of touching other boats. The weather is warm and there is a huge mall right here, it has everything. I would stay here the whole winter.”\n\nSweden’s Lisa Ericson and Hanna Klinga complete the podium after the opening day but it’s still early stages in the competition with six fleet races to follow ahead of the Medal Race.\n\n49er\n\nCaptain America and Superman’s Polish alias’ Tomasz Januszewski and Jacek Nowak have swooped in to Abu Dhabi to take the 49er lead on the opening day of the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final.\n\nThe pair picked up two races wins and a 13th, discarding the latter to top the bill in the 18-boat 49er fleet. They lead Great Britain’s Dylan Fletcher and Alain Sign by a single point, “It’s great to be here and race here with the best of the best,” commented Nowak. “We were on Course D so we were inside the bay and the wind was inshore so there was a lot of shifts and gusts. It was good to have great speed and to be able to read the shifty conditions. All the teams were very close to each other throughout the races.”\n\nThe Polish competitors are instantly recognisable on the race track with their superhero outfits and Januszewski explained the origin of their tops, “We are co-operating with under armour, so when the t-shirts went on sale our friend gave us a couple of them.\n\n“He asked who we would like to be and I was just like, stop there, ‘I want to be Captain America’, because I love that superhero and Jack loves Superman.\n\n“After we first wore them everybody has called us Superman and Captain America,” continued Januszewski with a beaming smile, “They’re defending someone’s honour and ambitions so we like those and they’re really friendly, they’re not bad guys.\n\n“It’s a good way to show potential sponsors what we can do and how many opportunities we can give them.”\n\nThe racing on the 49er race course was exceptionally close with little separation of the fleet across three races. Fletcher and Sign picked up the first race victory before finishing second behind the Polish sailors in the second. The Brits did not sail the third race due to an equipment issue as the Polish sailors swooped through to take their second race win and the lead.\n\nJanuszewski and Nowak are in a good spot to progress with six fleet races and a Medal Race remaining and will be looking to draw on their super strength from within, “With any power you can achieve anything,” said Januszewski, “but if we were to have a power I think we’ll take super speed.”\n\nWomen’s RS:X\n\nGreat Britain’s Bryony Shaw stole the show in the Women’s RS:X taking three consecutive race victories to hold a steady lead over her rivals at the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe British racer, who won bronze at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Sailing Competition, was in exceptional form, mastering the conditions and ruling the waves on one of the outside course areas.\n\n“We were out on Course C today so we had quite a bit of swell and waves,” said Shaw. “The wind was between 10 and 13 knots and I was pleased to be sailing fast.”\n\nShaw proved to be a class above the rest as she read the conditions perfectly to lead at the first mark in all of the races as she explained, “I got a good start in the first race but not such a good start in the second race. The wind had just started flicking to the right so I made a gain from going to the right in that race. The first two races I rounded first and was able to extend my lead.\n\n“In the last race we had lighter winds. I had a great start by the committee boat and really good height and speed and managed to round first again. It was quite a physical race that one. I kept it quite simple and stayed between my competitors and the mark and managed to win that third race. It was a really good day.”\n\nWith 270 sailors from 38 nations competing in Abu Dhabi, the British sailor is just one of many competitors who are revelling in the Emirati capital. With a blend of old traditions in a modern metropolis there is plenty for the sailors to learn and enjoy, both on and off the water, “I’ve tried to immerse myself in the culture and we’ve been going out for dinners and the people here seem really friendly,” added Shaw. “The conditions today were fantastic. To be sailing out there in board shorts and for it to be warm, sunny and to be sailing in planing conditions is the best for windsurfing. I’ve had a great time here so far. It’s been a short regatta for them to try and set up but it’s going well.”\n\nChina’s Qiaoshan Weng is second overall following a third, second and a discarded 14th. Charline Picon (FRA), 2014 Women’s RS:X World Champion, is third overall after an up and down day that included a second, a fourth and a discarded 14th place finish.\n\nMen’s RS:X\n\nYoungsters Pawel Tarnowski (POL) and Louis Giard (FRA) are showing their experienced counterparts how to race in Abu Dhabi as they top the bill in the Men’s RS:X fleet.\n\nTarnowski, 20-years-old, stormed into the lead following an exceptional day on the water. He amassed two race wins and a third and holds a two point advantage over Giard, 21-years-old, who took a pair of seconds and a third.\n\nThe youngsters lead their more experienced rivals but only time will tell if they are able to continue it through for a podium finish on Sunday 30 November.\n\nLaser Radial\n\nTuula Tenkanen (FIN) is in control in the 18-boat Laser Radial pack. She picked up a fourth and a first to hold a five point advantage over Alison Young (GBR) going into the second day of competition.\n\nYoung has had some time away from the boat throughout 2014 and is happy to be back, competing against the best Laser Radial sailors in Abu Dhabi, “It’s been great fun racing against all the great sailors that are here this week. I’m here this week to learn as much as possible. There are 18 great sailors here so every race is really tight and every point counts.\n\n“It was such tight racing today out on the water with boats crossing the line in packs and I expect that will be a similar story for the rest of the regatta.”\n\nLondon 2012 bronze medallist Evi Van Acker (BEL) completes the podium at the early stage of the event.\n\nLaser\n\nWorld #1 Tom Burton (AUS) showed his worth in Abu Dhabi by grasping the Laser lead after the opening day of racing. Burton was strong on the race track and took a fifth and a bullet and was pleased after racing, “It was pretty solid day all around,” commented Burton, “The top guys are all here and with the 20 boat fleet you can’t afford to have a bad race because the guys that will win this regatta, won’t do that so you won’t have a chance to catch up.”\n\nPavlos Kontides (CYP) took the first race win but an 11th in the second race relegated him down to fifth overall.\n\nISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao gold medallist Tonci Stipanovic (CRO) is tied on points with Burton in second whilst Nick Thompson (GBR) occupies third.\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nIt was business as usual for World Champions Mat Belcher and Will Ryan (AUS) in the Men’s 470. The pair strolled into pole position following a 2-4 scoreline. Greece’s Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis are second on eight points with Austria’s David Bargehr and Lukas Mahr in third on ten points.\n\nThe day’s race wins went the way of Stu McNay and David Hughes (USA) who are sixth overall and fifth placed Matthias Schmid and Florian Florian Reichsteaedter (AUT).\n\nChina’s Shasha Chen and Haiyan Gao and Austria’s Lara Vadlau and Jolanta Ogar shared places one and two in the Women’s 470 and are tied atop of the 11-boat fleet on three points.\n\nVery little separated the two teams on the opening day and they will do battle once again on the second day with two more races scheduled.\n\nAmerica’s Anne Haeger and Briana Provancha are third overall on 10 points, seven off the leading duo but there is plenty of time for change.\n\nNacra 17\n\nIt’s an all French top three in the Nacra 17 with World Champions Billy Besson and Marie Riou leading the way. Besson and Riou are seemingly unstoppable in the Nacra 17 and amassed a steady scoreline that featured two seconds and a race win.\n\nTheir compatriots Audrey Ogereau and Matthieu Vandame follow in second with Moana Vaireaux and Manon Audinet in third.\n\nMatias Buhler and Nathalie Brugger (SUI), Vittorio Bissaro and Silvia Sicouri (ITA) and Thomas Zajac and Tanja Frank (AUT) are hot on the French teams heals, tied on nine points.\n\nOpen Kiteboarding\n\nRiccardo Leccese (ITA) came out on top on the opening day of kiteboarding after he picked up a pair of bullets. He heads into the next stage as top seed. 2014 World Champion Maxime Nocher (FRA), European and Open Asian Champion Oliver Bridge (GBR) and 2013 World Champion Florian Gruber (GER) follow in places 2-4.\n\nThe 20 competitors will be divided up for Stage 2 heats on Friday and Saturday based on their seeding from Stage 1. The top ten boats will then progress to the medal stage.\n\nTwo semi-finals will be held with five racers in each. Places 1 and 2 will carry forward ten points, 3 and 4 seven points, 5 and 6 five points, 7 and 8 four points and 9 and 10 three points. Two races in each semi-final will follow with the top two placed sailors in each heading to the final.\n\nFrom there, it’s a four way single race shoot out for the podium spots.\n\nRacing across the fleets is scheduled to commence at 12:00 local time on Friday 28 November.\n\nIt was a light wind, big wave finish at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao aså the medallists were decided across the six fleets competing on the waters of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Sailing Competition.\n\nByron Kokkalanis (GRE) had wrapped up gold in the Men’s RS:X the day prior but intriguing battles for gold across the remaining fleets played out in a tense day of competition.\n\nThe stakes were high with Qingdao medals on the line, a share of the prize money and invitation places at stake for the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final set to be held at the end of November in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\nLaser\n\nTonci Stipanovic (CRO) overcame Pavlos Kontides (CYP) in a two man duel for gold and silver in the Laser.\n\nThe duo were split by four points and held an unassailable lead going into the Medal Race so it was inevitable that they would lock horns from the off as they fought tooth and nail.\n\nStipanovic explained proceedings from his eyes, “Today I decided I would go on Pavlos immediately from the start. I was trying to stay really close and get him away from the start but he was time staying in the middle of the line all the time and 30 seconds before the start I made a mistake and I opened up the doors for him.\n\n“It was really tricky and I was pushing hoping he would make one mistake. At the first upwind mark I was last but it was not so bad as I caught some breeze and after 50 metres on the downwind I was only two metres behind him.\n\n“On the second upwind we were together and he didn’t follow me and that was a chance for me and I took it and came in front of him and after that I controlled him.”\n\nKontides was left to rue not following the Croatian as he analysed his race, “From the start I had a huge advantage but the wind was really tricky and you didn’t know where it was coming from. I had two options after the gate, to tack immediately and cover him or proceed a bit more and wait for the right shift. I thought the right would pay. By proceeding I was depending on the wind and the wind went left and I went right so I was wrong in my estimation and then I ended up behind him.\n\n“It was always going to be hard because he will always push you over the layline and then it’s game over.\n\n“I’m happy with how I sailed but I’m disappointed not to get gold, I have many silvers and now I have one more to the tally but I will keep on fighting. If I keep on sailing like I have this week then the gold will be pretty near.”\n\nThe fight was also on for bronze with Tom Burton (AUS) sitting ahead of Wannes Van Laer (BEL) by just one point before the Medal Race.\n\nBurton came through in third, three places ahead of Van Laer to take bronze but there were a few nerves on the race track, “The first beat everybody had a close eye on each other. I wasn’t looking too good at the top mark. Wannes was in front by a few boats so I just had to stay close and put a bit of pressure on him. I managed to get a bit of pressure on the second beat and just snuck past and held off to the finish\n\n“I’m reasonably happy. It’s nice to finish a tough week, I wasn’t happy with the way I was sailing. The guys at the front were really on to it. You’ve got to be on top of your game.”\n\nStipanovic, Kontides and Burton have already booked their plane tickets for the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final. The spot was wide open and Wannes van Laer’s fourth gave him the spot. As top Asian finisher, Colin Cheng (SIN) also receives an invitation.\n\nLaser Radial\n\nDongshuang Zhang (CHN) defended her ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao title after a tight week of Laser Radial sailing.\n\nZhang, Tatiana Drozdovskaya (BLR), Tina Mihelic (CRO) and Sara Winther (NZL) were all extremely tight heading into the Medal Race. With the points close anything was possible.\n\nWith a light frame and knowledge of Qingdao’s waters Zhang navigated the tricky conditions with expertise. She came through in third and most importantly well ahead of her three rivals, taking gold by 11 points. With a successful defence Zhang was beaming after racing, “I am really happy with the result and really happy to win in Qingdao, again,” said Zhang. “My performance was very good in today’s wind conditions. In the whole of the event sometimes the wind was strong and the direction was not one I’m used my performance was solid and I just tried my best to get as high as possible. I am really happy with my performance.”\n\nIt was a late finish the day prior with protests aplenty in the Laser Radial fleet. Mihelic was disqualified from the penultimate race and dropped out of the medals heading into the final day.\n\nWith the pressure high and needing a result the Croatian did not fail to deliver and finished ahead of Winther and Drozdovskaya to take silver, “The Medal Race was a really nervous race with lots of protests because four of us were really close. In the end I managed to finish fifth and end up with enough points to finish ahead of the girls from New Zealand and Belarus.\n\n“It was a light wind race so it was hard. There were a lot of jury out there so we had to be careful not to get penalised. It was really nervous with a few shifts and the wind going up and down.\n\n“Coming from fourth to second is a good feeling.”\n\nDrozdovskaya came through in last spot in the Medal Race and dropped out of the medal positions. Despite receiving a standard penalty, Winther held on to a podium position, taking bronze.\n\nWinther’s third place gives her an ISAF Sailing World Cup Final invitation spot. Min Gu (CHN) was the top Asian sailor and therefore receives an invitation.\n\nMen’s 470\n\nJordi Xammar and Joan Herp (ESP) took their first ISAF Sailing World Cup victory with a strong performance in Qingdao.\n\nThe two time Junior World Champions took a good lead into the Medal Race and a seventh was enough for them to take gold by four points over Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis (GRE). Xammar and Herp, who celebrated his 21st birthday on the final day, have thrived in Qingdao and having played down their chances in advance walk away as deserved victors.\n\n“It’s incredible to finish this regatta like this,” said Herp. “We didn’t expect this result before we came here but we sailed very well over the last few days and the Medal Race was tough because everybody was very close and anybody could put a boat in between us but that is sailing and we have to manage the pressure. We’re very happy about the ending.”\n\nIt’s been a fantastic year for the young Spaniards who have a string of achievements under their belts as Xammar concluded, “We are really happy with our season. We won the Junior Worlds and Europeans and finished seventh at the worlds and that was incredible for us. Now, coming here to a World Cup in Qingdao and winning is like… We thought Santander was the perfect thing and that was the end but coming here and winning our first World Cup in our lives is really good. This isn’t junior sailing; all the seniors are here with years of experience.\n\n“It’s amazing.”\n\nPanagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis (GRE) were the early leaders in the Men’s 470 but trailed the Spaniards by ten points heading into the Medal Race. A fourth compared to Xammar and Herp’s seventh was not enough for them to reduce the deficit but they did maintain second overall. “The Medal Race was difficult for us,” explained Mantis. “We tried to start close to both Spanish boats, we achieved that but we wanted to keep the right side but we ended up with the left side and we managed to pass the top mark not in a good position.\n\n“We were almost losing second place. We tried to recover and we finished fourth and this gave us the silver medal. We are very happy about this because it’s always very good to get a medal in an ISAF Sailing World Cup regatta.”\n\nOnan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera (ESP) round off the podium.\n\nHenrique Haddad and Bruno Amorim (BRA) and Zangjun Xu and Wei Wang (CHN) are the recipients of an ISAF Sailing World Cup Final invitation.\n\nWomen’s 470\n\nIt was victory for home nation sailors Mengxi Wei and Yani Xu in the Women’s 470 who sealed the deal with a second place in the Medal Race. They have been the standout performers in the Women’s 470 finishing out of the top two on just two occasions across the week.\n\nAfter racing Wei said, “I feel very grown up and happy that I have won here. I feel very lucky to come to Qingdao and represent China. I am honoured and proud to win a gold medal.”\n\nXiaomei Xu and Ping Zhang (CHN) took silver with a third in the Medal Race\n\nShasha Chen and Haiyan Gao (CHN) pushed Ai Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (JPN) out of the medal places after taking the final race victory. The Japanese pair could only muster a fifth which saw them miss out on bronze by three points.\n\nAs winners Wei and Xu receive an ISAF Sailing World Cup Final invitation.\n\nMen’s RS:X\n\nWith Byron Kokkalanis (GRE) wrapping up gold ahead of the Medal Race all eyes were on the fight for silver and bronze between Aichen Wang (CHN) and Max Oberemko (RUS).\n\nFive points split the pair ahead of the Medal Race, so it was game on. Oberemko knew what needed to be done and had a tremendous first upwind to hold the lead but Wang was hot on his heels rounding in second.\n\nOberemko stayed at the front of the fleet but Wang was persistent and kept up with his pace. Oberemko edged away from Wang as the race played out but unfortunately for the Russian, Wang was also extending his advantage over third place. Oberemko took the bullet and Wang came through with a comfortable second to seal silver.\n\nKokkalanis stayed out of their way throughout the race with a relaxed demeanour on the race course. He concluded the event with a fifth place in the Medal Race.\n\nThe Greek sailor has been a class above the rest of the fleet and has loved the ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao experience, “It feels really nice to be in Qingdao, the venue of the Beijing Olympics, and win an event like this.\n\n“It was a really nice experience to see the place, the marina, the feeling and knowing it hosted such a big event. To see the conditions that everybody was talking about, that it was really hard, humid and light winds. Basically the period now is the best and it’s a really nice temperature. It was an amazing week. We had all sorts of conditions so it was one of the best regattas I’ve had this year.”\n\nWith Kokkalanis qualifying for Abu Dhabi at the Santander 2014 ISAF Worlds, Aichen Wang (CHN) receives the invitational spot as the next leading sailor.\n\nWomen’s RS:X\n\nJiahui Wu (CHN) took gold in the Women’s RS:X, holding off Olga Maslivets (RUS) in the Medal Race to seal the deal. The Chinese sailor moved into pole position the day prior after Maslivets received a disqualification.\n\nSun came through in fifth compared to Maslivets’ seventh that ensured she finished 11.4 points ahead of the Russian.\n\nAfter racing Wu said, “The weather and wind has been good. I have tried my best throughout the whole competition and I feel really good about winning. I have been confident throughout the competition.”\n\nMaslivets knew what she had to do in the Medal Race and worked hard on the water, putting her final efforts into the race but in the light breeze she was unable to find an edge and missed out on gold. Nonetheless she was pleased with her performance, “I’m still happy as I’ve just come back onto the RS:X after two years out. It’s good to be back on the track and I feel happy in the RS:X again.\n\n“It’s a different Qingdao to the one I knew and I liked it more because we had good winds, really nice winds from the sea which we never had six years ago. I like the challenging conditions with the difficult current and the waves.”\n\nHongmei Shi (CHN) blitzed the field in the Medal race, taking the bullet which subsequently moved her into third overall after Mei Hao floundered in ninth position. Shi took bronze by just a single point over Hao.\n\nWith Sun already invited to Abu Dhabi, the invitation is given to Olga Maslivets (RUS).\n\nNext up for many of the racers is the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates from 26-30 November.\n\nIt was a light wind day at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao with many ups and downs across the six fleets competing on the Beijing 2008 Olympic waters.\n\nAfter a short early afternoon delay the sailors headed out onto the water with a shifty breeze and strong current that would once again test them to the max.\n\nOne race was completed in the Men’s and Women’s 470, Laser and Laser Radial whilst the Men’s and Women’s RS:X packs, sailing shorter races, completed two.\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nHome nation sailors Mengxi Wei and Yani Xu (CHN) have been head and shoulders above the rest in the Women’s 470 across five completed races. The Chinese pair were bang on form again on the third day of the competition in the single Women’s 470 race.\n\nWith a great start Wei and Xu took the lead from the off. At the first mark they held a five second advantage over Ai Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (JPN). The Chinese leaders slowly extended the gap to 11 seconds at the end of the first downwind. The Japanese pair kept Wei and Xu within their sights but pushed a little too hard and received a penalty that relegated them down the pack. After racing a disappointed Kondo said, “The current was very strong and close to the shore. It was really difficult for racing and I got a penalty. The wind was down and difficult today.”\n\nWhilst Wei and Xu had lost the Japanese pair they had new company. China’s Shasha Chen and Haiyan Gao managed to read the conditions well and moved up from tenth to second. However Wei and Xu showed their strength and took the bullet ahead of Chen and Gao.\n\nWei and Xu sit pretty at the top of the pack on five points whilst three points separates Xiaomei Xu and Ping Zhang (CHN), Chen and Gao and Japan’s Kondo and Yoshioka.\n\nThere were several big up and downs in the single Men’s 470 race as the current made life tough. The fleet of 17 were forced to sail above the layline to take the current into account. Several teams read the situation well and flourished whilst others fell back in a game of snakes and ladders.\n\nHenrique Haddad and Bruno Bethlem (BRA) took their chances and rounded the first mark ahead of South Africa’s Asenathi Jim and Roger Hudson who just missed the layline. The Brazilians were able to extend their advantage as the race played eventually taking the bullet.\n\nBehind them the fleet were up and down. Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis (GRE) and Jordi Xammar and Joan Herp (ESP) held a joint lead coming into the day. There was very little separating the teams early on in the race but the Greeks were penalised and dropped down the pack eventually finishing 14th, which they discard.\n\nXammar and Herp were more fortunate and worked their way to a solid second which Xammar explained at the end of the day, “Well it was a difficult race. We are very happy with our result. Going into tomorrow we are first and we are really happy. It was really hard racing, a lot of current, a lot of changes in pressure and shifts.\n\n“We had to really concentrate and watch the next mark all the time to see the pressure. We were a bit lucky but we managed to finish second.”\n\nThe young Spaniards hold the lead on nine points. Mantis and Kagialis are second on 13 points whilst Pavel Sozykin and Denis Gribanov (RUS) maintain third overall.\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nAn intriguing battle is developing within the Laser Radial with small margins separating the top four sailors.\n\n2013 ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao gold medallist Dongshuang Zhang (CHN) has the lead on nine points following victory in the single Radial race.\n\nZhang displayed excellent tactical nous in the light winds at the 2013 edition of the regatta and she thrived in the conditions on the third day of the 2014 regatta, taking the bullet by eight seconds over Croatia’s Ana Zelic.\n\nZhang has a four point lead over Tatiana Drozdovskaya (BLR), Tina Mihelic (CRO) and Sara Winther (NZL) who are all tied on 13 points. With three races scheduled on the penultimate day much can change with ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao honours on the line.\n\nTonci Stipanovic (CRO) is the Laser master of Qingdao’s light winds and strong current. The Croatian picked up his fourth bullet of the regatta in the only Laser race and holds a six point lead over Pavlos Kontides (CYP) heading into the penultimate day.\n\nJust nine points separate third to eighth in the Laser with three races remaining.\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nByron Kokkalanis (GRE) continues to lead the Men’s RS:X despite a less than convincing day in the lighter breeze. The Greek sailor’s overnight 16 point lead was reduced to 11 points following a fifth and a discarded ninth.\n\nAichen Wang (CHN) enjoyed one of his best days of racing posting a bullet and a third to subsequently reduce Kokkalanis’ advantage. Max Oberemko (RUS) remains third overall but Michael Cheng (HKG) is piling on the pressure as he sits just four points behind.\n\nOlga Maslivets (RUS) Women’s RS:X lead stands at nearly 20 points heading into penultimate day. With a redress of 4.4 points and a fifth she is on 19.4 points. Jiali Sun (CHN) stole the day with a light wind master class. Many Chinese sailors are known for being strong in the lighter breeze and Sun exemplified that by taking a bullet and a second. As a result she moves to second overall, sitting on 37 points.\n\nHongmei Shi (CHN) is third overall on 47 points.\n\nRacing is scheduled to commence at 12:00 local time on Friday 17 October.\n\nIt was a day of tight battles and close knit racing at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao as the six fleets enjoyed a strong breeze in Qingdao, China.\n\nThere were several close finishes across the fleets with 13-18 knots of south westerly breeze and up to 2.5 knots of current on the race track making life tough for the 171 sailors from 21 nations.\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nGreece’s Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis and Spain’s Jordi Xammar and Joan Herp are tied at the top on seven points in the Men’s 470 following an exciting day of racing.\n\nWith big breeze, strong current and plenty of waves Xammar and Herp stole the day as they posted two second places. However it could have been better as they lost out on a bullet in the opening race of the day.\n\nThe Spaniards took the lead early on in the race and held a narrow advantage over Mantis and Kagialis as the race played out. On the downwind run to the finish the Greek pair piled on the pressure and started to reduce the Spaniards lead with the finish line approaching.\n\nXammar and Herp kept their head on a swivel, keeping an eye on the Greeks whilst Mantis and Kagialis pushed on. Herp explained what occurred, “They gybed first and then we gybed just after them and they seemed to be gaining an advantage little by little. Thirty seconds before the finish line we took a big wave just at the moment they gybed and then we waited too long to gybe again. If we would have gybed earlier we would have had a safe lead but we waited and then we entered the finish at exactly the same moment.\n\n“It was a photo finish.”\n\nThe Greeks had done enough to take the bullet to continue their solid start. After racing Mantis said, “It was tough. It was shifty and it was difficult to see a breeze because there was a fog. We had a good battle, we had some gybes and some big waves and in the end it was a photo finish at the line. It was nice.”\n\nIn the second race of the day, fourth in total, Russia’s Pavel Sozykin and Denis Gribanov took the bullet with Xammar and Herp coming in second. The Spaniards made up for their disappointment in the first race of the day, moving through the pack. Herp concluded, “We were the best team of the day. We thought we would finish third but on the last downwind we were very fast and we were able to pass the Chinese guys. The left paid all day and we had good speed and we are happy with our day.”\n\nAs it stands the leading Greek and Spanish teams have a five point advantage over Sozykin and Gribanov and Onan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera (ESP).\n\nChina’s Wei Mengxi and Yani Xu maintained their solid start in the Women’s 470 with a bullet and a fourth. Their advantage stands at five points over their compatriots Xiaomei Xu and Zhang Ping.\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nOlga Maslivets (RUS) holds an 11 point lead in the Women’s RS:X following an up and down day. She opened her account with a first and second but after a couple of errors she dropped down to 16th in the final race of the day. Nonetheless, as she discards her 16th, she leads the way on 10 points and is enjoying being back in Qingdao.\n\n“It’s like huge deja-vu after the Olympics in 2008,” commented Maslivets. “I really love the place and it feels so wonderful to be here especially with these good winds. The Chinese are really good competitors in all conditions. It’s their home waters so it’s really competitive. It’s tough to beat them but it’s really fun.”\n\nLu Yunxiu (CHN) sits in second with Hao Mei (CHN) a point behind in third.\n\nGreece’s Byron Kokkalanis continues to dominate in the Men’s RS:X and put in another strong showing on the race track. From three races Kokkalanis took two bullets and a third to give him a 16 point lead heading into the third day.\n\nExperienced racers Aichen Wang (CHN) and Max Oberemko (RUS) trail Kokkalanis in second and third.\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nTatiana Drozdovskaya (BLR) excelled in the Laser Radial, posting double bullets to move into the lead. The Belarusian, 2013 ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao silver medallist, was clinical in the stronger breeze and current. However, Drozdovskaya is just one point ahead of Tina Mihelic (CRO) who discards her ninth in Race 1 following a third and a second.\n\n2013 ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao gold medallist Dongshuang Zhang (CHN) is third on eight points with Sara Winther (NZL) a point behind.\n\nTonci Stipanovic (CRO) maintained his lead in the Laser after he picked up his third race win of the regatta. The Croatian won gold in 2013 and has been using his knowledge of the venue to full effect, mastering the strong current that rips across the race area.\n\nOn the opening day Australia’s Tom Burton struggled with the current but was back to his best from the off on the second day. He took the bullet ahead of Pavlos Kontides but slipped 12th in Race 4.\n\nKontides stays in second overall whilst Wannes Van Laer (BEL) is third.\n\nThe wind is expected to decrease for the third day of competition. Racing is scheduled to commence at 13:00 local time.\n\nMore than 150 sailors from 25 nations racing across six classes are set to compete at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao in China from 14-18 October 2014.\n\nAs the dust settles on the ISAF Sailing World Championships many of the racers are heading east to compete at the second edition of ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao.\n\nRacing across the Men’s and Women’s 470, Laser, Laser Radial and Men’s and Women’s RS:X will take place across three race courses at the venue of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Sailing Competition. Strong Chinese contingents as well as international excellence will make up the six fleets ensuring an exciting week of racing in China.\n\nCompetitors across the six events will be vying for their share of the 180,000USD prize money. 18,000 USD will be awarded to the gold medallist with 8,000 USD and 4,000 USD going to second and third place.\n\nThe Men’s 470 fleet will see 22-boats line up on the start line in Qingdao with a blend of experience and youth amongst the entrants.\n\n2013 and 2014 Junior 470 World Champions Jordi Xammar and Joan Herp (ESP) made major inroads at the Santander 2014 ISAF Worlds, finishing seventh overall. The pair took the Medal Race bullet in Santander and having proven they can beat some of the finest Men’s 470 sailors Xammar is coy on his team’s chances in Qingdao, “It would be great [to win] but I think it is too early to take a win in a senior event and we have still many things to learn but for sure we are going to fight as much as we can.\n\n“Our aim for the World Cup in Qingdao is to keep learning from the best sailors and give our best in every race, we don’t want to fight for one place, just try to be as higher as possible.\n\n“We are expecting a really high level competition and we know that the starts are going to be very important because with a bad start is going to be very difficult to recover.”\n\nThe competition is set to be high in the Men’s 470 with World #3 Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis (GRE), World #6 Sofian Bouvet and Jeremie Mion (FRA) and two time Olympian Onan Barreiros with crew Juan Curbelo Cabrera (ESP) joining Xammar and Herp in the pack.\n\nThe Women’s 470 fleet will see a tight knit 10 boat fleet take to the water. The experienced Ai Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (JPN) will go into the event as favourites but with World #10 Shasha Chen and Haiyan Gao (CHN) and a young, fresh Chinese team joining them they will have their work cut out.\n\nA fleet of 37 will make up the Laser fleet and the level will be high. World #1 Tom Burton (AUS), World #3 Tonci Stipanovic (CRO) and World #4 Pavlos Kontides (CYP) will be within the fleet.\n\nStipanovic and Kontides occupied the top two spots at the 2013 edition of ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao and will no doubt be two of the front runners again. On the week ahead Kontides said, “The Laser class always has tough competition. My goal is to simply sail with fewer mistakes as possible and by doing that I know I can battle for those places on the podium. Last year I was second so improvement will be achieved only by winning gold.”\n\nA mixed bag of conditions tested the fleet at the 2013 edition and more of the same is expected in 2014 as Kontides added, “Last year was a good warm up event for the worlds and a verification that sailing is an all-round sport as we had all kinds of conditions.\n\n“Qingdao is a venue with different sailing conditions from what we are used to sailing in and it is always challenging to sail there. Sport is all about challenge so I am excited to return there to compete.”\n\nWith the likes of Kontides, Stipanovic and Burton within the pack alongside further talent such as Bruno Fontes (BRA), Thomas Saunders (NZL), Karl-Martin Rammo (EST), Colin Cheng and Wannes Van Laer (BEL), the going will be tough for all those involved with 200 ISAF World Ranking points on offer to the winner.\n\nTatiana Drozdovskaya (BLR) was forced down to the back of the pack in the Laser Radial Medal Race at the 2013 version of ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao and missed out on gold as Dongshuang Zhang (CHN) claimed the honours. The Belorussian makes a return to avenge her defeat.\n\nJoining Drozdovskaya in the fleet will be Italy’s Laura Cosentino who is making her second visit to China as she explained, “I’m really looking forward to racing in Qingdao. I was in Rizhao last year for the Radial World Championship where we had some good racing, I hope it will be the same also in Qingdao.\n\n“I think it will be a weird competition, even if it’s a World Cup regatta we are only few competitors. In the Laser Radial we are used to sailing in big fleets, so it will be a totally different kind of racing, more similar to a Medal Race.”\n\nFurther competition for the top places will come from Singapore’s Elizabeth Yin, New Zealand’s Sara Winther and Russia’s Elena Vorobeva.\n\n2014 ISAF Sailing World Cup Miami gold medallist Byron Kokkalanis (GRE) will lead the line in the 37 strong Men’s RS:X fleet in Qingdao. After starting 2014 off with a golden bang in Miami, following up with Sailing World Cup Mallorca silver, the Greek racer missed out on a podium place at the European, Olympic Test Event and Santander 2014 ISAF Worlds.\n\nNot one to dwell on missed chances Kokkalanis is aiming to get back to top spot in Qingdao, “My goal is to win the competition,” said Kokkalanis, “and of course the prize money since we’ve never had competitions with prize money. My other goal is to also get high in the ISAF World Rankings.”\n\nKokkalanis campaigned for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Sailing Competition but missed out on selection so will be making his first trip to Qingdao. Kokkalanis concluded, “I’m really looking forward to competing in the place of the 2008 Olympics. I expect the competition to be very hard in light winds.”\n\nJoining Kokkalanis in the fleet will be a strong Chinese contingent as well as Hong Kong’s Ho Tsun Leung, Italy’s Marcantonio Baglione and Maksim Oberemko (RUS).\n\nThirty one sailors will make up the Women’s RS:X fleet. The Chinese team have been ones to watch in recent months in the Women’s RS:X with many of their team impressing on the international stage. Leading the charge will be 2013 World Cup Qingdao and 2014 World Cup Hyeres silver medallist Jiahui Wu (CHN) and 2013 World Cup Melbourne gold medallist Manjia Zheng (CHN).\n\nRacing is scheduled to commence on 14 October Medal Races bringing the regatta to a close on 18 October."
