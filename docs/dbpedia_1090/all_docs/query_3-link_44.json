With a second, a first and a discarded seventh on the closing day they held on to third place overall. Taking the overall honours in the 49er was Mattieu Frei and Yann Rocherieux (FRA) who held off competition from Julien d'Ortoli and Noe Delpech (FRA). The experienced Iker Martinez, sailing with Iago Lopez, finished fourth overall but took silver in the Spanish championship.\n\nJuan Manuel Moreno (ESP) was consistent in the Men's RS:X fleet but was not as impressive as overall winner Dimitrii Poleshenuk (RUS). The pair jostled throughout the ten race series and the third race of the series was the only one where neither took the bullet. However the Russian finished three points clear of Merono who had to settle with the Spanish title.\n\nAmong the Women's R:SX fleet Seville's Pilar Gonzalez Lamadrid claimed the national title. Lamadrid shared second and first place results throughout the week with overall winner Anzhela Polubarova (RUS). Across the seven race series the Russian won five races compared to the Spaniards two to take the overall title.\n\nMeanwhile Toni Bonet (ESP) put his name on the Men's RS:X Youth Spanish title with Artem Javadav (BLR) taking the overall top spot ahead of club mate Mikita Tsirkun (BLR).\n\nIn the Laser fleet Antony Munos (FRA) held off Spanish national champion Jesus Rogel Sanchez (ESP) by two points as he claimed the overall title. Mattis Naud (FRA) rounded off the podium.\n\nA strong Laser Radial fleet featured London 2012 Olympian Annalise Murphy (IRL) who finished off the podium by three points as Belgium's Emma Plasschaert, tied with Amelie Riou (FRA) on 21 points, won gold by countback having won three of 11 races. France's Mathilde de Kerangat completed the podium. Taking the Spanish title was Martina Reino Cacho who came down in eighth place overall.\n\nPortugal's Antonio Matos Rosa and Ricardo Schedel finished 12 points clear in the Men's 470 fleet take the gold medal. Onan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo (ESP) finished second overall and subsequently took the Spanish title. Rounding off the podium is Russia's Mikhaill Sheremekiev and Maksim Schrenietiev (RUS). The Women's title went to Alisa Kirilyuk and Dmitrieva Luydmila (RUS).\n\nA small four boat Finn fleet saw Federico Melo (POR) win overall and the Spanish title went the way of Pablo Guitian Sarria Federacion Andaluza de ISAF website\n\nIf you want to link to this article then please use this URL: www.sail-world.com/107147"
