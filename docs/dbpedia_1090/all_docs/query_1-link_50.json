Moreover, it was shown to be the subunit 5 of human prefoldin (PFD. So far, this gene and its homologs have been isolated and sequenced in many organisms, such as mammals and fish, but has not been sequenced for any amphibian or reptile. In order to better understand the function and evolution of Mm-1, we isolated a full-length Mm-1 cDNA (BgMm-1, GenBank accession no. EF211947 from Bufo gargarizans (Cantor, 1842 using RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends methods. Mm-1 in B. gargarizans is 755 bp long, comprising an open reading frame (ORF of 459 bp encoding 152 amino acids. The amino acid sequence had a prefoldin Î±-like domain, partially including a typical putative leucine zipper motif. BgMm-1 showed high similarity to its homolog of Mus musculus Linnaeus, 1758 (82% and Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758 MM-1 isoform a (81% at the amino acid level. The protein secondary structure modeled with the SWISS MODEL server revealed that there were two Î±-helices and four b-strands in BgMm-1 as its human orthologue, and both proteins belonged to the a class of PFD family. The phylogenetic relationships of Mm-1s from lower archaea to high mammals was consistent with the evolution of species, meanwhile the cluster result was consistent with the multiple alignment and the sequence identity analysis. RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that BgMm-1 expressed widely in ten tissues of adult toad. These results can be helpful for the further investigation on the evolution of Mm-1.\n\nTranscriptomics provides mechanistic indicators of fluoride toxicology on endochondral ossification in the hind limb of Bufo gargarizans.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChao, Wu; Zhang, Yuhui; Chai, Lihong; Wang, Hongyuan\n\n2018-06-10\n\nEndochondral ossification, the process by which most of the bone is formed, is regulated by many specific groups of molecules and extracellular matrix components. Hind limb of Bufo gargarizans is a model to study endochondral ossification during metamorphosis. Chinese toad (Bufo gargarizans) were exposed to different fluoride concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10 and 20â¯mgâ¯L -1 ) from G3 to G42. The development of hind limb of B. gargarizans was observed using the double staining methodology. The transcriptome of hind limb of B. gargarizans was conducted using RNA-seq approach, and differentially expressed gene was also validated. In addition, the location of Sox9 and Ihh in the growth cartilage was determined using in situ hybridization. Our results showed that 5â¯mgâ¯L -1 stimulated bone mineralization, while 10 and 20â¯mgâ¯L -1 exposure could inhibit the tibio-fibula, tarsus and metacarpals ossification. Besides, 10â¯mg F/L treatment could down-regulate Ihh, Sox9, D2, D3, TRÎ±, TRÎ², Wnt10, FGF3 and BMP6 expression, while up-regulate ObRb and HHAT mRNA expression in the hind limb of B. gargarizans. Transcript level changes of Ihh, Sox9, D2, D3, TRÎ±, TRÎ², Wnt10, FGF3 and BMP6 were consistent with the results of RT-qPCR. In situ hybridization revealed that Ihh was expressed in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, while Sox9 was abundantly expressed in proliferous, prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes. However, 10â¯mg F-/L did not cause any affect in the location of the Ihh and Sox9 mRNA. Therefore, high concentration of fluoride could affect the ossification-related genes mRNA expression and then inhibit the endochondral ossification. The present study thus will greatly contribute to our understanding of the effect of environmental contaminant on ossification in amphibian. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 197 samples from eight sites were examined, which cover a large range of elevations (559-3457 m), as well as all three traditionally defined species (or subspecies). AMOVA did not reveal any particularly large among-groups structure, whether the sites were grouped by drainage, elevation, region, or species (subspecies). Individual assignment tests placed all samples into two genetic clusters, which largely corresponded to their geographic locations. An isolation-by-distance pattern was also detected when an outlier population (site 3) was excluded. Furthermore, a mitochondrial gene tree revealed deep divergence among haplotypes, sometimes within the same site. The clade patterns were partially associated with geographic distribution but had no resemblance to the traditional 2- or 3-species classification. Overall, these toad populations harbor a large amount of genetic diversity and have very high population differentiation, but taken together the evidence suggests that all populations belong to a single species. Our results are consistent with most previous molecular studies, and we recommend using Bufo gargarizans to represent all Asiatic toad populations from western China without subspecies division.\n\nToxic effects of NH4+-N on embryonic development of Bufo gargarizans and Rana chensinensis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDeng, Hongzhang; Chai, Lihong; Luo, Pingping; Zhou, Meimei; Nover, Daniel; Zhao, Xiaohong\n\n2017-09-01\n\nAlthough nitrogen fertilizer is commonly used worldwide, little information is currently available about NH 4 + -N toxicity on amphibians. This study determined the acute and chronic toxic effects of NH 4 + -N on two native Chinese amphibian species (Bufo gargarizans and Rana chensinensis), and compared the negative sensitivity of different embryos to NH 4 + -N. Static renewal aqueous exposures were performed using B.Â gargarizans and R.Â chensinensis embryos at Gosner stage 2 over 96Â h. In terms of 96 h-LC 50 , B.Â gargarizans and R.Â chensinensis embryos had significantly different responses to NH 4 + -N, and the latter was more sensitive to NH 4 + -N than the former. In the chronic toxicity test, exposure to 10Â mgÂ L -1 NH 4 + -N or higher significantly decreased the hatching rate of embryos in both species. Significant increases in the abnormality rate of embryos at 50Â mgÂ L -1 NH 4 + -N or higher were observed and morphological abnormalities were characterized by axial flexures, yolk sac edema, and hyperplasia in both species. Additionally, the total length of embryos decreased in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to NH 4 + -N. The results indicate that NH 4 + -N exposure can increase abnormality and inhibit the hatching and development of embryos in B.Â gargarizans and R.Â chensinensis. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the effects of chronic copper exposure on mortality, growth, time to metamorphosis, tail resorption time, body size at the metamorphic climax (Gs 42) and completion of metamorphosis (Gs 46) and thyroid gland histology. In addition, type 2 and 3 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2 and Dio3), thyroid hormone receptors (TRÎ± and TRÎ²) mRNA levels were also measured to assess disruption of TH synthesis. Our result showed that 6.4-64Î¼gL(-1) copper concentration increased the mortality and inhibited the growth of B. gargarizans tadpoles. In addition, significant reduction in size at Gs 42 and a time delay to Gs 42 were observed at 6.4-64Î¼gL(-1) copper treatments. Moreover, histological examinations have clearly revealed that 64Î¼gL(-1) copper caused follicular cell hyperplasia in thyroid gland. According to real-time PCR results, exposure to 32 and 64Î¼gL(-1) copper significantly up-regulated mRNA expression of Dio3, but down-regulated mRNA expression of TRÎ± and TRÎ² mRNA level. We concluded that copper delayed amphibian metamorphosis through changing mRNA expression of Dio3, TRÎ± and TRÎ², which suggests that copper might have the endocrine-disrupting effect.

These three species are common around Nanchong City, in southwestern China, where they live in the same habitat before hibernation. The main objective of this study was to analyze the diets and patterns of coexistence relative to the microhabitat of each species. In the Asiatic toad, based on index of relative importance, the diet was dominated by adult Coleoptera, Isopoda, and Hymenoptera (29.53%, 22.07%, and 15.20%, respectively, while the Guenther's frog and Ricefield frog ingested predominantly Orthoptera (67.44% and 40.94%, respectively. The standardized feeding niche breadth of the Asiatic toad (0.277 was wider than that of the Guentheri frog (0.177 and Ricefield frog (0.269. The overlap in the trophic niche (prey proportion between the toad and two species of frog was low (toad vs. Guentheri frog, C H = 0.526; toad vs. Ricefield frog, C H = 0.521, while this was high for the two species of frogs (C H = 0.942. The three species also differed in microhabitat use. Asiatic toads showed strong preference for small roads close to shrubs or pre-harvest corn, while Guenther's frogs preferred bare surfaces on habitat edges, and Ricefield frogs showed a preference for bare surfaces as feeding sites in the middle of habitat. The difference in diet observed during three species seems to be explained by the difference in microhabitat use and body size of three species.\n\nEffects of nitrate on metamorphosis, thyroid and iodothyronine deiodinases expression in Bufo gargarizans larvae.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWang, Ming; Chai, Lihong; Zhao, Hongfeng; Wu, Minyao; Wang, Hongyuan\n\n2015-11-01\n\nChinese toad (Bufo gargarizans) tadpoles were exposed to nitrate (10, 50 and 100mg/L NO3-N) from the beginning of the larval period through metamorphic climax. We examined the effects of chronic nitrate exposure on metamorphosis, mortality, body size and thyroid gland. In addition, thyroid hormone (TH) levels, type II iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2) and type III iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio3) mRNA levels were also measured to assess disruption of TH synthesis. Results showed that significant metamorphic delay and mortality increased were caused in larvae exposed to 100mg/L NO3-N. The larvae exposed to 100mg/L NO3-N clearly exhibited a greater reduction in thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) levels. Moreover, treatment with NO3-N induced down-regulation of Dio2 mRNA levels and up-regulation of Dio3 mRNA levels, reflecting the disruption of thyroid endocrine. It seems that increased mass and body size may be correlated with prolonged metamorphosis. Interestingly, we observed an exception that exposure to 100mg/L NO3-N did not exhibit remarkable alterations of thyroid gland size. Compared with control groups, 100mg/L NO3-N caused partial colloid depletion in the thyroid gland follicles. These results suggest that nitrate can act as a chemical stressor inducing retardation in development and metamorphosis. Therefore, we concluded that the presence of high concentrations nitrate can influence the growth, decline the survival, impair TH synthesis and induce metamorphosis retardation of B. gargarizans larvae.

In contrast, very few studies have addressed the consequences of such environmental and topographical changes in North East Asian species. More precisely, the Korean Peninsula offers a unique model to assess patterns and processes of speciation as it hosts the northern- and eastern-most distribution limit of some widespread Asian taxa. Despite this, studies addressing phylogeographic patterns and population genetics in the peninsula and surrounding countries are few and studies for most families are lacking. Here we inferred the phylogenetic relationships of the common toad (Bufo gargarizans from South Korea and their North East Asian counterpart populations, based on mitochondrial data. Korean B. gargarizans GenBank BLASTs matched few individuals from nearby China, but the presence of a Korean clade suggests isolation on the Korean Peninsula, previous to the last glacial maximum, linked to sea level resurgence. Molecular clock calibrations within this group were used to date the divergence between clades and their relationship to paleo-climatic events in the area. Lack of genetic structure among South Korean populations and strong homogeneity between the Korean and some Chinese localities suggest weak isolation and recent expansion. Geographical projection of continuous coalescent maximum-clade-credibility trees shows an original Chinese expansion towards the Korean Peninsula through the Yellow Sea circa two million years ago with colonisation events dating circa 800 thousand years ago (K. y. a.. Following this colonisation, the data point to outgoing Korean Peninsula dispersal events throughout different periods, towards the North through land, and West through land bridge formations over the Yellow Sea during sea level falls. In accordance, demographic analyses revealed a population expansion in the Koran Peninsula circa 300 K. y. a\n\nA new phylogeographic pattern of endemic Bufo bankorensis in Taiwan Island is attributed to the genetic variation of populations.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTeng-Lang Yu\n\nFull Text Available To comprehend the phylogeographic patterns of genetic variation in anurans at Taiwan Island, this study attempted to examine (1 the existence of various geological barriers (Central Mountain Ranges, CMRs; and (2 the genetic variation of Bufo bankorensis using mtDNA sequences among populations located in different regions of Taiwan, characterized by different climates and existing under extreme conditions when compared available sequences of related species B. gargarizans of mainland China.Phylogenetic analyses of the dataset with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA D-loop gene (348 bp recovered a close relationship between B. bankorensis and B. gargarizans, identified three distinct lineages. Furthermore, the network of mtDNA D-loop gene (564 bp amplified (279 individuals, 27 localities from Taiwan Island indicated three divergent clades within B. bankorensis (Clade W, E and S, corresponding to the geography, thereby verifying the importance of the CMRs and Kaoping River drainage as major biogeographic barriers. Mismatch distribution analysis, neutrality tests and Bayesian skyline plots revealed that a significant population expansion occurred for the total population and Clade W, with horizons dated to approximately 0.08 and 0.07 Mya, respectively. These results suggest that the population expansion of Taiwan Island species B. bankorensis might have resulted from the release of available habitat in post-glacial periods, the genetic variation on mtDNA showing habitat selection, subsequent population dispersal, and co-distribution among clades.The multiple origins (different clades of B. bankorensis mtDNA sequences were first evident in this study. The divergent genetic clades found within B. bankorensis could be independent colonization by previously diverged lineages; inferring B. bankorensis originated from B. gargarizans of mainland China, then dispersal followed by isolation within Taiwan Island. Highly divergent clades between W and E of B\n\nCantor's Problem\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nSauerbier, Charles\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIn 1891 a paper by Georg Cantor was published in which he addressed the relative cardinality of two sets, the set of integers and the set of real numbers, in effort to demonstrate that the two sets were of unequal cardinality.

It is shown that Maxwellâs equations on Cantor sets in a fractal bounded domain give efficiency and accuracy for describing the fractal electric and magnetic fields. Local fractional differential forms of Maxwellâs equations on Cantor sets in the Cantorian and Cantor-type cylindrical coordinates are obtained. Maxwell's equations on Cantor set with local fractional operators are the first step towards a unified theory of Maxwellâs equations for the dynamics of cold dark matter.\n\nGeorg Cantor i idea jednoÅci nauki\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJerzy DadaczyÅski\n\n2009-06-01\n\nFull Text Available G.

Amphibians are generally poorly adapted to survive in saline environments. We experimentally investigated the effects of chronic exposure to various salinities (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% and 35% seawater, SW) on survival, larval growth and metamorphosis of tadpoles from two amphibian populations belonging to two species: the green toad Bufo balearicus and the common toad Bufo bufo. In addition, gill morphology of tadpoles of both species after acute exposure to hypertonic conditions (20%, 25%, and 30% SW) was examined by light and electron microscopy. Tadpoles experienced 100% mortality above 20% SW in B. balearicus while above 15% SW in B. bufo. We detected also sublethal effects of salinity stress on growth and metamorphosis. B. bufo cannot withstand chronic exposure to salinity above 5% SW, tadpoles grew slower and were significantly smaller than those in control at metamorphosis. B. balearicus tolerated salinity up to 20% SW without apparent effects during larval development, but starting from 15% SW tadpoles metamorphosed later and at a smaller size compared with control. We also revealed a negative relation between increasing salt concentration and gill integrity. The main modifications were increased mucous secretion, detachment of external layer, alteration of epithelial surface, degeneration phenomena, appearance of residual bodies, and macrophage immigration. These morphological alterations of gill epithelium can interfere with respiratory function and both osmotic and acid-base regulation. Significant variations in branchial Na + /K + -ATPase activity were also observed between two species; moreover an increase in enzyme activity was evident in response to SW exposure.

This study aimed to document the vocal demands, vocal training, reported incidence of voice problems, and treatment-seeking behavior of Reform Jewish cantors. The study used a prospective observational design to anonymously query Reform Jewish cantors using a 35-item multiple-choice survey distributed online. Demographic information, medical history, vocal music training, cantorial duties, history of voice problems, and treatment-seeking behavior were addressed. Results indicated that many of the commonly associated risk factors for developing voice disorders were present in this population, including high vocal demands, reduced vocal downtime, allergies, and acid reflux. Greater than 65% of the respondents reported having had a voice problem that interfered with their ability to perform their duties at some time during their careers. Reform Jewish cantors are a population of occupational voice users who may be currently unidentified and underserved by vocal health professionals. The results of the survey suggest that Reform Jewish cantors are occupational voice users and are at high risk for developing voice disorders. Copyright Â© 2012 The Voice Foundation.

Herein I argue, pace JanÃ© (1995, that due to the importance of Christianity to Cantor, he would have never thought of absolutely infinite collections/inconsistent multiplicities, as being merely potential, or as being purely mathematical entities. I begin by considering and rejecting two arguments due to Ignacio JanÃ© based on letters to Hilbert and the generating principles for ordinals, respectively, showing that my reading of Cantor is consistent with that evidence. I then argue that evidence from Cantorâs later writings shows that he was still very religious later in his career, and thus would not have given up on the reality of the absolute, as that would imply an imperfection on the part of God.\n\n[Comparison of chemical composition between fresh and processed Bufonis Venenum by UPLC-TQ-MS].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWang, Zi-yue; Wang, Hong-lan; Zhou, Jing; Ma, Hong-yue; Gong, Yan; Yan, Wen-li; Qian, Da-wei\n\n2015-10-01\n\nToad venom is the Bufo bufo gargarizans or B. melanostictus after the ears of the gland secretion, used in the treatment of various cancers in recent years. Research shows that the main anti-tumor components in bufadienolide. Bufadienolide have free type structure and conjunct type structure. To identify and clarify the difference between bufogenin and bufotoxin contained in Bufonis Venenum, which was from B. bufo gargarizans, an UPLC-TQ-MS method has been established. UPLC-TQ-MS method was used to identify and quantify the major bufadienolides in Bufonis Venenum. UPLC-TQ-MS assay with positive ion mode was performed on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C, (2.1 mm x 100 mm, 1.7 Âµm) with the mobile phase consisting of 0. 1% aqueous formic and acidacetonitrile in gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.4 mL Â· minâ»Â¹ and the column temperature was set at 35 Â°C. By comparing their retention time and high resolution mass data of Bufonis Venenum extracts, 37 effective components were primarily identified by MS/MS analysis in positive ion mode. Twenty-six of them were free-type bufadienolides (bufogenin), 11 of them were conjugated bufadienolides. There were significant differences in the main composition between fresh and processed Bufonis Venenum. The study found that the chemical composition of toad venom through great changes after processing, conjunct type content is much less, free type content as well change.\n\nThe philosophy of set theory an historical introduction to Cantor's paradise\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nTiles, Mary\n\n2004-01-01\n\nA century ago, Georg Cantor demonstrated the possibility of a series of transfinite infinite numbers. His methods, unorthodox for the time, enabled him to derive theorems that established a mathematical reality for a hierarchy of infinities. Cantor's innovation was opposed, and ignored, by the establishment; years later, the value of his work was recognized and appreciated as a landmark in mathematical thought, forming the beginning of set theory and the foundation for most of contemporary mathematics. As Cantor's sometime collaborator, David Hilbert, remarked, \"\"No one will drive us from the\n\nExtending Cantor Paradox\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nLeon, Antonio\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe inconsistencies involved in the foundation of set theory were invariably caused by infinity and self-reference; and only with the opportune axiomatic restrictions could them be obviated. Throughout history, both concepts have proved to be an exhaustible source of paradoxes and contradictions. It seems therefore legitimate to pose some questions concerning their formal consistency. This is just the objective of this paper. Starting from an extension of Cantor's paradox that suggests the in...\n\nIntersection of triadic Cantor sets with their translates. II. Hausdorff measure spectrum function and its introduction for the classification of Cantor sets\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLi Jun; Nekka, Fahima E-mail: fahima.nekka@umontreal.ca\n\n2004-01-01\n\nInitiated by the purpose of classification of sets having the same fractal dimension, we continue, in this second paper of a series of two, our investigation of intersection of triadic Cantor sets and their use in the classification of fractal sets. We exploit the infinite tree structure of translation elements to give the exact expressions of these elements. We generalize this result to a family of uniform Cantor sets for which we also give the Hausdorff measure spectrum function (HMSF). We develop three algorithms for the construction of HMSF of triadic Cantor sets. Then, we introduce a new method based on HMSF as a way for tracing the geometrical organization of a fractal set. The HMSF does carry a huge amount of information about the set to likely be explored in a chosen way. To extract this information, we develop a one by one step method and apply it to typical fractal sets. This results in a complete identification of fractals.0.\n\nAnomalÃ­as oculares en hÃ­bridos Bufo paranecmis â x Bufo arenarum â (Anura: Bufonidae\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRengel, Dora\n\n1994-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Los hÃ­bridos entre Bufo paracnemis x Bufo arenarum se encuadran en los llamados \"hÃ­bridos vitales\".

Golmankhaneh, Alireza; Balankin, Alexander S.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThere is no way to build a nontrivial Markov process having continuous trajectories on a totally disconnected fractal embedded in the Euclidean space. Accordingly, in order to delineate the diffusion process on the totally disconnected fractal, one needs to relax the continuum requirement. Consequently, a diffusion process depends on how the continuum requirement is handled. This explains the emergence of different types of anomalous diffusion on the same totally disconnected set. In this regard, we argue that the number of effective spatial degrees of freedom of a random walker on the totally disconnected Cantor set is equal to nsp = [ D ] + 1, where [ D ] is the integer part of the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set. Conversely, the number of effective dynamical degrees of freedom (ds) depends on the definition of a Markov process on the totally disconnected Cantor set embedded in the Euclidean space En (n â¥nsp). This allows us to deduce the equation of diffusion by employing the local differential operators on the FÎ±-support. The exact solutions of this equation are obtained on the middle-É Cantor sets for different kinds of the Markovian random processes. The relation of our findings to physical phenomena observed in complex systems is highlighted.\n\nExperimental population dynamics of Rhabdias bufonis (Nematoda) in toads (Bufo bufo): density-dependence in the primary infection\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nGoater, C.

First, it is hypothesized that the origin and development of the Central Asian Deserts generated a biogeographic barrier that fragmented past continuous distributions in Eastern and Western domains. Second, Pleistocene glaciations have been proposed as the main process driving the regional diversification within each of these domains. The European common toad and its closest relatives provide an interesting opportunity to examine the relative contributions of these paleogeographic and paleoclimatic events to the phylogeny and biogeography of a widespread Eurasiatic group. We investigate this issue by applying a multiproxy approach combining information from molecular phylogenies, a multiple correspondence analysis of allozyme data and species distribution models. Our study includes 304 specimens from 164 populations, covering most of the distributional range of the Bufo bufo species complex in the Western Palearctic. The phylogenies (ML and Bayesian analyses) were based on a total of 1988 bp of mitochondrial DNA encompassing three genes (tRNAval, 16S and ND1). A dataset with 173 species of the family Bufonidae was assembled to estimate the separation of the two pan-Eurasiatic species complexes of Bufo and to date the main biogeographic events within the Bufo bufo species complex. The allozyme study included sixteen protein systems, corresponding to 21 presumptive loci. Finally, the distribution models were based on maximum entropy. Our distribution models show that Eastern and Western species complexes are greatly isolated by the Central Asian Deserts, and our dating estimates place this divergence during the Middle Miocene, a moment in which different sources of evidence document a major upturn of the aridification rate of Central Asia. This climate-driven process likely separated the Eastern and Western species.

We characterized the MHC class I of two Korean amphibians, the Asiatic toad (Bufo gargarizans) and the Japanese tree frog (Hyla japonica). We found at least four transcribed MHC class I (MHC I) loci, the highest number confirmed in any anuran to date. Furthermore, we identified MHC I transcripts in terrestrial adults, and possibly in aquatic larvae, of both species. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on MHC I sequence data and found that B.Â gargarizans and H.Â japonica cluster together in the superfamily Nobleobatrachia. We further identified three supertypes shared by the two species. Our results reveal substantial variation in the number of MHC I loci in anurans and suggest that certain supertypes have particular physiochemical properties that may confer pathogen resistance.

Secondly, we show that this set has finite Cantor-Bendixson rank and give a tight bound. Finally, we present a family of surfaces realizing all possible Cantor-Bendixson ranks. The techniques in the proof of this result exclusively concern Abelian differentials on Riemann surfaces, also known as translation surfaces. The concept of a \"slit translation surface\" is introduced as the primary tool for studying meromorphic quadratic differentials with higher order poles.\n\nComparative cytogenetic studies of Bufo ictericus, B. paracnemis (Amphibia, Anura and an intermediate form in sympatry\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAzevedo MFC\n\n2003-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Specimens of Bufo ictericus, Bufo paracnemis and a third type, considered an intermediate subgroup between these species, were cytogenetically studied by conventional Giemsa staining, C-banding and staining of the nucleolus organizer region (NOR. The nuclear DNA content and seroproteins were also analyzed to characterize these species, and verify the possibility of hybridization between them. Karyotypes and cytogenetic markers were essentially equal on the basis of the methods used. The DNA nuclear content found was 6.25 Â± 0.30 pg/DNA in Bufo ictericus; 7.57 Â± 0.40 pg/DNA in Bufo paracnemis and 7.04 Â± 0.29 pg/DNA in the intermediate subgroup. Eletrophoresis of total blood serum in Bufo ictericus, Bufo paracnemis and the intermediate specimens revealed a remarkable difference in the patterns of the protein bands whose molecular weight corresponded to that of albumin. While the parental species presented two different bands, the intermediate form presented 4. However, only three of these bands were seen in each specimen. The results obtained pointed to a high probability for natural hybridization between Bufo ictericus and Bufo paracnemis in the site and specimens studied.\n\nApplication of Local Fractional Series Expansion Method to Solve Klein-Gordon Equations on Cantor Sets\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAi-Min Yang\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available We use the local fractional series expansion method to solve the Klein-Gordon equations on Cantor sets within the local fractional derivatives.

It presents some 40 papers, published between the 1870s and the 1970s, on proofs of the Cantor-Bernstein theorem and the related Bernstein division theorem. While the emphasis is placed on providing accurate proofs, similar to the originals, the discussion is broadened to include aspects that pertain to the methodology of the development of mathematics and to the philosophy of mathematics. Works of prominent mathematicians and logicians are reviewed, including Cantor, Dedekind, SchrÃ¶der, Bernstein, Borel, Zermelo, PoincarÃ©, Russell, Peano, the KÃ¶nigs, Hausdorff, Sierpinski, Tarski, Banach, Brouwer and several others mainly of the Polish and the Dutch schools.

Applying the formalism to the problem of a Fourier transform on fractals we show that the resulting transform has all the required basic properties. As an example we discuss a sawtooth signal on the ternary middle-third Cantor set.

Although executed in a simple colour palette, very pure cinnabar was used as the major colourant, offsetting the carbon black of the verses and script. A dark blue colour was achieved using a mixture of azurite (basic copper carbonate) and carbon, whereas a light blue colour was azurite alone. A grey colour was achieved using azurite, carbon particles and a calcareous 'limewash'. A yellow pigment, used sparely in the cantorals was ascribed to saffron; unusually, there was no evidence for the presence of the yellow mineral pigments orpiment, realgar and massicot. In several regions of the vellum specimens, evidence for biodeterioration was observed through the signatures of hydrated calcium oxalate. We report for the first time the Raman spectra of pigment in situ on a vellum fragment, which also shows evidence of substrate bands; comparison of black and red pigmented regions of vellum specimens has shown the presence of calcium oxalate in the black pigmented script but not in the red pigment regions, which suggests that the cinnabar in the red-pigmented regions acts as a toxic protectant for the vellum substrate against biological colonisation processes.\n\nSelf-similarity of the union of 3-part Cantor set with its two translations\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDai Meifeng [Nonlinear Scientific Research Center, Faculty of Science, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang 212013 (China)], E-mail: daimf@ujs.edu.cn; Tian Lixin [Nonlinear Scientific Research Center, Faculty of Science, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang 212013 (China)], E-mail: tianlx@ujs.edu.cn\n\n2008-07-15\n\nFor 3-part Cantor set, we first discuss the relationship between iterated function systems and the union of the set with its two translations.

Considering the huge number of devices, recharging batteries or replacing them becomes impractical in real life. Therefore, harvesting ambient RF energy for powering IoT devices can be a practical solution to achieve self-charging operation. The antenna for the RF energy harvesting application must work on multiple frequency bands (multiband or wideband) to capture as much power as possible from ambient; it should be compact and small in size so that it can be integrated with IoT devices; and it should be low cost, considering the huge number of devices. This thesis presents a fully printed 3D cube Cantor fractal RF energy harvesting unit, which meets the above-mentioned criteria. The multiband Cantor fractal antenna has been designed and implemented on a package of rectifying circuits using additive manufacturing (combination of 3D inkjet printing of plastic substrate and 2D metallic screen printing of silver paste) for the first time for RF energy harvesting application. The antenna, which is in a Cantor fractal shape, is folded on five faces of a 3D cube where the bottom face accommodates rectifying circuit with matching network. The rectenna (rectifying antenna) harvests RF power from GSM900, GSM1800, and 3G at 2100 MHz frequency. Indoor and outdoor field tests of the RF energy harvester have been conducted in the IMPACT lab and the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) campus territory, and 252.4 mV of maximum output voltage is harvested.\n\nIs Huachansu Beneficial in Treating Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer? Evidence from a Meta-Analysis of Its Efficacy Combined with Chemotherapy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBingduo Zhou\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Background. Huachansu, the sterilized water extract of Bufo bufo gargarizans toad skin, is used in China to alleviate the side-effects and enhance the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess Huachansuâs efficacy. Methods. We extensively searched electronic databases (CENTRAL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CBM, Cochrane Library, CNKI, CEBM, WFDP, CSCD, CSTD, and IPA for randomized controlled trials containing Huachansu plus chemotherapy as the test group and chemotherapy as the control group. Seventeen trials were selected based on the selection criteria. The pooled relative ratio (RR of indicators with 95% confidence interval (95% CI was calculated for efficacy evaluation. Results. The meta-analysis demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in objective tumor response, one-year survival, Karnofsky performance status, pain relief, and alleviation of severe side-effects (nausea and vomiting, leukocytopenia in the test group as compared to the control group, but no significant difference in thrombocytopenia. Conclusions. This study demonstrated the efficacy of Huachansu combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. However, limitations exist and high-quality trials are needed for further verification.\n\nLaplace transform series expansion method for solving the local fractional heat-transfer equation defined on Cantor sets\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSun Huan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In this paper, we use the Laplace transform series expansion method to find the analytical solution for the local fractional heat-transfer equation defined on Cantor sets via local fractional calculus.\n\nThallium in spawn, juveniles, and adult common toads (Bufo bufo) living in the vicinity of a zinc-mining complex, Poland.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDmowski, Krzysztof; Rossa, Monika; Kowalska, Joanna; KrasnodÄbska-OstrÄga, Beata\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA breeding population of the common toad Bufo bufo living in the vicinity of a Zn-Pb smelting works in Bukowno, Poland was studied for the presence of thallium. Tl concentration was measured in the bottom sediments of the spawning pond, in the laid eggs, in juveniles after metamorphosis, and in the selected tissues of the adult individuals. A very high concentration of Tl was detected in the spawn (13.97âÂ±â8.90 mg/kg d.w.). In 50% of the spawn samples, levels exceeded 20 mgTl/kg d.w. The issue of maternal transfer of thallium from females to oocytes is discussed. Due to a significant accumulation of thallium, spawn analysis can be used as a sensitive indicator of the presence of this element in the environment and may replace more invasive methods that involve the killing of adult animals. In those regions that are abundant in Zn-Pb ores, the spawn of amphibians may be a very important source of thallium contamination for predators. From among all tissues of the Bukowno adult toads, the livers have shown the highest accumulation of thallium (mean 3.98 mg/kg d.w. and maximum value--18.63). For as many as 96.5% of livers, concentrations exceeded 1.0 mgTl/kg d.w. which is treated as indicative of poisoning.\n\nAnÃ¡lise perceptivo-auditiva de parÃ¢metros vocais em cantores da noite do estilo musical brega da cidade do Recife\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nSilva,Elthon Gomes Fernandes da; Luna,Carmem LÃºcia Cerqueira de\n\n2009-01-01\n\nOBJETIVO: avaliar de forma perceptivo-auditiva a voz dos cantores da noite do estilo musical Brega da cidade do Recife.

Two populations of toads, maintained under different light conditions, were monitored to observe the effects of photoperiod on the seasonal rhythm of plasma corticosterone. Under a natural photoperiod toads demonstrated a rhythm consisting of a spring peak and a fall peak in corticosterone concentration. Toads maintained under a 12L:12D photoperiod all year round demonstrated a similar rhythm with peaks in the spring and fall. This suggests that an endogenous (circannual) rhythm of corticosterone may be playing an important role in the seasonal change of overt behavior and physiology of Bufo americanus. A daily rhythm of corticosterone was also detected in toads when blood samples were taken every 4 hr. When compared to a previously published circadian rhythm study of locomotor activity, the surge in corticosterone concentration for the day occurred at 1730 just prior to the peak in locomotor activity\n\nPropagation of Dirac electrons in Cantor graphene multilayers\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRodrÃ­guez-GonzÃ¡lez, R.; MartÃ­nez-Orozco, J.

Six trypanosome species were found, 2 of which were not identified because of poor material. Trypanosoma rotatorium (sensu Mayer, 1843) was found in Rana limnocharis and Rana nigromaculata. Trypanosoma chattoni and a T. rotatorium-like species were found in Bufo gargarizans. A sphaeromastigote similar to Trypanosoma tsunezomiyatai was seen in R. limnocharis. The relationship of this parasite to T. chattoni is unclear. Dactylosoma ranarum, Lankesterella minima, and Aegyptianella bacterifera were identified in ranids. Frog erythrocytic virus (FEV) was found in 2 ranids and a bufonid. Differences in shape of FEV and its assumed effect on the host-cell nucleus suggest that different kinds of viruses may be involved.\n\nAnÃ¡lise de cantores de baile em estilo de canto popular e lÃ­rico:perceptivo-auditiva, acÃºstica e da configuraÃ§Ã£o larÃ­ngea\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZampieri Sueli A.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Objetivo: deste estudo foi verificar os ajustes larÃ­ngeos realizados por cantores profissionais do gÃªnero popular durante a imitaÃ§Ã£o do canto em estilo lÃ­rico uma vez que muitas vezes ao ouvirmos um cantor popular interpretar uma mÃºsica clÃ¡ssica percebemos que o mesmo faz modificaÃ§Ãµes em sua qualidade vocal, tentando se aproximar, por imitaÃ§Ã£o, do canto lÃ­rico. Forma de estudo: ClÃ­nico prospectivo. Material e mÃ©todo: Foram analisados 26 cantores profissionais do gÃªnero popular, 10 homens e 16 mulheres, atuantes em baile. Foi aplicado questionÃ¡rio sobre perfil vocal, realizada anÃ¡lise perceptivo-auditiva e acÃºstica das vozes e avaliaÃ§Ã£o nasofibrolaringoscÃ³pica para anÃ¡lise da configuraÃ§Ã£o larÃ­ngea nos estilos de canto popular e lÃ­rico. Resultado: A anÃ¡lise perceptivo-auditiva revelou que, ao cantar um trecho de mÃºsica em estilo lÃ­rico, o cantor popular muda a qualidade vocal, aumentando o vibrato, o volume vocal, melhorando a ressonÃ¢ncia vocal e sobrearticulando mais as palavras. Na anÃ¡lise espectrogrÃ¡fica nÃ£o foi observada a ocorrÃªncia do formante do cantor em nenhuma das vozes. O ajuste larÃ­ngeo realizado por cantores populares ao imitarem o estilo de canto lÃ­rico foi predominantemente o aumento das constriÃ§Ãµes Ã¢ntero-posterior e mediana sendo que a constriÃ§Ã£o mediana ocorreu mais no sexo masculino.

The basis of this study is data gathered over two decades of amphibian fencing alongside roads in the Austrian state of Salzburg. Different statistical approaches were used to analyse the data. Overall average increase or decrease of each species was estimated by calculating a simple average locality index. In addition the statistical software TRIM was used to verify these trends as well as to categorize the data based on the geographic location of each migration site. The results show differing overall trends for the two species: the common toad being stable and the common frog showing a substantial decline over the last two decades. Further analyses based on geographic categorization reveal the strongest decrease in the alpine range of the species. Drainage and agricultural intensification are still ongoing problems within alpine areas, not only in Salzburg. Particularly in respect to micro-climate and the availability of spawning places these changes appear to have a greater impact on the habitats of the common frog than the common toad. Therefore we consider habitat destruction to be the main potential reason behind this dramatic decline. We also conclude that the substantial loss of biomass of a widespread species such as the common frog must have a severe, and often overlooked, ecological impact.\n\nNew Approaches for Solving Fokker Planck Equation on Cantor Sets within Local Fractional Operators\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHassan Kamil Jassim\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available We discuss new approaches to handling Fokker Planck equation on Cantor sets within local fractional operators by using the local fractional Laplace decomposition and Laplace variational iteration methods based on the local fractional calculus.

Merogony and oogony occur in the capillary endothelium and the macrophages in the liver, spleen and kidneys. Meronts are oval, 25,2â29,4 x 15,7â16,8 Î¼m in size and yield 35â46 merozoites. Oocysts are 26,3â29,4 x 15,1â17,6 Î¼m in size; sporozoites 9,2-9,8 x 4,2â5,0 Î¼m in size, assemble in macrophages. Released 8,7â9,8 x 2,8â3,1 Î¼m sporozoites enter erythrocytes. L. poeppigii is compared with Lankesterella petiti Lainson & Paperna, 1995 infecting Bufo marinus (Linnaeus, 1758 in Brazil. The above mentioned specific characters, added to differences in hosts and geographical location warrant the description of Lankesterella poeppigii from B. poeppigii as a new species.\n\nIdentifying elementary iterated systems through algorithmic inference: The Cantor set example\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nApolloni, Bruno [Dipartimento di Scienze dell' Informazione, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Via Comelico 39/41, 20135 Milan (Italy)].

E-mail: bassis@dsi.unimi.it\n\n2006-10-15\n\nWe come back to the old problem of fractal identification within the new framework of algorithmic Inference. The key points are: (i) to identify sufficient statistics to be put in connection with the unknown values of the fractal parameters, and (ii) to manage the timing of the iterated process through spatial statistics. We fill these tasks successfully with the Cantor sets. We are able to compute confidence intervals for both the scaling parameter {theta} and the iteration number n at which we are observing a set. We both check numerically the coverage of these intervals and delineate a general strategy for affording more complex iterated systems.\n\nComparaÃ§Ã£o de hÃ¡bitos de bem estar vocal entre cantores lÃ­ricos e populares A comparison between vocal habits of lyric and popular singers\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAna Paula Dassie-Leite\n\n2011-02-01\n\nFull Text Available OBJETIVO: comparar hÃ¡bitos de bem estar vocal entre cantores lÃ­ricos e populares.

A specialized region in the pelvic skin of semiterrestrial species, termed the seat patch, contains aquaporins (AQPs) that become inserted into the apical plasma membrane of the epidermis following stimulation by arginine vasotocin (AVT) to facilitate rehydration. Two AVT-stimulated AQPs, AQP-h2 and AQP-h3, have been identified in the epidermis of seat patch skin of the Japanese tree frog, Hyla japonica, and show a high degree of homology with those of bufonid species. We used antibodies raised against AQP-h2 and AQP-h3 to characterize the expression of homologous AQPs in the skin of two species of toads that inhabit arid desert regions of southwestern North America. Western blot analysis of proteins gave positive results for AQP-h2-like proteins in the pelvic skin and also the urinary bladder of Anaxyrus (Bufo) punctatus while AQP-h3-like proteins were found in extracts from the pelvic skin and the more anterior ventral skin, but not the urinary bladder. Immunohistochemical observations showed both AQP-h2- and AQP-h3-like proteins were present in the apical membrane of skin from the pelvic skin of hydrated and dehydrated A. punctatus. Further stimulation by AVT or isoproterenol treatment of living toads was not evident. In contrast, skin from hydrated Incilius (Bufo) alvarius showed very weak labeling of AQP-h2- and AQP-h3-like proteins and labeling turned intense following stimulation by AVT. These results are similar to those of tree frogs and toads that occupy mesic habitats and suggest this pattern of AQP expression is the result of phylogenetic factors shared by hylid and bufonid anurans.\n\nOf overlapping Cantor sets and earthquakes: analysis of the discrete Chakrabarti-Stinchcombe model\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBhattacharyya, Pratip\n\n2005-03-01\n\nWe report an exact analysis of a discrete form of the Chakrabarti-Stinchcombe model for earthquakes (Physica A 270 (1999) 27), which considers a pair of dynamically overlapping finite generations of the Cantor set as a prototype of geological faults. In this model the nth generation of the Cantor set shifts on its replica in discrete steps of the length of a line segment in that generation and periodic boundary conditions are assumed. We determine the general form of time sequences for the constant magnitude overlaps and, hence, obtain the complete time-series of overlaps by the superposition of these sequences for all overlap magnitudes. From the time-series we derive the exact frequency distribution of the overlap magnitudes. The corresponding probability distribution of the logarithm of overlap magnitudes for the nth generation is found to assume the form of the binomial distribution for n Bernoulli trials with probability {1}/{3} for the success of each trial. For an arbitrary pair of consecutive overlaps in the time-series where the magnitude of the earlier overlap is known, we find that the magnitude of the later overlap can be determined with a definite probability; the conditional probability for each possible magnitude of the later overlap follows the binomial distribution for k Bernoulli trials with probability {1}/{2} for the success of each trial and the number k is determined by the magnitude of the earlier overlap. Although this model does not produce the Gutenberg-Richter law for earthquakes, our results indicate that the fractal structure of faults admits a probabilistic prediction of earthquake magnitudes.\n\nMicrosatellite analysis of the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) in Denmark: populations are islands in a fragmented landscape\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nAllentoft, Morten Erik; Siegismund, Hans Redlef; Briggs, Lars\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe European natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) has declined rapidly in recent years, primarily due to loss of habitat, and in Denmark it is estimated that 50% of the isolated populations are lost each decade. To efficiently manage and conserve this species and its genetic diversity, knowledge...... of isolation by distance within major regions supported this apparent lack of a gene flow continuum. Indications of a genetic bottleneck were found in three populations. The analyses suggest that the remaining Bufo calamita populations in Denmark are genetically isolated, and represent independent units...... in a highly fragmented gene pool. Future conservation management of this species is discussed in light of these results....\n\nDeriving freshwater quality criteria for 2,4-dichlorophenol for protection of aquatic life in China\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYin Daqiang; Jin Hongjun; Yu Lingwei; Hu Shuangqing\n\n2003-01-01\n\nCriteria were established for an organic pollutant in freshwaters of China. - Freshwater quality criteria for 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) were developed with particular reference to the aquatic biota in China, and based on USEPA's guidelines. Acute toxicity tests were performed on nine different domestic species indigenous to China to determine 48-h LC 50 and 96-h LC 50 values for 2,4-DCP. In addition, 21 day survival-reproduction tests with Daphnia magna, 30-day embryo-larval tests with Carassius auratus, 60 day fry-juvenile test with Ctenopharyngodon idellus, 30 d early life stage tests with Bufo bufo gargarizans and 96 h growth inhibition tests with Scenedesms obliqaus were conducted, to estimate lower chronic limit (LCL) and upper chronic limit (UCL) values. The final acute value (FAV) was 2.49 mg/l 2,4-DCP. Acute-to-chronic ratios (ACR) ranged from 3.74 to 22.5. The final chronic value (FCV) and the final plant value (FPV) of 2.4-DCP were 0.212 mg/l and 7.07 mg/l respectively. Based on FAV, FCV, and FPV, a criteria maximum concentration (CMC) of 1.25 mg/l and a criterion continuous concentration (CCC) of 0.212 mg/l were derived. The results of this study provide useful data for deriving national or local water quality criteria for 2,4-DCP based on aquatic biota in China\n\nSignal Processing for Nondifferentiable Data Defined on Cantor Sets: A Local Fractional Fourier Series Approach\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZhi-Yong Chen\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available From the signal processing point of view, the nondifferentiable data defined on the Cantor sets are investigated in this paper. The local fractional Fourier series is used to process the signals, which are the local fractional continuous functions. Our results can be observed as significant extensions of the previously known results for the Fourier series in the framework of the local fractional calculus. Some examples are given to illustrate the efficiency and implementation of the present method.\n\nHow fast do amphibians disperse? Introductions, distribution and dispersal of the common frog Rana temporaria and the common toad Bufo bufo on a coastal island in Central Norway\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDag Dolmen\n\n2016-04-01\n\nFull Text Available The common frog (Rana temporaria and the common toad (Bufo bufo were introduced successfullyÂ to the coastal island of FrÃ¸ya in Central Norway several times during 1960â2012. There is still a veryÂ high degree of conformity between sites where they were introduced and the present distribution ofÂ the two species. However, in western FrÃ¸ya, a release of frogs about 1996 was followed by a quickÂ expansion of their distribution area; in 2012 and 2013, breeding was registered close to 7 km westwardsÂ and eastwards, respectively, i.e. a population dispersal speed of approximately 0.4 km/yr. On easternÂ FrÃ¸ya and some small islands in the archipelago, area expansions at another four frog localities haveÂ been prevented by ecological barriers like unfavourable limnetic or terrestrial habitats or salty water.Â Two local common toad populations on eastern FrÃ¸ya do not show any expansion either. However, anÂ apparently isolated record of the species on western FrÃ¸ya in 2011 can possibly be explained by theÂ expansion westwards of a population in northern central FrÃ¸ya, where toads were introduced aroundÂ 1995. This stretch is about 9.9 km, i.e. an average population dispersal speed of 0.6 km/yr.\n\nSelf-similar transmission properties of aperiodic Cantor potentials in gapped graphene\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRodrÃ­guez-GonzÃ¡lez, Rogelio; RodrÃ­guez-Vargas, Isaac; DÃ­az-Guerrero, Dan Sidney; Gaggero-Sager, Luis Manuel\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe investigate the transmission properties of quasiperiodic or aperiodic structures based on graphene arranged according to the Cantor sequence. In particular, we have found self-similar behaviour in the transmission spectra, and most importantly, we have calculated the scalability of the spectra. To do this, we implement and propose scaling rules for each one of the fundamental parameters: generation number, height of the barriers and length of the system. With this in mind we have been able to reproduce the reference transmission spectrum, applying the appropriate scaling rule, by means of the scaled transmission spectrum. These scaling rules are valid for both normal and oblique incidence, and as far as we can see the basic ingredients to obtain self-similar characteristics are: relativistic Dirac electrons, a self-similar structure and the non-conservation of the pseudo-spin.\n\nDeriving freshwater quality criteria for 2,4-dichlorophenol for protection of aquatic life in China\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nYin Daqiang; Jin Hongjun; Yu Lingwei; Hu Shuangqing\n\n2003-04-01\n\nCriteria were established for an organic pollutant in freshwaters of China. - Freshwater quality criteria for 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) were developed with particular reference to the aquatic biota in China, and based on USEPA's guidelines.
