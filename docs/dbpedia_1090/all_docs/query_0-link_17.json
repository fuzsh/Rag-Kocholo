        "text": "The final day at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao was filled with tension as the Medal Races decided the podium places, Rio 2016 Olympic qualification spots and Abu Dhabi World Cup Final positions.\n\nAlongside this, sailors in the top three in each fleet receive a share of the 150,000 Euro prize fund.\n\nLight wind and strong current has been a regularity throughout the week with those reading the conditions to full effect reaping the rewards. A 5-7 south eastern breeze made for a tense finale with sailors aiming to leave nothing on the water.\n\nChinese sailors dominated the day taking gold in the Men’s 470, Finn, Laser Radial and the Men’s and Women’s RS:X. Meanwhile, Singapore’s Justin Liu and Denise Lim in the Nacra 17, Laser sailor Lorenzo Chiavarini (GBR) and Japan’s Women’s 470 team took the spoils in their fleets.\n\nNacra 17\n\nSingapore’s Justin Liu and Denise Lim stylishly wrapped up gold in the Nacra 17 with a Medal Race victory. It was their tenth race win of the week and with gold, they have qualified Singapore for a Rio 2016 Nacra 17 spot.\n\nThe pair revelled in Qingdao’s light air and with conditions in the Medal Race similar to the days prior, the odds were in their favour. Liu and Lim worked their way through the fleet during the Medal Race and finished 51 seconds clear of Japan’s Hiroki Goto and Wakako Tabata.\n\nThroughout the week the Singaporeans remained coy about their chances, not taking anything for granted. When they crossed the finish there was visible sense of a relief that was quickly overtaken by joy as they let the celebrations commence.\n\n“It’s amazing,” said Liu through a beaming smile. “There were so many challenges to make it here and to try and qualify the country. To be able to do it is amazing. It’ll be our first Olympics so there is so much to look forward to.”\n\nLim added, “We sailed the conditions quite well, and with our coaches help, he helped us a lot with the current and the wind changes and I think that gave us an advantage over the rest.”\n\nWhilst the Singaporeans can look forward, the teams from China, Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand were understandably disappointed. A world cup silver and bronze for Zijin Wen and Rubei Yuan (CHN) and Tat Choi Fung and Yu Ting Chan (HKG) were mere consolation with Olympic dreams filling their head in advance of the competition.\n\nJapan’s Goto and Tabata had beaten their main rivals in several key regattas building up to Qingdao but the big breeze that they excel in failed to kick in in Qingdao as they finished fifth overall.\n\nNonetheless, Goto remained complimentary to the Singaporeans and has an eye on the future, “I have to take my hat off to the Singapore team. It was light wind and they totally dominated. They sailed the wind so well.\n\n“My aim was to inspire the next generation of Nacra sailors, and the next Olympic Sailing [Competition] will be in my home town of Enoshima. I will be there, hopefully as a coach because I have young people asking me to help them, so this is good. I’m not happy now but we have to look to the future for everyone.”\n\nThe Olympic Games aims to inspire generation after generation and with key inspirations such as Hiroki Goto driving the sport and multihull sailing forward, watch out for a high flying Japanese Nacra 17 team at Tokyo 2020.\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nMeanwhile in the Women’s 470 there was cause for Japanese merriment as the team snapped up gold and silver respectively.\n\nAi Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (JPN) held onto their overnight lead whilst a second in the Medal Race promoted Akiyo Yamaguchi and Eri Hatayama (JPN) into silver medal position.\n\nAs Yamaguchi and Hatayama crossed the finished line there were smiles stretched across their faces with high fives aplenty. Kondo Yoshida and Yoshioka followed behind them in third and revelled in their compatriots’ celebrations with grins creeping in before they finished.\n\nIt was a tense race in the light breeze for all the competitors and the points were close going into the race. Xiaoli Wang and Lizhu Huang (CHN) were breathing down the Kondo Yoshida and Yoshioka’s necks but the Japanese experience shone through as they remained calm as Kondo Yoshida explained, “Today there was a two point lead for us against the Chinese team who were our closest rivals. We got the win and we are very very happy.”\n\nShasha Chen and Haiyan Gao (CHN) completed the Women’s 470 podium.\n\nIt was a three way shoot out in the Men’s 470 between the Austrian, Chinese and Spanish teams. Four points separated them going into the Medal Race and it was China’s Hao Lan and Chao Wang who prevailed.\n\nLan and Wang finished second in the Medal Race compared to overnight leader David Bargehr and David Mahr’s fourth (AUT) and Onan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera’s (ESP) third. As a result the Austrians were made to settle for silver, one point behind the Chinese with the Spaniards rounding off the podium.\n\n“There is a little bit of a mixture between happy and disappointed,” explained Bargehr. “But overall the happy feeling is superior because we won a medal here and it’s always good to win a medal.\n\n“We knew that points were very close with not much separation so we knew we had to sail a really good Medal Race to win this event.\n\n“After the race you are always more clever than before, but it was a really tight Medal Race and it could have gone either way. And always you need a little bit of luck in a Medal Race.”\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nThe advantage going into the Laser Medal Race belonged to Great Britain’s Lorenzo Chiavarini as he owned a 17 point lead. He delivered the goods with a sixth place finish to complete a comfortable victory.\n\n“I was a bit nervous coming into the day,” explained the British sailor, “but once I got out on the water everything started calming down.\n\n“The race track was shorter so the gains were less today. Tiredness was also another point of the day but for me it was important to keep Tonci [Stipanovic] around me and not let him go too far.”\n\nCroatia’s Stipanovic needed the to go massively in his favour if he was to overthrow Chiavarini. The British sailor controlled him and kept the Croatian behind him throughout the race with Stipanovic finishing second overall.\n\nThe Medal Race victory went the way of Pavlos Kontides (CYP) who moved up into the bronze medal position.\n\nChinese Laser Radial sailor Dongshuang Zhang loves sailing in Qingdao. She took her third consecutive victory at the event with another professional performance.\n\nZhang finished second in the Medal Race which confirmed her as gold medallist after the second placed Isabella Bertold (CAN) finished eighth overall.\n\nDespite finishing 17 points clear of her rivals, taking another World Cup gold medal, 12,000 Euros in prize money and booking a spot at the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final Zhang was less than impressed with her performance as she explained, “The race went very well, better than yesterday. I’m not very satisfied with the regatta, I made a lot of small mistakes which I will work on little by little.”\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nIt was double gold for China in the Men’s and Women’s RS:X with Chunzuang Liu and Jiahui Wu clinching gold in their respected fleets.\n\nWu led the Women’s RS:X fleet from the first day but heading into the Medal Race Peina Chen (CHN) was firmly in contention, just six points off the leader. Chen finished one place ahead of Wu in the Medal Race but it wasn’t enough to topple her as Wu sealed gold.\n\n“There was little wind and a lot of pumping,” explained Wu after racing, “but I am very happy with the win. It was a great competition for me and the less wind suited my style.”\n\nPei Ling Chen (CHN) took the Medal Race victory to pick up bronze.\n\nExperienced Spanish racer Blanca Manchon finished in eighth but was upbeat after racing with lots of lessons learnt from Qingdao’s challenging current, “I had two OCS this week, I was risking a lot because I came here for training so it was good for me to try a little risk on the starts, but with the currents it was hard to be on the line and sometimes I just made a mistake. If I didn’t have that second OCS I would have finished third so I am happy.\n\n“This place is totally different to Spain. It’s funny. It’s a different culture and wind so it was good. There was not much wind but it was great for my training.”\n\nNot much separated the Men’s RS:X fleet throughout the Medal Race with tensions high but Liu managed to put himself in a good position. A second place confirmed his gold medal and upon crossing the finish line he let out a triumphant, “woohoo.”\n\nOnce ashore Liu said, “I performed really well, better than normal. Over the regatta there has been good and bad, but overall it has been good and I have learned a lot. We have made great progress as a nation in windsurfing with tough exercises.”\n\nBing Ye (CHN) and Zhichao Zang (CHN) complete the podium.\n\nFinn\n\nChina’s Lei Gong overthrew Luwen Shen in the Finn to snap up a hard earned gold medal.\n\nGong and Shen battled hard throughout the week with very little separating them on the race track. The advantage belonged to Shen going into the Medal Race as he led Gong by five points.\n\nHowever it was Gong’s experience that shone through in the Medal Race as he took a convincing bullet with Shen sailing through in fourth. One point was the difference at the end of the day.\n\nFor China’s Finn team it was a job well done throughout the week as they booked the nation a spot at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.\n\nAttention now turns to the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final that is scheduled to take place from 27 October to 1 November 2015 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe best placed Asian and International sailors from ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao have booked their spot on the start line with the remaining sailors to be invited based on the ISAF World Sailing Rankings that will be released on 21 September.\n\nMore than 240 sailors from 37 nations will be in Qingdao, China from 14 – 20 September 2015 for the next ISAF Sailing World Cup instalment.\n\nOn offer will be world class racing across nine Olympic fleets, Abu Dhabi ISAF Sailing World Cup Final spots, Rio 2016 Olympic Games places, a share of the $150,000 USD prize fund as well as World Cup medals.\n\nAs the Asian continental qualification regatta for the Men’s and Women’s 470, Finn and Nacra 17 the competition in Qingdao is set to be fierce with a depth of international sailing talent within the respective fleets. Alongside this, sailors will be aiming to book their place on the start line of the Abu Dhabi ISAF Sailing World Cup Final at the end of October.\n\nChina’s Aichen Wang will be the man to beat in the Men’s RS:X after he dominated the Aquece Rio – International Sailing Regatta 2015, the Olympic test event. Under the leadership of Beijing 2008 gold medallist Tom Ashley (NZL), Wang led from start to finish and looked untouchable.\n\nFollowing a silver medal at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao in 2014, Wang will be aiming to go one better to pick up his first World Cup gold.\n\nMateo Sanz (SUI) will head into the Men’s RS:X competition off the back of a solid result at the test event that saw him qualify for the Swiss Sailing Team. As well as aiming to qualify for the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final, Sanz is using Qingdao as preparation for the RS:X Worlds, an Olympic qualifier, “I’m looking forward to the event because it’s going to be my last regatta before the Worlds in Oman, but not as a peak event.\n\n“My next step is to qualify the nation for the Olympic Games in Oman as the next six countries will qualify, so I want to be there.\n\n“I expect a physical regatta with light wind where we will have to pump a lot, but everything could be. I haven’t done anything special for this event, as my team only decided to go short time ago – but [I have done] water training combined with endurance and strength sessions.”\n\nA fleet of 30 will race in Qingdao with Wang’s and Sanz’s main threats likely to come from Spain’s Joan Cardona, Hong Kong’s Michael Cheng, Italy’s Daniele Benedetti and Lithuania’s Juozas Bernotas.\n\nThe Women’s RS:X fleet will be spearheaded by a strong Chinese contingent that often revel in the light conditions that Qingdao has to offer.\n\nChina’s Jiali Sun enjoyed the conditions in 2014, taking a solid victory over Russia’s Olga Maslivets. Sun returns for the 2015 edition aiming to stake her claim and qualify for the Abu Dhabi World Cup Final.\n\nAlongside Sun will be 20 other competitors aiming for a share of the prize fund, a World Cup Final spot and a World Cup honour. Peina Chen (CHN) will be looking to recapture the title she won at the inaugural World Cup Qingdao in 2013 whilst 2013 ISAF Youth Worlds gold medallist Yunxiu Lu (CHN) will be searching for her first major senior title.\n\nTonci Stipanovic (CRO) will be aiming to make it three victories from three at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao having controlled the 2013 and 2014 editions. Stipanovic mastered Qingdao’s strong current and light breeze at the previous editions and with a wealth of knowledge; it will be hard for the chasing pack of 39 to catch him.\n\nOne man with a strong chance of overthrowing Stipanovic is Cyprus’ Pavlos Kontides. The Cypriot, who won his country’s first Olympic medal ever at London 2012, has finished second to Stipanovic on both occasions in Qingdao. Kontides has come close but the Croatian has always managed to find a way to win. Will 2015 see a different result? Only time will tell.\n\nThe fleet is packed full of exceptional Laser sailors who will all be gunning for the podium. Jean Baptiste Bernaz (FRA), Wannes Van Laer (BEL), Bruno Fontes (BRA), Karl Martin Rammo (EST), Cy Thompson (ISV) and Colin Cheng (SIN) all have the capabilities of getting it right on the night and posing a challenge.\n\nLike Stipanovic, China’s Dongshuang Zhang is undefeated at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao. At the 2013 edition she match raced Tatiana Drozdovskaya (BLR) to the back of the pack to take gold, whilst in 2014 she came out on top in a four way shoot out for gold between Tina Mihelic (CRO), Sara Winther (NZL) and Drozdovskaya.\n\nThe Belorussian and New Zealand sailors return to Qingdao in a bid to defeat Zhang. Further sailors aiming to put themselves in the mix include Ashley Stoddart (AUS), Isabella Bertold (CAN), Alison Young (GBR), Manami Doi (JPN) and Elizabeth Sin (SIN).\n\nRacing across the nine Olympic fleets is scheduled to commence on 16 September with Medal Races bringing the regatta to a close on 20 September.\n\nThe stakes at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao, taking place from 14-20 September 2015, will be raised with Rio 2016 Olympic Sailing Competition places on the line.\n\nAs the Asian continental qualification regatta for the Men’s and Women’s 470, Finn and Nacra 17 the competition in Qingdao is set to be fierce with a depth of international sailing talent within the respective fleets. Alongside Olympic qualification, more than 240 sailors from 37 nations will be gunning for a share of the $150,000 USD prize fund, ISAF Sailing World Cup Final spots as well as a World Cup medal.\n\nQingdao will be the final chance for Asian Nacra 17 sailors to qualify for Rio 2016 after 13 spots were distributed at the 2014 ISAF Worlds and 2015 Nacra 17 Worlds. The 470 and Finn sailors will have another opportunity later on in the year at their respective World Championships.\n\nThe last time an Asian crew, who weren’t representing the host nation, sailed in an Olympic multihull competition was Seoul 1988 as Naoyuki Ogawa and Takashi Tamura flew the Japanese flag on their Tornado. Fast forward to 2015 and crews from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and Thailand have an opportunity to qualify for an Olympic Games outright and on merit.\n\nJapan’s Hiroki Goto and Wakako Tabata arguably come into the regatta as the pair to beat. Goto and Tabata finished ahead of Justin Liu and Denise Lim (SIN) by two spots at the 2015 Nacra 17 Worlds and five clear of Hong Kong’s Tat Choi Fund and Yu Ting Chan.\n\nGoto has hopes of qualifying for Rio but his intention and drive is to inspire the youth of the country to sail multihulls ahead of Tokyo 2020, a home Olympic Games.\n\n“There is almost no multihull sailing in Japan whatsoever,” commented Goto. “We have a home [Olympic] Games in Tokyo and we need someone there. It would be ideal to get someone in the Games before. I wanted someone to start but no one came forward so I went for it.\n\n“The change to the qualification is good. It would be so tough otherwise for example Africa and Asia to qualify for the Olympics.\n\n“I really hope that I can encourage the younger generation to take up multihull. I am 42 and I want to show if I can do it, they can definitely do it.”\n\nGoto’s hopes could turn into reality in Qingdao but the Singaporean and Hong Kong teams will provide a real challenge whilst a contingent of four Chinese teams will benefit from knowing their home waters.\n\nWhoever takes that spot will also book their ticket to the Abu Dhabi ISAF Sailing World Cup Final making it a double whammy from Qingdao.\n\nThe Men’s 470 will be one of the most hotly contested battles with eight nations, China, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand all battling for one Olympic spot.\n\nSingapore’s Darren Choy, who will be sailing with Jeremiah Yeo, has had a feel of what the Olympics is like after competing at the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games and is aiming for the real deal. “The Youth Olympic Games made me want to experience the Olympic Games and feel the true spirit in the games because it is the highest prestige in the sport and to compete for Singapore would be an honour,” said Choy.\n\nHe continued, “The event is a really important one for us. It is our only ticket now to the 2016 Rio Olympics, as well as the opportunity to show that we are worth sponsoring and funding. I would love to qualify as this would give me a taste on what the Games are like and to experience it would be a dream for me.”\n\nCompared to those around them, Choy and Yeo are two of the youngest sailors in the fleet and miss out on some big time experience that their rivals hold and Choy was quick to identify his main rivals for Qingdao when asked, “It would definitely have to be the top Chinese and Korean teams as they have been on the Olympic circuit for many years, thus have a lot of experience. We’ve been working on some speed technique and race preparation in Singapore and I’m aiming to be the top Asian nation, and to qualify Singapore for the Rio Olympics.”\n\nChina will be represented by 13 Men’s 470 teams in Qingdao and with a strong presence on the start line, could be viewed as the favourites to take the Olympic spot. However, in a fleet of 32 that also features top 470 sailors such as David Bargehr and Lukas Mahr (AUT) and Onan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera (ESP), anything can happen.\n\nIn the Women’s 470, the fight will be between Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. The strong teams from China and Japan qualified at the Santander 2014 ISAF Worlds making it a three horse race for qualification.\n\nAs for the battle to Abu Dhabi, defending champions Mengxi Wei and Yani Xu (CHN) return to defend their title but will face stiff competition from Angela Pumariega and Patricia Cantero Reina (ESP) and Ai Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (JPN).\n\nIn the Finn fleet, eight boats will take to the start line and include seven Chinese sailors and one Iranian. The odds will be heavily stacked towards the Chinese sailors with regards to the one Olympic spot on offer and the Abu Dhabi World Cup final spot but Iran’s Ahmad Ahmadi will fight hard across the week.\n\nRacing across the nine Olympic fleets is scheduled to commence on 16 September with Medal Races bringing the regatta to a close on 20 September.\n\nIt was a light wind, big wave finish at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao aså the medallists were decided across the six fleets competing on the waters of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Sailing Competition.\n\nByron Kokkalanis (GRE) had wrapped up gold in the Men’s RS:X the day prior but intriguing battles for gold across the remaining fleets played out in a tense day of competition.\n\nThe stakes were high with Qingdao medals on the line, a share of the prize money and invitation places at stake for the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final set to be held at the end of November in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\nLaser\n\nTonci Stipanovic (CRO) overcame Pavlos Kontides (CYP) in a two man duel for gold and silver in the Laser.\n\nThe duo were split by four points and held an unassailable lead going into the Medal Race so it was inevitable that they would lock horns from the off as they fought tooth and nail.\n\nStipanovic explained proceedings from his eyes, “Today I decided I would go on Pavlos immediately from the start. I was trying to stay really close and get him away from the start but he was time staying in the middle of the line all the time and 30 seconds before the start I made a mistake and I opened up the doors for him.\n\n“It was really tricky and I was pushing hoping he would make one mistake. At the first upwind mark I was last but it was not so bad as I caught some breeze and after 50 metres on the downwind I was only two metres behind him.\n\n“On the second upwind we were together and he didn’t follow me and that was a chance for me and I took it and came in front of him and after that I controlled him.”\n\nKontides was left to rue not following the Croatian as he analysed his race, “From the start I had a huge advantage but the wind was really tricky and you didn’t know where it was coming from. I had two options after the gate, to tack immediately and cover him or proceed a bit more and wait for the right shift. I thought the right would pay. By proceeding I was depending on the wind and the wind went left and I went right so I was wrong in my estimation and then I ended up behind him.\n\n“It was always going to be hard because he will always push you over the layline and then it’s game over.\n\n“I’m happy with how I sailed but I’m disappointed not to get gold, I have many silvers and now I have one more to the tally but I will keep on fighting. If I keep on sailing like I have this week then the gold will be pretty near.”\n\nThe fight was also on for bronze with Tom Burton (AUS) sitting ahead of Wannes Van Laer (BEL) by just one point before the Medal Race.\n\nBurton came through in third, three places ahead of Van Laer to take bronze but there were a few nerves on the race track, “The first beat everybody had a close eye on each other. I wasn’t looking too good at the top mark. Wannes was in front by a few boats so I just had to stay close and put a bit of pressure on him. I managed to get a bit of pressure on the second beat and just snuck past and held off to the finish\n\n“I’m reasonably happy. It’s nice to finish a tough week, I wasn’t happy with the way I was sailing. The guys at the front were really on to it. You’ve got to be on top of your game.”\n\nStipanovic, Kontides and Burton have already booked their plane tickets for the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final. The spot was wide open and Wannes van Laer’s fourth gave him the spot. As top Asian finisher, Colin Cheng (SIN) also receives an invitation.\n\nLaser Radial\n\nDongshuang Zhang (CHN) defended her ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao title after a tight week of Laser Radial sailing.\n\nZhang, Tatiana Drozdovskaya (BLR), Tina Mihelic (CRO) and Sara Winther (NZL) were all extremely tight heading into the Medal Race. With the points close anything was possible.\n\nWith a light frame and knowledge of Qingdao’s waters Zhang navigated the tricky conditions with expertise. She came through in third and most importantly well ahead of her three rivals, taking gold by 11 points. With a successful defence Zhang was beaming after racing, “I am really happy with the result and really happy to win in Qingdao, again,” said Zhang. “My performance was very good in today’s wind conditions. In the whole of the event sometimes the wind was strong and the direction was not one I’m used my performance was solid and I just tried my best to get as high as possible. I am really happy with my performance.”\n\nIt was a late finish the day prior with protests aplenty in the Laser Radial fleet. Mihelic was disqualified from the penultimate race and dropped out of the medals heading into the final day.\n\nWith the pressure high and needing a result the Croatian did not fail to deliver and finished ahead of Winther and Drozdovskaya to take silver, “The Medal Race was a really nervous race with lots of protests because four of us were really close. In the end I managed to finish fifth and end up with enough points to finish ahead of the girls from New Zealand and Belarus.\n\n“It was a light wind race so it was hard. There were a lot of jury out there so we had to be careful not to get penalised. It was really nervous with a few shifts and the wind going up and down.\n\n“Coming from fourth to second is a good feeling.”\n\nDrozdovskaya came through in last spot in the Medal Race and dropped out of the medal positions. Despite receiving a standard penalty, Winther held on to a podium position, taking bronze.\n\nWinther’s third place gives her an ISAF Sailing World Cup Final invitation spot. Min Gu (CHN) was the top Asian sailor and therefore receives an invitation.\n\nMen’s 470\n\nJordi Xammar and Joan Herp (ESP) took their first ISAF Sailing World Cup victory with a strong performance in Qingdao.\n\nThe two time Junior World Champions took a good lead into the Medal Race and a seventh was enough for them to take gold by four points over Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis (GRE). Xammar and Herp, who celebrated his 21st birthday on the final day, have thrived in Qingdao and having played down their chances in advance walk away as deserved victors.\n\n“It’s incredible to finish this regatta like this,” said Herp. “We didn’t expect this result before we came here but we sailed very well over the last few days and the Medal Race was tough because everybody was very close and anybody could put a boat in between us but that is sailing and we have to manage the pressure. We’re very happy about the ending.”\n\nIt’s been a fantastic year for the young Spaniards who have a string of achievements under their belts as Xammar concluded, “We are really happy with our season. We won the Junior Worlds and Europeans and finished seventh at the worlds and that was incredible for us. Now, coming here to a World Cup in Qingdao and winning is like… We thought Santander was the perfect thing and that was the end but coming here and winning our first World Cup in our lives is really good. This isn’t junior sailing; all the seniors are here with years of experience.\n\n“It’s amazing.”\n\nPanagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis (GRE) were the early leaders in the Men’s 470 but trailed the Spaniards by ten points heading into the Medal Race. A fourth compared to Xammar and Herp’s seventh was not enough for them to reduce the deficit but they did maintain second overall. “The Medal Race was difficult for us,” explained Mantis. “We tried to start close to both Spanish boats, we achieved that but we wanted to keep the right side but we ended up with the left side and we managed to pass the top mark not in a good position.\n\n“We were almost losing second place. We tried to recover and we finished fourth and this gave us the silver medal. We are very happy about this because it’s always very good to get a medal in an ISAF Sailing World Cup regatta.”\n\nOnan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera (ESP) round off the podium.\n\nHenrique Haddad and Bruno Amorim (BRA) and Zangjun Xu and Wei Wang (CHN) are the recipients of an ISAF Sailing World Cup Final invitation.\n\nWomen’s 470\n\nIt was victory for home nation sailors Mengxi Wei and Yani Xu in the Women’s 470 who sealed the deal with a second place in the Medal Race. They have been the standout performers in the Women’s 470 finishing out of the top two on just two occasions across the week.\n\nAfter racing Wei said, “I feel very grown up and happy that I have won here. I feel very lucky to come to Qingdao and represent China. I am honoured and proud to win a gold medal.”\n\nXiaomei Xu and Ping Zhang (CHN) took silver with a third in the Medal Race\n\nShasha Chen and Haiyan Gao (CHN) pushed Ai Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (JPN) out of the medal places after taking the final race victory. The Japanese pair could only muster a fifth which saw them miss out on bronze by three points.\n\nAs winners Wei and Xu receive an ISAF Sailing World Cup Final invitation.\n\nMen’s RS:X\n\nWith Byron Kokkalanis (GRE) wrapping up gold ahead of the Medal Race all eyes were on the fight for silver and bronze between Aichen Wang (CHN) and Max Oberemko (RUS).\n\nFive points split the pair ahead of the Medal Race, so it was game on. Oberemko knew what needed to be done and had a tremendous first upwind to hold the lead but Wang was hot on his heels rounding in second.\n\nOberemko stayed at the front of the fleet but Wang was persistent and kept up with his pace. Oberemko edged away from Wang as the race played out but unfortunately for the Russian, Wang was also extending his advantage over third place. Oberemko took the bullet and Wang came through with a comfortable second to seal silver.\n\nKokkalanis stayed out of their way throughout the race with a relaxed demeanour on the race course. He concluded the event with a fifth place in the Medal Race.\n\nThe Greek sailor has been a class above the rest of the fleet and has loved the ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao experience, “It feels really nice to be in Qingdao, the venue of the Beijing Olympics, and win an event like this.\n\n“It was a really nice experience to see the place, the marina, the feeling and knowing it hosted such a big event. To see the conditions that everybody was talking about, that it was really hard, humid and light winds. Basically the period now is the best and it’s a really nice temperature. It was an amazing week. We had all sorts of conditions so it was one of the best regattas I’ve had this year.”\n\nWith Kokkalanis qualifying for Abu Dhabi at the Santander 2014 ISAF Worlds, Aichen Wang (CHN) receives the invitational spot as the next leading sailor.\n\nWomen’s RS:X\n\nJiahui Wu (CHN) took gold in the Women’s RS:X, holding off Olga Maslivets (RUS) in the Medal Race to seal the deal. The Chinese sailor moved into pole position the day prior after Maslivets received a disqualification.\n\nSun came through in fifth compared to Maslivets’ seventh that ensured she finished 11.4 points ahead of the Russian.\n\nAfter racing Wu said, “The weather and wind has been good. I have tried my best throughout the whole competition and I feel really good about winning. I have been confident throughout the competition.”\n\nMaslivets knew what she had to do in the Medal Race and worked hard on the water, putting her final efforts into the race but in the light breeze she was unable to find an edge and missed out on gold. Nonetheless she was pleased with her performance, “I’m still happy as I’ve just come back onto the RS:X after two years out. It’s good to be back on the track and I feel happy in the RS:X again.\n\n“It’s a different Qingdao to the one I knew and I liked it more because we had good winds, really nice winds from the sea which we never had six years ago. I like the challenging conditions with the difficult current and the waves.”\n\nHongmei Shi (CHN) blitzed the field in the Medal race, taking the bullet which subsequently moved her into third overall after Mei Hao floundered in ninth position. Shi took bronze by just a single point over Hao.\n\nWith Sun already invited to Abu Dhabi, the invitation is given to Olga Maslivets (RUS).\n\nNext up for many of the racers is the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates from 26-30 November.\n\nIt was a light wind day at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao with many ups and downs across the six fleets competing on the Beijing 2008 Olympic waters.\n\nAfter a short early afternoon delay the sailors headed out onto the water with a shifty breeze and strong current that would once again test them to the max.\n\nOne race was completed in the Men’s and Women’s 470, Laser and Laser Radial whilst the Men’s and Women’s RS:X packs, sailing shorter races, completed two.\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nHome nation sailors Mengxi Wei and Yani Xu (CHN) have been head and shoulders above the rest in the Women’s 470 across five completed races. The Chinese pair were bang on form again on the third day of the competition in the single Women’s 470 race.\n\nWith a great start Wei and Xu took the lead from the off. At the first mark they held a five second advantage over Ai Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (JPN). The Chinese leaders slowly extended the gap to 11 seconds at the end of the first downwind. The Japanese pair kept Wei and Xu within their sights but pushed a little too hard and received a penalty that relegated them down the pack. After racing a disappointed Kondo said, “The current was very strong and close to the shore. It was really difficult for racing and I got a penalty. The wind was down and difficult today.”\n\nWhilst Wei and Xu had lost the Japanese pair they had new company. China’s Shasha Chen and Haiyan Gao managed to read the conditions well and moved up from tenth to second. However Wei and Xu showed their strength and took the bullet ahead of Chen and Gao.\n\nWei and Xu sit pretty at the top of the pack on five points whilst three points separates Xiaomei Xu and Ping Zhang (CHN), Chen and Gao and Japan’s Kondo and Yoshioka.\n\nThere were several big up and downs in the single Men’s 470 race as the current made life tough. The fleet of 17 were forced to sail above the layline to take the current into account. Several teams read the situation well and flourished whilst others fell back in a game of snakes and ladders.\n\nHenrique Haddad and Bruno Bethlem (BRA) took their chances and rounded the first mark ahead of South Africa’s Asenathi Jim and Roger Hudson who just missed the layline. The Brazilians were able to extend their advantage as the race played eventually taking the bullet.\n\nBehind them the fleet were up and down. Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis (GRE) and Jordi Xammar and Joan Herp (ESP) held a joint lead coming into the day. There was very little separating the teams early on in the race but the Greeks were penalised and dropped down the pack eventually finishing 14th, which they discard.\n\nXammar and Herp were more fortunate and worked their way to a solid second which Xammar explained at the end of the day, “Well it was a difficult race. We are very happy with our result. Going into tomorrow we are first and we are really happy. It was really hard racing, a lot of current, a lot of changes in pressure and shifts.\n\n“We had to really concentrate and watch the next mark all the time to see the pressure. We were a bit lucky but we managed to finish second.”\n\nThe young Spaniards hold the lead on nine points. Mantis and Kagialis are second on 13 points whilst Pavel Sozykin and Denis Gribanov (RUS) maintain third overall.\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nAn intriguing battle is developing within the Laser Radial with small margins separating the top four sailors.\n\n2013 ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao gold medallist Dongshuang Zhang (CHN) has the lead on nine points following victory in the single Radial race.\n\nZhang displayed excellent tactical nous in the light winds at the 2013 edition of the regatta and she thrived in the conditions on the third day of the 2014 regatta, taking the bullet by eight seconds over Croatia’s Ana Zelic.\n\nZhang has a four point lead over Tatiana Drozdovskaya (BLR), Tina Mihelic (CRO) and Sara Winther (NZL) who are all tied on 13 points. With three races scheduled on the penultimate day much can change with ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao honours on the line.\n\nTonci Stipanovic (CRO) is the Laser master of Qingdao’s light winds and strong current. The Croatian picked up his fourth bullet of the regatta in the only Laser race and holds a six point lead over Pavlos Kontides (CYP) heading into the penultimate day.\n\nJust nine points separate third to eighth in the Laser with three races remaining.\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nByron Kokkalanis (GRE) continues to lead the Men’s RS:X despite a less than convincing day in the lighter breeze. The Greek sailor’s overnight 16 point lead was reduced to 11 points following a fifth and a discarded ninth.\n\nAichen Wang (CHN) enjoyed one of his best days of racing posting a bullet and a third to subsequently reduce Kokkalanis’ advantage. Max Oberemko (RUS) remains third overall but Michael Cheng (HKG) is piling on the pressure as he sits just four points behind.\n\nOlga Maslivets (RUS) Women’s RS:X lead stands at nearly 20 points heading into penultimate day. With a redress of 4.4 points and a fifth she is on 19.4 points. Jiali Sun (CHN) stole the day with a light wind master class. Many Chinese sailors are known for being strong in the lighter breeze and Sun exemplified that by taking a bullet and a second. As a result she moves to second overall, sitting on 37 points.\n\nHongmei Shi (CHN) is third overall on 47 points.\n\nRacing is scheduled to commence at 12:00 local time on Friday 17 October.\n\nIt was a day of tight battles and close knit racing at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao as the six fleets enjoyed a strong breeze in Qingdao, China.\n\nThere were several close finishes across the fleets with 13-18 knots of south westerly breeze and up to 2.5 knots of current on the race track making life tough for the 171 sailors from 21 nations.\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nGreece’s Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis and Spain’s Jordi Xammar and Joan Herp are tied at the top on seven points in the Men’s 470 following an exciting day of racing.\n\nWith big breeze, strong current and plenty of waves Xammar and Herp stole the day as they posted two second places. However it could have been better as they lost out on a bullet in the opening race of the day.\n\nThe Spaniards took the lead early on in the race and held a narrow advantage over Mantis and Kagialis as the race played out. On the downwind run to the finish the Greek pair piled on the pressure and started to reduce the Spaniards lead with the finish line approaching.\n\nXammar and Herp kept their head on a swivel, keeping an eye on the Greeks whilst Mantis and Kagialis pushed on. Herp explained what occurred, “They gybed first and then we gybed just after them and they seemed to be gaining an advantage little by little. Thirty seconds before the finish line we took a big wave just at the moment they gybed and then we waited too long to gybe again. If we would have gybed earlier we would have had a safe lead but we waited and then we entered the finish at exactly the same moment.\n\n“It was a photo finish.”\n\nThe Greeks had done enough to take the bullet to continue their solid start. After racing Mantis said, “It was tough. It was shifty and it was difficult to see a breeze because there was a fog. We had a good battle, we had some gybes and some big waves and in the end it was a photo finish at the line. It was nice.”\n\nIn the second race of the day, fourth in total, Russia’s Pavel Sozykin and Denis Gribanov took the bullet with Xammar and Herp coming in second. The Spaniards made up for their disappointment in the first race of the day, moving through the pack. Herp concluded, “We were the best team of the day. We thought we would finish third but on the last downwind we were very fast and we were able to pass the Chinese guys. The left paid all day and we had good speed and we are happy with our day.”\n\nAs it stands the leading Greek and Spanish teams have a five point advantage over Sozykin and Gribanov and Onan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera (ESP).\n\nChina’s Wei Mengxi and Yani Xu maintained their solid start in the Women’s 470 with a bullet and a fourth. Their advantage stands at five points over their compatriots Xiaomei Xu and Zhang Ping.\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nOlga Maslivets (RUS) holds an 11 point lead in the Women’s RS:X following an up and down day. She opened her account with a first and second but after a couple of errors she dropped down to 16th in the final race of the day. Nonetheless, as she discards her 16th, she leads the way on 10 points and is enjoying being back in Qingdao.\n\n“It’s like huge deja-vu after the Olympics in 2008,” commented Maslivets. “I really love the place and it feels so wonderful to be here especially with these good winds. The Chinese are really good competitors in all conditions. It’s their home waters so it’s really competitive. It’s tough to beat them but it’s really fun.”\n\nLu Yunxiu (CHN) sits in second with Hao Mei (CHN) a point behind in third.\n\nGreece’s Byron Kokkalanis continues to dominate in the Men’s RS:X and put in another strong showing on the race track. From three races Kokkalanis took two bullets and a third to give him a 16 point lead heading into the third day.\n\nExperienced racers Aichen Wang (CHN) and Max Oberemko (RUS) trail Kokkalanis in second and third.\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nTatiana Drozdovskaya (BLR) excelled in the Laser Radial, posting double bullets to move into the lead. The Belarusian, 2013 ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao silver medallist, was clinical in the stronger breeze and current. However, Drozdovskaya is just one point ahead of Tina Mihelic (CRO) who discards her ninth in Race 1 following a third and a second.\n\n2013 ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao gold medallist Dongshuang Zhang (CHN) is third on eight points with Sara Winther (NZL) a point behind.\n\nTonci Stipanovic (CRO) maintained his lead in the Laser after he picked up his third race win of the regatta. The Croatian won gold in 2013 and has been using his knowledge of the venue to full effect, mastering the strong current that rips across the race area.\n\nOn the opening day Australia’s Tom Burton struggled with the current but was back to his best from the off on the second day. He took the bullet ahead of Pavlos Kontides but slipped 12th in Race 4.\n\nKontides stays in second overall whilst Wannes Van Laer (BEL) is third.\n\nThe wind is expected to decrease for the third day of competition. Racing is scheduled to commence at 13:00 local time.\n\nMore than 150 sailors from 25 nations racing across six classes are set to compete at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao in China from 14-18 October 2014.\n\nAs the dust settles on the ISAF Sailing World Championships many of the racers are heading east to compete at the second edition of ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao.\n\nRacing across the Men’s and Women’s 470, Laser, Laser Radial and Men’s and Women’s RS:X will take place across three race courses at the venue of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Sailing Competition. Strong Chinese contingents as well as international excellence will make up the six fleets ensuring an exciting week of racing in China.\n\nCompetitors across the six events will be vying for their share of the 180,000USD prize money. 18,000 USD will be awarded to the gold medallist with 8,000 USD and 4,000 USD going to second and third place.\n\nThe Men’s 470 fleet will see 22-boats line up on the start line in Qingdao with a blend of experience and youth amongst the entrants.\n\n2013 and 2014 Junior 470 World Champions Jordi Xammar and Joan Herp (ESP) made major inroads at the Santander 2014 ISAF Worlds, finishing seventh overall. The pair took the Medal Race bullet in Santander and having proven they can beat some of the finest Men’s 470 sailors Xammar is coy on his team’s chances in Qingdao, “It would be great [to win] but I think it is too early to take a win in a senior event and we have still many things to learn but for sure we are going to fight as much as we can.\n\n“Our aim for the World Cup in Qingdao is to keep learning from the best sailors and give our best in every race, we don’t want to fight for one place, just try to be as higher as possible.\n\n“We are expecting a really high level competition and we know that the starts are going to be very important because with a bad start is going to be very difficult to recover.”\n\nThe competition is set to be high in the Men’s 470 with World #3 Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis (GRE), World #6 Sofian Bouvet and Jeremie Mion (FRA) and two time Olympian Onan Barreiros with crew Juan Curbelo Cabrera (ESP) joining Xammar and Herp in the pack.\n\nThe Women’s 470 fleet will see a tight knit 10 boat fleet take to the water. The experienced Ai Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (JPN) will go into the event as favourites but with World #10 Shasha Chen and Haiyan Gao (CHN) and a young, fresh Chinese team joining them they will have their work cut out.\n\nA fleet of 37 will make up the Laser fleet and the level will be high. World #1 Tom Burton (AUS), World #3 Tonci Stipanovic (CRO) and World #4 Pavlos Kontides (CYP) will be within the fleet.\n\nStipanovic and Kontides occupied the top two spots at the 2013 edition of ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao and will no doubt be two of the front runners again. On the week ahead Kontides said, “The Laser class always has tough competition. My goal is to simply sail with fewer mistakes as possible and by doing that I know I can battle for those places on the podium. Last year I was second so improvement will be achieved only by winning gold.”\n\nA mixed bag of conditions tested the fleet at the 2013 edition and more of the same is expected in 2014 as Kontides added, “Last year was a good warm up event for the worlds and a verification that sailing is an all-round sport as we had all kinds of conditions.\n\n“Qingdao is a venue with different sailing conditions from what we are used to sailing in and it is always challenging to sail there. Sport is all about challenge so I am excited to return there to compete.”\n\nWith the likes of Kontides, Stipanovic and Burton within the pack alongside further talent such as Bruno Fontes (BRA), Thomas Saunders (NZL), Karl-Martin Rammo (EST), Colin Cheng and Wannes Van Laer (BEL), the going will be tough for all those involved with 200 ISAF World Ranking points on offer to the winner.\n\nTatiana Drozdovskaya (BLR) was forced down to the back of the pack in the Laser Radial Medal Race at the 2013 version of ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao and missed out on gold as Dongshuang Zhang (CHN) claimed the honours. The Belorussian makes a return to avenge her defeat.\n\nJoining Drozdovskaya in the fleet will be Italy’s Laura Cosentino who is making her second visit to China as she explained, “I’m really looking forward to racing in Qingdao. I was in Rizhao last year for the Radial World Championship where we had some good racing, I hope it will be the same also in Qingdao.\n\n“I think it will be a weird competition, even if it’s a World Cup regatta we are only few competitors. In the Laser Radial we are used to sailing in big fleets, so it will be a totally different kind of racing, more similar to a Medal Race.”\n\nFurther competition for the top places will come from Singapore’s Elizabeth Yin, New Zealand’s Sara Winther and Russia’s Elena Vorobeva.\n\n2014 ISAF Sailing World Cup Miami gold medallist Byron Kokkalanis (GRE) will lead the line in the 37 strong Men’s RS:X fleet in Qingdao. After starting 2014 off with a golden bang in Miami, following up with Sailing World Cup Mallorca silver, the Greek racer missed out on a podium place at the European, Olympic Test Event and Santander 2014 ISAF Worlds.\n\nNot one to dwell on missed chances Kokkalanis is aiming to get back to top spot in Qingdao, “My goal is to win the competition,” said Kokkalanis, “and of course the prize money since we’ve never had competitions with prize money. My other goal is to also get high in the ISAF World Rankings.”\n\nKokkalanis campaigned for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Sailing Competition but missed out on selection so will be making his first trip to Qingdao. Kokkalanis concluded, “I’m really looking forward to competing in the place of the 2008 Olympics. I expect the competition to be very hard in light winds.”\n\nJoining Kokkalanis in the fleet will be a strong Chinese contingent as well as Hong Kong’s Ho Tsun Leung, Italy’s Marcantonio Baglione and Maksim Oberemko (RUS).\n\nThirty one sailors will make up the Women’s RS:X fleet. The Chinese team have been ones to watch in recent months in the Women’s RS:X with many of their team impressing on the international stage. Leading the charge will be 2013 World Cup Qingdao and 2014 World Cup Hyeres silver medallist Jiahui Wu (CHN) and 2013 World Cup Melbourne gold medallist Manjia Zheng (CHN).\n\nRacing is scheduled to commence on 14 October Medal Races bringing the regatta to a close on 18 October."
