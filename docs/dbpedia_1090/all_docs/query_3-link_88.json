        "text": "[quote]I wonder if he jacks off to his own image in the mirror? Gawd damn, he's hot!\n\nI did when I was young. I thought everyone did? Not that I was super handsome but it was just hot seeing a live sex show even if it was just myself.\n\nThat's my ideal guy as well OP. And I'm sure I'm his ideal guy too because some people say I am handsome.\n\nFirst of all OP... that guy is too young for you. Second of all OP... you are too old to have such basic, vanilla tastes.\n\nWhat happened to you OP? When did it all come undone? Does the sun no longer shine brightly in your sky, OP?\n\nI mean....that's pretty much most people's ideal dude-- generally speaking, OP. Was a thread about your generic tastes really necessary?\n\nWake us when you decide to crawl out of the basement and log off. Then you might not be so predictable.\n\n[quote]Don't most 25 year olds who go to the gym look like Op's dude?\n\nMost everyone that goes to the gym looks like OP's dude.\n\nYes, OP, but where did she do her graduate work?\n\nI mean, if she even WENT to graduate school.\n\nSniff.\n\nWonder if OP has come back to this thread to find the name of his ideal dude? OP let us know if you have.\n\n[quote] Ah yes, my ideal dude, based completely on how he looks because that is the only thing that matters. Never change my gays...\n\nOh yes R96 pretend like you are so cerebral that you are never turned by a pretty face, when in fact you are as likely to be turned on by a hot guy or girl depending on your persuasion as the next person. I don't know how you manage to make it through the day being so superior to us mere mortals.\n\nThe Tumblr linked at OP has lots of photos of very hot guys, many with natural pubes too.\n\nLooks like someone got hold (catfished?) a bunch of straight guys sending photos to women.\n\nAll these posts and the OP's is still my favorite. Most of the guys are gym bodies and are too hard. A few are too soft. The OP seems just right.\n\nthe way i see it\n\nif you want the fairy tale\n\nyou have to eat the poisonous apple and\n\nfuck some midgets.\n\nR25 has it right. Almost all of the guys posted here are mainstream vanilla gays.\n\nOP, what do you look like? We can then let you know what's possible.\n\nNot really, I am cool with singleness. If I am Not with my ideal, I am still fulfilled in singleness. I could never be happy settling for less than.\n\nYou better preach r215. After looking at these muscle hos, I am STILL not motivated to step foot in a gym. I'm relieved that I've passed this final test, so that I won't ever need to think about going to the gym, ever again!\n\nAnother one of those random threads that pops up every few weeks and disappears again.\n\nThis one always makes me sad because you know the OP has no chance of ever meeting a guy like that.\n\nWhat's unusual (to me) is the tone.\n\nThings like \"Alpha\" or whatever descriptors the guys use. It's like they've consigned themselves to the bargain bin of life.\n\nI am a Millennial and familiar with those terms R376, but don't really know anyone who uses them. If one of my friends did, we'd all laugh at him, it just sounds so pathetic, like the kid in high school who knew all about the hot jocks and what they did over the weekend and then you realized they had zero idea who he even was."
