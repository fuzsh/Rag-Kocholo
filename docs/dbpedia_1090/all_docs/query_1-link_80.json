        "text": "A Hybrid Approach on Tourism Demand Forecasting\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNor, M. E.; Nurul, A. I. M.; Rusiman, M. S.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nTourism has become one of the important industries that contributes to the countryâs economy. Tourism demand forecasting gives valuable information to policy makers, decision makers and organizations related to tourism industry in order to make crucial decision and planning. However, it is challenging to produce an accurate forecast since economic data such as the tourism data is affected by social, economic and environmental factors. In this study, an equally-weighted hybrid method, which is a combination of Box-Jenkins and Artificial Neural Networks, was applied to forecast Malaysiaâs tourism demand. The forecasting performance was assessed by taking the each individual method as a benchmark. The results showed that this hybrid approach outperformed the other two models\n\nForecasting Croatian inbound tourism demand\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nTica, Josip; KoÅ¾iÄ, Ivan\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe aim of this paper is to present a forecasting model for the overnight stays of foreign tourists in Croatia. Tourism is one of the most important parts of the Croatian economy. It is particularly important in the context of the services sector. Regular and significant surpluses and the consumption of foreign guests are an important element of budget revenues, especially VAT. The ability to forecast the development of inbound tourism demand in a timely manner is crucial for both business...\n\nDemand forecasting and information platform in tourism\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLi Yue\n\n2017-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Information asymmetry and the bullwhip effect have been serious problems in the tourism supply chain. Based on platform theory, this paper established a mathematical model to explore the inner mechanism of a platformâs influence on stakeholdersâ ability to forecast demand in tourism. Results showed that the variance of stakeholdersâ demand predictions with a platform was smaller than the variance without a platform, which meant that a platform would improve predictions of demand for stakeholders. The higher information-processing ability of the platform also had other effects on demand forecasting. Research on the inner logic of the platformâs influence on stakeholders has important theoretical and realistic value. This area is worthy of further study.\n\nTourism Demand Modelling and Forecasting: A Review of Recent Research\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nSong, H; Li, G\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis paper reviews the published studies on tourism demand modelling and forecasting since 2000. One of the key findings of this review is that the methods used in analysing and forecasting the demand for tourism have been more diverse than those identified by other review articles. In addition to the most popular time-series and econometric models, a number of new techniques have emerged in the literature.

Forecasting cruise tourism demand ensures better planning, efficient preparation at the destination and it is the basis for elaboration of future plans. In the recent years, new techniques such as; artificial neural networks were employed for developing of the predictive models to estimate tourism demand. In this study, it is aimed to determine the forecasting method that provides the best performance when compared the forecast accuracy of Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP, Radial Basis Function (RBF and Generalized Regression neural network (GRNN to estimate the monthly inbound cruise tourism demand to Ä°zmir via the method giving best results. We used the total number of foreign cruise tourist arrivals as a measure of inbound cruise tourism demand and monthly cruise tourist arrivals to Ä°zmir Cruise Port in the period of January 2005 âDecember 2013 were utilized to appropriate model. Experimental results showed that radial basis function (RBF neural network outperforms multi-layer perceptron (MLP and the generalised regression neural networks (GRNN in terms of forecasting accuracy. By the means of the obtained RBF neural network model, it has been forecasted the monthly inbound cruise tourism demand to Ä°zmir for the year 2014.\n\nForecasting international tourism demand from the US, Japan and South Korea to Malaysia: A SARIMA approach\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBorhan, Nurbaizura; Arsad, Zainudin\n\n2014-07-01\n\nOne of the major contributing sectors for Malaysia's economic growth is tourism. The number of international tourist arrivals to Malaysia has been showing an upward trend as a result of several programs and promotion introduced by the Malaysian government to attract international tourists to the country. This study attempts to model and to forecast tourism demand for Malaysia by three selected countries: the US, Japan and South Korea. This study utilized monthly time series data for the period from January 1999 to December 2012 and employed the well-known Box-Jenkins seasonal ARIMA modeling procedures. Not surprisingly the results show the number of tourist arrivals from the three countries contain strong seasonal component as the arrivals strongly dependent on the season in the country of origin. The findings of the study also show that the number of tourist arrivals from the US and South Korea will continue to increase in the near future. Meanwhile the arrivals from Japan is forecasted to show a drop in the near future and as such tourism authorities in Malaysia need to enhance the promotional effort to attract more tourists from Japan to visit Malaysia.\n\nAn Analysis of the Performance of International Tourism Demand in Tanzania\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBenson Ndiege\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper analyzes the performance of Tanzanian tourism industry which depends on natural heritage tourism scene particularly natural resources by assessing the trend and forecasting the international tourism demand. The number of international tourist arrivals in Tanzania is used as the proxy measure for international tourism demand. Using the data for the period of 2001q1- 2010q4 and using ARIMA model, the study asserts that the international tourism demand in Tanzania is growing though in a very low pace of about 1% per year. This is less than world average growth that has reported by World Tourism Organization (UNWTO in 2012 to reach 4-5% per annum. Moreover, the Tanzania international tourism demand is becoming increasingly less competitive and has been fluctuating over the years. Thus to reap enough from the world growing international tourism demand the development of artificial tourism scene to supplement the natural heritage and development of new tourism products should be given more attention in a Tanzania tourism industry development.\n\nA novel hybrid ensemble learning paradigm for tourism forecasting\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShabri, Ani\n\n2015-02-01\n\nIn this paper, a hybrid forecasting model based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) is proposed to forecast tourism demand. This methodology first decomposes the original visitor arrival series into several Intrinsic Model Function (IMFs) components and one residual component by EMD technique. Then, IMFs components and the residual components is forecasted respectively using GMDH model whose input variables are selected by using Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF). The final forecasted result for tourism series is produced by aggregating all the forecasted results. For evaluating the performance of the proposed EMD-GMDH methodologies, the monthly data of tourist arrivals from Singapore to Malaysia are used as an illustrative example. Empirical results show that the proposed EMD-GMDH model outperforms the EMD-ARIMA as well as the GMDH and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models without time series decomposition.\n\nDemand Forecasting Methods in Accommodation Establishments: A Research with Artificial Neural Networks\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEbru ULUCAN\n\n2018-05-01\n\nFull Text Available As it being seen in every sector, demand forecasting in tourism is been conducted with various qualitative and quantitative methods. In recent years, artificial neural network models, which have been developed as an alternative to these forecasting methods, give the nearest values in forecasting with the smallest failure percentage. This study aims to reveal that accomodation establishments can use the neural network models as an alternative while forecasting their demand. With this aim, neural network models have been tested by using the sold room values between the period of 2013-2016 of a five star hotel in Istanbul and it is found that the results acquired from the testing models are the nearest values comparing the realized figures. In the light of these results, tourism demand of the hotel for 2017 and 2018 has been forecasted.\n\nTourism demand in the Algarve region: Evolution and forecast using SVARMA models\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLopes, Isabel Cristina; Soares, Filomena; Silva, Eliana Costa e.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nTourism is one of the Portuguese economy's key sectors, and its relative weight has grown over recent years. The Algarve region is particularly focused on attracting foreign tourists and has built over the years a large offer of diversified hotel units. In this paper we present multivariate time series approach to forecast the number of overnight stays in hotel units (hotels, guesthouses or hostels, and tourist apartments) in Algarve. We adjust a seasonal vector autoregressive and moving averages model (SVARMA) to monthly data between 2006 and 2016. The forecast values were compared with the actual values of the overnight stays in Algarve in 2016 and led to a MAPE of 15.1% and RMSE= 53847.28. The MAPE for the Hotel series was merely 4.56%. These forecast values can be used by a hotel manager to predict their occupancy and to determine the best pricing policy.\n\nElectricity demand forecasting techniques\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGnanalingam, K.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nElectricity demand forecasting plays an important role in power generation. The two areas of data that have to be forecasted in a power system are peak demand which determines the capacity (MW) of the plant required and annual energy demand (GWH). Methods used in electricity demand forecasting include time trend analysis and econometric methods. In forecasting, identification of manpower demand, identification of key planning factors, decision on planning horizon, differentiation between prediction and projection (i.e. development of different scenarios) and choosing from different forecasting techniques are important\n\nMigration and Tourism Demand\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNuno Carlos LEITÃO\n\n2012-02-01\n\nFull Text Available This study considers the relationship between immigration and Portuguese tourism demand for the period 1995-2008, using a dynamic panel data approach. The findings indicate that Portuguese tourism increased significantly during the period in accordance with the values expected for a developed country. The regression results show that income, shock of immigration, population, and geographical distance between Portugal and countries of origin are the main determinants of Portuguese tourism.\n\nMEDICAL TOURISM : Demand for Cuban Medical Tourism by Russian Consumers\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nUlanova, Anastasia\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMedical tourism, often addressed as health tourism, is a new concept in terms of tourism industry in general, and it is also one of the rapidly developing and growing ones.

To fill the gap, this paper focuses on detecting the macroeconomic factors that determine tourism demand in Catalonia. We also analyse the relation between these factors and tourism demand. Despite the strong seasonal component and the outliers in the time series of some countries, overnight stays give a better indication of tourism demand in Catalonia than the number of tourists. The degree of linear association between the macroecon...\n\nMarket Potential Estimation for Tourism in Emerging Markets\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBaimai, Chaiwat\n\n2009-10-01\n\nFull Text Available The objective of this paper was to develop a useful framework for estimating demand for tourism in emerging markets. Tourism has become one of the most crucial sectors in a large number of emerging countries. Moreover, the tourism industry in such markets is forecasted to keep increasing in the next decade. Hence, understanding and accurately forecast demand in the industry is essential in order to manage this sector effectively. Using stepwise regression analysis, we found a number of important variables in estimating demand for tourism in emerging markets. Our regression model can benefit travel agencies and policy makers dealing with the tourism industry.\n\nAre demand forecasting techniques applicable to libraries?\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nSridhar, M. S.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nExamines the nature and limitations of demand forecasting, discuses plausible methods of forecasting demand for information, suggests some useful hints for demand forecasting and concludes by emphasizing unified approach to demand forecasting.\n\nDemand forecast model based on CRM\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCai, Yuancui; Chen, Lichao\n\n2006-11-01\n\nWith interiorizing day by day management thought that regarding customer as the centre, forecasting customer demand becomes more and more important. In the demand forecast of customer relationship management, the traditional forecast methods have very great limitation because much uncertainty of the demand, these all require new modeling to meet the demands of development. In this paper, the notion is that forecasting the demand according to characteristics of the potential customer, then modeling by it. The model first depicts customer adopting uniform multiple indexes. Secondly, the model acquires characteristic customers on the basis of data warehouse and the technology of data mining. The last, there get the most similar characteristic customer by their comparing and forecast the demands of new customer by the most similar characteristic customer.\n\nA Long-run Equilibrium Demand Function: Tourism in Mexico\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBrida, Juan Gabriel; Risso, Wiston AdriÃ n; Carrera, Edgar J.

With the empirical analyze, we study the tourism demand elasticities considering public investment, relative prices of tourist products, and US inc...\n\nThe Variance-covariance Method using IOWGA Operator for Tourism Forecast Combination\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLiangping Wu\n\n2014-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Three combination methods commonly used in tourism forecasting are the simple average method, the variance-covariance method and the discounted MSFE method. These methods assign the different weights that can not change at each time point to each individual forecasting model. In this study, we introduce the IOWGA operator combination method which can overcome the defect of previous three combination methods into tourism forecasting. Moreover, we further investigate the performance of the four combination methods through the theoretical evaluation and the forecasting evaluation. The results of the theoretical evaluation show that the IOWGA operator combination method obtains extremely well performance and outperforms the other forecast combination methods. Furthermore, the IOWGA operator combination method can be of well forecast performance and performs almost the same to the variance-covariance combination method for the forecasting evaluation. The IOWGA operator combination method mainly reflects the maximization of improving forecasting accuracy and the variance-covariance combination method mainly reflects the decrease of the forecast error. For future research, it may be worthwhile introducing and examining other new combination methods that may improve forecasting accuracy or employing other techniques to control the time for updating the weights in combined forecasts.\n\nGone with the wind? The impact of wind turbines on tourism demand\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBroekel, Tom; Alfken, Christoph\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWhile wind energy production is relatively free from environmental externalities such as air pollution, it is frequently considered to negatively impact landscapes' visual aesthetic values, thereby inducing negative effects on tourism demand. Existing evidence for Germany indeed points towards a negative relationship between tourism demand and wind turbine construction. However, the existing studies primarily rely on interview data and simple bivariate statistics. In contrast, we make use of secondary statistics on tourism and wind turbine locations at the level of German municipalities. Using spatial panel regression techniques, we confirm a negative relation between wind turbines around municipalities and tourism demand for municipalities not located near the coast. In the latter regions, the relation between wind turbines and tourism demand is more complex. - Highlights: â¢ Comprehensive quantitative empirical study on wind turbines and tourism demand. â¢ Consideration of wind turbines in vacation municipalities and in their geographic surroundings. â¢ Novel data set on wind turbines and touristic demand in all German municipalities. â¢ Application of spatial panel analysis in the context of tourism research. â¢ Evidence for a negative relationship between wind turbines and tourism demand.\n\nAutomation of energy demand forecasting\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSiddique, Sanzad\n\nAutomation of energy demand forecasting saves time and effort by searching automatically for an appropriate model in a candidate model space without manual intervention. This thesis introduces a search-based approach that improves the performance of the model searching process for econometrics models. Further improvements in the accuracy of the energy demand forecasting are achieved by integrating nonlinear transformations within the models. This thesis introduces machine learning techniques that are capable of modeling such nonlinearity. Algorithms for learning domain knowledge from time series data using the machine learning methods are also presented. The novel search based approach and the machine learning models are tested with synthetic data as well as with natural gas and electricity demand signals. Experimental results show that the model searching technique is capable of finding an appropriate forecasting model. Further experimental results demonstrate an improved forecasting accuracy achieved by using the novel machine learning techniques introduced in this thesis. This thesis presents an analysis of how the machine learning techniques learn domain knowledge. The learned domain knowledge is used to improve the forecast accuracy.\n\nTourism demand in Asean-5 countries: Evidence from panel data analysis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNur Fadzlunnisaa Wakimin\n\n2018-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Tourism has emerged as a major industry worldwide and a sector in many countries. This sector has experienced a rapid growth and has become a key driver for sustainable socioeconomic developments globally. However, tourism is also a vector of environmental degradation through the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the main factors that are affecting the tourism demand in ASEAN-5 countries. Using a panel of five ASEAN countries over a 44-year period and applying the Pooled Mean Group (PMG approach, the empirical results have shown that the major determinants of tourism demand in these countries are income, trade, tourism price, and carbon dioxide emission. The results have also shown that the PMG performed better than the Mean Group (MG estimator. This paper refers to the PMG estimator because it constrains the long run coefficients to be identical, but allows the short run coefficients and error variances to differ across groups. Income and trade appeared to exert significant positive impacts on tourism demand, whereas tourism price and carbon dioxide emissions have negative impacts on tourism demand in these ASEAN-5 countries. The results would be a good reference for policy makers in these specific countries.\n\nGuidelines for forecasting energy demand\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSonino, T.\n\n1976-11-01\n\nFour methodologies for forecasting energy demand are reviewed here after considering the role of energy in the economy and the analysis of energy use in different economic sectors. The special case of Israel is considered throughout, and some forecasts for energy demands in the year 2000 are presented. An energy supply mix that may be considered feasible is proposed.

Considering the scarcity of water and its inherent constraints, demand management and forecasting in this domain are critically important. Several soft computing techniques have been developed over the last few decades for water demand forecasting. This study focuses on soft computing methods of water consumption forecasting published between 2005 and 2015. These methods include artificial neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy models, support vector machines, metaheuristics, and system dynamics. Furthermore, it was discussed that while in short-term forecasting, ANNs have been superior in many cases, but it is still very difficult to pick a single method as the overall best. According to the literature, various methods and their hybrids are applied to water demand forecasting. However, it seems soft computing has a lot more to contribute to water demand forecasting. These contribution areas include, but are not limited, to various ANN architectures, unsupervised methods, deep learning, various metaheuristics, and ensemble methods. Moreover, it is found that soft computing methods are mainly used for short-term demand forecasting.\n\nIntermittent demand : Linking forecasting to inventory obsolescence\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nTeunter, Ruud H.; Syntetos, Aris A.; Babai, M.

This task, which often is assumed by financial managers, first requires the compilation and examination of historical information. Although many quantitative forecasting methods exist, four common methods of forecasting are percent adjustment, 12-month moving average, trendline, and seasonalized forecast. These four methods are all based upon the organization's recent historical demand. Healthcare financial managers who want to project demand for healthcare services in their facility should understand the advantages and disadvantages of each method and then select the method that will best meet the organization's needs.\n\nUnited Kingdom and United States Tourism Demand for Malaysia:A Cointegration Analysis\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nHabibi, Fateh; Abdul Rahim, Khalid; Chin, Lee\n\n2008-01-01\n\nTourism industry has been an important contributor to the Malaysia economy. In this paper we inspect variations in the long run demand for tourism from United Kingdom and United States to Malaysia. The demand for tourism has been explained by macroeconomic variables, including income in origin countries, tourism prices in Malaysia, and travel cost between the two countries. Annual data from 1972 to 2006 are used for the analysis. Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Johansenâs maximum likelihood tests...\n\nEx-post evaluations of demand forecast accuracy\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nNicolaisen, Morten Skou; Driscoll, Patrick Arthur\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTravel demand forecasts play a crucial role in the preparation of decision support to policy makers in the field of transport planning. The results feed directly into impact appraisals such as cost benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments, which are mandatory for large public works...... projects in many countries. Over the last couple of decades there has been an increasing attention to the lack of demand forecast accuracy, but since data availability for comprehensive ex- post appraisals is problematic, such studies are still relatively rare. The present paper presents a review...... of the largest ex-post studies of demand forecast accuracy for transport infrastructure projects. The focus is twofold; to provide an overview of observed levels of demand forecast inaccuracy and to explore the primary explanations offered for the observed inaccuracy. Inaccuracy in the form of both bias...\n\nForecasting telecommunication new service demand by analogy method and combined forecast\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLin Feng-Jenq\n\n2005-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In the modeling forecast field, we are usually faced with the more difficult problems of forecasting market demand for a new service or product. A new service or product is defined as that there is absence of historical data in this new market. We hardly use models to execute the forecasting work directly. In the Taiwan telecommunication industry, after liberalization in 1996, there are many new services opened continually. For optimal investment, it is necessary that the operators, who have been granted the concessions and licenses, forecast this new service within their planning process. Though there are some methods to solve or avoid this predicament, in this paper, we will propose one forecasting procedure that integrates the concept of analogy method and the idea of combined forecast to generate new service forecast. In view of the above, the first half of this paper describes the procedure of analogy method and the approach of combined forecast, and the second half provides the case of forecasting low-tier phone demand in Taiwan to illustrate this procedure's feasibility.\n\nClimate services in the tourism sector - examples and market research\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDamm, Andrea; KÃ¶berl, Judith; Prettenthaler, Franz; Kortschak, Dominik; Hofer, Marianne; Winkler, Claudia\n\n2017-04-01\n\nTourism is one of the most weather-sensitive sectors. Hence, dealing with weather and climate risks is an important part of operational risk management. WEDDAÂ® (WEather Driven Demand Analysis), developed by Joanneum Research, represents a comprehensive and flexible toolbox for managing weather and climate risks. Modelling the demand for products or services of a particular economic sector or company and its weather and climate sensitivity usually forms the starting and central point of WEDDAÂ®. Coupling the calibrated demand models to either long-term climate scenarios or short-term weather forecasts enables the use of WEDDAÂ® for the following areas of application: (i) implementing short-term forecasting systems for the prediction of the considered indicator; (ii) quantifying the weather risk of a particular economic sector or company using parameters from finance (e.g. Value-at-Risk); (iii) assessing the potential impacts of changing climatic conditions on a particular economic sector or company. WEDDAÂ® for short-term forecasts on the demand for products or services is currently used by various tourism businesses, such as open-air swimming pools, ski areas, and restaurants. It supports tourism and recreation facilities to better cope with (increasing) weather variability by optimizing the disposability of staff, resources and merchandise according to expected demand. Since coping with increasing weather variability forms one of the challenges with respect to climate change, WEDDAÂ® may become an important component within a whole pool of weather and climate services designed to support tourism and recreation facilities to adapt to climate change. Climate change impact assessments at European scale, as conducted in the EU-FP7 project IMPACT2C, provide basic information of climate change impacts on tourism demand not only for individual tourism businesses, but also for regional and national tourism planners and policy makers interested in benchmarks for the\n\nTourism Demand and Agriculture Supply: Basis for Agritourism Development in Quezon Province\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNichole Ann A. Lago\n\n2017-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Establishing the tourism and agriculture linkage is a vital factor for the promotion of agri - tourism. This study aimed to determine the tourism and agriculture factors in Quezon province . Specifically, to present the profile of tourists and farmers; determine the supply and demand â related factors influencing the linkage between tourism and agriculture; test the significant difference in the responses of tourists and farmers in terms of su pply and demand related factors; test the significant differences on the supply and demand related factors when grouped according to profile; test the significant relationship between touristsâ motivation and preferences and propose an action plan for agri - tourism development in Quezon. This study used descriptive design with farmers and tourist as respondents. Self - made questionnaire was utilized as data gathering instrument. Percentage, frequency distribution, weighted mean, T - Test, ANOVA and Pearson - r co rrelation were the statistical tools used. Based on the result, it was revealed that tourism and agriculture linkages in Quezon province were relatively strong. Educational attainment of farmers is an important factor for agriculture supply, civil status a nd income were found to be the major indicators of tourist demands while safety and security becomes the major consideration of tourists to visit agritourism sites. It is recommended that there is a need to educat e farmers in order to encourage diversifica tion of farms into agri - tourism wherein market segmentation is vital for agri - tourism promotion while fostering a community - based agri - tourism in Quezon province is likewise highly recommende\n\nTourism and water use: Supply, demand, and security.

The Case of Portugal\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNuno Carlos LEITÃO\n\n2010-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The tourism industry has expanded in recent years due to internal and external environmental forces. These forces, income, trade, consumer price, and geographical distance are interconnected. Accounting for imperfect competition and increasing returns to scale, the new trade theory offers the explanation of dynamic gains from international trade. A large number of studies attempt to test the hypothesis that there is a link between trade and tourism. Most of the studies show that trade and tourism are positively correlated. This paper specifies static and dynamic panel demand models for tourism in Portugal and estimates demand equations using tourist inflow data for the period 1995-2006. We find that bilateral trade, immigration, border, and geographical distance between Portugal and countries of origin are the main determinants of tourism to Portugal. The dynamic panel data approach indicates that trade, population, and income are more important determinants than relative price.\n\nDomestic and outbound tourism demand in Australia: a System-of-Equations Approach\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nGeorge Athanasopoulos; Minfeng Deng; Gang Li; Haiyan Song\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis study uses a system-of-equations approach to model the substitution relationship between Australian domestic and outbound tourism demand. A new price variable based on relative ratios of purchasing power parity index is developed for the substitution analysis. Short-run demand elasticities are calculated based on the estimated dynamic almost ideal demand system. The empirical results reveal significant substitution relationships between Australian domestic tourism and outbound travel to ...\n\nOntario demand forecast from January 2004 to December 2013\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThis document examined the demand forecast for electricity on the Independent Market Operator (IMO)-controlled grid in Ontario for the period 2004-2013. It serves as an assessment tool to determine whether existing and proposed generation and transmission facilities in the province will be sufficient to meet future electricity needs. Changes in methodology have been made to allow for an hourly peak versus the previously reported 20-minute peak value. Actual data through to the end of October 2002 was used to re-estimate energy demand. Compared to other developed countries, the outlook for the Canadian economy is optimistic. In addition, the economic forecast is better than that which formed the basis of the last ten-year forecast. Energy demand in the median growth scenario is increasing at an annual rate of 1.1 per cent rather than 0.9 per cent for the forecasted period of 2003-2012. The combination of a higher growth rate and a higher starting point results in a 2010 forecast of 168 TWh. It is expected that peak demand will grow faster than in the previous forecast. Summer peak demand averaging an annual growth of 1.3 per cent is forecasted for the period 2003-2012, with winter peak demand averaging a growth of 0.8 per cent. Under normal weather conditions, the electricity system is expected to peak in the summer of 2005 due to the continued demand for cooling load. However, under an extreme weather scenario, the system is already summer peaking. The improved economic outlook and higher starting point resulted in a higher forecast for energy. The electricity system is expected to winter peak during the first years of the forecasted period. The heating load is not expected to experience rapid growth in the next few years. 15 tabs., 14 figs\n\nMeasuring inaccuracy in travel demand forecasting\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nFlyvbjerg, Bent\n\n2005-01-01\n\nas the basis for measurement.

The main purpose of tourists visiting Smart Park is to obtain an educational tourism experience. This subjective experience raises specific challenges for Smart Park as it works towards being a competitive destination. The purpose of this study is to analyze the aspects of the educational tourism experience that are affected by tourism demand and supply. Data were collected from surveys that were sent to 150 respondents and were analyzed using path analysis. The results show that tourism demand and supply contributed to the variation of tourism activities by 45.1%, while the remaining was explained by other variables, such as national budget, local budget, ticket sale, and cooperation with some stakeholders. Tourism supply had a higher effect than tourism demand. Tourism demand did not particularly affect tourism experience. However, the results of the path analysis indicate that tourism supply had direct and indirect effects on tourism experience through the variation of tourism activities, with the indirect effect being the most predominant. In the management of Smart Park, there is still a gap between tourism demand and supply, so the tourism experience has not been maximized to its full potential.\n\nForecasting urban water demand: A meta-regression analysis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSebri, Maamar\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWater managers and planners require accurate water demand forecasts over the short-, medium- and long-term for many purposes. These range from assessing water supply needs over spatial and temporal patterns to optimizing future investments and planning future allocations across competing sectors. This study surveys the empirical literature on the urban water demand forecasting using the meta-analytical approach. Specifically, using more than 600 estimates, a meta-regression analysis is conducted to identify explanations of cross-studies variation in accuracy of urban water demand forecasting. Our study finds that accuracy depends significantly on study characteristics, including demand periodicity, modeling method, forecasting horizon, model specification and sample size. The meta-regression results remain robust to different estimators employed as well as to a series of sensitivity checks performed. The importance of these findings lies in the conclusions and implications drawn out for regulators and policymakers and for academics alike. Copyright Â© 2016.

MilojeviÄ\n\n2012-01-01\n\nhypothesis of the existence of phenomenon change trends, the next step in the methodology of forecasting is the determination of a specific growth curve that describes the regularity of the development in time. These curves of growth are obtained by the analytical representation (expression of dynamic lines. There are two basic stages in the process of expression and they are: - The choice of the type of curve the shape of which corresponds to the character of the dynamic order variation - the determination of the number of values (evaluation of the curve parameters. The most widespread method of forecasting is the trend extrapolation. The basis of the trend extrapolation is the continuing of past trends in the future. The simplicity of the trend extrapolation process, on the one hand, and the absence of other information on the other hand, are the main reasons why the trend extrapolation is used for forecasting. The trend extrapolation is founded on the following assumptions: - The phenomenon development can be presented as an evolutionary trajectory or trend, - General conditions that influenced the trend development in the past will not undergo substantial changes in the future. Spare parts demand forecasting is constantly being done in all warehouses, workshops, and at all levels. Without demand forecasting, neither planning nor decision making can be done. Demand forecasting is the input for determining the level of reserve, size of the order, ordering cycles, etc. The question that arises is the one of the reliability and accuracy of a forecast and its effects. Forecasting 'by feeling' is not to be dismissed if there is nothing better, but in this case, one must be prepared for forecasting failures that cause unnecessary accumulation of certain spare parts, and also a chronic shortage of other spare parts. All this significantly increases costs and does not provide a satisfactory supply of spare parts. The main problem of the application of this model is that each\n\nForecasting monthly peak demand of electricity in IndiaâA critique\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRallapalli, Srinivasa Rao; Ghosh, Sajal\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe nature of electricity differs from that of other commodities since electricity is a non-storable good and there have been significant seasonal and diurnal variations of demand. Under such condition, precise forecasting of demand for electricity should be an integral part of the planning process as this enables the policy makers to provide directions on cost-effective investment and on scheduling the operation of the existing and new power plants so that the supply of electricity can be made adequate enough to meet the future demand and its variations. Official load forecasting in India done by Central Electricity Authority (CEA) is often criticized for being overestimated due to inferior techniques used for forecasting. This paper tries to evaluate monthly peak demand forecasting performance predicted by CEA using trend method and compare it with those predicted by Multiplicative Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (MSARIMA) model. It has been found that MSARIMA model outperforms CEA forecasts both in-sample static and out-of-sample dynamic forecast horizons in all five regional grids in India. For better load management and grid discipline, this study suggests employing sophisticated techniques like MSARIMA for peak load forecasting in India. - Highlights: âº This paper evaluates monthly peak demand forecasting performance by CEA. âº Compares CEA forecasts it with those predicted by MSARIMA model. âº MSARIMA model outperforms CEA forecasts in all five regional grids in India. âº Opportunity exists to improve the performance of CEA forecasts.\n\nState-level electricity demand forecasting model.

The electric power demand is usually a non-linear problem due to various unknown reasons, which make it difficult to get accurate prediction by traditional methods. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel hybrid forecasting method for managing and scheduling the electricity power. EEMD-SCGRNN-PSVR, the proposed new method, combines ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD, seasonal adjustment (S, cross validation (C, general regression neural network (GRNN and support vector regression machine optimized by the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSVR. The main idea of EEMD-SCGRNN-PSVR is respectively to forecast waveform and trend component that hidden in demand series to substitute directly forecasting original electric demand. EEMD-SCGRNN-PSVR is used to predict the one week ahead half-hourâs electricity demand in two data sets (New South Wales (NSW and Victorian State (VIC in Australia. Experimental results show that the new hybrid model outperforms the other three models in terms of forecasting accuracy and model robustness.\n\nDeMand: A tool for evaluating and comparing device-level demand and supply forecast models\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nNeupane, Bijay; Siksnys, Laurynas; Pedersen, Torben Bach\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFine-grained device-level predictions of both shiftable and non-shiftable energy demand and supply is vital in order to take advantage of Demand Response (DR) for efficient utilization of Renewable Energy Sources.

The additional variability associated with weather-dependent renewable energy creates new challenges for power system operators that must maintain and operate ancillary services to balance the grid. To deal with these issues power operators mostly rely on demand load forecasts. Electric load forecast has been used in power industry for a long time and there are several well established load forecasting models. But the performance of these models for future scenario of high renewable energy penetration is unclear. In this work, the impact of onsite solar power generation on the demand load forecast is analyzed for a community that meets between 10% and 15% of its annual power demand and 3â54% of its daily power demand from a solar power plant. Short-Term Load Forecasts (STLF) using persistence, machine learning and regression-based forecasting models are presented for two cases: (1) high solar penetration and (2) no penetration. Results show that for 1-h and 15-min forecasts the accuracy of the models drops by 9% and 3% with high solar penetration. Statistical analysis of the forecast errors demonstrate that the error distribution is best characterized as a t-distribution for the high penetration scenario. Analysis of the error distribution as a function of daily solar penetration for different levels of variability revealed that the solar power variability drives the forecast error magnitude whereas increasing penetration level has a much smaller contribution. This work concludes that the demand forecast error distribution\n\nImpacts of +2 Â°C global warming on winter tourism demand in Europe\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nDamm, Andrea; Greuell, Wouter; Landgren, Oskar; Prettenthaler, Franz\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIncreasing temperatures and snow scarce winter seasons challenge the winter tourism industry.

Tourism demand for the Romanian mountain destinations in the last two decades has been analyzed in quantity and evolution, by processing (also graphically and interpreting the specific tourism indicators (tourist arrivals, tourist structure, touristsâ preference for accommodation, overnight stays, average length of stay, accommodation occupancy rate, also making comparisons with the situation at national level. Mountain tourism demand is an important segment of tourism demand (domestic and international in Romania, with shares between 13.19% (minimum in 1994 and 15.63% (maximum in 2013. The mountain area is ranked second most popular for the Romanian tourists and third place for the foreign tourists. Tourist arrivals in the mountain area recorded the following variations: a period of sharp decline (1994-2002 with a minimum in 2002 (700,000 tourists, a period of growth (2003-2008 with values around 1 million tourists in 2007 and 2008, a decrease of 100,000 tourists corresponding to the economic crisis in 2008-2009, followed by a period (2010-2014 of strong revival with the maximum value of the entire analyzed period (nearly 1,3 million tourists in 2014. The fluctuations of overnight stays were directly proportional to those of arrivals. The increasing demand for mountain destinations resulted from a better promotion of winter sports in recent years, a revival (\"fashion\" of Romaniansâ preferences for winter sports practicing; in parallel, a number of ski areas were arranged or redesigned in many traditional 'white' resorts, and several smaller centers for winter sports emerged or were re-launched.

The tendency of policy makers pay more attention to aspects of supply than demand aspect will lead to the development of tourist products and services do not get good results. This research examined the relationship between marine tourism demand, characteristics and number of visits to the level of perception and willingness to pay (WTP) for a tourists on a marine tourism destination in Ambon city. Respondents come from overseas tourists, domestic and local, amounting to 140 people. The analysis was performed descriptively and further using SEM analysis Amos 19.00 with path analysis. The analysis shows the close relationship between marine tourism demand variables, characteristics, and the number of tourist visits to the perception of value and WTP for tourists. Variable marine tourism demand when connected directly to the tourists perception and WTP tends to correlate negatively than when using a variable as a variable number of tourist visits as a intervening variables. Instead tourists characteristic variables are positively correlated directly or indirectly with the perception of value and WTP for tourists. It is hoped that with this study will motivate tourism policy makers and local communities to be concerned and studied aspects of perception, WTP, marine tourism demand, the number of tourist visits and the characteristics that turned out to be related to each other.\n\nForecasting residential electricity demand in provincial China.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLiao, Hua; Liu, Yanan; Gao, Yixuan; Hao, Yu; Ma, Xiao-Wei; Wang, Kan\n\n2017-03-01\n\nIn China, more than 80% electricity comes from coal which dominates the CO2 emissions. Residential electricity demand forecasting plays a significant role in electricity infrastructure planning and energy policy designing, but it is challenging to make an accurate forecast for developing countries. This paper forecasts the provincial residential electricity consumption of China in the 13th Five-Year-Plan (2016-2020) period using panel data. To overcome the limitations of widely used predication models with unreliably prior knowledge on function forms, a robust piecewise linear model in reduced form is utilized to capture the non-deterministic relationship between income and residential electricity consumption. The forecast results suggest that the growth rates of developed provinces will slow down, while the less developed will be still in fast growing. The national residential electricity demand will increase at 6.6% annually during 2016-2020, and populous provinces such as Guangdong will be the main contributors to the increments.\n\nDemand Forecasting in the Fashion Industry: A Review\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaria Elena Nenni\n\n2013-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Forecasting demand is a crucial issue for driving efficient operations management plans.

However, global carbon emissions related to tourism are currently not well quantified. Here, we quantify tourism-related global carbon flows between 160 countries, and their carbon footprints under origin and destination accounting perspectives. We find that, between 2009 and 2013, tourism's global carbon footprint has increased from 3.9 to 4.5 GtCO2e, four times more than previously estimated, accounting for about 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Transport, shopping and food are significant contributors. The majority of this footprint is exerted by and in high-income countries. The rapid increase in tourism demand is effectively outstripping the decarbonization of tourism-related technology. We project that, due to its high carbon intensity and continuing growth, tourism will constitute a growing part of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTypes of Forecast and Weather-Related Information Used among Tourism Businesses in Coastal North Carolina\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAyscue, Emily P.\n\nThis study profiles the coastal tourism sector, a large and diverse consumer of climate and weather information. It is crucial to provide reliable, accurate and relevant resources for the climate and weather-sensitive portions of this stakeholder group in order to guide them in capitalizing on current climate and weather conditions and to prepare them for potential changes. An online survey of tourism business owners, managers and support specialists was conducted within the eight North Carolina oceanfront counties asking respondents about forecasts they use and for what purposes as well as why certain forecasts are not used. Respondents were also asked about their perceived dependency of their business on climate and weather as well as how valuable different forecasts are to their decision-making. Business types represented include: Agriculture, Outdoor Recreation, Accommodations, Food Services, Parks and Heritage, and Other. Weekly forecasts were the most popular forecasts with Monthly and Seasonal being the least used. MANOVA and ANOVA analyses revealed outdoor-oriented businesses (Agriculture and Outdoor Recreation) as perceiving themselves significantly more dependent on climate and weather than indoor-oriented ones (Food Services and Accommodations). Outdoor businesses also valued short-range forecasts significantly more than indoor businesses. This suggests a positive relationship between perceived climate and weather dependency and forecast value. The low perceived dependency and value of short-range forecasts of indoor businesses presents an opportunity to create climate and weather information resources directed at how they can capitalize on positive climate and weather forecasts and how to counter negative effects with forecasted adverse conditions. The low use of long-range forecasts among all business types can be related to the low value placed on these forecasts. However, these forecasts are still important in that they are used to make more\n\nAn Integrated Modeling Approach for Forecasting Long-Term Energy Demand in Pakistan\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSyed Aziz Ur Rehman\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Energy planning and policy development require an in-depth assessment of energy resources and long-term demand forecast estimates. Pakistan, unfortunately, lacks reliable data on its energy resources as well do not have dependable long-term energy demand forecasts. As a result, the policy makers could not come up with an effective energy policy in the history of the country. Energy demand forecast has attained greatest ever attention in the perspective of growing population and diminishing fossil fuel resources. In this study, Pakistanâs energy demand forecast for electricity, natural gas, oil, coal and LPG across all the sectors of the economy have been undertaken. Three different energy demand forecasting methodologies, i.e., Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA, Holt-Winter and Long-range Energy Alternate Planning (LEAP model were used. The demand forecast estimates of each of these methods were compared using annual energy demand data. The results of this study suggest that ARIMA is more appropriate for energy demand forecasting for Pakistan compared to Holt-Winter model and LEAP model. It is estimated that industrial sectorâs demand shall be highest in the year 2035 followed by transport and domestic sectors. The results further suggest that energy fuel mix will change considerably, such that oil will be the most highly consumed energy form (38.16% followed by natural gas (36.57%, electricity (16.22%, coal (7.52% and LPG (1.52% in 2035. In view of higher demand forecast of fossil fuels consumption, this study recommends that government should take the initiative for harnessing renewable energy resources for meeting future energy demand to not only avert huge import bill but also achieving energy security and sustainability in the long run.\n\nUsing imperfect advance demand information in forecasting\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nTan, T.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we consider the demand-forecasting problem of a make-to-stock system operating in a business-to-business environment where some customers provide information on their future orders, which are subject to changes in time, hence constituting imperfect advance demand information (ADI).\n\nForecasting Hourly Water Demands With Seasonal Autoregressive Models for Real-Time Application\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChen, Jinduan; Boccelli, Dominic L.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nConsumer water demands are not typically measured at temporal or spatial scales adequate to support real-time decision making, and recent approaches for estimating unobserved demands using observed hydraulic measurements are generally not capable of forecasting demands and uncertainty information. While time series modeling has shown promise for representing total system demands, these models have generally not been evaluated at spatial scales appropriate for representative real-time modeling. This study investigates the use of a double-seasonal time series model to capture daily and weekly autocorrelations to both total system demands and regional aggregated demands at a scale that would capture demand variability across a distribution system. Emphasis was placed on the ability to forecast demands and quantify uncertainties with results compared to traditional time series pattern-based demand models as well as nonseasonal and single-seasonal time series models. Additional research included the implementation of an adaptive-parameter estimation scheme to update the time series model when unobserved changes occurred in the system. For two case studies, results showed that (1) for the smaller-scale aggregated water demands, the log-transformed time series model resulted in improved forecasts, (2) the double-seasonal model outperformed other models in terms of forecasting errors, and (3) the adaptive adjustment of parameters during forecasting improved the accuracy of the generated prediction intervals. These results illustrate the capabilities of time series modeling to forecast both water demands and uncertainty estimates at spatial scales commensurate for real-time modeling applications and provide a foundation for developing a real-time integrated demand-hydraulic model.\n\nWorldwide satellite market demand forecast\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBowyer, J. M.; Frankfort, M.; Steinnagel, K. M.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe forecast is for the years 1981 - 2000 with benchmark years at 1985, 1990 and 2000. Two typs of markets are considered for this study: Hardware (worldwide total) - satellites, earth stations and control facilities (includes replacements and spares); and non-hardware (addressable by U.S. industry) - planning, launch, turnkey systems and operations. These markets were examined for the INTELSAT System (international systems and domestic and regional systems using leased transponders) and domestic and regional systems. Forecasts were determined for six worldwide regions encompassing 185 countries using actual costs for existing equipment and engineering estimates of costs for advanced systems. Most likely (conservative growth rate estimates) and optimistic (mid range growth rate estimates) scenarios were employed for arriving at the forecasts which are presented in constant 1980 U.S. dollars. The worldwide satellite market demand forecast predicts that the market between 181 and 2000 will range from $35 to $50 billion. Approximately one-half of the world market, $16 to $20 billion, will be generated in the United States.\n\nNatural gas demand forecast system based on the application of artificial neural networks\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSanfeliu, J.M.; Doumanian, J.E.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nGas Natural BAN, as a distribution gas company since 1993 in the north and west area of Buenos Aires Argentina, with 1,000,000 customers, had to develop a gas demand forecast system which should comply with the following basic requirements: Be able to do reliable forecasts with short historical information (2 years); Distinguish demands in areas of different characteristics, i.e. mainly residential, mainly industrial; Self-learning capability. To accomplish above goals, Gas Natural BAN chose in view of its own necessities, an artificial intelligence application (neural networks). 'SANDRA', the gas demand forecast system for gas distribution used by Gas Natural BAN, has the following features: Daily gas demand forecast, Hourly gas demand forecast and Breakdown of both forecast for each of the 3 basic zones in which the distribution area of Gas Natural BAN is divided.

We calculate age- and sex-specific donation and demand rates for blood supply based on 2008 data and project demand between 2008 and 2036 based on these rates and using population data from the Ontario Ministry of Finance. Results indicate that blood demand will outpace supply as early as 2012. For instance, while the total number of donations made by older cohorts is expected to increase in the coming years, the number of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in the 70+ age group is forecasted grow from approximately 53% of all RBC transfusions in 2008 (209,515) in 2008 to 68% (546,996) by 2036. A series of alternate scenarios, including projections based on a 2% increase in supply per year and increased use of apheresis technology, delays supply shortfalls, but does not eliminate them without active management and/or multiple methods to increase supply and decrease demand. Predictions show that demand for blood products will outpace supply in the near future given current age- and sex-specific supply and demand rates. However, we note that the careful management of the blood supply by Canadian Blood Services, along with new medical techniques and the recruitment of new donors to the system, will remove future concerns.

During the process of doing research on forecasts of energy demand structure in Japan, documents published from organizations in inside and outside of Japan were collected. These documents include prospects of economic growth rate, forecasts of amount for energy supply and demand, the maximum amount of introducing new energy resources, CO2 regulation, and evaluation of energy best mixture. Organizations in Japan such as Economic Council and Japan Energy Economic Research Institute have provided long-term forecasts until the early 21st century. Meanwhile, organizations overseas have provided forecasts of economic structure, and demand and supply for energy in OECD and East Asia including Japan. In connection with forecasts of electricity generation cost in each power plant, views on the ultimate reserves and cost of resources are reviewed in this report. According to some views on oil reserves, making assumptions based on reserves/production ratio, the maximum length of the time that oil reserves will last is 150 years. In addition, this report provides summaries of cost and potential role of various resources, including solar energy and wind energy; and views on waste, safety, energy security-related externality cost, and the price of transferring CO2 emission right.

Final energy demand forecasts are based on the assumption that the economic transformation in Poland will gradually lead the Polish economy, technologies and modes of energy use, to the same conditions as mature market economy countries. The starting point has a significant influence on the future energy demand and supply structure: final energy consumption per capita in 1992 was almost half the average of OECD countries; energy intensity, based on Purchasing Power Parities (PPP) and referred to GDP, is more than 3 times higher in Poland. A method of final energy demand forecasting based on regression analysis is described in this paper.

The goal of the paper is to calculate the demand for IS specialists (DfISS. To achieve it we used the informal heuristic methods and introduced some important indicators for DfISP forecast. As a validation of the conceptual approach proposed we show how to apply it on the regional level of one country on one real-world example. All the reasoning and calculations can be narrowed down to the DfISS forecasting within one corporation or IS professionals of a specific profile.\n\nCase study of forecasting uranium supply and demand\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNoritake, Kazumitsu\n\n1992-01-01\n\nPNC collects and analyzes information about uranium market trend, world uranium supply and demand, and world uranium resources potential in order to establish the strategy of uranium exploration. This paper outlines the results obtained to forecast uranium supply and demand. Our forecast indicates that 8,500 tU, accounting for one-sixth of the demand in the year 2001, must be met by uranium produced by mines to be newly developed. After 2019, demand cannot be met by the 123 mines currently in operation or expected to have gone into production by this year. The projected shortage must therefore be covered by uranium to be newly discovered. To preclude this occurrence, uranium exploration will have to be steadily continued in order to ensure future new uranium resources, to alleviate anxiety about future supply, and to prevent sharp price hikes.

The supply sideâs evaluation of the regional supply capacity determines the direction of the supply investment in future, the demand sideâs evaluation indicates their satisfaction degree of the destination supply and also effects their revisit the tourism destination. Therefore, the assessment of the supply and demand sides is an important reference for the reform of destination supply side, which helps us find the shortage of the destination supply factors and optimize tourism destination supply promptly. This paper through investigating tourism supply and demand groups in Shanghai, used the survey data and constructed tourism supply optimization model, analyzed the current situation of tourism supply factors in Shanghai. Results showed that the environment of Shanghai should be improved first, including improving urban air and water quality, up-grading public sanitation and increasing urban green coverage. Other supply factors improved priority were information and marketing, we should improve the information consultation of scenic spots, increase the intensity of tourism promotion and provide more free travel publicity brochures.\n\nPrediction of Tourism Demand in Iran by Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN and Supporting Vector Machine (SVR\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSeyedehelham Sadatiseyedmahalleh\n\n2016-02-01\n\nFull Text Available This research examines and proves this effectiveness connected with artificial neural networks (ANNs as an alternative approach to the use of Support Vector Machine (SVR in the tourism research. This method can be used for the tourism industry to define the turismâs demands in Iran.

A.; Samsudin, R.; Shabri, A.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nIn this study, a hybrid model using modified Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) model is proposed for tourism forecasting. This approach reconstructs intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) produced by EMD using trial and error method. The new component and the remaining IMFs is then predicted respectively using GMDH model. Finally, the forecasted results for each component are aggregated to construct an ensemble forecast. The data used in this experiment are monthly time series data of tourist arrivals from China, Thailand and India to Malaysia from year 2000 to 2016. The performance of the model is evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) where conventional GMDH model and EMD-GMDH model are used as benchmark models. Empirical results proved that the proposed model performed better forecasts than the benchmarked models.\n\nDemand forecast: a case study at a meat agribusiness in west Santa Catarina\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCleunice Zanella\n\n2016-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Based on demand forecasts, companies plan production, financial and personnel scenarios, both in the long and short term. The forecasts are essential, especially for companies working with a push production system, for which there is no sale of collateral. They should therefore plan their production and financial systems with the aim of meeting the demand forecast of their products or services. Thus, this study was conducted at a meat agribusiness located in ChapecÃ³, in the state of Santa Catarina, in order to analyze the demand forecasting methods used by the company. It is a case study with a qualitative approach. Data collection was conducted through semi-structured interviews with the operations manager, commercial manager and analysts who respond to the demand forecasts made.

QMMP+ is based on the decomposition of the quantitative and qualitative information of the time-series. The quantitative component (i.e., the daily consumption prediction is forecasted and the pattern mode estimated using a Nearest Neighbor (NN classifier and a Calendar. The patterns are updated via a simple Moving Average scheme. The NN classifier and the Calendar are executed simultaneously every period and the most suited model for prediction is selected using a probabilistic approach. The proposed solution for water demand forecast is compared against Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Networks (RBF-ANN, the statistical Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA, and Double Seasonal Holt-Winters (DSHW approaches, providing the best results when applied to real demand of the Barcelona Water Distribution Network. QMMP+ has demonstrated that the special modelling treatment of water consumption patterns improves the forecasting accuracy.\n\nA Review of Demand Forecast for Charging Facilities of Electric Vehicles\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJiming, Han; Lingyu, Kong; Yaqi, Shen; Ying, Li; Wenting, Xiong; Hao, Wang\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe demand forecasting of charging facilities is the basis of its planning and locating, which has important role in promoting the development of electric vehicles and alleviating the energy crisis.

However, the importance of demand side energy management, including individual load forecasting, is becoming critical. In this paper, we propose deep neural network (DNN-based load forecasting models and apply them to a demand side empirical load database. DNNs are trained in two different ways: a pre-training restricted Boltzmann machine and using the rectified linear unit without pre-training. DNN forecasting models are trained by individual customerâs electricity consumption data and regional meteorological elements. To verify the performance of DNNs, forecasting results are compared with a shallow neural network (SNN, a double seasonal HoltâWinters (DSHW model and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE and relative root mean square error (RRMSE are used for verification. Our results show that DNNs exhibit accurate and robust predictions compared to other forecasting models, e.g., MAPE and RRMSE are reduced by up to 17% and 22% compared to SNN and 9% and 29% compared to DSHW.\n\nA multivariate time series approach to modeling and forecasting demand in the emergency department.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJones, Spencer S; Evans, R Scott; Allen, Todd L; Thomas, Alun; Haug, Peter J; Welch, Shari J; Snow, Gregory L\n\n2009-02-01\n\nThe goals of this investigation were to study the temporal relationships between the demands for key resources in the emergency department (ED) and the inpatient hospital, and to develop multivariate forecasting models. Hourly data were collected from three diverse hospitals for the year 2006. Descriptive analysis and model fitting were carried out using graphical and multivariate time series methods. Multivariate models were compared to a univariate benchmark model in terms of their ability to provide out-of-sample forecasts of ED census and the demands for diagnostic resources. Descriptive analyses revealed little temporal interaction between the demand for inpatient resources and the demand for ED resources at the facilities considered. Multivariate models provided more accurate forecasts of ED census and of the demands for diagnostic resources. Our results suggest that multivariate time series models can be used to reliably forecast ED patient census; however, forecasts of the demands for diagnostic resources were not sufficiently reliable to be useful in the clinical setting.\n\nThe energy markets to 1995 - sector demand forecasts and summary. [United Kingdom\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBuckley, J\n\n1983-01-01\n\nEnergy demand forecasts are often based on assumptions which are uncertain and dependent upon both political and economic factors. However, there is a need for long-term energy forecasting for the benefit of industry and commerce. CIRS (Cambridge Information and Research Services Limited) have tried to fulfill this need, based on forecasts of useful heat demand sector by sector which are then converted to heat energy supply and primary requirements. The first such forecast was produced in 1975. This 1983 updated projection examines coal, oil and gas supplies in the UK to the year 1995.\n\nUsing Adaptive Neural-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS for Demand Forecasting and an Application\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nOnur DoÄan\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Due to the rapid increase in global competition among organizations and companies, rational approaches in decision making have become indispensable for organizations in todayâs world.
