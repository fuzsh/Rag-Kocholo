        "text": "The final day at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao was filled with tension as the Medal Races decided the podium places, Rio 2016 Olympic qualification spots and Abu Dhabi World Cup Final positions.\n\nAlongside this, sailors in the top three in each fleet receive a share of the 150,000 Euro prize fund.\n\nLight wind and strong current has been a regularity throughout the week with those reading the conditions to full effect reaping the rewards. A 5-7 south eastern breeze made for a tense finale with sailors aiming to leave nothing on the water.\n\nChinese sailors dominated the day taking gold in the Men’s 470, Finn, Laser Radial and the Men’s and Women’s RS:X. Meanwhile, Singapore’s Justin Liu and Denise Lim in the Nacra 17, Laser sailor Lorenzo Chiavarini (GBR) and Japan’s Women’s 470 team took the spoils in their fleets.\n\nNacra 17\n\nSingapore’s Justin Liu and Denise Lim stylishly wrapped up gold in the Nacra 17 with a Medal Race victory. It was their tenth race win of the week and with gold, they have qualified Singapore for a Rio 2016 Nacra 17 spot.\n\nThe pair revelled in Qingdao’s light air and with conditions in the Medal Race similar to the days prior, the odds were in their favour. Liu and Lim worked their way through the fleet during the Medal Race and finished 51 seconds clear of Japan’s Hiroki Goto and Wakako Tabata.\n\nThroughout the week the Singaporeans remained coy about their chances, not taking anything for granted. When they crossed the finish there was visible sense of a relief that was quickly overtaken by joy as they let the celebrations commence.\n\n“It’s amazing,” said Liu through a beaming smile. “There were so many challenges to make it here and to try and qualify the country. To be able to do it is amazing. It’ll be our first Olympics so there is so much to look forward to.”\n\nLim added, “We sailed the conditions quite well, and with our coaches help, he helped us a lot with the current and the wind changes and I think that gave us an advantage over the rest.”\n\nWhilst the Singaporeans can look forward, the teams from China, Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand were understandably disappointed. A world cup silver and bronze for Zijin Wen and Rubei Yuan (CHN) and Tat Choi Fung and Yu Ting Chan (HKG) were mere consolation with Olympic dreams filling their head in advance of the competition.\n\nJapan’s Goto and Tabata had beaten their main rivals in several key regattas building up to Qingdao but the big breeze that they excel in failed to kick in in Qingdao as they finished fifth overall.\n\nNonetheless, Goto remained complimentary to the Singaporeans and has an eye on the future, “I have to take my hat off to the Singapore team. It was light wind and they totally dominated. They sailed the wind so well.\n\n“My aim was to inspire the next generation of Nacra sailors, and the next Olympic Sailing [Competition] will be in my home town of Enoshima. I will be there, hopefully as a coach because I have young people asking me to help them, so this is good. I’m not happy now but we have to look to the future for everyone.”\n\nThe Olympic Games aims to inspire generation after generation and with key inspirations such as Hiroki Goto driving the sport and multihull sailing forward, watch out for a high flying Japanese Nacra 17 team at Tokyo 2020.\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nMeanwhile in the Women’s 470 there was cause for Japanese merriment as the team snapped up gold and silver respectively.\n\nAi Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (JPN) held onto their overnight lead whilst a second in the Medal Race promoted Akiyo Yamaguchi and Eri Hatayama (JPN) into silver medal position.\n\nAs Yamaguchi and Hatayama crossed the finished line there were smiles stretched across their faces with high fives aplenty. Kondo Yoshida and Yoshioka followed behind them in third and revelled in their compatriots’ celebrations with grins creeping in before they finished.\n\nIt was a tense race in the light breeze for all the competitors and the points were close going into the race. Xiaoli Wang and Lizhu Huang (CHN) were breathing down the Kondo Yoshida and Yoshioka’s necks but the Japanese experience shone through as they remained calm as Kondo Yoshida explained, “Today there was a two point lead for us against the Chinese team who were our closest rivals. We got the win and we are very very happy.”\n\nShasha Chen and Haiyan Gao (CHN) completed the Women’s 470 podium.\n\nIt was a three way shoot out in the Men’s 470 between the Austrian, Chinese and Spanish teams. Four points separated them going into the Medal Race and it was China’s Hao Lan and Chao Wang who prevailed.\n\nLan and Wang finished second in the Medal Race compared to overnight leader David Bargehr and David Mahr’s fourth (AUT) and Onan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera’s (ESP) third. As a result the Austrians were made to settle for silver, one point behind the Chinese with the Spaniards rounding off the podium.\n\n“There is a little bit of a mixture between happy and disappointed,” explained Bargehr. “But overall the happy feeling is superior because we won a medal here and it’s always good to win a medal.\n\n“We knew that points were very close with not much separation so we knew we had to sail a really good Medal Race to win this event.\n\n“After the race you are always more clever than before, but it was a really tight Medal Race and it could have gone either way. And always you need a little bit of luck in a Medal Race.”\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nThe advantage going into the Laser Medal Race belonged to Great Britain’s Lorenzo Chiavarini as he owned a 17 point lead. He delivered the goods with a sixth place finish to complete a comfortable victory.\n\n“I was a bit nervous coming into the day,” explained the British sailor, “but once I got out on the water everything started calming down.\n\n“The race track was shorter so the gains were less today. Tiredness was also another point of the day but for me it was important to keep Tonci [Stipanovic] around me and not let him go too far.”\n\nCroatia’s Stipanovic needed the to go massively in his favour if he was to overthrow Chiavarini. The British sailor controlled him and kept the Croatian behind him throughout the race with Stipanovic finishing second overall.\n\nThe Medal Race victory went the way of Pavlos Kontides (CYP) who moved up into the bronze medal position.\n\nChinese Laser Radial sailor Dongshuang Zhang loves sailing in Qingdao. She took her third consecutive victory at the event with another professional performance.\n\nZhang finished second in the Medal Race which confirmed her as gold medallist after the second placed Isabella Bertold (CAN) finished eighth overall.\n\nDespite finishing 17 points clear of her rivals, taking another World Cup gold medal, 12,000 Euros in prize money and booking a spot at the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final Zhang was less than impressed with her performance as she explained, “The race went very well, better than yesterday. I’m not very satisfied with the regatta, I made a lot of small mistakes which I will work on little by little.”\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nIt was double gold for China in the Men’s and Women’s RS:X with Chunzuang Liu and Jiahui Wu clinching gold in their respected fleets.\n\nWu led the Women’s RS:X fleet from the first day but heading into the Medal Race Peina Chen (CHN) was firmly in contention, just six points off the leader. Chen finished one place ahead of Wu in the Medal Race but it wasn’t enough to topple her as Wu sealed gold.\n\n“There was little wind and a lot of pumping,” explained Wu after racing, “but I am very happy with the win. It was a great competition for me and the less wind suited my style.”\n\nPei Ling Chen (CHN) took the Medal Race victory to pick up bronze.\n\nExperienced Spanish racer Blanca Manchon finished in eighth but was upbeat after racing with lots of lessons learnt from Qingdao’s challenging current, “I had two OCS this week, I was risking a lot because I came here for training so it was good for me to try a little risk on the starts, but with the currents it was hard to be on the line and sometimes I just made a mistake. If I didn’t have that second OCS I would have finished third so I am happy.\n\n“This place is totally different to Spain. It’s funny. It’s a different culture and wind so it was good. There was not much wind but it was great for my training.”\n\nNot much separated the Men’s RS:X fleet throughout the Medal Race with tensions high but Liu managed to put himself in a good position. A second place confirmed his gold medal and upon crossing the finish line he let out a triumphant, “woohoo.”\n\nOnce ashore Liu said, “I performed really well, better than normal. Over the regatta there has been good and bad, but overall it has been good and I have learned a lot. We have made great progress as a nation in windsurfing with tough exercises.”\n\nBing Ye (CHN) and Zhichao Zang (CHN) complete the podium.\n\nFinn\n\nChina’s Lei Gong overthrew Luwen Shen in the Finn to snap up a hard earned gold medal.\n\nGong and Shen battled hard throughout the week with very little separating them on the race track. The advantage belonged to Shen going into the Medal Race as he led Gong by five points.\n\nHowever it was Gong’s experience that shone through in the Medal Race as he took a convincing bullet with Shen sailing through in fourth. One point was the difference at the end of the day.\n\nFor China’s Finn team it was a job well done throughout the week as they booked the nation a spot at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.\n\nAttention now turns to the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final that is scheduled to take place from 27 October to 1 November 2015 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe best placed Asian and International sailors from ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao have booked their spot on the start line with the remaining sailors to be invited based on the ISAF World Sailing Rankings that will be released on 21 September.\n\nAnother day of light breeze and testing current made for minimal separations across the nine fleets competing at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao.\n\nAfter a short wait for wind the 320 competitors from 32 nations took to the water mid-afternoon for some tight racing where any mistake was duly punished.\n\nWith the competition reaching the midway point the leader boards are shaping up nicely ahead of Sunday’s Medal Races where Abu Dhabi World Cup final spots will be awarded, prize money distributed, world cup medals presented and Rio 2016 Olympic Games spots snapped up.\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nVery little separated the Laser and Laser Radial fleets with packed mark roundings and bunched finishes a common occurrence across the two races in each fleet.\n\nWinning races in any sport is a wonderful feeling. Knowing you’ve controlled a pack of racers behind you generates positivity but in sailing, it’s a different game. Across a series of races consistency ultimately pays and France’s Jean Baptiste Bernaz has proved this point with a pair of fourths to promote him to second overall, just three points off Lorenzo Chiavarini (GBR).\n\n“It was light and shifty, all day,” Baptiste Bernaz quickly summarised ashore after racing, “it was just like yesterday more or less. I had a four and four which is a good day, I think.”\n\nAnd a good day it was indeed as the Frenchman advanced up the leader board but he knows exactly where he wants to be come Sunday evening, “I came here to win,” he exclaimed. “I still have two days to do it in this fleet. It’s a good level with sailors from Croatia, Cyprus, Australia, Virgin Islands and Canada. There are many good sailors who know how to play these winds and I’m pretty happy to be second at the moment.”\n\nOvernight leader Chiavarini was consistent on the day, but not the way he would have wanted it. A pair of 13th place finishes was enough for him to maintain his advantage but only just.\n\nTonci Stipanovic (CRO) was unable to fully start the regatta the way he wanted it with a 27th and a black flag coming from the first three races but things have picked up for the defending champion. He managed to secure an 11th and second to move into third spot.\n\nThe day’s race wins in the Laser went the way of Ryan Palk (AUS), who is 18th overall and the seventh placed Pavlos Kontides (CYP).\n\nIt’s tight at the top in the Laser Radial with two points splitting Manami Doi (JPN), Dongshuang Zhang (CHN) and Isabella Bertold (CAN).\n\nOut on the race track both races were exceedingly close. The 28-boat fleet could barely be separated with the competitors looking to gain an edge any which way possible.\n\nA matter of metres separated the competitors at the finish which made for some nerves on the race track. However the leading trio sailed well with control. Doi secured a 5-4, Zhang a 6-1 and Bertold a 2-9.\n\nIf Doi, Zhang and Bertold continue to post strong scores, the chasing pack will struggle to make the gains on the penultimate day ahead of Sunday’s Medal Race.\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nSpain’s Onan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera lead the way in the Men’s 470 after a good day on the water, heading back ashore with a bullet and a third to show for their efforts.\n\nThey are being pushed by China’s Hao Lan and Chao Wang who lay in second overall, but it is in the middle of the pack where it starts to get interesting.\n\nFighting for an Olympic qualification place are the Korean and Thailand teams. Currently with their noses in front are Korea’s Chang Ju Kim and Ji-Hoon Kim who managed to mark off both ends of the spectrum with a discarded OCS in the first race before coming back to take a bullet in the next.\n\nTalking of the first race, crew Ji-Hoon Kim said, “We had some pressure and our minds and we were a little bit nervous. We could not see the line and we just pulled the main sheet and we had an OCS.”\n\nKim continued, “Our second race we were fast, and now I think we have a chance for Olympic qualification. We will try hard tomorrow, but it will still be very hard. But I am happy with our sailing.”\n\nOne place behind the two Kim’s are Thailand’s Navee Thamsoontorn and Nut Butmarasri who ended with a 13th and a discarded 16th.\n\nIt is still all too play for on the Olympic qualification front with Korea’s Daeyoung Kim and Hyun-Ho Yun and Singapore’s Darren Choy and Jeremiah Yeo hunting the two teams just ahead of them in the standings.\n\nIn a three way shootout between Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong in the Women’s 470 for Olympic qualification, it is Priscilla Low and Shu Xian Lee of Singapore who have the initiative.\n\nLow and Lee are ahead of Malaysia’s Nuraisyah Jamil and Norashikin Mohd Sayed and Hong Kong’s Catherine Carroll and Chi Han Yau.\n\nDespite a 15th in the first race of the day, which they discard, the Singaporean pair came back with a sixth in the second race to stay above their Rio qualification rivals.\n\nSitting above them, and all others in the fleet, are Japan’s Ai Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka who finally took the bullet they have been so close to all regatta. They stand top with ten points.\n\nTaking the first bullet of the day were the second placed Xiaoli Wang and Lizhu Huang of China. Adding a third to the bullet means they have 15 points, just two ahead of compatriots Sasha Chen and Haiyan Gao.\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nTied at the top of the Men’s RS:X are China’s Bing Ye and Tao Li who both sit on 37 points. Ye took a bullet in the second race which was sandwiched between a fifth and eighth which all count on his scorecard. Li however posted a 14th in the second race which he discards. Fortunately for Li he scored two seconds to keep in touch with his compatriot.\n\nOvernight leader Mateo Sanz Lanz of Switzerland slips down to fifth on the leader board.\n\nChina’s Jiahui Wu continues to lead the Women’s RS:X with a third, fifth and sixth place finish which she discards. Wu tops the leader board with 17 points.\n\nClosest rival to Wu is China’s Peina Chen on 23 points which was helped by a bullet from the first race, followed by a third and a discarded seventh.\n\nSpain’s Blanca Manchon is the nearest challenger to the Chinese sailors, lying in fourth overall on 45 points.\n\nFinn and 49er\n\nLei Gong (CHN) and Luwen Shen (CHN) jockeyed for position in the Finn fleet as they shared the bullets on the third day of competition. Gong holds the advantage at the top of pack on eight points but Shen remains within touching distance on ten points.\n\nThe third placed He Chen (CHN) has shown he has the beating of the duo after he won the second race of the week but with an OCS his discard, he can’t take too many risks if he is to overtake the leading pair.\n\nIn the 49er, Kim Sungwok and Yang Hoyeob (KOR) are tied on ten points with Bongjim Chae and Kim Dongwook (KOR). The teams have four race victories apiece across the eight races over three days.\n\nNacra 17\n\nIt’s hard to bet against Justin Liu and Denise Lim (SIN) in the Nacra 17 with the pair making it look easy in the light Qingdao air.\n\nLiu and Lim’s lightweight frames have seemingly given them a strong advantage in the Nacra 17 in Qingdao and after a 1-3-1 they have opened up a ten point advantage over Hong Kong’s Tat Choi Fung and Yu Ting Chan.\n\nAcross the week the Singaporean pair have won seven of nine races, dominating the fleet. On the race track itself Liu and Lim have found themselves behind at the first mark on several occasions but continuously push their way up through the bunch for win after win.\n\nWith the event acting as the Asian Nacra 17 Rio 2016 Olympic qualification regatta, another good day could see them book their spot on the start line and plan their road to Rio.\n\nRacing at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao resumes at 12:00 local time on Saturday 19 September.\n\nThe stakes at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao, taking place from 14-20 September 2015, will be raised with Rio 2016 Olympic Sailing Competition places on the line.\n\nAs the Asian continental qualification regatta for the Men’s and Women’s 470, Finn and Nacra 17 the competition in Qingdao is set to be fierce with a depth of international sailing talent within the respective fleets. Alongside Olympic qualification, more than 240 sailors from 37 nations will be gunning for a share of the $150,000 USD prize fund, ISAF Sailing World Cup Final spots as well as a World Cup medal.\n\nQingdao will be the final chance for Asian Nacra 17 sailors to qualify for Rio 2016 after 13 spots were distributed at the 2014 ISAF Worlds and 2015 Nacra 17 Worlds. The 470 and Finn sailors will have another opportunity later on in the year at their respective World Championships.\n\nThe last time an Asian crew, who weren’t representing the host nation, sailed in an Olympic multihull competition was Seoul 1988 as Naoyuki Ogawa and Takashi Tamura flew the Japanese flag on their Tornado. Fast forward to 2015 and crews from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and Thailand have an opportunity to qualify for an Olympic Games outright and on merit.\n\nJapan’s Hiroki Goto and Wakako Tabata arguably come into the regatta as the pair to beat. Goto and Tabata finished ahead of Justin Liu and Denise Lim (SIN) by two spots at the 2015 Nacra 17 Worlds and five clear of Hong Kong’s Tat Choi Fund and Yu Ting Chan.\n\nGoto has hopes of qualifying for Rio but his intention and drive is to inspire the youth of the country to sail multihulls ahead of Tokyo 2020, a home Olympic Games.\n\n“There is almost no multihull sailing in Japan whatsoever,” commented Goto. “We have a home [Olympic] Games in Tokyo and we need someone there. It would be ideal to get someone in the Games before. I wanted someone to start but no one came forward so I went for it.\n\n“The change to the qualification is good. It would be so tough otherwise for example Africa and Asia to qualify for the Olympics.\n\n“I really hope that I can encourage the younger generation to take up multihull. I am 42 and I want to show if I can do it, they can definitely do it.”\n\nGoto’s hopes could turn into reality in Qingdao but the Singaporean and Hong Kong teams will provide a real challenge whilst a contingent of four Chinese teams will benefit from knowing their home waters.\n\nWhoever takes that spot will also book their ticket to the Abu Dhabi ISAF Sailing World Cup Final making it a double whammy from Qingdao.\n\nThe Men’s 470 will be one of the most hotly contested battles with eight nations, China, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand all battling for one Olympic spot.\n\nSingapore’s Darren Choy, who will be sailing with Jeremiah Yeo, has had a feel of what the Olympics is like after competing at the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games and is aiming for the real deal. “The Youth Olympic Games made me want to experience the Olympic Games and feel the true spirit in the games because it is the highest prestige in the sport and to compete for Singapore would be an honour,” said Choy.\n\nHe continued, “The event is a really important one for us. It is our only ticket now to the 2016 Rio Olympics, as well as the opportunity to show that we are worth sponsoring and funding. I would love to qualify as this would give me a taste on what the Games are like and to experience it would be a dream for me.”\n\nCompared to those around them, Choy and Yeo are two of the youngest sailors in the fleet and miss out on some big time experience that their rivals hold and Choy was quick to identify his main rivals for Qingdao when asked, “It would definitely have to be the top Chinese and Korean teams as they have been on the Olympic circuit for many years, thus have a lot of experience. We’ve been working on some speed technique and race preparation in Singapore and I’m aiming to be the top Asian nation, and to qualify Singapore for the Rio Olympics.”\n\nChina will be represented by 13 Men’s 470 teams in Qingdao and with a strong presence on the start line, could be viewed as the favourites to take the Olympic spot. However, in a fleet of 32 that also features top 470 sailors such as David Bargehr and Lukas Mahr (AUT) and Onan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera (ESP), anything can happen.\n\nIn the Women’s 470, the fight will be between Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. The strong teams from China and Japan qualified at the Santander 2014 ISAF Worlds making it a three horse race for qualification.\n\nAs for the battle to Abu Dhabi, defending champions Mengxi Wei and Yani Xu (CHN) return to defend their title but will face stiff competition from Angela Pumariega and Patricia Cantero Reina (ESP) and Ai Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (JPN).\n\nIn the Finn fleet, eight boats will take to the start line and include seven Chinese sailors and one Iranian. The odds will be heavily stacked towards the Chinese sailors with regards to the one Olympic spot on offer and the Abu Dhabi World Cup final spot but Iran’s Ahmad Ahmadi will fight hard across the week.\n\nRacing across the nine Olympic fleets is scheduled to commence on 16 September with Medal Races bringing the regatta to a close on 20 September.\n\nThe ISAF World Sailing Rankings for 20 October 2014 have been released.\n\n• Men’s RS:X racer Byron Kokkalanis (GRE) climbs to World #1 following ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao victory;\n\n• Australia’s Tom Burton (AUS) retains World #1 in the Laser after Qingdao bronze;\n\n• Jordi Xammar and Joan Herp (ESP) continue their rise after first senior title at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao;\n\n• Ups and downs in the Laser Radial after World Cup Qingdao.\n\nLaser\n\nTom Burton (AUS) retained World #1 in the Laser after a tremendous fight back at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao where he picked up bronze. The Australia had a tough opening day, finishing down the pack in both races but as the week progressed he worked his way up and sealed bronze on the final day to keep hold of World #1.\n\nQingdao gold medallist Tonci Stipanovic (CRO) is just 21 points behind Burton at World #3 with Robert Scheidt (BRA) sandwiched in the middle, eight points off the World #1.\n\nStipanovic (CRO) was in fine form in Qingdao to seal gold for the second consecutive year ahead of Pavlos Kontides (CYP) who was made to settle for silver again. Kontides sits at World #4, ten points off the Croatian.\n\nWannes Van Laer (BEL) is one of the big movers from Qingdao after his fourth place finish. The Belgian progresses up to World #20 from World #31 and also received an ISAF Sailing World Cup Final invitation from his fourth place in Qingdao.\n\nThere were four other graded Laser regattas in the current period, all worth 50 points.\n\nJuan Igancio Maegli (GUA) won gold at Semana de Buenos Aires in Argentina and moves up one spot to World #33. KSSS Olympic Class Regatta victor Kaarle Tapper (FIN) moves up to World #49. Laser Europa Cup Portugal winner Martis Pajarskas (LTU) is at World #78 and Sail Qatar winner Haakon Haakonsen (NOR) enters the rankings at World #361.\n\nLaser Radial\n\nThe final day at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao saw a shootout between Dongshuang Zhang (CHN), Tatiana Drozdovskaya (BLR), Sara Winther (NZL) and Tina Mihelic (CRO) for the podium spots.\n\nZhang took the honours at the 2013 edition and made sure of victory once again, finishing ahead of her rivals. Counting four regattas to her point’s total Zhang sits at World #12.\n\nMihelic (CRO) came up from fourth to second on the final day with a strong showing. The Croatian progresses up to World #5 from World #9. Bronze medallist Winther is the biggest Qingdao mover, coming up from World #27 to World #18. She also booked herself an invitation to the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final this November.\n\nDrozdovskaya finished last in the Qingdao Medal Race and dropped out of the podium places. She remains at World #3. 2014 Laser Radial World Champion Marit Bouwmeester (NED) stays at World #1 with Evi Van Acker (BEL) World #2.\n\nThere were three 50-point Laser Radial regattas in the current period. Josefin Olsson (SWE) took gold at the KSSS Olympic Class Regatta and is positioned at World #22. Carolina Joao (POR) came out on top at the Laser Europa Cup Portugal and as a result moves up from World #183 to World #139, a personal best. Semana de Buenos Aires gold went to Lucia Falasca (ARG) and she moves up 12 spots to World #47.\n\nLaser and Laser Radial Medal Race Highlights – 2014 SWC Qingdao\n\nIt was an epic final day battle in the Laser between Tonci Stipanovic (CRO) and Pavlos Kontides (CYP) at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao with the Croatian taking the spoils. In the Laser Radial, Dongshuang Zhang (CHN) defended her title ahead of a close knit bunch of racers.\n\nURL – http://youtu.be/RBOlqo6yEjI\n\nEmbed –\n\nMen’s RS:X\n\nByron Kokkalanis (GRE) jumps up to World #1 in the Men’s RS:X following victory at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao. The Greek sailor was dominant in Qingdao, sealing victory with a day to spare to take the full 200-points on offer. He reaped the rewards and climbs from World #8 to World #1 for the first time in his career.\n\nISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao silver and bronze medallists Aichen Wang (CHN) and Max Oberemko (RUS) took a good haul of points and progress into top spots in the Men’s RS:X Rankings. Wang sits at World #8 whilst Oberemko is at World #3.\n\nWomen’s RS:X\n\nWith just ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao as the only ranked regatta in the current period, Flavia Tartaglini (ITA) retains World #1 with Byrony Shaw (GBR) at World #2 and Laura Linares (ITA) at World #3.\n\nQingdao gold medallist Jiali Sun (CHN) took maximum points at the 200-point ISAF Sailing World Cup regatta in the Chinese city and advances up the rankings. The 23-year-old moves from World #23 to a personal best of World #11.\n\nOlga Maslivets (RUS) finished second in Qingdao and as a result sits at World #37. Bronze medallist Hongmei Shi (CHN) climbs to World #53 but only counts one result in her point’s total.\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X Medal Race Highlights – 2014 SWC Qingdao\n\nByron Kokkalanis (GRE) and Jiali Sun (CHN) walked away with gold in the Men’s and Women’s RS:X.\n\nURL – http://youtu.be/Ttj5GncMgEY\n\nEmbed –\n\nMen’s 470\n\nMen’s 470 rising youngsters Jordi Xammar and Joan Herp (ESP) continue to impress in the fleet and took their first ISAF Sailing World Cup title in Qingdao, China. The 2013 and 2014 junior world champions have had a great year and by taking their first significant senior title in Qingdao they advance up the World Rankings.\n\nPicking up 200-points from Qingdao the duo climb from World #17 to a personal best of World #10 and head into the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final in Abu Dhabi, UAE brimming full of confidence.\n\nPanagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis (GRE) finished behind the Spaniards in Qingdao. With a good points haul they move up one spot to World #2. Onan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera (ESP) completed the Qingdao podium and also advance up the rankings. They go from World #14 to World #8.\n\nMat Belcher and Will Ryan (AUS) remain at World #1, counting six excellent results to their point’s total of 985.\n\nWomen’s 470\n\nChina’s Mengxi Wei and Yani Xu re-enter the rankings at World #47 having dominated the fleet at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao. The Chinese pair were strong in Qingdao’s big breeze and big waves and rampant in the light tricky breeze, amassing consistent top results that gave them a convincing win and the full 200 ranking points.\n\nXiaomei Xu and Ping Zhang (CHN) finished behind their compatriots in Qingdao and as a result pick up a good haul of points that sees them rise to World #13 from World #29.\n\nShasha Chen and Haiyan Gao (CHN) completed the Qingdao podium and sit firmly at World #8, the leading Chinese duo in the rankings.\n\nJo Aleh and Polly Powrie (NZL) drop a regatta from their points total and slip from World #1 to World #4.

I was trying to stay really close and get him away from the start but he was time staying in the middle of the line all the time and 30 seconds before the start I made a mistake and I opened up the doors for him.\n\n“It was really tricky and I was pushing hoping he would make one mistake. At the first upwind mark I was last but it was not so bad as I caught some breeze and after 50 metres on the downwind I was only two metres behind him.\n\n“On the second upwind we were together and he didn’t follow me and that was a chance for me and I took it and came in front of him and after that I controlled him.”\n\nKontides was left to rue not following the Croatian as he analysed his race, “From the start I had a huge advantage but the wind was really tricky and you didn’t know where it was coming from. I had two options after the gate, to tack immediately and cover him or proceed a bit more and wait for the right shift. I thought the right would pay. By proceeding I was depending on the wind and the wind went left and I went right so I was wrong in my estimation and then I ended up behind him.\n\n“It was always going to be hard because he will always push you over the layline and then it’s game over.\n\n“I’m happy with how I sailed but I’m disappointed not to get gold, I have many silvers and now I have one more to the tally but I will keep on fighting. If I keep on sailing like I have this week then the gold will be pretty near.”\n\nThe fight was also on for bronze with Tom Burton (AUS) sitting ahead of Wannes Van Laer (BEL) by just one point before the Medal Race.\n\nBurton came through in third, three places ahead of Van Laer to take bronze but there were a few nerves on the race track, “The first beat everybody had a close eye on each other. I wasn’t looking too good at the top mark. Wannes was in front by a few boats so I just had to stay close and put a bit of pressure on him. I managed to get a bit of pressure on the second beat and just snuck past and held off to the finish\n\n“I’m reasonably happy. It’s nice to finish a tough week, I wasn’t happy with the way I was sailing. The guys at the front were really on to it. You’ve got to be on top of your game.”\n\nStipanovic, Kontides and Burton have already booked their plane tickets for the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final. The spot was wide open and Wannes van Laer’s fourth gave him the spot. As top Asian finisher, Colin Cheng (SIN) also receives an invitation.\n\nLaser Radial\n\nDongshuang Zhang (CHN) defended her ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao title after a tight week of Laser Radial sailing.\n\nZhang, Tatiana Drozdovskaya (BLR), Tina Mihelic (CRO) and Sara Winther (NZL) were all extremely tight heading into the Medal Race. With the points close anything was possible.\n\nWith a light frame and knowledge of Qingdao’s waters Zhang navigated the tricky conditions with expertise. She came through in third and most importantly well ahead of her three rivals, taking gold by 11 points. With a successful defence Zhang was beaming after racing, “I am really happy with the result and really happy to win in Qingdao, again,” said Zhang. “My performance was very good in today’s wind conditions. In the whole of the event sometimes the wind was strong and the direction was not one I’m used my performance was solid and I just tried my best to get as high as possible. I am really happy with my performance.”\n\nIt was a late finish the day prior with protests aplenty in the Laser Radial fleet. Mihelic was disqualified from the penultimate race and dropped out of the medals heading into the final day.\n\nWith the pressure high and needing a result the Croatian did not fail to deliver and finished ahead of Winther and Drozdovskaya to take silver, “The Medal Race was a really nervous race with lots of protests because four of us were really close. In the end I managed to finish fifth and end up with enough points to finish ahead of the girls from New Zealand and Belarus.\n\n“It was a light wind race so it was hard. There were a lot of jury out there so we had to be careful not to get penalised. It was really nervous with a few shifts and the wind going up and down.\n\n“Coming from fourth to second is a good feeling.”\n\nDrozdovskaya came through in last spot in the Medal Race and dropped out of the medal positions. Despite receiving a standard penalty, Winther held on to a podium position, taking bronze.\n\nWinther’s third place gives her an ISAF Sailing World Cup Final invitation spot. Min Gu (CHN) was the top Asian sailor and therefore receives an invitation.\n\nMen’s 470\n\nJordi Xammar and Joan Herp (ESP) took their first ISAF Sailing World Cup victory with a strong performance in Qingdao.\n\nThe two time Junior World Champions took a good lead into the Medal Race and a seventh was enough for them to take gold by four points over Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis (GRE). Xammar and Herp, who celebrated his 21st birthday on the final day, have thrived in Qingdao and having played down their chances in advance walk away as deserved victors.\n\n“It’s incredible to finish this regatta like this,” said Herp. “We didn’t expect this result before we came here but we sailed very well over the last few days and the Medal Race was tough because everybody was very close and anybody could put a boat in between us but that is sailing and we have to manage the pressure. We’re very happy about the ending.”\n\nIt’s been a fantastic year for the young Spaniards who have a string of achievements under their belts as Xammar concluded, “We are really happy with our season. We won the Junior Worlds and Europeans and finished seventh at the worlds and that was incredible for us. Now, coming here to a World Cup in Qingdao and winning is like… We thought Santander was the perfect thing and that was the end but coming here and winning our first World Cup in our lives is really good. This isn’t junior sailing; all the seniors are here with years of experience.\n\n“It’s amazing.”\n\nPanagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis (GRE) were the early leaders in the Men’s 470 but trailed the Spaniards by ten points heading into the Medal Race. A fourth compared to Xammar and Herp’s seventh was not enough for them to reduce the deficit but they did maintain second overall. “The Medal Race was difficult for us,” explained Mantis. “We tried to start close to both Spanish boats, we achieved that but we wanted to keep the right side but we ended up with the left side and we managed to pass the top mark not in a good position.\n\n“We were almost losing second place. We tried to recover and we finished fourth and this gave us the silver medal. We are very happy about this because it’s always very good to get a medal in an ISAF Sailing World Cup regatta.”\n\nOnan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera (ESP) round off the podium.\n\nHenrique Haddad and Bruno Amorim (BRA) and Zangjun Xu and Wei Wang (CHN) are the recipients of an ISAF Sailing World Cup Final invitation.\n\nWomen’s 470\n\nIt was victory for home nation sailors Mengxi Wei and Yani Xu in the Women’s 470 who sealed the deal with a second place in the Medal Race. They have been the standout performers in the Women’s 470 finishing out of the top two on just two occasions across the week.\n\nAfter racing Wei said, “I feel very grown up and happy that I have won here. I feel very lucky to come to Qingdao and represent China. I am honoured and proud to win a gold medal.”\n\nXiaomei Xu and Ping Zhang (CHN) took silver with a third in the Medal Race\n\nShasha Chen and Haiyan Gao (CHN) pushed Ai Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (JPN) out of the medal places after taking the final race victory. The Japanese pair could only muster a fifth which saw them miss out on bronze by three points.\n\nAs winners Wei and Xu receive an ISAF Sailing World Cup Final invitation.\n\nMen’s RS:X\n\nWith Byron Kokkalanis (GRE) wrapping up gold ahead of the Medal Race all eyes were on the fight for silver and bronze between Aichen Wang (CHN) and Max Oberemko (RUS).\n\nFive points split the pair ahead of the Medal Race, so it was game on. Oberemko knew what needed to be done and had a tremendous first upwind to hold the lead but Wang was hot on his heels rounding in second.\n\nOberemko stayed at the front of the fleet but Wang was persistent and kept up with his pace. Oberemko edged away from Wang as the race played out but unfortunately for the Russian, Wang was also extending his advantage over third place. Oberemko took the bullet and Wang came through with a comfortable second to seal silver.\n\nKokkalanis stayed out of their way throughout the race with a relaxed demeanour on the race course. He concluded the event with a fifth place in the Medal Race.\n\nThe Greek sailor has been a class above the rest of the fleet and has loved the ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao experience, “It feels really nice to be in Qingdao, the venue of the Beijing Olympics, and win an event like this.\n\n“It was a really nice experience to see the place, the marina, the feeling and knowing it hosted such a big event. To see the conditions that everybody was talking about, that it was really hard, humid and light winds. Basically the period now is the best and it’s a really nice temperature. It was an amazing week. We had all sorts of conditions so it was one of the best regattas I’ve had this year.”\n\nWith Kokkalanis qualifying for Abu Dhabi at the Santander 2014 ISAF Worlds, Aichen Wang (CHN) receives the invitational spot as the next leading sailor.\n\nWomen’s RS:X\n\nJiahui Wu (CHN) took gold in the Women’s RS:X, holding off Olga Maslivets (RUS) in the Medal Race to seal the deal. The Chinese sailor moved into pole position the day prior after Maslivets received a disqualification.\n\nSun came through in fifth compared to Maslivets’ seventh that ensured she finished 11.4 points ahead of the Russian.\n\nAfter racing Wu said, “The weather and wind has been good. I have tried my best throughout the whole competition and I feel really good about winning. I have been confident throughout the competition.”\n\nMaslivets knew what she had to do in the Medal Race and worked hard on the water, putting her final efforts into the race but in the light breeze she was unable to find an edge and missed out on gold. Nonetheless she was pleased with her performance, “I’m still happy as I’ve just come back onto the RS:X after two years out. It’s good to be back on the track and I feel happy in the RS:X again.\n\n“It’s a different Qingdao to the one I knew and I liked it more because we had good winds, really nice winds from the sea which we never had six years ago. I like the challenging conditions with the difficult current and the waves.”\n\nHongmei Shi (CHN) blitzed the field in the Medal race, taking the bullet which subsequently moved her into third overall after Mei Hao floundered in ninth position. Shi took bronze by just a single point over Hao.\n\nWith Sun already invited to Abu Dhabi, the invitation is given to Olga Maslivets (RUS).\n\nNext up for many of the racers is the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates from 26-30 November.\n\nIt was a light wind day at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao with many ups and downs across the six fleets competing on the Beijing 2008 Olympic waters.\n\nAfter a short early afternoon delay the sailors headed out onto the water with a shifty breeze and strong current that would once again test them to the max.\n\nOne race was completed in the Men’s and Women’s 470, Laser and Laser Radial whilst the Men’s and Women’s RS:X packs, sailing shorter races, completed two.\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nHome nation sailors Mengxi Wei and Yani Xu (CHN) have been head and shoulders above the rest in the Women’s 470 across five completed races. The Chinese pair were bang on form again on the third day of the competition in the single Women’s 470 race.\n\nWith a great start Wei and Xu took the lead from the off. At the first mark they held a five second advantage over Ai Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (JPN). The Chinese leaders slowly extended the gap to 11 seconds at the end of the first downwind. The Japanese pair kept Wei and Xu within their sights but pushed a little too hard and received a penalty that relegated them down the pack. After racing a disappointed Kondo said, “The current was very strong and close to the shore. It was really difficult for racing and I got a penalty. The wind was down and difficult today.”\n\nWhilst Wei and Xu had lost the Japanese pair they had new company. China’s Shasha Chen and Haiyan Gao managed to read the conditions well and moved up from tenth to second. However Wei and Xu showed their strength and took the bullet ahead of Chen and Gao.\n\nWei and Xu sit pretty at the top of the pack on five points whilst three points separates Xiaomei Xu and Ping Zhang (CHN), Chen and Gao and Japan’s Kondo and Yoshioka.\n\nThere were several big up and downs in the single Men’s 470 race as the current made life tough. The fleet of 17 were forced to sail above the layline to take the current into account. Several teams read the situation well and flourished whilst others fell back in a game of snakes and ladders.\n\nHenrique Haddad and Bruno Bethlem (BRA) took their chances and rounded the first mark ahead of South Africa’s Asenathi Jim and Roger Hudson who just missed the layline. The Brazilians were able to extend their advantage as the race played eventually taking the bullet.\n\nBehind them the fleet were up and down. Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis (GRE) and Jordi Xammar and Joan Herp (ESP) held a joint lead coming into the day. There was very little separating the teams early on in the race but the Greeks were penalised and dropped down the pack eventually finishing 14th, which they discard.\n\nXammar and Herp were more fortunate and worked their way to a solid second which Xammar explained at the end of the day, “Well it was a difficult race. We are very happy with our result. Going into tomorrow we are first and we are really happy. It was really hard racing, a lot of current, a lot of changes in pressure and shifts.\n\n“We had to really concentrate and watch the next mark all the time to see the pressure. We were a bit lucky but we managed to finish second.”\n\nThe young Spaniards hold the lead on nine points. Mantis and Kagialis are second on 13 points whilst Pavel Sozykin and Denis Gribanov (RUS) maintain third overall.\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nAn intriguing battle is developing within the Laser Radial with small margins separating the top four sailors.\n\n2013 ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao gold medallist Dongshuang Zhang (CHN) has the lead on nine points following victory in the single Radial race.\n\nZhang displayed excellent tactical nous in the light winds at the 2013 edition of the regatta and she thrived in the conditions on the third day of the 2014 regatta, taking the bullet by eight seconds over Croatia’s Ana Zelic.\n\nZhang has a four point lead over Tatiana Drozdovskaya (BLR), Tina Mihelic (CRO) and Sara Winther (NZL) who are all tied on 13 points. With three races scheduled on the penultimate day much can change with ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao honours on the line.\n\nTonci Stipanovic (CRO) is the Laser master of Qingdao’s light winds and strong current. The Croatian picked up his fourth bullet of the regatta in the only Laser race and holds a six point lead over Pavlos Kontides (CYP) heading into the penultimate day.\n\nJust nine points separate third to eighth in the Laser with three races remaining.\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nByron Kokkalanis (GRE) continues to lead the Men’s RS:X despite a less than convincing day in the lighter breeze. The Greek sailor’s overnight 16 point lead was reduced to 11 points following a fifth and a discarded ninth.\n\nAichen Wang (CHN) enjoyed one of his best days of racing posting a bullet and a third to subsequently reduce Kokkalanis’ advantage. Max Oberemko (RUS) remains third overall but Michael Cheng (HKG) is piling on the pressure as he sits just four points behind.\n\nOlga Maslivets (RUS) Women’s RS:X lead stands at nearly 20 points heading into penultimate day. With a redress of 4.4 points and a fifth she is on 19.4 points. Jiali Sun (CHN) stole the day with a light wind master class. Many Chinese sailors are known for being strong in the lighter breeze and Sun exemplified that by taking a bullet and a second. As a result she moves to second overall, sitting on 37 points.\n\nHongmei Shi (CHN) is third overall on 47 points.\n\nRacing is scheduled to commence at 12:00 local time on Friday 17 October.\n\nIt was a day of tight battles and close knit racing at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao as the six fleets enjoyed a strong breeze in Qingdao, China.\n\nThere were several close finishes across the fleets with 13-18 knots of south westerly breeze and up to 2.5 knots of current on the race track making life tough for the 171 sailors from 21 nations.\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nGreece’s Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis and Spain’s Jordi Xammar and Joan Herp are tied at the top on seven points in the Men’s 470 following an exciting day of racing.\n\nWith big breeze, strong current and plenty of waves Xammar and Herp stole the day as they posted two second places. However it could have been better as they lost out on a bullet in the opening race of the day.\n\nThe Spaniards took the lead early on in the race and held a narrow advantage over Mantis and Kagialis as the race played out. On the downwind run to the finish the Greek pair piled on the pressure and started to reduce the Spaniards lead with the finish line approaching.\n\nXammar and Herp kept their head on a swivel, keeping an eye on the Greeks whilst Mantis and Kagialis pushed on. Herp explained what occurred, “They gybed first and then we gybed just after them and they seemed to be gaining an advantage little by little. Thirty seconds before the finish line we took a big wave just at the moment they gybed and then we waited too long to gybe again. If we would have gybed earlier we would have had a safe lead but we waited and then we entered the finish at exactly the same moment.\n\n“It was a photo finish.”\n\nThe Greeks had done enough to take the bullet to continue their solid start. After racing Mantis said, “It was tough. It was shifty and it was difficult to see a breeze because there was a fog. We had a good battle, we had some gybes and some big waves and in the end it was a photo finish at the line. It was nice.”\n\nIn the second race of the day, fourth in total, Russia’s Pavel Sozykin and Denis Gribanov took the bullet with Xammar and Herp coming in second. The Spaniards made up for their disappointment in the first race of the day, moving through the pack. Herp concluded, “We were the best team of the day. We thought we would finish third but on the last downwind we were very fast and we were able to pass the Chinese guys. The left paid all day and we had good speed and we are happy with our day.”\n\nAs it stands the leading Greek and Spanish teams have a five point advantage over Sozykin and Gribanov and Onan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera (ESP).\n\nChina’s Wei Mengxi and Yani Xu maintained their solid start in the Women’s 470 with a bullet and a fourth. Their advantage stands at five points over their compatriots Xiaomei Xu and Zhang Ping.\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nOlga Maslivets (RUS) holds an 11 point lead in the Women’s RS:X following an up and down day. She opened her account with a first and second but after a couple of errors she dropped down to 16th in the final race of the day. Nonetheless, as she discards her 16th, she leads the way on 10 points and is enjoying being back in Qingdao.\n\n“It’s like huge deja-vu after the Olympics in 2008,” commented Maslivets. “I really love the place and it feels so wonderful to be here especially with these good winds. The Chinese are really good competitors in all conditions. It’s their home waters so it’s really competitive. It’s tough to beat them but it’s really fun.”\n\nLu Yunxiu (CHN) sits in second with Hao Mei (CHN) a point behind in third.\n\nGreece’s Byron Kokkalanis continues to dominate in the Men’s RS:X and put in another strong showing on the race track. From three races Kokkalanis took two bullets and a third to give him a 16 point lead heading into the third day.\n\nExperienced racers Aichen Wang (CHN) and Max Oberemko (RUS) trail Kokkalanis in second and third.\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nTatiana Drozdovskaya (BLR) excelled in the Laser Radial, posting double bullets to move into the lead. The Belarusian, 2013 ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao silver medallist, was clinical in the stronger breeze and current. However, Drozdovskaya is just one point ahead of Tina Mihelic (CRO) who discards her ninth in Race 1 following a third and a second.\n\n2013 ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao gold medallist Dongshuang Zhang (CHN) is third on eight points with Sara Winther (NZL) a point behind.\n\nTonci Stipanovic (CRO) maintained his lead in the Laser after he picked up his third race win of the regatta. The Croatian won gold in 2013 and has been using his knowledge of the venue to full effect, mastering the strong current that rips across the race area.\n\nOn the opening day Australia’s Tom Burton struggled with the current but was back to his best from the off on the second day. He took the bullet ahead of Pavlos Kontides but slipped 12th in Race 4.\n\nKontides stays in second overall whilst Wannes Van Laer (BEL) is third.\n\nThe wind is expected to decrease for the third day of competition. Racing is scheduled to commence at 13:00 local time.\n\nIt was a day for calculated thinking and well measured approaches for the 171 sailors from 21 nations across six classes as racing commenced at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao.\n\nWhilst the wind was a steady 8-9 knots it was the strong current that played the biggest factor on the opening day with thought processes aplenty.\n\nThose who read the conditions well rose to the top of the leader boards as three races were completed in the Men’s and Women’s RS:X and two in the Men’s and Women’s 470, Laser and Laser Radial.\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nTonci Stipanovic (CRO) and Pavlos Kontdies (CYP) were models of consistency on the opening day with the former posting two bullets and the latter taking two seconds.\n\nIt was a day of challenges for the 37-boat fleet with tactful sailing in a tough breeze and strong current. Stipanovic took gold at the 2013 edition of ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao and used his experience of the waters to full affect, dominating the day, “It was a really good first day,” said the Croatian. “I managed to finish both races first, all marks around first but it was a really difficult wind with a lot of shifts. I was trying to keep on the left side the whole day and I managed to do that.”\n\nAt future ISAF Sailing World Cup regattas the fleet size will be reduced to 40 boats and with a number close to that in Qingdao Stipanovic likes the size of the fleet, “It’s much better than last year and it’s almost 40 boats which we’ll have next season in the World Cup so it is really nice. Next season all 40 boats will be top guys and it’s good that ISAF is changing and trying something.”\n\nDespite trailing Stipanovic in both races Kontides was always in the hunt, putting the Croatian under pressure in both races. With the current and wind playing a big factor on the opening day Kontides always believed he would overtake his training partner, “In the strong current it was really important to be correct otherwise you would lose or gain a lot of metres,” said the Cypriot, silver medallist at the 2013 ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao.\n\n“The race was never over until the end. I sailed consistently and had two second places and I am satisfied with the way I sailed and the way I thought during the races and I’m looking forward to the rest of the week.\n\n“It’s a nice group of people and pretty competitive. You can see how one big mistake can get you right at the back of the fleet and you have to be careful because there are a lot of guys who can really good in this regatta.”\n\nWannes Van Laer (BEL) holds third position after the conclusion of race day one following a third and an eighth.\n\nIn the Laser Radial it was another 2013 victor, Dongshuang Zhang (CHN), who leads the way. Zhang was consistent on the race track posting two second place finishes to lead Sara Winther (NZL) by four points.\n\nGu Win (CHN) stole the show in the opening race of the day as she took an early lead. The Chinese racer got clean air and was able to extend her advantage as the race played out. She followed it up with an eighth in the second race to occupy third place overall.\n\n2013 Laser Radial World Champion Tina Mihelic (CRO) took the second bullet of the day and sits in fifth.\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nGreece’s Byron Kokkalanis grabbed the lead in the Men’s RS:X fleet with a solid day of racing. Posting a 1-4-2 scoreline the Greek racer is one point ahead of China’s Xue Jingqi.\n\nKokkalanis explained how things panned out on the race track, “It was really tricky and gusty because the wind was blowing from the towers and cliffs so it was really hard. It’s a hard fleet in the light winds because the Chinese are really good. There can always be someone on the top for them as they are all very equal. I had fun and tomorrow the wind looks good, a nice breeze so we can have some more fun.”\n\nThe Greek sailor, visiting Qingdao for the first time, is revelling in the Chinese racing and culture and is making the most of his visit, “I love the place,” exclaimed Kokkalanis, “I’ve never been here before. It’s my first time. I did my campaign in 2008 but I didn’t qualify for the Olympics so it’s nice to be here and to see the place. The Opening Ceremony was good. I’ve never seen an Opening Ceremony in the World Cup like that, it was really nice.”\n\nGoing into the second day of competition and three more races are scheduled. With the breeze forecast to increase, Kokkalanis is looking forward to another good day of racing, “I’m just doing to do my best, I know I am fast planing and in strong wind. I’ll just keep an eye on the guys who are doing really good as well and just see what comes out.”\n\nThe day’s bullets went the way of Jingqi and Fu Erhao (CHN) who is down in sixth.\n\nIn the Women’s RS:X Lu Yunxiu (CHN) and Olga Maslivets (RUS) share the lead on three points. Maslivets was the stand out performer in the Women’s RS:X picking up an opening race bullet and following it up with a second and a fourth.\n\nYunxiu discards a 24th in the second race of the day so will have to remain consistent throughout the remaining races to ensure she keeps in touch at the top of the bunch.\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nGreece’s Pavlos Kagialis and Panagiotis Mantis have been one of the top performers in the Men’s 470 over 2014 and peaked at the Santander 2014 ISAF Sailing World Championships where they walked away with bronze. The pair have carried that form over to ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao and with a 2-4 score line they lead the 18-boat Men’s 470.\n\nAs the week progresses it will be the team with the most consistent results that will walk away with the spoils. Race 1 victors Weng Daoliang and Lin Qiaowen (CHN) picked up an 11th in the second race to sit fourth overall. Zhou Chuancheng and Lin Yiqiang (CHN) took the second race bullet but posted a sixth in the opening race.\n\nIn the Women’s 470 China’s Wei Mengxi and Xu Yani lead after a second and a bullet. They have a slender three point advantage over Japan’s Ai Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka.\n\nThe breeze is expected to pick up on the second day of competition. Racing is scheduled to resume at 13:00 local time on Wednesday 15 October.\n\nMore than 150 sailors from 25 nations racing across six classes are set to compete at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao in China from 14-18 October 2014.\n\nAs the dust settles on the ISAF Sailing World Championships many of the racers are heading east to compete at the second edition of ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao.\n\nRacing across the Men’s and Women’s 470, Laser, Laser Radial and Men’s and Women’s RS:X will take place across three race courses at the venue of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Sailing Competition. Strong Chinese contingents as well as international excellence will make up the six fleets ensuring an exciting week of racing in China.\n\nCompetitors across the six events will be vying for their share of the 180,000USD prize money. 18,000 USD will be awarded to the gold medallist with 8,000 USD and 4,000 USD going to second and third place.\n\nThe Men’s 470 fleet will see 22-boats line up on the start line in Qingdao with a blend of experience and youth amongst the entrants.\n\n2013 and 2014 Junior 470 World Champions Jordi Xammar and Joan Herp (ESP) made major inroads at the Santander 2014 ISAF Worlds, finishing seventh overall. The pair took the Medal Race bullet in Santander and having proven they can beat some of the finest Men’s 470 sailors Xammar is coy on his team’s chances in Qingdao, “It would be great [to win] but I think it is too early to take a win in a senior event and we have still many things to learn but for sure we are going to fight as much as we can.\n\n“Our aim for the World Cup in Qingdao is to keep learning from the best sailors and give our best in every race, we don’t want to fight for one place, just try to be as higher as possible.\n\n“We are expecting a really high level competition and we know that the starts are going to be very important because with a bad start is going to be very difficult to recover.”\n\nThe competition is set to be high in the Men’s 470 with World #3 Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis (GRE), World #6 Sofian Bouvet and Jeremie Mion (FRA) and two time Olympian Onan Barreiros with crew Juan Curbelo Cabrera (ESP) joining Xammar and Herp in the pack.\n\nThe Women’s 470 fleet will see a tight knit 10 boat fleet take to the water. The experienced Ai Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (JPN) will go into the event as favourites but with World #10 Shasha Chen and Haiyan Gao (CHN) and a young, fresh Chinese team joining them they will have their work cut out.\n\nA fleet of 37 will make up the Laser fleet and the level will be high. World #1 Tom Burton (AUS), World #3 Tonci Stipanovic (CRO) and World #4 Pavlos Kontides (CYP) will be within the fleet.\n\nStipanovic and Kontides occupied the top two spots at the 2013 edition of ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao and will no doubt be two of the front runners again. On the week ahead Kontides said, “The Laser class always has tough competition. My goal is to simply sail with fewer mistakes as possible and by doing that I know I can battle for those places on the podium. Last year I was second so improvement will be achieved only by winning gold.”\n\nA mixed bag of conditions tested the fleet at the 2013 edition and more of the same is expected in 2014 as Kontides added, “Last year was a good warm up event for the worlds and a verification that sailing is an all-round sport as we had all kinds of conditions.\n\n“Qingdao is a venue with different sailing conditions from what we are used to sailing in and it is always challenging to sail there. Sport is all about challenge so I am excited to return there to compete.”\n\nWith the likes of Kontides, Stipanovic and Burton within the pack alongside further talent such as Bruno Fontes (BRA), Thomas Saunders (NZL), Karl-Martin Rammo (EST), Colin Cheng and Wannes Van Laer (BEL), the going will be tough for all those involved with 200 ISAF World Ranking points on offer to the winner.\n\nTatiana Drozdovskaya (BLR) was forced down to the back of the pack in the Laser Radial Medal Race at the 2013 version of ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao and missed out on gold as Dongshuang Zhang (CHN) claimed the honours. The Belorussian makes a return to avenge her defeat.\n\nJoining Drozdovskaya in the fleet will be Italy’s Laura Cosentino who is making her second visit to China as she explained, “I’m really looking forward to racing in Qingdao. I was in Rizhao last year for the Radial World Championship where we had some good racing, I hope it will be the same also in Qingdao.\n\n“I think it will be a weird competition, even if it’s a World Cup regatta we are only few competitors. In the Laser Radial we are used to sailing in big fleets, so it will be a totally different kind of racing, more similar to a Medal Race.”\n\nFurther competition for the top places will come from Singapore’s Elizabeth Yin, New Zealand’s Sara Winther and Russia’s Elena Vorobeva.\n\n2014 ISAF Sailing World Cup Miami gold medallist Byron Kokkalanis (GRE) will lead the line in the 37 strong Men’s RS:X fleet in Qingdao. After starting 2014 off with a golden bang in Miami, following up with Sailing World Cup Mallorca silver, the Greek racer missed out on a podium place at the European, Olympic Test Event and Santander 2014 ISAF Worlds.\n\nNot one to dwell on missed chances Kokkalanis is aiming to get back to top spot in Qingdao, “My goal is to win the competition,” said Kokkalanis, “and of course the prize money since we’ve never had competitions with prize money. My other goal is to also get high in the ISAF World Rankings.”\n\nKokkalanis campaigned for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Sailing Competition but missed out on selection so will be making his first trip to Qingdao. Kokkalanis concluded, “I’m really looking forward to competing in the place of the 2008 Olympics. I expect the competition to be very hard in light winds.”\n\nJoining Kokkalanis in the fleet will be a strong Chinese contingent as well as Hong Kong’s Ho Tsun Leung, Italy’s Marcantonio Baglione and Maksim Oberemko (RUS).\n\nThirty one sailors will make up the Women’s RS:X fleet. The Chinese team have been ones to watch in recent months in the Women’s RS:X with many of their team impressing on the international stage. Leading the charge will be 2013 World Cup Qingdao and 2014 World Cup Hyeres silver medallist Jiahui Wu (CHN) and 2013 World Cup Melbourne gold medallist Manjia Zheng (CHN).\n\nRacing is scheduled to commence on 14 October Medal Races bringing the regatta to a close on 18 October."
