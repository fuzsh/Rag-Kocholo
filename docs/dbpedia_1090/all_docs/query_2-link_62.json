        "text": "Brought to you by boats.com Europe, Scuttlebutt Europe is a digest of sailing news and opinions, regatta results, new boat and gear information and letters from sailors -- with a European emphasis. Contributions welcome, send to editor@scuttlebutteurope.com\n\n32nd Copa Del Rey MAPFRE\n\nToday was the first day of competition in the 32nd Copa del Rey MAPFRE. A north-easterly wind of 10-12 knots greeted the fleet in the Bay of Palma on opening day. Conditions have been uneven in the three race courses, but all classes were able to sail at least one race. The Alpha race course was the most favoured, where the X-35 and J80 were the only two fleets that managed to sail two races.\n\nThe first leaders of the week are: British \"Jethou\" in the Hublot IRC 0 class, Italian \"B2\" in Hublot IRC 1, Swedish \"Ran\" in Gaastra IRC 52, Romanian \"Natalia\" in G.H. Mumm ORC 1, Spanish \"X-Spain\" in G.H. Mumm ORC 2, Spanish \"Vamos Spain\" in Nespresso Soto 40, Italian \"Margherita\" in La Caixa X-35 and Spanish \"Turismo do Algarve\" in Mahou J80.\n\nThe regatta program continues tomorrow in the Bay of Palma. The Race Committee will attempt to organize three races in all classes except for La Caixa X-35 and Mahou J80, which has scheduled a maximum of two races tomorrow. The first start of the day is scheduled at 13h00.\n\nwww.regatacopadelrey.com\n\n* The challenges came in different forms for some of the top 52's on the first day of the 32nd Copa del Rey MAPFRE on the Bay of Palma, Mallorca, but it was Niklas Zennstrom's crew on Ran Racing which won the one and only race for the Gaastra IRC Class.\n\nThe unusual NE'ly wind direction had several navigators and tacticians searching their memory banks to recall the best strategy for what ultimately proved to be an excellent opening contest for Spain's showcase annual regatta.\n\nWhile Ran Racing's tactician Adrian Stead and strategist/trimmer Andy Hemmings read it well, guiding Ran Racing to a very comfortable win, by some two and a half minutes ahead of a tightly matched group, second placed Azzurra started badly after a series of mishaps spiralled to leave them out of sorts, last off the start line.\n\nAzzurra overcame their own pre-race troubles and fight back through the fleet. An engine malfunction and radio problems had left them slightly short of their usual preparation regime.\n\nErgin Imre's Provezza lead to the first mark, hung on to second around most of the course and only slipped to fourth, one second behind 52 SUPER SERIES leader Quantum Racing, despite racing with no electronics and with a stand in, late substitute bowman.\n\nwww.52superseries.com\n\nMirror World Sailing Championships\n\nClick on image to enlarge.\n\n182 sailors in 91 boats began competing today on Lough Derg, Dromineer, Co.

Click on image for photo gallery.\n\nThe second day of competition gathered the most international fleet in the history of the Copa del Rey MAPFRE for an intense share of racing in the three race courses in the Bay of Palma. This time, the wind at the start of the first race went from 7 to 13 knots, depending on the race course. The race committee was able to accomplish its program: three races in all classes except in Mahou J80 and La Caixa X-35, who sailed two races. Now all classes have four races sailed.\n\nHublot IRC 0 and IRC 1\n\nSir Peter Ogden's British \"Jethou\" is still leading the provisional results in the class IRC Hublot 0 despite finishing fourth in the last race of the day. Today, the best of the class was Alessandro Rombelli's Italian \"Stig\", with two victories (1-3-1).\n\nIn Hublot IRC 1, Michele Galli's \"B2\" signed an almost perfect score (2-1-1) which allows him to escape to the front of the overall results with a nine point cushion over German \"Speedy\", winner of the first race of the day. Third is Swiss \"Team Vision Future\", one point behind \"Speedy\".\n\nGaastra IRC 52\n\nToday Niklas Zennström's \"Ran\" and Ed Baird's \"Quantum Racing\" fought a magnificent duel in the Gaastra IRC 52 class. The Swedish boat won today's first two races, but a mistake at the start of the third race prevented him from finishing a perfect day. Zennström managed to climb back to literally cross the finish line at the same time as American \"Interlodge\", so they each received 5.5 points. Ed Baird scored the victory in the last race and is the new class leader, but only half a point ahead of \"Ran\".\n\nG. H. Mumm ORC 1 and ORC 2\n\nToday the best among the 36 teams in G.H. Mumm ORC 1 was Rafael Carbonell's \"Rats on Fire\". The Swan 45 scored two bullets and a third allowing him to lead the provisional overall with a difference of six points over his nearest rival, \"Grupo Clínico Dr. Luis Senís\" skippered by Axel Rodger, who won the last race of the day.\n\nIn G.H. Mumm ORC 2, Pedro Campos' \"Movistar\" has completed an excellent second day, scoring 2-1-1 and leading its class, three points ahead of arch-rival, Iñaki Castañer's \"X-Spain\" (3-3-2). Joan Cabrer's \"Airlan-Aermec\" completes the provisional podium, which won the first race of the day and finished the other two races with a fifth and a fourth.\n\nThe 32nd Copa del Rey MAPFRE will continue tomorrow at 13h00. All classes are scheduled to sail two windward/leeward races except Hublot IRC 0, Hublot IRC 1 and Hublot IRC 52, which will sail a coastal race around the bay of Palma.\n\nFull results: www.regatacopadelrey.com/resultados2013/\n\nwww.regatacopadelrey.com\n\nSo... How Fast Is Oracle?\n\nTeam New Zealand are still trying to get definitive performance figures on Oracle but have conceded that the America's Cup holders look \"real quick\".\n\nTeam New Zealand's shore crew had the syndicate's giant catamaran in the shed yesterday for the start of modifications aimed at gaining more speed for the Louis Vuitton Cup final starting on August 18.\n\nSo members of the sailing crew took the opportunity to board a chase boat and spend the day observing Oracle's two-boat testing on San Francisco Bay.\n\nWhile the Kiwis have totally dominated Italy's Luna Rossa and struggling challenger Artemis Racing will need a miracle to be competitive, the big question remains: how fast are the Americans?\n\nThe problem is the Kiwis are struggling for exact data on Oracle.\n\nThey have filed two series of questions to the International Jury asking why Oracle aren't making their performance data available when they are two-boat testing on the race course, often immediately after a challenger race.\n\nThe challengers have to make their statistics public. Oracle can punch those numbers into their computer and get a strong comparison against their own figures.\n\nBut that information flow is a one-way system at present.\n\n\"They have got a pretty good idea of our performance. They can analyse our numbers and angles. We haven't had that opportunity (to analyse Oracle's numbers).\n\n\"So they probably have the slight upper hand in knowing how we are and we can only guess theoretically the performance of their boats,\" Glenn Ashby said. -- Duncan Johnstone in Stuff.co.nz\n\nwww.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/8981736/\n\nRace Ready For Cowes Week?\n\nWe all know Mother Nature can throw anything at you during Cowes Week, so don't get caught out and make the right calls on your kit today.\n\nMUSTO has everything you need - from GORE-TEX® foulies to keep you dry to a large selection of fast-dry SPF40 T-shirts and headwear to protect you from the sun.\n\nThere's still time to order in time from www.musto.com\n\nInternational 8mr World Championship\n\nHelskinki, Finland: Four races have been completed at the Nordea Private Banking 8mR Worlds in Helsinki, Finland with Hollandia strengthening their lead in the strengthening wind on day two.\n\nTuesday morning in Helsinki was cloudy and on the island of Liuskasaari, home for the organizing club Helsingfors Segelsallskap, the weather forecast promised strengthening winds and some showers.\n\nRace Committee decided to choose the area G for racing to avoid high waves typical in an easterly wind. This area is to the northern side of Isosaari and covered wind and waves from the open sea. As the fleet approached the race area some minor showers appeared but the air was warm and a steady 16 knot wind was blowing.\n\nThe first start of the second day was successful and 27 boats went to the racing course at 11:00. The first boat over the finishing line was Yquem II SUI-2 owned by Jean Fabre after 58 minutes of sailing, followed by Ruud van Hilst's Hollandia NED-1 and Lafayette GBR-2, owned by Murdoch McKillop.\n\nNot so lucky was Elfe II H-9 owned by Andi Lochbrunner who had a man overboard resulting in outside help from the press boat so they got DNF to the results for the race. Fortunately no one was hurt in the incident.\n\nThe second race started with even stronger wind of 20 knots from East at 12.40.\n\nRacing will continue on Wednesday at 11:00 local time. The wind forecast is not that promising: weakening winds and major direction change around midday.\n\nevents.sailracer.org\n\n29er World Championship - French Remain Atop Leader Board\n\nAarhus, Denmark: A challenging day for competitors and race committee alike on Kalovig Bay! A morning race was held in 8 knots for all courses with the Race Committee holding a watchful eye on the radar with an approaching thunderstorm. The impending storm cell hovered south of Aarhus before bringing wind and rain at the finish of the race, sweeping across the edge of Kalovig Bay.\n\nThomas Jorgensen, IRO commented \"We have had a long day for the 4 Race Management teams on the water. We started at the scheduled time at 12:00 but we had heavy rain with thunder at the finish and displayed AP on all courses and waited for better conditions. But another cell was behind it and we made the decision to send all fleets ashore for safety reasons. After 2 hours on shore, the wind arrived again from the southwest and we had 12 knots with 2 fine races to complete the qualifying series.\"\n\nWith the fleet now split into gold, silver, bronze and emerald fleets, the final push is on to determine the 29er World Champion. Leaders in the gold fleet are Lucas Rual and Emile Amoros (FRA) who remain in the lead. Charlie Wyatt and Tom Siganto (AUS) had a stellar day moving back to second and American brother duo Quinn and Dane Wilson sit third overall. Ragna and Maia Agerup of Norway continue to be the top female team and are 17th overall.\n\nAarhus Sailing and Kalovig Sailing Club are host to the event and have enlisted the many parents as volunteers to help with the launch and retrieval and trolly sorting as well as distributing the daily after race snack to all competitors.\n\nTwenty-five nations are representing all continents with 213 entries in this highly competitive fleet.\n\nThe finals begin on Wednesday, July 31 followed by two more days of the final series.\n\nwww.29erworlds.org\n\nRS Tera World Championships\n\nPhoto by Gabrielle Morehead.

Click on image to enlarge.\n\nDay 2 of the Mirror World Sailing Championships on Lough Derg, Dromineer, Co. Tipperary got off to a tricky start. Race 3, the first race of the day, began with a total of three general recalls and two race abandonments due to severely quick shifting winds. Eventually, sixth time lucky, the fleet were clear and the race finally got under way. Finishing yesterday in 3rd overall, Sarah Richards and her son George (GBR) took the win in this race followed by Katie Davies & Gemma Keers (GBR) in second and father and daughter Jeremy and Lauren Stephens in third (GBR).\n\nThe second race of the day got off first time under a black flag. Up the middle seemed to be the optimum tactic in the steady 18 knots breeze.\n\nUp the second beat with winds were gusting to 25 knots. With wind constantly between 20 and 25 knots and quite a few retirees, the PRO called the fleet temporarily ashore after the second race of the day.

Among the wreckage were telescopes and other navigational tools that survivors likely would not have left behind if they could have helped it, the researchers said.\n\nThe ship that the team set out to examine initially was armed with six cannon and may have had two masts. Undersea images show the outline of a copper-clad, 84ft (25m) long by 26ft (8m) wide wooden hull.\n\nSky News: news.sky.com\n\nRoyal Yacht Squadron Bicentenary Regatta\n\nThe Royal Yacht Squadron will issue its Preliminary Notice of Regatta this week as preparations get under way for the Club's Bicentenary Regatta to be held in 2015.\n\nFounded in 1815 the Club will mark its 200 years with an invitational regatta during 25th - 31st July 2015 at its historic home in Cowes with racing on the Solent and a race around the Isle of Wight. The Royal Yacht Squadron has invited 25 clubs from 19 countries to send crews to the event with the option of taking part in a one design regatta with yachts provided by the Organising Authority or participating in IRC racing. Additionally two crews of four aged up to 30 from up to ten of the invited clubs will take part in a J80 team racing competition.\n\nThe 2015 Transatlantic Race, organised by the Royal Yacht Squadron, the New York Yacht Club , the Royal Ocean Racing Club and the Storm Trysail Club, is expected to attract a good number of entries who will use the race from Newport, RI as a feeder event to the Solent.\n\nThe regatta is open to Transatlantic Race participants rated up to IRC 1.850, while larger yachts can take part in the Race Around the Island. Yachts from the invited clubs will race in IRC 1.050 - 1.850 and two boat club teams can be formed in the rating band 1.050 to 1.350.\n\nA very high level of interest has already been shown in the event. A number of J-Class yachts have indicated their interest in taking part in the Bicentenary Regatta, and Nautor's Swan will be adding the Transatlantic Race to their 2015 ClubSwan calendar with a provisional plan to have a Swan class in the regatta.\n\nThe RYS Bicentenary Regatta will be held two weeks before the annual Aberdeen Asset Management Cowes Week regatta and the Rolex Fastnet Race.\n\nThe 2015 Bicentenary Regatta pages will be launched on the RYS website rys.org.uk shortly.\n\nFeatured Brokerage\n\n1990 Nordia 57.

Click on image for photo gallery.\n\nThe fleet of the 32nd Copa del Rey MAPFRE has from today a new participant. H.R.H. Prince Felipe has joined the regatta this morning as skipper of Spanish Navy's \"Aifos\" in the class Hublot IRC 1, one of the three fleets that have competed today in the coastal race, along with the Hublot IRC 0 and Gaastra IRC 52. All monotypes have been able to fulfill its program of two windward/leeward races, while the two G.H. Mumm IRC classes had to settle with a single race sailed.\n\nWith the first half of the regatta program raced, the provisional leaders are: British \"Jethou\" in the class Hublot IRC 0, Italian \"B2\" in Hublot IRC 1, American \"Quantum Racing\" in Gaastra IRC 52, German \"Elena Nova\" in G.H.

Photo by Joel Ahrweiler. Click on image to enlarge.\n\nOrganised by the Royal Ocean Racing Club, 86 yachts in the Channel Race experienced thunder, lightning and all manner of wind conditions, which produced a complex 100 mile race in The Solent and offshore along the south west coast of England.\n\nPascal Loison's JPK 10.10, Night and Day, was the overall winner of the Channel Race. The French team have excelled winning class in their last three RORC races. However Pascal was not on board for the Channel Race, his son Alexis and Joel Ahrweiler were the crew. Sensationally Night and Day won the overall prize, IRC Three and the Two Handed Class.\n\nIn IRC Canting Keel two goliaths had a monumental match race, with the lead on the water changing on many occasions. Andy Budgen's British Volvo 70, Monster Project, had an early set back when one of the crew suffered a hand injury requiring medical attention but the team fought back to challenge IMOCA 60, Artemis Ocean Racing. In a sprint finish, Monster Project passed Artemis Ocean Racing to take Line Honours for the class by under seven minutes but, on corrected time, the class win went to the young crew on board Artemis Ocean Racing.\n\nIn IRC Zero Harm Prins' Volvo 60, Pleomax, had a memorable race pacing the canting keel class around the track and finishing the course in the fastest elapsed time. Pleomax won IRC Zero to extend their lead for the RORC Season's Points Championship, as the Dutch team corrected out to win by just over 6 minutes from Derek Saunders' British CM60, Venomous. Dutch Volvo 60, Team Heiner One, was third.\n\nIn IRC One Piet Vroon's Dutch Ker 46, Tonnerre de Breskens 3, took line honours by some distance but after time correction the current leader for the RORC Season's Points Championship could only score 6th place for the race.\n\nRORC Admiral Andrew McIrvine racing British First 40, La Reponse, was triumphant in IRC Two, after a close battle with the British Army Sailing Association's J/111, British Soldier, and former RORC Commodore Peter Rutter racing Grand Soleil 43, Trustmarque Quokka.\n\nNight and Day was the winner of IRC Three with Jerome Huillard's French A35, Prime Time, second in class and third overall for the race and John Allison's J/109, Jumbuck, third in IRC Three. Night and Day also won the Two Handed Class with David Gebbett's Dehler 36, Krackpot, in second place and the Artemis Offshore Academy's Figaro II, Artemis 21, in third.\n\nIn IRC Four Andy Theobald's Sigma 362, Nokomis, corrected out to win the class ahead of Kevin Sussmilch's Sigma 38, Mefisto, and Chris Choules' Sigma 38, With Alacrity. -- Louay Habib\n\nwww.rorc.org\n\nMarinepool - Clothing Partner of the Extreme Sailing Series\n\nMarinepool is widely regarded as one of the leading sailing clothing and maritime lifestyle brands and is the \"Official Clothing Partner\" of the Extreme Sailing Series™.\n\nWe have built a reputation for outstanding quality, excellent service and quick and reliable deliveries.

Click on image to enlarge.\n\nRupert Holmes looks ahead to the tides for this year's Aberdeen Asset Management Cowes Week, and takes a look at the weather and changes to the Sailing Instructions...\n\nHigh water on the opening day is 10:05, so for the first few days of the regatta, the entire start sequence will see the tide setting to the west. At the same time, water levels will be falling during the racing, so be careful if sailing in shallow water to avoid an adverse tidal stream.\n\nLater in the week tides become larger and move later in the day, with high water on the final day at 14:30. This means that early starters will progressively be starting in slack or east-going stream, with the inshore eddy that forms close to the shore likely to play an important part in White Group starts - make sure you have the best tidal information you can find.\n\nWhile it's too early to predict exactly what's likely to happen with the weather this year, early indications are of a ridge of high pressure pushing northwards over the south coast, shielding the Solent from more inclement weather that may affect areas further north in the UK. At the same time, the indications are of a sufficiently strong pressure gradient to give perfect winds for racing, most likely a force 4 or 5 over the first few days.\n\nFollowing a general simplification of the Sailing Instructions over the past few years, there are relatively few changes for this year's event. The biggest of these, however, will affect all Black Group competitors, as the start line is moved further east than last year, to the south of the Bramble Bank. It's again shorter than it has traditionally been, and is now known as the Bramble line.\n\nIt's worth getting along to the skippers' briefings at the Events Centre in Cowes Yacht Haven - these are at 18:30 on Friday 2 August for White Group Classes and at 19:30 for Black Group competitors.\n\nAnyone still thinking about entering for this year still has time to do so. Entries are accepted until 17:00 the day before any given day of racing but entries received after 17:00 on Wednesday 31st July must be made in person at the Regatta Centre.\n\nwww.aamcowesweek.co.uk\n\nOldest Known 470 Takes To Water, But No Breeze For Racing\n\nPhoto by Breschi / SRR. Click on image to enlarge.\n\nHot, humid and no wind was the order of play here in La Rochelle on race day 3 of the 470 Junior World Championships. The Masters' Cup and Open Classic fleets were enjoying a day off, but for the junior fleets it was a long wait hoping for a breeze that never materialized.\n\nRacing was called off at 1540 hours, with the Race Committee hoisting AP over A.\n\nRacing at the 470 Junior World Championships will resume on Thursday 1 August, with three races planned and a scheduled start time of 0930 hours for the women, followed by the men's gold and silver fleets. The Masters' Cup and Open Classic fleets will race another two races, with the first start scheduled for 1400 hours. The forecast is for 9-10 knots from the south, veering a bit east, to end the day from the south west.\n\nThe star performance today went to the oldest known 470, sail #13 which was built in 1964 by Jean Morin and has been meticulously maintained by its owner. Christian Piot and Nicolas Guichet, author of the 470 Great Book, were onboard and took their stately lady for a sail near the old harbour of La Rochelle.\n\nWhen not on the water, 470 #13 is part of the historic line up of 470s tracing the boat's evolution from 1964 to the present day in a shoreside exhibition. Everything on #13 is original, including the buoyancy aids worn by the crew today.\n\nFollowing on from the 1964 boat, the next oldest 470 was built in 1972 also by Jean Morin, and is practically a modern 470 with fittings that are used today. Onto 1981 and we have a 470 from Fountaine Pajot, one of the most popular builders at the time. Next in the line-up is the 1988 Olympic Gold medal winning 470, which was sailed to victory by France's Thierry Peponnet/Luc Pillot in Seoul and now belongs to Club Nautique d'Ablon. The renowned Peponnet/Pillot team also won the 1984 Olympic bronze medal and were the 1986 World Champions and will be one of the teams taking part in the Legends' Trophy on Sunday 4 August. Move on a decade and we have another iconic French boat, the 470 sailed to 1998 World Championship gold by Gildas Phillippe/Tanguy Cariou, which now belongs to Nicolas Guichet. The exhibition ends with a bang up to date 470 built in 2012, showcasing the very latest in technology and on loan from Nautivela.\n\nworlds.470.org\n\nClipper Race Stop In Albany\n\nClick on image to enlarge.\n\nThe 2013-14 edition of the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race will stop in Albany, Western Australia, at the end of Leg 3 from Cape Town later this year.\n\nAmateur crew from all walks of life competing in the 40,000-mile Clipper Race will be welcomed with a community festival at Albany's waterfront marina in late November after completing the notorious 'Southern Ocean Sleigh Ride' leg from Cape Town.\n\nCity of Albany Mayor, Dennis Wellington, said the Clipper Race's global focus will provide a great opportunity for Albany to position itself as an international tourist destination.\n\nSir Robin Knox-Johnston, the chairman and founder of the Clipper Race: \"I first heard of Albany 45 years ago in October 1968 during my solo non-stop Golden Globe circumnavigation as I was sailing past and heard about the wool auctions there from the local radio.\n\n\"That created a curiosity to see the town and the Clipper Race visit will give me that opportunity at last. The crews are looking forward to enjoying the legendary hospitality of Western Australia.\"\n\nThe Clipper 13-14 Race will set off from St Katharine Docks, in front of Tower Bridge in London on Sunday, 1 September on a 40,000-mile journey around the globe.\n\nwww.clipperroundtheworld.com\n\nUV Protection.

Three races were held on the four courses simultaneously but with differing winds as they were spread across Kaløvig Bay\n\nWith a noon start for all, the first races were held in light to moderate breeze on the Bronze and Emerald courses while the Silver and Gold had 6-8 knots. Two small rain squalls crossed the course bringing rain, increased wind with puffs to 18, and shifty conditions for the sailors and Race Committee to monitor. Once the squalls had passed the wind dropped again below 10 knots with enough to complete the scheduled races.\n\nLeaders of the other fleets are: Silver - Don and Dylan Whitcraft (THA); Bronze - Joshua Belben and Robert Masterman (GBR); Emerald - Marco and Matteo Bucalossi (ITA).\n\nAfter racing, the sailors were able to meet 2008 49er Gold Medallist Martin Kirketerp (DEN) and try on the medal for a photo with future aspirations of their own in the 49er or 49erFX.\n\nTwenty-five nations are representing all continents with 213 entries in this highly competitive fleet.\n\nThe finals continue on Thursday, August 1 followed by one more day of the final series.\n\nwww.29erworlds.org\n\nPink Kite on Day One of SB20 Grand Slam\n\nClick on image to enlarge.\n\nThe SB20 UK Association is delighted to confirm the return of the \"pink kite\" to the SB20 Grand Slam at Aberdeen Asset Management Cowes Week.

Four races were held starting at 3pm after a postponement on shore waiting for a front to pass, but leaving behind light winds for the sailors.\n\nIn the Gold fleet, Lucas Rual and Emile Amoros (FRA) sailed a consistent day of 13-2-1-13 to regain the lead after falling yesterday in the standings. 6 knots across the course persisted through the first three races with the wind shifting 90 degrees to the north and increasing in strength to 10 knots. The conditions pushed the sailors to perform at their best and the results rewarded those who did. Nick Muller and Kai Frieseke (USA) moved up in the standings to third overall by sailing a 10-5-5-6 series while Kiwis Marcus Somerville and Jack Simpson were able to maintain second overall. Previous days leaders Jack Colley and Shaun Connor (AUS) had a more difficult day and used the last race as their discard and have dropped to 4th overall.\n\nSilver fleet leaders are Tomas and Mads Mathisen of Norway with Bronze leaders Douglas Campbell and Cameron Seagreen from Australia. Var Osborg and Eric Collet (NOR) lead the Emerald fleet. The top female team remains Ragna and Maia Agerup of Norway.\n\nTwenty-five nations are representing all continents with 213 entries in this highly competitive fleet.\n\nThe final race and prizegiving will be tomorrow, Friday, August 2.\n\nLive reports and daily results can be found on www.29erworlds.org\n\nCowes Classics Week\n\nPhoto by Tim Jeffreys.

We are reliably informed that the metre classes (12s, 8s and 6s) have not raced in the same regatta since Cowes Week 1939!\n\nThis is now a truly international event with boats and crews coming from the US, Australia, France, Belgium and Ireland. The UK boats came from as far as Perthshire.\n\nThe largest classes were the Solent Sunbeams at 20 (celebrating their 90th anniversary), XODs at 38 and Classic Cruisers at 16.\n\nThe last race day, Friday dawned with a good easterly breeze and racing started on time with three races being achieved for the smaller boats enabling them to catch up so a total of six races counted for the series before discard for all the classes apart from the Classic Cruisers who had four races. The Harken prizes were awarded to the winners of the first race of the day.\n\nThe official charity this year was the Andrew Cassell Foundation for Paralympic Sailing. Friday was Andrew Cassell Foundation Race Day.

At this writing no one has any idea which of Artemis Racing or Luna Rossa will advance to the final against Emirates Team New Zealand. But in this first elimination round, one team will go forward, while the other will be finished competing.\n\nIt's important to remember the AC72 class catamarans are new for everyone. Each day the teams learn something new. One of the big questions for team managers is when to make changes to a boat. The whole concept is to sail faster, but the history of sailing shows that America's Cup teams sometimes make progress and sometimes take a step backwards. There is a long history of designers making mistakes.\n\nIn 1962, for example, Nefertiti was winning the early trials. Skipper and designer Ted Hood decided to add ballast for the August trials. Unfortunately, for his team the wind went light in August. Nefertiti was too heavy and lost.\n\nThis kind of story will certainly be in the minds of the designers here in San Francisco too. On the other side of the equation there are many stories about America's Cup teams that have made late improvements that ended up making the difference. The pressure will be on to make good decisions every day.\n\nFor all fans of the America's Cup it will be great fun to watch how each team responds to their performance on the water. You can be sure that every sailor, designer and manager will be working hard to make the correct choice. -- Gary Jobson\n\namericascup.com\n\nCopa Del Rey MAPFRE\n\nPhoto by Nico Martinez, http://www.martinezstudio.es Thursday was the fourth day of competition of the 32nd Copa del Rey MAPFRE in Palma de Mallorca. The fleet completed the regatta program established by the Race Committee, with two windward/leeward races for all classes except for the G.H. Mumm ORC 1 and ORC 2, which sailed a coastal race. The Mahou J80 and La Caixa X-35 classes reached their eighth race, which means they can discard their worst result of the week. \"Aifos\", skippered by the Prince of Spain, signed its first victory of the week and stands fourth overall in the Hublot IRC 1 class.\n\nWith only two days left until the end of the regatta, the provisional overall results are headed by British \"Alegre\" in the Hublot IRC 0 class, Italian \"B2\" in Hublot IRC 1, American \"Quantum Racing\" in Gaastra IRC 52, Spanish \"Rats on Fire \"in G.H. Mumm ORC 1, \"Movistar\" in G.H. Mumm ORC 2, and \"Vamos Spain\" in Nespresso Soto 40, Italian \"Margherita\" in La Caixa X-35 and Spanish \"Turismo do Algarve\" in Mahou J80.\n\nThe regatta program for the 32nd Copa del Rey MAPFRE continues tomorrow on its fifth day of competition. The entire fleet will compete in windward/leeward races, with the first start scheduled at 13h00. The regatta will finish on Saturday.\n\nFull results: www.regatacopadelrey.com\n\nwww.regatacopadelrey.com\n\n* With two days of scheduled racing remaining for the 52 SUPER SERIES at Palma, Mallorca's showcase 32nd Copa del Rey MAPFRE, Quantum Racing's lead grew a little more thanks to back to back wins in typical Palma sea breeze conditions.\n\nAs a crew Quantum Racing have never won the prestigious Copa del Rey but increasingly it is looking like they are piecing together a winning campaign.\n\nStrategist Jordi Calafat, Olympic gold medallist and America's Cup winner has only won once - last year with Jochen Schuemann on All4ONE - in more than 25 years of trying.\n\nTactician Terry Hutchinson's best successes on the Bay of Palma include consecutive victories in the 2008 Breitling Regatta on the MedCup Circuit then steering the 52 El Desafio to victory in the Copa del Rey in consecutive weeks.\n\nThe team, under skipper-helm Ed Baird has now won four races back to back from seven starts, today elevating themselves to be six points clear of Niklas and Catherine Zennström's Ran Racing which scored a 2,3 for the day.\n\n32nd Copa del Rey MAPFRE - Gaastra IRC 52 Class\n\n1.

Of these the European-flagged Esimit Europa 2 is the clear favourite: Both boats are fitted with canting keels and are 100ft long, but she is some 40% lighter than ICAP Leopard.\n\nHowever Esimit Europa 2's skipper, German three time Olympic medallist Jochen Schumann observes that the 100ft maxis don't have the greatest record on this course. Rambler 100 broke her keel and capsized just after rounding the Fastnet Rock in 2011 while, in her previous life as Neville Crichton's Alfa Romeo, Esimit Europa 2 was forced to pull out while leading the 2007 race.\n\n\"We are unbeatable unless we break the boat,\" admits Schumann, adding that Esimit Europa 2's ideal conditions are light to medium. \"From 12-14 knots we are fully loaded and then we start reefing and slowing down the boat. In more wind than that the VO70s could be faster reaching or downwind than we are. In heavy breeze, it will be a really tough competition.\"\n\nSchumann competed in the Rolex Fastnet Race during the 1990s aboard the ILC40 Aerosail and on the IMS50 Rubin XV.\n\nHowever leading these monohulls around the race course are some superfast multihulls, including the two fastest offshore race boats in the world. The 40m long trimaran, then called Banque Populaire Maxi, set a new multihull course record, reaching Plymouth first in just 32 hours 48 minutes two years ago. This boat, now called Spindrift 2, is back but in the hands of co-skippers Dona Bertarelli and Yann Guichard.\n\nThe Banque Populaire team is also back, but with another trimaran, this time the more compact 31.5m long former Groupama 3. In her previous guise this boat set a new record for sailing fastest non-stop around the world and incredibly her skipper then, Franck Cammas went on to sail her singlehanded (albeit with a shorter rig), winning the 2010 Route du Rhum.\n\nSurprisingly, despite these two boats having been on the water, even operating out of the same homeport, for the last five years, the Rolex Fastnet Race is the first occasion they will race in anger. -- James Boyd, TheDailySail.com\n\nfastnet.rorc.org\n\nISAF Nations Cup\n\nMiddelfart, Denmark: The Nations Cup begins next week (Tuesday, August 6-10) in Middelfart, Denmark, with 10 countries represented in a highly competitive field of skippers.\n\nAustralia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and USA will contest the Open competition and Brazil, Denmark, Norway and USA, the women's competition.\n\nThe opening ceremony will take place on the evening of Tuesday, August 6 with racing from Wednesday, August 7 to finals day on Saturday, August 10.\n\nCrown Prince Frederik of Denmark will be contesting an exhibition match on August 8, skippering an Olympic class team of Danish legends, including Jesper Bank.

The bulk of the fleet stayed well to the west of the line, with all but one boat holding well back until less than 20 seconds before the gun. Rob Elliott's Esprit was first to hoist the spinnaker, but crossed four seconds early - an expensive mistake, especially as she did not return following the recall. Andrew and Donna Cooper's Ice looked well placed a few minutes after the start, followed by Elvis, skippered by Tim Daughton, with both boats on a tight spinnaker reach towards West Ryde Middle buoy.\n\nBy the finish it was Mark Downer's Moonlight, who stayed further offshore after the start, trading a tidal disadvantage for a steadier wind, who came out on top, finishing 23 seconds ahead of Esprit. With the latter scored OCS, Rob Goddard's Stampede took second place, crossing the line 45 seconds after Moonlight, and Shaun Frolich's Exabyte V third. It was a close race, with the first half of the fleet finishing in little more than three minutes.\n\nNot long after 1400 there was a rapid string of Black Group yachts finishing close to shore and under spinnaker on the RYS line. One of the highest-rated boats in IRC Class 4, Adam Gosling's newly refurbished 18-year-old Corby 36 Yes!, took line honours in that class. However, the lowest-rated boat in the fleet, last year's overall class winner, David Franks' Strait Dealer, finished less than 10 minutes later to win by a margin of just 18 seconds on corrected time.\n\nThe Sigma 33 class proved once again that this 34-year-old one design cruiser-racer is capable of providing extremely close competition. After almost three hours of racing, Jeff Worboys' Workout crossed the line just eight seconds ahead of Richard Puddifoot's Whippa Snappa. -- Rupert Holmes / CWL\n\nwww.cowes.co.uk\n\naamcowesweek.co.uk (busy server at press time, could not retrieve day 2...)\n\nCopa Del Rey MAPFRE\n\nThe 32nd Copa del Rey MAPFRE finished today on the sixth day of competition in the Bay of Palma.

This time he takes the victory in the class Hublot IRC 0, after an intense duel with Sir Peter Ogden's, also British, \"Jethou\".\n\nHublot IRC 1: \"B2\"\n\nMichele Galli's \"B2\" confirmed his place in the Hublot IRC 1 class by winning the only race sailed today. The Italian boat finished the 32nd Copa del Rey MAPFRE winning seven out of ten races.\n\nGaastra IRC 52: \"Quantum Racing\"\n\n\"Quantum Racing\" scored a second and a first result today in order to be declared winner of the 32nd Copa del Rey MAPFRE in the Gaastra IRC 52 class. The boat skippered by Ed Baird, won six out of the 11 races sailed, finishing the regatta seven points ahead of Niklas Zennstrom's \"Ran\" (SWE).\n\nG.H. Mumm ORC 1: \"Rats on Fire\"\n\n\"Rats on Fire\" made it very clear he is the winner of the 32nd Copa del Rey MAPFRE in the G.H. Mumm ORC 1 class winning the last race. Rafael Carbonell's boat track record this week of competition includes five out of ten possible victories, and a fifth as their worst result.\n\nG.H. Mumm ORC 2: \"Movistar\"\n\nTeam \"Movistar\" has achieved its fifth title in the Copa del Rey MAPFRE, sixth for its owner and skipper Pedro Campos.\n\nNespresso Soto 40: \"Vamos Spain\"\n\nLuis Martin Cabiedes' \"Vamos Spain\", skippered by Pichu Torcida, has achieved an excellent overall victory after a very consistent week, and with a fifth as their worst result.\n\nLa Caixa X-35: \"Margherita\"\n\nRoberto Mazzucato's \"Margherita\" defended its title from 2012 after a wonderful week where all his results were above third.\n\nMahou J80: \"Turismo do Algarve\"\n\nThe Mahou J80 Class had a main protagonist throughout the whole week: \"Turismo do Algarve\" skippered by Portuguese Hugo Rocha.

Practice race starts had been arranged with Luna Rossa but the Italians returned to the dock before they could take place.\n\nDean Barker: \"We were set up today to practice with Luna Rossa; we hadn't discussed sailing with Artemis.\" With Luna Rossa heading back to the dock and Artemis was practising time-on-distance nearby a shouted conversation across the water quickly arranged another training partner.\n\nBarker was more than happy with the arrangement. \" Artemis was keen to get into it ...it's always good to practice with another team. We learned a lot today from a different opponent. Artemis was aggressive in the pre-start and the five starts added another dimension to the team's development.\"\n\nArtemis faces off against Luna Rossa in the semi-finals of the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger series. The first race is on Tuesday (San Francisco time).\n\nETNZ will be back on the water tomorrow to continue preparations for the Louis Vuitton Cup final which starts on August 17. -- Warren Douglas\n\namericascup.com\n\netnzblog.com\n\nMedieval Boat Discovered On River Chet\n\nClick on image to enlarge.\n\nThe remains of a boat which could be more than 600 years old has been discovered by a team excavating a new drainage dyke in Norfolk.\n\nThe oak timber remnants, dated circa 1400, were found near Loddon during work on the Broadland Flood Alleviation Project (BFAP) along the River Chet.\n\nThe BFAP is a long-term project to provide a range of flood defence improvements, maintenance and emergency response services within the tidal areas of the Rivers Yare, Bure, Waveney and their tributaries.\n\nPaul Mitchelmore, from the Environment Agency, said the boat was the latest of \"several interesting archaeological finds\" encountered during the project.\n\n\"We think it dates between 1400 and 1600 AD and is very well preserved. It might have been used for carrying lighter good on the river.\"\n\n\"Some of the planks on the side of the boat are quite loosely in place so we'll be removing them separately to put into wet storage,\" said Ms Wallis.\n\n\"In the long term we hope it will go for conservation and end up in one of Norfolk's museums.\"\n\nwww.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-23526192\n\nBritish Airways Round Jersey Race\n\nThe Royal Channel Islands Yacht Club's annual British Airways Round Jersey Race is scheduled to take place next Sunday, 11th August. This will be the nineteenth year that BA has sponsored this very popular race that will see the racing fleet turning out in force for the forty-mile-or-so circumnavigation of the Island. Starting in St Aubin's Bay at eight a.m., the course takes boats eastwards to the Violet Channel buoy, lying some four miles southeast of the Island, thence northwards for an anticlockwise passage around Jersey providing a great opportunity to enjoy the Island's truly beautiful and ever-changing scenery.\n\nSailing in light to moderate northeasterly conditions, David Myatt's 8 Metre, Erica, won in class one last year with a time of seven and a half hours whilst Peter Crabb and Peter Williams' quarter tonner, Jackflash, won in class 2 having sailed for a little under eight hours. Adrian Jesson and Bruce Steedman, sailing the Hobie Tiger Hobie 68, won the sport-catamaran class in six hours twenty minutes, admittedly a far cry from the three hours six minutes record set in 2010 in much more boisterous conditions by Guernsey's Benn Garnham's Tiger Poker Face but surely no less skilful.\n\nBoats in class one will be racing for the RCIYC's prestigious Jesse Boot trophy (presented to the Club in the '30s by Jesse Boot, founder of Boots the Chemist), boats in class 2 for the no less ancient Cabot Memorial trophy whilst sports-catamarans will compete for the British Airways Speedbird trophy.\n\nThe race is open to all keelboats with an IRC rating, non-IRC boats racing under the RYA's National Handicap for Cruisers scheme and to sport-catamarans.\n\nThe Notice of Race is available in the clubs and on www.rciycjersey.com\n\nThe entry list closes on Thursday, 8th August.\n\nFeatured Brokerage\n\n2007 Corby 33.

All 60 entries from 8 countries divided into three classes raced a 5-leg 9.5-mile windward-leeward course in Race 1, while Classes 1 and 2 raced an 8.0-mile 5-leg course in Race 2 and Class 3 races a 4-leg 6.4-mile course.\n\n\"Except for two general recalls and a black flag start to Race 1 for the 30 eager entries in Class 3, the fleet got off to a great start this week,\" said PRO Eckard Reinke. \"The wind filled in faster than we thought, so there were no delays needed except for spacing the starts to minimize the traffic in the course area.\"\n\nOne way to avoid this traffic was to have the largest and fastest boat on the course, which no doubt helped Thomas Nilsson's Norwegian team on their TP52 Trucknor Wolfpack to take two first place finishes in Class 1. The team has been well-honed after years of racing together, but suffered a setback yesterday when their regular tactician had to rush home to Norway on a family emergency.\n\nLeading Class 2 on consistent scores of 2-2 is Priit Tammemagi's Estonian X-41 Premium, but the competition is not far behind: Bengt Falkenberg's Swedish First 40 from Gothenburg Teknova/Albatross Racing is only one point back on 4-1, and Silva another 3 points behind the Swedes.\n\nWith 30 boats on the starting line, Class 3 will always be crowded this week, but the early favorites are already starting to rise to the top after two races.\n\nMikhel Kosk's Estonian NM38 Sugar has taken an early lead on scores of 4-1, but this only on a tie-break with Martin Nilsson's Swedish Salona 37 Feelgood, who has a 2-3 scoreline.\n\nTomorrow racing will not start until early afternoon as teams prepare for the offshore race, to be sailed in two parts: the first start will be 50-60 miles and is intended to be sailed overnight with a scoring gate. The race then continues for a length determined tomorrow by race managers as they evaluate the weather forecast and look at course and mark options available in the outer archipelago. The overall race length is intended to be about 24 hours in duration, so exact length will be dependent on weather, and the race managers may set a length which may appear long but will have the option to be shortened at any mark. -- Dobbs Davis\n\nwww.ksss.se\n\nwww.orc.org\n\nCowes Week\n\nClick on image to enlarge.\n\nThe third day of Aberdeen Asset Management Cowes Week dawned with unpromising weather forecasts - at one stage the Met Office's Inshore Waters forecast predicted winds up to Force 9 - although in the event the strongest gusts were below 25 knots and in line with the regatta's meteorologist Fiona Campbell's predictions.\n\nThe Redwing class is again one of the biggest and most competitive White Group fleets. A minute before the start, four boats were already positioned on the line and were soon joined by more. At the gun, three boats were the wrong side of the line, including one of the top two boats after the first couple of days of racing and last year's overall winner, John Raymond and Matt Alexander's Harlequin. Only one boat, George Greenwood's Rosetta, returned to restart.\n\nJames Axtell and Lucy Benham's Paroquet, and Roderick and Henry Thorpe's Redwitch initially looked well placed. However, as with earlier starts it was the two inshore boats - Bruce Huber's Quail and Rupert and Michael MacInnes' Avocet - that were first to get the benefit of the wind funnelling out of the Medina estuary and quickly pulled ahead into a useful early lead. Huber was also ahead at the finish, leading Caroline and Edmund Peel's Redstart ll and Andrew, Sabrina and Edward Eddy's Plover over the line.\n\nAt one sta"
