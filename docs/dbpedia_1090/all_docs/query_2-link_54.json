        "text": "MULTI 50: A new race reserved for Multi 50s has been created: the Vendée Saint-Petersburg. The first edition of the race is due to start from Saint Gilles Croix-de-Vie on 16th May with a total distance there and back of 3790 miles. Eight crews will be lining up at the start, including two of the latest racing machines in the class: Actual and Crêpes Whaou !\n\nWhile most races see the competitors heading off to the west to cross the Atlantic, Vendée has come up with something new offering a brand new route to the Multi 50s, (50-foot trimarans), with the Atlantic, the English Channel, the North Sea and the Baltic ahead of them. In all, the race will cover the territorial waters of 14 countries before they finish in Saint-Petersburg in Russia on around 20th May 2010. The best boats like Franck-Yves Escoffier’s new Crêpes Whaou ! and Yves le Blevec’s Actual could complete the first stage of the race in less than five days at an average speed of 16 knots. The race will be holding a stopover for around ten days in Russia, before the start of the return leg on 31st May 2010, with the finish forecast in the port of Saint-Gilles Croix de Vie on around 4th June 2010. Sunday 30th May is a date to remember: It marks the anniversary of the founding of Saint-\n\nPetersburg by Tsar Peter 1st, and the Multi 50s will carry out a parade on the Neva, under the windows of the famous Hermitage museum.\n\nWith a crew of three\n\nThe other original feature of this race between Vendée/Saint-Petersburg is that it will be raced with a crew of three sailors, and the members of the crew can switch over between the two legs. Mathias Lallemand has been appointed as Race Director, after serving as Assistant Director for the last two editions of the Vendée Globe and the Solitaire du Figaro. He will be able to count on the expertise of Alain Gautier, who will be the safety consultant for the event. It should be noted that the official race website will be updated in French and English, but also in Russian.\n\n8 crews registered\n\nFor the moment, eight Multi 50 crews have already signed up for this very first edition of the Vendée/Saint-Petersburg. Alongside Yves Le Blevec (Actual) and Franck-Yves Escoffier (Crêpes Whaou !), there will be Hervé Cléris (CLM), Erwan Leroux (Fenêtréa-Cardinal), Anne Caseneuve (Croisières Anne Caseneuve), Etienne Hochédé (PIR2), Philippe Laperche (Gamin) and Lalou Roucayrol (Région Aquitaine-Port Médoc).\n\nFor the locals in Vendée\n\nWe can note also that his race, which is due to take place every four years alternating with the Vendée Globe, is an initiative from the Vendée Council, which – as with the Vendée\n\nGlobe – has created a public-private partnership for the event. Around fifteen famous firms based in Vendée are joining with the Vendée Council and have invested in this partnership taking up 17% of the share capital. According to its founders, the Vendée/Saint-Petersburg race fulfils three requirements: “Creating a sporting event, widening the reputation of Vendée as a tourist destination and encouraging economic development.” Around forty business leaders from Vendée will be taking part in a business mission to Russia, and an organisation will be receiving the Russian visitors at the foot of the Peter and Paul Fortress.\n\n- Number taking part: 8 crews, FY Escoffier, Y Le Blévec, E Le Roux, H Cléris, A Caseneuve, L Roucayrol, P Laperche, E Hochédé.\n\n- Crewed race for three, with the possibility of changing crew in Saint-Petersburg.\n\n- Start on 16th May 2010 from Saint Gilles Croix-de-Vie: finish expected in Saint-Petersburg around 23rd-24th May 2010.\n\n- Start from Saint-Petersburg on 31st May 2010: finish expected in Saint Gilles Croix-de-Vie around 6th – 7th June 2010.\n\nWhat they said:\n\nPhilippe de Villiers, President of the Vendée Council: “Just as with the Vendée Globe, this is a race for the general public. It is aimed at the public, sailors and their teams, and is for all those, who love the oceans. I’m increasingly convinced that this is the start of a big adventure. If the Multi50 class has a bright future, this race too will also have a great future.”\n\nFranck Yves Escoffier, President of the Multi50 class: “This is going to be a very technical and tactical race. It is an extremely interesting route, as it takes the fleet northwards. The skipper and his crew of two will have to be very vigilant in these waters, with their strong currents, and with boats, fishermen and cargo vessels everywhere. But we can look forward to having a great time.”\n\nPhilippe Laperche, skipper: “If I had to choose between a transatlantic race and the Vendée\n\nSaint-Petersburg, I would have chosen the Vendée Saint-Petersburg without the slightest hesitation!”\n\nFor more information, log on to http://www.vendee-saintpetersbourg.org/ (website up and running in mid-April).\n\nEVOLUTION RACING in Causeway Bay the day before the Race start EVOLUTION RACING AUS 8898 TP52 Ray Roberts\n\nMore than a few boats took to Victoria Harbour today to practice in advance of Thursday’s start of the 25th edition of the Rolex China Sea Race. Winds permitting, the 30-boat fleet will start at 1210 off the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club, with the cityfront providing a dramatic backdrop and tactically challenging conditions, with the seagoing traffic providing obstacles to avoid.\n\nAt tonight’s Skipper’s Briefing, RHKYC Race Manager Alex Johnston gave last minute instructions to the crews on race course, safety and weather. Daniel Yeung from the Hong Kong Observatory reviewed the forecast for the race area over the next several days. The general forecast for tomorrow’s race start calls for southeasterly winds, 7 – 10 knots. The monsoon that is currently dominating the South China Sea is going to moderate, which will create a ridge of high pressure, though it is possible that there will be significant breeze well east of the rhumbline.\n\nThe fleet is divided into five divisions including IRC A, B, C, IRC Premier Cruising, and IRC Cruising. Last year’s overall winner, Ernesto Echauz’ Subic Centennial (PHI) and Line Honours winner Neil Pryde on Hi Fi (HKG) are both back to defend their titles. Hi Fi, with Will Oxley on as navigator, is sporting a new bulb, mast and modified cabin top.\n\nThere are quite a few boats with an eye on the prize this year including three TP52s, Ray Roberts’ Evolution Racing (AUS), Sam Chan’s Ffreefire 52 (HKG) and Geoff Hill’s Strewth (AUS), as well as two of the highly-regarded French-built Archambault sport boats, Avant Garde (HKG), an A40RC, and American Anthony Root’s Red Kite II (HKG), an A35.\n\nStrewth is back after a dramatic retirement in the 2008 race, when both keel bolts sheered off and the keel and bulb dropped away, 150 miles from the start. Displaying impressive sailing skills, the skipper and crew kept the boat upright, turned around, and motored safely back to Hong Kong, escorted by Olivier Decamps’ on Cloud.\n\nHill recalled, “We were really, really lucky. We had a good helmsman on the boat, who naturally steered the boat up into the breeze, basically depowering the boat. We put a guy over the side and did all the safety stuff. We learned a few things out of that, as a few weeks before I had done my Sea Safety and Survival course and so we did all the proper sea safety stuff and it was relatively automatic. That, I think, contributed to the fact we didn’t have any loss of life, and the boat didn’t sink. We filled the water tanks and centre lined everything (to help stabilize the boat)…I figure I’ve lost eight of my nine sailing lives.”\n\nSince then, Strewth has had a few modifications including an escape hatch in the stern, and installation of a new, similar keel though with 12 bolts (instead of two). Hill said it took 12 months to get the boat back in shape, and since then they have competed in several races on the Asian circuit. Hill says it’s been a learning curve getting the boat back up to speed, though he has hardly been idle, also competing on his MKL49 in this past Rolex Sydney Hobart Race. For this race he’s brought on Australian Lindsay May as tactician (winning skipper of 2006 Rolex Sydney Hobart Race on Love & War), as well as a strong group of Australian sailors.\n\nWhile Strewth is the scratch boat in the fleet, the biggest boat is Ffreefire, the 71-foot sled (ex-Pyewacket), skippered by sailing legend Sir Robin Knox-Johnston. In the late 1960’s, Knox-Johnston became the first person to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world, aboard the 32-foot yacht Suhaili, after 312 days at sea. The 72-year old Knox-Johnston has received numerous awards over a long and illustrious career, including ISAF Rolex World Sailor of the Year in 1994 and inauguration into the ISAF Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nKnox-Johnston’s reason for coming to Hong Kong to compete in the Rolex China Sea was pretty simple: “A friend chartered the boat and asked if I’d like to join him, and I thought, ‘I could do with a break’. It’s irresistible, it’s a nice race to do. There is a lot of luck (in the race) and the previous two times I’ve done it we’ve had quite good boats, but not won, because you just go into holes. The skill is trying to avoid the holes.” As a former around-the-world solo sailor it’s interesting to hear him say, “I’m doing it because I enjoy good company, I enjoy a good race, and this gives me both. I like sprints, I like these short races.”\n\nKnox-Johnston has a keen interest in youth sailing and he reflected on the growth of the sport in China, “What we’re seeing in Asia are small pockets of enthusiastic sailors. What needs to happen for sailing to grow, as it has in the West, is from the bottom up. You almost have to put sailing in the school curriculum and let the youngsters get the pleasure that we get. Once that starts to happen you’ll build up a cadre of good young sailors and those ones will start to lead the others into it.”\n\nFfreefire 70 has only two results from the China Sea Race, a Line Honours win in 1998 and 1st in IRC in 2004. The boat has a better record in the San Fernando Race, winning Line Honours, Overall Handicap, and set a course record in 1997, and then went on to repeat this treble in 2001, breaking her own record; in the 2005 SFR, Ffreefire 70 claimed Line Honours and Overall Handicap, once again.\n\nKnox-Johnston said, “She is not a young lady any longer and there are newer, larger and faster boats in the fleet, and others who have a better handicap. But the boat has raced across the China Sea eight times and won four of those races!”\n\nGeoff Hill was quick to praise the assistance he had from Roger Eastham, Marine Services Manager for the RHKYC, who was the point person for the recovery effort of Strewth in the 2008 edition of the race. Roger is the man to know if you have a boat in Hong Kong, having been in the marine industry for 30 years.\n\nThe Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club is unique in that in incorporates on its’ grounds a full-service boat yard, the only one within the confines of Victoria Harbour. However, it wasn’t always this good. Prior to 1997, the Yacht Clubs’ facilities were really quite small, and all of the service work was sub-contracted out. When the cross-harbour tunnel was built, the area adjacent to the club was part of the reclamation project. The membership Recognizing an opportunity to expand the yard services, the membership had a travel hoist built, more yard-based work was taken on, and the yard grew organically over time as the Yacht Club assumed management themselves.\n\nThe yard provides hard standing for the club’s one-design fleets: Flying Fifteen’s, Etchells, Impalas, Dragons and averages 100 class boats on the hard. The boat yard area is for haul-out, repair and maintenance, and depending on the size of yachts can manage 14 - 18 boats hauled out at any one time. There’s full services including a rigging shop, fiberglass, carpentry, engineering, TIG/MIG welding, and painting. Though a few services are sub-contracted (ie, electronics, stainless steel fabrication, canvas work), the yard is pretty much a one-stop shop for yachtsmen.\n\nPole Star and SkyWave have joined forces to provide a web-based tracking facility for the event. Shore-based fans can follow the racing online at http://www.rhkyc.org.hk/chinasearace/tracking.htm.\n\nThe China Sea Race was first run in 1962, and it has been held every two years since then. In 1972, it was officially recognised by the Royal Ocean Racing Club, and is now run under their prescriptions. Since then the race has continued to attract increased interest and serves to draw the international yachting fraternity to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Rolex China Sea Race joins other prestigious Rolex sponsored events including the Rolex Farr 40 World Championship, Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup, Rolex Swan Cup, Rolex Middle Sea Race and the Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race.\n\nFor more information about the Rolex China Sea Race 2010, including the entry list and divisional splits, please visit www.rhkyc.org.hk/rolexchinasearace.htm\n\nTo receive daily reports and to download high-resolution images, copyright free for editorial purposes, register online at www.regattanews.com\n\nInternational Finn Association Press Release\n\nFinn Focus at Trofeo SAR Princesa Sofia MAPFRE - Day one Monday 29 March\n\nRafa Trujillo leads Finns after first races in Palma\n\nRafael Trujillo (ESP) the Spanish sliver medalist from 2004 and the 2007 World Champion sits on top of the 53 boat Finn fleet after day one at the Trofeo SAR Princesa Sofia MAPFRE in Palma, the third stage of the 2009-2010 ISAF Sailing World Cup.\n\nAfter yesterday's abandonment for the Finn class, light winds again plagued the race course early on. After a slight delay, the Finns finally got two races in, with a third and a second enough for Trujillo to lead the field on\n\n5 points.\n\nThe first race started at 12:30 with the wind at 8-10 knots. It was won by Gasper Vincec (SLO), followed by Trujillo and then Giles Scott (GBR) in third. The conditions worsened for the second race with a very shifty breeze that decreased substantially during the race. The second race was won by the2009 European Champion Ivan Kljakovic Gaspic (CRO). Second placed Giorgio Poggi (ITA) had a shock after the finish as he was scored OCS, which elevated Peer Moberg (NOR) to second and Trujillo to third.\n\nTrujillo said, \"This is only the first day of racing and I am pleased to have started well, but what matters is the result at the end of the week. I have a lot to work on this week. I did make some mistakes today and I have learnt from them and I will keep focusing on improving.\"\n\nThough expecting to sail three races today, Monday, the Finn class still only got two in as the AP was again raised at 16.12 to send the fleet shore.\n\nAfter a 12th and a sixth today, Deniss Karpak (EST) lies in 8th overall. He summed up the conditions on the last two days. \"There was actually no wind yesterday and we were waiting for RS-X to finish their races and clear the racing area....but when they did that, the wind totally died. Today was the same story, but RS-X were waiting us to come back to shore. Until 12.00 there was no wind and then the sea breeze starts working...but up to 14 knots in the first race and up to 7 in the second one...and then wind starts shifting too much and goes to the west. Now it's already 20 knots and I think tomorrow there will be no races again...according to the forecast.\"\n\nCaleb Paine (USA), had a great second race to place fifth. He is part of the US Sailing Development Team, a new youth pipeline team. He said, \"In the second race I started well with Rafael and went out to the left. I tacked with Rafael and then had the opportunity to go back left with Ivan. I tacked back left and then once near lay line I tacked back ducking Ivan. I was fast going to the starboard lay line and then tacked to round the first mark in the lead. I lost two boats on the downwind but made them back on the second beat. The third beat also went well for me after dropping to sixth after the second run. The downwind was really challenging and close. It all came down to the finish where the speed and boat handling of the other competitors beat me out at the end.\"\n\nSo after two races, Trujillo leads with 5 points ahead of Moberg on 10 points and Kljakovic Gaspic on 11. Racing on Tuesday again looks doubtful with strong winds forecast, but the regatta continues until Friday when the medal races will be held.\n\nResults after 2 races:\n\n1 ESP 100 Rafael TRUJILLO 5\n\n2 NOR 1 Peer MOBERG 10\n\n3 CRO 524 Ivan KLJAKOVIC GASPIC 11\n\n4 SLO 5 Gasper VINCEC 12\n\n5 FRA 115 Thomas Le BRETON 13\n\n6 GBR 11 Ed WRIGHT 13\n\n7 GBR 88 Mark ANDREWS 18\n\n8 EST 2 Deniss KARPAK 18\n\n9 POL 7 Rafa SZUKIEL 18\n\n10 CZE 1 Michael MAIER 26\n\nEvent website: http://www.blogger.com/www.trofeoprincesasofia.org\n\nPhotos: Nico Martínez / Princesa Sofía MAPFRE Class website: http://www.blogger.com/www.finnclass.org\n\nEtchells Jaguar Series Mid Winters - John Payne -copyright\n\nby Paige Brooks\n\nAnother Etchells Jaguar Series wrapped up for the winter season in Miami Florida, with Greenwich, CT based Jeff Siegal taking home all the silver. And it was a nail-biter. Going into the final day of the regatta and the series, three boats were nearly tied for the regatta, and also for the series: Jeff Siegal, Tony Rey, and Marvin Beckman. Jeff Madragalli,, sailing with Siegal said, 'How cool is it when it all comes down to the last day?'\n\nThe Jaguar Series score combines the rankings of the four weekends with one dropped result. For many years, Siegal sailing with his regular crew of Madragalli, Willem Van Waay and Becky Nygren, has been in the top 5, but never won it all. This was their year, and Siegal was on cloud nine.\n\nThe racing this weekend was truly up and down. Mother nature barely blew any wind over the south part of Biscayne Bay on Friday, causing the RC to shorten the only race of the day to two legs. With the odd shifts, the results were scrambled. Siegal finished in 13th while Marvin Beckman took first in a race that was finished at the Leeward Gates. Beckman said that win really helped them keep their standings up for the rest of the weekend.\n\nSaturday was another light day, but the RC managed to get in three hotly contested races, with more mix-ups happening. Usually it is consistent finishes that win the regatta, this time, it was persistence and teamwork, even when the chips were down. The top contenders this weekend have all worked together as a team on a regular basis.\n\nAccording to Bill Barton, a psychiatrist from San Francisco, who sails regularly on Etchells 1327 with skipper Peter Duncan and Tom Blackwell: 'I fully believe that if you stick with racing as a unit that has fun and complements each other that you can sharpen many small things in the way you race and communicate on the boat and thus the team can continue to grow and improve.'\n\nSunday was the day to test the teams’ mettle in the 2 race shoot out. At the dock the wind was piping up to 20 knots, causing many to change to their heavy jibs and tighten their shrouds, but by the time competitors got to the windward mark, the wind had lightened to a pleasant 10 knots. Siegal and team must have seen the change coming, because they went decidedly right for both races and really shut down their closest competitors who worked up the middle and left.\n\nChris Busch, who finished fourth sailing with Tony Rey and Bill Bennett and doesn’t usually spend too much time out of the lead pack, was frustrated. He said they just couldn’t find their fast gear to keep Siegal in check. 'The silver lining in all of this is that Jeff has been close a number of times, but never won it all. This year they did it. They sailed clean, really well, and certainly deserve it.' - http://www.etchellsfleet20.org/"
