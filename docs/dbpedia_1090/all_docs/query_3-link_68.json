It's at http://www.alarichall.org.uk.\n\nSince he started as a postgraduate, Alaric has been taking pretty much all his academic notes electronically. It occurred to him that although they were written for personal use only, they might conceivably be useful to people searching the Internet for full references to texts, half-remembered quotations, or all sorts of other stuff. He's just dumped the material into a low-memory, largely unformatted shape (so italics and probably most special characters have been lost). Hopefully there's nothing here that's too libellous, or precious intellectual property of Alaric's own :-)*\n\nAbdou, Angela, ‘Speech and Power in Old English Conversion Narratives’, Florilegium, 17 (2000), 195–212. Some irritating inaccuracies: ‘Based loosely on Felix’s Vita Sancti Guthlaci, the two related poems which are known as Guthlac A and Guthlac B demonstrate the way in which...’--B surely not basedloosely (204); ‘The use of heroic diction does suggest action, a war of words, but it is the devils, not Guthlac, who choose this particular battlefield’ (204)--rubbish. Brief emph on heroic diction (of which much more than in the Latin of course—204–5). Citing Cherniss 1972, 218. ‘The two main temptations in the poem exactly recapitulate two of the temptations of Christ: they ae Guthlac’s being lifted into the air, a temptation to exalt himself in pride, and his being taken down to the gates of hell, a temptation to despair’ (205). 206–7 kind of interesting thing about Guthlac rereading events—demons say ‘we’ll take you into the air to see bad stuff; narrator says he sees bad stuff; G says ‘I saw the bright light of heaven’ c. 487; ‘Guthlac’s rereadings enable him to endure otherwise unbearable situations’ (207). Devils manipulate language (ie they lifre): 208–9. But Glc himself can use commissives, expressives and declarations—but not directives or declarations ’ cos that’s Bartholemew’s job and God’s.

Habit of scholars to separate into several charms 96–98). ‘In my view it does seem reasonable to view all of the lines of E.4 as a single charm intended to overcome a sharp pain, but it must be admitted that the structure and internal logic is not particularly clear’ (98)—this claim seems to have involved sticking neck out!

Smiths 105–107; surveys the opions for and against their friendliness; ‘Finally, Doskow (PLL 12, p. 324) argued that taking the smith of l. 14 as friendly “raises many more questions than it answers. Why should the description in the first section of the attacking forces be interrupted by the introduction of an allied force?” Doskow’s reading is perhaps the most attractive on thematic and structural grounds, but given the terseness of the allusions to the smiths and the likelihood of textual corruption in the next line (see note below) it is not possible to dertermine with absolute certainty whether the smiths are to be seen as fabricators of weapons for defense against the demonic shots, or whether they are actually part of the problem which the charm seeks to remedy’ (107).

Weird. Goes totally for nighan as from neah and I’m with him even if this demands different quality for <hg> than in berhge. ‘A so-far overlooked possibility is that berhge may here have its other common meaning “barrow, burial place, tomb” … rather than “hill, mountain”. The former would make good sense in context since the charm-user is attempting to kill the wen’ (181). Cf. vs. Scneider’\\s reading which is heavy on Norse comparisons, ‘Schneider’s interpretation has nothing to recommend it, based as it is upon textual emedation, strained readings of key words, and upon the assumption that allusive pagan Gmc. imagery could exist in a charm which shows every sign of having been composed late in the OE period. I understand the charm as follows … ll. 1–5 are an attempt to banish the wen to þan nihgan berhge (berhge perhaps having the meaning “burial mound”, an appropriate place for the wen to go to die), where his brother wen has already been sent. The brother will lay a leaf at the wen’s head, either as a cure for the wen from the charm-user’s magic, or as a burial shroud. There is a sense break at l. 56, and the magician applies three talismanic articles, a wolf’s foot, an eagle’s feather, and an eagle’s claw to the webm asserting that the wen will shrink beneath them’ (176). 182–83 re fot uolmes; ‘There is no real choice but to follow Birch et al. and take uolmes as a mistake of some kind, probably for wolves’ (183).\n\nwenne wenne wenchichenne [note 1: ‘wenchic,henne]\n\nher ne scealt þu timbrien [note 2: timb,rien] ne nenne tun habben\n\nac þu scealt north [note 3: ‘nort,h] eonene to þan nihga[a overdotted]n berhge\n\nþer þu havest armig enne broþer\n\nhe þe sceal legge leaf et heafde\n\nunder [note 6 ‘under, d corrected from o?’] fot uolmes under veþer earnes\n\nunder earnes clea á þu geweornie\n\nclinge þu alswa col on heorþe\n\nscring þu alswa[overdotted a] sce[overdotted e]sne a wage[overdotted e].\n\nand worne alswa[overdotted a] weter on anbre[?anþre—þ hard to read in this part of the microfilm; collate with other eds].\n\nswa litel þu gewurþe alswa linsetcorn\n\nand miccli lesse alswa anes handwurmes hupeban\n\nand alswa litel þu gewurþe þet þu nawiht gewurþe.\n\nGerman texts 185ff.\n\n1st Merseburg charm, based on facs of Domstiftsbibliothek Merseburg Cod. 136, Bl. 85r (ed. p. 186):\n\nEiris sazun idisi sazun hera duo der\n\nsuma hapt heptidun suma heri lezidun\n\nsuma clubodun umbi cuoniowidi\n\ninsprinc haptbandun invar vigandun.

''The five features of Old Norse-Icelandic literary culture--its roots in a non-Christian belief system and its expression through myth, the absence of Nature from its worldview, its animism, the weird (super)realism of its representational literature, and its origins in a natureculture that has always lived under the shadow of ecological catastrophe--make ecocriticism particularly important to Old Norse studies, and Old Norse particularly relevant to the ecocritical project as a whole.'\n\nAcker, Paul, Revising Oral Theory: Formulaic Composition in Old English and Old Icelandic Verse, Garland Studies in Medieval Literature, 16/Garland Reference Library of the Humanities, 2104 (New York: Garland, 1998).\n\nAcker, Paul, ‘Dwarf-Lore in Alvíssmál’, in The Poetic Edda: Essays on Old Norse Mythology, ed. by Paul Acker and Carolyne Larrington (New York: Routledge, 2002), pp. 215-227. ‘Examining this poem as a source of dwarf-lore, the first thing one may notice about this particular dwarf is that he is interested in sex, or the prospect of it’ (215). This isn’t normal in ON (215-16). ‘But we must consider whence that image of dwarves derives. Probably our most recurrent image of dwarves in Old Norse literature is to be found in the late fornaldarsögur or legendary-heroic sagas’ where dwarves are ‘elusive and reluctant donors’ of swords and things (216). ‘From such a motif and its prevalence we can easily see how Motz would deduce an underground smith figure as the underlying archetype for all dwarves. But we need to consider this motif structurally in its narrative context. The dwarves are reluctant donors and to provide a suitable element of conflict or challenge, it is expedient that they be difficult of access, unsociable if you will. Not only are their sex lives irrelevant, but any contact with the outside world is to be downplayed’ (216). And contrast s²rla þáttr (216-17). ‘Here we see that the rules can change for the female quester. When Freyja desires something from a dwarf, she does not aggressively interpose her body: she allows the dwarves access to her body; she uses sex as a weapon. And the dwarves must be sociable, oversexed even, if the narrative function is to proceed’ (216). But it’s Alvíss on the offensive in Alvml: ‘While Alvíss’s actions may seem aberrant for a dwarf, they are very much in keeping with actions undertaken by giants in other myths’ (217). Narrative function of this 217-18. NBs that unlike Óðinn in wisdom contests, Þórr doesn’t actually need to know any answers to succeed here (218). Dvalinn as ‘delayed’, i.e. like Alvíss is (219). Circumstantial ev. towards dwarves turning to stone in the sun but none direct (218-19). But doesn’t fit Reginn or dwarves who make the mead of poetry (219). As the only dwarves who are known to have been delayed in old stuff, Dvalinn=Alvíss? (220).\n\nAcker, Paul, ‘Horror and the Maternal in Beowulf’, PMLA, 121 (2006), 702–16.

They argued that the ideas of social progress, including the democratisation [19] of governmental rule, and also the secularisation of mind, were absolutely impossible in societies which communicated only orally. According to Goody and Watt, oral societies are not able to develop a critical approach to information; they are also unable to select information, to distinguish between the present and past in the same way that literates do, etc. Theirs is a world without history’ (18–19), citing Goody and Watt 1963; ‘In his later works, Goody went even further, concluding that all intellectual revolutions in European history resulted from new instruments of social communication; the most important of these was writing’ (19) citing Goody 1986. ‘Nowadays, most scholars do no longer agree [sic] with Goody’s theory. We had to dwell on it however, because it inspired many historians. This was understandable, for, if it is true that the introduction of writing results in a “reorganisation” of the human mind and the ways mankind thinks, then several phenomena of social life which came into being the [sic] Middle Ages might be explained by the growth of access to written communication. However, attractive though the theory is, it has been proven to be a simplification. There is also another negative aspect, i.e. the theory’s unconscious valorisation: the cultural sustem, based on writing, is “progressive” and “positive”, whereas oral cultures are summarily dismissed as “primitive” or retarded. This valorisation may be the consequence of the old paradigm of the superiority of writing over orality, dating from the Age of Enlightenment, when social progress was associated with alphabetization’ (19). Ong broadly follows suit, with much emph on printing (20). Clanch as revolutionising this by showing the non-literate modes of communication existed and came naturally and had to be replaced slowly and pieceal by literate practices (20–21). ‘Sociologists, and even more anthropologists, seem to have no real respect for the limitations to which times and space subject human societies. Quite often they collect convenient examples to bolter an a priori hypothesis. In doing so, they nonchalantly break through traditional chronological boundaries. In many sociological studies of literacy, the real boundary is not that between the Middle Ages and Modern Times, but that between the European Ancien Régime and the “industrial” era of the nineteenth century [er, dunno where this is coming from—no refs]. Sometimes, however, an approach which at first sight seems a-historical [sic] may help to break down historical stereotypes. Thus, the study of the material features of books, irrespective of the time they were produced, has inspired the reflection that quite possibly the passage from roll to codex was as important for the history of reading, as the “revolution of print” .’ (21). 21–23 applauds slow rise of other kinds of communication in scholarship, like gestures, colours, smells and rels between text and illuminations in MSS. ‘Because of their repetition, oral cultures have been judged by literate Western scholars as primitive, retarded or barbarian. // We can easily understand what happens when writing s introduced into an oral society. Messages may now be ‘cut off’ from the personal relationship between “sender” and “receiver”; with writing, the supplementary non-verbal message disappears. We may therefore think that written texts make information more “objective”, independent from the here and now, and easier to retrieve (and change!) whenever this is deemed appropriate. These principal consequences of the introduction of writing are at the basis of the eighteenth-century paradigm of literacy’s superiority over orality’ (28). ‘A second important change in the attitude of medieval scholars is that they are finally able to appreciate the efficiency of oral communication, and that—in some spheres of social life—oral modes existed until the end of the Middle Ages and beyond’ shock horror! Surely not?! Estonian cabinet meetings now purely in chat-rooms but hardly everywhere else; frankly bizarre but telling, despite the laudable critique of modernist assumptions generally in this piece (29). maybe the necessity of citing sources, hitherto necessarily written, which automatically deprivileges conference papers, pub conversatons, or even indeed oral informants in professionally conducted oral history research, has blinded us to the fact that journalists routinely rely on oral sources, oral debate has real effects on law (justice and legislation), board meetings etc.\n\nAdler, Melissa, 'Wikipedia and the Myth of Universality', Nordisk Tidsskrift for Informationsvidenskab og Kulturformidling, 5.1 (2016), 9-13. http://ntik.dk/2016/Nr1/Adler.pdf\n\n*Adolfsson, G. and I.

'In 1986 Spain joined the EU and in effect became the gatekeeper of Europe, restricting the entry of immigrans from Africa into the EU labor market ...

The process would, however, entail a political and cultural distancing from North Africa, though, simultaneously, Spain's proximity to Islam would help it gain influence in [75] the EU. Spanish leaders portrayed Spain as Europe's defender---the West's \"security cordon\"---against third world masses, and in effect the country went overnight from Europe's outsider to insider, by selling itself as the bulwark against Europe's real outsider, Islam. As Helen Graham and Antonio Sanchez explain, \"So Spain, in spite of its own long and painful history of underdevelopment, economic emigration, and otherness, far from recognizing a commonality and attempting to integrate the experience of the marginalized into its own self-proclaimedly pluralistic culture, has instead assumed the stance of \"First World\" Europe.

I think most people do not realize the immense value of this' (45)--interesting. 'But of course, it is not all bad. The upside of the kreppa is that we finally have a left-wing government and a new awakening and awareness of what really matters in life. In the pre-kreppa years I often felt disgust at the rampant consumerism and greed. I felt completely out of place in that society. Now people seem to be returning to a set of real values. Things are moving more slowly and people have time to knit, spend time with their children and family. That is the positive aspect of this crisis, and it was about time' (55). 'Something like this wouldn’t even happen in the worst banana republic. This country is filled with criminals who would have been assassinated if they’d lived in an African country. It’s that simple.

It felt a bit like the terrorist attacks on New York, when everyone just stood there, so powerless, unable to comprehend the scope of it' (84).

On the West Fjords, harboring many of her best childhood memories. Closing her eyes she could hear the whisper of happy voices on the breeze – now, calling. It was a house that her grandparents had owned, that held a part of her within its walls, a place of refuge. It had been there since she was small, not always visible, but permanent nonetheless.' Usual appeal to grandparents' generation as authentically Icelandic golden age.' Pg. 17: 'Years later, after Egill had become a successful businessman in his own right, he had bought the house back.' Jesus, everyone's doing it. And it goes on at some length about the place. pp. 63-64: 'the banks had experienced astronomical growth, it was true, but that was all down to the Icelanders’ intrepid behavior in all things business, their quick responses, absence of bureaucracy and willingness to take risks. The Viking spirit. The “outvasion” as it was called in Iceland – being done in reverse now, the opposite of “invasion”. And anyway, they claimed, the nay-sayers were just jealous, especially the Danes, who could not stand to see their former colony come in and buy up their own treasured assets, like the Hotel Anglaterre and Magasin du Nord, the famous department store that had graced the Kongens Nytorv square in Copenhagen for over a century. Or the British, who were losing most of their treasured high street shops to foreign interests – and Icelandic interests, at that. // No one listening could be in any doubt that Iceland was on its way to conquering the world. The first man protested weakly – these takeovers were mostly leveraged, he said, done on borrowed capital, and eventually the time would come when the “outvasion Vikings” would have to pay. He was quickly silenced by the host, who announced it was time for some music.' pp. 76 ff. 9/11.

Now that she was back … she never wanted to leave again. Never': interesting bluntness re nationalism, albeit of a piece with the slightly lumpen writing. p. 167: 'Those who fervently wished for change were fearful that all the force had gone out of the protests – Icelanders had a habit of reacting fiercely to injustice but soon sinking back into the lethargic serfdom that had been conditioned into the nation’s soul during centuries of colonial rule and oppression. They despaired that the New Iceland for which they so yearned would ever materialize, afraid that the Icelandic proletariat would simply shuffle onwards with a servile air, snot dripping from their noses, passively submitting to the ruling elite.

'There was, however, a burgeoning alternative to Iceland’s nature-loving, clean, green and wholesome image. A newer image of all-night wild drinking and dancing emerged at the turn of the new millennium, summed up by the epithet ‘Global Party Capital’. Unlike the natural image of Iceland this more recent development focused primarily on younger persons, in particular men, who in 2005 made up just under 55 percent of visitors. 9 So internationally prominent did this new urban party image become that the country’s nightlife was given as the fifth most popular reason for visiting, after nature, swimming, shopping and day excursions, and before museums, hiking, glacier trips, horse riding and whale watching. 10 Most controversially, however, of central significance in this new image was the promiscuous ‘supermodel’ female. Asked why he had come to vacation in Iceland in 2001, one 27-year-old interviewee for Time magazine responded, ‘Icelandic girls are just gorgeous. . . . They enjoy sex and don’t believe in marriage’ (Sancton, 2001: 73)' (39). 39--41 a few prominent international media images of Iceland as having promiscuous women. 41--42 topos of neglect re gender in tourism studies. 'The particularly ironic twist in this tale of North Atlantic beauty queens in a country now sometimes described as the ‘Bangkok of the North’ is the effect this stereotype has on Iceland’s alternative image as one of the supposedly most egalitarian nation-states in the world'--that's a new one on me! (42). 42--44 gender equality in Iceland; 'In hindsight the decision by the Women’s Alliance proved premature, for a number of commentators have noted that Iceland’s image is not now as egalitarian or progressive as many believe, especially when compared to its nearby Nordic neighbours. Thoroddur Bjarnason and Andrea Hjálmsdóttir (2008) have remarked that gender inequalities not only continue to exist but that ‘egalitarian attitudes among youth have declined in recent years’. Similarly, Raaum’s study on gender balances in Nordic parliaments has noted that ‘The Icelandic profile is the least gender equal in the Nordic region’ ' (43). 44--46 sex tourism by people from the global north to the global south as reflecting ongoing colonial power relationships. 'Where the present study becomes intriguing is the realization that the sexual relationships, although still female-focused, are not necessarily only colonial or asymmetrical. In Iceland’s case western male tourists are not going from a rich North to a poor South, but instead from First World nations to a country rated in 2008 as being at the top of the UN’s human development index. Such an occurrence seems to imply, therefore, that sex tourism is as much about gender and patriarchy as it is about colonialism and ‘race’, although the white/blonde imagery so prevalent in much of this discourse does point to the continuing existence of a racialized stereotype, albeit this time a northern Icelandic/Scandinavian one instead of the more familiar Third/Developing World images' (45).\n\n‘A Letter to the King on the Irish Church Bill’, Blackwood’s, 33 (May 1833), 723–36. http://books.google.com/books?id=ibkCAAAAIAAJ. 'America is governed without an Established Church. But are we to compare the ancient and massive fabric of the British government with the fluctuating and fugitive shelter under which American legislation thrust its head? or the prescriptive majesty of our national worship with the rambling sectarianism of religion in a country where the pulpit is only the more foul and furious conduit of every absurdity of the brain, or paroxysm of the passions; the land of camp-meetings and convulsionnaires, of corruption under the name of conversion, and of political raving under the name of Scriptural illumination? We might as well compare the forest wigwam with the palace, or its tenant with the sages and statesmen of Europe' (725). Mention of Empire same page, col. 2--doesn't seem significant tho'. 'This faction began with Ireland. There they found the soil prepared by a giddy Government, and a profligate superstition; they sowed the seeds of bloodshed, and left them to the natural care of those sure influences. The crop has duly followed; and Ireland, at this hour, presents a scene of misgovernment and misery, unequalled in the globe. The sanguinary despotism of Turkey has nothing like it; the barbarism of Russia is civilized to it. The roving Arabs exhibit a more reverent respect for life and property.

What helpful chaps those Irish ecclesiastics have been. 'But the orators tell us of \"bloated bishops\" and luxurious clergymen. If men, unsuited to their functions, are suffered to possess the high stations of the Church, the patronage of the bishops is in the hands of the Crown; let the next choice be more carefully looked to; let me of virtue and learning be appointed, and the evil is at an end. But are we to be told that Protestantism ought to be reduced in Ireland, on account of the Popish majority. This is the great argument for cashiering the Irish clergy! This, which should be the great argument for increasing their numbers, for increasing their means, for protecting their efforts to spread the Gospel! The country is overrun with superstition, therefore extinguish knowledge;--it is weighed down with barbarian prejudices against the government, constitution, and religion of England, therefore cease from all attempts to lighten the yoke. The land is dark, therefore extinguish the light in your hand. Or, are we to be told, that the religion of the majority should be submitted to, whatever it may be? Then let us pronounce that all apptempts to convert the heathen are criminal,--that we should not de[736]sire to plant Christianity in Hindostan, while we are outnumbered by the millions of Mussulmans and idolaters,--that we should not send the Bible to the African or the South Sea islander. On this principle, Europe should have been left to this hour worshipping Thor and Woden. On this absurd and criminal principle, Christianity should never have stepped beyond the boundaries of Palestine' (735-36). Whew, pretty shrill.

God, social scientists can't punctuate to save their lives! 94 idea that you have to specify objectives before you can plan how to reach them, which is rational but doesn't account for the power of a course or its materials to shape objectives. ARRRGH THE PUNCTUATION!! 'Tyler's definition of objectives can be seen to place the responsibility on the institution to identify the desired behaviour to be developed in the student' re a 1949 thing that seems to commit the sin of being behaviouristic (94). SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHEN TO USE FULL STOPS. 95- re some 1960s guy called Mager who moves away from 'educational objectives' to 'instructional objectives' (i.e. outcomes of instruction on a particular course which might contribute to wider educational objectives). But mager winds up trying to break complex tasks down into discrete, objectively classifiable bits (slipping, I note, by apparent accident, into subjective terms like 'You must apply at least three rules of good composition in the development of your score') (95). Mager also seems to have lost track of working out how instruction might actually produce the objectives (96, cf. 98). Later 60s and the 70s seem to see the term 'behavioural objectives' but the duff writing makes it a bit hard to see what the idea was here, if indeed the term was meant to denote anything different from Mager's (96-97).\n\nThe phasing out of the term 'instructional objectives' in favour of 'behavioural objec-tives' with its attendant specificity and its behaviouristic overtones, effected a polarisation of reaction to the notion of an educational objective. At one extreme rational planning was rejected and labelled as reductionist by those who did not accept that a subject can be reduced to disjointed facts and concepts if the integrity of a discipline is to be respected. This 'atomisation' was, and remains, an anathema, particularly to those involved in curriculum design in higher education, where a high level of analysis and synthesis is implicit in what constitutes learning in undergraduate study. Yet at the other extreme, the tenets of behaviourism underpin the more recent planning models of Wheeler (1967), Kerr (1968), Taylor (1970), and Merrit (1972). [97]\n\nI sympathise with the objections! They produced a backlash accordingly (97ff.). A key idea (under the rubric 'expressive objectives' for some reason) is that curriculum desgin shouldn'tdump a straightjacket on students but allow them to personalise goals (98). 'Expressive objectives' become 'expressive outcomes': 'Eisner differentiated between the latter [objectives], which imply a preformulated specific goal and the former [outcomes] which, [ARRRGH] 'are essentially what one ends up with, intended or not, after some form of engagement' (99). All this does provide me with some useful genealogy for the concept of the ILO, suggesting some subtleties to what it isn't and why the term is used. Waffles onwards; I wonder if anyone's looked at whether students actually find lists of objectives/outcomes useful (as they are assumed to be on pp. 100, 104)? Quite a lot on personal vs general/subject-specific outcomes; seems to have been written before 'transferable skills' become standard conception (c. 102). By 103 it's trying to posit its own set of taxonomies, which must be why it's getting waffly and tedious. 104 conclusion. Whew.

Looks dead handy re medicine and supernatural creatures/witchery. Cool.\n\n‘The conception on folk medicine as a folk variant of academic medicine has had consequences for the approach to the issue and for an understanding of folk medicine. It has led to the use of the premises of scientific medicine in the analysis of folk concepts of illness and treatment. In this context, the terminology and concepts of scientific medicine have formed the framework for the perception of folk medicine’ (21). ‘Studies have been concerned with the examination of the biomedical effectiveness of folk medicine (for example see Honko 1963, 1978; Alver 1980). This led to the discussion of a division of folk medicine into a rational part and an irrational part (Bø 1972, selberg 1982)’ (21). ‘The conceptual limits of the category “folk medicine” are open to question. Quite possibly, folk medicine is part of a larger concept complex. Also in [22] question is whether categories of illness and health, such as they are defined and understood within scientific medicine, are delimited phenomena in a folk conceptual world. Rather, we must ask if we study illness and health as part of a central value system within the folk conceptual world’ (21-22). ‘We have found it useful to use as our starting point core values of equal importance as health. Such core values are production and reproduction. In older oral traditional material concerning man’s interaction with the supernatural, these values are especially exposed. We discuss the attitudes about hulders and witches for two reasons. They are central in Norwegian folk tradition, and they have a special significance as destructive forces in folk explanations of illness’ (22). ‘A cognitive system is a culturally learned way of seeing, thinking about, and experiencing reality. It structures ut impressions and experiences into categories and creates order in our world. To create order from disorder is a common human need, but the categories used and the content of these categories are cultural variables’ … ‘If man thinks of his world in categories, he also has to think of the borders between categories. These borders form areas which are variously filled with tension. A border is more than a sharp line between two areas. There is also a “no man’s land” on both sides that is marginal, ambiguous and filled with tension, composed of several qualities. According to Edmund Leach, these border areas form the taboo areas in a culture. He claims that we create structure in our world by naming areas, and keep these conceptually separate by making the border areas taboo. Language gives us names to know things by, taboo inhibits the recognition of those parts of the unbroken reality which separate things’ (23). ‘Through the violation of folkways and mores, man transgresses important borders in the web of social life. When people act so as to be in a border area between right and wrong, their ideas about the supernatural are activated. In many different folk traditions, supranormal beings are customarily attributed the role of guardians of social order’ (24).\n\n‘To use a technical term, hulders are “folk belief beings”. They are the only Norwegian folk belief beings who appear as so-called “collective beings”. They live in families, and according to tradition, their lives are described as a mirror image of human family life. In many ways, hulders are the personifications of the human dream. They have more of everything that humans have …[25] The only they do not have that humans do is the hope for eternal life’ (24-5). ‘Svale Solheim characterizes hulders as destructive in the same way as robbers, outlaws, and wild animals. We would modify this somewhat. Basically, hulders are a superior power in relation to humans, not a destructive power. According to tradition, there are rules about how humans should deal with hulders. If these rules are broken, the hulders punish. But if rules are observed, or a favor is done for the hulders, then they reward’ (25). A clearly defined category: ‘What is important for humans is that by keeping the traditional rules they maintain harmony with this superior force’ (25). This reading opposes very neatly the idea of supernatural figures as ambiguous. Rather like Efnisien, in fact. And the if you don’t go to bed the bogey-man will get you principle (NB monsters cannot penetrate a duvet). They play by the rules, albeit perhaps harsh ones.\n\n2 kinds of witch—rich and successful, wandering vagabond. latter more common (25). ‘Te poorest and most derelict part of the population were those who most often were accused of witchcraft in Norway in the 1500s and 1600s’ (25). Destructive 25-6. ‘In contrast to hulders, wich [sic] were found in nature and “outside the home”, witches were together with humans—closer than one might believe. They represent the powers of chaos on the offensive’ (26). Hmm, do ælfe move between these categories during their existence? Kind of like the embodiment of monsters progression—except reversed with ælfe in OE medical tradition (human-looking race becomes formless demons?). High medieval elves working just like hulders? ‘The category of witches is more ambiguous than that of hulders, and they are thus perceived as being more dangerous. A witch is a human and a demon at the same time, belonging to two worlds. A witch looks like any other human, and therefore cannot be recognized on sight. They are only first recognized by their actions, and by then the damage may already have been done … Also, an important difference in folk attitudes is related to the degree to which the categories of hulder and witch may be neutralized. Hulders cannot be neutralized in the long run. They are made to disappear by quoting from the Bible, or by touching them. But at the next moment there they are again, behind the nearest bush. Witches can be neutralized. Witch burning ought to be sufficient evidence of this point…’ (26). Both cause misfortune tho’; ‘The misfortune is often related to the basis of existence’ (26). ‘The concept of the ability to cast spells has as a precondition a concept of an evil mind, which often may be seen as envy’ (28), which correlates with accusations being levelled at the poorest, see (26) ‘Svale Solheim also touches on situations where witchcraft provides explanations of misfortune and accidents. This is when those who have nothing meet those who have. The concept of witchcraft becomes relevant where the distribution of limited goods is most out of balance. Limited goods, envy, and the casting spells are interrelated’ (28). But NB rich get accused sometimes to. Neighbours usually also: limited goods conceived to circulate in a limited neighbourhood (28).\n\nTheory of ‘limited good’ (refs 29). Concept that all things of value are limited, and the sum of good fortune constant—but distribution varies (29). Folks have to negotiate within this, seeming not to have too much and to be seen to be generous etc. maintenance of status quo all important (29-30). ‘Private initiative and diligence could lead to being suspected of witchcraft. But there was one possibility, according to Foster: one’s good fortune could be obtained outside (local) society’ (30). Treasure from mound-breaking into otherworld presumably meet this, even if not in distant land. Also shows importance of getting bride from outside court—fights over women in Arthurian bit? Arthur and Lancelot; Amis and Amiloun? All those jealous stewards? Witches can destroy goods (good fortune, etc.) so that none has them (30); deprive neighbours to enrich themselves, both individually and from whole community (30-1). Folklore hereof, mainly concerned with stealing/reducing milk/butter/cream yields 31-2. NB as with the east Anglian horse folklore the importance of control/harm re animals as well as people. Revenge motifs (again us. re livestock) 33. ‘Attitudes to witchcraft also emerge in situations where admiration is expressed. Because there was a fear of envy, people did not like it if a stranger praised their children or their domestic animals. There was considered to be little distance between praising something and wanting to have it. It was said that the sweeter the “evil tongue” was, the worse the consequences. To protect oneself against false friendship, one could respond with harsh words or an oath. The exposure of evil intent could reduce the power of the effect of envy’ (33) might explain a lot of grumpy saga characters. Also Þórgunna stuff? ‘Strangers were not supposed to have access to the unbaptized child. No one from the outside was allowed to see the infant being tended or fed because of the fear of spells being cast and of the fear of a particularly illness, rickets (“horeskjæver”). Rickets was manifested by discontent, and people thought it was caused when an immoral woman simply looked at the infant’ (34). Cf. baby getting zapped in Guðmundar saga when parents go for a shag.\n\n‘There is a difference in the way hulders and witches punish. Even though both forms of punishment are severe, being aimed at essential values, it still seems as though the hulder’s punishment is more acceptable, since it is related to a stricter set of rules for law and order: Hulders [sic] attack because there is a reason to attack; witches attack for no reason’ (34). Elves start off bound by rules and in medical texts moved into being bound by divine intent, but, like witches, not by rules? ‘The names of such diseases as hulder bite, hulder burn, and hulder love tell us that people had related various disorders to contact with the hulders’ (34). Hulder bit a pain or sore that won’t weal 34-5; burn affects cattle—they get lost and come back with sores or changes in its coat (35); love a consumptive illness caused by meeting (implicitly sex?) with hulder (35). Need to follow Hulder rules, e.g.s etc (35-6). ‘The tradition about hulders says a great deal about borders and categories in the peasant society. As long as people stuck to the rules, the hulders were there as an invisible superior force, seeing to it that everything was as it should be. But if the rules were broken, suddenly the hulders became a visible superior force, punishing transgressors in the vital areas of health, production and reproduction. Hulders became visible for humans in the ambiguous areas, in the transitional parts of the conceptual world, where they are an important superior force’ (36). Big assocs with summer farms—marginal territories (36-8). ‘The mountain summer farm was filled with tension because it could be perceived as being both home and not-home. During the summer, this farm was home for the farm people, but at other times it was seen as home for the hulders. Staying at the summer farm longer than was considered correct could have severe consequences’ (37). Day/Night too i guess; Xmas; etc.\n\n‘It happened about 1800. A woman from Heidi in Seljord was on the way to church to have her baby, a little girl, baptised. She took a short-cut with the baby. For some reason, she laid the baby on the ground and went behind a bush for just a moment. / When she came back and was about to pick up the baby, she was completely terrified—she didn’t recognize the baby. Her beautiful little girl had become so ugly that it was dreadful to see. Then the woman realised that the hulders had come and exchanged the baby. But she couldn’t do anything about this, so she took the baby to the church and had it baptised, and didn’t say a word to anyone about what had happened. [39] / The baby grew up; it was a girl, but not really human. She lived long, was nearly 100 when she did’ trans. by authors, quoted from Kjetil A. Flatin, Tussar og trolldom, Norsk Folkeminnelags skrifter, 21 (Oslo, 1930), p. 22 (38-9). Before a woman is blessed again after childbirth she is marginal, ‘ “impure and heathen” ’; NB re heiðni barnit or whatever it was. the danger of hulders, esp. of newborns or women just given birth, actually helps to define the rite of passage. Puts supernatural seal on it, etc.\n\n‘Many analyses have emphasized that the function of folk belief is t maintain norms and rules in society. The violation of norms is sanctioned by supranormal forces and beings, and the violation of norms brings to the fore belief in the supranormal. This belief in supranormal beings can function as social control (see for example Honko 1962)’ (40). Cf. 40-41. Solheim 1952: 371 on the same thing. ‘The building of new houses was regulated by the hulders. People could not build just anywhere, or make arrangements without taking consideration of both other people and the hulders. If one built on a site where hulders rules, one risked certain retributions which in turn affected the well-being of the farm. The only solution was to move the house’ (41).\n\n‘We began this article by questioning the conceptual borders of the category “folk medicine”. Our analysis has been aimed at expanding these borders, in order to bring forth a different—and in our opinion—more correct [sic re punct] understanding of the folk perception of illness and treatment’ (41). ‘In our view, there is a relationship between health, production and reproduction, all central values both for the single individual and for society as a system. In the last instance, these three central values represent the core of the issue. Balance between health, production and reproduction is necessary if “complete fortune” is to be achieved; should misfortune occur in one of these areas, the consequence is disharmony. These values can be threatened when society’s order is violated—thus supranormal punishment becomes a part of social control. Folk attitudes towards illness can be placed within this complex of attitudes’ (42). The distinctions drawn here ought to be apparent in Thomas, R&DofM too, cf. c. 611.\n\n*Alver, Bente Gullveig and Torunn Selberg, ‘Trends in Research on Folk Medicine in the Nordic Countries’, Ethnologia Scandinavica (1987), 59-70.\n\nAmies, Marion, ‘The Journey Charm: A Lorica for Life’s Journey’, Neophilologus, 67 (1983), 448–62.

To put this another way, even in our highly literate Western culutre literacy is far from universal, and even the most highly literate members of our culture must nevertheless continually navigate their way through the layers of oral/aural culture that surround, inform, and help define contemporary Western (literate) culture. From our literate perspective it is easy to forget that the same holds true of oral culture, however broadly or narrowly one wishes to define it: literates may have easier and more direct access to the world of orality than non-literatures have to the world of literacy, but non-literates encounter literate culture [4] everywhere and the (oral) world they inhabit is necessarily infused with and to a considerable extent shaped by literacy and its attendant practices and habits of mind’ (4–5).\n\nAmodio, Mark C., ‘Res(is)ting the Singer: Towards a Non-Performative Anglo-Saxon Oral Poetics’, in New Directions in Oral Theory, ed. by Mark C.

Lots of perfectly good points, but problems with seeing orality as only oral-formulaic and contrasts with modernity. Speech must antedate writing but the inevitable succession of writing to orality not obvious (1–2). Vs the great divide model of orality and literacy 2–3. ‘As theoretical postulates, the end points of the oral-literate continuum retain considerable heuristic value for the investigation of human cognition and development, and with this in mind we now turn to consider them. But as we do so, we need t guard against uncritically accepting the notion of primary orality because it “is forever inaccessible to us (if it is not purely mythical)”. And we need to keep in mind that the same is true of pure literacy’ (4). Oral poetry as ‘inherently dynamic and ephemeral’; ‘Residing only within the collective memory of those present while it is performed, an oral poem leaves no trace once the final reverberations of the poet’s voice die [5] out. Necessarily composed (and recomposed) under the exigencies of performance, the poetry produced within a primary oral culture is, therefore highly protean’ (4–5). What’s so crap about collective memory that it can hold no trace of a poem? Likewise, skaldic verse isn’t recomposed. ‘Within a fully literate culture, both the production and reception of texts are intensely private, highly idiosyncratic, and highly unconventional (in the most technical sense of the term) endeavours’ (5)--contrast the saga where someone hears a poem and goes off and works out what it means where no-one else does? ‘...while orally produced texts are rooted in a highly specialized, conventional idiom, one shared by both poets and audiences, fully literate texts spring from the imaginative well of [6] authors who carefully mold their thoughts according to their tastes, inclinations, experiences, and abilities’ (5–6). Goes on to argue that oral poets have intentions too (thankfully) and that there is individual artistry—tradition not static (7), poets are the traditions (7), how they’re transmitted doesn’t affect what they mean (7), but seems to do so within the position established in this quote. ‘Traditional oral poetics is expressed through a specialized register, a remarkably economical, useful tool for expressing verbl art that no doubt developed as an aid to oral poets who had to compose rapidly during performance’ (8): clear statement that he thinks of oral poetry strictly in the Parry-Lord model. Why not just to help memory? And is it even always there) (As usual, skaldic verse doesn’t fit this well). ‘For the literate poet, composition remains an exclusively private and internal rather than public and communal process’ (8)--really? Footnote for this is rubbish. ‘Unlike their oral counterparts, who are unable to revise or correct metrical deficiencies or narraive infelicities because for them the acts of composition and presentation are simultaneous, literate poets have the leisure to dwell over every aspect of their creations’ (8) grrrr—both because of skaldic verse, and because it ignores the potential importance of repeated performance. Cf. the Finnegan account of an african storyteller getting more consistent in his telling over the years. Useful point that all readers individually produce the text as they real, as presumably do listeners—but that in reading, the basis for this is static (8–9). 10 accepts that just as you’d be hard put to find a purely oral society these days, a purely literate society is just a heuristic construct. He seems to think it’s a useful construct anyway, but I’m less sure. Even when he gets to ‘Textuality, Poetic Authority, and Literacy: Problematizing Oral Theory’ (12–15), HE SAYS THINGS LIKE ‘Oral poetry, in contrast, deries its authority from a very different course. While it is necessarily performative and so depends upon a poetics of presence, its authority paradixically does not derive mainly from the poets who articulate it. Just as meaning in traditional poetry inheres in the structures that constitute its expressive economy, so, too, does an oral poem’s authority lie chiefly in the tectonics of the tradition itself rather than in the person of the poet. Oral poets are responsible for the unique shape they give to their traditional, inherited materials, but they stake no claim to any sort of originary status’ (14). Skaldic verse again? I guess no-one says ‘I invented this myth’, but all the same... And if poets are not saying ‘I invented this’ but ‘this is how it is/was’, that’s not inherently oral—it’s a feature of genres which claim to be historical/factual. ‘Each piece of verbal art produced withn an oral culture is as authoritative as any other’ (14). Obviously rubbish. Cf. flytings. Though Downes’s article on Beowulf and Unferth does nicely show the usefulness of anthropological evidence—traditionality more useful than orality? ‘Because Latin’s status as a prestige language was unchallenged in both the secular and ecclesiastical spheres throughout the perod [ASE], its relationship to the vernacular is generally cast in terms of a simple and strict polarity ... Latin was the language of discourse among members of monastic and other religious communities...’ (16) dis in Bede article? ‘Whether the oral poet is one who (re)composes in performance, recites verbatim from memory, or reads aloud from a written text, the poem and the tradition body forth upon his voice. Unlike written texts, which continue “frequently to speak without voice the words of the absent”, oral texts exist only so long as they are embodied in a living voice’ (23)--a. ah, so he does believe in memorial transmission of oral work; b. why doesn’t memory count as a way for oral texts to exist?\n\nAmos, Ashley Crandell, Linguistic Means of Determining the Dates of Old English Literary Texts, Medieval Academy Books, 90 (Cambridge, Mass.: Medieval Academy of America, 1980).\n\nAmours, F.J.

Thus, for example, the experience of color in modem English is structured around an inventory of twelve \"basic\" color terms; but languages vary in the number of basic color terms used, from thirteen or fourteen terms to as few as two or three. Anthropological linguists have been interested in the comparative study of folk-taxonomies across contemporary languages, and in their studies they have sometimes proposed evolutionary models for the development and elaboration of these taxonomies. The evolutionary models have implications for historical linguistics, but there have been very few studies of the historical development of a folk-taxonomy within a language or within a language family. Folk-Taxonomies in Early English undertakes this task for English, and to some extent for the Germanic and Indo-European language families. The semantic fields studied are basic color terms, seasons of the year, geometric shapes, the five senses, the folk-psychology of mind and soul, and basic plant and animal life-forms.

Hellberg nachgewiesen hat, in den Landschaften um den Mälarsee in Mittelschweden in mehreren Siedlungsnamen enthalten ist’ (509-10). ‘Kennzeichnend für den nordischen Personennamenschatz ist, daß auch Namen einzelner Götter als Erstglied auftreten’ (Characteristically for the Norse personal name formation is that names also appear characteristically with gods as first elements, 510). [Janzén 235-68, 258ff. for this point]. Þórr; is donar etc. in W. Germ continental names the thunder word? 510-11. ‘Der Umstand, daß das Wort in fränk. Albthonar auch als Zweitglied erscheint, entscheidet die Frage, da in dieser Stellung ein Göttername nicht zu erwarten ist’ [in Förstemann Namenbuch] (The circumstance, that this word appears in Frankish Albthonar also as a second element, decides the question… 511). Freyr a secondary development, apparently just Norse then (511). 511-12 re Þór-; seen also as 2ndry, seems to equate it with Ás. Other god-names as 1st elements in Norse 512-15. No discussion of dís or álfr.herman\n\nNotes –run(a) names, esp. re priestess figures as found in, e.g. Tacitus: ‘Diese Funktion liegt sicherlich in demn Zweitglied –run(a) vor, das “Geheimnis, geheime Kenntis” bedeutet. Interessant ist dabei, daß der häufigste der mit –rún zusammengesetzen Namen im Nordischen Guðrún ist und daß dieser Name deshalb wahrscheinlich als Vorbild der anderen Namen gedient hat. In Guðrún scheint eine appellativisch sinnvolle Zusammensetzung vorzuliegen, und zwar ein Bahuvrīhi-Kompositum mit der Bedeutung “eine, die die Geheimnisse oder die geheimen Kenntisse der Götter besitzt”.’ (521). Citing Janzén 110ff., 166.\n\n‘Schließlich ist hier auf eine feminine Sonderbezeichnung hinzuweisen, nämlich awn. dís, womit weiblichne Gottheiten und übernatürliche Frauengestalten bezeichnet werden. Dieses Wort kommt vereinzelt in einigen Ortsnamen in Norwegen und Schweden vor, z. B. Disen (< -vin “Weise, Weide”) bzw. disevid (< -vi “Heiligtum” …). Auffallend ist, daß dís auch als Personenname und als Zweitglied von Personennamen (vgl. Oðindisa…) verkommt. Da ja Götterbezeichnungen in dieser Stellung sonst vermieden werden, deutet dies auf einen etwas niedrigeren Rang der dísir oder aber auf eine parallele, nicht-sakrale Bedeutung des Wortes’ (526). Citing Sandnes 1990, 91; Ström 1985, 192ff.\n\n‘Wenn es sich um Örtlichkeiten begrenzteren Umfangs handelt, liegt es nahe, Kultstätten zu vermuten. in sakralen Ortsnamen oft begegnende Wörter wie akr, lundr, under (besonders in Norwegen) vangr bezeichnen zweifellos oft alte Kutstätten … Begrenzte Örtlichkeiten mit Sakralnamen lassen aber keinesfalls durchgehend auf eigentliche Kultstätten schließen. Wärend z. B. Disevid (aschw. Disavi) in Östergötland eine Kultstätte der dísir bezeichnet, läßt sich nicht eindeutig eintscheiden, wie Diseberg (aschw. Disabærgh) in derselben Landschaft zu verstehen ist. Hier mag Disevid vergleichbare Kultstätte gelegen haben, aber es kann sich auch einfach um einem Berg handeln, der mit den besagten Gottheiten verknüpft und deshalb verehrt wurde’ (536).
