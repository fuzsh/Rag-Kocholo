Contributions welcome, send to editor@scuttlebutteurope.com\n\nYes... I missed yesterday's issue. Tornado, downed trees, no power or internet. It was a good night to have a working flashlight and a pile of books...\n\nMAXI72, Proteus (USA) Declared Overall Winner Of RORC Caribbean 600 Trophy\n\nPhoto by RORC / Emma Louise Wyn Jones. Click on image to enlarge.\n\nGeorge Sakellaris' Maxi72, Proteus (USA) has been declared the overall winner of the 2016 RORC Caribbean 600. Whilst several yachts are still racing, by the afternoon of Thursday 25 February the remaining teams will be unable to better Proteus' corrected time under IRC. Sakellaris was awarded the RORC Caribbean 600 Trophy for the best corrected time under the IRC Rating rule.\n\nIt is the second time that George Sakellaris has skippered the overall winner, having won the 2014 race with Maxi72, Shockwave. Proteus was also the winner of the highly competitive IRC Zero class featuring four Maxi72s.\n\nEric De Turkheim's French A13, Teasing Machine finished the RORC Caribbean 600 at 0710 AST on Thursday 25 February in an elapsed time of Two days and 20 hours to provisionally win IRC One and claim third overall for the race. In the eight editions of the RORC Caribbean 600 no other boat under 50ft has made the podium for the overall prize. As Teasing Machine moored stern to at Antigua Yacht Club, the mass of soaking wet offshore clothing on board was testament to a tough race.\n\nThe magnificent 213ft schooner, Adix finished the RORC Caribbean 600 at 0703 AST on Thursday 25 February in an elapsed time of 2 days 19 hours 33 minutes 5 seconds to win the Spirit of Tradition Class. Gonzalo Botin's Class40, Tales II finished at 0336 AST, over three hours before Adix. Both yachts are sailed by the same Spanish family and no doubt Gonzalo would have been delighted to win the Spanish duel in a boat that could fit on the stern of the spectacular schooner. Tales II was also the winner of the Class40 division for the third year in a row. The joy of Botin's Tales II team was complete when they crossed the line, breaking their own Class40 record by 11 minutes and 23 seconds to set a new Class40 record of 2 days 16 hours 26 minutes 29 seconds.\n\ncaribbean600.rorc.org\n\nRS:X World Windsurfing Championships\n\nEilat, Israel: In the morning the 15 knots North wind enabled three nice races for the Gold fleets. As scheduled, the races started at 11:00.\n\nThe wind weakened when at 13:30 the Silver fleets went out to have their races. The Race Officer tried to start the first race two times, but the wind stopped. After a while all were sent to shore, hoping to be re-called later.\n\nAs the wind didn't resume, this day was lost, and no races started for the Silver fleets.\n\nTomorrow the races will start earlier, at 08:30, starting with the Gold fleets again, assuming that the early start will allow completing three races for all fleets.\n\nTop five Men:\n\n1.

A long day for all, with around 8 hours spent out on the water.\n\nBirthday girl, Camille Lecointre and crew Helene Defrance (FRA) raced a dream series, 10,1, 6 and continue to hold the overall lead. Another superb day from China's Xiaoli Wang/Lizhu Huang, including a win in race 7 propels them to second overall, with Sydney Bolger/Carly Shevitz (USA) in third.\n\nIn the 470 Men, as predicted yesterday, the advantage was initially with Onan Barreiros/Juan Curbelo (ESP) who came into their own as the only team to count an all top ten scoreline, and bounced up to first overall after race 6. But a 21st and OCS penalty in races 7 and 8 dropped them to 7th by the end. Reclaiming the leader's bibs by the end are New Zealand's Paul Snow-Hansen/Daniel Wilcox, with Mat Belcher/Will Ryan (AUS) in third.\n\nThe camelote* plants made a return to the race track in greater numbers.

If there's even the slightest imperfection in boat, man or gear, this race will find it, break it, then tell everyone about it.\n\nFor most of us, it's the ultimate contest of man and machine against nature. For Dubarry, it's R&D. After supplying its ever-green Shamrock boot to the professional crew of Ireland's Green Dragon entry in a 2008-09 round the world race, Dubarry's most fanatical designers listened, developed, tested, listened some more, tweaked, analysed and tested again. The result was the Crosshaven boot.\n\nWhen Green Dragon arrived in Galway at the end of leg 7 for the best party the race has ever seen, elbowing their way through the \"craic addicts\" was Dubarry's research team, wanting yet more feedback. Their finishing touches sealed the Crosshaven's reputation as the offshore professional's boot of choice. Where's the proof of that? Professional teams chose Crosshaven in the 2011-12 and 2014-15 round the world races.\n\nDubarry Crosshaven - Born at sea\n\ndubarry.com\n\nLight Wind Forecast at the ACWS Oman\n\nThe 2016 Louis Vuitton America's Cup World Series (ACWS) is ready to kick off in Oman with the first event of the season.

For me at least it's a business expense!\n\nFrom Craig Leweck of Scuttlebutt:\n\nFor those in America's Cup fandom hoping for the good old days, not monohulls, but easy access to race viewing, we have some bad news. From all appearances, the only way you are going to watch the races in 2016 is if someone pays for it.\n\nThe go-to option in 2015 was the free app for smart phones or tablet, but with a cost of $7.99 per America's Cup World Series event, there was hope - go ahead, admit it - that this experiment in pay-per-view broadcast would be deemed a failure. How could it not be?\n\nWell, while not yet deemed a failure, the service is now being discounted. A season pass for 2016 (six events) is available now for $24.99. A weekend pass for each event is $7.99. The second-screen only option (for territories where rights restrictions preclude live race video coverage) is $3.99 for a weekend pass.\n\nwww.sailingscuttlebutt.com\n\nWhat Else To Watch\n\nFeb 28.16 \"World on Water\" Oman special we talk to Iain Murray pre LVACWS Oman where the forecast is 2-5 knot winds.David Witt says \"What Went Wrong\" on Rags 100 in the \"Hobart\", the Farr 40's wrap and there was \"Plenty\" of action, The RORC Caribbean 600 started in shorts and T shirts and the first major US race to Cuba.

After 3600 miles of solo sailing between the Canaries, Cape Verde, the Azores and Lorient, the skipper from the French Riviera and his boat, StMichel-Virbac are now qualified for both The Transat and the Vendee Globe. On 2nd May, Jean-Pierre will set off at the start of The Transat from Plymouth to New York. Then, he will compete in the new transatlantic race from New York to Vendee, which begins on 29th May. Two transatlantic races allowing him to continue to train for the Vendee Globe.\n\n\"I'm beginning to get to know my boat better and judging how to use the right sails. All these details add up and in the end, I have managed to keep up better speeds on my StMichel-Virbac than on my previous boat. Today, I feel more confident. I have sailed in winds going up to 35 knots. StMichel-Virbac accelerates and slows down very quickly too. She slams a lot and these flying IMOCAs feel different.

You might think that adrenaline sports and rough weather pose the greatest threat, but casual, everyday activities around the coast can cause fatalities. In fact, over 200 people accidentally die each year around our coast; the RNLI want to change this.\n\nThe charity that saves lives at sea has a goal to halve the number of coastal drownings by 2024. 'Respect the Water' is the RNLI's national drowning prevention campaign and will play a key role in helping them to achieve this. The RNLI still want you to enjoy the water, but they also want you to 'Respect the Water', acknowledge its dangers and never underestimate its power.\n\nCowes Harbour Commission (CHC) is one of the first UK harbour authorities to be working jointly with the RNLI on promoting the Respect the Water campaign, and so you may see Respect the Water messages in and around our Harbour Commission sites, on CHC vessels, at Cowes RNLI lifeboat station, in yacht clubs and even local pubs.\n\nwww.cowesharbourcommission.co.uk/rnli_respect_the_water\n\nLetters To The Editor - editor@scuttlebutteurope.com\n\nLetters are limited to 350 words. No personal attacks are permitted. We do require your name but your email address will not be published without your permission.\n\n* From Brent Isaacson: Broadcasters' priorities are driven by their self interest in viewership. The proposed broadcasting times of the Americas Cup World Series shows that most of the world is getting it live on TV whereas the US only gets a delayed summary broadcast - unless you assume that Americans prefer to watch on a tablet rather than a large screen TV (but why should Americans viewing habits be different from the rest of the world?).\n\nGiven this apparent lack of interest by Americans and the fact that the vast majority of yachting innovations reported in Seahorse are from outside the US, one can only conclude that Americans are not interested in fast sailing. This is confirmed by the proposed 12metre series in San Francisco being launched to rapturous US applause as support for slow sailing.\n\nWhy is this the case? Does the US constitution say that thou shall not exceed hullspeed?\n\nFeatured Brokerage\n\nHH66 - NEW BOAT\n\nA new range of high-performance luxury cruising catamarans join this expanding sector.

A nail-biting final day saw the team come from behind in all three races to snatch victory by just two points from Oracle Team USA.\n\nSuper Sunday delivers double points for all three races and the tension was high - skippers were pulling the trigger early with multiple boats over the start line and twice Land Rover BAR was one of them.\n\nThe first race the team had a clean start but rounded first reach in sixth place, they fought their way through the pack to take second. The next race, the British team were one of three boats over the line, meaning another tough fight back, this time grabbing fourth in the final metres of the race.\n\nThe final double point race saw the team jump the start again, and this time the team were just able to claw their way back to third, right behind the America's Cup holders, Oracle Team USA (OTUSA) who were overtaken by Groupama Team France. It was enough to take the event by just two points from OTUSA, with Emirates Team New Zealand another four points back in third.\n\nLouis Vuitton America's Cup World Series Oman - Final Leaderboard:\n\nLand Rover BAR - 8, 10, 10, 18, 14, 16 - 76 points\n\nORACLE TEAM USA - 9, 6, 9, 12, 20, 18 - 74 points\n\nEmirates Team New Zealand - 10, 7, 5, 20, 16, 12 - 70 points\n\nGroupama Team France - 5, 8, 7, 10, 18, 20 - 68 points\n\nSoftBank Team Japan - 6, 9, 6, 16, 10, 14 - 61 points\n\nArtemis Racing - 7, 5, 8, 14, 12, 10 - 56 points\n\nLouis Vuitton America's Cup World Series Overall Leaderboard:\n\nEmirates Team New Zealand 192\n\nORACLE TEAM USA 186\n\nLand Rover BAR 185\n\nSoftBank Team Japan 161\n\nArtemis Racing 161\n\nGroupama Team France 150\n\nlandroverbar.com\n\namericascup.com\n\nGold Medals To France and Croatia On Final Day at 470 Worlds\n\nClub Nautico San Isidro, Argentina: In a medal race battle to the end, stepping away victorious with Gold medals are Camille Lecointre/Helene Defrance (FRA) and Sime Fantela/Igor Marenic (CRO).\n\nA nail biting conclusion to the preceding five day of racing all came down to the medal races at the 2016 470 World Championship in Argentina.\n\nIn the 470 Women, any one of the top eight going into the medal race had a punt at a medal, whilst in the 470 Men the podium chancers were a bit more clear cut. Series leaders, Sime Fantela/Igor Marenic (CRO) were guaranteed a medal and fighting for gold with the Kiwis and Aussies. Whilst the French were in the hunt for silver or bronze.\n\nAfter yesterday's storms, calms and in-betweens, medal race day was a much more sanguine schedule. The 470 Women got off first at 1100 hours for their short, sharp twenty-five minute windward/leeward race, followed by the 470 Men.\n\nThe scoreboard puts three-time World Champions Mat Belcher/Will Ryan (AUS) and Sofian Bouvet/Jeremie Mion (FRA) on tiebreak, from a redress decision due to a scoring error.

Charline Picon crossed the finish line first, followed by Stefania Elfutina in second and Bryony Shaw in third. A World Championship win from a genius saw Malgorzata Bialecka claim her 1st RS:X World Championship. Silver to Bryony Shaw, and Lilian de Geus completing the podium with bronze.\n\nMen, stampede off the starting line, saw them fast and furious on the first upwind leg. As Piotr Myszka already secured the title from the penultimate day, the battle for race remaining podium spots was well and truly on. Choosing the best side of the track, Shahar Zubari managed to control the medal race from early on. Really close behind him in 2nd was Dorian Van Rijsselberge and Mateo Sanz Lanz in third.\n\nNick Dempsey, after getting redress for an incident at the 6th final race and started the day from 2nd place, didn't manage to keep the Dutch windsurfers behind him by finally getting the 4th place of the championship.

By the first mark LMAX Exchange was in the lead, followed by GREAT Britain, Mission Performance and Derry~Londonderry~Doire, and this order remained throughout the three mark round-the-can start before the fleet headed north-east to China.\n\nThe Sailing City - Qingdao Cup has the potential to be the most challenging of the 14-race global series so far as the teams face a long beat into the wind. Clipper Race Founder and Chairman Sir Robin Knox-Johnston explains: \"This is going to be a bash. You go up north of here and level with Taiwan and you'll be getting waves without anything behind them so the boat slams down.\"\n\n\"That's when you get winds and tides working against each other, but the winds tend to come from the north, right across northern Russia and Mongolia so they are very, very cold. There will be sleet and snow, crew really do need all the warm clothing they can find.\"\n\nRace 8 from Da Nang, Vietnam to Qingdao, China is approximately 1700nM, but given the weather, tide and sea state conditions that lie in wait, the teams could end up recording a much higher mileage as they tack their way upwind and zig-zag against head winds and challenging currents.\n\nThe fleet due to arrive in Qingdao from around 10-13 March.\n\nwww.clipperroundtheworld.com\n\nNespresso Youth International Match Racing Cup\n\nTwenty year old George Anyon representing the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron's Youth Training Programme, with his team of Logan Andresen, Josh Wijohn and Patrick Haybittle, have won the NESPRESSO Youth International Match Racing Cup.\n\nAnyon defeated Cruising Yacht Club of Australia's Murray Jones 2-1 in the best of three series.

The reason is quite simple: in spite of all the advances in boat design, technology and methods of navigation, the challenges faced by those sailing in the high Arctic have remained basically the same.\n\nClimate change, the effects of which are more obvious in the Arctic than anywhere else in the world, has certainly played a role in making conditions for a successful transit somewhat easier but, as I found out myself on my first attempt, however well prepared you might be, Mother Nature still has the last word.\n\nRead more www.yachtingworld.com\n\nShining (New) Stars\n\nSeahorse readers will know that in the July 2015 issue we wrote about World Sailing's training and development department in an article entitled 'Helping to bring the (whole) world up to speed'. We outlined our Emerging Nations' Program (ENP) in which we aim to increase participation and bridge the gap between underdeveloped and developed nations. The 2015 Youth Sailing World Championships in Langkawi, Malaysia gave us as an organisation the opportunity to measure the success of the programme's first full year.\n\nParticipation and performance are two great measurement yardsticks. When we look at the participation, this was the most successful Youth World Championship to date, with 425 sailors from 76 nations attending to set a new record in Malaysia. The previous best was 67 nations at the 2014 edition in Tavira, Portugal.\n\nAnd these numbers could have been even higher.\n\nwww.seahorsemagazine.com\n\nExclusive Rob Coutts Fine Art Prints To Help The Finnteam\n\nRob Coutts has very generously provided the Finn class with exclusive access to five of his original oil paintings to offer authorised prints for sale through the Finnshop.

Located in Portsmouth, RI\n\nKIWI MAGIC is for sale. World famous for being the last and best built of the three 'plastic fantastics\" which were known as KZ 3, KZ 5 and this boat KZ 7. Updated winches, sails, deck hardware, there is not much left on this boat from her original days of blasting around in Perth Australia during the 1987 Americas Cup. Since that glorious time in sailing, she has had several loving owners that have spared no expense to keep her in a near perfect condition. In recent years she has spent much of her time stored in a heated shed in Rhode Island, but she was last sailed in the 2012 12 Meter North Americans, which she won handily.

As always the event will combine some of the closest and most exciting inshore racing anywhere in the world with a fun social programme and great class camaraderie.\n\nAnother new development for this year's event is the introduction of an additional class. Class Chairman Peter \"Morty\" Morton explains the reasoning behind this. \"What has occurred over the past few years is that the prototypes and past class winners have been upgraded considerably and in an attempt to encourage the production and older boats back to the event the organisers intend to run a second class provided sufficient numbers enter, known as the cruiser racer class. This will be for boats of a rating of 0.89 and below and for boats such as a GK24, Bolero, Quarto, Farr 727's, Eygthene 24's, Trapper 300. We know there are literally hundreds of those around and hopefully enough of them want to enjoy the regatta. They will be racing for the Roger Swinney Quarter Ton Trophy and it is intended that a round the buoys course will be set for them.\"\n\nThe Quarter Tonners have suffered two sad losses in the past year. Roger Swinney, a founding member of the revived Quarter Ton Class, first with the 1979 David Thomas designed Tsunami, which he renamed Ayanami, and then later with the 1986 McIlraith designed Innuendo, sadly passed away in November. His joie de vivre and love of the Quarter Tonners made him a hugely popular figure with his fellow sailors and he will be much missed.\n\nAnother much loved member of the class lost recently is the legendary Espada, a 1980 Bruce Farr design and winner of no less than three Coutts Quarter Ton Cups, which was destroyed in a boatyard fire in January. Morty is working closely with Espada's owner Julian Metherell to find him a replacement in time for the season.\n\nThe Notice of Race, Entry Form and further information will be available shortly from www.rys.org.uk\n\nSeahorse Sailor Of The Month\n\nThis month's nominees:\n\nSteve Benjamin (USA)\n\nBeaten by 0.5pt at Key West on his latest TP52 Spookie, Benj is still winning everywhere else, racking up the prizes in his Etchells where he is giving the 'old guard' a serious run for their money. And undeterred by the way that the HPR initiative, into which he put a great deal of effort, has fizzled out, Benjy is still working away hard to promote the development of big boat racing in the US and elsewhere\n\nRob Greenhalgh (GBR)\n\nAnother sailor putting heart and soul into advancing the big boat scene is Britain's finest... Volvo veteran and multiple skiff, Int 14 and Moth champion Greenhalgh has now spent over 18-months on point as a bunch of owners and sailors work together to get the Fast40+ initiative up and rolling. Right now it looks like the boy done good, with 14 boats registered for their first season as a class including several new designs\n\nLast month's winner:\n\nRandy Draftz (USA)\n\n'For his tireless work to promote good sailboat racing Randy fully deserves this honour' - Jay Hansen; 'What Randy does to promote sailing for the young and old affects thousands every year' - Syd Shuler; 'He has grown Charleston Race Week from nothing' - Ray Groble; '40 years as a great ambassador of the sport' - Earl Lyden; 'His regatta is the best!' - Louisa Fleming; 'He sets a great example of how a regatta should be run!' - Kirk Weichsel; 'Watching his regatta explode has inspired sailing in this area' - Logan Bonner.\n\nSeahorse Sailor of the Month is sponsored by Musto, Harken McLube & Dubarry.

With Some America's Cup Flair\n\nThe announcement is online, registrations for Kieler Woche (18. until 26 June) just started, and there are already the first big names on the participants' list promising top-class Kieler Woche races: Peter Burling/Blair Tuke (New Zealand) and Mathew Belcher/Will Bryan (Australia). The four top sailors bring Olympic glamour and America's Cup flair to Kiel.\n\nThe invincibles: Peter Burling/Blair Tuke. The athletes from New Zealand have been dominating the 49er class since 2013 and did not loose any regatta series since then. The Kiwis did win the World Championship in the Olympic skiff class four times in a row, last time in the USA in February. At the Olympics 2012 in London, only the Australians Nathan Outteridge and Ian Jensen were faster, no one else after that. Burling/Tuke won a silver medal.\n\nBut since the Olympics in London, where Burling has been the youngest one in the 49er fleet with just 21 years, the sailors from New Zealand haven't let the Australians pass, collecting all titles (like the European Championships in 2013 and 2015) and were nominated world sailors of the year.\n\nAround 4,000 sailors from more than 50 countries are expected at the Olympic center in Kiel-Schilksee to find the Kieler Woche winners among them in the different classes. And the Kieler Woche again offers further highlights in its 134th year. The Youth Worlds in the 470 class, the European Championship of the popular class of the national sailing leagues J/70 and the four international German Championships will take place at the Kieler Woche. -- Herman Hell\n\nKieler Woche (18. until 26.

W M Nixon was there, and though he tells us \"his head was melted\" with the sheer volume of the range of issues discussed and explained, he'll do his best to let us know what happened:\n\nIt went on for seven hours and more, and ranged from the extremities of dealing with calving glaciers in Greenland at one end, to the niceties of lone male watch-keepers dealing safely and efficiently with the calls of nature in mid ocean at the other. And since you ask, there were two distinct camps for dealing with Problem B – those who favour a simple bottle, narrow enough to be stowed in a convenient winch handle holder, and those who think a yoghurt tub with its cover kept usable is your only man, as some folk need a bit of space to perform.\n\nAs for the sheer length of the programme, as a group of friends and shipmates attending together we agreed it should have been an hour shorter. But then we couldn't think of one single item on the agenda that we would have happily discarded. So for 2018 (or next year, if the current plan to make it biennial is reckoned to be wimpishly unambitious), Paddy McGlade the ISA Board Member for Cruising, and Clifford Brown, Commodore of the Cruising Association of Ireland, will have to agree to the same densely-filled programme, and it's beholden on the participants and the audience to be up for the challenge.\n\nWM Nixon's report in Afloat:\n\nafloat.ie/blogs/\n\nNorfolk Boatyard Up For National Award For Build Of Rare Broads Sailboat\n\nThey first graced the Broads in the 1940s, having been specially designed for navigating the network of waterways.\n\nBut steep construction costs meant production of wooden-hulled Rebel sailing boats was halted by 1960, with just 13 in the exclusive class.\n\nDecades went by - and it was only in 2007 that cheaper fibreglass hulls were introduced to breathe new life into the fleet, with two new Rebels built.\n\nNow, a Norfolk boatyard is up for a national award for its work on Rebel Reiver - the 16th, and newest, addition to the fleet.\n\nGerry Hermer and son-in-law Rob Marriott, of Belaugh Boatyard, were asked to build the latest craft after their restoration of Rebel One, the very first to be built.\n\nThe duo spent six months of last year - or an estimated 500 man hours - meticulously building the new boat, which has earned them a nomination in the under 40ft Spirit of Tradition category of the Classic Boat Awards.\n\nwww.edp24.co.uk\n\nClassic Boat Awards: www.classicboat.co.uk/awards2016/\n\nViper 640 International Championship\n\n2016 marks the 20th anniversary of the design of the Viper 640 and the 10th anniversary of the relaunch of the Class Association. The Class is now a truly international class with Viper 640 fleets active in seven nations across three continents. The Class Association is celebrating these milestones by hosting the first Viper 640 International Championship, with sailors competing for a prestigious new trophy open to Viper teams from around the world.\n\nThe International Championship will be hosted by the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club and the Royal Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Club on Bermuda's Great Sound November 16-19, 2016, preceded by a warm-up regatta November 13-14. There are over 50 Viper 640s already registered for the International Championship, with representative teams coming from North America, Europe and Australia, and it is anticipated this number will grow in the coming months. This will be the largest one–design keel boat regatta ever hosted in Bermuda.\n\nThe Viper 640 was originally designed and built in 1996. The Class was relaunched in the U.S. in 2006 with a new, self-governing Viper 640 Class Association and a new builder (Rondar Raceboats in the UK).\n\nRegatta documents can be found on Yacht Scoring:\n\nyachtscoring.com/emenu.cfm?eID=1577\n\nRefined 2016 ORC Superyacht Rule Now Officially Published\n\nAs every year, this edition will also see a large diversity of boat types, with 300-ton giants sparring with feather-light carbon rockets. Trying to have fair racing amid this tremendous imbalance in weight, shape and size has been the inspiration to develop the ORCsy rule which debuted at the St. Barths Bucket early last year.\n\nDeveloped by ORC, this rating system combines a sophisticated velocity prediction program (VPP) with 'dynamic allowances' - which means concessions are made for yachts with, for example, a sizeable satellite dome, a substantial super structure or a furling jib which can slow down a yacht's performance.\n\nAfter each of the 7 events in 2015 that used the ORCsy rating, more was learned about the processes and application of the rule and so it was fine-tuned accordingly. Also the VPP has been steadily developed and adjusted by ORC and SYRA, reaching a total of no less than 48 revisions.\n\nThe Offshore Racing Congress (ORC) and the SuperYacht Racing Association (SYRA) are pleased to announce that the 2016 version of the ORC SuperYacht Rule (ORCsy), which among others will be applied at the Loro Piana Superyacht Regatta & Rendezvous, the St. Barths Bucket and of course the Superyacht Cup, is now available online.\n\nwww.orc.org/index.asp?id=201\n\nQueen Of Irish Yachting Moonduster Is 'Sad Sight' In Norway\n\nThere has been plenty of comment on social media about the current condition of the much loved Irish yacht Moonduster, the former Round Ireland record holder skippered by the late Denis Doyle of the Royal Cork Yacht Club.\n\n'Sad to see this. Many happy hours on that beautiful vessel in and out of Cork Harbour', says Stu McLoughlin echoing many similar comments about the state of the one time pristine Frers 51 that was the pride of the Irish fleet in the 1980s.\n\nDoyle owned four different Moondusters in his long career. His last boat, arguably the best known, the varnished Frers, was sold to Norway around 2005 where she is still sailing but as can be seen in the photographs not in the same state of repair as she had been in Crosshaven.\n\n'...She's in a shocking state, clearly her current and previous owners never cared too much about her. However, she's still salvageable but for how much longer? says Mark Richards on Facebook.\n\nThe queen of all fleets. Denis Doyle's legendary Moonduster was the flagship of Irish offshore racing for twenty years. Readers will recall Bob Bateman's 1988 classic photograph of Doyle at the helm. Doyle's enthusiastic support moved the Round Ireland Race into the international league, and his regular participation set performance standards which greatly enhanced the event.\n\nafloat.ie/item/31463-irish-yacht-moonduster-is-a-sad-sight\n\nLetters To The Editor - editor@scuttlebutteurope.com\n\nLetters are limited to 350 words. No personal attacks are permitted. We do require your name but your email address will not be published without your permission.\n\n* From John Burnie: More than a few lines have been written about the latest (8th) edition of the RORC Caribbean 600 - just a few comments to add. This race was sensational due to the very bright moonlight that was present throughout the dark hours. On a fast reach from Desirade (for a second rounding of the North Sails Buoy) to Barbuda, the experience of high speed sailing at night on our boat was nothing short of spectacular. Head torches were barely used throughout the race - during the dark hours it really felt quite ethereal - much like sailing above the Arctic Circle in summer (except in shorts!).\n\nFurther - I do not believe there is a finer finish or better welcome in many other offshore events. Leaving aside the hard beat from Redonda (not always popular - but a serious test of resolve!) the night laser finish from the hill at English Harbour is quite incredible. This followed by a traditional volunteer RORC team greeting every single yacht to finish on a 24 hrs basis - with cheers, beers followed by an invitation to attend immediately the cafe / bar that remains open throughout the duration of the race. The place was always hopping!\n\nWell done the RORC for its organisation and its volunteer army - as already said - quite spectacular.\n\nFeatured Brokerage\n\n2003 Maxi KALAO. 980,000 EUR.

World Sailing will now immediately start to work with its Member National Authorities to rapidly identify an alternative venue for the 2016 Youth Sailing World Championships at the same time of year as the event originally planned for Oman.\n\nFollowing the publication of the World Sailing statement on Discrimination on the 13 January 2016 (http://www.sailing.org/news/39107.php), World Sailing can now confirm that it has received written confirmation from all venues that have already been selected and confirmed for forthcoming World Sailing championships that they are able to guarantee full and equal participation by all, in accordance with World Sailing's Regulations.\n\nWorld Sailing's action follows the clarification of the non-discrimination elements of the Olympic Charter from the International Olympic Committee Summit on 17 October 2015.\n\nsailing.org\n\n* The Israel Sailing Association (ISA) welcomed Monday's developments with satisfaction after initially being concerned that its representatives would be barred from future competitions in Arab countries despite World Sailing's announcements.\n\n\"This is a great victory for normality and for the real sporting values over politics,\" said ISA chairman Gili Amir. \"This announcement shows that World Sailing chiefs understood the injustice suffered by the Israeli athletes and they showed that they will not accept discrimination between countries.\"\n\nwww.jpost.com\n\nFremantle Again At The Centre Of World-Class Match Racing\n\nFremantle, Australia: Back in 1987, the eyes of the sailing world were on Fremantle in Western Australia for the America's Cup. Now almost 30 years on, Fremantle once again hosts some of the greatest match racers of the modern era, with the 2016 World Match Racing Tour season about to commence on Wednesday.\n\nJust as Dennis Conner and Stars & Stripes wrenched back the Cup from Australia on the turbulent waters of the Indian Ocean, Taylor Canfield and his Team US One are hoping they can exert their early advantage in a new season of the Tour, having lost out to Ian Williams and GAC Pindar in last season's finale a little over a month ago.\n\nWith the switch from the slower keelboats to high-performance M32 catamarans for future editions of the Tour, Canfield once again fancies his chances at winning another world title. TeamUS One have the benefit of more than a season competing in M32 fleet racing circuits both in the USA and Scandinavia.\n\nThe six-day regatta in Fremantle, taking place off the famous Bather's Beach, is the first of five World Championship Events across three continents - Australasia, Europe and America, all leading up to the finale of this so-called 'short season' which culminates with the World Championship in Marstrand this July.\n\nWith 20 teams competing in Fremantle, the first two days of the regatta are fleet racing, which sees the 20 split up into four groups of five boats, and each group scheduled to complete four or five back-to-back races each day. Then the second phase of the regatta moves into a knock-out match racing contest more in line with the typical elimination format of the World Match Racing Tour.\n\nwmrt.com\n\nWMRT Debut For Yann Guichard\n\nFrom March 2nd to 7th, Yann Guichard and his crew will make their maiden appearance in the World Match Racing Tour at the year's opening event in Fremantle (Perth), Australia. Yann is the only French skipper taking part in the 2016 championship, in which participants will race M32 catamarans.\n\nThe Spindrift racing crew compete in Copenhagen in May and Newport in June before travelling to Marstrand in Sweden for the coveted World Match Race Championship Finals in early July.\n\nThe skipper decided to select crew members he knows well, who have been competing for Spindrift racing for many years, both in regattas and offshore events. All of them were part of the Spindrift 2 crew that sailed around the world in 47 days, the second fastest time ever set on the Jules Verne Trophy course. Joining Yann on the M32 will be Christophe Espagnon, operating the mainsail, and Francois Morvan, trimming the sails, both of whom are highly skilled specialists in small monohulls. Sebastien Marsset will complete the four-man crew, adding his superb technique and physical power on the foredeck.\n\nwww.spindrift-racing.com\n\nDubarry Ultima - Quality Always Lasts\n\nIt's amazing to think how sailing has changed since Dubarry started making boots in 1937. The first marina arrived in the 1930s but there were no plastic boats to park in it before the 1940s. There was no yacht radar before the 1950s, nor auxiliary diesel engines before the 1960s, also when polyester sailcloth ousted linen and cotton. The 1970s brought instrumentation and the 1980s saw Decca come and go as GPS stole the show. Oiled canvas gave way to PVC, which yielded to GORE-TEX. Much indeed has changed, yet one thing has stayed the same: nothing signifies a confident, experienced, discerning yachtie like a pair of Dubarry boots.\n\nDeveloped as a more luxurious, classical and traditional interpretation of the legendary Shamrock, on which the company's reputation was built, the Ultima is Dubarry's flagship boot. Its sole delivers award-winning, sure-footed grip. Its GORE-TEX liner is waterproof and breathable to keep you warm, dry and comfortable. Its Dry-Fast-Dry-Soft water-resistant leather weathers with grace and distinction, recording every nautical mile of your experience in the gentle, tanned folds of its sumptuous hide. It's clearer than ever that, though times may change, quality always lasts.\n\nDubarry Ultima - Where will you go in yours?\n\ndubarry.com\n\nGJW Direct Sailjuice Winter Series\n\nThe seventh edition of the GJW Direct Sailjuice Winter Series came down to a battle of dinghy world champions, with GP14 World Champs Ian Dobson and Andy Tunnicliffe getting the better of Fireball World Champion Tom Gillard, who campaigned over the winter with Andy Couch in a 505.\n\nWe've seen many extreme conditions during past seasons of the GJW Direct Sailjuice Winter Series, but never have we witnessed a winter as consistently windy as in 2015/16.\n\nGoing into the final event, the Rutland Challenge for the John Merricks Tiger Trophy, Ben Schooling was leading the Series after some exceptional boathandling in his Musto Skiff at previous events including the Oxford Dash which he won. But the big breeze at Rutland proved too much even for Schooling. And so it came back to a renewal of that Draycote battle between Gillard and Dobson, with Dobson again sailing his GP14 incredibly effectively in the strong winds to finish 6th at Rutland, just one place behind Gillard's Five-Oh. That was good enough to give Dobson and Tunnicliffe overall victory this season, making the GP14 the sixth dinghy class to win the overall prize in seven seasons of the GJW Direct Sailjuice Winter Series.\n\nThe prizegiving for the GJW Direct SailJuice Winter Series takes place at the RYA Suzuki Dinghy Show, with some of the prize winners and leading sailors from the Series appearing on the Main Stage on both the Saturday and Sunday at 1.45pm. Multiple Fireball and Merlin Rocket Champion and America's Cup TV pundit Richard Parslow will be the M.C., coaxing the best go-faster tips and techniques from the winners. -- Andy Rice\n\nFor full results from the Series: www.SailJuiceSeries.com\n\nNewport Bermuda Race Offers New Youth Awards\n\nThe Newport Bermuda Race is well known as a long-distance ocean adventure with a special appeal for ambitious young sailors. Many of today's skippers, navigators, and watch captains first went to sea as teenage deck hands in a \"Thrash to the Onion Patch,\" or in a return delivery from Bermuda.\n\nTo further encourage offshore youth sailor participation, the Bermuda Race Organizing Committee announced on February 22, 2016, that it has established two new awards for young sailors, the Stephens Brothers Society and the Youth Trophy. They parallel similar projects by the Marion Bermuda Cruising Yacht Race and other races.\n\nThe youngest winning skipper in the Bermuda Race's history, age 22, is U.S. Naval Academy graduate Kyle Weaver in 1992.\n\nSailors between the ages of 14 and 23 who participate in the upcoming 50th Bermuda Race will be inducted into the Stephens Brothers Society, named for the legendary sailors and yacht designers Olin J. Stephens and Roderick S. Stephens, Jr.\n\nThe second new Newport Bermuda Race award for young sailors is the Youth Trophy. Crews are eligible for this prize if at least one-half the sailors (plus one person) are between 14 and 23 years old, with an average age of at least 17. The winner is the boat in the St. David's Lighthouse and Cruiser divisions that has the best performance based on cross-divisional results.\n\nBermudaRace.com\n\nAn Outstanding History\n\nClick on image for photo gallery.\n\nDesigned in 1938 by Uffa Fox, as a one design boat suitable for team racing, the 2016 season marks the 70th Anniversary of Firefly Class; the first boats came off the production line at Fairey Marine, Hamble, in 1946. It was originally requested by Oxford and Cambridge Universities, requiring a dinghy similar to the National 12, but more suitable for team racing.\n\nThe design was completed in 1939 just prior to hostilities that would put back any ideas of production for more than six years. After the War, the Fairey Aviation Company had the idea of manufacturing a dinghy using the principles that constructed so many wooden Mosquito aircraft fuselages during the war, with diagonal laminates formed on a mould and cured by electrically heated bands holding the laminate in position.\n\nThe Firefly proved a great success in its early years with the first boats selling for just £65.00!\n\nAs the 1948 Olympics in Britain approached, there were very few dinghies available in numbers, but the Firefly could be built quickly and in volume, so was selected as the single handed sailing dinghy for the Games.\n\nSome of the most famous names in sailing have previously raced Fireflies, including Paul Elvstrom, Bruce Banks, Richard Creagh Osborne and Jack Holt as well as current and six times World Match Racing champion Ian Williams.\n\nTo celebrate this historic milestone the class and suppliers have come together to prize draw a brand new complete boat as a prize. It will require entrants to \"beg, steal or borrow\" a boat and compete in any of the nominated events or qualifying via club races this season, to secure a ticket in the prize draw for a brand new boat. The more race entries equals more prize draw chances.

She launched ReMain in 2007, and has spent millions to buy properties, including a popular bookstore that was in danger of closing. She led efforts to save the island's theater and launched a culinary center last year.\n\nShe and her husband also have financed environmental and oceanographic research projects, including a massive vessel - the Falkor - that has partnered with marine researchers based in Woods Hole.\n\nwww.tradeonlytoday.com\n\nShanghai Launches Youth Sailing Initiative\n\nThe Shanghai government recently announced a fantastic new initiative. Perhaps the feeling is with a city GDP in excess of USD 1Tr that having built the city's wealth it is time to build the city's health.\n\nIn plans released recently the city fathers announced their aim to get 13 million of the city's population actively involved in organized sport or fitness by 2025 - that's just under 10 years and an ambitious target. Having said that, Shanghai has a habit of achieving its ambitions. And it isn't just a ton of spots shoes that will be needed. A whole raft of hardware and software across all sports will have to be developed as time goes by and that included boating and the other outdoor sorts representd and promoted at the China (Shanghai) International Boat Show and its sisters.\n\nIt has been announced that over the next 5 years Shanghai Sports Bureau aims to introduce a staggering 200,000 school children to the sport of sailing. Thankfully the city is blessed with a number of sizeable lakes as this breaks down to an average of 40,000 children a year.\n\nThis of course brings along with it, a healthy percentage of parents plus a high probability that many of these kids will want to go beyond just that introduction.\n\nIf the water leisure industry in the Shanghai and Yangtze Delta region needed a shot in the arm, it looks like it might just have received it.\n\nIt Just Got Easier to Visit the China (Shanghai) International Boat Show!\n\nA new policy means that visitors to China from 51 major countries entering through Shanghai, Hangzhou and Nanjing can now enjoy a visa free stay in China of up to 6 (six) days.\n\nWith the Shanghai Show running over 4 days this gives visitors ample to time to arrive, adjust, take in the show, a day of site-seeing (or quick factory visit) and then home. No need to write to the embassy or consulate in your locale and fill in forms. Just book flight and accommodation and come and check out the largest Boat Show in Asia in the world's fastest growing economy - with the similarly fastest growing leisure marine scene.\n\nCheck your travel agent for details and see you at the show.\n\nThe China (Shanghai) International Boat Show runs from 7th to the 10th April 2016 -- Alistair Skinner\n\nRoger Hickman\n\nRoger Hickman, one of the true stalwarts of ocean racing and good friend to many sailors around the country, passed away in Sydney overnight and Yachting Australia offers their condolences to Sandy, his family and crew.\n\nFondly known as 'Hicko', Roger had over 40 years of ocean racing experience, was an active Board and Committee member at CYCA for over 20 years, President of Yachting NSW for two terms also serving as Vice President, and Chair of the Yachting NSW Special Regulations Committee for many years.\n\nRoger and his crew on 'Wild Rose' are the current IRC Australian Champions in Division C having completed back-to-back wins at Hamilton Island in 2015 and Newcastle in 2014 and was on-board Matt Allen's Ichiban in 2004 taking out the IRC Australian Championship and IMS Australian Championship.\n\nRoger competed in 37 Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Races with much success including winning the 2014 race with Wild Rose, as Sailing Master on SAP Ausmaid winning in 2000 and was co-Skipper on Solbourne Wild Oats taking out the 1993 race.\n\nHe was an active Etchells, Dragon and Laser sailor and has an extensive list of Championships and regatta wins over many years. Roger showed a passionate commitment to safety and will be remembered as a great leader and teacher to his crews.\n\nAs a member of numerous Clubs across Australia, 'Hicko' had many friends who will miss his laughter, good company and wisdom and the sailing community has lost one of its great characters.\n\nFeatured Brokerage\n\nTan 66 - NEW BOAT\n\nThe latest entrant into the large performance cat market comes from an all-French design and build team working under the management of Dubai-based Tan Yachts - which was founded by entrepreneur Xavier Bouin.\n\nDetails\n\nContact\n\nXavier Bouin\n\n+971(0)55 602 53 86\n\nxavier@tanorient.com\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n2014 Aquila Reichel Pugh 45. 500,000 USD.\n\nLeading performance yacht manufacturers, Sino Eagle, are excited to announce the New Aquila RP 45 IRC Racer Cruiser.

With the fast-reaching starts - another major change to the traditional format of the World Match Racing Tour - the premium on making a quick and pinpoint accurate start is higher than ever.\n\nFor all 20 teams, the learning curve in this new era of racing is extremely steep, and the team that learns quicker than the rest can expect to do very well, both here in Fremantle and for this short season for the World Match Racing Tour which reaches its crescendo this July in Marstrand, Sweden at Match Cup Sweden.\n\nThursday's racing concludes the qualifying series of fleet racing, and the forecast of a more forceful Fremantle Doctor promises to deliver more spectacular racing for the spectators, both at the venue and live online.\n\nwww.wmrt.com\n\nA Look Inside The New M32 Build Facility\n\nThere are few names more respected in the world of high-performance yachting than Killian Bushe. Beginning his apprenticeship under his father George over 40 years ago, Bushe struck out on his own in 1978.\n\nSince then, the list of boats built, project-managed, or otherwise benefitting from Bushe's work could double as a history of successful offshore yachting. Best-known over the past decade and a half for his hand in building 4 of the past 5 Volvo Ocean Race winners, Bushe was excited by the chance to join the M32 family and take on a new challenge in building the M32 Catamaran\n\nM32World: You've run some of the most advanced yacht building programs in the world, and the new M32 facility is now at the very cutting edge of that business. What features are so special about the new facility? What are you most proud of?\n\nKillian: The main features that make this building special are the amount of open space and the open plan, and the state-of-the-art dust control systems. These features allow a builder to easily and efficiently put together just about any boat or composite part. We're especially happy about the ultra-modern sanding boxes (which double as spray booths) and their dust-extraction systems. The building's design also makes for a worker-friendly environment. A happy work force equals good products, and like all companies, Aston Harald needs a work force that wants to come to work!\n\nThe new building also has a clever office layout to allow the sales and marketing team to work at their best, too. It has a raised mezzanine floor with a glass wall from which customers can view the production line when they visit, and it has a view of these 'Viking islands' from the lunch room that you could only dream about.

The defending senior champion Ivan Kljakovic Gaspic (CRO) will be looking for his fourth European title, but more importantly he is still looking to close down the selection series for Rio against Milan Vujasinovic (CRO). Their selections end in May, so this event is not being used, but will be crucial for confidence building for both of them.\n\nThe defending Junior Champion, Arkadiy Kistanov (RUS) will have just as tough a battle to defend his title against at least 20 other juniors, as well as looking to stake his claim for a place in Rio, should Russia win the final European place in Palma.\n\nThe USA results based trials will conclude in Barcelona with 2008 Qingdao silver medalist Zach Railey (USA) going in one point ahead of Caleb Paine (USA) after the first leg at the Sailing World Cup Miami.\n\nMeanwhile, the Italian trials continue through to the Gold Cup in May, with a strong team of eight athletes competing in Barcelona. While Italy has already qualified for Rio, Spain and Poland have not yet and are fielding large teams in Barcelona, but as usual the largest team is Russia with nine athletes taking part.\n\n2016.finneuropeans.org\n\nwww.finnclass.org\n\nBronenosec The Class Act In Brisk Bermuda\n\nFor the first round of the RC44's 2016 championship, Bermuda today demonstrated exactly why it is a perfect venue for next year's America's Cup.\n\nOn day one of the RC44 Bermuda Cup, there was sun, flat water and around 20 knots of wind, gusting into the high 20s by the close of play on Bermuda's Great Sound.\n\nComing from winning the 2015 RC44 Match Racing Championship, Vladimir Liubomirov's Bronenosec Sailing Team again put in a top performance, through good boat speed, excellent tactics, near flawless crew work, but also with sheer dogmatism, allowing them to score two 'come from behind' wins. As a result the Russian team came close to being unbeaten, only toppled in the final flight against Artemis Racing after a jammed halyard prevented them from hoisting their spinnaker on the final run.\n\nDespite scoring the most wins today, Bronenosec was the guilty party in a pre-start collision with Peninsula Petroleum Sailing Team during the first cross of the first race of their season for which they were docked two points.\n\nTomorrow will be the first of four days of fleet racing at the RC44 Bermuda Cup with a first warning signal scheduled for 1200 local time.

The first boat was completed in time for the 2015 RYA Suzuki Dinghy Show and eleven new boats were on the water by the time of the 2015 National Championship. As well as enjoying great class racing the new National 18s have been putting in some excellent results at multi-class events, including great results in the GJW Direct SailJuice Winter Series 2015/16.\n\nFor the 2016 season at least 17 of the new Morrison boats will be racing and the introduction of the updated mainsail and spinnaker for this season will further enhance an already very successful new design. The new mainsail incorporates a broad head and laminate materials with a full length top batten. The new spinnaker is increased in overall size by 25%, bringing it to 21 sq metres total, and in addition twin spinnaker pole systems will be allowed.\n\nThe National 18 will be on show again at the 2016 edition of the RYA Suzuki Dinghy show, which takes place on Saturday 5 and Sunday 6 March. The boat to be displayed on on stand B36 is a brand new build for Julian Berney of Blackwater Sailing Club, which will be formally named at the show at 14.30 on Saturday afternoon.\n\nwww.national18.com\n\nPorto Montenegro Opens World's Largest Superyacht Berth\n\nAdriatic marina Porto Montenegro has expanded its berthing options by adding the world's largest superyacht berth.\n\nCapable of mooring vessels measuring up to 250m, the gargantuan berth is even larger than the world's largest superyacht Azzam, which is 180m from prow to transom.\n\nHowever, with several 200m+ superyacht concepts released over the past few years, Porto Montenegro is anticipating future demand for mooring even larger vessels.\n\nThe new berth dwarfs other Mediterranean offerings, such as the 190m mooring at One Ocean Port Vell in Barcelona and the 135m berth at Grand Harbour Marina in Malta.\n\nwww.mby.com\n\nLetters To The Editor - editor@scuttlebutteurope.com\n\nLetters are limited to 350 words.

Where are the yellow air bags, the vertical tubular Avon bailers (tricky when bent), the wooden top masts. Now that was a proper dinghy. Taught you to stay upright, too, since a flip meant 20-minutes with a bucket. And no, we did have (sort of) Dacron sails, 'coz we woz down wif the kids, ya'see.\n\n* From David Evans: I was delighted to read today that the Oman Sailing Committee have withdrawn from hosting the 2016 Youth Sailing World Championships, which were due to take place in December 201. Obviously this was under pressure from ISAF/World Sailing, who at last have insisted their own rulebook must be obeyed, which states that organisers and organising countries must guarantee full and equal participation to all qualifying nations and their selected competitors.\n\nThis is a victory for both sportsmanship and fair play, we must congratulate World Sailing for recovering both their senses and moral compass!\n\nCan we but hope that World Sailing have had a full guarantee from the UAE in respect of the World Cup final to take place in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates during this October (2016).\n\nI still think we should all demand a formal apology from both ISAF/World Sailing and also personally from World Sailing's senior executives to the Israeli competitors, who were prevented from participating on an equal footing at the recent 2015 Youth Sailing World Championships in Malaysia. After all this is about people and not politics!\n\nDespite what the doubters suggested in January, it seems Championships can be organised rapidly and venues can be changed at short notice when there is sufficient egg on face!\n\nFeatured Brokerage\n\n2013 Botin 65. 3,500,000 USD. LOCATION\n\nOur latest central listing is the ultimate racer/cruiser and is considered by her crew to be a 65 foot \"super yacht\". Built impeccably by Knierim in Germany, she was first launched in June of 2013.\n\nHer owner invisioned a yacht with mini maxi performance, but with an interior that is second to none and all incorporated into a package that can be raced with only 10 to 12 crew. Her race results have proven that the Botin office hit the ball out of the park with this design, as her first distance race she shattered the ARC transatlantic record and then in shorter races such as the 2014 Sydney to Hobart, she was 7th to finish boat for boat, beating all her similar sized race boats boat for boat, which resulted her being third in class behind two canting keel and smaller race boats. We believe this boat represents an outstanding opportunity to step right on the perfect racer/cruiser.\n\nDetails\n\nContact\n\nPlease contact William Jenkins at 410-267-9419\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n2014 McConaghy Ker 46. 415,000 EUR.\n\nIntroducing the Ker 46, a light displacement, high performance racing yacht designed by leading IRC designers Ker Yacht Design.

Last on from the previous day were first on this morning, to give each of the groups the best chance of a varied set of conditions. Like clockwork, the breeze builds throughout the day, so now it was a chance for Group D to experience the lighter end of the wind spectrum. Sweden's Nicklas Dackhammar put the hammer down to win three heats and take second in the next, making him the clear winner of his group.\n\nFriday's schedule starts with some Pro-Am Racing in the morning, then it's Group A's turn to finish their racing, followed by the Play-Offs to determine which of the bottom eight teams can secure one of the four remaining spots in the match racing, and which four teams go home for an early bath.\n\nLive coverage will be shown at www.wmrt.com from 1400 local Western Australian time (CET+7hrs)\n\nwmrt.com\n\nTransatlantic Thriller To Cardiff\n\nCardiff has been chosen as the destination for the first Volvo Ocean Race transatlantic leg to the United Kingdom in 12 years, when the world's leading offshore race makes its debut visit to Wales in 2018.\n\nAt a press conference, Adolfo Rodríguez from the Volvo Ocean Race joined Welsh Government Minister for Economy, Science and Transport, Edwina Hart, and the City of Cardiff Council Leader, Cllr Phil Bale, to announce that Cardiff had been chosen as the transatlantic stopover, when the race will visit from May 25-June 10.\n\nSailors will leave Newport, Rhode Island, U.S., on May 20 and will cover approximately 2,900 nautical miles until they reach Cardiff.\n\nThe leg will start in Newport, which made a hugely successful debut as the race's only North American stopover in May 2015. It was reselected to host a stopover in the next edition from May 8, with the in-port race on May 19. -- Jon Bramley\n\nwww.volvooceanrace.com\n\nDecisive Final Act For 3rd Monaco Sportsboat Winter Series\n\nThe fifth Act of the Monaco Sportsboat Winter Series 2015/2016 looks set to be a close-run final in both the J/70 (4-6 March) and Melges 20 (18-20 March) classes of this international one-design series, organised by the Yacht Club de Monaco.\n\nHeld once a month from October to March, an initiative of Valentin Zavadnikov (Synergy), the regattas give amateurs and professionals an opportunity to make Monaco their winter training base.\n\nAfter four Acts and 17 races for the 65 entrants (seven nationalities) in the J/70s, British sailor Sam Carter (Brutus) leads the provisional ranking for the season. He is just ahead of Monegasques Stefano Roberti (Piccinina) and Jacopo Carrain (Carpe Diem), President of the J/70 Monaco Class Association, 2nd and 3rd respectively.\n\nRacing alongside them this weekend will be 15 Stars for Act 3 of their European Winter Series. In the Melges 20s, Russian Alexandr Ezhkov (Pirogovo) leads the fleet of 33 entrants (eight nationalities) after four Acts and 15 races, but last year's winner, Monegasque Guido Miani (Out of Reach) has yet to strike. For their final Act the Melges 20s will be joined by Smeralda 888s competing in their Spring Challenge.\n\nInternational umpires, GPS trackers and umpire courses run by World Sailing Race Committee members, who chose this Winter Series to trial jury on the water for fleet racing, are testimony to how the Club is benefiting from its new facilities to establish itself as a centre for training and racing in winter.\n\nwww.ycm.org\n\nEvent Series\n\nWorld Sailing Undertake Full Review Of The Sailing World Cup\n\nAt the February 2016 meeting of the World Sailing Executive Committee in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, it was agreed that a strategic review would be undertaken of the Sailing World Cup from 2017-2020 in order to ensure that the event series remains the best possible showcase for the sport on the journey to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nThe review will be concluded and proposals presented at the World Sailing mid-year meeting in Lausanne in May 2016.\n\nThe comprehensive review will include considering continental representation, calendar and venues, events, sailor quotas, ranking points, Para World Sailing and the role of known and future Olympic venues within the calendar. Sailors will continue to be placed at the heart of the Sailing World Cup, ensuring it is attractive to athletes, commercial partners and the media.\n\nIt was agreed that any existing World Sailing contracts with Sailing World Cup Organising Authorities for 2016 would be honoured.\n\nWorld Sailing Chief Executive, Andy Hunt, and World Sailing President, Carlo Croce, met with Abu Dhabi organisers at the end of February. Following the World Sailing Executive Committee decision in November 2015 to host the 2016 World Sailing Annual Conference in Europe rather than Abu Dhabi, the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority took the decision to withdraw their financial support of the 2016 Sailing World Cup Final and future editions of the event.\n\nWorld Sailing will seek a venue partner for the 2016 Sailing World Cup Final and contractual discussions are ongoing with an alternative venue. World Sailing expect to confirm dates for events in the final quarter of 2016 by the end of March.\n\nsailing.org\n\nSamui Regatta: Finale Of Asianyachting Grand Prix Championship\n\nBoat owners and sailors from across Asia and around the world have Samui Regatta 2016 firmly marked on their calendars as boats ranging in size from 23 to 72 feet are heading to Thailand's second largest island to compete in the 15th edition of the regatta to be held 21st to 28th May and hosted by Centara Grand Breach Resort Samui, on Chaweng Beach.\n\nEverybody loves a comeback story and the comeback class for 2016 is expected to be the Multihull Class. The number of multihulls are expanding in the region and playing a major role in the region's regattas, and a new edition this year is the six metre Pulse 600 design, produced by Corsair Marine in Vietnam. At the other end of the size range is a 67-foot catamaran that is expected to line-up this year, and many multihulls of varying sizes and designs in between.\n\nThe Notice of Race is online at samuiregatta.com/on-the-water/racedocs\n\nRYA and Royal Thames Yacht Club to Officially Launch 2016 National Sailing League\n\nIn October 2015, the RYA and Royal Thames Yacht Club (RTYC) ran a Sailing League Trial event at Queen Mary. Following a successful event the National Sailing Leagues are back for 2016 with regional qualifiers and a grand final on the 16-17 July 2016.\n\nThe National Sailing League is a new keelboat model that has been successively run in Germany over a number of years.

The 2015 Championships were won by Ben Saxton (Olympic GBR Nacra 17 hopeful) who had to compete against the likes of Stuart Bithell (2012 Silver medallist in the 470s), Nick Craig and Roger Gilbert (multiple Endeav"
