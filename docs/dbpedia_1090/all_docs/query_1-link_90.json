        "text": "Shawn Scott (185-G-1996, college: SW Christian) is a 28 year old 185cm guard that played his third professional season and first with BG Hagen averaging 30.1ppg, 9.0rpg, Assists-2 (5.9apg), Steals-5 (2.7spg), FGP: 59.9%, 3PT: 31.1%, FT: 78.0%. In 2022-2023 he split time with TVO Biggesee / TV Jahn Lindhorst (Germany-Regionalliga) averaging 31.2ppg, 10.4rpg, 6.1apg, 3.6spg, 2FGP: 56.2%, 3FGP: 30.4%, FT: 77.6%, in Jan.’23 moved to BG 2000 Berlin (Germany-Regionalliga) averaging 14.2ppg, 8.1rpg, 4.6apg, 2.4spg, FGP: 53.5%, 3PT: 14.3%, FT: 64.4%. He began his career at Jenks High School and then played 3 seasons at Southwestern Christian University. He spoke to eurobasket about the 2024 NBA finals.\n\nThanks Shawn for talking to eurobasket.com. Where are you at the moment and how is basketball life treating you?\n\nThanks for having me as always it’s a pleasure. I’m going back and forth between Frankfurt and Würzburg. Basketball life has been good I can’t complain. I have been playing a bunch of 3x3 which has been so much fun.\n\nAfter 3 years in the Regionalliga, you will be a Pro B player in 24-25. I won´t say what club it is since it isn´t official, but how good do you feel making a new step in your career?\n\nI’m grateful to be in the position I’m in going into next season playing in Pro B and just thankful for a team to have finally seen my potential and see that I can compete at this level. I’m determined to have a successful season as a team and will continue to silence all the critics that don’t believe. I continue to have a big chip on my shoulder and I’m ready for everything.\n\nWe have to talk basketball. The Boston Celtics finally won a title again since their last in 2008. How good is this for the NBA in general to have the Celtics back on the map?\n\nI mean they’ve always been in the conversation every year to be the potential team to win the finals and they finally got over the hump and finished it this time.\n\nBoston have had many critics the last years saying they didn´t have enough to win a title. Did this title surprise you a bit or did you see it coming?\n\nIt didn’t surprise me at all. I don’t know how people could say they didn’t have enough pieces. Along with their two stars, I think Boston had as good a role players and pieces that understood their roles, as any team. They destroyed the regular season so I think it was just a foreshadow to now.\n\nWhat was different this year? Was it just another year of experience for Tatum and Brown?\n\nDefinitely another year of experience and just the season going exactly how they wanted it to as far as who they had to face and things like that. I believed this one was a fairly easy one to win for them.\n\nWhat was your prediction going into the finals? Did you have Dallas or Boston winning it all?\n\nI wanted Dallas to win for sure but I knew it was going to be super tough for them.\n\nBoth teams had 2 superstars a piece. If you had to rate the 2 against each other, which team would have the better complete package? Wouldn´t Dallas have the edge?\n\nI would say Boston has the better complete package with offense and defense. Jaylon Brown really broke out this year and really showed that he can dominate on the offensive and defensive end and then you have Tatum who has already established himself in this league. Luka and Kyrie had the better offensive package but they were never known for their defense and that’s where the difference is to me.\n\nBoston had the better supporting cast, but seriously would the Boston Celtics have won the title without Jrue Holiday?\n\nI think Jrue Holiday just made it almost impossible for them to lose this finals. He continues to be an underrated point guard in the league and doesn’t get enough credit for being a legit two-way guard. I admire his defense and just the way he plays.\n\nDoes this title run make him a top 5 point guard?\n\nTop 5, no, but Jrue holiday does literally everything that wins games but maybe doesn’t show up on the stat sheet.\n\nWhat is your perception of Luka Doncic not playing defense? Is it fair for his teammates that he plays so much and has to do so much offensively that he can take plays off on defense?\n\nI mean if Luka had won the finals, no one would have criticized his defense like they did. I’m sure everyone already noticed that he doesn’t play the best defense but it was always overshadowed because of his spectacular offense. But it’s all about effort in my opinion. Everyone knows the saying:“defense wins championships”.\n\nIf you had to pick an unsung hero of the Boston Celtics who would it be? Would Derrick White be a good candidate?\n\nDerrick White 100%. He’s established himself on that team as much more than a role player and has been trusted to make big plays and not to mention he’s also Jrue Holiday-like on defense.\n\nIs Jayson Tatum a top 5 NBA player now with this title?\n\nNot quite top 5 but top 10 yes.\n\nCould the Boston Celtics be a dynasty in the making? If you could add one piece who would it be?\n\nI think they’ve always been a dynasty but now they’ve proven they can win the title and if they keep the same team, then I don’t know how they won’t be in the conversation every year.\n\nThanks Shawn for the chat\n\nThe Wizards and Trail Blazers have agreed to a trade that will send forward Deni Avdija (6'9''-F-2001) to Portland, reports Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. In exchange for Avdija, Washington will receive guard Malcolm Brogdon (6'5''-SG-1992, college: Virginia), the No. 14 pick in Wednesday night’s draft, a 2029 first-round pick, and two second-rounders, according to Wojnarowski. The 2029 pick will be the second-most favorable of the three first-rounders Portland controls, per Wojnarowski. Besides their own pick, the Blazers hold the Celtics’ and Bucks’ first-rounders in ’29. The two second-rounders will be 2028 and 2030 picks, tweets Josh Robbins of The Athletic. The ’28 pick will have to be the least favorable of the Wizards’ and Lakers’ second-rounders; the details on the ’30 second-round pick aren’t yet known (Washington controls Phoenix’s second-rounder in addition to its own).\n\nAvdija, who was selected ninth overall in the 2020 draft, has spent his first four NBA seasons in Washington and enjoyed a breakout year in 2023/24. In 75 games (all starts), he established new career highs in points (14.7), rebounds (7.2), and assists (3.8) per contest, as well as FG% (.506) and 3PT% (.374). The performance earned him a sixth-place finish in the Most Improved Player vote. The 23-year-old is also on a very team-friendly contract for the next several seasons. He signed a four-year, $55MM rookie scale extension last offseason that will go into effect in July and will run through the 2027/28 season. It has a declining structure, starting at about $15.6MM and dipping to $11.9MM by year four. While it’s a little surprising to see the retooling Trail Blazers as an aggressive buyer on the trade market, Avdija’s age and contract make him an ideal long-term fit in Portland. The deal will also create some financial flexibility for the Blazers, who projected to be over the first tax apron in 2024/25. As cap expert Yossi Gozlan tweets, moving off of Brogdon’s expiring $22.5MM salary and the No. 14 pick (which had a cap hold of about $4.5MM) will move team salary out of luxury tax territory.\n\nBrogdon has appeared in more than 56 games just once in the past five seasons due to injuries and only played 39 times in 2023/24. However, he remains effective when he’s available, averaging 15.7 PPG, 5.5 APG, and 3.8 RPG in 28.7 MPG with a.440/.412/.819 shooting line in his first and only season as a Blazer. The 31-year-old won the Sixth Man of the Year award with Boston in 2023 but was sent to Portland in the Jrue Holiday trade last fall. Still, it’s safe to assume that the draft pick were the primary motivator for the rebuilding Wizards, who were rumored for much of the spring to be eyeing a third first-round pick. While Avdija would have fit Washington’s timeline too, he was part of the roster that the current front office – led by team president Michael Winger and general manager Will Dawkins – inherited, so it seems they weren’t especially attached to him. Winger and Dawkins have reportedly made it a priority to build the new-look Wizards’ roster through the draft. It’s unclear if the Wizards will keep Brogdon for the 2024/25 season or look to flip him to a new team. The veteran would make a logical trade chip, given his expiring contract and his age, and sources indeed tell Michael Scotto of HoopsHype that he’ll be a candidate to be traded again. But Brogdon could also provide depth and veteran leadership in Washington’s backcourt if the team loses point guard Tyus Jones in free agency. Due to the poison pill provision, the trade can’t be completed until July, notes ESPN’s Bobby Marks. That means the Blazers will make their pick at No. 14 tonight on behalf of the Wizards.\n\nCourtesy of: hoopsrumors.com\n\nDillon Hargrove , who coached National Park College to a national championship in March, has been named the new coach of McCook Community College men’s basketball program. Hargrove has been the men’s head basketball coach at the National Junior College Athletic Association Division II program in Hot Springs, Ark. since July of 2020. He compiled an 82-27 coaching record while leading the Nighthawks to Region II regular season championships the past two years and a program best 31-1 record during the 2023-24 campaign. He said there were two main things that attracted him to the McCook job. “The Peter and Dolores Graff Events Center is top-notch. It is one of the best facilities in junior college,” he said. “The other thing is that when I got to McCook, one of the first things I realized and felt is that strong sense of community.” He said that community pride was visible not only with athletics, and not just on campus but throughout the community. “As a basketball coach that’s huge,” he said. “To make that move, you want to feel that sense of community and family and this is pretty obvious here in McCook.” During his fourth season, the Nighthawks rattled off 27 straight wins as the team spent seven weeks ranked No. 1 in the nation. Following the team’s lone loss in the NJCAA Region II Championship, NPC received an at-large bid to its first NJCAA National Tournament as the No. 5 seed, where the Nighthawks soared to the program’s first NJCAA Division II Men’s Basketball National Championship. NPC averaged 91.1 points per game on the offensive side while giving up 74.0 points per game on defense. They complimented that with 5.6 blocks per game (seventh in the nation) and 11.8 steals per game (eighth in the nation). In addition to being named NJCAA Region II Coach of the Year, Hargrove was named the 2023-24 NJCAA Division II Men’s Basketball Championship Coach of the Tournament and the 2023-24 National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) Two-Year College Coach of the Year. In his time at NPC, Hargrove coached one championship MVP, three DII All-Americans, two Region II players of the year, six all-region players and five second-team all-region players. MCC Athletic Director Jon Olsen said the last two times the men’s basketball head coach has opened up, there have been between 50 to 80 applications. A seven-person Mid-Plains Community College search committee screened candidates and conducted the interviews. Hargrove will also have responsibilities as a Career Coach in the Learning Commons. “His resume to me just stood out, he interviewed really well and we saw why he would be so successful,” said Olsen. “I’m really excited for him to be here.” Hargrove said recruiting is one of his immediate priorities. He and assistant Drake Henderson, whom he brought with him from Arkansas, plan to meet with current players and begin the process of replacing nine sophomores. “We like to develop teams that play really hard, and we’ll expect that out of our team this year, good athletes as well as good people,” he said. He received his bachelor’s degree in communications from Arkansas Tech University in August of 2016. Hargrove began his coaching career as an assistant with men’s basketball program at Lyon College in Benton, Ark. in 2016. The following year he coached at Flippin High School before joining the staff in 2019 at Little Priest Tribal College in Winnebago, Neb. MCC’s new men’s basketball coach comes from a family of basketball coaches and educators. His dad has been coaching in Arkansas and Missouri for 32 years and mom has been an educator. His twin sister is a basketball coach. Younger sister isn’t a coach but is pursuing her master’s degree in sports management. He and his wife Brooke both come from small towns in Arkansas and met in high school seven years ago. They were married last summer. She is a certified speech pathologist. Hargrove takes over for North Platte native Jacob Brandl, who left MCC last month to take over at his alma mater North Platte Community College. Brandl spent four years as MCC with a 47-72 record. In 2021 Brandl helped guide the Indians to a Region IX tournament championship appearance, their first since 1997. The Indians went 11-21 this past season.\n\nCourtesy of: mccindians.com\n\nDespite having one foot in the final of the Kenya National Basketball Men’s Premier League, Nairobi City Thunder head coach Brad Ibs has admitted that it was not easy going past Equity Dumas in the semi-final playoff. Thunder, who are unbeaten this season, are closing in on the finals after a 2-0 win in the semi-final playoffs being played in best-of-five series at the Nyayo Gymnasium. Thunder won Game Two 69-66 on Sunday night, two days after winning the closely contested Game One 79-77 against the Bankers. “I don’t know what it is about these guys because it’s never easy playing against them. We are just grateful for any win that we get. The real winners of this series are the Kenyan basketball fans, it has been a show every single game, drama until the end,” Ibs said. Ibs understands it is not over until it is over with three games to go in the series, which are lined up for next weekend starting Friday. “We are going to keep on working and be ready for Friday's match. Our opponents are so energetic, they are very competitive. We want to make sure once we get a lead, we maintain it,” added the Thunder coach. On his part, Equity Dumas head coach Carrey Odhiambo was not impressed by his boys’ character in their last match, especially towards the end of the game which he believes cost them the win. “Our discipline towards the end of the game was very wanting, we started playing surface basketball instead of playing team basketball to the end which could have made our work easy. We don’t know how to play together to the end, and it’s something we need to get over,” noted Odhiambo. “Our focus is now on Game Three on Friday which we need to win for us to start thinking about Game Four and Five,” he added. In the Sunday night game, City Thunder started off badly losing the first quarter 13-19, before coming back strong in the second quarter to win 21-08 and led 34-27 at the break. After the break, Equity Dumas tried a comeback with an impressive win of 28-23 in the third quarter and reduced the gap to two points, as the score line read 57-55 in favour of Thunder. Thunder then finished with a narrow win of 12-11 in the fourth quarter as the game ended 69-66 at the final buzzer.\n\nOther teams that are closing in on the finals are both men and women’s KPA teams, which won 2-0 each in the series in Nairobi, with the remaining games scheduled to take place in Mombasa next weekend. The Dockers only need one win to reach the final. Zetech Sparks and Equity Hawks are tied 1-1 in the series, with a showdown expected next weekend as each side seeks to win two of their remaining three games.\n\nCourtesy of: citizen.digital\n\nOttawa University Director of Athletics, Janet Eaton-Smith, is pleased to announce the hiring of Matthew Cross as the head men’s basketball coach. Cross comes to Ottawa University from NAIA Texas College in Tyler, Texas. He has guided four separate programs to national tournament appearances: Texas College, Talladega College, LSU-Shreveport, and Lamar State College. “I’m ecstatic to have Coach Cross join our staff,” said Eaton-Smith. “Matt is a proven winner in men’s basketball and is well respected by his peers. He brings a “can do” attitude to the department and will immediately elevate the program. Matt’s knowledge of the game will help grow the basketball IQ of our student-athletes. The future is looking bright for the men’s basketball program, and I can’t wait for the season to start in October.” Cross was the head men’s basketball coach and Athletics Coordinator at Texas College from 2021 to 2024. It was Cross’ second stint with the program. He was the head men’s basketball coach at TC from 2006-2008. In 2023-24, the Steers broke the program record for wins with 22, qualified for the program’s first trip to the NAIA National Tournament, and defeated three NAIA Top 25 teams. In his four years at Texas College, Cross was a Red River Athletic Conference (RRAC) Coach of the Year selection and was named Athletic Department Coach of the Year (2008, 2024). He was given the President’s Service Award by Texas College in May of 2024. “I want to give a special thanks to Director of Athletics Janet Eaton-Smith for her belief in me to lead the Ottawa University men’s basketball program to national prominence,” said Cross. “I also want to thank the entire OUKS family for their support and for welcoming me to Ottawa! As I visited with Coach Eaton-Smith, she acknowledged the tremendous opportunity at Ottawa University to attract and retain top players and compete for championships. Her strategic vision for the OUKS athletics department parallels the motto I have led with since day one, “Winning Championships, Graduating Champions, Making History.” I have always been someone with the ambition to coach at the highest level and driven to win an NAIA National Championship. I’m convinced we can do something special at Ottawa, The KCAC is the premier men’s basketball conference in the NAIA, and it just got a little bit better today!” Before working at Texas College, Cross was head coach of the women’s basketball program at LSU-Shreveport in Shreveport, La., the city where he was born and raised. In 2017-18, he led the Pilots to a school record 31 wins and the best record by any sports program (31-2) in LSU-Shreveport history. His team climbed to as high as no. 10 in the NAIA Women’s Basketball Coaches Top 25 Poll, which was its highest ranking in program history. Cross led the Pilots to an RRAC regular season and tournament championship. They also set the program record for consecutive wins with 19. He was named RRAC Coach of the Year, Louisiana Association Basketball Coaches Small College Coach of the Year, and finished second in the voting by the Louisiana Sports Writers’ Association Collegiate Coach of the Year committee. Prior to his time at LSU-Shreveport, Cross spent five years (2012-17) at Talladega College. It was his second stint at TC. Cross was the Athletic Director and head men’s basketball coach for one year in 2008-09 where he started the program from scratch. Cross and the Tornadoes became the first start-up program and youngest head coach to win a national championship with their 2008-09 USCAA Small College National Championship. Talladega defeated five NCAA Division I programs and received a ranking of no. 1 in the NAIA. In his final five years at Talladega College, Cross was a three-time Athletic Department Coach of the Year, a three-time Gulf Coast Athletic Conference (GCAC) Coach of the Year selection, was named the 2015 HBCU National Coach of the Year and was the winningest coach in program history with 177 wins. TC had three straight NAIA National Tournament opening-round victories: Evangel University (2014), Rocky Mountain College (2015), and Westmont College (2016). Cross led the Tornadoes to seven championships, three consecutive GCAC regular season championships, and back-to-back GCAC Tournament championships. The Tornadoes had two NAIA Round of 16 appearances, an NAIA Fab Four appearance, and a 2015 HBCU National Championship. TC was ranked no. 1 in the NAIA for four weeks during the 2014-15 season and had the third longest appearances in the NAIA Men’s Basketball Coaches Top 25 Poll from 2014 to 2017. Talladega was the first HBCU since Hampton University in 1982 to make an appearance in the NAIA Fab 4 and the first HBCU to earn a ranking of no. 1 since Texas Southern University in 1977. From 2009 to 2012, Cross was the head coach of the men’s basketball program at Lamar State College in Port Arthur, Texas. He led the Seahawks to a record of 70-30, a ranking of no. 7 in the NJCAA, a 2011 NJCAA National Tournament appearance, and a trip to the round of 16 at the national tournament. Under his leadership, the Seahawks captured the program’s first Region XIV Championship in 2010-11 and the program’s first Texas Eastern Conference championship in 2011-12. LSC set a school record for wins with 26 in 2011 and Cross was named NJCAA District 14 Coach of the Year. In 2010-11, Lamar State defeated no. 9 Trinity Valley College in the quarterfinals of the Region XIV Tournament and no. 2 San Jacinto College in the championship game. At the NJCAA National Tournament, the Seahawks continued to be a giant killer. Lamar knocked off no. 1, Missouri State University – West Plains in Hutchinson, earning the program’s first national tournament victory. Cross has a collegiate coaching record of 345-171, a total of nine 20-win seasons, nine national tournament appearances, has led four different programs to a national tournament, has two 30-win seasons, and earned two national coach of the year honors. He has coached 51 all-conference performers and eight All-Americans. He is an advocate for the work of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and a member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA), the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), and the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches (TABC). Cross earned his degree in physical education with a minor in history from the University of Arkansas Monticello in 2005.\n\nCourtesy of: ottawabraves.com\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks took forward Zaccharie Risacher (6'8''-F-2005) with the first pick in the 2024 NBA draft, marking the second straight year that the draft has had a decidedly French flavor. Risacher, the first of four French players taken in the first round, follows in the footsteps of countryman Victor Wembanyama, who went No. 1 to the San Antonio Spurs last year. Risacher is the fourth overall international prospect to be taken with the NBA's top pick, joining Italian big man Andrea Bargnani (2006, Toronto Raptors) and Hall of Fame center Yao Ming (2002, Houston Rockets). \"It's a blessing, you know,\" Risacher said. \"So exciting. There's a lot of feelings and emotions right now. I don't know what to say, but it's definitely special. I'm so blessed.\" Risacher, 19, played this past season for JL Bourg in France's LNB Elite league and averaged 11.1 points and 4.0 rebounds across competition in both the EuroCup and the French league. He is the son of longtime French professional basketball player Stephane Risacher, who won a silver medal with the French national team at the Olympic Games in 2000. \"I'm real excited about what's going to happen,\" Zaccharie Risacher said. \"I just want to do my best to help the team. I just feel like I can help a lot. I'm ready to do whatever it takes to be able to get on the court with those great players.\" The 6-foot-9 forward separated himself throughout the draft process, and Atlanta which jumped from the 11th spot in last month's NBA draft lottery to the top spot used its first No. 1 pick in the lottery era on him. Now, Risacher will go into a frontcourt alongside breakout forward Jalen Johnson with the Hawks, who enter the offseason with plenty of questions surrounding the future of their star-laden backcourt of Trae Young and Dejounte Murray. The Hawks also will look to improve on the defensive end, where they struggled last season in defensive efficiency (27th overall), defense vs. on-ball screens (24th), transition defense (29th) and field goal percentage allowed vs. layups and dunks (26th).\n\nFellow Frenchman Alexandre Sarr (7'0''-PF-2005), also 19, was taken at No. 2 by the Washington Wizards, while Kentucky guard Reed Sheppard (6'3''-G-2004) went to the Rockets at No. 3. Another French player Tidjane Salaun went to the Charlotte Hornets at No. 6. Late in the first round, a fourth French prospect went off the board as the New York Knicks took guard Pacome Dadiet with the 25th selection. \"That's amazing,\" Risacher said. \"We are trying to represent our country, and I'm so glad to be a part of it. There is more players coming in. I'm really proud of being a part of the success of my country.\" Added Sarr: \"It just shows the amount of talent that we have in France. I'm really excited for Zacc. I think our national team is really going to be good.\" During his introductory remarks, NBA commissioner Adam Silver congratulated the Boston Celtics on winning the 2024 NBA title drawing boos from the several thousand fans assembled here and commented on how the Celtics built their team through drafting each of Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum at No. 3 in the 2016 and 2017 drafts. Silver's comments came with an ironic twist, as the draft was being held at Brooklyn's Barclays Center home of the Nets, the team that sent the Celtics the picks that became Brown and Tatum as part of the trade that brought Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett here in 2013. Unlike last year's draft, with Wembanyama the obvious selection all the way through, it was a much more muddled process this year, with Risacher, Sarr, Sheppard and UConncenter Donovan Clingan (7'2''-C-2004) all discussed as possible options before Atlanta landed on Risacher with the top selection. After the Hawks took Risacher, Washington selected Sarr, a versatile 7-foot forward who has drawn some comparisons to longtime NBA star Al Horford, with the second pick, as had been widely expected, setting the stage for the first true dramatic moment when the Rockets went on the clock.\n\nHouston, which had the third pick because it acquired it from the Nets in the James Harden trade in 2021, took Sheppard the sharpshooter who hit 52% of his 3s with the Wildcats adding to a burgeoning young talent base with the Rockets that includes guard Amen Thompson, forward Jabari Smith Jr. and center Alperen Sengun. \"It was unbelievable... a dream come true,\" Sheppard said. \"... They have a really good thing going in Houston. The coach [Ime Udoka] is really good. They have a bunch of really young, athletic guys, and we'll be able to play fast. It's going to be fun.\" Sheppard, who is listed at 6-foot-2, is the fifth player that height or shorter to be picked in the top three of the NBA draft in the past 30 years, according to ESPN Stats & Information. He also is the third Kentucky guard to be taken in the top five of an NBA draft, joining John Wall (2010) and De'Aaron Fox (2017).\n\nThat meant another Texas team, the Spurs, was on the clock with the fourth pick its first of two, along with the eighth pick, in this year's lottery. The Spurs drew a huge cheer from the crowd in Brooklyn by taking Stephon Castle (6'6''-G-2004), a guard from two-time defending national champion UConn. \"I was just playing for the best coach in college basketball and now flipping to the NBA and going to play for a legendary coach like Coach Pop, it's a blessing,\" Castle said.\n\nWith the fifth pick, the Detroit Pistons had been another team with some intrigue, as several teams were potentially looking to trade up to draft Donovan Clingan, the top defensive player in this draft. Ultimately, however, the Pistons stood pat and drafted Ronald Holland II (6'9''-F-2005), a 6-foot-7 forward who spent this past season with the G League Ignite.\n\nThe Hornets then continued the French connection at the top of this draft by taking Salaun, a long, rangy, 6-foot-9 forward who spent the past season playing for Cholet Basket in France. \"I think the basketball in France has improved, and that's why we are here in this draft,\" Salaun said. \"Three French players in the top 10, it's not nothing.\"\n\nThat left Donovan Clingan on the board for the Portland Trail Blazers, who had been hoping to land the center with the seventh pick, and they were able to get him there. Drafting Donovan Clingan also opened up more questions about the future of other members of the Trail Blazers, including centers Deandre Ayton and Robert Williams, as Portland continues to retool its roster after trading the 14th pick earlier in the evening as part of a deal with the Wizards for forward Deni Avdija.\n\nThat was followed by the Minnesota Timberwolves, fresh off making the Western Conference finals, trading a 2031 first-round pick and a 2030 first-round pick swap to the Spurs for the rights to the eighth pick in the draft a pick Minnesota used to grab big-time scoring guard Rob Dillingham out of Kentucky.\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies, having missed out on moving up to get Donovan Clingan, then grabbed Purdue center Zach Edey (7'4''-C-2002) the 7-foot-4 national player of the year with the ninth selection. The Utah Jazz then picked Cody Williams (6'8''-F-2004) the younger brother of Oklahoma City Thunder forward Jalen Williams with the 10th selection.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls then took forward Matas Buzelis, a Windy City native who played for G League Ignite, with the 11th pick, before Oklahoma City drafted Serbian point guard Nikola Topic (6'6''-PG-2005), who has a partially torn ACL and could miss the entire season, with the 12th selection.\n\nSacramento then took Providence guard Devin Carter (6'3''-G-2002) the son of longtime NBA guard Anthony Carter with the 13th pick.\n\nThe Wizards (though the pick was officially made by Portland) rounded out the lottery by taking Carlton \"Bub\" Carrington, a 6-foot-4 guard out of Pittsburgh, with the 14th selection.\n\nLater in the first round, the Denver Nuggetstraded up from the 28th pick to the 22nd overall selection with the Phoenix Suns to take Dayton big man DaRon Holmes II (6'10''-F-2002). To do so, the Nuggets traded not only the 28th pick, but also the 56th pick and second-round picks in 2026 and 2031, as Phoenix added to its severely depleted pool of draft picks.\n\nThe Knicks, who entered the night with the 24th and 25th picks in this year's draft, traded the 24th pick to Washington for the 26th and 51st selections, with Washington using its third first-rounder of the night to grab Miami forward Kyshawn George (5'11''-PG-2003).\n\nNew York then grabbed Dadiet with the 25th pick, before trading the 26th pick to the Thunder, who used it to take Weber State forward Dillon Jones (6'6''-F). In exchange, the Knicks acquired five second-round picks from Oklahoma City.\n\nThe second round of the draft will be held Thursday at ESPN's Seaport District studios (4 p.m. ET, ESPN).\n\nCourtesy of: espn.com\n\nThe Wizards and Trail Blazers have agreed to a trade that will send forward Deni Avdija (6'9''-F-2001) to Portland, reports Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. In exchange for Avdija, Washington will receive guard Malcolm Brogdon (6'5''-SG-1992, college: Virginia), the No. 14 pick in Wednesday night’s draft, a 2029 first-round pick, and two second-rounders, according to Wojnarowski. The 2029 pick will be the second-most favorable of the three first-rounders Portland controls, per Wojnarowski. Besides their own pick, the Blazers hold the Celtics’ and Bucks’ first-rounders in ’29. The two second-rounders will be 2028 and 2030 picks, tweets Josh Robbins of The Athletic. The ’28 pick will have to be the least favorable of the Wizards’ and Lakers’ second-rounders; the details on the ’30 second-round pick aren’t yet known (Washington controls Phoenix’s second-rounder in addition to its own).\n\nAvdija, who was selected ninth overall in the 2020 draft, has spent his first four NBA seasons in Washington and enjoyed a breakout year in 2023/24. In 75 games (all starts), he established new career highs in points (14.7), rebounds (7.2), and assists (3.8) per contest, as well as FG% (.506) and 3PT% (.374). The performance earned him a sixth-place finish in the Most Improved Player vote. The 23-year-old is also on a very team-friendly contract for the next several seasons. He signed a four-year, $55MM rookie scale extension last offseason that will go into effect in July and will run through the 2027/28 season. It has a declining structure, starting at about $15.6MM and dipping to $11.9MM by year four. While it’s a little surprising to see the retooling Trail Blazers as an aggressive buyer on the trade market, Avdija’s age and contract make him an ideal long-term fit in Portland. The deal will also create some financial flexibility for the Blazers, who projected to be over the first tax apron in 2024/25. As cap expert Yossi Gozlan tweets, moving off of Brogdon’s expiring $22.5MM salary and the No. 14 pick (which had a cap hold of about $4.5MM) will move team salary out of luxury tax territory.\n\nBrogdon has appeared in more than 56 games just once in the past five seasons due to injuries and only played 39 times in 2023/24. However, he remains effective when he’s available, averaging 15.7 PPG, 5.5 APG, and 3.8 RPG in 28.7 MPG with a.440/.412/.819 shooting line in his first and only season as a Blazer. The 31-year-old won the Sixth Man of the Year award with Boston in 2023 but was sent to Portland in the Jrue Holiday trade last fall. Still, it’s safe to assume that the draft pick were the primary motivator for the rebuilding Wizards, who were rumored for much of the spring to be eyeing a third first-round pick. While Avdija would have fit Washington’s timeline too, he was part of the roster that the current front office – led by team president Michael Winger and general manager Will Dawkins – inherited, so it seems they weren’t especially attached to him. Winger and Dawkins have reportedly made it a priority to build the new-look Wizards’ roster through the draft. It’s unclear if the Wizards will keep Brogdon for the 2024/25 season or look to flip him to a new team. The veteran would make a logical trade chip, given his expiring contract and his age, and sources indeed tell Michael Scotto of HoopsHype that he’ll be a candidate to be traded again. But Brogdon could also provide depth and veteran leadership in Washington’s backcourt if the team loses point guard Tyus Jones in free agency. Due to the poison pill provision, the trade can’t be completed until July, notes ESPN’s Bobby Marks. That means the Blazers will make their pick at No. 14 tonight on behalf of the Wizards.\n\nCourtesy of: hoopsrumors.com\n\nJared Sullinger\n\nAmerican Center Jared Sullinger (206-C-1992) had a great game in the last week for Cangrejeros de Santurce, receiving a Hoops Agents Player of the Week award for week 29.\n\nThe 31-year old player had a double-double of 22 points and 15 rebounds, while his team crushed Carolina (#3, 17-14) with 16-point margin 97-81. Cangrejeros is placed at 4th position in Puerto Rican BSN. Santurce is a typical solid league team placed somewhere in the middle or a little bit lower in the standings. They need more victories to improve their 16-14 record. In the team's last game Sullinger had a remarkable 69.2% from 2-point range. He just recently signed at Cangrejeros, being already a very valuable addition to the team. Former Ohio State University star has very solid stats this year. Sullinger is in league's top in points (4th best: 20.4ppg) and averages impressive 1.1bpg and 59.1% FGP.\n\nThe second best player in last week's games was another Santurce's star - young American forward Angel Matias (194-F-1992). Matias had a very good evening with 30 points, 2 rebounds and 7 assists. Of course together with Sullinger he helped Cangrejeros de Santurce with another comfortable win 97-81 over slightly higher-ranked Carolina (#3, 17-14) being unquestionably team leader. It was definitely game of the week between two contenders to the top position in Group B. Cangrejeros consolidated its place in top 4 of the standings. His team's 16-14 record is not bad at all. Matias is one of the most experienced players at Cangrejeros and similarly like Jared Sullinger has a reputation of one of team's most reliable players.\n\nThird on the list of top players last week was American guard Norris Cole (188-PG-1988) of Osos de Manati (#5). Cole scored 22 points and passed 11 assists (!!!). He was a key player of Osos, leading his team to a 100-88 win against slightly lower-ranked San German (#6, 12-19). Manati needs these victories very badly if they think about getting closer to top teams in Group B. Their record at this point is 16 victories and 16 lost games. Cole has a great season in Puerto Rico. After 22 games, he made it on the list of the league's leaders in assists with 7.3apg (3rd best). He also has a FGP of 57.3% and 3PT: 41.4%.\n\nOther top performing players last week:\n\n4. Akil Mitchell (206-C-1992) of Caguas - 14 points and 20 rebounds\n\n5.

Wilfredo Rodriguez (198-PF-1994) of Arecibo - 17 points, 9 rebounds and 2 assists\n\nThe Player of the week is selected based on efficiency calculation, but also including game result, importance of the game, if played recorded double-double/triple-double, etc.\n\nThe efficiency formula is a combination of various formulas used by different basketball organizations/leagues. We got involved many basketball scouts and journalists to assure it's accuracy.\n\nThe formula: 1.5*PTS + 3*(REB+AST+ST+BL-TO) - 2*BSAG - 4*PF + 3*PFRV + 4*(2FGPM+3FGPM) + 1.5*FTM - 3*(2FGPA-2FGPM) - 3*(3FGPA-3FGPM) - (FTA-FTM)\n\nExperienced Vusi Sibeko (G-1991) had an amazing evening in the last round for league's leader Mpumalanga Rhinos and that's him to receive a Hoops Agents Player of the Week award for round 1.\n\nThe 32-year old guard had a double-double of 13 points and 12 rebounds, while his team edged out MBB (#6, 0-1), the league's bottom-ranked team 58-55. It allowed Rhinos to consolidate first place in the South African BNL. But it's just the very beginning of the season and M.Rhinos won both games without losing any. It's too early to say anything as the standings can be changed completely after next round. In the team's last game Sibeko had a remarkable 55.6% from 2-point range. He has many years of experience at Rhinos, through which he has constantly improved. Sibeko has impressive league stats. He is in league's top in points (3rd best: 12.0ppg), rebounds (4th best: 10.0rpg), assists (9th best: 2.0apg) and averages solid 56.3% FGP.\n\nThe second most remarkable performance in last round's games was another M.Rhinos' star - Thabo Mafetho. Mafetho impressed basketball fans with 6 points and 24 rebounds. Of course together with Sibeko he helped Mpumalanga Rhinos with another comfortable win outscoring S.Panthers (0-1) 76-46. His team has extremely good start of the season. They won both games so far. However the season is at the beginning, so everything can happen. They still may lose their high position in the standings. Mafetho is one of the most experienced players at Rhinos and similarly like Vusi Sibeko has a reputation of one of team's most reliable players.\n\nThe third best performed player last round was another M.Rhinos' star - Kwazi Gumede (191-G/F-1997). Gumede scored 27 points. He was another key player of Mpumalanga Rhinos, helping his team with a 76-46 easy win against S.Panthers (#7, 0-1). Rhinos has a very good start of the season. But there were just 2 games played, so it's too early to judge them at this stage. Gumede also has a very good start of the season with very strong stats. Gumede has a great season in South Africa. After only 2 games, he made it on the list of the league's leaders in points with 17.0ppg (best scorer) and assists with 2.5apg (6th best).\n\nOther top performing players last week:\n\n4.

As we transition into the Big 12 Conference she has her program poised to attract the best student-athletes in recruiting and compete for championships and NCAA tournament berths.\"Roberts, the 2022-23 Pac-12 Coach of the Year, will enter her 10th season with the Utes in 2024-25, holding an overall record of 162-115. She has 383 career wins in 23 seasons as a head coach.\"I am incredibly grateful and humbled for the opportunity to continue coaching here at the University of Utah,\" Roberts said. \"My family and I love the Utah community and I can't imagine leading another program. Thank you to Mark Harlan and Charmelle Green for their trust and belief in what we're continuing to build in our women's basketball program. When I took this job nine years ago, my vision was to create a nationally relevant program, build an incredible home court advantage with the amazing fans of Salt Lake City, and take us to heights we had not achieved before. While we have achieved so much, the job is not finished. I'm as motivated as ever to continue climbing and cut down more nets. It's a great day to be a Ute!\" During the 2023-24 season, she led the Utes to a 23-win season, eclipsing the 20-win mark for the third year in a row. The Utes advanced to the NCAA Tournament and picked up their third consecutive opening-round victory, advancing to the second round for the most consecutive NCAA Tournament first-round wins in program history. Utah was the second highest-scoring team in the Pac-12 last season, averaging 77.7 points per game, which is the fourth-highest figure in school history and the highest since 2021-22. Utah also led the Pac-12 in three-pointers made per game (4th NCAA; school-record 348), assists per game (6th NCAA; 19.5) and field goal percentage (12th NCAA; 47.6%). Ten new Utes have joined the 1,000-point club during Roberts' tenure, including Alissa Pili who did it in just 48 games as a Ute and Megan Huff who did it in just two seasons. She also has watched five school records fall, including three consecutive team single-season three-point records, and has coached multiple athletes to top-10 all-time rankings in program and Pac-12 history. The Utes broke the school record for three-pointers made in 2018-19 (239), 2019-20 (253), 2021-22 (312) and 2023-24 (348).In her nine years in Salt Lake City, the Utes have appeared in the postseason six times and have had six seasons with 18 or more wins, including four 20-win seasons. The Utes won 27 games in 2022-23 and advanced to the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16, which marked the furthest advancement for Utah since 2006, and just the third Sweet 16 in school history. She led the Utes to two consecutive seasons being ranked in the AP Top 25 including the highest ranking in school history at No. 3 in 2022-23. The 2022-23 season was monumental in program history as Roberts was named the first Pac-12 Coach of the Year for Utah after she led Utah to a share of its first Pac-12 regular season title. The Utes finished that campaign with a record of 27-5, marking the second-most wins in a season in program history. Under the guidance of Roberts, Alissa Pili was named Pac-12 Player of the Year, the first player in Utah history to earn the honor. In 2021-22 Gianna Kneepkens was named Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, just the second time a Utah player has claimed the award. Roberts collected her 100th win at Utah on Jan. 14, 2021, with an 89-48 victory over UC Riverside. During her time at Utah, the Utes have had two All-Americans in Alissa Pili and Gianna Kneepkens, as well as, 28 All-Pac-12 selections and 30 Pac-12 All-Academic selections, as well as Utah's first player of the year award in 2019 after producing a Pac-12 Freshman of the Year. The Utes earned their second Pac-12 Freshman of the Year honor in 2022. Roberts will enter her 23rd season as a head coach in 2024-25. Prior to her nine seasons at Utah she spent nine seasons at Pacific and four years at Chico State. In her career, she has helped 47 total athletes to all-conference selections as a head coach. While at Pacific, she was a two-time conference coach of the year and led the Tigers to postseason appearances in each of her last four seasons. She rebuilt a program that had won just 11 games combined in the two seasons before she took over and ended her career there with 25 All-Big West selections. In her first stint as a head coach, Roberts took over the program at Chico State, where she compiled an 86-31 overall record, earning WBCA West Region Coach of the Year in 2004-05 after leading the Wildcats to the NCAA Division II Final Four.

It allowed Limpopo P. to consolidate first place in the South African WBNL. But it's just the very beginning of the season and Limpopo P. won both games without losing any. It's too early to say anything as the standings can be changed completely after next round. Mutungutungu has many years of experience at Limpopo P., through which she has constantly improved. Mutungutungu has impressive league stats. She is league's best scorer averaging so far 21.0ppg. Mutungutungu is in league's top in assists (4th best: 3.0apg) and averages solid 4.0spg.\n\nThe second most remarkable performance in last round's games was another Limpopo P.'s star - Zanele Vimbela. Vimbela impressed basketball fans with 8 points, 13 rebounds and 3 assists. Of course together with Mutungutungu she helped Limpopo Pride with another comfortable win outscoring Soweto P. (0-1) 66-30. Her team has extremely good start of the season. They won both games so far. However the season is at the beginning, so everything can happen. They still may lose their high position in the standings. Vimbela is one of the most experienced players at Limpopo P. and similarly like Lufuno Mutungutungu has a reputation of one of team's most reliable players. She belongs to the best scorers in the league with 9.0ppg (#4). She also registered 10.5 boards per game.\n\nThe third best performed player last round was another Limpopo P.'s star - Mahlatse Bosega. Bosega showcased her all-around game by recording 6 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists in the last round. She was another key player of Limpopo Pride, helping her team with a 66-30 easy win against Soweto P. (#5, 0-1). Limpopo P. has a very good start of the season. But there were just 2 games played, so it's too early to judge them at this stage. Bosega also has a very good start of the season with very strong stats. Bosega has a great season in South Africa. After only 2 games, she made it on the list of the league's leaders in rebounds with 7.5rpg (9th best) and assists with 4.0apg (2nd best).\n\nOther top performing players last week:\n\n4. Thando Mbuthuma) of Limpopo P. - 12 points, 8 rebounds and 2 assists\n\n5. Buyiswa Gwangwa (159-PG-1994) of WC Mountaineers - 16 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists\n\n6.

Chauness Goliath) of WC Mountaineers - 7 points, 4 rebounds and 3 assists\n\nThe Player of the week is selected based on efficiency calculation, but also including game result, importance of the game, if played recorded double-double/triple-double, etc.\n\nThe efficiency formula is a combination of various formulas used by different basketball organizations/leagues. We got involved many basketball scouts and journalists to assure it's accuracy.\n\nThe formula: 1.5*PTS + 3*(REB+AST+ST+BL-TO) - 2*BSAG - 4*PF + 3*PFRV + 4*(2FGPM+3FGPM) + 1.5*FTM - 3*(2FGPA-2FGPM) - 3*(3FGPA-3FGPM) - (FTA-FTM)\n\nHere is the last round review presented by LBM Management.\n\nThe most interesting game was a derby match between two local teams from Montevideo: D.Sporting (#3) and Yale (#2). Yale was defeated at home 57-72 and even the fact of playing on their own court did not help. It ended at the same time the seven-game winning streak of Yale. Great defensive blocking was one of the keys in this match when D.Sporting made 8 blocks. Forward Lucia Schiavo (174-1998) fired 16 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists for the winners. Argentinian guard Julieta Ale (176-1995) chipped in 11 points and 8 rebounds. D.Sporting's coach Fabian Boscardin used entire bench which allowed the starters a little rest for the next games. Argentinian Agustina Bazan (174-2003) produced 28 points and 9 rebounds for lost side. D.Sporting have a solid three-game winning streak. They moved-up to second place, which they share with defeated Yale.\n\nAnother interesting game was again a derby between two teams from Montevideo: Malvin (#1) and Lagomar (#8). Lagomar was smashed at home by 28 points 52-80 and even the advantage of their own court did not help. Worth to mention a great performance of Argentinian swingman Delfina Saravia (173-2003) who helped to win the game recording 20 points (on 7-of-8 shooting from the field). Carolina Fernandez contributed with 12 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists for the winners. Forward Carina Laborde (170-2004) replied with 17 points and 5 rebounds (made all of her seven free throws) for Lagomar. The winner was already known earlier in the game, so both coaches allowed to play the bench players saving starting five for next games. Undefeated Malvin (10-0) have an impressive ten-game winning streak. Defending champion maintains first position with a perfect record of 10 victories in a row. Lagomar lost third consecutive game. They dropped to the ninth place with seven games lost.\n\nBottom-ranked Hebraica (0-8) tried to put together a comeback for its first victory of the season, but they fell short in the 102-43 loss to ninth ranked Juventud (3-6) in Montevideo on Tuesday evening. Florencia Spinelli had a double-double by scoring 26 points and 12 rebounds to lead the charge for the winners. At the losing side Agostina Nogueira responded with 9 points, 18 rebounds and 4 blocks. Since the result was very predictable, it gave the chance for the coaches to test many bench players and allowed the starting five to rest. Juventud moved-up to eighth place. Hebraica at the other side still closes the standings with eight games lost.\n\nIn the last two games of round 10 25 de Agosto was defeated by Remeros in Mercedes 68-55. Tabare was smashed by Aguada at home 43-75.\n\nThe best stats of 10th round was 16 points, 10 rebounds, 8 assists and 5 blocks by Sabrina Molina of Juventud.\n\nRemeros - 25 de Agosto 68-55\n\nWe cannot really consider it an upset in the game between close teams in Mercedes where 6th ranked 25 de Agosto (4-6) was defeated by seventh ranked Remeros (4-5) 68-55 on Saturday. Remeros forced 21 25 de Agosto turnovers. Valeria Barrett (175-2000) scored 26 points and 9 rebounds to lead the charge for the winners and forward Julieta Laubert (-2008) chipped in 20 points and 5 rebounds during the contest.

Yale was defeated at home 57-72 and even the fact of playing on their own court did not help. It ended at the same time the seven-game winning streak of Yale. Great defensive blocking was one of the keys in this match when D.Sporting made 8 blocks. Forward Lucia Schiavo (174-1998) fired 16 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists for the winners. Argentinian guard Julieta Ale (176-1995) chipped in 11 points and 8 rebounds. Five D.Sporting players scored in double figures. D.Sporting's coach Fabian Boscardin used entire bench which allowed the starters a little rest for the next games. Argentinian Agustina Bazan (174-2003) produced 28 points and 9 rebounds and forward Lara Barbato (181-2004) added 10 points and 10 rebounds respectively for lost side. D.Sporting have a solid three-game winning streak. They moved-up to second place, which they share with defeated Yale.\n\nTop scorers:\n\nYale: A.Bazan 28+9reb+3ast, L.Barbato 10+10reb+2ast, J.Sienra 9+7reb+1ast, R.Dalesandro 8+1reb+2ast, F.Carretero 2+3reb, J.Correa 0+1reb\n\nD.Sporting: L.Schiavo 16+8reb+6ast, M.Rivera 15+6reb, K.Cordara 14+3reb, J.Ale 11+8reb+3ast, J.Zeballos 11+5reb+2ast, P.Sosa 3+1reb\n\ngschID: 1176419\n\nLagomar - Malvin 52-80\n\nAnother interesting game was again a derby between two teams from Montevideo: Malvin (#1) and Lagomar (#8). Lagomar was smashed at home by 28 points 52-80 and even the advantage of their own court did not help. Malvin held Lagomar to an opponent 24.7 percent shooting from the field compared to 38.2 percent accuracy of the winners and made 16-of-19 charity shots (84.2 percent) during the game. Malvin forced 29 Lagomar turnovers and outrebounded them 56-34 including a 41-25 advantage in defensive rebounds. Worth to mention a great performance of Argentinian swingman Delfina Saravia (173-2003) who helped to win the game recording 20 points (on 7-of-8 shooting from the field). Guard Carolina Fernandez (186-2003) contributed with 12 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists for the winners. Forward Carina Laborde (170-2004) replied with 17 points and 5 rebounds (made all of her seven free throws) and Argentinian guard Melina Marcial (168-1998) added 7 points, 6 rebounds and 7 assists in the effort for Lagomar. The winner was already known earlier in the game, so both coaches allowed to play the bench players saving starting five for next games. Malvin (10-0) have an impressive ten-game winning streak. Defending champion maintains first position with a perfect record of 10 victories in a row. Lagomar lost third consecutive game. They dropped to the ninth place with seven games lost.\n\nTop scorers:\n\nLagomar: C.Laborde 17+5reb+2ast, N.Quevedo 8+7reb+2ast, M.Marcial 7+6reb+7ast, L.Menendez 6+2reb, C.Panetta 5+3reb, S.Schiaffarino 5+6reb\n\nMalvin: D.Saravia 20+3reb+1ast, C.Fernandez 12+6reb+5ast, F.Mayola 8+4reb+1ast, S.Medrick 7+4reb+1ast, A.Monfermoso 7+2reb+1ast, C.Miculka 6+12reb+3ast\n\ngschID: 1176420\n\nTabare - Aguada 43-75\n\nNo shocking result in a game when fourth ranked Aguada (7-3) smashed on the road 10th ranked Tabare (1-9) 75-43 on Sunday. Aguada dominated down low during the game scoring 54 of its points in the paint compared to Tabare's 32. Aguada forced 29 Tabare turnovers and outrebounded them 57-28 including a 23-5 advantage in offensive rebounds. Sofia Herrera (179-2005) had a double-double by scoring 12 points, 17 rebounds and 4 assists to lead the charge for the winners and forward Evangelina Rolon (181-2005) chipped in 19 points and 11 rebounds during the contest. At the losing side Chilean Catalina Rodriguez (-2002) responded with 7 points and point guard Catalina Tano (174-2003) scored 6 points and 4 assists. Since the result was very predictable, it gave the chance for the coaches to test many bench players and allowed the starting five to rest. Aguada maintains fourth position with 7-3 record. Tabare lost sixth consecutive game. Newly promoted team keeps the tenth place with nine games lost.\n\nTop scorers:\n\nTabare: R.Perez 8+1reb+1ast, C.Rodriguez 7+4reb+1ast, C.Tano 6+1reb+4ast, M.Talamas 5+5reb+1ast, C.Dos Santos 5+3reb+1ast, A.Canedo 4+1reb\n\nAguada: E.Rolon 19+11reb+1ast, C.Pereira 13+5reb+4ast, S.Herrera 12+17reb+4ast, N.Dolinsky 9+1reb+1ast, D.Tovagliari 6+2reb, D.Nunez 6+2reb+1ast\n\ngschID: 1176421\n\nHebraica - Juventud 43-102\n\nBottom-ranked Hebraica (0-8) tried to put together a comeback for its first victory of the season, but they fell short in the 102-43 loss to ninth ranked Juventud (3-6) in Montevideo on Tuesday evening. They held Hebraica to an opponent 21.9 percent shooting from the field compared to 41.8 percent accuracy of the winners. Juventud forced 34 Hebraica turnovers and outrebounded them 64-49 including 30 on the offensive glass. Juventud looked well-organized offensively handing out 27 assists comparing to just 7 passes made by Hebraica's players. Great defensive blocking was one of the keys in this match when Juventud made 9 blocks. Center Florencia Spinelli (186-1994) had a double-double by scoring 26 points and 12 rebounds to lead the charge for the winners and Paraguayan guard Constanza Lopez (-2006) chipped in 14 points, 13 rebounds, 7 assists and 4 steals during the contest. Four Juventud players scored in double figures. At the losing side center Agostina Nogueira (-2004) responded with 9 points, 18 rebounds and 4 blocks and forward Magdalena Machuca (-2006) scored 15 points and 9 rebounds. Since the result was very predictable, it gave the chance for the coaches to test many bench players and allowed the starting five to rest. Juventud moved-up to eighth place. Hebraica at the other side still closes the standings with eight games lost.\n\nTop scorers:\n\nHebraica: M.Machuca 15+9reb+2ast, A.Nogueira 9+18reb+1ast, C.Rijo 5+9reb, V.Isbarbo 5+3reb, S.Godoy 4+4reb, V.Viera 3+3reb+2ast\n\nJuventud: F.Spinelli 26+12reb+2ast, S.Molina 16+10reb+8ast, C.Lopez 14+13reb+7ast, K.Acosta 11+7reb+2ast, S.Robert 9+6reb, N.Gutierrez 8\n\ngschID: 1176422\n\nThe Minnesota Lynx are ready for a dialogue change in the WNBA. \"You got to talk about us now, you've got no choice,\" Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said after her team beat the New York Liberty 94-89 to win the Commissioner's Cup Trophy. \"We don't really care what you think, except for right now, when we get to say to you, 'You've got to talk about us.' \"We just beat a superteam. You know how hard that is to do? Because you guys love your superteams. That's all you want to talk about. But we just beat a superteam. Let's talk about it.\" Last season, the WNBA narrative was dominated by discussion of so-called superteams Las Vegas and New York. They met for the 2023 Commissioner's Cup, won by the Liberty, and then in the WNBA Finals, won by the Aces. The Lynx whose dynasty years ran from 2011 to 2017, when they won four titles and went to two other Finals are ready to be back in the conversation about WNBA championships. The way they played Tuesday proved that, as has their 13-3 start this season. The Commissioner's Cup, an in-season competition started in 2021, has grown in prestige among the players, who compete for a $500,000 prize pool. The Cup format was changed this year with each team playing five regular-season games, rather than the previous 10, to determine their place in the Cup standings. Another change was having all the Cup games in a two-week span and then the final, all in June. \"I like the format this year. I like that it's so condensed,\" said Lynx forward Napheesa Collier (6'1''-F-1996, college: UConn), who was the game's MVP with 21 points and 6 rebounds. \"It's easier to follow for the fans, and for us [players]. \"And it means a lot. We're competitors, and you want to win every game you're in. The money makes it really fun as well. It's a great team we just beat, it's a game we won and we won some money. So it's like a trifecta.\" That was an appropriate term, considering the game was at UBS Arena next to horse racing's Belmont Park. The Liberty's better finish in Cup play gave them hosting rights, but their home, Barclays Center in Brooklyn, was unavailable Tuesday as it was being prepared for Wednesday's NBA draft. Still, the Liberty crowd showed up loud and especially cheered on Courtney Vandersloot (5'8''-PG-1989, college: Gonzaga), who returned after missing eight games because of her mother's death from cancer, and Betnijah Laney-Hamilton, back after missing three games with a knee injury. They helped the Liberty get a 50-47 halftime lead. But Minnesota took over in the third quarter, outscoring New York 19-10, and then held off the Liberty in the final quarter. Collier is the Lynx's star, but they also got big games from Bridget Carleton (6'1''-F-1997, college: Iowa St.) (23 points, 4 rebounds, 5 assists) and Cecilia Zandalasini (6'2''-F-1996) (15 points off the bench). The two combined to shoot 13-of-16 from the field. Breanna Stewart (6'4''-F-1994, college: UConn) (24 points, 11 rebounds) and Sabrina Ionescu (5'11''-PG, college: Oregon) (23 points, 10 rebounds) led New York. Like Collier, they are on the U.S. 5-on-5 Olympic team coached by Reeve. The Liberty's issue Tuesday, more than anything, was their 21 turnovers. That and the resilience of the Lynx. Reeve isn't shy about saying her team, which rose to No. 1 Monday in the ESPN Power Rankings, has been underestimated. And even though Tuesday's game doesn't count in the regular-season standings, the message the Lynx sent was clear. \"We have a lot of offensive threats, but on defense, we're so solid,\" Collier said. \"That's why it's so hard to play against us. Our aggressiveness, our willingness to sell out on anything [because] we have each other's backs. \"This is the most talented, most fun team I've been on since I've been here. We want to build on this, we don't want to peak here. We want to achieve bigger things than this at the end of the season.\"\n\nCourtesy of: espn.com"
