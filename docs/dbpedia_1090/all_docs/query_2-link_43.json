        "text": "Roadless traction Ltd Was founded in 1919 by Colonel Phillip Henry Johnson, a brilliant engineer, to exploit the Tracks that he had worked on during the First World War. Between 1925 and the 1950s Roadless built crawler and half track conversions tractors based on several makes of tractor. From 1953, the company built 4-wd conversions based on Ford tractors, as well as some other makes, from the 1960 till 1983 when they went into liquidation. The firm was revived for a short time but then the new owners also went bust and tractor production ended.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Roadless company was founded in 1919 by a group of Army officers lead by Colonel Phillip H Johnson, with Captain Edward Lionel Firth, Captain G. John Rackham, Captain Oscar Styles Penn, Lieutenant Shaw and Fredrick Lamb. They were all involved in designing tracked systems for the army during the war.\n\nColonel P. H. Johnson[]\n\nJohnson was born in 1877, and educated at King Edward VI School Birmingham, before studying engineering art 'Durham College of Science' in Newcastle. He then served an apprenticeship in various ship building and engineering firms. He tried to Enlist in the Army in 1899 for the Boar war but was rejected for poor Eye sight. So travelled to South Africa and managed to get seconded to the 48th Steam transport Corp. of the Royal Engineers for his steam experience. Here he met up with a Lieutenant-Colonel Crompton who also had an interest in engineering. The Corp had Forty-Six traction engines (41 being Fowlers). When the War ended he was taken on by Fowlers and returned home to Leeds. For Fowlers he worked in R&D and travelled to India as sale representative. In 1915 he returned home and was attached to the Ministry of Munitions were he then got involved in tank design and was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Army Service Corps.\n\nMore history needed\n\nProduction[]\n\nRoadless produced / Sold 7915 4-wd Axle conversions or axle & transfer drive kits before their demise in 1983.\n\nThe End of Roadless Traction[]\n\nRoadless went bust in March 1983 and the remaining stock was taken over and several tractors built from parts and sold as Jewelltracm built by L F Jewell Ltdm a west country Ford Dealer.
