        "text": "Results\n\nOf a total of 21,642 patients in the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, 1502 patients (6.9%) had been diagnosed with COPD. Of them, 1128 (6.8%) corresponded to WAVE1 and 374 (7.7%) to WAVE2. The proportion of patients with COPD hospitalized due to COVID-19 was significantly greater in WAVE2 (p < 0.05).\n\nEighty-two percent of patients in the first wave and 88% of patients in the second wave were men. Thirty-six percent of patients in WAVE1 and 46% of patients in WAVE2 were older than 80 years ( ).\n\nTable 1\n\nTotal (1502)WAVE1 (1128)WAVE2 (374)p WAVE1 vs WAVE2Men84%82%88%p < 0.01>80 years39%36%46%HT70%69%72%NSDyslipidemia54%54%54%NSAF23%24%22%NSObesity28%28%30%NSDry cough45%48%36%p < 0.05Fever50%52%44%p < 0.05Dyspnea72%74%66%p < 0.05SatO2 < 92%41%43%36%p < 0.05Kidney failure44%42%50%p < 0.05Radiological condensation43%46%31%p < 0.05Prone positioning11%12%6%NSHFNC oxygen therapy13%12%14%NSNIMV11%11%10%NSIMV6%6%7%NSICU8%8%10%NSMortality33.4%35%28.6%p < 0.05\n\nThe clinical presentation of patients with COPD continued to mainly be dyspnea, fever, and dry cough, but in the second wave, patients presented with significantly less dry cough, fever, and dyspnea (p < 0.05). Differences were found in hypoxemia, with 43% of patients in WAVE1 and 36% of patients in WAVE2 presenting with SatO2 <92% (p < 0.05). Patients in WAVE2 presented with more kidney failure (42% vs 50%, p < 0.05) and less radiological condensation (46% vs 31%, p < 0.05) than those in WAVE1 ( ). Symptoms differed somewhat in women, who presented with more nonspecific symptoms such as arthromyalgia (27% vs 21%, p < 0.05), headache (13% vs 5%, p < 0.05), and absence of fever or low-grade fever (59% vs 47%, p < 0.05).\n\nThere were differences in the treatments used in both waves. In WAVE2, lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine were not used; 15% of patients received remdesivir (1% in WAVE1); and 88% of patients received treatment with systemic glucocorticoids, compared to 51% in the first wave. Fewer antibiotics were used (82% vs 91%) and a lower rate of polypharmacy was observed in patients in WAVE2.\n\nThe overall mortality rate in patients with COPD was 33.4%: 35% in WAVE1 and 28.6% in WAVE2. Mortality declined in the second wave, with the decline being greater than what occurred in the total population of patients with COVID-19 ( ). Mortality was greater in men with COPD than in women (35.2% vs 24.5%, p < 0.001) and declined in WAVE2, with the decline being greater in women: 26.1% vs 17.4%.\n\nThe probability of death in those older than 80 years is significantly greater than in the rest of patients (p < 0.05). Nearly all comorbidities increased mortality, but only HT (WAVE1: 38.4% vs WAVE2: 29.3%, p = 0.005) and obesity (40.4% vs 27.9%, p = 0.018) significantly increased mortality between waves.\n\nIn all patients with COPD, the presence of dyspnea is an indicator of poor prognosis (49% vs 30%, p < 0.05) and mortality (37.3% vs 23.2%, p < 0.05). On the contrary, patients who had anosmia (mortality 11.5% vs 34.2%, p < 0.05), ageusia (mortality 14.8% vs 34%, p < 0.05), or arthromyalgias (mortality 27% vs 35.2%, p < 0.05) had a better prognosis.\n\nPatients with SatO2 < 92%, creatinine >1.2 mg/dL, or bilateral lung lesions on radiologic tests had greater mortality and a worse prognosis ( ). No differences were found between waves in levels of procalcitonin or D-dimer.\n\nTable 2\n\nTotal mortalityMortality WAVE1Mortality WAVE2p WAVE1 vs WAVE2Poor overall prognosisPoor prognosis WAVE1Poor prognosis WAVE2p WAVE1 vs WAVE233%35%28.6%44%46%38%Confusion52%54%47%p<0.0562%64%57%p < 0.05Tachypnea46%47%40%p<0.0559%60%53%p < 0.05Sat02* <92%45%46%43%p<0.0559%60%55%p < 0.05Creatinine >1.2 mg/dL44%46%39%p<0.0553%56%47%p < 0.05Bilateral condensation on X-ray**44%46%36%p<0.0554%57%42%p < 0.05Bilateral interstitial pattern on X-ray**39%40%34%p < 0.0552%54%48%p < 0.05\n\nNo differences in mortality were found among patients with chronic habitual use of inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled beta-adrenergics, and inhaled anticholinergics compared to patients who did not use them. Patients treated with systemic glucocorticoids had greater overall mortality (47.1% vs 32.2%, p < 0.001) and a worse prognosis on the combined variable (57% vs 43%, p < 0.001) than those who did not use them.\n\nAmong all patients, those who received inhaled therapy had lower mortality (35.8% vs 27.3%, p < 0.05) and a lower percentage on the composite poor prognosis variable (46% vs 39%, p < 0.05). Patients who received beta-adrenergics had lower mortality (23% vs 33%, p < 0.05). Those who received ipratropium (30% vs 44%, p < 0.05; 35% vs 44%, p < 0.05, respectively) had a better prognosis on the combined variable ( ).\n\nPatients who did not receive any antibiotics had a lower mortality rate (25% vs 33%, p < 0.05) and a better prognosis (35% vs 44%, p < 0.05) than the mean. Comparing other treatments received during hospitalization (angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), statins, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)), there were no differences in mortality or the composite poor prognosis variable except for LMWH at full anticoagulation doses, which was associated with a poor prognosis (55% vs 44%, p < 0.05).\n\nOn the regression analysis, WAVE1 was treated as the main independent variable and mortality and the composite poor prognosis variable as the dependent variable. Respiratory failure and radiological involvement were treated as possible confounding factors. If respiratory failure and radiological involvement are analyzed separately, there is no sufficiently strong statistical evidence that these factors are responsible for the differences in mortality and poor prognosis between waves. On the contrary, when the two factors are analyzed jointly, there are differences ( ).\n\nTable 3\n\nResults for mortalityCrude OR (95% CI)Adjusted OR (95% CI)Magnitude differenceSatO2* <92%1.34 (1.04–1.74)1.28 (0.99–1.86)4.80%Bilateral condensation on X-ray**1.34 (1.04–1.74)1.26 (0.98–1.64)6.10%SatO2* <92% + Bilateral condensation on X-ray**1.34 (1.04–1.74)1.21 (0.93–1.58)9.80%\n\nResults for the composite poor prognosis variableCrude OR (95% CI)Adjusted OR (95% CI)Magnitude differenceSatO2* <92%1.39 (1.1–1.78)1.33 (1.04–1.7)4.80%Bilateral condensation on X-ray**1.39 (1.1–1.78)1.33 (1.04–1.69)5.10%SatO2* <92% + Bilateral condensation on X-ray**1.39 (1.1–1.78)1.28 (0.99–1.64)8.70%\n\nDiscussion\n\nAccording to other published works, the percentage of patients with COPD hospitalized due to COVID-19 is lower than the overall prevalence of the disease in the population. In the previously reported SEMI-COVID-19 registry, the prevalence of COPD in the first wave was 7.6% and the prevalence in this study is 6.9%, a variation that may be due to the inclusion of more cases following publication of the initial study. However, in this series, the proportion of patients with COPD increased significantly in the second wave compared to the first.2, 3, 4\n\nPrevious works have described that patients with COPD who are hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 infection are predominantly men; are older adults; have high comorbidity; have symptoms which consist of an increase in dyspnea and expectoration with fever or low-grade fever; and present with hypoxemia, tachypnea, and confusional syndrome upon admission.4\n\nThis work found that patients in the second wave continued to mainly be older men. These patients in the second wave presented with fewer symptoms, less respiratory failure, and less condensation on radiological tests. This suggests that patients in WAVE2 arrived to the hospital earlier, with less advanced disease, and in better condition than in WAVE1. This could have been influenced by the general population’s better knowledge on the disease and its symptoms and consequently, patients may have consulted sooner; an improvement in diagnostics, with an earlier diagnosis and a diagnosis in milder phases; less collapse of the healthcare system; and a change in virologic pattern given that in the second wave, the mean viral load value was lower and the highest levels were detected among younger patients, which could be explained by a lower level of viral inoculation as a consequence of the use of masks, social distancing, and restrictions on gatherings.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n\nAs previous publications have described, age continues to be one of the main prognostic factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with COPD.\n\nAlthough mortality decreased in the second wave, the mortality rate in patients with COPD is nearly double that of the population without COPD. In addition to this, the older age of patients with COPD than the rest of the hospitalized population and the high comorbidity of patients with COPD, especially cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity, are clear factors of a poor prognosis in COVID-19. In this work, the comorbidity of patients with COPD continues to be very high, with no differences between the two waves, as has been reported in other publications.4, 10, 11\n\nThe better prognosis in women is notable, with a greater decline in mortality in the second wave than in men with COPD. One of the hypotheses that could explain this difference due to sex is based on the role of sex in the genetic and hormonal regulation of immune responses and in the different ACE2 activity between men and women; men with hypertension and heart failure tend to have a higher level of ACE2 serum activity compared to women.12, 13\n\nThere was a lower mortality and better prognosis in WAVE2. In a work comparing mortality in the two waves in Japan, mortality was also lower in the second wave, even when stratified by age and severity upon admission. The authors linked this to a shorter period of time between disease onset and admission and that the patients had milder disease upon admission.14 After the regression analysis in this series, it was also observed that the patients’ better clinical situation—reflected in the combination of lesser respiratory failure and lesser radiologic involvement—would be behind the lower mortality rate and better prognosis observed in WAVE2. Other works have suggested that the pattern of inflammation in the second wave—measured through biomarkers such as LDH, ferritin, CRP, IL-6, and D-dimer—was lower. This was not able to be confirmed in this series, in which no differences were found in the lymphocytes or d-dimer figures between the waves.15\n\nContou et al. described less of a need for invasive mechanical ventilation in the second wave of patients hospitalized in the ICU, but did not find any differences in mortality. Other authors have also reported greater use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation in the second wave. In this study, no differences were found between waves in the need for high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or ICU admission.16\n\nOne of the factors that contributed to the improvement in patients’ prognosis in the second wave is undoubtedly the fact that Spain’s healthcare system was better prepared than in the first wave; more diagnostic tests were performed and performed earlier; and there was more experience with and scientific evidence on treatment. In the second wave, drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir or hydroxychloroquine were no longer used whereas remdesivir, tocilizumab were used; most patients (88% in this series) received systemic glucocorticoids. There was less polypharmacy in the second wave and lesser use of antibiotics, which was also described by Brehm, who additionally reported fewer nosocomial infections.17\n\nIn this work, 46% of patients were in treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids and, as in the work by Mancia, it was not found to influence the prognosis of patients with COPD.18 No differences were found in patients who were in chronic inhalation therapy with beta-adrenergics, tiotropium, or other long-acting anticholinergics either. The protective and prognostic role in COVID-19 of habitual inhalation therapy in patients with COPD is continuously under review. Indeed, there are works that do suggest benefits of tiotropium as a protective factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection19 and others in which inhalatory treatment with steroids and tiotropium are a protective factor against mortality.20\n\nThe improvement in the prognosis of patients who received treatment with inhaled bronchodilators was notable. In patients with exacerbated COPD, beta-adrenergics and short-acting muscarinic antagonists are the basis of treatment. The fact that there were patients who did not receive bronchodilator treatment during hospitalization may be due to the high rates of contagion among healthcare personnel attributed to the use of nebulizers during the first wave. In patients with COPD hospitalized due to COVID-19, bronchodilator treatment must be administered unless it is contraindicated. It is recommended to avoid nebulizations and instead provide treatment with pressurized, dry powder, or soft mist inhalers with or without a spacer device."
