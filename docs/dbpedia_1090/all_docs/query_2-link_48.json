From August 2007 to June 2008, 1,405 ticks were collected and five species were identified: Amblyomma cajennense (Fabricius, 1787, Amblyomma ovale Koch, 1844, Dermacentornitens Neumann, 1897, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus microplus (Canestrini, 1887, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille,1806. Dogs from urban areas were found exclusively infested by R. sanguineus, whereas dogs from rural areas were found infested by A. cajennense, A. ovale, R. (B. microplus, and R. sanguineus. The only tick species found on cattle and goats was R. (B. microplus. Horses were found infested by D. nitens and at a lesser extent by A. cajennense and R. (B. microplus. The only tick species found on donkeys was D. nitens. This study confirms the presence of A. cajennense inPernambuco and describes for the first time the presence of A. ovale in this state. The medical and veterinary relevance and control of ticks associated with domestic animals in Pernambuco are also briefly discussed.O objetivo desse artigo Ã© discutir alguns aspectos relacionados aos carrapatos que parasitam animais domÃ©sticos no Estado de Pernambuco com base numa revisÃ£o da literatura e apresentar novos dados obtidos a partir de recentes coletas de carrapatos realizadas nesse estado do nordeste brasileiro.

A time-series study was conducted with data from the principal health information systems, analyzing indicators before and after implementation of the FHP in 1995. The independent variable was year of birth, related to degree of population coverage by the FHP. Three periods were analyzed: 1990-1994 (prior), 1995-1996 (implementation phase: 0 to 30% coverage), and 1997-2002 (intervention: coverage of 38.6% to 54%). Trends in the indicators were analyzed by simple linear regression, testing significance with the t test. During the implementation period there was an increase in all the vaccination coverage rates (176% BCG, 223% polio, 52% DPT, 61% measures) and a decrease in infant mortality from preventable diseases (12.7 deaths/year), even without a decrease in absolute poverty in the municipality or an increase in either coverage by the public health care system or the sewage system. Improvement in the indicators demonstrates the effectiveness of FHP actions in the municipality.\n\nDiversity of gall-inducing insects in the high altitude wetland forests in Pernambuco, Northeastern Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJC Santos\n\nFull Text Available We report on the richness of galling insects in the altitudinal wetland forests of Pernambuco State, Northeastern Brazil. We found 80 distinct types of insect galls on 49 species of host plants belonging to 28 families and 35 genera. Most of the galled plant species belong to Nyctaginaceae, Fabaceae, Meliaceae, Sapindaceae and Myrtaceae. The most common gall were spheroid and globoid; most galls were glabrous, predominantly green and with one chamber, and on the leaves. Most galls were induced by Cecidomyiidae (Diptera. The results of this study contribute to existing knowledge richness of galling insects and host-plant diversity in the altitudinal wetland forests of Northeastern Brazil.\n\nIncentivo ao aleitamento materno: uma avaliaÃ§Ã£o das equipes de saÃºde da famÃ­lia do municÃ­pio de Olinda, Pernambuco Incentive to breast feeding: an evaluation of family health teams in the municipality of Olinda, Pernambuco\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLuciana Santos Dubeux\n\n2004-12-01\n\nFull Text Available OBJETIVOS: avaliar o grau de implantaÃ§Ã£o da aÃ§Ã£o de Incentivo ao Aleitamento Materno (IAM em Olinda, 2003. MÃTODOS: estudo avaliativo-normativo, transversal realizado nas 40 Equipes de SaÃºde da FamÃ­lia (ESF implantadas nos dois Distritos SanitÃ¡rios (DS de Olinda, entre julho e setembro de 2003. O instrumento utilizado contemplou questÃµes relativas Ã aÃ§Ã£o de IAM e a julgou como implantada (90% a 100% de respostas positivas, parcialmente implantada aceitÃ¡vel (70% a menos de 90% de respostas positivas, parcialmente implantada nÃ£o aceitÃ¡vel (50% a menos de 70% de respostas positivas e nÃ£o implantada (concordÃ¢ncia inferior a 50%. RESULTADOS: a aÃ§Ã£o de IAM foi implantada em 22,5% das ESF e em 57,5% parcialmente implantada aceitÃ¡vel, havendo melhor desempenho do DS II. Dentre as atividades para a promoÃ§Ã£o da aÃ§Ã£o, destacam-se: o \"incentivo precoce ao aleitamento materno exclusivo\", a \"orientaÃ§Ã£o no prÃ©-natal\", a \"orientaÃ§Ã£o alimentar para o desmame\" e o \"envolvimento multiprofissional\", como as mais desenvolvidas pelas equipes de ambos os DS. CONCLUSÃES: houve insuficiente adesÃ£o das ESF Ã s atividades preconizadas pelo MinistÃ©rio da SaÃºde, repercutindo no grau de implantaÃ§Ã£o da aÃ§Ã£o de IAM, e possivelmente desfavorecendo um aumento da prevalÃªncia do aleitamento materno exclusivo e suas modalidades em Olinda.OBJECTIVES: to assess performance of the Breast Feeding Incentive Program implementation in the municipality of Olinda, in 2003.

Thirty-six milk production systems of family and corporate farming were evaluated during twelve months, in order to identify and quantify the benchmarks. The systems were characterized regarding their size and technological, zootechnical and economic profiles. The correlation coefficients of the return rate on invested capital were assessed and regression equations were developed for each indicator, according to four scenarios of annual return rates (4, 6, 8 and 10%. The indicators evaluated were milk production per dairy cows, milk production per area, average price of milk, effective operational cost, total operating cost, total cost per price of milk and profitability. The dairy farming in the Pernambuco Agreste region pays the production costs, but tends to a not adequate remuneration of family labor and a need of external capital input for replacement of the assets. The productivity of production factors area and animals showed higher correlation with cost-effectiveness, denoting the need for increase the production through increases in land area and milk productivity per dairy cow. The identification and quantification of benchmarks may help to identify the weak points of dairy farming in the Agreste region, making it sustainable and competitive.\n\nTicks infesting amphibians and reptiles in Pernambuco, Northeastern Brazil.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDantas-Torres, Filipe; Oliveira-Filho, Edmilson F; Soares, FÃ¡bio Angelo M; Souza, Bruno O F; ValenÃ§a, Raul Baltazar P; SÃ¡, FabrÃ­cio B\n\n2008-01-01\n\nTicks infesting amphibians and reptiles in the State of Pernambuco are reviewed, based on the current literature and new collections recently carried out by the authors. To date, three tick species have been found on amphibians and reptiles in Pernambuco. Amblyomma fuscum appears to be exclusively associated with Boa constrictor, its type host. Amblyomma rotundatum has a relatively low host-specificity, being found on toads, snakes, and iguana. Amblyomma dissimile has been found on a lizard and also small mammals (i.e., rodents and marsupials). New tick-host associations and locality records are given.\n\nImmature Aedes mosquitoes colonize Culex quinquefasciatus breeding sites in neighborhoods in the municipality of Olinda, State of Pernambuco\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSuzane Alves dos Santos\n\n2014-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Introduction The present study shows the colonization of Aedes mosquitoes in breeding sites specific for Culex quinquefasciatus in neighborhoods in the municipality of Olinda. Methods Samples were collected between May 2011 and June 2012 from breeding sites positive for Cx. quinquefasciatus by using a ladle and manual suction pump. Results Aedes aegypti (0.12%, Aedes albopictus (0.03%, and Cx. quinquefasciatus (99.8% were found across the breeding sites. Conclusions The presence of Aedes ssp. in several Cx. quinquefasciatus breeding sites with a heavy load of organic material demonstrates the need to review the concepts and methods used for treatment, as the use of specific larvicide for breeding sites of Culex.\n\nBenthic Bacillariophyta of the Paripe River estuary in Pernambuco state, Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAN.

Gomes\n\n2008-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Fungi comprehend a heterogeneous group of heterotrophic microorganisms that act as saprobes or parasites or, less frequently, as symbionts living in association with other organisms. They are cosmopolitan and important components of ecosystems. Considering the small number of Brazilian papers on the filamentous mycota in marine environments, and the need to improve knowledge of the diversity of these microfungi in \"Casa Caiada\" and \"Bairro Novo\" beaches, Olinda, PE, the aim of this work was to isolate and identify the fungi from sand and water samples of these ecosystems. Thirty two samplings of sand (surface and 20 cm deep and water (surface and 1 m deep were carried out during the dry and rainy seasons, in low and high tide. From each sand sample, a suspension was made with 50 g of sand diluted in 90 mL of sterilized distilled water. From each sand suspension and water sample, 0.5 mL was spread, in triplicate, onto Petri dishes containing Sabouraud Agar added of chloramphenicol. The plates were incubated at 28 Â°C (Â±2 Â°C. Fifty seven species were isolated, identified, and classified in 20 genera. Aspergillus and Penicillium were the most frequent genera in both sand and water, with a total of 11 and 19 species, respectively.Os fungos compreendem um grupo heterogÃªneo de microorganismos heterotrÃ³ficos, atuando como saprÃ³bios ou parasitas, ou menos freqÃ¼entemente como simbiontes, vivendo em associaÃ§Ã£o com outros organismos.

S.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Restinga vegetation occurs along the entire coast of Brazil. The 187 km of coastline of the state ofPernambuco demonstrates a diversity of habitats, such as beaches, dunes, and restingas. The present study sought toelaborate a checklist of the phanerogamic species found there. The species listed were compiled from surveysundertaken between 1951 and 2007, as well as from herbaria collections in that state. A total of 477 species distributedamong 303 genera and 95 families were encountered. The families with the greatest numbers of species were Poaceae(39 species, Fabaceae (34, Cyperaceae (26, Euphorbiaceae (25, Myrtaceae (24, Rubiaceae (20, Caesalpiniaceae(17, Mimosaceae (16, Asteraceae (14, Orchidaceae (14, Bromeliaceae (9, Boraginaceae (8, Malvaceae (8,Solanaceae (8, and Annonaceae, Araceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Malpighiaceae, and Melastomataceae (7 each.Approximately 60 % of the species were common to other restinga areas in northeastern Brazil, and 39.3 % wererestricted to the coast of Pernambuco.\n\nRabies virus in Molossus molossus (Chiroptera: Molossidae in the State of Pernambuco, Northeastern Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLuiz Augustinho Menezes da Silva\n\n2011-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Rabies virus was detected in bats (Molossus molossus from an urban area in the City of Recife, State of Pernambuco, Brazil. Four individuals were found during the day in visible, non-habitual places, lying on the ground, but still alive. No contact occurred with people or animals. Of these, only two were identified; it was not possible to identify two specimens, since they were incinerated prior to identification. Diagnosis was positive by direct immunofluorescence and intracerebral inoculation in mice. This study presents the first instance in which the virus was detected in insectivorous bats in the State of Pernambuco.\n\nESTRATÃGIAS, DISPUTAS E DINÃMICAS TERRITORIAIS NO QUILOMBO DA NAÃÃO XAMBÃ EM OLINDA\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCristina AmÃ©lia Carvalho\n\n2011-08-01\n\nFull Text Available XambÃ¡ is among the cults of African origin in Pernambuco, and Terreiro Santa BÃ¡rbara in Olinda is highly relevant. In 2007 he was granted the title of Urban Quilombo. Since then, it has been claiming the symbolic space of an old ice factory in order to establish a Center for Culture in its premises, thus opposing the Municipality plan to build a bus station. A conflict scenario is formed in which opposing interests confront each other. The dynamics of actors, its own interests, the strategies used and relations established comprise this complex scenario. This paper try to understand the configurations of strategy of these conflicting social agents, their alliances, support and resistance. As an amorphous space is turned into a territory, it guides actors and causes chain reactions. Bourdieu's (1996. theory of social fields explains the dynamics established in the construction of public policies and the action of social agents participating in this construction. Politics emerge as the dispute dimension where the struggle field is established for all agents involved. The text investigates the \"production of organizing\" in an ongoing process and describes the territorial dynamics, strategies and alliances of these social groups as they confront the authorities in power.\n\nBRAZILâS NORTHEASTERN COAST AND THE ESTATE-TOURISM: BAHIA, PERNAMBUCO, CEARÃ AND RIO GRANDE DO NORTE\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlexandre Queiroz Pereira\n\n2014-07-01\n\nFull Text Available The Northeast region of Brazil had its tourist preponderance planned in the last decade of the twentieth century. Before that time, the regional public policies did not see tourism as a strategic and developmental activity in Brazil and also did not evaluate the impacts arising from the real estate deals proper for summer vacation. In this paper, we propose an investigation on the diffusion models and ideas about the global and local tourism and summer vocations activities in coastal areas, focusing on the coast of the Northeastern region of Brazil. The territorial arrangement promoted by the construction of tourist-estate on the coast of Bahia, CearÃ¡, Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte were the focus of the research, as they are the largest recipients of these types of properties for leisure. Regarding the Methodologly, the study was conducted in three stages: bibliographical survey, secondary data analysis, along with the right public bodies and the preparation of cartograms that enabled the understanding of logical installation of these projects in the main cities of the Northeast region. The coast designed as recreational space is a spatiality predominantly in the main cities of the Northeast region of Brazil. There are leasing investments in non-metropolitan centers, however, the metropolitan perimeters are the ones that consolidate large private estate projects regarding on the new demands facing the tourists demands.\n\nA dinÃ¢mica dos homicÃ­dios no Nordeste e em Pernambuco\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJosÃ© Maria NÃ³brega JÃºnior\n\n2010-10-01\n\nFull Text Available O objetivo deste artigo Ã© analisar a dinÃ¢mica das mortes por homicÃ­dio no Nordeste, regiÃ£o mais violenta do paÃ­s em termos desse tipo de crime.

Spatial analysis may thus become an important tool to establish an epidemiological surveillance system for leprosy. Homogeneous micro-areas were defined in the city of Olinda through the integration of two databases, the Population Census and SINAN, and through the use of digital maps and geoprocessing techniques. Census tracts were classified according to a social deprivation index (SDI, and micro-area homogeneity was based on similar values for this indicator.

Pessenda\n\n2008-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The aim of this research was to reconstruct vegetation changes (with climate inferences that occurred during the Holocene in the Fernando de Noronha Island, Pernambuco State, northeastern Brazil. The research approach included the use of geochemical (mineralogy, elemental, carbon isotopes (Î´13C, 14C and pollen analyses in soil organic matter (SOM and sediments collected in Lagoa da ViraÃ§Ã£o and Manguezal do Sueste. The carbon isotopes data of SOM indicated that there was no significant vegetation changes during the last 7400 BP, suggesting that the climate was not the determinant factor for the vegetation dynamics. The pollen analysis of the sediment of a core collected in the Lagoa da ViraÃ§Ã£o showed the absence of Quaternary material in the period between 720 BP and 90 BP. The mineralogical analysis of deeper layer showed the presence of diopside indicating this material was developed \"in situ\". Only in the shallow part of the core were found pollen of similar plant species of the modern vegetation. The geochemistry and isotope results, in association with the sediment type and pollen analyses of sediment samples of Manguezal do Sueste, indicated variations in the vegetation and in its location since the middle Holocene. Such variations can be associated with climatic events and sea level oscillations and also with anthropogenic events considering the last five hundred years.Esta pesquisa teve o objetivo de reconstruir trocas de vegetaÃ§Ã£o (com referÃªncias climÃ¡ticas que ocorreram durante o Holoceno na ilha de Fernando de Noronha, Estado de Pernambuco, nordeste do Brasil.

Initially, the ISC was considered and applied in aboriginal communities in Canada and the United States. Aiming to verify its applicability for Brazilian aboriginal groups, it was used in the present work to evaluate the cultural meaning of the useful species for the Xucuru tribe, in pesqueira county, Pernambuco. In Brazil, it is the first time that this index has been used with a northeastern aboriginal community, the Xucuru, one of the seven tribes remaining in Pernambuco. From informal interviews, 97 useful species were registered among trees, shrubs and grass growing in the Pedra DâÃgua forest (Humid OrorobÃ¡-Forest, in yards, and in small cultivated areas in the village. The ISC provided a numeric order of importance for the plants registered in the Xucuru tribe, much like the one observed in the field. Musa paradisiaca was the species of greatest meaning for the community (ICS 120, followed by Rosmarinum officinalis (ICS 92, Xerophyta plicata (ICS 88, Aspidosperma sp.

Ticks found on two veterinarians working in one of the parks (i.e., Parque Estadual Dois IrmÃ£os), after return from forested areas within the park's territory, were also identified. The following tick-host associations were recorded: Amblyomma fuscum Neumann on Boa constrictor L.; Amblyomma longirostre Koch on Ramphastos vitellinus ariel Vigors and Coendou prehensilis (L.); Amblyomma varium Koch on Bradypus variegates Schinz; Amblyomma rotundatum Koch on Chelonoidis carbonaria (Spix), Chelonoidis denticulata (L.), Micrurus ibiboboca (Merrem), Python molurus bivittatus Kuhl, Iguana iguana (L.) and B. variegatus; Amblyomma nodosum Neumann on Myrmecophaga tridactyla L. and Tamandua tetradactyla (L.); and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille) on Nasua nasua (L.). The ticks found on the veterinarians were identified as nine Amblyomma larvae. The presence of Am. nodosum in Pernambuco and Am. rotundatum and Am. varium in ParaÃ­ba is recorded for the first time and the occurrence of Am. longirostre in Pernambuco is confirmed. Ramphastos vitellinus ariel is a new host record for Am. longirostre whereas M. ibiboboca and B. variegatus are new host records for Am. rotundatum. Finally, the human parasitism by Amblyomma ticks is reported for the first time in Pernambuco, highlighting the potential of tick-borne pathogen transmission in this state.\n\nAgrobiodiversity and ethnoknowledge in Gleba Nova Olinda I, ParÃ¡: social interactions and sharing of manioc's germplasm (Manihot Esculenta Crantz, Euphorbiaceae\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPedro GlÃ©cio Costa Lima\n\n2013-08-01\n\nFull Text Available A major concern of ethnobiology is to understand the social relations that favor the occurrence and expansion of biological diversity in the Neotropic. This article evaluates the richness of ethnovarieties of cassava cultivated in communities located in public forest lands named Gleba Nova Olinda I, ParÃ¡ State, Brazil. Data were obtained in workshops with 46 informants, and were analyzed by qualitative and quantitative methods. There are at least 52 manioc ethnovarieties on this site and germplasm sharing occurs both inside and outside the community. The knowledge improvement on this agrobiological resource by community members shows the important role that the inhabitants play in biological conservation of Gleba Nova Olinda I. Thus, support to local development should be grounded on ethnoknowledge.\n\nHawkmoth fauna (Sphingidae, Lepidoptera in a semi-deciduous rainforest remnant: composition, temporal fluctuations, and new records for northeastern Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLUIS M. PRIMO\n\n2013-09-01\n\nFull Text Available We carried out a qualitative and quantitative inventory of the hawkmoth fauna (Sphingidae of an area of semi-deciduous seasonal rainforest in the state of Pernambuco (TapacurÃ¡ Ecological Station, northeastern Brazil. Hawkmoths were sampled monthly from October 2004 to February 2007 (27 months. We recorded 31 species from 16 genera, three tribes, and three families. Macroglossinae was the most abundant subfamily and represented ca. 71% of all species. Out of the 277 individuals collected, 88.4% were males. Five new records were made for northeastern Brazil: Enyo gorgon (Cramer, 1777, Perigonia stulta (Herrich-SchÃ¤ffer, [1854], Eupyrrhoglossum sagra (Poey, 1832, Nyceryx coffaeae (Walker, 1856 and Xylophanes chiron (Drury, 1773. Eight further species were recorded for the first time for the Pernambuco Endemism Center, showing the important role played by TapacurÃ¡ Station in preserving the biodiversity of this insect group. Species richness and abundance were directly related to rainfall: about 70% of all individuals were captured during the rainy season. Changes in Sphingidae populations may, however, be caused by other factors that directly affect either larvae and adults of those insects, such as matrix effect and forest fragment size, which influence migration processes and the presence of predators.\n\nDiferenciais na adequaÃ§Ã£o das informaÃ§Ãµes de eventos vitais nos municÃ­pios de Pernambuco, 2006-2008 Differentials in vital information in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, 2006-2008\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMirella Rodrigues\n\n2012-06-01\n\nbirth and death information systems in the state of Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil, between 2006 and 2008. The following indicators were used: age-standardized mortality rate, relative mean deviation of mortality rate, ratio of reported to estimated live births, relative mean deviation of birth rate and proportion of deaths of unknown cause. These indicators were grouped into three dimensions: mortality, fertility and ill-defined causes. Based on predetermined criteria, municipalities were classified as follows: consolidated vital data; vital data in the consolidation phase; and non-consolidated data. The data were analyzed using EpiInfo and Terraview for map preparation. RESULTS: Of the 185 municipalities in the state of Pernambuco, 141 (76.2% were classified as having consolidated vital data, accounting for about 85% of the state population, and 17 (9.2% were classified as having non-consolidated data, accounting for only 4.9% of the population. Larger municipalities (50,000 inhabitants or more showed better data quality. CONCLUSION: The approach studied proved itself valuable to assess the quality of vital information and identify inequalities in Pernambuco. Reduction of inequalities is a challenge in this state in the sense of enabling vital information to be analyzed directly from data systems at the local level. It will also allow assessing the effectiveness of initiatives to reduce infant mortality in Pernambuco.\n\nCompactaÃ§Ã£o primÃ¡ria do abomaso em 14 bovinos no estado de Pernambuco Primary abomasal impaction in 14 cattle from Pernambuco State, northeastern Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAntÃ´nio Carlos Lopes CÃ¢mara\n\n2009-05-01\n\nroughage for feeding cows in many regions, especially during the dry season, impaction of the abomasum has been poorly reported in Brazil, probably because the condition is misdiagnosed by practitioners. The present paper aimed to accomplish a retrospective study on primary abomasal impaction in 14 cattle from Pernambuco State, northeastern Brazil. Eight moderate cases, without severe abdominal distention and with no rumen compaction, were treated conservatively, and four severe cases, with severe abdominal distention and rumen compaction, were treated surgically. One bull was slaughtered and one cow died without treatment. The greater number of abomasal impaction cases was in Holstein cows with six cases (42.9%, followed by crossbred cattle with five cases (35.8%, and the breeds Brown-Swiss, Nelore and Marchigiana, each with one case (21.3%. The food composition was characterized by low quality fibers and varied greatly among cases. Most frequent clinical signs were apathy, dehydration, hypomotility and ruminal bloat, intestinal hypomotility and scanty or absent feces with mucus. The hematological findings revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and hyperfibrinogenemia in most cases. Ruminal fluid analysis showed compromised flora and fauna dynamics and increased chlorine ion concentration. Clinical (4/8 and chirurgical (2/4 recovery rate achieved 50%. The clinical and chirurgical methods remain as viable options for the treatment of light and severe impaction, but the prognosis is always reserved especially when associated to late pregnancy.\n\nPOPULATION BIOLOGY OF SEABOB-SHRIMP Xiphopenaeus kroyeri (Heller, 1862 CAPTURED ON THE SOUTH COAST OF PERNAMBUCO STATE, NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDanilo Francisco CorrÃªa Lopes\n\n2014-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper aims to describe the population dynamics and to evaluate the stock of the seabob-shrimp Xiphopenaeus kroyeri on the coast of Pernambuco.

Total length (Lt of females varied from 4.5 to 13.5 cm while the Lt of males ranged between 4.0 and 11.0 cm. The relationship between the Lt and carapace length and Lt and total weight showed negative allometry (males, females and pooled sexes. The slope of the curve \"b\" was statistically different between males and females for both relationships. Females mature with 8.90 cm. Asymptotic length Lâ was lower for males than for females (12.26 to 14.79 and 10.72 to 11.5 cm, respectively, K was similar between sexes (1.00-2.04 and 1.00-2.63 cm/year-1 respectively as well as the longevity and size at 1st capture (1.50 to 1.97 years and 7.9 to 8.9 cm for males and females, respectively. The results indicate that X. kroyeri in the region is not overexploited for males, however considering females and pooled sexes the stock is near to being fully exploited.\n\nEnvironmental effects of the TermoPernambuco; Impactos ambientais da TermoPernambuco\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGoncalves Filho, Luiz Carlos; Costa, Heitor Scalambrini [Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, PE (Brazil). Nucleo de Apoio a Projetos de Energias Renovaveis]. E-mail: naper@ufpe.br\n\n2006-07-01\n\nIn a world scale, 80% of the total energy consumed by mankind comes fossil fuel (charcoal, petroleum and natural gas). The massive use of that energy resource has lead to the exhaustion of its reserves and has turned itself into a real menace to the environment, as a consequence of the earth global warming (greenhouse effect), of the risk to the public health and of the acidification of the water cycle. Whenever that type of fuel is burned in thermoelectric power plants, in transportation vehicles and in the industry, it liberates highly toxic gases and other pollutants (carbonic gas, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, among others), which are largely the responsible for the mentioned environmental impacts to the point of putting at stake the very survival of the human race. In the context of the Thermoelectricity Priority Program, launched by the federal government in February 24th, 2000 (Decree 3.371), the Pernambuco State Government has authorized the construction of a thermoelectric power plant powered by natural gas - the Thermo Pernambuco - in the harbor region of Suape, with a installed capacity of generating 520 MW. In this work the environmental impacts of the Thermo Pernambuco are shown in which concerns to the production of toxic gases. Those results were obtained through a bibliographic research about similar situations and through the detailed analysis of the EIA/RIMA reports (needed for the complying with the Brazilian environmental laws). We show that that plant will be responsible for a considerable increase in the air pollution. Considering an 80% capacity factor , that is, the power plant operating for 7,000 hours per year, it will send yearly 1.8 million ton of C0{sub 2} (5,000 per day) and 836 ton of No{sub x} (2.3 ton per day).

The distance between the sites chosen for collections (Recife and SÃ£o LourenÃ§o da Mata) is approximately 16 km. The investigation was based on a comparative study of external morphological characteristics of the grasshoppers. Morphometric measurements took into account the different body parts and appendages. Statistical analysis of the measurements revealed significant differences in the size of the specimens between the two locations. Homogeneity tests of the covariance and equality matrices between mean vectors of the results revealed that the grasshopper populations in Recife and SÃ£o LourenÃ§o da Mata are distinctly different. These findings provide morphological evidence for intraspecific variation in morphological characteristics of the C. speciosa populations from the two locations.

Souza\n\n2000-12-01\n\nFull Text Available In Brazil the challenge of meeting the needs of those living in deprived areas has generated discussions on replacing the existing approach to epidemiological surveillance with an integrated public health surveillance system. This new approach would supplant the traditional focus on high-risk individuals with a method for identifying high-risk populations and the areas where these persons live. Given the magnitude of the problem that tuberculosis (TB poses for Brazil, we chose that disease as an example of how such a new, integrated public health surveillance system could be constructed. We integrated data from several sources with geographic information to create an indicator of tuberculosis risk for Olinda, a city in the Brazilian state of Pernambuco. In order to stratify the urban space in Olinda and to check for an association between the resulting TB risk gradient and the mean incidence of the disease between 1991 and 1996, we applied two different methods: 1 a \"social deprivation index\" and 2 principal component analysis followed by cluster analysis. Our results showed an association between social deprivation and the occurrence of TB. The results also highlighted priority groups and areas requiring intervention. We recommend follow-up that would include treating acid-fast bacilli smear-positive pulmonary TB cases, tracing of these persons' contacts, and monitoring of multidrug-resistant cases, all in coordination with local health services.En Brasil, el reto de satisfacer las necesidades de los residentes en zonas pobres ha generado discusiones sobre la sustituciÃ³n del actual abordaje de la vigilancia epidemiolÃ³gica por un sistema integrado de vigilancia de la salud pÃºblica.

For data gathering the Northeastern buffaloâs raisers society (SNC, professional workers, other farmers and also people from the Pernambuco Sugar-Cane Growers Association (AFCP were contacted by means of interviews and visits to the production system. The buffalo production system came to the area in a planed way by farmers at the first half of the 70âs and expanded to today. The herd is composed of Murrrah, Jafarabadi and Mediterranean species although the mestizos are prevailing. However, it is still quite deficient of technologies despite an apparent integration of the buffaloâs system with the sugar cane industry.

The depth of burrows and the salinity and temperature of theÂ water at the bottom of the burrows was registered. In Pernambuco and Alagoas, the profiles covered steep areas (with a gradient of 4.5Â° and shallow areasÂ (with a gradient of 0.02Â°. The maximum distance between existing burrows in the profiles, ranged from 58m and 359.5m, compared to a benchmark levelÂ (RN. The burrows depths ranged from 0.45m to 1.90m, with an depth average of 0.99m (DP = 0,29. The maximum depth of the burrows can be justified byÂ the fact that there is less availability of water in northeastern soils.It is recommended, studied the mangroves, the establishment of an exclusion zone to preserveÂ the habitat of Cardisoma guanhumi, a distance of at least 200m above the high tide mark.

When tracking the specific path and demands of members of the 1872 Sociedade Propagadora da InstruÃ§Ã£o PÃºblica as well as the petitions done by the teachers to the public power in the main working shifts of teaching - salaries, gratifications, exchanges, medical licenses, transferences, educational material etc - we will argue, using the methodology of microanalysis (REVEL, 1998, that the teachers as a working category was marked by individual practices of citizenship. In this sense, although there were associations, of âcommon interestsâ and a âdiscomfortâ of public teachers, those developed personal strategies, according to the privileges acquired along their career which in fact deviate from building a teacher identity\n\nBinge drinking and illicit drug use among adolescent students\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nJakelline Cipriano dos Santos Raposo; Ana Carolina de Queiroz Costa; Paula AndrÃ©a de Melo ValenÃ§a; PatrÃ­cia Maria Zarzar; Alcides da Silva Diniz; Viviane Colares; Carolina da Franca\n\n2017-01-01\n\nABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of illicit drug use and its association with binge drinking and sociodemographic factors among adolescent students.

E-mail: juniormariobaltazar@gmail.com The aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of Tritrichomonas foetus in bulls in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. In total, 105 samples of preputial smegma were collected from bulls in service belonging to different herds (n=63 and slaughterhouses (n=42. Genomic DNA extraction from collected samples was carried out to identify the agent in the samples and they were also submitted to the polymerase chain reaction. A frequency of 6.6% (2.7 - 13.2%; C.I. 95% was found for T. foetus. None of the slaughterhouse samples were positive. With regards to the number of foci, 21.8% (7/32 of the properties contained animals that were positive for T. foetus. In conclusion, T. foetus infection occurred in bulls in this way, this agent should be included in the diagnosis in animal health control programs. Therefore, as the removal of infected bulls and their replacement by younger animals, should be implemented in order to avoid the dissemination of the agent in herds.\n\nIsotopic variations ({delta}{sup 13} C and {delta}{sup 18} O) in Siderastrea stellata (Cnidaria-Anthozoa), Itamaraca island, State of Pernambuco, Northeastern Brazil\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nFerreira, Valderez P.; Sial, Alcides N.

Lab. de Macro e Megabentos\n\n1998-12-01\n\nIsotopic determinations for O and C were performed in coral skeletons collected in beach rocks from two localities (Orange and Catuama), Itamaraca Island, north littoral of the State of pernambuco, northeastern Brazil. Large variations of {delta}{sup 18} O and {delta}{sup 13} C in corals from both localities are found, the largest ones being observed at the Orange locality {delta}{sup 13} C in this locality varies from -0.8 to +1.8% PDB and {delta}{sup 1.8} O from -5.3 to -1.8% PDB, while at the Catuama locality, they vary from -1.8 to 0.1% PDB and -3.8 to -2.7% PDB, respectively. Large variations in {delta}{sup 18} O (up to 2.5%) coupled with weakly defined positive correlation between {delta}{sup 18} O and {delta}{sup 13} C, can be attributed to temperature variations as consequence of climatic perturbations. Temperature estimates, calculated from {delta}{sup 18} O values, assuming isotopic equilibrium with seawater, yield values between 24.9 deg C and 43.1 deg C at Orange, and from 28.4 deg C to 35 deg C at Catuama, all of them (expect one growth band from one sample) are high enough for the full development of the coral colony. Temperature average is 31.4 deg C at Orange, which is a little bit higher than that at Catuama, but both of them indicate thermal stress conditions. In all analyzed specimens, expect for one, at Orange, T increases was accompanied by decreasing in the organic activity, as suggested by corresponding negative {delta}{sup 13} C anomaly. Therefore, the observed bleaching is possibly related to thermal stress and the high T may be related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) warning event. On the other hand, anthropogenic action at Orange, local of intense tourism throughout the year, coupled with high rate of sedimentation in the region, may contribute to the observed coral bleaching.

Despite its potential conservation importance the bird fauna in this area is still relatively unknown and there are many remnant fragments that have not been systematically surveyed. Here, we report the results of bird surveys in five forest fragments (one pioneer, two ombrophilous and two seasonal. In total, 162 taxa were recorded, 12 of which are endemic to the PCE. The frequency of endangered species was lower than what has been reported in studies from the same area and most of the taxa considered to be at risk of extinction were sub-species of uncertain taxonomic validity. The comparatively low number of endemic/threatened species may be due to the small size of the fragments in the present study - a consequence of the high levels of habitat loss in this region. Analysis of species richness patterns indicates that ombrophilous forest fragments are acting as refuges for those bird species that are most sensitive to environmental degradation.\n\nCLERGY AND CROWN IN PERNAMBUCO CAPITANIA\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nVirgÃ­nia AlmoÃªdo de Assis\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to analyze the relations between the Catholic Church and the Portuguese absolutist state within the scope of the Captaincy of Pernambuco, seeking to reveal the contradictions contained in the bulge of these relations and their repercussion in the colonial daily life.\n\nEpidemiologia e diferenÃ§as regionais da retinopatia diabÃ©tica em Pernambuco, Brasil Epidemiology and regional differences of diabetic retinopathy in Pernambuco, Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPaulo Henrique GonÃ§alves EscariÃ£o\n\n2008-04-01\n\nFull Text Available OBJETIVOS: Avaliar os dados de freqÃ¼Ãªncia e estadiamento da retinopatia diabÃ©tica em Pernambuco, Brasil, comparando a regiÃ£o metropolitana com cidades do interior do estado.

OsÃ³rio\n\n2001-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Objective. To determine the prevalence of anemia in children 6-59 months old in Pernambuco, a state in northeastern Brazil, so as to help guide health and nutrition policies there. Methods. In 1997 a representative sample of 777 young children had their hemoglobin concentration measured. The sampling process was in three stages. First, 18 municipalities were randomly selected to represent the state and its three geographic areas (metropolitan region of Recife, urban interior, and rural interior. Next, using census lists, 45 census sectors were randomly chosen. Finally, 777 children aged 6-59 months old were selected. Blood was collected by venipuncture, and hemoglobin was measured with a portable hemoglobinometer. In the analysis, prevalence was weighted to reflect the census age distribution. Results. The prevalence of anemia among children 6-59 months old was 40.9% for the state as a whole. Prevalence in the metropolitan region of Recife was 39.6%, and it was 35.9% in the urban interior. The rural interior had the highest prevalence, 51.4%. Prevalence was twice as high in children aged 6-23 months as among those 24-59 months old, 61.8% vs. 31.0% (chiÂ² = 77.9, P < 0.001. The mean hemoglobin concentrations in the younger and older age groups were 10.4 g/dL (standard deviation (SD = 1.5 and 11.4 g/dL (SD = 1.4, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the sexes in terms of prevalence. Conclusions. This is the first statewide assessment of anemia prevalence among young children in Brazil.

This study aimed to identify the factors that lead to water quality of the Jucazinho reservoir using a database containing information of nine years of reservoir water quality monitoring in line with a multivariate statistical technique known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA. To use this technique, it was selected two components which determine the quality of the reservoir water. The first principal component, ranging from an annual basis, explained the relationship between the development of cyanobacteria, the concentration of dissolved solids and electrical conductivity, comparing it with the variation in the dam volume, total phosphorus levels and turbidity. The second principal component, ranging from a mensal basis, explained the photosynthetic activity performed by cyanobacteria confronting with the variation in the dam volume. It observed the relationship between water quality parameters with rainfall, featuring an annual and seasonal pattern that can be used as reference to behaviour studies of this reservoir.\n\nSpectral reflectance characteristics of soils in northeastern Brazil as influenced by salinity levels.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPessoa, Luiz Guilherme Medeiros; Freire, Maria BetÃ¢nia GalvÃ£o Dos Santos; Wilcox, Bradford Paul; Green, Colleen Heather Machado; De AraÃºjo, RÃ´mulo JosÃ© TolÃªdo; De AraÃºjo Filho, JosÃ© Coelho\n\n2016-11-01\n\nIn northeastern Brazil, large swaths of once-productive soils have been severely degraded by soil salinization, but the true extent of the damage has not been assessed. Emerging remote sensing technology based on hyperspectral analysis offers one possibility for large-scale assessment, but it has been unclear to what extent the spectral properties of soils are related to salinity characteristics. The purpose of this study was to characterize the spectral properties of degraded (saline) and non-degraded agricultural soils in northeastern Brazil and determine the extent to which these properties correspond to soil salinity. We took soil samples from 78 locations within a 45,000-km 2 site in Pernambuco State. We used cluster analysis to group the soil samples on the basis of similarities in salinity and sodicity levels, and then obtained spectral data for each group. The physical properties analysis indicated a predominance of the coarse sand fraction in almost all the soil groups, and total porosity was similar for all the groups. The chemical analysis revealed different levels of degradation among the groups, ranging from non-degraded to strongly degraded conditions, as defined by the degree of salinity and sodicity. The soil properties showing the highest correlation with spectral reflectance were the exchangeable sodium percentage followed by fine sand. Differences in the reflectance curves for the various soil groups were relatively small and were not significant. These results suggest that, where soil crusts are not present, significant challenges remain for using hyperspectral remote sensing to assess soil salinity in northeastern Brazil.\n\nClorofÃ­ceas marinhas bentÃ´nicas da Praia de Serrambi, Pernambuco, Brasil Benthic marine Chlorophyceae from Serrambi Beach, Pernambuco, Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSÃ´nia Maria Barreto Pereira\n\n1998-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Ã apresentado o levantamento florÃ­stico sobre as clorofÃ­ceas marinhas bentÃ´nicas encontradas na Praia de Serrambi, litoral Sul do Estado de Pernambuco.

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic procedures carried out in nuclear medicine (SMN) in Pernambuco and Alagoas in order to gather data to subsidize the proposal of reference levels for nuclear medicine in Brazil. Data were collected of the SMN in Pernambuco and Alagoas in the period of 2005 to 2009, according by UNSCEAR. The study used data from IBGE. The results showed that the total number of examinations in the period 2005 to 2009 was 34.828 in Pernambuco and 27.700 in Alagoas, corresponding to 6.966 and 5.540 average annual examinations in Pernambuco and Alagoas, respectively. The total number of examinations performed in both states in 2009 was twice the number carried out in 2005. Scintigraphy is the cardiovascular examination most performed in both states, followed by bone scintigraphy. Tc-99m is the radionuclide used most often, followed by I-131. The number of tests using Tc-99m in 2009 doubled when compared with the examinations performed in 2005. The results indicate that there has been a significant increase in the number of examinations in MN, and that females outnumber males, as far as the use of this diagnostic resource is concerned. The study of the activities of the radionuclides administered to patients in the states of Pernambuco and Alagoas showed that they are high when compared to the values recommended by the IAEA in its Safety Report Series Document No. 40.

This huge region is conditioned by the action of process such as, sedimentals, tectonics, geomorphological and climatical, as example, which direct or in conjunction with other ones, since of continental break up between South America and Africa are going on and may be responsible for the current morphology of the margin. In accordance with this point of view, the Oriental part of the Brazilian Continental Margin, presents characteristics of a passive margin and fisiographically ''starved'', in which the continental break occur no more than 100km from de coastline and the sedimentary coverage is mainly carbonatic. The continental slope does not present great extension if compared with other parts of the Brazilian Margin and sharp gradient. The remark presence of the cont"
