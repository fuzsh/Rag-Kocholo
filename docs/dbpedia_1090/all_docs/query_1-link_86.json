        "text": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) for perianal bowenoid papulosis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGahlen, Johannes; Stern, Josef; Graschew, Georgi; Kaus, Michael R.; Tilgen, W.\n\n1995-03-01\n\nHPV associated bowenoid papulosis of the anogenital region are classified as carcinoma in situ. The treatment can be difficult and recurrence rates are high. Extended surgical resections may have complications such as anal sphincter insufficiency. PDT does have some advantages and less side effects in the treatment of these tumors. We treated one female patient with an extended perianal bowenoid papulosis. Previous surgical resection led to local recurrence and partial sphincter insufficiency. Twenty-four hours before local laser light radiation (Ar-Dye laser, 630 nm wavelength), a systemic photosensitizer was applied (Photofrin II, 1.5 mg/kg BW). Four courses of PDT were performed within one year. We observed a total tumor necrosis in every radiation area. The previous sphincter insufficiency improved during the sessions. Side effects were rare. Pain in the radiation was stopped within 2 - 3 days under pain medication. PDT can induce a total local tumor necrosis in perianal bowenoid papulosis. Concerning local expansion, PDT can be a curable treatment.\n\nDermoscopic findings in bowenoid papulosis: report of two cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarcucci, Carolina; Sabban, Emilia Cohen; Friedman, Paula; Peralta, Rosario; Calb, Ignacio; Cabo, Horacio\n\n2014-10-01\n\nBowenoid papulosis (BP) corresponds to an in situ squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) located in the anogenital region. It is related to HPV, and presents with gray-brown elevated papules or plaques. A biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis; however, dermoscopy may be useful to differentiate this disease from other conditions, such as genital warts, seborrheic keratosis and lichen planus. In this paper we describe the dermoscopic findings in two patients with this disease.\n\nDetection of Human Papillomavirus Type 16 DNA and Papillomavirus Genusâspecific Antigens in Vulva and Cervix from Patients with Bowenoid Papulosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSugase, Motoyasu; Moriyama, Shinâichi; Hata, Satoru; Matsukura, Toshihiko\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe warty disordered lesions of the vulva in three female patients were diagnosed as Bowenoid papulosis on the basis of clinical and histopathological findings. In all three vulvar lesions, human Papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) DNA was identified hy Southern blot hybridization and Papillomavirus genusâspecific (PGS) antigen was detected in one case immunohistochemically. Furthermore, colposcopic examination revealed the presence of abnormal uterine cervical lesions in two cases. They were found to be intraepithelial neoplasia which harbored HPV 16 DNA and were positive for PGS antigen.

Mucosal involvement by lymphomatoid papulosis is very rare but has been reported in the literature. It usually appears as ulcers in patients previously diagnosed of lymphomatoid papulosis. From a histological perspective it is characterized by an infiltrate of CD 30 positive atypical lymphocytes together with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate of eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytes and plasma cells. We report the case of a man previously diagnosed of lymphomatoid papulosis that developed two ulcerated lesions in the tongue whose biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of oral involvement by lymphomatoid papulosis.\n\nBowenoid epidermotropic metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nIhm, C W; Park, S L; Sung, S Y; Lee, I S\n\n1996-10-01\n\nEpidermotropic metastatic squamous cell carcinoma produced full-thickness cellular atypia of bowenoid carcinoma in situ or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 3 (VIN 3), in a 73-year-old woman who had past history of uterine cervical carcinoma. The presence of intravascular tumor cell nests and areas showing smooth continuity of the malignant squamous cell nodules with the adjoining benign epidermis supported the possibility of the epidermotropic metastasis. To our knowledge, metastatic epidermotropic squamous carcinoma clinicopathologically simulating primary Bowen's disease has not been reported.\n\nSkin lesion resembling malignant atrophic papulosis in lupus erythematosus.\n\nPubMed\n\nDoutre, M S; Beylot, C; Bioulac, P; Busquet, M; Conte, M\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThis case demonstrates, as do the 3 others reported in literature, that a diagnosis of malignant atrophic papulosis can only be made once the possibility of a lupus erythematosus has been totally excluded.\n\nPerianal Dermatitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAgullÃ³-PÃ©rez, Alfredo-Daniel; Hervella-GarcÃ©s, Marcos; Oscoz-Jaime, Saioa; Azcona-RodrÃ­guez, Maialen; Larrea-GarcÃ­a, MÃ³nica; Yanguas-Bayona, Juan-Ignacio\n\nPerianal complaints are often consulted in dermatology clinics, and in many cases, a conclusive diagnosis is not easily made. The aim of this study was to study and identify the epidemiological, clinical, and contact allergy features of patients with perianal dermatitis who attended at a contact dermatitis unit in a tertiary hospital in Spain. Adult patients with long-lasting (>4 weeks) perianal dermatitis were recruited during the past 10 years for investigation and follow-up. Every patient underwent a diagnostic workup consisting of dermatological exploration and patch tests with the standard and specific series, as well as the patients' own products. General surgical exploration was also performed in some patients. One hundred twenty-four patients were included. The MOAHLFA index was as follows: 43.5, 0, 4.8, 11.3, 1.6, 8.1, and 75. The main final diagnoses were allergic contact dermatitis (32.3%), psoriasis (24.2%), irritant contact dermatitis (17.7%), and lichen simplex (neurodermatitis) (10%). Eighty-one patients (66.1%) showed 1 or more positive reactions, and in 52 patients (43%), positive reactions relevant to the present disease were found. Contact allergy in patients with long-lasting perianal complaints is frequent. It is mandatory for these patients to be referred to a dermatologist for an adequate evaluation and patch testing. Methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone seems as the most common allergen implicated in perianal contact dermatitis.\n\nTraumatic neuroma of the penis after circumcision--Case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nCardoso, ThaÃ­s AbrÃ£o; dos Santos, Karen Regina; Franzotti, Aline Martinez; Avelar, Juliana Centofanti Dentello; Tebcherani, Antonio JosÃ©; Pegas, JosÃ© Roberto Pereira\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTraumatic neuromas are tumors resulting from hyperplasia of axons and nerve sheath cells after section or injury to the nervous tissue. We present a case of this tumor, confirmed by anatomopathological examination, in a male patient with history of circumcision. Knowledge of this entity is very important in achieving the differential diagnosis with other lesions that affect the genital area such as condyloma acuminata, bowenoid papulosis, lichen nitidus, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, achrochordon and pearly penile papules.\n\nPerianal atypical leiomyoma: A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Pingliang; Ou, Hailing; Huang, Shen; Wei, Longxiang; Zhang, Sen; Liu, Jiali; Geng, Shuguang; Yang, Kun\n\n2017-12-01\n\nReports on perianal atypical leiomyoma, a perianal tumor, are rare. We confirmed a perianal atypical leiomyoma by its clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and immunohistochemistry. A 28-year-old female with a perianal mass found more than 4 years ago. The 5cm_4cm_4cm sized mass was located on the left side of the anus and vagina; The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed: A 4.1cmâÃâ5.2cmâÃâ4.9cm sized round mass was observed on the left side of the circumference. Perianal atypical leiomyoma. anal peripheral mass resection was performed under lumbar anesthesia. The postoperative course was uneventful, healing, the patient was discharged. Perianal atypical leiomyomas are benign tumors, but with the clinically atypical leiomyoma, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between potential malignant smooth muscle tumors,and there may be malignant changes. Surgery should ensure complete resection, and to avoid postoperative recurrence, there should be a regular follow-up.\n\nLaparoscopy shows superiority over endoscopy for early detection of malignant atrophic papulosis gastrointestinal complications: a case report and review of literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nToledo, A E; Shapiro, L S; Farrell, J F; Magro, C M; Polito, J\n\n2015-11-02\n\nThe malignant form of atrophic papulosis (KÃ¶hlmeier-Degos disease) is a rare thrombo-occlusive vasculopathy that can affect multiple organ systems. Patients typically present with distinctive skin lesions reflective of vascular drop out. The small bowel is the most common internal organ involved, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality attributable to ischemic microperforations. Determination of the presence of gastrointestinal lesions is critical in distinguishing systemic from the benign, cutaneous only disease and in identifying candidates for treatment. We describe an 18 year old male who first presented with cutaneous atrophic papulosis but became critically ill from small bowel microperforations. He had an almost immediate and dramatic response to treatment. Prior to his presentation with acute abdomen he had upper and lower endoscopy showing areas of nonspecific patchy erythema. At laparotomy, innumerable characteristic lesions with central pearly hue and erythematous border were seen. PubMed was used for a literature search using the keywords malignant atrophic papulosis, Degos disease, endoscopy, laparoscopy and laparotomy. This search yielded 200 articles which were further analyzed for diagnostic procedures and findings. Among the 200 articles we identified only 11 cases in which endoscopy was performed. Results of endoscopy and laparotomy in our patient with malignant atrophic papulosis were compared to those in the literature. Endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract has shown gastritis and non-specific inflammation whereas laparoscopy shows white plaques with red borders on the serosal surface of the small bowel and the peritoneum. From personal communications with other physicians worldwide, we identified three additional unpublished cases in which endoscopy revealed only minimal changes while laparoscopy showed dramatic lesions. From our experience the endoscopic findings are often subtle and nonspecific, whereas laparascopy or laparotomy\n\n[Perianal Bowen's disease treated with imiquimod].\n\nPubMed\n\nAlfaro-Rubio, Alberto; Nagore, Eduardo; Serra, Carlos; Botella, Rafael; SanmartÃ­n, Onofre; Requena, Celia; Llombart, Beatriz; Hueso, Luis; GuillÃ©n, Carlos\n\n2005-09-01\n\nBowen's disease is a special form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ that usually develops in photoexposed areas of skin. The treatment of choice is surgery. Less frequently, it may appear in other locations such as the nails, glans penis, intertriginous areas and the perianal region, where conventional treatment may be complicated. We contribute a new case of perianal Bowen's disease, which responded to treatment with imiquimod with no evidence of clinical recurrence after 3 years of follow up. Imiquimod appears to be a therapeutic alternative for perianal Bowen's disease, which seems to have a particular tendency to recur in this location where surgery may also be complicated.\n\nTreatment of bowenoid and basaloid vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 with imiquimod 5% cream.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarchitelli, Claudia; Secco, Graciela; Perrotta, Myriam; Lugones, Leonor; Pesce, Romina; Testa, Roberto\n\n2004-11-01\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of imiquimod 5% for the treatment of bowenoid and basaloid vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and to evaluate recurrences following treatment. Eight patients <55 years old (range, 32-51; mean, 39.7), with bowenoid or basaloid VIN 2/3 diagnosed by biopsy were treated with imiquimod 5%. Women with other types of intraepithelial neoplasia of the lower genital tract, immunosuppressed women, pregnant women and women with other types of vulvar pathology were excluded. Two patients previously treated for VIN 3 (surgical resection, resection by loop electrosurgical excision procedure) had recurrences. Patients applied imiquimod cream 3 times a week until total clearance of the lesions or up to a maximum of 16 weeks. Responses were categorized as total when there was no colposcopic evidence of a lesion, partial when the lesion area diminished >50% and progressive when there was an increase in the lesion area. A biopsy was performed at the end of treatment. Follow-up was carried out monthly (10-30 months). Total clearance of lesions was observed in 6 patients after 10-16 weeks. Two patients had a partial response (1 with 75% and the other with 50% reduction of the lesions). Posttreatment histopathology showed the absence of precancerous lesions in 7 patients (87.5%). Biopsy was positive for VIN 3 (12.5%) only in the patient showing a clinical response of 50%. Of the 7 patients with biopsies negative for VIN, 2 (25%) were positive for viral infection; 1 gave a negative reading after 2 months after treatment, and the other 1 remained positive for human papillomavirus. The patient with persistent VIN received surgical treatment. The side effects were as follows: erythema in 8 patients (100%), erosions in 1 patient (12.5%) and edema in 1 patient (12.5%). No relapses occurred after treatment during 10-30 months of follow-up. In this initial series, imiquimod proved to be effective for the treatment of bowenoid and basaloid VIN 2/3 in a\n\nPerianal nodular hidradenocarcinoma. Case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nSierra Montenegro, Ernesto; Sierra Luzuriaga, GastÃ³n; Leone Stay, Gaetano; Salazar MenÃ©ndez, Vilma; QuiÃ±onez Auria, Carlos\n\n2010-01-01\n\nEccrine glands (sweat glands) appear in all sites of the skin and are more abundant in hands and feet. Nodular hidradenocarcinoma (NH) is a rare malignant and aggressive tumor of the eccrine glands. The objective of this study is to report a case of perianal hidradenocarcinoma. We present the case of a 75-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. Physical examination revealed a small perianal tumor that was palpated near the anal canal. Biopsy was done. Pathology report revealed perianal hidradenoma. Rectosigmoidoscopy was normal. Computed tomography showed 1-cm adenopathies in inguinal and right iliac regions. Extensive resection of the tumor was done. Definitive pathology report was malignant eccrine acrospiroma. The patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy in the Oncology Service and died 1 month later. In patients with a first symptom of metastases in the inguinal region, suspicion must be directed to the anal canal.\n\nPerianal and periumbilical dermatitis: Report of a woman with group G streptococcal infection and review of perianal and periumbilical dermatoses.\n\nPubMed\n\nKallini, Joseph R; Cohen, Philip R\n\n2013-04-15\n\nWe describe a woman with perianal and periumbilical dermatitis secondary to group G Streptococcus, summarize the salient features of this condition, and review other cutaneous conditions that clinically mimic streptococcal dermatitis of the umbilicus. Periumbilical and perianal streptococcal dermatitis are conditions that commonly occur in children and usually result from beta-hemolytic group A Streptococcus. Rarely, non-group A streptococcal and staphylococcal infections have been reported in adults. A 31-year-old woman developed perianal and periumbilical group G streptococcal dermatitis. Symptoms were present for six months and were refractory to clotrimazole 1 percent and betamethasone dipropionate 0.05 percent cream. The etiology of perianal and periumbilical dermatitis is unclear, but is perhaps explained by virulence of previously asymptomatic colonized bacteria. Perianal streptococcal dermatitis is more common in children. A number of adult infections have been reported, most of which were secondary to group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. Men are more often affected than women. Group G Streptococcus is rarely the infective etiology of perianal streptococcal dermatitis. This condition presents as a superficial well demarcated erythematous patch on clinical examination. Diagnosis is ascertained by diagnostic swabs and serological tests: antistreptolysin O (ASO) or anti-DNase titer. Treatments include oral amoxicillin, penicillin, erythromycin, and mupirocin ointment. Our patient expands on the clinical presentation typical of streptococcal dermatitis. We describe a rare occurrence of an adult woman infected with non-group A Streptococcus. Several conditions can mimic the presentation of perianal streptococcal dermatitis. Although rare, group G Streptococcus should be considered in the setting of virulent infections usually attributed to group A species. Streptococcal dermatitis can be added to the list of conditions affecting the umbilicus.\n\nPerianal sinuses in neonates and infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nAl-Wattar, Kais M\n\n2002-12-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the etiology of perianal abscess or discharges in neonates and infants and some of them are perianal sinuses with blind inner end without connection to the anal canal, and some of these cases have a different histological pattern. Complete surgical excision and primary closure of their wounds can cure these patients. Between January 1988 and December 2000, (81) neonates and infants (aged 2 weeks to 2 years) with perianal sinuses, fistula-in-ano abscess dealt in the Al-Zahrawi and Al-Khansa Teaching Hospitals, Mosul, Iraq, were studied. Fifty-one patients displayed an onset of symptoms during their first year of age, all cases had a gentle probing and proctoscopy under general anesthesia, and the discharge from abscess from the patients were sent for culture. Thirty patients with proper sinuses had excision of the sinus and primary closure; children with fistulae underwent fistulectomy; perianal abscesses drained. All the excised specimens were examined histopathologically. All children, except 3, were boys. Out of the 81 cases studied, 30 patients (37%) proved to have proper sinuses with blind inner end. Eight of these showed a different histological pattern, and in 2 cases, the histopathology was that of rectal duplication, the microbiology of the discharge from the proper sinuses was showing a predominance of non-gut derived organisms. All patients cured by excision of the sinuses and primary closure. Fistulae are the most common perianal discharging lesions in neonates and infants, blind sinuses are another cause in a considerable number. We propose a diagnostic strategy and treatment for those children presenting with discharging perianal lesions; for anticipation of these sinuses 3 points need to be considered before attempting surgery. 1) Blind sinus tract on gentle probing. 2) Normal anal and rectal mucosa on proctoscopy. 3) High bacterial yield of non-gut derived organisms on culture of the pus or discharge. Their\n\nPerianal rhabdomyosarcoma in a dog.\n\nPubMed\n\nUeno, H; Kadosawa, T; Isomura, H; Okada, Y; Ochiai, K; Umemura, T; Okumura, M; Fujinaga, T\n\n2002-05-01\n\nA perianal rhabdomyosarcoma was diagnosed in an 11-year-old neutered male Labrador retriever. Following two incomplete surgical excisions of the tumour, the dog was treated by means of surgery combined with local radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy using one cycle of vincristine sulphate, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (VAC protocol). The dog died 252 days after the first combined therapy. Radiography at this time demonstrated enlargement of the iliac lymph nodes, suggesting metastasis of the tumour. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of treatment of canine perianal rhabdomyosarcoma.\n\nThe impact of perianal disease in young patients with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nZwintscher, Nathan P; Shah, Puja M; Argawal, Amit; Chesley, Patrick M; Johnson, Eric K; Newton, Christopher R; Maykel, Justin A; Steele, Scott R\n\n2015-09-01\n\nPerianal disease is a potentially significant source of morbidity for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We sought to identify the impact of perianal disease on IBD outcomes in children, adolescents, and young adults. We studied 12,465 inpatient admissions for patients â¤20 years old with IBD in 2009 using the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID). Patients were stratified by their principal diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). Perianal disease (perianal abscess, anal fissure, or anal fistula), complex fistulas (rectourethral, rectovaginal, or enterovesical), and growth failure were defined by ICD-9 codes. Logistic regression was performed adjusting for CD or UC, gender, age, need for surgical intervention, fistulas, or growth failure. Of the 511 (4.1%) patients with perianal disease, 480 had CD (94%, pâ<â0.001). Girls were less likely to suffer perianal disease (ORâ=â0.63, CI 0.52-0.76, pâ<â0.001). Those with perianal disease were more likely to suffer complex fistulas (ORâ=â3.5, CI 1.98-6.20, pâ<â0.001) but less likely to suffer enteroenteral fistulas (ORâ=â0.30, CI 0.15-0.63, pâ=â0.001) than those without perianal disease. Perianal disease did not increase the incidence of growth failure (pâ=â0.997) but doubled the likelihood of an operation of any type during admission (pâ<â0.001). Additionally, patients with perianal disease spent on average 1.29 more days in the hospital (7.45 vs. 6.16 days, pâ<â0.001) and accrued $5838 extra in hospital charges (pâ=â0.005). Perianal disease in younger patients is associated with a longer length of stay, higher hospital charges, and increased rates of both perineal and abdominal operative procedures. These data support the notion that, similar to adults, the presence of perianal disease in pediatric Crohn's patients is associated with a more severe course.\n\nThe impact of mode of delivery on outcomes in patients with perianal Crohn's disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCheng, Alice G; Oxford, Emily C; Sauk, Jenny; Nguyen, Deanna D; Yajnik, Vijay; Friedman, Sonia; Ananthakrishnan, Ashwin N\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIntroduction Crohn's disease (CD) often affects women during the reproductive years. While several studies have examined the impact of pregnancy on luminal disease, limited literature exists in those with perianal CD. Decision regarding mode of delivery is a unique challenge in such patients due to concerns regarding the effect of pelvic floor trauma during delivery on pre-existing perianal involvement. Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of CD patients with established perianal disease undergoing either vaginal delivery or Caesarean section (C-section) at our institutions. We examined the occurrence of symptomatic perianal disease flares within 5 years after delivery in such women compared to non-pregnant CD controls. We also compared the occurrence of such flares between the two modes of delivery in women with established perianal CD. Results We identified 61 pregnant CD patients with established perianal disease (11 vaginal delivery, 50 via C-section) and 61 non-pregnant CD controls with perianal disease. One-third of the C-sections were primarily for obstetric indications. Six of the vaginal deliveries were complicated. Approximately 36% of cases had a symptomatic perianal flare within 1 year after delivery. This was similar across both modes of delivery (p=0.53), and similar to non-pregnant CD patients. There was no difference in the rates of perianal surgical intervention or luminal disease flares in our population based on mode of delivery, or between pregnant CD patients and non-pregnant CD controls. Conclusion We observed no difference in risk of symptomatic perianal flares in patients with established perianal CD delivering vaginally or via C-section.

The infant had suffered from perianal abscesses from 3Â weeks after birth. The abscesses repeatedly developed and spontaneously drained through the orifice. Twenty-seven days before admission, a live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) was given to the infant for the first time for routine immunization. His body temperature rose to 38Â°C 19Â days after receiving the OPV and fell 4Â days later. Flaccid paralysis of the right leg appeared 26Â days after receipt of the OPV. A Sabin type 3 poliovirus was isolated from a stool obtained at admission. The DNA sequences of the VP1 region of the isolated virus were more than 99% identical with those of the vaccine strain. Mild muscle atrophy with moderate motor impairment in the right leg persisted at 18Â months of age. One VAPP case provoked by a perianal abscess has been reported from the United Kingdom. Database search revealed that one of nine VAPP cases reported during 2003-2008 in Japan had a perianal abscess. Taken together, these reports and our case imply that we should give OPV with caution to infants with a perianal abscess.\n\nRecent developments in the surgical management of perianal fistula for Crohnâs disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGeltzeiler, Cristina B.; Wieghard, Nicole; Tsikitis, Vassiliki L.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPerianal manifestations of Crohnâs disease (CD) are common and, of them, fistulas are the most common. Perianal fistulas can be extremely debilitating for patients and are often very challenging for clinicians to treat. CD perianal fistulas usually require multidisciplinary and multimodality treatment, including both medical and surgical approaches. The majority of patients require multiple surgical interventions. CD patients with perianal fistulas have a high rate of primary non-healing, surgical morbidity, and high recurrence rates. This has led to constant efforts to improve surgical management of this disease process.

We aimed to evaluate small bowel involvement and compare small bowel capsule endoscopy findings and inflammatory activity between patients with and without perianal disease. Retrospective single-center study including 71 patients - all patients with perianal CD (17 patients) who performed a small bowel capsule endoscopy were included, and non-perianal CD patients were randomly selected (54 patients). Clinical and analytical variables at diagnosis were reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v21.0 and a two-tailed p value <.05 was defined as indicating statistical significance. Patients had a median age of 30âÂ±â16 years with 52.1% females. Perianal disease was present in 23.9%. Patients with perianal disease had significantly more relevant findings (94.1% vs 66.6%, pâ=â.03) and erosions (70.6% vs 42.6%, pâ=â.04), however, no differences were found between the two groups regarding ulcer, villous edema and stenosis detection. Overall, patients with perianal disease had more frequently significant small bowel inflammatory activity, defined as a Lewis Scoreââ¥135 (94.1% vs 64.8%, pâ=â.03), and higher Lewis scores in the first and second tertiles (450âÂ±â1129 vs 0âÂ±â169, pâ=â.02 and 675âÂ±â1941 vs 0âÂ±â478, pâ=â.04, respectively). No differences were found between the two groups regarding third tertile inflammatory activity assessed with the Lewis Score. Patients with perianal CD have significantly higher inflammatory activity in the small bowel, particularly in proximal small bowel segments, when compared with patients without perianal disease.\n\nA link between perianal strep and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS).\n\nPubMed\n\nToufexis, Megan; Deoleo, Caroline; Elia, Josephine; Murphy, Tanya K\n\n2014-04-01\n\nPerianal streptococcal dermatitis is an infection caused by group A streptococcus (GAS). Children with a pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) phenotype may have tics or obsessive compulsive symptoms secondary to a systemic immune activation by GAS infecting perianal areas. In this retrospective case series, the authors describe three children with symptoms consistent with PANDAS and a confirmed perianal streptococcal dermatitis as the likely infectious trigger. Concomitant perianal dermatitis and new-onset obsessive-compulsive symptoms and/or tics are strong indications for perianal culture and rapid antigen detection test in young children.\n\nCyclosporine and ketoconazole for the treatment of perianal fistulas in dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nPatricelli, Alison J; Hardie, Robert J; McAnulty, Jonathan E\n\n2002-04-01\n\nTo evaluate efficacy and cost of using cyclosporine and ketoconazole for the treatment of perianal fistulas in dogs. Clinical trial. 12 dogs with perianal fistulas. Dogs received cyclosporine and ketoconazole orally (target whole blood trough cyclosporine concentrations of 400 to 600 ng/ml). Study endpoints were resolution of clinical signs, remission, and recurrence of disease. Adverse effects and cost of medications were reported. Results were compared with those from previous studies in humans and in dogs in which single agent cyclosporine treatment for perianal fistulas was used. All dogs had resolution of clinical signs. Eight dogs went into remission; however, 5 of those 8 had recurrence of fistulas. Adverse effects of treatment were minimal and well tolerated. Cost of treatment was comparable to traditional surgical options and less than single agent cyclosporine treatment. Administration of cyclosporine with ketoconazole is an effective and cost-comparable treatment for perianal fistulas in dogs.\n\nMedical and surgical management of perianal Crohnâs disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAdegbola, Samuel O.; Pisani, Anthea; Sahnan, Kapil; Tozer, Phil; Ellul, Pierre; Warusavitarne, Janindra\n\n2018-01-01\n\nCrohnâs disease is increasingly thought to encompass multiple possible phenotypes. Perianal manifestations account for one such phenotype and represent an independent disease modifier. In its more severe form, perianal Crohnâs disease confers a higher risk of a severe and disabling disease course, relapses, hospital admissions and operations. This, in turn, imposes a considerable burden and disability on patients. Identification of the precise manifestation is important, as management is nuanced, with both medical and surgical components, and is best undertaken in a multidisciplinary setting for both diagnosis and ongoing treatment. The introduction of biologic medication has heralded a significant addition to the management of fistulizing perianal Crohnâs disease in particular, albeit with modest results. It remains a very challenging condition to treat and further work is required to optimize management in this group of patients.

Published studies have subsequently confirmed that perianal fistulas are the most common manifestations of fistulising Crohn disease. Hidradenitis suppurativa was described in 1854 by a French surgeon, Aristide Verneuil. It is a chronic, inflammatory, recurrent and debilitating disease of the pilosebaceous follicle, that usually manifests after puberty with deep, painful and inflamed lesions in the areas of the body with apocrine glands, usually the axillary, inguinal and anogenital regions. The differential diagnosis between hidradenitis suppurativa and Crohn disease can be challenging, especially when the disease is primarily perianal. When they occur simultaneously, hidradenitis suppurativa and Crohn disease show severe phenotypes and patients can respond to anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy, although adalimumab is currently the only treatment with demonstrated efficacy in hidradenitis suppurativa and Crohn disease. In addition, there is sometimes a need for different complementary surgical procedures. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U. y AEDV.

Although metastatic ALCL generally carries the same clone as the primary lymphoma, expression of a distinct clone likely represents a distinct process. Observations A 54-year-old white man had a history of anaplastic lymphoma kinase 1ânegative ALCL in the right inguinal lymph node 6 years ago. A complete response was achieved after 6 cycles of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine [Oncovin], and prednisone administered in 21-day cycles) and radiation therapy. After 3Â½ years, the patient observed waxing and waning papules and nodules. Examination of the biopsy specimen revealed a dense CD30+ lymphocytic infiltrate; no evidence of systemic malignancy was evident on positron emission tomography. Although clinically the presentation was consistent with lymphomatoid papulosis, metastatic ALCL had to be excluded. Polymerase chain reaction analysis with T-cell receptor Î³-chain gene rearrangement (TCR-Î³R) was performed on the original lymph node and new skin lesions. Results of the TCR-Î³R analysis were positive for clonality in both lesions. However, separate clonal processes were identified. The identification of distinct clones supported the clinical impression of lymphomatoid papulosis. Conclusion Polymerase chain reaction analysis of TCR-Î³R is a useful method for distinguishing different clonal processes and is recommended when differentiation of primary and secondary lymphoproliferative disorders is required.

Recurrent perianal inflammation has great etiologic diversity. A possible cause is cow's milk allergy (CMA). The aim was to assess the magnitude of this cause. Subjects and Methods. This follow up clinical study was carried out on 63 infants with perianal dermatitis of more than 3 weeks with history of recurrence. Definitive diagnosis was made for each infant through medical history taking, clinical examination and investigations including stool analysis and culture, stool pH and reducing substances, perianal swab for different cultures and staining for Candida albicans. Complete blood count and quantitative determination of cow's milk-specific serum IgE concentration were done for all patients. CMA was confirmed through an open withdrawal-rechallenge procedure. Serum immunoglobulins and CD markers as well as gastrointestinal endoscopies were done for some patients. Results. Causes of perianal dermatitis included CMA (47.6%), bacterial dermatitis (17.46%), moniliasis (15.87%), enterobiasis (9.52%) and lactose intolerance (9.5%). Predictors of CMA included presence of bloody and/or mucoid stool, other atopic manifestations, anal fissures, or recurrent vomiting. Conclusion. We can conclude that cow's milk allergy is a common cause of recurrent perianal dermatitis. Mucoid or bloody stool, anal fissures or ulcers, vomiting and atopic manifestations can predict this etiology.\n\nInnovation in the imaging perianal fistula: a step towards personalised medicine\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSahnan, Kapil; Adegbola, Samuel O.; Tozer, Philip J.; Patel, Uday; Ilangovan, Rajpandian; Warusavitarne, Janindra; Faiz, Omar D.; Hart, Ailsa L.; Phillips, Robin K. S.; Lung, Phillip F. C.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground: Perianal fistula is a topic both hard to understand and to teach. The key to understanding the treatment options and the likely success is deciphering the exact morphology of the tract(s) and the amount of sphincter involved. Our aim was to explore alternative platforms better to understand complex perianal fistulas through three-dimensional (3D) imaging and reconstruction. Methods: Digital imaging and communications in medicine images of spectral attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences were imported onto validated open-source segmentation software. A specialist consultant gastrointestinal radiologist performed segmentation of the fistula, internal and external sphincter. Segmented files were exported as stereolithography files. Cura (Ultimaker Cura 3.0.4) was used to prepare the files for printing on an Ultimaker 3 Extended 3D printer. Animations were created in collaboration with Touch Surgeryâ¢. Results: Three examples of 3D printed models demonstrating complex perianal fistula were created. The anatomical components are displayed in different colours: red: fistula tract; green: external anal sphincter and levator plate; blue: internal anal sphincter and rectum. One of the models was created to be split in half, to display the internal opening and allow complexity in the intersphincteric space to better evaluated. An animation of MRI fistulography of a trans-sphincteric fistula tract with a cephalad extension in the intersphincteric space was also created. Conclusion: MRI is the reference standard for assessment of perianal fistula, defining anatomy and guiding surgery. However, communication of findings between radiologist and surgeon remains challenging. Feasibility of 3D reconstructions of complex perianal fistula is realized, with the potential to improve surgical planning, communication with patients, and augment training.

This report presents two examples of a hitherto undescribed subtype of peri-anal adenocarcinoma with an intestinal phenotype. A 74-year-old man had a peri-anal tumour locally excised, whereas a 73-year-old female underwent an abdominoperineal resection for peri-anal Paget's disease with an underlying carcinoma. Neither patient had a history of perineal fistulae, Crohn's disease or previous gastrointestinal neoplasia, and neither showed clinical, radiological or endoscopic evidence of another abdominal or pelvic tumour. Both resection specimens contained adenocarcinoma, which were similar in demonstrating an intestinal morphology and CDX2 immunopositivity. The man has shown a disease-free outcome thus far, but the woman has suffered with nodal and pelvic recurrence within a few months of surgery. The name 'primary peri-anal adenocarcinoma of intestinal type' is proposed for this previously unrecognised subtype of perineal neoplasia. Awareness of its distinct existence - by recognising its intestinal morphology and immunophenotype while excluding metastasis from the intestinal tract - should help to collate data to determine its specific prognosis and to formulate its best management.

We evaluated 300 rat and 200 mouse perianal impressions over 9 wk. Pinworm-positive perianal tape impressions from animals with worm burdens at necropsy were considered as true positives. Conversely, pinworm-negative perianal tape impressions from animals with worm burdens were considered false negatives. The sensitivity of perianal tape impressions for detecting Syphacia muris infections in rats was 100%, and for detecting Syphacia obvelata in mice was 85.5%. Intermittent shedding of Syphacia obvelata ova is the most probable explanation for the decreased sensitivity rate we observed in mice. We urge caution in use of perianal tape impressions alone for Syphacia spp. screening in sentinel mice and rats.\n\nRole of magnetic resonance imaging in the management of perianal Crohn's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nGallego, Jose C; Echarri, Ana\n\n2018-02-01\n\nPerianal fistulas are a major problem in many patients with Crohn's disease. These are usually complex fistulas that adversely affect patients' quality of life, and their clinical management is difficult. Medical treatment sometimes achieves cessation of discharge and closure of the external opening; however, it is difficult to assess the status of the rest of the fistula tract. Magnetic resonance imaging is the method of choice with which to evaluate the condition of perianal fistulas and allows for assessment of the status of inaccessible areas. Magnetic resonance imaging also allows the clinician to evaluate other perianal manifestations of Crohn's disease that differ from the fistulas. This imaging technique is therefore a fundamental means of patient monitoring. When used in conjunction with assessment of the patient's morphological findings, it provides information that allows for both quantification of disease severity and evaluation of the response to treatment. New types of magnetic resonance sequences are emerging, such as diffusion, perfusion, and magnetisation transfer. These sequences may serve as biomarkers because they provide information reflecting the changes taking place at the molecular level. This will help to shape a new scenario in the early assessment of the response to treatments such as anti-tumour necrosis factor drugs. â¢ MRI is the method of choice with which to evaluate perianal fistulas. â¢ In perianal Crohn's disease, MRI is a fundamental means of patient monitoring. â¢ The usefulness of the Van Assche score for patient monitoring remains unclear. â¢ New MRI sequences' diffusion, perfusion, and magnetisation transfer may serve as biomarkers.\n\nNegative pressure wound therapy combined with skin grafting improves surgical wound healing in the perianal area.\n\nPubMed\n\nJia-Zi, Shi; Xiao, Zhai; Jun-Hui, Li; Chun-Yu, Xue; Hong-da, Bi\n\n2016-08-01\n\nManagement of large tissue defects resulting from local wide resection of perianal is a clinical challenge for surgeons. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) following skin grafting on perianal surgical wound healing.Included in this study were 12 patients with perianal tumors who received skin grafting after perianal tumor resection between December 2012 and December 2014. A self-designed negative pressure drainage device was then applied to maintain a standard negative pressure at -150âmm Hg and removed on day 8 postoperation. The outcome was recorded immediately after NPWT and at 6-month follow-up.All skin grafts survived without infection, hematoma, and necrosis in all 12 patients. No tumor recurrence was detected during 6-month follow-up. Natural folds were observed around the anus. All patients showed normal bowel movements.NPWT following skin grafting was effective for perianal surgical wound healing and infection prevention, thus benefiting anatomical and functional recovery of the anus.\n\nTreatment of peri-anal fistula in Crohn's disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSica, Giuseppe S; Di Carlo, Sara; Tema, Giorgia; Montagnese, Fabrizio; Del Vecchio Blanco, Giovanna; Fiaschetti, Valeria; Maggi, Giulia; Biancone, Livia\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAnal fistulas are a common manifestation of Crohnâs disease (CD). The first manifestation of the disease is often in the peri-anal region, which can occur years before a diagnosis, particularly in CD affecting the colon and rectum. The treatment of peri-anal fistulas is difficult and always multidisciplinary. The European guidelines recommend combined surgical and medical treatment with biologic drugs to achieve best results. Several different surgical techniques are currently employed. However, at the moment, none of these techniques appear superior to the others in terms of healing rate. Surgery is always indicated to treat symptomatic, simple, low intersphincteric fistulas refractory to medical therapy and those causing disabling symptoms. Utmost attention should be paid to correcting the balance between eradication of the fistula and the preservation of fecal continence.

Upon further examination, another ulcer of the rectum was detected. Anorectal malignancies, viral infections or primary inflammatory bowel disease were not found. It could be demonstrated that the ulcers were induced by paracetamol and codeine suppositories. After discontinuation of these suppositories, the perianal ulcers healed almost completely within 3 weeks. The pathogenesis of paracetamol-induced ulcers is unknown. However, dose-dependent vasoconstriction is a possible explanation.\n\nHigh Risk of Anal and Rectal Cancer in Patients With Anal and/or Perianal Crohn's Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeaugerie, Laurent; Carrat, Fabrice; Nahon, StÃ©phane; Zeitoun, Jean-David; SabatÃ©, Jean-Marc; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Colombel, Jean-FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Allez, Matthieu; FlÃ©jou, Jean-FranÃ§ois; Kirchgesner, Julien; Svrcek, Magali\n\n2018-06-01\n\nLittle is known about the magnitude of the risk of anal and rectal cancer in patients with anal and/or perineal Crohn's disease. We aimed to assess the risk of anal and rectal cancer in patients with Crohn's perianal disease followed up in the Cancers Et Surrisque AssociÃ© aux Maladies Inflammatoires Intestinales En France (CESAME) cohort. We collected data from 19,486 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) enrolled in the observational CESAME study in France, from May 2004 through June 2005; 14.9% of participants had past or current anal and/or perianal Crohn's disease. Subjects were followed up for a median time of 35 months (interquartile range, 29-40 mo). To identify risk factors for anal cancer in the total CESAME population, we performed a case-control study in which participants were matched for age and sex. Among the total IBD population, 8 patients developed anal cancer and 14 patients developed rectal cancer. In the subgroup of 2911 patients with past or current anal and/or perianal Crohn's lesions at cohort entry, 2 developed anal squamous-cell carcinoma, 3 developed perianal fistula-related adenocarcinoma, and 6 developed rectal cancer. The corresponding incidence rates were 0.26 per 1000 patient-years for anal squamous-cell carcinoma, 0.38 per 1000 patient-years for perianal fistula-related adenocarcinoma, and 0.77 per 1000 patient-years for rectal cancer. Among the 16,575 patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease without anal or perianal lesions, the incidence rate of anal cancer was 0.08 per 1000 patient-years and of rectal cancer was 0.21 per 1000 patient-years. Among factors tested by univariate conditional regression (IBD subtype, disease duration, exposure to immune-suppressive therapy, presence of past or current anal and/or perianal lesions), the presence of past or current anal and/or perianal lesions at cohort entry was the only factor significantly associated with development of anal cancer (odds ratio, 11.2; 95% CI, 1\n\nAssessing the activity of perianal Crohn's disease: comparison of clinical indices and computer-assisted anal ultrasound.\n\nPubMed\n\nLosco, Alessandra; ViganÃ², Chiara; Conte, Dario; Cesana, Bruno Mario; Basilisco, Guido\n\n2009-05-01\n\nAssessing perianal disease activity is important for the treatment and prognosis of Crohn's disease (CD) patients, but the diagnostic accuracy of the activity indices has not yet been established. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy and agreement of the Fistula Drainage Assessment (FDA), Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI), and computer-assisted anal ultrasound imaging (AUS). Sixty-two consecutive patients with CD and perianal fistulae underwent clinical, FDA, PDAI, and AUS evaluation. Perianal disease was considered active in the presence of visible fistula drainage and/or signs of local inflammation (induration and pain at digital compression) upon clinical examination. The AUS images were analyzed by calculating the mean gray-scale tone of the lesion. The PDAI and gray-scale tone values discriminating active and inactive perianal disease were defined using receiver operating characteristics statistics. Perianal disease was active in 46 patients. The accuracy of the FDA was 87% (confidence interval [CI]: 76%-94%). A PDAI of >4 and a mean gray-scale tone value of 117 maximized sensitivity and specificity; their diagnostic accuracy was, respectively, 87% (CI: 76%-94%) and 81% (CI: 69%-90%). The agreement of the 3 evaluations was fair to moderate. The addition of AUS to the PDAI or FDA increased their diagnostic accuracy to respectively 95% and 98%. The diagnostic accuracy of the FDA, PDAI, and computer-assisted AUS imaging was good in assessing perianal disease activity in patients with CD. The agreement between the techniques was fair to moderate. Overall accuracy can be increased by combining the FDA or PDAI with AUS.\n\nPerianal pain as a presentation of lumbosacral neurofibroma: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoghaddasi, Mehdi; Aghaii, Mahboubeh; Mamarabadi, Mansoureh\n\n2014-12-01\n\nRectal and perianal pain is a common problem.

We describe 3 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia having sepsis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in febrile neutropenia and severe perianal infections treated relatively early with a protective colostomy. Indications for colostomy were nonhealing wounds, and ceaseless pain. All patients showed a rapid reduction of pain. Complete wound healing was seen in 2 patients, and considerable pain reduction and increased quality of life were seen in a third patient during palliative care. These results suggest that a protective colostomy should be considered early in the management of immunocompromised children with ecthyma gangrenosum.\n\nTransperineal ultrasonography in perianal Crohn disease: A valuable imaging modality.\n\nPubMed\n\nWright, Emily K; Novak, Kerri L; Lu, Cathy; Panaccione, Remo; Ghosh, Subrata; Wilson, Stephanie R\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAims of treatment for Crohn disease have moved beyond the resolution of clinical symptoms to objective end points including endoscopic and radiological normality. Regular re-evaluation of disease status to safely, readily and reliably detect the presence of inflammation and complications is paramount. Improvements in sonographic technology over recent years have facilitated a growing enthusiasm among radiologists and gastroenterologists in the use of ultrasound for the assessment of inflammatory bowel disease. Transabdominal intestinal ultrasound is accurate, affordable and safe for the assessment of luminal inflammation and complications in Crohn disease, and can be performed with or without the use of intravenous contrast enhancement. Perianal fistulizing disease is a common, complex and often treatment-refractory complication of Crohn disease, which requires regular radiological monitoring. Endoanal ultrasound is invasive, uncomfortable and yields limited assessment of the perineal region. Although magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis is established, timely access may be a problem. Transperineal ultrasound has been described in small studies, and is an accurate, painless and cost-effective method for documenting perianal fluid collections, fistulas and sinus tracts. In the present article, the authors review the literature regarding perineal ultrasound for the assessment of perianal Crohn disease and use case examples to illustrate its clinical utility.\n\nManagement of acute perianal sepsis in neutropenic patients with hematological malignancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaker, B; Al-Salman, M; Daoud, F\n\n2014-04-01\n\nIn neutropenic patients with acute perianal sepsis in the setting of hematological malignancy, the classical clinical features of abscess formation are lacking. Additionally, the role of surgical intervention is not well established. In this review, we discuss the challenges and controversy regarding diagnosis and optimal management when clear surgical guidelines are absent. In the literature, there is great diversity in the surgical approach to these patients, which leads to a high percentage of diagnostic errors, risks of complications, and unnecessary interventions. We review the literature and assess whether surgical intervention produces better outcomes than a non-surgical approach. Studies published on perianal sepsis in neutropenic cancer patients were identified by searching PubMed using the following key words: \"perianal sepsis/abscesses, anorectal sepsis/abscess, neutropenia, hematological malignancy, cancer\". No randomized or prospective studies on the management of acute perianal sepsis in hematological malignancies were found. The largest retrospective study and most comprehensive clinical data demonstrated that 42% of patients were treated successfully without surgical intervention and without morbidity or mortality related to treatment chosen. Small retrospective studies advocated surgical intervention, while the majority of successes were in a non-operative treatment. It is difficult to formulate a conclusion given the small retrospective series on management of neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies. While there is no evidence mandating a routine surgical approach in this category of patients, non-surgical management including careful follow-up to determine whether the patient's condition is deteriorating or treatment has failed is an acceptable approach in selected patients without pathognomonic features of abscess.

Prospective clinical trial Sixteen dogs with clinical evidence of perianal fistulas were given ketoconazole (10 mg/kg once daily) and cyclosporin (1 mg/kg twice daily initially) for 16 weeks. Blood cyclosporin assays were performed regularly and cyclosporin doses were altered to achieve a stable blood level above 200 ng/mL. Regular examinations assessed the dogs' general health, changes in clinical behaviour, fistula size and number. A complete blood count and serum biochemical analysis was performed in all dogs before and after the treatment period, and after 8 weeks of treatment in 12 dogs. Dogs were assessed for recurrence of lesions at 1, 3 and 12 months after the trial. All dogs showed marked improvement in lesions and behaviour within 14 days of the medication. Fourteen dogs completed the trial. Two dogs were excluded due to concurrent disease. Thirteen dogs (93%) showed complete resolution of fistulas during the treatment period. Seven dogs (50%) had no recurrence after 12 months. Recurrence was seen in three dogs (21%) at 8, 10 and 12 months after treatment, and in three dogs (21%) within 1 month of treatment. The medication was well tolerated. Side effects included transient anorexia, vomiting and lethargy in some dogs, increased shedding of hair and gingival hyperplasia. Ketoconazole administration allowed a dramatic reduction in cyclosporin dose (over 90% in 12 dogs and 80% in the other two) compared to previously reported cases treated with cyclosporin alone. The use of combined ketoconazole and cyclosporin provided an effective treatment for perianal fistulas. Outcomes were similar to those seen with cyclosporin alone, but allowed a significant reduction in cyclosporin dose and, therefore, cost.

Sensitivity values for MRI, transrectal sonography, and transperineal sonography for diagnosis of fistulas were 84.6%, 84.6%, and 100%, respectively. Transperineal sonography was more sensitive for diagnosis of perianal abscesses than MRI and transrectal sonography (100%, 58.8%, and 92.8%). Transperineal sonography is a very accurate diagnostic method with outstanding sensitivity compared with MRI and transrectal sonography for evaluation of complicated perianal Crohn disease. Due to its simplicity and low cost, it is recommended that transperineal sonography be the first diagnostic modality in these cases.

The patient was admitted to our hospital with a persistent perianal abscess that was refractory to antibiotic therapy administered at another hospital. On admission, we observed a giant ulcer in the perianal region. At first, cytomegalovirus colitis was suspected by blood investigations. Ganciclovir therapy was initiated; however, the patient developed necrosis of the skin around the anus during therapy. We only performed end-sigmoidostomy and necrotomy to avoid excessive surgical invasion. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed the presence of trophozoite amoebae, indicating a final diagnosis of acute fulminant amoebic colitis. The patient's postoperative course was favorable, and proctectomy of the residual rectum was performed 11 mo later. Amoebic colitis is one of the most severe complications affecting patients with AIDS. Particularly, acute fulminant amoebic colitis may result in a poor prognosis; therefore, staged surgical therapy as a less invasive procedure should be considered as one of the treatment options for these patients.\n\nFrequency and Risk Factors for Associated Lymphomas in Patients With Lymphomatoid Papulosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTressiÃ¨res, BenoÃ®t; DâIncan, Michel; Machet, Laurent; Grange, Florent; EstÃ¨ve, Ãric; Dalac, Sophie; Ingen-Housz-Oro, Saskia; Bagot, Martine; Beylot-Barry, Marie; Joly, Pascal\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground. Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is classified as an indolent cutaneous lymphoma, but outcome dramatically worsens if LyP is associated with lymphoma. The frequency of this association remains unclear in the literature. Here, we assess the frequency and risk factors of association between LyP and another lymphoma in an 11-year retrospective study conducted in 8 dermatology departments belonging to the French Study Group on Cutaneous Lymphoma (FSGCL). Patients and Methods. Patients with LyP were identified and data extracted from the FSGCL registry between 1991 and 2006. Patients were followed up to January 2014. Age, sex, number of skin lesions, histologic subtype, and genotype were recorded at baseline. Risk factors were determined using univariate and multivariate analysis. Cumulative probability of association was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results. We observed 52 cases of lymphomas (cutaneous, n = 38; systemic, n = 14) in 44 of 106 patients (41%). Lymphoma diagnosis was concomitant with or prior to LyP diagnosis in 31 cases and occurred during the course of LyP in 21 cases (cutaneous, n = 14; systemic, n = 7; median delay: 5 years; interquartile range: 1.5â7 years). In multivariate analysis, main prognostic factors for association between LyP and another lymphoma were older age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.05 per year; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01â1.08; p = .011) and presence of a T-cell clone in LyP lesions (OR: 7.55; 95% CI: 2.18â26.18; p = .001). Conclusion. Older age and presence of a T-cell clone in LyP lesions are risk factors for associated lymphomas in patients with LyP. These findings should help to identify patients who require close management in clinical practice. Implications for Practice: The management of lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is that of an indolent cutaneous lymphoma, based on its excellent prognosis. However, this good prognosis is altered if LyP is associated with lymphoma. Furthermore, risk factors for and\n\nNon perianal fistulas in Crohn's disease and short bowel syndrome: what we can do?\n\nPubMed\n\nZildzic, Muharem; Alibegovic, Ervin\n\n2009-01-01\n\nCrohn's disease (CD) is a lifelong disease arising from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors, but seen predominantly in the developed countries of the world. The precise etiology is unknown and therefore a causal treatment is not yet available. Fistulating Crohn's disease includes fistulas arising in the perianal area, together with those communicating between the intestine and other organs or the abdominal wall. Non perianal fistulas include fistulas communicating with other viscera (urinary bladder, vagina), loops of intestine (enteroenteral fistulas) or the abdominal wall (enterocutaneus fistulas). The diagnostic approach is a crucial aspect in the management of fistulating CD as the findings influence the therapeutic strategy. Short bowel syndrome caused by extensive bowel resection should be initially treated with nutritional support and can caused serious treatment and reevaluating problems. We review this uncommon manifestation in a high risk patient after multiple operations and severely shortened bowel and also with non perianal fistulating CD.\n\nAlveolar soft part sarcoma causing perianal abscess.\n\nPubMed\n\nSullivan, Niall; McCulloch, Tom; Leverton, David\n\n2011-07-01\n\nA 34-year-old woman presented with a perianal abscess that communicated with the vagina. There was a background of a one-year history of a conservatively treated, traumatic, paravaginal haematoma. Histology of the fistula tract showed alveolar soft part sarcoma and subsequent imaging identified a large soft tissue mass in the pelvis with lung metastases. Alveolar soft part sarcoma is a rare soft tissue sarcoma of unknown cellular origin affecting predominantly young women, often in deep soft tissues and lower extremities.\n\nLymphomatoid papulosis with pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia in a 7-year-old girl: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nXiong, Jingshu; Ma, Yiping; Chen, Hao; Xu, Xiulian; Sun, Jianfang\n\n2016-05-01\n\nLymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) belongs to the group of cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders. Pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia has rarely been reported in patients with LyP. In this report, we describe a case of LyP presenting as pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia. The patient was a 7-year-old girl who presented with a recurrent papulonodular eruption on her face and trunk for 2âmonths. Histopathologic examination revealed an irregular growth of hyperkeratotic epidermis into the whole dermal layer with marked nests of squamous cells in the background of diffuse atypical lymphoid cells, eosinophils and neutrophils. The large atypical cells were positive for CD30 and CD3, but negative for CD4, CD5, CD8, CD20 and CD56. A TCR-Î³ clone was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The correct diagnosis in cases of LyP with overlying pseudocarcinomatous epithelial hyperplasia can be very difficult both clinically and histopathologically. Clinical and histopathologic characteristics should be integrated to avoid an erroneous diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma or keratoacanthoma. Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

A total of 31 consecutive patients with anal-rectal problems underwent prostate needle biopsy. Of these, 17 were referred to our hospital after vain attempts to insert a transrectal ultrasound probe. Patients received a perianal-pericapsular injection of 1% lidocaine. Pain perception was separately assessed for probe insertion and biopsies using a visual pain analog score. Only in 1 patient were we unable to insert the transrectal ultrasound probe. The mean patient age was 65.28 +/- 5.35 years. We performed a mean of 12.25 biopsies per case. At probe insertion, the mean pain score was 2.2 +/- 0.83. During the biopsy punctures, the mean pain level was 2.53 +/- 1.054. We did not find any increase in the complication rate related to the anesthesia method. Modified perianal anesthesia can be used for transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate in patients with anal-rectal problems, because it provides significant pain relief.\n\nEnhancement of Wound Healing by the Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbal Mixture Sophora flavescens in a Rat Model of Perianal Ulceration\n\nPubMed Central\n\nXU, XIAOPING; LI, XIAOHUA; ZHANG, LEI; LIU, ZHAOHUI; PAN, YUAN; CHEN, DONG; BIN, DONGHUA; DENG, QUN; SUN, YU; HOFFMAN, M. ROBERT; YANG, ZHIJIAN; YUAN, HONG\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground/Aim: Hemorrhoidectomy is often associated with significant postoperative complications that may result in slow wound healing. The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) compound Sophora flavescens (CSF) has shown efficacy on many inflammatory disorders. The aim of the present study was to examine the efficacy of CSF on wound healing in a rat model of perianal ulceration. Materials and Methods: A rat model of perianal ulceration was induced by subcutaneous injection of 75% glacial acetic acid. The animals with induced perianal ulcer received topical treatment of low, medium, and high doses of CFS twice daily. Potassium permanganate (PP); 0.02%) was given to the animals for comparison. Macroscopic and histological assessments of the ulcerated area were performed after treatment. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) was detected by immunohistochemical analysis. Results: Topical administration of medium- and high-dose CSF significantly enhanced perianal ulcer healing as compared to the untreated control (p<0.05). The macroscopic ulceration score was significantly reduced only in the high-dose CSF-treated group as compared to the control (p<0.01). All doses of CSF and PP ameliorated histological damages in the rats with induced perianal ulceration. High-dose CSF or PP significantly reduced the expression of PGE2 and IL-8 as compared to the control (p<0.01). No treatment-related toxicity was found in either the CSF- or the PP-treated mice. Conclusion: CSF enhances wound healing in a rat model of perianal ulceration. The inhibitory effect of CSF on pro-inflammatory cytokines PGE2 and IL-8 may be involved in the mechanism of enhanced wound-healing.

To define MRI criteria that could act as potential predictors of treatment response in fistulizing Crohn disease in children, in order to guide more informed study interpretation. We performed a retrospective database query to identify all children and young adults with Crohn disease who underwent serial MRI studies for assessment of perianal symptoms between 2003 and 2010. We examined imaging features of perianal disease including fistula number, type and length, presence and size of associated abscess, and disease response/progression on follow-up MRI. We reviewed imaging studies and electronic medical records. Statistical analysis, including logistic regression, was performed to associate MR imaging features with treatment response and disease progression. We included 36 patients (22 male, 14 female; age range 8-21Â years). Of these, 32 had a second MRI exam and 4 had clinical evidence of complete response, obviating the need for repeat imaging. Of the parameters analyzed, presence of abscess, type of fistula according to the Parks classification, and multiplicity were not predictors of treatment outcome. Maximum length of the dominant fistula and aggregate fistula length in the case of multiple fistulae were the best predictors of treatment outcome. Maximum fistula length <2.5Â cm was a predictor of treatment response, while aggregate fistula length â¥2.5Â cm was a predictor of disease progression. Perianal fistula length is an important imaging feature to assess on MRI of fistulizing Crohn disease.\n\nLancefield group G Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis: an unusual aetiology of perianal streptococcal dermatitis acquired from heterosexual oral-anal intercourse.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdolrasouli, A; Hemmati, Y; Amin, A; Roushan, A; Butler, I\n\n2012-12-01\n\nPerianal streptococcal dermatitis (PSD) is an uncommon superficial cutaneous infection of the perianal area, almost exclusively described in children and mainly caused by group A streptococci.

We aimed to assess whether pCD in children is associated with more severe outcomes as found in adults. Data were extracted from the ImageKids database, a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal cohort study. The study enrolled 246 children at disease onset or thereafter. All patients underwent comprehensive clinical, endoscopic, and radiologic evaluation at enrollment; 98 children had repeat evaluation at 18 months. Of the 234 included patients (mean age 14.2âÂ±â2.4 years; 131 [56%] boys), 57 (24%) had perianal findings, whereas only 21 (9%) had fistulizing perianal disease. Children with pCD had reduced weight and height z scores compared with non-pCD patients (-0.9 vs -0.35, Pâ=â0.03 and -0.68 vs -0.23, respectively; Pâ=â0.04), higher weighted pediatric CD activity index (32 [interquartile range 16-50] vs 20 [8-37]; Pâ=â0.004), lower serum albumin (3.6âÂ±â0.7 vs 4.5âÂ±â0.8, Pâ=â0.016), and higher magnetic resonance enterography global inflammatory score (Pâ=â0.04). Children with pCD had more rectal (57% vs 38%, Pâ=â0.04), and jejunal involvement (31% vs 11% Pâ=â0.003) and a higher prevalence of granulomas (64% vs 23%, Pâ=â0.0001). Magnetic resonance enterography-based damage scores did not differ between groups. Patients with skin tags/fissures only, had similar clinical, endoscopic, and radiologic characteristics as patients with no perianal findings. Pediatric patients with pCD with fistulizing disease have distinct phenotypic features and a predisposition to a greater inflammatory burden.\n\nPolyphenon E 10% ointment: in immunocompetent adults with external genital and perianal warts.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoy, Sheridan M\n\n2012-08-01\n\nPolyphenon E 10% ointment, which contains a mixture of green tea catechins, is indicated for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts (Condylomata acuminata) in immunocompetent patients aged â¥18 years. In two double-blind, multinational studies in adults with external genital and perianal warts, polyphenon E 10% ointment for up to 16 weeks was significantly more effective than vehicle with regard to the complete clearance of all warts (i.e. those at baseline and newly appearing during treatment) [primary endpoint]. In gender subgroup analyses, polyphenon E 10% ointment was more effective than vehicle in both men and women in one of two individual studies, and in pooled data from both studies. Polyphenon E 10% ointment was also significantly more effective than vehicle with regard to several secondary endpoints, including the complete clearance of baseline warts and partial clearance of at least 50% of all warts in both studies. Rates of recurrence of any warts or development of new warts were low (<9%) in both treatment arms during a 12-week follow-up period in both studies. Polyphenon E 10% ointment was generally well tolerated in adults with external genital and perianal warts. According to pooled data from the two clinical studies, the majority of adverse events associated with polyphenon E 10% ointment involved application site and local skin reactions at the treatment site.\n\nEnhancement of Wound Healing by the Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbal Mixture Sophora flavescens in a Rat Model of Perianal Ulceration.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Xiaoping; Li, Xiaohua; Zhang, Lei; Liu, Zhaohui; Pan, Yuan; Chen, Dong; Bin, Donghua; Deng, Qun; Sun, Y U; Hoffman, Robert M; Yang, Zhijian; Yuan, Hong\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHemorrhoidectomy is often associated with significant postoperative complications that may result in slow wound healing.

One of such chemicals is potassium permanganate. It is a caustic chemical used as a disinfectant. The most common sites of burn by potassium permanganate are exposed sites like the face and hands. Chemical burns in the perianal and anal region are rare in clinical practice and even sparser in the pediatric age group. In this article, we report a case of perianal and anal chemical burn in an 18-month-old, male child, caused by potassium permanganate crystal applied wrongly for the treatment of pinworm infestation. As a chemical burn in this region can have serious complications, it is necessary to be vigilant when using such chemicals in these cases. Early and timely management in such cases leads to good outcomes. This is the first of such cases of chemical burn caused by potassium permanganate in the anal and perianal region.\n\nLymphomatoid papulosis - making sense of the alphabet soup: a proposal to simplify terminology.\n\nPubMed\n\nKempf, Werner; Mitteldorf, Christina; Karai, Laszlo J; Robson, Alistair\n\n2017-04-01\n\nClinically, lymphomatoid papulosis (LYP) is characterized by recurrent papulonodular lesions. Unlike this stereotypical clinical presentation, the histological spectrum of LYP is very wide, comprising distinct growth patterns, variably sized neoplastic cells, and different immunophenotypes. The revised 2016 WHO classification includes the histological LYP types A to E as well as another type characterized by a specific chromosomal alteration. In addition, new LYP types are going to be proposed, based not only on histological but also on clinical and genetic features. The ensuing expansion of the alphabetical list of histological types will add to the complexity of the terminology of LYP, thereby potentially increasing the risk of complicating rather than facilitating the diagnostic approach to the disease. Moreover, there may be overlap between individual disease types. This development raises the question as to how to simplify the terminology of LYP while still respecting its histological complexity. Herein, we advocate a practical approach to the terminology of LYP based on descriptive terms rather than the designation of LYP types by alphabetical characters. Our proposal aims to contribute to a pragmatic and user-friendly approach, thus not only facilitating the diagnostic process but also the communication between clinicians and pathologists.

It is a disease of the apocrine sweat glands and may arise from each of the localizations where apocrine glands are prominent: axilla, nipples, umbilicus, perineum, groin, and buttocks. Extensive hidradenitis suppurativa of the perineal/perianal and the gluteal regions constitute a serious social problem. In this study, we present our experience with stage III extensive hidradenitis suppurativa cases, including our treatment methods and patient outcomes. A retrospective review of the medical records from January 1990 to July 2003 of 15 patients was performed. Fifteen patients underwent treatment for extensive hidradenitis suppurativa in the gluteal, perineal/perianal, and inguinal areas with total surgical excision. All patients were men (100%) and their mean age was 42.5 (range, 23-66) years. The patients underwent a total number of 21 operations. In 11 patients wounds were left open for secondary healing, and the mean time for complete wound healing in this group was 12.2 (range, 9.5-22) weeks. Two patients underwent primary wound closure by the application of rotation flaps, and their complete healing times were observed to be approximately 2 weeks. Delayed skin grafting was used for the remaining two patients in whom the wounds had been left open after the initial operation. In this group, complete wound healing took a total of 8 weeks. Only one diverting colostomy was needed in a patient in the delayed skin-grafting group. Squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed in the specimens of one patient treated with total excision followed by the application of a rotation flap. This patient had had complaints of gluteal discharge for approximately 30 years. The cancer recurred after 6 months in the perianal region and immediate abdominoperineal resection was performed. He died during the second postoperative month due to systemic\n\nDetection of Human Papillomavirus Types 6 and 11 in Pubic and Perianal Hair from Patients with Genital Warts\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBoxman, Ingeborg L.

A pilot study was performed to investigate whether DNAs from HPV types 6 and 11 are present in hairs plucked from the pubic and perianal regions and eyebrows of patients with genital warts at present and patients with a recent history of genital warts. Genital HPV DNA was detected in 9 of 25 (36%) pubic hair samples and in 11 of 22 (50%) perianal hair samples by the CPI/CPIIg PCR. After sequencing of 17 of 20 samples, HPV type 6 or 11 was detected in 6 of 25 (24%) hair samples from the pubis and 8 of 22 (36%) hair samples from the perianal region. These types were not detected in plucked eyebrow hairs. In contrast, the HPV types associated with epidermodysplasia verruciformis were detected in similar proportions (62%) in both samples of pubic and eyebrow hairs. Moreover, HPV type 6 and 11 DNAs were detected in pubic hairs plucked from two patients who had been successfully treated and who did not show any lesion at the time of hair collection; this finding is an argument that HPV DNA may persist in this region. The presence of genital HPV types in plucked pubic and perianal hair suggests that there is an endogenous reservoir for HPV which may play a role in the recurrences of genital warts.

By measuring regional pressures, 3D-HRAM potentially provides better guidance for surgical strategy in patients with perianal fistulas. The aim was to measure regional anal pressures with 3D-HRAM and to compare these with 3D-EUS findings in patients with perianal fistulas. Consecutive patients with active perianal fistulas who underwent both 3D-EUS and 3D-HRAM at a clinic specialised in proctology were included. A group of 30 patients without fistulas served as controls. Data regarding demographics, complaints, previous perianal surgical procedures and obstetric history were collected. The mean and regional anal pressures were measured with 3D-HRAM. Fistula tract areas detected with 3D-EUS were analysed with 3D-HRAM by visual coding and the regional pressures of the corresponding and surrounding area of the fistula tract areas were measured. The study was granted by the VUmc Medical Ethical Committee. Forty patients (21 males, mean age 47) were included. Four patients had a primary fistula, 19 were previously treated with a seton/abscess drainage and 17 had a recurrence after previously performed fistula surgery. On 3D-HRAM, 24 (60%) fistula tract areas were good and 8 (20%) moderately visible. All but 7 (18%) patients had normal mean resting pressures.

The viral induction and malignant transformation of these papillomatous squamous lesions are emphasized.\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Characterization of Perianal Fistulous Disease in a Rural Based Tertiary Hospital of North India.\n\nPubMed\n\nChauhan, Narvir Singh; Sood, Dinesh; Shukla, Anurag\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo diagnose and characterize the perianal fistulous disease using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a hilly and rural area of North India. This prospective hospital based study was conducted for a period of one year from April 2014 to April 2015 in the departments of Radiodiagnosis and Surgery of our institute. A total of 50 consecutive patients presenting with perianal fistulous disease fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study and taken up for MRI. The perianal fistulae were classified according to St James University hospital classification and tracks were assessed with regard to anatomical plane, length, ramifications, abscess formation, enteric communication, external cutaneous opening, enhancement and suprasphincteric extension. Surgical correlation was done in 31 patients who opted for surgical treatment. Rest of the 19 patients preferred alternative medicine for treatment or chose to postpone their surgery. The disease was much more prevalent in males in comparison to females with male to female ratio of 24:1. Grade 4 was the most common type of fistula (34%) while Grade 5 was the least common type (4%).MRI showed a high sensitivity of 93.7% and positive predictive value (PPV) of 96.7% when correlated with surgical findings. A substantial number of patients (38%) preferred alternative medicine or non surgical form of treatment. MRI is a very sensitive modality for the evaluation of perianal fistula. In our study group, the disease predominantly affected middle aged men. Ramifications and abscesses were commonly seen, affecting nearly half of the patients and majority of the patients had active fistulous tracks with posteriorly located enteric opening. Overall, transsphincteric fistulae were most common. Significant number of patients avoided surgery or showed preference for non surgical treatment.\n\nResults of a Phase II Trial of Brentuximab Vedotin for CD30+ Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma and Lymphomatoid Papulosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nDuvic, Madeleine; Tetzlaff, Michael T; Gangar, Pamela; Clos, Audra L; Sui, Dawen; Talpur, Rakhshandra\n\n2015-11-10\n\nBrentuximab vedotin, a monoclonal antibody (cAC10) conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E, targets CD30(+) receptors. This phase II open-label trial was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy in CD30(+) cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Forty-eight patients with CD30(+) lymphoproliferative disorders or mycosis fungoides (MF) received an infusion of 1.8 mg/kg every 21 days. Forty-eight evaluable patients (22 women and 26 men; median age, 59.5 years) had an overall response rate of 73% (95% CI, 60% to 86%; 35 of 48 patients) and complete response rate of 35% (95% CI, 22% to 49%; 17 of 48 patients). Fifteen (54%; 95% CI, 31% to 59%) of 28 patients with MF responded, independent of CD30 expression. In patients with MF/SÃ©zary syndrome, the overall response rate was 50% (five of 10 patients) in patients with low CD30 expression (< 10%), 58% (seven of 12 patients) in patients with medium expression (10% to 50%), and 50% (three of six patients) in patients with high expression (â¥ 50%). Time to response was 12 weeks (range, 3 to 39 weeks), and duration of response was 32 weeks (range, 3 to 93 weeks). All patients with lymphomatoid papulosis (n = 9) and primary cutaneous anaplastic T-cell lymphomas (n = 2) responded; time to response was 3 weeks (range, 3 to 9 weeks), and median duration of response was 26 weeks (range, 6 to 44 weeks). Soluble baseline CD30 levels were lowest in complete responders (P = .036). Grade 1 to 2 peripheral neuropathy was observed in 65% of patients (95% CI, 52% to 79%; 31 of 48 patients), is still ongoing in 55% of patients (95% CI, 41% to 69%; 17 of 31 patients), and resolved in 45% of patients (95% CI, 31% to 59%; 14 of 31 patients), with a median time to resolution of 41.5 weeks. Grade 3 to 4 events were neutropenia (n = 5), nausea (n = 2), chest pain (n = 2), deep vein thrombosis (n = 1), transaminitis (n = 1), and dehydration (n = 1). Dose reductions to 1.2 mg/kg were instituted as a result of grade 2 neuropathy (n = 6), transaminitis (n = 1\n\nResults of a Phase II Trial of Brentuximab Vedotin for CD30+ Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma and Lymphomatoid Papulosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDuvic, Madeleine; Tetzlaff, Michael T.; Gangar, Pamela; Clos, Audra L.; Sui, Dawen; Talpur, Rakhshandra\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPurpose Brentuximab vedotin, a monoclonal antibody (cAC10) conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E, targets CD30+ receptors.
