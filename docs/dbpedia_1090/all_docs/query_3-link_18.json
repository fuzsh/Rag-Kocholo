        "text": "Rural America has always had a big heart. When tragedy strikes, help and hope arrive. In the July issue of Progressive Farmer, we feature this in action with a profile on the Ashes to Ashes group. We followed its convoys carrying donated hay, fencing and other necessities on the way to Verdigre, Nebraska, to help farmers and ranchers heal wounds inflicted from flooding. In connection with this, Progressive Farmer has launched the \"Homegrown Hope\" project to highlight these types of actions. We ask readers for entries to help us relay the good stories about the many ways people are making a difference in their world. Also in this issue: Despite discrimination and lean years, one Mississippi family built a fertile farm that sent generations to college. We feature how this family made it all work. We profile the 2019 Farm Dog of the Year, who is an ace at herding trials and protecting his owner. Finally, we cover the annual agBOT Challenge, which searches for ag technologies that test the status quo. The Challenge is a demonstrator of a future with rural high-speed broadband service and how robust broadband would allow robots or \"bots\" to analyze crop environments and initiate actions."
