        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nNitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous free radical with signaling capacity produced in living organisms from bacteria to humans. It is mainly generated from the oxidation of L-arginine catalyzed by NO synthases (NOSs) in most cell and tissue types [1,2]. NO is involved in several fundamental biological processes in the immune, cardiovascular, and nervous systems among other functions [2,3]. Abnormally high levels of NO are toxic and contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, diabetes, and other pathologies [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13].\n\nCellular functions of NO are in part due to post-translational modification of cysteine residues, known as S-nitrosation (also called S-nitrosylation), which results in the formation of a covalent bond between N (NO) and S (Cys). To date, over 3000 proteins are reported as susceptible to S-nitrosation [14,15], and this reversible modification can affect protein stability, localization, and activity [4,16]. The main cellular target of S-nitrosation is the reduced glutathione (GSH), which is the most abundant thiol in the cell. The S-nitrosated GSH is S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), which plays a major role in the S-transnitrosation to other cellular targets. However, GSNO is not efficient in the S-transnitrosation of some targets. One example is caspase-3 (Casp-3), for which the rate constant for S-transnitrosation from GSNO is 120 times lower than from cytoplasmic S-nitrosated human thioredoxin 1 (hTrx-SNO).\n\nThioredoxin plays an essential complementary role in the S-transnitrosation of specific cellular targets [1]. It is a cytosolic ubiquitous protein that contains five conserved cysteines, including C32 and C35, involved in the redox activity, and C62, C69, and C73 that participate in S-nitrosation [17]. A reported example of the thioredoxin S-nitrosation target is the catalytic Cys163 of Casp-3. Such modification results in the inhibition of apoptosis [18]. Many hTrx mammalian targets, such as Ras, HIF-1a, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, and NF-κB, are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and other essential physiopathological functions [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27].\n\nMany authors have contributed to the understanding of the NO path within hTrx [17,28,29,30,31,32,33]. The crystal structures of S-nitrosated hTrx showed that C62 is a stable buried target for S-nitrosation. The structure of hTrx S-nitrosated at C69 (C69-SNO hTrx) could be determined only at high pH, as C69-SNO is unstable at neutral pHs [1]. Barglow and co-workers have evaluated the influence of the redox state in the site-specific S-nitrosation of hTrx by GSNO [29]. They have shown that reduced hTrx was S-nitrosated 2.7 times faster than the oxidized protein. Besides, they have appointed that reduced hTrx was S-nitrosated selectively on C62 and oxidized hTrx (only on C73, the most solvent-exposed cysteine residue) [1,34,35]. It is well accepted that C73 is the most important cysteine for S-transnitrosation [18,30] and that hTrx S-nitrosated at C69 is translocated to the nucleus [36].\n\nIn the present work, we used NMR and mass spectrometry to follow the path of S-transnitrosation from GSNO to hTrx. NMR was a powerful tool to detect unstable and intermediate species enabling the description of an in-depth mechanism of S-transnitrosation of hTrx and S-transnitrosation to other targets. Mass spectrometry enabled the unambiguous description of each S-nitrosated form. We measured the reactivity of each of the 5 cysteines of hTrx using mutants with only one cysteine (“C-only mutants”: C32only, C35only, C62only, C69only, and C73only). We also progressively evaluated the S-nitrosation of several other mutants containing 2 or 4 cysteines (C62/C69 (C32S/C35S/C73S), C32/C35 (C62S/C69S/C73S), C73S, C35S, and C69S) to understand the wild type hTrx behavior. We found that the redox site is promptly oxidized by the action of GSNO, resulting in no participation of C32 and C35 in the nitrosative activity. We also found an interdependence of the three cysteines in the nitrosative site. We showed that NO follows an entropic path and that C62 is a NO storage site. These findings have an important impact on the understanding of the biological activity of hTrx as an S-transnitrosation agent.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Reactivity of hTrx Cysteines\n\nWe first aimed to determine the S-nitrosation reactivity of each cysteine of hTrx. We used mutants containing a single cysteine that we called cysteine-only mutants (C-only). We first evaluated the reaction of the C62only mutant with GSNO ( a). For all kinetic experiments, we measured the decrease of the intensity of Hβ/Cβ cross-peak of the reduced cysteine on the 1H-13C HSQC ( b) and/or the appearance of Hβ/Cβ cross-peak from the S-nitrosated cysteine ( c). Best results were obtained globally fitting the kinetic curves of four different excess concentrations of GSNO. The k1 and k2 were 5.3 ± 0.2 × 10−2 M−1s−1 and 5.1 ± 2.4 × 10−2 M−1s−1, respectively ( d). We used mass spectrometry to confirm the products of the C62only S-nitrosation reaction ( e). Despite the high sensitivity, we used the same concentration used for the NMR measurements ( b,c, 100 µM). We observed the two non-nitrosated C62only species, with (C62SH, 11,673.5 Da) and without the initial methionine (C62SH’, 11,542.5 Da). Over time, we observed the formation of the S-nitrosated species (C62SNO and C62SNO’) [40].\n\nWe also measured the C69only (Figure S1), C73only (Figure S2), C35only (Figure S3), and C32only (Figure S4) S-nitrosation kinetics. The forward rate constant for C69only was 1.9 ± 0.1 × 10−1 M−1s−1, 3.6 times bigger than for C62only. The reverse rate constant was 3.8 ± 0.6 × 10−1 M−1s−1. Different from C62only, we also observed S-glutathionylation for C69only (Figure S1D). Remarkably, the reaction of the C73only with GSNO led to S-nitrosation and two thiolation reactions: dimerization and S-glutathionylation. We confirmed the dimeric product formation by SDS-PAGE with different concentrations of GSNO (Figure S2D,E). The relative monomer/dimer ratio varied with the excess of GSNO. For conditions of nitrosative stress (10× and 20× of GSNO), the mutant was mostly monomeric, whereas it was not possible to determine by this experiment how much of it was S-nitrosated and how much was S-glutathionylated. It is important to note that the ratio between monomer and dimer remained practically unchanged over time when comparing two experiments carried out with 20 times excess of GSNO with reaction times of 1 h and 20 h.\n\nTo characterize the post-translational changes that occurred in the C73only mutant upon reaction with GSNO, we carried out a mass spectrometry analysis (Figure S2F). Several species were detected: (i) unmodified C73SH with and without the initial methionine (11,673.3 Da and 11,542.4 Da, respectively); (ii) S-nitrosated C73only (+29 Da); and (iii) S-glutathionylated C73only (+305 Da), both observed after 1200 s of reaction. At 7200 s of reaction, we observed an increase in the relative intensity of the peaks corresponding to the S-glutathionylated state. We obtained 2.5 ± 0.5 M−1s−1 as the forward rate constant (k1) and 0.9 ± 0.5 M−1s−1 as the reverse rate constant (k2) for the S-nitrosation reaction of C73only. We also determined the forward rate constant for the dimerization reaction (k3) as being 2.8 ± 1.3 M−1s−1.\n\nFor the mutants with only one cysteine, one S-nitrosation site, C32only (Figure S4), and C73only were the most reactive followed by the C69only. C35only (Figure S3) presented a reactivity very similar to that of the less reactive mutant, C62only. shows the comparison among the forward rate constants for the S-nitrosation reactions of each mutant by GSNO.\n\n3.2. S-nitrosation Kinetics of Wild Type hTrx\n\nThe next step was the measurement of the S-nitrosation kinetics of the wild type hTrx to investigate the cross-reactivity of the three cysteines in the S-nitrosation site and 2 cysteines in the redox site. We followed independently the CβHβ resonances of each cysteine ( a). Both C32 and C35 cross-peaks in their reduced form vanished from the spectra immediately after the reaction started. The immediate oxidation of the redox site in the presence of GSNO was also demonstrated in the experiments with the mutant containing only C32 and C35 (C62S/C69S/C73S, C32/C35) (Figures S5 and S6). This oxidation could be the result of the S-nitrosation of C32 (the most reactive, ), followed by the nucleophilic attack of C35 thiolate to the sulfur of C32-SNO. However, this result must be analyzed with caution, since contamination of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) could also lead to this immediate oxidation.\n\nA remarkable finding was that rate of disappearance of reduced resonance of C69 and C73 was much slower than that observed for C69only and C73only. For C73, compare the curves of 10× GSNO of the wild-type ( ) and C73only (Figure S2). For C69, compare the curves of 10×, 20× and 30× of GSNO of the wild-type ( ) and C69only (Figure S1). On the other hand, the cross-peaks of the reduced C62 decayed much faster than the C62only mutant ( B). These data suggest that there is an interdependence among the nitrosative cysteines in hTrx. To better understand this phenomenon, we constructed mutants containing two and three cysteines of the nitrosative site: C62/C69 (C32S/C35S/C73S), C69S, C32/C35 (C62S/C69S/C73S), C73S, C35S, and C35S/C73S. We will refer to this inversion of decay rates observed for C69only and C62only mutants (C69 decays faster than C62) compared with the wild type (C69 decays slower than C62) as a C69-C62 inversion. This inversion is essential to our hypothesis.\n\nWe detected the products of the S-nitrosation reaction of wild-type hTrx by mass spectrometry ( C). The data confirmed the presence of mono (12,696.0 Da), double (12,725.0 Da), and triple (12,754.0 Da) S-nitrosated wild type hTrx. We also observed the presence of the protein with one glutathionylation (hTrxG) and two S-glutathionylation (hTrxGG). We observed mixed states such as mono-S-nitrosated state and S-glutathionylated (hTrxNOG) and bi-S-nitrosated and mono S-glutathionylated (hTrxNONOG).\n\n3.3. Mutants with Multiple S-nitrosation Sites to Define the Path of NO\n\nTo investigate the interdependence among different S-nitrosation sites, we evaluated the S-nitrosation kinetic of the other four hTrx mutants with multiple S-nitrosation sites. For the mutant C62/C69, we observed the same C69-C62 inversion as for the wild-type hTrx. C62 behaves similarly, while C69 decayed slower than that observed for C69only. These results suggest either an internal transfer of NO from C69 to C62 or negative cooperativity between C62 and C69 (Figure S6).\n\nThe mutant C35S mimics the S-nitrosation behavior of the wild-type reduced state and by studying the S-nitrosation reaction using C35S we could test the redox-control hypothesis [30] over the S-nitrosation reaction. For the wild type, we observed immediate oxidation at the redox site, forming a disulfide C32/C35. However, the contamination of GSSG in our preparation of GSNO could contribute to the oxidation of the redox site, preventing any conclusion regarding the redox control. The contamination of GSSG does affect redox site of the mutant C35S and the reduced form of C35S hTrx behaved similarly to the wild type in terms of the response to S-nitrosation (Figure S7A). This data suggests that the oxidation of the redox site does not interfere significantly in the nitrosative site, meaning that a redox control in the S-nitrosation reaction is less likely [30]. Note that for the 10× excess of GSNO at ~10.000 s, C62 cross-peaks remained ~30% of its area and C73 remained ~5%, for both C35S and wild type hTrx. C69 cross peak remained ~35% for C35S and ~50% for the wild type hTrx. Altogether, we showed that the S-nitrosation reaction is similar, independently of the oxidation state of the redox site.\n\nTo evaluate the relative contribution of C73 to the nitrosative site, we studied the kinetics of the mutant C73S. Remarkably C73S, C62 and C69 decayed slower when compared to the wild type (Figure S7B). Note that the C69 cross peak remained ~100% of its intensity after ~10.000 s (10× excess of GSNO) while the wild type decayed 50%, suggesting the importance of C73 as the most reactive cysteine ( ). For C62 resonance, the decay was ~65% for C73S and ~30% for the wild type. We also observed the C69-C62 inversion for C73S, and, as with the wild type, the redox site also oxidized immediately after the addition of GSNO.\n\nAnother important point to take into consideration was the possibility of an intermolecular NO transfer. To address this, we compared the S-nitrosation of the mutant C35S ({15N, 13C}-labeled C35S, 100 µM) in the presence and absence of the mutant C73only (unlabeled, 100 µM) (Figure S7C). We did not observe a statistically significant difference between the two conditions, suggesting that since doubling the concentration of C73 did not change the response of the system an intermolecular external NO transfer would not play any role.\n\nC62 is the less reactive cysteine in the nitrosative site ( , C62only) and is involved exclusively in S-nitrosation. For the wild type hTrx, the C62/C69, and C35S mutants, C62 was not involved in thiolation reactions, either glutathionylation or disulfide formation. For this reason, we will argue that C62 is the ultimate destination of the NO, working as a NO storage site. The other consideration to classify C62 as the storage site is the C69-C62 inversion. C62 is also the least exposed [1]. The importance of C73 to the effectiveness of the S-nitrosation was also established. With these data in mind, two questions remained to be answered: what is the importance of C73 in the NO transfer to the storage site? Does it go directly to C62 or via C69 in the path? To answer these questions, we measured the S-nitrosation kinetics of the mutant C69S.\n\nThe mutant C69S was essential to show the importance of C73 to S-nitrosation. In this mutant, the decay rates are similar to the wild type for either C62 or C73. Note that for the 10× excess of GSNO at ~10.000 s, cross-peaks correspondent to C62 remained ~35% of its area for C69S and ~30% for the wild type, C73 remained ~15% for C69S and ~5% for wild type ( b and Figure S7D).\n\nFor the mutant C69S, we did not observe a C73-C62 inversion. However, C73 decay is much slower for the C69S mutant than that observed for C73only. Different from the mutant C62/C69, where C62 decay was similar to the C62only mutant, for C69S, the C62 peak area decays faster than for C62only, meaning that the effect of the presence of C73 increased the S-nitrosation of C62, being more efficient than the effect resulting from the presence of C69. Note that in the presence of C69 (C62/C69 mutant), while the rate of C69 S-nitrosation became lower than that observed for C69only mutant, the rate of C62 S-nitrosation was the same as observed for C62only mutant. In , we compared the peak area decay of the reduced C62 in the wild type and 5 hTrx mutants. When comparing 10x excess of GSNO, we show that the presence of C73 in wild type hTrx ( a), C35S ( b), and C69S ( c) mutants displayed a faster decay of the reduced C62 when compared to C62only ( d), C62C69 ( e) and C73S ( f), in which C73 are absent. Therefore, C73 is responsible for potentializing S-nitrosation of C62, especially at a lower excess ratio of GSNO.\n\n3.4. Fine Details in the Changes in Protein Structure by Nitrosation\n\nS-nitrosation has the chance to promote changes in the structure and dynamics of a protein. We observed a fine-tuned regulation of the protein dynamics upon S-nitrosation. For this, we calculated the random coil index, interpreted as the chemical shift-based order parameter, S2 [57] from the resonance assignment of the backbone of C62only and S-nitrosated C62only (C62onlySNO) ( a), C69only and S-nitrosated C69only (C69onlySNO) ( b) and C73only and S-nitrosated C73only (C73onlySNO) ( c).\n\n3.4.1. General Flexibility Changes after Nitrosation as Observed by S2 Measurements\n\nWe observed that the S nitrosation led to changes in the flexibility of the β3/α3 loop and N-terminal region of α3 that contains C62, and α3/β4 loop containing C69 and C73. The random coil index takes into consideration the chemical shifts of the backbone (Cα, CO, Cβ, N, Hα, and NH). The lower the S2 the greater the flexibility. From the S-nitrosation of residue C62, the region comprising residue S73 became more flexible, given a decrease in S2. The α3 helix, on the other hand, showed greater rigidity when residue C62 was S-nitrosated. C69 S-nitrosation resulted in a small increase in flexibility of α3 and α3/β4 loop. C73 S-nitrosation resulted in a remarkable rigidity increase at α3/β4 loop, which characterizes an entropically unfavorable process.\n\nThe dynamics of all C-only mutants were similar, except for C73only, with was more flexible at the α3/β4 loop. The loops that render mobility to the nitrosative site are β3/α3 and α3/β4. C62 is at β3/α3 at the N-cap of α3, C69 is at the C-cap of α3 and C73 is at the α3/β4 loop. Changes in flexibility in these regions are relevant to the nitrosative site. C73 of the non-nitrosated C73only is in the most flexible loop of the protein ( c,d). Upon S-nitrosation, C73 became more rigid with S2 going from 0.69 to 0.83. Thus, despite S-nitrosation at C73 being kinetically favorable (and the most reactive cysteine, ), the increase in rigidity makes it unfavorable in terms of the conformational entropy (α3/β4 loop became more rigid). The S-nitrosation of C62 led to a subtle increase in the order parameter of β3/α3 loop. The S-nitrosation of C69only resulted in subtle changes in S2. These data suggest that conformational entropy may play a role in the S-nitrosation. Denitrosation at C73 and C62, especially at C73, seems to be conformationally entropically favorable and may favor internal transfers.\n\n3.4.2. Changes around Nitrosated Sites as Analyzed by CSP\n\nWe also analyzed the chemical shift perturbation of 1H-15N (1H-15N CSP, Figure S8) and cysteine 1Hβ-13Cβ ( ) to understand the structural and dynamical features at the nitrosative site. The S-nitrosation of C62only led to changes in 1H-15N CSP in all cysteines at the nitrosative site, including β3/α3 loop, α3, and the α3/β4 loop (Figure S8A), showing cooperativity between C62 and most of the residues of the nitrosative site. S-nitrosation of C69only elicited 15N-1H CSP confined to the C-terminal region of α3 and the α3/β4 loop (Figure S8B). For C73only 15N-1H CSP was local, only at adjacent residues (Figure S8C). These results can be explained by the fact the S-nitrosation of the buried residue C62 led to more significant structural changes compared to C69 and C73, in this order. The important conclusion is that the S-nitrosation of C62 led to structural changes in the whole nitrosative site but S-nitrosation of either C69 or C73 did not affect significantly C62.\n\nThe analysis of 1Hβ-13Cβ CSP was elucidative since it is near the chemical environment of SNO ( ). The large 1Hβ-13Cβ CSP observed for C62 resulted from the oxidation of the redox site and not from the S-nitrosation of either C73 or C69. This agrees with the analysis of the 1H-15N CSP. The S-nitrosation of wild type hTrx, C69S, and C73S, all of them containing the intact redox site, led to significant chemical shift changes at C62, whereas the S-nitrosation of C35S and C62C69, incapable of forming a disulfide bond at the redox site, did not show significant chemical shift changes at C62.\n\nLarge 1Hβ-13Cβ CSP at C69 and C73 correlates with the S-nitrosation of C62 and not to oxidation of the redox site. The S-nitrosation of C62 led to a significant 15N-1H CSP (Figure S8A) at the C-terminal portion of α3 and α3/β4 loop, regions that contain C69 and C73. The analysis of 1Hβ-13Cβ CSP reinforced this observation. The S-nitrosation of wt hTrx, C35S, C73S, and C62C69 ( ), all led to chemical shift changes in C69. All of them have C62 present, while the redox site is incapable to form the disulfide bond.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the presence of C73 has a remarkable effect on the kinetics of C62, making the S-nitrosation of C62 much faster. We observed 15N-1H CSP for the loop containing the C73 when C62only was S-nitrosated (Figure S8A). The analysis of 1Hβ-13Cβ CSP showed that C73 shifted for wt hTrx, C69S, and C35S ( ). The absence of C69 in the mutant C69S showed that the observed chemical shift change in C73 is not due to the presence of C69. Similarly, the chemical shift changes in C73 were not due to disulfide bond formation in the redox site since a similar shift was observed for the C35S mutant. Most probably, 1Hβ-13Cβ CSP of C73 is due to the S-nitrosation of C62, as observed for the mutant C62only (Figure S8A).\n\n3.5. S-transnitrosation of hTrx-SNO to GSH and hTrx Mutants\n\nSo far, we have described the pathway for the S-transnitrosation from GSNO to hTrx. Now, we wanted to probe the S-transnitrosation of hTrx-SNO to other targets. This is a complex question since it may also depend on the target. However, GSH is a good target to mimic a thermodynamically favorable S-transnitrosation to an exposed cysteine, as GSNO is one of the most stable nitrosothiols. We probed the S-transnitrosation reaction by preparing C62only-SNO, C69only-SNO, and C62/C69-(SNO)2 (Figures S9 and S10). For C62/C69-(SNO)2, C62 is fully S-nitrosated, while C69 is only ~75%. We globally fit the S-nitrosation kinetic from C62only-SNO to GSH (Figure S9A). For the global fitting, we had to include the formation of C62only-glutathionylated (C62only-G) in very small amounts. S-nitrosated species were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The reaction rate for S-transnitrosation for C62only-SNO was 5.9 ± 0.6 × 10−2 M−1s−1 and 4.9 ± 1.2 × 10−2 M−1s−1 for glutathionylation, which occurred in very small amounts (Figure S9). Note that the reaction is slow to be biologically relevant in the cellular environment, which is consistent with the role of C62 as a storage site. We showed similar behavior for C62 in the S-transnitrosation reaction from C62/C69-(SNO)2 (Figure S10A).\n\nWe also probed the S-transnitrosation from C69-SNO to GSH for the C69only-SNO and C62/C69-(SNO)2. C69 was more efficient than C62 for S-transnitrosation (14 times faster), but, for both mutants, the reaction was slow, making C69 unlikely to be an efficient site for S-transnitrosation in hTrx (Figures S9B and S10B). We globally fit the S-nitrosation kinetic from C69only-SNO to GSH (Figure S9B). Here also we had to consider the formation of C69only-glutathionylated (C69only-G) in very small amounts. The reaction rate for the S-transnitrosation for C69only-SNO was 8.4 ± 1.2 × 10−1 M−1s−1 and 2.3 ± 1.0 × 10−1 M−1s−1 for glutathionylation, which occurred in very small amounts (Figure S9). Although it happened on a very small scale, the formation of C69only-G was ~5 times faster than for the C62only-G, being C69 more efficient than S-glutathionylation. The mass spectrometry experiment confirmed the S-glutathionylated species.\n\nThis observation is consistent with C73 being the most efficient site for S-transnitrosation. Barglow et al. (2011) [29] proposed the external intermolecular S-transnitrosation from C62-SNO to C73, making C73-SNO prone to S-nitrosate to other targets. We probed the S-transnitrosation from C62/C69-(SNO)2 to unlabeled C62/C69 (Figure S10C) and also to unlabeled C73only (Figure S10D), both intermolecular NO transfer. In both situations, we did not observe the S-transnitrosation reaction. This data follows the previous conclusion that the internal NO transfer from C62-SNO (storage site) is the main pathway to form the C73-SNO, prone to S-transnitrosate to multiple targets.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIn the present work, we used several mutants of the cytoplasmic human thioredoxin 1 (hTrx) to decipher the path of SNO and the relative contribution of each of the five cysteines. We first described the reactivity and chemoselectivity of each cysteine and established the basis for the discussion. Most importantly we showed that C62 is a slow, end-of-process NO storage site in hTrx. C73 is the most reactive and probably the first S-nitrosated state, which can transfer NO intramolecularly to C62. We also showed that intermolecular transfers of NO are negligible. Based on NMR chemical shift differences, C62 nitrosation impacts hTrx structure more than C69 or C73 nitrosation (without changing the global fold).\n\nOne important discussion that comes along with the proposition of the internal NO transfer is its plausibility since, for most of the hTrx structures, C62 and C73 are more than 10 Å apart. A direct nucleophilic attack from C62 in a thiolate form to the electron-rich nitrogen of the C73-SNO is necessary for this NO internal transfer. The possibility of an external intermolecular transfer between two hTrx molecules was excluded (Figure S7C). The answer is in the plasticity of the nitrosative site. The low order parameters at the α3/β3 loop, the N-terminal of α3, and mainly at the α3/β4 loop showed that there is flexibility at the nitrosative site ( ). Hwang et al. (2015) showed the crystal structure of a fully oxidized hTrx (5DQY), with the formation of a disulfide bond between C62 and C69, despite being more than 10 Å apart and separated by α3 in all other available structures [58]. The formation of this disulfide bond implies α3 unfolding. For the disulfide bond formation, it is presumed a helix/coil equilibrium for α3 to enable the direct nucleophilic attack between these two residues. All of this together makes the internal NO transfer structurally and dynamically plausible.\n\nAnother point must be taken into consideration, which is the chemical mechanism able to explain the chemo and regioselectivity promoted by protein for the S-nitrosothiol reactions. Thalipov and co-workers [59] computational calculations successfully described the reaction mechanism and the resonance structures of a S-nitrosothiol (S, D or I, ). The mechanism explains how the local environment (regioselectivity) of each cysteine in the protein can control if the site is more susceptible for S-nitrosation or thiolation (chemoselectivity). The weak covalent bond energy of only ~30 kcal/mol and the long S-N bond (~1.8 Å) was explained by the contribution of an ionic resonance structure I. The double bond character of the S-N bond arises from the zwitterion D. The thiolation/S-nitrosation results from the relative contribution of S and D resonance forms [59,60]. Our data indicate a protein control that differentiates the three cysteines of the nitrosative center of hTrx. While C62 could only S-nitrosate, C69 and C73 could S-nitrosate (resulted from a nucleophilic attack to the S form) and thiolate (resulted from a nucleophilic attack to the D form). C73 thiolation led to S-glutathionylation and dimerization, while C69 only to S-glutathionylation. Moran and co-workers [60] studied the hydrolysis of S-nitrosothiols in which the nucleophile is water. Their calculation shows the formation of an ionic intermediate (probably forming an intimate ion pair between RS− and NO+) that favors the nucleophilic substitution, probably via SN1-like. We propose here that the presence of an ionic resonance structure I favors a longer distance nucleophilic attack where NO+ would have relative freedom at the nitrosative site and the protein structural and dynamical demand for the internal transfer would not be high.\n\nIn all experiments containing the intact redox catalytic center, we observed rapid disulfide bond formation between C32 and C35. This observation could be a result of the rapid S-nitrosation of C32 followed by thiolation and conversion to a disulfide bond between C32 and C35. Could also be an artifact due to the contamination of GSSG to the GSNO preparation. Nevertheless, our experiments showed unambiguously that the reduced and oxidized forms of the two catalytic cysteines (C32 and C35) did not impact the S-nitrosation of the three other cysteines and/or the NO transfer between them. The similar S-nitrosation activity of wild type hTrx and C35S (mimics the reduced state) impacts the widely accepted interpretation that the oxidized and reduced hTrx have different S-transnitrosation activities [30], we suggested that the oxidized and reduced states have similar S-nitrosation activity, and the redox control may not be relevant. Moreover, there is no biological role described so far for the reduced S-nitrosated hTrx [61].\n\nBased on the kinetic and structural data, we propose a biological mechanism for hTrx S-nitrosation (summarized in ), depicting the role of the many post-translational modified species of hTrx detected here. We took into consideration that our studies used a concentration of hTrx and GSNO much higher than the cellular content. Of note, the main findings in this work are independent of the concentration, such as the observed reactivities of the individual cysteines and the presence of internal NO transfer. The relative amount of the S-nitrosated, glutathionylated, and dimeric species is largely dependent on concentration and this dependence will be discussed in the next paragraphs. In the proposed mechanism we combined the data of the present work and the vast biological data available in the literature ( ). The measurement of the pKa values of the different thiols could further clarify the reactivity of the cysteines to GSNO.\n\nThe S-nitrososative cycle starts with the oxidation of the redox site, in which the redox state of hTrx depends on the redox potential of the cytoplasm controlled by the expression level of thioredoxin and the NADPH available. We assumed, based on the results discussed earlier, that the redox state of hTrx will not change the following outcome of events. C73 was the most reactive cysteine and supposedly is the first S-nitrosated state to be formed. C73-SNO is the state responsible for S-transnitrosation to other targets, such as caspase 3 [17]. An alternative path for NO is the internal NO transfer to C62 producing a low reactive species ( , in yellow), referred to here as the NO storage site of hTrx. C62 S-nitrosation is kinetically unfavorable but thermodynamically favorable. We propose that NO follows an entropic favorable path and entropy compensation may play a major role in the internal transfer.\n\nAn important discussion that comes from our data is the biological relevance of the reduced state of C62-SNO hTrx. In the presence of a reduced environment in the cell (high NADPH) C62-SNO hTrx can be reduced by the thioredoxin reductase (hTrxR)/hTrx system and be present. Further studies are necessary to understand the role of reduced C62-SNO hTrx, but in our point of view, it is likely that C69 and C73 are promptly denitrosated by the hTrxR/hTrx system, while C62 is more resistant to S-denitrosation, functioning as a stock and acting as a buffer of SNO in the cell in both reduced and oxidized environment. The thermodynamically stable C62-SNO storage site could act as a buffer of SNO under nitrosative stress conditions [66,67]. The biological role of hTrx in S-denitrosation is of major relevance and is one of the main functions of hTrx [2]. S-nitrosation in the cell is an important physiological signaling pathway, such as phosphorylation, and nitrosative stress is behind several degenerative diseases [2,16]. hTrx overexpression in Hela cells has been demonstrated to be protective against nitrosative stress. Smith and Marletta [61] pointed out the lack of evidence that the reduced form of C62-SNO hTrx can S-transnitrosate a cellular target. By contrast, oxidized C73-SNO hTrx can S-transnitrosate to multiple targets [61]. Maybe, the reduced form of C62-SNO hTrx is not relevant for S-transnitrosation but mainly serves as NO storage.\n\nThe present data also suggest that C62 is not subject to direct S-nitrosation from GSNO. C62 is buried and direct S-nitrosation was slow compared to the S-nitrosation of either C73 or C69 followed by the internal NO transfer to C62. C62-SNO and C69-SNO were also unable to efficiently S-transnitrosate to GSH directly. In our opinion, reverse NO transfer from C62 to C73 is necessary for the effectiveness of C73-SNO to S-transnitrosate other cellular targets ( ). C62, as the storage site, buffers the influence of the cellular environment in the S-transnitrosation activity of hTrx.\n\nC73 is the most solvent-exposed cysteine of hTrx and is well known for being responsible for all described S-transnitrosation cellular events involving hTrx [2,68]. Many mammalian targets are involved in cell cycle regulation or other essential physiopathological functions. Among these proteins are caspases 3, Ras, HIF-1a, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, and NF-κB [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. C73 is also the site for in vitro thiolation of hTrx, leading to dimerization and S-glutathionylation ( ). So far, the physiopathological role of thiolation in the cell is not fully understood. A small amount of GSNO formed almost equivalent quantities of S-nitrosated and dimeric hTrx. At these concentrations of GSNO, we also observed the formation of the glutathionylated and S-nitrosated species. The glutathionylated-hTrx (hTrx-G) is formed by the attack of GSH on the SNO-hTrx. The increase in the excess of GSNO favored the formation of the monomeric hTrx, probably due to the higher propensities for the formation of the S-nitrosated-hTrx, preventing the formation of the dimeric form. Our data suggest that hTrx thiolation should be significant only at basal levels of GSNO and less important under nitrosative stress. Wu et al. (2011) [69] reported that the cellular level of SNO-hTrx is tightly regulated by the presence of reduced hTrx and GSH, both present under physiological conditions. Among the thiolated species, the in vitro experiments suggested a more major proportion of dimeric hTrx than hTrx-G. This may not be true in a cellular environment due to the crowding effect. Among the hTrx functions in the cell, the fine-tuning between S-nitrosation, NO storage, S-denitrosation, and thiolation is fundamental for the cell redox and nitrosative homeostasis. The thiolated species regulate both the amount of the NO storage state (C62-SNO) and the reactive form (C73-SNO) of hTrx.\n\nWe also showed that the S-nitrosation of C62 has a negative cooperative effect on the S-nitrosation of C69. Therefore, S-nitrosation of C69 only occurred at high levels of GSNO. Nitrosative and oxidative stress are directly related to hTrx nuclear translocation ( ), activating the expression of transcription factors related to cell survival and proliferation [68]. At the same time, nitrosative stress leads to S-transnitrosation of the active site of caspase-3, inhibiting apoptosis ( ). While S-nitrosation of caspase-3 and other cellular targets occurs through C73 [2,12,18], the nuclear translocation occurs through the S-nitrosation of C69 in a karyopherin-dependent manner [36]. In , the arrows in red refer to reactions that occur only at nitrosative stress. The negative cooperative effect of C62 is important to downregulate the S-nitrosation of C69 and warrant that it will occur only under nitrosative stress conditions. All data indicate that C69-SNO does not S-transnitrosate to other targets. This role is reserved for C73.\n\nThe functions of hTrx as a NO storage site make it important to regulate, along with the thiolated states, the reactivity of hTrx. At physiological conditions with low levels of GSNO, the NO will be preferentially located at C62, being C62-SNO thermodynamically stable with low reactivity ( ). Under nitrosative stress ( , arrows in red), at high levels of GSNO, the levels of C73-SNO and C69-SNO are high, decreasing the level of thiolated species (Figure S2).\n\nIn the experimental design of the present work, we constructed mutants that enabled the observation of intermediate states of SNO-hTrx. NMR enables the observation of site-specific reactions and their kinetic and structural consequences. This was powerful in determining the NO path in hTrx. The C-only mutants gave information on the reactivity of each cysteine individually. We gradually increased the complexity of the mutants, which enabled the observation of the interrelation between the different cysteines and the internal NO transfer. There are two major limitations to our strategy, namely the use of high concentrations demanded by NMR and the timescale of the experiments. To overcome the concentration problem, we used mass spectrometry to show unambiguously the species formed under identical experimental conditions of the NMR kinetic experiments. The timescale limited our capacity to describe all of the rate constants and globally fit the described model.\n\nIn summary, we described in detail the path of NO transfer to and from hTrx ( ). The interpretation of the experimental data combined with the vast biological data available in the literature enabled us to propose a mechanism for the nitrosative cellular cycle. The physiological path begins in the nitrosative site of hTrx with the prompt formation of C73-SNO followed by internal transfer to C62, which serves as a NO storage site. The redox site is promptly oxidized and does not regulate the nitrosative activity. To modify hTrx cellular targets the NO is internally transferred back from storage (C62-SNO) to C73 and, finally, to the target protein. C69 is not S-nitrosated under physiological conditions since C62-SNO displays negative cooperativity towards C69. Remarkably, C69 is modified only under nitrosative stress and serves as a signal to hTrx translocation to the nucleus, thus, regulating the cell responses and inducing a proliferative state."
