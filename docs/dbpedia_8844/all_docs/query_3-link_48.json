        "text": "Hello, my name is Ben Werner and I just graduated from NDSU with a civil engineering degree.\n\nBefore coming to Fargo, I had lived in quite a few different places. When I was five years old, my family moved from Chicago to Afghanistan because my dad was working with a women’s hospital in Kabul. In 2009, my family moved back to Chicago to the west side of the city, in the neighborhood of North Lawndale where over 90% of the population is African American. Living in both Afghanistan and North Lawndale, I had the chance to live in two very different cultures. For example, some of my first friendships were with Afghan boys who didn’t speak English. Though we did not share the same language, we spent hours together playing. And in eighth grade, back in the US, on the basketball team, I was the only white player on the team and was dubbed the nickname “Two Percent” (like the milk), haha.\n\nAll these experiences have culminated in shaping who I am and what I value. I have learned that life experiences dictate so much about how we, as humans, react and empathize with ongoing social issues. Since being in North Dakota, I have been involved in The Impact Movement. This Christian ministry is geared towards African American students. Building relationships with others involved in this group and growing in my faith through this ministry has been a highlight of my time in college at NDSU.\n\nWhere do you call home?\n\nGrowing up, this has always been an interesting question to answer. The short answer is Chicago. l was born there, all my family lives there, and I love the city. However, growing up, I called many places home. To give a reference, as a child, I had never been to one school for more than two years until I got to high school. My parents both work in healthcare and this has brought us overseas to Afghanistan, as well as the city of Memphis, TN. I also spent a gap year after high school volunteering at a school for refugees in New Delhi, India. But I guess for the time being, my home is Fargo.\n\nTell us about your passion for traveling and how landed in Fargo? What keeps you busy here?\n\nAs mentioned previously, I have spent time in several different places throughout my life, which I believe has sparked an interest in my desire to discover new places and experience new cultures. Over my 23 years of living, I’ve traveled to twenty different countries. Most recently, I went to visit a friend in Guatemala. After graduating from college in the spring, I am hoping to visit Switzerland and Rwanda.\n\nComing to Fargo for college was a new cultural experience for me that has been incredibly impactful as well. As mentioned, I came to Fargo to study Civil Engineering at North Dakota State University. I am currently a senior and since being here, I have stayed busy. Outside of studying for classes, I have played on the NDSU club volleyball team and have been involved in The Impact Movement. I also have volunteered with a student ministry called “Bridges,” which aims to help International students by providing community and aiding in their transition into living in the United States.\n\nWhy should the FM area community engage more with the Tri-College community?\n\nI believe there is so much value in the engagement between the Fargo-Moorhead and Tri-College community. There is always a lot going on in Fargo, and it’s important that people are connected to these opportunities. There are several cultural events put on each year by NDSU such as Diwali night, Afrique, and Lunar New Year, which highlight different cultures by showcasing performances and traditional food. For anyone who has yet to experience one of these events, I highly encourage you to check them out!\n\nWhy should people care about outside the Midwest?\n\nFrom my experience traveling and living in other countries, I believe there are many benefits to experiencing authentic communities within other cultures. Traveling to new places allows misconceptions to be broken down and causes greater empathy between the different people groups. By living in India for seven months, I not only learned a lot about Indian culture, but I was able to give a perspective to Indians about the US and what life is truly like here. This experience has allowed me to better understand Indian international students here at NDSU and hopefully provide some comfort to these students who are living away from home. It has also led to a few home-cooked Indian meals that have never disappointed!\n\nWhat are some misconception of rural cities versus urban regions?\n\nIt has been very interesting going from living in Chicago to New Delhi, to Fargo. The pace of life in Fargo is much slower than in the former cities mentioned. Over time, I have grown to appreciate this difference. Since living in Fargo, it has been interesting to see people’s judgments of Chicago. Because Chicago is only highlighted in the news due to its violence, many people in Fargo only have this association. Although there is truth to the hardships of a place like Chicago, there is much more beauty within the city than is only experienced by taking a trip to the place itself. There is so much diversity in Chicago, which can be experienced by venturing out and trying different restaurants and by going to different festivals and events. And people back in Chicago also have negative conceptions of Fargo because it is much more rural than a city like Chicago. However, since I’ve spent time working in Fargo, I’ve found that many people coming from rural, farming backgrounds have strong work ethics that have been applied well to a college setting such as NDSU.\n\nWhat did you learn growing up between many cultures which you can apply in Fargo?\n\nI learned how to connect well with people who come from different backgrounds. Although lots of people around Fargo come from smaller towns, I’ve still been able to make many friends here. In the same way that it was foreign to eat food with my hands in India, it was just as foreign going ice fishing here in Fargo! One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned living cross-culturally is that it’s important to approach new settings with curiosity and an open mind.\n\nWhat is your vision 2030? Where will you be and why?\n\nAs of now, my plan is, after graduation in the spring, to move back to Chicago and work as a water systems engineer. A lot can change in six to seven years, so I honestly think that I am keeping an open mind and open hands at whatever God has in store for me. The field of water systems engineering can open many doors. I have a heart for working with underserved people, and I know that a proper water system is a basic necessity everyone shares. This may lead me to eventually work overseas or within another US city. We shall see."
