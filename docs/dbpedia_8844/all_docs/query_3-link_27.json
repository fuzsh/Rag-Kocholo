        "text": "Central Location\n\nGrand Prairie, Texas, is centrally located in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington Metropolitan Statistical Area. The community stretches 26 miles long by about eight miles at its widest point. The city covers about 81 square miles (100 square miles including extraterritorial jurisdiction) and has an estimated population of 197,590.\n\nNear Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, Interstate Highways\n\nThe city's northern border lies 5 to 10 minutes south of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The eastern boundary is 12 miles west of downtown Dallas and the western 15 miles east of Fort Worth. Passing east and west through Grand Prairie and linking the city with major markets are Interstate 30, a strong entertainment and business corridor, and Interstate 20, developing as a significant retail and corporate location.\n\nSite of One of Largest Industrial Districts\n\nBecause of its central location and proximity to air and highway transportation infrastructure, Grand Prairie also is a well-established distribution center. Much of the Great Southwest Industrial District's approximately 80-million square feet lies in Grand Prairie. Quick access to the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, large local markets of Dallas and Fort Worth, rail and interstate highways continue to attract new construction of warehouse, distribution and manufacturing buildings.\n\nLand Availability, Recreational Amenities\n\nRecent industrial, hotel and multifamily development has taken up large tracts in the north Great Southwest Industrial District, yet additional land remains there, nearby and southward. The southernmost section of the city, amid hill country-like vistas around Joe Pool Lake, is attracting high-end residential housing and plans for resort development.\n\nMore Information: Grand Prairie Economic Development Home Page\n\nWith more than 5,000 acres of parks, well-established and new neighborhoods and lively, competitive athletic programs, Grand Prairie makes businesses and residents feel right at home.\n\nThe Grand Prairie Parks, Arts & Recreation Department was named best in the nation in 2017 when it was awarded the National Recreation and Park Association's Gold Medal in the Class II division for cities of population between 150,001 and 400,000.\n\nFifty-eight parks include a senior center, the Ruthe Jackson Conference Center, five recreation centers, a dog park, five public swimming pools (including one indoor pool), two beaches on Joe Pool Lake, a campground, five softball and baseball complexes, 32 tennis courts and 18 soccer fields (four lighted adult, six lighted youth), and hiking and biking trails.\n\nWith a ¼ cent sales tax devoted to park improvements, a $125 million, 20-year Parks Master Plan will improve every park in Grand Prairie and add valuable new park land on an ongoing basis.\n\nEpicCentral\n\nEpicCentral is a 172-acre park site located off George W. Bush Tollway (Highway 161). Reflecting innovation and community investment, EpicCentral is home to Epic Waters Indoor Waterpark, The Summit recreation center for adults ages 50 , The Epic “reimagined recreation center” for all ages, Grand Prairie's Public Safety Building, and future home of PlayGrand Adventures all-inclusive playground. Amenities include five lakes, a grand lawn, boardwalk, and pad sites for future retail opportunities.\n\nVisit EpicCentral.com\n\nGolf\n\nIn addition to private golf courses and a country club, the city's two public top-ranked golf courses offer outstanding golf at a great price. The city’s Tangle Ridge Golf Course features bentgrass greens in a Hill Country atmosphere, and Prairie Lakes Golf Course offers one of the best golf values in the area with the largest practice putting green in Texas.\n\nLake Parks\n\nOne of the newest lakes in Texas, Joe Pool Lake, is set among the rolling hills of south Grand Prairie. Fishing, boating, swimming and skiing are popular here. The lake’s Lynn Creek Park features boat ramps, picnic sites, beaches, volleyball, a playground, restrooms and loads of natural beauty. The lake parks offer visitors a grand experience – clean beaches, shaded trails and ideal camping. And now you can camp in style at Loyd Park in a fully stocked camping cabin. Loyd Park offers cabins, wooded camp sites, trails, showers and restrooms. On the north shore, just off Lake Ridge Parkway, Lynn Creek Marina features boat slips, rentals, boat ramps and fishing supplies for the angler. Adjacent to the marina, the Oasis – a floating restaurant – overlooks the waters of the lake and serves up delicious fare and beverages.\n\nMore Information: Grand Prairie Parks, Arts & Recreation Department\n\nProperty Tax Rates\n\nThe combined FY 2023-24 property tax rate of all taxing jurisdictions in the City of Grand Prairie varies because the city's boundaries overlap with six school districts and three counties.\n\nThe two predominant taxing areas in Grand Prairie are Dallas County/Grand Prairie Independent School District and Tarrant County/Arlington Independent School District.\n\nProperty Tax Rates (2023) Per $100 Assessed Property Value City of Grand Prairie $0.66000 Grand Prairie ISD $1.095050 Arlington ISD $1.115600 Cedar Hill ISD $1.132600 Mansfield ISD $1.149200 Dallas County $0.215718 Tarrant County $0.194500\n\nAverage Annual City Property Tax Paid on a $237,000 Home with Homestead Exemption: $1,330\n\nDallas County*\n\nTarrant County*\n\nJurisdiction Tax rate Jurisdiction Tax rate City of Grand Prairie $.66000 City of Grand Prairie $.66000 Dallas County $.215718 Tarrant County $.194500 Parkland Hospital $.219500 Tarrant County Hospital $.194500 Dallas County Community College $.110028 Tarrant County College $.1121700 Grand Prairie ISD $1.095050 Arlington ISD $1.115600 Cedar Hill ISD $1.132600 Mansfield ISD $1.149200\n\n*Visit the Dallas Central Appraisal District (DCAD) website and the Tarrant Appraisal District (TAD) website for more information on calculating your property taxes.\n\nSales Tax\n\nThe combined local and state sales tax is 8.25 percent (6.25 percent state, 2 percent city - effective April 1, 2002).
