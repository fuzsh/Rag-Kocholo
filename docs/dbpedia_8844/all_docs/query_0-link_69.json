        "text": "Great bar/Grill spot\n\nNot very little local bar and grill. Plenty of room inside and outdoor seating as well when weather is good. Staff and service is awesome. We ordered burgers and they were well above average. They have a full bar and great beer choices. It's not too loud for a business meeting and a great lunch spot. Prices are fair.\n\ndagcoin\n\nTrip Advisor\n\nLots of parking, clean in the restrooms and in the restaurant, and family-friendly! Lots of options for food even a kid's menu. They even have a big free room for events, but if you order food a 20% gratuity is included on any food or drink ordered! The owner is great at communication as well. Highly recommend this place to so many.\n\nCrystal Atkinson\n\nGoogle\n\nGot the French Dip and holy hell it is great! Service was awesome! The sandwich was all meat no fat and finely diced just the way it should be! Great place. Very local feel. Will be back many times after this experience.\n\nBrad L.\n\nYelp\n\nWe called in a to go order, and pick up was very quick. But more importantly, the breakfast pizza was delicious! I didn't expect my younger kids to like it, but they not only loved it, they wanted more! I cant wait to try the chicken fried steak pizza next time. I did also get the fried pickles, which were good, but probably won't order them again. I love fried pickles, but these weren't my favorite. Just my preference. Nothing against the fried pickles here. Will definitely be returning!\n\nJenn W\n\nGoogle\n\nI'm not a pizza fan but theirs might have turned me. Cooked to perfection with a light crust. Fried pickles were also really good. It was pretty packed but service was friendly and fast. We will be back.\n\nKathleen Ryan\n\nGoogle"
