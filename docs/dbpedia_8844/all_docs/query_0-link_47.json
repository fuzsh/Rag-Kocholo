        "text": "You can’t visit Wall without a stop at Wall Drug. Wall Drug is known for its worldwide billboard advertising, offering a sprawling, western-themed shopping complex with restaurants, “South Dakota Made” shopping, western clothing, photo ops and more. The attraction got its start when its founders began offering free ice water to parched travelers during the Great Depression. Today, it’s expanded to include a jackalope, roaring T.rex and replica of Mount Rushmore.\n\nWall is also home of the only National Grasslands Visitor Center in the country. The center focuses on providing information on the National Grasslands located throughout the Great Plains. More than 20 exhibits highlight the history, recreational opportunities, management and importance of protecting the prairies and the animals that depend on them.\n\nOther attractions near Wall include the Minuteman National Historic Site, the first site in the world dedicated to commemorating the events of the Cold War and Prairie Homestead featuring a hill side sod hut, as well as the Wounded Knee Museum, which is dedicated to telling the story of of Big Foot’s band of Miniconjou Lakota and the 7th Calvary massacre that left nearly 300 Lakota men, women and children dead. The museum is open May-October."
