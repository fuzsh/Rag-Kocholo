        "text": "Miles went on to become a key piece of Edmonton’s CFL dynasty in the 1950s. He played in five Grey Cups, winning three of them consecutively from 1954 to 1956. He was an all-star on both offence and defence.\n\nHe was inducted into the CFL Hall of Fame in 1980 and a field in Edmonton was named after him posthumously.\n\nMy grandparents, my mother Michelle and her six siblings were a Black family in Edmonton when it was much less diverse than it is today.\n\nRollie made a point to introduce himself to two new people every day in a personal effort to fight against racist misconceptions and stereotypes. Once, after seeing a billboard for black Vicks cough drops that featured an offensive stereotypical Black caricature, he contacted the company that put it up and had it removed.\n\nThe Prairie landscape went on to figure largely in my lyrics. Conditioning references the North Saskatchewan (“cold rivers”) while We Move Away cites the surrounding River Valley as one of the great reasons to stay in my home city (“We’ve got a forest in the middle of the town”). Oliver Square is a detailed topography of local landmarks and public figures from the mid-2000s (the retail hub has now been renamed Unity Square.)\n\nI became an official chronicler of events in the area when I was named Poet Laureate of Edmonton in 2009. I wrote a poem called Monuments (The City in Three Parts) that was strung up on flags hanging across Jasper Avenue, the city’s main street. It was a commentary on the nature of the city’s urban self-perception and how the space around us can influence how we see ourselves. The poem also discusses the value of natural and manufactured landmarks, such as the collapsed road that became an abandoned cliff colloquially known as the End of the World.\n\nWhen I won the Polaris Prize in 2021, it was important for me to shout out where I came from. When I said, “The Prairies got something to say,” it was a reference to Andre 3000’s speech at the 1995 Source Awards when OutKast won the award for Best New Rap Group.\n\nSHARE\n\nIf you’ve enjoyed The Prairies got something to say, please take a moment to share it.
