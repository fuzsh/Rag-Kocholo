        "text": "The black prairie goat (Oreamos nebraskansis) is a species of open grassland dwelling goat-antelope. this goat is a member of the American Mountain Goat family, being related to the North American Mountain Goat(Oreamnos americanus) and the Canyon Goat(Oreamnos harringtoni), but not as closely related to the domestic goat(Capra aegagrus hircus) as their appearance or name would otherwise suggest.\n\nwithin the Oreamnos genus, it appears that the Black prairie Goat diverged around 900,000 years ago, when a population of Oreamnos began to move it the lowland prairies. scientists are not sure of these goats diverged from either the mountain goat, the canyon goat, or the common ancestor of the entire genus, but it is genetically confirmed that the prairie goat's closest relatives are the mountain goat and the canyon goat.\n\nit lives through out the grasslands and bush country of the Great Plains, and range from Utah and Southern California to central Mexico to Alberta and to Kentucky and Indiana. they are also found in the Oregon high desert region. they can survive at elevations of 9,000 feet above sea level, but at these altitudes, they tend to stick to the open plateaus as much as they can, and they avoid steep, rocky slopes for the most part. black prairie goats are also able to live in semi-deserts as well.\n\nas the name foreshadows, this goat is named for its black fur. in a unique evolutionary development, the fur of the black prairie goat is designed to keep the goat cool during the summer daytime heat by acting as a form of insulation(similar to a camel's wool), and to keep it warm enough during the summer night. this allows the black-colored animal to be active during the hottest part of the day with less fear of dehydration. during the winter, these goats grow an extra outer layer of black wool. they grow to be 4 feet long, can be 2 feet tall, and weigh up to 120 pounds. they are intermediate in size between the mountain goat and the canyon goat. the males' horns reach lengths of 5-7 inches.\n\nlike most all goats, the black prairie goat is a mixed feeder; one minute they'll graze on grasses and sedges, the next they'll be browsing on shrubs. these goats can go without directly drinking water for up to 4 days, and can extract a considerable amount of moisture from their food to help them last that long; this is an adaptation for life in semi-arid regions. they live in family herds of 2-3 dozen. they will feed alongside other herbivores such as peccaries, cervids, horses, capybara, camelids, buffalo, elephants, and pronghorns.\n\nduring the rut, males become territorial and will form harems of females and fight off male competitors. gestation lasts about 3.5 months. prairie goats usually give birth to 2-4 young. by the time they are 10 months old, black prairie goats are able to look after themselves, and usually leave their mother's side at that age.\n\nthey are preyed on mainly by the cheetah cat and running hyena. it is estimate that these two predators combined take more than 75% of all black prairie goat that are lost to predation. they see occasional predation by grizzlies, jaguars, coyotes, ocelots, Cougars, grey wolves, bulldog bears, and Brown Dogs.\n\nbeing peaceful herbivores, farmers and ranchers tend to tolerate the presence of black prairie goats in their grazing pastures. in most of their states of occurrence, it is legal to hunt this goat, though regulations vary from state to state, as well as the bag limits. the main calibers used for hunting this goat are the .30 Carbine and the .243 cartridges, as well as arrows and crossbow bolts. these goats are hunted for their meat, wool, and leather. the main man-made danger to these goats are dangerous chemicals applied to their prairie vegetation, as well as roads.\n\ndespite having seen large sections of its range converted into farmland and residence areas, the range of the black prairie goat is as large as ever, and the IUCN recognizes it as a \"Least Concern\" species."
