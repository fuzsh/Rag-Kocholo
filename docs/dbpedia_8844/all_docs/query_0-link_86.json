        "text": "The Mary Tyler Moore Show\n\n“The Mary Tyler Moore Show” was required viewing throughout the 1970s. Moore’s character of Mary Richards was a TV first: An independent career woman who led the fictional WJM newsroom and its \"Six O'Clock News\" segments.\n\nMinneapolis is a major piece of the show, with Lake of the Isles, Richards’ apartment, and an infamous hat toss sequence that was commemorated with a Nicollet Mall statue in 2002. The hat toss that symbolized Richards’ fresh start took place in 1970 at the corner of Nicollet Avenue and 7th Street, just outside of Donaldson’s department store, which burned down in the Thanksgiving Day fire of 1982. Today the statue marks a memorable TV event that’s been parodied by everyone from “The Simpsons” to Oprah Winfrey.\n\nBasil’s Restaurant in the IDS Center courtyard makes a famous appearance as Moore dines in the opening sequence. Meanwhile, the external shots of her apartment took place at 2104 Kenwood Parkway, a real-life private residence. During the show’s initial run, its owner famously put up signs to discourage tourists from visiting.\n\nThe Bachelorette\n\nDid you know Minneapolis boasts more \"Bachelorette\" contestants than any other destination? Fan favorites Becca Kufrin and Michelle Young put Minneapolis into the hearts of viewers with many dates taking place in Minnesota at spots like Target Field, U.S Bank Stadium, The Bell Museum, Mill City Museum, and more.\n\nLeslie Fhima, a contestant on the popular spinoff The Golden Bachelor showed Gerry the sights of her hometown of Minneapolis with stops at the Stone Arch Bridge, Mill Ruins Park and the North Loop neighborhood.\n\nLittle House on the Prairie\n\nLaura Ingalls Wilder’s nine novels inspired this long-running show about prairie life in the 1880s. The series was a hit in its day and still lives on in syndication.\n\nThough Wilder moved throughout her life, the TV version takes place near Walnut Grove in southwest Minnesota. The small town of just under 1,000 people still celebrates her legacy today. The location of the family’s dugout home is just outside of town, and the Laura Ingalls Wilder Museum is in the heart of town, just off Highway 14. The museum also hosts a live pageant every summer reenacting Laura's life on the prairie.\n\nThe show was filmed on a TV set built in California to replicate the late 1800s environment, but the museum includes many scale models from the show as well as real-life relics from the Wilder family and her novels. There are seven buildings in total, open seasonally, that emphasize the pioneering experience through a mixture of family-focused entertainment, history and memorabilia.\n\nCoach\n\n“Coach” followed a divorced father, Fox, who reconnects with his college-aged daughter. Fox lived in a cedar-paneled home on the lake, frequently going for walks or going fishing when stress overcame him.\n\nAt the time of the show, there was no Minnesota State University, but many noted that Mankato was similarly close to the Twin Cities and boasted a university with a gold and purple color scheme similar to the Screaming Eagles.\n\nThe show played heavily on Minnesota culture, with references to ice fishing, cold weather and a strong emphasis on core family. With a primary character who was a TV reporter for a Twin Cities station, it captured Minnesota’s urban-rural blend that connects over family, football and the outdoors.\n\nCampus shots were actually of the University of Iowa (show creator Barry Kemp’s alma mater), but the dialogue was heavily Minnesota-centric. In 1998, after the show’s run, Mankato State University changed its name to Minnesota State University Mankato for unrelated reasons.\n\nThe Rocky & Bullwinkle Show\n\nA play on International Falls’ motto as “icebox of the nation,” show creator Jay Ward spoofed the town with Frostbite Falls, home of Rocket J. Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose. The cartoon variety show captured the Cold War era perfectly as the two title characters took place in the race to the moon, foreign espionage, and all manner of timeless buffoonery.\n\nBesides boasting more freezing temperatures than any other incorporated city in the continental United States, International Falls is also home to stoic beauty. The Rainy River forms a natural border with Canada, where visitors can take the Fort Frances-International Falls International Bridge into Ontario and back.\n\nVoyageurs National Park, Smokey Bear Park and the Bronko Nagurski Museum are all nearby. Bullwinkle’s native island of Moosylvania is completely fictional, though the show’s producers pulled a publicity stunt in 1963, leasing an island near Lake of the Woods and petitioning President John F. Kennedy for statehood.\n\nFargo\n\nMinnesota natives Ethan and Joel Coen confused the world with their 1996 film “Fargo,” which took place mostly in Brainerd despite the North Dakota-based title. The current TV series takes the Coens’ quirky and dark tone of seedy small-town life across the state, setting season one mostly in Bemidji, season two in southwest Luverne, and season three in St. Cloud, Eden Valley and Eden Prairie.\n\nSeason five premieres this fall and takes place in Scandia, a charming small town with strong Nordic influences. While the show was filmed elsewhere, viewers may see glimpses of landmarks throughout the town like the Gammelgården Museum, an open air museum devoted to preserving, presenting and promoting Swedish immigrant heritage in the United States.\n\nThe show's character-building scenes often feature generic, period-focused housing and businesses, but \"Fargo\" brings local landmarks to life during its most dramatic moments. Duluth’s Aerial Lift Bridge makes an iconic appearance in season one, and the tension continues to build underneath the shadow of Bemidji’s Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox statues in episode nine. The giant and colorful statues were first built in 1937, celebrating the logging history of Bemidji for 80 years."
