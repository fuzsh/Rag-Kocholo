        "text": "Prairie dogs are members of the Scuiridae family and are closely related to ground squirrels and chipmunks. They’re a bit larger than their relatives, ranging from 28 to 33 centimeters in length and weighing up to 1.7 kilograms. Though not as long and fluffy as ground squirrels, prairie dogs have tails with different coloring depending on the species. Two species of prairie dog are named for their tail colors—the black-tailed prairie dog and the white-tailed prairie dog. Other species can have tails with both white and grey coloring.\n\nPrairie dogs are known for making complex burrows underground, where they sleep throughout the year and stay warm during winter. During the moderate months, they spend most of the day foraging for their foods of choice—leafy plants, seeds, grasses, and roots during the fall. They stay close to their burrows to use them for shelter when a predator comes within range. Loud cries similar to a dog’s bark alert other colony members to the danger and signal them to take cover.\n\nWhile colonies can consist of hundreds of millions of prairie dogs, they live in smaller family groups within these colonies. These groups contain one male, a few females, and their young. Families hunt together, share food, groom each other, and even play together. Mating happens in late winter or early spring, and females give birth to litters of up to 10 young after one month's gestation.\n\nPrairie dogs serve their ecosystems by sharing their burrows with various other organisms. Snakes, owls, camel spiders, insects, rabbits, and even their own predators like black-footed ferrets can all be found living in prairie dog burrows. These burrows also promote water flow underground, which can benefit other animals and even humans living in dry areas. The act of digging burrows is environmentally beneficial because it stimulates the soil and encourages plant growth.\n\nWhat is a prairie dog’s scientific name?\n\nThe prairie dog’s scientific name is Cynomys, and it refers to a genus of five species of burrowing rodents native to North America. In Greek, Cynomys means ‘dog mouse’ and refers to their dog-like warning calls and small size.\n\nThe five species of prairie dogs and their scientific names are:\n\nGunnison’s prairie dog (Cynomys gunnisoni)\n\nWhite-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys leucurus)\n\nBlack-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus)\n\nMexican prairie dog (Cynomys mexicanus)\n\nUtah prairie dog (Cynomys parvidens)\n\nAre prairie dogs endangered?\n\nOf the five species of prairie dog, two are listed on the IUCN Red List as endangered. The Utah prairie dog and the Mexican prairie dog both have very small ranges, the Utah prairie dog in Utah and the Mexican prairie dog in Coahuila, Nuevo León, and San Luis Potosí. Their numbers are continuing to decline as human activities threaten their habitats.\n\nThe other three species, the black-tailed prairie dog, Gunnison’s prairie dog, and the white-tailed prairie dog, are listed as least concern. However, all three also show decreasing population trends and suffer from a range of threats such as disease, habitat loss, predation, and human activity.\n\nWhere do prairie dogs live?\n\nThe different species of prairie dogs live in different areas throughout North America.\n\nThe Mexican prairie dog lives in a small pocket of land in the middle of Mexico, covering parts of the northeastern states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and San Luis Potosí.\n\nThe range of the Utah prairie dog has declined by about 90% over the past century, and it now inhabits an area of just 28 square kilometers in the state of Utah.\n\nGunnison’s prairie dogs live in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, and white-tailed prairie dogs can be found in the Rocky Mountain valleys of eastern Wyoming.\n\nThe black-tailed prairie dog is both the most well-known and widespread species—they can be found anywhere from the Canadian prairies of Saskatchewan to northern Mexico.\n\nAll five species live in grassland habitats that can sustain their herbivorous diets and sleep underground in elaborate interconnected burrows. Some prairie dog ‘towns’ or colonies can cover hundreds of acres and house millions of prairie dogs.\n\nWhat do prairie dogs eat?\n\nPrairie dogs are herbivores and eat a range of plants and grasses. They generally get most of their nutrients and water from the moisture-rich plants they eat, and they spend most of the daylight hours above ground foraging for these plants. In spring, they eat mostly leafy green plants. In the summer, they eat more seeds. In the winter, they eat stems and roots.\n\nWhere do prairie dogs live?\n\nPrairie dogs live in North America’s plains, plateaus, and valleys. The largest recorded prairie dog colony in Texas had an estimated 400 million members.\n\nHow long do prairie dogs live?\n\nThe lifespan of prairie dogs differs between the sexes. Females live for eight years, while males live for five years.\n\nDo prairie dogs hibernate?\n\nPrairie dogs don’t hibernate, but they do engage in a similar behavior during the coldest days of winter called torpor. They still eat extra food to fatten up for winter so they can survive even if they can’t find food as often. When it’s too cold, they lower their body temperature, breathing rate, and metabolic rate to reserve energy and deal with the cold conditions. However, in torpor, prairie dogs remain awake and still conduct normal activities, just at a slower pace.\n\nAre prairie dogs rodents?\n\nYes, prairie dogs are a group of five burrowing, colony-forming rodent species from the squirrel family. They also look fairly similar to ground squirrels, though they lack fluffy tails and have different coloring.\n\nAre prairie dogs endangered?\n\nTwo of the five species of prairie dogs are endangered—the Utah prairie dog and the Mexican prairie dog. The estimated population of Utah prairie dogs is 8,000, with intensive poisoning efforts in the 20th century contributing to their decline. The Mexican prairie dog is found only in a 499-square-kilometre area in Mexico close to Monterrey. Their population is currently unknown, and they have lost at least 65% of their former habitat due to land use conversion, primarily for agriculture.\n\nWhat is a group of prairie dogs called?\n\nA large group of prairie dogs is called a colony or a town and is made up of smaller family groups called coteries. They make expansive burrow systems underground and live in groups that can consist of hundreds of millions of individuals—so even ‘town’ can be an understatement. Many other species that can’t dig their burrows also live in prairie dog towns, such as black-footed ferrets, desert cottontail rabbits, camel spiders, insects, prairie rattlesnakes, and more."
