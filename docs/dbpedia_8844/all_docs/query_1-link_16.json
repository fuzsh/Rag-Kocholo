        "text": "John Biewen\n\nIn setting out to understand what happened in southern Minnesota in 1862, I called up Gwen Westerman. She agreed to spend a few days with me driving around the state to the spots where it all occurred, so I could tell the story here on the radio.\n\nWe meet up in Mankato. I grew up there but haven't lived there for 30 years. She's lived and taught there for the last 20 years.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nMore people probably know about the town of Mankato than realize it.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nThat's us, in Gwen's SUV.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nBecause in the television series Little House On The Prairie, the Ingalls family lived in Walnut Grove. And whenever Ma and Pa wanted to get away from the kids, they came to Mankato.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nGwen's an English professor at Minnesota State University in Mankato and a member of the Dakota tribe. She's in her 50s like me. She grew up in Kansas, part of the Dakota diaspora. A lot of her family was banished from Minnesota after the 1862 war-- not that she's always known that herself.\n\nSee, I grew up in Mankato, a white kid knowing next to nothing about the bloody history that happened beneath my feet. Gwen got a teaching job and moved to Mankato, also knowing nothing about that history. She found out later that some older people in her family did know.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nThen, when I took the job here at MSU, my father and my uncle would say, well, we'll see how long you last there. But they never did explain why they had questions about whether I would stay here or not.\n\nSo, December 26, 1993, I had a friend who worked at the university. She said, there are Indians coming. She was also Indian. She said, there are Indians coming. Let's go see what they're doing.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nThat's all she said?\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nThat's all she said. So I said, OK. She came and picked me up.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nGwen didn't know it, but she and her friend Kimberly were going to see the annual ceremony for the Dakota warriors who were hanged in the town square in 1862.\n\nThey arrived late for the ceremony and stood in the back for the prayers and songs. They still didn't know what the event was about. And then it was over.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nKimberly and I got back in the car and she was driving. And she started to pull around the corner of the building. And I don't know if your parents drove fast on back country roads when you were small, up and down the hills.\n\nWe used to love it when my parents would do that because you'd go over the top of the hill and then your stomach would kind of come up. But as we rounded the corner of the building, my stomach came up just like that. And I started to sob.\n\nAnd Kimberly stopped the car and said, what's wrong? What's wrong? And I told her I had no idea what was wrong. It was incredible sadness. I didn't really say anything to anybody about that until a few days later when I called my uncle and explained to him what had happened.\n\nAfter I finished my story, he was quiet for a long time. Then he finally said, well, my girl, you're connected to that place. You are physically and spiritually connected to that place.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nCome on.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nThat's crazy.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nYeah, so I don't-- how do you explain it? I didn't know what had happened here.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nAfter that, she learned all about it-- how the Dakota chief who led the uprising in 1862-- Little Crow-- was the brother of her great-great-great-great-grandmother. Another relative, Mazamani, was killed in the last battle of the war. Now she is so steeped in it, she co-wrote a book about the history of the Dakota people in Minnesota.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nThe sign is faded-- \"Historic site to the right.\"\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nOn a gravel farm road an hour and a half from Mankato, there's an oddly placed historic marker.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nHere?\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nTo find it, you have to pull into somebody's driveway. The yard is sheltered by pine trees.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nWe've driven on to a farm site with a classic, weathered red barn and outbuildings, a small house that looks newer, complete with an American flag and a satellite dish.\n\nAnd then, right in the middle of their yard, is a marble monument.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nIt's a short obelisk etched with the names of five white settlers who were killed here by Dakota men in August of 1862. This was the incident that started the US-Dakota War. Gwen reads a steel plaque that was put up in the 1960s--\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nThe Acton Incident-- on a bright Sunday afternoon, August 17, 1862, for young, Sioux hunters, on a spur-of-the-moment dare, decided to prove their bravery by shooting Robinson Jones.\n\nStopping at his cabin, they requested liquor and were refused. Then Jones, followed by the seemingly friendly Indians, went to the neighboring Howard Baker cabin, which stood on this site.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nIt's hard for me to picture the story this plaque tells. It says the Dakotas and the white man went to a neighbor's cabin-- right here where the monument is now-- and got into a target-shooting contest. Maybe that's what people did with passing strangers on the frontier in 1862. Then the plaque says the Indians suddenly turned on the whites and shot three men, and two women dead.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nThe Indians fled south to their village, 40 miles away on the Minnesota River. There, they reported what they had done, and the Sioux chiefs decided to wage an all-out war against the white man.\n\nThus, the unplanned shooting of five settlers here at Acton triggered the bloody Sioux uprising of 1862. They decided to wage an all-out war against the white man.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nYou shook your head at that part.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nI did. It's as if it were that there was nothing that led up to this. It leaves out so much. But it's a small monument. You can't get everything on there.\n\n[CAR DOORS SHUTTING]\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nTo get some of the story that's not on the sign, Gwen and I drive to a small museum. From the outside, it looks like one of those wayside rest buildings. It sits on a highway 15 miles north of Mankato, just outside the town where I went to college, St. Peter.\n\nBen Leonard\n\nSo this is our cleverly called \"Intro Room.\"\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nBen Leonard's tall and lanky. He directs this museum-- The Traverse des Sioux Treaty Site.\n\nBen Leonard\n\nI've been here since 2004. And, for the record, I'm a 36-year-old white guy from North Carolina.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nReally?\n\nOur Carolina connection noted, we have the required conversation about college hoops--\n\nBen Leonard\n\nAt a time when Duke basketball--\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nThen get down to the reason Gwen and I are here. This museum, with its big, central room of maps and panels, gives the history that led to the 1862 war.\n\nFirst, the basics-- the Dakota have lived in Minnesota at least 1,000 years and maybe a lot longer. They vastly outnumbered any Europeans who showed up until the mid-1800s, when white people started flooding in.\n\nAnd you can probably guess what happened next, because it happened all across the country. The country's leaders, going back to the founders, talked bluntly about prying land out of Indian hands. I'd never realized just how bluntly until talking to Ben. On the wall of the museum is a blown-up text from a letter I'd never seen. Thomas Jefferson wrote it in 1803.\n\nBen Leonard\n\nJefferson basically says, look, we want Indian land. But they're not just going to give it to us. So we have to motivate them to sign treaties. And the way that we do that is going to be to get them into debt.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nAll right. How did Jefferson really say that?\n\nBen Leonard\n\nHe said it hither-- the quote is here. \"To promote the disposition to exchange lands, we shall push our trading houses and be glad to see the good and influential individuals among them run in debt. Because we observe that when these debts get beyond what individuals can pay, they are willing to lop them off by the session of lands.\" So that's fairly matter-of-fact.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nIt's pretty straightforward. That's what he said.\n\nAnd that's exactly what happened in the Minnesota territory. By 1851, the Dakota had come to rely on things they got from white traders-- guns, food, horses, kettles, and blankets, and traps. They were deep in debt, at least according to the traders themselves. And they were the ones keeping track. Here's Gwen.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nAnd the government calls them in again to say, we'll help you with your debt, if you sell your land.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nBen, could you sort of sum up what was the deal essentially?\n\nBen Leonard\n\nIf you look at a map of Minnesota today, land-wise we're talking about basically, everything south of Interstate 94. So we're talking essentially about the lower half of Minnesota.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nPlus some pieces of what would become Iowa and South Dakota. In two big treaties, one of them signed very near to the spot where the museum sits, the Dakota people traded away 35 million acres for about $3 million, which was a better price than some other tribes got.\n\nThe treaties set aside a reservation for the Dakota-- 10 miles on either side of the Minnesota River stretching for 150 miles, a skinny strip in the middle of the vast territory the Dakota were giving up.\n\nThey didn't have much choice. They could see what was coming from the east-- a tidal wave of white settlers hungry for farm land, statehood, settlement. The white negotiators didn't have to say it out loud, but one of them did anyway. A guy named Luke Lea reminded the Dakota chiefs that the US government, quote, \"could come with 100,000 men and drive you off to the Rocky Mountains.\"\n\nA leading negotiator for the whites during these treaty deals was a man named Henry Sibley. Nobody was more important in the creation of the state of Minnesota. He'd later become its first governor.\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nThe treaty couldn't have happened without Henry Sibley.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nTo learn more about Sibley, I talked to this historian.\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nI'm Mary Wingerd, and I wrote a book called North Country-- The Making of Minnesota.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nAnd it's pretty much the definitive history of Minnesota up to and including the US-Dakota War, isn't it?\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nWell, I'm not going to say that. But yes, it is.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nWingerd says Henry Sibley moved in from Detroit in the 1830s. He was just 23. The American Fur Company gave him a big job overseeing the southern half of what's now Minnesota.\n\nSibley had a child with a Dakota woman. He understood the Dakota language. He went before Congress criticizing treaties that, quote, \"betrayed and deceived Indians.\"\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nAnd, as a young man, he just relished spending his time with the Dakota. And he would go out and hunt with them and really fostered good relations with them.\n\nBut the fur trade was a dying business. It was, economically, a dying business when he came here.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nBy this time, the region had been over-hunted. Revenues were down. And everyone, from managers like Sibley to local traders on the frontier, down to the Dakota men who did the actual hunting, was in hock to the fur company, who would advance them money for all the supplies, traps, and guns.\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nEven though he may seem to be the big man in Minnesota, he is buried in debt. By 1849, he was really looking around for some other way to make a living. But he couldn't get out of the trade until he could pay his debts.\n\nBecause of his financial difficulties, he really played the Dakota people false.\n\nSibley wrote to Pierre Chouteau, who held most of Sibley's debt. He boasted to him-- \"The Indians are all prepared to make a treaty when we tell them to do so. And such a one as I may dictate. I think I may safely promise you that no treaty can be made without our claims being first secured.\"\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nSibley and Chouteau said the Dakota owed them a lot of money. Those are the claims he's talking about. And they saw the treaties as a way to get paid. The way it happened was pretty ugly.\n\nTake the treaty signed it Traverse des Sioux. The treaty was copied into the Dakota language for the chiefs to discuss. But their copy left out a key fact-- the government wasn't going to give the Dakota their payment in a lump sum, as the Dakota wanted and expected.\n\nInstead, the money would stay in the hands of the government to be doled out in much smaller, annual payments-- not just in gold, but also food and things like farming equipment.\n\nThe treaty did provide $305,000 in cash right away, most of it so the Dakota could quote-unquote \"settle their affairs.\" After the signing of the treaty, Sibley's allies took the chiefs aside to sign a second document. The chiefs later said they thought it was just another copy of the treaty. But, in fact, they were agreeing to hand over most of that $305,000 to the traders, all but $60,000 to settle their debts.\n\nSo the traders got their money. Sibley himself walked away with $66,000-- more cash than the Dakota people got. Again, Mary Wingerd--\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nThat cleared him. That cleared his debts. That allowed him to get out of the trade. He has to know what he's doing. When he is faced with a moral dilemma of deal fairly with these people who have been my friends or take advantage of this opportunity to get out of this situation that I hate, he chooses his own self-interest.\n\nAnthony Morse\n\nDid you get a trail map or anything like that when you came in?\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nNo, we didn't.\n\nAnthony Morse\n\nWe have some in there.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nGwen Westerman and I have driven west, out on the prairie, for the next bit of the story-- the build-up to the war. We've come to the Lower Sioux Agency. This was the federal government's outpost on Dakota land, near Redwood Falls, Minnesota. Sioux was the white man's name for the Dakota.\n\nAnthony Morse\n\nOh, yeah, my name's Anthony Morris. I'm a ninth generation Lower Sioux Mdewakanton. My family's been here for at least 150 years. We actually have a picture of my seven-times great-grandfather in the museum here.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nMorse is just 26. He wears glasses and a wispy beard. He directs the historic site.\n\nThe government's two-story stone warehouse is still here, surrounded by open grassland. In 1862, it was stocked with government food shipments for distribution to the Dakota. These were paid out once a year under the terms of the treaty.\n\nAnthony Morse\n\nOK, so in 1862, where they're coming off a bad crop year in 1861, there's a lot of bad feelings that are brewing. They're really waiting for that annuity payment in June. They're waiting for their food and gold.\n\nThe local area here would really look about like it would right now.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nThe annual federal shipment of gold and food promised in the 1851 treaty did not arrive on schedule in June. July passed and it didn't come. In the decade since the Dakota signed away their land, Minnesota had become a state. The white population exploded from 5,000 in 1850 to more than 170,000.\n\nPut another way, in 1850, Indians outnumbered whites in Minnesota 5 to 1. By 1860, it was the other way around.\n\nAnd the Dakota were being squeezed into less and less space. Washington changed the terms of their treaties, took half the reservation back, and forced them to accept the new terms.\n\nThis didn't go down well. Minnesota's leaders thought that everything would be fine if the Dakota would just give up hunting, which required lots of land, and take up farming. Some did, cut their hair, raised crops.\n\nBut, as you'd expect, a lot of Dakota wanted to live as they always had. Dakota man had always been hunters. Farming was seen as women's work. Hemmed in on their skinny reservation, lots of people couldn't feed themselves. By that August, things were desperate.\n\nAnthony Morse\n\nThey were allowing their children to eat the unripened fruit off the trees, because they had to eat something. However, this unripened fruit would then make them sick. They would be even worse. And some people would end up dying because of these problems.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nMeanwhile, the federal agent had food in the warehouse. But he refused to give it out to the Dakota until their full June payment arrived. Dakota men confronted a store-keeper named Andrew Myrick, asking him for help or credit.\n\nWhat do you expect us to feed our families?\n\nAnthony Morse\n\nAnd he said to let him eat grass. He considered them, basically, like livestock. They were considered animals to him.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nThere are some versions of that story that say Andrew Myrick said, let them eat grass or their own dung.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nIn 200 years, there hadn't been much violence between Indians and whites in Minnesota. But in August of 1862, Dakota country was ready to blow up. Maybe the only question was, where would the spark come from?\n\nThat brings us back to the part of the story where Gwen and I began, in that farmyard in Acton, where the four young Dakota men killed the five settlers. There are other versions of the story. One comes from a Dakota, who spoke with the four young men, that don't include the Indians asking for liquor or the target-shooting contest.\n\nThe story ends the same way, though, with five settlers dead.\n\nAnthony Morse\n\nAfter the Acton massacre, the four boys rode back to the Lower Sioux Agency. That's where their village was located. They went back to their chief and relayed to him what they had done in Acton.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nThis is Anthony Morse again.\n\nAnthony Morse\n\nAnd so their chief called a meeting with more chiefs and they eventually called a council with all of the chiefs of Lower Sioux at one of Little Crow's houses, I believe.\n\nThere they had their counsel on what they should do.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nLittle Crow was one of the leaders who signed the 1851 treaty that turned out so badly for the Dakota. When the chiefs and some riled up young men showed up at his house in the middle of the night, Little Crow said the white world would come down hard on all the Dakota, not just the four men who'd been at Acton.\n\nA lot of the young warriors said the Dakota should attack first. Enough is enough, let's drive the whites out. But Little Crow wanted no part of that. He'd been to Washington, D.C. In those days the government liked to invite American Indian leaders to the capital to show them how powerful the new white man's country was.\n\nGwen Westerman, my traveling companion, is related to Little Crow. Like I said, her great-great-great-great-grandmother was the chief's sister. She says Little Crow-- whose name in Dakota is Ta Oyate Duta-- was one of many Dakota trying to adjust to the white culture and find a place in it.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nAnd, at this time, Ta Oyate Duta was living in a house and farming, trying--\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nAnd going to church.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\n--and going to church. Had cut his hair. And he was trying to establish a homestead here-- because this is Dakota homeland-- in the hopes-- I think-- of being able to stay here.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nAt first, when the young men started calling for war, what was Ta Oyate Duta's reaction, his take?\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nNo. We can't fight. We have a responsibility to stay on this land and to live. And he knew that if the Dakota went to war against the United States, that all of that effort would be lost.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nEveryone argued about what to do. Little Crow made a speech that his son years later recited to a lawyer, who had it translated and written down. We asked an actor to read it.\n\nActor\n\nBraves, you're like little children. You know not what you are doing. See, the white men are like the locusts when they fly so thick that the whole sky is a snowstorm. You may kill 1, 2, 10-- yes, as many as the leaves in the forest yonder-- and their brothers will not miss them.\n\nKill 1, 2, 10, and 10 times 10 will come to kill you. Yes, they fight among themselves away off.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nHe's talking about the Civil War going on, to the southeast.\n\nActor\n\nDo you hear the thunder of their big guns? No. It would take you two moons to run down to where they are fighting. And all the way your path would be among white soldiers, as thick as tamaracks in the swamps of the Ojibwes.\n\nYes, they fight among themselves. But if you strike at them, they will all turn on you and devour you, and your women, and little children.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nThe young warriors called Little Crow a coward. His response--\n\nActor\n\nTa Oyate Duta is not a coward. And he is not a fool. When did he run away from his enemies? When did he leave his braves behind him on the warpath and turn back to his tepee? You are fools.\n\nBraves, you are little children. You will die like the rabbits when the hungry wolves hunt them in the hard moon. Ta Oyate Duta is not a coward. He will die with you.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nMost of Little Crow's band, along with men from other Dakota bands, decided to go to war. Historian Mary Wingerd calls the fighters a group of rash, young men. She says this is a crucial point that's often missed when the story of the conflict is told in Minnesota.\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nIt is a complete myth that all the Dakota people went to war against the United States. So I have a little bit of trouble with calling it a war, actually. I know that that is the preferred terminology now. But they would get the idea that all the Dakota agreed that they were going to go to war the way the United States would go to war.\n\nBut, in fact, of course, that wasn't the case. It was a faction that went on the offensive. And many people, particularly the Sissetons and Wahpetons, were opposed and wanted no part of it.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nMany men in those two bands did not fight. Over the coming weeks, the war and peace factions had angry debates and almost went to war with each other. Gwen Westerman tells me her own family was split. And she's not sure who did the right thing.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nOne of my three-greats grandfathers in 1862 was with Sweet Corn's band, out on the prairie hunting buffalo. Another of my three-greats grandfathers was Mazamani, who was killed at the Battle at Wood Lake.\n\nAnother of my three-greats grandfathers was Ishtakhaba, or Sleepy Eye, who didn't want to fight at all. The decisions that people made that allowed them to survive so that I could stand here today-- you can't second-guess those.\n\nIra Glass\n\nComing up, a prairie home explosion. And, after it, a prairie home expulsion. That's in a minute, from Chicago Public Radio, when our program continues.\n\nIra Glass\n\nIt's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Our program today for the week after Thanksgiving-- \"Little War on the Prairie,\" the history of settlers and Dakota Indians in Minnesota. John Biewen first put this story together for our show a few years ago, on the 150th anniversary of the so-called Sioux uprising and the war it led to.\n\nDuring that anniversary year a few years back, probably more was said in Minnesota about these events than in the previous 100 years combined-- lots of newspaper articles and broadcasts and talks. Our guide to the story, John Biewen, grew up in Mankato. He now picks up the story where we left off before the break.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nSo the morning after Little Crow's speech, and after the murders at the Acton farm, August 18, 1862, several hundred Dakota warriors, led by Little Crow, started their assault at the federal outpost that sat on their land, the Lower Sioux Agency.\n\nThey took food from the stone warehouse, burned buildings, and killed about 20 men, one-fourth of the whites at the agency. The dead included the storekeeper who said that if Dakota families were hungry, they could eat grass. Again, Anthony Morse, who runs the agency's history center.\n\nAnthony Morse\n\nAndrew Myrick's body was found. He was more than likely fleeing from his home to the tall grass and the trees. However, he didn't quite make it. And his body was found filled with arrows and with grass stuffed in his mouth.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nMost of Minnesota's trained soldiers were off at the Civil War. When word of the attacks reached a nearby fort, some green, unprepared soldiers came to help. The Dakota ambushed them, killing almost everyone, and sending the rest fleeing for their lives.\n\nFrom there, the Dakota men fanned out down the river valley, attacking the homes of settlers, most of them unarmed. Joseph Godfrey was a young, black man, who lived among the Dakota. He testified later that fall, telling how Dakota warriors he was with went house to house. This is an actor reading.\n\nActor\n\nDinner was on the table. And the Indians said, \"After we kill, then we will have dinner.\" When we got near to a house, the Indians all got out and ran ahead of the wagons and two or three went to each house. And in that way, they killed all the people along the road.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nSome Dakota killed every settler they saw. Others killed only the men and took women and children captive. But many Dakota warriors spared and protected white people they knew. Even Chief Little Crow, the leader of the uprising, allowed a white woman named Sarah Wakefield, the wife of a local doctor, to take shelter in his house during the six weeks of the War.\n\nOne Dakota woman who opposed the fighting, named Snana, took in a 14-year-old German girl who had been captured by a warrior. Snana traded him a pony for the girl. Snana wrote down her story in 1901. Turns out, her daughter had died recently, and she was heartbroken.\n\nActor\n\nThe reason why I wished to keep this girl was to have her in place of the one I lost. So I loved her and pitied her. And she was dear to me, just the same as my own daughter. During the outbreak, when some of the Indians got killed, they began to kill some of the captives. At such times I always hid my dear captive white girl. I thought to myself that if they would kill my girl, they must kill me first.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nThe historian Mary Wingerd is a fifth-generation Minnesotan. She says for 100 years or more, Minnesotans who heard the story at all heard a one-sided tale of savage Indians attacking innocent whites out of the blue.\n\nNow most historians like herself blame the war mainly on white double-dealing and bullying.\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nBut I also think it's a mistake to try to pretend that there was no wrongs committed by the men who rode against the settlers. A minimum 400 innocent civilians were murdered, most of them who didn't even have weapons-- women and children.\n\nThe Dakota people were victims, big time. But most of the people who died were victims as well. The people who would have been worthy opponents in a war were untouchable.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nMeaning the men in St. Paul and Washington, D.C. who wrote, then violated, the treaties. The fighting lasted 36 days. Dakota warriors attacked New Ulm twice and looted and burned a couple other towns.\n\nWhite settlers turned into panicked refugees, fleeing across the prairie. And the man appointed to lead a force to defeat the Dakota? Henry Sibley. You remember Sibley, the fur trader who helped orchestrate the treaties of 1851.\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nWell, Sibley has no military experience whatsoever. But he does know the Dakota well. And he knows what great warriors they are. And he has the most hodgepodge troops ever. And he doesn't have enough weaponry.\n\nAnd so he's moving very slowly towards southwestern Minnesota. And, of course, every step of the way, the newspapers are excoriating him.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nThey called him a snail and a coward and the state undertaker, because Sibley's militia showed a knack for arriving after battles were over to help bury the dead.\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nThey accuse him of not really wanting to go after the Dakota, because he's really too close to them and all his sympathies are with them. So Sibley, with his very thin skin, is beside himself.\n\nAnd I think that that helps explain the really extraordinarily severe attitude he had toward all the Dakota people following the conflict I really think it was because he felt he was personally betrayed.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nSibley had seen himself as a friend to the Dakota. He believed they could take up farming and co-exist with white people in Minnesota. But now even some Dakota he knew-- men who had started to assimilate-- were murdering settlers.\n\nIn his letters, Sibley was bitter. Quote, \"A great public crime has been committed, not by wild Indians who did not know better, but by men who have had advantages, intercourse with white men.\"\n\nIn another he wrote, \"Tame the Indian. Cultivate him. Strive to Christianize him as you will. And the sight of blood will, in an instant, call out the savage, wolfish, devilish instincts in his race.\"\n\nYears before all this, Sibley had warned that if the federal government kept cheating Indians in treaties, the result would be war. Now that very thing was happening in his own state. And he himself had helped convinced the Indians to sign those crooked treaties. But there was no indication Sibley took any blame, says Wingerd.\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nTo me, it's perfectly plausible that he could deny to himself that all the things he did really hurt them. And if only they would accept the route to civilization and become farmers, they would be fine. If only they would do it this way, they would be OK.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nAltogether in the six-week war, somewhere between 400 and 1,000 white people died, most of them settlers. Not as many Dakota died-- maybe 50 to 100 in the war itself. But payback was still to come.\n\nActor\n\nOur course, then, is plain-- the Sioux Indians of Minnesota must be exterminated or driven forever beyond the borders of the state.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nThis is what Minnesota governor Alexander Ramsey said to a special session of the state legislature, during the war in September of 1862.\n\nActor\n\nIf any shall escape extinction, the wretched remnant must be driven beyond our borders and our frontier garrisoned with a force sufficient to forever prevent their return.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nIt's not surprising that white Minnesotans were enraged by the attacks. But things got extreme. A newspaper columnist named Jane Grey Swisshelm called for a bounty for Sioux scalps. And months later, the state started offering $75 each, and eventually $200.\n\nChief Little Crow and a couple hundred of the most militant warriors had fled west, out of Minnesota. The rest of the Dakota people gathered voluntarily at a makeshift camp on the prairie to wait for Colonel Henry Sibley.\n\nMost were women, children, and old men who had not participated in the killing. Here's Gwen again.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nThere are letters back and forth between Henry Sibley and the leaders on the Dakota side where he specifically said, come out under a flag of truce. You'll be protected. I'll protect you. You have my word.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nAnd like some other promises that had been made along the way--\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nThat one was not honored either.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nThe Dakota trusted Sibley's promise that only those who had murdered settlers would be punished. But the 1,700 Dakota civilians were marched 150 miles down the Minnesota River, a mini Trail of Tears. In towns along the way, white people attacked them with rocks, clubs, and knives.\n\nA half-Dakota man named Samuel Brown was long for the march, working for the government. He wrote in his diary that in the town of Henderson, a white woman grabbed a baby from a Dakota woman's arms and threw it at the ground, killing the baby.\n\nThe Dakota walked for a week, says historian Mary Wingerd, until they reached their destination near St. Paul.\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nWhat was essentially a concentration camp at Fort Snelling, where they were kept until the spring of 1863. And then they were transported to a reservation, Crow Creek, South Dakota. It was in Dakota Territory, which was the next best thing to hell. And the death toll was just shocking.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nHundreds of Dakota, mostly children and old people, died of disease over the winter in Fort Snelling. About 100 more died on boats that took them down the Mississippi and up the Missouri to Dakota Territory.\n\nStill more hundreds died at the South Dakota reservation. As Wingerd puts it, this was the thanks most of the Dakota got for opposing the war.\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nThey lost everything. They lost their lands. They lost all their annuities that were owed them from the treaties. These are people who are guilty of nothing.\n\n[WIND BLOWING]\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nOK, I'm going to get some sound of the wind here.\n\nGwen and I are back in Mankato, my hometown, where she now teaches at the State University. It's windy, but otherwise a nice day in October. We're in an old park, a favorite place of mine-- big trees with bright yellow leaves, picnic tables.\n\nAlongside the park, the Blue Earth River, that I canoed on as a kid, flows into the Minnesota River.\n\nAnd it was right down here, on this sandy river bank that my family used to build a fire and roast hot dogs and marshmallows and sit out here at night and have just a lovely time on a fall night like this.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nWe should have brought hot dogs.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nThis is where the Dakota men ended up-- the ones who turned themselves in after Henry Sibley promised to treat them fairly. Sibley set up a kangaroo court out on the prairie and tried 400 of them in a few weeks.\n\nHe didn't let the Dakota have lawyers or witnesses. Some trials lasted five minutes. He named a panel of five US soldiers who had just been fighting against the Dakota to hand out verdicts and death sentences.\n\nSibley's court condemned 303 Dakota men. A report was sent to President Lincoln on the plan to hang all of them. The president, fresh off the bloodiest day in American history at Antietam, was stunned by the long list. He ordered the Minnesotans to hold off on the hangings until his office could review the trial transcripts. So they waited right here. They called it Camp Lincoln.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nYou can imagine teepees and fires and tents, soldiers.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nShe points up at a high bluff across the river. Vengeful settlers would perch up there and shoot into the camp at the Dakota.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nThere were people who died here because of that. So a lot of people don't know that that's what was here. Or they think of Camp Lincoln, was near here, we don't know where. Or they don't think about it at all.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nI can tell you that growing up, I had no idea. Never heard of Camp Lincoln.\n\nFor me and most people in Mankato, this was just Sibley Park. That's right-- Sibley Park, named after the man who led the charge to shove the Dakota off their homeland to make way for-- well, people like me.\n\nThere's a Henry Sibley High School in the Twin Cities. Sibley County is just up the road from Mankato. Living in the South for more than a decade, I still shake my head a little at the highways and schools named after the great defenders of slavery-- Jeff Davis, Nathan Bedford Forrest.\n\nNow here I am, well into middle age, and it's just now sinking in-- in my hometown, Sibley Park.\n\nIn Washington, in the fall of 1862, President Lincoln was getting heated messages from the governor and others in Minnesota. They said he'd better allow the hanging of the 303 Dakota men or else furious white people might go vigilante.\n\nLynch mobs formed in Mankato and other towns and had to be quelled by soldiers. Newspapers told horrifying stories that Dakota warriors had mutilated babies and raped countless settler women, though very few of those claims were ever backed up. President Lincoln wired back to Minnesota.\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nAnd so Lincoln says, OK, so the ones who ought to be put to death are the ones who raped women. So go through these cases and identify the ones who are guilty of violating women. And, as it turns out, they can only find two cases of rape.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nAnd hanging two Indians would not satisfy the people of Minnesota, the president was told. So Lincoln had his people review the trial transcripts for evidence that the men had attacked settlers, and not just shown up at battles.\n\nIn the end, Lincoln himself wrote out a list of 39 Dakota names-- later trimmed to 38. The day after Christmas, those men were marched on to a big platform in Mankato's town square. Hoods were pulled over their heads.\n\n4,000 people had come from miles around to watch. The men held each other's hands and sang prayers till the moment the floor under them dropped away. They fell. And the chanting stopped.\n\nLittle Crow was shot six months after the hangings. And his scalp, skull, and wrist bones were displayed at the Minnesota Historical Society for decades. Mary Wingerd says, for a short time after the war, Minnesotans were triumphant at having beaten back the savage Indians. They relished the story.\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nSo there's lots of dime novels coming out and panoramas that are created. And the whole country is fascinated and mesmerized by this horrible thing that happened.\n\nWell, it doesn't take people in Minnesota very long to figure out, afterwards, this is really, really bad PR. This is not good. And how will we encourage people to come to Minnesota if they think they're going to be scalped the minute they step out of their cabin.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nSo, she says, Minnesotans clammed up about the nastiness of 1862. Instead, they embraced a gauzy, fantastical version of the state's Indian heritage.\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nThe message that boosters wanted to portray of Minnesota is that Minnesota was this beautiful, natural place and that we have these lovely legends of long-gone, noble savages.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nSo does that help explain how I could grow up in Minnesota 100 years later, in Mankato even, and not hear anything about all this history?\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nWell, yes. I think that explains a good part of it. I think people of your generation and my generation never really felt that Indians were really part of the past of this place-- that they were stories like Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nToday, visitors to Minneapolis can drive down Hiawatha Boulevard and visit Minnehaha Falls, references to Longfellow's romanticized poem, \"Song of Hiawatha.\" Countless Minnesota businesses use native names and imagery-- Land O'Lakes butter, with its Indian maiden on the box. There's a Little Crow country club. For years, the logo of the gas company-- Minnegasco-- was an Indian girl with a blue flame as the feather in her headdress.\n\nThere are probably other reasons white Minnesotans don't remember the US-Dakota War. I suspect a big one is we won. Mary Wingerd and Gwen Westerman both say they routinely meet students who've grown up in the area and arrive at college with no knowledge of the US-Dakota War-- never heard of it.\n\nCoach\n\nGirls, let's pick up the balls, please. Go grab a drink of water.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nI stopped by my old high school, Mankato West, to see what kids know now.\n\nCoach\n\nI need five upperclassmen over here, quick.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nThe girls' tennis coach rounded up a few seniors for an extremely unscientific survey.\n\nSo what do you know about-- it's usually called, these days, the Dakota War, the US-Dakota War?\n\nGirl 1\n\nI know it happened at the same time as the Civil War, which is why a lot of people don't know about it. But it was one of the biggest fights between Americans and the Native Americans.\n\nGirl 2\n\nAnd we just talk about it like every year, basically. It always comes up and they always say it's the biggest mass hanging. It's pretty sad that it had to happen here and that we're known for it.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nI did talk to other young people in southern Minnesota who knew nothing of the Dakota War. But things have changed since I was a kid. Every sixth grader in Minnesota is now supposed to learn about the war, at least a little.\n\nIt's a week-long unit in the state's Minnesota History textbook. In Mankato they do more. I met a teacher who spends twice as much time because of the local connection. Every third grader goes to a Dakota powwow in September. But the quality of the teaching varies.\n\nPatricia Hammann\n\nSo show me you're prepared.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nMonroe Elementary is just across the Minnesota River from the hanging site. Patricia Hammann is prepping her third grade class for the powwow. I asked her how she presents the war of 1862, standing with her in front of her students.\n\nPatricia Hammann\n\nWe just talked about, like a conflict is a disagreement. And we talked how the Dakota Indians didn't know how to solve their conflicts. And the only way they knew how to solve their disagreements was to fight, which we know, we don't fight when we solve conflicts. We use our words.\n\nBut that was their only way that they knew how to solve a conflict. They fought. And so then the white settlers needed to fight back to protect themselves. And then we talked about, people were killed. And then we talked about how the Dakota Indians were--\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nMy guess is that no Dakota children were in the room to take offense. In 1863, Congress passed a law confiscating all the Dakota's land in Minnesota. President Lincoln signed it, effectively banishing the Dakota from the state.\n\nAbout 25 years later, Congress allowed some Dakota, who were considered \"friendly,\" to return and establish small settlements in the state. So today four Dakota communities are dotted across southern Minnesota.\n\nBut for Gwen and all the other Dakota who grew up elsewhere, the federal expulsion from Minnesota-- their homeland-- is still on the books.\n\nMan\n\nHow are things going to go is no walkers go past here.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nThis past August, to mark the 150th anniversary of the start of the US-Dakota War, a symbolic walk home, organized by several Dakota bands and reservations. Gwen and I went.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nWell, we're standing here today in the midst of cornfields on all sides of this intersection, under an incredibly beautiful blue sky, at the state line between South Dakota and Minnesota, as we make that walk back into Minnesota 150 years after we were forced to leave.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nThe highway patrol has closed off a section of road, where South Dakota's Highway 34 meets Minnesota Highway 30.\n\n[HORSE NOISE]\n\nThere are a dozen Dakota on horseback and many more on foot. A handful of white Minnesotans greet them with signs saying \"Welcome home.\"\n\nWoman\n\nThank you! Thank you for coming back! Thank you.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nAbout 40 yards shy of the state line--\n\nWoman\n\nThat's about as far as I can let you guys go.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\n--organizers ask reporters to turn off our equipment if we want to witness the ceremony up close.\n\nMaybe 100 people form a big circle around eight older Dakota women. They pass eagle feathers across the line into Minnesota and sweep sage smoke on themselves. There are prayers and tears.\n\n[BACKGROUND CHATTER]\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nI have a much different response than I had anticipated. And I think it started yesterday when they told us that Governor Dayton had made today-- declared today-- a day of remembrance and reconciliation. And that he repudiated Governor Ramsey's words about extermination and exile.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nMinnesota's governor, Mark Dayton, said he was appalled by Governor Ramsay's words in 1862. Dayton stated flatly that the US used deception and force to take Indian lands and broke its promises.\n\nGwen Westerman\n\nAnd when I heard that-- when I heard that, it was overwhelming in a way that I hadn't anticipated. Because I thought it would be, yes! It's about time! Or I don't know.\n\nBut that's not the way it felt. It was relief. It was an overwhelming feeling. And I wanted to cry. But I was in a restaurant. And I was glad I had sunglasses on. So I held it together then.\n\nBut about two weeks ago, I was giving a presentation at the Minnesota Historical Society. And during the question session, somebody said, well, what do you want? Do you want reparations?\n\nAnd the person who asked the question was almost accusatory-- well, what do you want? What more do you want? And I said, what we want is acknowledgment that this happened. And so, to hear what the governor did, this is a turning point.\n\nWe want to be acknowledged. And here it is.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nThe history of every place is more complicated than the people who live there like to believe. And every moment in history is just as complex as the moment we're living in right now.\n\nI have a friend, Tim Tyson, a historian I work with at Duke, who points out that in his home state of North Carolina, up to one third of the white people were pro-Union during the Civil War. And a year into the war-- 1862-- the state elected a governor who'd opposed both slavery and secession.\n\nTim Tyson\n\nAnd yet there's no memory that white people opposed the Civil War. There's no memory that General Pickett, of Pickett's Charge, came to Kinston, North Carolina in 1864. And the first thing he did was he hanged 22 local white boys on the courthouse lawn because they were loyal to the United States government.\n\nAnd you go down to Kinston now and you go out to King's Barbecue and you look down the row of cars, at all those trucks and all those Confederate-flag bumper stickers. And I just want to say, you don't know who you are. They hanged your great-granddaddy. And you got their flag on your bumper. That's kind of interesting.\n\nSo we invent a fake history for ourselves that doesn't deal with the complexities. And I think that, in some ways, that's what the South and the upper Midwest have in common is that there's a delusion at work about who we were. And that's why we have a hard time about who we are.\n\nSo that the kind of self-congratulatory history that passes for heritage, it keeps us from seeing ourselves and doing better.\n\nJohn Biewen\n\nOne place to see fake history-- on a state flag of Minnesota. The image on the flag, the state seal, was chosen by Henry Sibley. It shows a white farmer behind a plow, tilling the soil. He's looking up to watch an Indian ride away on a horse. In the original, he's literally riding into the sunset. The Indian looks back at the white man. As far as you can tell, he's leaving willingly.\n\nIra Glass\n\nJohn Biewen.

Is it?\n\nMary Wingerd\n\nWell, I'm not going to say that. But, yes, it is.\n\nIra Glass\n\nI'm Ira Glass. Back next week with more stories of This American Life."
