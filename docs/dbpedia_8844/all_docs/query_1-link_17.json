        "text": "For other uses, see Grand Prairie (disambiguation).\n\nCity in Texas\n\nGrand Prairie is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, located in Dallas, Tarrant, and Ellis counties.[5] It is part of the Mid-Cities region in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. It had a population of 175,396 according to the 2010 census, making it the fifteenth most populous city in the state.[6] Remaining the 15th-most populous city in Texas, the 2020 census reported a population of 196,100.[7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city of Grand Prairie was first established as Dechman by Alexander McRae Dechman in 1863. He based the name of the town on Big Prairie, Ohio. Prior to then, he resided in Young County near Fort Belknap. The 1860 U.S. Federal Census—Slave Schedules shows an A McR Dechman as having four slaves, ages 50, 25, 37 and 10. Dechman learned that he could trade his oxen and wagons for land in Dallas County. In 1863, Dechman bought 239.5 acres (96.9 ha) of land on the eastern side of the Trinity River and 100 acres (40 ha) of timber land on the west side of the river for a broken-down wagon, oxen team and US$200 in Confederate money. He tried to establish a home on the property, but ran into difficulties, so he returned to his family in Birdville before joining in the Civil War. In 1867, Dechman filed a town plat with Dallas County, consisting of 50 acres (20 ha).\n\nAfter the war, Dechman returned to Birdville for two years before selling that farm in 1867 and moving to Houston, where yellow fever broke out, causing the family to settle in Bryan. In 1876, Dechman traded half his \"prairie\" property to the T&P Railroad to ensure the railroad came through the town. The railroad named the depot \"Dechman\", prompting its namesake to relocate his home from Bryan to Dechman. His son Alexander had been living in Dechman and operating a trading post and farm. The first church in the area was the Good Hope Cumberland Sabbath School, established in 1870 by Rev. Andrew Hayter. The church was later renamed West Fork United Presbyterian Church and remains an active church.[8]\n\nThe first U.S. post office opened in 1877 under the name \"Deckman\" rather than \"Dechman\", because the U.S. Postal Service could not read the writing on the form completed to open the post office. Later that same year, after the Postal Service had adopted the \"Deckman\" name, confusion resulted from the T&P Railroad designation \"Grand Prairie\". This name was based on maps drawn from around 1850 through 1858 that labeled the area between Dallas and Fort Worth \"the grand prairie of Texas\". In order to alleviate the confusion, the Postal Service named the post office \"Grand Prairie\".\n\nThe town of Grand Prairie was eventually incorporated as a city in 1909. During World War I and since, Grand Prairie has had a long history with the defense and aviation industry. While the present-day Vought plant on Jefferson Avenue is part of a small strip within the Dallas city limits, it was originally in Grand Prairie. During World War II, the North American Aviation Plant B produced the Consolidated B-24 Liberator and the P-51C and K Mustang variants. After the war, Vought Aircraft took over the plant. This later became Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV), then eventually returned to the Vought moniker. The plant was the production site for the F-8 Crusader and the A-7 Corsair II aircraft of the 1950–1989 time period. The LTV Missile and Space division produced missiles such as the Scout and MLRS. This division was eventually sold to Lockheed Martin, which continues to operate in Grand Prairie. Grand Prairie was also the North American headquarters for Aérospatiale Helicopter. This company eventually became Airbus Helicopters, Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of Airbus Helicopters.\n\nIn 1953, the mayor and city council of Grand Prairie attempted to annex nearly 70 square miles (180 km2) of then-unincorporated and largely undeveloped land in southern Dallas and Tarrant counties. Vehement debate ensued, and the legal pressure from cities such as Arlington, Duncanville and Irving wound up overturning part of the annexation attempt.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nGrand Prairie is located along the border between Tarrant and Dallas counties, with a small portion extending south into Ellis County. The city is bordered by Dallas to the east, Cedar Hill and Midlothian to the southeast, Mansfield to the southwest, Arlington to the west, Fort Worth to the northwest, and Irving to the north.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 81.1 square miles (210.0 km2), of which 72.1 square miles (186.8 km2) is land and 9.0 square miles (23.3 km2), or 11.08%, is water.[9]\n\nThe West Fork of the Trinity River and a major tributary, Johnson Creek, flow through Grand Prairie.\n\nGrand Prairie has a long history of flooding from Johnson Creek. In the 1980s, a major Army Corps of Engineers project was begun to straighten the channel, which has reduced the damage of flooding.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nGrand Prairie is part of the humid subtropical region.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1910994—19201,26327.1%19301,52921.1%19401,5954.3%195014,594815.0%196030,386108.2%197050,90467.5%198071,46240.4%199099,61639.4%2000127,42727.9%2010175,39637.6%2020196,10011.8%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nGrand Prairie city, Texas – Racial and ethnic composition\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

Six Arlington ISD elementary schools are within the city limits of Grand Prairie. Grand Prairie residents in the Arlington ISD are located generally west of the Dallas-Tarrant County boundary and north of the intersection of Camp Wisdom and Lake Ridge in southwest Grand Prairie. One of the Arlington high schools, James Bowie High, has more Grand Prairie residents than Arlington residents that are students at the school.\n\nGrand Prairie student/residents in the Arlington ISD attend Bowie, Sam Houston, or Lamar High School in the Arlington ISD and their feeder elementary schools and junior high schools.\n\nMansfield Independent School District\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Mansfield ISD contains the third highest portion of the Grand Prairie's K–12 student population.

Three Mansfield ISD schools, Anna May Daulton Elementary; Louise Cabaniss Elementary; and Cora Spencer Elementary, are currently open within the city limits of Grand Prairie. The Mansfield ISD is the fastest growing ISD in Tarrant County, and the population growth in far southwest Grand Prairie is a major factor in the Mansfield ISD's subsequent growth.\n\nGrand Prairie students/residents in the Mansfield ISD attend Mansfield Timberview High School, Lake Ridge High School or Mansfield High School in the Mansfield ISD or their feeder elementaries and middle schools. Timberview High School is located on State Highway 360 less than 100 yards (91 m) from the Grand Prairie city line.\n\nColleges and universities\n\n[edit]\n\nDallas County residents are zoned to Dallas College (formerly Dallas County Community College District or DCCCD). Tarrant County residents are zoned to Tarrant County Junior College. Ellis County residents are zoned to Navarro College.[31]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nInterstate highways 20 and 30 run east–west through the northern and southern parts of the city. Texas State Highways Spur 303 (named Pioneer Parkway) and 180 (Main Street) also run east–west in the northern and central portions of the city.\n\nSH 360 runs for almost three miles in the northwestern portion of city; most of the highway runs just west of the city limits in Arlington.\n\nSH 161, named the President George Bush Turnpike, runs north–south through western Grand Prairie. The main lanes were opened in late 2012 with frontage roads open since 2010. Portions of the highway located north of SH 180 are depressed while the portion south of SH 180 runs at-grade then becomes elevated. Frontage roads remain at-grade throughout. The frontage road intersection at Main Street will open sometime in 2013.[32]\n\nBelt Line Road is a major north–south thoroughfare in the city. The section of the road south of Main Street is dual-labelled as FM 1382, which travels south, past I-20 and continues south to Cedar Hill. The section of the road north of Main Street keeps its name, continuing north into Irving.\n\nThe city declined membership in 1984. In April 2022, Grand Prairie launched \"Via Grand Prairie\", an \"on-demand, shared public transportation\" which connects to DART's West Irving station.[33]\n\nIn the era of private operation of passenger trains prior to the onset of the Amtrak era in 1971, Texas and Pacific Railway trains such as the Texas Eagle and the Louisiana Eagle made stops in Grand Prairie, on trips between Fort Worth and Dallas.[34][35][36] Amtrak's Texas Eagle (Chicago-San Antonio) makes stops at Dallas Union Station 12 miles to the east.\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nLarry D.
