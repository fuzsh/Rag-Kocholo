Here we present analyses of driver point mutations and structural variants in non-coding regions across 2,658&nbsp;genomes from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium5 of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For point mutations, we developed a statistically rigorous strategy for combining significance levels from multiple methods of driver discovery that overcomes the limitations of individual methods. For structural variants, we present two methods of driver discovery, and identify regions that are significantly affected by recurrent breakpoints and recurrent somatic juxtapositions. Our analyses confirm previously reported drivers6,7, raise doubts about others and identify novel candidates, including point mutations in the 5′ region of TP53, in the 3′ untranslated regions of NFKBIZ and TOB1, focal deletions in BRD4 and rearrangements in the loci of AKR1C genes. We show that although&nbsp;point mutations and structural variants that drive cancer are less frequent in non-coding genes and regulatory sequences than in protein-coding genes, additional examples of these drivers will be found as more cancer genomes become available.

        "text": "Our stringent combination and filtering strategy yielded 705 hits in 179 genomic elements: 602 hits in 143 protein-coding genes and 103 hits in non-coding elements. We observed wide variability across different types of cancer, from one hit in clear-cell renal cancer to 80 in the pan-cancer meta-cohort (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Tables 4,5). Although most candidate drivers gained significance in larger meta-cohorts, some genes—such as DAXX (pancreatic endocrine tumour), NRAS (melanoma), SPOP (prostate adenocarcinoma), FGFR1 (pilocytic astrocytoma) and MIR142 (Lymph–BNHL)—scored higher in individual tumour types (Extended Data Fig. 3d). These results emphasize the trade-off between limiting driver discovery analyses to particular types of tumour and maximizing cohort size.\n\nThe candidate coding drivers we identified agreed with previous results: of the 143 genes that were significant in at least 1 cohort, 69% are in the CGC and nearly all have previously been implicated in cancer. In contrast to large whole-exome sequencing datasets, the fewer patients per cancer type in this dataset provided power sufficient only to detect genes with the strongest signal. We found 116 additional hits in 84 unique elements that were ‘near significance’ (0.1 < Q < 0.25). Fifty-one per cent of the 63 unique protein-coding genes in this set are in the CGC, which suggests that they would have been discovered in larger cohorts (Supplementary Table 4).\n\nTo nominate a significant non-coding element as a candidate driver, we reviewed the supporting evidence from the mutation calls, additional genomic data (chromosomal breakpoints, copy number, loss-of-heterozygosity and expression data), cancer gene databases and the literature (Methods, Supplementary Tables 6, 10). We describe the key candidates below, and in Supplementary Note 4.\n\nThe TERT promoter was the most frequently mutated non-coding driver in this dataset (14 cohorts) (Fig. 1b), and these mutations were strongly associated with higher TERT expression, as has previously been reported9 (Extended Data Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 10). Mutations in the promoter and/or 5′ UTR of MTG2 (which encodes a GTPase involved in the mitochondrial ribosome) were associated with an expression of MTG2 that was marginally significantly lower, in both the pan-cancer (P = 0.036, fold difference = 0.8) and carcinoma (P = 0.029, fold difference = 0.8) meta-cohorts (Extended Data Figs. 4a, 5a). Mutations in the 5′ UTR have previously been shown to decrease MTG2 expression in vitro22.\n\nRecurrent somatic events were identified in the 3′ UTRs of TOB1 (carcinoma and pan-cancer meta-cohorts), NFKBIZ (lymphomas) and ALB (liver cancer) (Fig. 1b). TOB1 encodes an anti-proliferation regulator that associates with ERBB2, and also affects migration and invasion in gastric cancer23. TOB1 regulates other mRNAs through binding to their 3′ UTR and promoting deadenylation24. Tumours with 3′ UTR mutations in TOB1 showed a trend towards decreased expression (P = 0.053, fold difference = 0.7). The mutations did not concentrate in known miRNA-binding sites; however, the region is extremely conserved and thus probably functional (Fig. 2a). TOB1 and its neighbouring gene WFIKKN2 are focally amplified in breast cancer and pan-cancer, suggesting a complex role in cancer (Extended Data Fig. 4b). NFKBIZ is a transcription factor that is mutated in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and amplified in primary lymphomas25. Mutations in the 3′ UTR accumulated in a hotspot proximal to the stop codon and upstream of conserved miRNA-binding sites (Extended Data Fig. 5b). The enrichment of indels next to the stop codon suggests that this hotspot is not due to AID off-target activity. Previous functional experiments have associated these mutations with increased NFKBIZ expression25, which we observed in our lymphoma cohort (P = 0.035, fold difference = 3.2; after correction for copy number, P = 0.03) (Extended Data Fig. 5b).\n\nBoth the exon and promoter of the non-coding RNA RMRP were significantly mutated in multiple types of cancer (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 5c). Germline RMRP mutations cause cartilage–hair hypoplasia, and previous in vitro studies have shown that some somatic promoter mutations are functional16. The RMRP locus is also focally amplified in several types of tumour (Extended Data Fig. 4b). The enrichment of mutations in sites that can affect secondary structure suggests that these mutations are functional (P = 0.011, permutation test) (Extended Data Fig. 5c), although caution is required because this locus also appears to be affected by mapping artefacts or increased mutation rates (Supplementary Note 4).\n\nThe miR-142 precursor miRNA was significant in Lymph–BNHL and the lymphatic and haematopoietic cohorts (Fig. 1b; Extended Data Fig. 5d). The locus is a known AID off-target region in lymphoma12,26, but 7 out of 8 mutations in the mature miRNA mir-142-p3––for which the largest functional effect is expected––were not assigned to AID, which suggests that these mutations are under selection12.\n\nDriver structural variants may act by disrupting one or both of their breakpoint loci (for example, deactivating a tumour suppressor), or by generating a novel juxtaposition between loci. We thus searched both for genomic regions with SRBs and for pairs of regions with SRJs (Extended Data Fig. 7).\n\nFor SRBs, we first defined a background model to predict breakpoint density, using eight explanatory variables (Methods, Supplementary Table 13) and accounting for unexplained sources of variation31 (Supplementary Note 6). We identified 53 disjoint regions with SRBs (Q < 0.1) (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 14), which cleanly divided into two groups on the basis of the variability of the breakpoints at the other side of the rearrangements. Eight SRBs had partner breakpoints that were tightly clustered (had low rearrangement dispersion scores; Methods) and represented known oncogenic fusions. The remaining 45 SRBs had dispersed partner breakpoints (had high rearrangement dispersion scores), and were largely associated with previously identified somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) (Fig. 3b).\n\nIt has been difficult to distinguish recurrent driver SCNAs from passenger events at fragile sites32. At the resolution afforded by whole-genome sequencing, late replication timing predicted fragility-associated SRBs better than existing fragile site annotations (Supplementary Note 7), identifying 12 fragile-like SRBs (Fig. 3b). The remaining 33 SCNA-like SRBs comprised 14 amplifications, 8 deletions and 11 copy-neutral events (Supplementary Table 14).\n\nThe different classes of SRB were associated with different effects on neighbouring genes. Five of the eight deletion-associated SRBs were associated with biallelic inactivation of nearby known tumour suppressors, compared to none of the 12 fragile-like SRBs (P = 0.039) (Extended Data Fig. 8a). The fragile-like SRBs were furthest from tissue-matched enhancers and caused the weakest expression changes, consistent with them being passenger events32. By contrast, fusion-like SRBs were closer to tissue-matched enhancers than the other SRBs (P < 0.01) (Extended Data Fig. 8b) and were associated with greater changes in expression than all other SRBs except amplifications (P < 0.05 for all types) (Extended Data Fig. 8c, Methods). Our analyses indicate that SRB driver events can be classified using rearrangement dispersion scores, replication timing and gene expression. Notably, neither rearrangement dispersion scores nor association with replication time can be accurately determined from microarrays or whole-exome sequencing, which highlights the importance of whole-genome sequencing. Altogether, we identified SRBs at 34 sites of known oncogenic fusions and recurrent SCNAs, 5 additional sites that are probably due to DNA fragility and 14 novel driver candidates (Supplementary Note 8).\n\nMotivated by the detection of fusion-like SRBs, we specifically looked for genomic loci that were juxtaposed more often than expected by chance, after controlling for both the rate of breakpoints at each locus and the distance between them (Methods). We identified 90 such SRJs (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Table 15), including 13 known oncogenic fusions (including all 8 fusion-like SRBs) and 77 novel hits—18 of which linked to at least one known cancer gene (Supplementary Note 8). Previously reported oncogenic SRJs were observed more frequently (average 24 patients per fusion, range 2–98) than novel ones (most often 2 patients per fusion, range 2–4). As juxtapositions are unlikely to occur by chance, observing even two becomes highly significant. However, it is possible that some SRJs reflect inaccuracies in our background model rather than true drivers. We therefore further evaluated the SRJs on the basis of (i) a ‘robustness factor’ that indicates how much the background rate could increase before the SRJ would become insignificant, and (ii) the ratio between the observed and expected numbers of events under the current background model (‘effect size’) (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Twenty-six SRJs, including 11 of the 13 known drivers and 15 newly identified SRJs, are robust to tripling the expected background rate, and 22 others would remain significant with a doubled rate.\n\nMost canonical driver rearrangements have previously been found in single tumour types, often associated with tissue-specific expression39,40. We found that 9 of our top 10 SRJs are tissue-specific, despite searching across 30 different types of tumour. Such tissue specificity is not observed for cancer genes affected by SCNAs, for which the top 10 are altered in 11.9 cancer types (on average), or by point mutations (for which the top 10 are altered in 6.7 cancer types, on average) (Supplementary Table 16).\n\nThe tissue specificity of SRJs suggests that they are strongly shaped by epigenetic state, either owing to mechanistic reasons (for example, tissue-specific three-dimensional proximity of the two DNA breakpoints) or to selection that connects tissue-specific regulatory elements with oncogenes13,41,42,43. The latter seems to be more likely because: (i) SRJs are associated with significant overexpression of only one of the rearrangement partners (the ‘primary locus’) relative to randomly selected rearrangements (primary locus, P < 10−4 (Fig. 3g left); secondary locus, P > 0.05 (Extended Data Fig. 9b left)); (ii) the rearrangement partner, in the secondary locus, tends to be highly expressed in that tissue type relative to others (Fig. 3g right); and (iii) the distance to the nearest tissue-specific enhancer is smaller for SRJs than for rearrangements overall (Extended Data Fig. 9b). These observations suggest that SRJs act in general by bringing regulatory elements to an oncogene that is otherwise expressed at a low level.\n\nIn many cases, SRJs generate truncated or chimeric proteins, and breakpoints within introns or exons were indeed overrepresented (68% versus 56% expected, P < 10−7). However, only 11 of the 30 (37%) most significant SRJs generated novel proteins in all samples, and 6 others sometimes generated novel proteins; the rest were either non-disruptive or contained breakpoints within the first two introns of the disrupted gene, leaving most of the protein intact44 (Fig. 3f). Moreover, SRJs that generate novel proteins exhibited expression changes similar to those that do not (P = 0.4) (Extended Data Fig. 9c). We conclude that altering gene expression is a key function of both classes of SRJs, and that SRJs are akin to non-coding driver point mutations that act on regulatory elements.\n\nWe found several SRJs that involve amplified oncogenes, including MDM2, EGFR and TERT (Fig. 3f, h, i, Extended Data Fig. 9d–f, Supplementary Table 15). The TERT promoter region was juxtaposed in four melanomas (P < 10−7) to a region in the BASP1 gene (both on chromosome 5), and to a region near NDUFC2 (t(5,11)) in two melanomas and one medulloblastoma (P < 10−8). Both juxtaposed regions were marked with melanocyte enhancers, which suggests that they could drive TERT expression. Among melanomas, these rearrangements are mutually exclusive with the C228T and C250T mutations of the TERT promoter (P < 10−3) (Fig. 3h). Because the juxtapositions were always part of complex events that also amplified TERT, increased TERT expression may be due to amplification, the juxtapositions or both.\n\nOur analyses of genomic hotspots, functional elements, genomic windows and SRJs all suggest that non-coding drivers are rare compared to protein-coding drivers. This might, in part, be due to a lack of discovery power3. We therefore evaluated the discovery power of mutational-burden tests for recurrent events across the different types of element in our tumour cohorts, focusing first on point mutations3,16. We found that the fraction of mutated patients required for a driver to reach 90% discovery power ranged from <1% in large cohorts with low background-mutation densities to 25% in small cohorts with high background-mutation densities (Fig. 4a). Different types of element were similarly powered, suggesting that the paucity of drivers in non-coding versus coding elements is not due to a lack of power. Similarly, our power to detect SRJs was higher in large cohorts with low rearrangement rates, and for long and interchromosomal rearrangements owing to their lower overall rates (Extended Data Fig. 10a): we were only powered to detect events that recur in 5–20% of samples in most types of cancer (Fig. 4b). Moreover, beginning with about 2,500 tumours, we expect to find a new SRJ with every 25 additional genomes (Fig. 4c).\n\nLow sequencing coverage (for example, in GC-rich regions45) also limits driver discovery. To measure this effect in the PCAWG data, we quantified our ability to detect mutations (detection sensitivity)16 in cancer gene promoters. Although the mean detection sensitivity in promoters is high (41.9% of genomic positions have mean detection sensitivity >80% across tumours), only 4.1% of the promoters had detection sensitivity >90% in >90% of bases. In particular, the two canonical TERT promoter hotspots had highly variable detection sensitivity among patients and cohorts, from only 3% of patients in the central-nervous-system pilocytic astrocytoma cohort to 100% in the thyroid adenocarcinoma cohort (Extended Data Fig. 10b). From these data, we inferred the expected number of TERT events in each tumour type (Extended Data Fig. 10c) and found that about 263 (95% confidence interval 232–295) TERT hotspot mutations were probably missed owing to a lack of detection sensitivity. Moreover, on average 9.9% (1.3–13.0% interquartile range) of the cancer gene promoter territory in the tumour of each patient was severely underpowered (an average detection sensitivity of <10%). Therefore, the lack of coverage in promoters may contribute to the paucity of non-coding drivers.\n\nTo determine whether the paucity of non-coding drivers discovered thus far could be due to the limited statistical power of current datasets, we estimated the overall excess of point mutations above background (that is, the expected number of driver events) in coding and cis-regulatory non-coding sequences in 603 cancer genes46 (Methods, Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary Note 11). To minimize the effect of samples with low detection sensitivity, we included only 936 samples with >90% detection sensitivity at the two TERT promoter hotspots (Extended Data Fig. 10c, d, Supplementary Note 11). Overall, this approach predicted more than 1,475 driver mutations (95% confidence interval 1,410–1,687; 1,069 SNVs and 406 indels) in the protein-coding sequences of these cancer genes (Fig. 4d), compared to only 96 (95% confidence interval 30–190) estimated driver mutations in promoters (73 attributed to TERT), 22 (95% confidence interval 0–88) in 5′UTRs, and 68 (95% confidence interval 0–178) in 3′ UTRs. Non-coding mutations in cancer-gene promoters were also not generally associated with loss-of-heterozygosity or altered expression, as one would expect if they were enriched with drivers (Supplementary Note 12). These results collectively indicate that, independently of statistical power, non-coding cis-regulatory driver mutations in known cancer genes besides TERT are much less frequent than protein-coding drivers.\n\nThe accurate and reliable discovery of genomic drivers in tumours may have critical implications for patients with cancer. Our findings and the methods introduced here for the discovery of point-mutation and structural-variant drivers, method integration, vetting of candidates and identification of local hypermutation and fragile sites represent an important contribution to the collective effort towards charting all malignant changes that drive the cancer of each patient5.\n\nAmong the most interesting candidate non-coding driver elements we uncovered are the 5′-end mutations in TP53; 3′ UTR mutations in NFKBIZ and TOB1; and rearrangements involving AKR1C genes and BRD4. By careful analysis of the whole-genome sequencing data, we found that several previously reported and frequently altered non-coding elements may not be genuine drivers, including (i) the non-coding RNAs, NEAT1 and MALAT1 (which contain a high density of indels, seemingly owing to a transcription-associated mutational process) and (ii) recurrent structural variants in regions of late replication, indicating DNA fragility.\n\nThis study yielded unexpectedly few non-coding driver point mutations and structural variants. SRJs, which appear to act largely through the rearrangement of regulatory elements, are less frequent than SCNA-like SRBs, which directly amplify or delete coding sequences. The results from five analyses––hotspot recurrence, driver-element discovery, structural variants, discovery power and aggregated mutational excess––suggest that this paucity is not caused by a particular analysis strategy, but that regulatory elements truly contribute a much smaller number of recurrent cancer-driving events than protein-coding sequences. This paucity of non-coding drivers contrasts with the distribution of germline polymorphisms associated with heritability of complex traits, which are most frequently located outside of protein-coding genes47.\n\nAt least two factors contribute to the relative paucity of non-coding driver mutations in cancer: (i) the differential fitness effects of coding and non-coding mutations and (ii) the target size of functional elements. The paucity of promoter driver mutations in well-established cancer genes suggests that point mutations markedly affect the function of non-coding regulatory elements only rarely. This highlights TERT as a notable exception, perhaps because even a modest increase in TERT expression may suffice to circumvent normal telomere shortening. For other cancer genes, directly mutating protein-coding sequences or altering expression levels by copy-number change may provide larger phenotypic effects. For example, complete loss-of-function by nonsense mutations or deletions may be easier to achieve than by disrupting or translocating regulatory regions.\n\nTechnical shortcomings (such as coverage ‘blind spots’ in GC-rich promoters and different filtering strategies) may cause genuine drivers to be missed48. Therefore, the discovery of non-coding drivers will benefit from technical improvements, including even sequence coverage, longer and accurate reads, and improved variant-calling methods. Moreover, better annotation of functional non-coding elements will increase both the power to discover infrequently mutated driver elements and their interpretability. As datasets grow, yet-unidentified mutational mechanisms targeting particular genomic regions will emerge and require improved background models, including additional covariates and more-sophisticated statistical models. The analysis of structural variants has greater challenges because (i) accurately modelling their background density is complicated by their lower frequency and larger fraction of drivers (Supplementary Note 6); (ii) their target genes may be far from the breakpoints, as in SCNAs; (iii) the space for modelling SRJs is much larger (the genome squared); and (iv) many structural variants are part of complex events that often involve multiple chromosomes31, so that the resultant topology cannot be deduced without technologies such as long- or linked-read sequencing49,50. For these reasons, experimental validation remains important for all—and especially for non-coding—candidate drivers.\n\nOur work suggests that larger datasets and technological advances will continue to identify new non-coding drivers, albeit at considerably lower frequencies than protein-coding drivers. We anticipate that the approaches developed here will provide a solid foundation for the incipient era of driver discovery from ever-larger numbers of cancer whole genomes.\n\nNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.\n\nDetailed methods are provided as Supplementary Methods.\n\nDataset generation\n\nOut of 2,955 samples, we selected 2,583 unique donor samples for SNV and indel driver-discovery analysis on the basis of SNV quality control (Supplementary Methods). We found that 110 additional myeloid–AML samples had robust structural variant calls despite SNV artefacts; we included these in structural variant analyses, for a total of 2,693 samples. For tumour-type cohort analyses, we used only cohorts with at least 20 patients. Tumour meta-cohorts were defined by cell type of origin or by organ system (for example, lung for lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma). A pan-cancer meta-cohort was created by combining all tumour cohorts except for Skin–Melanoma and lymphoid tumours (Supplementary Methods).\n\nHotspot SNV analysis\n\nWe selected the 50 most-frequent SNV hotspots. These were analysed to identify known driver events; mutational signature biases related to sequence palindromes, immunoglobulin loci and so on; and potential artefacts, including regional mapping problems (Supplementary Methods).\n\nMutational signatures\n\nWe performed de novo global-signature discovery and signature attributions with SignatureAnalyzer’s Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization method52, based on 1,697 channels—including 1,536 pentanucleotide sequence contexts for single-base substitutions, 83 indel features, and 78 doublet-nucleotide substitution classes (Supplementary Methods).\n\nDefinition of genomic elements\n\nGENCODE v.19 (ref.53) and other genomic resources were used to define functional genomic elements, including protein-coding genes (CDS, splice sites, 5′ UTR, 3′ UTR and promoters), long non-coding RNAs (gene body, splice site and promoters), short RNAs, miRNAs and enhancers (Supplementary Methods).\n\nCandidate-driver-mutation identification methods and combination of results\n\nWe obtained results (P values) from 13 methods of driver discovery, including ActiveDriverWGS54, CompositeDriver, DriverPower55, dndscv46, ExInAtor56, LARVA57, MutSig tools3, NBR10, ncdDetect58, ncDriver59, OncodriveFML60 and regDriver61. We integrated the results of all these methods using a custom framework based on a previously published method62 for combining P values. Results from individual methods that showed large deviations from the expected uniform null distribution of P values were excluded. This approach was evaluated on real and simulated data. We controlled the FDR within each of the sets of tested genomic elements by concatenating all combined Brown’s P values from across all tumour-type cohorts and applying the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure63. Cohort–element combinations with Q values < 0.1 were designated as significant hits, and combinations with 0.1 ≤ Q < 0.25 as ‘near significance’. Extensive details are provided in the Supplementary Methods. In addition, we tested for element-independent recurrence with the NBR method on 2-kb bins spanning the entire genome, and non-coding ultraconserved regions64.\n\nPost-filtering of driver mutation candidates\n\nWe applied stringent filters to discern positive selection from technical artefacts and mutational processes. We required at least three mutations to be present in candidate elements, in at least three patients of the tested cohort; more than 50% of mutations in mappable regions; less than 50% of mutations in palindromic DNA; and less than 50% of mutations attributed to APOBEC activity. For lymphoid tumours and skin melanoma, we required that <35% and <50% of mutations were attributed to the AID and UV-light mutational signatures, respectively. The FDR was recalculated after post-filtering.\n\nCandidate driver structural-variant analyses\n\nWe applied separate analyses to detect recurrent structural variant breakpoints and recurrent juxtapositions. For each analysis, we first binned breakpoints, accepting only one breakpoint per sample per bin. We then determined which bins had more breakpoints than expected by chance (the SRB analysis), and which pairs of bins (or ‘tiles’) were joined by more rearrangements than expected by chance (the SRJ analysis).\n\nCandidate driver breakpoints\n\nWe calculated the background rate of breakpoints per bin based on a Gamma–Poisson model15 that took into account genomic covariates, breakpoint counts normalized by the number of bases within each bin that had sufficient mappability to be eligible for breakpoint detection and accounted for an observed overdispersion of breakpoint counts that probably reflects unaccounted-for covariates (Supplementary Methods). We used the Gamma–Poisson model to calculate the P value for each bin (that is, the probability that each bin would exhibit the observed number of breakpoints (or greater) by chance alone), applying the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure63 to correct for multiple hypotheses.\n\nPost-filtering of driver breakpoint candidates\n\nWe scored each recurrent breakpoint locus on the basis of the average replication timing of its breakpoints, and filtered those loci with scores >0.5 as probable fragile sites65.\n\nCandidate driver juxtapositions\n\nWe developed a background model to indicate the probability that two loci would be joined, taking into account the observed rate at which each locus underwent DNA breaks (from the breakpoint analysis), the distance between them and the propensity for these rearrangements to reflect a break followed by invasion versus two breaks that were then joined. We determined the probability that each tile would contain the observed number of rearrangements using a binomial test, followed by controlling for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure63.\n\nGene-expression analyses\n\nGene-expression data were provided by the PCAWG Transcriptome Core Group66, and also generated using the same approach for an extended set of non-coding transcripts (Supplementary Methods).\n\nAdditional evidence for selection\n\nIn addition to associations between mutations or structural variants and expression, we looked for signals of copy-number-alteration recurrence using the GISTIC2 algorithm67. We also tested whether driver candidates showed significantly higher frequency of loss-of-heterozygosity in mutated samples using Fisher’s exact test. We calculated cancer allelic fractions using ploidy and tumour purity predictions from a previous publication68.\n\nMutational process and indel enrichment\n\nFor every gene, we calculated the proportion of indels of length 2–5 bp out of the total number of indels. This proportion was compared to the genome background proportion using a binomial test. We also compared the indel rate per gene (not distinguishing by length) to the background. Both sets of P values were corrected with the FDR method.\n\nPower calculations\n\nWe estimated our power to discover driver elements mutated at a particular frequency in the population as previously described3,16, but solving for the lowest frequency for a driver element in the patient population that is powered (≥90%) for discovery. The calculation of this lowest frequency takes into account (i) the average background mutation frequencies for each cohort–element combination; (ii) the median length and average detection sensitivity for each element type and patient cohort size; and (iii) a global desired false-positive rate of 10%. The effect of element length is discussed in Supplementary Note 10, and details are provided in Supplementary Methods. Power calculations for detection of recurrent juxtapositions was performed similarly, except over a two-dimensional genomic fusion map divided into 100 × 100-kb tiles (Supplementary Methods). We performed this analysis first as a function of the distance between breakpoints (Extended Data Fig. 10a) and second as a function of the median number of rearrangements per sample, spanning values represented by histologies with more than 15 samples (Fig. 4b).\n\nEstimation of the number of mutations in non-coding regions of known cancer genes\n\nNBR was used to estimate the background mutation rate expected across cancer genes, using a conservative list of 19,082 putative passenger genes as background and including as covariates the local mutation rate, gene expression and averaged copy-number states. The resulting model predicted the number of passenger SNVs and indels expected by chance. By aggregating the expected numbers over 603 known cancer genes from the CGC69 (CGC v.80) (Supplementary Table 7), we compared the observed and expected numbers of mutations. For this analysis, we excluded samples with problems of low detection sensitivity (Supplementary Methods).\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.\n\nAuthor notes\n\nThese authors contributed equally: Esther Rheinbay, Morten Muhlig Nielsen, Federico Abascal, Jeremiah A.
