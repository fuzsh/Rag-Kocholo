        "text": "You will find below a list of the most popular international and bilingual schools for expats in Brunei with fee information. It includes nursery schools, primary and secondary (high) schools and you will find the right school to prepare for International Baccalaureate, and other diploma in Brunei. Some schools may follow the American or British curriculums with English speaking programs while others are regulated under the Chinese education system.\n\nBrunei education has been based on Islamic forms of education in the past. However, there has been rapid development recently and the literacy rate is now more than 94 percent. However, Brunei's education philosophy is still founded on the National Philosophy of a Malay Islamic Monarchy and incorporates the two key elements of naqli (on the basis of the holy Quran and Hadith) and aqli (on the basis of reasoning).\n\nEducation in Brunei is under the control of the Ministry of Education of Brunei. Compulsory education is from the age of 5 to 16 and is free at every level from elementary to high school. Education at the primary and secondary levels are provided in the major languages of English, Malay or Chinese.\n\nInternational Schools\n\nInternational schools can be the perfect solution for an expat student (multinational corporation executives, children of diplomats, NGO staff) in Brunei. There may be some local population, but the schools are geared for an international student body. Schools usually follow a curriculum model from the US, UK, France, Canada or Australia/New Zealand. Primary instruction may be any language (and multiple languages are usually taught), but it is usually in English, French, Spanish, German, or Japanese. Many schools provide similar standards of schooling around the globe, providing for an easy transition between schools whether they are in France or Vietnam. Schools often provide internationally accepted accreditation such as the international baccalaureate.\n\nAdmission and enrollment procedures vary from school to school. Space is often limited and preference may be given to students based on nationality. Tuition tends to be expensive based on local standards, but offers high standards of learning, boast smaller class sizes, first-rate facilities, and extracurricular. Boarding facilities are available at some schools, but most only provide day classes.\n\nAccreditation\n\nThe CoIS (Council of International Schools) is a non-profit association of international schools and post-secondary institutions which provides educational accreditation, teacher and leadership recruitment services, links to higher education, governance assistance and help with founding new schools. Federation Of British International Schools in South East and East Asia (Fobissea) started as a collection of colleagues in British-styled international schools in Asia looking for fellowship and professional support, and is now an association of schools in South East Asia and East Asia. Independent Association of Preparatory Schools (IAPS) is an independent association of schools. The UK based Boarding Schools Association regulates and rates boarding schools around the world.\n\nBandar Seri Begawan\n\nInternational School of Brunei\n\nAddress: Jln Dato Haji Ahmad, Berakas\n\nBandar Seri Begawan BB1114\n\nBrunei Darussalam\n\nTel: 673 - 2330608\n\nTuition Rates: B$ 6,225 - 12,525\n\nISB is proud to be serving Brunei Darussalam as the only fully accredited international school on Borneo.
