        "text": "Beijing has many international schools, most of which are in the east part of the city. Some may be restricted to children of non-PRC nationals only, while others are open to all nationalities. Local public (government-provided) schools are difficult for non-PRC nationals to enter. There are also local private schools, with teaching in Chinese. Fees for these are usually lower than for the international schools.\n\nThe list of international schools below is for reference only. It is non-exhaustive and is not an endorsement of any of the schools. Descriptions are provided by the schools.

Our curriculum follows the English National Curriculum, with adjustments made to reflect our international context. We currently have 2 campuses: Our Sanlitun campus is conveniently located in the heart of the Embassy district and offers high quality primary education. Itâs cosy but purposeful and has gained this school a fantastic reputation as a family orientated campus. Our Shunyi campus is situated in the family friendly suburbs on the outskirts of Beijing. It is perfectly placed for the most popular expatriate friendly housing compounds and offers primary and secondary education. At our school respect, good manners and personal responsibility are highly valued and these elements are reinforced daily through the culture of the school which places a premium on social graces and considerate behavior.\n\nFor more information please contact our admission officers:\n\nChiara Marini for our Shunyi Campus â chiara.marini@britishschool.org.cn or Desiree Weidmann for our Sanlitun Campus â desiree.weidmann@britishschool.org.cn\n\nThe British School of Beijing - Shunyi Campus\n\nSouth Side, No 9, An Hua Street,\n\nTianzhu Development Zone, Shunyi District,\n\nBeijing 101318, CHINA\n\nTel: (0086) 10 8047 3588\n\nFax: (0086) 10 8047 3598/99\n\nEmail: info@britishschool.org.cn\n\nSanlitun Campus\n\n5 Sanlitun Xiliu Jie,Chaoyang District, Beijing\n\nTel: +86 10 8532 3088 Fax: +86 10 8532 3089\n\nWebsite: www.britishschool.org.cn\n\nEmail: info@britishschool.org.cn\n\nCanadian International School of Beijing\n\n- Conveniently located in the 3rd Embassy Area.\n\n- Offer Montessori Kindergarten & Canadian International Program Grades 1 - 10.\n\n- Day & Boarding (Grade 6 and up) available.\n\n38 Liangmaqiao Lu, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100025,\n\nTel: + 86 10 6465 7788 Fax: + 86 10 6465-7789\n\nWebsite: www.cisb.com.cn\n\nEmail: admissions@cis-beijing.com\n\nDeutsche Botschaftsschule Peking (German School)\n\n49A Lianmaqiao Lu, Chaoyang District, Beijing\n\nTel: +86 10 6532 2535\n\nWebsite: www.dspeking.net.cn\n\nDulwich College Beijing, Legend Garden Campus (Main Campus, 1 of 6)\n\n89 Capital Airport Road, Legend Garden Villas, Shunyi District, Beijing 101300\n\nTel: + 86 10 6454 9000 Fax: + 86 10 6454 9012\n\nWebsite: www.dcbeijing.cn\n\nEmail: admissions@dcbeijing.cn\n\nHarrow International School Beijing\n\nNo. 5, Block 4, Anzhenxili, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100029\n\nTel: +86 10 6444 8900 Fax: + 86 10 6444 3870\n\nWebsite: www.harrowbeijing.cn\n\nEmail: admissions@harrowbeijing.cn\n\nInternational Academy of Beijing (IAB)\n\nLido Office Tower 3, Lido Place, Jichang Road, Jiangtai Road, Chaoyang District 100004\n\nTel: + 86 10 6430 1600 / 1142 Fax: + 86 10 6430 1208\n\nWebsite: www.iabchina.net\n\nEmail: Vickie.shum@iabchina.net\n\nInternational School of Beijing (ISB)\n\n10 An Hua Street, Shunyi District, Beijing 101318\n\nTel: + 86 10 8149 2345 Fax: +86 10 8046 2003\n\nWebsite: www.isb.bj.edu.cn\n\nEmail: admissions@isb.bj.edu.cn\n\nLycee Francais de Pekin (French School)\n\nKindergarten:\n\n4 Sanlitun Lu, Chaoyang District Tel: + 86 10 6532 7881\n\nPrimary and Secondary School:\n\n13 Sanlitun, Dongsi Jie, Chaoyang District Tel: + 86 10 6532 3498\n\nWebsite: www.lfp.com.cn\n\nSwedish School of Beijing\n\nLegend Garden Villas, 89 Jichang Lu, Chaoyang District\n\nTel: + 86 10 6456 0826\n\nWestern Academy of Beijing (WAB)\n\n10 Laiguangying Donglu, Chaoyang District\n\nTel: +86 10 8456 4155 Fax: + 86 10 8470 1081\n\nWebsite: www.wab.edu Email: xweng@wab.edu\n\nYew Chung International School of Beijing (YCIS)\n\nHonglingjin Gongyuan Ximen, 5 Houbalizhuang, Chaoyang District 100025\n\nTel: + 86 10 8583 3731 Fax: + 86 10 8583 2734\n\nWebsite: www.ycef.com Email: inquiry@ycef.com\n\nThere is also a forum for homeschooling:\n\nBeijing Homeschoolers\n\nhttps://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/beijing_homeschoolers/info"
