        "text": "As a child, Xiao Fei Zheng did not understand want. He was born in Guangzhou, in southern China, in 1969, and grew up in a quiet neighborhood. Walking home from school, he often heard parents disciplining their children. But he was pampered. His father was a political officer in the Army, and his mother, a former professional basketball player, was an accountant. Their apartment was large, with a dining room spacious enough for his parents to host parties where couples would dance to tango and cha-cha records. In the rest of the building, apartments of this size were divided among three families. On many nights, the Zhengs’ neighbors patiently waited for the family to finish dinner. Then they would invite themselves over, stools in hand, and watch the Zhengs’ color television.\n\nXiao Fei’s father had little family in China, and his mother’s siblings were all in Hong Kong or the United States; her parents encouraged the family to come to California’s Bay Area, where they had lived for decades. In 1982, the Zhengs decided to make the move. Xiao Fei was twelve, his sister was seventeen, and his brother was twenty.\n\nIt was the first time Xiao Fei had ever flown, and he couldn’t stop throwing up. On arriving in the U.S., the family stayed with his grandparents, seven people sharing a two-bedroom apartment in Oakland’s Chinatown.\n\nHis sister remembers watching “Star Wars” in the late seventies and assuming that it was a story about America. She expected their new homeland to be full of robots and levitating cars, but she found it eerily desolate. After the sun set, their neighbors in Oakland stayed inside and locked the doors. Occasionally, they heard gunshots. Xiao Fei’s father was used to telling people what to do. Now he worked at Burger King, where he needed only three English words: “lettuce,” “tomato,” and “cheese.” Xiao Fei’s mother worked as a live-in nanny in San Jose, seeing her own family on weekends. Xiao Fei spent a lot of time with his grandfather, who took him aside one day and asked him to pick an English name out of the dictionary. He chose Eddy—he liked that it also referred to flowing water.\n\nPerhaps the greatest change was that they were suddenly in a world of Black and white. Even the Chinese Americans felt unfamiliar. On Eddy’s first day of school, he approached two women wearing earrings and makeup and shyly asked which one of them was his teacher. They laughed; they were thirteen, too.\n\nEddy’s parents were preoccupied with work. His brother, who went by Peter, studied English and worked at Burger King with their father. His sister, Lili, waitressed and attended community college. Eddy’s grandparents took home expired food from the grocery store. “In China, I had whatever I wanted,” Eddy recalled. “In the U.S., we had nothing.”\n\nEddy, who had been a decent student in China, recalls a day, during his first year of high school, when his teacher asked everyone to bring in a newspaper clipping. He didn’t understand what that was or where to find one. He began skipping class and hanging out at Lincoln Square Park, playing kickball with Chinese immigrant boys and girls. Other teen-agers referred to them as “Vietcong” or “Ching-Chong Chinaman.” San Francisco gangsters offered Eddy and his friends pocket money to run errands. At first, they weren’t interested. But they eventually graduated from kickball to slick clothes and elaborate hair styles modelled on Duran Duran and Hong Kong pop idols.\n\nEddy was fourteen when he fell in with a group of local criminals, most of whom were in their twenties and thirties. He stopped going to school completely, and he rarely slept at home. He remembers going to see “Year of the Dragon” at a theatre full of Chinatown gangsters wearing black trenchcoats. Everyone cheered on the bad guys. When he was fifteen, he was arrested for shoplifting a jacket. Undeterred, he and his friends started stealing car stereos. There was no vision of the future beyond a family-style feast in Chinatown if they scored a good one.\n\nEddy wanted to prove that he was tough. He and another teen robbed a gambling house in broad daylight. He worked nights as security at a brothel in San Francisco, sitting at the window with a walkie-talkie and a shotgun. He remembers watching one of the sex workers seated at the bar between shifts. She was bathed in red light, hunched over, long hair flowing down her back, writing a letter to her boyfriend in prison. It was one of the first times Eddy thought about what it would be like if something went wrong.\n\nOn January 6, 1986, Eddy and two other teen-agers invaded the home of a family who owned and operated shops in San Francisco’s Chinatown. They ambushed the parents at gunpoint when they returned to the house at night, and locked the children in a bathroom. They tied up the husband and hit him. They tore off the wife’s clothes, threatened to rape her, and pretended to take compromising photos of her with an unloaded camera. They spent hours in the family’s house. At one point, Eddy wandered into the living room and noticed a toy robot. He began playing with it, momentarily forgetting where he was. He was sixteen.\n\nEddy and one of his accomplices drove the wife to the couple’s shops, ending up at one on Jackson Street, where they took anything that looked valuable. The police pulled them over as they were driving the wife home—Eddy had forgotten to turn on the headlights.\n\nHis parents had no money to hire a lawyer. A behavioral analyst described Eddy as a “lost soul,” incapable of making any decisions on his own. Older criminals had assured him that, as a minor, he wouldn’t receive serious punishment. His family was ashamed of what he had done. His father thought that he should just admit wrongdoing and beg for forgiveness. “It was very Chinese,” Lili recalled. Eddy was tried as an adult and convicted of sixteen felony counts, including kidnapping. He was sentenced to seven years to life.\n\n“I was a follower,” he told me. “I wasn’t a leader.”\n\nEddy spent much of 1986 in juvenile-detention centers; when he turned eighteen, he was sent to San Quentin, which held the state’s most violent offenders. Eddy was told that he was the facility’s youngest inmate. California’s prisons were not as crowded as they would become, and he moved into a single cell.\n\nEddy was welcomed by a Samoan inmate named Tuffy, who gave him a basket with chips, instant ramen, soy sauce, and some magazines. At the time, inmates at San Quentin were separated according to race or affiliation, groups referred to as “cars.” There were biker cars, neo-Nazi cars, and cars for specific street gangs; Asians and Pacific Islanders were a small enough group to constitute a single car, marked “Other” on the prison’s intake form. Joining a car was a matter of pragmatism, necessitated by safety and camaraderie. Each car placed members in useful positions within the prison bureaucracy—the kitchen and the commissary, the laundry, and processing.\n\nBeing Other meant that it was easier to avoid turf wars. And the rules laid down by elders like Tuffy kept Eddy largely insulated from the drugs and the violence around him. Eddy and his cohort rarely fought with other cars; during lockdowns, they often picked up extra work shifts. “Model minorities,” Eddy joked. He was constantly attempting to befriend volunteers and find pen pals. “You’re always trying to get someone,” he explained—friends and also potential lovers. “If you don’t have connection or hope, you think to yourself, Why should I be good?” Older inmates told him he would likely do only seven years, maybe a couple more.\n\nVisitation policies were relatively lax at the time, and his parents came as often as they could. They would bring crab and eat it with Eddy in the open fields inside the prison walls. They never told Eddy’s grandparents why he was no longer around. At first, his parents had assumed that he would be released after not too long; in time, the situation simply became too hard to explain. They would stage photographs that made it look as if Eddy were studying or working out of state. His grandparents died without learning the truth.\n\nEddy experienced many firsts while incarcerated: the first time he wrote a letter, the first time he saw a man stabbed, the first time he ate an apple fritter. His friends in Oakland had been mostly Chinese. Now he recognized similarities between Chinese and Samoans, Asians and African Americans. He participated in a sweat-lodge ceremony. An older Black inmate he called Pops talked to him about philosophy, and taught him how to play handball. Pops encouraged him to read Hermann Hesse’s “Siddhartha,” and Eddy found a copy in Chinese. Eddy got into bodybuilding, then yoga, and then Pilates. He fell in love for the first and second times—the result of his letter-writing with women on the outside. It was while he was incarcerated that he first told his father he loved him.\n\nHe learned English and began writing poetry. He learned to type and became a Toastmaster. He watched many, many episodes of “The O.C.” He picked up the guitar. He learned about the AIDS epidemic and educated other inmates in sexual health. He sang in the church choir. He joked around with bikers and skinheads. He read “Siddhartha” again, this time in English. He never once cried.\n\nIn September, 1998, Eddy’s petition for parole was approved. His parents got a room ready for him at home. He had job offers from a Chinatown youth center and a law firm, and he planned to enroll at San Francisco State. All that remained, one of the parole-board commissioners explained, was for the governor to sign off. The commissioner told Eddy, “Wait until everything is over and done with before you pack your suitcase.” But he began giving away his cassette tapes and books.\n\n“I remember the four of you—you, Alicia, Momo, Jeanne—came into the door, into the study hall,” Eddy told me recently. “I was just very surprised. This was the first time I seen four Asians coming in.”\n\nI met Eddy in the winter of 1998, as he awaited news of his release date. I was volunteering as part of a program administered by Patten College. Most of the volunteers were Berkeley undergraduates, and we were drawn to the program for various reasons. Earlier that year, I had volunteered at a conference of activists, scholars, and artists in the emerging prison-abolition movement. I was already working with so-called at-risk youth in the East Bay. Now I saw clearly what it meant for there to be a pipeline from underserved schools to prisons.\n\nMost of us were middle-class kids walking into a prison for the first time. We couldn’t wear blue (the color of the inmates’ uniforms), but the searches of our backpacks and jackets were perfunctory. The inmates took college-level courses, and we talked them through their assigned readings about due process, Emma Goldman, the bicameral system. We told them about innovations in pizza and computing. They taught us about Stevie Wonder, the power of poetry, the bus systems of Los Angeles, the importance of looking someone in the eye when you spoke to him. We never asked what any of them had done to end up in prison.\n\nI was not expecting to meet as many Asian inmates as I did. Statistics about the number of Asians and Pacific Islanders who are incarcerated are imprecise, but it is estimated that during the nineteen-nineties this population increased by two hundred and fifty per cent. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, men in the Other category are imprisoned at three times the rate of white men. The Other female category has the highest imprisonment rate of any ethnic or racial group.\n\nAt first, Eddy seemed serious and formal. But I was drawn to him. He was so desperate to learn. I’d sometimes ask him questions in Chinese, and, wary of making the guards uncomfortable, he would answer in English. He shared poems and scraps of memoir with us, and his questions about politics and history were so wide-ranging that I had no idea what classes he was actually taking.\n\nOn our last day as tutors, Eddy passed me an envelope containing a bracelet he had made out of tiny beads. The beads spelled out “Hard Boiled,” the name of Berkeley’s Asian American newspaper; we often brought issues for the inmates to read. I gave him a small rock that I had picked up while visiting the Great Wall of China, years before.\n\nWe wrote letters after I graduated; I grew familiar with Eddy’s tiny, compressed cursive. Around this time, he also befriended a volunteer named Shelly Smith, with whom he struck up a romantic, largely epistolary relationship. His letters to me always began with a few encouraging lines about whatever minor personal stresses I’d relayed to him. In June, 1999, he wrote to tell me that his parole request had just been turned down by the governor, Gray Davis, a Democrat who had taken office in January. In 1994, California voters had passed the Three Strikes law, increasing sentencing for people with multiple felonies, and Davis frequently turned down parole requests from life-term inmates. “You must be wondering how I must be feeling right now,” Eddy wrote. “Well, you might not believe this, but aside from feeling relief I also feel a sense of excitement. Relief because I am no longer drifting in an endless sea, excitement because I’ll have even more accomplishments and support when I go to my next hearing. I don’t feel sad at all. Or maybe it just hasn’t hit me yet.”\n\nIn April, 2000, Eddy became one of the first inmates in the program to earn an associate’s degree. He continued taking classes. That year, some Berkeley students arrived at San Quentin wearing yellow armbands. One of them explained that there was a strike on campus to defend Berkeley’s ethnic-studies department against proposed cutbacks. “I think that’s where I first really tried to understand more” about Asian American history, Eddy said. These students were free, and yet they wanted more. He was reading bell hooks and encouraging younger inmates to do the same. He exchanged writing with poets like Ishle Yi Park and published his own zines. He had ascended to the status of O.G.—original gangster—defusing tensions with other cars. Anmol Chaddha, a Berkeley undergraduate, was teaching a class in the prison on apartheid-era South Africa. One student asked why Blacks, who made up a majority of South Africans, acceded to minority rule. Eddy turned to the student. “Look at us,” Chaddha remembers him saying. “Look at our situation. We vastly outnumber the guards. But we’re sitting here, generally complacent with the situation.”\n\nThere was never a golden age of incarceration. Yet there were moments in the recent past when institutions made greater gestures toward rehabilitation. In the early nineties, nearly twenty per cent of federal inmates had taken a college course while incarcerated. But a provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned incarcerated people from accessing Pell Grants. By 2004, the figure had dropped to around ten per cent, as programs that offered associate’s or bachelor’s degrees to inmates closed.\n\nEddy wanted more from San Quentin’s classes, so, in 2002, he and three other inmates, Stephen Liebb, Viet Mike Ngo, and Rico Riemedio, circulated a petition to have ethnic studies incorporated into the prison’s curriculum. Eddy had managed to avoid getting into serious trouble for sixteen years, but now he, Mike, and Rico were put in solitary confinement. Eddy was guilty of sharing his writings with outsiders without prison approval.\n\nEddy sent a letter to Hard Boiled, the Berkeley newspaper, inquiring about its submissions policy. Chaddha, an editor, agreed to print whatever Eddy sent in. He asked if there was anything else he could do. Eddy requested help finding a lawyer.\n\nChaddha recognized that Eddy needed not just a lawyer but a political campaign. Chaddha started the Asian Prisoner Support Committee with Yuri Kochiyama, a longtime activist who had been a confidant of Malcolm X in the sixties. The committee’s immediate aim was to support Eddy, Mike, and Rico, who became known as the San Quentin Three. Mike and Rico were eventually transferred out of solitary. But Eddy, who was technically still eligible for parole, remained in isolation for eleven months.\n\nChaddha consulted Victor Hwang, a civil-rights lawyer he had learned about in an Asian-American-studies class. Hwang introduced him to a network of lawyers, community leaders, and local politicians, all of whom were, in a sense, alumni of the nineteen-sixties social movements that had birthed Asian American identity. Chaddha needed to persuade state legislators to support Eddy the next time he was up for parole.\n\nIn May, 2003, Eddy was sent to the California State Prison in Solano. As a teen-ager, he had been processed at an inmate-reception center; from the yard, he could see Solano being constructed, just across the street. Since he’d entered the system, in 1986, California had built three new universities and nineteen new prisons. The state’s prison population had more than doubled.\n\nA campaign slowly arose to support Eddy. Paul Dosh, a Berkeley graduate student who had taught Eddy in San Quentin, performed poetry in the streets to raise money for Eddy’s lawyers. Eddy wrote as many as ten letters a day to friends, former volunteers, politicians, activists, and college students. Ben Wang, an undergraduate at the University of California, Davis, who began corresponding with Eddy, said, “From inside a state prison, he was able to network and build a community.” Jeanne Loh, another Berkeley tutor Eddy had grown close to in the late nineties, helped him set up a blog. In his posts, he would muse about prison food, shout-out friends, share poetry, and even campaign for political candidates whom he’d befriended through the mail. At one point, he asked people to stop sending him books; he’d received more than he could possibly read.\n\n“At the beginning, we didn’t tell anyone, because we lost face,” his father recalled, from the family home in Oakland. “We were ashamed. We couldn’t face the Chinese community.” But, after hearing Kochiyama speak at a rally, he realized that he needed to do the same. Chaddha took Eddy’s parents to Sacramento, where they went door to door, talking to legislators. “They were the closers,” Chaddha told me. He remembers a meeting of Asian American community leaders where Eddy’s mother, once too mortified to admit that her son was in prison, gave an impromptu speech to a ballroom full of strangers about her family’s journey from Guangzhou to San Quentin.\n\nEddy began studying meditation. In one exercise, he had to count to ten. If any thoughts intruded, he had to start over. The exercise resembled his struggle for parole; he applied more than a dozen times. In November, 2004, the board voted in favor of his release. Gray Davis had been recalled by California voters, and the governor was now Arnold Schwarzenegger, who did not object to the board’s recommendation. One day, in March, 2005, a prison official summoned Eddy and said, “Hey, Zheng, type out this ducat”—a pass that inmates need to move freely. It was for Eddy’s release.\n\nBut the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 had expanded the categories that made noncitizen felons subject to deportation. On Eddy’s release from Solano, he was handed over to ice agents, who drove him to a field office in San Francisco. As the van made its way through the city at lunchtime, Eddy looked out the window. He hadn’t seen so many free people in nearly twenty years.\n\nHe spent almost two years detained by ICE in Marysville, north of Sacramento. While in custody, he married Shelly Smith, the volunteer he had befriended in the late nineties. “There is nothing traditional about our marriage,” he reflected on his blog. “We’re just two pieces of a giant puzzle finding our places to complete and fulfill our mission.”\n\nAs more people learned about Eddy’s situation, the movement to free him intensified. The family he’d victimized had largely been silent throughout the parole process. But, while Eddy was in Marysville, the daughter, Jenny Tam, submitted a letter to the immigration court. “My family is no different from his,” she wrote. “It saddens me to see so many people rallying for Eddy.” Tam went on to describe the isolation and paranoia that had come to define their home life: “Part of me is afraid that I will feel like the one who has done something wrong. . . . To me, any achievements he claims were done to sway the court to rule in his favor. My firm wish is that Eddy be deported.”\n\nIn July, 2006, an immigration judge ordered Eddy deported to China. But the case was appealed to the Ninth Circuit, and in February, 2007, Eddy was allowed to leave ICE custody while awaiting the ruling. As he signed the paperwork for his release, his mother combed his hair. He was greeted outside the detention center by supporters and a swarm of journalists. After thanking everyone, Eddy walked to his sister’s Lexus and put a box with the battery for his ankle monitor in the trunk. He reached up to pull the lid of the trunk down, as people did in 1986. “Stop,” his sister said. She pushed a button, and the trunk closed by itself.\n\nEddy’s friends from Lincoln Square Park, now leading law-abiding lives, took him out for a Chinese banquet—an elevated version of what they had done, in the eighties, after stealing a car stereo. “Everybody’s taking me out to eat,” Eddy said. “Every time they ask me what I want, I say, ‘I don’t know.’ ‘Sushi? What is that?’ I’d never been to a sushi restaurant. ‘What do you want to order?’ I don’t know. I’m not from this world.”\n\nLast June, I visited Eddy in Oakland, where he lives in the hills with his second wife, Lisa, a Chinese American social worker, and their eight-year-old daughter, Abella. (He and Smith separated in 2012. “She’s still one of my closest friends,” he told me.) Eddy drives his daughter to school along the route he used to walk when cutting class.\n\nEddy is fifty-two. He has broad shoulders and sharp cheekbones, and his gaze is piercing and alert. There’s a small, faded tattoo of the Chinese character for “tiger” on his left hand—a reminder that he entered prison during the Year of the Tiger. A corner of the living room is cordoned off as an office, which contains the possessions that have defined his life since he was sixteen. In addition to boxes of letters and photographs, there are thick binders with his trial and parole documents. There’s a giant photograph of him as a fifteen-year-old with slicked-back hair, dressed all in white. Behind his desk are the books he was given while incarcerated. There’s a tiny statue of Bruce Lee, plaques, and photographs from Eddy’s bodybuilding days, when he was alarmingly muscular. His desk faces a garden, where he planted artichokes—a reminder of a fellow-inmate from San Quentin, who concocted a way to cook the vegetables in his cell. There was a Porsche out front, a hand-me-down from his sister. When Eddy was imprisoned, Lili made her way from community college to Berkeley, mastering English while working three jobs. She studied accounting and became the first woman from mainland China to make partner at Deloitte. She cites her path as an example of the American Dream. But she sees it in Eddy’s story, too. “I would say he’s more successful than me,” she said.\n\nEddy and I drove to San Francisco on the day that California lifted its ban on in-person gatherings. At Portsmouth Square, a park at Chinatown’s eastern edge, neighborhood elders played cards wearing surgical masks and gloves. Eddy tried to find the site of the gambling house he stuck up in the mid-eighties—his graduation from petty theft and shoplifting to armed robbery. He recalled the door being ajar, the shape of a victim’s pendant, what they ate afterward. But he could not remember what he’d felt.\n\nOn his release from detention, Eddy had got a job with the Community Youth Center of San Francisco, where he mainly worked with Asian American youth. His team would walk through Chinatown, checking in on store owners and the kids posted on street corners. We passed a storefront, and Eddy stiffened. This was the site of the shop he had robbed after the home invasion. When C.Y.C. was doing its neighborhood walks, he whispered, he never had the courage to go down this block.\n\nA lot of Eddy’s post-incarceration work is animated by a belief in restorative justice, which seeks to put victims and perpetrators of violence in conversation with one another. It’s an alternative to traditional models of retribution, and, when it works, the victim and the perpetrator come to understand each other’s history and recognize their membership in a shared community. In the years after Eddy’s release, he, his mother, and his brother were each mugged, on separate occasions, outside his parents’ home. Each time, Eddy explained contexts that can compel people to crime, trying to disabuse his family of their “anti-Blackness.” “It’s so much easier to be on the other side,” he said. “To hate. To lock these people up. It’s easier than trying to convince people that’s not the way.” When he contacted the police after his mugging, he told them that it was not to press charges against his assailant but, rather, to pursue a restorative-justice session if they ever found him.\n\nIn 2015, a mutual friend delivered a letter of apology from Eddy to the woman he had kidnapped. David Tam, her son, told me, “It’s something that we are all actively trying to cope with in our daily lives. The more press he gets, the more he brings up some of these unresolved emotions. It’s difficult. And, you know, I’m not rooting for the guy.” As he pointed out, his family can’t appeal the governor’s pardon. “I could save a thousand people,” Eddy said, but it would not erase the family’s “life sentence of suffering.”\n\nThis summer, Eddy and I went to the Ping Yuen Houses, popularly known as the Pings, a four-building public-housing complex along Pacific Avenue in Chinatown. The population is largely Asian, with an increasing number of Black families. Outside, we were met by members of C.Y.C. and of United Playaz, another San Francisco-based violence-prevention organization, and by Guy Hudson, a fifty-seven-year-old Black organizer and the self-described “mayor of Hunters Point,” one of the last strongholds of the city’s African American population.\n\nA C.Y.C. leader took Hudson aside and told him about a Cambodian teen-ager they’d been working with, whose family had recently moved to Hunters Point. A group of local kids had been bullying him, but the family didn’t want the police involved. “Get me their names or a photo,” Hudson said, “and I’ll handle it.”\n\nIn 2010, after a string of assaults against Asian Americans, Eddy persuaded C.Y.C. to open a branch office in Bayview–Hunters Point, to provide outreach to the Asian American, Black, and Latinx youth there. “I done told my fellas—they’re over here in the community to help their people, just like we help our people,” Hudson explained. “If you need help, Eddy and his people will help you.”\n\nIn the past year, numerous videos in which older Asian Americans are assaulted by strangers have gone viral. Although the majority of anti-Asian bias incidents are committed by white people, many of the videos have Black assailants. Several were filmed in the Bay Area, and, though their circulation brought new attention to anti-Asian racism, they also inspired a new, influencer-driven style of social-media activism. The hashtags and Instagram infographics occasionally complicate the work of longtime organizers and community workers. “Media blows that Asian-and-African-American thing way out of proportion,” Hudson said. He pulled out his phone to show me the youth basketball team he coaches, which is evenly split among Black, Latinx, and Asian kids: “When we come running out, they think they’re gonna whup us. But we’re beasts.”\n\nThe Ping Yuen staff had invited the groups to discuss ways to bring residents together. Everyone was trying to figure out if there was significant tension between the Asian and the Black residents, or if they just needed more occasions to socialize. A staffer observed that bingo was a great way to bring community elders together. But they needed to reach young people, too. Eventually, they settled on a daytime party, with Black and Chinese m.c.s alternating songs. Someone volunteered Hudson’s son, a local rapper. Hudson stared intently at his phone before holding it up for everyone to see. His son just wanted to know where and when to show up.\n\nIt was the kind of mundane, detail-oriented meeting necessary to build alliances. Out of context, the questions people asked might have sounded funny. A Black community organizer wanted to know if there was a word “in Asian” that meant the same thing in English, since the party needed a catchy name. Eddy leaned forward and said that the name of the housing project, Ping Yuen, means “Peaceful Garden”: “What if we call it the Peaceful Garden jam?” Hudson started working on a chant: “Say it loud / Ping Yuen and I’m proud.” As we were leaving, Hudson said goodbye to all the C.Y.C. volunteers in Chinese, and then turned to Eddy with one of the few other phrases he knows in Chinese: “You owe me money.”\n\nIn 2015, after a series of rulings in Eddy’s legal cases, Governor Jerry Brown pardoned him. Two years later, he became an American citizen. Within the Asian American community, he has an unusual kind of credibility. He can talk openly about his experience as both a perpetrator and a survivor of violence, and as someone at ease with his contradictions.\n\nOne afternoon, he Zoomed with an Asian American reading group that had invited him to speak on a panel about prison abolition. “Happy new breath,” he began. He talked about his personal history, but he kept his answers brief, ceding his time to the other panelists, who were women. At one point, he extolled the virtues of chi, the Chinese belief in breath. He said that “chi” was also an acronym for “culture, history, and identity,” explaining that the roots of abolitionist politics are in personal revolution. “Ethnic studies saved my life,” he said. After the call, I told him I was surprised by how deferential he had been—most people in the group had likely never had the chance to speak with someone who’d served time. He said that he was conscious of being a “cis het male,” and he didn’t want to “take up space.” I asked where he had learned this language. “Inside, you have to be macho and show no fear,” he replied. “Out here, you start changing your perspective.”\n\nOn another Zoom, he addressed a gathering of philanthropic funders, who operated in a different register—the pieties of nonprofit-speak. “Happy new breath,” he said again. Eddy has spent much of the past year launching the New Breath Foundation, which raises money for progressive Asian American and Pacific Islander groups. “When I was in solitary confinement, I really understood how breath could change everything,” he told me. “I saw how I took breath for granted.”\n\nHaving spent decades building relationships with Bay Area gangsters and politicians, he was turning to grant-making. Only 0.2 per cent of philanthropic dollars go to organizations specifically serving the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities; Eddy’s goal was to raise ten million dollars for New Breath. The first disbursement, of a hundred and thirty thousand dollars, came in March, shortly after a white man killed eight people, six of them Asian women, at three Atlanta-area spas and massage parlors. By the end of summer, New Breath had given more than two million dollars in grants to groups including the Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants, which provides mental-health services to Southeast Asian refugees, and Red Canary Song, which organizes sex workers.\n\nOn the Zoom, Eddy warned that philanthropy often appeared to be a “money-laundering machine” that let wealthy funders feel good about themselves and their largesse. “The sooner philanthropy is aware of that, the sooner you’re gonna feel even better in having that wealth,” he said.\n\nOne evening, Eddy and I went to the Far East Café, one of the oldest restaurants in Chinatown, where the Reverend Norman Fong, a prominent Bay Area community leader, had organized a “solidarity dinner” honoring Jesse Jackson. Fong was distressed by the year’s viral videos, and by the stories circulating about tension between Black and Asian American communities.\n\nIn 1982, Vincent Chin, a twenty-seven-year-old Chinese American, was murdered in Detroit by two white men who allegedly blamed the Japanese auto industry for a decline in American jobs. The attack on Chin, and the leniency of the sentence—neither attacker went to prison—was a catalyzing event for Asian Americans. Jackson was one of the first national civil-rights leaders to speak about Chin’s killing, hosting a press conference with Chin’s mother at Cameron House, a Christian community center in San Francisco’s Chinatown. Fong and others had raised money to fly Jackson out from Chicago, for the dinner at the Far East Café and an event the following day at Cameron House.\n\nIn the banquet hall, everyone negotiated the new, and temporary, freedom of post-mask life—the awkward handshakes, the lunges that never materialized in hugs. Leaders from various Bay Area Asian American civil-rights and activist groups were there, as were graying activists from the social-justice organization the Rainbow push Coalition, the original incarnation of which Jackson founded in the seventies. Fong, who has a kind of throwback energy, kept pumping his fist and shouting, “Reverend Jackson is in tha house!” Fong and Jackson sat at a table with Mayor London Breed. Another table was crowded with state senators and city officials. Chesa Boudin, San Francisco’s district attorney, took Eddy aside to get advice on a case.\n\n“There’s nobody quite like Eddy in San Francisco,” Boudin told me later. “Someone who has both caused tremendous harm and paid a serious price for that, and somehow found redemption.” Boudin’s tenure as D.A. has been defined by an openness to rethinking criminalization. He described a recent case, in which a video of an Asian American getting robbed went viral. The D.A.’s office had charged the perpetrator but wasn’t sure what to do with the person who’d filmed and posted the crime. Boudin contacted Eddy, who persuaded the victim to meet with the filmer. “Eddy’s been someone who has dived in head first to alleviate harm and build bridges,” Boudin said.\n\nAt the dinner, Butch Wing, a Chinese American organizer for the Rainbow push Coalition, began weeping as he recounted Jackson’s 1984 Presidential run. Jackson, weakened by Parkinson’s, slowly rose from his table and shuffled toward him. Everyone began cheering. When Jackson finally reached the podium, he wrapped his arms around Wing.\n\nJackson speaks in a hoarse whisper, but his familiar sing-song cadences are intact. Everyone leaned in as he recalled Vincent Chin’s murder, connecting it to the more recent killing of George Floyd. “Your struggle is our struggle,” he told the largely Asian American crowd.\n\nAfter the dinner, Eddy stepped out onto an empty Chinatown street. He had been invited to take a quick photo with Jackson, and was still buzzing about the fact that local leaders, many of whom once advocated for his freedom, had come to our table to say hello or to ask him for help. “It’s all about timing,” he said. The way guai ren—fortuitous people who help you along the way—have reappeared throughout his life. Above us, red lanterns crisscrossed the sky. He took a picture to remember the night.\n\nWhen Eddy first reëntered society, it was easy to go wherever he was needed. He would talk to any audience, never thinking to ask for an honorarium. If there was a territorial dispute between rival Chinatown factions, he would rush to defuse it. He became a co-director of the Asian Prisoner Support Committee, the organization that Chaddha and Kochiyama had founded to support him. Eddy and other formerly incarcerated men attended hearings for people like Ny Nourn, a Cambodian American refugee who was incarcerated for sixteen years for her part in a murder perpetrated by an abusive ex-boyfriend. She was paroled in 2017, but, like Eddy, she was remanded to ICE custody. Last year, Governor Gavin Newsom pardoned her, effectively ending her deportation proceedings. Today, she co-directs the A.P.S.C., which the New Breath Foundation funds. “He’s a leader who knows the roots,” she told me, of Eddy.\n\nEddy says that when he was in prison he had a “narrower range of emotions.” “He had a kind of intensity to him,” Wang, the former U.C. Davis student, recalled. People who knew him back then still sense it sometimes. These days, he is often seen as famous or well off; after all, he’s a philanthropist. “That’s a certain image,” Eddy told me. “But in daily life I have issues—family issues, marital issues. I have my own life, the traumas that come with post-incarceration.”\n\nI asked Eddy if, when he was in prison, it was hard to imagine life on the outside. “It wasn’t difficult,” he said. “The sky did not change much. The clouds, the mountains, they did not change. But the people, the life style, the technology, everything changed. Even though we get access to television and radio, people from the outside, we’re not part of it. I’m not part of that world anymore. To look beyond the wall to see the mountains—you see the razor wire, you see the wall, the paint is peeling. You got to look beyond that to see the mountains.”\n\nIn prison, he explained, you lose your perception of time. Routine keeps you sane, and yet you live with a constant sense of anticipation, subject to institutional whims. You keep secrets for guards or officers, and then one day they turn on you for being overfamiliar.\n\nAt times, it feels as if the only people who truly understand Eddy are those with whom he experienced the “fellowship” of incarceration. Eddy, Mike, and Rico—the San Quentin Three. They once stood in the yard and looked up at Mt. Tamalpais, in Marin County. “Freedom is close enough,” Eddy remembers saying to himself. “It’s torture.” They promised one another, “One day, we gonna climb up there.” More often, they focussed on the yard, to avoid putting themselves through that anguish.\n\nThis summer, they finally did it. Eddy, Mike, Rico, and Stephen—the ethnic-studies petitioners—hiked up Mt. Tam. They couldn’t find San Quentin. Eddy looked up and saw three butterflies—“I got a picture to prove it,” he assured me. The men followed the butterflies until they came to a clearing. From there, San Quentin was so close that they started identifying the tower blocks and the quadrants of the yard.\n\nThey spent twenty minutes looking at the prison from the mountain. Eddy handed his phone to one of his friends, who took a picture of him perched on two large rocks. His face is clenched, the prison is behind him, between his legs, and he is pretending to shit on it. ♦\n\nNew Yorker Favorites\n\nHow we became infected by chain e-mail.\n\nTwelve classic movies to watch with your kids.\n\nThe secret lives of fungi.\n\nThe photographer who claimed to capture the ghost of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nWhy are Americans still uncomfortable with atheism?\n\nThe enduring romance of the night train.\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker."
