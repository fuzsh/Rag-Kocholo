        "text": "Former school in Mid-Levels, Hong Kong\n\nChung Wah Middle School (Chinese: 中華中學) was a leftist school located at 1 Chico Terrace, Mid-Levels, Hong Kong. It opened in 1926 and was shut down by the British Hong Kong government for its involvement in the 1967 riots. Following the 1997 Handover, some school alumni went on to serve as high-ranking officials in the new government.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe school was founded by Wong Lan-koon, a grandfather of Elsie Leung.[1]\n\nOn 16 October 1967, police raided the school and seized more than 3,500 inflammatory posters.[2]\n\nOn 27 November 1967, two explosions were reported at the school, with one student seriously injured in the school laboratory. Residents in the area and police alleged that the school was being used as a bomb factory.[3][4] The injured student, 18-year-old Siu Wai-man, lost a part of his left hand. He was charged with possession of explosive substances and sentenced to four years in prison.[5]\n\nThe day after the explosions, four other Communist schools were raided by police for suspected bomb-making, namely the Heung To Middle School [zh], Hon Wah Middle School [zh], Fukien Middle School, and the Mongkok Workers' Children School.[6]\n\nFollowing the explosions, the school was immediately shut down by the government. In mid-1968, the government de-registered the school under the Education Ordinance on the grounds that it had been \"willfully used for the unlawful manufacture and storage of dangerous explosive substances\".[7][8]\n\nIn late-1968, it was reported in the South China Morning Post that all former students of Chung Wah Middle School had transferred to Hon Wah Middle School.[9]\n\nNotable alumni\n\n[edit]\n\nElsie Leung – the first Secretary for Justice of the HKSAR[1]\n\nTung Chee-hwa – the first Chief Executive of the HKSAR[4]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of secondary schools in Hong Kong"
