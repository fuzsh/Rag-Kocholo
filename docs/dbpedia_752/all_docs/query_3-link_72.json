        "text": "âThere were just six of us, and everyone attended all the meetings. Junior members like me could listen in when our bosses talked about strategies and partner dynamics, and we learnt from the best.â As Temasek became an active investor, first regionally and then globally, the team was responsible for introducing Temasek to the outside world. âWe had to go out there to these global funds and explain who we were, what we did, and the connections we could help them make,â she says. âIf people didn't know anything about you, why would they do business with you? How could they trust you?â\n\nOver time, the companyâs external narrative matured, taking shape in the first Temasek Review â a public report of its portfolio performance â published in 2004. The same year, Temasek earned triple-A credit ratings from S&P and Moodyâs for the quality of its portfolio.\n\nâTo me, that made it real,â says Ming Pey. âIâd spent years explaining our commercial operations and telling funds and companies why they would want us as an investor. Now there were these public markers recognising Temasekâs commitment to transparency and accountability, and reporting on the portfolio and performance we had achieved.â\n\nThe years that followed were hectic as the pace of investment picked up, she remembers. By 2005, there were various sector-focused investment teams within Temasek, and the company had offices in Mumbai, Beijing and Shanghai. By this time, Ming Pey had joined the Direct Investment team, covering sectors such as Technology and Financial Services. âWe were growing the portfolio and doing deals very quickly. I remember it coincided with the launch of the BlackBerry device â suddenly, everyone could work anytime, anywhere, and many of us â and our bosses â were online almost 24/7,â she says.\n\nWriting the next chapter\n\nAs the company grew and more investment staff came on board, Temasekâs âDNAâ evolved. âWe used to operate in a small, cosy and family-like environment where everyone knew and took care of one another. But over time, the environment became more professional, and the focus shifted to achieving performance and delivering results.â\n\nIt was a shift that Ming Pey noted and voiced out to the then-head of HR Sebastian Tan.\n\nâI asked him what kind of organisation we wanted to build â did we want to maintain a caring and nurturing environment, or push for a high performance and returns-oriented culture,â she recalls. âHe asked me why the two could not co-exist, and then put down a challenge: if I felt so strongly about it, then I should do something to make it so. I took that as a personal challenge.â When she returned from maternity leave in 2007, Ming Pey joined the Organisation & People team to work on Organisational Development, including projects and initiatives that would ensure Temasek retained its strong sense of purpose and heritage, even as it continued to grow its portfolio and talent pool.\n\nâThis was where I could leverage my familiarity with how Temasek had evolved,â she says. âBy integrating these stories into our internal communications and staff engagement exercises, we could help people understand our purpose and our way of life.â\n\nThings crystallised in 2019 when she became a part of the working team for T2030, a 10-year roadmap for the firm that would guide the building of a resilient and forward looking portfolio in an increasingly complex world. âBut before we could find a way forward, we had to first look back,â she says. One of her first tasks was to compile a âreport cardâ for what the firm had achieved in the decade to 2020.\n\nIn the process, she was able to âconnect the dotsâ, and see how the various business and institutional initiatives undertaken by the firm had come together to create the global investment powerhouse that Temasek had become.\n\nThe work Temasek does often takes years to play out, she says. âI tell those stories to my juniors so they understand how their decisions today will impact the company in the future. To me, that generational thinking is very important â to know that what I do today, somebody else is going to inherit.\n\n\"My hope is that a young employee in the future will look back at all the things we are doing today, and think to themselves, âSo this is what they were trying to achieve for usâ. I hope they value how it all came together, and go on to shape the Temasek that future generations will build on.\"\n\nOver the course of her 37-year career, Margina had a front-row seat to Temasekâs growth story, as the company expanded its portfolio and grew beyond Singapore to become a global investment powerhouse. She also witnessed several firsts, including Temasekâs first greenfield venture, the Pulau Ayer Merbau Complex, in 1984; the listing of SMRT in 2000 â incidentally, also the first time an urban rail operator had been listed anywhere in the world; the publication of the first Temasek Review and the opening of Temasekâs first overseas office in Mumbai, both in 2004. The same year, she celebrated with her colleagues when Temasek earned a triple-A credit rating from S&P and Moodyâs for the quality of its portfolio.\n\nShe moved with the company from the attic office in Fullerton Building to the CPF Building on Robinson Road, and then the Treasury Building at Shenton Way â which was renamed Temasek Tower â before finally settling in at its current premises at The Atrium@Orchard in Dhoby Ghaut in 2002.\n\nAs the scope of her job grew, Margina completed a company-sponsored diploma in Management Accounting & Finance, and as technology redefined the workplace, she acquired her first cell phone and computer skills.\n\nBy the time she retired in December 2014, Margina was Senior Associate in a Finance department that had expanded from two to over 50. Temasek itself had grown from the initial four staff members and portfolio of 35 Singapore companies, to a staff of 490 and more than 250 portfolio companies as of 31 March 2014. By then, it also had overseas offices in seven countries.\n\nAs she looks back on how far Temasek has come since she set foot into that Fullerton Building attic all those years ago, she is proud. But what she is most grateful for are the friendships that have endured.\n\nâTemasek was a big part of my life. It was where I built my career and found my best friendsâ¦ it will always feel like family.â\n\nMost days, Lim Ah Lee can be found by the window of Ward 2A, glued to the news on his Lexon radio. Other days, the longtime Surya Nursing Home resident hums along with the Mandarin classics playing on his constant companion and âbest friendâ.\n\nTo most, the radio has seen better days. But to the still-sharp 88-year-old, the small brown box connects him to the world.\n\nâDid you know the temple on Kusu Island is now 100 years old?â he asks. âI heard it on my radio.â\n\nâUncleâ Ah Lee tells anyone who will listen how he won the radio in a bingo game organised by Temasek some two decades ago.\n\nâââAt the time, the former leprosy sufferer was a charge of the Singapore Leprosy Relief Association (SILRA), the very first home adopted by Temasek under its T-Touch initiative in early 2002. The firm had decided then that giving should be a cornerstone of its culture, and through T-Touch, it could support staff-led volunteer initiatives and encourage volunteerism.\n\nIn those days, SILRA had about 90 residents. Like Uncle Ah Lee, many had spent decades living in the home. The stigma associated with leprosy meant visitors and volunteers were hard to come by, despite the fact that a cure for the disease had been available in Singapore since the 1950s. Many bore physical scars of the disease, but loneliness often felt like the worst one.\n\nThat was precisely why, when put to a company-wide vote, Temasek chose SILRA â it was where they were most needed. Their visits became a high point, providing the companionship and acceptance the residents craved.\n\nWhen SILRA was absorbed by Sunlove Home in 2018 and the building renamed Surya Nursing Home, the tradition continued: no festival goes by forgotten, and familiar faces regularly come by bearing ang pows, mooncakes and other treats, and stay to chat. âWe are always happy to see themâ¦ Every time Temasek comes, they bring a nice buffet. There was a pasar malam one time, and there is always bingo,â says Uncle Ah Lee.\n\nHe remembers the exact game in which the radio came to be his. It hadnât been going terribly well. âI think the volunteer covering the numbers for me kelong (rigged it), but I won the last radio,â he laughs.\n\nA search for white spaces\n\nPart of the groupâs mandate was to identify and invest in innovative technologies with the potential to drive the planet closer towards climate resilience, and Temasek towards a net-zero portfolio.\n\nâGiven the scale of the sustainability crisis, we didnât know where to start,â Immanuâel recalls.\n\nThe team cast its net wide, exploring everything from sustainable aviation fuels to nuclear fusion, attempting to uncover white spaces that could be explored, whether now or in the future.\n\nHe remembers then-CEO Ho Ching addressing him during one of their meetings. âI was the youngest one in the team then, and she said that we needed more young people in our team because it was going to be up to my generation â and the ones that came after us â to take the possibilities of nuclear energy forward.\n\nâI realised then that this was going to be a multi-decade-commitment, with an enormous potential for being a force for good.â\n\nThe teamâs first task was to put in place a robust framework that could guide both investment and strategic decisions. âThis levelled everyone up so we could drive the changes the world needed to see in a dedicated and measured way,â he says.\n\nImmanuâel himself trained his focus on decarbonisation, and within that, low carbon hydrogen, a topic close to his heart. He animatedly explains how low carbon hydrogen is a critical part of Singaporeâs future energy mix, given its limited access to renewable energy.\n\nâWe searched for under-addressed challenges and for potential solutions and policies that the firm could consider in its choice of investments. We had to think about why no one had solved them, and if they had tried and failed, then where the pitfalls lay.\n\nâWe went from problem to solution, then reverse-engineered our way back to better defining the problem. It was an iterative process.â\n\nImpact, for generations\n\nAs the headlines around sustainability evolved over the years, so did the mandate of the Sustainability Group. It now comprises three sub-groups overseeing Sustainability & Climate Change Strategy, Ecosperity, a platform for engagement and advocacy, and Sustainable Solutions, which Immanuâel heads.\n\nHis focus is on solutions that could have a direct impact on Temasek and its portfolio companies. Immanuâel also doubles up as a Director of Emerging Technologies, which looks further into the future, at nascent deep-tech ideas that, with the right support â including from companies like Temasek â could evolve into commercially viable technologies with the potential to make a big difference.\n\nâThe challenge is that these technologies are almost always very new. Some of them may not exist at any sort of scale yet, and of those that do exist, some may not succeed. You have to scientifically and systematically predict if itâs going to work, how that might impact our businesses, and if that impact will be long term.\n\nâThat said, Temasek is in the business of looking around the bend, so you never get bored,â he says.\n\nIt is quite a change from what he envisioned himself doing, Immanuâel admits. In finance, âcurrencyâ is viewed solely in terms of returns, risks and time dimensions. Today, his focus is on how money translates into value, not just in the immediate future, but for future generations.\n\nâThe idea of being in a company that is only interested in profit now feels empty. The pre-Temasek Immanuâel might have been okay with that, but not anymore,â he says. âIâve seen how Temasek puts time, money, commitment and people into bringing real value to communities, now and in the future.\n\nâIâve been infused with its DNA â and now Iâm hooked.â\n\nIt was intended as a âheads-upâ on a developing trend, says Franziska Zimmermann.\n\nIt was January 2019, during the annual âT-Huddleâ â Temasekâs leadership summit â that the Director of Sustainability & Climate Change Strategy made her presentation. âInvestors were increasingly being held accountable for the carbon emissions associated with their investment portfolios,â she says. âWe wanted to brief senior management on this development.â\n\nInstead, her presentation sparked an unprecedented decision: to target a 50% reduction in the net carbon emissions attributable to Temasekâs investment portfolio by 2030, compared to 2010 levels, and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nâWe didnât know yet how we would achieve this,â Franziska recalls, âbutâ we knew that this was where we needed to get to.â â\n\nThe decision marked a significant shift. âWe werenât just committing to a target; we were sending a powerful signal, both internally and externally.â\n\nPutting the planet in focus\n\nSustainability has been a consistent theme in Franziskaâs life.\n\nâI was born on Earth Day, so I guess you could say itâs a calling,â she laughs. Growing up in a small Swiss village, Franziska spent her days roaming the surrounding forests. âYou learn what the environment means, how it relates to you, your community, and your survival.â Her teenage years, marked by environmental catastrophes close to home â Chernobyl, chemical spills, and acid rain â underscored these critical lessons.\n\nAs a law student, she did her Masterâs thesis on environmental sustainability, and it remained a common thread in a career that spanned public and private-sector companies across Europe and Asia. âI felt it was something worth fighting for,â she says.\n\nFranziska joined Temasekâs Strategic and Public Affairs team in 2015, coincidentally, the year the Paris Agreement â the global pact to curb climate change â was signed. Temasek was growing its presence in Europe and was looking for someone who could translate policy into business impact. Responsible investing was gaining traction at the time, she says. âI remember my then-boss, Gary Ang saying to me: âWell Franziska, youâre passionate about the environment, why don't you look at whether this is something we should be tracking more closelyâ.â\n\nâI did my research, spoke to people, and began sending updates to senior management and the organisation whenever there was a development in the sustainability and climate space,â she recalls. She also took charge of Ecosperity, then a half-day conference that brought Temasekâs portfolio companies together to advance the twinning of environmental sustainability with economic development.\n\nThe 2016 haze added impetus to Temasekâs sustainability initiatives. As forests in Indonesia burned, Singapore grappled with the health and economic impacts, prompting intense media scrutiny on investors backing the companies responsible. While Temasek was not involved, the crisis led to a reassessment of potential risks within its investments. \"We needed to consider the types of businesses we wanted to invest in and establish clear boundaries,â says Franziska.\n\nThe realisation that sustainability needed to be a core consideration in evaluating investment opportunities led to the establishment of a project team to develop the frameworks to enable this.\n\nâWe co-developed the frameworks with the investment teams to strike the right balance between rigour and practicalityââââââ,â she recalls. By 2017, the frameworks had been integrated internally and communicated externally, solidifying sustainability as a permanent feature within the organisation.\n\nMeanwhile, Temasek was advancing several other key initiatives. In 2017, it established a sustainability team to test and mainstream sustainability strategies, investments and solutions within the company. A dedicated decarbonisation-focused investment platform, incubated by the team, would later be spun off as GenZero, with a mandate to accelerate decarbonisation through strategic investments and partnerships. Over the years, Ecosperity had also expanded into a global sustainability conference, attracting prominent leaders from the public and non-governmental sectors, captains of industry, and the academic community. The week-long conference engages participants in collaborative efforts to tackle the ongoing climate crisis and promote sustainable growth across Asia.\n\nâIt was a sign of maturity, of Temasek recognising that its influence extended beyond investing money, and that its voice, perspective, and convening power mattered and could make a difference,â says Franziska.\n\nââBy this timeâ, âTemasekâsâ Sustainabilityâ andâ âStewardship âGroup, âfirst announced in 2016, had gained visibility and traction as a âdepartment in its own right. âThis paved the way for us to bring together all these organic initiatives into a cohesive strategy.â\n\nUltimately, it laid the groundwork for Franziskaâs presentation at the T-Huddle in January 2019, and Temasekâs bold commitment.\n\nMaking good on green ambitions\n\nLooking back, Franziska is struck by how far Temasek has come in just a decade. For two consecutive years, in 2023 and 2024, the company was recognised by the Global Sovereign Fund as a leader in governance and sustainability. In 2024, it also released its inaugural sustainability report, sharing its goals, practices and performance with the aim of fostering trust and engaging in meaningful dialogue on the topic with key stakeholders.\n\nâSustainability is at the core of everything we do, and one of four strategic pillars of our T2030 10-year strategy,â she says. The cultural shift permeates all levels of the organisation, influencing daily operations and long-term planning. âEvery leader within the organisation considers how they can contribute within their area of responsibility. Weâve come a long way.â\n\nâWe know that to be successful as an investor, we have to operate in an environment thatâs healthy, where nature is intact and society thrives. Seeing our organisation boldly commit to that has been truly gratifying.â\n\nFrom passion to profession\n\nThe year 2018 marked a turning point for Yvonne. Taking a course on Politics, Business and the Common Good in the UK, she was struck by a question posed by her professor. âIf you're rethinking your career,â he challenged, âwhat about ensuring you do good while you make a living?â\n\nAfter 15 years in the fast-paced world of commercial television with Fox International Channels, âit was a eureka moment,â she says. Volunteering had been a consistent part of her life, but the possibility of integrating social impact into her â9 to 6â had never truly occurred.\n\nSerendipitously, she learned about Temasek Trust and its nascent social impact hub. âThe drawings for Temasek Shophouse were underway, and they were looking for someone to head the project,â she recalls. A two-hour conversation with then-CEO, Cheo Hock Kuan, had her firmly on board.\n\nThe idea was to bring changemakers under the same roof, and provide a space â and opportunities â for collaboration, co-working, and knowledge exchange, she says. To that end, Temasek Shophouse would house Temasek Trust, Temasek Foundation, and Stewardship Asia, as well as coworking partners like Asia-focused impact investor. Other spaces would allow people passionate about giving back to meet, host events or workshops, and draw in the public. Ultimately, it aspired to be the foundation for an ecosystem centred around social impact.\n\nâIn 2018, a social impact hub was still a novel concept. No one really knew how to take that idea and make it come alive,â she says. âWere we a co-working space? Another community centre? We also had to think of the kind of tenants and events we wanted to bring in.â These needed to be aligned with the Shophouseâs mission.\n\nâI remember going to meet the owners of Foreword Coffee,â she says. â I had to wait for an hour, but it was an interesting hour observing how they put differently-abled people on the front lines and taught them so patiently. I knew even before speaking to them that they were the right people to invite into our space.â\n\nThe team also experimented with promoting biodiversity, including rehousing a beehive found in Mandai on the Shophouseâs rooftop, and creating a ten-metre-high Art Deco-inspired âgreen wallâ that forms its centrepiece.\n\nâI remember wondering at one point whether we had bitten off more than we could chew,â she laughs. \"But then I realised that we had to walk the talk and integrate our values into every aspect of the Shophouse.\n\nIt began without any fanfare; just a familiar name quietly appearing on social media platforms, first Twitter â now X â then Facebook. Over time, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok âwere also âadded to the list.\n\nâTemasek was no longer a small investment company that could fly under the radar, and social media was not something that could be ignored,â says Stephen Forshaw, then-Head of Public Affairs. âAs the firm grew, more people were paying attention to us, so our communication strategy had to evolve. We decided to tell our story, in our own voice.â\n\nIt was the early 2010s, and few corporations had made the leap into social media. Of those who had, some had made more than a few digital stumbles, leaving a trail of awkward interactions and deleted posts in their wake.\n\nDespite this, Temasek remained convinced of both the potential and necessity to engage on social media. It offered a unique opportunity to speak directly to its audience â to tell them who Temasek was and how it pursued its objectives. When the challenge â dubbed Project Nike â was put to the team, they embraced the spirit embodied by the sportswear giantâs tagline to âJust Do Itâ, Stephen recalls. However, the team didnât simply launch from the starting block. They opted for a thoughtful approach, testing ideas and building on what worked.\n\nâWe focused on doing it well,â says Stephen. âWe knew that once we started, there would be no turning back. We would have to continue populating our social media channels with a steady stream of content, and that content had to be interesting and informative.â\n\nA high point came when its growing base of followers began not just commenting on, but sharing its content. âI remember the first time we got a share. There was a bit of excitement,â Stephen says. âIt marked a shift. Our audience was beginning to respond, and even if they were sometimes provocative, they were engaged. To us, it was meaningful, because it was genuine.â\n\nToday, Temasek has over 250,000 followers on its social platforms.\n\nâOne thing Temasek has always been very good at is recognising âquickly âwhen things are changing,â he says. âThe firm identifies trends and acts on them. Thatâs what we did here.â\n\nFrom âreactive to proactiveâ\n\nStephen, a veteran communicator who had worked for brands like Singapore Airlines and Microsoft, joined Temasek in 2011. It was a time of massive change â the firm was rapidly growing, both in size and portfolio, and its focus had shifted from emerging Asia to the world.\n\nHowever, beyond its role as an investor, little was known about Temasek, and that needed to change, he says.\n\nâWe had to make our narrative clear â who we were, what we did, and why. A lot of our media engagement was transaction-based, but there was so much more we could say about what we stood for as a forward-looking institution, and all we did for the communities we worked with as a trusted steward.â\n\nOver the next few years, he built a digital newsroom within Temasek and grew its social media team, which soon included former journalists, visual storytellers, and marketing and analytics professionals. They shaped how Temasek spoke about itself, and worked closely with teams across the firm, from investment and technology to community stewardship and talent development, to develop content that was worth sharing.\n\nAs Temasek built its social media presence, it also listened intently â engaging with those who commented, and responding when misinformation was spread.\n\nIt was empowering â the firm had a chance to tell stories not just about doing well, but also about how it was doing right and doing good. By the time the 2018 Temasek Review (TR) was launched, it was âsocial firstâ rather than âsocial followsâ, says Stephen.\n\nâWe had videos, photos, infographics, animations, and charts online, all of which helped to bring the Temasek story to life. We achieved more reach than we had ever had. Our audience was taken on a journey that allowed them to not just understand our financial results but the values we embodied and the mission we were driving towards. It was clearly making a difference to what people understood about Temasek.â\n\nTemasek continues to make a concerted effort to take its audience behind the numbers of its annual disclosure exercise, explaining the thinking behind investments, discussing significant trends, and demonstrating the impact of Temasekâs community initiatives.\n\nThe power of connection\n\nBy the time Stephen left the firm and moved to Australia in 2022, public communication had become a critical part of Temasekâs personality and the way it did business.\n\nâThere will never be a shortage of critics, and criticism is something we should listen to and learn from,â he says. âHowever, weâve created a channel that allows us to engage, ensuring that the public has a greater understanding of what Temasek does and can form its own views, and is reassured that even at the most challenging times, it will step up and support the community in ways that are distinctive and genuine.â\n\nThat was apparent in efforts made during crises like the ââ2014 haze and the COVID-19 pandemic, and in its purpose statement, So Every Generation Prospers, which Stephen helped crystallise between 2020 and 2021.\n\nâThese four words embody what Temasek, as a firm, and all its people, stand for. They connect all three pillars of what the firm does into one overriding ambition. Prosperity is about more than just returns. It's about sustainability, community health, living standards, social cohesiveness, and leaving no one behind. It reinforces the notion that social prosperity is on par with financial prosperity. What Temasek does has real meaning, both financially and for communities.â\n\nThis is a story Stephen hopes Temasek will keep telling.\n\nâDemystifying an organisation like Temasek does not happen overnight. It takes constant engagement, strong storytelling and being open about what Temasek does. Itâs a journey â and one I was really happy to be a part of.\n\nMark Lim may be Temasek's Chief Digital Officer, but catch him in a free moment and heâs more likely to be engrossed in a video about behavioural science than fancy algorithms.\n\nâDigital transformation is as much about people as it is about technology,â he says. âHowever sophisticated or innovative a tech tool might be, itâs of no use if people donât use it or if it doesnât solve their problems.â\n\nChampioning user needs has been a driving force for Mark since he co-founded the Government Digital Services (GDS) department of the then-Infocomm Development Authority in 2010. There, he drew on software development strategies more typical of tech giants like Apple and Meta to fundamentally change how people interacted with the government.\n\nHis teamâs progressive approach resulted in the quick and successful deployment of many citizen-facing web and mobile apps, such as the national digital identity app SingPass Mobile, the community first responders app MyResponder, and the first National Library Board app, among others. It attracted Temasekâs attention.\n\nBy 2017, Temasek had grown into a global investment powerhouse and was seeking to unlock more possibilities through digital transformation. GDSâ gregarious Director, who passionately advocated for empathetic and data-driven design, and automation for software testing, seemed the right person to to lead it.\n\nTransformation, scaled\n\nMark moved to Temasek at the start of 2018, with a mandate to empower its teams through the use of the âtriple Aâ â automation, analytics and AI.\n\nThe 2010s had witnessed a massive digital tidal wave sweep the globe, fuelled by the convergence of 4G networks and cloud computing, empowering organisations with the infrastructure they needed to innovate and scale. Meanwhile, the mobile revolution had put user-centric design in the spotlight, paving the way for disruptive AI and Big Data to revolutionise business operations and human interactions. For Temasek, the challenge lay in effectively integrating these advancements into its existing workflow.\n\nMark and his team of three started by conversing with their colleagues across various job functions, to get a comprehensive understanding of the firmâs investment, talent management, and communication needs before considering what needed to be kept, bought, or built.\n\nThey then turned their attention to scaling Temasekâs secure cloud platform to enable innovation, and harnessing the potential of data lakes for analytics, collaboration, and data-driven decision-making. They also began rapidly scaling up digital applications and automation tools that would help free up their colleagues from manual âlegworkâ, allowing them to focus on âbrain workâ instead, explains Mark.\n\nComplex as the task was, his approachability and knack for translating complex ideas into relatable concepts helped get various teams on the same page.\n\nFor instance, he is a strong proponent of what he calls the kueh lapis (layer cake) approach, breaking complex technology builds into smaller layers, testing and making adjustments along the way to ensure the final product is secure and serves its purpose âdeliciouslyâ.\n\nThat was how Winnow, an internal investment platform key to Temasekâs digital infrastructure, was developed â and continues to evolve.\n\nThe âsuper appâ, which borrows its name from the agricultural process where chaff is blown away to yield valuable grain, similarly gleans high-quality internal and external data, insights and intelligence on the investments Temasek is considering, including ESG â or Environmental, Social and Governance â factors. Winnow enables Temasekâs global teams to make faster, better-informed and more meaningful decisions.\n\nâFrom the start, we had daily âscreen reviewsâ â a stand-up meeting with investment teams, identifying the right workflows and solutions, and then building them in. Issues were addressed and features were added along the way.\n\nâThatâs why the adoption rate is so high. Weâve built it together, ground up, and we all own it. It solves problems, adds value, and most importantly, itâs a platform they love to use,â he says. As importantly, the iterative process helped foster trust and break down human-technology silos.\n\nAnd when Temasekâs workforce came to include AI-driven digital âemployeesâ, they all got names. âI wanted people to feel like they were a part of the team. I remind them if they bump into Heidi or Bobby in the pantry, to please be nice and not discriminate against automation,â he laughs.\n\nFostering a culture of transformation\n\nThe first Community Day Huang Zijuan volunteered for, the skies opened up.\n\nâIt was pouring,â recalls Temasekâs Director, Investment (Life Sciences), now a committee member of the staff-led volunteering initiative, T-Touch. Still, the carnival organised in June 2010 at Mindsville@Napiri, a facility for persons with learning disabilities, went off without a hitch. âEveryone just chipped in to do whatever it tookâ¦ we were all quite spent by the end of the day,â she laughs.\n\nCommunity Day, held annually to mark the anniversary of Temasekâs incorporation on June 25, 1974, is one of dozens of T-Touch volunteer programmes Zijuan has been involved in, and one of hundreds driven by Temasek staff around the world â individually, in groups, and company-wide.\n\nâIn every country that Temasek has an office, T-Touch is very much part of who we are,â she says. âWe want to make a difference to the communities we work in.â\n\nâEach one of us plays a small part. When everything comes together and you look at it as a whole, it's pretty impressive.â\n\nNo one left behind\n\nA Temasek scholar, Zijuanâs Involvement in T-Touch began soon after she joined the company in 2006, and deepened through her 18-year career. âI just found myself at a meeting and never left,â she laughs.\n\nAn associate with the financial services team, Zijuan moved to the life sciences team in 2011, and then to the Enterprise Development Group in 2013, where she focused on building businesses in the life sciences space, including healthcare platform Sheares Healthcare. In April this year, she rejoined the life sciences team, covering platform companies including ClavystBio, a life sciences investor and venture builder.\n\nThrough the years, she has witnessed the evolution of T-Touch, first as a volunteer, and now as a member of its eight-person committee which manages queries, finances and project approvals. âAs Temasek has grown, our staff count has increased, so weâre doing more, and on a larger scale,â she says. Some things, however, have stayed the same. âI still see people go out of their way to contribute, regardless of how busy they may be.â\n\nOne of the ways T-Touch organises itself is through âHouse Adopts Homeâ, where staff members are organised into seven house teams, each supporting a different charity home. âIt's our way of engaging charities for the long term, to build deep bonds, and really know their needs,â says Zijuan. Twenty-three years after it was formed in 2001, T-Touch continues to support its very first charity, Singapore Leprosy Relief Association Home (SILRA), now part of Surya Nursing Home.\n\nT-Touch also supports what it calls the Thousand Flowers Projects, where Temasek staff are encouraged to support causes they are passionate about.\n\nâIf a colleague supports a cause and needs funding, we have funding they can tap. If they need publicity to recruit staff volunteers, we can help, and if they need partners, we can connect them. The idea is to catalyse the causes that our staff feel passionate about,â she says.\n\nOften, these are causes that typically fall through the cracks.\n\nZijuan recalls how the first Chairman of T-Touch, Lim Kim Hwee, collaborated with Yellow Ribbon to help ex-offenders find work. Project Naked Chef saw a group of inmates trained to work in the food and beverage industry, where demand for talent was high. âOnce a week, a trainer went into the prison and taught a group of inmates culinary skills. Some eventually graduated with a certificate in basic culinary skills,â she says. Later efforts trained inmates for jobs as divers to clean tanks at the River Safari, and provided bursaries for further studies. One ex-offender is now a practising lawyer.\n\nâWe try to push the envelope to create solutions to problems that we see,â she says.\n\nFor Zijuan, the programmeâs enduring strength is that it is staff-driven, allowing them to champion causes they are truly passionate about, from brainstorming ideas to securing funding. Temasek fosters this spirit, matching staff donations one-for-one, for example, and providing employees with volunteer leave.\n\nâWhen there is a culture where volunteerism is actively encouraged and supported, and there is firm belief in the value of giving back, we can really make a difference.â\n\nThe ripple effect\n\nTo mark Temasekâs 50th anniversary this year, staff volunteers joined forces with Temasek Trust, Temasek Foundation, Temasek Trust Asset Management and several Temasek portfolio companies to make Community Day truly special. Under the theme United for Good, they came together to support âfour beneficiary groups.\n\nâEach year, we put in a lot of effort curating an engaging programme for our beneficiaries. This year being our 50th anniversary, we had different activities across multiple locations. The smiles on the faces of our beneficiaries were a powerful testament to our staffâs dedication to the community,â says Zijuan.\n\nThis dedication is at the very core of T-Touch's philosophy.\n\nBy the time GenZero was officially launched in June 2022 with Frederick Teo at its helm, both the company and its Chief Executive Officer had been honing their climate credentials for several years.\n\nThe decarbonisation-focused investment platform traces its beginnings to 2017, when Temasek established a dedicated sustainability team as a âtest bedâ for sustainability-focused strategies, investments and solutions.\n\nâThe idea was to mainstream these capabilities within Temasek,â recalls Frederick, who moved from his roles in portfolio management and leading business continuity to helm the Sustainability Solutions teamâ.\n\nâThatâs where the Carbon Solutions Platform (CSP), now known as GenZero, began. It was basically being incubated in âstealth modeâ,â he laughs.\n\nWhile Temasek stepped up investments across sectors supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy, CSP aimed to accelerate decarbonisation through strategic investments. This was driven both by the urgency for solutions to the escalating climate crisis, and Temasek's broader commitment to sustainability. With climate solutions still nascent, the platform was envisioned as an independent entity, he says. âTo be truly effective, we believed it needed to have that flexibility and agility.â\n\nFor Frederick, transitioning to GenZero after 12 years on the âmothershipâ was a big step. It was also an opportunity to âbuild something exciting, mission-oriented and intellectually challengingâ.\n\nâUltimately, it is something I believe will have a meaningful and lasting impact.â\n\nSteering towards a carbon-neutral future\n\nFrederick joined Temasekâs portfolio management team in 2010 covering assets in the Telecommunications, Media and Technology sectors. This meant navigating investments in a landscape disrupted by 4G data and the rapid growth of Netflix, WhatsApp and Zoom. He rose to take on a leadership position within the team, while also helming sustainability and community initiatives. This included executing a nationwide delivery of N95 mask kits to kickstart a campaign on emergency preparedness by Temasek Foundation. âââThe idea of building resilience â learning from adversity and emerging stronger â resonated with me,â he says.\n\nWhen the opportunity arose in 2017 to spearhead solutions for clean energy, urban sustainability, and climate and nature as part of the new Sustainability team, he took it. âClimate change, although not well understood at that time, presented a clear challenge requiring urgent action. It threatened our planetâs ecosystem, impacting the lives and livelihoods of millions,â he explains.\n\nAs Managing Director for Sustainable Solutions, Frederick became the driving force behind long-term projects tackling the climate challenges faced by Temasek and its portfolio companies. These included addressing emissions in hard-to-decarbonise sectors like aviation.\n\nA key initiative in partnership with Singapore Airlines (SIA) and the Civil Aviation of Singapore (CAAS), took off at Changi Airport in early 2022. For almost two years, SIA and Scoot flights were fuelled with a blend of conventional and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a biofuel that reduces carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent. The pilot validated SAFâs integration into Changi Airportâs operations, as well as SAF credits as a novel solution to offset the higher costs.\n\nSeparately, he also led efforts to establish a carbon markets ecosystem with the creation of Climate Impact X (CIX), a global carbon credit marketplace. âWe saw carbon credits as a way of channelling finance into innovative climate solutions, and lowering the green premium,â he says. âSo CIX was conceived with DBS Bank, the Singapore Exchange, and Standard Chartered.â\n\nThe birth of GenZero\n\nBy mid-2022, CSP had matured, with CIX among its partners and a portfolio that included investments in advanced biofuels, sustainable agriculture and forest restoration. This paved the way for its official launch as GenZero, with Frederick as its CEO.\n\nThe initial months were hectic, he recalls, and focused on establishing GenZeroâs mission, mandate, and strategy. âWe needed to articulate what we stood for, and why,â he explains. âIf our mission was to accelerate global decarbonisation, then the question was how?â\n\nIt led to the identification of three broad focus areas: nature-based solutions, technology-based solutions, and carbon ecosystem enablers. âAnd then we had to organise ourselves to execute that strategy,â he says.\n\nBeyond a strategic blueprint, he focused on building a strong team. Frederick credits his time at Temasek for shaping his approach to talent. âTemasek is its people,â he says, âand those people share a certain mindset: the courage to innovate, resilience in the face of setbacks, and the tenacity to bounce back and try again.â\n\nâFor those of us privileged to be in a leadership role, itâs about nurturing the next generation to carry this legacy forward. Wherever we go, we bring this piece of DNA with us.â\n\nA journey requiring courage\n\nUnder Frederickâs leadership, GenZero has become a significant force in driving global decarbonisation efforts.\n\nââWe are a fully-fledged investment company with the ability to convene leading climate stakeholders from across the globe. We share best practices and networks to scale impactful solutions, provide deep carbon markets expertise, and curate thought leadership content. This allows us to unlock pain points and accelerate positive climate action.â\n\nLooking ahead, he believes that future success hinges on the same qualities that have propelled GenZero thus far: a willingness to be bold, innovate, and forge new paths.\n\nâIt's like placing stones across a riverbed, paving the way for a crossing. Laying the stones isn't enough. You need the courage to step onto them and complete the journey,â he says. âWe need to be strategic and smart, but we can't afford to be paralysed by uncertainty.â\n\nUltimately, he says, the focus remains on the long game: ensuring GenZeroâs work protects âthe future â ââfor generations.\n\nIt was late 2019 when reports of an uptick in atypical pneumonia cases began to intensify. A doctor by training, it sent âshiversâ down Fidah Alsagoffâs spine.\n\nâMemories of SARS, when hospital workers lost friends and colleagues, were still fresh,â recalls the Vice Chairman of Temasekâs Life Sciences team. âAlarm bells started ringing.â\n\nBy Chinese New Year the following year, the chilling reality of COVID-19 had set in. Temasek began considering the implications of the novel coronavirus from various angles, dusting off contingency plans from its experience of SARS and Bird Flu, and brainstorming ways it could help broader communities â before the virus got the upper hand.\n\nThe investment firm tapped its network of allies in Singapore and around the world for everything from masks and swabs to ventilators and oxygenators, and explored how it could help propel much-needed innovation. Fidah, who would later receive the Public Service Star for spearheading Temasekâs pandemic efforts, led the various work streams, tapping close to two decades of medical training and healthcare management experience.\n\nHe saw the companyâs response to the pandemic as a âfundamental expressionâ of its values. \"Helping people just because you can may not be typical of investment companies, but it is very much part of Temasekâs DNA.\"\n\nA doctorâs pivot\n\nFor Fidah, who studied medicine at the National University of Singapore, it mirrored the epiphany he had in 1989, when he was considering training to become a surgeon. âAll I had ever wanted since I was 11 was to become a doctor, but it was really the underprivileged I wanted to help â and general surgery wasnât going to do much for them,â he says.\n\nIt led him in the direction of public health, and after graduating, he took his knowledge of community medicine first to a charity, serving as its Medical Director, and then to public hospital administration. Seeking a deeper understanding of the business aspects of hospital administration, he decided to pursue an MBA.\n\nImmersed in discussions around value creation, he knew he wanted to improve patient outcomes on a larger scale. At the time, Temasek was growing its interest in the life sciences and was looking to hire for deep domain expertise.\n\nâI got lucky â Temasek took a bet on me,â laughs Fidah, who joined in 2008 to lead and grow the life sciences team globally. He double hatted as joint head of the firmâs Enterprise Development Group, helping to identify areas of growth and drive the commercialisation of innovation.\n\nFrom the start, a major focus of the life sciences team was therapeutics. âBiotech was emerging, and it was both compelling and satisfying when investments in these companies not only delivered solid returns, but ended up helping patients. In early 2020, we invested in a fairly unknown company developing next-generation vaccines, and needed funding for the final phase of testing,â he remembers.\n\nThat company, BioNtech, a pioneer in messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, went on to co-develop one of the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines in the world.\n\nUnending search for solutions\n\nThe effort to stay on top of the pandemic was relentless on all fronts, says Fidah, from testing and diagnosis to protection and prevention.\n\nâAs we watched the situation unfold, we tried to figure out where the next crisis would be. When there was a global shortage of nasopharyngeal swabs, Temasek collaborated with research institutes, hospitals, and small and medium enterprises to design, validate, and manufacture the swabs,â he says. âWithout swabs, diagnostic kits were useless.â\n\nFidah and his team tapped Temasekâs ecosystem for diagnostics equipment, ventilators, and other supplies and support. Portfolio companies including PSA International and Surbana Jurong helped create makeshift medical care facilities and isolation centres preemptively, while Singapore Airlines got supplies to where they were most desperately needed.\n\nâWhat helped were the relationships we had built over the years. You canât make a friend only when you need one,â says Fidah.\n\nClose to two-thirds of Temasekâs staff also stepped up as volunteers, some trading corporate garb for PPE to conduct daily swabs for migrant workers. Others rallied behind other initiatives, including distributing masks and sanitisers across the island, says Fidah. Another team packed and addressed boxes with these COVID essentials to keep Temasekâs global teams safe as they, too, did their part in helping the communities around them.\n\nâWe realised that when you deal with a pervasive invader like Covid 19, the solution is beyond the capacity of any single agency. It demanded collective action.â\n\nUnited by purpose\n\nOver the course of the pandemic, Temasek distributed over 35 million reusable masks and 146 million surgical and N95 masks, 1.3 million oximeters, and over 1.27 million litres of hand sanitiser in Singapore alone. It also provided some 40 countries, including many of Singaporeâs neighbours, with essential medical supplies, including test kits, lab equipment, and personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nFor Fidah, the experience fostered a deep respect for his colleagues, who tirelessly volunteered without lifting a foot off the pedal of their âday jobsâ.\n\nâBusiness had slowed, but we still had to deliver on our core mandate. I remember our former CEO Ho Ching once saying: âWe hold money in trust and have to ensure weâre robust â not just in a single time and place, but for generationsâ.â\n\nIt was an ethic embraced across the company, as Fidah and his colleagues went from investment professionals to COVID-19 warriors and back.\n\nâCOVID-19 was an existential moment for the present generation. There were no arguments, just collective resolve. This is how Temasek will always be â constantly finding ways to remain relevant and fulfil our role as stewards.\n\nâThe desire to see that every generation prospers is not a tagline. It is who we are.â\n\nâTemasek has always prioritised transparency and credibility,â he says. âWhen restrictions tightened, and regulatory scrutiny increased globally in the mid-2010s, we saw a need for dedicated teams that could anticipate and understand the implications of geopolitical risks and policy developments on investment activities.â\n\nIn 2015, Eu Jin transitioned from his legal role to a new Institutional Relations role. âIâve always been drawn to the policy side of M&A,â he admits. âIâm genuinely interested in engaging with foreign governments, understanding their concerns, and advocating for investment opportunities. It felt like a natural extension of my personal interests in politics, history and culture.â\n\nA key challenge of the job, he says, is explaining that while Temasek is owned by the Singapore government, it operates on strictly commercial principles. âMany countries have regulations requiring heightened scrutiny when there's ownership. We need to clarify that what may intuitively seem state-led is really not, in our case.â\n\nâThe challenge is that this is unique to Singaporeâs economic model, and when you're the only unicorn in the forest, people have to trust you before they believe you. So a lot of our work is engagement, presenting ourselves in an open and transparent manner that gives them confidence in us.â\n\nAnother aspect of the job is participating in public consultations on proposed policies, anticipating challenges and offering a perspective.\n\nMuch of the work is about keeping doors open and relationships warm, he says. âThere is no hero charging into the fire. We don't take curtain calls. Simply put, we do our work, and try to do it well.â\n\nA serendipitous fit\n\nSince returning from Brussels at the beginning of 2024, Eu Jinâs focus has shifted to Southeast Asia, fostering relationships in key markets in the region. âSince our strategy is to invest more in the region, the engagement function has to run in parallel with that,â he says. He estimates he currently spends a third of his year on the road.\n\nReflecting on his 17 years in Temasek, he feels immense gratitude. âI often ask myself if it was a coincidence that the very things I found interesting and invigorating just happened to be the same things I found in my work at Temasek.â\n\nâMaybe it was kismet. But I am very grateful for it.â\n\nEmpowering informed investing\n\nâFrom the beginning, clarity was our mantra,â says Hui Min. âWe wanted investors to understand exactly what was being offered.â\n\nAt a formidable 300-plus pages, the Offering Circular was a daunting read. To supplement this, the team created a concise 10-page âOffering Overviewâ that summarised the key points of the offering in clear, simple language, ensuring it would be easy even for a layman to understand. While investors still had to read the full circular, the team wanted to ensure they felt empowered, not intimidated.\n\nAnother priority was to reach as broad an audience as possible.\n\nAdvertising materials, translated into all four national languages, were distributed across platforms, including newspapers, radio, and a range of digital channels. âWe had informational and engaging social media posts, explainer videos to simplify complex topics, and infographics with visual summaries. We also had a GIF that could be shared on WhatsApp,â says Hui Min. She remembers the radio ad becoming a familiar soundtrack on her drives home from work during the week of the offer. âHearing it out there...it was very rewarding.â\n\nSeminars to engage retail investors on the bond issuance were held at Suntec City and the Singapore Exchange Auditorium, catering to various schedules with after-office, lunchtime, and even Saturday morning sessions. Attendees could hear directly from Temasekâs senior management, ask questions, and pick up printed materials, which were also available at the branches of three major banks.\n\nâWe were running something like a logistics distribution centre â we worked with the banks on how many sets of the offering materials they needed delivered, and which branches would get the materials first since there were limited delivery vehicles.â\n\nAmong other things, the advertisements and brochures explained the critical step of setting up a Central Depository Account (CDP), which would âholdâ the bond. The team worked with the Singapore Exchange which went out of its way to ensure that everyone who went to its service centre walked out with a CDP account.\n\nCommunication remained open throughout the application period, where both the Temasek Investor Relations team and call centres at the three local banks fielded questions from the public. âWe aimed to be thorough,â Hui Min says. \"We weren't sure how many people might be new investors, so our approach was to over-communicate and make it as easy as possible to apply.â\n\nThe application window finally opened on October 17, 2018. âIt was very satisfying to see the culmination of all the work we had been doing.â\n\nBuilding for generations\n\nBy the time he joined Temasek in 2012, Ved had spent seven years in advisory and investing, including with Merrill Lynch and Rothschild.\n\nâI was looking for an opportunity where I could be part of a small, agile team building up businesses in India and investing for the long-term.â\n\nAt the time, Temasekâs Mumbai office was transitioning to new leadership. Long-term investments, along with the idea of creating growth platforms, were emerging as key strategic focal points.\n\nâIn sectors we believe capital would be a differentiator, we were willing to take more concentrated bets,â explains Ved. âWe were willing to roll up our sleeves, and be more involved.â\n\nIndiaâs growing healthcare sector was a prime candidate. While demand for quality healthcare was growing, supply was sorely lacking. âWe saw a large role for the private sector,â he says. âWe invested in a few assets, minority stakes initially, and they generated good returns.â\n\nManipal Hospitals was an attractive asset with a strong value system. It was a well-known brand, with a well-respected founder and a legacy of care spanning three generations. In 2017, Sheares Healthcare, a wholly-owned Temasek subsidiary, took an 18% stake in the company. âThe idea was to first understand the business better,â says Ved.\n\nBy then, the Bengalaru-based healthcare provider had grown from a single hospital in Karnataka in 1958 to a network of 15 hospitals across five states. With the 2017 capital injection, Manipalâs network grew to 29 hospitals in 16 cities to become a pan-India healthcare provider, and was poised for even greater expansion.\n\nTo fuel this next stage of growth, the founding-family sought to bring onboard a long-term partner. It was then that Temasek approached them with the idea of acquiring a controlling interest in Manipal Hospitals, and working collaboratively with the family and management team to further build out the business.\n\nManipalâs experience over the previous six years with Sheares Healthcare, combined with its understanding of Temasek as a broader institution, paved the way for the transaction, says Ved.\n\nâThe Manipal brand has been in India for decades, and the family wanted to ensure that they passed the legacy to the right custodian,â he says. âWe were committed to holding the platform for the long term, and working with the family to maintain the brand that they had built up over three generations. Perhaps more importantly, we shared their vision of high-quality, accessible, and affordable healthcare.â\n\nThe desire to see the healthcare brand continue to make a positive impact for generations resonated with Temasekâs own purpose: So Every Generation Prospers.\n\nâIn that, we were completely aligned.â\n\nAs Temasekâs impact spreads further into emerging markets, including India, Indonesia and Africa, the rural roads and landscapes of these countries have become familiar terrain for Eliza. âMeeting the families, you see the difference you make. Itâs a powerful reminder that our work matters.â\n\nA Move to impact\n\nAn investment banker and private equity professional, Eliza moved to Temasek in 2018 to lead its new sustainability investing and financing team.\n\nâIt was a bold move by the leadership,â she says. âTargeting net zero carbon emissions attributable to our portfolio by 2050 was very ambitious. Many wondered how we would achieve this target, but Ho Ching, who was CEO then, and Dilhan Pillay, our current CEO were clear that this was important, and that we had to lead the way.â\n\nâTo me, that is true leadership. Today, sustainability is embedded in everything we do.â\n\nIt was the same bold spirit that led to the creation of a dedicated Impact Investing team in 2020, to focus on investments that generate measurable social and environmental impact alongside financial returns. Eliza views this as an extension of Temasek's sustainability pillar, which integrates environmental, social and governance factors into investment decisions. âIf you want true sustainability, then building community resilience must be part of it,â she argues. A passion for impact investing saw her jump at the opportunity to be part of the then three-person team tasked with getting the initiative off the ground.\n\nâFor the first year, I was still in my sustainability investing role and was double-hatting. We just worked on this whenever we could,â she recalls. As COVID-19 spread across the globe, and much-needed capital left emerging markets, it became clear where the team needed to focus its efforts. âWe wanted to support the underserved in emerging markets. This included investing in leading impact funds and companies, while simultaneously building our own capabilities and leadership in the space.â\n\nThere were significant challenges, from gaps in impact data and benchmarks and the lack of impact capabilities to scepticism â was it actually possible to achieve financial returns\n\nTemasekâs extensive network played a crucial role. âIt opened doors for collaboration,â Eliza says. âWe connected with the leading players in the impact space â we probably met around 200 impact funds â to benchmark best practices.â\n\nThe team gained insights into the companies that impact funds invested in, how they differentiated themselves, measured their impact, and achieved their outcomes. âThere was a lot of learning from speaking to others and looking at what they were doing,â she says.\n\nBy investing in strategic partners like LeapFrog Investments and ABC Impact, and through direct and co-investments, like SarvaGram, Temasekâs Impact Investing team is driving positive impact in emerging markets.\n\nâSome investors may see these spaces as risky,â Eliza says, âbut weâre familiar with these geographies. It allows us to identify strong partners, opportunities and business models, and puts us in a unique position to catalyse positive change,â she says.\n\nThe team also looks to catalyse the impact investing ecosystem through thought leadership and capability-building initiatives.\n\nAs focused as she was on the impact she was having thousands of miles away, Eliza was taken by surprise by the impact she was having closer to home.\n\nâMy daughterâs teacher asked her class what they wanted to be when they grew up â and she said she wanted to be an impact investor,â she laughs. âIâm not sure she knows exactly what I do, but she knows it makes a difference, and that inspires her.â\n\nLooking back at his first few weeks on the job, the former Senior Warrant Officer with the Singapore Armed Forces recalls how âstrangeâ it felt. âI was a military guy in the corporate world. But I just tried to chit-chat with everyone so I would be approachable when things went wrong.â\n\nAmar joined Temasek as it was restructuring its Business Continuity Management teams. Workplace safety and security were consolidated into a dedicated unit that would shield Temasekâs teams and operations from disruptions.\n\nBeyond daily tasks and supporting internal and external events, the team of three ensured contingency plans, like those created in the wake of the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic remained up to date. When transboundary haze choked the region in 2013 and again in 2015, they had N95 masks stockpiled and ready.\n\nâBusiness continuity is like oxygen. You can't see it, taste it, smell it or feel it, but it's vital for survival,â he says.\n\nThe team also handled travel risks and logistics, and ensured that Temasek offices around the world maintained the same safety and security standards as its Singapore HQ. âDifferent countries have different protocols, cultures and regulations. We had to calibrate our plans to fit each environment so they could be deployed whenever the button was pushed,â explains Amar.\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit, that button got quite a workout, and every protocol was put to the test, he recalls.\n\nâWe had checklists and recovery plans that Temasek had created with consultants that kicked into action.â\n\nWhen everyone eventually returned to the office, Amarâs sturdy presence remained a familiar fixture, as he strode through corridors and meeting rooms with practised efficiency, his trained eye seeking out potential concerns or hazards, and ensuring spaces remained secure.\n\nSometimes, Amar found himself handling things that werenât quite his day job, including redirecting unexpected visitors who showed up at Temasekâs front door with their PR applications.\n\nâItâs really all about finding solutions,â he says. âWhatever happens, you figured it out. How can you make big things small, and small things disappear? The key is never to let small problems turn into big fires.â\n\nWhere people come first\n\nAs he settles into âreal retirementâ, Amar says Temasekâs response to COVID-19 â a crisis that tested every country, company, and individual â is what will always remain with him. He goes back time and again to the âStaff Care Packsâ he was charged with packing, and how they evolved as the pandemic lingered.\n\nAn investment in potential\n\nThe decision to join Temasek â and then to assume the role of its fourth Chairman a year later â were not decisions Lim had taken lightly. When the naval architect was offered the opportunity to make the move from Neptune Orient Lines to join politics in the early 1980s, he had spent about a day thinking about it. He mulled this move to Temasek for over a month.\n\nâI knew little about investing at that time,â he laughs, âbut Temasek had enough good people who did. What I did know about was how to operate a company, and I understood people. My time with NTUC and in politics helped me understand their hopes, aspirations and fears â and focus on how their lives could be made better.\n\nâAt Temasek, that purpose continued.â\n\nHe recalls one of the earliest conversations he had with former CEO Ho Ching about TTC, when she drew on Temasekâs experience with helping to restructure Singaporeâs power generation companies at the turn of the decade. The various parties had to work through manpower priorities that sometimes pulled in different directions, and embrace the need for change. She was convinced that Temasek could play the role of âfacilitatorâ in other contexts.\n\nIn 2017, the TTC was launched as a closed-door âmakan sessionâ. Since then, it has struck up critical and varied conversations over dinner, durians, and drinks, on topics ranging from the impact of technological disruption to emerging âgreen jobsâ created by climate action. As he kicked off the conversations each year, Lim rallied union representatives, corporate leaders and policymakers to candidly exchange insights and explore perspectives â and they did.\n\nThe relationships formed proved invaluable as parties in embattled sectors like air transport came together to preserve jobs, cut costs, and reskill and upskill workers when COVID-19 sent shockwaves through the economy in 2020.\n\nâRelationships have to be built all the time, not only when you have a crisis or when you have to make a transformative change,â says Lim. âWhen you are having an ongoing conversation, facilitating change becomes much easier.\n\nTTC provides a platform for these conversations to take place.\n\nâWhen you look at the news and whatâs going on around the world, a lot of labour conflicts arise because of a lack of communication, and it really is not necessary to repeat those mistakes...You can go further when there is already trust between the various parties.â\n\nIn a third-floor office overlooking Parisâ famed Avenue de lâOpera, RaphaÃ«l Boulanger walked briskly through the meeting rooms, testing all systems, from microphones to WiFi reception.\n\nFor more than a year, the Assistant Vice President with Temasekâs Investment Group (EMEA) had been part of a team of three tussling with budgets, locations, contracts and renovations to ready the 650 sqm, two-storey space for its 2023 opening. On that late June afternoon, he was conducting the final checks.\n\nThe Paris office, Temasekâs third in Europe and 13th in the world, is part of the firmâs strategy to strengthen its global network and increase the resilience of its portfolio. Working with its London and Brussels offices, Paris will enhance Temasekâs ability to seize opportunities across the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.\n\nâWeâll basically be one team in three offices, which means that any team member can travel to any one of our offices to be closer to whatever they happen to be working on, whether potential investment targets or sourcing talent. It's completely agnostic,â says RaphaÃ«l.\n\nFor the 30-year-old Paris native, back home after six years in London, bringing Temasek into his home country has been âincredibleâ. âI didn't realise how much work it would be, but itâs something I am very proud of.â\n\nThe French connection\n\nWhen RaphaÃ«l first joined Temasek as an intern in 2016, the London office â the firmâs first in Europe â had been up for just a year and a half.\n\nâThe first day I came in was the day the British voted for Brexit. Everyone was shocked, and I tried to settle in my corner and read my staff book â because thatâs what you do as a first-day intern,â he laughs.\n\nDespite ripples resulting from the vote, Temasek was in growth mode. âIt was diversifying its portfolio into Europe and other Western markets, so there was a high level of capital deployment by the team. It was a pretty exciting period to be there,â he recalls.\n\nThe region presented opportunities that would allow Temasek to leverage emerging trends, he points out. âEurope has been at the forefront of the energy transition for a number of decades, for instance, and is a key area for innovation and development of energy transition solutions. Itâs also one of the regions where a lot of fundamental research is taking place.â\n\nA year later, when RaphaÃ«l returned with Masterâs degrees in Engineering and Business to formally begin his career as an investment associate for the European team, the office was expanding. âThere were more hires, including at mid-level and senior level. Not long after my return, Nicolas Meier came in as a director, covering the German region, which we didn't have before. Soon after that, Uwe Krueger joined as head of Europe,â he recalls.\n\nBetween then and 2023, the London office would double in strength to 50 people.\n\nCatalysing innovation\n\nSitting behind her desk today, the opportunity to have an impact remains, she says.\n\nTemasekâs COVID-19 response was not created in a day. It was founded on years of investment in life sciences and promising innovations, and relationships and capacities that came together to deliver the supplies and support that Singapore, and many other countries in the region, needed. âFor example, Temasek has been invested in Thermo Fisher Scientific since 2014, and when there was a severe lack of lab equipment, they helped supply the equipment directly to Singapore labs,â she recalls. âThatâs just one example. It comes down to taking a long-term view on investments, building strong relationships, and keeping future potential impacts in mind. For life sciences, you see the outcome much more clearly, because you are essentially impacting generations â yours, and the ones after.â\n\nHer first months in her ânormal jobâ, were spent deepening her financial knowledge and becoming more familiar with Temasekâs investments across the different life sciences subsectors, from vaccines and medical services, to diagnostics and related tools. As a doctor, Cheryl had been on the receiving end of innovations filtering down from companies to the public healthcare system. âWitnessing the role that Temasek played in forming the connection between the innovators and the surgeon holding that scalpel really opened my eyes.â\n\nWhen evaluating potential investments, Cheryl brings the perspective of a doctor to the table. With lives at stake, the medicine and healthcare industries tend to stick to tried-and-tested solutions, unless there is a real need for change, she says. âThe mentality is always, if it ainât broke, why fix it? So, the question is always, are you creating a test that fills a need?\n\nâThat's where I come in â to ask the right questions and make sure that we're investing in things doctors will use and that patients need.â\n\nBeyond her âofficial roleâ, Cheryl has become the unofficial âgo-to medical advisorâ as well. âIf there are any mishaps or accidents at work, I'm the first aid person,â she laughs.\n\nFor all the hype that surrounds it, medical innovation is more a slow burn than flashy breakthroughs, says Michelle Evaristo.\n\nâItâs a series of small increments that lead to milestones,â explains the Chief Operating Officer of Temasek-owned life sciences investor and venture builder, ClavystBio. âWhat we do is provide founders and entrepreneurs with the necessary resources to bring their products, whether new medicines, therapies, or treatments, to market.\n\nâAnd because we work so closely with them, we live and breathe their successes and setbacks.â\n\nSeconded from Temasek in 2022, Michelleâs work on ClavystBio began much earlier. As a director of Temasekâs Enterprise Development Group (EDG), she led a cross-functional team that identified a gap â and commercial opportunity â to accelerate the commercialisation of breakthrough healthcare innovations in Singapore.\n\nIt is a long process that many investors shy away from, she says. âIt takes time to move a product from concept to market, and conviction to ride the ups and downs. But you donât lose sight of what youâre trying to do, and you keep your eye on the long game.â\n\nItâs what Temasek means when it talks about generational investing, she says.\n\nâMy proudest moments are when my children ask me what I do. I tell them that I'm helping to bring new cures closer so they can live happier, healthier and fuller lives.â\n\nThe ecosystem advantage\n\nA former Credit Suisse investment banker, Michelle joined Temasek in 2010, first in an investment role, then in the Investment Group Office, âpart of the backbone that people donât necessarily see when youâre talking about an investment company.â She spent five years working on strategy, portfolio analysis and construction, and policies and procedures, before moving to EDG in 2018, keen to apply the investment and operational skill sets that she had acquired in her previous roles.\n\nâEDG is Temasekâs âbuilding engineâ, and when youâre looking at building a platform from scratch, youâre looking for certain system gaps,â she says. âWe saw that the universities in Singapore had a rich base of translatable ideas, but that these were slow to progress into commercial opportunities.â\n\nThe question for Michelle and her team was if this could be accelerated, and if there was a commercial opportunity here for Temasek.\n\nâThe answer was a definitive yes,â says Michelle, who led the team and seized the opportunity to help set up and operate ClavystBio. âI wanted to see the idea come to fruition, and have a hand in building it as a business.â\n\nHer resolve was strengthened when COVID-19 hit in 2020. Pregnant with her third child in the midst of one of the worst pandemics, Michelle found herself more hopeful than fearful. âGlobal trade had been cut off, and Singapore had to turn to innovation, from test kits to mobile laboratories,â she recalls. âTemasekâs concerted efforts to bring much needed innovations to market demonstrated how quickly we could change the trajectory of health.â\n\nEven as the pandemic persisted, work on ClavystBio continued. âWe really started from the ground up â building up the systems, processes, people and key capabilities within the team,â recalls Michelle.\n\nâEvery few years, I saw a different part of the investing landscape, which I truly appreciated. Now, I wanted to dive deeper and understand how operations were actually run,â she says. âAs investors, we can tell a company they should hire more people, but what does it take to hire more people or manage attrition in reality? If we are going to help ventures succeed, we need to understand how they work.â\n\nFittingly, she walked straight into a talent quandary at Temus.\n\nSet up by Temasek in partnership with global digital services firm UST in 2021, the startup helps companies take their digitisation plans from concept to reality, accelerating digital transformation in the Temasek ecosystem as well as the broader marketplace. Part of this includes building the talent pipeline to support those ambitions.\n\nAlongside her role of growing the year-old startup through mergers and acquisitions, Delaine was tasked with getting a talent conversion programme off the ground.\n\nâWe needed more people, but the technology market was tight,â she recalls. âRather than compete for computer science graduates, we decided to create an alternative talent acquisition channel.â Training people who had no background in technology but wanted to transition into entry-level roles in specific technical specialisations was doable â after all, Temusâ partner UST had been doing it globally for 10 years.\n\nThe curriculum is tightly focused on in-demand skills, like software development, training them for specific roles, âand then they plug and playâ, explains Delaine.\n\nThe pool of potential talent turned out to be vast. The first two runs on basic coding attracted 1,700 people for 40 available slots. The third, to fill 20 Digital Business Analyst positions, drew over 1,200 applications.\n\nA âblindâ online qualifying test serveâdâ as a meritocratic gatekeeper, screening for abilities such as analytical skills, mathematics, and comprehension. Anyone who passed, regardless of professional or educational background, qualified for an interview.\n\nâIt did not matter where the participants came from. We wanted to enable people with the right attitude and aptitude to transition into technology. That was the mission of Step IT Up,â Delaine explains.\n\nAmong Temusâ âTransformersâ who have earned their place in the digital marketplace are a former âoptometrist who now creates insurtech products, an ex-journalist who develops applications, and a stay-at-home mum who will soon call herself a digital business analyst.\n\nâThese are people from diverse backgrounds, educational levels, occupations, and generations, all trying to get into the technology space,â she says. âI remember one trainee who was very passionate about technology but was worried because he didnât have a degree. He worked incredibly hard, coming in early and staying late, and turned out to be one of our top performers. The day he graduated, he gave me a big hug.â\n\nâIt is one of the most meaningful things I have done, catalysing a change in someoneâs life.â\n\nIgniting a Passion for Lifelong Learning\n\nFive years into her role in Learning & Talent Development, Christine Ng realised that Temasekâs rapid growth and increasingly diverse workforce presented a unique training challenge.\n\nBy 2016, the firm had grown to more than 600 employees in eight countries, says the 46-year-old, then an Associate Director for Organisation & People. The department was juggling the training needs of people across âdifferent time zones, different levels, and different specialisationsâ.\n\nâWe needed something that was flexible, and yet allow us to achieve our training goals,â says Christine. âLearning at Temasek is not simply about updating functional or leadership competencies. What we want to do is create a mindset geared towards continuous learning, which then creates a ripple effect that benefits not just the company, but future generations of employees, and the communities we engage with.â\n\nShe believed that developing a strong learning strategy and curriculum in-house, then working with vendors to deliver it, could be the answer.\n\nâBeing on the inside, we could appreciate the cultural and intergenerational differences,â she says. âOn an individual level, we were well-placed to look beyond skills to motivation and what gave an individual purpose. This ensured the learning programmes we delivered would be relevant and responsive to our diverse workforce.â\n\nEmpowered to learn\n\nShe made her case â and got the go-ahead.\n\nâNot a lot of places will give you the space to explore new approaches. Temasek does,â she says. âWhen it believes something could benefit the company, and if itâs practical and executable, theyâll let you try. They give you that space, and itâs something I really value.â\n\nOver the next few months, she recruited a team of learning professionals, and began work on redesigning its approach to learning.\n\nThis included options for self-paced online learning and both in-person and virtual courses. âThat really helped when the pandemic hit in 2020, since people could continue learning virtually, despite closed offices and closed borders,â she recalls. âWe also created programmes for mental wellness, which was a global problem during the lockdowns.â\n\nIt comes back to flexibility, she says. âWe constantly rethink our programmes and how we deliver them. Some of the things we do today may not be as relevant or exciting for future generations, for instance, so we need to be able to evolve with changing needs.â\n\nUnleashing true potential\n\nThat fateful audition encapsulated the spirit that underpinned Temasek 20/20: harnessing the value of mentors in getting ideas off the ground.\n\nAt the time, the popularity of video had exploded on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, as well as Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube. Beyond leveraging the medium for its own storytelling, Temasek was exploring how it could help the next generation of filmmakers ride that wave â and tapping the value of mentors to propel success had long been a cornerstone of its approach.\n\nThe resulting collaboration with mm2 entertainment â which was behind success stories like the comedy film series âAh Boys to Menâ â would see seasoned filmmakers like Li Lin, Eric Khoo and Cannes regular Boo Jun Feng come on board to mentor 20 young filmmakers, and help turn their ideas into stories worth telling.\n\nThe prospect of these mentorships was precisely what attracted Leroy, then a second-year student at LASALLE College of the Arts, and his team, which included schoolmates Nikko Koh and Dhinesh Ravichandran. It was a rare opportunity, he says.\n\nâThe mentorship was really what made 20/20 what it was. What you learn working with filmmakers who have the know-how and experience, you canât learn that in school. And the fact that Temasek was willing to step forward and say, hey, you are a student, but we're going to provide you with the funds to tell a story that will hopefully move people, that was incredible. It felt like a vote of confidence.â\n\nFor close to a year, Li Lin guided Leroyâs team as they rehauled the script. Then, they tackled the nuances of casting, budget management, filming, and post-production.\n\nâFrom pre-production to production and post-production, she was with us, pointing things out, questioning decisions and providing alternatives. She kept pushing the envelope further,â recalls Leroy. âLi Lin could spot the âpre-mistakesâ before they could cause any real damage.â\n\nWith every refinement, their idea moved closer to the story he wanted to tell.\n\nHe says there was never any âpressure not to failâ.\n\nâWe just had to do the best that we could. That's very powerful for young filmmakers, who are sometimes afraid to try because they are afraid to fail. We wanted to make something great and now we had the resources to do it.â\n\nWhen Benedict Cheong first proposed that philanthropy might benefit from having âperformance indicatorsâ, he caused a stir, including among some prominent social workers.\n\nâIt was the early 2000s, and chequebook philanthropy was still predominant in Asia â if it looked good and you liked it, you gave them the money,â recalls Benedict, then CEO of the National Council of Social Services. âThey could not reconcile doing good with measurable outcomes â or see how it could ensure their good intentions were actually realised.â\n\nAcross town at The Atrium@Orchard, where the seeds for a new philanthropic foundation were being sown, his ideas were getting a different reception. Since 2003, Temasek had been seeding social capital to advance social resilience, progress and cohesion in Singapore and across the region. But it was still working on trying to find the right structure.\n\nBy 2007, it was ready to launch Temasek Trust as its philanthropic arm, with Temasek Foundation (TF) as a beneficiary and Benedict at its helm.\n\nâFor Temasekâs leaders, outcome-based, impact-focused philanthropy was a key element, and thatâs what I brought to the table,â says Benedict. âBeyond that, it was a steep learning curve.â\n\nHaving come from an established entity, starting from scratch with no blueprint to follow was a daunting challenge for TFâs first CEO, who would also be working regionally for the first time.\n\nVenturing into uncharted territory\n\nHe remembers the first couple of months as extremely hectic.\n\nâThe first thing I did was get my budget approved so I could recruit and buy things like computers. I joined on 23 April, and TF would be officially launched on 16 May â that meant, I had three weeks,â he says.\n\nArmed with a budget and a mandate to uplift lives, promote goodwill and good governance, and support disaster relief in the region, he and his team hunkered down and got to work.\n\nThey identified areas of need, focusing on âlow hanging fruitâ like education and healthcare, where the requirements and expected outcomes were clearly defined, and began drafting an overarching strategy.\n\nâThe foundation is independent, but we carry the Temasek name, and thatâs Temasekâs way,â he says. âYou are strong on principles and on what is core, but you are also nimble in seeking out opportunities. Nobody is going to tell you âyesâ or ânoâ. You figure it out. There's a lot of trial â and hopefully more success than error.â\n\nâThere were just six of us, and everyone attended all the meetings. Junior members like me could listen in when our bosses talked about strategies and partner dynamics, and we learnt from the best.â As Temasek became an active investor, first regionally and then globally, the team was responsible for introducing Temasek to the outside world. âWe had to go out there to these global funds and explain who we were, what we did, and the connections we could help them make,â she says. âIf people didn't know anything about you, why would they do business with you? How could they trust you?â\n\nOver time, the companyâs external narrative matured, taking shape in the first Temasek Review â a public report of its portfolio performance â published in 2004. The same year, Temasek earned triple-A credit ratings from S&P and Moodyâs for the quality of its portfolio.\n\nâTo me, that made it real,â says Ming Pey. âIâd spent years explaining our commercial operations and telling funds and companies why they would want us as an investor. Now there were these public markers recognising Temasekâs commitment to transparency and accountability, and reporting on the portfolio and performance we had achieved.â\n\nThe years that followed were hectic as the pace of investment picked up, she remembers. By 2005, there were various sector-focused investment teams within Temasek, and the company had offices in Mumbai, Beijing and Shanghai. By this time, Ming Pey had joined the Direct Investment team, covering sectors such as Technology and Financial Services. âWe were growing the portfolio and doing deals very quickly. I remember it coincided with the launch of the BlackBerry device â suddenly, everyone could work anytime, anywhere, and many of us â and our bosses â were online almost 24/7,â she says.\n\nWriting the next chapter\n\nAs the company grew and more investment staff came on board, Temasekâs âDNAâ evolved. âWe used to operate in a small, cosy and family-like environment where everyone knew and took care of one another. But over time, the environment became more professional, and the focus shifted to achieving performance and delivering results.â\n\nIt was a shift that Ming Pey noted and voiced out to the then-head of HR Sebastian Tan.\n\nâI asked him what kind of organisation we wanted to build â did we want to maintain a caring and nurturing environment, or push for a high performance and returns-oriented culture,â she recalls. âHe asked me why the two could not co-exist, and then put down a challenge: if I felt so strongly about it, then I should do something to make it so. I took that as a personal challenge.â When she returned from maternity leave in 2007, Ming Pey joined the Organisation & People team to work on Organisational Development, including projects and initiatives that would ensure Temasek retained its strong sense of purpose and heritage, even as it continued to grow its portfolio and talent pool.\n\nâThis was where I could leverage my familiarity with how Temasek had evolved,â she says. âBy integrating these stories into our internal communications and staff engagement exercises, we could help people understand our purpose and our way of life.â\n\nThings crystallised in 2019 when she became a part of the working team for T2030, a 10-year roadmap for the firm that would guide the building of a resilient and forward looking portfolio in an increasingly complex world. âBut before we could find a way forward, we had to first look back,â she says. One of her first tasks was to compile a âreport cardâ for what the firm had achieved in the decade to 2020.\n\nIn the process, she was able to âconnect the dotsâ, and see how the various business and institutional initiatives undertaken by the firm had come together to create the global investment powerhouse that Temasek had become.\n\nThe work Temasek does often takes years to play out, she says. âI tell those stories to my juniors so they understand how their decisions today will impact the company in the future. To me, that generational thinking is very important â to know that what I do today, somebody else is going to inherit.\n\n\"My hope is that a young employee in the future will look back at all the things we are doing today, and think to themselves, âSo this is what they were trying to achieve for usâ. I hope they value how it all came together, and go on to shape the Temasek that future generations will build on.\"\n\nMost days, Lim Ah Lee can be found by the window of Ward 2A, glued to the news on his Lexon radio. Other days, the longtime Surya Nursing Home resident hums along with the Mandarin classics playing on his constant companion and âbest friendâ.\n\nTo most, the radio has seen better days. But to the still-sharp 88-year-old, the small brown box connects him to the world.\n\nâDid you know the temple on Kusu Island is now 100 years old?â he asks. âI heard it on my radio.â\n\nâUncleâ Ah Lee tells anyone who will listen how he won the radio in a bingo game organised by Temasek some two decades ago.\n\nâââAt the time, the former leprosy sufferer was a charge of the Singapore Leprosy Relief Association (SILRA), the very first home adopted by Temasek under its T-Touch initiative in early 2002. The firm had decided then that giving should be a cornerstone of its culture, and through T-Touch, it could support staff-led volunteer initiatives and encourage volunteerism.\n\nIn those days, SILRA had about 90 residents. Like Uncle Ah Lee, many had spent decades living in the home. The stigma associated with leprosy meant visitors and volunteers were hard to come by, despite the fact that a cure for the disease had been available in Singapore since the 1950s. Many bore physical scars of the disease, but loneliness often felt like the worst one.\n\nThat was precisely why, when put to a company-wide vote, Temasek chose SILRA â it was where they were most needed. Their visits became a high point, providing the companionship and acceptance the residents craved.\n\nWhen SILRA was absorbed by Sunlove Home in 2018 and the building renamed Surya Nursing Home, the tradition continued: no festival goes by forgotten, and familiar faces regularly come by bearing ang pows, mooncakes and other treats, and stay to chat. âWe are always happy to see themâ¦ Every time Temasek comes, they bring a nice buffet. There was a pasar malam one time, and there is always bingo,â says Uncle Ah Lee.\n\nHe remembers the exact game in which the radio came to be his. It hadnât been going terribly well. âI think the volunteer covering the numbers for me kelong (rigged it), but I won the last radio,â he laughs.\n\nA search for white spaces\n\nPart of the groupâs mandate was to identify and invest in innovative technologies with the potential to drive the planet closer towards climate resilience, and Temasek towards a net-zero portfolio.\n\nâGiven the scale of the sustainability crisis, we didnât know where to start,â Immanuâel recalls.\n\nThe team cast its net wide, exploring everything from sustainable aviation fuels to nuclear fusion, attempting to uncover white spaces that could be explored, whether now or in the future.\n\nHe remembers then-CEO Ho Ching addressing him during one of their meetings. âI was the youngest one in the team then, and she said that we needed more young people in our team because it was going to be up to my generation â and the ones that came after us â to take the possibilities of nuclear energy forward.\n\nâI realised then that this was going to be a multi-decade-commitment, with an enormous potential for being a force for good.â\n\nThe teamâs first task was to put in place a robust framework that could guide both investment and strategic decisions. âThis levelled everyone up so we could drive the changes the world needed to see in a dedicated and measured way,â he says.\n\nImmanuâel himself trained his focus on decarbonisation, and within that, low carbon hydrogen, a topic close to his heart. He animatedly explains how low carbon hydrogen is a critical part of Singaporeâs future energy mix, given its limited access to renewable energy.\n\nâWe searched for under-addressed challenges and for potential solutions and policies that the firm could consider in its choice of investments. We had to think about why no one had solved them, and if they had tried and failed, then where the pitfalls lay.\n\nâWe went from problem to solution, then reverse-engineered our way back to better defining the problem. It was an iterative process.â\n\nImpact, for generations\n\nAs the headlines around sustainability evolved over the years, so did the mandate of the Sustainability Group. It now comprises three sub-groups overseeing Sustainability & Climate Change Strategy, Ecosperity, a platform for engagement and advocacy, and Sustainable Solutions, which Immanuâel heads.\n\nHis focus is on solutions that could have a direct impact on Temasek and its portfolio companies. Immanuâel also doubles up as a Director of Emerging Technologies, which looks further into the future, at nascent deep-tech ideas that, with the right support â including from companies like Temasek â could evolve into commercially viable technologies with the potential to make a big difference.\n\nâThe challenge is that these technologies are almost always very new. Some of them may not exist at any sort of scale yet, and of those that do exist, some may not succeed. You have to scientifically and systematically predict if itâs going to work, how that might impact our businesses, and if that impact will be long term.\n\nâThat said, Temasek is in the business of looking around the bend, so you never get bored,â he says.\n\nIt is quite a change from what he envisioned himself doing, Immanuâel admits. In finance, âcurrencyâ is viewed solely in terms of returns, risks and time dimensions. Today, his focus is on how money translates into value, not just in the immediate future, but for future generations.\n\nâThe idea of being in a company that is only interested in profit now feels empty. The pre-Temasek Immanuâel might have been okay with that, but not anymore,â he says. âIâve seen how Temasek puts time, money, commitment and people into bringing real value to communities, now and in the future.\n\nâIâve been infused with its DNA â and now Iâm hooked.â"
