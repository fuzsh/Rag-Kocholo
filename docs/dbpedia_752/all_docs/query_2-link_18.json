Wheh the Gazetteer of the Rohilkhand districts was published by Messrs. E, T. Atkinson and H. C. Conybeare in 1879, the district of Pilibhit did not exist as a separate charge, and the area then formed part of Bareilly. This fact necessitated the compilation of a new volume, for which some material was available in the old Settlement Reports and the Bareilly Gazetteer and also m the report of the recent revision of assess- ment in the Bisalpur tahsil by Mr. J. C. Fergusson. I had further the advantage of notes prepared by Pandit Bhawani Datt, Deputy Collector, and much other information supplied by Mr. G. Whittle, who has rendered me additional assistance by reading the proofs. Allahabad ; \"> C H. R. N. December 1907. J GAZETTEER OF FXLIBHIT, REFERENCES.

General Features, Pilibhit is the smallest and the most recently formed of the six districts that constitute the Bareilly division, geneially known as Rohilkhand, It occupies the noifch-eastem poition of the area and is a tract of very irregular shape, its limits being defined in most cases by a purely conventional bound aiy. The district lies between the parallels of 28° G' and 28° 53' noith latitude and those of 79° 37' and 80° 27' east longitude. It extends eastwards from the borders of the JBaieilly district to the confines of Klheii on the east and the temtory of Ilepal on the north-east on the north lie the Tarai paiganas of Kami Tal, while to the south is the district of Shahjahanpur. The total area according to the latest returns is 864,504 acres, or 1,350 8 square miles. In its general appearance the district presents many diver- sities of feature, and topographically may be divided into seveial distinct tracts. In the north and north-west the country is a mere continuation of the Tax an; and this giadually gives place to the common characteristics of Rohilkhand, the southern poi- tion, comprised in the Bisalpur tahsil, being similar m most respects to the adjacent tracts of Bareilly and Shahjahanpur. The eastern and smaller section approximates lather to the undeveloped forest areas of Khen and the noith of Oudh, though with the spread of cultivation the dissimilarity between Puran- pur and the rest of the district is gradually becoming less mailed. Taken as a whole the district is a gentle undulating plain, intersected by numerous streams which flow mainly in a southerly direction, following the slope of the country. Though there are no hills, the level surface is varied by many troughs and depressions, marking the bods of the rivers and watercourses which carry off the surface d c These ow basins known by tire genena name of hhafor differ creotly m character frOju 2 Pihbhit Distnci the upland stretches or hangar, through which run the watersheds. Apart from these inequalities, the slope of the country from north to south is remarkably uniform, the surface of the uplands being varied only by slight undulations, m most places scarcely perceptible, though towards the south they occasionally rise in n ell- defined ridges and low sand-hills. In addition to the natural division into khcidir ami hangar, there is a conventional dis- tinction between the mar and the cfef, the latter denoting the open country of the plains, while the former is applied to the uub-Himalayan forest tract, of which only a minute portion is now included in. the north of the district. The line of the mar has gradually receded with the spread of population and tillage, and save in a few places the forest belt has been driven back far into the Tarai and Bhabar ; but the old name still remains, and by common usage extends to all the country in the Pilibhit tahsil noi'th of a line from Amana to Neoria Husainpur. For topographical purposes, however, it is quite useless, ancl its retention is merely of historical interest. Properly speaking, the existing forests in the district should be termed mar , since they are actually a continuation of those still standing in pargana Bilheri to the north; but in practice this is not the case. The height in the extreme north of pargana Jahanabad is 661 feet above the level of the sea, and this falls gently to 607 feet at Pilibhit, the intermediate heights being 631 feet at Amaria and 638 feet at Neoria Husampur, South of the district headquarteis the level drops to 5S8 feet at Pauta Kalan, 573 feet at Barkhora, 550 feet at Bisalpur and 530 feet on the Shahjahanpur border. In the Puranpur tahsil we find an almost identical declension in. parallel latitudes, the height falling from G38 feet above the sea at Chuka to 625 at Mustafabad, 610 at Mad ho Tanda, 590 at Puranpur and 570 at the point where the road from the last-men- tioned place to Shahjahanpur passes beyond the limits of this district. The relative height of the hangar above the kkadir varies from place to place, ordinarily ranging fiom 10 to 25 foot, though along the west bank of the Khanaut the difference is con- siderably greater and a steep cliff is formed, almost presenting the appearance in certain parte of a very low range of hil e A tteef* bfcolt, fatewa l*eaity at the ©hamka Dhafea. marks General Features S the western edge of the Sard a valley. In the latter tract the level is everywhere low, the recorded heights along the course of the river being 582 feet at a point due east from Chuka, 550 feet to the east of Madho Tanda and only 531 feet on the Kheri boundary near the Dighia ferry. This lowlymg belt on the north-eastern extremity of the dis- trict has a character peculiarly its own. It possesses a moist alluvial soil, producing large quantities of tall giasa and tamarisk ; the climate is exceedingly unhealthy, the population very sparse and the cultivation, carried on mainly by non-resident tenants, is but scanty, rice being the sole product of importance. The tract is cut off from the rest of the district by a belt of forest, which extends all along the Chauka and also occupies the northern and western portions of Puranpur. The area thus enclosed is an open plain with a light and indifferent soil, draiued somewhat imperfectly by numerous streams that rise in the moist country on the inner edge of the forest zone, and in a very backward state of development, with a scanty and shifting population. The southern extremities of the district are better m in every way, the soil being richer, cultivation more stable and the population more dense. In the centre and north the soil becomes increasingly sandy, as is shown by the comparative absence of trees, the village sites are few and far between, and the proximity of the forest competes with the climate to render tillage precarious. The western belt of forest extends into the Pilibhitand Bisalpui tahsils, stretching southwards for a consider- able distance on either side of the Mala. When that river is crossed the aspect of the countiy changes greatly. At first there is the usual line of forest villages, liampered continually by abaci climate and the incessant ravages of deer, pig and other wild animals ; but beyond this is an open expanse of highly tilled country, with a fertile loam or clay soil, varied by narrow stiips of a lighter texture along the high banks of the drainage channels. It is well wooded throughout, and its chaiaeter changes gradually from that of the Tarai in the northern portions of the PiliLhit tahsil to that of the openGangstic plain in Bisalpur. The noith l* mainly r ce land interspersed with Btretchea of grass jungle that are more valuable for grazing purposes than for cultivation 4 P Ubfat D strict but the patches of waste rapidly become more rare, the stiff i ice- hearing day gives way to the lighter wheat-pioducing lands ; and a large portion of Bisalpur has all the essential characteristics of the upland b&ngar of Bud ana and Shahiahanpur. But for the climate and the forest Pibbhit would be an immensely rich district, though as it is cultivation is necessarily precarious over a large portion of the area— a fact which renders it liable to great vicissitudes of fortune, A. more detailed account of the peculiarities and conditions of the various tracts will be found in. the description of the several parganas. Boughly speaking the soils of the district are identical with those found throughout the G angelic plain, and particularly those .occuning in the sub-Himalayan belt. They consist m the main of sand or S7iw, clay or rmtiar and the mixture of sand and clay in vaiying proportions, known as dmnat or doras t and usually styled loam. The presence of sand may invariably he attributed to fluvial action at some epoch, the deposit depending on the rapidity of the current, since a violent flow will carry away all the lighter particles borne in suspension, permitting only the heavier grains to settle. A. change in the course of a river will leave the sandbanks exposed, while the deeper pools will contain a collection of lighter silt, principally decayed vegetable and other organic matter which form the basis of clay. It is always the case that sand is found on the highest levels of an alluvial tract, loam in the intermediate zone and clay in the depressions. Consequently the distribution of soils is more or less accidental, and their relative proportions depend on the physical configuration of the ground. Further, the classification of soils is a somewhat arbitrary proceeding, as one kind blends into the next without any perceptible distinction, so that strict accuracy is unobtainable, though the demarcation effected for settlement purposes gives a sufficiently dear idea of the nature cl the soils in the several subdivisions of the district. The result of the survey conducted at the second regular settlement showed that of the area assessed, which by no means corresponds with the whole district, 07*7 per cent was loam, 25-6 per cent, clay ami 6-7 per cent, sandy bhur. It should be noted that the last merely denotes bhiv pf the most inveterate description General F&iturte & and indeed in the case of Puranpur it was admitted that, though 89 per cent, was returned as dwmat and only 3'1 per cent, as bhuf, the dormer hi most villages Was hardly distinguishable from the latter and that either term might be applied to the land ruth equal propriety In the other paiganas the distinction was more definite: loam forrned 6G-0 per cent, of the land in Pilibhit, 66'S in Bisalpur and I5B per cent, in Jahauabad The propor- tion of clay is greatest in Jahunabad, whole it amounted to 50-9 per cent, of the area, followed by 2P9 in Pilibhit, 234 in Bisalpur and 7 6 per cent m Puianpur. Jahanabad has the least bhw, this soil compiling hut 3*S per cent, of thewdiole: Pilibhit has S 2 and Bisalpur 9 S per cent. The total excludes the fine alluvial deposit; of the Ichadir in Bisalpur winch has a distinctive character of its own, being a uch mud constantly renewed by ilooda and varying in ihickness fiom soveral feet to a few mchos of good soil on an underlying stratum of sand. In the latter case it is known as lamp, and, though very fertile m vears of drought, it is liable to become saturated, while the rahi crops are subject to lu&u Several local varieties of the ordinary soils aic recognised. Clay differs fiom place to place in weight, colour, cohesivencss and liability to split into fissures under the influence of the hot weather, though in ovciy case it is very retentive of momtuie, requires more tillage than any other kind, is too stiff to mani- pulate when baked by the sun, bur at the same time imbibes the rain water very freely. The Ltd, is wwiw/r proper, a bluish or blackish soil, which produces all crops except huj/'ii, and the autumn pulses; and though it demands much Uboui, water aud manure, in the hands of Pains and Lodhe it is fully tbo equal of loam. The greasy and sticky clay is called chihiot; that found in low situations hi a drainage Imo, where the crops aie exposed to damage from floods, is known as yhud r oi jkobar, aud can ho much improved by an admixture of sand,, ij ocpieni tillage and deep ploughing, so as to render it more poious; and the whitish heavy day, which becomes pasty with lain aud as hard as iron with heat, is distinguished as hhciput. The .last s of little value, producing only the inferior kinds of rice: it j-Qg a Q £ un ant rainfall to b iorkal 1 aud thou rota na 6 Pilibhvt thstrwt the moisture to such an extent that the water stagnates and the roots of the plant rot Loam noth a large admixture of clay is generally called dor as > while the term dv.mat is applied to the light porous soil, which is ike more common. The former is the best of all, producing very fine sugarcane, wheat and gram, and is found chiefly in the north on ths high banks of the Deoha, and the east of Sisal pur cm the edges of the clay tract. For settle- ment purposes ditmnt was divided into two classes, the superior kind containing less than 60 per cent of sand and the inferior, called locally mdaoii' or bkw minora , a greater proportion. Another variety of a calcareous nature and a yellowish colour is known as siwai, and is readily distinguished by its greasy and smooth fed, its cohesiveness and lack of grittincss. This is fully the equal of first-class downed with water and manure, but otherwise differs little from good bhw\\ Similarly bb.hr itself may be greatly improved by tillage, and is often treated by working in clay, silt or mud from river beds and tanks, or vegetable mould, In its natural state it is of little value, but with sufficient moisture it produces fair crops of the inferior staples in both harvests. The worst blmr occurs where the deposit i» of little depth and the surface soil is apt to be swept away by the fierce May winds, leaving a bai ren substratum of indurated sand or clay which can only be cultivated after a long period of fallow. The rivers of the district belong to several distinct systems. In the north a comparatively narrow strip is drained by the Sards, of which the basin extends from the high hank called the Chauka Dhaha to the boundaries of bvepai and Kheri. 'West of this high bank, in the central cultivated portion of pargana Puranpur, are the sources of several streams which unite to form the Gumti. The valley of the latter river is bounded on the west by a fairly well-defined watershed running north and south, beyond which the drainage is effected by the Deoha and its numerous affluents. The aica comprised m this system extends over nearly one-half of the district; but the western portion of pargana Jah&uabad is separated from the rest by a water parting marked by the line of the Kailas canal, to the west of which the drainage passes into the tributary streams of the eastern Bahgul, an important feeder of the Eamganga. The great majority of General Features 7 the streams are small in size, though of considerable value for irrigation purposes, and have their origin either in the swamps of the Naini Tal Tarai or else in depressions within the boundanes of this district. The Sarda and Deoha alone derive their sources from the hills of Kumaun, anil only the former can lay claim to the title of a snowfed river. Up to the point where it leaves the hills, close to Tanakpur in the Almora district, the Sarda is known as the Kali, this being the name given to the largest of the contributory streams which go to form the river, though a large proportion of the volume is derived from the Sarju, western Ramganga, Gori and X)auli, which rise in different parts of the snowy range. Below Tanak- pur the name of Sarda is generally employed to denote the river, but soon after leaving tins district it is commonly designated the Chauka, retaining this appellation till it unites with the Kauriala to form the Ghagra, After debouching on the plains the Sarda for some distance forms the boundary between the British and Nepalese territories, flowing in a southerly or south-easterly direction, generally in one bed, with tolerably high and wooded banks. After a few miles, however, it parts with the characteristics of the lull streams ; every mile rapids become rarer, the bed is less strewn with boulders and sandbanks are more numerous. Near Banbasa, in pargaua Bilheri of the Tarai, the river separates into two streams which reunite about fourteen miles lower down, enclosing the island known as Chandni Chauk. Till within comparatively recent times the main stream passed along the western channel, but of late years there has been a constantly increasing tendency to utilize the eastern channel to the exclusion of the former, which now carries only a few inches of water during the hot weather. This western channel is nevertheless the boundary of Nepal as far as the junction, which occurs at the point where the Sarda enters Pilibh.it in the extreme north of pargaua Puraupur, one mile above Mundia-ghat, The latter is the. ferry on the main, road between Pilibb.it and Nepal, which forms the principal line of traffic between the two territories. Thence the Sarda flows in a south-easterly direction through the district, taking a tortuous and constantly changing course as it traverses the lowly mg are* s JbUb! t 3 si c iii the east of Paranpur, and it finally leaves the district at the Dighia ferry, where it passes into Ehen. Below Mund ! a- ghat it has a lovf velocity except in times of flood and its bed is no longer stony, but consists at first of sand and afterwauls of mud. There are no rap id a, and the banks arc so soft that the stream has no difficulty 111 smoothing down obstiuctions or oamng oat for itself fresh channels The average minimum cold-weather discharge is lit, tie more than 5,300 cubic feet pec second, bus sometimes the Saida swells fco an enormous size, attaining a. discharge of nearly 100,000 cubic feet per second : and on such occasions a considerable tract of country is submerged, more especially on the eastern bank. In heavy floods of this nature the Saida is apt to change its coarse to a remarkable extent, and this accounts for the numerous abandoned channels and ba.k waters w itb which tho lace of the counuy is scored. In some cases they cany a continuous stream of water, at any rate during the rains, while elsowbeio they are mere swamps, often of a semicircular shape, indicating courses which the river has for a time adopted and then abandoned. Few of these old channels have any definite name, but they are known genencally as sufiae, or else are called after the villages through which they pass. The most important, ho never, is the Chauka, or Chuka, a perennial stream that follows the line of the old high bank and marks the most westerly course ever adopted by the Sards., at any rate u lfchia historical times The Chauka invariably keeps close to the Dhaba or flood bank on its right, while on its left or eastern side stretches tho marshland of the Saida valley . Tho stream forms a great obstacle to cioss-country communication and, like the ^arda, is of no me for irrigation purposes. It has a course of some 25 miles in this district and rejoins tho Saida near Mofcia-ghat. where the main river approaches close to tho cliff that marks the edge of the upland. Another tributary of the Sards is the Ul, which takes its xm m the forest* of Dhaka Chat, in the south-east of the Puranpur pargana. It is here a small and ill-defined stream, carrying very little water ; hut subsequently it attains con- siderable dimensions, a t fir, t foaming the border between the Oe ic l lures <5 ShahjaJmnpur and Jvhcn districts, and then traversing the latter foi nearly all it*? length. It seems probable that the TJ1 was once a channel of the Sarda, though at a very 1 emote date, since in its upper reaches the stream flows at a much higher lovcl than the laiger river. The climate along us bank is extremely unhealthy, and the name is locally derived from the word aul } which hero denotes malaiial fever. The central poiuon of Puranpm is drained by the Guwti and its affluents. These have all the characteristics of Tarar sti earns, rising m the swamps formed by the springs that emerge from the surface by sypliomc influence afier passing under the stony strata of the Bhabai. These springs form swamps m natural hollows, now filled to a considerable dopth with a black spongy soil lesembling peat ; and the streams that issue thue- fiom are at first nothing more than a disconnected chain of morasses following the natural drainage lines of the countiy. The Gumti or Gomati itsilf rises near Mainakot but does not assume a definite channel for some miles, its course at first being marked by a mere string of jhih. It iuei eases in volume towards the souih of the pargana after being joined by the Gachai or Gonchai, w liich has its source near Gnlab Tanda, and also by several minor watercourses. It c-ventually passes into Sliahjahanpur and by this time has become a fairly well- defined stream, though the current is sluggish and the bed is almost dry in summer. The flow' of water too is constantly interrupted by die mnneious earthen dams that arc thionn acioss the stieam for the propose of irrigating the rice fields. Two small tributaries of the Gumti traverse the country to the east of the road from Puranpur to Shahjahanpur, and are known as the Jhukna and Baiua, These have a similar ougin, the foimei using - near Anantpur and flowing southwards past Jatpura and Rhaiampur, wdule the latter stalls between Puran- pur and Shorpur, flowing close to MuzafFarnagar and joining the Jhukna just beyond the bonders of the district. The next river to the Gumti on. the west is tho Khanaut, a somewhat larger stream of a very similar nature. Rising in the forest near Jamania, it flows southwaide and after a short course receives the Hath a on ta left bank thence continuing 10 Pihbfat District past Shahgarh to the north-eastern eornsr of pargana Bie&lpur, separating it at first from Puranpur and afterwards from the Shahj&hanpur district. In the upper portion of its course the river la little more than a series of reedy swamps ; but lower down the banks become fairly defined and the bed assumes a sandy character. In the south-east of Bisalpur the banks, especially on the west, are remarkably high, forming a steep cliff which suggests the idea that at one time the river was of much greater dimensions than at present. It is still subject to violent floods and ia seldom utilized for irrigation. After leaving this district the Xvhanaut traverses Shahjahanpur for a considerable distance, eventually falling into the Deoha at Kosa. The river recsi ves a few tributaries on its western bank m this district, the chief being the Khawa, a small stream that traverses Mio forest in the north-east corner of Bisalpur. This Khawa is joined by a channel of the same name, though also known, as the Katni or Kau, which connects it with the Mam. The channel ia commonly believed to be of artificial origin, and local tradition attributes its construction to Raja Ball a, who lived at Deona, in the tenth century. In the extreme south of Bisalpur there is another small tributary called the Sakaria, which rises near Bamrauli and falls into the Khanaut in Shahjahanpur. The Mala has its source in a sexies of swamps on the northern borders of tha distinct, close to the boundaries of the Pilibhit and Puranpur parganas. It traverses the belt of forest land which extends southwards through the centre of the district, and for along distance the stream is nothingmore than a connected chain of deep morasses choked with reeds. As far as Maehm-gbat, where it is crossed by the road from Pilibhit to Puranpur, the bed is seldom well defined, being a shallow depression of swampy ground, in places attaining a breadth of more than a mile. The sluggish character of the stream has been accentuated bv the construction of numerous irrigation dams made by the Roklks to the great detriment of the climate and the surrounding country. A short distance below Nachm-gliat the Mala passes into Biaal- pnr and is thenceforward known m the Ixatna. Under this different name it entirely changes its character, becoming a narrow stream with a sandy bed, high banks and no M adir, ChneraX Features li save for a few fields hero and there liable to be spodfc by the constant floo .a. The Ivatna tiaverses the centre of the pargaaa, dividing it into two almost equal parts : for the last few miles it forms the district boundary, and then passes into Shahjahanpur to join the Deo ha. 'The Mala is extensively used for irrigation, in Bisalpur, the water being held up by means of temporary dams. These arc regularly constructed at Muuclia Semnagar in the extrema north and again between Paharganj and Dhaka- wala, a shoxt distance south-east fiom the town of Bisalpur. Both dams supply a large tract of country, the latter being said to irrigate no fewer than 54 villages. In dry years many smaller enterprises of a similar nature are unclei taken by the villagers at various parts along the stream. There arc several u xbutaries of the Mala, though most of them possess little importance. The Xulai rises near ]N T eoria Husaimpur and flovvsin a very tortuous course along the outer edge of the forest, to join the mainstream just above Naohni-ghat. It receives two affluents, both known as the Katna, one of which joins it on the east at Dharnel a, w hile the junction with the other is at Gujraula, some two miles from .Nackni-ghat A more considerable stream is the Amerhi or Amri, which originates xn throe distinct watercourses in the south of parganaPdibhit. Those unite to the eas t of Barkbera, and the combined waters flow southwards, keeping parallel to the Bisalpur road, to join the Ivatnti at Sikh a, three nnles north-east from the tahbii headquarters. The Amerhi is a perennial stream, with a clay bod and clearly defined banks. Like the Patna, it is extensively used for irrigation and is regularly dammed at Bhopatpur close to Barkbera. The Ivafcna receives no affluents on its left bank in this district. In the south-east of Biaalpur there is a small stream known as the Khandni, which rises near Maraud, and flows for a considerable distance through the pargana, and then for several miles forms the boundary before passing into Shahjahanpur to join the Kaimua, another tributary of the Deoba, It contains but little water except during the rains, but has a marked influence on the country in its neighbourhood, the land being particularly dry and sandy along its hanks. The rivers next in order to the west are the Deoha and its immediate feeders. This stream has its source in the southern 12 P l bl it Dish 'id slopes of tie lo e i 11s, Pafct Chats, a 1 ot the iSAmnTal distr cfe At first in ,s known as the Naadhaur, hut after leaving the hills at Chorgalha it is called the Dooha, preserving this name in the Bhabar, Tarsi and lhlihh.it. After entering Shahjahaupur, however, it lsgenerally known as the Gacra and retains this appel- lation hll it falls into the Ramgaoga m Harden The Deoha enters this districtm the extreme north, and forms the bomiJaiy between the Pih hint and Jahanaha l parganas, flowing southwards with a strong and rapid eairent. On leaving the PiULhit tuhsil it for some miles separates Bisnlpm from the Bareilly district and then cuts into that pargana, maintaining the .same direction and flowing close to the town of Bisalpur on the west. Below the ferry on the Bareilly road it hen Is southwards, and again forms the distiict boundary as far as the trij unction of Pilibhit, Bareilly and Shah jahanpur. The river Las a wide hod, m places more than a mile m breadth between fha high banks; but the actual channel, which is constantly liable to change, is not more than three or four him 5 rod feet wddo. Occasionally the Dcoha comes clown in violent floods, and ao such limes it becomes a very bioad and deep river with a discharge of sonm 26,000 cubic foot per second, although in summer the volume does not exceed 200 cubic feet. Save when the river is in Cool, there is a considerable stretch of kkaclir on either side, hut its value for agricultural purposes varies from year to year, since the silt deposited is far from uniform in character ami the best land of one year may be converted by the annual inundation into the worst land of the next, When the raiufall is light these hhudirs, also known as ku>ndr\\s, yield excellent crops at both harvests, though cultiva- tion is necessarily precaiious; there is a constant risk of damage to the Muir if , while u delay in the advent of the floods defers the the spring sowings to the injury of the rail crop. ’Where cultivation is not practicable the khndir products largo quanti- ties of coarse grass, which has a considerable value for thatching and other purposes , but sometimes the land below the high banks is a mere stretch of barren sand, useless foi anything except melon cultivation. In this distiiet the rivor bed is too wide to be profitably clammed for irrigation purposes, and although a proposal was made iu IS II to cousfcnict an embankment across l r f ? 13 At ! the stieam in fens upper pun, of thj eoama tho failure of an experimental h jh i-woi k caused tho scheme to be abandoned.

Of those on the h*£f hank the first is the Lohia, which rises in jurgaun Bdliori of tho Nami Tal Tarai and enters the extreme north of pargana Pilibhit at Bhaglania; after a course of a few moles it joins the river near Majhra, some 13 miles north of Pilibhit town. This stream flows in a sandy and a very tortuous bed and is of a perennial character, although its wateis are far too scant v to be navigable. Even in the summer it can show a depth nf two foot and a discharge sufficient to supply a small canal, although hitherto its irrigating powers have been neglected. The Khakra is a much larger stieam, and has a course of considerable length through pargana Buheri before entering the district to the north of hfeona Husainpur, In the upper part its yolumc is increased by the water of tho S&tnia, while further down it receives on its r,ght bank the Latina and other minor watercourses Maintaining a south-westerly direction, it roaches the outskirts of Pilibhit, and time turns west to join the Dooha. Tho Khakra has a day bod with soft alluvial banks, and like the Lohia it retains water in summer, though the volume is greatly reduced in dry seasons; tho moan cold u eather discharge is 30 cubic feet per second, the minimum being 22 and the maximum in time of flood 1,405 cubic feet. There are one or two other small affluents of the Duoha in pargana Pilibhit, the chief being the Sanda, which is called after the village of that name in which it rises, and has a course of some 12 miles before joining the river about five mips south of the district headquarters. The Bapatua drains tho nanow strip of country in pargana Bisalpnr between the Deoha and the Katna. It originates in a swamp some ten miles to the north of Bisalpnr, and from a small watercourse grows rapidly into a fair-sized river It is extensively utilized for irrigation purposes, and js regularly 14 Phi bh t Dv&r cl lammed just before Dagmg Lb dutr.ot at Bsseon Khanpur, above which point, for a distant*.; of savos.il miles, it hag a deop unfordable stream The first oE the Peoha tribul aides on the west or right hank is tho Sundaria, an insignificant Tarni stream with a very short course in this district Tho next is the upper Kailas, which joins tho main nver at Pconi, in pargana Jahanabad, just below tho crossing on tho road from Xeona ITusampur to Sitarganj. The Kailas formerly had its sou ice in tin- Tarai, hut was con- verted into a hill stream by the overflow of tho Dwoha, which hurst into it near Chorgallia. It is chiefly of importance on account of the canal taken from ir, of which a description will he given later, the head-work being situated in the village of ffabclar- pur. Like the Deo ha, the Kailas is subject to heavy floods and sometimes attains a discharge of 10,0(10 cubic feet per second as compared with the mean winter discharge of 100 cubic foot ; but the latter figure depends greatly on the amount of water taken out for irrigation or thrown into the river for drainage purposes. Several other small streams join the Dooha on its right bank m pargana Jahanabad at Jagat, Kagana and elsewhere : but in no case are these of any importance, nor have they oven distinctive names. The remaining rivers belong to a different system, being tributaries of the Bahgul. The first is tho A bear a, also called the Apsara, Absaria or Apsareha. It rises in the Tarai and enters Jahanabad near the village of Balpur ; then, traversing that pargana from north to south, it passes into Nmvabganj, and there joins the Pangadi below Mundia Chaudhri, the combined waters being thenceforward known as the lower Kailas. There is a very slightly-marked watershed between this stream and the Kailas in its tipper reaches, but lower down the banks are well-defined and consist, like the hod, of stiff clay. Tho channel is much choked with weeds and the nver is not navigable, but it is extensively used for irrigation purposes, no fewer than seven dams being maintained in this district. Two of these, at Pauta and Adhkata, are Government works, the former having a masonry regulator ; while the others are kept up by the zaminclars at Bhauna, Husain Kagla, Saigawan Kagaria, Baratbojh and Jahanabad G&neral Feature* 15 The last river is the Pangaili, which is practically a tributary of the Absara. It rises in a jlnl near Bhagora m the north of pargana -Juliana bad and thence passes southwards into Nawab- ganj. It is a small but pcienn]al stream fed by numerous springs m its bed, which is of clay and sanl. The channel is well-defined and there is seldom, any overflow from other streams, so that in ordinary seasons the Pangaili acts as a very efficient drainage line. It is utilized for irrigation, but to no great extent, since it is seldom dammed and the water is usually taken direct from the stream by lift The mean, discharge varies from 10 to 50 cubic feet pci second, but the volume depends chiefly on the amount taken from the lower Kailas by the Irrigation department. These riveia constitute the drainage system of the district, and they do their work adequately, at all events so far as the upland tracts are concerned. Defective drainage, admitting no possibility of improvement, must of necessity exist in the low* lying kheulirs of the streams, and especially in the case of the Sarda : it is also unavoidable in the Tarai tracts, where the subsoil water makes its way to the surface by percolation. Apart from these there arc no instances of insufficient drainage, except in the case of the Mala swamps and along the upper reaches of the Khanaut, where the saturation of the adjoining villages is generally attributed to the unscientific construction of clams for irrigation purposes by the Rohillas. Probably something could he dona to mend matters in these parts, though it is doubtful whether the great expense that would be involved would repay the advantages to be derived therefrom ; to secure the full bene- fit of the works it would be necessary to clear the forests that exist, and it would certainly be long before the climate had sufficiently improved to render the country fit for profitable and stable cultivation. On the other hand the large number of minor swamps and depressions bear witness to local defects in the drainage system, though m few cases are these of any great extent, while at the same time they are of considerable economic value as reservoirs for the purposes of irrigation. Taking the average of the returns for the five years ending la 1907 the tetatf *rea rtndoT w*Wr 16 Pdibli t D strict amounts to 34 459 aci es oi 4 4S ;[ er cent of the entue district ; and though this includes the rivers and afci earns, a vei v consider- able amount is taken up by swamps and depressions in which the surface drainage collects, and which possess no adequate outlet The proportion varies from 5 23 in pargana JahanabacI to 404 in Piiibhit, 4*62 in Puranpur and 3 -Si per cent, in Bivalpur, There are no large open shoots of water that can propel ly be described as lakes, but small lagoons, >hUs and tanks are fairly common in most parts of the district. Of the same nature arc the numerous discarded channels called dkbvis, along the course of the Khaki a and Deoha in the Piiibhit tahsil. These jhils and talabs aie in most cases well stocked with rohu and other species of fish, and on all of them waterfowl abound during the cold season. They produce a kind of wild ike culled pasahi. the a inghara or watmmfe, and occasionally the Ihusinda or edible lotus. In most, cases they have theii own names as distinct from those of the villages in which they are situated, and the more important will be mentioned in the accounts of the various parganas. The hulk of the forest land, and indeed all the more valu- able portion, is reserved by the government and is administered under the Forest department. The area thus treated is 95,543 acres, or 149*29 square miles in extent, and is confined to the parganas of Piiibhit and Puranpur. Roughly speaking, the forest consists of two long and narrow stiips uniting in the north, one extending m a southerly direction on either sick of the Mala as far as the northern boundary of Bisalpur, while the other stretches along the right bank of the Chauka to its junction with the Sarda, and thence continues along the latter stream to the borders of Shahjahanpur and Kheri. The history of forest administration in the two parganas has been very dissimilar. Those in Piiibhit have all along remained at the entire disposal of Government, and the surrounding tenantry have had to pay for all the produce taken from them. In Puranpur, on the other hand, the forests were regarded as a hindrance to the extension of cultivation and every effort was made to reduce the area. The villagers were allowed to remove all produce free of charge, end in 1 844 the forests were divided into 22 allotments of three G rend r fv> s 17 or four thousand acres each, anti these allotments were offered under the usual terms of the waste land rules, In 1553 ten of them were made over to grantees under condition of clearing and cultivating a cert aiu proportion of the area within a fixed time, while the remainder continued as before under the manage- rnsnt of the district officer, subject to the control of the conser- vator of forests in (ho central circle. In 1S77 the giants were, with three exceptions, iceumed as tho conditions had not boon fulfilled, and the forests were transferred to the Quclh circle and placed in charge of a divisional forest officer • and the whole area, save for a few cultivated villages, was demarcated and notified as reserved forest in JS79 ■*’ Since that date a few changes have occurred in the area, but in no case of any import- ance: 110 acres were given up on amount of the 1 ait way in 1891 and 192 acres wore disforested in 1898, having been included by mistake in tJie original notification On the other hand an addition of 391 seres in the village of Baibaha was acquire! at a pitblle’auc- tion m 1893, though two years later this was exchanged for 401 acres lying in tha same village and in Nag'phan f Tho boundary was at first demarcated by m&ans ofa'ditch, or el-o by roads, but in 1893 it was defined anew by means of serially-numbered stone pillars. Physically the forest may be divided into two parts, the one comp rising the high alluvial land which extends westwards from the old flood bank of the Chauka, while the rest includes tho unstable or low alluvium between this bank and the Chauka river. The latter area must at one time have formed the bod of the Sarda, and now consists of tracts of grass jungle intersected with th ejhils and morasses that mark abandoned channels of the stream ; and during the rains the whole of this portion remains under water, with the exception of a few more elevated plots of giound. Tho length of this strip is about 20 miles, hut its width varies from a few chains to a quarter of a mile, while sometimes the river runs at tho very foot of the Chauka Dbaha or high bank which separates the swamps from the high alluvium. This Chauka Dhaka is well-defined throughout and , as already mentioned, has rugged and precipitous hanks of considerable height running morw or less parallel to tho ♦ NotiSoa t iom Nw~19 S^dmol the 25th February and the 23/d July 1679. f SofciacUioa m. 378F/480— AH of the 6th May 1S03 2 18 Pilibhit District piesents course of the stivam. Fiom the crest the ground slopes gradually inland towards the south till it eventually merges in the level country of the plains. The forest belt assumes thefoim of a horseshoe, including an expanse of cultivation from ten to sixteen miles wide. On the east it extends inland from the high bank of the Chauka and Sarda, till the latter river leaves the district; while the western curve stretches along both sides of the Mala swamp for a distance of some 20 miles. The forest \\anes m width fiom one to six miles, the average being about four miles. The level surface is biokan by the Ixatna and Mala, which dram the western portions, while the surplus waters of the north and east pass into the swamps which form the source of the Khanaut and Gumti rivers. There are no other streams of importance, but the whole area is traversed by a succession of open glades, locally called chandctrs, which are covered with stunted sal scrub mixed with a scanty crop of various glasses, and occupy extensive sfcups of high and low lauds characterised by a poor and sandy soil, Since in almost all cases they run parallel to the nvei, it seems probable that they occupy the sites of former channels, of which portions by the accident of irregular water action contain a fairly rich soil now covered with tree growth, while elsewhere on the deposit of neaily pure sand there is nothing but scrub and grass. The soil in the upland forests ranges from mere sand to a rich loam with a strong admixture of clay : in the low alluvium is generally a line silt, deposited in a thin layer over coarse river sand. Mater is everywhere near the surface, the depth of the spring level never exceeding 80 feet, and that only in the diy weather, while m most cases it is very much less. In the tiee- covered portion of the forests about two -thirds of the growth consist of sal, but the timber is m most cases inferior owing principally to neglect m the past. The best trees are to be found m the north, where their distance from the village lands has proved a more or less efficient protection ; bnt even there timber of large girth is rare, the ciop being principally poles and saplings In the more accessible portions the unre- stricted fellings that took place before the forests were reserved have left nothing but saplings interspersed with a few large trees of defect ye and irregular growth which have frequently been General Features 19 pollarded. In the cJuondars and the outskirts of the forest the sal trees are mere stunted and bushy scrub, the result of constant ill-treatment and adverse natural causes. Of the remaining species the most important is the asna, as tuna or -sain ( Termi- nal oa tomentoscc ) , which occurs in low moist situations with a clay soil, and is almost wholly confined to the east of Puranpur. The remaining trees vary with the locality. In damp spots and along watercourses the most common are the haldu(Adina cordifoha), b.nm ( Stephegyne pctrvi fulul ), jamm, near a and Inis a, though the ground is often occupied by a dense growth of inferior varieties possessing no economic value. On the dry soils are found the tendu (Biospy r os meltmoxylon), dhcmnoxasid ( Zagerskrcemia parviflont) and some others of less importance. Reproduction is general^ pooi : and this constitutes one of the chief disadvantages of the Pihbhit forest. Tim fact has been ascribed to the height of the water level, but is more probably due to the constant influence of frost and fire, though the compara- tively small depth of the surface soil is m most cases a determining factor, The gro ,vth is further restricted by the number of climbers, which necessitates constant attention on the part of the forest staff. The minor produce consists chiefly of grasses of various descriptions, the most valuable of which is baib, though this is found in abundance only in the western half of the division. The reservation of the forest did not affect the rights that had been acquired in the past ; and as their uncontrolled exercise threatened the very existence of the forest, especially in Puranpur, a regular settlement was undertaken in 1882, though the opera- tions were not concluded till four years later. It was recorded that 44 villages in pargana Pilibhit had rights to grazing', timber and minor produce, to bo supplied at current rates, and con- sequently an area of 8,865 acres was set aside to meet these requirements. In the case of Puranpur no fewer lhan270 villages were declared to have acquired rights to free grazing and foiest produce for agricultural and domestic requirements only, and two-thirds of the entire area were set aside for iho purpose. This poition was subdivided into 24 oompartmenLs, known as restiicted anl unrestricted the former being c oselto follmg and grazing 20 T'dabh’d Ihatrict for the greater part of the year. Subsequently the lights were further defined ; the 44 villages of Pxlibhit being allowed to graze 7,108 head of cattle in the open area and to rocoive aunually 2,466 maunds of timber, and grass amounting to 2 776 cartloads. The Puranpur villages are entitled to graze 44,230 head of cattle free of charge and to receive, without payment, an undefined amount of timber, fuel and grass for their onn requirements. The existence of these rights imposes a heavy burden on the forests, and also renders the task of management very diffi- cult, Before reservation the work was in i he hands of the district officers, who collected the grazing and other duos, while the exploitation of the forests was leased to contractors On the transfer of the area to the Fores g department the same system was continued for some, years, but was gradually aban- doned for one of permits, by nhieh passes were given to light- holders and purchasers, in the latter ease on payment bcfoio removal of the produce In 1.880 three blocks m Pihbh.it, with an area of 25,870 acres, were closed and brought under file protection, and similar measures were extended to the Jlamatroi and Dhanara-ghat reserved blocks, aggregating 10,045 acres in Puranpur, iu 1881 and 1886 respectively. In these areas the only produce allowed to he removed was dry timber and fuel, minor produce being either fanned or collected dtpaitmentally. Subsequently improvement fellings were started in the north * but the undertaking met with varying success, owing to the instability of the market In this area too cinnbor-eulting was begun, while other improvements consisted in the construction of roads, velh, rest-houses and quarters for the staff, as well as the extension of fire protection to all the forest save the unrestricted blocks, which were burnt annually under departmental super- vision. The present system of management follows the lines of a working plan drawn up in 1896, The area was divided into four working circles, of which the first or closed reserves com- prise 45,316 acres of high land along the Mala and Chauka Dhaha with the best crop ; the second or open reserves lying in Pilibhit aggregate 8,865 acres where, though the growth is good, grazing has bo be permitted ; the third or restricted reserves in Puranpur aro 19,630 acres n extent and th unrestricted reserves Geae cl Fe tures 21 consist of the remaining area in Puranpur, m which the villageis have full rights. Under the terms of the settlement the last two circles change places every sixteen years, though the period of partial rest is far too short to admit of a recovery, to say nothing of any impro vement of the stock. The latter is indeed only possible m the first circle, where improvement fellings have been pre- scribed for a period of fifteen years. Elsewheie nothing can he clone beyond exercising some selection m the removal of fcimhei and enforcing fire protection as far as possible Tor administi ative purposes the forests form a division, usually m the charge of an assistant conservator, with headquartei s at Bareilly. The circle includes not only the Pilibhit and Dhanava-ghat ranges, hut also part of the Bilhen forest in the Naim Tal Taiai, this being a separate lange The forests are traversed l>y a network of roads along the fire lines which, separate the various blocks. There are rest-houses at Mahof and Bargad In paigana Pilibhit, and at Chuka, Mustafabad, Barahi, Nawadia and Haiipur m Puranpur. Owing to the disadvantages from which the forests suffer, it is but natural that the income derived therefrom should be small. Large timber is not available, and the sale of fuel and small timber is hampered by the competition of ownois of pri- vate forests in the district, which can supply unprivileged villages at cheap rates and also derive much, benefit from their proximity to the railway. The object, however, has hitherto been not so much an inciease of revenue as the improvement of the existing crop, which should at any rate in certain parts become valuable with careful conservation. Before the forests were reserved the average income of the last five years was Ra. 6,104 annually, derived chiefly from grazing duos, duties on grass, firewood, charcoal and the like ; while the average expenditure was Rs. 3,050, the greater paid of this being devoted to the constiuction of roads. From 1891 to 1895 the average revenue was Rs 7,542, but the expenditure was no less than. Rs. 19,020 annually. This showed a large deficit, but it should be remembered that during the same period the estimated value of the produce removed by right-holders in pavgana Puranpur Was over lis 31 000 per annum During the next fi\\e years 22 Pllht Dsf ct end mg m 1901 the reoe jts Imp] el to an average of Bs, 3,159, ■while the expenditure was Ea. ‘23,873, the deficit being consider- ably larger than before. From 1902 to 1907 there was a distinct! improvement, though the forests are still worked at a loss The annual revenue rose to an average of Es. 15,527, while the expenditure on account of administration and other heads averaged Es, 32,427. The private forests in this district comprise the three jungle grants that were not resumed, as well as a largo area that was never demarcated. The former include grant No. 1, assigned to Messrs. Carcwds Co. of Bosa ; grant No. S, known as Mustafahad in the north of Pnranpnr ; and No 21, called Dhaka Chat, m the south of that pargana, The total area of zammdard forest is 09,305 acres, of which 10,005 acres lie in pnrgana Puranpur, 420 acres in Pilibhifc, nine in Jahauobad and the remaining 27,9G2 acres in Bisalpnr. The last occupies tho north-eastern corner of the pargana, between the Katna and Khanaut, and is a continua- tion of the forest belt stretching along the Mala. Very little of this forest, which is owned by the samindars of Dooria, has been reclaimed, as in its existing state it constitutes a property of considerable value. Thore is also a fair amount of dhnlc jungle in Bisalpnr, especially in the south-east and the south-west of the tahsil, The owners of the Pdibhit forests are the mwbindirs of Basantapur, Nagphan, Easuia, Baibaha and Mahof; and in Puranpur the jangle land is principally hold by tho owners of Sherpur, Madho T&nda, Jatpura and G hung chai. A large income is derived from these forests on account of grazing, timber, fuel for the railway and coarse grasses, the last being carefully preserved and sold at good prices. There arc also extensive patches of grass in the uncultivated parts of tho low- lands along the Deoha and Khakra. These are generally leased to dealers and traders, who have it cut and transported to Pilibhit and other towns; tho amount of the lease depends upon the proximity of the market. As is invariably the case in districts which possess a large amount of natural forest, the area occupied by artificial groves is small. The present average is 12,386 acres, or 1-61 per cent, of the whole district excluding the forests; and of this 6 } 39o acres General Feafwes 23 representing ° “o per cent. of that pargana. lie m Bisalpur, which is the furthest removed from the forest tract. In Puranpur the proportion is only 76 per cent., while in tire headquarters tahsil it is 1‘45 in Tahanabad and T6Sper cent, m the Pilibhit pargana On the other hand there has been a decided decline in the area of grove land during the past half-century. The Pathans were devoted to their groves, and planted an enormous numbs r of trees in their territories ; but these have in most cases died without being replaced, although with the Hindus there is still some sentimental attachment to groves and it is deemed improper to fell trees without planting others in their stead. Nevertheless it is almost certain that if grove lands had not been exempted from assessment the loss would have been greater than has been the case; for in numerous instances, owing to the demand for fuel on the part of the railway, the desire to secure the maximum area of cultivation, and various other causes, the garni nd arm have not hesitated to sacrifice their groves The decrease may be illus- trated by the fact that in 1868 Bisalpur hal a grove area of 7,795 acres, and the rest of the district contained 6,727 acres, involving a decline of 2,186 acres in forty years. The proportion is still fairly high m Bisalpur, while the Ptlibhit tahsil may be described as moderately well wooded. The trees are principally mangoes, from the fruit of which a considerable income is derived, the owners usually fanning the produce to persons residing in or near the towns Other varieties are sometimes planted, especially the jaman (Eugenia jcvmholrma), which is valued for its fruit, and timber trees such as the g mlar and Aisl lam. Orchards of fruit trees, principally guavas, oranges, limes and citrons, are maintained by many of the well-to-do zct'tnindars, especially in the vicinity of Pilibhit. The groves are often surrounded by lofty hedges of bamboos, which thrive extremely well in the Bisalpur tahsil, the finest plantations being at Bisal- pur itself, Peoria and Marauri. The other trees, which are to be soon scattered over the face of the country, belong mainly to the species already mentioned and to the various kinds of fig, such as the bargad , pipal and pahir. The geology of the district exposes nothing beyond the ordinary Gangs tic alluvium, and consequently the mineral 24 pm f d h prul i ts ai \\ i f i 1 or p actical \\ uipoo«s the.) are confined to fowl r and buck-earth, for though the saline* efflorescences known as reh are he found in a, few places they do nor. occur m suificuont quantity to he of any economic value. Even Joxnkar is scarce, owing chiefly to the shallow depth of the subsoil in tht northern paeganas* On the A osar a sear JAhanaba 1 the thickness of the alluvial deposit is little more than 16 feet, at which depth boulders are encountered ; while on the Pangaili near Nawabganj, m Bareilly, they are found at 20 feet, the intervening strata being either clay or sand of various descriptions, such as the ordinal') white 3 or blue or a coarse-g iainctl red variety. In the Bisalpm tab® il some fa'iik >,t or a fair quality is obtainable from the quarry at Chhura, os the Bartally road, though this is almost exhausted • the cost averages about Rs. 7 poi hundred cubic feci, exclusive of cairiage, for which the usual charge is eight annas per mile. The absence of Ji'inhtr largely accounts for the paucity of metalled roads, since road metal has to be imported fiom Rithaura in the Baimlly district, at a cost of Rs 13 per hundred cubic foot landed at Pilibhit. A few pits of soft and inferior Jccmhccr exist near the Pangaili in pargona Jahanabad, and at Kampura and else- where m Pilihhit. Such Icmhxr can only be utilized for lime- burning, and the lime produced fetches from R,s, 22 to Its. 25 per bun Ired cubic feet Clay suitable for brickraakittg is obtain- able in most localities, but bricks are only made in the vicinity of the towns, and there is bat a small constant demand. Those of tho small country pattern cost two or throe rupees per thousand, while sand-moulded bricks of tho European type cost Its, 9 for the same quantity at Pilibhit. Other building materials are comparatively unimportant : the vast majority of the houses are built of mud or, as is thecaso in the forest tracts, of wattle or grass. The requisite timber can be obtained loyally, either free or at a nominal cost, owing to the extensive rights that have been granted in the forests and to the ability of tho mmindm's to sell at very cheap rates. Conse- quently it is common to And sol timber employed in the dwellings of even the poorest classes; and it is only in the tracls more or less remote from tho forests that the Inferior kinds of wood are in ordinary use. Stone is seldom to be seen, except in temples or flcw&i d Te times 23 the mens impoitant public buildings : it lias to be imported from Agra, and coats Rs. 8 per cubic foot ; while Rewari slates, in slabs two feet square, are obtainable at the rate of about Ea. 17 per hundred cubic feet. The roofs of common houses are generally of thatch or else of small country tiles, supported on rough-hewn rafters ; but heavy sv.l beams have to be brought from the forests of JSepal, and large tiles of the- flat type arc imported from Bareilly or more distant places. With its large areas of forest, swamp and jungle the district possesses a greater variety of species in its fauna than any other part of Rohilkhand. Their numbers, however, have been greatly reduced of late years with the extension of cultivation and the reclamation of waste, and Pilibhit is no longer the happy hunting- ground that it was in old days la the wilder parts of Pur an - pur, such as the Mala, swamp and the banks of the Sarda and Chauka, the tiger and leopard may still perhaps be reckoned habitual residents ; but elsewhere they are mere tourists, limiting their rambles to the banks of streams in a few of the northern villages, or occasionally visiting the stunted woodlands of £hsal- pur. Leopards too are sometimes found in the high grass jungles that fringe the Deoha in the north of Pilibhit; but their depre- dations are comparatively small, and in the eyes of the cultivator the occasional loss of a bullock is forgiven in consideration of the services rendered against other four-footed enemies of husbandry. The latter render agriculture precarious not only m the foicst villages, but for a mile or two beyond the jungle’s limit Wild pig are extraordinarily numerous, and the damage done by them is immense. The rest may be attributed to deer of various kinds, such as the ehUal or spotted deer and the parka or hog deer, or to the antelopes, the nilgai and blackbuek, which are far more common. The sambhar and haJear are here almost unknown, but the garni or swamp-deer (Rucervus duvotwellii) is still found, though in sadly diminished numbeis, in the north and east of Pnranpur. Other animals include hares, foxes, jackals, wolves, wild dogs and porcupines. The wild elephant rarely visits the forests of Pilibhit, and the district lies outside the range of JAeddah operations Wolves are numerous but, like the jackal, are rarely molested, in spite of the reward set 1 J l U t District on their heads, smro they arc regarded as the hound e of Kali, and it is considered extremely unlucky to kill a wolf The loss of life caused by wild animals is somewhat heavy, the annual average for the five yeais ending in 1901 being 82, though this includes deaths resulting from snakc-hite. Snakes are more than usually minacious, but no reward is given for their destiuetion: some years ago the expei iment was tried of giving a monetary rcwaul for every snake killed, but was discontinued owing to the suspicion that snakes were being hied for profit. The loss in cattle is not ascertainable, since in many instances, especially in the case of the pastures along the Sard a and Chauka, the disappearance of animals is not loportod. The usual rewards aie given for the destruction of wild animals, and in the five years mentioned above the total amount disbursed under this head was Rs. 031 on account of 34 tigers, five cube, 33 loopaids, 62 wolves and cubs and seven hytenas The red dog, the v T orst of all pests, is unfortunately brought to book but seldom. Few of the birds found in other parts of the plains are wanting m Pilibhit, while many species occur which are not common beyond tho forest bolt. Among the numerous gamebirds some are residents and others migrants. The foimer include peafowl, jungle-fowl, the black and grey partridges, fiorican and sandgrouse; while among the latter are snipe and quail. \"Wild- fowl abound along the Deoha, and in the many swamps and jhils geese, duck of every variety, teal, widgeon, pochards and shol- diake are to be found, to say nothing of cranes, ibis and many others of less value m the eyos of the sportsman. The larger rivers and the tanks abound with fish, which are highly appreciated as an arluele of food by almost all classes of the population. The species arc identical with those found throughout the east of Rohilkhaml and the plains generally, the commonest being the roh.% saul and others of the carp tribe. In the Sarda the rnahsir is to bo found m some abundance, bub it does not occur m those streams which have their origin in the plains. The chief fisheries aro those on the Deoha and in the dabris or creeks along its course. Fish are caught principally by nets and wicker traps of various sizes and descriptions, while the rod and line are also omnloyed- The fishing castes are G no IF aturw 2 principally Kahars, Mallahs and Musalmans of the lower grades : the number of professional fishermen is small, but many agricul- turists betake themselves to fishing as occasion offers. The returns of the last census, however, showed that, including depend- ants, there wore 1,003 fishermen and 1,124 fish-dealers in the district, the total being relatively large, as indeed is the case throughout the Bareilly division. The cattle bred in the district are of a superior type to those found m the parts of Rohilkhand to the south and south- west, owing no doubt to the manifest advantage enjoyed by Pilibhit in the matter of pasturage and grazing-grounds There are no special breeds, though the animals closely approximate in their main characteristics to the Parehar, Bhur and Majhra Singahi strains of Khcri. Under the prevailing system, whereby the cattle are taken in droves to the forest pastures, no regular selection is possible ; but as a rule the bullocks are somewhat small, of symmetrical shape, good paces and great powers of endurance. They arc admirably suited for draught purposes, and when yoked to the light country carts cover the ground at a very respectable pace. Pew cattle are imported, except m the Biealpnr tahsil, where less favourable conditions prevail. On the other hand dealers come in some numbers from eastern Oudh and Gorakhpur to buy cattle : they are known as Hadias, and during the cold weather they make extensive purchases, collecting their animals m temporary sheds. An attempt was once made in Biealpur to improve the local sliain by the introduction of Hatssi bulls, but these proved too big for the small country cows, and the experiment failed The climate was found to disagree with animals from the dry tracts of the Punjab, and the people viewed the innovation with suspicion. Pilibhit being a breeding district there is no lack of cattle for agricultural operations. The first regular enumeration of animals was made in 1899, and it was then ascertained that there were 114,983 bulls and bullocks and 32,013 male buffaloes, giving an average of 2*47 per plough, which was well above the provincial average, and a plough duty of 7*17 acres of cultivation, this being a distinctly low figure. The last census took place five years later in 1904, and then the pumper qf bulls and bullocks w%s 125 11 and of mple buffaloes F l b! t Fist 1 ) 'irt 28 40 242 the latter 1 emg remarkal iy numeious as Shaffjahanpu alone \\ fl a ranch la gei ai a sho el a h n l cr lotal among all the districts of the pro\\ ’mre. This gave an avoiago of 2 51 per plough, showing a larger margin than before, while the duty had dropped to 6 4 acies per plough, according to the returns of that yeai. The censers statistics also showed 88,545 cons, 1 7,10U eow- buffaloes and 02,0S6 young stock, a large increase having occuru d m each instance since the forme i enumeration. The numbei ot cows is so men hat remark able and hearts w ltness to the impoitmui of the yh i industry, as great quantities of this article are exported to Bareilly and Lucknow The cows and calves depend solely on grazing; but the bullocks from Chait to j?aw<wi are given five o± bhiiS’A, oi chopped straw daily, with a little khiili or oilcaki In the rams grass is obtamablo in abundance, and nothing e.vLia beyond salt is given; but in the winter rhan and. rice-stxav pto\\ ide sufficient fodder, and these are followed hy the gieoii L avea of sugarcane and, later, hy the stuff weeded from the holds. 4n the khmhr lands a kmd of clover called vhaupatta, oi quatrefoil, grows in al mndance and is of groat value : it is found chiefly in the wheat fields. Another useful weed is nhra (Vida native ) , which is carefully gathered and given to the animals. The spare cuttle aie sent to the jungles beyond the Sarda after the rains, and them they remain till the close of the hot weather following The 'mt rhag or herdsmen in charge are usually paid a kaohi'hit maund of gram for each buffalo and 15 sers for each cow per season. The value of cattle has greatly increased of late, owing partly to the ravages of disease and partly to the stronger demand resulting from the spread of cultivation. Between i860 and 1875 the price of bullocks is said to hart doubled, being in the latter year from Its, 18 to Rs. 22 per pair, while at present the amount ranges from. Rs. 24 to Rs, 80 for a yoke of average quality. Buffaloes have gone up in price even more, as in 1875 a pair cost from Rs. 15 to Rs. 18, whereas now they vary from Rs. 35 to Rs. 50, higher figures obtain fox draught animals of a superior description. A good bullock w ill last eleven or twelve years, and a buffalo about two years leas Pilibh.it is not a great sheep-breeding district, and m 1004 the total number of sheep was but 13-612, or much smaller than m General ieaiuree 29 any other part ol the United Provinces. Goats are move common, numbering 112,147, though this is alow figure as compared with the 1 eturns in OucLh and the eastern districts. They are hept for food, for milk and for their hair, which is manufactured into rough country blankets Goats are excluded from the forests, and this piobahly accounts for their relative scarcity: but at the same time the loss of manure is a factor of considerable importance to the agriculture of the district. The cljmate is unsuited to horse-breeding, and little has over been attempted. There ara no Government stallions m the district and the animals reared are, with few exceptions, the wretched ponies employed for transport, by Banjaras, The total m 1904 was 6, 988 horses and points, and this is laigely exceeded in all the adjoining districts Donkeys and mules are extremely s urcc and of a very inferior description. Camels too are almost unknown, except perhaps in the Bisalpui tahsil. Trans po it is effected by carts, v liich are particularly numerous :n the, case of both the ordinary country wagon seen m all parts, and the light imo-whecled cart, so common in Rohilkhand, which is reserved mainly for passenger traffic Elephants are fairly numerous, being kept by most of the larger znmuxdars, to whom they arc almost indispensable for journeys across country during the i ains. Disease among cattle is endemic in the district and at times its ravages are very serious, though bad outbreaks of rinderpest, the chief cause of mortality, have of late years been less frequent than was formerly the case. The returns are useless, owing to the defective system of reporting, hut generally it may he said that rinderpest is always present in a greater or lesser degree. Foot- -and-mouth disease is very common but comparatively seldom fatal i anthrax is sporadic but the most deadly of all ; and in the lov lying pastures tuemorrhagic septicaunia and blaekqnaiter frequently occur, in most instances resulting in the death of the animal attacked A veterinary assistant is employed by the district board, but as yet little has been achieved m the matter of inoculation. This is due to the ignorance and apathy of the people, since every means fur the prevention or extirpation of -disease is put at their disposal themorc so since the establishment V-ietnci 60 of the bacteriological laboratory at Muktcsar is .Nairn lal, which is with! a easy reach of the district. On the report of an outbreak of rinderpest telegraphic information is sent to Muktesar ; and the assistance thence obtained has often checked the spread of an epidemic, although full co-operation on the part of the owners is necessary to obtain really satisfactory results. The climate of PiliLhit exhibits consi do table variations in different parts of the district. While in the north and east it approximates to that of the Tarai, in the Bisalpur tahsilit differs but little in character from that of the adjoining parts of Bareilly and Shahjahanpur. The general features are those co mm on to the submontane belt and arc characterised bj r dampness and moderate heat in the summer, together with a partial immunity from the hot westerly winds which hero blow but rarely after sunset and are never prolonged through the night, The heat is not excessive and the maximum bempei a true is low in comparison with the records obtained m Lucknow and the southern districts; while relief is frequently afforded, espe- cially in the north of the area, by the storms which sweep clown from the hills. The cold weather begins early, generally about the second week in October, and from the beginning of November to the end of March the weather is unsurpassable, with cleai bright days and a remaikbly low temperature from, sunset to 10 A.M., at any rate till the first or second week in February. In normal seasons heavy rain falls about Christmas, and again at tbo end of January, while mists or fogs often come on during the night, sometimes lasting as late as noon : these are considered injurious to the crops, being apt to produce rust. Towards tho middle of April the west winds begin to blow, and these last with frequent intermissions of easterly breezes until early in June. They are then displaced by winds from the south, the clouds collecting gradually and violent storms occurring till tho advent of the regular rams. The latter are brought almost exclusively by the south-east monsoon, the Bombay current having but little effect here and, owing to the line of the hills, the winds during the rams blow almost directly from the east. The climate during the rams is vciy different from that experienced at other seasons, being excessively damp close and unhealthy On the first downpour General Features 31 but the weather soon becomes oppressively range is small After the beginning of kte is especially feverish and continues unpleasant till the establishment of cold weather conditions. These characteristics are intensified m the forest and Tarai tracts, while elsewhere the climate may perhaps he considered good for the latitude and elevation. The parts beyond the Mala, however, are justly di caded by the inhabitants of the rest of the district, for fever is endemic on either bank of the Sarda. East of that stieam the fields are completely deserted when once the rice is sown and are only revisited when the ciop is ripe; while fco the west much of the cultivation is carried on by lion-resident tenants. Similarly in the north there is much fever, population is sparse and cultivators are obtained with difficulty. The town of Pilibhit itself has a bad reputation, and Jahanabad is consi- dered equally insalubrious ; but it cannot be doubted that much improvement has resulted fiorn the extension of tillage, and it is probable that the effect is already to be seen in a higher temper- ature and reduced lamfall, with a growing tendency to approach the conditions prevailing in the open plains to the south The only metcoiolog.cal observations taken in the district are the records of rainfall, which are registered at each tahsil head- quarters and at Amana. Annual statistics are extant for Pilibhit town and Bisalpur fiom 1864 onwards, while those of Puranpur date from 1875, of Amaiia from 1879 and of Pilibhit cutoheiry fiom 1SS1 These serve to give a fair general average for the district, though it is doubtful as to how far the figures can be considered reliable owing to the extraordinary variations in the annual totals between Pilibhit town and the cutcherry, especially in earlier years, the difference on two separata occasions actually exceeding eleven inches. With this reservation the average annual lamfall of the district- is 49'52 inches The amount appears to vary with the latitude, for Amaria comes first with 54 54, followed by Pilibhit with 52-22, Puranpur with 49-9 and Bisalpur with only 48-59 inches. These differences, it would seem, depend on the proximity of the hills and the consequent greater susceptibility to storms, while the influence of the forests is more strongly felt It ns j robable that the fall m the Sarda tempera. falls Pthbki.i Di strict 32 \\ alley especial!} ton a cia the north east a laige r than elsewhere, but no records ..rast for tins portion of the district. As a rule, too, the amount of precipitation during the cold weather is a good deal higher in the north, than in Bisalpur, and this in some measure accounts for the difference. The annual variations cue very extensive. In the 13 years that have elapsed since ] 86-1 there have been eight occasions on which tho average has been exceeded to the amount of 25 per cent, or move, and in an equal number of years there has been a defect of similar extent. Among the abnormally wet years the most remarkable have been 1879 with a fall of 73' 2 inches, varying from 78-1 ac Pmaupnr and 77*6 at Pilibhit to 67 at Bisalpur ; 18S5 with an average of 72'2 inches, the highest being 85*3 at Pilibhit town and the lowest 64*2 at Bisalpur ; and 1894, a year of general floods, with 71*76 inches, Pilibhit again leading with S3 67, followed by Puranpur with 71*78 and Bisalpur with 71-39. The general average m this last instance would have been much higher hut for the low figure of 57 0 inches registered at A mart a. Other wot seasons were those of 1867, 1374, 1889, 1893 and 1S97, in each of which the total exceeded 65 inches. On the other hand the lowest amounts known are 27-E inches in 3.866, when the fall at Bisalpur was only 21*3 inches ; 29 0 in 1877, when there was widespread famine, especially iu Bisalpur, which received no more than 18*2 inches * ancl 26*24 in 1905, when the distribution in a great degree made up foi the deficiency. Ocher dry years were 1868, 1873, 1876, 1883 and 1895, Luton no occasion was any great distress experienced. At all times the rainfall is considerably heavier than in the districts immediately to the south, and this is a factor of the highest importance in determining the nature of the agriculture. Like all rice-producing districts, Pilibhit requires a great deal of rain and a well-sustained monsoon current : a premature cessation of the rains is the contingency most to bo deprecated, since it involves the loss of the valuable transplanted rice, which requires water till within a short time of harvest The general health of the district is illustrated by the mortuary statistics, the returns from 1891 onwards being given in the appendix,* The registration of deaths began about I860; * Appotuiix, table lit. O-emral Fmtu es 33 but the system ac first employed -was very defective and little reliance can be placed on any figures prior to 1872, when new methods were introduced. Those for this district date only from its formation, so that it is impossible to institute a comparison of existing conditions with those prevailing before 1SS0. From, the figures available it does not appear that the district is especially unhealthy. Between 1S81 and 1890 the average annual death- rate was 38*4 per rnille, which compares favourably with the corresponding returns for the Naim Tel district and is little higher than those of Khen and Bahraich to tbs east. The rest of Bohilkhand is decidedly healthy, so that in relation to the division as a whole Pihbhit has of necessity a Lad reputation. In the open country the rate is far lower, and it is only in the river valleys and the forest tracts that the death-rate is really high. During the ensuing decade, from 1891 to 1900, the average rose to 38*4 per rmlle ; bat tins may be considered somewhat abnormal, since the period commenced with a senes of exceptionally wet years, while the scarcity of 1S97 was accompanied by widespread sickness, Tne rata in 1 896 was 5S’2, owing to the unprecedented mortality from fever, and in the following year it was 43*4 : m 1894 too the excessive rainfall had an adv«ise effect, though in the remaining years the figure was decidedly low. During the six years that have since elapsed the average has been 33*1 per mills : but this was partly due to the advent of plague, and the mortality was further enhanced by a severe outbreak of cholera. The birth-rate on the other hand ia very fairly high, averaging 42 S7 pur nulla from 1881 to 1890 and 40*46 during the follow- ing decade, while duiing the past six years it has been no less than 51* 12 — a rate which is exceeded in few districts, A rapid increase of the population is, however, checked by heavy infant mortality and a low general vitality which renders the people particulaily subject to tha inroads of epidemics. Another table shows the chief causes of death, * As usual fever occupies the most prominent place, and though the term is very wide in. its application, embracing as it does in actual practice almost all diseases in which fever « a prominent symptom, it cannot be doubted that malarial fever is the ’enrse * Appendix, tibio IV. a 34 XhLibh'it District of the d strict Alv iys present n an endom c form fc o casion ally assumes the proportions of a general epidemic, though it is invariably woist in the nvei basins and m the north and east. It is mo, St violent just after the close of the rams, from September to December, and at this season the necessity of watching their crops tells heavily on the cultivating classes, With an entile absence of adequate drainage no remedy seems possible, though doubtless the extension of cultivation and its increasing stability will not be without effect Much has been done by the liberal distribution of qumino, though even at the cheap rate at which it is obtainable the people do not seem inclined to purchase the drug on their own account. There is no attempt to imitate the preventive customs of the Tharus of iNaini Tal in the construc- tion of dwelling-houses and the removal of all water to the furthest possible distance from the home The returns show adequately the havoc wrought by malarial fever. From 18b 1 to 1S01 it accounted for Sol! per cent, of the total mortality: from 1891 to 1900 for 89-7, and in the next six years for 84 0 per cunt. The average in fact varies only with tho outbreak of cholera or small-pox, and is not always highest in the most unhealthy seasons. A few years stand out as especially noticeable, the worst of all being 1896, when more than 23,000 persons died of fever, while in the following year the death-roll was unusually high. In a sporadic form cholera is always more or less prevalent, and m nearly every year some cases have been reported. Occasionally, however, it acquues more serious proportions, and on such occasions its spread is very rapid owing, no doubt, to tho height of the water level and tho consequent ease with which the wells become contaminated. Little can be done to arrest its progress when once it has established a hold on the district, though of late years remedial measures have been adopted m time and the mortality has not approached that recorded in 1882 and 1890, when 5,731 and 5,078 persons respectively were earned off, the disease accounting for one-fourth of the total number of deaths registered in those years. Since 1891 there have been six years in which the victims numbered more than a thousand souls the worst being 1892 In 1906 Hie whole country was General Featitres 35 swept by cholera, which originated in the Nepal Tarai and spread all along the submontane tract, though Piiibhit suffered less than many other districts. The ravages of small-pox were terrible throughout ilohii- khand in former days but are now almost insignificant, epidemics of any magnitude being extremely rare. Prior to the Mutiny vaccination was almost unknown, and there was no regular organization or staff employed for the purpose : inoculation was fairly common among the people, but the danger of the practice cvas fully recognised. Unfortunately there are no separate statistics for Piiibhit earlier than 1880; but it is known that the district repeatedly suffered from the disease, which cost thousands of lives year after year. Resort to vaccination did not become general till about 1865, and even then the progress achieved was very slow. Prom 1881 to 1890 the average annual number of deaths from small-pox was 615, the figure being unduly swollen by the epidemic of 1883, m which 3,353 deaths were reported, and by another, though less serious, out- break m 1888. During this period the number of persons vaccinated averaged 8,653, or no more than two per cent, of the ■whole population annually. Prom 1891 to 1900 there were no serious epidemics, though every year show’s a fair number of deaths, the average being 170. This improvement w T as obviously due to the growing popularity of vaccination, the average number of primary operations rising to 16,732, or 3’4 per cent, of the total number of inhabitants in each year. Since 1900 the district has been almost free, save for a small outbreak in 1903 : the deaths up to 1907 averaged but 44 annually, -while the number vaccinated rose to 22,228, or 4 7 per cent. Actually in the last six years more than 28 per cent, of the people have been vacci- nated, so that the district is now better protected than any other part of Rohilkhand. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipalities of Piiibhit and Bisalpur ; but no opposition is shown in the rural tracts, the people coming forward with lemarkable readiness. The staff consists of an assistant super- intendent and ten vaccinators maintained at an annual cos’ of Rs, 1,560, which is met partly from municipal contributions and pa\"tly from local funds 36 Pikbhit District Other diseases are of little importance, except perhaps pulmonary complaints and those which result from malarial fever, such as dysentery, enlarged spleen and the like. Goitic is fairly common, as is the case in all submontane districts, and it is ascribed, as usual, to the water of snowfod rivers. It is certainly true that- the disease is very prevalent all along the course of the Sarda, but it has not yet been shown that the waters of this stream possess any peculiar pioperties. Plague did not make its appearance in this district till 1904, towards the end of which year five deaths occurred from imported cases. It spread with considerable rapidity, but died out with the advent of the hot weather. Again reappearing in the winter of 1905, it caused extensive mortality in the towns and villages, hut the epidemic never assumed an alarming character. In 1908-07 the outbreak was much worse, as by this time it had permeated all Bohilkhand, though the mortality in Pilibhit has never been so serious as in the more thickly-populated tracts to the south and west. Little has so far been done m the matter of preventive measures beyond the recommendation of evacuation and the destruction of rats, together with gratuitous disinfection when desired ; but with the inauguration of a more vigorous policy it is to be hoped that the district, which has never been a centre of infection, may be freed from the Beourge. Statistics of infirmities have been collected at each census from 1SS1 onwards. The most noticeable feature is the decrease of blindness, the number of persons affliclod having fallen from 1,304 in 1881 to 927 at the last census. This is probably due in large measure to the disappearance of small-pox, as other causes of blindness are not present in any marked degree. Insanity has apparently increased from 37 to 72 cases, but much depends on classification: the latter figure is low but is probably short of the mark, owing to the maintenance of a divisional asylum at Bareilly. Leaf -mutism has slowly decreased, the total in 1901 being 201 persons thus afflicted. The connection between goitic and cretinism has been fully established, and the comparatively high figure is only natural in a district in which affections of the thyroid gland are so common. There were 115 lepers, or considerably I sa than formerly - the to'-al is about nor mal General Features 87 for Eohilkhand as a whole, though, the disease is very much more frequent in the hill tracts to the north. CHAPTER II Agriculture asto Commerce, The general conditions of the district postulate a low state of development, at any late in the northern and eastern tracts. The Bisalpur tahsil has a much smaller area of forest and waste than the rest, while its soil and climate coi respond more closely to those of the neighbouring districts, so that its cultivation is proportionately older and more stable. On the other hand there has been a very marked and extensive improvement since the early days of British rule throughout the entire area. On the cession of Rohilkhand the true k was in a deplorable condition as the result of misgovernment and years of oppression, which had effectually obliterated all signs of the progress that had undoubtedly been achieved under the Rohilla administration, No statistics remain to illustrate the extent of the decay save those of the revenue collections, though these are sufficiently striking ; anti although the restoration of peace and order under the British could not fail tc exercise a beneficial effect and to promote the development of agriculture, the process was unhappily retarded by the shortsighted revenue policy which characterised the early years of the new rigv/ne. The excessive assessments that were at first imposed had the inevitable result of retarding cultivation, since the landholders either refused to engage or else deliberately threw their fields out of tillage in the hope of convincing the authorities that the demand was incontestably too high; while the revenue was too crushing to act as an incentive to the reclamation of waste. The errors of past years were remedied to some extent at the first regular settlement of 1$37, the returns of which are the earliest now extant. The total area then under cultivation waa 330, S3o acres, representing 38'2Q per cent, of the whole district. The proportion is low, for the reason that the forest area is included ; and on the same account the figure differs greatly m the several parganas If the 40 1 libl 1 D <ti r forest land bo omitted, the Bisalpur pargana ha 1 at that time 53 2 per cent, of its area under cultivation, Jahana'bad 53-4, Pilibhrd 41 7, and Puranpur only 29 8 per cent. The comparison is nor quite fair to Bisalpur, since that pargana contains a laigc amount of foiest which is not reserved but is included in the total area. At the following settlement, thirty years later, a very great advance was observed in all pails of the; district. The land under cultivation had risen to 410,865 acres, or 48 ; 2 per cent, of the whole, representing over 5-1-2 per cent, without the forest area. The increase was greatest in pargana Pilibhit, which now had 69-0 per cent, of its land under tillage ; while Jahanabad had 71*4, Fusalpur G5'8 and Puranpur no more than 82 9 per cant cultivated. Annual returns of cultivation arc available from 1884-85 onwards, save for the interruption caused by settlement opera- tions between. 1898and 1902, both inclusive. Almost immediately after the completion of tholSdOeettlcmcnt considerable deteriora- tion set in throughout the north and east of the district, necessitat- ing rovisional operations over a large area. This involved a mark- ed decline in the total motivation, which for the three years ending in. 1886-87 averaged 406,917 aeres, Prom that time, however, a decided improvement was observed, and the area under tillage steadily increased till the commencement of the series of bad seasons from 1894 to 1897. a period of exceptional rainfall and widespread floods terminating in a drought and partial famine The result was that for the ten yeais ending m 1896-97 the aver- age area under the plough was 412,2-53 acres, the maximum being 432,987 m 1892-93, while the minimum occurred in the last year when no more than 875.640 acres were cultivated. The ensuing: season showed a distinct improvement, the figure rising to 389,770 ; and though no returns are extant for the next five years, the district prospered greatly, and cultivation went up by leaps and bounds This improvement was well maintained, and in the five years ending with 1906-07 the average area under tillage was 428,288 acres, or 5571 per cent, of the whole district, the highest point being reached in the last year when 435,711 acres were cultivated. The percentage, which is calculated irrespective of the forest aims has ween almost proportionately in all pargana® Aqr culture and C 41 cr Jahan abaci now heads the list with 67-99, and is closely followed by Bisalpur with 67-03 per cent, under cultivation. Pargana Pilibhit, which has developed more rapidly than any other part of the district, shows an average of 65*87, and Puranpur, which is still m a very backward state, has no more than 38-17 per cent, of its area under the plough, even with the omission of the extensive tracts of Government forests. These figures show, at all events, that the deterioration was but temporary, and the district at the present time is in a more flourishing condition than at any pre- vious period. With the spread of cultivation the area of culturablc waste shows a corresponding decrease : but it is still compara- tively large, especially m the Puranpur tahsil. The average amount of land classified under this head is 270,657 acres, or 35-2 per cent, of the whole district excluding the reserved forests as before. The total, however, is in some respects deceptive, since it embraces all the private forests, of which a wide area still remains, and which are of considerable economic value. This fact accounts in some measure for the high propor- tion of culturable land, 53*48 per cent., m Puranpur, and also for the relatively large area, 24 25 per cent., in Bisalpur. But in the former the high figure is also due to the practical absence of permanent cultivation in the bkur tract. The tenants in most cases cultivate where they please, taking up new and abandoning old land without reference to the landlord. The same thing occurs to some extent in the better tracts, even in old villages like Ghungchai and Madho Tanda, where a nar is tilled for two or three years and then left fallow for a long period. In the Pilibhit tahsil the pioportion is 22-08 per cent, and is much the same in both parganas, though Jahanabad with its lack of forest naturally shows a somewhat lower figure Properly speaking further large deductions must be made f i om the area, rihich for the purposes of classification includes not only groves, averaging 12,368 acres in extent, but also recent fallow and land under preparation for sugarcane, which are left untilled in the ordinary course and together make up 34,398 acres. The remainder is subdivided into old fallow and culturable waste proper the former aggregating 64 635 acres and the latter 159,238 42 Pihbh'U Duslncl acres, or 29*12 per cent, in all. There is hut little difference between these two classes in point of value, save that the latter is largely composed of foiests, which could only bo reclaimed at great expense and with little hope of profitable cultivation. The highest proportion is naturally to he found in Puranpur, where 48*3 per cent of the area comes under this description. Jahanabad, with 14*82 percent., shows the lowest figure, and then, follow Pilibhifc with 16*82, and Pis al pur with 17*73 per cent. The so-called barren area is comparatively small, for though 69,878 acres, or 9*09 per cent, of the district, are thus described, this includes 34,459 acres covered -with water and 25,291 acres occupied by roads, railways, village sites and buildings; so that the actual area of barren waste is no more than 10 12S acres, or 1*32 per cent, of the whole, the proportion being almost; constant in the several parganas. The classifica- tion is necessarily somewhat ill- defined, for it is always difficult to say -where culturable waste ends and bairon land begins; and this fact renders a comparison with previous returns of no value, since in the Bisalpur tahsil, for example, the barren area in 1868 was no less than 25,0SG acres, as compared with 8,277 acres at the last settlement and only 2,611 acres m 1906; whereas had the method of demarcation been correct, or even consistent, the areas thus described must have remained unchanged. The waste land consists for the most part of the dry sandy tracts in the river beds and on thoir banks, or else of the sterile expanses that produce nothing beyond coarse grass. There is a certain amount of usar in the Bisalpur tahsil, but nowhere does it appear in wide stretches, such as are to be seen m the districts to the south. It is somewhat remarkable that while the cultivated area has expanded so rapidly of late years theie has not been a proportion- ate development of the area bearing a double crop. The yearly returns are incomplete, and those that exist are seldom reliable; hut it appears that the practice was fairly general at the time of the last settlement. For the three years ending with 1886-87 the average area hearing two crops in the year was 72,590 acres, or nearly 1S*07 per cent, of the cultivation ; for the next ten year 3 it averaged 93,859 acres, or over 22 per cent., the proportion rising to 28 per cent n 1893 and for tho last five years ending Agr i&'jjliure, awl Commerce 43 in 1907 the annual average was 84,934 acres, or 19‘S per cent, of the actual area under tillage. The amount varies considerably from year to year, depending mainly on the nature of the season; and the fluctuations are naturally greatest m Puranpur, as a necessary result of the precarious character of that pargana. There the proportion is only 9' 52 per cent., as compared with 23 09 m Bisalpui*, 23 ‘27 in Jahanabad and 25 38 in Pilibhifi. The name applied m this district to double-cropped land is that of ilosalu,, the term being applied m contradistinction to parked, meaning fields sown for a rabl crop after a season of fallow. The general style of husbandry resembles that of Bareill), though the standard is somewhat inferior in the more backward and precarious parts of the district Its character depends mainly on the class of the cultivators, and there is a considerable differ- ence between the cultivation of Bisalpur and the south of Jahan- abad, and that of the Tam villages and those in the north and east of the Puranpur tahsil Probably in no part of the United Provinces do the ancient superstitions with regard to agriculture retain so strong a hold on the peasantry as in Pilibhit. Every act of cultivation has the nature of a religious ceremony; and though some relaxation has been observed of late in this respect custom dm hard, and even Musalmana depend as much on the Brahman astrologer as the orthodox Hindus. So numerous arc these superstitions that it is impossible even to enumerate them all, but a few may be briefly mentioned. The /ucmefa or first ploughing must tako place on the meihurat or the auspicious mom"
