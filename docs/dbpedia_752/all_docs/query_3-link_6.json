        "text": "Introduction\n\nOn July 8, 2011, Governor Dannel P. Malloy signed into law Public Act 11-136, An Act Concerning Minor Revisions to the Education Statutes. Section 18 of that act requires the State Board of Education to define “excused” and “unexcused” absences. On June 27, 2012, the State Board of Education adopted the required definitions.\n\nSchools and districts are to use these definitions to judge if a student’s absence is excused, unexcused, or of a disciplinary nature for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of section 10-198a of the Connecticut General Statutes (Policies and procedures concerning truants), and for reporting truancy. This guidance document is designed to assist schools and districts in implementing these new definitions.\n\nAccording to these definitions, the number of unexcused absences determines if the student is truant or at risk of becoming truant. According to Connecticut General Statutes section 10-198a, a “truant” means a child who has four unexcused absences in a month or 10 unexcused absences in a school year.\n\nPlease note that these definitions do not preclude districts from maintaining different local definitions of these terms for local uses. For example, a district can use its own definition of excused absences for grading purposes or eligibility to participate in extracurricular sports; these areas do not pertain to the truancy law and do not affect the reporting of truants to the state.\n\nDefinition of an Absence\n\nA student is considered to be “in attendance” if present at his/her assigned school, or an activity sponsored by the school (e.g., field trip), for over half of the regular school day. (For example, a student will be considered \"Absent/NOT In Attendance\" if he/she is Absent from 3 or more periods on a regular, 6 period day, 2 or more periods on a 4 period, abbreviated schedule day, etc.). A student who is serving an out-of-school suspension or expulsion should always be considered absent.\n\nAccording to this policy, a student who is not “in attendance” is considered absent.\n\nLevel Total Number of Days Absent Acceptable Reasons for a Student Absence to be Considered Excused Documentation Required within 10 Days 1 One through Nine Any reason that the student’s parent/guardian or guardian approves. Parent or guardian note Only 2 Ten and above Student illness (Note: to be deemed excused, an appropriately licensed medical professional must verify all student illness absences, regardless of the absence’s length).\n\n1. Student’s observance of a religious holiday.\n\n2. Death in the student’s family or other emergency beyond the control of the student’s family.\n\n3. Mandated court appearances (additional documentation required).\n\n4. The lack of transportation that is normally provided by a district other than the one the student attends (documentation from parent/guardian is not required for this reason).\n\n5.* Extraordinary educational opportunities pre-approved by district administrators. Parent or guardian note and in some cases additional documentation (see details of specific reason).\n\n*Note: The total number of days absent includes both excused and unexcused absences\n\nIt is important to note that while the first nine absences in a school year can be deemed excused for any reason the parent/guardian or guardian provides, the 10th and each subsequent absence establish a more stringent and specific set of reasons for the absence to qualify as excused. The flowchart below offers a visual tool to help determine if an absence is excused or unexcused.\n\nIn cases where a student’s extended absence crosses levels, the rules should be applied as if there were two separate absences, one under Level 1 and the other under Level 2. For example, if a student is absent for five days on a family vacation and those absences represent numbers seven through 11, absences seven, eight, and nine would fall under Level 1 rules and can be accepted as excused; absences 10 and 11 would fall under Level 2 rules and would not be considered excused.Parent or guardian notes and other documentation are central to determining whether a student’s absence is excused or unexcused. While a note from a parent/guardian or guardian will likely be the most common form of documentation, other methods of reporting a student’s absence are acceptable. For example, a parent/guardian or guardian can report the student’s absence in person to an authorized school official, such as an attendance clerk. Certain types of absences in Level 2 require additional documentation or verification. Absences due to student illnesses and mandated court appearances require this additional information once the student has accrued more than nine absences (entered Level 2). For students in Level 1, these additional requirements do not apply. For absences due to student illness, Level 2 students must either provide a signed note from a medical professional who has evaluated the student confirming the absence and giving an expected return date or have his or her school nurse verify the student’s absence with the medical professional treating the student. The medical professional who is treating the student can be the school nurse at the student’s school\n\nEmergencies\n\nOne of the acceptable reasons for a Level 2 student to be absent is a death in the family or other emergency beyond the control of the family. For the purposes of the definition of excused absences, emergencies are generally significant events that are outside of the control of the student’s family. They are normally short absences consisting of a few days at most.\n\nExamples of emergencies include:\n\n● family member who is very ill and close to dying;\n\n● student’s home is lost to fire or eviction;\n\n● family’s home being quarantined;\n\n● natural disaster;\n\n● a student who is a parent/guardian and whose child needs to go to the hospital; or\n\n● a family member’s military deployment or return from deployment.\n\nSome unexpected absences will not qualify as an emergency. These include:\n\n● staying home to meet the plumber or other tradesman;\n\n● routine child care of a younger child by the student; or\n\n● opportunity to work an extra shift at an afterschool job.\n\nExtended absences would be considered an emergency only under extreme circumstances. For example, if an order of the community health department quarantined a family’s home for an extended period, such quarantine would be an extended emergency.\n\nAbsences due to family emergencies do not require additional documentation. A note from a parent/guardian explaining the emergency received within 10 school days is sufficient, but it is essential that the note explain the emergency so school staff can evaluate if the situation was indeed an emergency.\n\nExtraordinary Educational Opportunities\n\nFrom time to time, students encounter an exceptional opportunity for an experience of an educational nature. While these events may not be part of their schoolwork, they provide an excellent chance to further their education. Under certain circumstances, the days devoted to these opportunities can count as excused absences for Level 2 students.\n\nTo qualify as an extraordinary educational opportunity, it must meet the following criteria:\n\na. The opportunity must be educational in nature. It must have a learning objective related to the student’s course work or plan of study. Not all memorable and/or life experiences would be considered educational and, therefore, would not be available for this exemption.\n\nb. It must be an opportunity not ordinarily available to the student.\n\nc. It must be grade and developmentally appropriate.\n\nd. The content of the experience must be highly relevant to the student. While some opportunities will be relevant to all students, others will contain very specific content that would limit their relevance to a smaller group of students. For example, a trumpet lesson from jazz great Wynton Marsalis would be very relevant to students who play trumpet, but not to others who do not play trumpet.\n\n*Note: Criteria c) and d) above may mean that an exceptional educational opportunity exemption may be approved for one family member but not another attending the same event/opportunity. Some examples of extraordinary educational opportunities include:\n\n● the opportunity to meet the president of the United States or a foreign head of state; or\n\n● a behind the scenes tour of the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nSome examples of activities that do not qualify as extraordinary educational opportunities include:\n\n● family vacations; or\n\n● going to a concert of a favorite pop star.\n\nBest Practices for Extraordinary Educational Opportunities\n\nIt is important that the school, the student, and the student’s family all have a common understanding of the opportunity that is being requested and approved. To that end, the Department suggests that schools include the following elements in their plans and procedures for approving extraordinary educational opportunities:\n\na) Requests: All requests for approval of exceptional educational opportunities should be submitted in writing, bear the signature of the student and his or her parent/guardian or guardian, outline the learning objective of the opportunity, and detail how the objective is linked to the student’s coursework or plan of study, include additional documentation (where available), and be submitted prior to the opportunity.\n\nb) Approvals: All approvals for opportunities should:\n\n● be in written form;\n\n● detail any requirements placed upon the student as a condition of approval; Connecticut State Department of Education, April 2013\n\n● include the specific days approved for the opportunities; and\n\n● include in the approval the caveat that the administration may withdraw its approval if the opportunity is canceled or the student fails to meet the mutually agreed on requirements of the approval.\n\nc) Requirement to share: Schools should expect students to share their experience with other students and/or staff when they return. This will benefit the larger school community.\n\nd) Approval not assured: Schools should inform parents/guardians that approvals are awarded on a case-by-case basis, are based on a number of factors, and that opportunities approved for one student may not be approved for another.\n\nExplanation of the Attendance Policy\n\nA Statement of Belief\n\nIt is our belief that there is a clear and positive correlation between student learning and consistent and prompt attendance in class. Much of what is presented in courses is sequential. Therefore, learning requires a continuity of attendance and effort. We also strongly believe that what occurs in class is vital to student learning. The richness of class discussions, the exchange of ideas with peers and teachers, the opportunity to defend one’s ideas, the viewing of films and videos mean that even if students make up the missed work, they have forever lost an opportunity for increased learning and skill development. In addition, a great deal of work in class is done cooperatively and a lack of attendance makes it difficult, if not impossible, for peers to successfully complete the work required. Lack of consistent attendance means that students will not get the full benefit of the courses offered at Staples High School and thus attendance should be and will be a significant factor in the determination of a student’s grade as determined by the individual teacher.\n\nPlease take into account the TOTAL number of days your child has missed a class or classes due to very legitimate reasons such as: driver’s license appointment, college visits, medical appointments, field trips, in-school field trips, etc. Mixed with illness and other unavoidable absences, the number of days out of class can interfere with learning.\n\nPurpose of the Attendance Policy\n\nThe purpose of the Staples High School Attendance Policy reflects our desire to have each student attend all classes and arrive on time. Students and parents/guardians should familiarize themselves with the provisions and procedures of the policy. It is expected that parents/guardians will support the intent of the policy and encourage their children to have good attendance. The SHS Attendance Policy has been approved by the Board of Education and reviewed by the attorney for the Board of Education. Any questions should be directed to the administrators responsible for attendance.\n\nThe Attendance Policy\n\nThe number of absences permitted for each course before credit is lost is listed below:\n\n● Full-year course: 20 absences\n\n● Semester course: 10 absences\n\n● Quarter course: 5 absences\n\n● Special courses (other than above): Prorate absences\n\nAbsences beyond this number will result in loss of credit for the course or courses in which the student has been absent. For seniors, loss of credit in a course may result in failure to meet graduation requirements.\n\n● A LOSS OF CREDIT MAY OCCUR THROUGH THE ACCUMULATION OF ABSENCES FROM ANY ONE OF THE FOUR TYPES OF ABSENCES LISTED BELOW, OR THROUGH ANY COMBINATION OF THE FOUR TYPES OF ABSENCES.\n\n● EACH TYPE OF ABSENCE IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IN ITS CONTRIBUTION TOWARD REACHING THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE ABSENCES IN A COURSE.\n\n1) Excused Absences: (equals ONE absence per occasion)\n\n● Student illness\n\n● Death or critical illness in the family\n\n● Response to a legal process\n\n● Medical appointment (which cannot be scheduled outside of the school day)\n\n● College visit beyond two (juniors and seniors only)\n\n● Early dismissal or late arrival for other than school related activities\n\n● An absence deemed “excused” by the administrator responsible for the student\n\n● A verified visit to the Guidance Office to meet with a college representative. Juniors missing class to meet with a college rep will be charged with an unexcused absence.\n\n2) Unexcused Absences: (equals ONE absences per occasion)\n\n● All absences not identified above are considered UNEXCUSED\n\n● Absences that are not explained by a Pre-Planned Absence form, a note and/or a telephone call from a parent/guardian within 48 hours after the student’s return to school from an absence, are considered UNEXCUSED.\n\n● An absence deemed “unexcused” by the administrator responsible for the student. A teacher may determine if makeup work is allowed for class periods where a student has accrued an unexcused absence.\n\n3) Unexcused Tardy: (equals .25 absence per occasion)\n\n● Occurs when a student arrives up to 10 minutes late for class without authorization 4) Unexcused Late: (equals .50 absence per occasion)\n\n● Occurs when a student arrives to class later than 10 minutes without authorization, but less than half way through the class.\n\n● Students arriving more than halfway through the class without authorization will be considered absent.\n\nAbsences which do not count towards the loss of credit include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n\n● School related activities\n\n● Suspensions: in-school or out-of-school\n\n● Homebound instruction\n\n● “Special” absences\n\n◊ Class meetings\n\n◊ Field trips\n\n◊ Sports or other school approved extracurricular activities\n\n◊ Scheduled office and guidance appointments - Normally, scheduled office and guidance appointments should occur during non-class time.\n\n● Religious Observance\n\n● For Juniors and Seniors ONLY: 2 days for college visits. Students must fill out a Pre Planned Absence form available in the Assistant Principals’ Office prior to going on a college visit. Failure to do so will result in the visit being counted as an absence.\n\nCommunications from Parents/Guardians\n\n● It is the responsibility of parents/guardians to communicate to the school the reason for all absences.\n\n● Parent notes or telephone calls to excuse an absence must be received no later than 48 hours following the student’s return to school, or the absence will be classified as unexcused. All students, please call the Assistant Principals’ Office 24 hour Attendance Number (203) 341-1281. ● Parent notes to request an early dismissal must be presented to the attendance office before the student is dismissed in order for dismissal to be considered excused.\n\n● Provide medical documentation for long-term absences, to include the nature of the illness, any limitations on the student, inclusive dates of medical condition, specific dates of absence covered.\n\nContent of Parent Notes\n\nAll parent/guardian notes for any reason must include the following:\n\n(1) the student’s name,\n\n(2) the date(s) of the absence(s),\n\n(3) the specific reason for the absence, lateness or dismissal,\n\n(4) the signature of the parent/guardian\n\n(5) a daytime phone number where a parent/guardian can be reached to verify the note.\n\n“Blanket” notes covering unspecified dates of absences, tardies, etc. are not acceptable. (for example: “Please excuse my child from all absences in the months of April and May due to illness.”)\n\nCommunications to Students and Parents\n\nStudents and parents/guardians will be notified concerning absences by mail utilizing the following letters:\n\n● Students and parents/guardians will have access to information concerning attendance via Powerschool .\n\n● Excessive Absence Notification Letter: generated when one-half of the number of permitted absences has been accumulated in a class. The purpose of this notification is to inform the parent/guardian and the student of the possibility of loss of credit if the student’s attendance does not improve.\n\n● Loss of Credit Letter: generated when a student loses credit in any course.\n\n● Appeals Board Hearing Results Notification: used to communicate the decision of the Appeals Board to the student and parent/guardian when a student appeals a loss of credit.\n\nAnticipated Absences\n\nAny anticipated absence, such as college visitations, family vacations, etc., which conflict with the school calendar, must be arranged in advance by a phone call or a Pre-Planned Absence form or the absence will be considered unexcused and make-up privileges will be forfeited.\n\nDismissal During the School Day\n\nOnce students have reported to school, they are expected to remain in school and attend classes all day. Under the following conditions, a student may have an excused dismissal:\n\nUnder rare or emergency circumstances, a written request from a parent/guardian must be presented or a phone call must be received by the Assistant Principals’ Office and/or Attendance Office prior to dismissal. A parent/guardian may come to the attendance office and personally request dismissal.\n\na. The student must sign out at the Front Desk.. If the student returns to school, the student must sign in at the Front Desk to verify the time of his/her return and provide appropriate documentation.\n\nb. Students returning from any type of outside of school appointment: doctor etc., must present a note upon return from the appropriate office to the Front Desk.\n\nFailure to meet the above two conditions will cause any class absences to be considered unexcused. Such absences will be counted towards loss of credit and make-up privileges will be forfeited.\n\nIllness in School\n\n● In case of illness while in school, the student must report to the health office.\n\n● The nurse, with parental/guardian permission, will make the decision to dismiss the student from school.\n\n● Once the nurse has obtained permission from the parent/guardian to dismiss the student, the student will be issued a dismissal pass.\n\n● Students who become ill in school and report to areas other than the nurse’s office (cafeteria, restrooms, off campus) will be considered “unexcused” and may face disciplinary action.\n\nAppointments with Staples High School Staff\n\n● Upon arrival for an appointment, it is the student’s obligation to immediately inform the counselor, Assistant Principal, etc. if a test or major graded assignment is planned for that period.\n\n● The student should then request that the appointment be rescheduled.\n\n● Failure to do so will result in the absence being considered unexcused.\n\n● Such an absence will count towards loss of credit and make-up privileges will be forfeited.\n\nMonitor the number of absences in each class\n\n● Throughout the school year, it is the responsibility of the student and parent/guardian(s) to monitor closely the number of absences, which have accumulated in each course.\n\n● When a student anticipates an absence from school or from a particular class for any reason, it is very important that the student and the parent/guardian consider carefully the necessity of the absence, taking into consideration the current number of accumulated absences and their potential impact on loss of credit in the course.\n\nCertification of Chronic Illness\n\n● During an appeal for reinstatement of credit, the Appeals Board may request confirmation from a doctor to explain specific and frequent absences, which occurred due to medical reasons.\n\n● Students and parents/guardians are advised to monitor the number of absences, which have accumulated because of medical reasons.\n\n● When absences for medical reasons are frequent, it may be advisable to seek documentation from a doctor that a chronic illness exists.\n\n● Presentation of verified information regarding chronic illness and specific dates of absence will strengthen a student’s case in an appeal for reinstatement of credit.\n\n● Just as with parent/guardian notes, doctor’s notes need to specifically address dates of absences, and may not be “blanket excuses” for all absences which have occurred over a period of time. Such information must be presented on going and not at the end of a course.\n\nLoss of Credit\n\n● A student will lose credit in a course when the number of accumulated absences exceeds the number of permitted absences.\n\n● The student will be instructed to attend class, and the procedure to appeal the loss of credit will be explained.\n\n● When credit is lost, the student is expected to attend the class. In addition, consistent attendance following loss of credit strengthens a student’s appeals case.\n\n● A letter grade will appear on the transcript even though credit is lost. All courses require a passing grade for the student to move to the next level.\n\nExcessive “Class Cutting” following Loss of Credit\n\nStudents, who flagrantly disregard the intent of the Staples High School Attendance Policy and continue to cut a class(es) after loss of credit, may be removed from that class with a final grade of Withdrawn Failure (WF). The administrator responsible for the student, after consultation with the teacher, will determine under what circumstances this action will be taken.\n\nRight of Appeal\n\nThe Attendance Policy is not designed to deny credit to students who, through no fault of their own, were unable to attend school or a class due to a legitimate illness or other condition beyond the student’s/parents’/guardians’ control. In January and June, students who have lost credit will have an opportunity to appeal to have credit reinstated. A student’s decision to appeal must take into consideration the student’s total attendance record. Any absences, other than excused absences will weaken the student’s appeal. Absences which remain unexcused and undocumented as well as chronic absences will also weaken the student’s appeal. Students wishing to appeal must follow the appeals procedure. If students do not have valid reasons for appealing loss of credit, they should contact their counselor to identify what options are available.\n\nThe Appeals Board\n\n● Composed of four teachers and the administrator responsible for the student.\n\n● Hears the student’s case and makes a decision on whether to reinstate credit.\n\n● An Appeals Board decision is final.\n\n● The decision will only be reviewed by the Principal as a result of the introduction of additional information, which was NOT presented to the Appeals Board.\n\n● A request for review must state the intention of the review, and any new evidence in a written statement by the student and the parent/guardian(s).\n\n● Students wishing to appeal to the Principal must do so within two (2) school days following the receipt of the decision of the Appeals Board.\n\n● A student must appear in person before the Appeals Board. Failure to do so will be an automatic denial of restoration of credit.\n\n“Fast Track” Appeals\n\nUnder extremely rare and narrowly defined circumstances, a student who lost credit in one or more courses may not have to appear before the Attendance Appeals Committee to appeal the loss of credit. Instead, the assistant principal will appeal the student’s loss of credit directly to the principal for adjudication. The assistant principal uses the following criteria, along with input from the guidance and/or pupil services staff, in determining which students to “fast-track”:\n\n(a) documented illness\n\n(b) total amount of absences barely exceeds the total number of absences required to lose credit.\n\n(c) teacher recommendation\n\nAll absences are excused, with the vast majority of absences being caused by documented illness or condition that was beyond the control of the student.\n\nThe total amount of absences in a particular course barely exceeds the total number of absences required to lose credit\n\nStaples encourages its students to participate in the various extracurricular activities offered. Such participation assures the student’s emotional well being, while discovering new talents and developing the whole person.\n\nStudents must be in school for at least 4 hours or they may not participate/perform in any activity that is considered extracurricular. Extracurricular activities are any activity that takes place outside of the classroom for the purpose of enrichment, entertainment or sports. Examples of such activities may include but are not limited to: athletic events, in-school field trips, out of school field trips, performances (plays, concerts, radio show, talent/variety shows, etc.) and school sponsored evening events.\n\nAthletics and Intramurals\n\nPurpose: The purpose of the athletic program is to encourage boys and girls to develop mutual interests, promote motivations and improve their physical skills. Athletic contests involve considerable time for practices, games, strenuous physical effort and student travel. Each sport is a learning experience, and, as such, entails numerous responsibilities. Students who try out for any sport should be aware of these responsibilities and be willing to assume them.\n\nThe coaching staff must authorize overnight get-togethers. Athletic and club initiation rights practices connected with clubs or athletics are expressly prohibited by the school.\n\nEligibility:\n\nYou are NOT ELIGIBLE:\n\n1. If you are not taking at least six (6) (grades 10-12) and seven (7) (grade 9) units of work or the equivalent;\n\n2. If you have not passed at least four (4) units or the equivalent at the end of the last regular marking period, with the exception of fall eligibility.* (Rule I.A.)\n\n3. If you are nineteen (19) years of age before September 1; (Rule II.B.)\n\n4. If you have changed schools without a change of legal residence; (Rule II.C. See complete Rule II.C. See complete Rule of exceptions.)\n\n5. If you have played the same sport for more than three (3) seasons in grades 10, 11, and 12; (Rule II.B.)\n\n6. If you play or practice with an outside team in the same sport while a member of the school team after the first scheduled game in any season; (Rule II.E.)\n\nThe exception to Rule II.E. shall be:\n\na. Participation in parent/guardian-child tournaments.\n\nb. Swimming, tennis, gymnastics – a pupil may practice but not compete with a non-CIAC team during the season.\n\n7. If you play under an assumed name on an outside team; (Rule II.F.)\n\n8. If you receive personal economic gain for participation in any CIAC sport. *For fall sports – student must be a continuing student (eighth grade to ninth grade) or have received credit for four (4) units or its equivalent towards graduation at the conclusion of the school year preceding the contest. (Rule I.A.)\n\nNOTE: Marking period grades (not semester grades) are to be used in determining scholastic eligibility, except for fall eligibility. You may consult your Principal or Athletic Director for other rules af ecting athletic eligibility.\n\nHealth Requirements for Athletic Participation\n\nTo participate in any sport, including tryouts, a student must have on file in the Nurse’s Office:\n\nHAR 3 Annual health history and physical examination (blue form)\n\nForm C SHS Athletic Emergency Information (two part form) to be verified by the nurses’ office staff\n\nStudent and Parent Concussion Informed Consent Form\n\nSudden Cardiac Arrest Awareness Form\n\nForms are available in Athletics, Nurse’s Office at Staples, and online – https://www.westportps.org/uploaded/site_files/www/health/HAR-2018.pdf.\n\nC.I.A.C. Regulations\n\nThe Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference governs all competitive sports of member schools. The following is a partial list of its regulations:\n\n● An Athlete shall not have reached her/his 19 th birthday prior to September 1 of the current year.\n\n● An athlete shall have passed four (4) academic credits or the equivalent at the end of the last regular marking period and must be carrying at least four (4) academic credits in the current year. She/he must also satisfy any local eligibility requirements.\n\n● An athlete may not participate on any organized outside sports team in which she/he will compete in school during the school season.\n\n● All Games in which an ineligible player competes shall be counted as defeats for her/his team, regardless of the true results. Incoming Transfer Students: Upon entering Staples High School from another academic institution, Physical Education credit will not be awarded for any interscholastic athletics or extracurricular activities. Once a student is enrolled in Staples High School, they will be expected to complete the Physical Education and Health curriculum and graduation requirements from their point of entry. Questionable circumstances will be reviewed by the Director of Guidance and the Department Chair of Physical Education and Health to determine whether or not the student transcript satisfies any or all of the Staples Physical Education graduation requirements.\n\nAthletic Handbook - http://files.leagueathletics.com/Images/Club/21258/ATH%20with%20Stafford%20s%20Letter.pdf\n\nParticipation is a privilege:\n\nIn order to participate in all extra-curricular activities, students must exemplify good citizenship. Participation in such activities is a privilege not a right. Violation of the school’s Code of Conduct regarding the use of drugs or alcohol will impact that privilege. In addition to receiving the disciplinary consequences as discussed in the Code of Conduct, violators of school rules may become ineligible to participate in all extra-curricular and school sponsored activities. A school sponsored activity includes, but is not limited to a prom, a graduation ceremony, an athletic event, and homecoming.\n\nAthletic and club initiation rights, practices connected with clubs or athletics, are expressly prohibited by the school.\n\nViolations of the Athletic Standards:\n\nViolations will be treated with consideration for the individual, the team, the school and the family. Penalties for violations may involve temporary suspension, permanent suspension for the remainder of the current season or year, ineligibility for future teams and/or the cancellation of awards, and will be gone for a season, quarter, semester, year – whatever is warranted.\n\nInterscholastic Awards:\n\nAll teams, unless otherwise noted, participate in FCIAC (Fairfield County Interscholastic Athletic Conference) and CIAC (Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference) competition.\n\nPhysical Education Class Participation Policy For Athletes:\n\nAll athletes taking Physical Education during their season of performance on a team must have a change of clothing and participate in class activities.\n\nNo athlete is excused from Physical Education even on the day of a game. That includes Varsity, J.V., Sophomore and Freshman teams along with Cheerleaders.\n\nNational Honor Society Membership Requirements\n\nA student must exhibit and demonstrate all of the following qualities:\n\n1. Scholarship: Maintain an Academic/Weighted GPA of 3.90.\n\n2. Character: Possessing the attributes of responsibility, good conduct, initiative, and desirable qualities of behavior, as assessed by the entire faculty.\n\n3. Leadership; actively participating in clubs and activities and viewed as a leader, helping others, being active in discussions, etc.\n\n4. Service: Rendering his/her service in and or out of school, having completed a minimum of 30 hours during the school year.\n\nStudents will be initially considered for membership if they meet the GPA requirement and the character assessment by the faculty. It is important to understand that students do not “apply” for membership in the National Honor Society, but rather they are selected by the faculty. As part of the selection process, students will be required to prove their leadership and service commitments. All information ascertained about students will be verified and will remain confidential. It is recognized here that the selection process contains both objective and subjective assessments.\n\nA faculty council appointed by the principal annually is responsible for implementing the National Honor society selection process. Student selection will be made by a majority vote of the council.\n\nNational Language Honor Societies\n\nMember selection and induction at Staples High School will take place during the Spring semester of each year. See the World Languages Coordinator for the specific requirements for French, German, Latin, Spanish, Italian, and Mandarin Chinese.\n\nStudents unable to participate in Physical Education due to a medical issue:\n\nStaples Physical Education Medical Excuse Policy\n\nA. A student with an illness or injury which may require exclusion from physical education classes for more than 3 classes which may result in a loss of credit for a quarter course must:\n\n● Present written documentation from his/her health care provider preferably using the Staples Physical Activity Restriction form that can be obtained from the school nurse and/or the Staples High School website under the student services-health services tab. Documentation must be completed to indicate the reason for exclusion from physical activity and the physical activities the student is restricted from participating in.\n\n● Upon receipt of medical documentation, the school nurse will issue the student a pass to be excluded from physical education until further notice and/or as specified by the student’s health care provider. The school nurse will notify the student’s physical education teacher, guidance counselor and Physical Education/Health Department Chairperson of the restrictions and potential timeline for the restrictions.\n\nB. The physical education teacher in consultation with the school nurse will:\n\n● Keep the student in class for modified participation in the physical education class to tolerance per the direction of the nurse/health care provider.\n\n● Allow the student to stay and observe class instruction and participate where appropriate when there is a strong possibility that the student will not miss more than 10 days of instruction or the student’s safety and well-being is not in jeopardy while in attendance.\n\nOR\n\nC. In cases where extended illness and/or extended injury will require a student to miss more than 10 days of class:\n\n● The student will be assigned to an academic study hall by their guidance counselor in lieu of attending his/her physical education class. This decision will be made after consultation with the school nurse, physical education teacher, and Physical Education Department Chairperson.\n\n● The student may be assigned to one quarter of health class if possible in lieu of his/her physical education class if the extended injury/illness were to occur at the outset of a new quarter. Students will not be permitted to add health beyond 3 days of the new quarter.\n\n● If the student would like to earn the opportunity to receive the .25 course credit for the physical education class for the quarter in which the extended illness or injury occurs, the student will meet with his/her physical education teacher to develop an alternative project in lieu of class participation that could be in the form of an independent study project or research paper for which they will be graded. It is the student’s responsibility to meet with his/her physical education teacher to collaboratively develop an alternative to attending class. Prior to departmental approval, both parent/guardian and student must confirm in writing on the Staples Physical Activity Restriction form that they acknowledge that it is the student’s responsibility to initiate the proposal and meet the departmental requirements established in the alternative plan. Final approval of all alternative to class participation projects/plans will be made by the Physical Education/Health Department Chairperson. Alternative assignments must be completed by the end of the quarter in which the extended injury or illness occurred. Any exceptions to the deadline will only be granted by the Physical Education/Health Department Chairperson with consultation of the school nurse. The student will be graded on a pass/fail basis.\n\n● In the event the student’s physical activity restrictions extend into a new school quarter, the Staples Physical Activity Restriction form must be completed again for the quarter that the student is restricted. The student/parent/guardian must request the school nurse for a continuation of a medically excused pass for the new quarter as directed by his/her health care provider and the aforementioned policy will be adhered to for the new quarter.\n\n● Students who have an extended illness or injury that require them to miss more than 10 days of class and select not to participate in the alternative, independent project, and/or do not satisfactorily meet the departmental guidelines authorized for the alternative project will have to make up the physical education class in a subsequent quarter(s) following the student’s extended illness or injury.\n\n● Students who have a recurring illness and/or injury that causes them to miss more than 10 days, albeit non-consecutive days of participation in class will be required to complete an alternative to class participation project. Students who are still able to participate in more than half of the classes will be eligible to receive a grade and credit for the course. Students who are unable to participate in half of the classes will be eligible to receive credit for the class after successful completion of the alternative project and the grade for the course will be issued on a pass/fail basis.\n\nSchool Nurses\n\nStaples High School has a health services team of 3 nurses and a health assistant. The purpose of our students’ health services program is to support student learning and success. Individualized health services are provided for students who have acute and chronic health and mental health conditions.\n\nCommunicating with a School Nurse Regarding a Student’s Health\n\nPlease alert the school nurse if your child has a health condition that may require individualized planning for safety, emergency care, health care services, or evacuation.\n\nThe school nurse should be notified of changes in the student health status and of illness, injury, hospitalization or a change in treatment or medication.\n\n● Parents/guardians should call the school attendance office, 341-1281, when their child is absent due to illness or injury.\n\n● A doctor’s note is required to excuse a student from gym for more than three days.\n\n● A doctor’s note is also required to resume participation after an injury when gym has been excused by a physician.\n\n● Parents/guardians should consult the school nurse immediately if they anticipate that their child may be absent for medical reasons for more than three days. The school nurse will obtain the necessary medical information and initiate the process for school/team decision-making and planning, as indicated. Please contact the school nurse in advance of an absence of more than three days, if possible, or in an emergency, quickly thereafter.\n\nStudents with Special Healthcare Needs\n\nWestport Public Schools are committed to ensuring that students who have special health care needs due to chronic and acute health conditions receive the supports and services necessary to remain safe and, to the extent possible, maintain their baseline health status during school.\n\n“Students with special health care needs” refers to those students who have medically diagnosed chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, life-threatening food allergies, cardiac abnormality, juvenile arthritis, celiac disease, migraine headaches, seizures, or a significant acute illness or injury requiring treatment and a period of recovery, such as concussion, mononucleosis, Lyme disease, or fractured arm or leg. For students with such conditions, the school team collaborates with the family and student’s health care provider to identify school-based needs and develop an appropriate plan of care to meet those needs. That plan is called an “individualized health care plan” (IHCP). For students at high risk for a health or safety emergency in school, an “individualized emergency care plan” (ICEP) is developed as a part of the IHCP. Some students may also require an “individualized transportation plan” (ITP) as part of the IHCP. Parents who have a child with special health care needs are encouraged to speak with the school nurse regarding the appropriateness and process for developing an IHCP. These plans may be incorporated into a student’s individualized special education program (IEP) or Section 504 plan if eligible.\n\n(Physical Education)\n\nIn accordance with Connecticut General Statutes, Section 10-206, the Westport Board of Education requires each ninth grade student to have a health assessment during the ninth-grade year. This mandated health assessment must be performed anytime from June 1 st of a student’s eighth-grade year through June 30th of the ninth-grade year, and must be performed by a legally qualified practitioner of medicine (M.D. or D.O.) who is licensed in this or another state, or by a qualified registered nurse or advanced practice registered nurse or physician assistant licensed to practice in this state. Ninth grade students who do not comply with this requirement will not be allowed to attend school in the 10th grade.\n\nThe health assessment must be documented on the State Department of Education’s required health assessment record (HAR-3) or “blue form,” and must include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Review and update of state-mandated immunizations to ensure compliance with requirements (obtain information from the health office).\n\n2. Hemoglobin or hematocrit, blood pressure, height and weight, vision, hearing, speech, postural and gross dental screenings;\n\n3. Risk assessment for tuberculosis. If the student is in a high-risk group, a Mantoux test for tuberculosis sensitivity must be administered and the test results must be documented on the form;\n\n4. Chronic disease assessment (newly added to the HAR-4 2012 form).\n\nIf a parent/guardian or legal guardian (or student who is 18 years old or an emancipated minor) objects on religious grounds to:\n\n● the state-mandated health assessment, a signed statement to that effect must be submitted to the school nurse by May 15 th of the ninth grade year if a signed statement is not already in the student’s record.\n\n● immunizations, a signed copy of the Immunization Exemptions and Exclusions-From-School form must be already on file or submitted to the school nurse along with complete HAR-3 form.\n\nIf a mandated immunization is contraindicated for medical reasons, a written statement from the health care provider, including the reason for continued deferment, must be submitted to the school nurse along with the completed HAR-3 form.\n\nThe HAR-3 form is reviewed by the school nurse and filed in the student’s confidential school health record. If you have questions or confidentiality concerns, please speak with the school nurse.\n\nScreenings: School nurses provide the following screenings for high school students, as required by CT General Statutes, Section 10-214 if not already screened by a legally qualified practitioner of medicine.\n\nVision: Students in Grade 9\n\nScoliosis: Students in Grade 9\n\nThe parent/guardians/guardians of students who need further evaluation by a physician will be notified. Parents should return the referral form to the school nurse after it has been completed by a physician. Please notify the school nurse if you do not wish your child to participate in these screenings.]\n\nLeaving School Because of Illness\n\nThe school nurse will ask a parent/guardian/guardian to pick up any student who becomes ill during school hours or who has an illness or injury that, in the professional judgment of the school nurse, needs to be observed at home or assessed by a medical doctor.\n\nStudents must not leave school because of illness without authorization, and must be signed out by a parent/guardian.\n\nEmergencies\n\n9-1-1 will be called in a health or mental health emergency for immediate transportation of a student to the hospital.\n\nStaying Home Due to Illness\n\nTo safeguard the health of all students, we ask parents/guardians to monitor their children for possible communicable diseases and to keep their children home when they are ill or contagious.\n\nStudent Medication\n\nFor students who must take medication during school hours, including medication prescribed by a physician for short-term use (e.g., antibiotics, daily medication, medication needed only occasionally, over-the-counter medication, and medication for emergencies such as Epipens and inhalers) parent/guardians/guardians must provide the school nurse with written permission and the written medical order of an authorized prescriber (physician, dentist, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician’s assistant) authorizing the nurse to administer the medication. The permission and order must be in writing on Westport Public Schools’ medication form and must include:\n\n● Name, strength, and dosage of the prescribed medication;\n\n● Reason for the medication (medical diagnosis);\n\n● Directions for administering the medication;\n\n● Time the medication is to be administered;\n\n● Duration of the order;\n\n● Potential side and untoward effect;\n\n● Authorization for self-administration, if appropriate.\n\nMedication forms are available in the nurse’s office and on the school website. Medication must be delivered to the school nurse by a responsible adult. Do not send any medication to the school with a student. The medication must be in its original container, clearly labeled with the student’s name, authorized prescriber’s name, prescription number, the date it was ordered, the name of the medication, its strength, and directions for administering the prescription The nurse cannot keep more than 90 days’ supply of medication at the school at any one time. Parents should notify the nurse concerning any changes in the prescribed dosage. A new form is required annually.\n\nThe parent/guardian or a responsible adult must pick up unused medication within one week of its completion or by the last day of school, or it will be disposed of by the school nurse.\n\nSelf-Administration of Medication\n\nHigh school students are not permitted to carry any medication in school, (including over-the-counter drugs), unless they have the written authorization of the student’s physician, parent/guardian/guardian and school nurse to self-administer rescue medications, such as EpiPens and asthma inhalers. Such medication should also be available in the nurse’s office as a backup in case of a medical emergency. Self-administration of other non-controlled drugs may be approved depending on the circumstances. A medication plan for self-administration must be developed and on file in the health office before a student may carry his or her own medication. Students found with any medication, over-the-counter or prescription, without a self-administration plan in place are subject to disciplinary action. Students who have a self-administration plan to carry their own rescue medications must keep them on or with their person at all times. It is not safe or appropriate to leave them in a locker or car.\n\nMedication on Field Trips\n\nThe same state regulations and school policies apply to medication on field trips as in school during the school day. Students who have a self-administration plan must carry their own medication on a field trip, just as they do during the school day. These requirements include over-the-counter medications. It is best to speak with the school nurse well in advance of a field trip to make sure that your child will have access to appropriate medication and assistance, if needed, during a field trip.\n\nMedical Clearance for Sports Eligibility\n\nStudent athletes must have a yearly physical CHAR-3BLUE FORM to be eligible for sports participation. All physicals must be delivered to the nurses’ office prior to sports tryouts. Please contact nurses’ office with questions.\n\nThe Westport Board of Education is dedicated to promoting and maintaining a positive learning environment where all students are welcomed, supported, and feel socially, emotionally, intellectually and physically safe in school.\n\nA. Bullying is prohibited on school grounds, at a school-sponsored or school- related activity, function or program whether on or off school grounds, at a school bus stop, on a school bus or other vehicle owned, leased, or used by a local or regional board of education, or through the use of an electronic device or an electronic mobile device owned, leased, or used by the local or regional Board of Education.\n\nB. Bullying is also prohibited outside of the school setting if such bullying results in the following:\n\n● creates a hostile environment at school for the student against whom such bullying was directed\n\n● infringes on the rights of the student against whom such bullying was directed at school\n\n● substantially disrupts the education process or the orderly operation of a school\n\nC. Any form of discrimination and retaliation against an individual who reports or assist in the investigation of an act of bullying is strictly prohibited. If acts of bullying are verified, disciplinary action may be taken against the perpetrator, consistent with his/her rights of due process.\n\nIn accordance with state law, it is the policy of the Board of Education that any form of bullying behavior, whether in the classroom, on school property or at school-sponsored events, is expressly forbidden.\n\nStudents who engage in bullying behavior shall be subject to school discipline up to and including expulsion in accordance with the Board’s policy on student discipline.\n\nThe detailed Board Policy and Administrative regulations can be accessed online at: http://www.westportps.org/behave.htm\n\nDEFINITIONS USED IN THE CODE OF CONDUCT:\n\nA. “Bullying” means\n\n(1) the repeated use by one or more students of a written, oral, or electronic communication, such as cyber-bullying, directed at or referring to another student attending school in the same school district, or\n\n(2) a physical act or gesture by one or more students repeatedly directed at another student attending school in the same school district, that:\n\n(a) Causes physical or emotional harm to such student or damage to such student’s property,\n\n(b) Places such student in reasonable fear of harm to himself or herself, or of damage to his or her property,\n\n(d) Infringes on the rights of such student at school, or\n\n(e) Substantially disrupts the education process or the orderly operation of a school. Bullying shall include, but not be limited to, a written, oral, or electronic communication or physical gesture based on any actual or perceived differentiating characteristic, such as race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, socioeconomic status, academic status, physical appearance, or mental, physical, developmental, or sensory disability, or by association with an individual or group who has or is perceived to have one or more of such characteristics.\n\nB. “Cyberbullying” means any act of bullying through the use of the Internet, interactive and digital technologies, cellular mobile telephone or other mobile devices or any electronic communications.\n\nC. “Mobile electronic device” means any hand-held or other portable electronic equipment capable of providing data communication between two or more individuals, including, but not limited to, a text messaging device, a paging device, a personal digital assistant, a laptop computer, equipment that is capable of playing a video game or a digital video disk, any piece of technology with internet capability or equipment on which digital images are taken or transmitted.\n\nD. “Electronic communication” means any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photo-electronic, or photo-optical system.\n\nE. “Hostile environment” means a situation in which bullying among students is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the school climate.\n\nF. “Out of the school setting” means at a location, activity, or program that is not school related, or through the use of an electronic device or a mobile electronic device that is not owned, leased or used by a local or regional board of education.\n\n● For purposes of this policy, “school-sponsored activity” shall mean any activity conducted on or off school property (including school buses and other school-related vehicles) that is sponsored by the Board of Education.\n\nLEGAL REFERENCES:\n\n● Public Act No.02-119 AND 06-115\n\n● Connecticut General Statutes Sections 10-233a through 10-233f\n\nAdministrative Procedures The district’s commitment to addressing bullying behavior involves the promotion of a school atmosphere in which bullying will not be tolerated by students or staff. Students who are determined to have engaged in such behavior are subject to disciplinary action, in accordance with school system policies on student conduct and discipline. The prohibition against “bullying” shall be publicized annually to parents/guardians and students.\n\nI. DEFINITION: While the determination that conduct does not constitute “bullying” does not restrict the right of the district to impose appropriate disciplinary consequences for student misbehavior, for acts to be defined as “bullying” under state law and board policy, the following characteristics must be present:\n\nRepeated misconduct. The behavior must be “repeated against the same student over time.” An isolated incident, however egregious, is not “bullying” under state law and board policy. Similarly, numerous acts of misconduct against dif erent students do not constitute “bullying” under law and policy. (Single incidents of misbehavior, however, will still be dealt with under usual disciplinary procedures.)\n\nRidicule, humiliation, and/or intimidation. As defined by law and policy, “bullying” is more than misconduct, such as aggression. “Bullying” behavior is marked by the intent to ridicule, humiliate or intimidate the victim. In evaluating whether conduct constitutes “bullying”, special attention should be paid to the words chosen or actions taken, whether such conduct occurred in front of others or was communicated to others, how the perpetrator interacted with the victim, and the motivation, either admitted or appropriately inferred, of the perpetrator.\n\nTypes of conduct that could constitute “bullying” include, but are not limited to: ● Physical violence and/or attacks;\n\n● Verbal taunts, name-calling and put-downs, including taunts based on appearance, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, handicap, etc.;\n\n● Threats and intimidation;\n\n● Extortion or stealing of money and/or possessions;\n\n● Exclusion from peer group\n\nII COMPLAINT PROCEDURE\n\nFormal Complaints\n\nStudents and/or parents/guardians may file written reports of conduct that they consider to be bullying. The reports should be specific as to the action giving rise to the suspicion of bullying, including time(s) and place(s) of the conduct alleged, the number of such incidents, the target of the suspected bullying, and the names of any potential student or staff witnesses. To assure completeness, it is suggested that the complainants use the applicable district report form (see appendix). A report may be filed with a teacher, administrator, guidance counselor, school nurse or other staff member, who shall refer it to the principal for review and action in accordance with Section IV. Complaint forms are available in the Assistant Principals’ Office, the Guidance Office or the Nurses’ Office at Staples High School.\n\nInformal Complaints\n\nStudents may make an informal complaint of conduct that they consider to be bullying by a verbal report to a teacher, administrator, guidance counselor, school nurse or other staff member. The complaint should be reasonably specific as to the actions giving rise to the suspicion of bullying, including time and place of the conduct alleged, the number of such incidents, the target of such suspected bullying, and the names of any potential student or staff witnesses. Any school employee who receives an informal complaint shall complete a written report form, including the information provided, and shall forward the reports to the principal no later than the following school day.\n\nAnonymous Complaints\n\nStudents who make informal complaints may request that their name be kept confidential. In such cases, the principal or designee shall meet with the student to review the request for anonymity and the impact that maintaining anonymity may have on the investigation of the complaint and/or possible remedial action. At this meeting, the student shall be given the choice as to whether to maintain the anonymity of the complaint. Anonymous complaints shall be reviewed and reasonable action will be taken to address the situation, to the extent such action (1) does not disclose the source of the complaint, and (2) is consistent with the due process rights of the accused student(s).\n\nIII DISPOSITION OF COMPLAINTS: Staff Responsibilities\n\nWitnesses: A staff member, who witnesses acts of bullying, as defined above, shall promptly notify the building principal or designee of the events and file a written report form no later than the following day.\n\nRecipients of Complaints:\n\nFormal complaints: A staff member who receives a written complaint shall forward it immediately to the building principal or designee.\n\nInformal complaints: Staff members receiving informal (verbal) complaints from students shall fill out a written report form and forward it to the principal or designee immediately (no later than the following school day). Staff members who receive verbal complaints from parent/guardians or other adults should request the informant to fill out a formal report.\n\nIV HANDLING OF COMPLAINTS: Administrators’ Responsibilities\n\nInvestigation\n\nAll complaints shall be investigated promptly under the direction of the building principal or designee, and a written report prepared when the investigation is complete. The report shall include findings of fact, a determination of whether acts of bullying were verified, and, when acts of bullying are verified, a recommendation for intervention, including disciplinary action if appropriate. Where appropriate, written witness statements shall be attached to the report. However, when a student making an informal complaint has requested anonymity, the investigation of the complaint shall be limited as is appropriate in view of the anonymity of the complainant. Such limitation of investigation may include restricting action to a simple review of the compliant, subject to receipt of further information and/or the withdrawal by the complaining student of the condition that his/her report be anonymous.\n\nFollow-up: Remedial Action\n\nVerified acts of bullying shall result in intervention by the building principal or designee that is reasonably designed to assure that the prohibition against bullying behavior is enforced, with the hope and expectation that any such bullying behavior will end as a result.\n\nBullying behavior can take many forms and can vary dramatically in its seriousness, and its impact on the victim and other students. Accordingly, there is no one prescribed response to verified acts of bullying. While conduct that rises to the level of “bullying” as defined above may warrant disciplinary action against the perpetrator, in accordance with the school system’s normal disciplinary procedures, whether and to what extent to impose disciplinary action is a matter for the sound discretion of the building principal.\n\nReporting and Record-Keeping Obligations\n\nA. Report to the parents/guardians of the perpetrator\n\nIf after investigation, acts of bullying by a specific student are verified, the building principal or his/her designee shall notify the student’s parents/guardians in writing of that finding. If disciplinary consequences are imposed against such student, a description of such discipline shall be included in such notification.\n\nB. Report to the victim and his/her parents/guardians\n\nIf, after investigation, acts of bullying against a specific student are verified, the building principal or his/her designee shall notify the parent/guardian or guardian of the victim of such finding. In providing such notification, care must be taken to respect the statutory privacy rights of the perpetrator. The specific disciplinary consequences imposed, as reflected in the perpetrator’s educational records, shall not be disclosed to the parents/guardians of the victim, except as provided by law.\n\nC. Record of List of verified acts of bullying\n\nThe principal of each school shall maintain a list of the number of verified acts of bullying in the school, and this list shall be available for public inspection upon request. Given that any determination of bullying involves repeated acts over time, each report prepared in accordance with A and B above that includes verified acts of bullying shall be tallied as one verified act of bullying unless the specific actions that are the subject of the report involve separate and distinct acts of bullying"
