        "text": "Statistics\n\nDepartment of Statistics:\n\nDepartment website: http://www.stat.columbia.edu\n\nOffice location: 1005 SSW (1255 Amsterdam Avenue);\n\nOffice contact: 212-851-2132\n\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies:\n\nRonald Neath, 615 Watson (612 West 115th Street), 212-853-1398;\n\nrcn2112@columbia.edu\n\nDirector of Academic Administration:\n\nDood Kalicharan, 1003 SSW (1255 Amsterdam), 212-853-1398; dk@stat.columbia.edu\n\nThe Study of Statistics\n\nStatistics is the art and science of study design and data analysis. Probability theory is the mathematical foundation for the study of statistical methods and for the modeling of random phenomena. The Statistics major builds on a foundation in probability and statistical theory to provide practical training in statistical methods, study design, and data analysis. The Statistics major is an appropriate background for graduate study in statistics, social science, epidemiology and public health, genetics, and economics; or for professional work in such areas as drug development, health policy, marketing, opinion polling, insurance, banking and finance, and government.\n\nThe Department offers several introductory courses.\n\nStudents interested in learning statistical concepts, with a goal of being educated consumers of statistics, should take STAT UN1001 INTRO TO STATISTICAL REASONING. This course is designed for students who have taken a pre-calculus course, and the focus is on general principles.\n\nStudents seeking an introduction to applied statistics should take STAT UN1101 INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS. This course is designed for students who wish to learn to conduct statistical analyses, but do not have a background in calculus; the focus is on the implementation of statistical methods, rather than the underlying theory. It is recommended for pre-med students, and students considering the applied track of the statistics minor.\n\nStudents seeking a more mathematically rigorous treatment of the subject should take STAT UN1201 CALC-BASED INTRO TO STATISTICS. This course is designed for students who have taken a semester of college calculus or the equivalent, and the focus is on preparation for further study in probability and statistical theory and methods. It is recommended for students considering the statistics major, or the theoretical track of the minor.\n\nStudents seeking a one-semester calculus-based survey of probability and statistical theory should take STAT GU4001 INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS. This course is designed for students who have taken calculus, and is meant as a terminal course. It provides an abridged version of the material covered in the two-semester sequence STAT GU4203 PROBABILITY THEORY and STAT GU4204 STATISTICAL INFERENCE. While some mathematically mature students may take the 4203--4204 sequence as an introduction to the field, it is generally recommended that students prepare for it by taking STAT UN1201 CALC-BASED INTRO TO STATISTICS.\n\nThe Department offers a Major in Statistics, a Minor in Statistics, and interdisciplinary majors with Computer Science, Economics, Mathematics, and Political Science. The major consists of mathematical and computational prerequisites, an introductory course, five core courses in probability and theoretical and applied statistics, plus three electives. The training provided by the undergraduate major is comparable to a master’s degree in statistics. The applied track of the minor is suitable for students preparing for academic or professional work in fields where data analysis skills are valued; it can be completed without the mathematical prerequisite required for the major. Students who are more mathematically inclined can opt for the theoretical track, and complete a minor by taking courses from the core sequence of the statistics major.\n\nStudent Advising\n\nStatistics Major and Minor Advising:\n\nRonald Neath, 615 Watson (612 West 115th Street); 212-853-1398; rcn2112@columbia.edu\n\nData Science Major Advising:\n\nComputer Science: Tim Roughgarden, 410 Mudd; 212-853-8474; tr@cs.columbia.edu\n\nStatistics: Ronald Neath, 615 Watson; 212-853-1398; rcn2112@columbia.edu\n\nEconomics - Statistics Major Advising:\n\nEconomics: Susan Elmes, 1006 IAB; 212-854-9124; se5@columbia.edu\n\nStatistics: Ronald Neath, 615 Watson; 212-853-1398; rcn2112@columbia.edu\n\nMathematics - Statistics Major Advising:\n\nMathematics: Julien Dubedat, 601 Mathematics; 212-854-8806; jd2653@columbia.edu\n\nStatistics: Ronald Neath, 615 Watson; 212-853-1398; rcn2112@columbia.edu\n\nPolitical Science - Statistic Major Advising:\n\nPolitical Science: Andrew Gelman, 1016 SSW (1255 Amsterdam); gelman@stat.columbia.edu\n\nStatistics: Ronald Neath, 615 Watson; 212-853-1398; rcn2112@columbia.edu\n\nEnrolling in Classes\n\nStudents may wish to consult the following guidelines when undertaking course planning.\n\nIt is advisable to take STAT UN1101 INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS and STAT UN2102 Applied Statistical Computing before taking any of the more advanced minor courses: STAT UN2103 APPLIED LINEAR REG ANALYSIS, STAT UN2104 APPL CATEGORICAL DATA ANALYSIS, STAT UN3104 Applied Bayesian Analysis, STAT UN3105 APPLIED STATISTICAL METHODS, and STAT UN3106 APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING.\n\nIt is advisable to take STAT UN1201 CALC-BASED INTRO TO STATISTICS, STAT GU4203 PROBABILITY THEORY, STAT GU4204 STATISTICAL INFERENCE, and STAT GU4205 LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS in sequence.\n\nCourses in stochastic analysis should be preceded by STAT GU4203 PROBABILITY THEORY, and for many students, it is advisable to take STAT GU4207 ELEMENTARY STOCHASTIC PROCESS before embarking on STAT GU4262 Stochastic Processes for Finance, STAT GU4264 STOCHASTC PROCSSES-APPLICTNS I, or STAT GU4265 STOCHASTIC METHODS IN FINANCE.\n\nMost of the statistics courses numbered from 4221 to 4234 are best preceded by STAT GU4205 LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS.\n\nThe data science courses STAT GU4206 STAT COMP ＆ INTRO DATA SCIENCE, STAT GU4241 STATISTICAL MACHINE LEARNING, and STAT GU4242 Advanced Machine Learning should be taken in sequence.\n\nPreparing for Graduate Study\n\nThe BA/MA option allows current Columbia undergraduate students (Columbia College, SEAS, the School of General Studies, and Barnard) the opportunity to complete both the bachelor’s degree and the master’s degree (BA/MA) in a shorter period of time, thus providing an option that is financially advantageous. The BA/MA in Statistics is open to students from all majors.\n\nCoursework Taken Outside of Columbia\n\nCoursework in fulfillment of a major or minor must be taken at Columbia University unless explicitly noted here and/or expressly permitted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Exceptions or substitutions permitted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies should be confirmed in writing by email to the student.\n\nAdvanced Placement\n\nColumbia College and the School of General Studies award 3 points of credit for a score of 5 on the AP statistics exam. Students who are required to take STAT UN1101 for their major should check with their major advisor to determine whether this credit provides exemption from their requirement.\n\nStudents pursuing a major that requires STAT UN1201 should plan to take that course at Columbia, even if they scored a 5 on the AP statistics exam. AP credit cannot be used to satisfy a requirement for STAT UN1201.\n\nTransfer Courses\n\nWhen students transfer to Columbia from other institutions, their coursework at their previous institution must first be considered by their school in order to be evaluated for degree credit (e.g., to confirm that the courses will count toward the 124 points of credit that every student is required to complete for the B.A. degree). Only after that degree credit is confirmed, departments may consider whether those courses can also be used to fulfill specific degree requirements toward a major or minor.\n\nNo more than two DUS-approved STAT courses toward a Statistics major may be fulfilled with transfer credit.\n\nNot more than one DUS-approved STAT course toward a Statistics joint major or a Statistics minor may be fulfilled with transfer credit.\n\nStudy Abroad Courses\n\nClasses taken abroad through Columbia-led programs (i.e., those administered by Columbia’s Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement and taught by Columbia instructors) are treated as Columbia courses, equivalent to those taken on the Morningside Heights campus. If they are not explicitly listed by the department as fulfilling requirements in the major or minor, the DUS will need to confirm that they can be used toward requirements in the major/minor.\n\nClasses taken abroad through other institutions and programs are treated as transfer credit to Columbia, and are subject to the same policies as other transfer courses, including limits on the number of approved STAT course that can be applied to the major/minor.\n\nSummer Courses\n\nSummer courses at Columbia are offered through the School of Professional Studies. Courses taken in a Summer Term may be used toward requirements for the Statistics major or minor.\n\nMore general policies about Summer coursework can be found in the Academic Regulations section of this Bulletin.\n\nUndergraduate Research\n\nMatriculated students who will be undergraduates at Columbia College, Barnard College, the School of General Studies, or the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences may apply to the Department’s summer internship program. Students work under the supervision of Statistics Department faculty mentors. The internship provides a summer housing allowance and a stipend. Applicants should send a brief statement of interest and a copy of their transcript to the Statistics DUS by the end of March to be considered. If summer project descriptions are posted on the Department’s website, please indicate your preferred project(s) in your statement of interest.\n\nStudents seeking research opportunities with Statistics Department faculty during the academic year are advised to be entrepreneurial and proactive: identify congenial faculty whose research is appealing, request an opportunity to meet, and provide some indication of previous coursework when asking for a project.\n\nDepartment Honors\n\nStudents are considered for department honors on the basis of GPA and the comprehensiveness and difficulty of their coursework in Statistics and related disciplines. Generally, no more than 10% of graduating majors receive departmental honors in a given academic year.\n\nProfessors\n\nDavid Blei (with Computer Science)\n\nJohn Cunningham\n\nRichard R.

This course is designed for students who have taken a pre-calculus course, and the focus is on general principles.\n\nStudents seeking an introduction to applied statistics should take STAT UN1101 INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS. This course is designed for students who wish to learn to conduct statistical analyses, but do not have a background in calculus; the focus is on the implementation of statistical methods, rather than the underlying theory. It is recommended for pre-med students, and students considering the applied track of the statistics minor.\n\nStudents seeking a more mathematically rigorous treatment of the subject should take STAT UN1201 CALC-BASED INTRO TO STATISTICS. This course is designed for students who have taken a semester of college calculus or the equivalent, and the focus is on preparation for further study in probability and statistical theory and methods. It is recommended for students considering the statistics major, or the theoretical track of the minor.\n\nStudents seeking a one-semester calculus-based survey of probability and statistical theory should take STAT GU4001 INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS. This course is designed for students who have taken calculus, and is meant as a terminal course. It provides an abridged version of the material covered in the two-semester sequence STAT GU4203 PROBABILITY THEORY and STAT GU4204 STATISTICAL INFERENCE. While some mathematically mature students may take the 4203--4204 sequence as an introduction to the field, it is generally recommended that students prepare for it by taking STAT UN1201 CALC-BASED INTRO TO STATISTICS.\n\nCourse Numbering Structure\n\nThe 1000-level courses (STAT UN1001, STAT UN1101 and STAT UN1201) are introductory courses. Most students will begin their study of statistics with one of these three courses.\n\nThe 2000-level courses (STAT UN2102, STAT UN2103 and STAT UN2104) are courses in computational and applied statistics, with STAT UN1101 or STAT UN1201 as a prerequisite. These are important courses in the minor program; students pursuing a statistics major will learn this material by studying the more mathematical treatment given in the 4000-level courses.\n\nThe 3000-level courses (STAT UN3104, STAT UN3105 and STAT UN3106) introduce more specialized statistical methods which build on the material introduced in STAT UN2102 and STAT UN2103. While the statistical methods covered in these courses can be quite advanced, the mathematical level remains modest. Again, these courses are part of the minor curriculum, and students completing a statistics major will learn this material elsewhere in the statistics curriculum.\n\nSTAT GU4001 is a one-semester calculus-based course in probability and statistics, intended for students who seek a mathematically rigorous course, but do not intend to major or minor in statistics (for most, this will be a terminal course).\n\nThe 4200-level courses are intended for students majoring in statistics and related disciplines.\n\nCourses numbered 4203 through 4207 introduce fundamental material in probability theory, statistical inference, data analysis, and statistical computing; these courses comprise the core of the statistics major.\n\nCourses numbered 4221 through 4234 cover specialized statistical data analysis techniques, and are possible electives for students in the statistics major.\n\nCourses numbered 4241 through 4243 introduce modern tools in machine learning and data science.\n\nCourses numbered between 4261 and 4265 cover statistical and probabilistic theory and methods in modern finance.\n\nUndergraduate Programs of Study\n\nMajor in Statistics\n\nThe major should be planned with the director of undergraduate studies. Courses taken for a grade of Pass/D/Fail, or in which the grade of D has been received, do not count toward the major. The major requires 14 courses, as follows:\n\nCourse List Code Title Points MATH UN1101CALCULUS I MATH UN1102CALCULUS II MATH UN1201CALCULUS III MATH UN2010LINEAR ALGEBRA Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java INTRO TO COMP FOR ENG/APP SCI Applied Statistical Computing STAT UN1201CALC-BASED INTRO TO STATISTICS STAT GU4203PROBABILITY THEORY STAT GU4204STATISTICAL INFERENCE STAT GU4205LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS STAT GU4206STAT COMP ＆ INTRO DATA SCIENCE STAT GU4207ELEMENTARY STOCHASTIC PROCESS\n\nThe mathematics prerequisite can also be satisfied by taking the Honors Mathematics A and B sequence, MATH UN1207 and MATH UN1208.\n\nStudents preparing for graduate study in statistics are encouraged to replace two electives with MATH GU4061 INTRO MODERN ANALYSIS I and MATH GU4062 INTRO MODERN ANALYSIS II .\n\nMajor in Data Science\n\nIn response to the ever increasing importance of “big data” in scientific and policy endeavors, the last few years have seen an explosive growth in theory, methods, and applications of AI and machine learning. The Department of Computer Science and the Department of Statistics jointly offer a Data Science major that emphasizes the interface between the two disciplines.\n\nThe major requires 18 courses, as follows. (Courses taken for a grade of Pass/D/Fail, or in which the grade of D has been received, do not count toward the major.)\n\nNotes:\n\nThe mathematics prerequisite can also be satisfied by taking the Honors Mathematics A and B sequence, MATH UN1207 and MATH UN1208.\n\nCourse List Code Title Points CALCULUS I CALCULUS II CALCULUS III\n\nor MATH UN1205\n\nACCELERATED MULTIVARIABLE CALC LINEAR ALGEBRA CALC-BASED INTRO TO STATISTICS PROBABILITY THEORY STATISTICAL INFERENCE LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS STATISTICAL MACHINE LEARNING\n\nor COMS W4771\n\nMACHINE LEARNING APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING STAT COMP ＆ INTRO DATA SCIENCE APPLIED DATA SCIENCE BAYESIAN STATISTICS Advanced Machine Learning Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in MATLAB INTRO TO COMP FOR ENG/APP SCI\n\nCOMS W1007\n\nData Structures in Java ESSENTIAL DATA STRUCTURES HONORS DATA STRUCTURES ＆ ALGOL DISCRETE MATHEMATICS ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS I COMPUTER SCIENCE THEORY INTRO-COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY INTRO-COMPUTATIONAL LEARN THRY INTRODUCTION TO DATABASES\n\nCOMS W4130\n\nMajor in Economics-Statistics\n\nPlease read Requirements for all Economics Majors, Concentrators, and Interdepartmental Majors in the Economics section of this Bulletin.\n\nThe major in Economics-Statistics provides students with a grounding in economic theory comparable to that of the general economics major, but also exposes students to a more rigorous and extensive statistics training. This program is recommended for students with strong quantitative skills and for those contemplating graduate studies in economics.\n\nTwo advisers are assigned for the interdepartmental major, one in the Department of Economics and one in the Department of Statistics. The economics adviser can only advise on economics requirements and the statistics adviser can only advise on statistics requirements.\n\nStudents should be aware of the rules regarding the use of the Pass/D/Fail option. Courses in which a grade of D has been received do not count toward the major requirements.\n\nThe economics-statistics major requires 18 courses, as follows:\n\nNotes:\n\nThe mathematics prerequisite can also be satisfied by taking the Honors Mathematics A and B sequence, MATH UN1207 and MATH UN1208.\n\nCourse List Code Title Points MATH UN1101\n\n- MATH UN1102\n\n- MATH UN1201\n\n- MATH UN2010CALCULUS I\n\nand CALCULUS II\n\nand CALCULUS III\n\nand LINEAR ALGEBRA MATH UN1101\n\n- MATH UN1102\n\n- MATH UN1205\n\n- MATH UN2010CALCULUS I\n\nand CALCULUS II\n\nand ACCELERATED MULTIVARIABLE CALC\n\nand LINEAR ALGEBRA MATH UN1207\n\n- MATH UN1208HONORS MATHEMATICS A\n\nand HONORS MATHEMATICS B STAT UN1201CALC-BASED INTRO TO STATISTICS STAT GU4203PROBABILITY THEORY STAT GU4204STATISTICAL INFERENCE STAT GU4205LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in MATLAB\n\nCOMS W1007\n\nINTRO TO COMP FOR ENG/APP SCI Applied Statistical Computing ECON GU4918SEMINAR IN ECONOMETRICS\n\nMajor in Mathematics-Statistics\n\nThis major program is designed to prepare students for: (1) a career in industries, such as finance and insurance, that require a high level of mathematical sophistication and a substantial knowledge of probability and statistics; and (2) graduate study in quantitative disciplines.\n\nThe major requires 14 courses, as follows.

Courses in which a grade of D has been received do not count toward the major requirements.\n\nThe political science-statistics major requires a minimum of 6 courses in political science, and 7 or 8 courses in statistics & mathematics, to be distributed as follows:\n\nCourse List Code Title Points INTRO TO AMERICAN POLITICS INTRO TO COMPARATIVE POLITICS INTERNATIONAL POLITICS POLITICAL THEORY I POLS GU4710PRINC OF QUANT POL RESEARCH 1 or POLS UN3704 RESEARCH DESIGN: DATA ANALYSIS POLS GU4712PRINC OF QUANT POL RESEARCH 2 CALCULUS I CALCULUS II LINEAR ALGEBRA CALC-BASED INTRO TO STATISTICS PROBABILITY THEORY STATISTICAL INFERENCE LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS STAT COMP ＆ INTRO DATA SCIENCE INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS Applied Statistical Computing APPLIED LINEAR REG ANALYSIS APPL CATEGORICAL DATA ANALYSIS APPLIED STATISTICAL METHODS APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING\n\nMinor in Statistics\n\nThe minor requires five courses, distributed as follows.\n\nStudents should select one of the following two tracks.\n\nThe requirements for the Applied track of the statistics minor are:\n\nIntroduction to statistics (one course): Choose one of the following\n\nSTAT UN1101 INTRODUCION TO STATISTICS\n\nSTAT UN1201 CALC-BASED INTRO TO STATISTICS\n\nApplied statistics core (two courses): Take both of the following\n\nSTAT UN2102 Applied Statistical Computing\n\nSTAT UN2103 APPLIED LINEAR REG ANALYSIS\n\nStatistics electives (two courses): Choose any two of the following\n\nSTAT UN2104 APPL CATEGORICAL DATA ANALYSIS\n\nSTAT UN3104 Applied Bayesian Analysis\n\nSTAT UN3105 APPLIED STATISTICAL METHODS\n\nSTAT UN3106 APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING\n\nThe requirements for the Theoretical track are:\n\nIntroduction to Statistics (one course)\n\nSTAT UN1201 CALC-BASED INTRO TO STATISTICS\n\nProbability and statistics core (three courses)\n\nSTAT GU4203 PROBABILITY THEORY\n\nSTAT GU4204 STATISTICAL INFERENCE\n\nSTAT GU4205 LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS\n\nElective (one course)\n\nOne additional STAT course numbered 4206 through 4261\n\nFor students who entered Columbia in or before the 2023-24 academic year\n\nConcentrations are available to students who entered Columbia in or before the 2023-2024 academic year. The requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree, and the role of the concentration in those requirements, can be found in the Academic Requirements section of the Bulletin dated the academic year when the student matriculated at Columbia and the Bulletin dated the academic year when the student was a sophomore and declared programs of study.\n\nConcentrations are not available to students who entered Columbia in or after Fall 2024.\n\nConcentration in Statistics\n\nThe concentration requires 6 courses in statistics, as follows.\n\nCourses taken for a grade of Pass/D/Fail, or in which the grade of D has been received, do not count towards the concentration.\n\nSTAT UN1101 INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS\n\nSTAT UN2102 Applied Statistical Computing\n\nSTAT UN2103 APPLIED LINEAR REG ANALYSIS\n\nSTAT UN2104 APPL CATEGORICAL DATA ANALYSIS\n\nSTAT UN3105 APPLIED STATISTICAL METHODS\n\nSTAT UN3106 APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING\n\n(Students may replace courses nominally required for the concentration by approved Statistics Department courses.)\n\nIntroductory Courses\n\nStudents interested in statistical concepts, but who do not anticipate undertaking statistical analyses, should take STAT UN1001 Introduction to Statistical Reasoning.

Data Scientists in all sectors analyze data to derive business insights, find solutions to societal challenges, and predict outcomes with potentially high impact. The goal of this course is to provide the student with a rigorous understanding of the statistical thinking behind the fundamental techniques of statistical analysis used by data scientists. The student will learn how to apply these techniques to data, understand why they work and how to use the analysis results to make informed decisions. The student will gain this understanding in the classroom and through the analysis of real-world data in the lab using the programming language Python. The student will learn the fundamentals of Python and how to write and run code to apply the statistical concepts taught in the classroom\n\nSpring 2024: STAT UN1010\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment STAT 1010 001/13612 M W 1:10pm - 2:25pm\n\n516 Hamilton Hall Anthony Donoghue 4.00 26/86 STAT 1010 001/13612 W 2:40pm - 3:55pm\n\n516 Hamilton Hall Anthony Donoghue 4.00 26/86\n\nSTAT UN1101 INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS. 3.00 points.\n\nPrerequisites: intermediate high school algebra.
