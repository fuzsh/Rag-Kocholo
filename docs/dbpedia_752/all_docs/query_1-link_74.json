We had so many incredible guests this year.\n\nHere are just a few highlights:\n\nOur #sihliveevent episode with Season 1 and 2 guests (Episode 16)\n\n@jocekittyllama, the fabulous creator of our SIH logo shared the meaning behind the colors and symbols. She read an original poem, “I Am From”, that captures her story of being Tawainese American (Episode 34)\n\nFrom @AngieHong we learned the term “double consciousness” (Episode 19)\n\nAfter a viral interview with the Washington Post, Eugene Cho joined us for a special edition episode on Covid-19 called “I Am Not A Virus”\n\nInEpisode 31, @Christineyisuh shared a family story about her great-aunt and their escape from North Korea, an excerpt from her upcoming book.\n\nWe heard two transracial adoptee stories with @lizkleinrock (Episode 18) and @sandhyaoaks (Episode 30)\n\nIn a rich conversation with our first Samoan guest, @etautolo, we discussed the overlap and tensions that exist with Pacific Islanders being part of AAPI (Episode 32)\n\nI have loved each and every conversation. I have learned so much and am so grateful for all our guests sharing their stories with us. If you haven’t had a chance, now is a great time to catch up on the episodes you may have missed. A big THANK YOU to all of you for your enthusiasm and support. Thank you for all your ratings, reviews and for sharing this podcast on social media with your friends and family. We are so excited for 2021 and Season 4!\n\nEpisode 34 - Nikole Lim\n\nEpisode 34 w/ Nikole Lim\n\nWhat a powerful and insightful conversation with Nikole Lim this week. Nikole is not only the founder and director of Freely in Hope, a nonprofit organization working in Kenya and Zambia, she is also an author, educator, advocate, photographer, and passionate leader. We talk about the importance of language and the difference between a victim of sexual violence and a survivor. We discuss the need for Asian Americans to know and name our emotions in order to heal. And how we need to own and tell our stories in order to offer the unique perspectives we bring as AAPI women. This conversation is loaded with important information so you may want to listen with a pen in hand to take notes.\n\nLearn More About NIKOLE\n\nInstagram: @nikole_lim\n\nTwitter: @nikole_lim\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/nikolelim\n\nNikole Lim is a speaker, educator, and consultant on leveraging dignity through the restorative art of storytelling. She is the founder and international director of Freely In Hope, a nonprofit organization dedicated to equip survivors and advocates to lead in ending sexual violence through holistic education, leadership development, and storytelling platforms. Nikole has been deeply transformed by the powerful, tenacious, and awe-inspiring examples of survivors. Their audacious dreams have informed her philosophy for a survivor-led approach to community transformation. Nikole graduated with a degree in Film Production from Loyola Marymount University and is currently pursuing a masters in Global Leadership from Fuller Theological Seminary. She is a native of the Bay Area and can often be found buying African fabric on the streets of Nairobi. Her vision is to equip survivors and advocates to lead in ending the cycle of sexual violence—believing that they will be the ones to bring us all into liberation. In it, her hope is that the world may be transformed by them—just as she has.\n\nFavorite Comfort Food\n\nXiao Long Bao\n\nLeadership Lesson\n\nLeadership is meant to be given away. In advocacy, if we’re leading we’re actually championing the dreams of other people. So what survivors taught me was sharing your story is the first step to healing.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nThis episode’s Did You Know may be triggering for some as it contains information related to sexual violence. Please be advised and aware of resources that may be of help to you.\n\nDid you know that there are memorial statues of the Comfort Women all over the world, including different parts of the United States? A couple of them are located here in California (where I’m recording this podcast), both in San Francisco and Glendale. To give some background, Comfort Women were women and children forced into sex slavery by the Japanese empire in the 1930s and through World War II. Most of these 400,000 women and children were of Korean descent and were either recruited under false advertising or violently removed and then forced to live and work in horrible, unfathomable conditions. These women lived and worked in “comfort stations,” which were sponsored by the Japanese government and were horrendous rape camps. These camps were supposed to raise the morale of Japanese soldiers as a “strategy of war” and to ironically keep them from hurting other women (CWJC). While the war eventually ended, the practice of violently using women for imperialistic gain did not. And while these comfort stations may no longer be standing, the immense pain carries on for generations. To this day there are protests and demands for redress and reparations against the Japanese government. In 2015, they agreed to pay 1 billion yen (approximately $8.3 million dollars) to support surviving comfort women, but it was unclear that the money would go directly to survivors. Activists, including survivors, demanded more––they demanded sincere apologies for the stripping of their basic human rights. They also advocated and pushed for the history of Comfort Women to be taught in schools, including U.S. schools, in hopes to keep history from repeating itself and to bring awareness to the ways in which trafficking is still rampant today. In the past few years, the Japanese government entities have continued to sever ties with various locations that have installed memorials, including Osaka’s “sister city” San Francisco. In California, organizations such as Nikkei for Civil Rights and Redress (NCRR) and the Comfort Women Justice Coalition amongst others have continued to fight for the remembrance of these stories, for the inherent dignity and strength these women had, and for the strength of these survivors, as well as those who have passed. They fight to keep memorials standing and for fair reparations to be paid for the years of pain and suffering these women endured.\n\nEpisode 33 - Sandhya Oaks\n\nEpisode 33 w/ Sandhya Oaks\n\n“Defiant hope kept me alive.” Such a powerful, moving, and informative conversation about transracial adoption this week with the amazing Sandhya. November is #nationaladoptionmonth. So often the story of adoption is told from the viewpoint of the adoptive parents. Today we hear from the perspective of a South Asian adoptee. Sandhya covers so many important topics about growing up as the only person of color in her community and the journey of discovery from self-contempt to establishing a healthy identity formation in the midst of complexity. We talk about hurtful words and phrases asked of adoptees and helpful tips and resources for transracial adoptees. You won’t want to miss this incredible episode.

We need nourishment. We need care in the context of relationship in order to increase our resilience.\n\nWhen I’m tired and or when I’m weary asking these questions:\n\n“Have I honestly allowed myself to be cared for by other people? Have I given myself the opportunities to be nourished through my senses? Have I leaned into places of relationship and just inviting people to walk with me? If not, then that might be an indication of why I’m tired and why I’m weary.\n\nCuriosity can dismantle stress. But I have learned that if you can entertain and engage the pain with curiosity, it can actually dismantle some of the stress that comes with it.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nContext is Everything\n\nDid you know the beginnings of transracial and transnational adoption in the United States are relatively recent? According to Ethnic Studies Professor Catherine Ceniza Choy, transracial adoption began in the 1950s and has intimate connections with World War II and the Cold War (1). Mixed-race children, produced by Japanese or Korean women and U.S. servicemen, were often looked down upon in Japanese and Korean societies for several reasons: 1) many were conceived out of wedlock, 2) they had apparent phenotypic differences, and 3) because they manifested the unequal power dynamics between the occupied and occupying countries (2). Choy argues that “although an American military presence in Japan and Korea was responsible for these children’s births, the U.S. government bore no official responsibility for the children’s or their mothers’ welfare. (3)” The mothers, often in impoverished situations with no aid and doing the best they could for their babies, believed that the best option would be adoption. Thus, the beginning of transracial and transnational adoptions by White Americans through nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) began. Another aspect that made these adoptions complicated was the negative and backward portrayal of Asian countries in the media, especially during times of war (4). Because of these portrayals, adoptions by 1950s U.S. NGOs were masked with humanitarianism and a savior complex, when more often than not, there were multiple parties to blame for the large influx of adoptable children. Many of these NGOs also did not screen their White parental applicants, thus often putting these children in traumatic and dangerous situations. While transracial and transnational adoptions have made improvements since its start and more resources have been made available, it is important to understand how the complicated history of these adoptions continue to affect adoptees to this day.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nChoy, Catherine Ceniza. “A History of Asian International Adoption in Amerca.” In Global Families, 15-46.

It has to be done communally. I think the way I just see leadership is it is just communal. I love shared leadership.”\n\n“Proximity helps you make wise decisions. Proximity helps you feel what the people you are leading feel. We can’t lead well without (it).”\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nDisaggregate the Data!!!\n\nDid you know that in the 2000 U.S. Census, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders were recognized by the government as two different racial identities? Previously identified in the Census as Asian Pacific Americans, these two communities are now recognized as having very different and complex histories that at times have intertwined. And yet, they are still often conflated to this day. While there is value in bunching these communities for solidarity purposes––as seen in institutions such Ethnic Studies Programs at universities and non-profits, or to address issues of violence and poverty––there are also serious complications that must be taken into consideration.\n\nFirst, data must be disaggregated. Not only is it dangerous, harmful, and inaccurate to create a narrative that supports a homogenous Asian American community as the model minority, it does not account for the vast amount of Asian American communities who are living all over the socioeconomic spectrum, and especially those who are living under the poverty line. Even more so, to also include Pacific Islander data as homogenous with Asian American, it erases the unique histories and the specific issues that are prevalent within Pacific Islander communities, while creating unrealistic expectations for both Pacific Islanders and Asian Americans. This issue tangibly manifests when these already underserved communities are not provided any or cannot afford the resources to get them out of their situations.\n\nSecondly, what complicates this matter even more so is that in many places, such as Hawai`i, Asian Americans are actually seen as settler colonialists, meaning they have not only displaced indigenous people from their land, but contributed to the loss of indigenous language, history, and practices. It is important that Asian Americans also recognize the ways in which they have oppressed others.\n\nThe question is how do we advocate for and become allies to Pacific Islander communities as Asian Americans? How do we not only make space for them at the table, but how do we show with our actions that their histories matter to us? This is especially important in an increasingly globalized world where we are, more often than not, are interconnected with one another.\n\nResources\n\nThe Wedge: Samoans for Black Lives\n\n\"How data disaggregation matters for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders\" by Christian Edlagan and Kavya Vaghul\n\n“Invisibility is an unnatural disaster”: Why funding the 2020 Census matters for Pacific Islanders by Charmaine Runes\n\n\"Who Gets To Be 'Hapa'? : Code Switch\" by Akemi Johnson\n\nBook Recommendations:\n\n“Transoceanic Flows: Pacific Islander Interventions across the American Empire” | AMERASIA JOURNAL\n\nAsian Settler Colonialism: From Local Governance to the Habits of Everyday Life in Hawaii by Candace Fujikane and Jonathan Y.

Their voice matters. Their story matters and that their story isn’t compartmentalized” outside of me, Dave, their grandparents, their great-grandparents; but that their story spans legacies and generations of history of our people being resilient and our people overcoming. Yes, we experienced oppression, but we have moved forward.”\n\n“I want them to know the hardship that my family has experienced. Not just my family, but also the Korean community. Not just the Korean community, but the broader Asian community.”\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nSisterhood as Resistance\n\nDid you know that created communities of Korean American military brides can be seen as a form of resistance? Between 1950 and 1989, 90,000 Korean women entered the United States as U.S. military brides, representing 13% of Korean immigrants between that time. (1) In an essay written by historian Ji-Yeon Yuh of Northwestern University, she argues that the communities of Korean military brides formed during this time experienced a “complex struggle for survival” in which she characterizes as “everyday resistance.” (2) Yuh defnes everyday resistance as a means of resistance “that is woven into the fabric of daily life, often covert, usually subtle, and rarely identified as resistance.” (3) For the communities of Korean military brides, this looked like navigating the tension between understanding a new family, culture, and society, the pressure to Americanize, dealing with pre-existing notions within the Korean immigrant community of military brides, and maintaining a sense of self affirmation. (4) It was in these created spaces of sisterhood where they were allowed to freely express themselves through language and support one another, while maintaining a sense of truth to oneself. What made these communities extensive and even global was their ability to maintain connections, thus allowing for their networks to overlap as they took care of each other wherever they went. They were able to find each other jobs, exchange imitation recipes, and connect each other to churches or friend groups because of personal ties and mutual friendships (5). There is much to learn and glean from these Korean American communities of women who leaned on each other not only as a form of support in spaces that were not built to serve immigrant women like themselves, but as a form of everyday resistance. Their existence and ability to thrive became their resistance. May we continue to form bonds of sisterhood!\n\nWorks Cited\n\nYuh, Ji-Yeon. “Imagined Community: Sisterhood and Resistance among Korean Military Brides in America, 1950-1996.” In Asian/Pacific Islander American Women: A Historical Anthology, edited by Shirley Hune and Gail M.

A life led by someone like Beulah Kwoh has helped pave the way for future Asian American representation in the media and on stage. An advocate for Asian American representation, Beulah also had to face the tension of working in a field that glamorized whiteness while also fighting for representation. Beulah Kwoh was born in Stockton, California in 1923. (1) A Cal Berkely and University of Chicago alumni and sociologist by training, Kwoh did not start her acting career until she was in her 30s. At the time she was teaching sociology at Los Angeles Community College after returning from working abroad at a University in China. (2) Her husband and her had been teaching there for a couple years and fled with their newborn after the Communist party took over. (3) While she was working at LA Community College, a friend referred her to director Henry King who was in need of a dialect coach to teach white actress Jennifer Jones how to speak with a British Chinese accent in the upcoming film, Love is a Many Splendored Thing (which… there are some super cringey YouTube trailers). (4) However, King instead casted her in a small role and her acting career took off. As she trained and took on more roles, she became more and more aware of the inequities that Asian American performers faced, and the flat, one-sided, stereotypical roles they were being given. (5) In response, she co-founded East West Players in the 60s, an Asian American theater company that is still thriving to this day. Through East West Players, aspiring actors of color were (and still are) encouraged to explore their talents while portraying multidimensional characters. (6) She didn’t stop there, shortly after in the 70s she also helped co-found the Association of Asian Pacific American Artists to fight against Asian American stereotyping in the media. (7) Today, East West Players continues the legacy of Beulah Kwoh and her co-founders as they “inspire and advocate for a world free of racism and discrimination through transformative artistic works.” (8)\n\nStewart Kwoh and Mary Ellen Kwoh Shu, “Breaking the Color Line in Hollywood: Beulah Ong Kwoh, Actor,” in Untold Civil Rights Stories: Asian Americans Speak Out for Justice, ed.

Draves competed in the 1948 London olympics in both the springboard and platform events and won gold in both (1). Draves was born in the 1920s in Northern California when anti-miscegenation laws had been overturned but interracial marriages were still socially frowned upon (2). Because of that, Draves, being of both Filipino and English descent, faced prejudice for her mixed race identity in her swimming career. Growing up, she was only allowed to use the pool on either “International Days” or the one day out of the week when communities of color were allowed to swim, after which the pool would be drained and cleaned (3). The coach of the women’s team she applied to created a separate swimming club for her to represent as a woman of color (4). He also required her to change her last name from Manalo (her maiden name) to Taylor (her mother’s maiden name) in order to appear more white (5). When she competed for gold in London, her coach and future husband Lyle Draves was adamant about Victoria competing as Victoria Manalo (6). Manalo took home the gold the same year as Sammy Lee, the first Asian American man to win Olympic gold medals in diving (7). Draves was admitted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1969 and in 2005 had a park in San Francisco named after her (8).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDraves, Victoria Manalo.

Born in Simi Valley in 1915, Dhillon’s father was one of the first to immigrate to the United States from Punjab. In her autobiographical works, “Parrot’s Beak” she gives a condensed glimpse of what it was like for her growing up in the early 20th century as an Asian American woman, the discrimination she faced, and the tense relationship with her mother. In her work she also highlights her experiences with racism in hospital settings, in particular as a pregnant woman and being denied health care because of her race. She also addresses issues of gender, and how she navigated her parents’, in particular her mother’s, cultural expectations and the culture surrounding her in Northern California. As she grew older, she made it a point to advocate for gender equity in both the public and private sector, starting with her home. In her autobiography, she talks about how she made it a point to ensure that she created an equitable home environment for both her son and two daughters by having them “help her according to their ability” rather than what was expected of their gender. She went on to organize for movements such as the Black Panther Party, farm workers’ rights, and the Indian Independence Movement to name a few. For her work, compassion, and tenacity, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Punjabi American Heritage Society.\n\nResources\n\nAsian American Feminist Zines\n\nThe Brown Asian American Movement: Advocating for South Asian, Southeast Asian, and Filipino American Communities\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDhillon, Kartar. “The Parrots Beak.” South Asian American Digital Archive.

Also when we fully bring ourselves as Asian- American women and say that we don’t need to be tokens in a setting. We can link arms and be communal and we’re actually stronger that way.”\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nClay Walls and the Korean American Experience\n\nDid you know Gloria Hahn published a book in the 80s about the Korean American experience in Los Angeles? Under her pen name Kim Ronyoung, Hahn wrote Clay Walls, which explores the complexities of growing up in Koreatown, Los Angeles with immigrant parents who had fled Japanese-occupied Korea. She explores the complexities and the tension of growing up second generation and having both strong eastern and western influences and how these two, at times, clash. Her book also powerfully displays the overarching yet intimate ways in which the violence caused by Japanese colonialism, imperialism, and expansionism affect not only a large group of people, in this case Korean immigrant communities and families, but also the psyche of generations to come. Scholars also suggest that through her exploration of reconciliation and restoration amidst the family, these themes are also inherently intertwined and reflective of history. Clay Walls was the first published book to speak into the Korean American experience and was also nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nResources\n\n25 Amazing Books by Asian American and Pacific Islander Authors You Need to Read\n\nConsider Buying From Eastwind Books of Berkeley\n\nWorks Cited\n\nOh, Sae-a. ‘\"Precious Possessions Hidden\": A Cultural Background to Ronyoung Kim's Clay.’ MELUS 26, no. 3 (2001): 31-49. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3185556.\n\nEpisode 26 - Margaret Yu\n\nEpisode 26 w/ Margaret Yu\n\nMargaret Yu is one of my oldest friends.

Despite the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, Mable Ping-Hua Lee and her family were able to immigrate from Guangzhou to New York because of a scholarship she received when she was nine. Her dad, having immigrated prior to the rest of the family, was a Chinese missionary living in the United States to pastor the Baptist Chinese Mission in New York’s Chinatown. Living a life full of faith and action, Mable Ping-Hua Lee became a notable suffragist and leader by the age of 16 as she lead thousands of women in the streets of New York to advocate for their rights despite the fact that Chinese Americans could not vote because of the Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred all Chinese immigrants from becoming citizens. Her work surrounding equal voting rights for women extended into her college career when she attended Columbia’s all-female counterpart, Barnard College. Throughout her time at Barnard, she was an active leader in the Chinese Students’ Association, she wrote feminist essays on voting rights for a college newspaper, and she gave speeches on voting rights for women and the importance of the involvement and education of Chinese American women of all ages. After Barnard, she became the first Chinese American woman to receive her PhD in Economics at Columbia, became the director of Baptist Chinese Mission after her father’s passing, wrote a book on the economic history of China, and established the Christian Chinese Center which served and empowered Chinese immigrants by providing resources such as English classes, health clinics, kindergarten, and vocational training. While researchers and historians are unsure if she ever attained citizenship and her right to vote, her legacy ensured that ALL women to come were able to.

What began as a way for Laura to find the light humor in parenting turned into a viral phenomenon after Laura began posting photos of her deep sleeping, costume-clad baby on Instagram. Laura has amassed a loyal audience who follow her for numerous reasons; her humorous approach to first-time parenting, her informative tips on how to raise a toddler (from packing for travel to fun ways to keep her imagination stimulated), her relatable approach to talking about her home and lifestyle, to teaching her daughter the importance of spreading kindness - all told through the lens of a down-to-earth and candid mother. Naptime With Joey was published in 2017 by Simon and Schuster, and will make you LOL for its witty and topical pop culture costume references. Laura and Joey have been featured on USA Today, ABC News, Huffington Post, and BuzzFeed, and recent partnerships include Canon, Samsung USA, Target, Huggies, Mattel, Alaska Air, and Whole Foods. Laura, Joey, and Laura's husband Allen live in Los Angeles. The family includes husband Allen and second daughter, 1 year old Casey.\n\nFAVORITE ASIAN COMFORT FOOD\n\nPHO!\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nAsian American: Who Started It?\n\nDid you know that the term “Asian American” was originally coined in the 1960s by activist and historian Yuji Ichioka as a political term to unify Asian American communities? The Asian American movement was largely inspired by the Civil Rights Movement and scholars have since then argued the pros and cons of maintaining the term Asian American as a panethnic term, meaning it encompases many Asian American identities. A limit of the term is that its broadness ignores the unique stories and struggles of specific Asian American communities. For example, the Japanese American story and the Indian American story, while there may be similar themes that come up, are very different. It also ignores issues of colorism that are still prevalent within Asian American communities. It also paints a monolithic story of each unique identity. For example, the Japanese kibei story is much different than those who are Nisei. Kibei JAs, while technically also second generation, were born in the United States but sent back to Japan for reasons such as schooling or war. The Nisei are the second generation Japanese Americans most closely associated with the Japanese American incarceration camps. A pro to the term is that it creates a sense of unity within differences and similarities. It creates a sense of common ground and solidarity with one another in times of distress. More recently during the COVID-19 times, the term has been useful in standing in solidarity with one another against hate crimes and readdressing common themes and sources of discrimination and racism.\n\nResources\n\nMountain Movers | Asian American Studies Center at UCLA\n\nAAPI History: Activist Origins of the Term 'Asian American' | Time\n\nYen Le Espiritu Asian American Panethnicity: Bridging Institutions and Identities\n\nEpisode 24 - Jocelyn Chung\n\nEPISODE 24 - Jocelyn Chung\n\nWow!

The love for boba has exploded in recent years. There are sometimes even several boba shops in one shopping center in various ethnoburbs such as the San Gabriel Valley. Recent scholarship in the past 15 years has revealed what many of us as Asian Americans may have felt, but never been able to fully put into words. These boba shops have not only been significant places for Taiwanese American youth, but have also developed to reflect Asian American youth culture. It has become a safe space where the vast, complex, and multifaceted Asian American youth community can come together to learn and share about the beautiful and at times painful complexities of being Asian American. While we often think about transmission of history, culture, and identity as a vertical movement between generations, boba shops have allowed for the horizontal dissemination of stories and experiences as Asian American youth learn from each other what it means to navigate life as an Asian American. As Angel Trazo states in her M.A. Asian American Studies thesis, boba shops help facilitate conversations about the “salience of race and place in shaping how Asian American young adults negotiate their self-identity, community belonging, and cultural imaginaries.”\n\nResources\n\n'\"Wanna Get Boba?\": The Bond Between Boba and Asian American Youth in San Jose, California' by Angel Trazo\n\n\"Te De Boba: Food, Identity, and Race in a Multiracial Suburb\" by Natalie Santizo\n\n\"Fill My Cup Half Full: Boba Stories\" by Steven Cong\n\nEater Article by Jenny G.

Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.”\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nSusan Ahn Cuddy was a trailblazing Korean American woman in the U.S. military. Her parents were the first married Korean couple to immigrate to the United States after the U.S. opened up the country to Korean Immigration. After initially being rejected for being “Oriental”, she was later accepted into the U.S. Navy. She became the first Asian American woman to become a WAVE, a program that allowed women to become enlisted officers for the duration of the war to free up men for combat positions. Susan worked for the United States Naval Reserve as a link trainer and became the Navy’s first gunnery officer.\n\nOutside her career in the military she continued to blaze trails. In her personal life, she defied miscegenation laws by marrying a white man, which was illegal in Virginia where she lived at the time. Cuddy became an intelligence officer breaking codes for the Navy and later joined the NSA, where she ran a think tank of 300 linguists and other experts gathering Russian intelligence. During the civil rights movement when her travels took her to the segregated South where she could have “passed”, she instead would demonstrate solidarity by sitting in the back of the bus with black people, using colored bathrooms, and comply with Jim Crow laws to make a statement about her race and support those who did not have a choice.\n\nSusan Ahn Cuddy is remembered as a secret-keeper, a brave officer and a community icon, one of a generation of Asian-Americans who rushed to serve their country despite the racism they faced at every turn.\n\nRESOURCES MENTIONED\n\nParasite article:\n\nhttps://tropicsofmeta.com/2020/02/17/reading-colonialism-in-parasite/\n\nEpisode 22 - Jensine Lee\n\nEPISODE 21 w/ Jensine Lee\n\nSo enjoyed my conversation today with Jensine Lee.

Many Chinese immigrated to America at the height of the California gold rush in the mid-1800s. Unfortunately, they were met with laws sanctioning their labor, housing, workplaces, interrogations and isolation. An earthquake on April 18 1906 caused widespread fires to break out among the thriving community. Attempts by soldiers to create a firebreak backfired, and devastated the community by creating fires that lasted for days. It is estimated that over 30,000 people were displaced during that time. While there was much debate and resistance to Chinese being allowed to return back to Chinatown. For more than 60 years, the Chinese Exclusion Act created a “bachelor society”, but finally in 1943 it was repealed ending decades of legalized racism and discrimination. Finally, Chinese immigrants were legally allowed to become citizens and own property. Today, San Francisco’s Chinatown has developed cultural autonomy which sustains many activities: dance, musical groups, a children's orchestra, artists, a Chinese Culture Center, and the Chinese Historical Society of America.\n\nEpisode 21 - Judy Wu Dominick\n\nEpisode 21 w/ Judy Wu Dominick\n\nI admire and appreciate this week’s guest, Judy Wu Dominick.

It started when the Agents of the Tobacco Monopoly Bureau struck a Tawainese widow suspected of selling contraband cigarettes. As a result, protests erupted nationwide. During this time, Taiwanese citizens were terrorized by the military and government. It’s estimated over 18,000 people were killed during this period. Since then, Taiwan’s past presidents and politicians have openly acknowledged and apologized for the 228 Incident.\n\nNotable Taiwanese Americans include renowned journalist Lisa Ling, Eric Lui, a speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, and NBA player Jeremy Lin.

However, Asian American educators make up less than 2% of teachers and Asian American history is widely left out of US History books. One of the first individuals to make changes to both those statistics was Alice Fong Yu.\n\nAlice Fong Yu was San Francisco’s first Aisan American school teacher. Born on March 2, 1905, her family owned the Omega Mine in Nevada County, California where they were one of two Chinese families living in the town. She was the first of her siblings to graduate high school and made it her personal goal to become a public school teacher. She was hired as San Francisco’s first Chinese public school teacher in 1926 at Commodore Stockton Elementary School where she taught for 34 years. Her roles included counselor, administrator, nurse and clerk--writing and translating Chinese. In an interview towards the end of her teaching career, she said she “sought to show her students how to manage a dual culture, not only appreciating their ancient Chinese culture but also learning how to be modern and progressive.”\n\nWith the birth of her son, who was born with Cerebral palsy, she went back to school at 57 and received credentials in special education and speech therapy from UC Berkeley. Along with working with those with speech disabilities, she arranged educational trips to China, and established the country’s first Chinese-immersion program. Her contributions to education remain influential even today. She was awarded the Phoebe Apperson Heart Medallion as one of San Francisco’s Distinguished Ten for her broad spectrum of contribution and accomplishments, as well as courage for pursuing her dreams in a hostile and xenophobic environment."
