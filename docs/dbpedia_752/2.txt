WE❤️CHMS1! Thank you to Chung Hua Middle School No. 1 for hosting a ribbon-cutting ceremony on 27 July for the new ‘WE❤️CHMS1’ signage sponsored by Swinburne Sarawak! 🙌🏼 Thank you especially to our gracious hosts from CHMS1, including Principal Mr Yap Chong Guan and heads of departments. Representing Swinburne Sarawak at the ceremony were our Executive Dean (Academic) Professor Sim Kwan Yong, Director of Business Development & Liaison James Ho, and Acting Director of Marketing & Student Recruitment Caren Wong. We are truly grateful to CHMS1 for their support towards Swinburne Sarawak throughout all these years. We hope that this new signage will be a great decorative feature at the school, to be enjoyed by all students, teachers, parents, and visitors. We’re looking forward to more collaborations with CHMS1 in the future, working hand in hand to develop talents and skills for our beloved state of Sarawak! 🌟 #swinburnesarawak #chunghuamiddleschoolno1 #chms1 #school #signage
