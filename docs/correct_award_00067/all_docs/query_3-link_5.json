Most of his poems celebrates light, the sun, his native country's historic ruins, the blue sea, and the rocky terrain of Greece. Elytis' experiences during World War II introduced a darker element and tone into his poetic world. One of his most prominent works is Άξιον Εστί (\"It Is Worthy\", 1959), in which poetry and prose intermingle as in old Byzantine liturgy. His other significant oeuvres include Έξη και μια τύψεις για τον ουρανό (\"Six Plus One Remorses For The Sky\", 1960), Ο ήλιος ο ηλιάτορας (\"The Sovereign Sun\", 1971), Τα Ρω του Έρωτα (\"The Trills of Love\", 1973).[3][5][6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
