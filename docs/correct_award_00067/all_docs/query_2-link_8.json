        "text": "According to my receipts, I purchased a collection of Odysseus Elytis (also spelt Odysseas), Selected Poems 1940-1979, at the beginning of 2021 at a time when I was actively trying to make up for the fact that I barely read anything in 2020. (Lockdown freed me up to read more, theoretically, but it also destroyed my ability to concentrate.) Most of the poems in that collection went ‘in one ear and out the other,’ which I chalked up to a combination of (1) cultural difference since Elytis’ poems are obviously very much a celebration of all things Greece (I’d wager 80% of the poems mentions at least one of the following: the sun, the river, herbs, olives, figs, grapes or pomegranates) and (2) the impossible task of translating poetry in the first place (I’m going to go on a limb here and say “PRAISED BE […] the shit of children with its green flies” sounded better in the original Greek).\n\nIt wasn’t until my second read-through where I noticed another issue, which is that translators and poem-selectors Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard combed through Elytis’ longer poems like The Axion Esti and Maria Nefeli and presented only bits and pieces of them, no doubt to present as much of Elytis’ various periods as possible but having the unintended consequence of not doing his best work justice.\n\nI’m no expert on Greek poetry, and as far as I can tell, Odysseus Elytis is celebrated for being one of the best Greek modernists. In their introduction to Selected Poems 1940-1979, Keeley and Sherrard note the great paradox of being a Greek poet: “in the mind of the educated and poetry-reading Westerner, Greece has inevitably been identified with classical Greece, especially in the form attributed to it at the time of the Renaissance. This has meant that Greek poets have been laboring under the shadow of their illustrious forbears, a circumstance that has either concealed them altogether or implied that they could not be recognized unless they conformed to an image that in many ways is totally alien to them” (1981). Thus, Odysseus Elytis’ great contribution to Greek poetry and/or 20th century poetry was that he helped bridge tradition into modernity.\n\nOne obvious example of how he did that was that he barely bothered with Greek mythology, distancing himself from Greek poets that came before. In an interview published with Ivar Ivask in the mid-70s, Elytis said clearly, “No doubt it is advantageous for a Greek poet to employ ancient myths, because he thus becomes more accessible to foreign readers. A Greek poet who speaks of Antigone, Oedipus, et cetera, moves in an area which is well-known […] I have reacted against this, often quite consciously […] I kept the mechanism of myth-making but not the figures of mythology” (1975). (There’s a passing mention of Zeus in The Axion Esti which sticks out like a sore thumb given the context of the line and also Elytis’ distancing himself from mythology.)\n\nBorn in 1911, Odysseus Elytis started writing and publishing poems in his twenties with persuasion from his friend/poet Giorgos Seferis and would continue to write into the 1940s. Coinciding with the Greek Civil War, Odysseus Elytis wrote nothing for the second half of the 1940s through to almost the end of the 1950s. The Axion Esti, published in December 1959, ended his hiatus with an ambitious three-part poem that marked the beginning of his second period. Whereas his early poems in the 1930 and 1940s could be described as surreal, the poems of his second period show, according to Elytis in that same interview, “greater historic and moral awareness, yet without the loss of vision of the world which marks my first period” (1975).\n\nThe Axion Esti is divided into three sections: “The Genesis,” “The Passion,” and “The Gloria,” and can be interpreted very loosely as an autobiography. The first section details Odysseus Elytis’ great love for his own country-slash-this ‘small world the great!’ The second section is the loss of innocence from World War 2, and so the final section is the re-discovery of beauty, or the discovery that beauty still remains. The reason why Keeley and Sherrard’s selection of The Axion Esti on Selected Poems fails Elytis is this: you get some of the words, but not the narrative, and certainly not the subtle shifting in perspective without reading the poem in its entirety.\n\nWhereas “The Genesis” establishes the narrator early on (“There alone I faced / the world / wailing loudly”), the first person in “The Passion” is no longer merely Elytis, but Elytis speaking on behalf of all of Greece, “devastated as I’ve always been by the tribes of the Continents.” Finally, “The Gloria” removes the first person from the equation—indeed, the word ‘I’ appears nowhere there—and Elytis (the writer, not the narrator in the poem) just lists (hyperbole incoming) everything beautiful in the world, including “a cicada that convinced a thousand others / conscience radiant like a summer”; “the heatwave hatching / the beautiful boulders under the bridge”; “the bit of blouse the wind eats.” It reminds me of the Big Thief song “Not” in that it’s not just any of these individual things that are listed, but it’s all of it - all of it is worthy.\n\nThe chronology is worth mentioning. In the 1930s, Giorgos Seferis helps convince Odysseus Elytis to start publishing his poems. In 1959, Odysseus Elytis writes The Axion Esti. In 1963, Giorgos Seferis becomes the first Greek writer to win the Nobel Prize while Greek critics debate the merits of The Axion Esti. By 1979, the debate has long ended and Odysseus Elytis becomes the second (and so far only other) Greek writer to win the Nobel.\n\nBibliography:\n\nElytis, Odysseus. The Axion Esti.
