        "text": "Quote of the Day / La cita del día\n\nI was given the Greek language;\n\na poor house on Homer’s beaches.\n\nMy only care my language on Homer’s beaches.\n\nSeabream there and perch\n\nwindbeaten verbs\n\ngreen sea-currents amid the azure currents\n\nwhich I felt light up in my viscera\n\nsponges, medusae\n\nwith the first words of the Sirens\n\npink shells with their first black shivers.\n\nMy only care my language with the first black shivers.\n\n(Odysseas Elytis: Psalm II)\n\nLa lengua me la dieron griega;\n\nla casa pobre en las arenas de Homero.\n\nUnica cuita me lengua en las arenas de Homero.\n\nAllí sargos y percas\n\nverbos sacudidos por el viento\n\ncorrientes verdes entre las azules\n\ncuanto vi que se iba encendiendo en mis entrañas\n\nesponjas, medusas\n\ncon las primeras palabras de las Sirenas\n\nconchas rosadas con los primeros estremecimientos negros\n\nUnica cuita me lengua con los primeros estremecimientos negros.\n\n(Odysseas Elytis: Salmo II)\n\nLocked Down in London, Day 66: Politicians\n\nFor the past few days, the row about whether a certain politician who broke the lockdown rules by travelling to visit family at some 200 miles’ distance (for childcare reasons) should resign.\n\nIn the circumstances I don’t believe that his reason for travelling was acceptable; but that’s just my personal opinion. What I do know for a fact on the other hand is that my family made sacrifices in the interest of public health instead of doing what was the best for us (as I believe did many others!) – while this mother****** did the exact opposite. Ergo, he should resign.\n\n(Of course he won’t.)\n\nContinue reading “Lockdown Diaries: Day 66 (I Brought My Life This Far)” →\n\nLocked Down in London: Open Letter to Boris\n\nDear Boris,\n\nToday I had a long, hard day at work in an overheated office (our patio) and in my well considered opinion this lockdown sucks, sucks and sucks some more.\n\nI know you’re very busy so I’ll be brief: I want water. Not from the tap! I want to go to the beach; if not that, then to the river; if not that, to the lido; if not that, at least to the pool where I’m a member.\n\nContinue reading “Lockdown Diaries: Day 61 (Give Me My Aegean)” →\n\nLocked Down in London, Day 40: Holiday flight\n\nAn e-mail from my airline regarding my upcoming holiday flight – the one we postponed from April – left me in the quandary: do I transfer the flight to July (my only remaining free holiday time), do I accept the voucher that I can’t use and try to swindle my way round the fact that it’s not transferable, or do I sit tight and hope that the airline will cancel the flight and I can get my money back?!\n\nOn the subject of holiday flights: I saw the following video a while ago, and probably you all saw it by now… but just in case somebody missed out, something to cheer you up!\n\nContinue reading “Lockdown Diaries: Day 40 (Of the Aegean)” →\n\nLocked Down in London, Day 13: The Year of the Genius Generation\n\nSince the government cancelled all exams this summer (A-levels and GCSEs both), the young and a bright are set to get predicted grades instead.\n\nWow! This will be the only year ever in which no student fails his exam; the only year when all departments in all schools meet their targets; the year when academic achievement across the country soars to unimagined heights… the year of the Genius Generation!\n\nThere’s only one small problem: How will the universities and sixth form centres accommodate all this talent?\n\nContinue reading “Lockdown Diaries: Day 13 (On Homer’s Beaches)” →\n\nThis summer it’ll be five years ago that I visited Santorini for what then I thought was the first but now suspect was also the only time. I didn’t know the poetry of Odysseas Elytis then even though he had won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1979 and I did – twice! – graduated in literature. Admittedly, neither of those degrees was in Greek literature but you don’t study literature, in any language, in a vacuum, and my ignorance of a Nobel Prize winning poet seems preposterous in retrospect.\n\nContinue reading “Ode to Santorini” →\n\nOf the Aegean\n\nThe poem below – published in 1939 – marks the beginning of a long poetic career. Given that this was the beginning, does it come as a surprise that the poet won the Nobel-Prize in literature?\n\nContinue reading “Sailing the Aegean with Odysseas Elytis” →"
