        "text": "Greek poet and winner of the 1979 Nobel Prize for Literature. Elytis's poems are written in rich language, full of images from history and myths. The lines are long and musical. Inspired by the \"sanctity of the perceiving senses\" Elytis celebrated in his early poems the mystery of the Greek light, the sea, and the air. Later themes are grief, suffering, and search for a paradise.\n\n----\"I was given the Hellenic tongue\n\nmy house a humble one on the sandy shores of Homer.\n\n----My only care my tongue on the sandy shores of Homer.\n\nThe sea-bream and perch\n\n----windbeaten verbs\n\ngreen currents with the cerulean\n\n----all that I saw blazing in my entrails\n\nsponges, medusae\n\n----with the first words of the Sirens\n\npink shells with their first dark tremors.\"\n\n(from Axion Esti, 1959)\n\nOdysseus Elytis (pseudonym of Odysseas Alepoudhelis) was born in Iráklion, Crete, into a prosperous Cretan family. He was the sixth child of Maria and Panayiotis Alepoudellis. His parents and ancestors came from the island of Lesbos, home of the ancient Greek poet Sappho. From there the family business moved to Athens. During his summer vocations, Elytis went to the islands. He often said that the Agean indelibly stamped his mind. Elytis's father died of pneumonia in 1925. Following a nervous breakdown Elytis spent two months in bed.\n\nAfter attending the Makris Private School, he entered Athens University, where he studied law from 1930 to 1935 without taking a degree. At the time, the most popular poet among the Greek youth was Kostas Karyotakis, who had committed suicide in 1928. \"Pale, seized by dreams, they all wrote similar poems that confessed their faith to the one and only god: Karyotakis,\" said Elytis of his fellow students. Periodically he worked in the family's soap manufacturing business. Inspired by Freudian theory, French Surrealism and especially Paul Éluard, Elytis also tried his hand at poetry. All his poems, which he composed, he destroyed in 1934.\n\nElytis's first poems appeared in 1935 in magazine Ta Nea Grammata, which also published George Seferis's works - he won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1963. The poet Andreas Empeirikos, who had recently returned from France and was close to the French surrealistic circle, became Elytis's lifelong friend. Along with Empeirokos and the painter Stratis Eleftheriadis-Teriade, he traveled to Lesbos, where he was involved in the discovery and promotion of the art of the folk painter Theophilos Hadjimichael (1897-1934). Orientations (1940), Elytis's first collection, combined themes of Eros and beauty with the timeless nature of the Aegean world: \"Love / The archipelago / And the prow of its foam / And the seagull of its dream\" (from 'Of the Aegean').\n\nDuring WW II when Nazis occupied Greece, Elytis joined the resistance movement and served as a second lieutenant in Albania in 1940-41. After a long campaign, he contracted typhus. Asma iroiko ke penthimo ghia ton hameno anthipolochago tis Alvanias (1943, Heroic and Elegiac Song for the Lost Second Lieutenant of the Albanian Campaign) was published during the Nazi occupation of Greece. Elytis's joyful visions of youth and the sun-drenched Aegean nature had changed into acknowlegmenet of violence and sudden death. The hero of the poem is killed on the battlefield and miraculously resurrected throught his youth and heroism.\n\n\"As a young man he had seen gold glittering and gleaming on the shoulders of the great -And one night -he remembers -during a great storm the neck of the sea roared so it turned murky -but he would not submit it\n\nThe world's an oppressive place to live through -yet with a little pride it's worth it.\"\n\n(from Death and Resurrection of Constandinos Paleologhos')\n\nLike many other leftist intellectuals, Elytis was denied a passport during the civil war between communists and royalistst. He wrote critics for the newspaper Kathimerini and worked for the National Broadcasting Institute in Athens in 1945-46 and again 1953-54. When he was given permission to travel outside the country in 1948, he moved to Paris, where he studied literature at the Sorbonne. During this time he became acquainted with Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and other figures of the Parisian art scene.\n\nIn 1953, Elytis returned to Greece and took an active role in cultural affairs. He was a member of the Greek critical and prize-awarding Group of the Twelve, and served as president and governing-board member of Karolos Koun's Art Theater and of the Greek Ballet. His silence as a poet ended in 1959 with To Axion Esti, reminiscent of Walt Whitman's Song of Myself, which celebrated the diversity of American landscapes and people. It is believed, that Elytis was proficient enough in English to read Whitman while in France.\n\nThe work took him 14 years to write; it was later set music by Mikis Theodorakis. Inspired by the Byzantine liturgy, Elytis combines the biblical story of the creation with modern Greek history. In this work the poet identifies himself in the first section, 'Genesis', with the sun and the entire Aegena world and his race. In the second, 'The Passion,' he passes through the barbaric war decade, comparing humankind's suffering with the suffering of Christ. Eventually, like Dante in Paradise, he sees the sun, love, and beauty. \"If there is, I think, for each one of us a different, a personal Paradise,\" Elytis once said, \"mine should irreparably be inhabited by trees of words that the wind dresses in silver, like poplars, by men who see the rights of which they have been deprived returning to them, and by birds that even in the midst of the truth of death insist on singing in Greek and on saying, eros, eros, eros!\"\"\n\nBetween 1965 and 1968, Elytis served on the administrative board of the Greek National Theater, and then spent the next two years in Paris after the Greek military coup of 1967. The dictatorial government offered him the Grand Prize for Literature, but he refused the honour. The two collections of poetry, The Light Tree and the Fourteenth Beauty and The Monogram, which he composed during the Junta rule, appeared in Cyprus. In 1978 he published a long poetic work, Maria Nefeli, which was finished when he returned to Greece. Its alternating monologues are spoken by a girl, Maria Nephele and the Antiphonist, the poet himself.\n\nMuch of his life, Elytis spent in semiseclusion, focusing only on his art. For many years he lived in the same apartment in Athens, frequented the Café Dexameni (a statue of Elytis stands in Dexameni Square), and wrote on the desk he had had since childhood.\n\nAfter the Nobel Prize followed a period of busy traveling. His final collection was Dytika tis Lypis (1995). Elytis never married; during his last years his companion was the poet Ioulita Iliopoulou. Elytis died of a heart attack on March 18, 1996, at his home in Kolonaki. The bulk of his books Elytis donated to libraries. His collected poems, translated into English by Jeffrey Carson and Nikos Sarris, came out posthumously in 1997. Elytis was also a talented painter and produced illustrations of his lyrical world in gouaches and collages.\n\nFor further reading: Da Omero a Elytis: la metafora del mito dall'epos antico alle letterature moderne, a cura di Matteo Miano, Sophie Zambalou, Anna Zimbone (2019); Mediterranean Modernisms: The Poetic Metaphysics of Odysseus Elytis by Marinos Pourgouris (2011); Seferis and Elytis as Translators by Irene Loulakaki-Moore (2010); God and the Poetic Ego: the Appropriation of Biblical and Liturgical Language in the Poetry of Palamas, Sikelianos, and Elytis by Anthony Hirst (2004) Odysseus Elytis: From the Golden to the Silver Poem by Adonis Decavalles (1994); Eliot and Elytis: Poet of Time, Poet of Space by Karl Malkoff (1984); Odysseus Elytis: Analogies of Light by I.
