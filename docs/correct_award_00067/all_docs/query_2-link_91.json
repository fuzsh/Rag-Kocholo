The footnotes are a wonderful source of continuing commentary on contemporary problems of reading the history of Western philosophy … No one has made the case for phenomenological certainty as well as Allinson.”\n\nHe has been invited to be the keynote speaker for the plenary session of the first conference of the European Society for Asian Philosophy, held at the University of Nottingham, U.K. He has been invited by Tang Yi-jie to lecture at the International Academy of Chinese Culture in Beijing and for the graduate students in Philosophy at the Department of Philosophy at Peking University.\n\nHe was an official Exchange Professor from the Chinese University of Hong Kong to the Department of Philosophy at Fudan University.
