        "text": "I recently came across a song called “Fever” by The Tragic Thrills and instantly loved its first few lines because it reminded me of my favourite TV character: Carrie Bradshaw. Carrie, although just a fictional character has influenced and inspired me to start writing and most of all, follow my dreams.\n\nThat is until the third line where Carrie’s figure in my mind was suddenly replaced by mine. Carrie never for once doubted that she isn’t going to succeed in what she loves, she never for once thought that she wouldn’t become a writer, an artist. Yet I have.\n\nThis song not only revealed my doubts but also helped me realize that I should stop doubting myself, my potential and finally believe in my “fever”, in my passion for writing and in myself. I’ve finally found a goal that I want to achieve with all my heart. I know that I will have to work hard for it, but that is what I love about it. I will have to work hard for something I love and when you love something the journey toward achieving it is the sweetest part. I have the potential to make it and I might as well use it.\n\n“Sweet, sweet girl dreamed someday she’ll be a writer\n\nSwore she’d never give up on her sole desire\n\nBut leaps of faith turned to shot in the darkness\n\nUntil she told herself that she’ll never be an artist”\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/embed?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A38wPKgEMUxuBicuvsN9o9c\n\nThis song has also inspired me to write the following:\n\n“I want someone to believe in me. To believe in my fever. Someone to be there for me and support even the silliest idea of mine. Someone who will trigger my creativity and let me be myself. Someone who will be proud of me and what I do.\n\nI want a lover.\n\nNot just a lover, but a friend.\n\nA friend who will be there to cheer me up when my ideas fail. Someone who will boost my confidence and believe I have potential. Someone who will love me no matter what. Someone who has dreams of themselves and who will let me be part of them. Someone with whom I can share my thoughts without feeling uncomfortable and scared of what they would think.\n\nI want someone who gets me.”\n\nYet believe me that the first person that should believe in you, should be YOU.\n\nDon’t push yourself too hard. Set your limits. A limitless mind is an insane person’s mind, the mother of anxiety itself. Yes, you want to be a lot of things, yes sometimes you have to push yourself to achieve everything you crave- but to its LIMITS. Set goals, construct a hierarchy of priorities. A small set at a time. Do not allow yourself to get lost in incumbencies that you have created for yourself. Enjoy your every day, every minute, every second. Your demons are your enemies and you are the only one who can control them. Hence, your only enemy is merely YOURSELF.\n\nStand up, make a plan- not a life plan-, a day plan. Stop worrying about tomorrow and take a look at TODAY. What makes you feel happy? Do that. Is it hanging out with or talking to your friends? Is it watching a movie? Is it studying a book you never seem to find time to finish? Is it studying because it is what you love and what is going to secure your future? That last one, do it with love, passion, devotion, and peacefulness. Stop thinking about deadlines and start enjoying what you are doing and believe me that when you do that it is going to feel right because it will be right. Stop saying “what if I don’t” and start saying “what if I do”. Think and dream positive. Do not fly on cloud 9 but get cloud 9 down here with you and help it lift you up.\n\nStop comparing yourself to others, yet look at their success and be inspired. There are no antagonists in life. Your true antagonist is yourself. Stop fighting it and start enriching and embracing it. I know that it is easier said than done and I myself, I admit that I have reached that stage but not in its full potential, yet those moments I did, those seconds, were the best of my entire 19 years. I repeatedly drag cloud 9 close to me, I help it lift me up to some point and then fall again, and then again I drag it down and fall again and again and again, but I will never stop until I find a way which will make every time I fall better and easier to get up. The more times you fall the better you learn how to stand up, lift yourself up and each time quicker than ever. That “quickness” is what we should all be aiming at and the only way to achieve it is through falling and failing again and again.\n\nDedicated to all those who are feeling lost right now. We’re in the same shoes. And I hope that by reading this you will find the strength and motives to get up again as I did by writing it.\n\nA quote from “Paradise Lost”, by John Milton, I came across yesterday and which inspired me and helped me feel the ground under feet again.\n\n“The mind is its own place, and in itself\n\nCan make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of heaven”\n\nThanks to @orionvanessa ( on Instagram ) I came across it and allow me to quote what she wrote in her description of this particular extract by John Milton: “…A reminder that we create the demons within us and that we are in control. As humans do, we overthink and turn our inner musings into a hell of its own. A Milton reminder that you are not alone.”\n\nI hope that everyone reading this will relate it to their own particular state and use it as a map to get back on their own unique path leading to their aspirations.\n\nUnapologetically herself,\n\nTheYGirl\n\nTo choose a career path in your life is probably one of the biggest decisions you will ever have to make, and one that will unquestionably determine your future. From a very young age, we are asked by friends and family in our close environment “what is it that we want to become when we grow up”, and the most determined of us may answer with something like “I want to become a teacher, pilot, doctor, astronaut or maybe a psychiatrist” and some of us have absolutely no clue.\n\nAlmost three years ago (cannot believe how fast time flew by) I had to make the most crucial decision of my entire nineteen years of life; choose what I want to study, or in other words “what and mostly who I want to be”. When I was little I wanted to become so many things when I would grow up. At some point, I wanted to become a detective. At another point, an archeologist and much more. Yet one particular career would never leave my mind; that of a psychologist. I’ve always been concerned with the way people think, act and react and the science of it. So in my last year two years of High School, I had set my goal; become a psychologist. It was something new to me that held much mystery which as it turned out blinded me and so I could not see what was right in front of me; English.\n\nI’ve always loved English and always had dreams of going to the US and having my own New York apartment, a job and be part of two cultures; Greek and American. That was and still is my priority goal in life and that is why the very last minute I had to choose the subject of my studies I changed my mind. I closed my eyes and fantasized myself as a psychologist which gave me a “gray” kind of vibe; yet when I fantasized myself studying English I saw the most vibrant rainbow I had ever seen in my life. Sounds cheesy, I know. That, of course, does not mean that my love for Psychology has faded; not at all – it just seemed that English could open more doors for me, through which I could finally find my way towards my goals.\n\nSo, here I am now, studying English and being offered subjects in Psychology as well, not having regretted a single second of the moment I changed my mind and chose what suits me better; English and its many opportunities to combine whatever I love doing.\n\nI could never and still aren’t able to wrap my head around the idea that you have to choose a job and stick to it. To me occupying yourself with just one thing is not enough; it has to transform things I am passionate about into a perfectly put together collage.\n\nLearning English in depth has helped me come to the realization of how much I appreciate the beauty of literature and the mystery and complexity of linguistics, which I want to pursue, and has also let me in the English and American culture which I so much devour. It has given me more than I had ever imagined and I hope that one day I will give back to it.\n\nUnapologetically herself,\n\nTheYGirl\n\nI met my first love a few years ago and not a long time ago we broke up for the third time. Since then various thoughts have been whirling around my head. I don’t think that I can be attracted to anyone at the moment and it seems like until I find someone else I will still feel kind of attached, not really to him, but to his ideal self in our ideal relationship, which is something that has got me contemplating.\n\nIn the end, is it true what they say about break-ups?\n\nThat after getting back from the second break-up with someone more are going to follow? Could there possibly be a third or even fourth chance to get together with someone again?\n\nAnd is it true what they say about lovers?\n\nDo we only meet two big loves in our lives?\n\nAnd do we eventually end up with our first love?\n\nI certainly would not want that.\n\nI am anticipating that second love with whom I wish a second or third chance won’t be necessary.\n\nUnapologetically herself,\n\nTheYGirl"
