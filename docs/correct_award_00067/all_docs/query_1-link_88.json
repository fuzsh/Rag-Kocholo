        "text": "A new cultural landmark in Athens, dedicated to the life and work of the Nobel Prize-winning Greek poet Odysseus Elytis, is nearing completion.\n\nSet to become a major attraction for visitors to the Greek capital, the Odysseus Elytis Museum will be run by non-profit NGO Aerton, the organization that owns the Odysseas Elytis archive.\n\nThe museum’s creation recently became official following the signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) between Culture Minister Lina Mendoni and NGO Aerton President Ioulita Iliopoulou.\n\nUnder the MoC, the Culture Ministry will grant Aerton the use of the building located at the junction of Dioskourwn and Polygnwtou streets in the Athenian quarter of Plaka, as well as the two adjacent auxiliary buildings, upon completion of restoration works which are expected to be finished this summer.\n\nThe ministry will also subsidize the museum’s operation and provide specialized expertise and support to the site, which will be managed by Aerton. The restoration works began in December 2020.\n\nOdysseus Elytis Museum\n\nThe new museum will feature a permanent exhibition space that will include photographs, texts, audio, and visual material, offering visitors a glimpse into the poet’s life and work.\n\nIn particular, there will be an accurate reconstruction of Elytis’ office, his workplace, personal objects, and valuable archival and exhibition material curated by Iliopoulou, familiarizing guests with the poet’s aesthetics, life, and conception of art. The museum will also house the Elytis Archive and other items related to his work.\n\nCulture Minister Lina Mendoni said that the new museum, besides showcasing the poet’s life and work, “will also highlight Athenian urban architecture and demonstrate the historical continuity of the capital”.\n\nShe also noted that the museum is expected to become a major point of interest for visitors interested in the poet’s “great contribution to contemporary Greek culture”.\n\nOdysseas Elytis, a prominent Greek poet and member of the 1930s literary generation, received the State Poetry Prize in 1960 and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1979, making him the second and last Greek to receive the award.\n\nElytis is known for his innovative poetic style, with notable works such as Axion Esti and Orientations. He also translated poetic and theatrical works and was a member of various international art and literary organizations.\n\nFollow to keep up to date with all the latest on tourism and travel in Greece."
