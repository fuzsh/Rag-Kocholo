        "text": "Angelos Sikelianos (Greek: Άγγελος Σικελιανός; 28 March 1884 – 19 June 1951) was a Greek lyric poet and playwright. His themes include Greek history, religious symbolism as well as universal harmony in poems such as The Moonstruck, Prologue to Life, Mother of God, and Delphic Utterance. His plays include Sibylla, Daedalus in Crete, Christ in Rome, The Death of Digenis, The Dithyramb of the Rose and Asklepius. Although occasionally his grandiloquence blunts the poetic effect of his work, some of Sikelianos finer lyrics are among the best in Western literature. In the six years from 1946 until 1951, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nAndonis Fostieris (Greek: Αντώνης Φωστιέρης; born 1953) is a Greek poet. He studied Law at the University of Athens and History of Law at Sorbonne, Paris. Since 1981, he is co-editor and director of the literary periodical Η λέξη. Fostieris is one of the eminent poets of the so-called Generation of the Seventies Genia tou 70, which is a literary term referring to Greek authors who began publishing their work during the 1970s, especially towards the end of the Greek military junta of 1967-1974 and at the first years of the Metapolitefsi. Fostieris has been considerably translated; that includes translation into English by Kimon Friar (1984), the acclaimed translator and scholar for his Modern Greek literature translations.\n\nChristoforos Liontakis (Greek: Χριστόφορος Λιοντάκης; 1945 – 26 July 2019) was an award-winning Greek poet and translator. He read law at the University of Athens and philosophy of law at the Sorbonne, in Paris. His first collection of poems was published in 1973. He belonged to the so-called Genia tou 70, a literary term referring to Greek authors who began publishing their work during the 1970s, especially towards the end of the Greek military junta of 1967-1974 and during the first years of the Metapolitefsi. For his collection of poems With the Light, published in 1999, he received the Greek National Book Award for the Year 2000 and the poetry prize of the prestigious literary journal Diavazo. The French Ministry of Culture honored him with its Knighthood of Arts and Letters, and the municipality of Heraklion awarded him the Nikos Kazantzakis Literary Prize. Liontakis died on 26 July 2019."
