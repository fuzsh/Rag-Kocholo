        "text": "Of the Aegean\n\nThe poem below – published in 1939 – marks the beginning of a long poetic career. Given that this was the beginning, does it come as a surprise that the poet won the Nobel-Prize in literature?\n\nOf the Aegean\n\nEros\n\nThe archipelago\n\nAnd the prow of its foams\n\nAnd the gull of its dreams\n\nOn its highest mast the sailor waves\n\nA song\n\nEros\n\nIts song\n\nAnd the horizons of its voyage\n\nAnd the echo of its nostalgia\n\nOn her wettest rock the betrothed awaits\n\nA ship\n\nEros\n\nIts ship\n\nAnd the nonchalance of its summer winds\n\nAnd the jib of its hope\n\nOn its highest undulation an island cradles\n\nThe coming\n\nOdysseas Elytis\n\n(transl. Jeffrey Carson)\n\nΤου Αιγαίου\n\nΟ έρωτας\n\nΤο αρχιπέλαγος\n\nΚι η πρώρα των αφρών του\n\nΚι οι γλάροι των ονείρων του\n\nΣτο πιο ψηλό κατάρτι του ο ναύτης ανεμίζει\n\nΈνα τραγούδι\n\nΟ έρωτας\n\nΤο τραγούδι του\n\nΚι οι ορίζοντες του ταξιδιού του\n\nΚι η ηχώ της νοσταλγίας του\n\nΣτον πιο βρεμένο βράχο της η αρραβωνιαστικιά προσμένει\n\nΈνα καράβι\n\nΟ έρωτας\n\nΤο καράβι του\n\nΚι η αμεριμνησία των μελτεμιών του\n\nΚι ο φλόκος της ελπίδας του\n\nΣτον πιο ελαφρό κυματισμό του ένα νησί λικνίζει\n\nΤον ερχομό\n\nΟδυσσέας Ελύτης\n\nIf you know the poem, then you realised that the lines above merely constitute the first part – the rest will follow below (unfortunately I couldn’t find the Greek original of the other two parts.)\n\nBut personally I like to pause at the end of the first part. Literature – art – is always a very personal experience and of all forms of literature poetry is perhaps the most personal: I like my poems short, vivid in their imagery and suggestive, rather than prescriptive, in their meaning – leaving space for the imagination. To me parts II and III merely develop a theme that has already been perfectly formed and therefore cannot possibly be improved upon. What do you think?\n\nII\n\nThe playing waters\n\nIn shady passages\n\nSpeak the dawn with their kisses\n\nWhich begins\n\nHorizon—\n\nAnd the wild doves vibrate\n\nA sound in their cave\n\nBlue waking in the fount\n\nOf day\n\nSun—\n\nThe northwester gives the sail\n\nTo the sea\n\nCaresses of hair\n\nTo the carefreeness of its dream\n\nDew—\n\nWave in the light\n\nAgain gives birth to the eyes\n\nWhere Life sails toward\n\nFar-seeing\n\nLife—\n\nIII\n\nSea surf kiss on its caressed sand—Eros\n\nThe gull gives the horizon\n\nIts blue liberty\n\nWaves go come\n\nFoaming answering in the ears of shells\n\nWho took the blond sunburnt girl?\n\nThe sea breeze with its transparent blowing\n\nTilts the sail of dream\n\nFar out\n\nEros murmurs its promise—Sea surf.\n\nPoetry in Translation – A Game of Chinese Whispers\n\nConsidering Elytis won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1979, he seems to be very little known. (Or maybe I’m just moving in the wrong circles.)\n\nPerhaps it’s because we have to read him in translation; poets always seem to have a harder time to become internationally famous than writers. In his Nobel Lecture, Elytis said:\n\n…you know us through the 20 or 30 per cent that remains of a work after translation.\n\nPoetry is as much about sound and rhythm as about meaning; it’s impossible to render a poem perfectly in translation. Not only that, but there is always going to be a translator between you and the poet. Instead of engaging directly with the poet via his poem, you’re participating in a game of Chinese whispers. Carson’s translation reads very well to me (although personally I wouldn’t have substituted Eros for love in the first line of each verse). In this case I’m lucky that I can, just about, read sufficient Greek to be able to appreciate some of the cadence of Elytis’s original lines; I wish I could read more.\n\nSailing the Aegean with Odysseas Elytis\n\nElytis is a ‘very Greek’ poet, if you can say such a thing. Jeffrey Carson, the translator responsible for the collected poems of Elytis – the first such collection, predating even a Greek one – wrote in his introduction that,\n\n… it is the Aegean world that provides Elytis with his images.\n\nHe was writing about part I of Of the Aegean but it’s a fair description of Elytis’s poetry in general. Elytis has a clearly recognisable style, with very vivid images of Greece that arrest you. It’s the kind of poetry that you can turn to when you’re feeling sad; with its affirmation of life, love, its images of the sea and the sun, its evocations of more than three thousand years of history. It’s difficult not to like Elytis’s poetry if you love Greece.\n\nStill talking about part I of Of the Aegean, Carson went on to say:\n\nThis maiden strophe closes with an image of a sea-voyaging sailor singing to the wind and waves: it is Elytis proclaiming his life’s course, a course he was still proclaiming in the last book he brought out, written in his eighties.\n\nI like the idea of life as a sea voyage – especially through the Greek archipelago – and the notion that Elytis spent a lifetime turning this into poetry sounds good to me. I need to read more of his poetry – I’d love to lay my hands on a bilingual version of his collected poems and sail the Aegean alongside him."
