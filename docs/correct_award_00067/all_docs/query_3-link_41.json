        "text": "March 10, 2009\n\nMy first instinct is to give this book one star, but I gave it a 2nd, because I strongly suspect that part of my issues with it may stem from the quality of the translation.\n\nAlmost all of the poetry has a very choppy, awkward lack of flow, but I can only assume that in translating poetry from Greek to English, a ton is lost in translation. Not least of which the cadence and flow.\n\nThe fawning introduction by Sam Hamill emphasizes Elytes' connection to the surrealist movement. The moment I read this, I got that sinking feeling as I realized what I was in for. I am not a fan of surrealist poetry and writing. I tried to approach with an open mind, but the text met my worst expectations... disjointed words, nonsensical phrases, the whole thing.\n\nMy frustration came to a head with the \"poem\" entitled \"Aegeodrome\" - I put poem in quotes, because it consists of a list of individual words spanning 4 pages of three columns per page. Alphabetized.\n\nI understand that in the mid to late part of the century artists and writers were trying to challenge the prevailing prejudices of what did and did not qualify as \"art.\" I get that. But a 4-page alphabetized list? Call me old fashioned and call my taste narrow and parochial, but I felt like this was just too much for me."
