        "text": "Product Development:\n\nThe whole process what Honokage can do is from packaging/plastic injection molded parts design, material science, rapid prototyping, molds making until to mass production.\n\nProduct Design:\n\nHonokage can design and produce the right packaging solution for our clients and end consumers through concept discovery, technical development, and qualitative and quantitative assessments. Our design process is structured by three steps to turn your idea to a clear and detailed design with free hand sketches, make 3D rendering and Prototype to accurately determine the shape and structure to meet the required product specification.\n\nMaterial Science:\n\nOur Material Science team works closely with clients to overcome unmet demands, whether they are related to product performance or sustainability effects. In order to grasp regional, national, and international instructions on material specifications and testing, we are actively involved with industry groups. We combine the interaction between our supplier base and internal expertise to provide ground-breaking material breakthroughs, choosing from a wide range of solutions including unique virgin polymers, sustainable solutions, and additive technologies.\n\nRapid prototyping:\n\nRapid prototyping is an essential component of our design methodology. Inside our design labs, we have constructed a cutting-edge model shop. This makes it possible to work directly with our 3D prototype sample makers and turn around physical models and comps in a very short time. We can also set and change objectives as necessary, keep charge under control, and, most significantly, speed up the time for development.\n\nMolds Making & Realization:\n\nHonokage have 3 qualified mould designers & 15 mould makers, 2 Australian mold design & making consultant, our Teamcenter as below:\n\nl 4 unit of CNC machines, 1 unit of Engraving machine, 3 unit of EDM, 1 for Grinding machine, 3 for Milling machine, 1 for Drilling machine, 1 for Lathe machine and 1 for 3-dimensional measuring machine.\n\nl Mould measurement accuracy up to 0.002mm\n\nl Experienced team!\n\nTechnology Integration:\n\nWe integrate all supporting resources in order to produce high quality products to our customers in a more efficient and stable way, such as integrating In mold printing, labeling system, robot arm, molds, Demag equipment, visual inspection system, automatic assembly sytem, automatic stacking system, and automatic packaging systems, so that the whole production process can be perfectly coordinated.\n\nFlexible Manufacturing Strategy:\n\nInitial packaging requires a large upfront cost to be put into production. The dangers are great. Our flexible strategy change that. We provide you with access to existing mold base and hot runner, and adaptable manufacturing systems with lower cavitation. Prior to a dedicated mass production mould, you may reduce risk and increase time to market with this flexible strategy, which also gives you room to grow to 50 million pieces.\n\nRESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT\n\nBiodegradable Plastic Containers\n\nPlastic Containers IML Technology Patent\n\nPlastic Containers Oxygen Barrier"
