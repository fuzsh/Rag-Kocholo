Additional Resources\n\n1. Overview of HFCs and the AIM Act\n\nWhat are HFCs?\n\nHydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are potent greenhouse gases developed and manufactured as replacements for ozone-depleting substances. These fluorinated chemicals have no known natural sources. They can have impacts on the climate hundreds to thousands of times greater than the same amount of carbon dioxide (CO2). The impact is measured by the global warming potential (GWP) of a substance; one kilogram of a greenhouse gas with a GWP of 700 has an impact on the climate that is 700 times stronger than one kilogram of CO2, which has a GWP of 1. Unlike ozone-depleting substances, HFCs do not deplete the stratospheric ozone layer.\n\nWhere are HFCs used?\n\nClimate-damaging HFCs are used in many of the same sectors where ozone-depleting substances have been used: refrigeration and air conditioning, fire suppression, solvents, foam blowing, aerosols, and semiconductor manufacturing. As of 2018, about 75% of total HFC use in the United States occurred in refrigeration and air conditioning equipment in homes, commercial buildings and industrial operations; approximately 8% in air conditioning in vehicles and refrigerated transport.\n\nWhy have HFCs been increasing in use?\n\nHFCs have been increasing in the atmosphere due to increased demand globally for refrigeration and air conditioning, and because they are the primary substitutes for ozone-depleting substances, which are being phased out worldwide due to the global agreement the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Montreal Protocol). HFC emissions had previously been projected to increase substantially over the next several decades. However, in 2016, in Kigali, Rwanda, countries agreed to adopt an amendment to the Montreal Protocol, known as the Kigali Amendment, which provides for a global phasedown of the production and consumption of HFCs. The United States ratified the Kigali Amendment on October 31, 2022. According to the World Meteorological Organization’s 2022 Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion, global adherence to the Kigali Amendment would substantially reduce future emissions, leading to a peaking of HFC emissions before 2040.\n\nWhat are the impacts of HFCs on the environment?\n\nHFCs are extremely powerful greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change, which threatens society with costly health and environmental impacts such as floods, wildfires, drought, and increasingly severe weather events. Find more information on climate change.\n\nWhat is the AIM Act?\n\nThe American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (AIM Act) was enacted on December 27, 2020. The AIM Act mandates the phasedown of HFCs by 85 percent from historic baseline levels by 2036 and authorizes EPA to address HFCs in three main ways: (1) phasing down HFC production and consumption through an allowance allocation program, (2) facilitating sector-based transitions to next-generation technologies, and (3) issuing certain regulations for purposes of maximizing reclamation and minimizing releases of HFCs from equipment.\n\nTo achieve the first part, the phasedown of HFCs through an allowance program, EPA established the HFC Allocation Program in the Allocation Framework Rule, “Phasedown of Hydrofluorocarbons: Establishing the Allowance Allocation and Trading Program under the AIM Act” (86 FR 55116), which codified the AIM Act’s production and consumption phasedown schedule of HFCs. This phasedown schedule started with a 10% reduction in 2022 and a further decrease in 2024 to 60% of baseline levels.\n\nNote: “Consumption” is the amount of HFCs newly added to the U.S. market through production and import, minus exports and destruction.\n\nThe Technology Transitions Program focuses on the second area of the AIM Act – the transition to substitutes through restrictions on use of HFCs in specific sectors and subsectors. Starting as soon as January 1, 2025, restrictions will take effect on the use of higher-GWP HFCs in new 1) aerosols, 2) foams, and 3) refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump equipment.\n\nTo address the third area, EPA is proposing regulations to control, where appropriate, practices, processes, or activities regarding the servicing, repair, disposal, or installation of equipment that involves HFCs and their substitutes. The proposed rule under subsection (h) would establish an emissions and reclamation program for the management of certain HFCs and their substitutes that would include provisions that apply to both new and existing equipment in certain sectors and subsectors.\n\nWhat are the costs and benefits of the HFC phasedown?\n\nThe projected emission reductions of the HFC Allocation Program from 2022 to 2050 are equivalent of 4.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide –equal to approximately three years of U.S. power sector emissions at 2019 levels. A global HFC phasedown is expected to avoid up to 0.5°C of global warming by 2100.\n\nEPA calculated the societal costs of HFCs to monetize the benefits of the HFC Allocation Program. EPA estimated the cumulative net benefits of this program as $269.9 billion from 2022 through 2050 (in 2020 dollars). The benefits are calculated over the 29-year period from 2022–2050 to account for the years that emissions will be reduced following the consumption reductions from 2022–2036.\n\nFor more information, see the 2024 Allocation Rule’s Regulatory Impact Analysis addendum to the HFC Allocation Framework.\n\nThe Technology Transitions Program rule will reduce GHG emissions beyond those already provided by the HFC phase-down in the HFC Allocation Program alone, while also providing savings to American consumers and industry through energy efficiency gains and lower cost substitutes. EPA estimates that this initial rulemaking will result in emissions reductions equivalent to up to 876 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from 2025 through 2050. The climate benefits of these emissions reductions are up to $50.4 billion in 2020 dollars. In addition, EPA estimates that this rule provides up to $4.5 billion in overall savings to consumers and businesses, largely driven by the lower cost of refrigerants and increased energy efficiency of equipment using lower-GWP substitutes. For informational purposes, EPA estimates that the proposed emissions reduction and reclamation rule, if finalized as written, would also result in significant GHG emissions reductions benefits while providing cost savings. In the years 2025 – 2050, the proposed provisions would prevent an estimated additional 142 MMTCO2e in HFC emissions beyond the expected benefits from the HFC Allocation Program that went into effect in 2022. The net incremental benefits of this rule from 2025 – 2050 is at least $6.1 billion.\n\nWhat is the impact of the AIM Act on U.S. industry?\n\nU.S. companies are at the forefront of developing substitutes to HFCs and the technologies that use them. The AIM Act allows companies to continue to lead and innovate internationally. The AIM Act, which is supported by a broad coalition of industry and environmental groups, provides regulatory certainty across the United States for phasing down HFCs and ushers in the use of more climate friendly and efficient substitutes that can save consumers money while improving the environment. This program may also support increased international demand for substitutes manufactured by U.S. firms.\n\nHow will U.S. consumers be affected by an HFC phasedown under the AIM act?\n\nThe public is expected to reap health and climate benefits from transitioning away from climate-damaging HFCs to safer and more energy-efficient cooling technologies. There are no requirements to stop using any specific equipment or appliance currently in use. Consumers will be able to continue using their equipment until the end of its useful life. As with the transition from ozone-depleting substances, which is largely concluded, the HFC phasedown may not be noticeable to most consumers.\n\n2. The HFC Allowance Allocation Program\n\nWhat does the HFC Allocation Program do?\n\nConsistent with the AIM Act, EPA is phasing down regulated HFCs to 15% of their historic baseline levels in a stepwise manner by 2036. As part of this phasedown, EPA established an HFC Allowance Allocation Program, including allocating allowances for six specific applications listed in the AIM Act. Allowances are based on the “exchange values” of HFCs which are defined in the AIM Act and correspond to their 100-year GWPs, as given in Table 2.14 of the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Allowances are needed to produce or import bulk HFCs.\n\nEPA relies on a robust compliance and enforcement system to prevent and identify illegal activity in the United States and to help ensure compliance with the obligations under the AIM Act.\n\nEPA took initial action through the Allocation Framework Rule in 2021 to implement this phasedown by, among other things:\n\nEstablish the HFC production and consumption baseline levels from which reductions are made\n\nDetermine an initial methodology for allocating production and consumption allowances for 2022 and 2023\n\nIdentify both the types of entities receiving allowances and how to determine what quantities of allowances they would receive\n\nCreate a set-aside pool of allowances for new entrants and entities for which the Agency did not have verifiable data prior to the finalization of the rule\n\nEstablish provisions for the transfer of allowances\n\nEstablish recordkeeping and reporting requirements\n\nEstablish a suite of compliance and enforcement-related provisions\n\nIn the Production Baseline Rule, promulgated in 2023 the Agency amended the production baseline downwards by about 0.005% to reflect corrected data on additional destruction and transformation of HFCs that occurred during 2011–2013.\n\nThe Agency took further action through the 2024 Allocation Rule, “Phasedown of Hydrofluorocarbons: Allowance Allocation Methodology for 2024 and Later Years” (86 FR 46836), to establish the methodology for allocating HFC production and consumption allowances for calendar years 2024 through 2028. That action:\n\nEstablished a methodology to allocate calendar year 2024 through 2028 general pool production and consumption allowances that was similar to the methodology established under the Allocation Framework Rule for calendar years 2022 and 2023\n\nAmended the consumption baseline downwards by about 0.4% to reflect corrected data submitted to EPA\n\nMade other adjustments to the HFC Allocation Program\n\nThe 2024 Allocation Rule, promulgated in 2023, did not make changes to EPA's approach to issuing application-specific allowances. More information on these actions is available on the Regulatory Actions for Allowance Allocation and Reporting webpage. Find program updates at How have the HFC Allocation Program requirements changed since the Allocation Framework Rule?\n\nHow are allowances related to the production or import of bulk HFCs?\n\nWhat is a bulk HFC?\n\nA bulk HFC is an HFC listed as a regulated substance that is in a container [(e.g., cylinders, drums, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) tanks, small cans)] for the transportation or storage of that substance. Bulk HFCs must first be transferred from a container to another container, vessel, or piece of equipment in order to realize their intended use. All bulk imports are covered regardless of size. For example, an air conditioning recharge kit is a bulk substance because the contents must first be transferred to realize its intended use. Examples include service cans, disposable non-refillable cylinders, refillable cylinders, drums, ton tanks, and ISO tank containers.\n\nA regulated substance contained in a manufactured product such as an appliance, an aerosol can, or a foam is not a bulk substance. The Allowance Allocation Program applies to bulk HFCs. Requirements regarding products and appliances containing HFCs fall under the Technology Transitions Program.\n\nWhat is an allowance?\n\nAn allowance is the unit of measure that EPA uses to control production and consumption of bulk HFCs. An HFC allowance is equal to one metric ton of exchange value equivalent (i.e., one metric ton carbon dioxide equivalent). HFCs with higher exchange values (i.e., global warming potentials) thus require more allowances to produce or import than lower-exchange value HFCs. The AIM Act specifies that an allowance allocated by EPA is a limited authorization for the production or consumption of a regulated substance and does not constitute a property right.\n\nEPA has developed an HFC allowance calculator to help allowance holders understand how many allowances must be expended when they produce or import a quantity of bulk HFCs.\n\nHFC Allowance Calculator (xlsx)\n\nOverview of Allowances and Exchange Values\n\nI see that EPA has updated the global warming potentials used in the Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator. Does this change affect the exchange values under the AIM Act and how I expend allowances?\n\nNo. While EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalency Calculator has been updated to use the AR5 GWP values, the AIM Act and EPA’s implementing regulations in 40 CFR part 84 do not rely on those values. The exchange values listed in 40 CFR part 84, appendix A have not changed. These values must continue to be used to determine the number of allowances that need to be expended at the time of production or import. Entities should continue using the existing HFC Allowance Calculator to determine the number of allowances needed for production or import of regulated HFCs.\n\nHow do allowances work?\n\nEntities expend allowances in order to produce or import bulk HFCs. Producing HFCs requires expending both production allowances and consumption allowances at the time of production. Importing HFCs requires expending only consumption allowances at the time of import. This is the mechanism EPA also used to implement the ozone-depleting substances phaseout. This design helps EPA ensure that U.S. production and consumption stay within the limits established under the AIM Act and Montreal Protocol. A third category of allowances, called “application-specific allowances,” can be used to either produce or import bulk HFCs for one of the six listed applications (see list of applications at How does EPA determine allowance allocations? below). Application-specific allowances are typically conferred by the entity receiving the allowances to their supplier, who expends the allowances at the time they produce or import bulk HFCs. Allowances are valid between January 1 and December 31 of a given year and cannot be expended, transferred, or conferred after December 31 of the year for which they were issued.\n\nWho is subject to the restrictions in this rule?\n\nThis rule prohibits the 1) manufacture, 2) import, 3) sale (or offer for sale), 4) distribution (or offer for distribution), and 5) export of specific products. Any company engaged in those activities could be subject to the restrictions and reporting requirements of this rule. The rule also prohibits the installation of certain refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump systems. Any company that installs or directs the installation of such systems (e.g., the designer, or owner/operator) may be subject to the restrictions of this rule.\n\nWhen do the restrictions take effect?\n\nManufacture and import compliance dates vary depending on the subsector, ranging from January 1, 2025, to January 1, 2028. Restriction on sales, distribution, and export of products apply three years after the sector/subsector manufacture and import compliance dates, to allow for a sell-through period of previously manufactured or imported products.\n\nManufacturers and importers of products and systems that use HFCs will be subject to requirements for labeling, annual reporting, and recordkeeping. The labeling requirements take effect on the same date as the manufacture and import compliance date for each subsector. The reporting and recordkeeping requirements for all subsectors covered by this rule begin on January 1, 2025. Reference the Technology Transitions HFC Restrictions by Sector and/or final rule for more detailed information.\n\nCan EPA explain the terminology used in the Technology Transitions rule?\n\nThere are many commonly used words (“product” for example) that have particular meaning in the Technology Transitions final rule. Knowing the terminology is useful for understanding how the rule works. Certain terms, as they apply under the Technology Transitions Program, are summarized and explained here, but please consult the CFR for the actual regulatory definitions.\n\nProduct means an item which performs a function or task and is functional upon completion of manufacturing. This includes: appliances, foams, fully formulated polyols, self-contained fire suppression devices, aerosols, pressurized dispensers, and wipes. Note: this does not include components that must be assembled into a larger system in order to function.\n\nManufacture means to complete the manufacturing and assembly processes of a product (or component) such that it is ready for initial sale, distribution, or operation. Typically, this is done in a factory.\n\nComponent generally means a piece of equipment that must be assembled into a larger system in order to function. Components are not subject to the same restrictions as “products.” Where the rule uses “specified component” (generally in the context of labeling and reporting) this means condensing units, condensers, compressors, evaporator units, and evaporators.\n\nSystem means an assemblage of separate components that typically are connected and charged on site to perform a function or task. Systems are not “manufactured” under the terminology of this rule. Rather, due to their size, complexity, or building/site design, they are “installed.” A supermarket with display cases in one area and a compressor rack in a separate area connected by refrigerant tubing is a system.\n\nInstall means to complete a field-assembled system’s circuit, including charging with a full charge, such that the system can function and is ready for use for its intended purpose.\n\nEquipment is not defined in the rule but is used as a catch-all to refer to products, components, and/or systems more generally.\n\nWhat is the difference between RACHP products versus RACHP systems?\n\nThe Technology Transitions final rule restricts the manufacture and import of certain refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump (RACHP) products and the installation of certain RACHP systems.\n\nA product is functional upon leaving a factory. Examples of products include window air conditioning units, refrigerators, and stand-alone ice machines. EPA is restricting the sale, distribution, and export of products containing higher-GWP HFCs three years after the manufacture/import restriction dates.\n\nA system is assembled from multiple components and charged on site. Examples include supermarkets with a centralized compressor room and mini-split air conditioners. Components include equipment such as compressors, condensers, and display cabinets. EPA is not restricting the manufacture, import, sale, distribution, or export of components that are used to repair existing RACHP systems.\n\nCan I continue to use my air conditioner?\n\nYes, you can continue to use your air conditioner (or aerosol, or foam, or any existing products or systems covered by this rule). The Technology Transitions final rule does not limit the use of any existing product or system. This rule is forward looking and restricts new products and systems from being placed on the market or entering operation. This rule was designed specifically so that owners of refrigeration and air conditioning systems and products can continue to use and repair legacy systems throughout their useful life.\n\nCan I repair my existing residential air conditioning, supermarket, ice rink, etc. that uses higher-GWP HFCs?\n\nYes, you can continue to repair your existing refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump system. This includes replacing a major component like a condensing unit or compressor. New components may also continue to be manufactured and imported to allow existing systems to be maintained for the length of their useful life. However, the availability of HFCs and components may lessen over time as HFCs are phased down.\n\nWhere can I get information on substitute refrigerants?\n\nSources of information on substitute refrigerants include the EPA’s Significant New Alternatives Policy Program, as well as the United Nations Environment Programme Ozone Secretariat’s Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) reports.\n\nWhat are the labeling requirements established by the Technology Transitions Program?\n\nFor regulated sectors and subsectors, certain information is required on labels for products, specified components, and systems that contain HFCs. The timeline for labeling products aligns with the sector-based restrictions, with requirements for certain sectors beginning January 1, 2025.\n\nSpecific labeling requirements vary based on the type of equipment, but typically include the date of manufacture, the intended HFC(s) or blend(s), the charge size, the date of charge, and/or other details. Physical labels must be in English, affixed to the outside of the product, visible and legible, displayed in a contrasting color, and able to withstand outdoor exposure, where applicable.\n\nSee the final rule for detailed information on the labeling requirements.\n\nDo all aerosols, foams, and RACHP equipment have to be labeled?\n\nNo. Only products and equipment that contain an HFC must be labeled in accordance with this rule. Many products in these sectors do not use HFCs and do not need to be labeled. Companies may voluntarily choose to indicate on a label that it does not use HFCs.\n\nWhat are the reporting requirements for the Technology Transitions Program?\n\nFor regulated sectors and subsectors, any entity that manufactures or imports products or components that use HFCs is subject to recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Covered entities will register and report electronically. Reporting requirements for all subsectors begin with 2025 data. Manufacturers and importers must report 2025 data by March 31, 2026, and annually thereafter. Reporting is not required of entities that only sell or distribute equipment or install or operate new refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump systems. See the final rule for detailed information on the reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\nThe Technology Transitions rule references the fire suppression sector. Did EPA establish any restrictions for this sector?\n\nThe use of HFCs in the fire suppression sector is not restricted in the final Technology Transitions rule. The Agency may consider additional HFC use restrictions in the future, but at this time there are no restrictions or requirements on the fire suppression sector under the Technology Transitions Program.\n\nAre residential or household stand-alone ice makers covered by the residential refrigeration sector restrictions?\n\nThe Technology Transitions Rule inadvertently included \"household ice makers\" as an example of a product within the residential refrigeration subsector. EPA corrected this reference in an interim final rule that states that stand-alone residential or household ice makers are not subject to the Technology Transitions restrictions. For more information, please reference the interim final rule.\n\nAre semiconductor manufacturers exempt from this final rule?\n\nHFC uses that are receiving application-specific allowances consistent with 40 CFR 84.13(a), including the etching of semiconductor material or wafers and the cleaning of chemical vapor deposition chambers within the semiconductor manufacturing sector, are not covered by this rule. Other HFC-containing equipment (such as chillers or industrial process refrigeration systems) used in semiconductor manufacturing outside of processes for which application-specific allowances are provided may be subject to this rule.\n\nCan I re-import equipment such as self-contained chillers or heavy-duty vehicles that are sent overseas for use or repair?\n\nYes. Privately-owned equipment (whether owned by an individual or a company) that is sent abroad can return to the United States and is not subject to the restrictions that apply to the import of used products. EPA’s restriction covers the activities of entities bringing shipments of used products into the country for subsequent sale or distribution.\n\nQuestions on Products\n\nWhat is a “product” in the refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump sector?\n\nGenerally speaking, a product is a type of appliance with a sealed refrigerant loop that simply needs to be plugged in, mounted, or hooked to a water line, to work. For example, window air conditioning units, residential dehumidifiers, packaged terminal air conditioners, commercial freezers, and vending machines are examples of products. If you need a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning technician to assemble and/or charge with refrigerant, it’s not a product. This follows the same interpretation previously used under the Clean Air Act (e.g., Section 608) and has been used for decades.\n\nIs a condensing unit a product? What if it is charged at the factory?\n\nA condensing unit is not a product for purposes of the Technology Transitions Program. It is a component. Whether it is pre-charged or field charged, it must be connected to an evaporator to serve its intended purpose.\n\nIs a chiller a product?\n\nIt depends. A chiller may be a product if all portions of the HFC refrigerant loop are connected and charged at the factory (thus requiring only connection to an electrical source and water source on site). In other instances, a chiller may be one component of the HFC refrigerant loop that is assembled on site. How it is considered under the Technology Transitions program depends on the circumstances of its design and use.\n\nIs an ice machine a product?\n\nIt depends. Self-contained ice machines are considered products if they that have all components of the refrigeration circuit enclosed within the unit and are fully charged at the factory. Ice machines that have a refrigerant line connected to a remote condensing unit are not products.\n\nIs a car air conditioner a product? Is a passenger car a product?\n\nThe motor vehicle air conditioner (MVAC) is a product subject to the rule. Because the MVAC is incorporated into the car, the car is subject to the same restrictions on manufacture, import, sale, and export as the MVAC itself.\n\nIs a kitchen wine cooler a product?\n\nYes.\n\nIs a thermal expansion valve a product? Is it considered under the Technology Transitions Program?\n\nNo, a thermal expansion valve is not considered a product under the Technology Transitions Program. Thermal expansion valves do not use HFCs as a refrigerant and are not subject to the restrictions in this rule.\n\nQuestions on Systems\n\nWhat is a system?\n\nA system for purposes of the Technology Transitions Program is an assemblage of separate components constituting the refrigerant loop that typically are connected and charged with refrigerant in the field. Generally speaking, if you need a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning technician to assemble and/or charge with refrigerant, it’s a system.\n\nWhat are the main parts of a system?\n\nThe design of systems vary widely but all operate under the principle of using a circuit of refrigerant to transfer heat from one side of the system to another. For purposes of the Technology Transitions Program, five components are specifically identified: compressors, condensing units or condensers, and evaporator units or evaporators. Refrigerant tubing and thermal expansion valves are excluded from the requirements of the rule. Electronics, fan motors, ducts, and other parts outside the refrigerant loop are also excluded from the requirements of the rule.\n\nHomeowner Questions on Residential Air Conditioner Split Systems\n\nMy R-410A unitary air conditioner condensing unit broke. Do I need to buy a whole new system with the lower GWP refrigerant or can I replace the faulty component?\n\nHomeowners can maintain and repair their systems throughout the useful life of the equipment. A homeowner can replace a faulty component (e.g., condensing unit, indoor coil, other smaller parts) with a similar R-410A component. After January 1, 2025, if a whole new system is installed it must use lower GWP refrigerant.\n\nWhat is a new system?\n\nFor residential air conditioner split systems, a new system would be installed in a newly constructed home. A new system would also be installed if both the condensing unit and indoor coil are replaced together. The condensing unit contains the condenser coil and compressor and the indoor coil is the evaporator.\n\nIf I leave the existing refrigerant lines but replace the condensing unit and indoor coil, is it a new system?\n\nYes. Refrigerant lines are generally not removed when replacing the other mechanical components of a system. Therefore, even if refrigerant lines are unchanged, replacing all the other components would result in a new system for purposes of the Technology Transitions Program.\n\nCan I replace the condensing unit and replace the indoor coil at a later time?\n\nYes. Systems may be repaired over time. Factors for homeowners to consider when deciding to repair or transition to a new system using a lower-GWP refrigerant include availability of components, energy efficiency, and total maintenance costs.\n\nI am designing a new house/addition to an existing house - what system can I install?\n\nAny system first charged with refrigerant after January 1, 2025, (i.e., a newly installed system) must use refrigerant with a GWP less than 700. Note that the compliance date applies to the day the system is charged. The GWP limits do not apply to any new system installed before that date.\n\nDoes EPA intend to make changes to the ban on installing new residential heat pump and air conditioning systems using refrigerants with GWPs higher than 700 as of January 1, 2025, and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems using refrigerants with GWPs higher than 700 as of January 1, 2026?\n\nEPA understands that for new residential construction, including both single-family and multi-family dwellings, where builders order heating and cooling equipment well in advance of knowing the exact date of installation, the imminent compliance date has raised concerns about system components that may already be in the distribution chain. On December 26, 2023, EPA published an interim final rule to address concerns regarding the January 1, 2025, installation compliance date for residential heat pump and air conditioning systems by amending the final regulation to allow for installation of higher-GWP HFC equipment manufactured or imported before January 1, 2025, to be installed until January 1, 2026. Separately, EPA published a proposed rule on June 26, 2024, to address concerns regarding the January 1, 2026, installation compliance date for variable refrigerant flow systems. The proposed rule would allow new VRF systems using HFCs with a GWP above 700 to be installed until January 1, 2027, so long as all components are manufactured or imported prior to Jan 1, 2026. For more information on both of these actions, please reference the Regulatory Actions for Technology Transitions webpage.\n\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturer Questions on Residential Air Conditioner Split Systems\n\nNote: Many questions in this section use R-410A residential air conditioner split systems as an example. The concepts presented are also applicable to commercial refrigeration systems or other refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump subsectors, though the dates may be different.\n\nCan I manufacture residential air conditioner condensing units designed to use R-410A after January 1, 2025?\n\nYes. All parts of an R-410A residential air conditioning unit (e.g., inside unit, outside unit, line-sets) can continue to be manufactured to service existing systems.\n\nCan I import residential air conditioner condensing units designed to use R-410A after January 1, 2025?\n\nYes.\n\nIs there a date when I can no longer sell condensing units designed to use R-410A?\n\nNo. Components are not subject to the prohibitions on sale, distribution, and export.\n\nDo condensing units manufactured or imported for servicing need to be dry-shipped or can they be charged with R-410A at the factory?\n\nComponents can be dry-shipped, fully charged, or partially charged.\n\nWhat restrictions apply to an original equipment manufacturer or importer of residential air conditioning condensing units using R-410A?\n\nOriginal equipment manufacturers and importers of components are subject to reporting and labeling requirements. Original equipment manufacturers and importers of products (discussed below) are subject to restrictions on manufacture, import, export, and sale, in addition to the reporting and labeling requirements.\n\nDo I need to label equipment that was manufactured before January 1, 2025, and placed in inventory?\n\nNo. Labels are required for components and products that are manufactured or imported after January 1, 2025. Existing inventory at that date does not need to be relabeled.\n\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturer Questions on Products\n\nNote: These questions use packaged terminal air conditioners as an example. The concepts presented are also applicable to products in other refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump subsectors such as stand-alone retail food refrigerators or self-contained refrigerated transport equipment, as well as foams and aerosols though the dates may be different.\n\nI manufacture packaged terminal air conditioners overseas that use R-410When must I stop importing them?\n\nThe import of R-410A residential and light commercial air conditioning products is prohibited starting January 1, 2025. Lower-GWP refrigerants would be required for air conditioners and packaged terminal air conditioners after that date.\n\nCan I sell packaged terminal air conditioners manufactured overseas using R-410A that have been imported before January 1, 2025?\n\nYes. Products not meeting the new GWP limits can continue to be sold for three years after the import restriction date. Thus, packaged terminal air conditioners using R-410A may be sold, distributed, or exported until January 1, 2028.\n\nCan I tranship products through the United States to other countries in North America?\n\nYes. As with bulk HFCs, products or components can be transhipped from a foreign country of origin through the United States or its territories to a second foreign country of final destination as long as the shipment does not enter U.S. commerce. A transhipment as it moves through the United States or its territories cannot be repackaged, sorted, or otherwise changed in condition.\n\nI make packaged terminal air conditioners in the United States using R-410A. When must I stop manufacturing them?\n\nThe manufacture of R-410A residential and light commercial air conditioning products is prohibited starting January 1, 2025.\n\nCan I continue to make packaged terminal air conditioners in the United States using R-410A provided they are exported?\n\nNo. The manufacture of packaged terminal air conditioners using R-410A is prohibited starting January 1, 2025, regardless of whether they are for the domestic or export market. Packaged terminal air conditioners using R-410A manufactured before January 1, 2025, may be sold, distributed, or exported until January 1, 2028. New packaged terminal air conditioners manufactured after January 1, 2025, must use a lower-GWP refrigerant.\n\nI make packaged terminal air conditioners in the United States using reclaimed R-410May I continue to make them provided I only use reclaimed refrigerant?\n\nNo. The manufacture of packaged terminal air conditioners using R-410A is prohibited January 1, 2025, regardless of whether they are charged with virgin or reclaimed refrigerant.\n\nI make packaged terminal air conditioners in the United States using R-32. How does the rule apply to me?\n\nR-32 meets the GWP limit for the residential and light commercial air conditioner subsector and thus such products can continue to be manufactured, sold, distributed, and exported. Starting January 1, 2025, manufacturers and importers must keep records and report certain manufacturing data to EPA by March 31, 2026. Also starting January 1, 2025, manufacturers must affix a label indicating the use of an HFC.\n\nI make refrigerators in the United States using isobutane as a refrigerant but with HFC polyurethane insulation foam. How does the rule apply to me?\n\nIsobutane is not an HFC and thus is not subject to the restrictions of this rule. Starting January 1, 2025, an HFC blowing agent for appliance insulation foam must have a GWP less than 150. If an HFC is used as a blowing agent, starting January 1, 2025, manufacturers must keep records and report certain manufacturing data to EPA by March 31, 2026. Also starting January 1, 2025, manufacturers must affix a label indicating the use of an HFC.\n\nI manufacture a product that uses HFCs but not as a refrigerant, propellant, or foam blowing agent. How does the rule apply to me?\n\nYour product would not be subject to the rule. This rule prohibits the use of HFCs in specific sectors and subsectors. Products used for a purpose not covered by the rule are still allowed. For example, products using HFCs as a fire-suppression agent may continue to be manufactured, imported, exported, or sold. None of the recordkeeping, reporting, or labeling requirements would apply. Thermal expansion valves are similar products that are not subject to the rule.\n\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturer Questions on Motor Vehicle Air Conditioning\n\nWhat is the compliance date for the restrictions for using HFCs with a GWP above the 150 GWP threshold use in light-duty Motor Vehicle Air Conditioning (MVAC)?\n\nEffective October 24, 2024, a regulated substance, or a blend containing a regulated substance, with a global warming potential of 150 or greater can no longer be used for Model Year 2025 and subsequent model year light-duty passenger cars and trucks (vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating less than 8,500 lbs) that are manufactured or imported into the United States.\n\nHow does the Technology Transitions rule impact selling, purchasing, importing, or exporting used motor vehicles?\n\nThis rule does not restrict sale, purchasing, import, or export of used motor vehicles.\n\nWe understand that for the U.S. market, currently the vast majority of light-duty motor vehicle manufacturers are using HFO-1234yf as a refrigerant in their MVAC systems. Will manufacturers of light-duty vehicles that use non-HFC refrigerants including HFO-1234yf for MVAC be subject to reporting and labeling requirements established under the Technology Transitions rule?\n\nNo, only MVAC systems using HFCs are subject to these new reporting and labeling requirements. However, other requirements, including the labeling requirements established under the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program, continue to apply to MVACs using both HFC and non-HFC refrigerants.\n\nDistributor Questions\n\nNote: Many questions in this section use R-410A residential air conditioner split systems as an example. The concepts presented are also applicable to commercial refrigeration systems or other refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump subsectors, though the dates may be different.\n\nCan I sell residential air conditioner units using R-410A after January 1, 2025?\n\nThe sale of condensing units, indoor coils, indoor air handling units, and other parts is allowed to service legacy systems.\n\nHow do I know whether the components I distribute are going to be installed into a new system (not allowed) or to service a legacy system (allowed)?\n\nOriginal equipment manufacturers and distributors of components are typically not responsible for the installation of the equipment that they sell. Generally speaking, the responsible party would be the company that installs or directs the installation of the system. This may be different for complex and custom-designed refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump systems such as supermarkets and industrial process refrigeration if the distributor or original equipment manufacturer is involved in the design of the system.\n\nDo I need to label equipment that was manufactured before January 1, 2025, but held in our inventory?\n\nNo. The labeling requirements apply to original equipment manufacturers for components and products that are manufactured or imported after January 1, 2025.\n\nDo I need to maintain records or provide reports to EPA about the equipment I sell?\n\nThe recordkeeping and reporting requirements apply to manufacturers and importers of products and the following five components: condensing units, condensers, compressors, evaporator units, and evaporators. Distributors that are not importers do not need to keep records of sales or provide reports to EPA.\n\nDo I need allowances to import products or components containing HFCs?\n\nNo. Allowances are required for the import of bulk HFCs, not products containing HFCs.\n\nDo I need prior authorization from EPA to import products or components containing HFCs?\n\nNo.\n\nTechnician Questions\n\nNote: Many questions in this section use R-410A residential air conditioner split systems as an example. The concepts presented are also applicable to commercial refrigeration systems or other refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump subsectors, though the dates may be different.\n\nCan I use existing R-410A components (either used or held in inventory) to build a new R-410A system after January 1, 2025?\n\nNo. No new system may be installed using HFC refrigerants about the GWP limit after the compliance date, even if the components were manufactured prior to that date.\n\nCan I replace a broken R-410A outdoor condensing unit with one that uses a lower GWP refrigerant?\n\nThe Technology Transitions rule does not address this issue and it may be possible depending on the circumstances. EPA’s Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) Program and industry standards prohibit the use of flammable or mildly flammable refrigerant such as HFC-32 or R-454B in systems that were not designed to use them. There may also be engineering and design considerations that could prevent the use of non-flammable refrigerants (e.g., pressures).\n\nCan I replace a broken R-22 outdoor condensing unit with an R-410A condensing unit?\n\nNo. In this situation the R-22 indoor coil would not be compatible with R-410A due to the difference in pressures. R-410A is also not listed as acceptable by the SNAP Program as a retrofit for R-22 systems. Therefore, the whole system would need to be replaced, and under the Technology Transitions rule, replacement of the system triggers the GWP limit.\n\nQuestions on Supermarket Systems\n\nNote: These questions use R-404A or R-407A supermarket systems as an example. The concepts presented are also applicable to other commercial refrigeration systems, industrial process refrigeration, or other refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump subsectors, though the dates may be different.\n\nCan I replace a part or component on my R-404A or R-407A supermarket system in my store after January 1, 2027?\n\nYes. Stores can maintain and repair legacy systems throughout the useful life of the equipment.\n\nCan replacement components manufactured prior to the GWP limit effective date be used for maintenance?\n\nReplacement components, regardless of manufacture date, can be used for maintenance.\n\nCan display cases be replaced with like product in 2028 with cases that were built in 2027 (or 2020)?\n\nDisplay cases are components and can be replaced regardless of manufacture date.\n\nCan display cases be replaced with different cases in 2028, removing three open cases and installing six cases with doors to reduce energy consumption.\n\nMore energy efficient display cases may be installed so long as the cooling capacity of the system in BTU/hr is not increased. Increasing the cooling capacity of the system triggers the requirements of a new system.\n\nCan compressors be replaced in 2028 with compressors that were built in 2027 (or 2020) as a repair?\n\nReplacement components, regardless of manufacture date, can be used for maintenance.\n\nIs there a point at which replacing components triggers the GWP limits for new systems?\n\nYes. Replacing 75% or more of the evaporators (by number) and 100 percent of the compressor racks, condensers, and connected evaporator loads of an existing system would trigger the requirements of new systems.\n\nCan I use compressors, condensers, evaporators, and cases with a date of manufacture prior to Dec 31, 2026, to install a new system that is subsequently charged with R-448?\n\nThe rule does not allow for the installation of new systems after the effective date that exceeds the GWP limit, regardless of the manufacture date of the components.\n\nCan I retrofit my R-404A or R-407A supermarket system to use R-448A or R-449A after January 1, 2027?\n\nYes. The Technology Transitions rule does not address the retrofit of legacy systems.\n\nQuestions on Petitions to Restrict HFCs in Technologies\n\nWhat are petitions?\n\nAny person may petition EPA to restrict the use of HFCs in sectors or subsectors. Once EPA receives a petition under subsection (i), the AIM Act directs the Agency to evaluate the petition and to grant or deny the petition within 180 days of receipt. Find more information about the petition process on the Overview of the Petitions Process page.\n\nHow does EPA evaluate petitions?\n\nEPA must make the evaluation of a petition available to the public. Petitions may be found on EPA’s Technology Transitions web site. Under subsection (i) of the AIM Act, EPA must evaluate petitions using the following factors:\n\nThe best available data.\n\nThe availability of substitutes for use of the HFC that is the subject of the petition, in a sector or subsector, taking into account technological achievability, commercial demands, affordability for residential and small business consumers, safety, consumer costs, building codes, appliance efficiency standards, contractor training costs, and other relevant factors, including the quantities of HFCs available from reclaiming, prior production, or prior import.\n\nOverall economic costs and environmental impacts, as compared to historical trends.\n\nThe remaining phase-down period for HFCs under the allowance allocation program, if applicable.\n\n4. Proposed Rule – Management of Certain HFCs and Substitutes under Subsection (h) of the AIM Act\n\nGeneral and Applicability Questions\n\nWhat does this rule under subsection (h) of the AIM Act propose?\n\nIn accordance with the AIM Act, EPA is proposing regulations to control, where appropriate, certain practices, processes, or activities regarding the servicing, repair, disposal, or installation of equipment that involves HFCs or their substitutes. This proposed rule would establish an emissions reduction and reclamation program for the management of certain HFCs and their substitutes that would include provisions that apply to both new and existing equipment in certain sectors and subsectors. The proposed regulations are intended to maximize reclaiming and minimize the release of regulated substances from equipment and ensuring the safety of technicians and consumers.\n\nWho may be affected by this proposed emissions and reclamation program?\n\nCompanies that may be affected by this rule include those that own, operate, service, repair, recycle, dispose, or install equipment containing HFCs or their substitutes, as well as those that recover, recycle, or reclaim HFCs or their substitutes. Affected companies may also include those that manufacture or sell or otherwise distribute equipment containing HFCs and their substitutes.\n\nCan I continue to use my current appliance (e.g., residential air conditioning system)?\n\nYes. The proposed rule under subsection (h) would not prohibit the use of any type of appliance or equipment that contains HFCs or their substitutes.\n\nHow are ice rinks covered in the proposed rule?\n\nIce rinks are included in the proposed definition for “industrial process refrigeration.” Proposed provisions, including for leak repair and use of reclaimed HFCs, are the same as industrial process refrigeration.\n\nWould technicians who have been certified under Clean Air Act Sections 608 or 609 need to be re-certified?\n\nNo. This proposed rule under subsection (h) would not require re-certification for technicians who have been previously certified under the applicable sections of the Clean Air Act (CAA). However, the proposed rule includes an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking section and requests comments on any such potential recertification or continued training requirements. Subsection (h) of the AIM Act, among other purposes, provides EPA authority to promulgate certain regulations for the purposes of ensuring the safety of technicians and consumers, and EPA intends to review comments received and consider options for potential future rulemakings.\n\nQuestions on Leak Repair\n\nWhat appliances are subject to the proposed leak repair provisions?\n\nIf finalized as proposed, appliances that contain 15 pounds or more of a refrigerant that contains an HFC or a substitute for an HFC that has a GWP above 53 would be subject to the proposed leak repair requirements. These would include appliances that are used in the refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump sector (e.g., unitary splits, chillers, industrial process refrigeration). However, the proposed rule would exempt appliances used in the residential and light commercial air conditioning subsector.\n\nIf finalized as proposed, appliances that would be subject to the proposed leak repair requirements that contain 50 or more pounds of a refrigerant that contains an HFC or a substitute for an HFC that has a GWP above 53 would be required to comply as of the effective date of a final rule (typically 60 days after the final rule is published in the Federal Register). Appliances that contain between 15 and 50 pounds of a refrigerant that contains an HFC or a substitute for an HFC with a GWP above 53 would be required to comply as of one year after the publication of a final rule.\n\nWhat types of appliances would be required to have an automatic leak detection (ALD) system installed?\n\nEPA is proposing that commercial refrigeration or industrial process refrigeration appliances that contain 1,500 pounds or more of a refrigerant that contains an HFC or a substitute for an HFC with a GWP above 53 would be required to have an ALD system installed on the appliance. Appliances used in comfort cooling would not be required to have an ALD system installed, regardless of the charge size.\n\nIf finalized as proposed, commercial refrigeration and industrial process refrigeration appliances installed after publication of a final rule would be required to have an ALD system installed within 30 days of installation. Commercial refrigeration and industrial process refrigeration appliances installed 60 days before publication of a final rule would be required to have an ALD system installed one year after publication of the final rule.\n\nHow do the proposed leak repair provisions address equipment with multiple circuits?\n\nThe proposed leak repair provisions would apply to appliances that contain 15 pounds or more of a refrigerant that contains an HFC or a substitute for an HFC that has a GWP above 53. As proposed, the definition for “refrigerant-containing appliance” describes that for a system with multiple circuits, each independent circuit is considered a separate appliance.\n\nIf a person chooses to retrofit an appliance, do leaks need to be repaired?\n\nAmong other proposed requirements, when retrofitting an appliance, the owner or operator would be required to repair all identified leaks. As proposed, a retrofit would also require converting the current refrigerant in an appliance to one with a lower GWP.\n\nQuestions on Reclamation\n\nWhat is the proposed standard for reclaimed HFCs?\n\nThe proposed rule under subsection (h) would require that reclaimed HFCs may contain no more than 15 percent newly produced (also known as virgin) HFCs, by weight. Where a reclaimed substance is a blend that contains both HFC(s) and substitute(s) for an HFC, the proposed rule only would require that the HFC portion(s) of the blend is limited to 15 percent by weight of virgin material. This rule did not propose a limit on the amount of virgin non-HFC material used in of a reclaimed HFC/HFC substitute blend or a reclaimed HFC substitute.\n\nHow many reclaimers are in the United States?\n\nThere are approximately 50 EPA-certified reclaimers currently operating in the United States. This is a long-standing nationwide network of reclaimers that can support implementation of the proposed rule and increase the quantity of HFCs reclaimed in the United States. These reclaimers currently receive recovered HFCs for reclamation from entities such as refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump equipment distributors, commercial users (e.g., supermarkets), scrap yards, technicians, and contractors and they distribute reclaimed HFCs back to the market through direct engagement with their customers and existing supply chains.\n\nWhich subsectors would be required to use reclaimed HFCs for the initial charge?\n\nBeginning January 1, 2028, EPA is proposing that reclaimed HFCs be used in the initial charge of refrigerant-containing equipment in the following subsectors:\n\nresidential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pumps;\n\ncold storage warehouses;\n\nindustrial process refrigeration;\n\nstand-alone retail food refrigeration;\n\nsupermarket systems;\n\nrefrigerated transport; and\n\nautomatic commercial ice makers.\n\nWhat does EPA mean by “initial charge” related to the proposed requirements for using reclaimed HFCs?\n\nThe proposed provisions for the use of reclaimed HFCs for the initial charge of equipment in certain refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump (RACHP) subsectors beginning in 2028 would apply when the equipment is first charged with refrigerant. As recognized in the proposal, for some equipment, the initial charge with refrigerant occurs at the factory before the equipment is sold or distributed, while for other equipment, the initial charge occurs in the field. Regardless of whether the equipment is factory- or field-charged, equipment that would be subject to these requirements would be required to use reclaimed HFCs for the initial charge. EPA intends in this proposed rule to provide a level playing field by treating domestic and imported equipment the same.\n\nWhich subsectors would be required to use reclaimed HFCs in servicing and/or repair?\n\nBeginning January 1, 2028, EPA is proposing that reclaimed HFCs be used in the servicing and/or repair of refrigerant-containing equipment in the following subsectors:\n\nstand-alone retail food refrigeration;\n\nsupermarket systems;\n\nrefrigerated transport; and\n\nautomatic commercial ice makers.\n\nIs EPA proposing requirements for using reprocessed refrigerant in the servicing of motor vehicle air conditioners (MVAC)?\n\nNot at this time. EPA is not currently proposing requirements focused on implementing subsection (h)(2)(B) of the AIM Act for MVAC servicing facilities that currently reclaim or recycle recovered MVAC refrigerant in this rulemaking. EPA understands that under current industry practices, a variety of activities might occur once refrigerant has been recovered from an MVAC system. For example, in some situations, MVAC servicing facilities recover refrigerant from the MVAC, recycle it consistent with EPA’s regulations under Clean Air Act Section 609 and return the recycled refrigerant to the same MVAC for continued use by the same owner. As described in the proposal, EPA intends to issue proposed regulations for this sector at a later date.\n\nWas the Technology Transitions final rule factored into the analysis on the estimated demand for reclaimed HFCs in certain RACHP subsectors that would be required to use reclaimed HFCs?\n\nIn a technical support document, EPA estimated demand for reclaimed HFCs in the proposed RACHP subsectors that would be required to use reclaimed HFCs beginning in 2028. The technical support document is available in the docket for the proposed rulemaking and is titled “Updated Draft Report – Analysis of the U.S. Hydrofluorocarbon Reclamation Market: Stakeholders, Drivers, and Practices.” The technical support document provides estimates for the covered RACHP subsectors for initial charge and servicing/repair, as applicable. As noted in the document, the analysis and estimates do not take into account potential impacts from the Technology Transitions rule under subsection (i) of the AIM Act. The requirements under subsection (i) were not yet finalized when EPA conducted the analysis for estimated demand, and thus were not taken into consideration. EPA may consider updating this draft report in the development of any final rule.\n\nQuestions on Fire Suppression\n\nWhat are the proposed requirements for equipment in the fire suppression sector?\n\nThe proposed rule under subsection (h) would establish requirements for the servicing, repair, disposal, or installation of fire suppression equipment containing HFCs to minimize releases of HFCs. EPA is proposing that recycled HFCs be used for the initial charge or servicing and/or repair of fire suppression equipment, and additional provisions for technician training in the fire suppression sector.\n\nStarting January 1, 2025, the proposed rule would require that the initial charge and the servicing and/or repair of fire suppression equipment, including both total flooding systems and streaming applications, must be done with recycled HFCs.\n\nWhat are the proposed requirements for recordkeeping and reporting for the fire suppression sector?\n\nEPA is proposing certain requirements for recordkeeping and reporting for the fire suppression sector. Specifically, EPA is proposing that the covered entities report annually by February 14 of each year, covering the prior year's activity from January 1 through December 31:\n\nThe quantity of material (the combined mass of regulated substance and contaminants) by regulated substance broken out by sold, recovered, recycled, and virgin for the purpose of installation of new equipment and servicing of fire suppression equipment;\n\nThe total mass of each regulated substance broken out by sold, recovered, recycled, and virgin; and\n\nThe total mass of waste products sent for disposal, along with information about the disposal facility if waste is not processed by the reporting entity.\n\nRelevant reporting entities that would be covered under this proposed requirement include entities that perform first fill of equipment, service (e.g., recharge) equipment, and/or recycle regulated substances, such as equipment manufacturers, distributors, agent suppliers or installers that recycle regulated substances. EPA is proposing that these records related to the fire suppression sector be maintained for three years.\n\nWhat are the proposed training requirements for the fire suppression sector?\n\nThe proposed rule would require that applicable entities provide training regarding HFC emissions reduction, starting January 1, 2025. EPA is proposing this as a one-time training requirement. The proposed training requirements would be applicable to fire suppression technicians who service, repair, install, or dispose of fire suppression equipment containing HFCs.\n\nQuestions on Cylinders and Container Tracking\n\nWhat are the proposed requirements for disposable cylinders?\n\nEPA is not proposing to prohibit the use of disposable cylinders for HFCs. The proposed rule under subsection (h) would require that disposable cylinders that contain HFCs and that have been used for the servicing, repair, or installation of refrigerant-containing equipment or fire suppression equipment must be sent to an EPA-certified reclaimer or a fire suppressant recycler. Further, EPA is proposing to require that these entities (i.e., reclaimers and fire suppressant recyclers) must remove all HFCs, including any remaining amount after the cylinders are considered empty for servicing, repair, and installation purposes (i.e., the heel), prior to the disposal of these cylinders. EPA is proposing a compliance date of January 1, 2025, for these requirements.\n\nHow would the proposed tracking system for containers of certain HFCs work?\n\nThe proposed rule under subsection (h) would establish a container tracking system for containers of certain HFCs. EPA is proposing to require machine-readable tracking identifiers [e.g., quick-response (QR) codes, or another type of identifier] on all containers of HFCs, whether used neat or in a blend, that could be used for the servicing, repair, or installation of refrigerant-containing equipment or fire suppression equipment. This would apply to both refillable and disposable cylinders. Any entity that produces, imports, reclaims, recycles for fire suppression uses, repackages, or fills into a container HFCs, reclaimed HFCs, or recycled HFCs would be required to register in the tracking system to generate machine-readable tracking identifiers. Any entity that purchases, sells, or distributes HFCs, or offers HFCs for sale or distribution, would also be required to register in the tracking system to be able to update the movement of such HFCs.\n\nQuestions on Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Refrigerant Recycling Alternative Standards\n\nWhat are the proposed changes to the RCRA hazardous waste standards for ignitable spent refrigerants?\n\nEPA is proposing alternative RCRA hazardous waste requirements for certain substitute refrigerants that exhibit the hazardous characteristic of ignitibility in order to encourage recycling and decrease the potential for releases of ignitable spent refrigerants. The proposed changes would exclude certain HFCs and non-HFC substitute refrigerants from certain hazardous waste requirements if they are sent to an EPA-certified reclaimer under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 608 and meet the other requirements of the alternative standards.\n\nIs there a separate Federal Register Notice for the proposed changes to the RCRA hazardous waste standards?\n\nThere is no separate notice for the proposed regulatory changes for RCRA. Section IV.G of the preamble and the proposed RCRA regulatory language for 40 CFR parts 261, 262, 266, 270, and 271, describe the entirety of the RCRA proposed changes. If finalized as proposed, the new alternative RCRA standard for ignitable spent refrigerants that are recycled for reuse would be codified in 40 CFR part 266 subpart Q.\n\nWhich refrigerants would be affected by the proposed RCRA alternative standards, if finalized?\n\nEPA is proposing to limit the alternative standards to lower flammability substitutes (i.e., Class 1, 2 and 2L under ASHRAE 34). As proposed, higher flammability refrigerants (i.e., Class 3) would continue to be subject to all applicable requirements of 40 CFR parts 262 through 270 when recovered (i.e., removed from an appliance and stored in an external container) and/or disposed of. RCRA regulation of spent refrigerants is triggered by the hazardous characteristic of ignitability. The RCRA ignitability characteristic does not list specific chemicals; however, in general, refrigerants with a flammability Class 2 or 3 under ASHRAE 34 are expected to be ignitable under RCRA, and even refrigerants that do not exhibit the characteristic of ignitability as a virgin material could become ignitable with use.\n\nWhat requirements would reclaimers need to meet to accept ignitable spent refrigerants under the proposed RCRA alternative standards? Would these reclaimers need to get RCRA permits?\n\nIf the rule is finalized as proposed, current CAA Section 608-certified reclaimers would not need a RCRA permit, as long as the requirements of the rule are met. Refrigerant reclaimers that accept ignitable spent refrigerants would have two additional requirements (beyond their existing CAA obligations) under the new alternative RCRA standards: (1) no speculative accumulation (page 88 FR 72275), and (2) emergency preparedness and response (page 88 FR 72276).\n\nIs there a weight threshold or limit required to trigger the proposed RCRA alternative standards?\n\nThere is no minimum weight threshold for the proposed RCRA alternative standards, and, if the rule is finalized as proposed, the RCRA alternative standards explicitly would apply to Very Small Quantity Generator waste (page 88 FR 72276).\n\nHow would collectors and distributers of ignitable spent refrigerants be affected by the proposed RCRA alternative standards?\n\nCollectors and distributers of ignitable spent refrigerants would have no additional obligations under the proposed RCRA standards beyond their current obligations under the CAA. Please reference the proposed regulatory language at 40 CFR 266.602 (page 88 FR 72311).\n\nHow would the proposed RCRA standards apply to incidental releases of refrigerants?\n\nEPA considers incidental releases of spent refrigerant that occur during the maintenance, service, and repair of appliances subject to CAA section 608 (which would include venting from appliances of refrigerants that are exempt from the venting prohibition under 40 CFR 82.154(a)), generally not to be disposal of a hazardous waste under RCRA. (88 FR 72274) The venting prohibition under CAA section 608 and its implementing regulations continues to apply, except for certain refrigerants in specified end-uses that are explicitly exempt from the venting prohibition per 40 CFR 82.154(a).\n\n5.
