        "text": "PEAK Scientific Instruments Ltd Privacy Policy\n\nBelow are the types of information we collect about PEAK Scientific customers, partners and suppliers and the ways in which we may collect, store, use and share that information.\n\nWe know that you take your privacy seriously, that is why we have written this privacy policy to be fully transparent with you about how we process your information and how you can control the information we collect about you.\n\nWays we may collect your personal information\n\nWe only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so – for example, to effectively deliver our product and services, to communicate with you, or to help us improve customer experience, develop better products or better serve our partners.\n\nThese are the main ways in which we may collect information about you:\n\n• If you contact us directly via our websites or via our sales office telephone numbers to request information about our products and services.\n\n• If you buy a product or service directly from us.\n\n• If you participate or respond to our direct marketing promotions or activities (e.g. filling out a response card or survey at an exhibition or via social media).\n\n• Your contact details are passed to us from a third-party partner/reseller with your prior permission.\n\n• If your generator serial number and contact information is transferred to PEAK Scientific while you are having your generator serviced, repaired or replaced.\n\n• If, with your permission, other PEAK Scientific business entities or partners transfer your personal data to us.\n\n• If we acquired your personal data from a third party media company or event organizer (eg. Magazine or exhibition) with your prior permission.\n\nNow let’s go over the information that we collect and what we may need it for and do with it.\n\nWhat information may be collected about you\n\nIt’s probably no surprise that we collect and securely store information that you provide directly or indirectly to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:\n\nBasic Account Information\n\nWe ask for basic information from you in order to give you a localized response or service. For example, we require to know your location to put you in contact with your nearest PEAK office or partner representative and we ask for other information like your application and serial number (if looking for technical support or service contracts) but we do not require this information if you would not like to provide it. If you prefer to withhold information, please note our ability to adequately respond to your request or support you may be limited.\n\nTransaction and Billing Information\n\nIf you buy something from us–a gas generator, service plan or spare part for example–you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, bank details or other financial information, place of work and personal contact information including telephone number and email address.\n\nOur Websites\n\nWe will use only relevant information supplied to us when you complete any contact forms, or use the live chat service on our website, to help us respond to your inquiry and monitor service quality. Also, if you write a comment on our blog and include personally identifying information (like your name or email address), we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to the Internet. This might be obvious to you…but it’s not to everyone!\n\nOther Online Services\n\nWhen you register details to access other PEAK online services (eg. our ResourceSpace portal) we will hold information on your email address, name, company and the country you are in.\n\nSocial Media\n\nWe value our interactions with you on our social media channels. You may wish to use social media to tell us about your experience with PEAK Scientific products, or contact us with a query or problem. We review all publically available social media and online sites to stay aware of what customers are saying about us, and our products, and to help resolve queries wherever possible,\n\nThe information we collect from social media and online sites, including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Linkedin sometimes includes personal information that has been put online and is publically available.\n\nPlease be sure to review relevant privacy policies of respective social media platforms before you use them to make sure that you are happy with how your personal information is being collected and shared.\n\nEmail Communications\n\nAs an existing customer, we may send you communications by e-mail that we believe to be important to you. Provided you are happy for us to do so, we’d also like to keep you up to date on relevant news about PEAK Scientific and our products and services which we think you may find interesting; whether it’s latest product updates or developments, upcoming events or technical advice, we want to make sure you’re happy with the communications you receive from us. You can find out how to update or change your mailing preferences HERE.\n\nWe collect information about how you engage with our e-mails; including whether they are delivered to you, whether you open them, whether you choose to learn more about what's happening at PEAK Scientific (for example, by clicking on a link in our e-mail) and if you ask us not to contact you anymore (by clicking on the unsubscribe option included in all our e-mail correspondence or on our website).\n\nWe use that information by itself and in combination with your customer record (the information you share with us) to make sure that we stop sending you support or marketing communications when you ask us to.\n\nInformation We Collect Automatically\n\nWe also collect some information automatically:\n\n• Log Information: Like most companies with a web presence, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our online support services–for example, when you use our ResourceSpace portal or when you interact with one of our support desks or when you submit a form on our website.\n\n• Usage Information: We collect information about your usage of our website. We use this information get insights on how people use our website, so we can make improvements to make information easier to find.\n\n• Location Information: We will determine the approximate location of the device you are using from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, direct your enquiry to the appropriate geographic PEAK office or representative.

For example, should you purchase a gas generator we may contact you in future about the service contracts available for your generator. Also, if you have given your permission, you will be placed onto our mailing list, as explained above.\n\nTo improve our products and services\n\nWe may also use your information to improve our products and services based on feedback you provide or based on information we collect of PEAK Scientific website usage.

These “OEM” purchase goods and services from us and sell on to their customers\n\nIn some instances, we may share your information with them in instances where you require service on one of their products or if they are providing you a service contract which includes one of our products. Where an OEM has been involved in selling a PEAK Scientific product to you as part of a package/bundle with their product, your personal information may be received by us to help us provide you with service and product maintenance support.\n\nGoogle\n\nWe may share information of existing Google accounts with Google to help us re-engage with customers across the suite of Google platforms including, but not limited to, Gmail, the Shopping Tab, YouTube and Display.\n\nThe customer data files we upload will only be used to match customers to Google accounts and to ensure campaigns comply with Google policies.\n\nGoogle’s system will transform the contact information for Google accounts, like email addresses and phone numbers, into hashed codes using the secure hashing algorithm SHA256, a one-way hashing mechanism that is not unencrypted by Google.\n\nFor more information on this, you can read Google’s privacy policy here.\n\nHow to access or delete your information\n\nUpon request, we will provide you with a copy of the personal information which we hold about you, we will not charge you for this information unless a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, particularly if it is repetitive.
