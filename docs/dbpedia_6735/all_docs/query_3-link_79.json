        "text": "2023-24 Program Requirements\n\nAvailable to students enrolled prior to Fall 2023; for others, see the Sustainable Architecture+Engineering Major\n\nThe Architectural Design major seeks to integrate engineering and architecture in ways that blend innovative architectural design with cutting-edge engineering technologies. Combining hands-on architectural design studios with a wide variety of courses, students can choose from a broad mix of elective courses in energy conservation, sustainability, building systems, structures, as well as design foundation and fine arts courses.\n\nUG Director: Glenn Katz -- 267 Y2E2, glkatz@stanford.edu\n\nStudent Services: Jill Filice -- 316 Y2E2, jill.filice@stanford.edu\n\nThe program’s courses also benefit Civil Engineering majors who want to develop a \"concentration\" in architecture. In addition, for students majoring in related fields such as Urban Studies, Product Design, and Studio Arts, the course offerings in architecture and engineering can be used to fulfill the requirements for a minor in Civil and Environmental Engineering.\n\nAvailable to students enrolled prior to Fall 2023; for others, see the Sustainable Architecture+Engineering Major\n\nMission of the Undergraduate Program in Architectural Design\n\nThe mission of the undergraduate program in Architectural Design is to develop students' ability to integrate engineering and architecture in ways that blend innovative architectural design with cutting-edge engineering technologies. Courses in the program combine hands-on architectural design studios with a wide variety of other courses. Students can choose from a broad mix of elective courses concerning energy conservation, sustainability, building systems, and structures, as well as design foundation and fine arts courses. In addition to preparing students for advanced studies in architecture and construction management, the program's math and science requirements prepare students well for graduate work in other fields such as civil and environmental engineering, law, and business.\n\nCareers and Graduate Study\n\nThe Architectural Design curriculum prepares students for advanced studies in architecture and construction management, and the program's strong math and science requirements prepare students well for graduate work in other fields, such as civil and environmental engineering, law, and business. The major provides a background for individuals wanting to explore a diversity of careers in architecture, engineering, construction, and structures. Completion of the undergraduate program in Architectural Design leads to the conferral of the Bachelor of Science in Engineering. The subplan \"Architectural Design\" appears on the transcript and on the diploma. This major is not an ABET-accredited engineering degree, nor is it designed to lead directly to professional licensure in architecture or engineering. To become a professional architect or engineer, additional graduate training and practical experience may be required.\n\nResearch Experience for Undergraduates\n\nThe department of Civil and Environmental Engineering welcomes student participation in the VPUE Undergraduate Research Programs. Interested students should check the VPUE website and the CEE website for announcements regarding the application procedures. Annual program announcements appear in January with Application due dates in February.\n\nExploring Architectural Design as a Major\n\nAre you wondering whether an Architectural Design major is for you? If so, Here here are some recommended courses accessible early in your undergraduate career that will help you explore your interest in our major. If you end up joining our program, this early start on fulfilling requirements will pay off by giving you more flexibility in class scheduling for your junior and senior years.\n\nFor an introduction to architecture, the following classes are readily accessible to frosh/sophomores, and can count towards the major:\n\nCEE 31Q: Accessing Architecture Through Drawing (A, S)\n\nCEE 120A: Building Modeling for Design & Construction (A, Sum)\n\nCEE 133A: Studio 1 – Architecture - Light, Space, and Movement (A, W, S)\n\nCEE 32 series\n\nCEE 33 series\n\nThe following Science/Math classes are required for almost all majors within the School of Engineering:\n\nMATH 19+20+21 or 10 units AP BC calculus (go to AP page for approval process)\n\nPHYSICS 41.

Note that a course may only be counted towards one elective, option, or core requirement; it may not be double counted.\n\nThe following additional Engineering Fundamental courses may count: ENGR 10, 15, 21, 25E, 40M (or 40A), and 50 (or 50E or 50M).\n\nThe following additional Engineering Elective courses may count:\n\nCEE 31 series\n\nCEE 32 series\n\nCEE 101 series\n\nCEE 120 series\n\nCEE 131 series\n\nCEE 133 series\n\nCEE 134B (though CEE 134B may be repeated for credit, it may only be counted once in the Depth Options portion of the program. If repeated, it can be counted as an elective here).\n\nCEE 139\n\nCEE 180, 182, or 183\n\nENGR 50 or 103\n\nME 100, 110, 115 series, 120, or 203\n\nThe following additional non-engineering Elective courses may count up to 4 units:\n\nArtStudio 140 thru 180 series\n\nFILMPROD 114\n\nURBANST 110, 113, 163, or 171\n\nSINY 122\n\nOther related electives (verify with your program advisor)\n\nStudents may also count up to 4 units of CEE 199/199L in this category, and the following CEE classes: CEE 41Q and CEE 80N.\n\nGrading Requirements\n\nAll courses taken for the major must be taken for a letter grade if that option is offered by the instructor, and a grade of ‘C-‘ or better received.\n\nThe minimum combined GPA for all courses in Engineering Fundamentals and Depth Core + Depth Options + Breadth Options + Electives is 2.0.\n\nSuggested Course Concentrations and Sequences\n\nSubject to the requirements outlined above, students have considerable leeway in choosing their depth electives and other courses to best suit their background and interests. By careful selection of technically-oriented depth electives, students can complement their studio experience with courses in structural analysis, construction, cost estimating, and energy efficiency.\n\nStudents intending to apply to architecture graduate schools are encouraged to take:\n\nstudio art courses as early as possible in their academic career\n\nmore than the minimum number of required studio classes\n\nthe portfolio preparation class (CEE 139)\n\nStudents are also encouraged to take digital modeling courses which will equip them with the skillsets needed to pursue architectural and engineering internships."
