This also applies to the production of cosmetics.\n\nWe continuously produce high-quality products using accumulated expertise that we have accumulated over many years with the latest technologies.\n\nWe also have many engineers trained in traditional techniques to grasp the conditions of weather and raw materials and make optimal arrangements. Carrying on these traditional techniques, the engineers spare no effort to execute the operating processes with accuracy and care in continuing to make products."
