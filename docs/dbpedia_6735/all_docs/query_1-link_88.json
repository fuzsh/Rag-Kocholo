        "text": "Submission Guidelines\n\nStyle and Format\n\nFile format\n\nManuscript files can be in the following formats: DOC, DOCX, or RTF. Microsoft Word documents should not be locked or protected.\n\nLaTeX manuscripts must be submitted as PDFs. Read the LaTeX guidelines.\n\nLength\n\nManuscripts can be any length. There are no restrictions on word count, number of figures, or amount of supporting information.\n\nWe encourage you to present and discuss your findings concisely.\n\nFont\n\nUse a standard font size and any standard font, except for the font named “Symbol”. To add symbols to the manuscript, use the Insert → Symbol function in your word processor or paste in the appropriate Unicode character.\n\nHeadings\n\nLimit manuscript sections and sub-sections to 3 heading levels. Make sure heading levels are clearly indicated in the manuscript text.\n\nLayout and spacing\n\nManuscript text should be double-spaced.\n\nDo not format text in multiple columns.\n\nPage and line numbers\n\nInclude page numbers and line numbers in the manuscript file. Use continuous line numbers (do not restart the numbering on each page).\n\nFootnotes\n\nFootnotes are not permitted. If your manuscript contains footnotes, move the information into the main text or the reference list, depending on the content.\n\nLanguage\n\nManuscripts must be submitted in English.\n\nYou may submit translations of the manuscript or abstract as supporting information. Read the supporting information guidelines.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nDefine abbreviations upon first appearance in the text.\n\nDo not use non-standard abbreviations unless they appear at least three times in the text.\n\nKeep abbreviations to a minimum.\n\nReference style\n\nPLOS uses “Vancouver” style, as outlined in the ICMJE sample references.\n\nSee reference formatting examples and additional instructions below.\n\nEquations\n\nWe recommend using MathType for display and inline equations, as it will provide the most reliable outcome. If this is not possible, Equation Editor or Microsoft's Insert→Equation function is acceptable.\n\nAvoid using MathType, Equation Editor, or the Insert→Equation function to insert single variables (e.g., “a² + b² = c²”), Greek or other symbols (e.g., β, Δ, or ′ [prime]), or mathematical operators (e.g., x, ≥, or ±) in running text. Wherever possible, insert single symbols as normal text with the correct Unicode (hex) values.\n\nDo not use MathType, Equation Editor, or the Insert→Equation function for only a portion of an equation. Rather, ensure that the entire equation is included. Equations should not contain a mix of different equation tools. Avoid “hybrid” inline or display equations, in which part is text and part is MathType, or part is MathType and part is Equation Editor.\n\nNomenclature\n\nUse correct and established nomenclature wherever possible.\n\nUnits of measurement Use SI units. If you do not use these exclusively, provide the SI value in parentheses after each value. Read more about SI units. Drugs Provide the Recommended International Non-Proprietary Name (rINN). Species names Write in italics (e.g., Homo sapiens). Write out in full the genus and species, both in the title of the manuscript and at the first mention of an organism in a paper. After first mention, the first letter of the genus name followed by the full species name may be used (e.g., H. sapiens). Genes, mutations, genotypes, and alleles Write in italics. Use the recommended name by consulting the appropriate genetic nomenclature database (e.g., HGNC for human genes; we strongly recommend using this tool to check against previously approved names). It is sometimes advisable to indicate the synonyms for the gene the first time it appears in the text. Gene prefixes such as those used for oncogenes or cellular localization should be shown in roman typeface (e.g., v-fes, c-MYC). Allergens\n\nThe systematic allergen nomenclature of the World Health Organization/International Union of Immunological Societies (WHO/IUIS) Allergen Nomenclature Sub-committee should be used for manuscripts that include the description or use of allergenic proteins. For manuscripts describing new allergens, the systematic name of the allergen should be approved by the WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Sub-Committee prior to manuscript publication. Examples of the systematic allergen nomenclature can be found at the WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature site.\n\nCopyediting manuscripts\n\nPrior to submission, authors who believe their manuscripts would benefit from professional editing are encouraged to use language-editing and copyediting services. Obtaining this service is the responsibility of the author, and should be done before initial submission. These services can be found on the web using search terms like “scientific editing service” or “manuscript editing service.”\n\nSubmissions are not copyedited before publication.\n\nSubmissions that do not meet the PLOS ONE publication criterion for language standards may be rejected.\n\nManuscript Organization\n\nManuscripts should be organized as follows. Instructions for each element appear below the list.\n\nBeginning section\n\nThe following elements are required, in order:\n\nTitle page: List title, authors, and affiliations as first page of the manuscript\n\nAbstract\n\nIntroduction\n\nMiddle section\n\nThe following elements can be renamed as needed and presented in any order:\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nResults\n\nDiscussion\n\nConclusions (optional)\n\nEnding section\n\nThe following elements are required, in order:\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nReferences\n\nSupporting information captions (if applicable)\n\nOther elements\n\nFigure captions are inserted immediately after the first paragraph in which the figure is cited. Figure files are uploaded separately.\n\nTables are inserted immediately after the first paragraph in which they are cited.\n\nSupporting information files are uploaded separately.\n\nRefer to our downloadable sample files to ensure that your submission meets our formatting requirements:\n\nDownload sample title, author list, and affiliations page (PDF)\n\nDownload sample manuscript body (PDF)\n\nViewing Figures and Supporting Information in the compiled submission PDF\n\nThe compiled submission PDF includes low-resolution preview images of the figures after the reference list. The function of these previews is to allow you to download the entire submission as quickly as possible. Click the link at the top of each preview page to download a high-resolution version of each figure. Links to download Supporting Information files are also available after the reference list.\n\nParts of a Submission\n\nTitle\n\nInclude a full title and a short title for the manuscript.\n\nTitle Length Guidelines Examples Full title 250 characters Specific, descriptive, concise, and comprehensible to readers outside the field\n\nImpact of cigarette smoke exposure on innate immunity: A Caenorhabditis elegans model\n\nSolar drinking water disinfection (SODIS) to reduce childhood diarrhoea in rural Bolivia: A cluster-randomized, controlled trial\n\nShort title 100 characters State the topic of the study\n\nCigarette smoke exposure and innate immunity\n\nSODIS and childhood diarrhoea\n\nTitles should be written in sentence case (only the first word of the text, proper nouns, and genus names are capitalized). Avoid specialist abbreviations if possible. For clinical trials, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses, the subtitle should include the study design.\n\nAuthor list\n\nAuthorship requirements\n\nAll authors must meet the criteria for authorship as outlined in the authorship policy. Those who contributed to the work but do not meet the criteria for authorship can be mentioned in the Acknowledgments. Read more about Acknowledgments.\n\nThe corresponding author must provide an ORCID iD at the time of submission by entering it in the user profile in the submission system. Read more about ORCID.\n\nAuthor names and affiliations\n\nEnter author names on the title page of the manuscript and in the online submission system.\n\nOn the title page, write author names in the following order:\n\nFirst name (or initials, if used)\n\nMiddle name (or initials, if used)\n\nLast name (surname, family name)\n\nEach author on the list must have an affiliation. The affiliation includes department, university, or organizational affiliation and its location, including city, state/province (if applicable), and country. Authors have the option to include a current address in addition to the address of their affiliation at the time of the study. The current address should be listed in the byline and clearly labeled “current address.” At a minimum, the address must include the author’s current institution, city, and country.\n\nIf an author has multiple affiliations, enter all affiliations on the title page only. In the submission system, enter only the preferred or primary affiliation. Author affiliations will be listed in the typeset PDF article in the same order that authors are listed in the submission.\n\nAuthor names will be published exactly as they appear in the manuscript file. Please double-check the information carefully to make sure it is correct.\n\nCorresponding author\n\nThe submitting author is automatically designated as the corresponding author in the submission system. The corresponding author is the primary contact for the journal office and the only author able to view or change the manuscript while it is under editorial consideration.\n\nThe corresponding author role may be transferred to another coauthor. However, note that transferring the corresponding author role also transfers access to the manuscript. (To designate a new corresponding author while the manuscript is still under consideration, watch the video tutorial below.)\n\nOnly one corresponding author can be designated in the submission system, but this does not restrict the number of corresponding authors that may be listed on the article in the event of publication. Whoever is designated as a corresponding author on the title page of the manuscript file will be listed as such upon publication. Include an email address for each corresponding author listed on the title page of the manuscript.\n\nConsortia and group authorship\n\nIf a manuscript is submitted on behalf of a consortium or group, include its name in the manuscript byline. Do not add it to the author list in the submission system. You may include the full list of members in the Acknowledgments or in a supporting information file.\n\nPubMed only indexes individual consortium or group author members listed in the article byline. If included, these individuals must qualify for authorship according to our criteria.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nProvide at minimum one contribution for each author in the submission system. Use the CRediT taxonomy to describe each contribution. Read the policy and the full list of roles.\n\nContributions will be published with the final article, and they should accurately reflect contributions to the work. The submitting author is responsible for completing this information at submission, and we expect that all authors will have reviewed, discussed, and agreed to their individual contributions ahead of this time.\n\nPLOS ONE will contact all authors by email at submission to ensure that they are aware of the submission.\n\nCover letter\n\nUpload a cover letter as a separate file in the online system. The length limit is 1 page.\n\nThe cover letter should include the following information:\n\nSummarize the study’s contribution to the scientific literature\n\nRelate the study to previously published work\n\nSpecify the type of article (for example, research article, systematic review, meta-analysis, clinical trial)\n\nDescribe any prior interactions with PLOS regarding the submitted manuscript\n\nSuggest appropriate Academic Editors to handle your manuscript (see the full list of Academic Editors)\n\nList any opposed reviewers\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not include requests to reduce or waive publication fees in the cover letter. This information will be entered separately in the online submission system.\n\nRead about publication fee assistance.\n\nTitle page\n\nThe title, authors, and affiliations should all be included on a title page as the first page of the manuscript file.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Abstract comes after the title page in the manuscript file. The abstract text is also entered in a separate field in the submission system.\n\nThe Abstract should:\n\nDescribe the main objective(s) of the study\n\nExplain how the study was done, including any model organisms used, without methodological detail\n\nSummarize the most important results and their significance\n\nNot exceed 300 words\n\nAbstracts should not include:\n\nCitations\n\nAbbreviations, if possible\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe introduction should:\n\nProvide background that puts the manuscript into context and allows readers outside the field to understand the purpose and significance of the study\n\nDefine the problem addressed and why it is important\n\nInclude a brief review of the key literature\n\nNote any relevant controversies or disagreements in the field\n\nConclude with a brief statement of the overall aim of the work and a comment about whether that aim was achieved\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nThe Materials and Methods section should provide enough detail to allow suitably skilled investigators to fully replicate your study. Specific information and/or protocols for new methods should be included in detail. If materials, methods, and protocols are well established, authors may cite articles where those protocols are described in detail, but the submission should include sufficient information to be understood independent of these references.\n\nSupporting reproducibility with protocols\n\nTo enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend and encourage you to make your protocols public. There are several options:\n\nProtocols associated with Research Articles\n\nProtocol documents may be uploaded as Supporting Information or linked from the Methods section of the article. For laboratory protocols, we recommend protocols.io. Include the DOI link in the Methods section of your manuscript using the following format: http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.[PROTOCOL DOI]. This allows editors and reviewers to consult the detailed step-by-step protocol when evaluating your manuscript. You can choose to keep the protocol private on the protocols.io platform until your article is published—at which time it will be published automatically.\n\nProtocols published in their own right\n\nPLOS ONE offers two options for publishing stand-alone protocol articles: Lab Protocols that describe reusable methodologies and Study Protocols that describe detailed plans and proposals for research projects. Specific guidelines apply to the submission of Lab Protocol and Study Protocol manuscripts. Read the detailed instructions for submitting Lab Protocols and Study Protocols.\n\nResults, Discussion, Conclusions\n\nThese sections may all be separate, or may be combined to create a mixed Results/Discussion section (commonly labeled “Results and Discussion”) or a mixed Discussion/Conclusions section (commonly labeled “Discussion”). These sections may be further divided into subsections, each with a concise subheading, as appropriate. These sections have no word limit, but the language should be clear and concise.\n\nTogether, these sections should describe the results of the experiments, the interpretation of these results, and the conclusions that can be drawn.\n\nAuthors should explain how the results relate to the hypothesis presented as the basis of the study and provide a succinct explanation of the implications of the findings, particularly in relation to previous related studies and potential future directions for research.\n\nPLOS ONE editorial decisions do not rely on perceived significance or impact, so authors should avoid overstating their conclusions. See the PLOS ONE Criteria for Publication for more information.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThose who contributed to the work but do not meet our authorship criteria should be listed in the Acknowledgments with a description of the contribution.\n\nAuthors are responsible for ensuring that anyone named in the Acknowledgments agrees to be named.\n\nPLOS journals publicly acknowledge the indispensable efforts of our editors and reviewers on an annual basis. To ensure equitable recognition and avoid any appearance of partiality, do not include editors or peer reviewers—named or unnamed—in the Acknowledgments.\n\nDo not include funding sources in the Acknowledgments or anywhere else in the manuscript file. Funding information should only be entered in the financial disclosure section of the submission system.\n\nReferences\n\nAny and all available works can be cited in the reference list. Acceptable sources include:\n\nPublished or accepted manuscripts\n\nManuscripts on preprint servers, providing the manuscript has a citable DOI or arXiv URL.\n\nDo not cite the following sources in the reference list:\n\nUnavailable and unpublished work, including manuscripts that have been submitted but not yet accepted (e.g., “unpublished work,” “data not shown”). Instead, include those data as supplementary material or deposit the data in a publicly available database.\n\nPersonal communications (these should be supported by a letter from the relevant authors but not included in the reference list)\n\nSubmitted research should not rely upon retracted research. You should avoid citing retracted articles unless you need to discuss retracted work to provide historical context for your submitted research. If it is necessary to discuss retracted work, state the article’s retracted status in your article’s text and reference list.\n\nEnsure that your reference list includes full and current bibliography details for every cited work at the time of your article’s submission (and publication, if accepted). If cited work is corrected, retracted, or marked with an expression of concern before your article is published, and if you feel it is appropriate to cite the work even in light of the post-publication notice, include in your manuscript citations and full references for both the affected article and the post-publication notice. Email the journal office if you have questions.\n\nReferences are listed at the end of the manuscript and numbered in the order that they appear in the text. In the text, cite the reference number in square brackets (e.g., “We used the techniques developed by our colleagues [19] to analyze the data”). PLOS uses the numbered citation (citation-sequence) method and first six authors, et al.\n\nDo not include citations in abstracts.\n\nMake sure the parts of the manuscript are in the correct order before ordering the citations.\n\n​Formatting references\n\nBecause all references will be linked electronically as much as possible to the papers they cite, proper formatting of references is crucial.\n\nPLOS uses the reference style outlined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), also referred to as the “Vancouver” style. Example formats are listed below. Additional examples are in the ICMJE sample references.\n\nA reference management tool, EndNote, offers a current style file that can assist you with the formatting of your references. If you have problems with any reference management program, please contact the source company's technical support.\n\nJournal name abbreviations should be those found in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases.\n\nSource Format Published articles\n\nHou WR, Hou YL, Wu GF, Song Y, Su XL, Sun B, et al. cDNA, genomic sequence cloning and overexpression of ribosomal protein gene L9 (rpL9) of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca).

All supporting information will be subject to peer review. All file types can be submitted, but files must be smaller than 20 MB in size.\n\nAuthors may use almost any description as the item name for a supporting information file as long as it contains an “S” and number. For example, “S1 Appendix” and “S2 Appendix,” “S1 Table” and “S2 Table,” and so forth.\n\nSupporting information files are published exactly as provided, and are not copyedited.\n\nSupporting information captions\n\nList supporting information captions at the end of the manuscript file. Do not submit captions in a separate file.\n\nThe file number and name are required in a caption, and we highly recommend including a one-line title as well. You may also include a legend in your caption, but it is not required.\n\nExample caption\n\nS1 Text. Title is strongly recommended. Legend is optional.\n\nIn-text citations\n\nWe recommend that you cite supporting information in the manuscript text, but this is not a requirement. If you cite supporting information in the text, citations do not need to be in numerical order.\n\nRead the supporting information guidelines for more details about submitting supporting information and multimedia files.\n\nFigures and tables\n\nFigures\n\nDo not include figures in the main manuscript file. Each figure must be prepared and submitted as an individual file.\n\nCite figures in ascending numeric order at first appearance in the manuscript file.\n\nFigure captions\n\nFigure captions must be inserted in the text of the manuscript, immediately following the paragraph in which the figure is first cited (read order). Do not include captions as part of the figure files themselves or submit them in a separate document.\n\nAt a minimum, include the following in your figure captions:\n\nA figure label with Arabic numerals, and “Figure” abbreviated to “Fig” (e.g. Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3, etc). Match the label of your figure with the name of the file uploaded at submission (e.g. a figure citation of “Fig 1” must refer to a figure file named “Fig1.tif”).\n\nA concise, descriptive title\n\nThe caption may also include a legend as needed.\n\nTables\n\nCite tables in ascending numeric order upon first appearance in the manuscript file.\n\nPlace each table in your manuscript file directly after the paragraph in which it is first cited (read order). Do not submit your tables in separate files.\n\nTables require a label (e.g., “Table 1”) and brief descriptive title to be placed above the table. Place legends, footnotes, and other text below the table.\n\nStatistical reporting\n\nManuscripts submitted to PLOS ONE are expected to report statistical methods in sufficient detail for others to replicate the analysis performed. Ensure that results are rigorously reported in accordance with community standards and that statistical methods employed are appropriate for the study design.\n\nConsult the following resources for additional guidance:\n\nSAMPL guidelines, for general guidance on statistical reporting\n\nPLOS ONE guidelines, for clinical trials requirements\n\nPLOS ONE guidelines, for systematic review and meta-analysis requirements\n\nEQUATOR, for specific reporting guidelines for a range of other study types\n\nReporting of statistical methods\n\nIn the methods, include a section on statistical analysis that reports a detailed description of the statistical methods. In this section:\n\nList the name and version of any software package used, alongside any relevant references\n\nDescribe technical details or procedures required to reproduce the analysis\n\nProvide the repository identifier for any code used in the analysis (See our code-sharing policy.)\n\nStatistical reporting guidelines:\n\nIdentify research design and independent variables as being between- or within-subjects\n\nFor pre-processed data:\n\nDescribe any analysis carried out to confirm the data meets the assumptions of the analysis performed (e.g. linearity, co-linearity, normality of the distribution).\n\nIf data were transformed include this information, with a reason for doing so and a description of the transformation performed\n\nProvide details of how outliers were treated and your analysis, both with the full dataset and with the outliers removed\n\nIf relevant, describe how missing/excluded data were handled\n\nDefine the threshold for significance (alpha)\n\nIf appropriate, provide sample sizes, along with a description of how they were determined. If a sample size calculation was performed, specify the inputs for power, effect size and alpha. Where relevant, report the number of independent replications for each experiment.\n\nFor analyses of variance (ANOVAs), detail any post hoc tests that were performed\n\nInclude details of any corrections applied to account for multiple comparisons. If corrections were not applied, include a justification for not doing so\n\nDescribe all options for statistical procedures. For example, if t-tests were performed, state whether these were one- or two-tailed. Include details of the type of t-test conducted (e.g. one sample, within-/between-subjects).\n\nFor step-wise multiple regression analyses:\n\nReport the alpha level used\n\nDiscuss whether the variables were assessed for collinearity and interaction\n\nDescribe the variable selection process by which the final model was developed (e.g., forward-stepwise; best subset). See SAMPL guidelines.\n\nFor Bayesian analysis explain the choice of prior trial probabilities and how they were selected. Markov chain Monte Carlo settings should be reported.\n\nReporting of statistical results\n\nResults must be rigorously and appropriately reported, in keeping with community standards.\n\nUnits of measurement. Clearly define measurement units in all tables and figures.\n\nProperties of distribution. It should be clear from the text which measures of variance (standard deviation, standard error of the mean, confidence intervals) and central tendency (mean, median) are being presented.\n\nRegression analyses. Include the full results of any regression analysis performed as a supplementary file. Include all estimated regression coefficients, their standard error, p-values, and confidence intervals, as well as the measures of goodness of fit.\n\nReporting parameters. Test statistics (F/t/r) and associated degrees of freedom should be provided. Effect sizes and confidence intervals should be reported where appropriate. If percentages are provided, the numerator and denominator should also be given.\n\nP-values. Report exact p-values for all values greater than or equal to 0.001. P-values less than 0.001 may be expressed as p < 0.001, or as exponentials in studies of genetic associations.\n\nDisplaying data in plots. Format plots so that they accurately depict the sample distribution. 3D effects in plots can bias and hinder interpretation of values, so avoid them in cases where regular plots are sufficient to display the data.\n\nOpen data. As explained in PLOS’s Data Policy, be sure to make individual data points, underlying graphs and summary statistics available at the time of publication. Data can be deposited in a repository or included within the Supporting Information files.\n\nData reporting\n\nAll data and related metadata underlying the findings reported in a submitted manuscript should be deposited in an appropriate public repository, unless already provided as part of the submitted article.\n\nSee instructions on providing underlying data to support blot and gel results.\n\nRepositories may be either subject-specific (where these exist) and accept specific types of structured data, or generalist repositories that accept multiple data types. We recommend that authors select repositories appropriate to their field. Repositories may be subject-specific (e.g., GenBank for sequences and PDB for structures), general, or institutional, as long as DOIs or accession numbers are provided and the data are at least as open as CC BY. Authors are encouraged to select repositories that meet accepted criteria as trustworthy digital repositories, such as criteria of the Centre for Research Libraries or Data Seal of Approval. Large, international databases are more likely to persist than small, local ones.\n\nTo support data sharing and author compliance of the PLOS data policy, we have integrated our submission process with a select set of data repositories. The list is neither representative nor exhaustive of the suitable repositories available to authors. Current repository integration partners include Dryad and FlowRepository. Please contact data@plos.org to make recommendations for further partnerships.\n\nInstructions for PLOS submissions with data deposited in an integration partner repository:\n\nDeposit data in the integrated repository of choice.\n\nOnce deposition is final and complete, the repository will provide you with a dataset DOI (provisional) and private URL for reviewers to gain access to the data.\n\nEnter the given data DOI into the full Data Availability Statement, which is requested in the Additional Information section of the PLOS submission form. Then provide the URL passcode in the Attach Files section.\n\nIf you have any questions, please email us.\n\nAccession numbers\n\nAll appropriate data sets, images, and information should be deposited in an appropriate public repository. See our list of recommended repositories.\n\nAccession numbers (and version numbers, if appropriate) should be provided in the Data Availability Statement. Accession numbers or a citation to the DOI should also be provided when the data set is mentioned within the manuscript.\n\nIn some cases authors may not be able to obtain accession numbers of DOIs until the manuscript is accepted; in these cases, the authors must provide these numbers at acceptance. In all other cases, these numbers must be provided at full submission.\n\nIdentifiers\n\nAs much as possible, please provide accession numbers or identifiers for all entities such as genes, proteins, mutants, diseases, etc., for which there is an entry in a public database, for example:\n\nEnsembl\n\nEntrez Gene\n\nFlyBase\n\nInterPro\n\nMouse Genome Database (MGD)\n\nOnline Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)\n\nPubChem\n\nIdentifiers should be provided in parentheses after the entity on first use.\n\nStriking image\n\nYou can choose to upload a “Striking Image” that we may use to represent your article online in places like the journal homepage or in search results.\n\nThe striking image must be derived from a figure or supporting information file from the submission, i.e., a cropped portion of an image or the entire image. Striking images should ideally be high resolution, eye-catching, single panel images, and should ideally avoid containing added details such as text, scale bars, and arrows.\n\nIf no striking image is uploaded, we will designate a figure from the submission as the striking image.\n\nStriking images should not contain potentially identifying images of people. Read our policy on identifying information.\n\nThe PLOS licenses and copyright policy also applies to striking images.\n\nAdditional Information Requested at Submission\n\nFinancial Disclosure Statement\n\nThis information should describe sources of funding that have supported the work. It is important to gather these details prior to submission because your financial disclosure statement cannot be changed after initial submission without journal approval. If your manuscript is published, your statement will appear in the Funding section of the article.\n\nEnter this statement in the Financial Disclosure section of the submission form. Do not include it in your manuscript file.\n\nThe statement should include:\n\nSpecific grant numbers\n\nInitials of authors who received each award\n\nFull names of commercial companies that funded the study or authors\n\nInitials of authors who received salary or other funding from commercial companies\n\nURLs to sponsors’ websites\n\nAlso state whether any sponsors or funders (other than the named authors) played any role in:\n\nStudy design\n\nData collection and analysis\n\nDecision to publish\n\nPreparation of the manuscript\n\nIf they had no role in the research, include this sentence: “The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.”\n\nIf the study was unfunded, include this sentence as the Financial Disclosure statement: “The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.\"\n\nCompeting interests\n\nThis information should not be in your manuscript file; you will provide it via our submission system.\n\nAll potential competing interests must be declared in full. If the submission is related to any patents, patent applications, or products in development or for market, these details, including patent numbers and titles, must be disclosed in full.\n\nManuscripts disputing published work\n\nFor manuscripts disputing previously published work, it is PLOS ONE policy to invite a signed review by the disputed author during the peer review process. This procedure is aimed at ensuring a thorough, transparent, and productive review process.\n\nIf the disputed author chooses to submit a review, it must be returned in a timely fashion and contain a full declaration of all competing interests. The Academic Editor will consider any such reviews in light of the competing interest.\n\nAuthors submitting manuscripts disputing previous work should explain the relationship between the manuscripts in their cover letter, and will be required to confirm that they accept the conditions of this review policy before the manuscript is considered further.\n\nRelated manuscripts\n\nUpon submission, authors must confirm that the manuscript, or any related manuscript, is not currently under consideration or accepted elsewhere. If related work has been submitted to PLOS ONE or elsewhere, authors must include a copy with the submitted article. Reviewers will be asked to comment on the overlap between related submissions.\n\nWe strongly discourage the unnecessary division of related work into separate manuscripts, and we will not consider manuscripts that are divided into “parts.” Each submission to PLOS ONE must be written as an independent unit and should not rely on any work that has not already been accepted for publication. If related manuscripts are submitted to PLOS ONE, the authors may be advised to combine them into a single manuscript at the editor's discretion.\n\nRead our policies on related manuscripts.\n\nPreprints\n\nPLOS encourages authors to post preprints to accelerate the dissemination of research. Posting a manuscript on a preprint server does not impact consideration of the manuscript at any PLOS journal.\n\nAuthors posting preprints on bioRxiv or medRxiv can choose to concurrently submit their manuscripts to relevant PLOS journals through the direct transfer service.\n\nAuthors submitting manuscripts in the life and health sciences to PLOS ONE may choose to have PLOS forward their submission to bioRxiv or medRxiv, depending on the scope of the paper, for consideration for posting as a preprint.\n\nGuidelines for Specific Study Types\n\nStudy design, reporting, and analyses are assessed against all relevant research and methodological technique standards held by the community. Guidelines for specific study types are outlined below.\n\nRegistered Reports\n\nSubmission and format requirements for Registered Report Protocols and Registered Reports are similar to those for a regular submission and may be specific to your study type. For instance, if your Registered Report Protocol submission is about a Clinical Trial or a Systematic Review, follow the appropriate guidelines.\n\nFor Registered Report Protocols:\n\nProvide enough methodological detail to make the study reproducible and replicable\n\nConfirm that data will be made available upon study completion in keeping with the PLOS Data policy​\n\nInclude ethical approval or waivers, if applicable\n\nPreliminary or pilot data may be included, but only if necessary to support the feasibility of the study or as a proof of principle\n\nFor meta-analyses or Clinical Trials, use the protocol-specific reporting guidelines PRISMA-P or SPIRIT respectively\n\nFor more guidance on format and presentation of a protocol, consult the sample template hosted by the Open Science Framework. Discipline-specific and study-specific templates are also available.\n\nIf data need to be collected, modified or processed specifically for your study, or if participants need to be recruited specifically for your study, then it should occur only after your Registered Report Protocol is accepted for publication.\n\nFor Registered Report Research Articles:\n\nReport the results of all planned analyses and, if relevant, detail and justify all deviations from the protocol.\n\nThe manuscript may also contain exploratory, unplanned analyses.\n\nRead more about Registered Report framework.\n\nHuman subjects research\n\nAll research involving human participants must have been approved by the authors’ Institutional Review Board (IRB) or by equivalent ethics committee(s), and must have been conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Authors should be able to submit, upon request, a statement from the IRB or ethics committee indicating approval of the research. We reserve the right to reject work that we believe has not been conducted to a high ethical standard, even when formal approval has been obtained.\n\nSubjects must have been properly instructed and have indicated that they consent to participate by signing the appropriate informed consent paperwork. Authors may be asked to submit a blank, sample copy of a subject consent form. If consent was verbal instead of written, or if consent could not be obtained, the authors must explain the reason in the manuscript, and the use of verbal consent or the lack of consent must have been approved by the IRB or ethics committee.\n\nAll efforts should be made to protect patient privacy and anonymity. Identifying information, including photos, should not be included in the manuscript unless the information is crucial and the individual has provided written consent by completing the Consent Form for Publication in a PLOS Journal (PDF). Download additional translations of the form here. More information about patient privacy, anonymity, and informed consent can be found in the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) Privacy and Confidentiality guidelines.\n\nManuscripts should conform to the following reporting guidelines:\n\nStudies of diagnostic accuracy: STARD\n\nObservational studies: STROBE\n\nMicroarray experiments: MIAME\n\nOther types of health-related research: Consult the EQUATOR web site for appropriate reporting guidelines\n\nMethods sections of papers on research using human subjects or samples must include ethics statements that specify:\n\nThe name of the approving institutional review board or equivalent committee(s). If approval was not obtained, the authors must provide a detailed statement explaining why it was not needed\n\nWhether informed consent was written or oral. If informed consent was oral, it must be stated in the manuscript:\n\nWhy written consent could not be obtained\n\nThat the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved use of oral consent\n\nHow oral consent was documented\n\nFor studies involving humans categorized by race/ethnicity, age, disease/disabilities, religion, sex/gender, sexual orientation, or other socially constructed groupings, authors should:\n\nExplicitly describe their methods of categorizing human populations\n\nDefine categories in as much detail as the study protocol allows\n\nJustify their choices of definitions and categories, including for example whether any rules of human categorization were required by their funding agency\n\nExplain whether (and if so, how) they controlled for confounding variables such as socioeconomic status, nutrition, environmental exposures, or similar factors in their analysis\n\nIn addition, outmoded terms and potentially stigmatizing labels should be changed to more current, acceptable terminology. Examples: “Caucasian” should be changed to “white” or “of [Western] European descent” (as appropriate); “cancer victims” should be changed to “patients with cancer.”\n\nFor papers that include identifying, or potentially identifying, information, authors must download the Consent Form for Publication in a PLOS Journal, which the individual, parent, or guardian must sign once they have read the paper and been informed about the terms of PLOS open-access license. The signed consent form should not be submitted with the manuscript, but authors should securely file it in the individual's case notes and the methods section of the manuscript should explicitly state that consent authorization for publication is on file, using wording like:\n\nThe individual in this manuscript has given written informed consent (as outlined in PLOS consent form) to publish these case details.\n\nFor more information about PLOS ONE policies regarding human subjects research, see the Publication Criteria and Editorial Policies.\n\nManuscripts describing observational clinical studies are subject to all policies regarding human research and community standards for reporting observational research as outlined by the STROBE statement. Furthermore, authors submitting work of this nature should pay special attention to the following requirements:\n\nIf the submitted manuscript is very similar to previous work, authors must provide a sound scientific rationale for the submitted work and clearly reference and discuss the existing literature.\n\nThe sampling strategy and eligibility criteria of enrolled subjects should be described in sufficient detail.\n\nSample size calculations should be justified with relevant inputs defined.\n\nIndependent and dependent variables considered for statistical analysis should be clearly defined and justified.\n\nThe validity and reliability testing of self-developed data collection tools should be reported.\n\nConclusions should be appropriate for the study design, with indications on how the study results will contribute to the base of academic knowledge.\n\nClinical trials\n\nClinical trials are subject to all policies regarding human research. PLOS ONE follows the World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of a clinical trial:\n\nA clinical trial is any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes [...] Interventions include but are not restricted to drugs, cells and other biological products, surgical procedures, radiologic procedures, devices, behavioural treatments, process-of-care changes, preventive care, etc.\n\nAll clinical trials must be registered in one of the publicly-accessible registries approved by the WHO or ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors). Authors must provide the trial registration number. Prior disclosure of results on a clinical trial registry site will not affect consideration for publication. We reserve the right to inform authors' institutions or ethics committees, and to reject the manuscript, if we become aware of unregistered trials.\n\nPLOS ONE supports prospective trial registration (i.e. before participant recruitment has begun) as recommended by the ICMJE's clinical trial registration policy. Where trials were not publicly registered before participant recruitment began, authors must:\n\nRegister all related clinical trials and confirm they have done so in the Methods section\n\nExplain in the Methods the reason for failing to register before participant recruitment\n\nClinical trials must be reported according to the relevant reporting guidelines, i.e. CONSORT for randomized controlled trials, TREND for non-randomized trials, and other specialized guidelines as appropriate. The intervention should be described according to the requirements of the TIDieR checklist and guide. Submissions must also include the study protocol as supporting information, which will be published with the manuscript if accepted.\n\nAuthors of manuscripts describing the results of clinical trials must adhere to the CONSORT reporting guidelines appropriate to their trial design, available on the CONSORT Statement web site. Before the paper can enter peer review, authors must:\n\nThe name of the registry and the registration number must be included in the Abstract.\n\nProvide a copy of the trial protocol as approved by the ethics committee and a completed CONSORT checklist as supporting information (which will be published alongside the paper, if accepted). This should be named S1 CONSORT Checklist.\n\nInclude the CONSORT flow diagram as the manuscript's “Fig 1”\n\nAny deviation from the trial protocol must be explained in the paper. Authors must explicitly discuss informed consent in their paper, and we reserve the right to ask for a copy of the patient consent form.\n\nThe name of the registry and the registry number must be provided in the Abstract. If the trial is registered in more than one location, please provide all relevant registry names and numbers.\n\nLab Protocols\n\nLab Protocols consist of two interlinked components: a step-by-step protocol hosted on protocols.io, and a peer-reviewed article in PLOS ONE that contextualises the protocol.\n\nprotocols.io is a secure platform for developing and sharing reproducible methods. It enables scientists to make, exchange, improve, and discuss protocols for specific experimental procedures. The platform provides specialized tools for communicating technical details, including reagents, measurements, and formulae.\n\nThe PLOS ONE article component must comply with the general PLOS ONE submission guidelines (detailed above) and criteria for publication. In addition, the PLOS ONE article component should:\n\nDescribe the value that the protocol adds to the published literature. Lab Protocols describing routine methods or extensions and modifications of routine methods that add little value to the published literature will not be considered for publication.\n\nProvide evidence that the protocol works, by either:\n\nLinking, in the Introduction section, to at least one supporting peer-reviewed publication in which the protocol was applied to generate data.\n\nor\n\nProviding validation or benchmarking data, which demonstrates that the underlying method achieves its intended purpose.\n\nProvide the step-by-step protocol as a supporting information (S1) file.\n\nWe encourage you to post your protocol to the protocols.io platform before submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. Posting your protocol prior to submission is not considered prior publication by PLOS ONE and will not affect your eligibility to publish a Lab Protocol.\n\nAuthors submitting a Lab Protocol can also use protocols.io’s protocol entry service at no cost: the team at protocols.io will enter your protocol for you and format it in a way that takes advantage of the platform’s features. You will have an opportunity to review and make further changes before your protocol is shared with anyone else.\n\nIf you would like to use protocols.io's protocol entry service in connection with a Lab Protocol submission, please contact plosone@plos.org to request the customer code.\n\nIf you prefer to submit your manuscript to PLOS ONE before posting your protocol to protocols.io, then you must still provide your step-by-step protocol as a supporting information (S1) file in a format of your choosing. You will be expected to replace this file with a protocols.io PDF later in the editorial process.\n\nStudy Protocols\n\nStudy Protocols describe plans for conducting research projects and consist of a single article on PLOS ONE.\n\nStudy Protocols must comply with the PLOS ONE general submission guidelines (detailed above in this article) and any guidelines specific to the related research study type. In addition, the protocol must:\n\nRelate to a research study that has not yet generated results.\n\nBe submitted before recruitment of participants or collection of data for the study is complete.\n\nMeet the same standards for ethics of experimentation and research integrity as the research study. If it involves human or animal subjects, cell lines or field sampling, or has potential biosafety implications, prior approval from the relevant ethics body must be obtained prior to submission. Please contact us if you have a valid reason for not obtaining approval.\n\nAdditional prerequisites apply for these study types:\n\nClinical trials:\n\nThe trial must be registered prior to submission of your protocol in one of the publicly accessible registries approved by the WHO or ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors).\n\nThe name of the registry and the trial or study registration number must be included in the Abstract.\n\nA copy of the protocol that was approved by the ethics committee must be submitted as a supplementary information file. Please provide an additional English translation if the original document is not in English. Please note that the protocol will be published with the manuscript if accepted.\n\nA SPIRIT schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments must be included as the manuscript’s Figure 1, and a completed SPIRIT checklist must be uploaded as Supporting Information file S1.\n\nSystematic reviews and meta-analyses:\n\nA completed PRISMA-P checklist must be provided as a supporting information (SI) file. See PRISMA-P Explanation and Elaboration for more information on completing your checklist.\n\nStudy Protocols must also comply with general PLOS ONE criteria for publication and in addition you should:\n\ninclude the word “Protocol” in your Title.\n\ninclude a detailed description of the planned study in the Materials and Methods section.This should provide sufficient methodological detail for the protocol to be reproducible and replicable. Your description should cover all relevant and applicable facts and hypothesis, including:\n\nthe aim, design, and settling\n\nthe sample size calculation\n\nhow data saturation will be determined (for qualitative studies)\n\nthe characteristics of participants e.g., inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample selection criteria, variables to be measured, randomization and blinding criteria (where applicable), and how informed consent will be obtained\n\nhow materials will be selected and used e.g., where and how they will be sourced, the processes, interventions, or comparisons to be used, the outcomes to be measured, and when and how they will be measured\n\nthe data management plan\n\nsafety considerations\n\nthe type of data and statistical analyses to be used\n\nthe status and timeline of the study, including whether participant recruitment or data collection has begun\n\nwhere and when the data will be made available. See our Data Availability policy for more.\n\ninclude an analysis of preliminary or pilot data, only if it is necessary to support the feasibility of the study or as a proof of principle. This is optional.\n\nwe encourage authors you to register with OSF and provide the your registration number in the Materials and Methods section. This is optional.\n\noptionally add any other SI files, figures or tables that elaborate or authenticate the protocol: e.g., any reporting checklists applicable to your study type.\n\nRead the supporting information guidelines for more details about adding SI files.\n\nStudy Protocols are subject to the same editorial and peer review process as all other articles, and are eligible for both signed and published peer review.\n\nYou can expedite the review process by providing:\n\nproof of external funding. This is typically your funding approval letter and a list of the names and credentials of the funders who conducted the external peer review of the protocol. Include an English translation if needed.\n\nproof of ethics approval (if required). This is typically the approval or waiver letter from the relevant ethics body and a copy of the protocol approved by this body.\n\nThe proof of external funding and approval or waiver letter are used for internal purposes and do not form part of the published Study Protocol.\n\nExpedited review is conducted by an internal Staff Editor only and bypasses the external review process.\n\nIf the Study Protocol describes a replication study or involves re-analysis of published work, we will invite the author of the initial or replicated study to provide a signed review.\n\nWe encourage you to share your Study Protocol with other researchers, either before or after submission. You can publish it on your website or protocols.io, or submit it for posting on medRxiv or another preprint server.\n\nAnimal research\n\nAll research involving vertebrates or cephalopods must have approval from the authors' Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) or equivalent ethics committee(s), and must have been conducted according to applicable national and international guidelines. Approval must be received prior to beginning research.\n\nManuscripts reporting animal research must state in the Methods section:\n\nThe full name of the relevant ethics committee that approved the work, and the associated permit number(s).\n\nWhere ethical approval is not required, the manuscript should include a clear statement of this and the reason why. Provide any relevant regulations under which the study is exempt from the requirement for approval.\n\nRelevant details of steps taken to ameliorate animal suffering.\n\nExample ethics statement\n\nThis study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Minnesota (Protocol Number: 27-2956). All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.\n\nAuthors should always state the organism(s) studied in the Abstract. Where the study may be confused as pertaining to clinical research, authors should also state the animal model in the title.\n\nTo maximize reproducibility and potential for re-use of data, we encourage authors to follow the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines for all submissions describing laboratory-based animal research and to upload a completed ARRIVE Guidelines Checklist to be published as supporting information.\n\nNon-human primates\n\nManuscripts describing research involving non-human primates must report details of husbandry and animal welfare in accordance with the recommendations of the Weatherall report, The use of non-human primates in research, including:\n\nInformation about housing, feeding, and environmental enrichment.\n\nSteps taken to minimize suffering, including use of anesthesia and method of sacrifice, if appropriate.\n\nRandom source animals\n\nManuscripts describing studies that use random source (e.g. Class B dealer-sourced in the USA), shelter, or stray animals will be subject to additional scrutiny and may be rejected if sufficient ethical and scientific justification for the study design is lacking.\n\nUnacceptable euthanasia methods and anesthetic agents\n\nManuscripts reporting use of a euthanasia method(s) classified as unacceptable by the American Veterinary Medical Association or use of an anesthesia method(s) that is widely prohibited (e.g., chloral hydrate, ether, chloroform) must include at the time of initial submission, scientific justification for use in the specific study design, as well as confirmation of approval for specific use from their animal research ethics committee. These manuscripts may be subject to additional ethics considerations prior to publication.\n\nHumane endpoints\n\nManuscripts reporting studies in which death of a regulated animal (vertebrate, cephalopod) is a likely outcome or a planned experimental endpoint, must comprehensively report details of study design, rationale for the approach, and methodology, including consideration of humane endpoints. This applies to research that involves, for instance, assessment of survival, toxicity, longevity, terminal disease, or high rates of incidental mortality.\n\nDefinition of a humane endpoint\n\nA humane endpoint is a predefined experimental endpoint at which animals are euthanized when they display early markers associated with death or poor prognosis of quality of life, or specific signs of severe suffering or distress. Humane endpoints are used as an alternative to allowing such conditions to continue or progress to death following the experimental intervention (“death as an endpoint”), or only euthanizing animals at the end of an experiment. Before a study begins, researchers define the practical observations or measurements that will be used during the study to recognize a humane endpoint, based on anticipated clinical, physiological, and behavioral signs. Please see the NC3Rs guidelines for more information. Additional discussion of humane endpoints can be found in this article: Nuno H. Franco, Margarida Correia-Neves, I. Anna S. Olsson (2012) How “Humane” Is Your Endpoint? — Refining the Science-Driven Approach for Termination of Animal Studies of Chronic Infection. PLoS Pathog 8(1): e1002399 doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002399.\n\nFull details of humane endpoints use must be reported for a study to be reproducible and for the results to be accurately interpreted.\n\nFor studies in which death of an animal is an outcome or a planned experimental endpoint, authors should include the following information in the Methods section of the manuscript:\n\nThe specific criteria (i.e. humane endpoints) used to determine when animals should be euthanized.\n\nThe duration of the experiment.\n\nThe numbers of animals used, euthanized, and found dead (if any); the cause of death for all animals.\n\nHow frequently animal health and behavior were monitored.\n\nAll animal welfare considerations taken, including efforts to minimize suffering and distress, use of analgesics or anaesthetics, or special housing conditions.\n\nIf humane endpoints were not used, the manuscript should report:\n\nA scientific justification for the study design, including the reasons why humane endpoints could not be used, and discussion of alternatives that were considered.\n\nWhether the institutional animal ethics committee specifically reviewed and approved the anticipated mortality in the study design.\n\nPaleontology and archaeology research\n\nManuscripts reporting paleontology and archaeology research must include descriptions of methods and specimens in sufficient detail to allow the work to be reproduced. Data sets supporting statistical and phylogenetic analyses should be provided, preferably in a format that allows easy re-use. Read the policy.\n\nSpecimen numbers and complete repository information, including museum name and geographic location, are required for publication. Locality information should be provided in the manuscript as legally allowable, or a statement should be included giving details of the availability of such information to qualified researchers.\n\nIf permits were required for any aspect of the work, details should be given of all permits that were obtained, including the full name of the issuing authority. This should be accompanied by the following statement:\n\nAll necessary permits were obtained for the described study, which complied with all relevant regulations.\n\nIf no permits were required, please include the following statement:\n\nNo permits were required for the described study, which complied with all relevant regulations.\n\nManuscripts describing paleontology and archaeology research are subject to the following policies:\n\nSharing of data and materials. Any specimen that is erected as a new species, described, or figured must be deposited in an accessible, permanent repository (i.e., public museum or similar institution). If study conclusions depend on specimens that do not fit these criteria, the article will be rejected under PLOS ONE's data availability criterion.\n\nEthics. PLOS ONE will not publish research on specimens that were obtained without necessary permission or were illegally exported.\n\nSystematic reviews and meta-analyses\n\nA systematic review paper, as defined by The Cochrane Collaboration, is a review of a clearly formulated question that uses explicit, systematic methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review. These reviews differ substantially from narrative-based reviews or synthesis articles. Statistical methods (meta-analysis) may or may not be used to analyze and summarize the results of the included studies.\n\nReports of systematic reviews and meta-analyses should include a completed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist and flow diagram to accompany the main text. Blank templates are available here:\n\nChecklist: PDF or Word document\n\nFlow diagram: PDF or Word document\n\nAuthors must also state in their “Methods” section whether a protocol exists for their systematic review, and if so, provide a copy of the protocol as supporting information and provide the registry number in the abstract.\n\nIf your article is a systematic review or a meta-analysis you should:\n\nState this in your cover letter\n\nSelect “Research Article” as your article type when submitting\n\nInclude the PRISMA flow diagram as Fig 1 (required where applicable)\n\nInclude the PRISMA checklist as supporting information\n\nMeta-analysis of genetic association studies\n\nManuscripts reporting a meta-analysis of genetic association studies must report results of value to the field and should be reported according to the guidelines presented in Systematic Reviews of Genetic Association Studies by Sagoo et al.\n\nOn submission, authors will be asked to justify the rationale for the meta-analysis and how it contributes to the base of scientific knowledge in the light of previously published results. Authors will also be asked to complete a checklist (DOCX) outlining information about the justification for the study and the methodology employed. Meta-analyses that replicate published studies will be rejected if the authors do not provide adequate justification.\n\nPersonal data from third-party sources\n\nFor all studies using personal data from internet-based and other third-party sources (e.g., social media, blogs, other internet sources, mobile phone companies), data must be collected and used according to company/website Terms and Conditions, with appropriate permissions. All data sources must be acknowledged clearly in the Materials and Methods section.\n\nIn the Ethics Statement, authors should declare any potential risks to individuals or individual privacy, or affirm that in their assessment, the study posed no such risks. In addition, the following Ethics and Data Protection requirements must be met.\n\nFor interventional studies, which impact participants’ experiences or data, the study design must have been prospectively approved by an Ethics Committee, and informed consent is required. The Ethics Committee may waive the requirement for approval and/or consent.\n\nFor observational studies in which personal experiences and accounts are not manipulated, consultation with an Ethics or Data Protection Committee is recommended. Additional requirements apply in the following circumstances:\n\nIf information used could threaten personal privacy or damage the reputation of individuals whose data are used, an Ethics Committee should be consulted and informed consent obtained or specifically addressed.\n\nIf authors accessed any personal identifying information, an Ethics or Data Protection Committee should oversee data anonymization. If data were anonymized and/or aggregated before access and analysis, informed consent is generally not required.\n\nNote that Terms of Use contracts do not qualify as informed consent, even if they address the use of personal data for research.\n\nCell lines\n\nAuthors reporting research using cell lines should state when and where they obtained the cells, giving the date and the name of the researcher, cell line repository, or commercial source (company) who provided the cells, as appropriate.\n\nAuthors must also include the following information for each cell line:\n\nFor de novo (new) cell lines, including those given to the researchers as a gift, authors must follow our policies for human subjects research or animal research, as appropriate. The ethics statement must include:\n\nDetails of institutional review board or ethics committee approval; AND\n\nFor human cells, confirmation of written informed consent from the donor, guardian, or next of kin\n\nFor established cell lines, the Methods section should include:\n\nA reference to the published article that first described the cell line; AND/OR\n\nThe cell line repository or company the cell line was obtained from, the catalogue number, and whether the cell line was obtained directly from the repository/company or from another laboratory\n\nAuthors should check established cell lines using the ICLAC Database of Cross-contaminated or Misidentified Cell Lines to confirm they are not misidentified or contaminated. Cell line authentication is recommended – e.g., by karyotyping, isozyme analysis, or short tandem repeats (STR) analysis – and may be required during peer review or after publication.\n\nBlots and gels\n\nPlease review PLOS ONE’s requirements for reporting blot and gel results and providing the underlying raw images.\n\nAntibodies\n\nManuscripts reporting experiments using antibodies should include the following information:\n\nThe name of each antibody, a description of whether it is monoclonal or polyclonal, and the host species.\n\nThe commercial supplier or source laboratory.\n\nThe catalogue or clone number and, if known, the batch number.\n\nThe antigen(s) used to raise the antibody.\n\nFor established antibodies, a stable public identifier from the Antibody Registry.\n\nThe manuscript should also report the following experimental details:\n\nThe final antibody concentration or dilution.\n\nA reference to the validation study if the antibody was previously validated. If not, provide details of how the authors validated the antibody for the applications and species used.\n\nWe encourage authors to consider adding information on new validations to a publicly available database such as Antibodypedia or CiteAb.\n\nSmall and macromolecule crystal data\n\nManuscripts reporting new and unpublished three-dimensional structures must include sufficient supporting data and detailed descriptions of the methodologies used to allow the reproduction and validation of the structures. All novel structures must have been deposited in a community endorsed database prior to submission (please see our list of recommended repositories).\n\nSmall molecule single crystal data\n\nAuthors reporting X-Ray crystallographic structures of small organic, metal-organic, and inorganic molecules must deposit their data with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC), the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), or similar community databases providing a recognized validation functionality. Authors are also required to include the relevant structure reference numbers within the main text (e.g. the CCDC ID number), as well as the crystallographic information files (.cif format) as Supplementary Information, along with the checkCIF validation reports that can be obtained via the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr).\n\nMacromolecular structures\n\nAuthors reporting novel macromolecular structures must have deposited their data prior to initial submission with the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB), the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB), the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB), or other community databases providing a recognized validation functionality. Authors must include the structure reference numbers within the main text and submit as Supplementary Information the official validation reports from these databases.\n\nMethods, software, databases, and tools\n\nPLOS ONE will consider submissions that present new methods, software, databases, or tools as the primary focus of the manuscript if they meet the following criteria:\n\nUtility\n\nThe tool must be of use to the community and must present a proven advantage over existing alternatives, where applicable. Recapitulation of existing methods, software, or databases is not useful and will not be considered for publication. Combining data and/or functionalities from other sources may be acceptable, but simpler instances (i.e. presenting a subset of an already existing database) may not be considered. For software, databases, and online tools, the long-term utility should also be discussed, as relevant. This discussion may include maintenance, the potential for future growth, and the stability of the hosting, as applicable.\n\nValidation\n\nSubmissions presenting methods, software, databases, or tools must demonstrate that the new tool achieves its intended purpose. If similar options already exist, the submitted manuscript must demonstrate that the new tool is an improvement over existing options in some way. This requirement may be met by including a proof-of-principle experiment or analysis; if this is not possible, a discussion of the possible applications and some preliminary analysis may be sufficient.\n\nAvailability\n\nIf the manuscript’s primary purpose is the description of new software or a new software package, this software must be open source, deposited in an appropriate archive, and conform to the Open Source Definition. If the manuscript mainly describes a database, this database must be open-access and hosted somewhere publicly accessible, and any software used to generate a database should also be open source. If relevant, databases should be open for appropriate deposition of additional data. Dependency on commercial software such as Mathematica and MATLAB does not preclude a paper from consideration, although complete open source solutions are preferred. In these cases, authors should provide a direct link to the deposited software or the database hosting site from within the paper. If the primary focus of a manuscript is the presentation of a new tool, such as a newly developed or modified questionnaire or scale, it should be openly available under a license no more restrictive than CC BY.\n\nSoftware submissions\n\nManuscripts whose primary purpose is the description of new software must provide full details of the algorithms designed. Describe any dependencies on commercial products or operating system. Include details of the supplied test data and explain how to install and run the software. A brief description of enhancements made in the major releases of the software may also be given. Authors should provide a direct link to the deposited software from within the paper.\n\nDatabase submissions\n\nFor descriptions of databases, provide details about how the data were curated, as well as plans for long-term database maintenance, growth, and stability. Authors should provide a direct link to the database hosting site from within the paper.\n\nNew taxon names\n\nZoological names\n\nWhen publishing papers that describe a new zoological taxon name, PLOS aims to comply with the requirements of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). Effective 1 January 2012, the ICZN considers an online-only publication to be legitimate if it meets the criteria of archiving and is registered in ZooBank, the ICZN's official registry.\n\nFor proper registration of a new zoological taxon, we require two specific statements to be included in your manuscript.\n\nIn the Results section, the globally unique identifier (GUID), currently in the form of a Life Science Identifier (LSID), should be listed under the new species name, for example:\n\nAnochetus boltoni Fisher sp. nov. urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:B6C072CF-1CA6-40C7-8396-534E91EF7FBB\n\nYou will need to contact Zoobank to obtain a GUID (LSID). Please do this as early as possible to avoid delay of publication upon acceptance of your manuscript. It is your responsibility to provide us with this information so we can include it in the final published paper.\n\nPlease also insert the following text into the Methods section, in a sub-section to be called “Nomenclatural Acts”:\n\nThe electronic edition of this article conforms to the requirements of the amended International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, and hence the new names contained herein are available under that Code from the electronic edition of this article. This published work and the nomenclatural acts it contains have been registered in ZooBank, the online registration system for the ICZN. The ZooBank LSIDs (Life Science Identifiers) can be resolved and the associated information viewed through any standard web browser by appending the LSID to the prefix “http://zoobank.org/”. The LSID for this publication is: urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub: XXXXXXX. The electronic edition of this work was published in a journal with an ISSN, and has been archived and is available from the following digital repositories: LOCKSS [author to insert any additional repositories].\n\nAll PLOS articles are deposited in LOCKSS. If your institute, or those of your co-authors, has its own repository, we recommend that you also deposit the published online article there and include the name in your article.\n\nBotanical names\n\nWhen publishing papers that describe a new botanical taxon, PLOS aims to comply with the requirements of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN). The following guidelines for publication in an online-only journal have been agreed such that any scientific botanical name published by us is considered effectively published under the rules of the Code. Please note that these guidelines differ from those for zoological nomenclature, and apply only to seed plants, ferns, and lycophytes.\n\nEffective January 2012, the description or diagnosis of a new taxon can be in either Latin or English. This does not affect the requirements for scientific names, which are still to be Latin.\n\nAlso effective January 2012, the electronic PDF represents a published work according to the ICN for algae, fungi, and plants. Therefore the new names contained in the electronic publication of PLOS article are effectively published under that Code from the electronic edition alone, so there is no longer any need to provide printed copies.\n\nAdditional information describing recent changes to the Code can be found here.\n\nFor proper registration of the new taxon, we require two specific statements to be included in your manuscript.\n\nIn the Results section, the globally unique identifier (GUID), currently in the form of a Life Science Identifier (LSID), should be listed under the new species name, for example:\n\nSolanum aspersum S.Knapp, sp. nov. [urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:77103633-1] Type: Colombia. Putumayo: vertiente oriental de la Cordillera, entre Sachamates y San Francisco de Sibundoy, 1600-1750 m, 30 Dec 1940, J. Cuatrecasas 11471 (holotype, COL; isotypes, F [F-1335119], US [US-1799731]).\n\nJournal staff will contact IPNI to obtain the GUID (LSID) after your manuscript is accepted for publication, and this information will then be added to the manuscript during the production phase\n\nIn the Methods section, include a sub-section called “Nomenclature” using the following wording:\n\nThe electronic version of this article in Portable Document Format (PDF) in a work with an ISSN or ISBN will represent a published work according to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, and hence the new names contained in the electronic publication of a PLOS article are effectively published under that Code from the electronic edition alone, so there is no longer any need to provide printed copies.\n\nIn addition, new names contained in this work have been submitted to IPNI, from where they will be made available to the Global Names Index. The IPNI LSIDs can be resolved and the associated information viewed through any standard web browser by appending the LSID contained in this publication to the prefix http://ipni.org/. The online version of this work is archived and available from the following digital repositories: [INSERT NAMES OF DIGITAL REPOSITORIES WHERE ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT WILL BE SUBMITTED (LOCKSS etc)].\n\nAll PLOS articles are deposited in LOCKSS. If your institute, or those of your co-authors, has its own repository, we recommend that you also deposit the published online article there and include the name in your article.\n\nFungal names\n\nWhen publishing papers that describe a new botanical taxon, PLOS aims to comply with the requirements of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN).

Please do this as early as possible to avoid delay of publication upon acceptance of your manuscript. It is your responsibility to provide us with this information so we can include it in the final published paper. Effective January 2013, all papers describing new fungal species must reference the identifier issued by a recognized repository in the protologue in order to be considered effectively published.\n\nIn the Methods section, include a sub-section called “Nomenclature” using the following wording. Note that this example is for taxon names submitted to MycoBank; please substitute appropriately if you have submitted to Index Fungorum using the prefix http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=.\n\nThe electronic version of this article in Portable Document Format (PDF) in a work with an ISSN or ISBN will represent a published work according to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, and hence the new names contained in the electronic publication of a PLOS article are effectively published under that Code from the electronic edition alone, so there is no longer any need to provide printed copies.\n\nIn addition, new names contained in this work have been submitted to MycoBank from where they will be made available to the Global Names Index. The unique MycoBank number can be resolved and the associated information viewed through any standard web browser by appending the MycoBank number contained in this publication to the prefix http://www.mycobank.org/MB/.

The analysis methods are explicit, systematic, and reproducible, but the results do not involve numerical values or use statistics. Examples of qualitative data sources include, but are not limited to, interviews, text documents, audio/video recordings, and free-form answers to questionnaires and surveys.\n\nQualitative research studies should be reported in accordance to the Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist or Standards for reporting qualitative research (SRQR) checklist. Further reporting guidelines can be found in the Equator Network's Guidelines for reporting qualitative research.\n\nYou may be eligible for APC support\n\nMany institutional partners globally have publishing agreements with PLOS to allow their corresponding authors to publish with reduced or no APCs. To determine if your corresponding author is eligible, please visit our institutional partners page to determine what kind of agreement your institution has with PLOS.\n\nIf your corresponding author is affiliated with a participating institution, they must follow the instructions below to demonstrate eligibility.\n\nRead the full instructions for submitting to a journal with the Flat Fee Agreement.\n\nIf your corresponding author is not from a participating institution and requires assistance paying publishing fees, please consider applying for a fee waiver at submission."
