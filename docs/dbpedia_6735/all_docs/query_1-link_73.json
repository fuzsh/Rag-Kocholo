Through proper planning, only the correct type, amount, and quality of information will be collected for EPA use.\n\nProper Evaluation of Internal and External Activities - The EPA Quality Program provides documentation of activities and improved oversight for evaluation purposes. This reduces the potential for waste and abuse.\n\nReliable and Defensible Decisions - When the quality of information is known, it is possible to determine whether the information can be used for a specific decision. This reduces challenges to regulations, permit appeals, etc.\n\nBurden Reduction - As EPA better defines the information needed for a specific application. The burden is on organizations who are required to collect, produce, evaluate or use information that is reported to EPA.\n\nOverall, implementation of the EPA Quality Program will reduce the Agency's vulnerabilities and increase EPA ability to make reliable, cost-effective, and defensible decisions.\n\nWhat activities does the EPA Quality Program cover?\n\nThe EPA Quality Program covers the collection, production, evaluation or use of environmental information by and for the Agency, and the design, construction and operation of environmental technology by the Agency. This includes environmental programs such as the:\n\ndemonstration of environmental technology\n\ninvestigation of chemical, biological, physical or radioactive constituents\n\ndevelopment, evaluation, and use of computer or mathematical models\n\nuse of information collected for other purposes or from other sources\n\nthe collection and use of information pertaining to the occupational health and safety of personnel in EPA facilities\n\nA list of some example activities are contained in Example Activities.\n\nWhat is the relationship between the EPA Quality Program and EPA's Information Quality Guidelines?\n\nEPA's Environmental Information Quality Policy includes procedures for developing and implementing program-specific quality-related activities. These activities then serve as a framework for information product developers to ensure that information products meet the specifications of the Information Quality Guidelines (IQG). For more information, see EPA's Information Quality Guidelines.\n\nWho is responsible for the EPA Quality Program?\n\nThe EPA Quality Program is decentralized so each EPA organization designs, implements, and manages its own quality program through their Quality Management Plan. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Deputy Assistant Administrator (DAA) for Information Technology/Information Management (IT/IM) serves as the Senior Quality Management Official for the Agency. This responsibility is delegated from the EPA Administrator and is stated in Environmental Information Quality Policy. The Enterprise Quality Management Division (EQMD), Office of Records, Administrative Systems and eDiscovery (ORASE), supports the CIO/DAA for IT/IM and is responsible for the development of Agency-wide policy and procedures and for the oversight of implementation of the Quality Program.\n\nWhat are the roles and responsibilities of the Enterprise Quality Management Division?\n\nEQMD is responsible for coordinating the implementation of the Agency Quality Program, developing Agency policies and procedures on quality, and providing training on quality issues. EQMD accomplishes these activities by:\n\ndeveloping Agency guidance and policy\n\nproviding training and training aids for quality assurance procedures\n\nreviewing Quality Management Plans and recommending Agency approval\n\nassessing implementation of established Quality Management Plans\n\nfacilitating communication among members of EPA's quality assurance community\n\nproviding general outreach and consulting services to the EPA quality assurance community\n\nFor more information on the policies and procedures for EQMD, see Policies and Procedures for EPA Organizations: Agency-wide Oversight.\n\nWhat are the roles and responsibilities of an EPA Quality Assurance Manager and quality management support personnel?\n\nEPA Quality Assurance Managers (QAMs) are tasked with reporting on quality issues to their senior management, providing independent oversight, and assuring the implementation of the organization's quality program. This individual must function independently of direct environmental information generation, model development, or technology development responsibility. The Quality Policy also defines the responsibilities of the QAM and other quality management personnel to include:\n\nfacilitating the development and maintain the organization's Quality Management Plan\n\nrepresenting the organization on matters pertaining to quality management\n\nproviding expert assistance to project personnel on quality assurance and quality control issues\n\ndeveloping and implementing a Quality Assurance Training Program\n\nreviewing and/or approving quality management documentation\n\nproviding quality management support to project personnel\n\noverseeing and assessing the organization's quality program\n\nIn addition to these general responsibilities, each EPA organization's Quality Management Plan defines specific responsibilities for its QAM and other quality management personnel.\n\nWhat are the main components of the EPA Quality Program?\n\nThe main components of the EPA Quality Program are described below. Each EPA organizations consider these components when developing their individual Quality Program.\n\nQuality Program Policies - Policies for EPA and Non-EPA organizations are contained in internal policy documents. See Specifications for EPA and Non-EPA Organizations for more information about these policy documents.\n\nQuality Program Documentation - Documentation that describes the authorities, policies, and procedures specific to an organization's quality. EPA organizations are required to develop a Quality Management Plan as documentation.\n\nAnnual Reviews and Planning - A yearly review of the activities within, and changes to, an organization's quality program; work accomplished; and future projects requiring quality management attention. EPA organizations are required to submit a Quality Assurance Annual Report and Work Plan to document this review.\n\nManagement Assessments - Assessments of a program and/or organization to determine the conformance of the quality program to policies, compliance with regulations, and conformance to the organization's quality program documentation. EPA uses Quality Program Assessments and other management assessments to assess EPA organizations and some supporting organizations.\n\nTraining - Methods and techniques to ensure that all personnel having responsibility within the quality program for management and information collection activities have the skills and knowledge to complete their tasks in accordance with their quality program's policies and procedures. EPA organizations are required to document their Training Program in their Quality Management Plan.\n\nProject Planning - Systematic planning (for example, the Data Quality Objective Process) is used to develop performance criteria for the data (i.e., the type, quantity, and quality of data needed to serve their needs) or technology design, to develop a plan to satisfy these criteria, and to determine the level of oversight and quality control activities needed to ensure the criteria are satisfied. The results from the systematic planning are documented in a Quality Assurance Project Plan.\n\nProject Implementation - Information is collected and environmental technology is implemented according to the methods and procedures documented in the approved Quality Assurance Project Plan, Standard Operating Procedures, and design documentation. During information collection, oversight may be performed using technical audits that are conducted to assess whether or not information is being collected as stated in the Quality Assurance Project Plan.\n\nProject Assessment - Analysts use technical knowledge and statistical methods to determine whether or not the collected information meet the user's needs. The information is formally verified and validated to ensure that the measured values are free of gross errors due to procedural or technical problems and then are analyzed to determine if they meet the performance criteria documented in the Quality Assurance Project Plan (data quality assessment) or other design documentation.\n\nHow is a 'graded approach' applied to EPA's Quality Program?\n\nBecause of the diversity of work conducted by the Agency, EPA recognizes that a \"one size fits all\" approach to quality specifications will not work. Therefore, the implementation of the EPA Quality Program is based on a graded approach. Applying a graded approach means that quality programs for different organizations will vary according to the specific objectives and needs of the organization. For example, the quality controls of a fundamental research program are different from that of a regulatory compliance program because the purpose or intended use of the information is different. Once a graded approach has been applied to the components of a quality program, a graded approach is then applied to the documentation.\n\nGeneral Quality Program Questions\n\nWhat is a quality program?\n\nA quality program is the means by which an organization manages its quality aspects in a systematic, organized manner and provides a framework for planning, implementing, and assessing work performed by an organization and for carrying out required quality assurance and quality control activities. It encompasses a variety of technical and administrative elements, including:\n\npolicies and objectives,\n\norganizational authority,\n\nresponsibilities,\n\naccountability, and\n\nprocedures and practices.\n\nDoes a quality program ensure that information collected is 'good'?\n\nNo. Information is neither 'good' or 'bad' but rather information is either useful for its intended purpose or not useful for its intended purpose. One must know in what context the information is to be used to judge whether or not the information is adequate.\n\nWhat is the difference between quality program, quality assurance and quality control?\n\nA Quality Program is the totality of management controls, processes, and documentation in EPA’s planning, implementation, and assessment for ensuring the quality of Agency environmental information operations products and services.\n\nQuality assurance is the management of an integrated system of activities involving planning, implementation, documentation, assessment, reporting, and quality improvement to ensure that a process, item, or service is of the type and quality needed and expected by the organization.\n\nQuality control is the overall system of technical activities that measures the attributes and performance of a process, item, or service against defined standards to verify that they meet the stated requirements; operational techniques and activities that are used to fulfill requirements for quality.\n\nWhat is the difference between a Quality Management Plan and a Quality Assurance Project Plan?\n\nA Quality Management Plan is a formal document that describes a Quality Program in terms of the organizational structure, functional responsibilities of management and staff, lines of authority, and required interfaces for those planning, implementing, and assessing all activities conducted.\n\nA Quality Assurance Project Plan is a planning document related to a project or program that describes in comprehensive detail the necessary QA/QC requirements and other technical activities that must be implemented to ensure that the results of the work performed will satisfy the stated performance and acceptance criteria.\n\nWhich EPA documents do I use to implement and manage my quality program?\n\nRefer to the Quality Directives Table to determine which Directives are applicable to your organization.\n\nMust a Quality Management Plan be called a Quality Management Plan, and similarly, must a Quality Assurance Project Plan be called a Quality Assurance Project Plan?\n\nYes. Refer to the Quality Management Plan Standard and the Quality Assurance Project Plan Standard.\n\nEPA Organizations and Personnel\n\nWhat EPA organizations are covered by the EPA Quality Program?\n\nAll EPA organizations that collect, produce, evaluate, or use environmental information or design, construct, or operate environmental technology are covered by the EPA Quality Program. EPA organizations that maintain quality programs include EPA Regions, National Program Offices, and the Office of Research and Development.\n\nWhat Quality Program specifications apply to my organization?\n\nEPA organizations must develop, implement, and maintain a quality program that is consistent with the requirements included in ASQ/ANSI E4.\n\nSpecific specifications for EPA organizations are defined in Environmental Information Quality Policy. Supplemental information is contained in Environmental Information Quality Procedure.\n\nWhat EPA Quality Program specifications apply to me?\n\nDepending on your job function, different quality specifications apply to you. Responsibilities for EPA Senior Managers, quality management personnel, EPA managers and staff are all described in Environmental Information Quality Policy. Program-specific responsibilities are described in your organization's Quality Management Plan.\n\nHowever, all EPA employees must ensure that all applicable intramural programs and activities comply with Environmental Information Quality Policy; ensure all applicable extramural environmental programs comply fully with the Code of Federal Regulations; and assure that the results of environmental programs are of sufficient quantity and adequate quality for their intended use.\n\nWho is my Quality Assurance Manager?\n\nA list of EPA Quality Assurance Managers (QAMs) is provided at Quality Assurance Managers (QAMs). If your organization does not appear, please contact EQMD at quality@epa.gov to determine your Quality Assurance Manager.\n\nWhere can I get a copy of my Organization's Quality Management Plan?\n\nContact your supervisor or QAM for the most recent version of your organization's Quality Management Plan.\n\nWhere can I find more information for EPA organizations?\n\nFor more information for EPA organizations, see Specifications for EPA and Non-EPA Organizations.\n\nWhere do I find a list of QAMs responsible for EPA's Quality Program?\n\nTo view a list of the QAMs responsible for EPA's Quality Program, see Quality Assurance Managers (QAMs).\n\nWhere do I find specific information by EPA Region?\n\nTo find specific information by EPA region, see Regional Offices.\n\nWhere can I find National Program Manager Guidance?\n\nNational operational framework used by the regions, states, and tribes to implement programmatic activities.\n\nSystematic Planning\n\nWhat is systematic planning?\n\nWhy systematically plan projects?\n\nWhat are the elements of systematic planning?\n\nDo I need to systematically plan my projects?\n\nHow do I systematically plan my projects?\n\nWhat are some examples of systematic planning processes?\n\nHow do I document my systematic planning?\n\nWhat is systematic planning?\n\nSystematic planning is a methodical, or ordered, approach to planning. EPA uses systematic planning to plan projects and link goals, cost and schedule and quality criteria with the final outputs.\n\nWhy systematically plan projects?\n\nSystematic planning ensures that all participants understand the needs and expectations of the customer and the product or results to be provided by the supplier. It also results in:\n\na project's logical development\n\nefficient use of resources\n\ntransparency of intent and direction\n\ndefensibility of project results\n\nappropriate documentation\n\nPlanning a project before resources are expended reduces waste and rework.\n\nWhat are the elements of systematic planning?\n\nEPA's elements of systematic planning are stated in Section 5 of the Environmental Information Quality Procedure and include:\n\nIdentification and involvement of the project manager, sponsoring organization and responsible official, project personnel, stakeholders, scientific experts, etc.;\n\nDescription of the project goal, objectives, and questions and issues to be addressed;\n\ndentification of project schedule, resources (including budget), milestones, and any applicable requirements (e.g., regulatory requirements, contractual requirements);\n\nIdentification of the type of information needed and how the information will be used to support the project’s objectives;\n\nDetermination of the quantity of information needed and specification of performance criteria for measuring quality;\n\nDescription of how, when, and where the information will be obtained (including existing information) and identification of any constraints on information collection;\n\nSpecification of needed QA and QC activities to assess the quality performance criteria (e.g., QC samples for both the field and laboratory, audits, technical assessments, performance evaluations, sensitivity analysis of models, etc.);\n\nDescription of how the acquired information will be analyzed, evaluated (i.e., QA review, validation, verification), and assessed against its intended use and the quality performance criteria.\n\nDo I need to systematically plan my projects?\n\nThe Environmental Information Quality Policy states that all EPA organizations shall use a systematic planning process to develop acceptance or performance criteria for the collection, production, evaluation, or use of environmental information.\n\nHow do I systematically plan my projects?\n\nYour organization's Quality Management Plan may specify a process for you to use. Program-specific guidance may also be available to help you (for example, the Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual provides information on planning, conducting, evaluating and documenting environmental radiological surveys of surface soil and building surfaces for demonstrating compliance with regulations.) Review applicable regulations to ensure the appropriate planning elements. If you need additional information refer to the Elements of Systematic Planning.\n\nWhat are some examples of systematic planning processes?\n\nThe scientific method and the observational method are both examples of systematic planning processes. Processes have been created for specific applications include:\n\nThe Data Quality Objectives (DQO) Process - EPA's recommended systematic planning tool. For resources on the Data Quality Process, see Elements of Systematic Planning.\n\nThe Triad Approach - EPA's planning process for the Agency's hazardous waste remediation programs.\n\nHow do I document my systematic planning?\n\nThe results of systematic planning are documented in a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) or an equivalent document. QAPP requirements are listed in the Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) Standard . Consult your organization's Quality Assurance Manager or your Quality Management Plan for documentation specifics.\n\nEPA Methods\n\nWhere can I find out information regarding EPA methods?\n\nWhere can I find out information regarding EPA methods?\n\nApproved methods for measuring the concentration of a substance or pollutant.\n\nEPA Standards\n\nWhere can I find information regarding EPA water quality standards?\n\nWhere can I find information regarding EPA air quality standards?\n\nWhere can I find information regarding EPA data standards?\n\nWhere can I find information regarding the EPA IM/IT directives? (including their associated policies, procedures, standards and guidance)\n\nWhere can I find information on laboratory competency?\n\nWhere can I find information regarding EPA water quality standards?\n\nWater quality standards: regulations and resources.\n\nWhere can I find information regarding EPA air quality standards?\n\nClean Air Act, primary and secondary standards.\n\nWhere can I find information regarding EPA data standards?\n\nData standards adopted by EPA for use by Agency programs.\n\nWhere can I find information regarding the EPA IM/IT directives? (including their associated policies, procedures, standards and guidance)\n\nCurrent information directives.\n\nWhere can I find information on laboratory competency?\n\nInformation on laboratory competency.\n\nExamples and Templates\n\nQuality Assurance Project Plans (QAPP)\n\nWhere can I find more information on QA Project Plans?\n\nWhat is a QA Project Plan?\n\nWhy do I have to write a QA Project Plan?\n\nHow do I develop a QA Project Plan?\n\nWhere can I find some tools and templates to help me prepare a QA Project Plan?\n\nWhere are content specifications for QA Project Plans defined?\n\nI have a Quality Management Plan, do I still need a QA Project Plan?\n\nWho is responsible for implementing the QA Project Plan?\n\nWhom do I contact if I have questions?\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\n\nWhere can I find more information on SOPs?\n\nWhat is a SOP?\n\nHow should a SOP be organized?\n\nHow much detail needs to be included in a SOP?\n\nWho should write a SOP?\n\nWhat is the benefit of having a SOP?\n\nI am following a published method. Do I have to have a SOP?\n\nQuality Management Plans\n\nWhere can I find more information on QMPs?\n\nWhat is a Quality Management Plan?\n\nWhat organizations are required to have a QMP?\n\nWhere are the specifications for QMPs established?\n\nHow often do organizations review their QMP?\n\nWhat documents will help me prepare my QMP?\n\nWho reviews and approves QMPs?\n\nHow long does approval of a QMP last?\n\nIf my QMP is subject to EQMD review and OMS approval, is an \"informal\" review possible?\n\nIf my QMP is subject to EQMD review and OMS approval, what do I submit for a \"formal\" review?\n\nHow long does it take EQMD to review a \"formal\" QMP submission?\n\nWhat criteria does EQMD use to review a QMP during informal and formal review?\n\nMy EPA organization is developing a QMP for EQMD review and approval - what assistance is available?\n\nWill EQMD notify me when my organization's QMP is going to expire?\n\nWhen do I need to resubmit my QMP for EQMD approval?\n\nQuality Assurance Project Plans\n\nWhere can I find more information on QA Project Plans?\n\nFor more information on QA Project Plans, see Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP)Standard.\n\nWhat is a QA Project Plan?\n\nA QA Project Plan is a planning document related to a project that describes in comprehensive detail the necessary Quality Assurance/Quality Control requirements and other technical activities that must be implemented to ensure that the results of the work performed will satisfy the stated performance and acceptance criteria.\n\nWhy do I have to write a QA Project Plan?\n\nEPA requires approved QA Project Plans (or equivalent documents) for all applicable projects and tasks involving environmental information to ensure the project and task is documented and reviewed before the work is started. The need to write a QA Project Plan applies is defined in Environmental Information Quality Policy when EPA conducts a project directly, or in the applicable Federal Regulations (see Specifications for EPA and Non-EPA Organizations) when EPA is funding the project under a grant, contract, or other agreement.\n\nHow do I develop a QA Project Plan?\n\nDevelopment of a QA Project Plan should be a multi-step process involving a number of people. The following is a brief summary of the process:\n\nAssemble a project team and \"systematically plan\" what needs to be done.\n\nWrite the QA Project Plan using the results of that planning process.\n\nSubmit the QA Project Plan for review and approval.\n\nOnce approved, distribute the QA Project Plan to all pertinent individuals involved with the project or program.\n\nBegin work, but remember to:\n\ndocument any changes in QA Project Plan; and if necessary, get re-approval and distribute the update version to all persons\n\nreview the QA Project Plan on a systematic basis to ensure that it remains up-to-date.\n\nWhere can I find some tools and templates to help me prepare a QA Project Plan?\n\nNational programs and regions have developed many helpful tools and templates, below are some examples:\n\nSecondary Data Use template, and information for QAPP preparation provided by Region 3.\n\nSurface or groundwater monitoring and/or collection and analysis of water samples Quality Assurance (QA) Project Plan tool from the Office of Water.\n\nDesign and Implementation of New Tools for Quality Assurance in Modeling developed by Region 1, New England.\n\nTotal Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program design and implementation of new tools for Quality Assurance in Modeling from Region 1, New England.\n\nStreamlined QAPP tables/templates that may be included in a QAPP to summarize information, supplement and simplify the text or to create a useful list provided by Region 1, New England.\n\nTribal from Region 6:\n\nTribal guidance on preparing a QA Project Plan\n\nFictitious example of a Tribal QA Project Plan\n\nSampling and analysis plan from Region 6:\n\nSampling and analysis plan guidance and template for general projects\n\nSampling and analysis plan guidance and template for Brownfields Assessment Projects (doc)(111 pp, 297 K)\n\nQuality assessment checklist (doc)(9 pp, 177 K)\n\nWhere are content specifications for QA Project Plans defined?\n\nSpecifications for those receiving EPA funds for environmental activities are defined in the Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) Standard. For EPA personnel, content specifications are defined in Chapter 5 of the Environmental Information Quality Policy. Because the 'Requirements' document is clearer, more user-friendly and less repetitive, EPA recommends that EPA personnel use this document in lieu of the Manual.\n\nI have a Quality Management Plan, do I still need a QA Project Plan?\n\nYes. A Quality Management Plan describes the organization's quality program, that is, its management structure for quality, while the QA Project Plan describes the necessary quality assurance, quality control and other technical activities that must be implemented for a specific project. For small programs, grants and contracts, these two documents may be combined into a single document, with permission of the EPA QA Manager of the organization sponsoring the work. The combined document will need to address all the elements defined by the EPA QA Manager and include documentation of both the organization's quality program and the application of this system to the work to be performed.\n\nWho is responsible for implementing the QA Project Plan?\n\nThe organization performing the work is responsible for ensuring that the QA Project Plan is approved prior to the commencement of any work and that it is implemented as written. All project personnel should understand the specifications prior to the start of information generation activities and ensure that the plan is implemented as written and that all changes are documented and approved prior to their being made.\n\nFor recipients of EPA funds, the QA Manager of the funding EPA office should be contacted. For internal EPA projects, the QA Manager of that organization should be contacted. A list of all EPA QA Managers is available at Quality Program Contacts.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\n\nWhere can I find more information on SOPs?\n\nFor more information on SOPs, see Quality Management Tools - Standard Operating Procedures.\n\nWhat is a SOP?\n\nA SOP is a set of written instructions that document a routine or repetitive activity. SOPs describe both technical and administrative operational elements.\n\nHow should a SOP be organized?\n\nA SOP should be organized to ensure ease and efficiency in use and to be specific to the organization which develops it. There is no one 'correct' format for writing a SOP.\n\nHow much detail needs to be included in a SOP?\n\nA SOP should be written with sufficient detail so that someone with a basic understanding of the activity, can successfully repeat the activity.\n\nWho should write a SOP?\n\nSOPs should be written by individuals knowledgeable with the activity. These individuals are essentially subject-matter experts who actually perform the work or use the process. A team approach can also be followed, especially for multi-tasked processes where the experiences of a number of individuals are critical.\n\nWhat is the benefit of having a SOP?\n\nThe development and use of SOPs is an integral part of a successful quality program. It provides individuals with the information to perform a job properly and facilitates consistency. When historical information is being evaluated for current use, SOPs can be valuable for reconstructing project activities. In addition, SOPs are frequently used as checklists by inspectors when auditing procedures. Ultimately, the benefits of a SOP is knowledge transfer.\n\nI am following a published method. Do I have to have a SOP?\n\nYes. SOPs are needed even when published methods are being utilized because cited published methods may not contain pertinent information for conducting the procedure in-house. For example, if the SOP is written for a standard analytical method, the SOP should specify the procedures to be followed in greater detail than appear in the published method, detailing how, if at all, the SOP differs from the standard method and any options, changes or adjustments that the organization follows.\n\nQuality Management Plans\n\nWhere can I find more information on QMPs?\n\nFor more information on QMPs, see Quality Management Plan Standard.\n\nWhat is a Quality Management Plan?\n\nA formal document that describes a Quality Program in terms of the organizational structure, functional responsibilities of management and staff, lines of authority, and required interfaces for those planning, implementing, and assessing all activities conducted.\n\nWhat organizations are required to have a QMP?\n\nAll EPA and non-EPA organizations conducting environmental information operations on behalf of EPA are required to establish and implement a quality program. This includes work performed in support of EPA's mission or national priorities as defined by and in accordance with:\n\nfederal laws and legal requirements including administrative orders/enforcement actions,\n\nregulations,\n\nextramural agreements, or\n\nperforming work on a voluntary basis under agreement with EPA.\n\nNon-EPA organizations include but are not limited to:\n\ncontractors,\n\nregulated parties,\n\ncooperative agreement holders,\n\ngrantees,\n\nstates, tribes, localities, intergovernmental agencies,\n\neducational institutions, hospitals, non-profits,\n\nother federal governmental agencies, and parties to Memoranda of Agreement or Understanding,\n\nvolunteer organizations, and\n\nother environmental information providers.\n\nSince non-EPA organizations may participate in more than one extramural agreement with EPA, the organization’s QMP may contain common management information that may be applied to more than one agreement.\n\nWhere are the specifications for QMPs established?\n\nEPA organizations: The need to have a Quality Program is documented in a QMP, and established in the Environmental Information Quality Policy and Environmental Information Quality Procedure. The required contents of the QMP are specified in the QMP Standard.\n\nNon-EPA organizations: The need to have a Quality Program, and to document this Program in a QMP, is established through Federal Regulations. For more information, refer to Specifications for EPA and Non-EPA Organizations and contact the QA Manager of the organization sponsoring the work.\n\nHow often do organizations review their QMP?\n\nAnnually, as defined in the Quality Management Plan Standard.\n\nWhat documents will help me prepare my QMP?\n\nWhen preparing a QMP, you should follow the Quality Management Plan Standard and use the EPA Checklist for Reviewing Quality Management Plans to verify that applicable requirements are included. EPA organizations should also consult Section 5 B of Environmental Information Quality Procedure which contains equivalent specifications to this 'Requirements' document.\n\nWho reviews and approves QMPs?\n\nEPA Organizations: The Office of Records, Administrative Systems and eDiscovery (ORASE) Enterprise Quality Management Division (EQMD) is responsible for reviewing Agency QMPs required by Environmental Information Quality Policy and the CIO/DAA for IT/IM approves these QMPs. EPA Organizations with approved QMPs are responsible for the review and approval of QMPs from their supporting organizations. Procedures for review and approval of supporting QMPs are defined in the organization's approved QMP.\n\nNon-EPA Organizations: When a QMP is required either by statute, contractual requirement, or assistance agreement, the QMP must be submitted for review and approval to the EPA official responsible for the work. The EPA official may include the contracting officer's representative (such as the project officer, work assignment manager, or delivery order project officer), the award official, or the EPA QA Manager. For example, a State QMP that has been submitted as part of a request for an assistance agreement may be reviewed and approved by the QA Manager of the Regional Office awarding the assistance agreement.\n\nHow long does approval of a QMP last?\n\nEPA Organizations: Approval is valid for five years unless there is a major reorganization or mission change that affects the Quality functions and structures in the organization. If an assessment of the organization's Quality Program determines that the existing QMP is not being implemented as written, then the organization must either implement the Quality Program as approved or revise the QMP to reflect its operations.\n\nNon-EPA Organizations: Approval is valid for no more than five years for State, local and Tribal governments or the length of the extramural agreement for all other extramural agreement holders unless there is a major reorganization or mission change that affects the Quality functions and structures in the organization. The period for which a QMP is valid is defined in the QMP of the EPA organization sponsoring the work.\n\nIf my QMP is subject to EQMD review and OMS approval, is an \"informal\" review possible?\n\nYes. EQMD will review an organization's draft, unsigned QMP. EQMD will inform the organization after they complete their review and identify if additional changes are needed or if the organization may proceed with obtaining signatures.\n\nIf my QMP is subject to EQMD review and OMS approval, what do I submit for a \"formal\" review?\n\nThe senior manager, in coordination with the QAM, should submit the signed QMP, a completed copy of the EPA Checklist for Reviewing Quality Management Plans, and all referenced attachments to EQMD. The QMP must be signed by the organization's senior managers and QAM.\n\nHow long does it take EQMD to review a \"formal\" QMP submission?\n\nEQMD's total review time goal is 45 working days.\n\nWhat criteria does EQMD use to review a QMP during informal and formal review?\n\nA QMP review verifies the identified requirements listed in the EPA Checklist for Reviewing Quality Management Plans. If a required element is not addressed, the reviewer must verify that this element is not applicable for that specific organization. In addition, any required corrective actions from quality program assessments must also be identified and verified as resolved.\n\nWill EQMD notify my organization prior to my QMP's sunset date?\n\nEQMD notifies the organization's QA Manager six months prior to the sunset date.\n\nWhen do I need to resubmit my QMP for EQMD review?\n\nYou should submit your QMP 60 days prior to the sunset date. Use the table below to determine when a QMP should be resubmitted.\n\nReason for Updating QMP Action Needed to Maintain Agency-Approval Minor updates Report in your QAARWP. Reorganization Current QMP sunset date is 6 months from effective date of reorganization. Submit revised QMP for review and approval. Mission Change Current QMP sunset date is 6 months from effective date of mission change. Submit revised QMP for review and approval. Update due to 5-year approval sunset Submit revised QMP for review and approval. EQMD assessment required revision as a corrective action Submit revised QMP for review and approval. Current approval sunset date will be identified in final report. EQMD assessment recommended revision (not as a corrective action) Report status in your QAARWP.\n\nTraining\n\nWhat training does EPA provide?\n\nWhat training does EPA provide?\n\nEQMD provides train-the-trainer courses based on the Quality Program Directives to EPA QAMs. This training may be tailored by an organization to meet their specific needs. Also, Agency training is available and you may contact the appropriate QAM of an EPA organization for additional QA training.\n\nInformation Quality Guidelines\n\nWhat is a Request for Correction under the Information Quality Guidelines?\n\nHow do I submit a Request for Correction?\n\nHow does EPA expect to respond to my request?\n\nWhat if my request concerns information on which EPA has sought public comment?\n\nWhat if I disagree with EPA's decision regarding my Request for Correction?\n\nHow does EPA intend to process my Request for Reconsideration?\n\nWhat is a Request for Correction under the Information Quality Guidelines?\n\nEPA developed their Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility and Integrity of Information Disseminated by the Environmental Protection Agency to comply with the Office of Management and Budget Guidelines (67 FR 8451, February 22, 2002) (PDF). Section 515 of the \"Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for FY 2001 (Public Law 106-554)\" directed OMB to issue government-wide guidelines that \"provide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility and integrity of information, including statistical information, disseminated by Federal Agencies.\"\n\nThe guidelines create a mechanism that enables the public to seek and obtain, where appropriate, correction of information disseminated by the Agency that does not comply with EPA or OMB Information Quality Guidelines (IQGs). If you believe that information disseminated by EPA may not comply with the Guidelines, we encourage you to consult informally with the contact person listed in the information product before submitting a request for correction.\n\nHow do I submit a Request for Correction?\n\nOnce you have determined that filing a Request for Correction (RFC) is appropriate, you should provide a request to the EPA that includes:\n\nContact Information:\n\nContact name\n\nOrganization\n\nPhone number\n\nPhysical address\n\nE-mail address\n\nA description of the information you believe does not comply with the Office of Management and Budget Guidelines (PDF) or EPA Information Quality Guidelines, including specific citations to the information and to the IQGs.\n\nA recommendation for corrective action.\n\nAn explanation of how the alleged error affects or how a correction would benefit you.\n\nNote: EPA policy is that RFCs and Request for Reconsideration (RFR) will generally be made available for public viewing on the Internet. Any personal information you choose to include in your request may be publicly disclosed on the Internet or otherwise as required by law.\n\nRFCs may be submitted to EPA using any of the following methods:\n\nE-mail: Enterprise Quality Management Division at Quality@epa.gov\n\nMail:\n\nEnterprise Quality Management Division\n\nUSEPA Headquarters\n\n1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW\n\nMail Code 2821T\n\nWashington, DC 20460\n\nDelivery:\n\nWilliam Jefferson Clinton West Building\n\nEnterprise Quality Management Division\n\n1301 Constitution Ave., NW\n\nRoom 6408A\n\nWashington, DC 20004\n\nView previously submitted Request for Correction and Reconsideration\n\nHow does EPA expect to respond to my request?\n\nEPA's goal is to respond to your request within 120 days of receipt, by providing either a decision on the request or an estimate of the time for decision that is agreeable to you. If your request is approved, EPA would determine what type of corrective action is appropriate. Whether or not EPA determines that corrective action is appropriate, we will provide you with a notice of the decision.\n\nWhat if my request concerns information on which EPA has sought public comment?\n\nWhere EPA has provided a structured opportunity for public comment on information in a draft or proposed document, EPA generally expects to treat RFCs procedurally like other public comments, addressing them in the response to comments rather than through a separate response mechanism. EPA believes that the thorough consideration provided by the public comment process serves the purposes of the IQGs, provides an opportunity for correction of any information that does not comply with the IQGs and does not duplicate or interfere with the orderly conduct of the action.\n\nEPA generally will not consider a RFC that could have been submitted during the comment period of a rulemaking or other action. If EPA cannot respond to a RFC in the response to comments for the action (for example, because the request/comment is submitted too late to be considered and could not have been timely submitted, or because the request is not applicable to the action), EPA will consider whether a separate response is appropriate.\n\nWhat if I disagree with EPA's decision regarding my Request for Correction?\n\nIf you disagree with EPA's decision on your RFC, you may submit a Request for Reconsideration (RFR). EPA recommends this request be submitted within 90 days of the date of EPA's decision on the RFC. Your request should be identified as an RFR by including \"Request for Reconsideration\" in the subject or title. The request should include the following information:\n\nRFC number provided in the EPA response\n\nDate of the original submission of the RFC\n\nDate of EPA's decision on the RFC\n\nName and contact information. Organizations submitting an RFR should identify an individual as a contact\n\nAn explanation of why the person disagrees with the EPA RFC's decision\n\nA specific recommendation for corrective action\n\nYou may submit an RFR via any one of the methods below:\n\nE-mail: Enterprise Quality Management Division at Quality@epa.gov\n\nMail:\n\nEnterprise Quality Management Division\n\nUSEPA Headquarters\n\n1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW\n\nMail Code 2821T\n\nWashington, DC 20460\n\nDelivery:\n\nWilliam Jefferson Clinton West Building\n\nEnterprise Quality Management Division\n\n1301 Constitution Ave., NW\n\nRoom 6408A\n\nWashington, DC 20004\n\nNote: EPA policy is that RFCs and RFRs will generally be made available for public viewing on the Internet. Any personal information you choose to include in your request may be publicly disclosed on the Internet or otherwise as required by law.\n\nHow does EPA intend to process my Request for Reconsideration?\n\nAn Executive Panel makes EPA's final decision on the RFR. If your request is approved, EPA will determine what type of corrective action is appropriate. Whether or not EPA determines that corrective action is appropriate, you will be notified of the final decision.\n\nCitizen Science QAPP\n\nWhere can I find out information regarding a Citizen Science QAPP?\n\nWhere can I find out information regarding a Citizen Science QAPP?\n\nClick here for the link to the Handbook for Citizen Science Quality Assurance and Documentation.\n\nOther Related Topics of Interest\n\nHow do I report a data error on the website to the Agency?\n\nWhere can I find and review quality specifications for Non-EPA Organizations?\n\nHow do I report a data error on the website to the Agency?\n\nUse the EPA Integrated Error Correction Process to report a data error on the EPA Website. This process enables the public to notify EPA of a data error. The Integrated Error Correction Process involves routing the error notification to the appropriate office who has the authority to make corrections.
