[Answer]\n\nDoes the receipt of confidential and proprietary information present problems for program managers and contracting officers during the acquisition process? [Answer]\n\n2. If the Government acquires a data rights license, who owns the copyright in technical data and computer software?\n\nContractors generally retain copyright ownership of the noncommercial technical data and noncommercial computer software that they develop and deliver under DoD contracts, although they may agree under terms negotiated by the parties to assign the copyright to the Government.\n\n4. What is the scope of these licensing rights?\n\nAn “unlimited rights” license means that the Government can use, modify, reproduce, release or disclose technical data or computer software in whole or in part, in any manner, and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or authorize others to do so.\n\nA “Government Purpose rights” license means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release or disclose the technical data or computer software within the Government without restriction and outside the Government for a Government purpose – “any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations or sales or transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or international organizations. Government purposes include competitive procurement, but do not include use for commercial purposes.”\n\nA Government purpose license remains in effect for 5 years unless the parties negotiate a different period. Upon expiration of the five-year term or other negotiated period, the Government shall have an “unlimited rights” license in the noncommercial technical data or noncommercial computer software.\n\n“Restricted rights” applies to only noncommercial computer software and mean the Government’s rights to use a computer program with one computer at one time; transfer a computer program to another Government agency without permission of the Contractor if the transferor destroys all copies of the program and related computer documentation; make the minimum number of copies of computer software required for safekeeping (archive), backup or modification purposes; modify computer software; and permit contractors or subcontractors performing services in support of a contract to use computer software for correcting deficiencies.\n\n“Limited rights” means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the Government.\n\n6. What are the relevant data rights clauses to include in solicitations and government contracts to ensure that the agency obtains the appropriate licensing rights?\n\nThe following chart summarizes the appropriate DFARS clauses to include in solicitations and contracts for the acquisition of technical data, computer software and computer software documentation. However, the circumstances of each acquisition may vary. THEREFORE, LEGAL COUNSEL SHOULD ALWAYS BE CONSULTED ON THE APPROPRIATE DFARS CLAUSES TO INCLUDE IN THE CONTRACT.\n\nFAR/ DFARS PATENT, TECHNICAL DATA, AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE CLAUSES\n\nTD = Technical Data CS = Computer Software ICP = Item, Component, or process CSD = Computer Software Documentation = TD\n\nWhen to Incorporate Clauses/Provisions 252.227 7013 7014 7015 7016 7017 7019 7028 7030 7037 Mandatory if TD for noncommercial ICP is to be delivered X X X X X X Mandatory if noncommercial CS is to be delivered X X X X X Mandatory if TD for commercial items is to be delivered X X Strongly recommended in all solicitations X X X X X X X X X Strongly recommended in all contracts X X X X X X X\n\nSPECIFIC CLAUSES & THEIR USE (See DFARS for Titles):\n\n252.227-7018: All SBIR contracts. (Do not use -7013 or -7014.)\n\n252.227-7025: All if access to less than unlimited rights TD/CS is anticipated. Strongly recommended in all contracts.\n\n252.227-7026: Voluntary clause used only to specifically identify at award TD & CS which may be ordered later.\n\n252.227-7027: Voluntary clause used to order additional deliverables for TD & CS “generated” during performance of the instant contract. Strongly recommended in all solicitations and contracts.\n\n52.227-1: All contracts and solicitations with limited exceptions.\n\n52.227-2: All contracts and solicitations with limited exceptions.\n\n52.227-3: Limited mandatory use in sealed bidding for “commercial” supplies/services & construction with many prohibitions on use.\n\n52.227-10: All which might result in a classified invention/patent.\n\n52.227-11: All R&D [DOD uses this clause with small business or nonprofit].\n\n252.227-7038: All R&D except when 52.227-11 used.\n\n252.227-7039: All if 52.227-11 is used.\n\n252.246-7001: Strongly urged whenever any technical data or software will be delivered under the contract. Using the clause avoids acceptance being “final” with respect to nonconforming markings. Review 246.708 and 246.710 for applicability.\n\n8. Are there broad principles to consider when acquiring licensing rights?\n\nYes, DoD’s “Intellectual Property: Navigating Through Commercial Waters” identifies the following core principles:\n\nIntegrate IP considerations fully into acquisition strategies for advanced technologies in order to protect core DoD interests.\n\nRespect and protect privately developed IP.\n\nResolve issues prior to award by clearly identifying and distinguishing the IP deliverables from the license rights in those deliverables.\n\nNegotiate specialized IP provisions whenever the customary deliverables or standard license rights do not adequately balance the interests of the contractor and the Government.\n\nSeek flexible and creative solutions to IP issues, focusing on acquiring only those deliverables and license rights necessary to accomplish the acquisition strategy.\n\n10. Does the receipt of confidential and proprietary information present problems for program managers and contracting officers during the acquisition process?\n\nYes, a contractor may disclose confidential business information, including trade secrets, to the Government in providing services and goods under an acquisition contract. A trade secret is a “formula, practice, process, design, instrument, pattern or compilation of information” not generally known, which may provide a company with a competitive advantage.\n\nIf the contractor marks information that it provides to the Government with restrictive markings or “proprietary,” disclosure by a government employee could result in a violation of 18 USC 1905, punishable by imprisonment, a fine and termination of employment."
