An invention-creation that is accomplished in the course of performing the duties of an employee, or mainly by using the material and technical conditions of an employer, is a service invention-creation. For a service invention-creation, the right to apply for a patent belongs to the employer. After such application is approved, the employer shall be the patentee. The employer may, in accordance with the law, dispose of the right to apply for a patent for its service invention-creation and the patent right, thereby facilitating the exploitation and utilization of the relevant invention-creation.\n\nFor a non-service invention-creation, the right to apply for a patent belongs to the inventor or designer.

After the publication of an invention patent application, the applicant may require the entity or individual exploiting the said invention to pay an appropriate amount of royalties.\n\nArticle 14. Where the co-owners of the right to file a patent application or of the patent right have reached an agreement on the exercise of the right, the agreement shall prevail. In the absence of such an agreement, any co-owner may independently exploit the patent or license another person to exploit the patent through a non-exclusive license; any royalty for the exploitation obtained from licensing others to exploit the patent shall be distributed among the co-owners.\n\nExcept for the circumstances as provided for in the preceding paragraph, the exercise of the co-owned right to file a patent application or the co-owned patent right shall be subject to the consent of all co-owners.\n\nArticle 15.

Where a dispute arises as a result of the exploitation of a patent without the authorization of the patentee, that is, the infringement of the patentee's patent right, it shall be resolved through consultation between the parties. Where the parties are unwilling to consult with each other or where the consultation fails, the patentee or any interested party may file a lawsuit in the people's court, or request the departments in charge of patent-related work to deal with the dispute.

If the infringer refuses to accept the order, he may, within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notification of the order, file a lawsuit in the people's court in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China. If the infringer neither files a lawsuit nor stops the infringing act at the expiration of the period of time, the department in charge of patent-related work may file an application with the people's court for compulsory execution. At the request of the party concerned, the department in charge of patent-related work dealing with the dispute may carry out mediation concerning the amount of compensation for the patent right infringement. If the mediation fails, the parties may file a lawsuit in the people's court in accordance with the Civil Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China.\n\nArticle 66.

In a patent infringement dispute, if the alleged infringer has evidence to prove that the technology or design exploited by it or him forms part of the prior art or prior design, such exploitation shall not constitute an infringement of the patent right.\n\nArticle 68. Where any person counterfeits a patent of another person, he shall, in addition to bearing his civil liabilities in accordance with law, be ordered by the department in charge of patent enforcement to make rectifications, and the department shall make the matter known to the public. His illegal earnings shall be confiscated and, in addition, he may be imposed on a fine of not more than five times his illegal earnings.

The patent administration department under the State Council may, at the request of the patentee or any interested party, deal with patent infringement disputes that have a major impact throughout the country.\n\nWhen dealing with patent infringement disputes at the request of the patentee or any interested party, the department in charge of patent-related work of the local people's government may deal with the cases of infringement of the same patent right within its administrative area in a combined manner; for cases infringing the same patent right across administrative areas, it may request the department in charge of patent-related work of the local people's government at a higher level to deal with the matter.\n\nArticle 71. The amount of compensation for patent right infringement shall be determined on the basis of the actual losses suffered by the right holder as a result of the infringement or the profits earned by the infringer as a result of the infringement. Where it is difficult to determine the losses suffered by the right holder or the profits earned by the infringer, the amount shall be reasonably determined by reference to the multiple of the amount of the royalties for the patent license.

Where the infringer refuses to provide the account books or materials, or provides false account books or materials, the people's court may determine the amount of compensation by reference to the right holder's claims and the evidence provided.\n\nArticle 72. Where the patentee or any interested party has evidence to prove that another person is infringing or is about to infringe its or his patent right or hinders the realization of the right, which, unless being stopped in time, may cause irreparable damage to his lawful rights and interests, it or he may, before filing a lawsuit, apply to the people's court for adopting measures for property preservation, ordering to do certain acts or to prohibit certain acts in accordance with the law.\n\nArticle 73.
