For students, it helps them to construct connections between old and new knowledge.\n\nWhy Assess Students’ Prior Knowledge?\n\nDetermining what students already know allows you to:\n\ntarget knowledge gaps and misconceptions\n\nbecome aware of the diversity of backgrounds in your classroom\n\ncreate a bridge between students’ previous knowledge and new material\n\nConsiderations for Assessing Prior Knowledge\n\nWhen using background knowledge assessments:\n\ndo not require students to put their name on the assessment\n\ncommunicate that the assessment is not graded\n\nuse technology: Canvas, Qualtrics, andclassroom response systems will quantify some of the data for you and provide graphs that you can then share with students\n\nshare the questions with colleagues or teaching assistants to confirm that the questions make sense\n\nGetting Started with Assessing Prior Knowledge\n\nPlan your background knowledge assessment by asking the following questions:\n\nWhat do you assume students already know?\n\nWhat kinds of questions will help you confirm your assumptions?\n\nWhat are some common misconceptions or myths related to your subject?\n\nHow are you going to analyze and respond to the data your pre-assessment provides?\n\nSome Strategies\n\nMake a list of 10-15 statements related to course content, including commonly held misconceptions. Have students mark \"true\" or \"false\" next to each statement.\n\nCanvas Quizzes and Qualtrics Surveys:\n\ncreate a series of multiple-choice questions\n\npost to Canvas as an assignment for the first class\n\ndo not grade the assignment, except perhaps to assign participation points\n\nPrepare two or three open-ended questions. Ask students to respond in two or three sentences to each question.\n\nGallery Walk:\n\nplace images, graphs, and excerpts from upcoming course content in the middle of a poster paper. This leaves room around the material for students to write\n\nhang images around the room\n\ncreate groups of two to four students\n\nplace one group in front of each poster. Give them five minutes to write observations, what they know or what they are wondering about the material"
