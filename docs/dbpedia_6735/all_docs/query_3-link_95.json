        "text": "How To Apply\n\nApply Online\n\nChoose to apply through one of our two applications – we do not have a preference which application you choose.\n\nPay the Fee\n\nA non-refundable application fee of $85 is required. If you think you may qualify for a fee waiver, view fee waiver eligibility requirements and learn how to submit documentation here.\n\nSelect a Major\n\nOn the application, you’ll be asked to select up to two majors based on your interests. We encourage you to select two different majors because if we determine you’re not competitive for your first-choice major, you’ll be reviewed for your second-choice major.\n\nStudents interested in a studio-based major (Architecture, Art + Design, Fashion and Textile Design, Graphic & Experience Design, Industrial Design) must apply by November 1 in addition to submitting a 10-piece portfolio and design essay.\n\nSelf-Report Your Test Scores\n\nAs a part of the UNC System, NC State will be test optional for applicants with a weighted GPA of 2.8 or above. A 2.8 weighted GPA is equivalent to a B- average.\n\nApplicants with a weighted GPA of 2.8 or above will not be required to submit standardized test scores as part of a complete application.\n\nOn the admission application, you will be required to indicate whether or not you plan to submit SAT or ACT scores for consideration in the admission review process. Applicants with a weighted GPA of 2.8 or above will not be disadvantaged if you indicate you do not want scores to be considered in your application review. Learn more about test score consideration in the review process here.\n\nIf you choose to submit your test scores, you should self-report them on your application. We encourage you to submit all scores, and we will consider your highest sub-score from each section across your test dates to create a super-score.\n\nWe can not guarantee scores received after the application materials deadline will be used in our review. See which test dates we accept for our application deadlines here.\n\nSAT Essay or ACT Writing scores are not required.\n\nAfter you have applied, any additional test scores can be added on your wolfPAW account. We will not accept standardized test scores listed on your high school transcript.\n\nIf you choose to enroll at NC State and opted for test scores to be considered during your application review, official SAT (code: 5496) or ACT (code: 3164) test scores will be required prior to enrollment.\n\nComplete the Essay Prompts\n\nYou’ll choose an essay prompt from the list provided by Common App or Coalition App so you can share your story with us in 650 words or less. We also have some additional short answer questions to help us get to know you better. These responses will be included in your application.\n\nRequired Short Answer Questions\n\nExplain why you selected the academic program(s) above and why you are interested in studying these at NC State.\n\nUniversity Honors Program\n\nIf you are interested in being considered for NC State’s University Honors Program, there is an additional question required with a response of no more than 600 words available on the admissions application or on your wolfPAW account after you apply. Learn more about admissions criteria for these programs here.\n\nSubmit Your Transcript\n\nTo complete your application, you must send an official high school transcript to our office. Your high school counselor can submit your transcript through Common App, Coalition App, slate.org or another secure sending service such as Naviance or Parchment. Students studying at participating public high schools in North Carolina can request official transcripts be sent to our office using CFNC.\n\nAfter You Apply\n\nCheck Your Email\n\nAfter you submit your application to NC State, you will receive an email with credentials to log in to wolfPAW, your applicant portal. Please note: it may take up to 24 hours after you submit your application for you to receive wolfPAW log in credentials. Here, you can check for missing items and stay up-to-date on the status of your application.\n\nWe encourage you to check your email often, as we may email you about additional items needed to complete your application. Using your school-assigned email address? Sometimes our emails may be blocked by the server, so we recommend using a non-school email to receive our communications.\n\nSubmit the FAFSA\n\nYou don’t need to wait for an official admission decision to submit your FAFSA, and we encourage students to apply as soon as possible.\n\nPriority filing date for NC State: March 1\n\nNC State school code: 002972\n\nView Your Decision\n\nYou will be notified of your admission decision on your wolfPAW account. If you completed your application on time and submitted all required materials by the deadline, you will receive a decision on the notification date corresponding to the application deadline for the semester you applied for.\n\nTypes of Decisions\n\nAdmit – Some students we are able to admit right away. Head to our admitted student page to learn about next steps for joining the Wolfpack family, a view the New Student Checklist here.\n\nDefer – When we review applications, we find some applicants who may benefit from the opportunity to provide improved fall grades before receiving a final decision in March.\n\nWaitlist – We are unable to admit all qualified students into our class. Some applicants are placed on the waitlist who we believe would be successful at NC State if space is available.\n\nDeny – Unfortunately, some students will not be considered competitive for first-year admission. We encourage denied applicants to consider applying to NC State in the future as a transfer applicant.\n\nPrepare to Apply\n\nMany factors go into choosing the right college for you. It’s never too early to start thinking about your future and creating a plan for success. We consider your academic record beginning with the ninth grade and encourage you to make the most of your time in high school by doing the following."
