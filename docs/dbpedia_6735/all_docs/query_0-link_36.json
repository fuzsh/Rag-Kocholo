Please contact us for details.\n\nRelease information\n\nVersion:\n\n7.2\n\nRelease Date:\n\nDecember 10, 2014\n\nCustomer Support:\n\nsupport.connectivity@peergroup.com\n\nWhat’s new in this release\n\nBridging data collection, storage and visualization\n\nEIB™ already combines data from numerous sources such as sensors, PLCs, equipment control software (ECS), and station controller applications leveraging its multi-protocol design to bring together equipment and process information into a single data server.\n\nWith EIB 7.2, data collection has been expanded enabling access to more information that EIB manages such as the connection status of various communication interfaces.\n\nEIB supports the ability to identify contextual data to associate and store with collected data giving you more insight into tool behavior. As an example, users can create solutions that capture and store alarms and events that occurred during specific recipe steps or job execution. Subsequently, data analysis applications can retrieve historical data, refined through the use of context data filters, to retrieve only data associated for specific recipes, wafers or processing job.\n\nHistorical back-end data processing and retrieval\n\nEIB makes it easy to leverage your equipment data through a simple mechanism that integrates data consumer applications each with their own data collection and data retention requirements. We have expanded EIB’s data management capabilities in this release to allow the integration of customer-defined algorithms for manipulating and reporting stored data. With this capability, specific applications can be developed that are tightly coupled with shared back-end processing eliminating the need for client-side data manipulations, reducing transmitted data volumes and improving overall performance.\n\nSimplifying custom parameter type integration\n\nEIB’s flexible data modelling allows user-defined parameter types to represent the equipment’s unique data requirements. Custom parameter types within the tool model are used to define the complex data structures that are typically required for reporting measurement data or other equipment-specific information to the factory host.\n\nTo support our continued effort to simplify tool model creation, Model Builder has been enhanced to generate C# code from custom parameter type definitions. The generated C# code can be copied and pasted directly into a .cs file for use with your custom application, eliminating the need to develop application code.\n\nConversely, if you have already generated a DLL with your required parameter types, the DLL can be loaded into Model Builder to automatically create the parameter type definitions within your tool model.\n\nMultiple override files\n\nAs equipment becomes more complex, the number of equipment items such as events, alarms, variables, and equipment constants continues to increase. Simplification of the tool model configuration process can help drive down development costs. In an effort to support re-use of tool models, a single tool model can now support multiple override files. This allows multiple tools with similar configurations to be built and maintained in a single tool model, with the differences encapsulated in a series of override files.\n\n“How To” documentation for adding 300mm support to your equipment\n\nAs part of our overall goal to reduce development effort, we have introduced high-level “How To” documentation to guide equipment makers when adding 300mm capabilities to their equipment in the ECS Interface API. Our approach focuses on required configuration to augment the provided samples, required APIs to integrate, as well as diagrams that show capabilities, flow of information, and responsibilities of the host and the equipment control system. For new EIB users, you will be able to quickly understand how to leverage EIB’s capabilities and add a 300mm host to your equipment.\n\nRelease information\n\nVersion:\n\n7.1\n\nRelease Date:\n\nJune 4, 2014\n\nCustomer Support:\n\nsupport.connectivity@peergroup.com\n\nWhat’s new in this release\n\nBridging data collection, storage and visualization\n\nEIB™ makes it easy to leverage your equipment data through a simple mechanism that integrates data consumer applications each with their own data collection and data retention requirements. We have expanded EIB’s data management capabilities in this release to allow the integration of custom data consumers into your solution, in addition to EIB’s existing SQL database data consumer for temporary data storage. With this capability, you can now employ additional storage architectures, including other database technologies, file-based storage systems, or custom storage solutions to capture data as it is collected from the equipment for real-time and historical data analysis and visualization. Besides storing data, custom data consumers also enable the integration of data analysis agents to process your data.\n\nAutomating the generation of equipment configuration\n\nOEMs manage their equipment capabilities in many forms, such as databases, source code, or configuration files to name a few. Using EIB’s Model Builder API, users can programmatically generate equipment models using their source information and keep it synchronized with the equipment control system, thereby eliminating manual configuration and costly user errors.\n\nProtecting intellectual property\n\nManufacturing process information and equipment data is important to safeguard. Access to this information needs to be protected, whether it is within the factory or shared between the manufacturer and the equipment maker. One source of information shared between fab and OEM is equipment communication logs, which are critical to help diagnose issues but can also contain sensitive information. EIB’s approach to viewing log information has been expanded in this release to allow both OEMs and fabs control over what information can be viewed and shared.\n\nHow to add GEM to your equipment\n\nAs part of our overall goal to reduce development effort, we have introduced high level “How To” documentation to guide equipment makers on how to add GEM capabilities to their equipment in the ECS Interface API. Our approach focuses on required configuration to augment the provided samples, required APIs to integrate, as well as diagrams to visually describe the capabilities and flow of information and responsibilities of the host and the equipment control system. For new EIB users, you will be able to quickly understand how to leverage EIB’s capabilities and add a GEM host to your equipment.\n\nTechnology support\n\nOur products continue to adopt new computing technologies, enabling our customers to take advantage of new computing platforms as they become available. This also includes dropping support for older technologies. EIB no longer supports Microsoft Windows XP operating system as well as development tools of Visual Studio 2003, 2005, and .NET Framework 2.0.\n\nRelease information\n\nVersion:\n\n7.0\n\nRelease Date:\n\nOctober 31, 2013\n\nCustomer Support:\n\nsupport.connectivity@peergroup.com\n\nWhat’s new in this release\n\nBridging data collection, storage and visualization\n\nAs wafer sizes increase, geometries decrease, and product lifecycles become shorter, data access and analysis is critical to quickly improve process design, manufacturing quality, and equipment performance.\n\nEIB™ easily combines data from numerous sources such as sensors, PLCs, equipment control software (ECS), and station controller applications leveraging its multiple-protocol design to bring together equipment and process information into a single data server.\n\nWith EIB 7.0, you can quickly create data collection plans and can extend your design to store the data as well. EIB’s data management infrastructure has many uses from:\n\nOn tool visual monitoring\n\nIntegration with 3rd party data analysis software\n\nOn tool data caching\n\nOff tool data caching\n\nStation controller tool or line visual monitoring\n\nEIB provides the framework for real-time data collection, storage, and historical analysis and can be integrated with 3rd party visualization data tools. EIB’s multi-client design facilitates tuning data collection, storage and visualization designs to individual client needs.\n\nFlexibility\n\nStandardization across the industry for host-equipment communications continues to be important to drive down integration costs, but it is also necessary for fabs and OEMs to continue to implement and adapt the standards as they make sense for their business and strategic objectives.\n\nEIB’s approach from day one has been to provide a flexible information bridge to communicate with any equipment type and any host. Flexibility is key to EIB’s architecture and we continue to expand our product to ensure that development and integration time is minimized regardless of the SEMI standard compliance level you are striving to meet.\n\nEIB 7.0 has made it simpler to integrate EIB on the host side with non-standard or partially compliant GEM and GEM 300 equipment. Station controllers can leverage the standards supported by the equipment and can quickly adapt to any non-standard messages, state model implementations, and event reporting, which enables rapid equipment integration.\n\nPerformance improvements\n\nAs equipment becomes more complex, the number of equipment items such as events, alarms, variables, and equipment constants continues to increase. Optimizations around model configuration time as well as equipment startup time provide you with valuable productivity gains, whether you are managing large models or using a central model management approach where instance specific capabilities are turned on or off at run time. Optimizing performance continues to be a key focus area for EIB, and in 7.0 the Model Builder load times have decreased by 64% and initialization times have decreased by 27%.\n\nPersisting key production data\n\nIt is critical that key manufacturing data is persisted across restarts of any equipment control application. The granularity of persistence control as well as the speed for data storage and retrieval is important to minimize any performance impact from persisting state. Both fabs and OEMs who use EIB may have their own storage technology in use for their application and want to minimize any processing overhead as well as installation footprint on their hardware.\n\nIn this release of EIB, the database repository options have been expanded giving our customers the ability to leverage their own database technology or newer database technology provided with EIB. EIB now supports persisting data in its SQL Server Express database, which has proven to have superior storage and retrieval times when compared to the previous storage technology. For customers that have their own SQL Server database used by their solution, they can choose to connect to their own database for data persistence instead of using the EIB provided database, thus reducing their hardware footprint.\n\nHost interface guide template\n\nA host interface guide clearly communicates the equipment capabilities to the factory reader so that the factory understands how to interact with the equipment and integrate it with their factory systems. A key part of the equipment communications is the capture of events, alarms, variables and constants supports by the equipment. This definition is handled automatically by EIB’s Host Interface Documentation export. In addition to these definitions, the host developer needs to understand operationally when data will be valid as well as error scenarios. A template document is provided in this release with annotations to help you select key host communications items to build your host interface guide.\n\nTechnology support\n\nOur products continue to adopt new computing technologies, enabling our customers to take advantage of new computing platforms as they become available. EIB now supports Windows Server 2012 operating system, and the development tools of Visual Studio 2012 and .NET Framework 4.5.\n\nInternationalization\n\nEIB has been qualified for English, Japanese, German, and French operating systems.\n\nRelease information\n\nVersion:\n\n6.4\n\nRelease Date:\n\nJune 27, 2012\n\nCustomer Support:\n\nsupport.connectivity@peergroup.com\n\nWhat’s new in this release\n\nThis release of EIB™ expands support for the 300mm SEMI standards (GEM 300) providing equipment side solutions additional control over host communications.
