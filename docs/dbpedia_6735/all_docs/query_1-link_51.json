Data can be viewed in two forms: institution profile (similar to College Navigator) and reported data (institution's response to each survey question).\n\nDownload, print, or customize an institution's Data Feedback Report, a report that graphically summarizes selected institutional data and compares the data with peer institutions.\n\nCustomize a summary table for a select subgroup of institutions on the following popular topics: tuition and fees, room and board, student financial aid, admissions, test scores, student enrollment, degrees/certificates awarded, and graduation rates.\n\nData are available starting with the 1980-81 collection year for the Custom Data Files function, which zip the data into comma separated value (*csv).\n\nDownload IPEDS data files for more than 7,000 institutions and up to 250 variables. Data files are provided in comma separated value (*.csv) format."
