Verification and validation should be repeated when changes are made to a component or system software previously discussed.\n\nAPPLICATION SOFTWARE: Software installed on a platform/hardware that provides specific functionality. Software or program that is specific to the solution of the application problem (GAMP5).\n\nARCHIVE: It is the process by which records are protected from the possibility of modification or deletion, and these records are stored under independent data control for the required retention period. Archived records must include, for example, associated metadata and electronic signatures.\n\nAUDIT TRAIL (data audit): The audit trail is a form of metadata that contains information about actions associated with the creation, modification or deletion of GxP records. A data audit provides a secure record of life cycle details such as creation, addition, deletion or modification of information in a log, paper or electronic, without hiding or overwriting the original record. A data audit facilitates the reconstruction of the history of such record-related events, regardless of medium, including the “who, what, when and why” of the action.\n\nAUDIT: Systematic, independent and documented process for obtaining audit evidence (records, factual statements or other information) and its objective evaluation to determine the extent to which audit criteria (set of policies, procedures or compliance process requirements used as reference) have been met.\n\nBACKUP: A security copy. It is a copy of one or more electronic files made as an alternative in case the original data or system is lost or becomes unusable (for example, in the event of a system failure).
