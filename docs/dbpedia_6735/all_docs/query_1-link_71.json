This cluster will break Climate Change into four parts. The first section will focus on the science of Green House Gases, GHGs, and their impact on the atmospheric energy balance. In the next section we will introduce the current research conducted at UC San Diego examining the role of aerosols on the energy balance and climate. These aerosols are influenced by the biology in the ocean and are subsequent chemical transformation in gas phase reactions which serve as the third section. The cluster will explore how global industrial human activity has impacted health, food security, and land utilization. We will also review how we might mitigate climate change through reduced utilization, alternate energy sources, carbon abatement and geoengineering.\n\nSample projects for this cluster include:\n\nGHG Climate change simulations\n\nThe Direct and Indirect effect of atmospheric aerosols\n\nThe other carbon Problem: Ocean Acidification\n\nAtmospheric VOCs and Secondary Organic Aerosols\n\nBending the Curve: How do we reach carbon neutrality?\n\nNuclear Energy and the Lithium Fluoride Thorium Reactor\n\nReplacing Petroleum: Biofuels and Bioplastics\n\n2023 Cluster 3 Newsletter\n\nCluster 4 - Structural Engineering: Building Better\n\nInstructors:\n\nLelli Van Den Einde, Teaching Professor, Department of Structural Engineering, UCSD\n\nPrerequisite:\n\nTwo years of Algebra or Integrated Math I & II (with Trigonometry component)\n\nDescription:\n\nIn Cluster 4, we like to build AND break things. We build small scale models of all types of structures (bridges, buildings, foundations, soils, underground pipes, aerospace structures, wind turbines, automobiles, human body, etc.) to see how we as engineers can put together different components to build strong structural systems. Every crack and every snap is exciting! We want to understand how and why it failed, discuss what it means, and consider different methods of improving the design to build it better! To further the understanding of building materials, the effects of natural forces such earthquakes, blasts and wind, and project planning and building, we will also do a number of hands-on laboratories. No matter what the structure is, we want to learn to build it better. We will introduce you to structural engineering and immerse you in the design and problem solving process. By the end of this cluster, students will be able to:\n\nDescribe the structural engineering major at UC San Diego and explain the role of a structural engineer.Design, build and test a structural component or system, analyze its performance, and evaluate and recommend a possible redesign from initial failures.

One recent aspect of this progress is the integration of photonics with electronics to produce high-speed Silicon photonics integrated circuits. Other advances in photonics includes the integration of artificial intelligence with computational optics and the development of optically assisted diagnostics or therapeutic medical devices. While the economic driver for the 20th century was electronics, the economic driver for the 21st century is photonics.\n\nIn this Cluster, we shall study the generation, manipulation, transmission, detection, and applications of light. Students will first conduct experiments with LED, laser, prism, lens, and spectrometers to study wave properties of light, such as polarization, diffraction, and interference, and also particle properties of light, such as photoelectric effect/solar cell. They will then work on “workshop” projects, including plastic lens, solar cells, etc. Afterward, they will work on final projects of their choice as a team, and present the results to the Cluster and their families before the virtual closing ceremony.\n\n2023 Cluster 5 Newsletter\n\nCluster 6 - Biodiesel from Renewable Sources\n\nInstructors:\n\nRobert S.

This is a laboratory intensive experience where the students will extract and purify oil (lipids) from biomass, convert the oil into Fatty Acid Methyl Esters, FAMEs, also known as biodiesel, wash and purify the biodiesel, and then analyze the quality of the finished product. They will use advanced instrumentation such as FTIR, GCMS, Chromatography, and Bomb Calorimetry to determine the quality of their fuel.\n\nSustainable energy engages scientists, entrepreneurs and consumers searching for a renewable form of energy that will also not place the Earth's ecosystem at greater risk. Biofuels can be generated from biomass. This biomass can range from terrestrial, agricultural, forestry and municipal wastes, energy crops like soybeans, rapeseed, switchgrass and algae. Biodiesel has gained attention in recent years as a renewable fuel source due to its reduced greenhouse gas and particulate emissions, and it can be produced within 10 states in the US. For projects students will create higher value materials from plant lipids to produce renewable and sustainable bioplastics which economically serve as a bridge to large scale biofuels production.\n\n2023 Cluster 6 Newsletter\n\nCluster 7 - R4US - Robots for Undersea Science (Formerly known as H4O: Hacking for Oceans)\n\nInstructors:\n\nJack Silberman Ph.D., Ph.D., Lecturer Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE), Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI), UCSD\n\nCo-Instructor pending\n\nPrerequisite:\n\nOpen to students finishing their junior year prior to the summer.

TE seeks to do so through the application of engineering and life sciences to develop biological substitutes, whereas RM targets therapies to induce regeneration of cells, tissues, and organs. TE-RM are exciting and interdisciplinary fields involving engineers, biologists, chemists, material scientists, and doctors. TE-RM are increasingly providing alternative treatments for medical conditions where traditional treatments such as drugs, medical devices, or transplants have limitations. TE-RM products are rapidly evolving from potent molecules and materials to induce regeneration, to isolated cells to reconstitute damaged tissue, culture-expanded cells to repair damaged knees, modified cells to combat cancer, and formed tissues for drug screening, for engineered skin to treat wounds and burns, and for replacement tissues and organs.\n\n2023 Cluster 8 Newsletter\n\nCluster 9 - Music and Technology\n\nInstructors:\n\nMichelle Lou, Assistant Professor, Department of Music, UCSD\n\nJoe Cantrell, Co-Instructor, Sound Artist & Musician\n\nPrerequisite:\n\nAn interest in the science of sound and the creation of sound art and music through both software and hardware tools.\n\nDescription:\n\nYou do not have to be a musician to have fun and learn how science and engineering can be used to create, compose, transform and perform sound and music.

Please mention these skills and your attitude on learning in your application.\n\nSwim waiver required if admitted to this Cluster.\n\nComputing Clusters Spectrum\n\nComputer Science Prerequisites\n\nDescription:\n\nIn this Cluster, we incorporate engineering theory and good practice in the development of scale autonomous cars. We start by using a realistic robotics simulator and an Artificial Intelligence framework (deep learning) on the student’s own computer (see minimal requirements). Then students will compete online using an external simulator server against other students in the Cluster, and with parents' permission, compete against competitors from around the world.\n\nWhile students learn how to use the AI framework in the simulator, small teams will be designing and building a physical scale robocar; mechanical and electrical fast prototyping will be taught. Teams will apply what they have done in the simulator to their scale autonomous car using GPU Accelerate Artificial Intelligence models.\n\nAfter the AI deep learning portion of the class, students continue to develop autonomy with their robots using traditional programming with\n\nPython and OpenCV.\n\nWe then move to outdoor navigation using Global Positioning System (GPS), and a final project includes smart cameras where AI is running in the camera vs. embedded computers (AI on the edge of the edge).\n\nThe Cluster consists of lectures and incrementally more challenging projects and training artificial intelligence models at UC San Diego’s Supercomputer Center, and building and testing the scale autonomous car.\n\nHere are a few links that will give students an idea of what to expect from this exciting Cluster!\n\n*Minimum Computer requirements:\n\n- No iPads or Chromebooks\n\n- A minimum of 8G bytes of RAM, ideally 16G +\n\n- A minimum of 300 G bytes of free disk space (remove all your movies from your hard drive ...)\n\n- Linux, MacOS, or Windows will work\n\n2023 Cluster 11 Newsletter\n\nNews Article: Undergraduate Engineers Get Hands-On Experience with Autonomous Vehicles\n\nVideo: Students Get Hands-on Experience with Autonomous Vehicles\n\nVideo: Introduction to Autonomous Vehicles\n\nVideo: 14Jun18 JSilbermanMOliveiraCRIWilliam\n\nCluster 12 - Machine Learning: Can We Teach a Computer to Think?\n\nInstructors:\n\nGerald Soosai Raj, Associate Teaching Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, UCSD\n\nRajeev Sahay, Assistant Teaching Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, UCSD\n\nPrerequisite:\n\nAlgebra II or Integrated Math II. This cluster is for students who have limited prior programming experience (i.e., have taken no programming classes or at most a single one; experience with Python is not required).\n\nComputing Clusters Spectrum\n\nComputer Science Prerequisites\n\nDescription:\n\nHave you ever wondered how Alexa or Siri learned to converse with us, or how ever-improving autopilot systems in self-driving cars are developed? The answer is “machine learning,” an explosively-growing field in the last few years. Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence and it allows us to train computers using the data we provide. For example if we provide a set of pictures of cats and things that are not cats, a machine learning algorithm can teach the computer to recognize cats. Therefore when the computer sees a new image later, it can tell whether it is a cat or not by itself. Machine learning has permeated our daily lives and is driving innovation in fields like medical diagnosis, face detection, recommendation systems for shopping sites, automatic language translation and climate study.\n\nIn this cluster, we will introduce you to the basics of machine learning, exploring applications from social science, engineering, habitat and animal conservation, and so on. The cluster will start with the basics of Python, the programming language we will use, and then will introduce some common machine learning packages. Lectures from the cluster faculty and guest speakers will help you grasp the basics of how different machine learning algorithms work. Projects throughout the curriculum will offer you more hands-on experience with various machine learning techniques. This cluster is designed for students who have limited exposure to programming, letting them further advance their programming skills while exploring the exciting world of machine learning. Students are highly encouraged to bring a PC laptop with them for this cluster. If students do not have a PC laptop available, one will be available to check out.\n\n2023 Cluster 12 Newsletter\n\nCluster 13 - Video Game Programming and Game AI Design\n\nInstructors:\n\nLeo Porter, Associate Teaching Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, UCSD\n\nGreg Miranda, Software Engineer, Lecturer, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, UCSD\n\nPrerequisite:\n\nAlgebra II or Integrated Math II. AP CS Principles or equivalent computer programming experience. Students should be comfortable with conditionals (if/else), loops (for/while), and arrays/lists.\n\nComputing Clusters Spectrum\n\nComputer Science Prerequisites\n\nDescription:\n\nNearly every person on the planet who has access to technology has played a video game. The result is a video game industry that earns hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue annually. In this vibrant area of the economy, how do you design video games that are appealing to players? Moreover, how do you design the Artificial Intelligence (AI) of the agents in the game, whether those be the Non-Player Characters in the world or the AI that competes against the human player? In this cluster, students will learn how to answer these questions while designing video games in Unity (C#). Although the games they build may vary based on student interest, they will likely build games like the story-driven classic Legend of Zelda, Tower Defense games, and Real-Time Strategy games. Each week, the students will create a new game with the final project bringing together the overarching concepts from the cluster.\n\n2023 Cluster 13 Newsletter"
