        "text": "Yes, Career Forward can be used for SkillBridge. There are two options for transitioning service members who would like to use SkillBridge for a Career Forward Fellowship:\n\nInternship-based SkillBridge\n\nThis is for transitioning service members who have completed a Google Career Certificate (GCC) through the Career Forward program. This opportunity provides hands-on experience in the civilian workforce and prepares candidates for a smooth transition into meaningful civilian careers. Because transitioning service members need to complete a GCC through Career Forward first, we recommend having 10-12 months of active-duty service left when beginning this option.\n\nSkill-based SkillBridge\n\nThis is referred to as the Career Forward Training Track. Through this option, transitioning service members earn a Google Career Certificate to learn new skills while also participating in professional development to assist with a smooth transition to the civilian sector.\n\nTimeline: Both SkillBridge options are 40 hours per week for 12 weeks and active-duty service members must be within 180 days of transitioning out of the military. Also, we recommend that you apply well in advance. Contact your transition office to begin the SkillBridge process as soon as possible.\n\nIn addition, HOH has other fellowship programs that can be used for SkillBridge. Please research which option is best for you. Keep in mind that transitioning service members are eligible for only one SkillBridge internship during their transition period due to guidelines from the Department of Defense.\n\nCorporate Fellowship Program (CFP)\n\nSalesforce Fellowship Program (SFP)\n\nMilitary Spouse Fellowship Program (MSFP)\n\nLearn more about SkillBridge/Career Skills, DOD Instruction 1322.29.\n\nIn addition to expert training and hands-on projects designed to prepare you for a job in your field of choice, you'll get access to a resume-building tool, mock interviews and career networking support through Hiring Our Heroes and Big Interview. These resources are designed to help you with your job search.\n\nCareer Forward participants will also have the opportunity to apply to the Career Forward Fellowship. In addition, Career Forward graduates can apply for these Hiring Our Heroesâ€™ fellowship opportunities:\n\nCorporate Fellowship Program (CFP)\n\nSalesforce Fellowship Program (SFP)\n\nMilitary Spouse Fellowship Program (MSFP)\n\nThese fellowships are a collection of best-in-class workforce development programs that place highly skilled and educated transitioning service members, military spouses, and veterans with employers committed to hiring them."
