        "text": "Manufacturers can place a CE (Conformité Européenne) mark on a medical device once it has passed a conformity assessment.\n\nThe conformity assessment usually involves an audit of the manufacturer's quality system and, depending on the type of device, a review of technical documentation from the manufacturer on the safety and performance of the device.\n\nEU Member States designate accredited notified bodies to conduct conformity assessments.\n\nFor certain high-risk devices, notified bodies must request an opinion from specific expert panels before issuing a CE certificate. These expert panels benefit from EMA's technical and scientific support.\n\nIn some cases, the notified body must seek a scientific opinion from EMA before issuing a CE certificate.\n\nEMA has different regulatory responsibilities for different categories of medical device, including in vitro diagnostics:\n\nTable 1: EMA regulatory responsibilities per medical device categoryMedical device categoryEMA responsibilityMedicines used in combination with a medical deviceEMA assesses safety and effectiveness of medicines used in combination with medical device within centralised procedure application for medicinal productMedical devices with an ancillary medicinal substance\n\nNotified body must seek EMA scientific opinion on quality, safety, and usefulness of ancillary medicinal substance if ancillary substance:\n\nIs derived from human blood or plasma\n\nHas been previously evaluated by EMA\n\nFalls in mandatory scope of centralised procedure\n\nCompanion diagnosticsNotified body must seek EMA scientific opinion on suitability of companion diagnostic to medicinal product if the latter falls in scope of centralised procedureMedical devices made of substances that are systemically absorbedNotified body must seek scientific opinion of a competent authority - EMA provides scientific opinion on compliance of substance with requirements in Annex I of Directive 2001/83/ECHigh-risk medical devicesEMA supports medical device expert panels that provide opinions and views to notified bodies on scientific assessment of certain high-risk medical devices and in vitro diagnostics\n\nMedical device legislation\n\nThe Regulations on Medical Devices (Regulation (EU) 2017/745) and on In Vitro Diagnostic Devices (Regulation (EU) 2017/746) changed the European legal framework for medical devices, introducing new responsibilities for EMA and national competent authorities in the assessment of certain categories of medical device.\n\nThe Medical Devices Regulation applies since 26 May 2021. Manufacturers must comply with the Regulation when placing new medical devices on the market. It repeals Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices and the Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices.\n\nThe In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Regulation applies since 26 May 2022. It repeals Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on in vitro diagnostic medical devices.\n\nQuestion-and-answer guidance on the implementation of these Regulations is available below.\n\nQuestions and answers on implementation of the medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices Regulations ((EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746)\n\nReference Number: EMA/37991/2019 Rev.4\n\nQuestions and answers on implementation of the medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices Regulations ((EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746) - tracked changes\n\nReference Number: EMA/37991/2019 Rev.4\n\nAccording to the current medical devices legislative framework, the EMA mainly provides scientific opinions to notified bodies through consultation procedures.\n\nEMA's regulatory role is limited to the assessment of certain categories of medical devices and in vitro diagnostics, and in the context of medicinal products used in combination with a medical device.\n\nEMA can only address questions under its remit.\n\nMedicinal products used in combination with a medical device\n\nSome medicines are used in combination with a medical device, usually to enable the delivery of the medicine.\n\nIf the principal intended action is achieved by the medicine, it is considered a medicinal product that includes a medical device.\n\nThe entire product is regulated under EU pharmaceutical legislation (Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004) and must obtain a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product.\n\nThe device part of the combination may require a conformity assessment, as follows:\n\nType of combinationIllustrationConformity assessment of deviceIntegral\n\nMedicinal product and device form a single integrated product\n\nExamples include:\n\npre-filled syringes and pens\n\npatches for transdermal drug delivery\n\npre-filled inhalers\n\nMarketing authorisation application should include a CE certificate for the device or, if not CE marked but would need to be certified if marketed separately, applicant must include an opinion from a notified body on conformity of device\n\nRequirement applies since 26 May 2021 under article 117 of Medical Devices Regulation\n\nRequirement does not apply to Class I devices (non-sterile, non-measuring)\n\nCo-packaged or obtained separately\n\nMedicinal product and device are separate items contained in same pack or obtained separately\n\nExamples include:\n\nreusable pen for insulin cartridges\n\ntablet delivery system with controller for pain management\n\nMust be CE marked in accordance with EU medical devices legislation\n\nRole of EMA\n\nEMA is responsible for evaluating the quality, safety and efficacy of marketing authorisation applications assessed through the centralised procedure, including the safety and performance of a medical device in relation to its use with a medicinal product.\n\nThe medical device may be co-packaged with, obtained separately from or integral to the medicinal product.\n\nEMA issued a final guideline on quality documentation for medicinal products that include a medical device in July 2021. This clarifies expectations laid down in Directive 2001/83/EC and addresses obligations in the Medical Devices Regulation, in particular under Article 117.\n\nEMA recommends reading the guideline in conjunction with the Q&A on the implementation of the Medical Device Regulation and In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Regulation.\n\nGuideline on quality documentation for medicinal products when used with a medical device - First version\n\nAdoptedReference Number: EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/259165/2019\n\nMedical devices with an ancillary medicinal substance\n\nA medical device may contain an ancillary medicinal substance to support the proper functioning of the device. These products fall under the medical devices legislation and must be CE marked.\n\nExamples of medical devices with an ancillary medicinal substance include:\n\ndrug-eluting stents;\n\nbone cement containing an antibiotic;\n\ncatheters coated with heparin or an antibiotic agent;\n\ncondoms coated with spermicides.\n\nRole of EMA\n\nBefore it can issue a CE certificate, the notified body must seek a scientific opinion from EMA on the quality and safety of the ancillary substance if it is derived from human blood or human plasma, or if it is within the scope of the centralised procedure for the authorisation of medicines.\n\nFor other substances, the notified body can seek the opinion from a national competent authority or from EMA e.g. in cases where EMA has already evaluated a medicine containing the same medicinal substance.\n\nEMA publishes consultation procedure public assessment reports (CPAR) on its scientific opinions.\n\nFor information on the consultation procedure to seek an EMA scientific opinion, see:\n\nAncillary medicinal substances in medical devices\n\nCompanion diagnostics ('in vitro diagnostics')\n\nA companion diagnostic is an in vitro diagnostic test that supports the safe and effective use of a specific medicinal product, by identifying patients that are suitable or unsuitable for treatment.\n\nThe In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/746) introduces a new classification system for companion diagnostics and the obligation to undergo a conformity assessment by a notified body.\n\nThe Regulation applies from 26 May 2022, following a five-year transition period.\n\nRole of EMA\n\nBefore it can issue a CE certificate, the notified body must seek a scientific opinion from EMA on the suitability of the companion diagnostic to the medicinal product concerned if:\n\nthe medicinal product falls exclusively within the scope of the centralised procedure for the authorisation of medicines, or\n\nthe medicinal product is already authorised through the centralised procedure, or\n\na marketing authorisation application for the medicinal product has been submitted through the centralised procedure.\n\nFor other substances, the notified body can seek the opinion from a national competent authority or EMA.\n\nA guidance document is available on the consultation procedure whereby notified bodies seek a scientific opinion from EMA. This is joined by a question-and-answer (Q&A) document on practical arrangements.\n\nThis guidance should help notified bodies, device manufacturers and medicinal product applicants understand the procedural aspects of the consultation process.\n\nThe FAQ document below provides an overview of EMA’s line of thinking on issues related to predictive biomarker-guided medicinal product development and assessment involving companion diagnostic (CDx).\n\nGuidance on the procedural aspects for the consultation to the European Medicines Agency by a notified body on companion diagnostics\n\nAdoptedReference Number: EMA/198592/2022\n\nQuestions & answers - Practical arrangements on the companion diagnostics consultation procedure to the European Medicines Agency by notified bodies\n\nReference Number: EMA/619893/2022\n\nFrequently asked questions on medicinal products development and assessment involving companion diagnostic (CDx)\n\nReference Number: EMA/CHMP/821321/2022\n\nNotified bodies should use the application forms below to request an initial or follow-up consultation.\n\nLetter of intent for the submission of a consultation to the European Medicines Agency by a notified body on a companion diagnostic in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/746\n\nReference Number: EMA/781233/2021\n\nApplication form for initial consultation by a notified body on a companion diagnostic\n\nApplication form for follow-up consultation procedure by a notified body on a companion diagnostic\n\nConsultation on companion diagnostic - Assessment report template\n\nSubmitted comments on 'Draft guidance on the procedural aspects for the consultation to the European Medicines Agency by a notified body on companion diagnostics'\n\nFor more information:\n\nFull list of procedural timetables\n\nMedical devices made of substances that are systemically absorbed\n\nSome medical devices are made of substances that are absorbed by the human body to achieve their intended purpose.\n\nThese devices are normally introduced into the human body via an orifice or applied to the skin.\n\nRole of EMA\n\nBefore it can issue a CE certificate, the notified body must seek a scientific opinion from EMA or a national competent authority on the compliance of the substance with the requirements laid down in Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC.\n\nEMA will provide further information on the consultation procedure between the notified body and a competent authority or EMA.\n\nBorderline products\n\nBorderline products are complex healthcare products for which there is uncertainty over which regulatory framework applies.\n\nCommon borderlines are between medicinal products, medical devices, cosmetics, biocidal products, herbal medicines and food supplements.\n\nNational competent authorities classify borderline products either as medicinal products or, for example, as medical devices on a case-by-case basis. This determines the applicable regulatory framework.\n\nApplicants who are unclear on the correct classification of their product should consult a national competent authority and provide information on the product's composition and constituents, a scientific explanation of the mode of action and its intended purpose.\n\nRole of EMA\n\nThe Medical Devices Regulation foresees that the European Commission may consult EMA on products that borderline with medicines.\n\nEMA's Innovation Task Force provides advice to medicine developers on eligibility to EMA procedures relating to the research and development of borderline products.\n\nHigh-risk medical devices\n\nFor certain high-risk devices, the Regulations on Medical Devices (Regulation (EU) 2017/745) and on In Vitro Diagnostic Devices (Regulation (EU) 2017/746) require notified bodies to consult expert panels before issuing a CE certificate.\n\nThese high-risk medical devices include:\n\nClass III implantable devices and class IIb active devices that are intended to administer or remove medicinal products from the body\n\nClass D in vitro diagnostic medical devices\n\nThe expert panels' opinions and views are currently available on the European Commission's website:\n\nEuropean Commission: List of opinions on class III implantable devices and class IIb devices under the CECP\n\nEuropean Commission: List of views on class D devices under the PECP\n\nIn line with the Regulation on Medical Devices, the expert panels have started to provide advice to the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG). This advice is currently available on the European Commission's website.\n\nThey are also foreseen to advise the European Commission, national competent authorities in EU Member States and notified bodies, if needed.\n\nThe implementation of these activities is gradual. EMA will provide further information for stakeholders when available.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\nEuropean Commission: Medical devices expert panels: Overview\n\nRole of EMA\n\nEMA provides administrative, technical and scientific support to the expert panels, in accordance with the Regulation on EMA's Reinforced Role (Regulation (EU) 2022/123). For more information, see Crisis preparedness and management.\n\nWorking instructions for Notified Bodies on the application of Article 54 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices and Article 48 of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices\n\nReference Number: EMA/416077/2023\n\nScientific advice pilot for high-risk medical devices\n\nEMA is running a pilot that enables the expert panels to provide scientific advice for manufacturers of high-risk medical devices.\n\nFor more information on the pilot, including related presentations and a letter of interest template that can serve as guidance for applicants, see:\n\nInformation session on the pilot for expert panels’ scientific advice to manufacturers of high-risk medical devices (25/01/2023)\n\nEMA pilots scientific advice for certain high-risk medical devices (27/02/2023)\n\nEMA invites EU-based manufacturers or their authorised representatives to apply for a third phase of the pilot by 30 June 2024. They can use the following application form:\n\nScientific advice pilot application form\n\nFor the third pilot phase, applicants can indicate if they would be willing to have an HTA body observe their project. In such cases, EMA will inform them whether this will be possible.\n\nApplicants can address any questions to the expert panel secretariat at eu-operations-expamed@ema.europa.eu.\n\nIn the first round, the expert panels selected six applications focused on fields such as circulatory system, orthopaedics, neurology and dentistry.\n\nEMA will publish further information on the pilot's progress, including its second round, in due course.\n\nAs the current pilot phase includes a limited number of scientific advice procedures, the expert panels prioritise applications that can cover varied medical areas and device types.\n\nExperts uphold three prioritisation criteria:\n\ndevices used by a relatively small group of patients to help diagnose or treat a disease or condition - for instance, so-called orphan devices and those for paediatric use;\n\ndevices that help address unmet medical needs - for example, devices for medical conditions that are life threatening or can cause permanent impairment, and for which the treatment currently available is insufficient or carrying significant risks for patients;\n\nnovel devices that can have a major clinical or health impact.\n\nApplications from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) receive special attention to ensure their representation in the pilot.\n\nAs per the Medical Devices Regulation (Article 61(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/745), scientific advice for medical devices refers to intended clinical development strategies and clinical investigation proposals. It covers:\n\nclass III medical devices;\n\nclass IIb active medical devices intended to administer or remove medicinal products from the body.\n\nExpert panels support for orphan medical devices: pilot programme\n\nEMA is inviting manufacturers of high-risk medical devices and notified bodies to apply for its pilot programme to support orphan medical devices. The pilot programme will provide free advice on a possible orphan device status and on the clinical evaluation of orphan medical devices.\n\nThis will help both new orphan medical devices and legacy medical devices, which are transitioning under rules of the Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR). Concretely, it will help bring new orphan medical devices onto the EU market while also keeping legacy medical devices on the EU market.\n\nThe pilot programme will run until the end of 2025, subject to available resources.\n\nIt is designed to establish a long-term process for requesting orphan device support from the expert panels.\n\nHow it works\n\nFor selected proposals from manufacturers, the expert panels will advise:\n\nregarding a possible orphan status of a device;\n\nand on the clinical development strategy and / or proposals for clinical investigation for the respective device.\n\nFor selected proposals from notified bodies, the expert panels will advise:\n\neither on a possible orphan status of a device;\n\nor on the data required for the clinical evaluation during an ongoing conformity assessment.\n\nNotified bodies will submit their advice request in cooperation with the orphan device manufacturer.\n\nThe request for advice depends on the stage of development of the device. It may include an opinion on:\n\norphan device status;\n\ndata sets required for the clinical evaluation as part of the conformity assessment;\n\nreview of the justification regarding the limited clinical data;​\n\nacceptability of clinical uncertainty and limitations in the data sets;\n\nacceptability of the proposed post-market clinical follow-up activities.\n\nThe pilot programme will prioritise certain groups of orphan medical devices:\n\nDevices for treating medical conditions that are life threatening or cause permanent impairment of a body function\n\nDevices intended for children\n\nNovel devices with a potential major clinical benefit\n\nHow to apply\n\nSubmit your application at any time via the dedicated portal linked below:\n\nLetter of interest for the pilot phase of scientific advice provided by the expert panels on certain high-risk medical devices\n\nIn your application, you should clearly elaborate on:\n\nspecific issues to be addressed concerning the orphan device status and / or the clinical data set needed for the pre-market clinical evaluation;\n\npost-market clinical follow-up activities to address the limitations in the pre-market clinical data.\n\nGuidance\n\nGuidance is available to help determine when a medical device or an accessory for a medical device should be regarded as ‘orphan’.\n\nThe guidance also provides a benchmark to manufacturers and notified bodies on the clinical evaluation of orphan devices which require clinical data evidence to demonstrate conformity with the MDR.\n\nThe Medical Devices Coordination Group (MDCG) published the guidance in June 2024:\n\nMedical Device Coordination Group: Clinical evaluation of orphan medical devices"
