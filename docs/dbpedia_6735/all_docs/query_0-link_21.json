        "text": "The Customer’s Problem\n\n*for confidentiality reasons, we do not name our customers in our case studies\n\nIn recent years, no industry has been spared supply chain disruptions. Our customer, a biotechnology company that designs and manufactures a unique scientific instrument, experienced a supply chain disruption to one of their products, which threatened shipment and field service delays.\n\nThis product is a complex, high-speed, and precise instrument that is widely used by the scientific R&D communities. We support its production by machining a part cut from a plastic material that could no longer be sourced. Not only is this plastic component critical to the completed product’s functionality, but as this component experiences normal wear and tear in the field, end users must also order this part to ensure the instrument’s day-to-day operational integrity.\n\nFrom design to final assembly, a significant amount of work goes into this product, but a supply chain disruption of a single plastic was enough to potentially derail its production, distribution, and sales.\n\nThe Hirsh Solution\n\nWhen Hirsh discovered the material shortage, we proactively sourced a suitable replacement material on our customer’s behalf, eliminating the need for them to divert their resources to resolve the issue themselves.\n\nOnce the replacement material was tested and approved by our customer, we completed a prototype run of parts with this new material to ensure the end-use component functioned properly.\n\nCustomer Benefits\n\nWithin three weeks, our team identified the replacement material, procured it for our customer’s in-house testing, and machined a prototype run with this new material without our customer having to put forth any of their own resources. Production and in-field servicing for this product resumed as normal.\n\nAdditionally, our customer had access to our extensive supplier network. Because we treat our suppliers like partners, we have very strong relationships that allow us to procure material quickly.\n\nWe also secured other benefits for our customer, including:\n\nResolve a common supply chain constraint\n\nSave our customer from using their own time and resources to solve this problem\n\nProcure an alternate material that our customer was not aware of prior to the shortage\n\nEnsure they experienced no downtime or decrease in sales\n\nConclusion\n\nHirsh Precision prides itself on being more than a precision machining company; our goal is to be a total manufacturing solution provider for our customers.\n\nContact our team to learn more about how we can craft a manufacturing solution to fit your needs."
