I believe technology will play a role to bend the arc of future food and agriculture systems to be more sustainable.\n\nIf this email was forwarded to you, you can subscribe and read past editions by clicking on Subscribe\n\nGreetings from Las Trampas Regional Park in the San Francisco Bay Area!\n\nParadigm Shifts\n\nDuPont was a chemical company for most of its existence, till they acquired Pioneer Seeds in the 1990s and then it has ultimately turned into an agrochemical giant Corteva with a chemical and seed portfolio. (report from 1999)\n\nMonsanto was a chemical company for most of its existence, till they got into biotechnology and then they became a seed company, and are now Bayer Crop Science with a chemical and seed portfolio.\n\nSeed and chemical businesses have a number of synergies. For example, seed companies can develop seeds that are resistant to certain pests and diseases, and chemical companies can develop pesticides and herbicides that are specifically designed for those seeds. This can lead to better crop yields and higher profits for farmers.\n\nThe combination of seed and chemical business was a paradigm shift in how inputs were sold, developed together, and purchased by farmers.\n\nParadigm shifts can present an opportunity to strengthen an incumbent's business (seed and chemicals being an example) or it can put incumbents at significant risks of losing a large chunk of their business.\n\nParadigm shifts often happen due to a technology shift, business model change, or regulatory changes.\n\nThere are many examples in business in the last few decades - GMO crops, SaaS models, mobile computing, cloud computing, iPhone etc.\n\nIf you are not a Game of Thrones fan, you can skip this paragraph, but the key takeaway of the paragraph is: paradigm shifts can put incumbents at significant risk.\n\nIn season 2, episode 7 of Game of Thrones, Tywin Lannister and Arya Stark talk about Harrenhal. (These are some of the best scenes from the series.)\n\nTywin says the Castle of Harrenhal was designed to hold out against a land army of a million men, but Aegon rode dragons and destroyed the impregnable castle by attacking it through the air.\n\nAegon shifted the paradigm of warfare, and made the incumbent castle useless.\n\nPotential paradigm shifts on the horizon (or maybe far out) in agriculture\n\nThere are a couple of future potential paradigm shifts in agriculture - if, how, and when they will happen is anybody’s guess.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nWill precision application of inputs like herbicides, pesticides, and nutrition inputs seriously jeopardize the business of input companies, though it might be great for farmers and the environment? (See edition 128, edition 130, etc.)\n\nWill the paradigm of “bigger is better” be jeopardized by an “Android” type of model for agriculture equipment, and be great for the environment? (See edition 132 (The Dominion of Incumbents), edition 89 (Android Strategy for Agriculture Equipment), and in many other editions)\n\nWill the advances in drone technology coupled with distribution jeopardize the business of agriculture equipment companies? (See edition 137 etc.)\n\nLet us look at the last one in a bit more detail\n\nOn the ground or through the air?\n\nTraditionally within agriculture, ground based equipment has been used (where it is available, applicable, and affordable), for most farm activities in row crops like tillage, planting/seeding, nutrition and crop protection applications, harvesting etc.\n\nThe situation is a bit different in specialty crops, where many of the activities are done by humans. In many smallholder context, equipment is not available or affordable.\n\nThere is a need to advance precision agriculture, human augmentation, and automation in all cropping systems to address high input costs, challenges with availability of labor, and sustainability and regulatory challenges.\n\nThere are some new technologies which are becoming more viable over the last few years, which could potentially change the paradigm of doing most farming operations using ground based equipment.\n\nThis is especially true in the realm of precision agriculture.\n\nIn the seminal book, “Thinking in Systems - A Primer”, Donella H Meadows talks about how one can create change in systems. (This book should be required reading for everyone).\n\nShe describes 12 leverage points, and places to intervene in a system in order of effectiveness. Number 2 on her list is paradigm changes.\n\nParadigms are the sources of systems. From them, from shared social agreements about the nature of reality, come system goals and information flows, feedbacks, stocks, flows, and everything else about systems.\n\nIf you are a ground based equipment manufacturer (an OEM), one way to think about the different technologies which are available today, and which are on the horizon is to understand the applicability of these technologies across different cropping systems and operations.\n\nThe table below shows an example of one such representation. The table is not supposed to be comprehensive, and the company names I have mentioned in the table are the ones I know of.\n\nThere are many other dimensions to this table like region of the world, practices in different cropping systems, economic environment, farmer dynamics, regulation etc., but only two dimensions can be shown in a flat table.\n\nThe question for an existing incumbent is as to which squares on this chart they should play in to get the right share of their customer’s investment on these applications and the necessary equipment needed to support those activities.\n\nFor startups, it is better to start by focusing on just one square (actually a very small part of a given square), find product market fit, expand within the same square, before moving on to another square.\n\nWhat should incumbents do?\n\nIncumbents have to tackle similar questions. Incumbents have more tools at their disposal to play in different squares.\n\nIncumbents could do M&A transactions (for e.g. Deere acquiring Blueriver), joint ventures (for e.g., AGCO and Trimble joint venture), investments through their corporate VC arms (for e.g. Leaps by Bayer investment in Rantizo or Syngenta Ventures investment in Greeneye), establish close relationships through accelerator programs (Deere with Burro), or use some other tools.\n\nThe level of investment in terms of time, resources, and money is different in each of these tools, but it gives a closer look inside a square to an entity like Deere.\n\nIf we take the example of Deere, and highlight the squares where they are playing in through one of the above mentioned tools, the chart looks something like this.\n\nAs you can see from the chart, Deere is making investments in many squares across different cropping systems (row, specialty, tree), and different technology form factors (new equipment, retrofit, or new robots).\n\nDeere does operate in the smallholder space, but my understanding is that their involvement is limited.\n\nAs can be seen from the chart, Deere does not participate in irrigation capabilities (it does have some software and mapping products), or any aerial applications in any significant way.\n\nDeere also does not seem to have used any tools at its disposal in the specialty retrofit market outside of permanent tree crops through their acquisition of SmartApply.\n\nIt is interesting to see that ground based technology providers do not cross over to aerial technology and vice versa.\n\nIt is not surprising, given the skills, resources, and experience required to build ground based moving equipment is different from a pivot or irrigation system which is stationary, and is very different from building aerial technology with planes and drones.\n\nBut how should a Deere (or another large OEM) react, if the drone based application services become competitive with ground based services in terms of the economics, and the effectiveness of the technology?\n\nJobs-to-be-done\n\nIf we look at it from a jobs-to-be-done framework, as a grower I want to have crop protection in an economical and timely fashion throughout the year.\n\nYes, there are farmers who like to ride their equipment. But most farmers want effective crop protection, and want to use any and all applicable tools at their disposal (it has to be economical, easy, and effective though).\n\nAs my friend Shane Thomas covered in his writeup about Rantizo’s recent fundraise, ground based rigs have many shortcomings.\n\nHowever, there are shortcomings of ground rigs— they include:\n\nExpensive to purchase and operate\n\nCause crop trample and soil compaction\n\nLarge leading to challenges in tighter or smaller field areas (eg: around power lines or terraced land)\n\nLose efficiency for spot spray applications (eg: nutrient deficiency management)\n\nCannot be used when soil is too wet\n\nI will add one more to the list.\n\nGround rigs are difficult to transport and expensive to transport, whereas a swarm of drones could be folded up and loaded onto a semi and be moved to a different spot.\n\nDrones are a very small percentage of the overall application business, and there are still some roadblocks to adoption.\n\nDistribution network\n\nCoverage & efficiency of drone applications\n\nRegulations which restrict usage of drones beyond a certain minimum set of requirements.\n\nTrained drone operators\n\nTechnology and support infrastructure and tools\n\nCharging infrastructure\n\nSafety issues\n\nIf some of these roadblocks are knocked down, it could potentially create an orthogonal distribution and service network, compared to the existing ground based equipment distribution and service network.\n\nToday’s ground based sprayers provide high efficiency and capacity, but cannot operate in fields during certain conditions. For example,\n\nThe wet weather during months of May and June across much of the southeastern US also made most fields inaccessible with ground application equipment, hence limiting the timely pesticide applications for most growers.\n\nWith improvements in battery life, changes in regulations, and building of a service/orchestration network (as highlighted by Shane), drone based applications could start taking away some activities from ground based rigs.\n\nDrones can be a good option (assuming economic & operational viability, and effectiveness) in certain challenging conditions as described above.\n\nToday ground based equipment manufacturers provide products which work under certain conditions of region, crop type, time of year, environmental conditions etc.\n\nA service provider or a retailer can fill in the gaps as needed, if it makes sense.\n\nFor example, an Ag Retailer can provide spraying services to a farmer using a ground based sprayer. If a drone is required to spray due to certain conditions, a drone service provider or a retailer can fill the gap for the grower from a jobs-to-be-done framework standpoint.\n\nEven if many of the technology, regulatory, and operational challenges are solved, incumbents have such a stranglehold on distribution, it is extremely challenging for a startup to try to go around it, unless you are taking a different approach.\n\nI have quoted Alex Rampell (VC at a16z) many times in this newsletter before,\n\nThe battle between every startup and incumbent comes down to whether the startup gets distribution before the incumbent gets innovation.\n\nSo is it even possible for a startup to get to distribution before an incumbent gets to innovation?\n\nIt is very much possible, if the incumbent thinks that a particular innovation is not a square they want to play in. (Refer to the chart by me before)\n\nWhich square do you want to play in?\n\nAs we have seen so far, OEM incumbents do not want to play in the drone or aerial application business. (so far). Can these new age start ups try to spin up their own distribution network?\n\nFor example, most of the new management team at Rantizo came from Skyward, a drone management company owned by Verizon (which was surprisingly shutdown last year). (Highlights by me)\n\n​The company’s drone software platform helped customers manage their entire drone workflow, including training crews, planning missions, accessing controlled airspace and more.\n\nSince opening the new business unit, Verizon seems to have pivoted more and more towards AMRs. “The Verizon Robotics Group enables\n\nenterprise customers to efficiently adopt and scale Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) to improve productivity, deliver faster time to insight, and reduce costs through automation and 5G.\n\n​The video above highlights 5G connectivity (given it is a Verizon ad), but the general principles will hold for agriculture with the use of AMRs (technical term for drones, though they are not fully autonomous yet.)\n\nSome of these drone companies are playing in squares, which existing incumbents have shown no inclination to do so, and are trying to ramp up an orthogonal support and distribution network.\n\nJust like we saw with seed & chemical business, will ground-based agriculture equipment manufacturers acquire drone companies and service providers?\n\nAre the new age drone companies targets for incumbents, or if some of the distribution etc. challenges are solved, will they become competitors to OEMs?\n\nIs the future already here?\n\nBut how can paradigms change or shift to create a different future?\n\nThomas Kuhn, who wrote the fantastic book about the great paradigm shifts in science, “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions” said the following about changing paradigms.\n\nYou keep pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm. You keep speaking and acting, loudly and with assurance, from the new one. You insert people with the new paradigm in places of public visibility and power. You don’t waste time with reactionaries; rather, you work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded.\n\nIf one thinks about the drone business, as the great science fiction author William Gibson said,\n\nThe future is already here - it is just not evenly distributed.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nIf you like “Software is feeding the world”, please share with a friend.\n\nIf you don’t mind answering 3 questions anonymously (2 are optional), I would love to get your feedback.\n\nThe views expressed in this newsletter are my personal opinions.\n\nThis newsletter is a product of Metal Dog Studios.\n\n​Unsubscribe | Update your profile | Metal Dog Studios, Dublin, CA 94568"
