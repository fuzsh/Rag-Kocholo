        "text": "Gagné's Nine Events of Instruction\n\nIn 1965, Robert Gagné proposed a series of events that are associated with and address the mental conditions for learning. Each of the nine events of instruction is highlighted below, followed by sample methods to help implement the events in your own instruction. Use Gagné’s nine events in conjunction with Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy to design engaging and meaningful instruction. The following steps have been adapted from Gagné, Briggs, and Wager (1992).\n\n1. Gain attention of the students\n\nEnsure the learners are ready to learn and participate in activities by presenting a stimulus to capture their attention.\n\nThese are a few methods for capturing learners’ attention:\n\nStimulate students with novelty, uncertainty, and surprise\n\nPose thought-provoking questions to students\n\nHave students pose questions to be answered by other students\n\nLead an ice breaker activity\n\n2. Inform students of the objectives\n\nInform students of the objectives or outcomes for the course and individual lessons to help them understand what they are expected to learn and do. Provide objectives before instruction begins.\n\nHere are some methods for stating the outcomes:\n\nDescribe required performance\n\nDescribe criteria for standard performance\n\nHave learners establish criteria for standard performance\n\nInclude course objectives on assessment prompts\n\n3. Stimulate recall of prior learning\n\nHelp students make sense of new information by relating it to something they already know or something they have already experienced.\n\nThere are numerous methods for stimulating recall:\n\nAsk questions about previous experiences\n\nAsk students about their understanding of previous concepts\n\nRelate previous course information to the current topic\n\nHave students incorporate prior learning into current activities\n\n4. Present the content\n\nUse strategies to present and cue lesson content to provide more effective instruction. Organize and group content in meaningful ways, and provide explanations after demonstrations.\n\nThe following are ways to present and cue lesson content:\n\nPresent multiple versions of the same content (e.g. video, demonstration, lecture, podcast, group work, etc.)\n\nUse a variety of media to engage students in learning\n\nIncorporate active learning strategies to keep students involved\n\nProvide access to content on Blackboard so students can access it outside of class\n\n5. Provide learning guidance\n\nAdvise students of strategies to aid them in learning content and of resources available. In other words, help students learn how to learn.\n\nThe following are examples of methods for providing learning guidance:\n\nProvide instructional support as needed – i.e. scaffolding that can be removed slowly as the student learns and masters the task or content\n\nModel varied learning strategies – e.g. mnemonics, concept mapping, role playing, visualizing\n\nUse examples and non-examples – examples help students see what to do, while non-examples help students see what not to do\n\nProvide case studies, visual images, analogies, and metaphors – Case studies provide real world application, visual images assist in making visual associations, and analogies and metaphors use familiar content to help students connect with new concepts\n\n7. Provide feedback\n\nProvide timely feedback of students’ performance to assess and facilitate learning and to allow students to identify gaps in understanding before it is too late.\n\nThe following are some types of feedback you may provide to students:\n\nConfirmatory feedback informs the student that they did what they were supposed to do. This type of feedback does not tell the student what she needs to improve, but it encourages the learner.\n\nEvaluative feedback apprises the student of the accuracy of their performance or response but does not provide guidance on how to progress.\n\nRemedial feedback directs students to find the correct answer but does not provide the correct answer.\n\nDescriptive or analytic feedback provides the student with suggestions, directives, and information to help them improve their performance.\n\nPeer-evaluation and self-evaluation help learners identify learning gaps and performance shortcomings in their own and peers’ work.\n\nSummary\n\nGagné’s nine events of instruction can help you build a framework to prepare and deliver instructional content while considering and addressing conditions for learning. Ideally, you should prepare course goals and learning objectives before implementing the nine events—the goals and objectives will help situate the events in their proper context. The nine events of instruction can then be modified to fit both the content and students’ level of knowledge.\n\nReferences\n\nGagné, R. M., Briggs, L. J., & Wager, W. W. (1992).
