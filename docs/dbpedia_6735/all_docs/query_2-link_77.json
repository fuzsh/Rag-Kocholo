        "text": "Targets may be formulated in terms of total sales volumes, as sales shares, or as an ambition to transition all sales of the company or of a certain brand to all-electric. As shown in Prospects for electric vehicle deployment, these targets often exceed not only regulatory requirements (as reflected in the Stated Policies Scenario), but also government ambitions (as reflected in the Announced Pledges Scenario).\n\nHowever, manufacturers’ targets are non-binding and still often focus only on leading EV markets. Indeed, it is probably no coincidence that the most ambitious targets are for the European market, where the newly amended CO2 emission standards would mean that all new cars and vans will be zero-emission by 2035. Major new OEM announcements have been made at the global level and regionally in 2022-2023. Several Chinese OEMs recently announced EV targets; in contrast with OEMs based in the rest of the world, Chinese car manufacturers’ targets are generally shorter-term and tend to be well within reach of current NEV market shares.\n\nIn addition, automakers continue to invest increasing sums in electrification and digital technologies. Just seven automakers, which were collectively responsible for nearly half of LDV sales in 2022, have capital expenditures of more than USD 55 billion on emerging automotive technologies since 2019, including for manufacturing facilities.\n\nGlobal spending on electric cars was up 50% in 2022 relative to 2021, reaching about USD 425 billion. Most of this was directly spent by consumers when buying a vehicle, while governments spent around USD 40 billion through direct purchase incentives. These include subsidies and tax deductions such as VAT exemption, and bonuses related to weight, CO2 emissions or range. The increase in global spending on electric cars means that carmakers – including incumbents – are generating more revenues from EV sales, and particularly from SUVs and large car models, thereby progressively helping to reduce reliance on ICE sales to finance EV manufacturing, R&D and new model development. While there is still a long way to go, this is an important step for EV growth and the transition to fully electrified road transport.\n\nOver the 2017-2022 period, the share of government spending in total spending decreased from over 20% to just under 10%. On a per-vehicle basis, government spending decreased from around USD 9 000 per electric car in 2017 to USD 4 000 in 2022, as sales increased more quickly than government spending. In 2023 and beyond, governments in major EV markets are gradually phasing out subsidies for electric cars, suggesting government spending will decrease in those markets. However, incentives in markets where adoption has been lower to date, including in EMDEs such as India, Indonesia and Thailand, could push overall government spending up.\n\nIn both China and Europe, government spending has increased significantly since 2017, especially in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. In China, government spending dipped in 2019-2020 but caught up quickly afterwards: it doubled between 2020 and 2021, and increased by nearly 70% in 2022 relative to 2021, exceeding USD 22 billion. In Europe, government spending boomed in 2020 and continued increasing through 2021 (up 50% year-on-year) and 2022 (up 20%), totalling more than USD 15 billion in 2022. In China, purchase incentives, which are based on driving range, have been decreasing. Although the average range of electric cars sold in China has been increasing, and accordingly more models have become eligible for subsidies, per-unit government support has been steadily decreasing, standing at around USD 4 000 in 2022. The majority of public support for electric cars comes from the vehicle purchase tax exemption rather than the subsidy. In Europe, per-unit support by governments has remained steady at around USD 6 000 over the 2017-2022 period, but could drop in 2023 and future years as subsidies decrease in major markets such as Germany, the United Kingdom and France.\n\nMeanwhile, federal government spending in the United States has remained much lower than that in other major markets in the past few years, especially as major carmakers – mostly Tesla and General Motors – reached the cap on further subsidies. However, it increased from below USD 1 billion in 2020 to almost USD 2.5 billion in 2022 as more electric cars that are eligible to subsidies were sold than in previous years. While aggregate public support increased significantly, the IRA changed eligibility requirements for sales taking place between mid-August and end-2022. The IRA aims to promote EV manufacturing in North America, and as such the list of vehicles qualifying for subsidies shrank in the second half of 2022. Furthermore, while carmaker caps have been removed in 2023, they remained in place throughout 2022. As a result, public spending on a per-unit basis dropped from more than USD 3 000 in 2021 to USD 2 500 in 2022. The trend could be reversed in 2023 and beyond as the list of qualifying vehicles grows.\n\nIncreasing competition in EV markets is also influencing investor confidence and financial performance. Incumbent carmakers are diversifying their fleets in order to comply with strengthened policies, such as CO2 standards, or to reach new consumers, yet are struggling to catch up with EV companies. New market entrants – especially from China – that aim to capture a share of booming EV markets are also increasing pressure on incumbent carmakers. Carmakers that do not have sufficiently attractive electric car offerings are likely to face issues in the growing EV market in the near future.\n\nIn 2022, the world’s largest carmakers in terms of ICE car sales (Volkswagen, General Motors, Toyota, Stellantis, Honda, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, Ford, Hyundai-Kia, Geely, Mercedes-Benz and BMW) accounted for 40% of global electric car sales. In 2015, the same companies accounted for 55%. Over the same period, the combined market share of just two companies, Tesla and BYD, increased from 20% to over 30%. In 2015, Chinese carmakers accounted for 35% of global EV sales, and this share increased to 45% in 2022, led by BYD (18%), Geely (6%), and a number of other firms including SAIC, Chery, Changan, Dongfeng, Hozon, CHJ, Great Wall, NIO, Xiaopeng and Leap. Geely, for example, saw revenue increase by nearly 50% in 2022 relative to 2021, and net income by 10%, with expectations of a 15% growth in electric car sales in 2023. Incumbent Chinese carmakers are also adapting their strategies, such as Great Wall Motor, which in March 2023 announced a new strategy focusing on EVs, after sales dropped in 2022 by nearly 20% relative to 2021.\n\nAs battery demand continues to increase, battery makers are seeing strong financial stock performance, outperforming that of EV makers in 2022, in spite of supply chain disruptions and critical mineral price volatility. Their market capitalisation has also been steadily increasing since 2020, suggesting strong investor confidence in future returns and growth. In 2022, CATL, which accounts for nearly 40% of the world’s market for EV cells, far ahead of LG Energy and BYD, saw net income nearly double relative to 2021 as EV sales increased. Financial analysts suggest that the market for lithium-ion batteries could boom from USD 90 billion in 2022 to USD 250 billion in 2030.\n\nHowever, growth in market capitalisation was slower and financial performance not as high in 2022 as it was over 2020-2021. The gross profit margin of major battery makers has been steadily decreasing from more than 30% in 2015 to about 20% in 2022. This is due not only to increasing competition in the market, but also to higher raw material and commodity prices (e.g. for lithium, cobalt and nickel), which tend to boost the profits of firms involved in extraction while putting pressure on the firms purchasing the materials for refining and to manufacture products such as batteries.\n\nAs carmakers compete to secure battery supplies, they are increasing investments for in-house battery production for increased vertical integration. For example, Tesla is increasing its focus on battery manufacturing, and introducing innovative concepts expected to cut costs. Toyota, GM, Hyundai and Ford are investing USD 2.5 billion, USD 6.6 billion, USD 5.5 billion and USD 11.4 billion respectively in EV and battery manufacturing sites in the United States alone. To secure supply of critical minerals needed for batteries, carmakers are also partnering with mining companies or even directly investing in mining operations. Ford partnered with Vale and Huayou to build a processing plant in Indonesia with capacity to process 120 kt of nickel per year; Stellantis invested EUR 50 million (USD 55 million) in the German lithium producer Vulcan, and Tesla signed agreements with mining companies such as Albemarle, for lithium, and Prony Resources, for nickel.\n\nThe past two years have been very profitable for the mining industry. The revenues of the top 40 mining companies increased by 30% between 2020 and 2021, and their net profit by 130%. In the context of the energy transition, critical mineral demand is of particular interest for the mining sector. In 2021, the combined value of critical minerals used for clean technologies was around USD 75 billion. Assuming prices stay constant, by 2050, the needs of the energy transition could increase this value fivefold in the Net Zero by 2050 Scenario. This prospect makes the critical mineral sector especially attractive for investors. Indeed, the market capitalisation of lithium, copper and nickel mining companies grew by 350%, 90% and 85% respectively between 2016 and 2022, compared with 20% for coal producers and 75% for the top 100 mining companies over the same period. This reflects increasing appetite for critical metal mining and confidence in future returns. There are also new entrants in this sector, just as in other steps of the EV supply chain. In March 2023, Lithium Royalty Corp., a Canadian company established in 2018, raised USD 109 million in the biggest initial public offering (IPO) in the country since May 2022.\n\nCompetition is pushing some mining companies to also seek vertical integration: downstream in mineral processing for miners, and upstream in mining for refiners. Albemarle and Covalent Lithium, for example, are building processing sites in Australia to turn the spodumene they extract into lithium hydroxide. In total, lithium processing projects have received USD 5 billion in Western Australia alone over the past three years. As a result of mining companies expanding operations downstream, refiners are under pressure, with profit margins shrinking, especially in China where there is historic reliance on Australian spodumene. As a result, some refiners are moving upstream as a means to secure raw materials, but lead times to develop new mines can be long.\n\nLooking to the future, vertical integration on both sides of EV supply chains – from miners downstream and from carmakers upstream – could help decrease manufacturing costs and prices for consumers accordingly, but could also lead to greater market concentration.\n\nMeanwhile, early-stage electric car manufacturers are raising less and less money as EV markets mature. Start-ups developing new electric cars were the first beneficiaries of booming EV VC in around 2015, but less and less capital is provided to new entrants as competition increases and major incumbents accelerate electrification. The 2015-2020 period also saw major VC activity in China, but this has now declined as the market consolidates around frontrunners – many of which were start-ups less than a decade ago.\n\nEarly-stage investors are instead looking for new investment opportunities in the value chain, either upstream (such as batteries or critical minerals) or downstream (such as charging or recycling). Companies developing lithium-ion batteries still dominate, accounting for 60% of early-stage VC investments in the battery segment over 2018-2022, but new chemistries are on the rise, both lithium- and non-lithium-based. Critical minerals VC is also booming as metal demand surges, standing at around USD 650 million in 2022 from close to zero in 2018-2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nOne notable development in 2022 was the drop in growth-stage investments (i.e. series B and growth equity, which refers to the later rounds of financing as start-ups increase activity). These fell by 25% relative to 2021 both for batteries, to USD 6.1 billion, and for vehicles and charging, to USD 7.4 billion, due to lower investments in battery and truck manufacturers. Putting things into perspective, 2021 was an exceptional year for batteries, as investments caught up following the Covid-19 pandemic; and 2022 was still twice as high as ever before. As such, the downward trend in 2022 might not be of immediate concern. For trucks, the 2019-2021 period was a fruitful one in growth equity VC markets, but investor appetite may be drying up following concerns over the performance of leading companies.\n\nOver the 2018-2022 period, China accounted for 70% of VC investments in electric car start-ups, while the United States led in investments in charging, trucks and battery components. Funding for battery making start-ups was evenly distributed across China, Europe and the United States. India had a strong lead in two-wheelers, the only EMDE beyond China with a significant presence in global EV VC.\n\nOver the past five years, the share of global electric car exports coming from China has increased more than eightfold, with China becoming the largest exporter in 2021 and the gap further widening in 2022. The share of electric car exports from the United States peaked in 2019 and has since fallen below the levels exported from China, Korea and Europe. While the number of electric cars traded globally has continued to increase over time, the share of exports out of total electric car sales has decreased over the past four years.\n\nThe transition to electric mobility is shifting and will continue to shift trade balances. Historically, Europe has been a net exporter of ICE cars (by value), while China has been a net importer. However, with the transition to electric cars, the size of the ICE car market is expected to shrink over time, while the EV market grows. China, Japan and Korea are all net exporters of electric cars, electric motors and Li-ion batteries, and are well positioned to benefit from a growing electric car market. Nonetheless, these battery-exporting countries are also strongly dependent on the import of critical minerals, such as lithium, cobalt and nickel."
