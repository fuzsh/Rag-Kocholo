        "text": "Altair's digital twin solutions use simulation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to create virtual representations of physical assets. This technology optimizes vehicle performance, reduces costs, and speeds up time-to-market. Real-time monitoring and analysis of vehicle data helps automakers identify and fix issues before they occur, improving reliability and reducing downtime. Altair's digital twin solutions reduce the need for physical testing, enabling automakers to simulate and test new designs and performance scenarios.\n\nThe best simulation tools won’t deliver what you need unless they’re supported by the right solutions to keep your high-performance computing infrastructure running optimally. Altair computing solutions give automotive designers and manufacturers faster times-to-market and superior product quality with a comprehensive set of workload management and optimization tools for clusters, supercomputers, and cloud.\n\nAltair's expertise in product development and data analytics enables clients to streamline the design process and reduce time to market. Our automotive software solutions, such as Altair® Inspire™ and Altair® HyperMesh®, provide engineers with tools to optimize product design, increase collaboration, and reduce physical prototyping. With our solutions, automakers can quickly and efficiently design and develop high-quality products.\n\nEnsuring safe, efficient inverter-motor interactions is a crucial challenge in electric vehicle design. Altair provides an approach to develop exceptional power density systems while identifying EMI/EMC compatibility issues early. Complementary solutions ensure high-energy battery packs immune to thermal runaway, help reengineer vehicle structures for the load of the battery, and protect vehicle occupants and the battery during crashes by simulating crash scenarios.\n\nEngineers must create efficient, reliable, and high-performing transmissions all while minimizing road vibrations to ensure smooth vehicle operation and mitigate cabin sound. Altair provides advanced capabilities for modeling and simulating multi-body gearbox and powertrain systems, optimizing the cooling of traction motors, and maximizing the thermal optimization of gearbox and housing components.\n\nOptimizing antenna design and placement, achieving EMC compliance, minimizing EMI, and testing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) or ADAS radars can be costly, complex challenges. Altair® Feko® offers antenna design and placement optimization, EMC analysis, EMI mitigation, and virtual test drives for installed antenna performance, V2X communication, and ADAS radar development. It also helps engineers simulate electromagnetic behavior in components like antennas and sensors for better communication and coordination between vehicle systems.\n\nInefficiencies, delays, and higher costs are just some of the challenges the automotive supply chain faces today. Altair understands these challenges and complexities, and provides comprehensive supply chain management solutions to optimize sourcing, inventory, and logistics. Our tools, including supplier collaboration, demand planning, and logistics optimization, help customers achieve greater efficiency and cost savings.\n\nWith Altair’s data analytics and supply chain optimization expertise, automakers can master variable demand and streamline their operations, ensuring they can deliver high-quality products to their customers on time and within budget.\n\nConducting preventative maintenance, according to use time and cycles, helps automakers avoid equipment failure. But it can also mean stopping a well-functioning machine, even if there’s nothing currently wrong. Predictive maintenance is a better way organizations can maintain equipment without disrupting production.\n\nBy pairing our intuitive machine learning tools with cloud-based or edge computing systems to analyze data from your factory floor, Altair® RapidMiner® helps you keep a close eye on your equipment’s health. Our solutions give you the confidence to keep machines running, knowing that you can catch and address issues that aren’t easily detectable, avoiding costly failures and equipment downtime.\n\nThe large number and variety of warranty claims in the automotive market makes traditional business intelligence-based methods unwieldy. But these claims contain valuable information about product quality and reliability, customer expectations, and can reveal design or manufacturing defects. Our solutions enable automakers to utilize this data source make improvements to existing products, develop more reliable new products, and drive increased profitability.\n\nRenault Nissan Mitsubishi Alliance is a French-Japanese strategic partnership between the automobile manufacturers Renault (based in France), Nissan (based in Japan) and Mitsubishi Motors (based in Japan). Today, the automotive group has 122 manufacturing plants worldwide with nearly 450,000 employees controlling ten major brands: Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Infiniti, Renault Samsung, Dacia, Alpine, Datsun, Venucia, and Lada. The ambition of the alliance is to offer autonomous drive, connectivity features, and services on a wide range of affordable vehicles. As part of the Renault Chassis Le Mans plant, which is building car-to-ground connecting components for the Renault Group and for the Alliance, the CTC Chassis Technical Center is a CAD engineering center where 350 engineers and technicians are working with a focus on testing and validation. Renault has been using SimSolid to perform simulations to develop lighter chassis faster.\n\nIn this presentation hear about some of the latest innovations at Jaguar Land Rover and their 'Reimagine' Strategy that includes electrification technologies and connected services. Key technology developments are mentioned, including JLR's unique multi-disciplinary organization and the importance of simulation. The role of academia and how it can support industry is discussed, alongside a look at the ideal engineer profile and skill sets required.\n\nPresented at the 2nd Altair Academic Outreach Event in June 2021\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Tayeb Zeguer, Group Tech Leader, Advanced CAE, Jaguar Land Rover\n\nDuration: 15 minutes"
