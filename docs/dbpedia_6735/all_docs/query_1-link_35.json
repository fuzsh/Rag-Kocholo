        "text": "TEA provides districts and educators with an optional set of high-quality instructional materials (HQIM) designed especially for Texas.\n\nTwo scopes of materials are available to school systems in Texas:\n\nFull-subject materials: full sets of materials designed to provide the teacher with everything needed to cover 100% of the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) in a grade level/band, including scope and sequence, daily lesson plans, and student materials.\n\nSupplemental materials: materials not designed to cover 100% of the TEKS but designed to complement, enrich, and/or extend supports in a particular subject and/or grade band.\n\nFor material of any scope, TEA may make it available in two different types of licenses:\n\nPilot Texas Open Education Resources (OER): state-developed materials where the underlying intellectual property is either owned by the state of Texas or it can be freely used and modified by the state in perpetuity. These materials are made freely available forever in digital form to Texas school districts and educators to use or modify as they see fit. They can be printed to ensure students have access to paper instructional materials. In the future, TEA plans to ensure students have access to printed versions at cost. Finally, these materials are updated to improve their quality with new versions over time based on feedback from teachers and parents.\n\nTemporary State-Licensed Resources: state-acquired digital materials where TEA has procured a state-wide license so that the materials are freely available to Texas school districts and educators for a specified range of school years.\n\nFollowing the passage of House Bill (HB) 1605 (88th Texas Legislature, Regular Session, 2023), all Pilot Texas OER materials must be reviewed and approved by the State Board of Education (SBOE) in the new Instructional Materials Review and Approval (IMRA) process.\n\nThe materials on this web page are made available to a limited number of classroom teachers for a limited time before the materials are reviewed under the new IMRA process.\n\nSchool districts and charter schools retain the responsibility under state law to ensure TEKS are covered in ways deemed most appropriate by the local school system. Prior to publication, materials go through a rigorous third-party review based on an approved rubric. Review criteria include TEKS alignment, support for all learners (including students with disabilities) progress monitoring, implementation supports, age appropriateness, and more. Materials also are subject to a focus group of Texas educators. For most OER materials, TEA operates a continuous improvement process to update the content of the instructional materials to ensure is of the highest quality, based on feedback from districts, teachers, and parents.\n\nWhen the COVID pandemic began to disrupt in-person learning, Texas public schools were not prepared to provide remote or hybrid instruction with appropriately designed instructional materials, and children fell behind because of lost instructional time. As a result, TEA undertook an accelerated process to acquire effective instructional material resources for schools that could support remote, in-person, and hybrid instruction, both to support schools during the pandemic and to speed up learning recovery efforts longer term. Learn more about this response and Pilot Texas OER content moving forward (PDF).\n\nAll content found in Pilot Texas OER materials available from TEA is provided online to allow for maximum transparency so that parents can see lessons offered to their students in classrooms that may be using them; review and feedback are always appreciated.\n\nVisit each material page below to learn more about each product, including online viewing for all materials available to students and teachers.\n\nFull-Subject Materials: Pilot Texas OER\n\nFull-subject materials are designed to cover 100% of the TEKS in the indicated grade level/band. These materials will be updated with new version releases as part of a continuous improvement process (except for Pilot K–5 Science).\n\nGrade and Subject Material Name Additional Costs Assessment Platforms Available in Spanish K–5 RLA Pilot K–5 RLA Literacy Program (COVID Emergency Release V4)\n\nTrade books*\n\nPrint orders\n\nTexas Test Delivery System (TDS)\n\nDMAC\n\nEduphoria\n\nYes 9–12 RLA Pilot 9–12 RLA Literacy Program (COVID Emergency Release) Currently not available (learn more)\n\nN/A\n\nComing soon K–5 Math Pilot K–5 Math (COVID Emergency Release V2) Manipulative kits\n\nPrint orders\n\nTDS\n\nDMAC\n\nEduphoria\n\nYes 6–12 Math Pilot 6–12 Math (COVID Emergency Release, Pilot Edition V3) Print orders\n\nDMAC\n\nEduphoria\n\nCarnegie Learning site\n\nGrade 6 content, family guides for all grades K–5 Science Pilot K–5 Science (COVID Emergency Release V2) Science kits*\n\nTrade books*\n\nPrint orders PDFs available on a microsite No\n\n*Denotes a resource that educators may already have access to (e.g., trade books or materials in a science kit) which is required for a high-fidelity implementation of the material.\n\nFull-Subject Materials: Temporary State-Licensed\n\nThese core materials are designed to cover 100% of the TEKS in the indicated grade level/band. They will be freely accessible for a limited time by school districts. If schools wish to continue using them locally after the access term, they will be available for purchase from the vendor.\n\nGrade and Subject Material Name Digital Access Term Additional Costs Available in Spanish 6–8 RLA Amplify ELAR Texas Freely available through 9/2023 Print orders No Pre-K Teaching Strategies for Texas Freely available through 8/2024 Trade books** Print orders Teacher and parent content\n\n**Denotes a resource that must be purchased from the vendor for high-fidelity use of the material.\n\nSupplemental Materials: Pilot Texas OER\n\nThe following Pilot Texas OER supplemental materials for secondary math and science remain available; however, since they were released before COVID, they have not yet been reviewed by a third party and are not currently updated by TEA.\n\nGrade Material Name Developing Institution Additional Costs License 9–12 Pilot TEA AP® Biology Rice University's OpenStax None Creative Commons 9–12 Pilot TEA AP® Macroeconomics Rice University's OpenStax None Creative Commons 9–12 Pilot TEA AP® Microeconomics Rice University's OpenStax None Creative Commons 9–12 Pilot TEA Physics Rice University's OpenStax None Creative Commons 9–12 Pilot TEA AP® Physics 1: Algebra-Based Rice University's OpenStax None Creative Commons 9–12 Pilot TEA AP® Physics 2: Algebra-Based Rice University's OpenStax None Creative Commons 9–12 Pilot TEA Statistics Rice University's OpenStax None Creative Commons 9–12 Pilot Study Edge Chemistry Study Edge None Creative Commons 9–12 Pilot Study Edge Physics Study Edge None Creative Commons 9–12 Pilot Study Edge Precalculus Study Edge None Creative Commons 9–12 Pilot Study Edge Statistics Study Edge None Creative Commons\n\nSupplemental Materials: Temporary State-Licensed\n\nThese materials are not designed to cover 100% of the TEKS, but they complement, enrich, or extend supports in a particular subject and grade band.\n\nGrade and Subject Material Name Digital Access Term Additional Costs Available in Spanish K–2 RLA Amplify Reading Texas Freely available statewide license expired 8/2022 None All content 6–8 RLA Amplify Reading Texas Freely available statewide license through 8/2023 None All content K–5 Math ST Math Freely available statewide license through 12/2023 None Language-neutral platform 6–12 Math MATHia Freely available statewide license through 8/2023 None N/A\n\nSupplemental Tutoring: Temporary State-Licensed\n\nAs part of student support in response to COVID learning loss, the following tools have been made temporarily available.\n\nGrade and Subject Material Name Digital Access Term Additional Costs Available in Spanish\n\nK–5 RLA\n\nTutoring\n\nAmplify mCLASS Intervention + Tutoring Available through 8/2024 None Pre-lesson English learner supports\n\nK–8 RLA\n\nTutoring\n\nBookNook Available through 8/2023 None Includes support for Spanish speakers\n\nK–5 Math\n\nTutoring\n\nZearn Math Available through 8/2024 None Tutor materials available in English and Spanish\n\nDigital and Print Access\n\nIn addition to digital access, all products allow educators, campuses, or individuals to self-print the materials. For more information on printing instructions or options for purchase, please submit a Help Desk ticket.\n\nSupporting Students with Disabilities\n\nSpecially Designed Instruction (SDI) is changes to the content, methodology, or delivery on instruction students receive when they are eligible for special education support services. SDI Field User Guides are intended to be a bridge between existing student support plans and the instructional content available within the HQIM suite of resources from TEA. For more information, please visit www.inclusionintexas.org.\n\nTable Definitions\n\nTrade book: an authentic text written and published for the public that is used within the curriculum; many are commonly found in school libraries\n\nUnit reader: a text developed and compiled by a publisher that is under a license that prevents free use\n\nScience kit: a set of materials for use in hands-on science exploration\n\nData Collection and Privacy Practices\n\nTEA takes data security seriously and has robust protections in place to guard confidential student data. Currently, Open Education Resource products have a digital component that is only accessed by teachers so that they can see lesson plans and related content, no student-level data is captured. Digital versions of OER content for students is limited to PDFs that can be shown on student laptops, although printed versions of the material are preferable for learning. Importantly, no student surveys are ever administered as part of any OER product.\n\nBeyond OER, all digital learning products used in schools must comply with federal & state student privacy laws. Any student data collected, in assessments or otherwise, are fully protected by federal law in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. §1232g, and Texas law including Texas Education Code §32 Subchapter D and Texas Government Code §552.114 and §2054. Any digital learning materials made available to school systems by TEA must meet high standards of data privacy and cybersecurity enforced by contract terms and conditions by TEA and for cloud services must also comply with the Department of Information Resources TX-Ramp program."
