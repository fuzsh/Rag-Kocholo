        "text": "Data science is routinely ranked as one of the best career choices. What’s more, our analysis of job posting data shows that the demand for data science skills will drive a 41.9% rise in employment in the field through 2031. Not only is there a huge demand, but there’s also a noticeable shortage of qualified data scientists.\n\nIf you have a passion for computers, math, and discovering answers through data analysis, then earning an advanced degree in data science or data analytics might be your next step.\n\nWhat is data science?\n\nMartin Schedlbauer, PhD, teaching professor and director of online faculty and programs at Northeastern University, says that data science is used by “computing professionals who have the skills for collecting, shaping, storing, managing, and analyzing data [as an] important resource for organizations to allow for data-driven decision making.” Almost every interaction with technology includes data—your Amazon purchases, Facebook feed, Netflix recommendations, and even the facial recognition required to sign in to your phone.\n\nComputer science vs. data science: Which is right for you?\n\nDownload our free guide to explore career opportunities in computer and data science.\n\nDownload Now\n\nWhy is data science important?\n\n1. Provides a personalized user experience\n\nAmazon is a prime example of just how helpful data collection can be for the average shopper. Amazon’s datasets remember what you’ve purchased, what you’ve paid, and what you’ve searched. This allows Amazon to customize its subsequent homepage views to fit your needs. For example, if you search for camping gear, baby items, and groceries, Amazon will not spam you with ads or product recommendations for geriatric vitamins. Instead, you are going to see items that may actually benefit you, such as a compact camping high chair for infants.\n\nLearn More: Data Analytics vs. Data Science: A Breakdown\n\nSimilarly, data science can be useful for reminding you of habitual purchases. If you order diapers every month, for example, you might see a strategically placed coupon or deal around the same time each month. This use of data is meant to act as a trigger, prompting you to think, “I just remembered I need to buy diapers, and I should buy them now because they are on sale.”\n\n2. Saves money for both consumers and companies\n\nData science benefits both companies and consumers alike. McKinsey Global Institute found that big data can increase a retailer’s profit margin by 60%, and “services enabled by personal-location data can allow consumers to capture $600 billion in economic surplus,” meaning they are able to purchase a good or service for less than they were expecting. For example, if you budgeted $7,500 to purchase a jacuzzi and then found the exact model you wanted for $6,000, your economic surplus would be $1,500. Data science can simultaneously increase retailer profitability and save consumers money, which is a win-win for a healthy economy.\n\n3. Improves public health\n\nData science doesn’t just enable retailers to influence our purchasing habits—its importance extends much further.\n\nData science can improve public health through wearable trackers that motivate individuals to adopt healthier habits and can alert people to potentially critical health issues. Data can also improve diagnostic accuracy, accelerate finding cures for specific diseases, or even stop the spread of a virus.\n\nWhen the Ebola virus outbreak hit West Africa in 2014, scientists were able to track the spread of the disease and predict the areas most vulnerable to the illness. This data helped health officials get in front of the outbreak and prevent it from becoming a worldwide epidemic.\n\n4. Benefits almost every industry\n\nData science has critical applications across most industries. For example, data is used by farmers for efficient food growth and delivery, by food suppliers to cut down on food waste, and by nonprofit organizations to boost fundraising efforts and predict funding needs.\n\nIn a 2015 speech, economist and Freakonomics author Steven Levitt said that CEOs know they are missing out on the importance of big data, but they do not have the right teams in place to perform the skills. He says, “I really do believe still that the combination of collaborations with firms’ big data and randomization […] is absolutely going to be at the center of what economics is and what other social sciences are going forward.”\n\nPursuing a career in data science is a smart move, not just because it’s trendy and pays well, but because data very well may be the pivot point on which the entire economy turns.\n\nIn-demand data science careers\n\nData science experts are needed in virtually every job sector—not just technology. In fact, the five biggest tech companies—Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook—only employ half of 1% of U.S. employees. In order to break into these high-paying, in-demand roles, an advanced education is generally required.\n\n“While there are notable exceptions, a very strong educational background is usually required to develop the depth of knowledge necessary to be a data scientist,” reports KDnuggets, a leading site on big data.\n\nHere are some of the leading data science careers you can break into with an advanced degree.\n\n1.
