        "text": "Asthma / COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)\n\nIf you don’t have asthma, you are likely to know somebody who does – it affects over 10% of the population. Its fundamental cause is not well understood and precipitants can include pollution, pet dander, pollen, mould, tobacco smoke and chemical irritants.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 235 million people suffer from asthma and 64 million people suffer from COPD (2004).\n\nWHO also states that asthma is under diagnosed and under treated.\n\nThe NHS (UK) spends around £1 billion a year treating and caring for people with asthma.\n\nCOPD is the third leading cause of death in America, claiming 134,676 lives in 2010.\n\nAn estimated 75% of UK hospital admissions are avoidable and as many as 90% of the deaths from asthma are preventable.\n\nMost asthma–related deaths occur in low to middle income countries.\n\nRespiratory Drug Delivery Systems\n\nPrior PLM Medical has been intensely involved in the development of respiratory devices for asthma and COPD. We have extensive knowledge around the challenges in delivering these products to the market and have developed a number of patented mechanisms for respiratory devices. We often engage with clients who have particular difficulties getting their products market ready. Our areas of expertise include:\n\nProduct development.\n\nIndependent product evaluation.\n\nRobust design studies.\n\nHigh speed x-ray analysis (4000+fps).\n\nPlume force, temperature and geometry analysis.\n\nHigh speed video analysis.\n\nLocalised mechanism testing.\n\nSimulated user studies.\n\nProject specific test equipment.\n\nDevice functionality studies.\n\nProof of principal engineering studies.\n\nDiabetes Mellitus\n\nDiabetes is prevalent in the developed world and is a growing problem in developing countries. Treatment although effective can be difficult and the patient must take an active role in treating their own disease.\n\nOf over 220 million diabetics worldwide, 25.8 million are American.\n\nDiabetes is the 5th deadliest disease in U.S. claiming the lives of two thirds of all diabetics.\n\n3.4 million people died as a result of high blood sugar in 2004 alone.\n\nWHO projects diabetes deaths to double between 2005 – 2030.\n\n50% of diabetics die from cardiovascular disease, 10-20% from kidney failure.\n\nBetween 2006-2015, it is forecasted that China alone will lose $558 billion due to heart disease, stroke and diabetes.\n\n80% of diabetic deaths occur in low- to middle-income countries.\n\n“Fusion” Project – Closed loop Insulin Delivery\n\nSince 2011, Prior PLM Medical has been involved in an internally funded test-bed project (named “FUSION”) to develop a closed-loop insulin delivery system to help diabetic patients better manage their disease. The objective is to take the burden off the patient, empowering them by use of an implanted glucose sensor to automatically measure glucose levels (in contrast to the conventional manual “glucometer”).\n\nThe “live” data enables a miniature discrete pump to constantly deliver insulin in a way that better replicates the normal functioning of a healthy pancreas.\n\nGlucose levels and insulin delivery are constantly monitored and trended. The data can be used by the patient to better understand their insulin needs and by GPs to monitor patient compliance.\n\nThe insulin delivery pump uses an innovative peristaltic pump and disposable reservoir to deliver both small and large doses of insulin with much greater accuracy than conventional syringe pumps.\n\nThe insulin temperature is continuously monitored to reduce the risk of insulin degradation.\n\nAll drug contact elements are replaceable as a part of the reservoir and infusion set, maintaining sterility.\n\nPrototyping\n\nRapid prototypes are sufficient for basic fit, form and function but often fail to represent the quality of high volume manufactured components. Material, friction properties, surface finish, and warpage are not accurately replicated. We employ a cassette tooling system that allows us to make production quality components with a short lead-time. These samples are often used for clinical trials and to validate high volume assembly equipment in lieu of the production moulds that may still be in manufacture."
