        "text": "One company, three divisions, diverse markets\n\nRohde & Schwarz in brief\n\nRohde & Schwarz is a global technology group striving for a safer and connected world. With its Test & Measurement, Technology Systems and Networks & Cybersecurity Divisions, the company creates tomorrow's innovations today. The company's leading-edge products and solutions empower industrial, regulatory and military customers to attain technological and digital sovereignty.\n\nInnovation has been part of Rohde & Schwarz since the very beginning. The company founders Dr. Lothar Rohde und Dr. Hermann Schwarz were technological pioneers. With their hands-on entrepreneurial spirit, the two college friends entered the unexplored field of RF engineering. Ninety years later, the company is still pushing technological boundaries â€“ as a successful shaper of cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), 6G, cloud and quantum technologies.\n\nThe privately owned company is known for stability and resilience. Independence is at the core of its entrepreneurial identity. The company finances its growth with its own resources. Because the company does not have to think in terms of quarterly results, it can plan sustainably for the long term. The high added value of Rohde & Schwarz makes the company a reliable, trustworthy and relevant partner for its customers.\n\nThe Executive Board is composed of Christian Leicher (President and CEO) and Andreas Pauly (President and CTO). On June 30, 2023, Rohde & Schwarz had about 13,800 employees worldwide. About 8,700 of them work in Germany. The group generated net revenue of EUR 2.78 billion in the 2022/2023 fiscal year (July to June).\n\nGlobal player with roots in Germany\n\nRohde & Schwarz has an extensive sales and service network and is present in about 70 countries, primarily with its own subsidiaries. The company is headquartered in Munich, Germany. Regional hubs in Singapore and Columbia, Maryland coordinate business activities in Asia and North America.\n\nTo maintain its high quality standards, flexibility and reliability, the company covers a significant share of the value chain in-house. Most of its products are developed in Germany. In addition, the Asian hub in Singapore uses its resources to develop, produce and market products for the global market. The company also has other R&D locations in some European countries, in the USA and Asia as well as in Africa.\n\nRohde & Schwarz has always seen the close proximity of R&D and production locations as an advantage. The employees at the German plants in Memmingen and Teisnach as well as the Czech town of Vimperk close to the German border manufacture most of the product range. Smaller plants in Singapore and Malaysia provide manufacturing capacity in close collaboration with R&D at the Asian headquarters.\n\nA number of subsidiaries in Germany and Europe ideally complement the group's solution portfolio in various market segments with their product range and expertise.\n\nEmployees are the most valuable asset\n\nThanks to its highly qualified and motivated employees, Rohde & Schwarz ranks among the technology leaders in all of its markets. That's why Rohde & Schwarz consistently focuses on people. The corporate culture is characterized by the freedom to make decisions, personal responsibility, mutual respect and appreciation. This creates a work environment that allows our employees to indulge their passion for technology and turn their ideas into innovative solutions for the market. Regular recognition with awards such as the \"FOCUS TOP National Employer\" demonstrate the satisfaction of our employees and the company's attractiveness on the job market.\n\nAnother Rohde & Schwarz priority, along with the development of all employees, is to identify young talent at an early stage and prepare them for responsible specialist and management positions. Nationality, gender and organizational boundaries are unimportant, and international employee exchanges between headquarters and the various subsidiaries are well established.\n\nSince its founding, Rohde & Schwarz has prepared thousands of young people for professional careers. The company offers training in professions ranging from electronics technicians and IT specialists to industrial administrative assistants. The company offers combined vocational training/degree programs in various subjects, including computer science, electrical engineering and industrial engineering and management. The \"Poly goes UAS\" program offered in collaboration with the polytechnic schools in Singapore have a similar structure. It enables students from Asia to combine a bachelor's degree at a German university of applied sciences (UAS) with internships at cooperating \"hidden champions\" such as Rohde & Schwarz. The Graduate Development Program offered by Rohde & Schwarz North America provides university graduates with opportunities to find their individual career path in the company under the guidance of a mentor.\n\nTest & Measurement Division\n\nNo industrial sector can do without electronics. Test and measurement solutions from Rohde & Schwarz are there every step of the way, from R&D to quality assurance, manufacturing and service. The portfolio includes all types of RF T&M equipment and systems as well as complementary products. The companyâ€™s focus is on the requirements of the mobile and wireless communications market, a market Rohde & Schwarz has been closely involved with for decades, on the requirements of the automotive industry, whose added value is increasingly based on vehiclesâ€˜ electronic features, and on the T&M requirements of the aerospace and defense industry.

The range of supported technologies encompasses all cellular and non-cellular standards. And the technology group thinks ahead: while focused on the customersâ€™ needs today, 6G is already on the companyâ€™s mind and in its labs. Rohde & Schwarz has been closely involved right from the start and actively supports the ongoing fundamental research activities at 6G organizations, universities and research institutes across Europe, North America and Asia.

Rohde & Schwarz designs and develops innovative security, surveillance and intelligence solutions that enable governments to enhance their national security and citizen safety. Systems and solutions from Rohde & Schwarz help intelligence services, security authorities and police forces to sustain information superiority through a comprehensive operational picture and actionable insights for investigations.\n\nIP network analytics\n\nThe massive increase in internet traffic and expanding technologies, such as cloud computing, the internet of things, 5G, the move to 6G, and increased encryption, are challenging network connectivity and security. To master these challenges granular insights into IP network data are crucial. By providing a better understanding of their network data, the IP Network Analytics software by the Rohde & Schwarz subsidiary ipoque empowers customers to optimize and effectively manage their network data, and ensure the highest connectivity and security. Therefore, it can be embedded in networking, telco and cybersecurity solutions.\n\nBroadcast, amplifiers & media\n\nRohde & Schwarz supports the media industry along the entire value chain from content creation to transmission. The company has been an innovator in the field of broadcasting for nearly 80 years. Network service providers around the world trust its market-leading TV and radio transmitters. The worldâ€™s most powerful solid-state TV transmitter with 106 kW transmit power, for example, is located in One World Trade Center in New York.
