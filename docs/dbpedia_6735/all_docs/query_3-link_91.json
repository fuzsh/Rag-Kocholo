        "text": "See also Levels of Evidence\n\nThese study designs all have similar components (as we’d expect from the PICO):\n\nA defined population (P) from which groups of subjects are studied\n\nOutcomes (O) that are measured\n\nAnd for experimental and analytic observational studies:\n\nInterventions (I) or exposures (E) that are applied to different groups of subjects\n\nOverview of the design tree\n\nFigure 1 shows the tree of possible designs, branching into subgroups of study designs by whether the studies are descriptive or analytic and by whether the analytic studies are experimental or observational. The list is not completely exhaustive but covers most basics designs.\n\nFigure: Tree of different types of studies (Q1, 2, and 3 refer to the three questions below)\n\n> Download a PDF by Jeremy Howick about study designs\n\nOur first distinction is whether the study is analytic or non-analytic. A non-analytic or descriptive study does not try to quantify the relationship but tries to give us a picture of what is happening in a population, e.g., the prevalence, incidence, or experience of a group. Descriptive studies include case reports, case-series, qualitative studies and surveys (cross-sectional) studies, which measure the frequency of several factors, and hence the size of the problem. They may sometimes also include analytic work (comparing factors “” see below).\n\nAn analytic study attempts to quantify the relationship between two factors, that is, the effect of an intervention (I) or exposure (E) on an outcome (O). To quantify the effect we will need to know the rate of outcomes in a comparison (C) group as well as the intervention or exposed group. Whether the researcher actively changes a factor or imposes uses an intervention determines whether the study is considered to be observational (passive involvement of researcher), or experimental (active involvement of researcher).\n\nIn experimental studies, the researcher manipulates the exposure, that is he or she allocates subjects to the intervention or exposure group. Experimental studies, or randomised controlled trials (RCTs), are similar to experiments in other areas of science. That is, subjects are allocated to two or more groups to receive an intervention or exposure and then followed up under carefully controlled conditions. Such studies controlled trials, particularly if randomised and blinded, have the potential to control for most of the biases that can occur in scientific studies but whether this actually occurs depends on the quality of the study design and implementation.\n\nIn analytic observational studies, the researcher simply measures the exposure or treatments of the groups. Analytical observational studies include case””control studies, cohort studies and some population (cross-sectional) studies. These studies all include matched groups of subjects and assess of associations between exposures and outcomes.\n\nObservational studies investigate and record exposures (such as interventions or risk factors) and observe outcomes (such as disease) as they occur. Such studies may be purely descriptive or more analytical.\n\nWe should finally note that studies can incorporate several design elements. For example, a the control arm of a randomised trial may also be used as a cohort study; and the baseline measures of a cohort study may be used as a cross-sectional study.\n\nSpotting the study design\n\nThe type of study can generally be worked at by looking at three issues (as per the Tree of design in Figure 1):\n\nQ1. What was the aim of the study?\n\nTo simply describe a population (PO questions) descriptive\n\nTo quantify the relationship between factors (PICO questions) analytic.\n\nQ2. If analytic, was the intervention randomly allocated?\n\nYes? RCT\n\nNo? Observational study\n\nFor observational study the main types will then depend on the timing of the measurement of outcome, so our third question is:\n\nQ3. When were the outcomes determined?\n\nSome time after the exposure or intervention? cohort study (‘prospective study’)\n\nAt the same time as the exposure or intervention? cross sectional study or survey\n\nBefore the exposure was determined? case-control study (‘retrospective study’ based on recall of the exposure)\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of the Designs\n\nRandomised Controlled Trial\n\nAn experimental comparison study in which participants are allocated to treatment/intervention or control/placebo groups using a random mechanism (see randomisation). Best for study the effect of an intervention.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nunbiased distribution of confounders;\n\nblinding more likely;\n\nrandomisation facilitates statistical analysis.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nexpensive: time and money;\n\nvolunteer bias;\n\nethically problematic at times.\n\nCrossover Design\n\nA controlled trial where each study participant has both therapies, e.g, is randomised to treatment A first, at the crossover point they then start treatment B. Only relevant if the outcome is reversible with time, e.g, symptoms.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nall subjects serve as own controls and error variance is reduced thus reducing sample size needed;\n\nall subjects receive treatment (at least some of the time);\n\nstatistical tests assuming randomisation can be used;\n\nblinding can be maintained.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nall subjects receive placebo or alternative treatment at some point;\n\nwashout period lengthy or unknown;\n\ncannot be used for treatments with permanent effects\n\nCohort Study\n\nData are obtained from groups who have been exposed, or not exposed, to the new technology or factor of interest (eg from databases). No allocation of exposure is made by the researcher. Best for study the effect of predictive risk factors on an outcome.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nethically safe;\n\nsubjects can be matched;\n\ncan establish timing and directionality of events;\n\neligibility criteria and outcome assessments can be standardised;\n\nadministratively easier and cheaper than RCT.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\ncontrols may be difficult to identify;\n\nexposure may be linked to a hidden confounder;\n\nblinding is difficult;\n\nrandomisation not present;\n\nfor rare disease, large sample sizes or long follow-up necessary.\n\nCase-Control Studies\n\nPatients with a certain outcome or disease and an appropriate group of controls without the outcome or disease are selected (usually with careful consideration of appropriate choice of controls, matching, etc) and then information is obtained on whether the subjects have been exposed to the factor under investigation.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nquick and cheap;\n\nonly feasible method for very rare disorders or those with long lag between exposure and outcome;\n\nfewer subjects needed than cross-sectional studies.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nreliance on recall or records to determine exposure status;\n\nconfounders;\n\nselection of control groups is difficult;\n\npotential bias: recall, selection.\n\nCross-Sectional Survey\n\nA study that examines the relationship between diseases (or other health-related characteristics) and other variables of interest as they exist in a defined population at one particular time (ie exposure and outcomes are both measured at the same time). Best for quantifying the prevalence of a disease or risk factor, and for quantifying the accuracy of a diagnostic test.\n\nAdvantages:\n\ncheap and simple;\n\nethically safe.\n\nDisadvantages:"
