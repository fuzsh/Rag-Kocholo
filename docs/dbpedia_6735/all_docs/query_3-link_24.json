        "text": "At any stage of a medicine's development, a developer can ask guidance and direction from EMA on the best methods and study designs to generate robust information on how well a medicine works and how safe it is, regardless of whether the medicine is eligible for the centralised authorisation procedure or not.\n\nScientific advice helps to ensure that developers perform the appropriate tests and studies, so that no major objections regarding the design of the tests are likely to be raised during the evaluation of the marketing authorisation application. This also helps avoid patients taking part in studies that will not produce useful evidence.\n\nFor human medicines, scientific advice and protocol assistance are given by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on the recommendation of the Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP). However, in the case of medicines that are intended to treat, prevent or diagnose a disease causing a declared public health emergency, scientific advice is given by the CHMP based on recommendation of the Emergency Task Force (ETF).\n\nFrom lab to patient: journey of a medicine\n\nProspective applicants who are completely new to scientific advice or have little prior interaction with medicines regulators may benefit from reviewing the journey of a medicine for human use assessed by EMA in this interactive timeline, as a first step.\n\nThis timeline explains all stages - from initial research to patient access - including how EMA supports medicine development, assesses the benefits and risks and monitors the safety of medicines.\n\nThe full text is available as a From laboratory to patient: the journey of a centrally authorised medicine.\n\nFor information on how to request scientific advice from EMA, see Requesting scientific advice or protocol assistance from EMA.\n\nHow scientific advice works\n\nEMA gives scientific advice by responding to specific questions posed by the medicine developer on the development of a particular medicine.\n\nThe developer of a medicine presents the way it plans to develop its medicine and identifies questions and possible solutions. EMA then gives advice on the developer’s proposals.\n\nScientific advice is prospective in nature. EMA does not pre-evaluate the results of the studies and in no way concludes on whether the benefits of the medicine outweigh the risks.\n\nScientific advice from EMA is not legally binding on EMA or on the medicine developer with regard to any future marketing authorisation applications for the medicine concerned.\n\nWhen is scientific advice most useful\n\nScientific advice and protocol assistance are particularly useful to medicine developers when:\n\nthey are developing an innovative medicine and there appears to be no or insufficient relevant detail in EU guidelines or guidance documents, or in Pharmacopoeia monographs, including draft documents or monographs released for consultation;\n\nthey are developing new or repurposed medicines targeting (re)emerging pathogens for which there is an unmet medical need but insufficient or no guidance is available;\n\nthe developer chooses to deviate from scientific guidelines in its development plan;\n\nthe medicine developer has limited knowledge about medicine regulation, such as some academic groups or micro, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nMedicine developers can request scientific advice or protocol assistance either during the initial development of a medicine before submission of a marketing authorisation application or later on, during the post-authorisation phase.\n\nTypes of questions addressed\n\nQuestions during scientific advice can relate to:\n\nquality aspects (e.g. manufacturing, chemical, pharmaceutical and biological testing of the medicine);\n\nnon-clinical aspects (e.g. toxicological and pharmacological tests designed to show the activity of the medicine in the laboratory);\n\nclinical aspects (e.g. appropriateness of studies in patients or healthy volunteers, selection of endpoints, i.e. how best to measure effects in a study, post-authorisation activities including risk management plans);\n\nmethodological issues (e.g. statistical tests to use, data analysis, modelling and simulation);\n\noverall development strategy (e.g., conditional marketing authorisation, bridging strategy for generics, safety database), significant benefit for maintaining orphan designation, and paediatric developments.\n\nExamples of questions\n\nAre the patients to be included in a study sufficiently representative of the population for whom the medicine is intended?\n\nAre the planned measures to assess the benefits of a medicine valid and relevant?\n\nIs the proposed plan to analyse results appropriate?\n\nDoes the study last long enough and include enough patients to provide the necessary data for the benefit-risk assessment?\n\nIs the medicine being compared with an appropriate control?\n\nAre the plans to follow the long-term safety of the product appropriately designed?\n\nQuestions outside the scope of scientific advice\n\nQuestions about the topics below are outside the scope of scientific advice:\n\nCompassionate use, advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) classification, PRIME eligibility, and accelerated assessment\n\nAdequacy of planned paediatric studies or an overall development plan to support a paediatric indication, which EMA addresses via a PIP submission\n\nChanges to the key elements of Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) measures and paediatric waivers or deferrals, which EMA addresses via a paediatric procedure\n\nMatters of a purely regulatory nature (please use the ‘Submission Details’ field in your submission via the IRIS portal)\n\nAdequacy of existing data for assessment of a regulatory application (e.g. a clinical trial application or marketing authorisation application). However, please include existing data expected to inform the discussion of questions on further development steps in the scientific advice briefing documentation\n\nExamples of questions\n\nCan the proposed studies support an indication in children above 2 years of age? (this is a question for the PDCO)\n\nCould the proposed modelling and simulation approach replace study X in the agreed PIP? (only the PDCO can endorse such matters)\n\nAre the proposed active substance/finished product specifications acceptable? (as opposed to: Is the plan to derive the specifications acceptable?)\n\nAre the non-clinical data adequate to support a first-in-human study? (this would require a full review of the non-clinical data before EMA can respond and the question would belong to a clinical trial application under national competent authority remit)\n\nAre the clinical pharmacology data adequate to support initiation of a phase 3 trial? (as opposed to: Would an additional pharmacokinetic study in patients be needed before proceeding to phase 3 development?)\n\nAre the phase 3 study results adequate to support marketing authorisation? (this is a question for the marketing authorisation application)\n\nProtocol assistance\n\nProtocol assistance is the special form of scientific advice available for developers of designated orphan medicines for rare diseases.\n\nIn addition to scientific advice, developers of orphan medicines can receive answers to questions relating to the criteria for authorisation of an orphan medicine. These include:\n\nthe demonstration of significant benefit within the scope of the designated orphan indication;\n\nsimilarity or clinical superiority over other medicines. This is relevant if other orphan medicinal products exist that might be similar to the product concerned and which have market exclusivity in the same indication.\n\nSteps of the process\n\n1. Registration with EMA\n\n2. Formal request and validation\n\n3. Appointment of coordinators\n\n4. coordinators form assessment teams and prepare report\n\n5. Meeting with developer (if requested by SAWP)\n\n6. Consulting experts\n\n7. Consulting patients\n\n7. EMA final response\n\nStandard operating procedure for scientific advice and protocol assistance procedure\n\nAdoptedReference Number: SOP/H/3037\n\nWhy following scientific advice does not guarantee marketing authorisation\n\nScientific advice and the assessment of the benefits and risks of a medicine are different by nature.\n\nScientific advice looks at how a medicine should be tested in studies to generate robust evidence, while the assessment at the time of marketing authorisation looks at the evidence generated to determine whether the medicine’s benefits outweigh its risks, regardless of any advice previously given.\n\nScientific advice can make the evaluation of a medicine easier and quicker because the evidence is likely to be more robust, appropriate and complete, but it does not affect the stringent assessment of safety and efficacy.\n\nComplying with scientific advice therefore increases the chances of receiving marketing authorisation but it does not guarantee it.\n\nWhat EMA publishes on outcomes of scientific advice\n\nDuring the development and assessment phases, the detailed advice given to a medicine developer is not made public. This is because disclosing information at this stage may undermine research and development efforts and discourage research in new medicines.\n\nHowever, information is made available after a medicine obtains marketing authorisation. All medicines whose assessment report was finalised after 1 January 2019 include a summary of the developer’s questions and key elements of EMA's advice and whether or not the developer complied with this advice within the assessment report.\n\nDuring a declared public health emergency, EMA publishes a list of medicines that have received informal or formal advice from the CHMP and the ETF.\n\nIn addition, the full advice can be made available upon request. For more information, see Access to documents.\n\nScientific advice is also one of the main sources for updating EMA scientific guidelines on medicine development, including, in particular, disease-specific guidelines.\n\nParallel scientific advice with the United States\n\nThe Agency provides scientific advice and protocol assistance in parallel with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nGeneral principles: European Medicines Agency-Food and Drug Administration parallel scientific advice\n\nTimeline: European Medicines Agency-FDA parallel scientific advice\n\nEMA and FDA launched a pilot programme in September 2021 to provide parallel scientific advice to marketing authorisation applicants for hybrid or complex generic products. More information is available in the documents below:\n\nPilot programme: European Medicines Agency-Food and Drug Administration parallel scientific advice for hybrid/complex generic products - General principles\n\nFor more information on EMA's cooperation with FDA:\n\nUnited States\n\nParallel consultations from regulators and HTA bodies\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) offers consultations in parallel with the European Network for Health Technology Assessment (EUnetHTA) 21 consortium.\n\nThis aims to allow medicine developers to obtain feedback from regulators and health technology assessment (HTA) bodies in European Union (EU) Member States on their evidence-generation plans to support decision-making on marketing authorisation and reimbursement of new medicines at the same time.\n\nFor more information, see Parallel consultation with regulators and health technology assessment bodies.\n\nScientific advice on clinical trials\n\nNational competent authorities are handling clinical trial authorisation in the EU.\n\nThere are various ways of seeking scientific advice, depending on the context. For information, see:\n\nAccelerating clinical trials in the EU: Scientific advice (section on 'mapped information on current voluntary procedures')\n\nTwo consolidated advice pilots enable medicine developers to improve the quality of applications for clinical trials.\n\nThe first pilot offers scientific advice on clinical trials and requirements for marketing authorisation applications.\n\nThis type of advice is made available via increased coordination between EMA's Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP) and the Clinical Trials Coordination Group (CTCG) operating under the Heads of Medicines Agencies (HMA).\n\nThe second pilot provides technical and regulatory support on the dossier of a clinical trial application prior to its submission through the Clinical Trials Information SystemClinical Trials Information System (CTIS).\n\nThe two pilots are part of the Accelerating Clinical Trials in the European Union (ACT EU) initiative. They were launched in June 2024.\n\nFor more information on the pilots and guidance on how to apply, see:\n\nAccelerating clinical trials in the EU: Scientific advice (section on 'Consolidated advice pilots')\n\nScientific advice on medicine repurposing\n\nThrough a pilot project, EMA and national competent authorities can offer tailored scientific advice to not-for-profit organisations and academics (institutions and individuals) on repurposing an authorised medicine for a new indication.\n\nThe aim is to help gather or generate enough evidence to support a new indication with important public health benefits for a medicine whose marketing authorisation holder is otherwise unlikely to undertake the necessary research and regulatory steps.\n\nThis provides a way of making new treatment options available to patients if it leads to the authorisation of the new indication.\n\nScientific advice fees are waived automatically for eligible academic sponsors repurposing a medicine for an orphan condition. Fees will also be waived for a subset of other applicants based on the expected public health benefits and strength of the evidence in their application.\n\nThe deadline to apply was 28 February 2022\n\nMore information including eligibility criteria is available in the documents below.\n\nQuestion and Answers on repurposing pilot project on proposal for framework to support not-for-profit organisations and academia in repurposing authorised medicines\n\nSubmission form - Repurposing pilot project for authorised medicines\n\nScientific advice on post-authorisation safety studies (PASS)\n\nEMA encourages medicine developers to seek scientific advice for PASS protocols. This voluntary, optional procedure will help to improve the design of studies meant to collect further information on a medicine's safety once it is on the market.\n\nEMA ran a 12-month pilot for this procedure between July 2015-2016.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\nQuestion on 'Scientific advice for safety studies' on our page Post-authorisation safety studies: questions and answers.\n\nScientific advice on biosimilars\n\nEMA offers tailored scientific advice on development programmes of new biosimiliar medicines.\n\nThe tailored procedure advises developers on the studies they should conduct, based on a review of the quality, analytical and functional data they already have available.\n\nMore specifically, tailored scientific advice can help assess cases:\n\nrequiring confirmation that the biosimilar pathway is suitable following detention of significant differences between the biosimilar candidate and the reference medicinal product in terms of physicochemical characterisation, biological activity, purity and quality attributes;\n\nproposing a scaled down clinical development programme based on the quality data available, namely cases where the programme would deviate from the available guidance (e.g. omission of dedicated clinical efficacy and / or safety studies).\n\nEMA will not accept requests for tailored advice without proper justification.\n\nThe tailored scientific advice procedure is open to all types of biosimilars and companies are encouraged to request a pre-submission meeting to review the suitability of the data package. Applicants should note that the SAWP will need an extra month in addition to normal scientific advice timelines to review applications.\n\nFor further information, please see the questions and answers document below.\n\nEMA first introduced the tailored procedure as a pilot project in 2017. A report on the pilot phase is available below.\n\nQuestions and Answers on the tailored scientific advice to support step-by-step development of new biosimilars\n\nReference Number: EMA/263753/2024Summary:\n\nTailored scientific advice to support step-by-step development of new biosimilars\n\nTailored Scientific Advice for biosimilar development: report on the experience from the pilot (2017-2020)\n\nReference Number: EMA/297462/2021Summary:\n\nTailored Scientific Advice for biosimilar development: report on the experience from the pilot (2017-2020)\n\nTopics"
