        "text": "Maybe you devoured Kelly Wearstler’s MasterClass or yearn to produce results like Nate and Jeremiah, but you don’t know where to begin. Wondering how to become an interior designer? We can help. Perhaps you’re fresh out of college or design school. Or maybe a few years into your career, you’re considering a professional pivot. Or when you were hiring an interior designer once, you thought, I can do this! Whatever the circumstances, if you’re considering a career path in interior design, it takes planning, diligence, strategy, and skill to potentially turn this hobby or interest into a full-fledged interior design career.\n\nBut how does one successfully embark on an interior design profession? Though the journey to the desired end result of becoming an interior designer may vary, landmark goals along the way remain consistent. With this idea in mind, AD PRO has distilled a step-by-step guide of how to become an interior designer.\n\nAsk yourself why\n\nJoin Now\n\nBecome an AD PRO member for only $25 $20 per month.\n\nArrow\n\nWhy are you drawn to the interior design profession? Do some serious self-reflection. Consider if you already possess design skills and why you think you’d be right for the job. Perhaps you have a penchant for decorating, a keen eye for color, and a knack for integrating textures, materials, textiles, and furnishings. That does not equal a professional interior designer. Anyone with an eye for decorating can be an interior decorator, but only accredited design professionals can call themselves interior designers. Recognize the distinction between the two fields. Consider if you truly possess a passion, determination, and skill to pursue a career in interior design, rather than merely an interest in decorating. If your area of interest falls more into the decorating realm, then go that route. Otherwise, if interior design is your proclivity, then take action and make your design career happen.\n\n“One of the benefits of the design industry is that there is a lot of variety in what you can do professionally, depending on your talents and interests,” offers Erika Moody, president of Helix Architecture + Design and the newly inducted IIDA international board president. “The strategy is to know yourself and your skills. Are you creative? If so, then a design firm is perfect for you. If you’re more of an organizer and love logistics, then you may be more well-suited for project management. Materials and product salespeople benefit greatly from having a design background.”\n\nIn this AD PRO Session, AD global visuals director Michael Shome gets interior photography do’s and don’ts from industry-leading photographer Douglas Friedman and stylist Dorcia Kelley\n\nEvaluate where you currently are on your journey to become an interior designer, where you plan to go, and, and what you endeavor to achieve. Are you more drawn to residential or commercial interior spaces? Would you prefer health care or education design? Or is retail, hospitality, or restaurant design more your thing? Do you aspire to work for one of the top 10 commercial interior design businesses in the country or aim to launch your own boutique interior design firm? It’s helpful to have your short- and long-term goals charted out to keep you motivated. However, also know that it’s perfectly okay to not stick to your plan 100%. Flexibility is key, take opportunities as they come even if they don’t perfectly align with what you thought you wanted, and as the old hackneyed cliché goes, revel in the fact that it’s the journey and not the destination.\n\nHow long does it take to become an interior designer?\n\nThat depends. If you opt for a bachelor’s degree in interior design, expect to spend four years studying the intricacies of the field. It’s also possible to become an interior designer in less time through an associate’s program, which takes two years. Regardless of your formal training—or lack thereof—it’s crucial to take and pass the National Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ) exam, which is required in most states to become a certified interior designer. While it’s not a requirement to graduate from an accredited interior design school to take the NCIDQ exam, it sure does help. Completing design school demonstrates that you have fulfilled the educational requirements that will prepare you to do well on the exam.\n\nAlso, think about the need for internships and work experience before embarking on your new interior design profession. All of these things take time, so be sure to factor into your timeline every step along the way.\n\nIs attending design school a must?\n\n“Formal education is a very deliberate path toward professional practice,” says David Harper, associate dean at the New York School of Interior Design (NYSID). “Certainly, you can learn about interior design without a formal education, but if your goal is professional practice, then embarking on that career path without a roadmap (formal education) makes for a long and potentially incomplete journey.”\n\nDuVäl Reynolds, certified interior designer and owner/principal designer at DuVäl Design, LLC, in Fairfax, Virginia, agrees. “Attending design school definitely offers a more holistic view of our industry and the craft. This is a more concentrated approach to learning technique, schematics, and compositions,” he explains. “Formal training also forces you to study topics that a layperson may not consider like art history, color theory, or specific computer programs.”\n\n“If you want to pursue interior design and not decorating, it is essential to attend school,” urges Maria Lomanto, president of ASID New York Metro and founding principal of DesignGLXY. “It would be a slow and arduous process to learn about building standards, codes, health safety, welfare, and lighting only through experience. Besides, if you ever wanted to get licensed, school would be required and any experience gained prior to classwork would not count towards qualifying to sit for the exam.”\n\nTo Lomanto’s point, becoming a licensed interior designer takes at least an associate’s degree—and more likely a bachelor’s degree—and a master’s puts you at an even greater advantage. An interior design degree in any related field is acceptable, but your coursework should include interior design, drawing, and computer-aided design (CAD) at the very least. Adding classes like graphic design, color theory, lighting, materials, building codes and standards, and art history can only enhance your base of knowledge. Also, degrees in fine arts, drafting and design tech, interior architecture, or theater design from a number of US colleges and universities could set the right foundation for an interior design career—just as long as you carefully plan a course of study that includes a range of design classes.\n\nWhat design school is right for you?\n\nIf you opt to attend interior design school, do some research to discern which programs are best suited to you. Conduct site visits to see what atmosphere resonates with you most, evaluate the curriculum to consider if it aligns with your professional ambitions and what’s relevant knowledge in the workplace, and consult current students and faculty to glean their perspective on the student experience at that school. Finally, talk to the admissions staff about what you can do to make your candidacy stand out among a sea of qualified aspiring interior design students.\n\nInterested in becoming an interior designer? Consult AD PRO’s list of the top interior design schools to consider for 2024\n\n“While many factors play into where you choose to go to school, you want to go someplace that has a strong reputation for excellence and a track record for solid job placement,” says Harper. “You want a school that graduates students who are prepared to be interior designers! Likewise, a strong alumni network will help you when graduation nears. Alumni are a great first connection to industry and can often help support you in finding the first position.”\n\nWhile exploring design schools, consult a current list of the best interior design schools and seek out degree programs that are accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA), as the organization is most informed of current trends, regulations, and industry practices. According to the CIDA, “[Its] accreditation process is thorough and focused solely on interior design programs that culminate in a professional-level degree. Interior design programs that voluntarily undertake the CIDA accreditation process demonstrate a strong commitment to quality and continual improvement.”\n\nIt should also be noted that a wealth of US colleges and universities that are not exclusively “design schools” boast noteworthy programs in interior design—namely, the School of Architecture and Interior Design (SAID) at University of Cincinnati, the Design School at Arizona University, Drexel University in Philadelphia, Auburn University in Alabama, and Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Since all of these diverse design schools, colleges, and universities vary in terms of location, demographics, class size, and area of focus, among other characteristics, it’s worth it to spend the time to rigorously investigate—and visit—schools before applying or accepting admission.\n\nMake an appointment with a faculty member at the schools you are most interested in to evaluate whether or not a program is right for you. Ask specific questions about the types of classes offered, the teaching philosophy of the interior design program, what percentage of graduates actually pursue interior design careers, and what types of jobs they have landed. Top design schools have a stellar record for post-grad job placement.\n\nFor example, SCAD reports a 99% rate of employment in the interior design industry, pursuing further education in the field, or both within 10 months of graduation. Similarly, NYSID touts a 95% job placement rate in the interior design industry for undergraduates and a 98% rate for graduate students.\n\nHow to get a leg up in the interior design industry\n\nWhen starting out in the interior design field, no matter how talented and ambitious you are, there are many others—hundreds, in fact—vying for a select number of design jobs. So the key is to distinguish yourself from the competition. Seize the advantage of being at a design school or university with talented, knowledgeable interior design staff. Maximize any and all prospects for networking, mentorships, and internships/work experience. As a teacher once told me, “Make your breaks.” It still resonates.\n\nRely on the expertise of career counselors to help you secure an internship that coincides with your areas of interest, but also keep an open mind to different aspects of the industry. You never know—you might think you want to focus on retail design as an 18-year-old high school graduate, but then hospitality could end up piquing your curiosity. It’s beneficial to have a broad base of experience before ruling out any possibilities.\n\nEstablishing relationships with design school faculty will prove instrumental in your career advancement. Let them know you’re looking to be mentored, and listen to the advice they give based on their life experiences. Leverage their contacts to meet people in the design industry when you can: Opportunities for learning abound in this type of educational setting.\n\nHeadley says she always encourages students to utilize every resource available to them at their school, whether it is extra help sessions, workshops, or tutoring services. “Internships are not always required as part of the course curriculum, but students should seek these out regardless as a way to gain valuable experience before graduating so that they can stand out as a stellar candidate as they apply for jobs,” she notes.\n\nIn this virtual workshop, AD100 designer Nicole Hollis and studio CEO Lewis Heathcote share financial advice for building a strong foundation for an interior business to scale and sustain\n\nAttaining an internship while still in school allows you to gain experience in a practical setting, and it helps position you for success post-graduation. Internships expose you to different types of work environments and not only build your resume but also help you in figuring out if this is the type of work you can see yourself doing in the future. It’s a great opportunity to test things out—experiment with a different firm type, practice size, or city.\n\nIn terms of being mentored, Moody advises not to force it. “It’s like any other good relationship; it’s got to have the right fit,” she says. “What’s essential in a mentor-mentee relationship is mutual respect. You want to find someone who will (gently) push you out of your comfort zone so you’ll enlarge your thoughts and skills base. Also, that person needs to allow you to figure things out for yourself—acting as a guide.”\n\nJoining an industry association—like International Interior Design Association (IIDA), American Society of Interior Designers (ASID), and National Organization of Minority Architects (NOMA)—in this early stage of your design career, likewise, can prove valuable. Associations offer a glimpse into the profession and opportunities for meeting practicing interior designers, who can share their experiences and expertise with you.\n\n“Any opportunity to learn from someone else's experiences—whether that be successes or mistakes—is invaluable. So joining a community of designers who are willing to share their knowledge, experience, and resources can be career-boosting,” Lomanto offers. “Get in touch with the leadership of a local chapter [of an organization like ASID] to find out more and attend an event or two before making your decision to join. Different organizations have different strengths.”\n\nGet certified\n\nAt the moment, all US states—except for California—plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all Canadian provinces have some level of legislation to require interior design licensure. NCIDQ is the most common interior design certification, recognized in the United States and Canada as a benchmark for proficiency in the profession. To qualify to sit for the NCIDQ exam, you must first earn an associate’s, bachelor’s, or master’s degree and complete a certain number of hours of work experience (depending on the level of education). The work experience requirements changed as of February 1, 2024, so be sure you have what it takes before scheduling to take the test.\n\nComprising three parts—the Interior Design Fundamentals Exam (IDFX), a computerized multiple choice test; the Interior Design Professional Exam (IDPX), a computerized multiple choice test; and the practicum, a computerized interactive test—the NCIDQ exam covers subjects such as construction standards, design application, building codes, project coordination, contract administration, life safety and universal design, and professional development and ethics.\n\nYou may take the first part—the IDFX—once you’ve graduated from design school and meet the educational requirements or are in the last year of a bachelor’s or master’s degree of an interior design program, even if you have not yet completed work experience. The IDPX, meanwhile, is available to you once you’ve completed both your education and work requirements, and the practicum is the final exam. Fees for each part of the exam are paid separately.\n\nWhile this three-part test may sound grueling, you should have learned all the necessary information through schooling and practical experience to fare well enough to pass and obtain your NCIDQ credentials: You need a score of at least 500 out of 800 to pass. This is certification that’s definitely worth having—even if it’s not required by your home state (California)—as it legitimizes your skill set and experience to clients and employers.\n\nPerfect your interior design skill set\n\nBeing an interior designer is not just about having design savvy and a vision to create beautiful, functional spaces. There’s a great amount of skill behind every keen designer’s eye.\n\n“Many people think that interior design is simple—it's not,” stresses Lomanto. “It's a very complex, detail-driven industry that requires technical knowledge to get it right.”\n\nOrganizational skills, time management, project management, problem solving, and communication skills are all prerequisites for the job, as is some very specific technical knowledge. While mastery of drawing and perspective are fundamental for every interior designer, computer-aided design now is as well. CAD technology—in the form of design software such as Autodesk AutoCAD, CorelCAD, SmartDraw, ARCHICAD, DraftSight, and CAD Pro, among others—allows you to render your design ideas in 2D and 3D models with proper dimensions, colors, texture, and other design details.\n\nFrom room design to project management, here are the interior design apps and programs to elevate your design business\n\nIn addition to CAD, other computer software that today’s interior designers are expected to know include SketchUp, a basic 3D-modeling computer program; Autodesk 3Ds Max with its easy-to-learn interface for 3D rendering and simulating interiors; Autodesk Revit, which is highly technical in nature and created specifically for A&D professionals for Building Information Modeling (BIM) to allow users to quickly make elevations, sections, floor plans, and design plans; and Infurnia, a feature-rich, complex interior design program.\n\nAnd now budding interior designers also must consider the role AI plays in the industry. There’s no need to fear artificial intelligence—computers are not going to take over designers’ jobs. Instead, strategically leveraging AI technology can only enhance an interior designer’s capabilities.\n\n“Currently, we are seeing AI used as part of ideation,” explains NYSID’s Harper. “An interior designer can type a prompt and/or input an image, and AI can quickly create multiple iterations based on those inputs. It’s helping to spur on the creative process and unleashing creative potential for designers. Likewise, most software being used by interior designers now has some AI component to it…everything from generating text to suggesting layouts to creating options for layouts—and more.”\n\nMost software applications interior designers use today have some integrated AI component, such as Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk products. “Because there are so many products on the market, it’s good to start to tinker with those to have a sense of what the potential is,” Harper notes. “Then, once you know a bit about the breadth of options, you can begin to think about how you might use it, and from there you can narrow down to the best tool for a specific task or application of AI.”\n\nHarper mentions that at NYSID they are beginning to fold in many new AI tools, “primarily those that are part of the existing software we use: Adobe products, Autodesk products, and ChatGPT.” Popular AI tools like DALLE, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion as platforms can generate and edit images. Other interior design AI tools like REimagineHome, ZMO.AI, and Fy!AI Interior Designer can take an image of a project uploaded by an interior designer and allow for space planning, virtual staging, remodeling, and testing out how various designs, styles, furnishings, materials, and patterns might look in a space in real time.\n\nAn interior design professional who is well-versed in a range of design software tools as well as familiar with newer AI platforms will have a definite advantage over designers who have been in the profession for decades and have failed to remain current.\n\nHouston-based luxury interior designer Nina Magon says that being a successful interior designer is a synthesis of the obvious skills like creativity and technical knowledge, plus more. “An essential yet often overlooked skill for an interior designer is adaptability. The design process is dynamic and fluid, requiring the ability to pivot and adjust to unforeseen challenges and changes,” she explains, adding, “Another crucial skill is the ability to collaborate effectively with a diverse range of professionals, including architects, contractors, and artisans. This collaboration ensures that the design vision is executed flawlessly. Attention to detail and a deep understanding of materials and their applications also play significant roles in bringing a design to life with precision and excellence.”\n\nShow, don’t tell\n\nAnyone who wants to become an interior designer needs to display an impressive interior design portfolio. Perhaps as a new designer, you don’t have examples of formal, paid design work. Don’t fret. Student work, internship experiences, non-client design projects, self-initiated work, and side projects are all viable illustrations of your design process and capabilities.\n\nNYSID president David Sprouls says that of all the many design portfolios he sees, the ones that stand out demonstrate design thinking—evidence that designers understand the process. Similarly, Reynolds explains, “When reviewing portfolios, our firm is more focused on the design concepts and color palettes rather than technical skills. We are looking for creative solutions and thoughtful color placement rather than scale of project or overly complicated design. Honing the ideas and creating cohesive plans are major parts of what we do. Knowing how to execute this successfully is vital to standing out.”\n\nHere are a few points to keep in mind when creating your interior design portfolio:\n\nCreate an impactful first impression with visuals.\n\nShow off with design work that reflects who you are as a designer and an individual.\n\nHighlight only your best, most striking work—not a haphazard compilation of everything, but a carefully curated selection—exemplified via stunning photography and additional visuals, such as drawings and sketches.\n\nInclude concise explanations of project goals and design challenges, so readers know what they’re viewing in your portfolio.\n\nUpdate frequently as new design work warrants it.\n\nInclude your CV and contact info.\n\nPresent your best face online\n\nDefining your own brand is vital to positioning yourself as a proficient interior designer. How do you see yourself as a professional? And how do you want others to perceive you? What’s your unique value proposition? What are your goals as a designer? Who is your target audience? Pondering these questions can help you to clearly delineate your personal brand.\n\nNext, visually translate your brand identity into an interior design website and social media profile. It’s essential that your brand accurately reflects your style and sensibility as a designer, so painstakingly curate what you select to display online. For example, where applicable, employ colors, typography, and imagery that reflects your design ethos. Be consistent with brand messaging across all channels of communication—be it online, in person, via email, or phone. How you dress, act, speak, and write all should align with your personal brand. Visitors to your website should have an immediate sense of who you are as a designer, and your skills and accomplishments should speak loud and clear. This is no time to be humble. Showcase who you are, and put your best foot forward.\n\nAPPLY NOW\n\nGrow your business in 2024 with the AD PRO Directory\n\nArrow\n\nEstablish an online presence that permeates all social media channels. Become a social networker online. Maintain a consistent brand message throughout LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, and Houzz. Contribute frequently to keep content fresh and on-brand. Use these social media platforms as tools to cultivate your brand, make connections, and seek employment.\n\nAD PRO also offers a supremely valuable resource with its AD PRO Directory, which connects clients with interior designers, architects, and landscape designers that have been fully vetted and fulfill the stringent standards of AD. As long as an interior designer has some work to show in their portfolio—commissioned or not—they can apply and be considered for inclusion in the AD PRO Directory. It only takes a few projects to show to be included, and being in the directory affords designers opportunities to meet new clients and further develop their network.\n\nKeep on learning\n\nBecoming stale as an interior designer quite literally can be career-ending with so many fresh, eager new designers entering the field. So after completing design school and taking the NCIDQ exam, your design education should not end. Keep your skills current, learn the newest interior design online platforms and AI tools, and maintain your competitive edge by seeking out continuing education opportunities. Sign up for business or interior design courses online. Audit a class that helps you with practical application of design theory. Take the LEED exam, and become a LEED-accredited professional for Interior Design and Construction.\n\n“Learn about sustainability and human health, and pursue credentials in these areas from rigorous certificate programs,” Lomanto advises. “The entire industry is moving toward prioritizing health, well-being, and sustainability. Don't get left behind!”\n\nAnd plan to take some continuing education units (CEUs) during the course of the year to stay abreast of current industry trends—and earning CEUs annually is also a requirement of industry organizations like AIA, ASID, IIDA, IDC, and ASLA, as well as to maintain one’s status as a certified interior designer (CID). One CEU is defined as 10 contact hours (one contact hour equals one clock hour) of participation in an organized, relevant continued education experience, which can include seminars, conferences, events, in-person programs, and classes. Detailed information on its CIDA’s website offers lists of schools and programs that meet quality standards of the interior design profession.\n\nMeet and greet as much as possible\n\nNetworking is the key to success in any profession, but especially in the highly social A&D community. In this field, networking is everything.\n\nMake connections with peers as well as professors in design school.\n\nJoin design organizations, such as IIDA and ASID.\n\nReach out to designers you know and admire, and ask for informational interviews.\n\nAttend local trade shows and industry functions.\n\nBe open to networking online, via LinkedIn, for example.\n\nTake advantage of “warm welcomes”—introductions to industry professionals from anyone you know.\n\nHeadley advocates for getting involved in an organization like the IIDA while still in school in order to develop a network very early. “Those connections can refer you to internship and job opportunities. It also is a way to gain leadership skills,” she advises. “Volunteer on committees, or hold positions (like student liaison) on the professional board. Many schools have a student chapter which allows them to gain experience in roles like president or chapter leader. Our industry has a great community, and being a part of a design organization as a student provides early access to this network.”\n\nTrade shows are another viable avenue for fostering relationships. Take advantage of educational programs and keynote speakers at these events to glean insights from top designers about recent or upcoming industry developments and innovations.\n\nOnline networking via LinkedIn can also be a valuable tool. When using this professional networking site, maximize the “About” section to offer an engaging glimpse into who you are as a professional. Don’t be afraid to celebrate achievements and awards that distinguish you from others. And be sure to frequently post relevant content and interact with posts on the main page as well as those in the industry. The more you engage, the more likely your profile will be seen.\n\nImagine the possibilities\n\nWhen applying to full-time design positions, don’t narrow your focus. Be open, cast a wide net as far as potential interior design jobs, and remain available to all opportunities. If something sounds remotely interesting to you, apply to the post. You never know the connections you’ll make by speaking with people at various design firms.\n\nArrange meetings to learn about firms and their areas of expertise. Research different interior design jobs, and become well-informed about distinct roles within a design firm so that you see which types of positions are most aligned with your background and skill set. Learn about the company culture at the firms you are targeting for employment, and pay attention when visiting workplaces for interviews. Ask yourself if you can see yourself working in this office among these colleagues. It would behoove recent grads or those looking to get started in the industry to seek junior design positions that will help develop the skills needed to grow in the profession.\n\nBottom line: Be open. Be social. Surround yourself with fellow designers. And plant yourself in the design world where you want to live in order to have a successful career as an interior designer."
