Please consult with a Penn State academic adviser on a regular basis to develop and refine an academic plan that is appropriate for you.\n\nFirst YearFallCreditsSpringCredits ENGL 15 or 30H‡†3CAS 100A‡†3 CMPSC 131*#3MATH 141*#†4 MATH 140*#†4PHYS 211*#†4 PSU 8†1CMPSC 132*#3 General Education Course†3General Education Course†3 General Education Course (GN)†3 1717 Second YearFallCreditsSpringCredits CMPEN 271*1 and CMPEN 275*1 or CMPEN 270*4CMPSC 311*23 CMPSC 221*3CMPSC 360*3 MATH 2203MATH 2304 PHYS 212*†4ENGL 202C‡†3 General Education GHW†1.5Natural Science Elective (GN, See College Note below for options that DO NOT count)†3 General Education GHW†1.5 1716 Third YearFallCreditsSpringCredits CMPEN 331*3CMPSC 473*3 CMPSC 465*3CMPSC 46423 STAT 31813STAT 31923 CMPSC 461*13General Education Course†3 World Language4General Education Course†3 1615 Fourth YearFallCreditsSpringCredits CMPSC 431W1 or CMPSC 483W23CMPEN/CMPSC 4XX3 CMPSC Elective3CMPSC Elective3 Supporting Course3Supporting Course3 Department List (General Elective)4Department List (General Elective)3 Department List (General Elective)3General Education Course†3 1615 Total Credits 129\n\nUniversity Requirements and General Education Notes:\n\nUS and IL are abbreviations used to designate courses that satisfy Cultural Diversity Requirements (United States and International Cultures).\n\nW, M, X, and Y are the suffixes at the end of a course number used to designate courses that satisfy University Writing Across the Curriculum requirement.\n\nGeneral Education includes Foundations (GWS and GQ), Knowledge Domains (GHW, GN, GA, GH, GS) and Integrative Studies (Inter-domain) requirements. N or Q (Honors) is the suffix at the end of a course number used to help identify an Inter-domain course, but the inter-domain attribute is used to fill audit requirements. Foundations courses (GWS and GQ) require a grade of 'C' or better.\n\nAll incoming Schreyer Honors College first-year students at University Park will take ENGL 137H/CAS 137H in the fall semester and ENGL 138T/CAS 138T in the spring semester. These courses carry the GWS designation and satisfy a portion of that General Education requirement. If the student’s program prescribes GWS these courses will replace both ENGL 15/ENGL 30H and CAS 100A/CAS 100B/CAS 100C. Each course is 3 credits.\n\nProgram Notes:\n\nNATURAL SCIENCES ELECTIVE: Choose any GN-designated course EXCEPT the following- ASTRO 1, 7N, 10, 11, 120, or 140; all below CHEM 110 (except 3 credits of CHEM 106); all below PHYS 211; PHYS 250 or 251; all BI SC; and GEOSC 20.\n\nCMPSC/CMPEN 400-Level: Select any 400-489 CMPSC or CMPEN course.\n\nComputer Science Elective: Select from department list. Restrictions may apply. Computer Science Electives are NOT offered every semester or even every year. Contact the department for information on which classes are scheduled to be offered during a given semester.\n\nDepartment List Elective: Select from department list. Restrictions may apply. Students who complete the ROTC Program may substitute 3 ROTC credits for a Department List Elective. Students who complete the Cooperative Education Program may substitute 3 co-op credits for a Department List Elective.\n\nHealth and Wellness: Students who complete the ROTC Program may substitute 3 ROTC credits for the GHW requirement and 3 ROTC credits for a Department List Elective.\n\nSupporting Course: Select from department list. Restrictions may apply.\n\nCareer Paths\n\nComputer science has had major impacts in such diverse areas as commerce, communication, engineering, entertainment, finance, health sciences, social sciences, physical sciences, and life sciences. Computer scientists do far more than just construct software. They apply their skills and knowledge to solve challenging problems using sound computational methods. They work collaboratively in teams to build complex systems with many integrated parts. They research, study, and develop new technologies, new applications of computing, and new ways to compute.\n\nCareers\n\nComputer science graduates typically find positions as software engineers and software developers in major companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Facebook, and Intel. Graduates are also highly recruited by major companies in the areas of finance, health care, aerospace, and defense. Most graduates will find themselves a part of a team of software developers and after a few years possibly leading a software team. With the rapid changes and advances in the field of computing, graduates must continually keep up with the latest technology as their careers adapt and evolve to meet the new opportunities and challenges of computing.\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL CAREER OPTIONS FOR GRADUATES OF THE COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAM\n\nOpportunities for Graduate Studies\n\nGraduates of this program can pursue graduate studies in computer science and related disciplines, concentrating in specialized areas such as computer security, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data sciences, computer networks, computer vision, bioinformatics, and high-performance computing. A master’s degree allows one to specialize beyond the broad foundations offered by a bachelor’s degree. A doctoral degree prepares one for a career in research and academia.\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADUATE STUDIES\n\nProfessional Resources\n\nACM\n\nAssociation of Women in Computing\n\nIEEE\n\nAccreditation\n\nThe Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at University Park, Penn State Beaver, Penn State Brandywine, and Penn State Hazleton is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org, under the commission’s General Criteria and Program Criteria for Computer Science and Similarly Named Computing Programs."
