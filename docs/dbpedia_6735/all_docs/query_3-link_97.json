N or Q (Honors) is the suffix at the end of a course number used to help identify an Inter-domain course, but the inter-domain attribute is used to fill audit requirements. Foundations courses (GWS and GQ) require a grade of 'C' or better.\n\nAll incoming Schreyer Honors College first-year students at University Park will take ENGL 137H/CAS 137H in the fall semester and ENGL 138T/CAS 138T in the spring semester. These courses carry the GWS designation and satisfy a portion of that General Education requirement. If the studentâ€™s program prescribes GWS these courses will replace both ENGL 15/ENGL 30H and CAS 100A/CAS 100B/CAS 100C. Each course is 3 credits.\n\nProgram Notes:\n\nNATURAL SCIENCES ELECTIVE: Choose any GN-designated course EXCEPT the following- ASTRO 1, 7N, 10, 11, 120, or 140; all below CHEM 110 (except 3 credits of CHEM 106); all below PHYS 211; PHYS 250 or 251; all BI SC; and GEOSC 20.\n\nCMPSC/CMPEN 400-Level: Select any 400-489 CMPSC or CMPEN course.\n\nComputer Science Elective: Select from department list.

Computer scientists do far more than just construct software. They apply their skills and knowledge to solve challenging problems using sound computational methods. They work collaboratively in teams to build complex systems with many integrated parts. They research, study, and develop new technologies, new applications of computing, and new ways to compute.\n\nCareers\n\nComputer science graduates typically find positions as software engineers and software developers in major companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Facebook, and Intel. Graduates are also highly recruited by major companies in the areas of finance, health care, aerospace, and defense. Most graduates will find themselves a part of a team of software developers and after a few years possibly leading a software team. With the rapid changes and advances in the field of computing, graduates must continually keep up with the latest technology as their careers adapt and evolve to meet the new opportunities and challenges of computing.\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL CAREER OPTIONS FOR GRADUATES OF THE COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAM\n\nOpportunities for Graduate Studies\n\nGraduates of this program can pursue graduate studies in computer science and related disciplines, concentrating in specialized areas such as computer security, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data sciences, computer networks, computer vision, bioinformatics, and high-performance computing. A masterâ€™s degree allows one to specialize beyond the broad foundations offered by a bachelorâ€™s degree. A doctoral degree prepares one for a career in research and academia.\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADUATE STUDIES\n\nProfessional Resources\n\nACM\n\nAssociation of Women in Computing\n\nIEEE\n\nAccreditation\n\nThe Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at University Park, Penn State Beaver, Penn State Brandywine, and Penn State Hazleton is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org, under the commissionâ€™s General Criteria and Program Criteria for Computer Science and Similarly Named Computing Programs."
