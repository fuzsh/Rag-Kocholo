        "text": "Interviews can be intimidating. Spend time preparing for your next user experience (UX) designer interview, and you can confidently walk in (or sign onto Zoom) that meeting room. A big part of preparing for an interview is reviewing common interview questions and thinking through how youâll answer them.Â\n\nThis article will cover the most common questions for a UX designer job that will allow you to stand out among the competition.\n\nCommon interview questions for a UX designer\n\nItâs impossible to enter an interview knowing exactly what questions youâll be asked. But thereâs a good chance youâll be asked some common UX interview questions. Practice answering these 12 questions to build confidence before your next interview.\n\n1. Tell us about yourself.\n\nWhat theyâre really asking: What makes you the right person for this position?\n\nThis question comes up in many interviews, UX or otherwise. It might sound like a simple get-to-know-you question, but thereâs more to it. This is your opportunity to explain your journey with UX design.Â\n\nWhat sparked your interest in UX? What experiences did you have in your previous jobs or coursework that inspired you to pursue a career in UX design?\n\nItâs okay if you donât have any previous experience working as a UX designer. Discuss what UX design skills you might have used in a different role and relate them here.\n\nThis is also an excellent time to express what excites you about the role youâre applying for and why you think youâre the best candidate for the job.\n\nOther forms this question might take:\n\nWhy are you interested in UX?\n\nHow did you get started in UX?\n\nTell me a little bit more about your background.\n\n2. What is UX design?\n\nWhat theyâre really asking: Do you understand the value of the role?\n\nWhen this type of question arises, the interviewer is likely not looking for a simple dictionary definition of user experience. Instead, they may be trying to explain your understanding of the role and how it brings value to both customers and the business.\n\nUX design is all about championing the user. Consider discussing how empathy and user-centered design create value. Also, talk about the ways in which you keep the user at the center of the design process: user research, personas and user journey maps, and usability testing.\n\nOther forms this question might take:\n\nWhy should we hire a UX designer?\n\nWhatâs the value of UX design?\n\nHow do you define UX?\n\n3. Tell me about some of your favorite examples of good UX.Â\n\nWhat theyâre really asking: Do you understand the elements of a good user experience?\n\nKnowing why good UX is important is one thing. Knowing how to design good UX is another. This question digs into your knowledge of UX best practices.Â\n\nThink of a few examples ahead of time. What elements of the product, app, or website make the user experience enjoyable? How is the design user-centric? How do you think that impacts the companyâs bottom line?\n\nOther forms this question might take:\n\nWhat does it mean to be a good UX designer?\n\nWhat are the elements of good UX?\n\nBuild your skills with real-world projects that you can add to your portfolio:\n\n4. What is the difference between UX and UI?\n\nWhat theyâre really asking: Do you understand what UX is and isnât (and how it fits into the bigger picture)?\n\nWhile UI and UX are sometimes used interchangeably (or lumped together), they represent distinct roles in the product development process. Ensure you can communicate the difference between a product looking good (UI) and work effectively and efficiently (UX).Â\n\nIf youâve worked with a UI or graphic designer before, this would be a good time to discuss collaboration and division of labor.\n\nOther forms this question might take:\n\nWhatâs the difference between a UX designer and a graphic designer?\n\nHow is UX design different from visual design?\n\nWhat sets UX apart from other design disciplines?\n\n5. Walk me through your workflow.\n\nWhat theyâre really asking: Whatâs your thought process when solving problems?\n\nThis question is all about analyzing your critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Pick a successful project youâve worked on and walk through the steps you took. Structure your answer much like the design process itself by mentioning how you researched, designed, and validated your design decisions. Avoid the temptation to answer this question in general terms.Â\n\nOther forms this question might take:\n\nWalk me through your portfolio.\n\nWhatâs your design process?\n\nTell me about a project that challenged you. How did you work through the challenge?\n\n6. What kind of research methods do you use?\n\nWhat theyâre really asking: How do you validate your design decisions?\n\nUser research is a key part of the UX design process, so interviewers sometimes want to gauge your familiarity with the process and methods.\n\nYou can approach this question in a couple of ways. Be sure to walk through any user research methods youâve used in the past (this can include the research you conducted as part of a course or degree project). Talk about the benefits and limitations of each method.\n\nIf you have limited experience in UX design, you can also frame your answer in terms of research methods youâd like to try and why.Â\n\nOther forms this question might take:\n\nHave you conducted user research in the past?\n\nHow do you decide which research method to use?\n\nThis course from the University of Michigan is another popular option for switching to UX design:\n\n7. How do you respond to negative feedback?Â\n\nWhat theyâre really asking: Are you a team player?\n\nPart of the interview process involves figuring out what youâre like to work with. Can you work collaboratively? Are you able to incorporate different ideas and viewpoints into your designs? Do you trust your team members with your work?Â\n\nUX design is a highly collaborative process. Take this opportunity to talk about successful collaboration. This could be a group project or a team effort in a previous job. No matter the example you choose, remember to point out the role you played in the group, how you overcame any challenges, what you learned from your teammates, and how the finished product benefitted from the collaboration.\n\nOther forms this question might take:\n\nDo you work well as part of a team?\n\nDescribe your ideal work environment.\n\nHow do you hand over your designs to developers?\n\n8. Tell me about your most/least successful UX design project.\n\nWhat theyâre really asking: What are your biggest strengths or weaknesses?\n\nGetting asked about the design project youâre most proud of is your chance to showcase your strengths. Outline your contributions to the project, then go into a little more detail about what made it so successful. As you prepare for this question, see if you can tie in some of the qualities listed in the job description for the role.\n\nThe negative version of the question is another way to ask you about your weaknesses. Be honest, but focus on what you learned from the not-so-successful project and what youâd do differently in the future.Â\n\nNo matter which version of the question you get, take it as an opportunity to define how you measure success (hint: tie it to the user).\n\nOther forms this question might take:\n\nWalk me through your portfolio.\n\nWhat is your biggest strength/weakness as a UX designer?\n\nTell me about a design problem that challenged you.\n\n9. How would you improve the UX of our product?\n\nWhat theyâre really asking: Have you done your research?\n\nReading up on the company youâre applying to before your interview is always a good idea. This demonstrates your interest in this company and this role as opposed to any other UX designer job.Â\n\nTake some time to explore the companyâs products. Browse their website. Use their app if they have one.Â\n\nThink about what works and what could be improved. Pick one or two examples, and devise a sample plan of action. Remember to mention the companyâs target users and the type of research you might conduct when enhancing an existing design.\n\nThe point here isnât to bash your potential employer but to offer a preview of the value youâd bring to the company.Â\n\nOther forms this question might take:\n\nTell me about a bad user experience youâve had. How would you fix it?\n\n10. Where do you find inspiration?\n\nWhat theyâre really asking: Are you passionate about UX design? Are you a lifelong learner?\n\nInterviewers generally look for a couple of things when they ask a question like this. First, they want to know that youâre genuinely interested in the industry. Second, they want to know youâre staying on top of trends. Third, they want to see that youâre always looking for ways to learn and improve.\n\nThereâs no right or wrong answer here.Â\n\nYou could discuss a design book youâve read recently, pointing out a tip or two you gleaned from it. You could talk about a UX podcast you listen to or a trend you read about in a design blog. How could that trend contribute to this companyâs success? Maybe thereâs a UX designer you follow on Twitter who always inspires you with new ideas.\n\nIf youâre not regularly consuming UX design media, nowâs the time to start. Hereâs a list of UX books, blogs, and podcasts to get you going.\n\nOther forms this question might take:\n\nWhat do you think is the next big trend in UX design?\n\nWhat inspires you?\n\nWhat inspires your work?\n\n11. Do you have any questions?\n\nWhat theyâre really asking: Are you engaged and curious?\n\nThis question closes out many interviews, and itâs important that you come prepared with your own thoughtful questions. The main point of an interview is for a company to determine whether youâre a good fit for a role. But that goes both ways. This is your chance to explore whether the company is a good fit for you.Â\n\nDemonstrate your interest in the company and the job by asking two or three questions. You can prepare some questions ahead of time, but donât be afraid to ask questions that may have come up during the interview process. Topics to inquire about might include the company culture, team structure, and business goals.\n\n12. The Whiteboard Challenge\n\nWhat theyâre really asking: How do you perform under pressure? Can you back up the skills listed on your resume?\n\nMany UX designer interviews include a hands-on design challenge. Sometimes this is a take-home project that you turn in later. More commonly, itâs a whiteboard challenge, where youâre asked to design a solution on the spot while talking through your process.\n\nThis can be intimidating, but keep in mind that itâs more about seeing your process in action than the final result. Break this down into a few steps:\n\nAsk questions to clarify what the challenge entails. What are the expected outcomes? What factors should you consider?\n\nAsk more questions to help you build a user persona.\n\nCreate a user story. Outline what the user would need to solve their problem and the steps they might take.\n\nDraw a few critical wireframes on the whiteboard. Explain what youâre including and why.Â\n\nDiscuss some alternatives or other use cases.\n\nRespond to any feedback with improvements.\n\n7. Ask if thereâs anything else you should iterate on.\n\nHere are a few sample challenges to practice with:\n\nDesign a child-friendly app for a store that makes custom teddy bears.\n\nDesign a mobile app to help singles safely find a roommate in a big city.\n\nRe-design a popular dating app to make it more useful during the pandemic.\n\nDesign something from the Designercize prompt generator.\n\nPrepare for your UX design career\n\nKeep pursuing your UX design path with top-rated courses from Coursera:\n\nTo prepare for interviews, explore the University of Maryland's Successful Interviewing course. Learn how to answer traditional interview questions and demonstrate you've got what it takes to thrive in a UX design role.\n\nTo sharpen your interview techniques, try our one-hour guided project Accomplishment STAR Techniques for Job Interviews.
