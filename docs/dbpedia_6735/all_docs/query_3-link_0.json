        "text": "Drawings and Documents\n\nThe compact and modular design of the ProScan® III system is capable of controlling up to 16 individual stepper motor axes including; a motorized stage, focus motor, three filter wheels and three shutters with the speed, accuracy and precision required by today’s highly automated and demanding applications. Communication to the controller has been improved, as FTDI USB connection is now available making the unit compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac. Four programmable TTL inputs and outputs allow the unit peripherals or external cameras to be controlled via TTL. The advanced internal software allows for simple control of all accessories via Prior’s new Interactive Control Center (ICC) Joystick, RS232 or USB, and a SDK is supplied for easy integration into third party software. Access to acceleration, speed and even drive current is also made available for more advanced users to allow total customization of the unit.\n\nProScan® III provides a modular approach to minimize the footprint of the controller. The cubic design provides stylish looks with a footprint of only 177x177mm. The base unit is designed to accommodate a three axis system, e.g., a stage and focus. Additional functionality can be added to the unit via modular sections which allow for easy expansion. The ancillary box (as shown in the image to the right) accommodates any extra functionality required, e.g., three filter wheels and three shutters.\n\nAccessories can be controlled in either the main cube or the ancillary boxes, providing a system which is totally configurable. ProScan® III can be expanded horizontally or vertically to accommodate increased functionality, easing the pressure on the limited space in modern labs.\n\nA ‘V’ prefix indicates that the unit is expanded vertically – for instance, an ancillary box is added atop the main control unit. A ‘H’ prefix indicates that the unit is intended to be expanded horizontally, so the ancillary box would be added to the side of the main control unit. Note that customized units and individual boards can also be available.\n\nNumber of Axis Up to 16 Speed Range 0 – 70rps, ultra smooth low speed motion Communications 1 x USB 2.0, 2 x RS232 (up to 115K Baud) TTL Communications 4 input /output programmable TTL connections Power Requirements 150W Max Voltage 38 Volts Dimensions 177mm x 177mm x 177mm\n\nDue to the versatility of the ProScan III control system, a number of different units are available, ensuring that the customer can select exactly the right control system for their application. We strongly recommend that ProScan controllers are used to control Prior equipment.\n\nA ‘V’ prefix indicates that the unit is expanded vertically – for instance, an ancillary box is added atop the main control unit. A ‘H’ prefix indicates that the unit is intended to be expanded horizontally, so the ancillary box would be added to the side of the main control unit. Note that customized units and individual boards can also be available. Other than that there is no functional difference.\n\n‘XYZE’ indicates that the controller is capable of controlling an encoded or unencoded XY stage and a Z motor.\n\n‘F’ indicates that it has the capability to control shutters and filter wheels, and/or other Prior equipment which uses these ports.\n\nA ‘VLDXYZ’ or ‘HLDXYZF’ indicates that it controls a linear, rather than a standard stepper, motorized stage."
