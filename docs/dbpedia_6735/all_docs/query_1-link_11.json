        "text": "Scholarly Works: For scientific and technical documents, peer review provides a level of quality control that is internationally recognized by the scientific community. ICs should have in place—in writing—their own internal review procedures for scientific publications completed in the normal course of professional responsibilities, such as contributions submitted to peer-review professional scientific and medical journals. Statistical compendia and data, as well as documents that provide influential scientific, financial, or statistical information should be reviewed carefully. In general, employees who write or contribute to an original, scholarly abstract, article, report, textbook chapter, monograph, proceedings or statistical compendium, or who otherwise contribute to a technical and scientific publication must consult with their supervisor and appropriate internal leadership, including the IC ethics official, for applicable guidance, including guidance addressing approvals and limitations concerning titles and named NIH affiliations. (See Section A.1. for further guidance concerning Federal Information Quality Guidelines.)\n\nSpeeches: Routine presentations are not subject to clearance unless specified by the employee’s IC and/or directed by their supervisor. Routine presentations include traditional scientific presentations; routine presentations developed for informational purposes; training materials and presentations; presentations describing grant application procedures and management procedures; and presentations publicizing priority areas for the purpose of soliciting grant applications. Presentations that discuss Federal policies or legislation or that may have policy or legislative implications require IC clearance. Additionally, employees should consult their supervisor and/or ethics officer for guidance on clearance of any speech or presentation which may imply agency endorsement. Individual ICs may implement their own written practices and procedures, or additional practices and procedures, for IC clearance of materials prior to dissemination. (See 5. Outside Activities, below.)\n\nPress Inquiries: Except when prohibited by Institute, Center, or Department policy, a NIH employee may respond to questions and requests for information from any source, including the news media. (Examples of prohibitions include discussions of pending legislation and acknowledgement of or comment on pending or unfunded grant applications.) Similarly, an employee may appear as a member of a discussion panel or seminar and on radio and television broadcasts without prior approval if the appearance does not require a manuscript or written text or statement and is in keeping with established NIH policies for responsible presentation of information. Speakers should limit their statements and responses to subjects within their field of expertise and should present only official HHS and NIH positions in discussion of policy matters. For news media interviews, responses or appearances, employees are encouraged to take advantage of advice and assistance with scheduling and coordination from their IC communications office. Such advice and assistance offers the additional benefits of helping to ensure that information and messages released to the public are clear and consistent and that other agencies with similar concerns may be informed as appropriate. In addition, professional communicators at the NIH can advise scientists on speaking with a clear and consistent voice, incorporating plain language, and achieving additional goals. For additional guidance, contact the NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison or equivalent office at your IC. Note that in many instances, as part of the establishment of internal practices, policies, and procedures, ICs may be provided with some discretion in the development of notification processes concerning the scheduling and completion of news interviews and appearances.\n\nAdministrative materials: Materials intended principally for use within HHS are exempt unless they:\n\nInclude 500 or more copies intended for wide distribution beyond HHS;\n\nWill be distributed to Members of Congress, regardless of the number of copies produced; or\n\nAre suggested for sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) or other Federal authorities.\n\nOutside Activities: Not covered by this chapter are works by employees engaged in writing, presenting, or otherwise disseminating information in their personal capacities. Activities designated as outside activities must be carried out in the employee’s personal capacity. Outside activities are governed, however, by the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (5 CFR 2635), by the HHS Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct (5 CFR 5501, 5502), and NIH policies and procedures. Employees writing, presenting or otherwise distributing materials as an outside activity may be asked to consult their agency ethics office for applicable rules and restrictions, including those requiring prior approval and limiting the use of their NIH title or affiliation.\n\nIntranet-based Materials: Materials intended principally for use within the NIH through the agency’s Intranet are exempt.\n\nPropriety, Accuracy, and Quality: All products and materials must be of high quality (i.e., be produced with objectivity, utility, and integrity) and accurate, both in specific details and in general. They should demonstrate the highest professional and ethical standards, as well as generally accepted standards of good taste. General principles governing the conduct of good science, including data management, publication practices, and authorship can be found in \"Guidelines for the Conduct of Research in the Intramural Research Programs at NIH.”\n\nSufficient Detail for Reproducibility: The NIH supports and encourages the timely release and public sharing of final data from NIH-supported studies for use by other researchers and others whenever feasible. When appropriate, supporting data should have full, accurate, transparent documentation. Investigators should retain research data long enough to allow others to repeat and analyze the studies. At a minimum, data must be retained consistent with applicable record retention requirements. Publication of the data and methods in peer-reviewed journals or making data available through data archives are two accepted mechanisms for making results available. Refer to NIH Manual 1743 \"Keeping and Destroying Records” for further guidance.\n\nDisclaimers: Normally, the need for a disclaimer in relation to official materials, presentations, or publications is eliminated through the clearance process. However, a disclaimer may still be needed even after official clearance to make clear that the presentation should not be construed as necessarily representing the official viewpoint and opinion of NIH. Where appropriate, potential error sources affecting the quality of the data should be identified and disclosed. (See Section G, Disclaimers.)\n\nNIH Logo and Trademark: Any use of HHS, NIH, IC or other subdivisions names, logos, marks, etc., must be consistent with the provisions of NIH Manual 1186, “Use of NIH Names and Logos,” which outlines NIH policy and procedures for the review and approval of materials that bear the agency mark (i.e., logos and/or agency names, as well as the logos of any of programs).\n\nPhotos, Images, and Graphics: In developing and distributing health, medical, and scientific information, NIH must protect the rights of individuals and organizations who hold rights to original visual and audio material. NIH staff and contractors are responsible for fully researching the origins of such materials and, if they intend to use them, obtaining permission or a license with a scope that is broad enough to cover any anticipated use. Creating new graphics and images may ultimately represent a more expeditious and prudent path. Unless NIH explicitly owns an image or audiovisual file, agency rights may be limited. In addition, organizations or institutions granting permission to use their images or electronic files may do so for an express and limited purpose. For additional guidance, contact your IC communications office or the NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison. Comprehensive guidance concerning photos, graphics, video clips, and audio files on the web, in publications, training materials or other public resources is available on the NIH Intranet. (See also Section I.3. Copyrights and Electronic Access.)\n\nIC Staff: Products and materials related to official duty and prepared at the IC level by IC staff must be approved by the Director (or designee) of the employee's IC or as otherwise instructed.\n\nAssociate Director: Products and materials related to official duty and prepared at the Associate Director level must be cleared by the IC Director or his or her designee (e.g., Scientific Director or Laboratory or Branch Chief) or as otherwise instructed.\n\nBelow the Associate Director: Products and materials related to official duty and prepared below the Associate Director level must be approved by the IC Director or designee (e.g., Scientific Director or Laboratory or Branch Chief) or as otherwise instructed.\n\nJoint Authorship: In the case of joint authorship, each author must receive approval from his or her respective IC Director or designee, unless IC internal policies direct otherwise.\n\nNIH Office of the Director: IC-produced materials requiring clearance from the Office of the Director, NIH, must be approved by a designated officer and by the author's supervisor prior to submission to the Office of the Director, NIH or as otherwise instructed. Offices in the Office of the Director should establish clearance procedures in writing and adhere to the same principles of opinion, policy issues, legal issues, or conflict of interest concerns as within agency ICs. For materials that would raise concern about any of these issues, including items that are currently controversial in the press (i.e., in the news or covered by a media outlet), seek advice and assistance from your IC communications office or the NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison. Such support has the additional benefit of helping to ensure that information and messages released to the public are clear and consistent and that other agencies with similar concerns may be kept informed as appropriate. This is especially important in instances where materials surrounding the outbreak of an infectious disease, for example, may require the involvement of a multiple agencies and officials, including clinicians, basic scientists, epidemiologists, environmental experts, Executive Branch agencies and officials, world health and other non-governmental organizations, local governments, nonprofit organizations, Congressional officials, and others, working under extreme time constraints.\n\nMultiple ICs: Materials produced within the NIH Office of the Director or within Institutes and Centers on behalf of one or more ICs shall be cleared by the directors or designees of all ICs being represented. In addition, when the subject matter of a presentation overlaps with the program of another NIH component, another Federal agency, or any non-Federal agency or private individual, the concurrence of such component, agency, or individual must be obtained by the originating office before the proposed information product or material is finalized and prepared for final production and dissemination.\n\nRole of IC Directors (or Delegates): IC information products covered by this chapter must be cleared prior to production and dissemination. IC Directors are responsible for:\n\nEstablishing and maintaining controls to ensure competent and timely clearance of materials covered;\n\nEstablishing procedures appropriate for each type of information;\n\nEnsuring that senior staff are knowledgeable about their IC’s internal clearance procedures and policies as well as those of the NIH; and\n\nMaintaining files of requests for approval and actions taken.\n\nUnless otherwise directed, individual IC Directors may determine how best to meet these requirements. (See the NIH Manual Chapter 1743, \"Keeping and Destroying Records.”)\n\nMiscellaneous Approvals: Materials and products developed that overlap with the missions and programs of additional agencies require additional clearance, as do some instances where materials and products are subject to revision because of required updates, revisions, and substantial changes, as determined in review. Existing materials should be re-cleared if they have changed substantially. Additionally, approvals and clearance may be required for reprints and new editions and/or revisions of existing publications or audiovisuals. (See Section J, Production, and Section F.14, HHS Clearance, for further guidance.)\n\nIntramural Products and Materials:\n\nUnder established internal procedures, materials produced by Intramural scientists are generally reviewed and approved by Lab/Branch Chiefs and/or Scientific Directors;\n\nThe Intramural approval process helps to assure that applicable animal, human subjects, or technology transfer issues have been considered, that major press and policy implications are noted, and that supervisory scientific staff find the work to be of merit; and\n\nIn the case of materials having broad public or policy implications, the lab chief or scientific director will inform IC communications and policy offices respectively and if appropriate, additional IC leadership. (See Intramural Research Sourcebook and 12, Policy Materials, below.)\n\nFellows and Students: NIH fellows and students must follow publication review rules set by NIH and his or her IC. Ordinarily publications related to work done at NIH and with NIH resources are in the public domain. Fellows and students may not personally profit from any publication associated with his or her official duties at NIH and shall work in close consultation with their supervisor and ethics official to ensure that all relevant Federal guidelines and policies concerning their work are met.\n\nExtramural Program Staff: Written presentations by extramural scientists or scientific planning staff within IC offices of the director will be reviewed and approved according to applicable policies established by their IC, as well as any applicable policies issued by the Office of Extramural Research. (See Section H, NIH Staff (Co-) Authorship of Publications from NIH Extramural Awards.)\n\nPolicy Materials: Information prepared for dissemination by an employee that includes any discussion of Federal policy, has policy implications, may diverge from or otherwise discuss Federal laws and statutes, including pending legislation, or makes public health practice recommendations must be cleared by the NIH Office of the Director as instructed by the NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL).\n\nAppeals: An employee whose presentation or material has been disapproved may ask for a review of the decision. The Deputy Director for Extramural Research, NIH, reviews requests by Extramural staff. The Deputy Director for Intramural Research, NIH, reviews requests by Intramural staff. The Director, NIH, has responsibility for reviewing all other publication or presentations under appeal.\n\nHHS Clearance: In 2014, the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (ASPA) introduced the Strategic Communications Planning (SCP) platform, a Web-based application for the planning and review of HHS communications products. It replaces the ASPA clearance process that required HHS forms 615 and 524A. The SCP approach is intended to help ensure communication products 1) align with Executive Branch priorities; 2) have well-defined target audience(s); and 3) have clear goals and measurable outcomes. It allows for sharing and comparing strategies and outcomes, facilitating collaboration among agencies/offices; expediting review; and tracking progress. NIH staff and contractors should know that certain newsworthy, controversial, and high-priority informational products, news items, and education and awareness materials have been designated as subject to HHS review utilizing the SCP platform. Controversies can emerge from the release of informational materials that may be construed as (a) diverging from existing, applicable Federal laws, policies, and programs; (b) being linked to broad Executive Branch programmatic goals and initiatives; or (c) potentially representing duplication of effort. HHS has responsibility for reviewing, approving, and clearing such materials. ICs should begin the clearance process for materials and products that may be subject to SCP review by following existing NIH communications clearance procedures. For Office of the Director offices, materials and products should be cleared through the NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison, 1 Center Drive, Room 344, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-0188, 301-496-4461.\n\nSerial Publications: Serial publications, such as recurring newsletters, magazines, and bulletins, may be subject to 44 USC 1108, which prescribes the policies and procedures for funding Government periodicals. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget maintains responsibility for approving the preparation and release of periodicals. New submissions should be cleared through existing IC clearance procedures or as otherwise directed. Approval by the NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison may not be required for established periodicals, but ICs are encouraged to ensure that each issue fulfills the objectives originally set for the periodical and confirms to the standards set for in this chapter.\n\nSubstantially Changed Materials: Revisions to existing products and materials may not require HHS review through the SCP unless significantly changed, as determined through review. ICs should begin the clearance process utilizing existing communications clearance procedures. For additional guidance, contact the NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison.\n\nContracts Exceeding $5,000: HHS has responsibility for clearing contracted information programs exceeding $5,000. ICs should begin the clearance process using existing NIH communications procedures."
