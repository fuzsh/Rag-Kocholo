        "text": "Live Science is one of the biggest and most trusted popular science websites operating today, reporting on the latest discoveries, groundbreaking research and fascinating breakthroughs that impact you and the wider world.\n\nWe believe that science can help explain the things that matter to you and shine a light on everything from the mysteries of our universe to the inner workings of an atom. Our team of experienced editors and science journalists are here to guide you through the most important stories with clarity, authority and humor.\n\nWhether you’re interested in dinosaurs or archaeology, weird physics or astronomy, health, human behavior or the mysteries of our planet — for those with a curious mind, your journey of discovery begins here.\n\nOur mission\n\nOur goal is to make the wonders of science and the world around us relevant, useful and interesting to everyone by informing and entertaining our readers.\n\nWhen looking for the most fascinating and important stories, our staff dig through scientific journals and keep up to date with what the top institutions are working on, to investigate how science impacts current events and how new discoveries may affect you. We don’t just take scientists’ findings at face value, however — we investigate whole papers, scrutinize the results and speak to experts in the field to separate the science from the fiction. Read more about our editorial standards and how we write our articles.\n\nWhen we aren’t covering the latest science news, you can find us delivering in-depth features, such as the wildest conspiracy theories to the most inspiring Black scientists in past and modern history; holding a microscope to some of the oddest questions in Life’s Little Mysteries; or testing the toys, games and health products we think our readers will enjoy. Find out how we test, and why you can trust our reviews.\n\nIf you would like to pitch stories to Live Science, please read our submission guidelines first.\n\nOur history\n\nLive Science launched in 2004 with just three team members, as a complement to the space and astronomy news site Space.com. The site received Webby Awards as an Honoree in the Science category in 2008 and 2010. It was acquired by TechMediaNetwork, later called Purch, in 2009. Future PLC acquired Purch in 2018 and is the current publisher of Live Science, operating out of New York City, London and Bath, England.\n\nWho we are\n\nLive Science\n\n130 W. 42nd Street,\n\n7th Floor\n\nNew York, NY 10036\n\nPhone: +1 (212) 378-0400\n\nIf you have any questions, concerns or feedback regarding the site, please feel free to contact us at: community@livescience.com.\n\nTo receive amazing science news straight to your inbox, sign up for the Live Science newsletter.\n\nAdvertise with us\n\nWeb notifications\n\nLicensing and Reprints\n\nJob Openings\n\nAbout Future PLC\n\nAffiliate & advertising disclosure\n\nWe always aim to provide unbiased editorial created by our journalists and writers.
