These volumes illuminate encounters between the Russians and their favorite texts, a centuries-long and continent-spanning \"love story\" that shaped the way people think, feel, and communicate. The fruit of thirty-one specialists’ research, Reading Russia represents the first attempt to systematically depict the evolution of reading in Russia from the eighteenth century to the present day. The third volume of \"Reading Russia\" considers more recent (and rapid) changes to reading, and focuses on two profoundly transformative moments: the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, and the digital revolution of the 1990s. This volume investigates how the political transformations of the early twentieth century and the technological ones from the turn of the twenty-first impacted the tastes, habits, and reading practices of the Russian public. It closely observes how Russian readers adapted to and/or resisted their eras’ paradigm-shifting crises in communication and interpretation.\n\nScholars of Russian culture have always paid close attention to texts and their authors, but they have often forgotten about the readers. These volumes illuminate encounters between the Russians and their favorite texts, a centuries-long and continent-spanning &quot;love story&quot; that shaped the way people think, feel, and communicate. The fruit of thirty-one specialists&#39; research, Reading Russia represents the first attempt to systematically depict the evolution of reading in Russia from the eighteenth century to the present day. The second volume of Reading Russia considers the evolution of reading during the long nineteenth century (1800-1917), particularly in relation to the emergence of new narrative and current affairs publications: novels, on the one hand, and daily newspapers, weekly magazines and thick journals, on the other. The volume examines how economic and social transformations, technological progress and the development of the publishing industry taking place...\n\nThe reading culture of Russian workers in the end of the 19th - beginning of 20th cc. developed year by year to become a part of their everyday life. An important role in developing this culture was played by the zemstvos, Russian local self-governing institutions that had been established as part of the Great Reforms. Zemstvos initiated the setting up of public libraries, elementary schools, and other institutions. This article offers some observations and findings based mainly on the zemstvo publications of Vladimir province which was one of the most heavily developed textile regions in Russia. Furthermore, the zemstvo statisticians and intelligentsia used public library records in carrying out their surveys. Those surveys included data on the entire readership, but we concentrate here on the reading culture of the working class. We have also used archival sources that relate to working-class culture in Moscow province.\n\nThis is a work about the acquisition of foreign news in Russia, an attempt to determine its significance not only for government decision making but also for the cultural changes which were underway there during the seventeenth century. The core material for the study is the 'kuranty', the Russian translations from periodical newspapers and separates, most of them published in Dutch or German in the major European commercial centers. However, the Muscovite government regularly acquired foreign news from many other sources, both written and oral. Their analysis is essential too if one is to understand the importance of the kuranty. What was the institutional context within which such news was being obtained and processed? Who were the individuals involved? How accurate were the translations, and how accurate was the news? Contextualization also invites serious consideration of how the foreign news was treated and understood in Europe, where there was a communications ‘revolution’ underway. Might there not be some similarities with what was happening in Russia, at the same time that there are significant differences? Do we see here evidence of ‘influence’, or might it not be better to think of ‘creative adaptation’ within a framework of existing pragmatic solutions to the challenges of obtaining essential information? The book thus has a broad comparative aspect which should offer new insights into the cultural, intellectual, and social history of early modern Russia and contribute as well to the study of the information revolution elsewhere in Europe.\n\nThis article examines the working-class audience in Soviet Ukraine and the changes in its reading appetites during the 1920s. Under the Soviet nationalities policy of korenizatsiia introduced in 1923, the print-runs of Ukrainian-language literary products increased significantly. Nonetheless, as this article argues, those numerous publications often did not reach Ukrainian readers and if they did, they could hardly satisfy the interest appetites of an ever-growing Ukrainian audience. As the book reviews collected in the second half of the 1920s showed, the worker readers were interested in a certain type of literature – entertaining, easy to comprehend, dealing with contemporary issues and characters – that was not yet available in Ukrainian. Nevertheless, once that literature began to emerge in the late 1920s, the interest in contemporary books in Ukrainian increased. By examining every aspect of reading in Ukrainian – production, dissemination and consumption of the printed word – this article highlights the decisive role of Soviet readership in determining future official Soviet Ukrainian literature. The case of Soviet Ukraine emphasizes regional specifics and introduces an important language component to the Bolshevik reading revolution of the 1920s to early 1930s, largely ignored in the scholarship."
