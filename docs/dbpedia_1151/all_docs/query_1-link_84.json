        "text": "The cemetery was founded in 1771 during a plague epidemic. It got its name from the Vvedensky mountains (Lefortovsky hill) - an elevated area on the left bank of the Yauza.\n\nOn the northern side, the Vvedensky mountains were limited by the valley of the Khapilovka river, at the confluence of which the Yauza was located the village of Semyonovskoye. In the south, the Lefortovo brook (Sinichka) flowed, at the confluence of which with the Yauza was the village of Vvedenskoye.\n\nIn 1771, on the right bank of the Sinichka, the German cemetery was opened, now called Vvedensky. The cemetery is surrounded by a brick wall from the 19th century. The southwestern gate was erected in the 1870s according to the project of the architect A.A. Meingard. Initially, Lutherans and Catholics were buried in the cemetery, for which they called it German, or Hebrew.\n\nThe wall and cemetery buildings were erected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the 1960s, there was an increase in the territory of the cemetery, a columbarium wall was built. Many sculptural monuments and gravestones in the cemetery were erected by renowned sculptors and architects.

Lefort and P. Gordon were transferred from the German settlement (joint burial, site No. 11, on the border with sites No. 9 and No. 15).\n\nDuring the Great Patriotic War a number of mass graves of Soviet soldiers appeared at the cemetery, in memory of which a granite obelisk was erected. At the cemetery, at plot 9, 6 French pilots of the Normandie-Niemen squadron, who died in Moscow hospitals, were buried, including the Hero of the Soviet Union Marcel Lefebvre.

Reburials, in which the heads of the dead disappeared, encrypted inscriptions on monuments, Scandinavian marks and bulletproof caps for gravestones ...\n\nThe online edition of the site has launched a project in which you will learn about history, legends and state of the art metropolitan cemeteries. In the first article we are about the Novodevichy cemetery, in the second - about. Now Vvedenskoye is next in line.\n\nThe history of the Vvedensky cemetery began simultaneously with the Vagankovsky cemetery - both cemeteries were opened in 1771 during the plague epidemic. It got its name from the Vvedensky mountains (Lefortovsky hill) - an elevated area on the left bank of the Yauza. Initially, Lutherans and Catholics were buried there, for which it was called German or Hebrew.\n\nThe last shelter at the Vvedenskoye cemetery was found by confectioner Ferdinand Einem, the Ferrein family, Prishvin, Vasnetsov and actress Tatyana Peltzer. The cemetery is also famous for its Gothic monuments and the mass grave of Napoleonic soldiers.\n\n\"Vampire\"\n\nIn the depths of the cemetery, there is the mausoleum of the manufactory Ludwig Knopp, it is made in the form of a dilapidated antique portico. Once a visitor climbed inside and allegedly came across a dead hand sticking out from the ground. Since then, the crypt has been called the \"Vampire\" and is popular among the Goths. By the way, until the 1940s there was a statue of Christ. It was believed that the water flowing from his hand was healing, so pilgrims came here.\n\nThe Goths also often visit the mausoleum and leave inscriptions there: on the walls you can find the symbols of the HIM group and sayings about the meaninglessness of life.\n\nErlanger Chapel\n\nAnother pilgrimage site is the Erlanger Chapel. Maximilian Erlanger brought the first steam mill to Russia and built a bakery in Sokolniki. His tomb was built according to the project of the famous architect Fyodor Shekhtel, and inside there is a fresco by the artist Petrov-Vodkin. By the way, you cannot see her: the doors to the chapel are closed. But visitors leave their messages right on the walls: there you can find wishes for good luck and requests to get rid of addictions.\n\n\"Dead island\"\n\nOn the grave of Georg Lyon and Alexandra Rozhnova there is a panel - a copy of the painting by the artist Arnold Beklin \"Isle of the Dead\". By the way, the same panel was on the grave of Gustav Baumeister at the Smolensk cemetery in St. Petersburg.\n\nThe Vvedenskoye cemetery is remarkable not only for its old crypts and mausoleums: some famous people are buried there. For example, Ferdinand Einem, lawyer Semyon Aria (defended physicist Andrei Sakharov, journalist Alexander Minkin and oligarch Boris Berezovsky, as well as one of the defendants in the Yukos case), filmmaker Abram Room and the pharmacist Ferrein's family rest on the Vvedensky Hills.\n\nHowever, some of the graves deserve closer attention.\n\nTatiana Peltzer\n\nTatiana Peltzer died on July 16, 1992 after a heart attack and pneumonia. She was buried next to her father and brother - a design engineer, a tester of the first domestic racing car \"Zvezda-1\" Alexander Peltzer.\n\nShackled grave\n\nA modest gravestone with a monument almost at the entrance to the cemetery is the grave of Dr. Fyodor Haas, or the Good Doctor. Its difference from the others is that there are shackles on the fence, and for good reason: Gaaz worked as a prison doctor and tried to make the life of the prisoners easier. One of his innovations was the lightweight shackles that hang at his grave.\n\nLucien Olivier\n\nUntil recently, no one knew that Lucien Olivier, the owner of the famous Hermitage restaurant and the author of the salad, was buried at the Vvedenskoye cemetery. His gravestone was accidentally found during an audit of the graves in 2008. Now it has been restored and there is even a pointer to it.\n\nPiece of France\n\nIf you walk along the central alley of the cemetery past the Erlanger chapel, you can see the sign \"Normandie-Niemen\". We turn right along it and see a stele surrounded by cannons dug into the ground. This is the mass grave of Napoleon's soldiers. The land is legally French. Sometimes the French ambassador comes here and lays flowers.\n\nPlane crash victims\n\nIn the back of the cemetery, there is an unremarkable monument to the coach and three basketball players. Few people know, but they were among the victims of the 1973 plane crash in Prague. The Tu-154 plane crashed while landing, killing 66 people. This disaster is considered the first in the history of a Soviet liner.\n\nBird Sirin\n\nBuried at the Vvedenskoye cemetery famous writer Mikhail Prishvin. His tombstone by sculptor Sergei Konenkov is the Sirin bird sitting on a stone.\n\n\"Knight\"\n\nRight next to Prishvin lies the artist Viktor Vasnetsov - the author of paintings on historical and folklore subjects, for example, \"The Three Bogatyrs\", \"Ivan Tsarevich and the Gray Wolf\" and others. The tombstone is a reproduction of the painting \"The Knight at the Crossroads\": the horseman, bowing his head and spear, froze in a mute pose.\n\nKonstantin Melnikov\n\nOne of the most famous Russian architects, Konstantin Melnikov, died on November 28, 1974 from chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Urn and grave of the architect attributed to the monuments of the history of nations Russian Federation... Next to him are buried his wife Anna and son, artist Viktor Melnikov.\n\n\"Mass\" grave\n\nThe Vvedenskoye cemetery is also interesting in that almost a symbol of the 90s is buried there - members of the Orekhovskaya organized crime group. Their grave is far from the central alley, next to the columbarium.\n\nChristian Meijen\n\nOn the main alley, closer to the entrance, attention is drawn to the monument on the grave of Christian Meijen, the founder of the Komissarov technical school and a railway worker. It is a cross made up of rail strips with real wagon wheels.\n\nHistory of the Vvedensky necropolis\n\nLocated in the South-Eastern District of Moscow, in the area Lefortovo... The total area of ​​the churchyard - 20 ha... According to historical sources, the necropolis was formed in 1771, at the same time as. Vvedenskoe cemetery is sometimes called German, and this is due to the fact that Catholics and Lutherans, that is, the Gentiles, were originally buried at the churchyard. This name is also associated with the fact that the churchyard was founded near the German settlement.\n\nCelebrity graves and war graves at the Vvedenskoye cemetery\n\nMore than 50 Heroes of the Soviet Union and almost 30 Heroes of Socialist Labor found their eternal peace at the Vvedenskoye cemetery. Unknown persons who died in the battles of the Great Patriotic War are also buried here. Next to the mass graves in the cemetery there is a granite obelisk.\n\nThe necropolis also erected two memorials in memory of the French soldiers who died on the war fronts in 1941-1945. On Vvedenskoe cemetery a mass grave has also survived, in which German soldiers who had participated in the First World War were buried.\n\nScheme of the Vvedensky cemetery\n\nChapel of the Vvedensky cemetery\n\nIn 1911, on the territory of the Vvedensky churchyard, chapel, where memorial services could be conducted by representatives of different confessions. The temple still exists today.\n\nExcursion to the Vvedenskoe cemetery\n\nToday at the Vvedenskoye cemetery it is possible to carry out the following types of burials: an urn in the ground, v sarcophagus and in the open columbarium... for its installation at the Vvedenskoye cemetery can be ordered through a tender among the workshops of Moscow.\n\nAddress, how to get there, opening hours\n\nHow to get there: by bus No. 346m, by trams No. 32, 43 and 46. Stop - \"Vvedenskoye cemetery\".\n\nThis book contains stories about the people and houses of Moscow. Stories about those whom we do not know at all or know very little. In urban legends about Moscow, the author, journalist and Moscow scholar Oleg Fochkin, through his personal perception, told about the unusual places of the capital, which we pass every day and even if we notice them, we very rarely know their real fate. For several years, the stories collected by the author were published in the newspaper \"Vechernyaya Moskva\" and caused a great response from readers. In fact, this book was the result of a conversation with readers who supplemented it and suggested their travel itineraries around their hometown. German Sloboda and Petrovsky Park, Zamoskvorechye and Tverskaya, Maroseyka and Kolomenskoye ... And these are just a few names by which we have to go together and rediscover them.\n\nA series: Moscow (Ripol)\n\n* * *\n\nThe given introductory fragment of the book Urban legends (O. V. Fochkin, 2015) provided by our book partner - the company Liters.\n\nWish Fulfillment Crypt\n\nGerman (Vvedenskoe) cemetery\n\nNew Year Is not only a holiday. For most students, this is also a regular session. And although you can joke that the session is also a holiday, it is unlikely that many will agree with us.\n\nAnd when this “long-awaited” “X-hour” approaches, some students use all possible means and methods to get the coveted grades and credits.\n\nFor example, Chinese students suddenly remember the presence of the nearest Buddhist or Lamaist temples and put up whole armfuls of candles in praise of God so that he would help them on the exam.\n\nStudents from Leipzig, Germany, definitely go to the city's most famous beer pub \"Faust\" to rub the statue of the eponymous character, touch it between the horns and attract good luck to their side.\n\nMany of our boys and girls put the coveted penny under their heels ...\n\nThere are also many places in Moscow where students come to ask for help, and not only them.\n\nOne of these places ... German (aka Vvedenskoye) cemetery, where the crypt of the Erlanger family is located. It is here that many residents of the capital and its guests come to leave a note with a cherished dream or simply write their wish on the wall.\n\nProbably, I would not have remembered this place if the other day my son had not received a call from a classmate worried about the outcome of an important exam. Knowing that we live nearby and know this area of ​​Moscow well, the girl asked to accompany her to the crypt of “dreams come true”.\n\n“Alena, maybe you’ll give it up yourself,” the son tried to resist sluggishly.\n\nBut the girl was adamant, and, taking me with her as a guide and additional support, our group went to one of the oldest cemeteries in the capital, which appeared in the blight year 1771, at the same time as Vagankovsky and Danilovsky.\n\nIt should be noted that I did not particularly resist this campaign. Places around are historical: German settlement, Lefortovo ... Memories of Peter's time.\n\nAnd the architecture has been preserved here, creating the illusion of immersion in the past.\n\nExcept that the tram occasionally rumbles, but this is if you go the beaten path ...\n\nOn the way, I tell my son and his girlfriend about these places, because I have the right to do so. Exactly 25 years ago, together with friends and like-minded people, we created an ecological and cultural association \"Sloboda\" here, which saved architectural monuments from seemingly inevitable death - the then still under construction Third Automobile Ring was planned to pass through Lefortovo, barbarously breaking everything that gets in the way. We managed to save something. And in the course of the research, we ourselves have significantly replenished our knowledge of these places. By the way, many of today's leaders of \"Arkhnadzor\" also started in \"Sloboda\" with the salvation of the chambers of the merchant Shcherbakov. But that is another story.\n\nI ran to that German cemetery on dates ... Here was the building of the branch of the Pedagogical Institute, the windows of which overlooked the graves. And future artists and teachers-defectologists replenished their knowledge by looking out of the windows at the cemetery crows.\n\nWhat amused me most was that the road to the cemetery went straight out of the street called New Road. It is impossible to imagine a greater discrepancy.\n\nThat's what I'm talking about along the way.\n\nGerman cemetery\n\nThe cemetery on the Vvedensky mountains was the only one in the city intended for the Gentiles. According to legend, somewhere here is the grave of Lefort. But no one knows where. Stubborn researchers continue to search for it today.\n\n\"Western Christians\" were buried here until 1917. The situation changed during the Soviet era, when the religious component seemed to recede into the background. And people of all confessions began to bury here.\n\nThe cemetery is located on the high northern bank of the Sinichka River, which flows into the Yauza on the left. The titmouse has been flowing in the pipe for a long time, but the relief created by its channel has not changed.\n\nFinally, going up the New road, we go into the gates of the cemetery.\n\nPreviously, the ashes of those who died during Stalinist repression, but relatives over the years have become less and less, and now these places are occupied by \"new Russians\" killed in the shootings of the 90s, or those who took care in advance to rest in a historical place.\n\nThere is also a memorial to German soldiers at the Vvedenskoye cemetery. True, these are not Hitlerites. This is the mass grave of the participants of the First World War, who were captured by Russia, and then died here. There is an inscription on the obelisk: “Here lie the German soldiers, faithful to their duty and who did not spare their lives for the sake of the Fatherland. 1914-1918 \".\n\nAt the other end of the cemetery are two French mass graves- pilots from the Normandy-Niemen regiment and Napoleonic soldiers. Above the grave of the French who died in Moscow in 1812, a majestic monument was erected, fenced off by a massive chain. Instead of pillars, this chain is supported by cannons of the era Napoleonic Wars dug into the ground by vents.\n\nAnother revered grave of the Vvedensky cemetery is the burial of Fyodor Petrovich Haaz (1780–1853), a doctor famous for his philanthropy. Dr. Haaz became an example of sacrifice in Russia. His expression \"Hurry to do good!\" became the motto of Russian medicine.\n\nNot only did he not charge the poor for treatment, he himself sometimes donated money and even his own clothes to his needy patients. Especially Gaaz became famous for helping prisoners and convicts.\n\nOn the fence of Gaaz's grave, there are real shackles in which the exiles went to Siberia. These shackles should remind of the special concern of the \"holy doctor\", as the people called him, about prisoners.\n\nIt was Gaaz who made sure that instead of the heavy twenty-pound shackles in which the exiles were previously transported, a lighter model, nicknamed \"Gaaz's\", was developed for them, and that the rings at the ends of the chains in which the prisoner's hands and feet were bound were trimmed with leather. Former convicts still bring flowers to Haas' grave.\n\nPerhaps, in their midst, only one more grave enjoys such respect and popularity - Sonya Zolotoy Knob on Vagankovo. True, Sonya herself was never in this grave ...\n\nThey buried Gaaz, who spent all the money on the suffering, at the expense of the police. Twenty thousand people followed his coffin! This was possibly the most crowded funeral in Moscow.\n\nWriter Vikenty Veresaev describes an interesting case from the life of Dr. Haas:\n\nOnce, at a meeting of the Moscow Prison Committee, of which Metropolitan Philaret of Moscow was also a member, Gaaz defended the interests of the prisoners so zealously that even the bishop could not resist and objected: “Why, Fyodor Petrovich, are you interceding for these scoundrels! If a person is in prison, then there can be no use in him. \" To which Gaaz replied: “Your Eminence. You deigned to forget about Christ: he was also in prison. \"\n\nFilaret, himself, by the way, a lot zealous for the needs of the common people and later canonized, was embarrassed and said: “I did not forget about Christ, but Christ forgot me at that moment. Forgive for Christ's sake. \"\n\nGeneral Pyotr Palen (1778-1864) is also buried here, who in 1812, being with his corps in the rearguard of the 1st Russian army and holding back the enemy, which was many times superior in number, allowed Barclay to withdraw to Smolensk and thus saved the army, which means , and the whole campaign.\n\nHere you can also find the burial place of the family of famous Moscow pharmacists and pharmacists Ferreins (by this name the current well-known entrepreneur Bryntsalov called his pharmaceutical plant). There are also many pre-revolutionary foreign businessmen here, including the Erlangers.\n\nAs soon as we approached the crypt, we saw there a woman - the attendant of the cemetery, who was washing away the inscriptions on the wall of the crypt.\n\n“We clean the walls regularly, but it's useless, new people constantly come here in the hope of a miracle,” says Natalya.\n\nIn the chapel above the crypt of the Erlanger family, built by the architect Shekhtel, there is a mosaic \"Christ the Sower\" by Konstantin Petrov-Vodkin.\n\nNatalia said that these inscriptions and notes are called \"sorrow\" to the Lord.\n\nAlena, who came with us, was embarrassed and carefully shoved a note with her request into the frame of the small window of the crypt.\n\nAnd Natalya, apparently delighted with the unexpected listeners, said that one of the most interesting stories that happened in Moscow cemeteries in the 1990s. The parish of the Church of Peter and Paul, which is on the neighboring Soldatskaya Street, undertook to raise funds for the restoration of the chapel. And the priest blessed a certain ascetic, perhaps even a blessed one, to stand near the chapel with a mug - Tamara. She also cleared the crypt under the chapel from earth and age-old debris, settling in a hut in the cemetery. At night, the cemetery was closed, and Aunt Tamara, as the cemetery workers called her, remained completely alone in her hut. In the morning, the workers opened the gates of the cemetery, and they were greeted at the fence by a cheerful, smiling man with a copper mug around his neck. But once Aunt Tamara disappeared and never again appeared on the Vvedensky mountains.\n\nThey say that sometimes they even see her today in Moscow near different churches: as if she was standing there with her unchanging mug and collecting donations for some good purpose.\n\nMoscow scholars managed to find out the name of \"blessed Tamara\" - Tamara Pavlovna Kronkojans. Ten years of complete disability, the doctors' verdict (she will die tonight), her last prayer, and suddenly - a miracle! She stayed alive. She came to the German cemetery, where she lived for twelve years in an ordinary iron trailer, both in the heat and in the cold.\n\nWith the alms given to her, she restored from the ruins a unique chapel with a fresco by the great Russian artist Petrov-Vodkin \"Christ the Sower\".\n\nShe also built a copper chapel on the abandoned grave of Elder Zosima (Zechariah), Schema-Archimandrite, the last confessor of the Trinity-Sergius Lavra before its closure after the revolution.\n\nThus, a beggar woman, unknown to anyone, became the keeper of Orthodox shrines at the Vvedenskoye cemetery ... Tamara lost her mother early and grew up in an orphanage. She simply could not calmly look at the abandoned graves. The cemetery was affectionately called a town.\n\n... And Alena, thanks to whom we came to the German cemetery this time, finally passed her exam with excellent marks. She is sure that the chapel helped her. And the son assures that even without this Alena knew the subject better than anyone in the group ...\n\nFrom the history of the Vvedenskoye cemetery\n\nAfter the revolution, the artist Viktor Vasnetsov and his brother Apollinaris Mikhailovich were buried at the German cemetery; one of the most famous publishers Ivan Sytin; architect, author of the project for the Museum of Fine Arts named after Alexander III (named after Pushkin), the department store \"Mur and Merilis\" (TSUM), \"Tea House\" on Myasnitskaya by Roman Klein. Later - constructivist architect Konstantin Melnikov; actors Anatoly Ktorov, Alla Tarasova, Tatyana Peltzer, Rina Zelenaya, Lucien Ovchinnikova; singer Maria Maksakova; director Yuri Ozerov and his equally famous brother, sports commentator Nikolai Ozerov; writers Mikhail Prishvin and Stepan Wanderer; Robert Shtilmark, author of The Heir from Calcutta; Leonid Grossman and Lev Gumilevsky; Alexandra Kazantseva; the poets Sophia Parnok and Dmitry Kedrin; Vera Inber and the parodist Alexander Ivanov, as well as Irakli Andronikov; Vadim Kozhinov; rock musicians Anatoly Krupnov and Alexander Losev; scientist-physicist, Nobel Prize laureate Ilya Frank; filmmaker Abram Rome and many, many others famous people country.\n\nAnd also here is the grave of Lucien Olivier - a famous Moscow restaurateur, author of the legendary salad, as well as one of the founders of the supplement to the \"Evening Moscow\" newspaper \"Evening Club\" Igor Tabashnikov, who died tragically in 1993.\n\nErlanger family history\n\nAnton Maksimovich Erlanger, despite his name, was a native Muscovite. True, only in the first generation. His father, a composer and conductor, worked at one time at the Mariinsky Theater, then moved to Moscow. Anton Erlanger's maternal grandfather was Dutch artist van Brussels.\n\nBut more than art, he was attracted by industrial production and entrepreneurship. Anton Erlanger built the first large steam roller mill in Russia. This multi-storey giant, processing up to forty tons of grain per day, grew up in 1881 on the territory of Sokolniki Pole. According to this model, Erlanger himself and other Russian bakers began to build mills throughout the country.\n\nErlanger created the first professional publication in Russia on flour-milling and grain trade “Melnik”. In 1892 Erlanger opened the Moscow School of Millers at his own expense. It still exists today, only it is called differently: \"Technical and Economic College.\"\n\nAfter the death of the \"mill king\" in 1910, the mill in Sokolniki passed to his brothers, and in 1918 it was nationalized. In 1930, the mill was named after ... People's Commissar Tsuryupa, which the enterprise bears right up to perestroika times. Today it is a joint-stock company called Mill Plant in Sokolniki.\n\nAnton Erlanger donated a lot to charity, established scholarships, helped the poor ...\n\nDecree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 176 of February 20, 1995 \"On approval of the list of objects of historical and cultural heritage federal (all-Russian) significance \"the Erlanger mausoleum at the Vvedenskoye cemetery was included in the list of objects of the all-Russian historical and cultural heritage.\n\nThe grandson of Anton Erlanger - his namesake Anton Alexandrovich was a famous paleontologist, and also led a paleontological school circle. He died tragically in 1996 at the age of 89 when he was hit by a car on the street.\n\nHe did not receive a full education in the field of geology and paleontology. He fought.\n\nAfter the war, he worked at the school and paleontological section of the Moscow Society of Naturalists (MOIP). Anton Alexandrovich made a living by making sets teaching aids on paleontology for the Nature and School factory.\n\nIn the late 1960s, he sold to the Paleontological Institute at the Academy of Sciences (PIN) a unique collection of the remains of sea lilies from the Carboniferous deposits of the Moscow Region. For this, many in the PIN began to call him a “paleontological speculator”. In the Paleontological Museum at the PIN there is another unique exhibit from Erlanger: a huge limestone slab with an accumulation of sea lilies, taken as a monolith in the Myachkovsky (Turaevsky) quarry; members of the circle of Anton Alexandrovich took part in the excavations.\n\nOne of the very rare fossils of sea lilies was named by the paleontologist Arendt in honor of Anton Alexandrovich who found it - Paramegaliocrinus Erlangeri.\n\nErlanger was able to independently identify fossils from a wide variety of geological systems and corners of the former Soviet Union. Often he did it by sight.\n\nWhen Anton Alexandrovich died, he was buried at the Vvedenskoye cemetery, where his ancestors are buried.\n\nPoems about the Erlanger Chapel:\n\n\"In the shade, in silence, away from vanity\n\nStands alone since ancient times\n\nEnchanted for centuries, a magical crypt.\n\nWill fulfill the desire that will be on it. \"\n\nLocal parable of the Erlanger chapel\n\nOnce upon a time there was a woman who loved her husband very much. Then her husband died, and the woman couldn’t come to terms with his death: she refused to eat, didn’t sleep, spent all the time in the cemetery, mourning her beloved ... And one day she wrote on the crypt: “I want my husband to come to life”. The husband, of course, did not come to life, but a man suffering from sexual impotence once came to the crypt and also wrote something. I must say that he looked like the deceased widow's husband, like a twin brother. At first glance, they fell in love with each other and lived happily ever after ...\n\nChapel of Elder Zechariah\n\nThere is a chapel in the cemetery for Elder Zacharias, or, as he was called in monasticism, Zosima, to which people specially come to pray for the gift of a spouse or for help in choosing a second half. The tablet on the chapel tells about Zechariah-Zosima as follows: “He lived for 86 years (1850–1936), performed many feats, performed many miracles, witnessed by eyewitnesses. Some miracles were performed by God for the sake of Zechariah as early as his childhood. He saw the Trinity three times and the Mother of God three times in reality; twice walked on water, as on dry land, through his prayer the deceased rose again, he healed the sick and cleansed from sins. This is an ascetic worthy of the name of the saint. \"\n\nElder Zechariah's teachings\n\nTake care of your conscience, it is the voice of God - the voice of the Guardian Angel. How to protect your conscience, learn from the elder Father Ambrose of Optina. He acquired the grace of the Holy Spirit. Wisdom without grace is madness.\n\nRemember the words of Father Ambrose: \"Where it is simple, there are a hundred angels, and where it is tricky, there is not a single one.\" Achieve the simplicity that only perfect humility can provide. Reach in humility to love with a simple, perfect, embracing prayer for everyone, everyone ...\n\nWise is the one who has acquired the Holy Spirit, trying to fulfill all the commandments of Christ. And if he is wise, then he is also humble.\n\nBe courageous even when the Lord sends great trials. Passions overwhelm, prayer weakens, I don't even want to create it, all attention is absorbed by various desires and passions ...\n\nYes, here, on purpose, such internal and external troubles occur, from which a weak person falls into despondency. This passion - despondency - kills all that is sacred, all living things in a person. Rather, then crucify yourself with the cross, praying as in ancient times many of the ascetics prayed, struggling with the passions. Read \"May God be resurrected, and scattered against Him ...\"\n\nIf anyone has it, read the canon to the honest and life-giving cross of Christ, and then crucify yourself with the cross and beg the Comforter of our souls and bodies to have mercy on you, to forgive you and enter your soul and drive out that despondency that is killing you.\n\nFrom the history\n\nAccording to legend, the grave of Franz Jan Lefort, an associate of Peter I, was covered with a marble board with an epitaph carved on it: \"Beware, passer-by, do not trample this stone with your feet: it is soaked in the tears of the greatest monarch in the world ...\""
