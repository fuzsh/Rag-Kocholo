        "text": "Danilova Valentina Vasilievna was born in St. Petersburg. Her father, a military engineer, participated in the construction of the Georgian Military Highway and died in 1919 of the typhus epidemic that was raging at that time. Valentina and her mother, without a breadwinner, accidentally ended up in Sukhumi and, taking advantage of the hospitality of Alexei Evdokimovich Dmitriev, lived in his house for many years. Her childhood and youthful years passed here. When choosing a profession, the matured Valentina for a long time could not decide what she would do in her future life, architecture, or art. The latter won, but the theme of architecture is present in her work.\n\nIn the 20s, Valentina Danilova studied at the Tiflis art studios of B. A. Fogel and M. I. Toidze, in 1928 she entered the Tiflis Academy of Arts under the direction of E. E. Lansere and N. A. Charlemagne. The first exhibition of her works took place in 1931, in Tiflis.\n\nIn the early thirties, Valentina Danilova moved to Moscow and her whole life passed here; she became a member of the Moscow Artists Union, joined the Union of Artists of the USSR, participated in exhibitions. Her works were exhibited in the capital and abroad: in Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, and the countries of the Middle East. She also participated in small traveling exhibitions at factories, in villages, collective farms, and sparsely populated cities.\n\nThe creative heritage of Danilova Valentina Vasilievna is stored in the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, the Chuvash State Museum of Art, the Udmurt Republican Museum of Fine Arts, the State Museum of Kazakhstan, and the Solikamsk Museum of Local Lore.\n\nIn the late thirties, Valentina Vasilievna was in charge of the art department of the State Historical Museum. In 1945, due to moving to the Moscow region, she had to abandon this work.\n\nDanilova is a landscape painter, portrait painter, animal painter, but architecture occupies a special place in her work.\n\nIn 1966, she participated in the exhibition \"Monuments of Old Russian Architecture in the Works of Moscow Artists\", in 1968 - in the exhibition \"Monuments of the History and Culture of Our Homeland in the Works of Moscow Artists\".\n\nThe main direction of Danilova's work is etchings. They differ in various types of manufacturing techniques: dry needle, stroke-aquatint, tinted etching, linocut.\n\nIn a joint work with Oleg Dmitriev, Valentina Danilova’s talent was revealed in a new way, she became the author of thematic compositions in paintings made by Dmitriev’s brush.\n\nIn the Danilova archive, pencil drawings have been preserved. These are variations of the outline of thematic compositions, beetles, butterflies, flowers, animals.\n\nIn the seventies and eighties Danilova was carried away by another type of graphic art, bookplates.\n\nIn details.\n\nIn the first years after moving to Moscow, Valentina Danilova lived with her mother in a small room in the Novodevichy Convent. In 1936, she entered into a legal marriage with Oleg Dmitriev, a student at the Moscow Art College in memory of 1905. In the fall of 1941, Oleg was already a student at the Institute of Fine Arts, evacuated to Samarkand. Valentina stayed in Moscow, lived with her mother in the Novodevichy Convent, and extinguished the “lighter” on the roof at night. In 1945, the Novodevichy Convent, by order of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR, passed into the disposal of the Theological Institute. Everyone who was not related to this organization, now became “outsiders” and were forced to vacate the occupied premises.\n\nThe family found new housing in Malakhovka. Here, in a rented apartment, Valentina Danilova and Oleg Dmitriev began working on a large topic about the life and work of prominent figures of the nineteenth century: musicians, artists, artists, writers, revolutionaries. In this creative union, Danilova worked on creating thematic compositions, while achieving the most plausible atmosphere and surroundings of the protagonist. Among the paintings in this series, the most famous are large-scale canvases: “Gogol reads the comedy“ The Examiner ”,“ Artist Fedotov in Moscow ”,“ Chernyshevsky in exile ”.\n\nThe artists have been working on this topic for over seventeen years. But Danilova during these years there were many other interesting events.\n\nIn 1951, she and Oleg Alekseevich began a series of trips to the water expanses of Russia on the yacht \"Phoenix\". The owner of the yacht was Viktor Fedorovich Bolkhovitinov, aircraft designer, major general of the aviation forces of the Soviet Union. He built the yacht with his own hands, which is why he called the Phoenix. With Viktor Fedorovich and his wife, Natalya Sergeevna, Valentina Vasilyevna and Oleg Alekseevich met shortly after the war. Warm, friendly relations between families lasted a lifetime. The last, short sailing on the yacht was in the summer of 1968, and on January 30, 1970 Viktor Fedorovich died.\n\nThe works made under the influence of these travels, Valentina Vasilievna combined under the title “On the water expanses of Russia on the Phoenix yacht”.\n\nIn 1955, Valentina and Oleg were lucky to take part in an ethnographic expedition in Kyrgyzstan. A series of works created during a trip in extreme conditions, Valentina Vasilyevna called \"Kyrgyz Suite.\"\n\nArtists often spent the winter at the Tarusa boarding house. Here they had all the conditions for relaxation and creativity in comfortable conditions. But the most severe frosts could not force Valentina Vasilyevna to refuse to work in the open air. She combined a series of frosty landscapes under the name \"Tarusa\".\n\nAnd the “golden autumn” Valentina Vasilievna and Oleg Alekseevich often spent in Sukhumi, visiting Leonid, Oleg’s brother. Valentina collected the pencil drawings of flowers, plants, beetles, animals in a folder called Sukhum.\n\nThe series “Shelter of Peace, Work and Inspiration” was made under the impression of pilgrimage trips to Pushkin places.\n\nIn the mid-seventies, after retirement, Valentina Vasilievna and Oleg Alekseevich for many years participated in the improvement of the art department at the Solikamsk Museum of Local Lore. They gave him more than three hundred of his best works. “For the contribution to the creation of the art fund of the museum of local lore, active work in the aesthetic education of the working people of Solikamsk”, Valentina Vasilyevna and Oleg Alekseevich, the city administration awarded the title of Honorary Citizen of Solikamsk.\n\nValentina Vasilyevna died on June 17, 1998.\n\nCompiled by E. Dmitrieva"
