        "text": "110 years ago, on January 12, 1907, was born Sergei Korolev, rocket engineer, Russian scientist-designer of rocket and space systems, full member of the USSR Academy of Sciences (1958, corresponding member since 1953), twice Hero of Socialist Labor (1956, 1961), laureate Lenin Prize(1957); head of the Soviet rocket and space programs, the founder of practical astronautics, and so on and so forth ...\n\nBut all these titles and awards might not have been, and only a nameless mound of frozen earth would have remained from Korolev, who miraculously did not die in Stalin's prison and in Kolyma ...\n\nAt first, nothing foreshadowed future upheavals and blows of fate: just the childhood of a gifted child in the Russian Empire...\n\nSergei Korolev was born on January 12, 1907 (according to the new style) in the city of Zhitomir (Russian Empire) in the family of a teacher of Russian literature Pavel Yakovlevich Korolev (1877-1929), originally from Mogilev, and the daughter of a Nizhyn merchant Maria Nikolaevna Moskalenko (Balanina) (1888-1980) ).\n\nHouse of Korolev in Zhytomyr\n\nHe was about three years old when Maria Moskalenko left the family. Little Seryozha was sent to Nizhyn to his grandmother Maria Matveevna and grandfather Nikolai Yakovlevich Moskalenko.\n\nIn 1915 he entered the preparatory classes of the gymnasium in Kyiv, in 1917 he went to the first class of the gymnasium in Odessa, where his mother, Maria Nikolaevna Balanina, and stepfather, Grigory Mikhailovich Balanin, moved.\n\nHe did not study at the gymnasium for long - it was closed; then there were four months of a unified labor school. Then he was educated at home - his mother and stepfather were teachers, and his stepfather, in addition to teaching, had an engineering education. Also in school years Sergey was interested in the then new aviation technology, and showed exceptional abilities for it. In 1922-1924 he studied at a construction vocational school, studying in many circles and at various courses.\n\nIn 1921, he met the pilots of the Odessa hydro detachment and actively participated in aviation public life: from the age of 16 - as a lecturer on the elimination of aviation illiteracy, and from 17 - as the author of the project of a non-motorized K-5 aircraft, officially defended before the competent commission and recommended for construction.\n\nHaving entered the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute in 1924 with a degree in aviation technology, Korolev mastered general engineering disciplines in it in two years and became a glider athlete. In the autumn of 1926 he was transferred to the Moscow Higher technical school(MVTU) named after N. E. Bauman.\n\nDuring his studies at the Moscow Higher Technical School, S.P. Korolev already gained fame as a young capable aircraft designer and an experienced glider pilot. On November 2, 1929, on the glider \"Firebird\" designed by M. K. Tikhonravov, Korolev passed the exams for the title of \"soaring pilot\", and in December of the same year, under the guidance of Andrei Nikolaevich Tupolev, he defended his thesis - the project of the SK-4 aircraft. The aircraft he designed and built - the Koktebel and Krasnaya Zvezda gliders and the SK-4 light aircraft, designed to achieve a record flight range - showed Korolev's outstanding abilities as an aircraft designer.\n\nHowever, especially after meeting with K. E. Tsiolkovsky, Korolev was fascinated by thoughts about flights into the stratosphere and the principles jet propulsion.\n\nIn September 1931, S.P. Korolev and a talented enthusiast in the field of rocket engines F.A. Zander achieved the creation in Moscow with the help of Osoaviakhim of a public organization - the Jet Propulsion Study Group (GIRD); in April 1932, it became essentially a state research and design laboratory for the development of missiles. aircraft, in which the first Soviet liquid-propellant ballistic missiles (BR) GIRD-09 and GIRD-10 were created and launched.\n\nOn August 17, 1933, the first successful launch of the GIRD rocket was carried out.\n\nIn 1933, on the basis of the Moscow GIRD and the Leningrad Gas Dynamics Laboratory (GDL), the Jet Research Institute was established under the leadership of I. T. Kleimenov. Korolev was appointed his deputy with the rank of divinzhener.\n\nDiving engineer S. P. Korolev in 1933\n\nIn 1935 he became head of the rocket aircraft department; in 1936, he managed to bring to the test cruise missiles: anti-aircraft - 217 with a powder rocket engine and long-range - 212 with a liquid rocket engine. By 1938, his department had developed projects for long-range liquid cruise and ballistic missiles, aircraft missiles for firing at air and ground targets, and anti-aircraft solid-propellant missiles. However, differences in views on the prospects for the development of rocket technology forced Korolev to leave the post of deputy director, and he was appointed to the ordinary position of senior engineer.\n\nOn June 27, 1938, the head of the rocket flying systems department of the Moscow Rocket Research Institute, 31-year-old Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, was arrested under the infamous Article 58 as a member of a counter-revolutionary Trotskyist organization allegedly operating within the RNII, as well as for disrupting the delivery of new types of weapons ( Kleymenov, Langemak, Glushko were arrested earlier in the “RNII case”.\n\nKorolev was tortured during interrogations - both jaws were broken, Sergei Pavlovich was hit on the cheekbone with a decanter. Korolev wrote: “Investigators Shestakov and Bykov subjected me to physical repression and bullying.”\n\nIn 1938, the investigators who tortured him, who broke the prisoner's jaw and soon, after threatening to kill his wife and daughter, obtained confessions, hardly thought about the future fate of the person under investigation. Dozens passed through the hands of sadists bright personalities and among the investigators there was even an unspoken competition: who would break down faster and sign everything.\n\nAfter the arrest. Butyrskaya prison, June 28, 1938\n\nOn September 25, 1938, Korolev was included in the list of persons subject to trial by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. The session of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court was chaired by the military lawyer Vasily Ulrikh, “through whose hands” tens of thousands of repressed people passed.\n\nThe refusal at the trial of the “confessions” knocked out under torture, of course, did not affect anything, but the defendant was lucky. In the list, Korolev was in the first category - almost all of them were sentenced to death. If it had been a year earlier, then everything would have ended for Korolev. But he was lucky, on September 27, 1938, Sergei Korolev was sentenced to 10 years in prison and sent to Kolyma.\n\nIn Kolyma, at a gold mine, Korolev survived by accident. To systematic malnutrition and scurvy, severe frosts and exhausting labor, the terror of criminals was added. Criminals generally exploited \"enemies of the people\" with impunity - at their expense they freed \"their own\" from hard physical work, took away rations in order to eat better. An attempt at a \"rebellion\" by a proud loner was easily crushed by starvation. He became a “wick”, they even stopped sending him to work, since he could not walk: “As soon as I bend over, I fall. The tongue was swollen, the gums were bleeding, the teeth were falling out from scurvy.\n\nIf you don’t work, they reduce the already beggarly ration. Before an unexpected savior, who recognized a talented colleague, a dying goner appeared: “In inconceivable rags lay a terribly thin, pale, lifeless man.”\n\nMine Magyak. Korolev spent only five months here, from July to December 1939, he worked at the Maldyak mine in the Susuman region. Among the Kolyma camps, which are already not the most cheerful places, this one had quite notoriety. In 1938-1939, the death rate of prisoners was very high here, and about a year before the future chief designer got there, the “Moscow brigade” of investigators was rampant in Maldyak, of which a certain NKVD lieutenant M. Katselenbogen (Bogen) was especially cruel. Hundreds of people were shot.\n\n“Bogen instructed me and a group of comrades to conduct an investigation, giving three hours to complete 20 cases. When we complained to him about overwork, he directly ordered that the arrested be beaten. Bogen himself set an example for us, summoned one prisoner and beat him with a poker, after which we beat him with whatever we had to. A few days later, Captain Kononovich arrived with prosecutor Metelev at 2 am and by 6 am considered more than 200 cases, of which 133-135 were sentenced to highest measure punishment. The prosecutor did not look at the arrested and did not talk to any of them.”\n\n(from the testimony of an employee of the UNKVD for Dalstroy A. V. Garusor).\n\nOn the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Gagarin's flight, a film was made about Korolev, where he was allegedly presented as a rebel against camp orders. In reality, Sergei Pavlovich could hardly stand on his feet from exhaustion, and was not capable of any rebellion. The doctor Tatyana Repeva saved him, transferred him to the hospital as an orderly.\n\nIn the autumn of 1940, he was transferred to a new place of detention - the Moscow special prison of the NKVD, where, under the leadership of A.N. Tupolev, also a prisoner, took an active part in the creation of the Pe-2 and Tu-2 bombers and at the same time developed projects for a guided air torpedo and a new version of a missile interceptor.\n\nGetting into Tupolev's sharashka was both salvation and the beginning, without exaggeration, of the greatest deeds. But the phrase \"slam without an obituary\" became his favorite saying for a long time: “She [Themis] is blindfolded, she will take it and make a mistake, today you decide differential equations, and tomorrow - Kolyma \".\n\nIn 1942, Korolev was transferred to another prison-type design bureau at the Kazan Aviation Plant, where work was underway on new types of rocket engines to be used in aviation. Korolev devotes himself to this work with his characteristic enthusiasm. He was released in 1944 and rehabilitated in April 1957.\n\nBut the arrest and stay in the Gulag forever infected Korolev with a pessimistic attitude towards the surrounding reality. According to the recollections of people who knew him closely, Sergei Pavlovich's favorite saying was the phrase \"Slapped without an obituary.\"\n\nIn July 1944, S.P. Korolev was released early from prison with the removal of a criminal record but without rehabilitation (minutes of the meeting of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on July 27, 1944) on the personal instructions of I.V. Stalin, after which he worked for another year in Kazan.\n\nOn May 13, 1946, Decree of the Council of Ministers of the USSR No. 1017-419ss “Issues of rocket weapons” appears, S.P. Korolev is not directly mentioned in the text of the Decree, but in accordance with this document he was appointed to a new place of work. In August 1946, he was appointed Chief Designer of the Special Design Bureau No. 1 (OKB-1), created in Kaliningrad near Moscow, to develop long-range ballistic missiles, and head of department No. 3 of NII-88 for their development.\n\nThe first task set by the government for S.P. Korolev, as the Chief Designer of OKB-1, and all organizations involved in missile weapons, was to create an analogue of the V-2 rocket from Soviet materials. But already in 1947, a decree was issued on the development of new ballistic missiles with a greater range than the V-2, up to 3000 km.\n\nIn 1948, S.P. Korolev began flight and design tests of the R-1 ballistic missile (an analogue of the V-2) and in 1950 successfully put it into service.\n\nIn 1956, under the leadership of S.P. Korolev, a two-stage intercontinental ballistic missile R-7 was created with a detachable warhead weighing 3 tons and a flight range of 8 thousand km. The rocket was successfully tested in 1957 at test site No. 5 built for this purpose in Kazakhstan (the current Baikonur cosmodrome). For the combat duty of these missiles in 1958-1959, a combat launch station (the Angara object) was built near the village of Plesetsk (Arkhangelsk Region, the current Plesetsk cosmodrome). A modification of the R-7A missile with a range increased to 11,000 km was in service with the USSR Strategic Missile Forces from 1960 to 1968.\n\nIn 1957, Sergei Pavlovich created the first ballistic missiles on stable fuel components (mobile land and sea based); he became a pioneer in these new and important directions in the development of missile weapons.\n\nOn October 4, 1957, the first artificial Earth satellite in the history of mankind was launched into low Earth orbit. His flight was a stunning success and created a high international prestige for the Soviet Union.\n\nApril 12, 1961 S.P. Korolev again strikes the world community. Having created the first manned spacecraft \"Vostok-1\", he implements the world's first manned flight into space - a citizen of the USSR Yuri Alekseevich Gagarin in near-Earth orbit.\n\nThe main achievement of the USSR was the first space flight. Communists often cite Gagarin's flight as an example to prove the superiority of the Soviet system. Under the leadership of S.P. Korolev in the USSR, ballistic and geophysical rockets, artificial Earth satellites, launch vehicles and manned spaceships\"Vostok\" and \"Voskhod\", on which for the first time in history a man's space flight and man's exit into outer space were made. Rocket and space systems, at the head of the development of which was Korolev, made it possible for the first time in the world to carry out launches of artificial satellites of the Earth and the Sun, flights of automatic interplanetary stations to the Moon, Venus, Mars, to make a soft landing on the surface of the Moon. Under his leadership, artificial Earth satellites of the Elektron and Molniya-1 series, satellites of the Kosmos series, interplanetary vehicles of the Zond series were created.\n\nBut in fact, Korolev as a designer took place in many respects not thanks to, but in spite of the Soviet regime. The Soviet government almost rotted him in the camps. The fact that Korolev survived is just an accident. If the circumstances had turned out a little differently, there would have been no Gagarin's flight. Had Korolev fallen into the clutches of Katselenbogen or not met a good doctor, and instead of Gagarin's flight, we would have had an unmarked grave of the Kolyma ZK.\n\nUltimately, Korolev died prematurely thanks to Stalin's executioners. premature death Koroleva in 1966 was the hardest blow for the whole industry. The last attempt to save the patient was the operation, which was personally carried out by the Minister of Health of the USSR. During the operation, the anesthesiologist encountered an unforeseen circumstance - in order to give anesthesia, it was necessary to insert a tube, and the operated person could not open his mouth wide. The patient's jaws, broken during the interrogation, did not heal properly, and he was always nervous before visiting the dentist...\n\nCorresponding Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences S. N. Efuni spoke about the 1966 operation, during which Sergei Pavlovich died. Efuni himself took part in it only at a certain stage, but, being at that time the leading anesthesiologist of the 4th Main Directorate of the USSR Ministry of Health, he knew all the details of this tragic event.\n\n— Anesthetist Yuri Ilyich Savinov encountered an unforeseen circumstance- said Sergei Naumovich. - In order to give anesthesia, it was necessary to insert a tube, and Korolev could not open his mouth wide. He had fractures of two jaws ...\n\n- Did Sergei Pavlovich have a broken jaw?- the journalist Y. Golovanov asked Korolev's wife, Nina Ivanovna.\n\nHe never mentioned it she answered thoughtfully. — He really could not open his mouth wide, and I remember: when he had to go to the dentist, he was always nervous ...\n\nFrom the official death certificate:\n\nTov. S.P. Korolev was ill with sarcoma of the rectum. In addition, he had: atherosclerotic cardiosclerosis, sclerosis of the cerebral arteries, pulmonary emphysema and metabolic disorders. S.P. Korolev underwent an operation to remove the tumor with extirpation of the rectum and part of the sigmoid colon. The death of comrade S.P. Koroleva came from heart failure (acute myocardial ischemia).\n\nWhy so many diseases at the age of 60? Korolev received emphysema in camps in Kolyma and the Far East.\n\nIn 1965, shortly before the death of the great designer, he was visited by friends from the Tupolev sharashka. Pointing to the guard at the gate, he, an academician, twice Hero of Socialist Labor, said: “You know, guys, sometimes you wake up at night, lie down and think: now, maybe someone has already been found, gave the command - and these same polite guards will brazenly enter here and say: “Come on, bastard, pack your things!”\n\nBut this was already after Stalin and Khrushchev, in the era of the “good” Brezhnev. By the way, the Nazi designer \"V\" Wernher von Braun received American citizenship earlier (1955) than Korolev, who had not committed crimes, was rehabilitated (1957).\n\nForever ruined life. And no awards and titles could compensate for the torment and suffering that the future General Designer endured in Stalin's dungeons ...\n\n\"said Alla Medvedeva, scientific secretary of the academic readings on cosmonautics. The patriarch of Russian cosmonautics did not live until his 100th birthday only two and a half months.\n\nAccording to Medvedeva, Boris Chertok died on Friday at 07:40 am. Colleagues of the academician will inform about the place and time of the farewell ceremony later.\n\nFor many years, Boris Chertok was the head of the preparation and conduct of academic lectures on astronautics. They are known to many as the \"Royal Readings\". Before last days the outstanding designer remained an employee of RSC Energia and gave lectures to students.\n\nAlexei Leonov, twice Hero of the USSR, the first person to travel in outer space, commenting on the sad news, said: \" Last Man, which connected us with the era of S.P. The Queen has passed away. With the departure of Boris Evseevich, unfortunately, the era of great domestic space achievements is also leaving. This is great sadness. Sorry man. Kind, smart, powerful - because the weak do not live up to a hundred years. I suggested making a film about Boris Evseevich while he was alive. Unfortunately, we didn't make it. With his departure, a true witness to the heyday of the great space state was lost.\n\n\"Together with Korolev, Chertok sorted through German archives, recreating bit by bit the V-2 rocket in the USSR. This rocket formed the basis of domestic ballistic missiles and the legendary Seven, which is the prototype of the current Soyuz. He participated in the creation of the first artificial satellite Earth, Salyutov, Voskhodov, Vostokov, all automatic lunar stations, Buran reusable spacecraft, Leonov recalled.\n\nChertok about his dream and the secret code for Gagarin\n\nThe name of Boris Evseevich is associated with the main achievements of the Soviet Union in space exploration. He always willingly shared memories of the events of the past. So, in an interview Russian newspaper\", given 7 years ago, Chertok admitted that flying into space was his dream, revealed the reasons for the loss in the \"moon race\" of the Soviet Union to the Americans, spoke about the secret code for Gagarin.\n\nThe academician also spoke about the first meeting with Korolev, which took place in Germany in 1945. Chertok at that time was the head of the Rabe Institute. The main goal of the institute was the restoration of German rocket technology. “Once they called from Berlin: “Lieutenant Colonel Korolev will come to you.” I remember, when I saw his very shabby Opel-Cadet, I immediately thought: “It’s a small bird ...”, Chertok said, smiling. At the same time, he noted that Korolev Chertok, describing the character of Korolyov, noted that in strong terms he was never shy, but at the same time very quickly retreated.\n\nChertok also expressed the opinion in an interview that the Soviet Union could not send its cosmonauts to the Moon first, because it refused to ground test the first stage of the N-1 launch vehicle. \"To carry out the tests, it was necessary to build a very expensive and huge firing stand. It was decided not to build it. Therefore, constructive, design, technological miscalculations appeared at the launches. If ground tests had been carried out, they would have appeared even then,\" the academician explained.\n\nThe point in the \"Lunar program\", according to him, was put by three people: Mstislav Keldysh - President of the Academy of Sciences, Sergei Afanasyev - Minister of General Engineering and Dmitry Ustinov - Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee for Defense Affairs. They decided that after four unsuccessful launches, there was no point in continuing the \"moon race\". By that time, Korolev had already died, and Vasily Mishin took the place of the chief designer. Although the developers proposed the construction of a base on the Moon, the Trinity did not agree with them. Therefore, the project was not implemented.\n\nThe interview also talked about the flight of Yuri Gagarin. \"Of course, we risked a lot by launching Gagarin. True, it should be noted that the Americans, following us, showed great courage: the reliability of launching a man into space on Mercury was worse,\" the academician said.\n\nBoris Chertok told the following about the reasons for assigning the secret code 125 to Gagarin: “According to psychologists, a person who found himself face to face with the Universe could “go nuts.” Therefore, someone suggested introducing a digital code lock for the first flight. Only by typing \"125\", it was possible to use the power supply of the manual control system.\"\n\nAccording to Boris Evseevich, this code was sealed in an envelope. “It was assumed that if Gagarin could get the envelope and, after reading it, dial the code, then he was of his mind and could take over manual control. code to Gagarin,\" he said.\n\nJournalists at the end of the interview asked Boris Evseevich if he ever wanted to go into space himself. He honestly replied that he wanted to, but ironically added that at his age \"it would be a completely justified risk.\"\n\nIn another interview that Boris Chertok gave to the magazine \" Russian space\"(which was published this spring on the website of Roskomos), he regretted that so far, earthlings in the Universe have not found comrades in mind.\n\n“I am 99 years old and I am satisfied that I was involved in events of historical significance. However, it is sad to realize that we are alone in the foreseeable space. The Hubble telescope has discovered a large number of exoplanets, but nowhere necessary conditions for the origin of life. Today, the only hope for Jupiter's moon is Europa. There, under the ice shell, there are supposedly oceans of water. Perhaps they can find traces of life there. However, for the time being, the mind is peculiar only to the inhabitant of the planet Earth - to man,\" the academician said.\n\nBoris Evseevich Chertok. Biography\n\nBoris Evseevich was born in Lodz (Poland) on March 1, 1912. He graduated from the Moscow Power Engineering Institute in 1940. In the period from 1940 to 1945 he worked in the Design Bureau of Chief Designer Viktor Bolkhovitinov.\n\nChertok as part of a special The commission was sent to Germany in April 1945. Until January 1947, Chertok was the head of a group of Soviet specialists who studied FAU missiles. Boris Chertok and Alexey Isaev in the same year organized in Thuringia (in the Soviet occupation zone) a joint Soviet-German institute \"Rabe\". The main focus of the work was the study and development of control technology for long-range ballistic missiles. On the basis of the institute, a new institute was created - \"Nordhausen\". Sergei Korolev was appointed chief engineer of this institute.\n\nBoris Chertok from that time worked closely with Korolev. In 1946, Boris Evseevich was transferred to the post of deputy. chief engineer and head of the department of control systems NII-88 (Scientific Research Institute N88) of the Ministry of Armaments. Chertok in 1950 was appointed deputy head, and in 1951 head of the control systems department of OKB-1 NII-88 (Special Design Bureau N1, today RSC Energia). Korolev was the chief designer.\n\nIn 1974 Chertok was appointed deputy. General Designer for Control Systems NPO Energia. Since 1946, his scientific and engineering activities have been associated with the development and creation of control systems for spacecraft and rockets.\n\nChertok was the leader in the creation of the school, which to this day determines the scientific directions, as well as the level domestic technology for manned space flights.\n\nIn 1961, B. Chertok received the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, was elected a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences in the Department of Mechanics and Control Processes in 1968, a full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences - in 2000, a full member International Academy astronautics - in 1990\n\nChertok's work has received numerous awards. He received two Orders of Lenin (1956, 1961), in 1971 - the Order October revolution, in 1975 - the Red Banner of Labor, in 1945 - the Red Star, in 1996 - \"For Merit to the Fatherland\" IV degree, in 1992 - the Boris Petrov Gold Medal of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in 2008 - the Sergei Korolev Gold Medal of the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn addition, Boris Evseevich was a laureate of the Lenin Prize (1957) for participation in the creation of the first artificial satellites of the Earth, and a laureate of the State Prize of the USSR (1976) for participation in the implementation of the Soyuz-Apollo project.\n\nAt the end of 2011, Academician Chertok was awarded the International Prize of St. Andrew the First-Called \"For Faith and Loyalty\" for his outstanding contribution to the development and development of rocket and space science and industry in Russia.\n\nAt the beginning of the era of astronautics, Sergei Pavlovich Korolev gathered the best personnel throughout the country for an enterprise that would determine the fate of our country for centuries to come. These people became the same legendary designers who launched a man into space, opening a new chapter in the life of mankind. Where did they live? After all, they and their families could not live permanently in the most difficult conditions of Baikonur?\n\nThe quarter between Frunze, Tsiolkovsky, Karl Marx and Lesnaya streets became the first post-war quarter to be rebuilt in Podlipki - in the central part of the city\n\nAmong the inhabitants of the quarter you can find:\n\n1. General Designer of OKB-1;\n\n2. The closest associates and friends of Sergei Pavlovich Korolev;\n\n3. Employees of party, state and local authorities;\n\n4. Honorary citizens of the city.\n\nFor example,\n\nVasily Pavlovich Mishin- Rocket constructor space technology. One of the founders of Soviet practical cosmonautics. Colleague of S.P. Korolev, who continued his work in the field of astronautics. General Designer of OKB-1 (OKB-1 - TsKBEM, later - NPO Energia); Hero of Socialist Labor; Laureate of the Lenin and State Prizes of the USSR; Honored Inventor of the RSFSR; Academician of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR; Member of the International Academy of Astronautics; Lecturer at the Department of Design and Construction of Spacecraft at the Moscow Aviation Institute named after Sergo Ordzhonikidze.\n\nAlexei Mikhailovich Isaev- Soviet design engineer, associate of S.P.

Laureate of the Lenin Prize.\n\nLeonid Alexandrovich Voskresensky- Deputy Korolev for testing, Soviet rocket technology test scientist, one of the closest associates of S.P. Korolev, professor, doctor of technical sciences. In 1954-1963, L. A. Voskresensky was the deputy chief designer of OKB-1 (the chief designer was S. P. Korolev). Participated in the unique development and testing of domestic rocket artillery and rocket and space technology, supervised the launches of all types of missiles developed during this period in OKB-1, including the first intercontinental combat missiles 8K71 (R-7), 8K74 (R-7A) and 8K75 (R-9, R-9A), capable of carrying a nuclear charge, as well as space launch vehicles 8K72 (Vostok) and 8K78 (Molniya)\n\nAnatoly Petrovich Abramov- one of the leading specialists in ground equipment of rocket and space technology of the Soviet Union, diplomat, doctor of technical sciences, professor, laureate of the Lenin Prize, associate of Sergei Pavlovich Korolev. Laureate of the Lenin Prize; Doctor of Technical Sciences; Professor of the Moscow Aviation Institute named after Sergo Ordzhonikidze; mechanical engineer; Head of Department, Head of the Complex, Deputy Chief (General) Designer of OKB-1 (Central Design Bureau of Experimental Engineering, Research and Production Association \"Energy\"); supervisor thematic direction, Senior Researcher,\n\nscientific consultant of the Rocket and Space Corporation Energia named after S.P.

Last years before OKB-1, he worked in the apparatus of the Council of Ministers, and then in the Ministry of Medium Machine Building - the Atomic Ministry. But he was again very drawn to rocketry. He realized that the apparatus activity was not for him. He quickly agreed with Korolev and was appointed deputy to Svyatoslav Lavrov, head of the design and ballistic department. Sadovsky persuaded volunteers and assembled a small \"illegal\" group to prepare proposals for solid fuel ballistic missiles (BRTTs). The main core is three young specialists: Verbin, Sungurov and Titov. Later, Igor Nikolaevich Sadovsky was appointed chief designer of the modernized solid-propellant rocket of the 8K98P complex.\n\nThis is only 6 people, but in fact there are about 30 of them. Everyone deserves at least a commemorative plaque. Click on the image to open it in full size.\n\nThey want to demolish the quarter where these great people lived because the houses there are old and too lazy to repair them. Residents of the quarter (4 people) and city activists (3 people) wrote an album about the history of the quarter, which was submitted to the Administration, the Council of Deputies, the Head of the city, local residents. Because of \"No money, but you hold on\" It is easier for the administration to demolish and build new and nice houses than to reconstruct the old ones following the example of house No. 15.\n\nNow, not a single building in the quarter is included in either the list of dilapidated housing stock or the list of emergency stock. Recently, the Head of the Queen came to the quarter to communicate with residents, and then wrote on his Instagram \"Following the instructions of Governor Andrey Vorobyov @andreyvorobiev, I held a meeting with residents of the historical center of our city, Frunze and Lesnaya St.\", thus recognizing its historical value, however, neither in the plots of \"Korolev-tv\" nor in the plots of the \"360\" channel was there ever mentioned either a historical center or a word about famous residents, plots in the style \"All for demolition\" are shown even those who are against it. If the quarter is a historical center, then its fate is the interest of all residents of the city, without exception.\n\nYesterday they demolished (and thank God) the wood sheds that were built 70 years ago. Surely they will make a parking lot or a playground there, which is certainly good, because 5 months ago no one wanted to deal with some two-story buildings in the depths of a quarter of the historical center of the city. Now the situation has changed.\n\nThis Thursday (September 8) at 20:00 Mayor Alexander Khodyrev will be on the air of Korolev-TV, where he will answer questions from the audience. This Friday (September 9) meeting working group on architecture and urban planning, chaired by the first deputy head of the Administration Oleg Danilenko, beginning at 14:30 in the Kostino Palace of Culture. Politely and calmly, but persistently, we will defend the right to the history of the city in which we live.\n\nCandidate of Technical Sciences L. MATIYASEVICH\n\nS. P. Korolev at the training ground during tests of the Pe-2r aircraft with a missile\n\nDeputy S.P. Koroleva, Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR Konstantin Davydovich Bushuev (1914-1978).\n\nDeputy S.P. Korolev Pavel Vladimirovich Tsybin (1905-1992).\n\nHead of the design department of OKB-1 Evgeny Fedorovich Ryazanov (1923-1975).\n\nDuring the period of the Soyuz-Apollo program, the Soviet delegation was invited to visit the NASA ranch in the USA.\n\nOnly 20-30 years ago it seemed that the name of Sergei Pavlovich Korolev - the creator of the first artificial satellite of the Earth, the Vostok spacecraft, which lifted the first of earthlings into space, and the other most advanced space technology - would forever remain in the memory of the people. However, not every current schoolboy and student knows Korolev, Gagarin, and other pioneers in the Universe, who until recently the whole country was proud of. Here is an example. Many readers of \"Science and Life\" are probably watching the popular TV program \"Oh, lucky!\", Trying to answer a variety of questions from the host Dmitry Dibrov together with the players and get to win a million rubles. One of the questions of the program shown by NTV last autumn was: \"Which country launched the first artificial Earth satellite into space: the USA, China, Russia, India?\" \"USA\" - was the answer of a student of the Faculty of Economics of Moscow State University. The representative of the most educated part of our youth did not know what it was outstanding achievement belongs to her country, Russia. Memoirs about S.P. Korolev and his associates, sent to the editorial office by the researcher of the Central House of Aviation and Cosmonautics Leonty Mikhailovich Matiyasevich, are addressed primarily to the younger generation and, of course, to all those who want to know more about the history of Russian cosmonautics.\n\nAmong the outstanding scientists of the twentieth century, one of the leading places rightfully belongs to the founder of practical cosmonautics, the General Designer of space technology, Sergei Pavlovich Korolev. Many books and articles have been written about him. Meanwhile, today, when space flights have become almost an ordinary event, most people no longer know that the first outstanding achievements of the USSR in space exploration are associated with his name.\n\nOn August 21, 1957, the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile was flown. Appearance in our midst cold war such a formidable type of weapon played important role in keeping the peace in the coming years. After all, up to this point, already having nuclear weapons, we had no means of delivering them, and US strategic bombers were close to our borders. On October 4 of the same year, Tsiolkovsky's bold dream came true: for the first time in the history of mankind, an artificial satellite of the Earth was launched. This was followed by the first space flight of Yuri Gagarin, flights of other manned spacecraft \"Vostok\" and \"Voskhod\", the first manned spacewalk, flights to the Moon, Venus, Mars ... The creator of this most advanced space technology in the world is the General designer Sergei Pavlovich Korolev. Under his leadership, satellites of the Elektron, Molniya-1, Kosmos series and the project of the Soyuz spacecraft were also developed, on which docking with the American Apollo spacecraft was carried out for the first time in orbit.\n\nIn the spring of 1960, I, a military specialist, had the good fortune to meet, and then for many years to cooperate with, Experimental Design Bureau No. 1 (OKB-1), led by Sergei Pavlovich Korolev. Leading figures of science and technology and talented young people worked side by side in this unique team. The spirit of constant creative search reigned here, independence and initiative were valued. Of course, this was the merit of Sergei Pavlovich, he knew how to unite around him talented, dedicated people, never suppressed them with his authority, but, on the contrary, created conditions for the development of the abilities of everyone.\n\nSimplicity and democracy in dealing with subordinates were combined in him with firmness and exactingness in work. Korolev could easily approach any ordinary employee and discuss the issue with him. Despite the fact that Sergei Pavlovich had great power as the head of several thousands of collectives, he enjoyed great authority in the government and the Central Committee\n\nCPSU, one could argue with him. In the interests of the cause, he agreed with the opponent, even if it was contrary to his own plans.\n\nSergei Pavlovich had a brilliant organizational talent, colossal capacity for work, self-control and endurance. I saw him at the Baikonur cosmodrome during the preparation and implementation of the first ever group flight of two spacecraft. On August 12, 1962, Vostok-3 was launched into orbit, piloted by cosmonaut Andrian Nikolaev, and a day later Vostok-4 was launched with cosmonaut Pavel Popovich. At that time, the experience of controlling spacecraft was still small. One can only imagine the degree of responsibility of a person, on whose decisions the success of two space flights at once depended! Meanwhile, Korolyov did not show any signs of excitement, fuss, haste. He appeared only where and when his participation was really needed. I remember that Sergei Pavlovich invited us, employees of allied enterprises, to the assembly and test building, showed us the spacecraft that was supposed to fly to Venus, and spoke about plans for future flights. On the same days, Korolev held a technical meeting on issues completely unrelated to the upcoming flights. In the dining room at dinner he was always friendly, remembered funny stories, joked.\n\nGeneral Designer Korolyov had many brilliant assistants, and I worked closely with some of them.\n\nOne of Sergei Pavlovich's deputies, Corresponding Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences Konstantin Davydovich Bushuev in those years was known only to a narrow circle of people, just like Korolev, he was a secret person. An intelligent, charming man, Bushuev at the same time was distinguished by firmness and determination. Later, in 1975, he became widely known as the head of the Soviet-American Soyuz-Apollo project from the USSR.\n\nAnother deputy of S.P. Korolev is Pavel Vladimirovich Tsybin. In the past, an aircraft designer who headed his own design bureau, he had extensive knowledge, clearly and quickly interacted with industrial enterprises. Tsybin knew how to organize the business in such a way that the development, manufacture and delivery to OKB-1 of the necessary samples of equipment were carried out in an unprecedentedly short time. Under him, work that would normally take years was completed in a matter of months.\n\nThe soul of all our working and informal meetings was one of the developers of spaceships, the head of the design department of OKB-1 Evgeny Fedorovich Ryazanov. A prominent specialist in his field, an erudite, broad-minded person, he knew and understood the specifics of the work of subcontractors, always supported new ideas and proposals, he himself was their generator and never tried to avoid solving difficult problems. In co-authorship with G. A. Skuridin in 1959 and 1961, E. F. Ryazanov wrote two monographs: \"Soviet satellites and space rockets\" and \"Soviet satellites and space ships\" (the works were published under pseudonyms: S. G. Alexandrov and\n\nR. E. Fedorov), was the author of several articles for the encyclopedic dictionary. E. F. Ryazanov stood at the origins of practical astronautics, and the orbital stations and spacecraft flying today have a large share of his work and talent.\n\nLike other associates of Sergei Pavlovich, Bushuev, Tsybin, Ryazanov were bright independent personalities. The ability to choose such assistants characterizes the Queen as an outstanding administrator.\n\nThe last time I saw Sergei Pavlovich was on December 23, 1965, when the 60th birthday of Pavel Vladimirovich Tsybin was celebrated in OKB-1. Almost\n\nall leaders of industrial and military teams who worked in the field of astronautics and aviation. Almost every one of them was a bright, memorable personality. Orators succeeded each other, competing in eloquence and wit. Jokes, puns, exotic souvenirs for the memory of the hero of the day. Full of strength and energy, cheerful and uninhibited, Sergei Pavlovich Korolev conducted all this festive action. He would have turned sixty next year. We thought about how this anniversary would be celebrated... But less than a month later, on January 14, 1966, Sergei Pavlovich passed away. Korolev went to the hospital to clarify the diagnosis, it seemed that nothing foreshadowed a tragic outcome, but he was not destined to get up with operating table. S.P. Korolev passed away, but left his mark on the Earth. An outstanding scientist and designer, he was a pioneer in space exploration. It is unfortunate that today's youth, for the most part, no longer knows about this.\n\nAn outstanding designer and scientist who worked in the field of rocket and rocket and space technology. Twice Hero of Socialist Labor, laureate of the Lenin Prize, Academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences, he is the creator of domestic strategic missile weapons of medium and intercontinental range and the founder of practical astronautics. His design developments in the field of rocket technology are of exceptional value for the development of domestic missile weapons, and in the field of astronautics they are of world importance. He is rightfully the father of domestic rocket and space technology, which provided a strategic priority and made our state an advanced rocket and space power.\n\nS.P. Korolev in touch with Yu.A. Gagarin\n\nSeryozha Korolyov was born on January 12, 1907 in Ukraine, in the city of Zhytomyr, in the family of a literature teacher.\n\nhouse of the Korolevs in Zhytomyr\n\nFather Pavel Yakovlevich Korolyov - graduated with honors from the Nizhyn Historical and Philological Institute and received the title of teacher of the gymnasium. However, life together with his mother Maria Nikolaevna Moskalenko did not work out from the very beginning.\n\nmother - M.N. Moskalenko father - P.Ya. Korolev\n\nSoon, after moving to Kyiv, the parents separated. Serezha was brought up in the family of his mother's parents in the city of Nizhyn. Grandfather and grandmother loved their grandson very much, they did not have a soul in him. Maria Nikolaevna at that time fulfilled her long-standing desire - she entered the Higher Women's Courses.\n\nIn Nizhyn in 1911, Serezha first saw the flight of the Russian pilot Utochkin on an airplane. The rumbling huge bird shook the imagination of the impressionable boy and gave rise to such sprouts in his soul that, ten years later, Sergei Korolev forever took possession of his whole being.\n\nSerezha did not remember his father. He was raised by his mother - a teacher and stepfather Grigory Mikhailovich Balanin - an engineer. In 1917, Serezha and his mother moved to Odessa to live with his stepfather, where he got a job. In 1921, a detachment of hydroplanes HYDRO-3 of the Main Directorate of the Air Force appeared in Odessa. Sergey, with bated breath, watched their flight over the sea and, of course, dreamed of at least once climbing into the sky on them. The case brought the teenager to the mechanic of the hydro detachment Vasily Dolganov - four years older than him. Seryozha watched with interest as deftly a new acquaintance delved into the motor, explaining to him what was happening. After the first “lecture” the “practice” began. From now on, he spent all the summer time in the hydro detachment, helping to prepare aircraft for flights. Having studied the engine, Korolev became an indispensable, trouble-free assistant. For this, he was loved by all mechanics and pilots.\n\nThe average general education he could not get it right away - there were no conditions. He graduated from a two-year professional construction school. Seryozha studied diligently, enthusiastically. The class teacher spoke about him to his mother Maria Nikolaevna: “A guy with a king in his head.”\n\nAll this time, he did not interrupt his acquaintance with the mechanic Dolganov and pilots from the hydro-aviation detachment. Under the patronage of Dolganov, Sergei once took to the air, and even in a seaplane, which was led by the commander himself. The young man decided to become a pilot. Soon the glory of a real mechanic was entrenched in Sergey. Flight followed flight. Sergei never refused to fly.\n\nDuring these years, Sergei Korolev had another passion. For hours he worked in the school production workshop, where wooden products were made. The Carpentry School came in handy for Sergei when he started building gliders.\n\nIn 1923, the government appealed to the people to build their own Air Fleet. The Society of Aviation and Aeronautics of Ukraine and Crimea (OAVUK) was born in Ukraine.\n\nSerezha immediately became a member of this society and began to study in one of its glider circles. He lectured workers on gliding. The young man acquired knowledge of gliding, the history of aviation on his own, reading all the books, including those on German that he could get. Thanks to his stepfather and teacher of the construction vocational school, Gottlieb Karlovich Ave, who taught all the lessons in German, Sergei Korolev knew German quite well. Knowledge of the language was firmly entrenched in him for life.\n\nWhen the construction of a glider designed by the famous military pilot K.A. Artseulov began in the workshops of the OAVUK, Sergei Korolev also took part in the work on it. In April 1924, he participated in the first conference of glider pilots in Odessa.\n\nAt this time in May, an event very important for the history of astronautics took place in Moscow: the world's first Society for the Study of Interplanetary Communications (OIMS) was founded. F.E. Dzerzhinsky and K.E. Tsiolkovsky were elected its honorary members. The main task of this society was to promote the work on the implementation of extra-atmospheric flights with the help of jet vehicles and other scientifically based means.\n\nIt should be noted that at the end of the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century in Russia there was an interest in the surrounding stellar world. It was fueled by science fiction. Mastering the minds, they contributed to the emergence of scientific and technical ideas. The little-known Russian researcher K.E. Tsiolkovsky created the space work “Investigation of the World Spaces with Reactive Instruments”, publishing it in 1903.\n\nKonstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky\n\nIn it, the scientist first developed the theory of jet propulsion and, on its basis, proved that a liquid-fuel rocket of the scheme proposed by him is capable of reaching the speed necessary to overcome the earth's gravity.\n\nIn those distant years for us, people read out the fantastic story “Beyond the Earth” by K.E. Tsiolkovsky and especially A. Tolstoy’s novel “Aelita”. There were long queues to cinemas and clubs where a film based on this work was shown. The audience warmly applauded the engineer Mstislav Los and the recent Red Army soldier Alexei Gusev, who dared to go to Mars. It was fantastic. But there lived a real Elk, who developed a spaceship-airplane - our compatriot Friedrich Arturovich Zander, a follower of Tsiolkovsky's ideas. Another engineer, Yuri Vasilyevich Kondratyuk, a theoretician of astronautics, was thinking about the work \"To those who will read in order to build.\" But Sergei Korolev had not yet read either Tsiolkovsky or Zander, had not heard anything about Kondratyuk. All of them will enter his life later, earning his deep respect.\n\nThus, after graduating from school, Sergei worked as a carpenter, tiled the roofs, later switched to a machine tool, to production. The work experience of the Chief Designer began at the age of sixteen. “I will be a builder ... but only aircraft,” Korolev said in those years. Maria Nikolaevna in her heart resisted her son's passion, expressing fears about the danger of the path of life he had chosen. The sensible stepfather, on the contrary, treated him calmly. In his stepfather, Sergei found support for his aspirations.\n\nGoal oriented\n\nSerezha dreamed of getting a higher education; he dreamed of studying at the Air Force Academy in Moscow. But people who had served in the Red Army and reached the age of 18 were accepted there. Sergey could have been helped by a certificate from the Odessa Regional Department of the OAVUK about the submission to the aviation technical department of the project of the non-motorized K-5 aircraft designed by him, which, along with a petition for her son, was brought to the leadership of the academy by Maria Nikolaevna. However, the uncertainty about admission to the Moscow Academy remained. And Sergei decided to enter the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, where at that time it was supposed to begin training aviation engineers at the Faculty of Mechanics.\n\nS.P. Korolev - student\n\nAmong the students of the Faculty of Mechanics, Sergei was considered one of the youngest and most educated. Worked at the same time. Whom only Sergey was not during these years: a peddler of newspapers, and a loader, and a carpenter, and a roofer. But he still barely made ends meet. In a letter to his mother in Odessa, Sergey wrote: “I get up early in the morning, at five o'clock. I run to the editorial office, pick up the newspapers, and then run to Solomenka, deliver them. So I earn eight karbovanets. And I’m even thinking of taking the corner off.”\n\nThere was a glider circle at the institute. His work was followed and helped by many prominent scientists who taught at the KPI. Sergei Korolev became a member. He worked, like everyone else, hard and enthusiastically. Often at night. Korolev sometimes slept right in the workshop on shavings. He loved to work and was known as a jack of all trades. After that, nothing was ever changed.\n\nGliders built in the institute's workshops participated in international competitions, receiving the highest marks. At the same time, the circle members had a rule: who built the glider, he flew on it.\n\nA training glider KPIR-3 was built, Korolev also invested a share of his work in it. Sergey flew on it. One of the flights nearly cost him his life. On the border of the site - a wasteland where the gliders were tested, a water pipe stuck out of a pile of garbage. Sergei did not notice and landed the glider on ... her. The blow was strong enough. Korolev lost consciousness for some time. Stayed up for a few days.\n\nBuild rockets and fly them\n\nIn 1926, after studying for two years at the KPI, Sergei Korolev transferred to Moscow to a special evening group in aeromechanics at the Moscow Higher Technical School. During the day he worked either in a design bureau or at an aircraft factory, and in the evening he studied. By this time, his mother and stepfather had moved to Moscow.\n\nWith all his might, Korolev strove for aviation. As soon as he entered the Moscow Higher Technical School, Sergey immediately joined the work of the student circle AKNEZH - Academic Circle. Nikolai Egorovich Zhukovsky. Engineers and scientists gave lectures there.\n\nAviation spread its wings wider and wider. The youth passionately rushed to the sky. In January 1927, the solemn opening of the Moscow glider school took place in the Gorki Leninskiye area. Sergei Korolev also became her cadet. He flew a lot and willingly, mastering new types of gliders. From flight to flight, the flying skills of the cadets grew, and along with them, their characters also matured. A pilot cannot do without such qualities as purposefulness, responsibility, composure, endurance. Sergei had a hard time, but it was a good school.\n\nIn March 1927, Sergei graduated with honors from the glider school. One thing he has already achieved, he learned to fly a glider. Further, his task was to gain knowledge and ... build aircraft.\n\nWith particular impatience, Sergei Korolev waited for the lectures of the then-famous thirty-five-year-old aviation designer Andrei Nikolaevich Tupolev. He taught students a course on aircraft engineering. For students, Andrei Nikolaevich is an indisputable authority. After all, his planes had already plowed the sky by that time.\n\nIn May 1927, at the international exhibition of interplanetary vehicles, Sergei first got acquainted with the works of F.A. Zander and a brochure by K.E. Tsiolkovsky \"Research of world spaces by jet devices\". Books, drawings, diagrams, handicraft models - everything that was shown at the exhibition touched Korolev's mind. Since that time, he has become more focused on rockets and space flights.\n\nHowever, all his thoughts were still absorbed by planes and gliders. A graduate student of the Moscow Higher Technical School Korolev had an internship at the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI), at the Design Bureau of A.N. Tupolev. At this time, he was already working at an aircraft factory in Fili. Simultaneously cooked thesis project, deciding to design a light-engine two-seat aircraft SK-4, squeezing everything possible out of it.\n\nThe project of the SK-4 aircraft, designed for a record-breaking flight range, turned out to be original, thought out to the smallest detail and worked out at the level of a mature specialist. A.N. became the project manager. Tupolev, signing it subsequently from the first presentation. This did not happen in the practice of students. The rigor and scrupulousness of the designer were known. Approved by A.N. Tupolev, the project of a single-engine two-seat aircraft SK-4 was then built and tested.\n\nIn September 1929, Sergei Korolev and his colleague Sergei Lyushin presented an unusual glider at the VI All-Union Gliding Competition in Koktebel, about 50-90 kg heavier than their counterparts. At the time, it was believed that the smaller the glider, the better. A test flight on the Koktebel was made by K.K. Artseulov, reporting to the members technical committee: “The airframe is well balanced. Handles well. May be allowed to fly.\" On the Koktebel glider, twenty-two-year-old Korolev set a soaring record. He hovered in the air for more than four hours.\n\nIn October 1930, at the All-Union meeting of glider pilots S.P. Korolev came out with a new SK-3 glider, which he called the Red Star. Its load per square meter was greater than that of Koktebel - 22.5 kg. The data of the glider was so unusual that the possibility of soaring in the air itself was called into question. However, it was on it that, for the first time in the history of aviation, test pilot V.A. Stepanchenok, an experienced glider pilot, made the famous Nesterov's loop in free flight.\n\nKorolev was not present at the competitions, he was suddenly struck down by severe typhus. As a result of a complication, severe headaches appeared, and a craniotomy operation was required. She was successful, but remained a difficult test not only for Sergei, but for everyone who loved him.\n\nAfter the illness, the body of the Queen was so weakened that he had to leave work for several months. But as soon as it became easier, Sergei enthusiastically set to work K.E. Tsiolkovsky \"Jet Airplane\".\n\nS. Korolev was still interested in aviation, but the desire to find means to fly higher, faster, farther led him to the idea of ​​​​investigating the possibilities of jet propulsion. He agreed with K.E. Tsiolkovsky: \"The era of propeller-driven airplanes should be followed by the era of jet airplanes, or stratospheric airplanes.\"\n\nFor the benefit of humanity\n\nIn March 1931, Sergei Pavlovich Korolev returned to work at TsAGI, combining work in the Jet Propulsion Study Group (GIRD). It was created in August 1931 under the Bureau of Air Engineering of the Central Council of Osoaviakhim (DOSAAF) in the year of the 75th anniversary of the birth of K.E. Tsiolkovsky. GIRD became the center where all those interested in rocket technology flocked. F.A. was appointed its leader. Zander, who played an important role in the development of theoretical and practical issues of space navigation. The technical council was headed by S.P. Korolev. The age of employees, with a few exceptions, did not exceed twenty-five years. The GIRD was located in an abandoned basement at 19 Sadovo-Spasskaya Street.\n\nThe idea of ​​creating jet engines excited many minds in those years outside the USSR. But the first, main impetus was given by Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky, it was he who came up with the idea of ​​​​birth of a jet engine running on liquid fuel. In the 1920s, work in this direction was carried out by the German scientist Oberth, the American professor Goddard, and others.\n\nThe work of the guilders was crowned with success. On August 17, 1933, at the Nakhabino training ground near Moscow, the first Soviet GIRD-09 rocket designed by M.K. Tikhonravov on liquid fuel. The rocket rose to a height of 400 meters, the flight duration was 18 seconds.\n\nMikhail Klavdievich Tikhonravov\n\nBut this luck made the Girdians finally believe in their strength. Unfortunately, F.A. Zander, who was the soul of the whole thing, never saw the launch of the rocket. Shortly before that, on March 28, he died, he died of typhus while on vacation in Kislovodsk. By a special resolution, the Central Council of Osoaviahima named the GIRD after F.A. Zander.\n\nIn 1933, the dream of rocket enthusiasts finally came true to create a single rocket center. Cutting off all bureaucratic obstacles, by personal order of the Revolutionary Military Council M.N. Tukhachevsky, who had a deep understanding of fundamentally new work, the GIRD and the Leningrad Gas Dynamics Laboratory (GDL) were merged into the Reactive Research Institute (RNII). I.T. was appointed head of the institute. Kleimenov (head of the GDL), his deputy for scientific work - S.P. Korolev. He was given the title of Divisional Engineer (according to modern concepts- the rank of lieutenant general of the technical troops). high rank at 26 years old!\n\nAt the same time, S.P. Korolev and M.K. Tikhonravov were awarded the highest award of the defense society - the badge \"For active defense work.\"\n\nIn 1934, the first printed work of S.P. Koroleva \"Rocket flight in the stratosphere\". “A missile is a very serious weapon,” the author warned in his work. A copy of the book was sent by Sergei Pavlovich to K.E. Tsiolkovsky. Soon Osoaviakhim received a letter from Tsiolkovsky with a review of Korolev's work: \"The book is reasonable, informative and useful.\" The scientist only complained that the author did not give his address and deprived him of the opportunity to personally thank for the book.\n\nhard trials\n\nIn those years, people's enthusiasm knew no bounds. Gradually, a solid scientific and technical base was created for rocket enthusiasts. But at the same time, Stalin's personality cult began to take shape. The approach of war was also felt. The attention of many scientists was increasingly focused on defense issues. Many purely scientific ideas had to be put aside. Korolev dreamed of coming to grips with the rocket plane, but his plan then was not destined to come true.\n\nNot everything went smoothly in the newly created institute. Disagreements were revealed regarding the primary tasks of the Rocket Institute between I.T. Kleimenov and S.P. Korolev, as a result of which the Queen was removed to the ordinary position of senior engineer.\n\nIn the autumn of 1937, a wave of repression and arbitrariness that swept the country reached the RNII.\n\nAmong other “military conspirators”, M.N. Tukhachevsky. The cleaning of their near and far surroundings began. The head of the Central Design Bureau (TsKB-29), specially created by the people's commissariat, A.N. was arrested and placed behind bars. Tupolev. Not only Tupolev ended up in this closed Central Design Bureau, but also the “enemies of the people” arrested on slander - famous designers in the aviation world V.M. Myasishchev, V.M. Petlyakov, R.L. Bartini and others. In Moscow, on Radio Street, a seven-story TsAGI building was converted into a prison for them, allocating rooms for housing and design work. Specialists here worked not out of fear, but out of conscience, realizing that their cause was necessary for the country, and firmly believing that they would soon sort it out and make sure of their innocence.\n\nIn the RNII, S.P. was the first to feel the tangible blows of this inexorable wave. Korolev.\n\nOn September 25, 1938, Korolev was included in the list of persons subject to trial by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. In the list, he went to the first (execution) category. The list was endorsed by Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov and Kaganovich.\n\nIt was a time of change in the leadership of the NKVD and the repressions had already reduced their scope. Therefore, the court decisions did not so blindly follow the recommendations of the NKVD. Korolev was convicted by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on September 27, 1938, charge: art. 58-7, 11. Sentence: 10 years of labor camp, 5 years of disqualification. On June 10, 1940, the term was reduced to 8 years in labor camp (Sevzheldorlag), released in 1944. Fully rehabilitated April 18, 1957\n\nOn April 21, 1939, he ended up in Kolyma, where he was at the Maldyak gold mine of the Western Mining Directorate and was employed in the so-called \"general work\". December 23, 1939 sent to the disposal of Vladlag.\n\nHe arrived in Moscow on March 2, 1940, where four months later he was tried a second time by a Special Conference, sentenced to 8 years in prison and sent to the Moscow special prison of the NKVD TsKB-29, where, under the leadership of A. N. Tupolev, also a prisoner, he took an active part in the creation Pe-2 and Tu-2 bombers and at the same time actively developed projects for a guided air torpedo and a new version of a missile interceptor.\n\nThis was the reason for the transfer of S.P. Korolev in 1942 to another prison-type design bureau - OKB-16 at the Kazan Aviation Plant No. engines of new types for the purpose of their application in aviation. Here S. P. Korolev, with his characteristic enthusiasm, gives himself up to the idea practical use rocket engines to improve aviation: reducing the length of the takeoff run of an aircraft and increasing the speed and dynamic characteristics of aircraft during air combat. At the beginning of 1943, he was appointed chief designer of the group of rocket launchers. He was engaged in improving the technical characteristics of the Pe-2 dive bomber, the first flight of which took place in October 1943.\n\nAccording to the memoirs attributed to L. L. Kerber, S. P. Korolev was a skeptic, a cynic and a pessimist who looked absolutely gloomy at the future, “Slam without an obituary,” was his favorite phrase. Along with this, there is a statement by pilot-cosmonaut Alexei Leonov regarding S.P. Korolev: “He was never embittered ... He never complained, did not curse anyone, did not scold. He didn't have time for that. He understood that anger causes not a creative impulse, but oppression.\n\nIn July 1944, S.P. Korolev was released from prison ahead of schedule with the removal of a criminal record, after which he worked for another year in Kazan.\n\nSergey Pavlovich worked, according to the recollections of the “cellmates”, furiously, quickly, organically merging into the common cause. He participated in the construction of a dive bomber under the guidance of Tupolev himself, whom he considered the most respected aviation teacher. Here in the Central Design Bureau he met the beginning of the war, then evacuated with everyone to Omsk. Korolev asked to be a pilot for the front, but Tupolev, who had already been released from prison by that time, having recognized and appreciated him even better, did not let him go, saying: “And who will build the aircraft?”\n\nKorolev, like a sponge, absorbed everything new that appeared in the aircraft industry, without losing hope that the experience gained would be useful to him. Soon Korolev was appointed deputy head of the assembly shop for Tu-2. It was great trust. But the idea of ​​creating a jet aircraft did not leave him. Then he did not yet know that despite all the difficulties, in February 1940, flight tests of the first rocket glider with a liquid rocket engine took place in our country. True, he was led by a towing aircraft. But it was a very important fact and the first step in the development of jet aviation. Prior to this flight, the world practice did not yet know such an experience. He rendered positive influence for jet flights. In 1942, the first aircraft with a BI-1 jet engine was raised. It was piloted by test pilot Grigory Bakhchivandzhi.\n\nGrigory Yakovlevich Bakhchivandzhi\n\nRocket plane BI-1\n\nNow the well-known aircraft designed by Andrey Nikolaevich Tupolev, Sergey Vladimirovich Ilyushin, Oleg Konstantinovich Antonov fly in all directions of the globe. Multi-seat passenger liners conquer air space at speeds up to a thousand kilometers per hour. This speed is achieved through the use of heat engines operating on the principle of jet propulsion.\n\nThe opportunity to do much more for the development of jet technology was long before the war, but, unfortunately, among the major military experts at that time, not everyone understood the great future of the jet engine. It is easy to imagine how the course of the war would have changed if jet aircraft and artillery rocket launchers had been put into production two or three years before the start of the fascist invasion of our Motherland. The war could have been won with less bloodshed.\n\nMeanwhile, S.P. The Queen was released from prison in August 1944. At this time, he was already working with V.P. Glushko in Kazan at the aircraft engine building plant. Worked out liquid jet engines as boosters for combat aircraft. Even then, their use gave an increase in speed by 180-200 kilometers per hour.\n\nThere was a war, and it was too early to think about returning home to Moscow. Only in August 1945 did he leave Kazan forever.\n\nChief designer\n\nOn May 13, 1946, a decision was made to create in the USSR an industry for the development and production of rocket weapons with liquid rocket engines. In accordance with the same resolution, it was planned to unite all groups of Soviet engineers for the study of German V-2 rocket weapons, who had worked in Germany since 1945, into a single Nordhausen Research Institute, whose director was Major General L.M. Gaidukov, and S.P. Korolev as chief engineer-technical manager. In Germany, Sergei Pavlovich not only studies the German V-2 rocket, but also designs a more advanced ballistic missile with a range of up to 600 km.\n\nSoon, all Soviet specialists will return to the Soviet Union to the research institutes and experimental design bureaus created in accordance with the above-mentioned May government decree. In August 1946, S.P. Korolev was appointed chief designer of long-range ballistic missiles and head of department No. 3 of NII-88 for their development.\n\nSCIENTIFIC ACTIVITY QUEEN\n\nThe first task set by the government for S.P. Korolev as the chief designer and all organizations involved in rocket weapons was to create an analogue of the V-2 rocket from domestic materials.\n\nBut already in 1947, a decree was issued on the development of new ballistic missiles with a greater range than the V-2: up to 3000 km. In 1948, S.P. Korolev begins flight and design tests of the R-1 ballistic missile (an analogue of the V-2) and in 1950 successfully puts it into service. This rocket differed from the German one in much greater reliability.\n\nIn parallel, S.P. Korolev is developing a new V-2 ballistic missile with a range of 600 km. The R-2 rocket had a carrying fuel tank, a more convenient layout for operation and, most importantly, a warhead that separated in flight. In addition, the rocket propulsion system was significantly improved in order to increase its thrust, and the autonomous control system had twice the accuracy of fire. The R-2 missile was put into service in 1951, i.e., only a year later than the R-1 missile.\n\nstart R-2\n\nTactical and technical characteristics of the R-2 (8Zh38) ballistic missile.\n\nTogether with practical work on rocket weapons at NII-88, under the scientific guidance of S. I. Korolev, large-scale design and experimental studies were launched on topics H-I, H-2, H-3 in order to create a scientific and technical reserve for the development of qualitatively new ballistic missiles.\n\nOn the topic H-1 were carried out experimentally - theoretical studies of the main technical problems associated with the implementation of the R-3 rocket project, which has a flight range of 3000 km: it was necessary to ensure the stability of the rocket flight without a stabilizer (aerodynamically unstable) circuit and to obtain data on the behavior of boiling liquid oxygen in a thermally uninsulated oxidizer carrier tank during movement on the active section of the trajectory at increased external heat fluxes into the mass of liquid oxygen. On the basis of the design solutions of the R-2 rocket with the use of its forced engine, a single-stage experimental BR R-ZA was created without a stabilizer circuit with a flight range of 1200 km. Successful flight tests of this missile gave grounds to the Ministry of Defense to accept it into service in 1956 with a nuclear warhead as the R-5M. It was the first domestic strategic missile, which became the basis of the country's nuclear missile shield.\n\nP-5 at the starting position\n\nOn the topic H-2, studies were carried out on the possibility and expediency of creating ballistic missiles operating on stable high-boiling fuel components (using nitric acid with nitrogen oxides as an oxidizer). As a result, the possibility of creating such missiles was confirmed and a preliminary design of the first Russian BR R-11 with a range of 250 km and a launch weight half that of the R-1 was completed. However, taking into account the environmental toxicity of nitric oxides and the lower energy characteristics of a stable liquid fuel compared to fuel based on liquid oxygen and kerosene, as well as the resulting serious problems With the development of rocket engines with the required thrust (greater than 8 tons) that operate stably on these fuel components, it was found expedient to use a nitric acid oxidizer with nitrogen oxides for ballistic missiles with a relatively short flight range. When creating rockets with a longer flight range, and especially intercontinental ones, it was recommended to use liquid oxygen as an oxidizer. Sergey Pavlovich proved to be faithful to this direction of development of rocket technology throughout his entire creative activity.\n\nThe Ministry of Defense instructed OKB-1 NII-88 to develop the N-11 rocket, and S. P. Korolev brilliantly solved this problem by using the 8-ton engine A. M. Isaev had just created for an anti-aircraft missile and for the first time using a liquid pressure accumulator for supply fuel into the combustion chamber.\n\nOn the basis of the R-11, S.P. Korolev developed and put into service in 1957 the R-11M strategic missile with a nuclear warhead, transported in a refueled form on a tank chassis. Having seriously modified this missile, he adapted it for arming submarines (PL) as the R-11FM. The changes were more than serious, as was done new system control and aiming, as well as the possibility of firing at a fairly strong excitement seas from the surface position of the submarine, i.e. with strong pitching. Thus, Sergei Pavlovich created the first ballistic missiles on stable mobile ground and sea-based fuel components and was a pioneer in these new and important directions in the development of missile weapons.\n\nSelf-propelled missile system \"Filin\"\n\nTTD R-11\n\nWarhead weight:\n\nR-11 - 540 kg (in the process of testing)\n\nR-11 - 690 kg (standard warhead)\n\nR-11 - 347 kg (according to other data, 1997)\n\nR-11 - 1000 kg (high-explosive)\n\nR-11M - 600 kg (regular conventional warhead according to some sources)\n\nR-11M - 860-900 kg (in our opinion with a nuclear warhead)\n\nMass of explosives - 535 kg (R-11, warhead weighing 690 or 600 kg)\n\nRange:\n\nR-11 - 250-270 km (during testing)\n\nR-11 - 270 km (with standard warhead weighing 690 kg)\n\nR-11 with warhead 1000 kg - 150 km\n\nR-11M - 170-180 km (according to various sources)\n\nR-11/R-11M - 60 km (minimum)\n\nR-11MU - 150 km (according to TTZ)\n\nMaximum speed on the trajectory - 1430-1500 m / s\n\nFlight altitude along the trajectory - 78 km\n\nFlight time at full range (270 km) - 5.4 min\n\nStart preparation time:\n\n3.5 hours (P-11, regular road train)\n\n30 minutes (R-11M, standard SPU)\n\nQUO:\n\nR-11 tactical and technical requirements of the project (range 270 km) - 1500 m in range and 750 m in the course\n\nR-11 according to test results (90% of launches, range 270 km) - 1190 m in range and 660 m in course\n\nR-11 according to performance characteristics - 3000 m\n\nR-11M according to performance characteristics - 3000 m\n\nR-11M - + -1100 m in range and + -1050 m in heading (65% of launches), 4000 m KVO (15-20% of launches)\n\nWarhead:\n\nR-11 - high-explosive, weighing up to 1000 kg\n\nhigh-explosive\n\n- nuclear warhead 3N10 with an RDS-4 charge with a capacity of about 10 kt.

The warhead for a nuclear charge was designed by KB-25 MSM (now - the All-Russian Research Institute of Automation named after N.L. Dukhov).\n\nDiameter - no more than 880 mm\n\nHe transferred the final fine-tuning of the R-11FM rocket to Zlatoust, to SKB-385, seconding the young talented lead designer V.P. Makeev from his OKB-1 together with qualified designers and designers, thereby laying the foundation for creating a unique center for the development of sea-based missiles.\n\nOn the subject of N-3, serious design studies were carried out, during which the fundamental possibility of developing missiles with a long flight range up to intercontinental in the framework of a two-stage scheme was proved. Based on the results of these studies, in accordance with a government decree, NII-88 launched two research projects under the leadership of S.P. Korolev in order to determine the appearance and parameters of intercontinental ballistic and cruise missiles (topics T-1 and T-2) with the necessary experimental confirmation problematic design solutions.\n\nResearch on the topic T-1 developed into development work (chief designer S.P. Korolev), associated with the creation of the first two-stage intercontinental missile R-7 of the batch scheme, which even now surprises with its original design solutions, ease of execution, high reliability and economy. The R-7 rocket made its first successful flight in August 1957.\n\npreparation for the launch of R-7\n\nAs a result of the study on the T-2 topic, the possibility of developing a two-stage intercontinental cruise missile was shown, the first stage of which was purely missile and brought the second stage - a cruise missile - to an altitude of 23-25 ​​km. The winged stage, with the help of a ramjet engine, continued flying at these altitudes and was aimed at the target using the astronavigation control system, which was also operational in the daytime.\n\nConsidering the importance of creating such weapons, the government decided to start development work with the forces of the Ministry of Aviation Industry (MAP) (chief designers S. A. Lavochkin and V. M. Myasishchev). Design materials on the topic T-2 were transferred to the MAP, some specialists and the unit involved in the design of the astronavigation control system were also transferred there.\n\nThe first R-7 intercontinental missile, despite many new design and engineering problems, was created in record time and put into service in 1960.\n\nIn the future, S.P. Korolev develops a more advanced compact two-stage intercontinental rocket R-9 (supercooled liquid oxygen is used as an oxidizer) and puts it (mine version R-9A) into service in 1962. Later, in parallel with work on important space systems Sergei Pavlovich was the first in the country to develop the RT-2 solid-propellant intercontinental missile, which was put into service after his death. At this OKB-1, S.P. Koroleva stopped dealing with combat missile topics and concentrated her efforts on creating priority space systems and unique launch vehicles.\n\nBeing engaged in combat ballistic missiles, S.P. Korolev, as it is now clear, strove for more - for the conquest of outer space and human space flights. To this end, back in 1949, Sergei Pavlovich, together with scientists from the USSR Academy of Sciences, began research using modifications of the R-1A rocket by regularly launching them vertically to altitudes of up to 100 km, and then using more powerful R-2 and R-5 rockets to altitudes of 200 and 500 km, respectively. The purpose of these flights was to study the parameters of near space, solar and galactic radiation, the Earth's magnetic field, the behavior of highly developed animals in space conditions (weightlessness, overloads, large vibrations and acoustic loads), as well as the development of life support means and the return of animals to Earth from space - about seven dozen such launches were made. With this, Sergei Pavlovich laid in advance serious foundations for the assault on space by man.\n\nIn 1955, long before the flight tests of the R-7 rocket, S. P. Korolev, M. V. Keldysh, M. K. Tikhonravov went to the government with a proposal to launch an artificial Earth satellite (AES ).\n\nThe government supports this initiative. In August 1956, OKB-1 left the NII-88 and became an independent organization, the chief designer and director of which was S.P. Korolev. And already on October 4, 1957, S.P. Korolev launches the first satellite in the history of mankind into a near-Earth orbit. His flight is a stunning success and creates a high international prestige for our country.\n\nThe first satellite PS-1\n\nApril 12, 1961 S.P. Korolev again strikes the world community. Having created the first manned spacecraft \"Vostok\", he implements the world's first flight of a man - a citizen of the USSR Yuri Alekseevich Gagarin in near-Earth orbit.\n\nYuri Alekseyevich Gagarin\n\n(read more on the website: For advanced - Commanders - Yu.A. Gagarin)\n\nSergei Pavlovich is in no hurry to solve the problem of human space exploration. The first spacecraft made only one orbit: no one knew how a person would feel during such a long weightlessness, what psychological stresses would act on him during an unusual and unexplored space travel. Following the first flight of Yu. A. Gagarin on August 6, 1961, German Stepanovich Titov made a second space flight on the Vostok-2 spacecraft, which lasted one day. Again - a rigorous analysis of the influence of flight conditions on the functioning of the body. Then the joint flight of the spacecraft \"Vostok-3\" and \"Vostok-4\", piloted by cosmonauts A. N. Nikolaev and P. R. Popovich, from August 11 to 12, 1962; direct radio communication was established between the astronauts. The following year—the joint flight of cosmonauts VF Bykovsky and VV Tereshkova on the Vostok-5 and Vostok-6 spacecraft from June 14 to 16, 1963—the possibility of a woman's flight in space is being studied. Behind them, from October 12 to 13, 1964, in space was a crew of three people of various specialties: a ship commander, a flight engineer, and a doctor on the more complex Voskhod spacecraft. On March 18, 1965, during a flight on the Voskhod-2 spacecraft with a crew of two, cosmonaut A. A. Leonov makes the world's first spacewalk in a spacesuit through an airlock.\n\nAlexei Arkhipovich Leonov in outer space\n\nTracking the series of accomplished space flights, one cannot fail to notice a clear methodological sequence of human space exploration and preparation for the creation of a scientific manned long-term orbital station (DOS), the need for which S.P. Korolev spoke at the beginning of the space assault.\n\nContinuing to develop the program of manned near-Earth flights, Sergei Pavlovich begins to implement his ideas on the development of a manned DOS. Its prototype was a fundamentally new, more advanced than the previous ones, Soyuz spacecraft. This spacecraft included a utility compartment, where the astronauts could spend a long time without space suits and conduct scientific research. During the flight, the automatic docking of two Soyuz spacecraft in orbit and the transfer of cosmonauts from one ship to another through outer space in spacesuits were also envisaged. Unfortunately, Sergei Pavlovich did not live to see the implementation of his ideas in the Soyuz spacecraft.\n\nSoyuz rocket launcher\n\nFor the implementation of manned flights and launches of automatic space stations, S.P. Korolev develops a family of perfect three-stage and four-stage carriers on the basis of a combat rocket. Thus, the contribution of S.P. Korolev to the development of domestic and world manned cosmonautics is decisive.\n\nResponding to space success of the Soviet Union in the field of manned flights and wanting to restore its technical authority, the United States is adopting the Apollo program, fantastic in terms of goals and scope of work, which consists in creating a lunar space complex that will ensure the landing of two cosmonauts on the moon. In response to this challenge, wishing to maintain priority in the main space achievements, S.P. Korolev, by decision of the government, begins to develop a project for the domestic expeditionary lunar complex N1-LZ.\n\nlunar launch vehicle \"H-1\"\n\nHowever, this decision is made much later than in the United States, against the backdrop of an extensive program of near-Earth manned flights and exploration of the planets of the solar system. Extremely tight deadlines, a large load of work on other priority space programs, as well as the lack of financial and production support for the \"lunar\" program did not allow Sergei Pavlovich's successor, chief designer V.P. Mishin, to create a lunar space complex within the specified time frame, the project of which was developed during his lifetime S.P. Korolev, and the said program was closed by the government.\n\nIn parallel with the rapid development of manned cosmonautics, work is underway on satellites for scientific, national economic and defense purposes. In 1958, a geophysical satellite was developed and put into space, and then the Elektron paired satellites to study the Earth's radiation belts. In 1959, three automatic spacecraft were created and launched to the Moon. The first and second were for the delivery of the pennant of the Soviet Union to the Moon, the third for the purpose of photographing the far (invisible) side of the Moon. Subsequently, S.P. Korolev began to develop a more advanced lunar apparatus for its soft landing on the surface of the Moon, photographing and transmitting a lunar panorama to Earth (object E-6).\n\nLunokhod-2 on the Moon\n\nSergei Pavlovich, true to his principle of involving other organizations in the implementation of his ideas, entrusts the completion of this apparatus to his colleague, a native of NII-88, who headed the OKB im. S. A. Lavochkin, chief designer G. N. Babakin. In 1966, the Luna-9 station transmitted for the first time in the world a panorama of the lunar surface. Korolev did not witness this triumph. But his case fell into reliable hands: OKB im. S. A. Lavochkina has become the largest center for the development of automatic spacecraft for the study of the Moon, Venus, Mars, Halley's comet, Mars' satellite Phobos and for astrophysical research.\n\nEven in the process of creating the Vostok spacecraft, S.P. Korolev began the development of the first domestic photographic reconnaissance satellite Zenit for the Ministry of Defense on its constructive basis. Sergey Pavlovich created two types of similar satellites for detailed and survey reconnaissance, which began to be used in 1962 - 1963, and transferred this important direction space activities one of his students, chief designer D. I. Kozlov, to the Samara branch of OKB-1 (now the Central Specialized Design Bureau - TsSKB), where it found a worthy continuation. At present, TsSKB is a large space center for the development of satellites for sounding the earth's surface in the interests of defense, National economy and science, as well as on the improvement of carriers based on the R-7 rocket.\n\nS. P. Korolev gave rise to the development of another important direction the use of satellites. He developed the first domestic communications and television broadcasting satellite Molniya-1, which operates in a highly elliptical orbit. S.P. Korolev transferred this direction to the Krasnoyarsk branch of OKB-1 to his student, chief designer M.F. Reshetnev, thereby laying the foundation for the birth largest center countries to develop various space communication systems, television broadcasting, navigation and geodesy.\n\nM.F. Reshetnev and S.P. Korolev\n\nConclusion\n\nLooking back at the whole life path of S.P. Queen, starting with a youthful passion for gliding and ending with his last days, one can emphasize the most main feature his character - the desire to do the unusual. The gliders created according to his drawings were always original. And rocket technology, especially in the distant pre-war years, captivated him with its unusualness, boldly romantic future, \"space prospects.\" Sergey Pavlovich foresaw and, like few, deeply understood what a significant contribution to scientific and technological progress it could become, how it would contribute to strengthening the defense capability of our country in those difficult years. And he gave all his strength, knowledge and talent to its creation and improvement.\n\nIf Korolyov had lived several centuries ago, he might have sailed to discover new lands. In our century, he helped to make mankind more serious - the first step towards the unknown worlds of the Universe.\n\nIn 1933, the first liquid-propellant rocket was launched in our country. And 65 years later, today an international space station is being built, designed to work in space for decades, it creates conditions for astronauts that are close to the life of earthlings. The end of the 20th century made sensational discoveries about the presence of water on the Moon and signs of life on Mars, and the boundaries of the study of the Universe with radio telescopes pushed our capabilities to a fantastic limit.\n\nIn 1903, a teacher from Kaluga K.E. Tsiolkovsky in his works for the first time substantiated the possibility of interplanetary flights with the help of a rocket. And this daring and bold idea became the launching pad from which the spaceships rose. The modern path of an astronaut from the launch pad to the board space station in orbit takes a little more than three hours, exactly as long as the electric train from Moscow to Kaluga, Tsiolkovsky's homeland, takes today. It took mankind a hundred years to from the moment of birth (1857) K.E. Tsiolkovsky to launch the first artificial Earth satellite (1957). And now only 180 minutes are needed to deliver a person aboard the space station. And in all these practical achievements - the foundations laid by the Chief Designer Academician S.P. Korolev.\n\nUntil quite recently, the people of the Earth with bated breath followed every message about achievements in the field of space flights, and today in space there are ordinary working days and only significant dates they remember those whose name is associated with the very first and therefore the most difficult steps into space. Among them - S.P. Korolev, Chief Designer of the first rocket and space systems.\n\nmonument to S.P. Korolev in Moscow"
