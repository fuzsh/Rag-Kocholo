        "text": "the ghost\n\nrockets of 1946\n\nU.S. and Soviet troops meet at the Elbe River in April 25, 1945. Less than two weeks later Germany would unconditionally surrender.\n\nA FULL SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE FALL of Nazi Germany, the first battle of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Russia was already well underway.\n\nFour years earlier, despite a mutual non-aggression pact, Hitler had invaded Russia -- which soon became first Britain's then America's ally in the war. But the US-USSR alliance had always been an uneasy one, rife with intrigue and suspicion. Soviet arch-dictator Josef Stalin was anything but a friend to democracy, and his 'non-aggression' pact with Hitler had included plenty of aggression against neighboring countries -- allowing Stalin to brutally annex the Baltic states while Hitler savaged Poland.\n\nAnd though throughout the next three years of the U.S.-Soviet alliance both countries followed the dictum that 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend', both also knew it was a friendship not meant to last.\n\nNow, with the defeat of Germany just weeks away, the battle for future dominance -- planned in the months before at desks and chalkboards in Washington and Moscow -- was reaching fruition on the front lines.\n\nThe grand prize being the capture of the German scientists... and their cutting edge technological secrets.\n\nCover and interior page of a field report of an Allied intelligence investigative team in Germany.\n\nAMERICAN PLANNING FOR THIS had occurred months before the war's end. In November 1944 the U.S. had set up the 'Technical Industrial Intelligence Committee' to identify anything of economic, industrial or technological value to be acquired as Germany fell -- including patent registrations and accompanying documentation. Thousands of personnel were involved in the massive effort. For instance, just a single sub-group within the organization employed nearly 400 people solely to represent the potential interests of over a dozen strategic U.S. manufacturers in acquiring German advances in design and manufacturing.\n\nSimilarly, the Soviets --on the personal orders Josef Stalin -- carried out the eastern offensive across a broad front with the same goal in mind. Stalin's first priority was to capture as much of Germany's research, equipment and experts on its nuclear program as possible.\n\nBut equally important -- and to the U.S. as well -- was to capture the German rocket secrets.\n\nLeft: Preparing the launch of a German V-1. Above: A V-1 dives into London.\n\nNAZI ADVANCES in missile technology were the envy -- and the terror -- of the world.\n\nThe V-1 (\"V\" was short for Vergeltungswaffen, aka 'Vengeance Weapon') was the forerunner of the modern cruise missile. Known as the 'flying bomb' or 'buzz bomb', it could be launched from ramps or planes. Powered by a ramjet engine, it carried its warhead of one ton of high explosives at a speed of nearly 400 mph, and at impact caused massive destruction.\n\nFortunately for the Allies, the V-1 had no precise targeting control and so could only be generally aimed towards its destination. But what it lacked in accuracy it partially made up in volume -- over 12,000 V-1s were launched, first against England and later against Allied positions in Antwerp.\n\nGerman science had also led the way in other weaponry across the missile and rocket spectrum. Its Rheintochter ground-to-air missile was developed to intercept bomber formations at high altitudes. Its X4 air-to-air missile was the predecessor to wire-guided missiles. Its HS 293 air-to-ground missile was the forerunner of the 'smart bomb'. And Germany had mass-produced the first rocket-powered fighter plane, the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet.\n\nBut it was the V-2 ground-to-ground missile which was the most coveted of all aerial weapons.\n\nIT WAS THE FIRST BALLISTIC missile, and the first to obtain sub-orbital space flight. It's design would be the basis for ICBMs and moon rockets. Standing nearly 5 stories high, it launched at a weight of 27,000 pounds.\n\nLifting off with a thrust of 69,000 pounds, the V-2 would began to rise slowly. Four seconds later, the gyroscopic guidance system would pitch the behemoth to its pre-programmed flight angle. A minute or so later the engine would shut down, the missile having already achieved a speed of more than one mile per second as it climbed to an altitude of 50 miles. Within 5 minutes, it's trajectory would arc down to deliver it's 2000-pound high-explosive payload.\n\nMoving at such speed, and falling from such height, there was no defense. More than 4,000 would be launched with devastating effect.\n\nAnd next up on the drawing boards was a ballistic missile that would eclipse even the V-2: a multi-stage rocket nearly 7 stories high with an initial thrust of over 400,000 pounds, known as the 'A10'. And though it was still on the drawing boards, the German's vision included later using the A10 as the second stage of a rocket with over 2 million pounds thrust that could carry a 60,000 pound payload into space.\n\nAlso on the drawing boards: a vehicle known as the 'Antipodal Bomber' -- 92 feet long and 220,000 pounds in weight -- which would fly into space to a height of 160 miles, capable of dropping a 12,000 pound payload over New York or Washington just 80 minutes after launch from Germany.\n\nTHE DEVELOPMENT AND manufacture of these 'Wunderwaffen' (aka 'Wonder Weapons') had mostly taken place at a site on the German island of Usedom, near the village of Peenemunde (pronounced 'pee-en-eh-moon-day'). Peenemunde was located in the far northeast of Germany, near the Polish border. It was a once and future resort, verdant and lush, its pine forests dotted with lakes, and at its feet platinum beaches and the white-capped sea stretching out to meet the sky.\n\nBut since 1936 it had undergone radical changes. The year before, 22-year old rocket genius Werner von Braun and 39-year old artillery captain Walter Dornberger had teamed to design and manufacture -- and in fact, invent -- the world's first long-range ballistic missiles at an artillery range outside of Berlin, with the first two prototypes designated as the A-1 and the A-2. These prototypes involved experiments with engine thrust and propellant types and were followed by the A-3 prototype which focused on missile guidance systems. Moving out of Berlin, the A-3 was tested at Greifswalder Oie, a small island in the Baltic sea. Unsuccessful in its guidance tests, it nevertheless represented the first successful launch of a ballistic missile from a vertical platform.\n\nBuoyed by their successes -- and the military possibilities of a staggering advantage in war -- priority work began in 1936 on a vast testing complex on Usedom Island, near Peenemunde. Dornberger was named head of the entire test range, which was figuratively and geographically split into two competing factions, the Wehrmacht (army) and the Luftwaffe (air force). At Peenemunde Westen (Peenemunde West) was the work contracted by the Luftwaffe, including the V-1 flying bomb. At Peenemunde Ost (Peenemunde East) was the work of the Wehrmacht, focusing on the ballistic missile, with Werner von Braun as its technical director.\n\nBy the formal beginning of World War II in September, 1939, Peenemunde had become a vast complex of laboratories and manufacturing facilities with more than 3,000 personnel directly involved in its work, operating on a scale in its missile and rocketry research and development that would only be matched much later at White Sands, Cape Canaveral and Star City. The cream of scientists had been commandeered from Germany's tech industries and universities, laboring day and night at both Peenemunde Westen and Peenemunde Ost to solve all the technical complexities of building the world's first flying rocket bomb as well as the world's first true ballistic missile. Both would come into reality in 1944, with the V-1 and the especially the V-2 -- technically called the A-4 -- placing Germany a decade or more ahead in missile development and research.\n\nAnd it would all be in Soviet hands by the end of the war.\n\nAbove: August 12, 1946 news report in the U.S. Left: May 25, 1946 Swedish news report.\n\nALMOST A YEAR TO THE DAY after Germany's formal surrender an unwelcome intruder was reported to have appeared in the skies over Sweden. The newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported that two night watchmen had spotted a \"wingless, cigar-shaped body of dimensions of a small airplane, which at regular intervals spurted bunches of sparks from its tail.\"\n\nIn the following days more reports would flow in. From the May 26, 1946 edition of the Dagens Nyheter:\n\nEven if reports of a wingless aircraft spurting fire over Landscrona are to be treated with a certain reserve, it is very possible that what people saw were V-1 bombs fired by the Russians from some experimental station on the Baltic Coast. This statement was made by an air expert, to whom Dagens Nyheter submitted the reports in yesterday's telegrams.\n\nThe experts state that the whole of Germany has been fine-combed by the occupying powers for robot bomb material and experiments are being carried out zealously. Just as with the Germans, a number of projectiles went on courses not intended. Bombs from the Continent can naturally now land in or make short-cuts over Sweden. The observations made by the inhabitants of Landscrona, namely that the sparks from the tail come at intervals, agrees with the V-1 bomb's manner of operation.\n\nIt is true that the witnesses have given the length of the projectiles now seen as considerably less than the V-1 bomb's 6-7 metres but it is easy to err on such points.\n\nOf all parties interested in robot bombs, the Americans appear to have come farthest. While the war was still on, they began examining an example of the V-1 which fell in London without exploding. Whilst the German V-1s had a radius of about 240km. and a speed of 550 km. per hour, the Americans have attained a speed of more than 700 km. for the projectile and a considerably longer range than the Germans.\n\nFinally, it remains to report that a chauffeur in Huddinge saw a shining projectile at 12 o'clock at night on Friday/Saturday and he considered that it could not have been either an aircraft or a meteor. When he spoke of the matter, he had not heard of what happened in Landscrona so he could not have been influenced by it\n\nAnd two days later, from the May 28, 1946 edition of the Morgon-Tidningen:\n\nIt is not only in Landskrona and Gavle that fireballs and lighted [word missing] without wings are seen. Also from Karlskrona and Halsingborg are similar observations reported, and many persons in the Stockholm area stated to the MT that they saw the same phenomenon in Huddings and Hagalund. No one really knows what is going on. One guess is of experiments with secret weapons, but aviation experts think that in such a case it is curious that no sound is reported in connection with the observations - long range bombing practice gives off noise.\n\nAnd four days after that, from the June 1, 1946 edition of the Morgon-Tidningen:\n\nIt seems as if the mysterious flier, which was observed in Osternarks at the beginning of the week, was not altogether an illusion. Yesterday the same thing was reported in fact in Katrineholm. An object which can be compared to a silver-glistening rocket, in the shape of a giant cigar, was noticed in the east on the horizon. The time was 11:43 a.m. in the morning. The 'ghost airplane' had no hint of wings, but on the other hand some thought it that had the semblance of a stabilizer or the like. It traveled very rapidly through the air and many observers pointed out that not even the fastest fighter plane would be able to keep pace. A light rumble was heard, near the object after it had made a turn toward the west, in a diving continued trip toward the south... The projectile, or whatever it might be, was as long as an ordinary training plane and went at 300 meters altitude.\n\nAnd on the same day, from the June 1, 1946 edition of Aftonbladet:\n\nHelsingfors, Saturday. -- Mysterious objects, considered to be some kind of peculiar 'meteors' or some new V-bomb being tested, have flown over Helsingfors. The mysterious wingless projectiles, which fly on a north-east--south-west course, appear to have their 'bases' somewhere north of Lake Ladoga. The objects flew over Helsingfors last week, on Friday night.\n\nTaking note, and on that same day, the British Air Attache in Sweden on June 1, 1946 notified the Air Ministry in London of the new situation. Under the subject Flying missiles observed over Sweden the memo referenced the recent news articles and stated...\n\nBoth myself and members of my staff have discussed the above reports with representatives of the Swedish Air Force, who, although interested, are as yet unable to confirm the observations officially, but they have agreed to pass on to us any information that may be of interest.\n\nAnd thus began the phenomenon which came to be known as the 'Ghost Rockets' of 1946.\n\nAbove: A Svenska Aero Jaktfalken, which entered use in the Swedish air force as a fighter plane in the early 1930s. Source: Karl Kossler.\n\nTHE STRANGE NAME given the reported rockets harkened back to the 1930s, when sightings of seemingly mysterious airplanes over Scandinavia -- called 'ghost fliers' in the Swedish press -- gripped public attention between 1933 and 1934. The 'ghost fliers' caused considerable consternation because they were unmarked, flew at night -- at that time a very rare occurrence in aviation -- and often were said to project beams of light.\n\nOne such report, from the January 28, 1934 edition of Haparanda....\n\nThe personnel of the Haparanda newspaper watched for several minutes, around midnight Saturday, as an aeroplane flew back and forth several times over the city. Because of the foggy weather no light could be seen, but the sound of a very powerful engine was heard by everyone on the editorial staff. The aeroplane looked like a giant shadow in the air. One hour earlier, ten persons observed a plane over Haparanda, flying back and forth.\n\nAnd another, from the February 8, 1934 edition of Norlands-Nytt....\n\nIt was approximately 500 metres high and projected a very powerful searchlight on both sides of the nearby hilltops. Observers noted a red lantern on the machine before it vanished in a south-westerly direction.\n\nThe ghost fliers soon became international news. From the February 16, 1934 edition of the Lubbock, Texas Morning Avalanche...\n\nEurope's 'Ghost' Planes\n\nIt is easy for the imagination to give reality to excessive fears.\n\nIn this fact may lie explanation of the mysterious \"ghost\" planes reported to be making flights over parts of northern Europe.\n\nFrom Northern Finland, Sweden and Norway come reports of airplanes cutting across the star-lit sky apparently on reconnoitering trips. One of these mysterious planes is said to have made its appearance over London.\n\nThe accepted explanation by the population of the countries visited, of course, is that the flyers represent foreign nations preparing for war and that they are sent out to further such preparations. One Swedish aviation expert expressed the view that those sighted over Swedish territory were Japanese flyers scouting the Arctic regions in connection with a possible conflict between Japan and Russia. Others of the \"ghost\" planes are believed to have been Russian.\n\nSpy scares in Europe are of such routine occurrence that they have come to hold little popular interest. Heretofore, though, they have involved chiefly spies who moved about on land. Now that these secret agents have taken to the air stories dealing with their activities should prove a little more thrilling to the readers.\n\nReports would continue to pour in, sometimes of seemingly ordinary aircraft making ordinary noise and sometimes of weird aircraft -- such as one with eight propellers reported seen circling over water in the dead of night -- for the remainder of 1934 and even occasionally into the next few years.\n\nWhat cause lay behind the reports was never definitively answered. But with the ascendancy of Nazi Germany and Hitler's drumbeat of racial war echoing ever louder in the late 1930s, the eyes of the world turned elsewhere... leaving all tales of 'ghost fliers' receding into memory.\n\nAt least until the time came when Europe's cataclysmic and genocidal upheaval of nations had seemingly ended, that is.\n\nAbove: British prime minister Winston Churchill, American president Harry Truman, and Soviet premier Josef Stalin at the Potsdam Conference in July, 1945.\n\nWHAT RESPITE THERE WAS from the worries of war following the Allied victory in 1945 was brief, if not totally illusory. Conferences between the leaders of Britain, the U.S., and the U.S.S.R. had reached seeming agreement on the nature of the post-war world. The countries of war-ravaged Europe were to create \"democratic institutions of their own choice\" through \"the earliest possible establishment\" of \"free elections\". Further, the three had pledged to dismantle Germany's armaments and munitions factories within their zone of control.\n\nBut the promised free elections in Soviet-held territories were not to be forthcoming. And so in March, 1946, British prime minister Winston Churchill made his historic proclamation...\n\nThe United States stands at this time at the pinnacle of world power. It is a solemn moment for the American democracy. For with this primacy in power is also joined an awe-inspiring accountability to the future...\n\nIt is my duty, however, to place before you certain facts about the present position in Europe.\n\nFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia; all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow...\n\nI do not believe that Soviet Russia desires war. What they desire is the fruits of war and the indefinite expansion of their power and doctrines...\n\nLast time I saw it all coming and I cried aloud to my own fellow countrymen and to the world, but no one paid any attention...\n\nWe must not let it happen again.\n\nChurchill's speech had included pledges of admiration and friendship towards the Soviets, and an appeal for nations to work together. But the implicit warning of the possibility of World War III underlay it all, for both sides to see.\n\nAnd it was during this period of renewed and heightened world tension that the 'ghost rockets' came flying over Scandinavia. And to many they would become not only an aerial phenomena, but just one of many harbingers of far worse things to come.\n\nFrom the August 26, 1946 edition of the San Antonio, Texas Light:\n\nSigns All Point To Threat of War\n\nBy KARL H. VON WIEGAND\n\nDean or American Foreign Correspondents\n\nWritten Expressly for the Hearst Newspaper\n\nPARIS, Aug. 26. -- The danger of war is great.\n\nThe worst war-mongers are those who deliberately seek to keep the truth from the people as was the case at Pearl Harbor, where exploding bombs scattering death and destruction told them war had begun.\n\nBoth sides are saying one word about peace for every four words they say about preparation for defense, for security and for war, as did Stalin in a statement attributed to him last week.\n\nWhat are these signs out of which war may come?\n\n1. A full scale civil war in China. Chinese Communist headquarters at Yenan announced it expected to mobilize 10 million fighting men. That would make it the greatest civil war in history.\n\nTHE STRAITS\n\n2. The Soviet Russian formal demand upon Turkey for joint control and defense of the Bosporus and the Dardanelles.\n\n3. Soviet pressure on the northern frontier of Iran and the concentration, reported from Tehran, of Red troops there, as if in preparation to move southward on British positions on the Persian gulf. The British, it is reported without confirmation, have assembled two or three divisions in that region.\n\n4. Mobilization of large Soviet forces on the northern frontier of Turkey, close by the lower Caspian sea, around the Baku and Kars region. The alleged concentration, according to intelligence reports, of about 17 Red army divisions of parachute and air-borne troops in Odessa, Batum and other Black sea areas, ready for air operations against Turkey.\n\n5. Mobilization of Turkey's army on a war footing.\n\n6. More than two and a half million men in the Red armies in Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria, in addition to more than 300,000 Red Yugoslav troops as allies near the Adriatic.\n\n7. Rapid sovietization of the Russian zone in Germany and the Soviet's employment of German army, navy, air and submarine officers, including specialists in all branches of warfare, engineers and skilled workmen. Experimental V-rockets over Sweden, presumably fired from the Soviet zone in Germany and Poland, are repeatedly reported from Stockholm.\n\n8. Announcement of the seizure of German Ruhr industrial plants by the British to be operated under British control and direction. This is interpreted, especially in Soviet circles, as a precautionary war measure.\n\nMUNITIONS\n\n9. Reported full capacity operation of numerous aircraft works, munition plants, arsenals and other war essential plants in the Soviet zone for the benefit of Soviet Russia, and that the Skoda works in Czechoslovakia, third largest war material plant in Europe, is operating for Russia. The armaments and equipment of the Soviet Red army and the Czech army have been coordinated.\n\n10. The \"war conference\" at Camberly, England, of the British Field Marshal Montgomery and a majority of the leading generals, constituting the brains of the British imperial general staff and army.\n\n11. The announced visit of Montgomery, chief of the British general staff, to Washington as \"private guest\" of Eisenhower It is pointed out \"Monty\" and \"Ike\" are not very warm personal friends.\n\n12. Strengthening of the American air forces in Europe. Enormous military supplies are being maintained in England and France.\n\nPROVOCATION\n\n13. The extraordinary and provocative actions of the Yugoslavs toward America and Britain in the Trieste sector, as if testing out the Americans and British.\n\n14. Concentration of American and British naval forces in the Mediterranean.\n\n15. The Soviet Russian attitude in the Paris conference.\n\nEvery one of these is indicative, no one of them is conclusive of war. All must be taken together to present the underlying picture. Cicero, the Roman, declared 2000 years ago:\n\n\"Sure signs precede sure events.\"\n\nAnd so from it's humble beginnings in May, 1946 stretching on into the intense barrage of reports that would come that summer, the 'ghost rockets' were seen by many as the Soviet's first salvo in a 'cold war' gone hot, a sure sign preceding a sure event.\n\nAbove: July 25, 1946 test at Bikini Atoll, the world's fifth detonation of an atomic bomb by its sole nuclear power. The test occurred four days before the beginning of a \"peace conference\" in Paris by the U.S., Britain, France and the U.S.S.R to determine reparations from and other issues concerning the fate of the Axis nations of Italy, Finland, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. Relations between the western countries and the Soviets became so acrimonious that by the end of August predictions of a coming world war began to appear in the press.\n\nTHE OVER-ARCHING CONUNDRUM of the 'ghost rockets' of 1946 -- both then and now -- is that the puzzle pieces never quite fit into a single coherent picture. The 'ghost rockets' were reported as flying very high or as low as tree-top level. They were sometimes said to explode in mid-air, at other times to crash into lakes, and at still other times to fly out of sight, sometimes changing course as they flew. They were said to be as large as 100 feet long, and as small as a private plane, flying at speeds ranging from very slow to faster than a jet. Some were reported as extremely loud, and others as silent. Some, but not all, trailed smoke or sparks. Some were said to have wings, others to be wingless cigar-shaped projectiles.\n\nCompounding the problem, the overwhelming majority of reports came from untrained observers, undoubtedly including many who had been swept up in the fervor of the moment -- having been told there was something extraordinary to see in the skies, they saw extraordinary things. Exacerbating the difficulties of discerning the situation was the unfortunate fact that witness reports were primarily filtered through the ears of the press -- rarely did a verbatim witness account of what had occurred make it into print.\n\nAll of which can only be illustrated through the following six-dozen news reports -- interspersed with official communiques within or between governments. Indeed, it is the only way to accurately relate the story. That said, the initial few reports have already been given above. What follows is what happened after that...\n\nBy June 4th Stockholm's Aftonbladet newspaper reported sightings over Denmark:\n\nThe mysterious rockets, which during the past few days have been seen over Sweden, have now even appeared over Denmark. The other day, a similar phenomenon was observed at Sonderjylland and a farmer in the Ringsted neighborhood on Sjalland reported that one day at 3:30 a.m. he saw a shining object in the sky. He called his wife and both of them were able to follow it with their eyes for a long time. At first they thought it was a comet but explained that it moved too slowly to be that. On two occasions a tail of sparks was observed behind the object.\n\nAnd a week later, came reports of sightings over Finland as well. From the June 11, 1946 edition of the Winnipeg, Canada Free Press:\n\nFrom Helsinki, witnesses said yesterday they had seen a light-emitting \"ghost rocket\" pass over the Finnish capital in a south-westerly direction Sunday night. The rocket was flying at 900 to 1,200 feet, followed by a smoke trail. Several have been reported lately crossing southern Sweden and Denmark in approximately the same direction.\n\nThe events by this time had captured the attention not only of the British, but of the Americans as well. From a June 26, 1946 Memorandum for Commanding General, Army Air Forces with the subject Reports of Rocket Sightings Over the Scandinavian Countries...\n\nReport from Finland, dated 26 June 1946, bearing an F-3 evaluation, states that a V-bomb was observed recently over Helsinki. The bomb was believed to have been launched from the Porkkala area which is located 20 miles southwest of Helsinki on the Baltic seacoast. Recent maps indicate that this area is territory which belongs to Russia although it is a portion of the Finnish mainland.\n\nBut the majority of reports would continue to come from Sweden. From the June 12, 1946 edition of the Morgon-Tidningen:\n\nA sky phenomenon of the same sort as was observed yesterday has occurred over Eskilstuna. The observation is reported by an engineer who flies daily and must be thought of as a reliable observer. \"I had just put out the light and stood by my window when in the half-darkness I was able to see something come out of a cloud,\" related the engineer. The bomb, if it really was such, passed west of the city in a northward direction. It seemed as if it was on a descending course at close to a 30-degree angle...and in such a case ought to have fallen down somewhere in the area, probably going out north over Hugelata. It could not have been any of our new jet planes, which have a continuous exhaust and thereby look like true rockets. The later V-weapons did the same, but the first had intermittent exhaust.\n\nOn July 10, 1946, the Royal Air Force (RAF) Air Attache in Stockholm forwarded a tip to Britain's air ministry...\n\nSubject: Flying Missiles Observed over Sweden\n\nThis may or may not be more \"chaff for the wheat\" but the following was obtained from a Finnish news correspondent working for Associated Press. This man has been very helpful in the past and spent much of the war in London. For the past few months he has been in Finland where he was following up the \"Flying Missiles\" reports from a news angle. He states that he considers the probable experimental base to be near Riga, in Latvia. He has sources recently arrived from Estonia and they all confirm that the general direction is from this part of the world. For what it is worth, I believe the above to be his genuine opinion after many enquiries. He will let me know if he obtains anything further.\n\nSimpson, Group Captain, Air Attache.\n\nThe next day, Thursday, July 11, 1946, a cable from Stockholm by U.S. Consul General Christian Ravndal was sent to the State Department in Washington:\n\nFor some weeks there have been numerous reports of strange rocket like missiles being seen in Swedish and Finnish skies. During past few days reports of such subjects being seen have greatly increased. Member of Legation saw one Tuesday afternoon. One landed on beach near Stockholm same afternoon without causing any damage and according to press fragments are now being studied by military authorities. Local scientist on first inspection stated it contained organic substance resembling carbide. Defense staff last night issued communique listing various places where missiles had been observed and urging public to report all mysterious sound and light phenomena. Press this afternoon announces one such missile fell in Stockholm suburb 2:30 this afternoon. Missile observed by member Legation made no sound and seemed to be falling rapidly to earth when observed. No sound of explosion followed however. Military Attache is investigating through Swedish channels and has been promised results Swedish observations. Swedes profess ignorance as to origin, character or purpose of missiles but state definitely they are not launched by Swedes. Eyewitness reports state missiles come in from southerly direction proceeding to northwest. Six units Atlantic fleet under Admiral Hewitt arrived Stockholm this morning. If missiles are of Soviet origin as generally believed (some reports say they are launched from Estonia), purpose might be political to intimidate Swedes in connection with Soviet pressure on Sweden being built up in connection with current loan negotiations or to offset supposed increase in our military prestige in Sweden resulting from the naval visit and recent Bikini tests or both. Soviet political pressure on Sweden in connection with Baltic refugees here has, as recently reported to Dept, been considerably stepped up.\n\nRAVNDAL\n\nAround this same time the 'ghost rockets' had become international news. From the July 11, 1946 edition of the Amarillo, Texas Daily News:\n\nSomething In The Air\n\nSTOCKHOLM, July 10 (AP) -- Shining missiles seen in the last 24 hours traveling at great altitude with high speed caused speculation today by the newspaper Aftonbladet that Russians are conducting rocket experiments on Baltic bases.\n\nThe recent missiles were described by witnesses as \"a greenish blue shining ball giving off a tail of light of the same color.\"\n\nSimilar sights two months ago were reported from about 10 places in Sweden and several places in Finland.\n\nThe Aftonbladet quoted a Swedish bomb technical expert as saying the sights occurred too frequently to be celestial phenomena. The paper said the Russians likely are trying out giant rockets directed by remote control, making them return to the starting point. Instead of explosives, the newspaper said they would contain radio transmitters registering altitude, speed, direction and amount of fuel.\n\nFrom the July 12, 1946 edition of the London, England Daily Telegraph:\n\nFor some weeks a fair number of 'ghost rockets' going from south-east to north-west have been reported from various parts of the eastern coast of Sweden. Eye witnesses say that they look like glowing balls and are followed by a tail of smoke more or less visible. So many reports cannot be put down to pure imagination in the matter. As there is no definite evidence that the phenomena are of meteoric origin, there is growing suspicion that they are a new kind of radio-controlled V-weapon on which experiments are carried out.\n\nThree days later, the \"suspicion\" became a certainty in some eyes. From the July 15, 1946 edition of the San Antonio, Texas Light...\n\nReds Test Rocket Bombs\n\nLONDON, July 15. (INS) -- Dispatches from the continent reported today that the Soviets are busily engaged in manufacturing and experimenting with rocket bombs.\n\nGeneva reported strange objects have been seen over the Rhone valley and suggested they may be flying bombs.\n\nThe newspaper Empire News said the Russians have reconstructed former Nazi rocket stations in northern Europe and plan to isolate a large sector of the Baltic for experiments.\n\nThe Empire News said a station at Peenemunde, on the Baltic coast, was employing German technicians under Soviet supervision. They were reported to have built a V-2 rocket capable of longer ranges than the missiles the Nazis exploded on Britain during the war.\n\nSwedish dispatches said fragments of the bombs have recently been found along Sweden's coast.\n\nBecause of the publicity accorded these experiments it was said the Russians may move the stations and scientific staffs to uninhabited areas within the U.S.S.R.\n\nAs to the actual sighting(s), the above was a singular report and impossibly vague. The \"Rhone Valley\" is primarily in the south of France, although the river Rhone originates in Switzerland. But the precise country is not named in the report, and the sourcing is equally vague as well as giving precious little detail.\n\nBut more-detailed reports soon came in that the 'ghost rockets' had now been seen over Sweden's neighbor, Norway. From the July 15, 1946 edition of the Oslo, Norway Aftenposten....\n\n\"Ghost plane\" over Oslo area?\n\nMany people observe a lighted object with high speed northward.\n\nThis morning the Aftenposten has received inquiries from many persons who think they saw a \"ghost plane\" over the Oslo area last night at 23 o'clock. A man who together with three friends were at Bjerkebukta in Jeloy says that at five minutes till 23 a large luminous star was noticed. The \"star\" had a yellow-white dazzling color and became visible on the horizon in a southerly direction. However it was clearly out of the question that any astronomical phenomenon was involved, since the luminous object held a completely straight course at a great height and had such great speed that it did not take much over a minute from its appearance on the horizon in the south till it disappeared in the north-northwest over toward Oslo.\n\nAccording to another communication from a man who observed the luminous phenomenon in Son at ca. 22.50 o'clock, it must be concluded that one and the same thing was involved. The person concerned thought the height was ca. 1,000 meters.\n\nWe have made inquiries to the Meteorological Institute, which does not have any knowledge of the phenomenon. Neither has the Air Defense weather service received reports about the \"ghost plane\" or luminous phenomena. People who noticed such a thing or who found remains of a possible crashed object, should report it without delay to the Air Defense High Command weather station, telephone 34870.\n\nThose reports seemed dashed the next day. From the July 16, 1946 edition of the Oslo, Norway Aftenposten...\n\n\"Ghost flier\" over Oslofjorden was a Norwegian airliner testing its landing lights\n\nThe plane's pilot talks to the Aftenposten.\n\nAs mentioned in the evening number yesterday many persons called up the Aftenposten Friday morning and told that late Sunday evening they had seen a \"ghost flier\" over the Oslofjorden. Both from Son and Jeloya at 23 o'clock was sighted a large bright star which came from the south and disappeared northward, and which changed color to a bluish light before it went away. The speed was very great and the height was about 1000 meters.\n\nThe mystery has now received a natural explanation, however. A flier with one of the airline companies in Oslo called the Aftenposten yesterday and declared that he was the one who piloted the \"ghost flier.\" Sunday evening he was on his way from Copenhagen to Oslo with a Beechcraft plane on a taxi flight. At 23 o'clock he landed at Fornebu, and ca. 22:50 -- the moment when the mysterious plane was observed -- he was over Jeloya.\n\nWhen he was over the fjord at Jeloya, he tested the landing lights -- the mysterious shining light which was observed. At the same time he descended from 3000 to 1000 ft. in order to come to a low height in plenty of time before landing at Fornebu, such that he in the course of a short time came across the spectators' field of vision. This is sufficient explanation for the light disappearing so abruptly and inexplicably.\n\nThe next day, however, the situation again became murky. From the July 17, 1946 edition of the Oslo, Norway Aftenposten...\n\n\"Ghost flier\" over Norwegian territory still?\n\nSTAVANGER, 16 July (NTB). From information Stavanger people have given, it seems as if \"ghost rockets\" have now reached Rogaland, too. Last Saturday evening around 23 o'clock some Stavanger folk who holidaying at Usken, suddenly noticed a luminous object which came in over the Usken River from a southeasterly direction. It looked like a projectile, had a great speed and went at a fairly great height. The projectile sent out a very bright, yellow-red light, and its course could be followed till at last it disappeared in a southwesterly direction. It kept the same height all the time, and the witnesses -- there were in all four persons -- say that there is no possibility that it could have been a meteor. The course was horizontal at all times.\n\nIn the coming days, more reports followed, this time definitely describing the rockets as resembling V-1s. From the July 19, 1946 edition of the Oslo, Norway Aftenposten...\n\nDid two rocket bombs go down in Mjosa?\n\nSeen by many people when they passed Feiring at a low height last night.\n\nFrom a man in Feiring we received this morning a sensational report that two rocket bombs crashed into Mjosa last night. They were shaped like ordinary planes, but quite small with only a 2-1/2 meter wing-span and came between 24 and 0:30 this morning from the west at low height over the southerly part of Feiring, where they were observed by many persons, among them (those) at the Hasselbaken Inn and at the Arnes (courtyard). The forward one was not lighted. People noticed them because they heard a loud whistle and directly after (the objects) came flying into sight at terrific speed. They went so low that trees were left swaying after they passed. Nearly midway out in Mjosa, nearer the Feiring side, the water took a big splash and the spray stood many meters high in the air where the objects disappeared.\n\nRight after we received this report we talked with the sheriff in Feiring and Hurdal, who had heard nothing, however. He immediately got into telephone contact with people between Hurdal and Feiring, and was able to report to us some time later that he had gotten confirming reports from many reliable quarters. The place where the planes went down lies ca. 1 mile north from Hinnesund and Mjosa is rather deep here, so it may well be difficult to find them. But the sheriff will notify the Defense High Command immediately so that an investigation can be set in motion.\n\nAnd the next day, from the July 20, 1946 edition of the Oslo, Norway Aftenposten:\n\nAre experiments with Flier X underway over Norway?\n\nCame from the west at a low height over Feiringspogene in the middle of the day.\n\nUp till now it has not been possible to get any certain corroboration for all the reports which have arrived that rocket planes or rocket projectiles have been observed both in this country and in Sweden. Meanwhile reports recently have been so numerous and definite that they can no longer be rejected as products of people's lively imaginations. It is far from impossible that one or more foreign powers is conducting secret experiments with new weapons of the V-like type.\n\nAs reported in one part of our evening number's edition yesterday, there were two such \"Flier X's,\" as we well can call them, seen going down in Mjosa. It happened Thursday midday between 12 and 12:30 o'clock, and they were seen by many persons in Feiring. The acting sheriff of Feiring and Hurdal first got reports yesterday morning and set about at once to collect evidence from eyewitnesses. He received from many quarters confirmation that the two \"Flier X's\" were seen as they came at a low height over the Feiring woods from the west and fell down in Mjosa ca. two kilometers from the western shore and ca. seven kilometers from Minnesund, whereafter he notified the Haerena Overkommando.\n\nYesterday afternoon one of our co-workers was up in Feiring and talked with a couple of those who had the remarkable experience. The \"Flier X\" passed directly over Balsrud farm where they were seen by farmer Sigvart Skaug, his wife and grown son and daughter. Balsrud lies around [ILLEGIBLE] in the south end of Feiring. It was Mrs. Skaug and daughter who saw them first. They were right at the top of the ridge at a place which is called Badstuakeren, and high. They (the people) suddenly heard a loud noise in the air and believed at first there was a plane coming. But the sound did not resemble plane noise. It was rather like a powerful whistle. Right afterwards they caught sight of two plane-like objects which came from over the edge of the woods at a tremendous speed and so low that the two women involuntarily threw themselves down on the ground. The air current was so strong that the treetops swayed.\n\nDown at the farm Sigvart Skaug and his son stood and saw the \"Flier X's\" from the side, but at a rather greater height, probably ca. 50 meters. Skaug said that they were like pictures of V-1s he had seen in newspapers. In any case they could not have been ordinary planes. They were cigar-shaped, ca. 2 ½ meters long, with ca. 1 meter long wings. The wings were set ca. 1 meter from the nose, and the fore and after parts had a metallic gleam, but the midsection with the wings was black. It looked as if there was attached an apparatus, perhaps a steering device, in the rear. The wings flapped a little as if they were of cloth. No fire or light was seen. The projectiles went a short distance from each other, the one a little ahead of the other. They described a slight arc, about the way a stone is cast, and fell together into Mjosa, so the water plumes rose many meters high in the air. No explosion was heard. They sky was completely clear, and Mjosa lay still again in a moment.\n\nI took the bearings of the place where they fell, said Mr. Skaug, and I well believe I can point it out. But the depth here is 3-400 meters, so there is hardly any possibility to bring the two mysterious objects to daylight again.\n\nAt Tosterud farm, which lies nearer Mjosa directly down from Balsrud, \"Flier X's\" were seen by Nils and Gustav Tosterud, who gave the description of them. The daughter of the farm was in her room, but came hurrying out when she heard the noise, and asked: \"But what in the world was it.\" She did not get to see the \"Flier X's,\" which had already disappeared into Mjosa when she came out.\n\nYesterday afternoon the sheriff took up the search for others who might have seen the \"Flier X.\" It is a very closely-settled area both south and north of Balsrud, but because of woods (the view) is not very clear, and since the projectiles went so low, it is understandable that no one noticed anything in, for example, the Hasselbakke inn, which lies (scarcely) a kilometer north of Balsrud, and where there were many people out at this time. Unfortunately there was a line break in the telephone above Hamar yesterday, so it was not possible to find out if anyone on the (east side) of Mjosa saw anything.\n\nYesterday evening we submitted this information to Capt. Jorstad of the Air Defense High Command, who was very interested in the matter. The descriptions agree very well with the V-1, he said. If such a projectile is involved and it came from the west, it can well be thought that it was fired from a plane or a ship at sea. Today closer investigations will be made and if there are others who made sightings they ought to be reported straight (away) to the Air Defense High Command, telephone 34870.\n\nFour days earlier, on July 16, 1946, a cable marked \"Urgent\" to the War Department from \"USMA Stockholm\" revealed the extent of 'ghost rocket' sightings...\n\nSwedish Army Staff studying 300 to 400 rocket incidents Ref your WAR 94001 of 12 July. They advise: 50 points of impact observed. No evidence of radio control and Army Staff believes phenomena not radio controlled. Defense Research Institute studying fragments but key personnel on leave and report being delayed therefore. No large fragments yet found and small fragments appear to be nonferrous. Afton Bladet states Russians have established base with Staff of German scientists on Dago Island off Estonia. (Staff checking basis of this report) Staff has rather tenuous hypothesis to support this as follows: Two circular rocket courses both with radius of approximately 300 kilometers and centres respectively in the 56-57 N latitude, and 19-20 E longitude quadrangle and the 61-62 N latitude, 21-22 E longitude quadrangle with rockets launched from Dago clockwise on both courses. This theory accounts for only portion of the incidents. Staff has not yet processed all reports. Some highly placed officials believe the phenomena are Russian rocket experiments either purely for research or for War of Nerves. Staff very nervous about release of info to United States and United Kingdom for fear Russians will cry 'West Bloc'. This office urges greatest protection this information. Detailed report by next pouch also later followup on ultimate findings. End.\n\nACTION: Gen Chamberlin\n\nINFO: Gen Spaatz, Gen Norstad, Gen Aurand\n\nThe cable leaves no doubt about the level of concern in the United States -- General Stephen J. Chamberlin was head of G-2, the Army's intelligence branch. General Carl Spaatz was Commanding General of the Army Air Forces. General Lauris Norstad was director of the Plans and Operations Division of the War Department. And General Henry Aurand was the War Department's Director of Research and Development.\n\nThe information in the cable itself about Swedish skittishness -- i.e., \"staff very nervous about release of info to United States and United Kingdom for fear Russians will cry 'West Bloc'\" -- reveals a fascinating sidelight to the events. Sweden had been an officially neutral county for almost 150 years, and during the tumult of the late 1930s up until the end of the war had deftly navigated treacherous international relations to avoid being dragged into the war. Now with the possibility of a third world war at hand, it was extremely anxious to avoid being drawn into the fray, and particularly sensitive to the possibility of a Russian invasion -- to the point that they were in the midst of negotiating a 250-million dollar 'credit' to the Russians as part of a 'trade agreement'.\n\nSo though the Swedes had been secretly negotiating with the British to bring over missile and rocketry experts since early July, 1946, they had gone to great lengths to keep it all a closely-held secret -- even from the Americans. From a July 27, 1946 message from the British Air Attache in Stockholm...\n\nI have been asked by the Swedish Air Staff to take all possible measures to prevent the Americans finding out about Swedish full cooperation with us in investigating mysterious missiles... Leakage of information about our co-operation would seriously embarrass Swedish authorities.\n\nThe missile experts from London had arrived on July 18. The first result of meetings was reflected in a message from the British Air Attache to the Air Ministry...\n\nFollowing is position on missiles over Sweden as seen by Heath and Malone after discussion at Swedish Air Ministry to-day.\n\n1. Too many missiles have been observed and described to allow of explanation as meteorites. Full list of observations being sent separately.\n\n2. Sole remains so far recovered in Sweden are pieces no longer than an egg of porous yellow combustible material, porous black carboniferous material, porous grey ash or slag material and black slate like material. Representative samples of each are being sent separately.\n\n3. Meagre remains so far recovered permit no definite conclusions by Swedes or ourselves.\n\n4. All investigations now co-ordinated by Kjellson of Swedish Air Ministry. Both he and we believe that present evidence suggests athodyd propulsion with yellow and black materials being used as main fuel or to maintain combustion. Kjellson does not exclude electronic propulsion as outlined by Austrian deserter Peters during the war or even atomic propulsion. We see no reason for these latter suggestions.\n\n5. Geiger counter was requested to ask the Swedes to test for radioactivity at point of incident. They will have portable Geiger counter weighing 12 kilogrammes so will only require one from us if ours is lighter and more easily handled.\n\nWhat else was going on behind the scenes can only be conjectured. It is known that the Swedish military had by that time set up a 'ghost rocket committee' to investigate the matter. It was later indicated in a memo from the British Air Attache to the Air Ministry that Sweden had reactivated their war-time radar at just this point, and it was said that the radar had almost immediately picked up tracks -- which is probably the source of the American July 16 message noting \"two circular rocket courses both with radius of approximately 300 kilometers\". And perhaps it was as a part of all this frenetic activity that a clamp-down on information was ordered. From the July 25, 1946 edition of the Berkshire Evening Eagle:\n\nSweden Places Censorship on Sky Missiles\n\nRussia or Britain Believed Involved In Tests\n\nSTOCKHOLM (UP) -- The Swedish Army imposed a rigid censorship today on details of strange missiles streaking at fantastic speeds over this country at irregular intervals for several weeks.\n\nThe mounting scale rocket activity over scattered parts of Scandinavia produced a state of jitters and a crop of rumors approaching those of wartime.\n\nMilitary authorities were reported to have received a flood of new reports on the rockets or flying bombs or whatever the darting objects may actually be. The original theory that they were meteorites long since has gone by the board.\n\nBarrage Moves South\n\nMost of the latest accounts of things shuttling comet-like through the skies came from southern Sweden. They indicated that the \"bombardment\" was moving southward after being concentrated over north Sweden for the last two weeks.\n\nThe Army issued instructions not to publish the exact location and time of the appearance of the missiles. While it gave no official explanation, the order was taken to be aimed at avoiding contributing to the information of any \"foreign power\" suspected of carrying out rocket experiments in the Baltic.\n\nThe process of elimination narrows the field of experiments pretty well to the Russians or the British or both. The Baltic was the favorite testing ground of the German V-weapons, and the Anglo-Soviet forces now occupy the same regions.\n\nOne of the latest manifestations was described as a \"fire bullet zooming over soundlessly and terribly fast at an altitude of 6OO feet, and visible for only a few seconds.\"\n\nA skyrocket-like \"giant, flying torpedo\" was seen Tuesday night over Norrland, 500 miles north of Stockholm. Similar objects were seen in the same area on three successive nights last week.\n\nHelsinki dispatches said now rocket bombs were seen in many places over Finland last week. A typical account by a witness said the \"big rockets, emitting a dazzling light and buzzing sound, move fast at high altitude.\"\n\nThat morning, the July 25, 1946 edition of the Morgon-Tidningen published a report which mirrored the talk of 'circular courses'...\n\nIt is possible that the flying bombs which are seen crossing Sweden both with a western direction and in a directly opposite direction, are taking a round trip over the country in order then to return to their place of origin... That they are meteors in every case is a theory which has been rejected without further ado by the defense staff.\n\nAnd though censorship had been ordered by Sweden -- and according to the London, England Daily Telegraph was now also being enforced in Norway -- reports continued to leak out. From the July 26, 1946 edition of the Troy, New York Record:\n\nMore Rockets Reported In Sky Over Sweden\n\nStockholm (AP) -- The Swedish defense staff has received more than 500 reports so far this month from observers who said they saw flying \"fire balls\" skimming through the sky. Swedish newspapers said \"Sweden is a testing range for rocket missiles.\"\n\nSome of the reports said the missiles looked like \"swans without a head,\" \"seagulls\" and \"jet-planes but with a sound weaker than usual.\"\n\nMany Swedes are convinced the launching grounds are somewhere on the southeastern side of the Baltic Sea. Others say they believe the missiles come from the area of Petsamo or Karelia. (All these areas are Russian-controlled.)\n\nMilitary searchers, however, have been unable to recover any of the missiles to determine their origin because they landed in lakes or other inaccessible places.\n\nAll reported missiles and their course are being recorded on a map.\n\nFrom the August 2, 1946 edition of the Indiana, Pennsylvania Gazette:\n\nNew Rockets Over Sweden\n\nSTOCKHOLM, Aug. 2 (AP) Eyewitness descriptions of a soundless rocket projectile of silvery hue, slowly skimming the tree tops over northern Sweden, appeared today in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter. The paper added that seven or eight persons had seen the object, which they said resembled an aircraft. The paper also contained an account of two other missiles seen moving toward the Baltic. One was flying at a higher altitude than the other. It said that when the projectiles got out over the sea first one then the other exploded, creating a glaring yellow-white light.\n\nA number of such projectiles have been seen recently over Sweden and there has been considerable speculation as to whether they may have come from Russia-held areas.\n\nA military censorship has been imposed, forbidding the mention of names of places where the projectiles were reported seen in order to prevent the persons who fired them from drawing conclusions as to velocity and direction.\n\nA singular report also came in from Denmark. From the August 4, 1946 edition of the Lima, Ohio News:\n\nDenmark Reports Mystery Rockets\n\nCOPENHAGEN Aug. 3 (INS) -- The mystery rockets said to have been seen recently over Sweden and Norway were reported today to have put in an appearance over Denmark.\n\nThe newest report of a rocket-propelled projectile was made by a young farmer living near Roskilde, 25 miles west of Copenhagen. He said that during the early morning he had heard and saw a fire-spouting oblong object traversing the sky with great speed and at high altitude.\n\nOn August 8, 1946 national columnist Marquis Childs would sum up events so far, and their implications. From the Madison, Wisconsin State Journal:\n\nSomeone Makes Sweden Laboratory\n\nMysterious Projectiles Fall from Unknown Experiments\n\nby Marquis Childs\n\nWASHINGTON -- TO BE A SMALL nation in this big power world is a precarious business at best. To be a small nation which was neutral during the war and is still intact today is a piece of good fortune that is breath-taking.\n\nFor six long years, the Swedes walked the tight rope of neutrality. They suffered provocation and humiliation again and again. For one thing, German projectiles were fired into Sweden.\n\nAt least two such projectiles fell intact and were flown to England, where analysis of their secrets contributed to the defense of Britain. What the Nazis were doing, of course, was to try out a new secret weapon.\n\nFor the last three weeks, projectiles from an unknown source have again been falling in Sweden. Two or three have fallen across the border in Norway. It makes it seem as though this were indeed no more than a brief pause between wars.\n\nTHE PROJECTILES FALLING IN Sweden have no explosive warhead. Most of them have fallen in the forest areas of the north and, therefore, they have done little damage.\n\nBut here, in miniature, is the pattern of the war of the future. If those same projectiles had a warhead of atomic explosive and if they had been directed, in a war, at the industrial centers instead of the wilderness, Sweden would today be devastated and the war would be over. That is the grim reality while the gentlemen around the conference table in Paris talk of peace.\n\nNo one in Sweden has ventured to speculate officially on where these projectiles come from. The nervous Swedes are saying to one another, \"Don't look now but there's that rocket again.\" The general direction from which they come is the southeast, which indicates an origin either in Russian-occupied Germany or perhaps farther to the east, in Latvia or Lithuania, now incorporated into the Soviet Union.\n\nSOME SPECULATION PUTS THE source on the island Peenemunde off the German coast, in the Baltic. On this island the Nazi concentrated all their experiments on rockets and radio-directed missiles. A dramatic and little-known chapter of the war took place there which may have had far more effect on the outcome than is generally realized.\n\nOn Peenemunde, German scientists perfected a new kind of rocket gun. The scientists, with members of the German High Command, were celebrating the event in a riotous party, when the R.A.F. came over and wiped out almost everything on the Island. Winston Churchill once said that, if the rocket gun had operated from the Calais area in France, all Britain's cities would have been destroyed.\n\nSo far as is known, no one except the Russians have been on Peenemunde since the war ended. It is part of their zone of occupation.\n\nWHEN THE ROCKETS FIRST STARTED dropping in Sweden, the Swedish defense staff asked citizens to report them. There were frequent reports in the press of where they had fallen. One fell in a lake in Lapland, and defense experts are digging it up and will analyze it in an effort to determine the source. Now, however, the Swedish military have requested secrecy on where the rockets land. Obviously, such information would greatly aid whoever is firing the projectiles.\n\nWhat makes this all the more mysterious is that the Swedes are just now about to conclude a long-term trade agreement with the Soviets. This calls for advances up to $250,000,000, over a period of five years, to enable the Russians to buy electrical machinery. While it must be approved by the Parliament, Sweden's Labor Government is in favor of it.\n\nCuriouser and curiouser, said Alice in her own simple little wonderland.\n\nOUR OWN MILITARY ARE experimenting with German V-2 rockets, but the difference is that they are using the desert of New Mexico instead of the backyard of a small neutral.\n\nPerhaps the difference is more important than it seems. if the competition in armaments brings on a new and more terrible war, then Sweden's high civilization will be smashed along with almost everything else that survived World War II. That is the truly sinister thing about this use of Sweden as a convenient military laboratory.\n\nThe sentiment that the rockets were Russian was being widely echoed. From the August 10, 1946 edition of the Oxnard, California Press-Courier:\n\nRussian Experiments Suspected --\n\nSwedes Investigate Mysterious Rockets\n\nSTOCKHOLM (UP) -- The Swedish Army sent investigators today to Central Sweden where rockets were reported to have crashed last night during a veritable shower of the mysterious missiles.\n\nThe first reports seeping through a military blackout indicated the Army investigators found nothing at the scene of the reported explosions. They gave rise to a theory that the rockets are made of material of which little or nothing is left when they explode in the air.\n\nThe strange rockets zoomed through the Swedish skies in greater number than ever before.\n\nMost unconfirmed theories were that the Russians were experimenting with rockets or flying bombs and German scientists were helping them with their work. The baltic was the favorite testing zone for the Nazi V-weapons during the war. Peenemunde village in Pomerania near the Baltic was one of the Nazis' biggest bases for secret weapons.\n\nRockets were reported to have crashed at three points or more in Central Sweden last night. In dispatching investigators, military authorities hinted that they were seeking information upon which to base protests against firing of the missiles over this country which has been going on for weeks.\n\nWitnesses said that one of last night's rockets passed directly over Stockholm and exploded north of the city. An editor of the newspaper Aftontidningon, one of the many persons who reported seeing it, related:\n\n\"A brilliant light suddenly appeared on the southern horizon, on a straight course at an altitude of some 600 feet. Although it could be seen sharply against the dark night sky, a determination of its size and construction was impossible because of its blinding, sparkling tail of blue fire.\"\n\nA Swedish air force lieutenant, after seeing one of the rockets in central Sweden, estimated the length of the body at some 60 feet. He said it was shaped like a cigar, with the forepart green and the sides white. It moved \"terribly fast\" at a low altitude, he said.\n\nMany experts think the things which crashed in Sweden were not bombs, but the accumulation of what is left of propulsion material, with the rockets themselves being radio-directed back to base after a tour of Sweden.\n\nThe resurgence of rocket activity stirred up a new wave of talk which had been going on in varying degrees since the missiles first appeared May 24.\n\nIn most cases the course was from southeast to northwest. But there were stories of missiles coming straight from the north.\n\nThe missiles seemed to be flying soundlessly, giving rise to stories that they were launched or powered by some new means. The speeds were estimated in some cases as high as 600 miles an hour.\n\nAnd from the August 12, 1946 edition of the New York Times:\n\nSweden Believed Target\n\nSTOCKHOLM, Sweden, Aug. 11 (AP) -- \"Ghost rockets\" - mysterious spool-shaped speeding objects with fiery tails - have become a common sight in Sweden, and military officials no longer doubt that the country is in a target area for experimentation with remotely controlled missiles.\n\nSince July 1, newspapers have published reports of the flying fireballs nearly every day. In the beginning many believed excited witnesses had seen nothing more ominous than meteors. However, between July 9 and July 12 military authorities received 300 reports of the missiles and since that time added reports have poured in daily.\n\nFragments examined by scientists gave little in the way of clues, except to indicate the presence of coke and other common materials.\n\nAuthorities, promising a statement on the results of the investigation within a few days, have cautioned Swedish newspapers not to publish the names of places where the rockets appear, so the senders would not obtain important data. Official quarters declined to speculate on the source of the missiles, but it was believed elsewhere that the rockets come from some place along the Baltic coast of Germany.\n\nNobody seems to think these rockets indicate any military preparations against Sweden, but the people here are puzzled at Sweden's being in a target area when an unlimited amount of uninhabited area must be available for experimentation.\n\nThe newspaper Stockholms Tidmingen labeled a recent editorial \"Ghost rockets and future war,\" and said the appearance of the missiles stressed the need for preparedness.\n\nThe rocket is described as a small object with a flaming tail which speeds at great height and vanishes within a few seconds. Witnesses say the rockets make no appreciable sound.\n\nNewspapers recently carried a picture of the rocket, obtained accidentally by a cameraman who was photographing a landscape. It showed a streak of light trailing from a small dark body, looking much like a comet.\n\nOnly in a few cases is it known that the missiles actually landed in Sweden. Military personnel have been busily dredging a small lake in Lapland.\n\nMilitary authorities said the missiles evidently passed over Sweden in a huge curve. Some reports indicated the objects carried a device for self-destruction, and military experts said some apparently had exploded in the air. The longest flight of any of the missiles, so far as military experts could determine, was about 600 miles, compared with the range of thirty-five to forty-five miles for the first German V-2 rocket bombs.\n\nThere is no comparison, however, with the rocket bombs. The mystery missiles are small, and at low altitudes seem almost square. The bottom of the object appeared to have been painted red, witnesses said. Some observed these missiles flying extremely low.\n\nThese reports have been substantiated by a Swedish officer, a flier, who saw one of the rockets during a recent flight.\n\nAlso from the August 12, 1946 edition of the New York Times, breaking news of 'swarms' of rockets being sighted:\n\nSwarm of Mysterious Rockets Is Seen Over Capital of Sweden\n\nBy Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES\n\nSTOCKHOLM, Sweden, Aug. 11 - A swarm of rocket bombs passed over Stockholm at 10 o'clock tonight. The course, as usual, was from the southeast toward the northwest.\n\n(It was reported from Washington that missiles seen over Sweden were thought to have been launched from a former German rocket experiment area at Peenemunde, now in the Soviet zone of Germany.)\n\nReports flowing to the Swedish general staff stress that the bombs are like fireballs, with long luminous tails, but some observers have seen a cigar-shaped bomb, traveling at an altitude of 1,500 feet rather slowly.\n\nSome reported that they had seen bombs crash. The general staff is working at high pressure tonight, investigating all reports, but nothing has been found.\n\nThe strangest report came from central Sweden, where a newly built barn collapsed this afternoon without visible cause. Shortly before the collapse flying bombs had been seen. Then there was a sharp crack and the barn fell. There was no fire.\n\nWitnesses said the barn could not have collapsed because of bad construction. The general staff is sending experts to interview them.\n\nSwedes are seriously worried by the many bomb reports. A few days ago the General Staff received 300 reports in twenty-four hours. The General Staff ordered that the places of crashes be not revealed, as was done during the war with German V-weapons.\n\nIt is rumored here that officers in the Russian Air Force have been dismissed because they were far behind the Western Powers in atomic bomb work. Their successors are believed to be trying new experiments with unloaded shells.\n\nAnd another report of the 'swarm', from the August 12, 1946 edition of the Tipton, Indiana Tribune:\n\nRockets Cross Sweden\n\nStockholm, Aug. 12. (INS) Several hundred projectiles -- similar in many ways to rockets used during the war by Germany -- passed over Sweden during the night but Swedish military authorities declined to comment on their origin or effect. They crossed the southern coast flying toward the northwest.\n\nThat same day, reports came of an intensified investigation and warnings of a diplomatic 'showdown'. From the August 12, 1946 edition of the Twin Falls, Idaho Times News:\n\nSwedish Army Probing Flights Of Mysterious Rocket Missiles\n\nSTOCKHOLM Aug. 12 (UP) -- The Swedish Army sent investigators today to Central Sweden where rockets were reported to have crashed last night during a veritable shower of the mysterious missiles.\n\nThe first reports seeping through a military blackout indicated the Army investigators found nothing at the scene of the reported explosions. They gave rise to a theory that the rockets are made of material of which little or nothing is left when they explode in the air.\n\nThe strange rockets zoomed through the Swedish skies in greater number than ever before. An army source said the visitation was regarded as \"most serious.\" He said the time had come for an all-out effort to establish origin of the rockets.\n\nMost unconfirmed theories were that the Russians were experimenting with rockets or flying bombs and German scientists were helping them with their work. The baltic was the favorite testing zone for the Nazi V-weapons during the war. Peenemunde village in Pomerania near the Baltic was one of the Nazis' biggest bases for secret weapons.\n\nRockets were reported to have crashed at three points or more in Central Sweden last night. In dispatching investigators, military authorities hinted that they were seeking information upon which to base protests against firing of the missiles over this country which has been going on for weeks. They refused to go into detail.\n\nThe rockets streaked in over Sweden beginning about 9 o'clock last night. Newspapers in south and central Sweden were besieged with calls from alarmed and curious citizens. Hundreds of callers reported the passage of the comet-like objects within an hour's time.\n\nThe army was maintaining a blackout over exactly what happened. But spokesmen who declined to be identified made it plain that high authorities were coming around to the view that a showdown might as well be sought in the rocket firing which has been going on for weeks.\n\nA Swedish air force lieutenant, after seeing one of the rockets in central Sweden, estimated the length of the body at some 60 feet. He said it was shaped like a cigar, with the forepart green and the sides white. It moved \"terribly fast\" at a low altitude, he said.\n\nMany experts think the things which crashed in Sweden were not bombs, but the accumulation of what is left of propulsion material, with the rockets themselves being radio-directed back to base after a tour of Sweden.\n\nAnd from the August 12, 1946 edition of the Council Bluffs, Iowa Nonpareil, rumors of a coming public report:\n\nTo Issue Report on Ghost Rockets\n\nSweden to Give Result of Study\n\nSTOCKHOLM, AP -- Swedish military authorities plan to publish within the next few days a communique on an investigation they have been making of the \"ghost rockets\" that have been streaking daily over Sweden since early July, leaving little doubt that the country has become an experimental target range.\n\nOfficial sources have declined to speculate on the source of the mysterious spool shaped missiles, but it is generally believed that the rocket-propelled objects come from some place along the Baltic coast of Germany. Only in a few cases is it known that the missiles actually landed in Sweden.\n\nBetween July 9-12 authorities received 300 reports of the missiles and since then reports have poured in daily. Fragments examined by scientists gave little in the way of clues.\n\nIn general the rocket is described as a small object with a flaming tail, which speeds at great height, making little sound. The longest flight of any of the missiles, so far as military experts could determine, was about 600 miles, as compared with the range of 35 to 45 miles for the first German V-2 bombs.\n\nSwedish newspapers have been cautioned not to publish the names of places where the rockets appear, so that the senders would not be provided with important data.\n\nMeanwhile, in an editorial from the August 12, 1946 edition of the Syracuse, New York Herald Journal, the first of many demands for an answer:\n\nSomething for the Army To Investigate\n\nAmerican Army experts should waste not a single moment in investigating the \"phantom rockets\" that some foreign power, probably Soviet Russia, has been shooting over Sweden almost daily since June.\n\nThe theory in Stockholm is that the rocket missiles are being sent into the air at Peenemuende, Germany, which is held by the Red Army. According to Swedish reports, the missiles travel at the terrific speed of 875 miles per hour. More than 500 reports on the rockets have been made to the Swedish defense staff since May when the first missile was observed. But although Swedish engineers have examined burst fragments, evidently not much has been learned with respect to their construction.\n\nAll that seems to be definitely known is that the rockets travel much faster and farther than the German V-bombs that played havoc in London during the latter days of the last World War.\n\nThe urgent necessity of American experts conducting a prompt investigation will be evident to all those who have studied the recent remarks of Brig. Gen. Richardson of the Army Air Forces guided missiles division. Following the flight of unmanned B-17 drones from Hawaii to California under wireless control, he said that the Air Forces could strike at a target 3,900 miles distant with an unmanned bomber and that some day we should have even larger \"guided missiles\" with atomic warheads.\n\nOn the basis of authenticated stories from Sweden, it now appears that the foreign power experimenting with the \"phantom rockets\" is even now in a position to send missiles with high explosives over very long distances, perhaps with some degree of control. Obviously, we must if possible learn more about this work and the nature of these new weapons.\n\nMeanwhile, it may be pertinent to point out that at a moment when Soviet Russia is urging that our stockpile of atomic bombs be destroyed and that we forego any advantage atomic energy secrets might give us, nothing is said about Soviet Russia destroying its stockpiles of secret weapons, whatever they may be.\n\nIn view of the scale on which the \"phantom rocket\" experiments obviously are being conducted and the fact that the missiles shooting over Sweden evidently have far more dangerous potentialities than the German V-bombs, Russia clearly ought to do some foregoing herself before talking to us about atomic bombs.\n\nBut in all things pertaining to war and national defense, Soviet Russia operates in a hush-hush atmosphere that is more secretive and dark than a midnight session of the Georgia Ku Klux Klan.\n\nMeanwhile, she calls on others to reveal their secrets in behalf of international understanding.\n\nAnd still the 'ghost rockets' were reported flying. From the August 13, 1946 edition of the Traverse City, Michigan Record Eagle:\n\nGhost Rockets Give Sweden The Jitters\n\nSTOCKHOLM, AUG. 13. (UP)-- Another \"mystery rocket\" reportedly zoomed over southern Sweden last night and anxious citizens urged the government to determine immediately what country is responsible for lining Swedish skies with the man-made meteors.\n\nA spokesman for the Swedish defense staff said people throughout the nation apparently had been \"seized by a real ghost-bomb psychosis\" and that preliminary investigations had proved useless.\n\nThe newspaper Dagens-Nyheter said the latest missile was observed moving across southern Sweden from the northwest last night.\n\n\"Shaped like a giant torpedo and emitting a blinding light from its foremost part, it moved soundlessly with great speed and at a high altitude,\" the newspaper said.\n\nSimilar \"cigar-shaped\" missiles were sighted Sunday over central Sweden. Still another rocket was reported at two different points along the east coast of southern Norrland Sunday night.\n\nInformed sources said government officials, were watching all developments closely and were waiting for \"supplementary\" evidence upon which to base possible diplomatic protests. Press comment indicated the government might be forced lo take \"resolute steps\" to clear up the situation.\n\nRumors circulated that the Russians were experimenting with rockets and flying bombs, possibly in Estonia on the Baltic, but there was no confirmation from Swedish army officials who have been conducting secret investigations.\n\nTwo fishermen on the southeastern coast said they saw a large rocket come out of the northern sky Sunday night and disappear southward over the Baltic sea. Other reports said the rocket observed Sunday night moved from south to north.\n\nIn middle Norrland, a farmer reported seeing a rocket explode at a low altitude just over a river. He said the rocket \"disappeared.\" Searchers could find none of the remains.\n\nDefense staff officials said many of the \"reports\" may be \"pure flights of the imagination.\" Some witnesses of rocket crashes have been unable to designate the exact spot. Others, however, have removed all doubt that the missiles were rockets, officials said.\n\nA veritable shower of the \"mystery rockets\" was reported Sunday night. Officials said It was still impossible to determine just how many were sighted. Some observers said the total probably was no greater than on other occasions, but that the display came later in the day and could be seen more clearly against the sunless sky.\n\nAnd from the August 13, 1946 edition of the Manitowoc, Wisconsin Herald-Times:\n\n100 Foot Ghost Rockets Explode Over Sweden\n\nSTOCKHOLM (AP) -- An eyewitness account published in the Stockholm Aftonbladet yesterday told how a 100-foot \"ghost rocket\" exploded in a blinding flash over Sweden lending support to previous reports that the mystery missiles are equipped with destruction devices which make it impossible to find trace of them.\n\nThe rockets have been observed over this country at frequent intervals of late, and military officials believe Sweden is in a target area for experiments with remotely-controled missiles, launched perhaps from the German Baltic coast.\n\nThe public account was given by a trained observer of meteorological and astronomical phenomena who was gazing at clouds through field glasses when a nightmarish torpedo-like object, with a tapered tail that spewed glowing blue and green smoke and a series of fire balls, streaked across his line of vision.\n\n\"I was completely dazzled and had visions of doomsday,\" he said.\n\nAnd as the sightings increased, so did American and British response. From the August 13, 1946 edition of the New York Times:\n\nSwedes Use Radar In Fight On Missiles\n\nDoolittle Believed Called In as Aide - Stockholm Studies Steps to End Violations\n\nSpecial to THE NEW YORK TIMES\n\nSTOCKHOLM, Sweden, Aug. 12 - Sweden now is using radar in the fight against the mysterious missiles that have been flying over the country, it was made known today. The atmosphere here after last night's swarm of projectiles over Central Sweden was almost at the boiling point and there were persistent rumors that Sweden was going to, or already had, borrowed several complete radar outfits from Great Britain to obtain the quickest results.\n\nIt also is believed that the United States' foremost long-distance bombing expert, Lieut. Gen. James H. Doolittle, who now is retired, is coming to Sweden to inspect the radar equipment, although the official explanation is that he is coming as a business man for the Shell Company.\n\nThe Swedish General Staff today described the situation as \"extremely serious,\" and it is obvious Sweden no longer is going to tolerate such violation of her integrity. Everything possible is being done to put an end to it.\n\nThe General Staff received more than 1,000 reports on the rocket bombs last night and this morning. It is a tremendous task to check on all the reports, but it will be done and experts already are scattered all over the country to investigate each little bit found.\n\nSighted by Astronomer\n\nThe reports give detailed and interesting descriptions of the bombs. A Swedish astronomer and meteorologist said, \"I was studying some clouds through a telescope when suddenly I observed a luminous point on the horizon.\n\n\"I first believed it to be an airplane,\" he said, \"but soon I noticed it was traveling much too fast for that, and within ten seconds I got a full view of the projectile. I managed to get a clear view of the bomb's body and estimate that it was at least 90 feet long. The body was torpedo-shaped and shining like metal. No sound could be heard, although the bomb was only two kilometers away. At the explosion, a terrific light flashed up that for a moment completely blinded me. No fire, smoke or sparks were noticeable.\"\n\nThe description of the shape varies, for some observers say they have seen a big fire ball instead of a torpedo-shaped projectile, but all agree on the small fire balls shot out from the afterpart.\n\nThe Swedish public named the missile the \"phantom bomb,\" but now frequently is using the term \"Russian V-4.\"\n\nThe Swedes notified their legation at Helsinki to be on the sharpest lookout and to notify Finnish authorities immediately if the bombs appeared again.\n\n----------\n\nOne Falls Near Stockholm\n\nSTOCKHOLM, Sweden, Aug. 12 (U.P.) - The Swedish Army today rushed experts to three points in Central Sweden where unidentified rockets, rumored to be the results of Russian experiments, crashed last night.\n\nThe barrage was the heaviest since the mysterious aerial missiles first were seen flashing through Swedish skies on May 24.\n\nThe Swedish Army clamped a tight censorship on the results of its investigation. But reports from hundreds of Swedes who sighted the fiery missiles indicated a whole barrage might have been fired. One rocket passed directly over Stockholm at 8:45 P.M. and crashed north of the city.\n\nOne eyewitness to an explosion in Central Sweden said fragments rained down after a great blast in the air above him. Previous explosions have left hard, black metal objects similar to coal clinkers.\n\nThe movement of the missiles varied. Some flew a straight course and others veered. In most cases the course was reported from southeast to northwest. Other reports said some missiles came straight from the north.\n\nThen -- as if the tension weren't already near the breaking point -- came reports of fatalities. From the August 14, 1946 edition of the Pittsfield, Massachusetts Berkshire County Eagle:\n\nSweden Alerts Forces As Rocket Kills Trio\n\nSTOCKHOLM (UP)Sweden declared an open season on unidentified rockets today as three airmen were reported killed in a head-on crash with one of the missiles.\n\nCrashed Plane\n\nGovernment authorities prepared a nationwide \"rocket-hunting\" program and alerted all military units, air bases and radar stations to be on the lookout for the cigar-shaped \"ghost bombs.\"\n\nThe newspaper Aftonbladet quoted \"investigators\" as reporting that three fliers were killed yesterday when their military reconnaissance plane crashed into a rocket near Vaggeryd, in southern Sweden. The dispatch said radio contact with the plane was broken just before the crash and that the front of the ship was \"completely crushed\" by the impact.\n\nMissiles Turn Corners\n\nWitnesses have reported seeing the rockets change their course in mid-air and one informed source said it was known that they were radio-controlled.\n\nOne reliable source said the Swedish Defense Staff had learned that some of the rockets cruised in a wide semi-circle over southern Sweden. He said it was believed the missiles probably proceeded over northern Finland, towards the Russian Kola Peninsula.\n\nEarlier reports said most of the bombs went from south to north, but one \"witness\" reported sighting an opposite flight.\n\nInvestigators have indicated that the rockets destroy themselves after falling. No fragments have been found, despite the large number of missiles reported seen in flight.\n\nBut whatever was happening behind the scenes, publicly the Americans claimed they were not involved in the investigation. From the August 14, 1946 edition of the Amarillo, Texas Daily News:\n\nSweden Snubs American Help In Solving Big Rocket Riddle\n\nWASHINGTON, Aug. 13 (AP) -- Under-Secretary of State Acheson said today he personally is very much interested in reports of rockets flying over Sweden but that the Swedes had not sought any American advice on the subject. Unofficial but widely published speculation has been that the rockets were experimental missiles fired from Russian-controlled territory.\n\nMeanwhile, the situation only became more tense. From the August 14, 1946 edition of the Carroll, Iowa Daily Times:\n\n'Ghost Rocket' Blast Reported Over Denmark\n\nSwedish Paper Criticizes Military Heads For Lack of Action\n\nSTOCKHOLM, SWEDEN (AP) -- The newspaper, Aftonbladet, said yesterday that a \"ghost bomb\", bursting over a Swedish lake, had nearly caused casualties and criticized military authorities for their failure to explain the nature of the missiles, which have been reported almost daily by observers for the past two months.\n\nThe paper said that two persons boating on the lake, located in central Sweden, were nearly hit by the bomb, which burst into many parts.\n\nThe paper also reported that a rocket had been observed near Goeteberg by a group of Boy Scouts, who saw the flying missile turn and then return to its original course.\n\n(From Copenhagen came the first report of a \"ghost rocket\" explosion over Denmark. A night watchman in Struer, West Jutland, said he saw a speeding missile, approaching from the northeast explode with a blinding flash.)\n\nSwedish military authorities said yesterday that they had received no tangible proof that the frequent celestial phenomena observed over the country resulted from foreign experiments with aerial missiles.\n\nIn retort, Aftonbladet said \"it ought to be possible to state whether they are meteors or not, and if they are rockets, one should be caught.\"\n\nThe paper added that if they were rockets and of Russian origin, as has been suggested, there were two possible explanations for their appearance over Sweden:\n\n(1) \"Sweden is systematically being dotted in on a Russian artillery map.\"\n\n(2) Sweden is being used as an object at demonstration, directed not at us, but to the big world.\"\n\nMilitary authorities said little attention was paid to a rumor that a bomber which crashed Monday had been hit by a rocket bomb.\n\nAnd at long last, perhaps a clue. From the August 15, 1946 edition of the New York Times:\n\nSWEDES FIND ROCKET CLUE\n\nLettered Metal Fragment Is Now Under Close Study\n\nStockholm, Sweden, Aug 14 (U.P.) - Swedish Army investigators have recovered a fragment of metal containing imprinted letters that may solve the mystery of rockets that have been flashing over Sweden and other Scandinavian countries since last May, it was announced today. The fragment was reported to be a 2.75-inch section of metal. It has been placed in the hands of the Defense Research Institute for investigation. Three additional rockets were reported sighted in southern Sweden last night, flying silently in a southwesterly direction at a high altitude. These reports said the rockets, bright as stars, passed overhead at intervals of five minutes. Premier Per Albin Hansson announced today that the Swedish Government has not yet made any representations to any foreign Government in connection with the rockets, not having yet defined their nature and origin.\n\nBut many had already assumed the answer without the need for physical remnants. From an editorial from the August 15, 1946 edition of the Waterloo, Iowa Daily Courier:\n\nSwedish Rocket Scare\n\nThe mysterious objects like comets which have appeared recently over the skies of Sweden indicate that the Soviet government is attempting a game of scientific bluff. Since the objects, which are too small to carry explosives, come from the Baltic coast of Germany controlled by the Russians, it is easy to guess that the Red army is using this method in attempting to build up fear that the Russians have developed some secret weapon not possessed by other powers.\n\nThis whole field of rockets is shrouded in secrecy throughout the world, although American scientists do not doubt that the Russians are well advanced in their experiments.\n\nThe Russians are sensitive on the relationship between new weapons and politics. They have accused the United States of attempting to use the atomic bomb for political purposes, although the mere fact that this country possesses exclusive know-how on the atomic bomb would be sufficient to provoke such a complaint from Soviet spokesmen. And, in view of the Russian emphasis on power politics, no sensible person will doubt that if the Soviet government possessed some highly important secret weapon it would use it for political purposes.\n\nThe sending of the mysterious rockets over Sweden proves that point. The USSR includes 9,619,791 square miles of territory including vast uninhabited places. This provides, of course, adequate territory in which to conduct long-range rocket tests in the Russians desired to conduct them in secret. The fact that the rockets are being sent over a foreign land, therefore, indicates they are being sent for publicity purposes.\n\nAnd from columnist Drew Pearson's national Washington Merry Go Round column in the August 16, 1946 edition of the Chester, Pennsylvania Times, the beginning of an especially ominous tone to the events...\n\nWASHINGTON -- Back in 1919, right after the last war, the Philadelphia Public Ledger hired a special correspondent named E.J. Dillon to cover the peace conference. Mr. Dillon was a good newspaper man. He told the truth.\n\nBut as a youngster living near Philadelphia and reading Mr. Dillon every morning, I vividly recall how I and others who had built up high hopes for permanent peace did not like the truth. Eventually the Ledger got so many reader protests against Mr. Dillon's frank and pessimistic reporting that it had to run a special editorial defending him.\n\nThe trouble with Mr. Dillon was that he was telling his readers that the 1919 Paris peace conference was going to lead to another war and his readers at that time didn't want to think about war.\n\nHaving returned to the U.S.A. a few days ago from the present Paris peace conference, I suspect that some of my own readers also have been cussing me out as a pessimist, a kill-joy, and a belittler of modern diplomacy.\n\nIf so, I don't particularly blame them. The weather is hot, the vacation season beckons, the headlines are playing up the intriguing question of whether Mrs. Lottie Lockman did or did not poison her neighbors in DuPont, Ind., and whether a Fairfield, Ill., grandmother poisoned her 3-year-old grandson with a sandwich. Congress has gone home, government workers sweat out the humid August sunshine, we have just finished celebrating the first anniversary of our great victory over Japan, and on the surface there seems no apparent reason for worry about more war.\n\nBeneath the surface, however, certain ominous developments are seething in the near east which could plunge us into a war more horrible than anything ever envisaged by the mind of man. Behind the scenes, the top military men of Russia and England and, to some extent, the United States, are now maneuvering for positions for a war which some of them think could come in a matter of months -- even weeks.\n\nHere are some of the secret moves which, only one year after a war to end war, make the world so laden with dynamite:\n\n1. Intelligence agencies have learned that Stalin now has three giant airborne armies, totaling 120,000 men each, poised along the Black sea. They are alerted and prepared for action -- presumably against Turkey.\n\n2. The soviet politburo has decided on a showdown with Turkey over the Dardanelles -- at once. Last week all the Russian field marshals met with members of the politburo for three days in Odessa. Afterward, Russia sent Turkey a demand that the Montreux treaty covering the Dardanelles be revised at once -- and be revised only by the soviet satellites.\n\n3. The Russian navy is now concentrated in the Black sea ports of Sevastopol and Feodosiya.\n\n4. The British foreign office and the British general staff have decided that the time for a showdown with Russia is at hand. Their intelligence reports indicate feverish soviet experiments with the atomic bomb and the cosmic ray. The presence of rocket bombs over Sweden is known to be Russian experimentation with radio-controlled rockets eventually calculated to hit England or perhaps cross the Arctic circle.\n\nBritish scientists know that the Russians may wind up with the atomic bomb or even the more deadly cosmic ray if the soviet is given another year to experiment. The British also know that the United States is not ready to wage a joint Anglo-American war against Russia, but they are convinced that, if Russia and England should clash, the U.S.A. would soon come in on the British side.\n\n5. The British general staff has moved three crack divisions into Iraq for a showdown with Moscow over Iran. The British fleet is poised in Mediterranean waters. At least nine other British divisions and the entire royal air force are ready to support Britain's determination to dominate Iran. Baghdad, capital of Iraq, is being heavily reinforced by the British.\n\n6. The U. S. army is now spending increased amounts to fortify Alaska and is working in close cooperation with Canada on defense of the entire Arctic northwest. The Russian spy trials in Canada revealed that Moscow was collecting all possible information regarding northwest Canada and Alaska; also that all details of U.S. troops were reported back to Moscow, even including the movements of regiments in the southern United States.\n\n7. The Russians are heavily fortifying the coast of Albania This gives them partial control of the entrance of the Adriatic and might keep an allied fleet from rescuing U.S.-British troops at Trieste. Moscow also has been shifting the red army in Europe, has replaced war veterans with fresh men. In Germany the Red army is 750,000 strong. In Romania 90,000 Red soldiers have been increased to 350,000 men. Four Russian divisions are in the Czech Sudetenland. A total of 6000 Russian planes are in Poland and Romania.\n\n8. Twelve factories in Russian-occupied Germany are pouring out munitions of war. The old Skoda works in Czechoslovakia once used by Hitler, is turning out quantities of arms of an interchangeable type for use in either the Czech or red army. Poland and Yugoslavia also are manufacturing standardized Russian arms The armament race once more is on.\n\nThat same day, still another report. From the August 16, 1946 edition of the Winnipeg, Canada Free Press:\n\nAnother Projectile\n\nSTOCKHOLM, Aug. 16 (Reuters) -- Window panes were broken Friday in Malmoe, Sweden when a projectile exploded over the town. This was the latest in a series of reports of mysterious projectiles, giving rise to the theory that Sweden may be the testing-ground for rockets.\n\nAnd by this time, Americans were publicly on the scene. From the August 20, 1946 edition of the New York Times:\n\nTwo United States experts on aerial warfare, General James Doolittle and David Sarnoff, arrived in Stockholm today, apparently independent of each other. The official explanation is that General Doolittle, who is now vice-president of the Shell Oil Company, is inspecting Shell branch offices in Europe and selling oil and gasoline, while General Sarnoff, who is president of the Radio Corporation of America and a former member of General Dwight D. Eisenhower's London staff, is studying the market for radio equipment. The two men arrive here as reports on 'phantom bombs' are more numerous than ever. The Chief of the Swedish Defense Staff, Col. C.R.S. Kempt, said tonight he was extremely interested in asking the two generals advice and, if possible, would place all available reports before them.\n\nThe next day, a seemingly definitive proclamation about the Soviet activities in Germany. From the August 20, 1946 edition of the New York Times:\n\nRussia Said To Make V-Weapons In Zone\n\nBerlin, Aug 21 (Reuter) - Russian and German technicians are manufacturing new V weapons in a number of former German arms plants that are working at the full level of their present capacity, well documented and extremely reliable information reaching Berlin from the Soviet occupation zone said today. Evidence has been provided that the Russians are engaged in the production of heavy armaments, special jet aircraft, rocket fuels for V weapons and U-boat and torpedo components in at least ten special factories in several parts of Russian-occupied Germany. Although the Russians do not at present permit Allied investigation of activity inside the closed guarded arms factories in the Russian occupied areas it has been learned that production of components of advanced V weapons is going ahead in such factories as Siemens and Telefunken in Berlin, Nieder-Sachsenwerke at Wolfsleben and the Klein-Bodungen factory, all of which are subsidiaries of the big Bleich-Roeder concern. In the Magdeburg plant of the Krupps combine the Russians are producing heavy armament equipment that is being shipped into Soviet Russia, it was stated. Special aircraft fuels for jet engines are being produced in the giant Leuna oil plant near Merseburg in Saxony, but production is believed to be on a comparatively small scale, it was added.\n\nAnd from the Washington Post, via the August 20, 1946 edition of the Lock Haven, Pennsylvania Express, a more prosaic explanation of Soviet motivation:\n\nOther Viewpoints\n\nSales Pressure\n\n(From The Washington Post)\n\nFor the past six weeks or more mysterious objects have been seen hurtling through the skies over Sweden; they have also been observed over the neighboring countries of Norway, Finland and Denmark. Now and then a noise, as of a great explosion in mid-air, has been heard, after which fragments of some hard, black, metallic substance have been discovered on the ground. It seemed altogether improbable that these fragments could be meteorites or that so many of them would fall at one time in one particular part of the world. Anyway, the Swedish population, angry and apprehensive, was very soon convinced that the missiles were radio-controlled explosive rockets on the principle of the German V-2 bomb and that they were being launched from Soviet Russia as part of a calculated plan of intimidation or aggression. Both the anger and the anxiety have been considerably increased since last Monday, when one of the rockets crashed into a Swedish military reconnaissance plane, blowing it up and killing its crew of three.\n\nThe Russian motive for these eerie demonstrations is not altogether clear. Not unnaturally, many Swedes fear it may be preliminary to an invasion. There is small doubt that Russia would be pleased if, in the interest of her \"security,\" she could add a Communist Sweden to her defensive ring of puppet states. There is even less doubt that Russia would like to have control of Swedish industry. By contrast with all the rest of Europe, of course, Sweden is highly prosperous; at the same time, a concentrated attack from the skies might soon destroy her power of resisting an invasion from the east through Finland.\n\nHowever, the demonstration does not appear to be so much a prelude to actual invasion as a piece of high pressure salesmanship in the Russian manner. Russia is trying to negotiate a trade agreement with Sweden on terms of credit which the Swedes consider highly disadvantageous to themselves. Thus the purpose of the rockets may be to persuade the Swedish Government to take a more favorable attitude in the commercial negotiations with Moscow.\n\nThe next day came reports that the p"
