        "text": "MOSCOW — Moscow on Wednesday granted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych protection “on the territory of Russia,” shortly after the fugitive leader sought help from the Kremlin, according to an official quoted by Russian news agencies.\n\nMeanwhile, a respected Russian news organization reported that Yanukovych was seen in a Moscow hotel and was now staying in a Kremlin sanatorium just outside the city.\n\n“I have to ask Russia to ensure my personal safety from extremists,” Yanukovych said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies on Thursday.\n\nShortly after, the same three Russian news agencies quoted an unnamed Russian official saying that Yanukovych’s request for protection “was satisfied on the territory of Russia.”\n\nThe news comes as tensions escalate between Russia and the West over the situation in Ukraine. Russian warships cruised into a Cuban port Wednesday as President Vladimir Putin massed troops near the Ukraine-Russia border. Meanwhile, armed men seized regional government headquarters and parliament in Ukraine’s Crimea on Thursday and raised the Russian flag.\n\nYanukovych, who fled from Ukraine’s capital Kiev last week, said in a Thursday statement that he still considers himself to be the legitimate leader.\n\n“I, Viktor Fedorovich Yanukovich appeal to the people of Ukraine. As before I still consider myself to be the lawful head of the Ukrainian state, chosen freely by the will of the Ukrainian people.\n\n“Now it is becoming clear that the people in southeastern Ukraine and in Crimea do not accept the power vacuum and complete lawlessness in the country, when the heads of ministries are appointed by the mob.”\n\n“I officially declare my intention to fight to the end for the implementation of important compromise agreements to bring Ukraine out of its deep political crisis.”\n\nRBK reported Wednesday evening that Yanukovych was staying at the Barvikha sanatorium, which is run by the presidential administration’s property department. The spokesman for this department, Viktor Khrekov, told The Associated Press on Thursday that he has no information about this.\n\nThe RBK report was impossible to confirm, but security at the Ukraina Hotel was unusually heavy late Wednesday, with police watching from parked vehicles outside and guards posted throughout the lobby. Some of Yanukovych’s allies, also reported to have been at the hotel, may have still been there.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman also said he had no information about Yanukovych’s reported arrival in Moscow.\n\nRBK said the information came from one of Russia’s wealthiest businessmen and was confirmed by a government official, neither of whom was identified. The article was under the byline of respected journalists, including RBK’s editor in chief Elizaveta Osetinskaya, who has high-level contacts in Russian business circles."
