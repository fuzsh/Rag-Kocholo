        "text": "Modern scientists say with confidence: by 2030, Russian cosmonauts will go to Mars. It was the dream of the Red Planet that became the \"guiding star\" for Korolev. He will strive for it throughout his life, subordinating his every step, every realized idea to one thing - to conquer Mars.\n\nDream\n\nWithin the walls of the secret laboratory OKB-1, the development of a ship will be in full swing, on which cosmonauts will be able to make long-term expeditions, including mysterious planet to get to know a new, more advanced civilization. That this was possible was believed by both Korolev and his closest associates, primarily Friedrich Zander, who would become Korolev's teacher for many years to come. All his life, Sergei Pavlovich will seek and \"educate\" people like Zander - passionate and enthusiastic, ready to endure all hardships and \"sacrifice on the altar.\"\n\nKolyma\n\nIn September 1933, Mikhail Tukhachevsky issues an order to establish the Jet Research Institute. Korolev receives the position of deputy director in it. Tukhachevsky strongly \"recommends\" Korolev to forget about space flights and focus on rocket science. A year after Tukhachevsky's arrest and execution in 1937, Korolyov would be accused of sabotage and sentenced to 10 years in the camps. He will go to Kolyma, to the Maldyak gold mine. Neither hunger, nor scurvy, nor unbearable conditions of existence could break Korolev - he will calculate his first radio-controlled rocket right on the wall of the barracks. In May 1940, Korolev returned to Moscow, and after 4 months he was sentenced to 8 years and sent to a special prison, where he works under the leadership of Tupolev.\n\nRussian spy\n\nKorolev meets the great victory in the \"sharashka\" at the Kazan aircraft plant, where the development of rocket engines. Although, on Stalin's personal order, he has actually been free for a year now. In September 1945, he was assigned another \"mission\" - to go to Germany to study the V-2 ballistic missile. On the tests of the German rocket, which were organized by the British for the allies, Korolev is sent as the driver of one of the generals. But one of the soldiers, as it turned out later, an English intelligence officer, did not believe in the image of the Soviet artilleryman created by Korolev. The Englishman was surprised by the absolute absence of orders (he had never met such Russians!) and “the forehead is too high for an artillery captain.” At the end of the summer of 1946, Korolev was appointed chief designer of OKB-1 and set the most important task - to create a Soviet analogue of the German V-2 ballistic missile. Two years later, Korolev begins testing the R-1 ballistic missile, and in 1950 puts it into service.\n\nKhrushchev\n\nNikita Sergeevich adored the Queen. Immediately after the launch of the first satellite, the General Secretary gave the order to build a two-story mansion for Korolev near VDNKh. For each new victory - a generous reward: prizes and high titles. But this was not important for Korolev, but the fact that Khrushchev supported his most daring plans, and the ruler had his own reasons for this: he loved the jubilation of the public, large-scale celebrations, awarding the winners, and at the same time himself among them. In 1960, a grandiose plan for a “space offensive” developed by Korolev was presented: flights to the Moon and the construction of a lunar settlement, a long-term expedition to Mars and the creation of a Martian base, a flyby of Venus and regular interplanetary expeditions. No one doubted this, and they worked on it.\n\nNot a Nobel Laureate\n\nAfter the launch of the first satellite, the Nobel Committee will send a request: to whom should the prize be given? Khrushchev will answer that the satellite launched the people and the social system. The “justification” was the secrecy stamp, which was imposed on almost all of Korolev’s developments, and with them, on his personality. In fact, this was not the case - the Queen was well known both in Europe and in America. So the Nobel Prize “passed” by Korolev. Instead, it is shortly before the opportunity to receive Nobel Prize became the only person in Soviet history, who, without being rehabilitated, was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor.\n\nContrary to\n\nLater, Khrushchev's inconsistency and impulsiveness will lead to the fact that the funding of the Martian project will be significantly cut - and this will make Korolev confused for the first time in his life. Many dreams were not destined to become a reality for a banal reason: lack of money. But as he once created a rocket plane against Tukhachevsky's order, against Stalin's order - the rocket on which Gagarin flew into space, he decides to continue work on the Martian ship in spite of Khrushchev's ban. And it turns out to be right - developments will be needed soon. After the Americans launch the prototype of the Apollo lunar spacecraft for the first time in May 1964, Nikita Sergeevich, worried, will give the order: “Do not give the moon to the Americans!” The Queen will be instructed to urgently join the \"lunar race\". Working 24 hours a day will take too much strength from the elderly Queen.\n\nlast birthday\n\nOn January 11, 1966, Sergei Pavlovich will be released from the hospital, where the designer was being prepared for an operation to remove a sarcoma. Tomorrow is the Queen's birthday! The holiday turned out to be sad - without guests and feasts. He will remember his last birthday when he “confessed” to his closest friends, Yuri Gagarin and Alexei Leonov, including talking about the torture he had to go through in Butyrka prison. According to the version widespread today, it was then that both jaws of Korolyov were broken, which caused his death: during the operation, the endotracheal tube could not be inserted into the trachea. Sergey Pavlovich Korolev died on January 14, 1966 from acute heart failure.\n\nFROM RELATIVE\n\nJourney of Prisoner No. 1442 from prison to space 2002, January\n\nInterviewed by Alexander VITKOVSKY.\n\nSergei Pavlovich Korolev would have turned 95 today\n\nThe correspondent of \"Parliamentary newspaper\" met with the daughter of Korolyov - professor, doctor of medical sciences, laureate State Prize USSR Natalia Sergeevna Koroleva. In memory of her father, a home museum was created in her apartment. Our and foreign cosmonauts, scientists of world renown, space centers and cosmodromes, relatives and friends of Sergei Pavlovich considered it an honor to replenish it with amazing exhibits. Suffice it to say that until recently this museum was the only one in our country where the lunar soil brought to Earth in 1970 by the Luna-16 station is stored. And the mistress and keeper of the museum herself can talk for hours about the life of her father.\n\n- Natalia Sergeevna, many books have been written about the Queen, thousands of articles, even a wonderful feature film \"Taming the Fire\" was shot, where the features of Sergei Pavlovich are easily guessed in the main character. But there are six years in his life, about which little is known so far. This is an arrest in 1938, a transfer to Magadan, then work at a gold mine and in the \"sharashka\" of the NKVD.\n\n- On that ill-fated Monday, June 27, 1938, I was at the dacha in Barvikha with my nanny, but from the words of my mother, Xenia Maximilianovna Vincentini and grandmother, Maria Nikolaevna Balanina, I know everything almost by the minute. Home, in the eleventh apartment of the house number 28 on Konyushkovskaya street, my mother came late. At the entrance I noticed two men, carefully looking at passers-by. Having risen to the sixth floor, already anxious, she knocked on the door. The father opened it and, in response to her question about two strangers, he hugged his wife by the trembling shoulders and said quietly: \"Well, this is, apparently, for me.\"\n\n(Ending on page 7)\n\n(Ending. Beginning on page 1)\n\nBut why such doom? Did he think about the arrest?\n\n- By that time, many of his friends and work colleagues had already been arrested, and he was denied an extension of access to secret work. It was an ominous omen. In addition, at the end of May, an accident occurred on bench tests of the first Soviet rocket plane, which my father designed. Sergei Pavlovich received a serious head injury, spent three weeks in the Botkin hospital and was on outpatient treatment. But he continued to hope for the best. The rest of that evening, my parents sat next to me. Without turning on the light, they listened to the gramophone - a record of Russian folk songs that had just been bought. At half past eleven at night there was a loud knock on the door: \"Open! NKVD.\" Those two and the building manager came in as witnesses. They presented a warrant, turned the whole apartment upside down, sealed one of the two rooms and left in the morning, taking documents, drawings, money, letters, photographs told his wife.\n\n- And then there was Butyrka, the inner prison of the NKVD on Lubyanka, again Butyrka prison, a quick and wrong trial, a stage to Kolyma\n\n- Yes, that's right. But first there was a brutal interrogation. It was not possible to get a confession from his father in hostile activities with the help of beatings. And then the investigator Nikolai Bykov threatened that he would arrest his wife and send his daughter to an orphanage.\n\n- That is you?\n\n- Yes. Then I was only three years old. Worried and caring about us, my father gave a \"confessional\" testimony, hoping to get the truth in court. But it was a vain hope. A closed hearing of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR took place on 27 September. Korolev retracted his testimony given during the preliminary investigation. But this was of no interest to anyone, and he was sentenced to a ten-year prison term with a defeat in political rights for five years and confiscation of property. So prisoner No. 1442 appeared in the prison offices.\n\n- At that time, relatives of the repressed wrote applications to all instances with a request to reconsider criminal cases\n\n- Everyone was afraid that my mother might also be arrested. Therefore, letters were written by the mother of Sergei Pavlovich, Maria Nikolaevna Balanina. She sent statements and telegrams to the People's Commissar of the NKVD Yezhov and even personally to Stalin, turned to Heroes of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gromov and Valentina Grizodubova for help. Low bow to these two famous Soviet pilots who personally knew the Queen. With their help, a review of the case was obtained, and on June 13, 1939, the same Ulrich who had sentenced his father to ten years appealed his own sentence. The case was raised for a new investigation, and the head of the Novocherkassk prison, where the father was transferred, was sent a secret statement about the annulment of the verdict with an order to announce this to the prisoner. But the Queen was no longer in prison. The echelon with convicts took my father to the east and no one was going to return the political prisoner. And the order returned to Moscow.\n\n- Natalia Sergeevna, what happened to the prisoner Korolyov at that time? (Lord, how ridiculous this phrase sounds: \"prisoner Korolev\".)\n\n- Indeed, now it is hard to believe that the future twice Hero of Socialist Labor, academician, laureate of the Lenin Prize was a convict. And not just a prisoner, but a goner who barely survived. In the summer of 1939, in a barred freight car, he arrived in Vladivostok, then seven days on the ship \"Dalstroy\" (formerly \"Genrikh Yagoda\") to the Nagaev Bay \"Gate of the Kalym Territory\" and then to the gold mine \"Maldyak\", located seven hundred kilometers from Magadan. But even there he supported himself, did exercises, wiped himself with snow and was sure that he would still do what he loved. But from the meager rations, unbearable labor in the extraction of gold for 12 hours a day, cold, harassment of criminals and camp guards, he was completely exhausted. Scurvy set in, legs began to swell. In those years, at this mine, 200,250 people died every month from exhaustion and disease. Death awaited Sergei Pavlovich too. He could no longer walk, he could hardly eat, his jaw was broken, and his teeth fell out from scurvy.\n\nFrom the memoirs of Sergei Korolev's fellow campers:\n\n“In the fall, the former director of the Moscow Aviation Plant, Mikhail Usachev, was transferred to the mine. He was undeservedly accused of the death of Valery Chkalov, who crashed in December 1938 on a plane built at this plant. physical strength, and besides, a boxer, Usachev peculiarly \"registered\" among the camp urkagans. To begin with, with all the class hatred, he cleaned the face of the local gangster authority and personally removed him from the post of headman, thereby showing who is now the boss in the zone. The criminal brethren and the camp authorities respected him. Examining the uncomplicated zek household, he saw a prisoner barely showing signs of life in a pile of dirty rags. \"This is the King lying around,\" the former headman explained, \"a goner, one of yours, one of the political ones.\" Usachev hardly recognized the exhausted man of his acquaintance, the aircraft designer Sergei Korolev. He immediately made sure that the patient was transferred to a medical isolation ward. But there were no medicines. Scurvy was treated with raw potatoes and coniferous decoction, and all other diseases from colds to heart attacks were treated with potassium permanganate diluted in water. Usachev arranged an additional grub for the patient - at the expense of part of the rations of those criminals who mocked the political prisoners the most. And death receded.\n\n- How long did he spend in Kolyma?\n\n- Almost four months, but those were the worst days of his life. In November 1939, a request for transfer to Moscow finally came. There was a long journey along the Kolyma highway to Magadan, during which the sick prisoner almost died of starvation. He was saved by a loaf of bread left by some kind person on a well log house. She helped to survive. And in Nagaev Bay, a new disappointment. The stage of prisoners and those who have already served their term, as well as ordinary passengers of only 1,100 people, has already been formed and departed for Vladivostok on the Indigirka ship. The king was very upset. He rushed to Moscow and did not yet know that being late for the ship had given him life. On the night of December 12, a severe winter storm threw the Indigirka onto reefs in the La Perouse Strait. Three Japanese schooners that arrived a day later could save only the passengers and crew, and more than 740 prisoners who were locked in the holds died.\n\nHaving reached the transit prison of Khabarovsk, Sergei Pavlovich was already so weak that the prison warden (it’s even hard to believe) released him late in the evening alone and without guards to the local doctor. The doctor bandaged his father's legs, which had already begun to rot from a lack of vitamins, and later ensured that the stage was provided with beets, carrots and sauerkraut. Korolev remembered the name of this doctor Dneprovskaya for the rest of his life, but he could not find it after his release.\n\nFrom the memoirs of his wife Xenia Maximilianovna Vincentini:\n\n- In March 1940, I was allowed to see my husband in the Butyrka prison. There were a lot of people in the room divided by three bars. On the one hand, like animals in a zoo, the prisoners stood, on the other hand, we, their relatives, in the middle of the sentry. Serezha's appearance was terrible. Instead of clothes, some rags, tears rolled down his face. We tried to talk. But what could be said in such an environment? Everyone is pushing, shouting. I came out of there completely killed.\n\n“Thanks to my grandmother’s statement addressed to Lavrenty Beria himself,” Natalia Sergeevna continues her story, relatives were allowed to give the father a parcel with things, shoes, shirt, underwear, socks, trousers. Meanwhile, an expert commission was created, witnesses were interviewed at the place of work. Unfortunately, only a few found the strength to tell the truth to the NKVD investigators. But, having familiarized himself with the conclusion of the commission, the father was happy to learn that his rocket plane had been successfully tested. Pilot Vladimir Fedorov took to the skies three times, confirming the correctness of Korolev's calculations.\n\n- So, Sergei Pavlovich should have been acquitted for lack of corpus delicti?\n\nEveryone hoped so. The indictment even included a resolution from the deputy head of the department for special cases: \"Submit materials for consideration by the Special Meeting of the NKVD of the USSR with a proposal to stop this case.\" But the Special Meeting decided otherwise. On July 10, 1940, in the absence of the accused, it decided: \"Korolev Sergey Pavlovich for participation in an anti-Soviet Trotskyist organization to be imprisoned in a corrective labor camp for a period of eight years, starting from June 28, 1938.\" From grief, grandmother and mother almost lost their minds. Financial compensation for part of the confiscated property, political rights (that is, the opportunity to participate in elections), a reduction in the term by only two years, and Sevzheldorlag instead of Sevvostlag, that's all that was achieved\n\n- But what about Sergei Pavlovich?\n\n- A few days before the trial, on both sides of a piece of paper in small, compact handwriting, he wrote a long letter personally to Stalin.\n\nFrom a letter to S.P. Koroleva I.V. Stalin:\n\n\"Soviet aircraft must have a decisive superiority over any enemy in terms of their flight performance. Only decisive air superiority in speed, rate of climb and flight altitude can be a reliable means of defense. In this respect, conventional aviation is almost at its limit. There is only one missile (i.e. jet. A.V.) aircraft. In the Soviet Union, work on rocket aircraft was carried out by me practically since 1935. Similar work was not carried out anywhere in the USSR by anyone. Before my arrest, several types of small missiles were carried out and hundreds of testing them in the laboratory, on stands and in flight. For the first time in technology, the main tests of a jet aircraft were successfully carried out in 1938. I can prove my innocence and I want to continue work on rocket aircraft for the defense of the USSR. \"\n\n- A humiliated, almost trampled underfoot by blatant lawlessness, a man whose life hangs in the balance, sincerely worries about his work for the good of the whole country.\n\n- But how did Korolev end up in the Tupolev \"sharashka\"?\n\n- Having learned about the decision of the special \"troika\", he continued to send his statements. Like last time, at the request of his mother, Mikhail Gromov and Valentina Grizodubova helped. Each of them wrote on the letterhead of the deputy Supreme Council USSR request addressed to Beria. Two weeks later, the documents lay on the desk of the formidable people's commissar. And on September 18, 1940, Korolev was transferred from the Butyrka prison to the Special Technical Bureau of the NKVD.\n\nTupolev \"sharaga\" or TsKB-29 of the NKVD of the USSR.\n\nThe Central Design Bureau No. 29 of the aviation profile was organized in 1939. Here, on the territory of the current Aviation Scientific and Technical Complex named after A.N. Tupolev, there were almost all the major developers of domestic aircraft and weapons: Andrey Tupolev, Vladimir Myasishchev, Vladimir Petlyakov, Sergey Yeger, Alexander Cheremukhin - more than 120 people in total. It was in TsKB-29 that the projects of the Pe-2, Tu-2 bombers and some fighters were created.\n\n- In 1942, my father was transferred to Kazan, and he returned to Moscow and met with us only after his release in 1944. It was only later, in 1957, that there was a rehabilitation, the launch of the first artificial satellite of the Earth, the spacecraft Elektron, Molniya-1, Kosmos, Zond. And, finally, the triumph of his work is the Vostok spacecraft, on which Yuri Gagarin entered Earth orbit for the first time in the history of mankind, and Voskhod, from which Alexei Leonov was the first in the world to step into outer space.\n\n- Tell me, how did the prison and the camp affect the character of your father?\n\n- Mom said that he was always a direct and sharp person, purposeful and convinced of the importance of his work. Maybe that's why so many trials fell to his lot. Years of imprisonment taught him, as they say, to take a hit. He was exceptionally efficient and saved every minute. Saving a working day, I flew from Moscow to Baikonur only at night and considered a few hours of sleep en route to be quite sufficient. He had an explosive temper and a reputation for being a formidable but fair boss. Everyone knows his spacing at the cosmodrome: \"You will go to Moscow! On the sleepers!\". But he also cooled down quickly, and if he was wrong, he admitted mistakes, taking full responsibility for any miscalculations. He didn’t particularly believe in omens, but he didn’t tolerate women at the cosmodrome, he always went to rocket launches in the same “happy” suit and carried two coins one kopeck each in his pocket - also for good luck. Sergei Pavlovich always took the problems of his subordinates to heart. For this he was loved and respected.\n\nFrom the memoirs of the employees of the Design Bureau S. Korolev:\n\n\"In 1957, after the launch of the first satellite, the French winemaker Henri Maier made a bet with the Soviet consul that people would never see reverse side Moon. To anyone who refutes his statement, he promised to give a thousand bottles of champagne from his cellars.\n\nAfter the Soviet Luna-3 station photographed the far side of the Moon on October 31, 1959, the Soviet government puzzled for a long time about where to deliver a thousand bottles of sparkling French wine. It was decided in fairness that the entire batch was sent to the Academy of Sciences. On the eve of the new year, 1960, the chief designer congratulated his employees on the holiday, and those who were involved in the flight of the station received French champagne as a gift.\"\n\nI was about to leave the hospitable home when Natalia Sergeevna asked me her question.\n\n- Have you heard that for the creation and launch of the world's first artificial Earth satellite, Sergei Pavlovich should have received the Nobel Prize in 1957?\n\n- ...?\n\n- Unfortunately, this did not happen. They say that Nikita Khrushchev replied to the Nobel Committee's inquiry about the installation data of the chief designer of the spacecraft that the creator of the new technology is all Soviet people. However, then few people knew about the Queen and in the Soviet Union. Both he and all his work were marked with a secret stamp of special importance, and the first official and public information about him was an obituary in the Pravda newspaper, published only two days after his death on January 16, 1966. So death declassified my father's name. Only after that, Sergei Pavlovich Korolev became known not only in our country, but throughout the world.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n(December 30, 1906 (January 12, 1907), Zhitomir, Volyn province - January 14, 1966, Moscow, RSFSR, USSR) - Soviet scientist, designer and main organizer of the production of rocket and space technology and missile weapons of the USSR, the founder of practical astronautics. One of the largest figures of the 20th century in the field of space rocket and shipbuilding.\n\nSergei Korolev is a well-known creator of Soviet rocket and space technology, which ensured strategic parity and made the USSR an advanced rocket and space power, and a key figure in human space exploration, the creator of practical astronautics. On his initiative and under his leadership, the launch of the first artificial satellite of the Earth and the first cosmonaut of the planet, Yuri Gagarin, was carried out.\n\nTwice Hero of Socialist Labor, laureate of the Lenin Prize, Academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Member of the CPSU since 1953. Colonel. He died on January 14, 1966 in Moscow due to heart failure. Buried in the Kremlin wall.\n\nCandidate of Technical Sciences L. MATIYASEVICH\n\nS. P. Korolev at the training ground during tests of the Pe-2r aircraft with a missile\n\nDeputy S.P. Koroleva, Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR Konstantin Davydovich Bushuev (1914-1978).\n\nDeputy S.P. Korolev Pavel Vladimirovich Tsybin (1905-1992).\n\nHead of the design department of OKB-1 Evgeny Fedorovich Ryazanov (1923-1975).\n\nDuring the period of the Soyuz-Apollo program, the Soviet delegation was invited to visit the NASA ranch in the USA.\n\nOnly 20-30 years ago it seemed that the name of Sergei Pavlovich Korolev - the creator of the first artificial satellite of the Earth, the Vostok spacecraft, which lifted the first of earthlings into space, and the other most advanced space technology - would forever remain in the memory of the people. However, not every current schoolboy and student knows Korolev, Gagarin, and other pioneers in the Universe, who until recently the whole country was proud of. Here is an example. Many readers of \"Science and Life\" are probably watching the popular TV program \"Oh, lucky!\", Trying to answer a variety of questions from the host Dmitry Dibrov together with the players and get to win a million rubles. One of the questions of the program, shown by NTV last autumn, was: \"Which country launched the first artificial Earth satellite into space: the USA, China, Russia, India?\" \"USA\" - was the answer of a student of the Faculty of Economics of Moscow State University. The representative of the most educated part of our youth did not know that this outstanding achievement belongs to her country, Russia. Memoirs about S. P. Korolev and his associates, sent to the editorial office by a researcher central house aviation and cosmonautics by Leonty Mikhailovich Matiyasevich, are addressed primarily to the younger generation and, of course, to all those who want to know more about the history of Russian cosmonautics.\n\nAmong the outstanding scientists of the twentieth century, one of the leading places rightfully belongs to the founder of practical cosmonautics, the General Designer of space technology, Sergei Pavlovich Korolev. Many books and articles have been written about him. Meanwhile, today, when space flights have become almost an ordinary event, most people no longer know that the first outstanding achievements of the USSR in space exploration are associated with his name.\n\nOn August 21, 1957, the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile was flown. The appearance in our country at the height of the Cold War of such a formidable type of weapon played an important role in maintaining peace in subsequent years. After all, up to this point, already having atomic weapons, we had no means of delivering it, and US strategic bombers were near our borders. On October 4 of the same year, Tsiolkovsky's bold dream came true: for the first time in the history of mankind, an artificial satellite of the Earth was launched. This was followed by the first flight into space of Yuri Gagarin, flights of other manned spacecraft \"Vostok\" and \"Voskhod\", the first exit of a man into open space, flights to the Moon, Venus, Mars ... The creator of this most advanced space technology in the world is the General designer Sergei Pavlovich Korolev. Under his leadership, satellites of the Elektron, Molniya-1, Kosmos series and the project of the Soyuz spacecraft were also developed, on which docking with the American Apollo spacecraft was carried out for the first time in orbit.\n\nIn the spring of 1960, I, a military specialist, had the good fortune to meet, and then for many years to cooperate with, Experimental Design Bureau No. 1 (OKB-1), led by Sergei Pavlovich Korolev. Leading figures of science and technology and talented young people worked side by side in this unique team. The spirit of constant creative search reigned here, independence and initiative were valued. Undoubtedly, this was the merit of Sergei Pavlovich, he knew how to unite talented, dedicated people around him, he never suppressed them with his authority, but, on the contrary, created conditions for the development of everyone's abilities.\n\nSimplicity and democracy in dealing with subordinates were combined in him with firmness and exactingness in work. Korolev could easily approach any ordinary employee and discuss the issue with him. Despite the fact that Sergei Pavlovich had great power as the head of several thousands of collectives, he enjoyed great authority in the government and the Central Committee\n\nCPSU, one could argue with him. In the interests of the cause, he agreed with the opponent, even if it was contrary to his own plans.\n\nSergei Pavlovich had a brilliant organizational talent, colossal capacity for work, self-control and endurance. I saw him at the Baikonur cosmodrome during the preparation and implementation of the first ever group flight of two spacecraft. On August 12, 1962, Vostok-3 was launched into orbit, piloted by cosmonaut Andrian Nikolaev, and a day later Vostok-4 was launched with cosmonaut Pavel Popovich. At that time, the experience of controlling spacecraft was still small. One can only imagine the degree of responsibility of a person, on whose decisions the success of two space flights at once depended! Meanwhile, Korolyov did not show any signs of excitement, fuss, haste. He appeared only where and when his participation was really needed. I remember that Sergei Pavlovich invited us, employees of allied enterprises, to the assembly and test building, showed us the spacecraft that was supposed to fly to Venus, and spoke about plans for future flights. On the same days, Korolev held a technical meeting on issues completely unrelated to the upcoming flights. In the dining room at dinner he was always friendly, remembered funny stories, joked.\n\nGeneral Designer Korolyov had many brilliant assistants, and I worked closely with some of them.\n\nIn those years, only narrow circle people, just like Korolev, he was a secret identity. An intelligent, charming man, Bushuev at the same time was distinguished by firmness and determination. Later, in 1975, he became widely known as the head of the Soviet-American Soyuz-Apollo project from the USSR.\n\nAnother deputy of S.P. Korolev is Pavel Vladimirovich Tsybin. In the past, an aircraft designer who headed his own design bureau, he had extensive knowledge, clearly and quickly interacted with industrial enterprises. Tsybin knew how to organize the business in such a way that the development, manufacture and delivery to OKB-1 of the necessary samples of equipment were carried out in an unprecedentedly short time. Under him, work that would normally take years was completed in a matter of months.\n\nThe soul of all our working and informal meetings was one of the developers of spaceships, the head of the design department of OKB-1 Evgeny Fedorovich Ryazanov. A prominent specialist in his field, an erudite, broad-minded person, he knew and understood the specifics of the work of subcontractors, always supported new ideas and proposals, he himself was their generator and never tried to avoid solving difficult problems. In co-authorship with G. A. Skuridin in 1959 and 1961, E. F. Ryazanov wrote two monographs: \"Soviet satellites and space rockets\" and \"Soviet satellites and space ships\" (the works were published under pseudonyms: S. G. Alexandrov and\n\nR. E. Fedorov), was the author of several articles for the encyclopedic dictionary. E.F. Ryazanov stood at the origins of practical astronautics, in orbital stations flying today and spaceships there is a large share of his work and talent.\n\nLike other associates of Sergei Pavlovich, Bushuev, Tsybin, Ryazanov were bright independent personalities. The ability to choose such assistants characterizes the Queen as an outstanding administrator.\n\nThe last time I saw Sergei Pavlovich was on December 23, 1965, when the 60th birthday of Pavel Vladimirovich Tsybin was celebrated in OKB-1. Almost\n\nall leaders of industrial and military teams who worked in the field of astronautics and aviation. Almost every one of them was a bright, memorable personality. Orators succeeded each other, competing in eloquence and wit. Jokes, puns, exotic souvenirs for the memory of the hero of the day. Full of strength and energy, cheerful and uninhibited, Sergei Pavlovich Korolev conducted all this festive action. He would have turned sixty next year. We thought about how this anniversary would be celebrated... But less than a month later, on January 14, 1966, Sergei Pavlovich passed away. Korolev went to the hospital to clarify the diagnosis, it seemed that nothing foreshadowed a tragic outcome, but he was not destined to get up from the operating table. S.P. Korolev passed away, but left his mark on the Earth. An outstanding scientist and designer, he was a pioneer in space exploration. It is unfortunate that today's youth, for the most part, no longer knows about this.\n\nThe nationwide rejoicing of April 12, 1961 is compared in scale with Victory Day on May 9, 1945. Such a comparison with external similarity seems to me unjustified. Victory Day was an inevitable, long-awaited, history-programmed holiday \"with tears in our eyes\" for the whole people. The official announcement of the final victory - the signing of the act of unconditional surrender of Germany - served as a signal for an open expression of delight and grief. The mass celebration was historically natural.\n\nThe preparation of a manned flight into space was classified, like all of our space programs. The message about the flight into space of an unknown major Gagarin for the inhabitants of the Earth was a complete surprise and caused rejoicing all over the world.\n\nMuscovites took to the streets, filled Red Square, smiled, carried home-made posters: “Everyone into space!”\n\nThe whole country celebrated! The flight of the first man into space, the success of Soviet science and technology were the stimulus for the moral unification of all sections of society. The \"Khrushchev thaw\" was already on the wane, and the ideological pressure of the \"cold war\" was making itself felt. Gagarin's flight again inspired hopes for a brighter future. It was still difficult to realize what exactly a manned flight into space gives to the Fatherland and mankind, but every citizen of the Soviet Union felt himself personally involved in a great accomplishment: not an American or a European, but ours, from Smolensk, through the efforts of our scientists and the efforts of the whole people, accomplished this feat.\n\nI was not in Moscow either on May 9, 1945, or during Gagarin's triumphal meeting. In April 1961, after the launch of Gagarin, S.P. Korolev left me and my first deputy Mishin on the site to prepare the next new R9 combat missile. \" cold war\"gained momentum. Details about the demonstrations in Moscow, the reception in the Kremlin and the enthusiastic responses of the world, we learned from Levitan's reports.\n\n- What were the future prospects for space exploration in the 60s and 70s? How different is the current state from the forecasts of that time?\n\n- It is possible to predict the development of science and technology with great certainty only for the next 10-15 years. Any prediction is to a certain extent biased and biased. Many famous scientists made mistakes in forecasting the future of science and technology. For example, Lord Kelvin, 15 years before the Wright brothers' flight, declared that \"the creation of aircraft heavier than air is impossible\" and suggested that \"it will soon be proved that x-rays are fiction.\" Ernest Rutherford, the first scientist to split the atomic nucleus, 15 years before the explosion of the first atomic bomb said: “The energy that comes from nuclear fission is so negligible that anyone who expects to receive an additional source of energy from nuclear reaction indulging in empty dreams. Almost the same position was held by the great Albert Einstein.\n\nIn 1965, after the triumphant flights of Vostok and Voskhod, Sergei Pavlovich Korolev remained the great sober chief designer. But until the end of his life, feelings of romantic passion did not leave him.\n\nNot jokingly, but seriously, he said that in ten or twenty years, workers would fly into space on trade union vouchers for outstanding services.\n\nAlso in 1965, prominent rocket designer Wernher von Braun stated in an interview that in the near future a ticket to travel to the moon would cost $5,000. None of the scientists argued with Tsiolkovsky's prediction, which he made at the beginning of the 20th century, that humanity will not remain forever in its cradle, on Earth, but will spread throughout the solar system. There are many interesting forecasts and proposals that have not lost their relevance even now, but are still very far from being implemented.\n\nWhen developing the Space Shuttle system, scientists and economists believed that the use of aviation experience would solve the problem of spacecraft reusability and reduce the cost of space flights. It should be noted that during the destructive and criminal reforms of the 90s, our Russian statesmen spared no expense to pay for consultations of \"omnipotent\" and \"all-understanding\" American economists, but in reality illiterate grabbers. But in Moscow there was a great market euphoria. So, these \"experienced\" American economists, given the task of proving the benefits of reusability space systems, calculated that the launch of 1 kg of payload into space on the Space Shuttle would cost $ 5,000 at first, then $ 1,000, and with more than 100 flights a year - $ 100. In fact, the Americans stopped operating shuttles this year. The real cost is from 15 to 20 thousand dollars per 1 kg of payload delivered by shuttles to the ISS. A ticket for a flight not to the Moon, but to an international orbital station with the help of the Russian Soyuz transport spacecraft costs not the $5,000 promised by von Braun, but $30 million.\n\nFor astronautics at the beginning of the 21st century, the cost of launching 1 kg of payload (according to unmanned programs) is 20-25 thousand dollars, to geostationary orbit, respectively, 30-50 thousand dollars. I cannot predict a significant reduction in the cost of launching payloads into space in the next 50 years. What we call \" common sense”, allows us to assert that the settlement of mankind in the solar system proposed by Tsiolkovsky in the 21st century will begin only in the form of a lunar base.\n\n- And what pace should and will develop the development of the moon by mankind?\n\n- The call for the creation of a lunar base was declared by the United States back in 1986. Almost 25 years have passed since then, and the construction of the lunar base has not yet begun. It was announced that the ships for the base will be created before 2020. According to my personal assessment, if the United States builds bases alone, and they are capable of doing this, then a real start is possible in 2015. It will take 8-10 years to create a permanent lunar base with a staff of 8-12 people. At best, such a base will start operating in 2025.\n\nRussia designed the construction of the base in the last century. Such construction will not require any new scientific discoveries: modern technology colonization of the moon is quite capable. But there are socio-political, economic and international problems that any state that wants to have its own base on the Moon will face.\n\nIn this regard, it can be predicted that Russia on its own in the next 20 years will not be able to create its own base.\n\nThe construction of a lunar base is possible if it is a national long-term program that is larger in scale than the transformation of the Sochi region into a base for winter Olympic Games and the resort is not worse Cote d'Azur. Probably, China will create its base five years earlier than Russia. The fourth colonizer of the Moon will be India. It is possible (but unlikely) to unite the technical and economic means of Russia with the participation of Europe for the construction of an international lunar base. An example of such an association is now the ISS. But lunar bases, unlike the ISS, can have a triple purpose: scientific, industrial-technological and military-strategic. It is possible to create a single lunar base for the Earth only by overcoming the division of the world into military-political groups.\n\n- For the inhabitants, the process of space exploration is primarily associated with the flight of man to Mars. Do you think there is any sense in preparing an expedition of people to Mars?\n\n— My firm conviction is that manned flights to Mars in the 21st century are technically possible, but not necessary. An ambitious goal will not justify the huge cost and risk. Why lay out at least 300-500 billion dollars, paying for the labor of hundreds of thousands of workers, engineers, scientists, if all the questions of interest to earthlings are able to be answered by Martian robots controlled by scientists from Earth? Mars rovers have convincingly proved that there is no life on the surface of Mars. By the end of the 21st century, another 8-10 rovers will land on Mars. They slowly explore the atmosphere, climate dynamics and soil of the planet.\n\nHowever, there are fantastic projects proving that it is necessary to send people on an expedition to Mars, and not 6-12 people, but thousands of men and women.\n\nThus, quite competent Chinese scientists offer to save Chinese civilization (and civilization on Earth will inevitably or quickly degrade or even die, like dinosaurs, as a result of climate change, war or meteorite impact). Before the possible death of all mankind, China will have time to create settlements on Mars with at least 1,000 people. They will bring with them the technology and tools needed to return to Earth in the future. The planet Mars is not suitable for long-term human life. But there is nothing more suitable within the solar system. We have to wait on Mars. After the restoration of acceptable conditions for life on Earth, the “Martian Chinese” will begin to return to Earth. Humanity will begin to multiply, but the whole new planet and new civilization will be Chinese.\n\nAmerican, Russian and all other projects of Martian expeditions, in comparison with this Chinese project, seem like small amateur air tremors.\n\nBut the settlement of the Chinese reservation on Mars will begin, I think, not earlier than the end of the 25th century.\n\n- How will it develop? space program in individual countries? How long will the US lead the \"space race\"? Will China take the lead? What are Russia's prospects for space exploration in the coming years?\n\n- The United States, with all its internal problems, will remain the most powerful military power in the world and the most advanced in the field of science and technology until the 30s of the 21st century. NATO is a reliable tool that allows the US to use not only its own, but also the European scientific and technical potential. The space strategy for the next 20-30 years will be priorities for programs of the widest spectrum. The transport systems of Russia and Europe will support the work of the ISS. By itself, the ISS for the United States is no longer of particular interest. In 10-15 years, having broken the record of the Mir station, the ISS will be flooded. Russia, Europe and Japan are not yet able to ensure the operation of the ISS without the support of the United States.\n\nFor Russia, the future programs of new technologies in the rocket and space industry are not only scientific and economic problems.\n\nAs a result of liberal market reforms, the Russian defense industry has lost many thousands of skilled workers and engineers. But we have enriched the US and Europe with professional personnel. The regime of \"dictatorship\" of the proletariat in Russia is no longer possible: there is simply no one to carry out this dictatorship. The “golden hands” of highly skilled workers and the bright brains of enthusiastic engineers will be a problem for Russia that does not exist in the United States.\n\nInstead of the famous Hubble orbiting telescope, which will last another five years without prophylaxis with the help of shuttles, a new observatory, James Webb, will be launched into orbit. New automatic devices will continue research and enrich science with a wide range of new discoveries on the planets of the solar system and, above all, on the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn. NASA's powerful scientific apparatus is developing not only technology, but also a strategy for the future of astronautics. Alas, in Russia at the state level there is no apparatus similar in terms of intellectual potential. The American agency NASA is vested with great powers. All federal space spending, other than purely military spending, is administered through or under the control of NASA. NASA's annual budget in 2009 exceeded Russia's space budget by almost 10 times. Under such initial conditions, there is no doubt that in the next 10-15 years a new super-heavy and manned spacecraft will be created in the United States, although President Obama has curtailed the lunar program.\n\nAs for China, in the next 20-25 years this country will invest huge amounts of money under the slogan \"to catch up and overtake America and Russia in the field of space exploration.\"\n\nCommunist China is building a socialist society with \"Chinese characteristics\". The Chinese Communists succeeded in short term to turn a backward agrarian country with a starving, semi-literate population of almost one and a half billion people into a state that has mastered all kinds of modern technology and mass production of competitive goods, from sneakers to the most advanced computers. The main strategic task of China is to create a society based on the \"knowledge economy\". Economic and technological tasks in the past 15 years have been solved by China on a scale and within a time frame that other states cannot reach - China will be the second power capable of realizing \"dominance in space.\" One of the decisive factors that guarantee China's phenomenal success is ideological and political unity and not rhetorical, but genuine enthusiasm for mastering knowledge and high technology.\n\nGo to any Russian salon-shop of modern electronics. The widest range for every taste and every pocket. But you will not find a single, even the simplest, electronic device “Made in Russia”: 90 percent are “made in China”. The Chinese strategy for creating advanced technologies is a reliable springboard for the implementation of the principle of \"domination in space\" in the future. Russia does not yet have a development strategy that unites society.\n\nFor 15 years of criminal reforms under the slogan of the omnipotence of the free market in Russia, the defense industry, mechanical engineering, Agriculture disorganized army.\n\nAll basic life support is based on the sale of natural resources, primarily oil, gas, and timber. A new “elite” arose on the basis of super-profits from raw materials - a class of super-rich people and a terry corrupt bureaucracy. Why does this elite care about the development of domestic cosmonautics?\n\nIn order for the Russian cosmonautics to enter the top five in the future, tough socio-political reforms are needed. And not just for space exploration.\n\nInterviewed by Nikolay Podorvanyuk\n\n\"said Alla Medvedeva, scientific secretary of the academic readings on cosmonautics. The patriarch of Russian cosmonautics did not live until his 100th birthday only two and a half months.\n\nAccording to Medvedeva, Boris Chertok died on Friday at 07:40 am. Colleagues of the academician will inform about the place and time of the farewell ceremony later.\n\nFor many years, Boris Chertok was the head of the preparation and conduct of academic lectures on astronautics. They are known to many as the \"Royal Readings\". Before last days the outstanding designer remained an employee of RSC Energia and gave lectures to students.\n\nAlexei Leonov, twice Hero of the USSR, the first person to have been in outer space, commenting on the sad news, said: “The last person who connected us with the era of S.P. Korolev has passed away. With the departure of Boris Evseevich, unfortunately, the era great domestic space achievements. It is a great sadness. It is a pity for a person. Kind, smart, powerful - because the weak do not live up to a hundred years. I suggested making a film about Boris Evseevich while he is alive. Unfortunately, they did not have time. With his departure, the truthful Witness the rise of a great space state.\"\n\n\"Together with Korolev, Chertok sorted through German archives, recreating bit by bit the V-2 rocket in the USSR. This rocket formed the basis of domestic ballistic missiles and the legendary Seven, which is the prototype of the current Soyuz. He participated in the creation of the first artificial satellite Earth, Salyutov, Voskhodov, Vostokov, all automatic lunar stations, Buran reusable spacecraft, Leonov recalled.\n\nChertok about his dream and the secret code for Gagarin\n\nThe name of Boris Evseevich is associated with the main achievements of the Soviet Union in space exploration. He always willingly shared memories of the events of the past. So, in an interview with \"Rossiyskaya Gazeta\" given 7 years ago, Chertok admitted that flying into space was his dream, revealed the reasons for the loss in the \"moon race\" of the Soviet Union to the Americans, spoke about the secret code for Gagarin.\n\nThe academician also spoke about the first meeting with Korolev, which took place in Germany in 1945. Chertok at that time was the head of the Rabe Institute. The main goal of the institute was the restoration of German rocket technology. “Once they called from Berlin: “Lieutenant Colonel Korolev will come to you.” I remember, when I saw his very shabby Opel-Cadet, I immediately thought: “It’s a small bird ...”, Chertok said, smiling. At the same time, he noted that Korolev Chertok, describing the character of Korolyov, noted that in strong terms he was never shy, but at the same time very quickly retreated.\n\nChertok also expressed the opinion in an interview that the Soviet Union could not send its cosmonauts to the moon first, because it refused to ground test the first stage of the N-1 launch vehicle. \"To conduct the tests, it was necessary to build a very expensive and huge firing stand. It was decided not to build it. Therefore, constructive, design, technological miscalculations appeared at the launches. If ground tests had been carried out, they would have appeared even then,\" the academician explained.\n\nThe point in the \"Lunar program\", according to him, was put by three people: Mstislav Keldysh - President of the Academy of Sciences, Sergei Afanasyev - Minister of General Engineering and Dmitry Ustinov - Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee for Defense Affairs. They decided that after four unsuccessful launches, there was no point in continuing the \"moon race\". By that time, Korolev had already died, and Vasily Mishin took the place of the chief designer. Although the developers proposed the construction of a base on the Moon, the Trinity did not agree with them. Therefore, the project was not implemented.\n\nThe interview also talked about the flight of Yuri Gagarin. “Of course, we risked a lot by launching Gagarin. True, it should be noted that the Americans, following us, showed great courage: the reliability of launching a man into space on the Mercury was worse,” the academician said.\n\nBoris Chertok on the reasons for assigning Gagarin secret code 125 said the following: “According to psychologists, a person who found himself face to face with the Universe could “go crazy.” Therefore, someone suggested introducing a coded digital lock for the first flight. Only by typing “125” could the power be turned on manual control systems.\n\nAccording to Boris Evseevich, this code was sealed in an envelope. “It was assumed that if Gagarin could get the envelope and, after reading it, dial the code, then he was of his mind and could take over manual control. code to Gagarin,\" he said.\n\nJournalists at the end of the interview asked Boris Evseevich if he ever wanted to go into space himself. He honestly replied that he wanted to, but ironically added that at his age \"it would be a completely justified risk.\"\n\nIn another interview that Boris Chertok gave to the Russian Space magazine (which was published this spring on the Roskomos website), he regretted that so far earthlings have not found comrades in the Universe in the Universe.\n\n“I am 99 years old and I am satisfied that I was involved in events of historical significance. However, it is sad to realize that we are alone in the foreseeable space. The Hubble telescope discovered a large number of exoplanets, but nowhere necessary conditions for the origin of life. Today, the only hope for Jupiter's moon is Europa. There, under the ice shell, there are supposedly oceans of water. Perhaps they can find traces of life there. However, for the time being, the mind is peculiar only to the inhabitant of the planet Earth - to man,\" the academician said.\n\nBoris Evseevich Chertok. Biography\n\nBoris Evseevich was born in Lodz (Poland) on March 1, 1912. He graduated from the Moscow Power Engineering Institute in 1940. In the period from 1940 to 1945 he worked in the Design Bureau of Chief Designer Viktor Bolkhovitinov.\n\nChertok as part of a special The commission was sent to Germany in April 1945. Until January 1947, Chertok was the head of a group of Soviet specialists who studied FAU missiles. Boris Chertok and Alexey Isaev in the same year organized in Thuringia (in the Soviet occupation zone) a joint Soviet-German institute \"Rabe\". The main focus of the work was the study and development of control technology for long-range ballistic missiles. On the basis of the institute, a new institute was created - \"Nordhausen\". Sergei Korolev was appointed chief engineer of this institute.\n\nBoris Chertok from that time worked closely with Korolev. In 1946, Boris Evseevich was transferred to the post of deputy. chief engineer and head of the department of control systems NII-88 (Scientific Research Institute N88) of the Ministry of Armaments. Chertok in 1950 was appointed deputy head, and in 1951 head of the control systems department of OKB-1 NII-88 (Special Design Bureau N1, today RSC Energia). Korolev was the chief designer.\n\nIn 1974 Chertok was appointed deputy. General Designer for Control Systems NPO Energia. Since 1946, his scientific and engineering activities have been associated with the development and creation of control systems for spacecraft and rockets.\n\nChertok was the leader in the creation of the school, which to this day determines scientific directions, as well as the level of domestic technology for manned space flights.\n\nIn 1961, B. Chertok received the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, was elected Corresponding Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences in the Department of Mechanics and Control Processes in 1968, a full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences - in 2000, a full member of the International Academy of Astronautics - in 1990.\n\nChertok's work has received numerous awards. He received two orders of Lenin (1956, 1961), in 1971 - the Order of the October Revolution, in 1975 - the Red Banner of Labor, in 1945 - the Red Star, in 1996 - \"For Merit to the Fatherland\" IV degree, in 1992 - the Boris Gold Medal Petrov RAS, in 2008 - the Sergey Korolev Gold Medal of the RAS.\n\nIn addition, Boris Evseevich was a laureate of the Lenin Prize (1957) for participation in the creation of the first artificial satellites of the Earth, and a laureate of the State Prize of the USSR (1976) for participation in the implementation of the Soyuz-Apollo project.\n\nAt the end of 2011, Academician Chertok was awarded the International Prize of St. Andrew the First-Called \"For Faith and Loyalty\" for his outstanding contribution to the development and development of rocket and space science and industry in Russia."
