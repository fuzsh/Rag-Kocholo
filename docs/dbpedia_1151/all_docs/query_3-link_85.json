        "text": "Polikarpov Viktor Yanukovych,\n\na member of the artists Union of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\nVictor F. Polikarpov was born on 15 November 1938 in the city of Pavlodar (Kazakhstan) where he lives and works currently.\n\nChildhood and youth were spent in the old part of the city – Zaton, in the heart of old Pavlodar, with its narrow streets, sandy banks of the Irtysh river, fresh river wind; here at different times lived Pavel Vasiliev, Anastasia Tsvetaeva, Viktor Baturin, Dmitry Bagayev. In Pavlodar Viktor Polikarpov was educated in music school. P. I. Tchaikovsky, viola and taught at the music school, but it irresistibly attracted to fine art, and he entered the Alma-ATA art school. N. Gogol (1967 - 1971)\n\nChart.

Most of the works now adorn the interiors of public buildings of Pavlodar.\n\nBut the main direction – easel graphics. His graphic work is characterized by philosophical depth and skill, finesse and complexity of composite solutions.\n\n...Court in Zaton, work-worn hands and weathered faces of the rivermen, bizarre rocks and pine Bayan-Aul, the flood on the Irtysh river, the dream river pools and endless expanses of steppe – all this warmed by a special vision of the artist, his wise and thoughtful attitude to life...\n\nIn the 80-ies Viktor Polikarpov I discovered the amazing world of the poetry of Pavel Vasilyev, who gave him a huge impetus to creativity.\n\nDrawings and graphics from the series \"poetry of Pavel Vasilyev\" are of particular spiritual tonality. It's not just illustrations, but the penetration into the world of the poet, where the fusion of vast Space, vast steppes in harmony with the riot of feelings and vivid passions. Poet and artist have in common the traditions of a people, sung by them in creative works. The artist is immersed in thinking about time, history, the great events of the past. Any of the artist's works can be considered practically infinite, it is jewelry and prescribes the smallest details, from the patterned stirrup to the veins in the leaf of a plant.\n\nThere are a series of graphic works \"To the legacy of Abu Nasr Muhammad al-Farabi\", \"time Travel,\" \"the poetry of Jacques prévert\" and others.\n\nAs said by the famous Pavlodar journalist Yuri mentions: \"the Polikarpov is a toughie...on the one hand, he is an artist he is one of us, Pavlodar – flood on the Irtysh river, fishing boat, Zatonsky work with pood fists!.. And with another – absolutely unpredictable, paradoxical: his amazing \"poulovassilis\" series of graphic sheets, and some other works, the life involved is so cool, twisted in such a tight spiral that is difficult to separate, what's the reality of that fantasy; where the dream where reality…»\n\nThe high rating of the creativity of the artist Victor Polikarpov gave people's artist of Kazakhstan Nikolay Gayev, saying that \"a pencil, he would like the main violin, and what he achieves great heights.\"\n\nArtistic talent is multifaceted. In the summer of 2002, working in the open air to the amazing beauty of the mountains of Bayan–Aul, Victor Polikarpov creates paintings that allow the viewer to see the wizard in a new aspect – gentle, lyrical painter. In his paintings – the colours of summer, the brightness of a winter day, partial shade and secluded corners of nature, when something shook the attentive look of the artist. It makes you look at every blade of grass, a flower, in every highlight on snow or on water\n\n^\n\nIn 1998 and 2008 released albums of graphic works of the artist.\n\nPrinted in Kazakhstan the magazines \"Niva\", \"Space\", Russian magazine \"Youth\", devoted to Kazakhstan in the 11th and 12th editions for the year 2000.
