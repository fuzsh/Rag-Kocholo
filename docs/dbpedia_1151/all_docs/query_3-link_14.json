        "text": "\"If you pass by the exhibition - stop to discover one of the greatest Slavic artists\" - could be read on a billboard during the exhibition of Grigorov in France. The artist's works have been successful in Sweden, the Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, Scotland, Germany, and other countries. In France, Victor Grigorov was nicknamed \"Ukrainian Modigliani\", and his paintings were often compared to the works of early Picasso.\n\nHowever, according to Nina Veligotskaya, Candidate of Art History, Honored Artist of Ukraine, Grigorov always presented his country.\n\nGrigorov's images are reduced to eternal (space, beauty, harmony, the mystery of woman and nature) and painful themes of the 20th century. (Horror, despair, anxiety)."
