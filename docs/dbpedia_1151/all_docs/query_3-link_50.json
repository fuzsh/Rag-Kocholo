He created a system of learning using reference signals, embodying it in his own practice and describing it in numerous textbooks that systematize the program material in verbal and graphic forms. He systematically conducted methodological seminars on the problems of teaching and educating students, as well as the development of pedagogical skills of teachers.\n\nHonored Teacher of Ukraine, awarded numerous professional awards.\n\nWe express our deep sincere condolences to the family and friends, colleagues and students of Viktor Fedorovich.\n\nEternal memory to Man, Citizen, Teacher."
