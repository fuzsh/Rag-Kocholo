The National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine is deeply saddened by the death of the Honorary Doctor of the National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine Viktor Fedorovich SHATALOV.

Ukrainian teacher-innovator, researcher-practitioner and experimenter, Viktor Fedorovich was a specialist in the field of mathematics, physics and astronomy. He created a system of learning using reference signals, embodying it in his own practice and describing it in numerous textbooks that systematize the program material in verbal and graphic forms. He systematically conducted methodological seminars on the problems of teaching and educating students, as well as the development of pedagogical skills of teachers.

Honored Teacher of Ukraine, awarded numerous professional awards.

We express our deep sincere condolences to the family and friends, colleagues and students of Viktor Fedorovich.

Eternal memory to Man, Citizen, Teacher.
