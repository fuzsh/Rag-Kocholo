        "text": "Today it was announced that Syd Barrett the founder of Pink Floyd, died today. Just wanted to share this for all you pink Floyd fans:\n\nLONDON Jul 11, 2006 (AP)â€” Syd Barrett, the troubled genius who co-founded Pink Floyd but spent his last years in reclusive anonymity, has died, a spokeswoman for the band said Tuesday. He was 60.\n\nThe spokeswoman who declined to give her name until the band made an official announcement confirmed media reports that he had died. She said Barrett died several days ago. She did not disclose the cause of death.\n\nBarrett co-founded Pink Floyd in 1965 with Roger Waters and wrote many of the band's early songs. The group's jazz-infused rock made them darlings of the London psychedelic scene, and the 1967 album \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\" largely written by Barrett was a commercial and critical hit.\n\nBarrett's behavior grew increasingly erratic, and he left the group in 1968. He spent much of the rest of his life living quietly in his hometown of Cambridge, England.\n\nThe band spokeswoman said a small, private funeral would be held.\n\nCopyright 2006 The Associated Press.
