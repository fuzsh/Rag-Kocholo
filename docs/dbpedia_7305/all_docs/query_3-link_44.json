        "text": "I've been a Pink Floyd fan since I was in grade school in the 1970's. I can remember hearing my friend's teenage sister listening to bands like Pink Floyd and Yes and loving it. I can even remember some kid telling me his older brother, or cousin, or whoever, was going to beat me up for having Pink Floyd and Genesis albums mixed in with my Kiss records. I guess that is some form of blasphemy to a progressive rock fan. In any case, I never got beat up and I had quite the Pink Floyd collection by the time I was in high school, including lots of bootlegs like the infamous \"Dark Side of the Moo.\" My friends and I use to love going to the midnight movie and watching the worm infested \"Live at Pompee.\" Too much psychedelic fun! Well, if you've read any of this page before, you know that I sold most of my record collection when I became an overzealous Christian in 1989. (For more info on that experience read my history page) Replacing all those albums has been a task that I am still striving to achieve. (Sounds like I'm trying to run a marathon, huh?) So, here it is, the ever growing Pink Floyd collection.\n\nPink Floyd formed in 1965 in Cambridge, England. Pink Floyd enjoyed moderate success in the late 1960s as a psychedelic band led by Syd Barrett. After Barrett's erratic behavior caused his bandmates to add guitarist David Gilmour (who eventually replaced Barrett), the band went on to record several elaborate concept albums, achieving megastardom with 1973's \"Dark Side of the Moon\" and then again with 1979's \"The Wall\". The group is one of rock music's most successful acts, believed to have sold an estimated 73.5 million albums in the U.S., and estimates of 175 to 200 million albums worldwide.\n\nPink Floyd's infamous debut album was released on August 5th, 1967 and featured original guitarist/songwriter Syd Barrett. Barrett was a strange character as is apparent from his song writing here. At this point, Pink Floyd were an experimental, psychedelic rock band. This style of music just doesn't get much weirder than this. Songs about gnomes and scarecrows, peppered with odd sound effects, non-traditional instruments and an off-the-wall production. \"The Piper At the Gates of Dawn\" was the soundtrack to a generation that was tripping on acid. Still, despite the bizarre, drug induced songs, there are some real gems. Album opener, is a fun song and \"Interstellar Overdrive\" is a superb instrumental. Barrett was a unique and creative individual. He wrote all but one song on this album. Unfortunately psychedelic drugs got the best of him, and he abandoned the band for near obscurity. \"Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk\" is the lone composition by Roger Waters, who would soon take over as the band's leader, once Barrett was gone. Barrett's vacated slot was filled by now legendary guitarist David Gilmour. Sid Barrett passed away in 2006.\n\nMy 1994 remastered CD version comes complete with a 24-page full color booklet with all the lyrics and plenty of colorful photos in which to \"space-out\" to.\n\n\"Astronomy Domine\" has been covered by Voivod.\n\nPink Floyd - A Saucerful of Secrets (Capitol) 1968\n\n1. \"Let There Be More Light\" (5:38)\n\n2. \"Remember A Day\" (4:33)\n\n3. \"Set The Controls For the Heart of the Sun\" (5:28)\n\n4. \"Corporal Clegg\" (4:13)\n\n5. \"A Saucerful of Secrets\" (11:57)\n\n6. \"See-Saw\" (4:36)\n\n7. \"Jugband Blues\" (3:00)\n\nGotta love gazoo music. The sixties were such a cool time for music. Bands could be so weird, not even using an ounce of structure, throwing in strange instruments, experimenting with odd timings and unusual effects. Psychedelic!!! I like it. Almost hard to believe this is the same band that put out the hugely successful \"The Wall.\" \"Jughead Blues\" was written by Syd Barrett.\n\nPink Floyd - More (Reprise) 1969\n\n1. \"Cirrus Minor\" (5:18)\n\n2. \"The Nile Song\" (3:26)\n\n3. \"Crying Song\" (3:33)\n\n4. \"Up the Khyber\" (2:12)\n\n5. \"Green Is the Colour\" (2:58)\n\n6. \"Cymbaline\" (4:50)\n\n7. \"Party Sequence\" (1:07)\n\n8. \"Main Theme\" (5:28)\n\n9. \"Ibiza Bar\" (3:19)\n\n10. \"More Blues\" (2:12)\n\n11. \"Quicksilver\" (7:13)\n\n12. \"A Spanish Piece\" (1:05)\n\n13. \"Dramatic Theme\" (2:15)\n\nThis album was commissioned as a soundtrack for the French movie \"MORE\", which I have never seen. Actually I don't really care to. It's the music I care most about. \"The Nile Song\" is one of my absolute favorite Pink Floyd tracks. The whole disc, however, is a bit spotty but overall enjoyable, especially late at night when you are home alone and just relaxing in bed.\n\nVoivod recorded an awesome cover of \"The Nile Song\".\n\nPink Floyd - Ummagumma\" (Capitol) 1969\n\nDISC ONE (STUDIO)\n\n1.Richard Wright: \"Sysyphus Part I [instrumental] (1:08)\n\n2.Richard Wright: \"Sysyphus Part II\"[instrumental] (3:30)\n\n3.Richard Wright: \"Sysyphus Part III\"[instrumental] (1:49)\n\n4.Richard Wright: \"Sysyphus Part IV\"[instrumental] (6:59)\n\n5.Roger Waters: \"Grantchester Meadows\" (7:28)\n\n6.\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave\n\nand Grooving with a Pict\" (5:01)\n\n7.David Gilmour: \"The Narrow Way--Part 1\"[instrumental] (3:29)\n\n8.David Gilmour: \"The Narrow Way--Part 2\"[instrumental] (2:54)\n\n9.David Gilmour: \"The Narrow Way--Part 3\" (5:58)\n\n10.Nick Mason: \"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party Part\n\nI-Entrance\"[instrumental] (0:59)\n\n11.Nick Mason: \"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party Part\n\nII-Entertainment\" [instrumental] (7:06)\n\n12.Nick Mason: \"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party Part\n\nIII-Exit\"[instrumental] (0:40)\n\nDISC TWO (LIVE)\n\n1.\"Astronomy Domine\"-live (8:31)\n\n2.\"Careful with that Axe, Eugene\"-live (8:50)\n\n3.\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\"-live (9:26)\n\n4.\"A Saucerful of Secrets\"-live (12:49)\n\n\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict\" is one of the greatest song titles second only to \"Why is A Carrot More Orange than an Orange?\" by the Amboy Dukes. This disc is very psychadelic. The live disc is a nice added bonus. Syd Barrett's cool \"Astronomy Domine\" sounds great here. Voivod has covered this song. Both discs are nicely packaged in a green slip case and comes with a poster.\n\nPink Floyd - Atom Heart Mother (Capitol) 1970\n\n1. \"Atom Heart Mother\" [instrumental] (23:39)\n\n...a. Father's Shout\n\n...b. Breast Milky\n\n...c. Mother Fore\n\n...d. Funky Dung\n\n...e. Mind Your Throats Please\n\n...f. Remergence\n\n2. \"If\" (4:30)\n\n3. \"Summer '68\" (5:28)\n\n4. \"Fat Old Sun\" (5:23)\n\n5. \"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\" [instrumental](13:01)\n\n...a. Rise and Shine\n\n...b. Sunny Side Up\n\n...c. Morning Glory\n\n\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\" is a tale of a man and his morning ritual complete with Rice Krispie pops. Psychedelic to the max! (Did I just say that?) Pink Floyd started to get into the long, orchestrated numbers here, especially with the spacy title track. \"Fat Old Sun\" is a fun song with a memorable sing-along chorus. \"When the fat old sun in the sky. . . ,\"enough of that nonsense! Cool cover! Nothing like a big ol' cow on the cover!\n\nPink Floyd - Meddle (Capitol) 1971\n\n1.\"One of These Days\" [instrumental] (5:57)\n\n2.\"A Pillow of Winds\" (5:07)\n\n3.\"Fearless\" (6:05)\n\n4.\"San Tropez\" (3:40)\n\n5.\"Seamus\" (2:13)\n\n6.\"Echoes\" (23:31)\n\n\"One of the Days\" was one of the first Pink Floyd songs I ever got into. I've never forgotten the one vocal line in the song. \"One of these days IÃ­m going to cut you into little pieces\"Ã® Scary stuff, huh? My wife HATES this song. Actually I always thought it was funny. (Warped sense of humor again.) \"Seamus\" is hilarious as well.\n\nPink Floyd - Obscured by Clouds (Capitol) 1972\n\n1. \"Obscured by Clouds\" ()\n\n2. \"When YouÃ­re In\" (2:30)\n\n3. \"Burning Bridges\" (3:30)\n\n4. \"Gold It's in The...\" (3:07)\n\n5. \"Wots...Uh the Deal\" (5:08)\n\n6. \"Mudmen\" (4:20)\n\n7. \"Childhood's End\" (4:32)\n\n8. \"Free Four\" (4:15)\n\n9. \"Stay\" (4:05 )\n\n10. \"Absolutely Curtains\" (5:52)\n\n\"Obscured By Clouds\" was a soundtrack album Pink Floyd threw together quickly for a film by Barbet Schroeder. The music contained is so weird, I can only describe it as psychedelic space rock. What drugs were these guys on when they wrote this?\n\nPink Floyd followed the very successful commercial breakthrough of \"Dark Side of the Moon\" with \"Wish You Were Here,\" a concept album about and dedicated to their founding member Syd Barrett. This particular version is the newly remastered version with an expanded booklet. These remastered cds are far superior to the first cd pressings in both mastering and especially in the multi-page booklets. Musically, \"Wish You Were Here\" is one of the band's most stellar, and coincidentally, most melodic discs. What is also featured more prominently than ever before is the excellent guitar work of David Gilmore who pulls off some excellent solos.\n\nVains of Jenna covered \"Wish You Were Here\". Queensryche covered \"Welcome to the Machine.\"\n\nPink Floyd - Animals (Columbia) 1977\n\n1.\"Pigs on the Wing (part one)\" (1:24)\n\n2.\"Dogs\" (17:03)\n\n3.\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\" (11:30)\n\n4.\"Sheep\" (10:18)\n\n5.\"Pigs on the Wing (part two)\" (1:24)\n\nOne of the less popular Pink Floyd albums, at least it's less popular now than albums like \"The Wall\" and \"Dark Side of the Moon.\" I, on the other hand, LOVE this CD. (My kids would say, \"Why don't you marry it then.\") Of all the albums in my Floyd collection, this one gets played the most. I literally play this one almost every week. Great album to kick back to late at night before I go to bed. Cool cover as well. I always liked the floating pig in front of the factory. The building on the cover is the Battersea Power Station near London. Apparently it is still there and being restored.\n\nPink Floyd - The Wall (Columbia) 1979\n\nRoger Waters' \"The Wall\" is a narcissistic rock opera/concept album about a seriously neurotic rock star, cleverly named Pink, who blames everyone, particularly his mother, school teachers, and women for his neuroses. Despite being one of the greatest concept albums ever written, \"The Wall\" became such a huge success because of singles like \"Another Brick in the Wall Part II,\" \"Comfortably Numb,\" and \"Hey You.\" The Wall was also considered a miracle of production containing unheard of mixes of melodic elements blended together with bizarre sound effects. Also contained some fragments of backwards masking that states, \"Congratulations, you've found the secret message!\" The movie was trippy. The part where the gestapo police rip the girl out of the car has always disturbed me. Oh, and there is not a day that goes by that I am at work that the phrase \"I Wanna Go Home\" doesn't echo through my mind.\n\nDream Theatre covered \"In The Flesh\".\n\nPink Floyd - Works (Columbia) 1983\n\n1. \"One of These Days\" (6:01)\n\n2. \"Arnold Layne\" (2:53)\n\n3. \"Fearless\" (5:38)\n\n4. \"Brain Damage\" (3:44)\n\n5. \"Eclipse\" (2:06)\n\n6. \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\" (5:22)\n\n7. \"See Emily Play\" (2:46)\n\n8. \"Several Species of Small Furry Animals...\" (4:40)\n\n9. \"Free Four\" (4:09)\n\n10. \"Embryo\" (4:41)\n\nOne new track, \"Embryo,\" written by Roger Waters. I would not have spent a lot of money to buy this compilation, as I have all the tracks, but since I found this disc for a mere $5.99, I thought I'd pick it up.\n\nPink Floyd - A Momentary Lapse of Reason (Columbia) 1987\n\n1.\"Signs of Life\" [instrumental] (4:23)\n\n2.\"Learning to Fly\" (4:53)\n\n3.\"The Dogs of War\" (6:10)\n\n4.\"One Slip\" (5:04)\n\n5.\"On the Turning Away\" (5:38)\n\n6.\"Yet Another Movie/Round and Around\" (7:27)\n\n7.\"A New Machine part 1\" (1:45)\n\n8.\"Terminal Frost\"[instrumental] (6:16)\n\n9.\"A New Machine part 2\" (0:38)\n\n10.\"Sorrow\" (8:48)\n\nThe first Pink Floyd album without Roger Waters, who was beginning to make Pink Floyd his solo project anyhow. I love this album, despite the bad reviews it received. David Gilmour is a fine songwriter and has done a excellent job of taking Pink Floyd on without Roger. Far superior to \"The Final Cut\" in my opinion.\n\nAnother fine David Gilmour led Pink Floyd album that really doesn't stray far from 1987's \"Momentary Lapse of Reason.\" Keyboard player Rick Wright is back to full bandmember status and has co-writing credits on five of the 11 songs, even getting lead vocals on \"Wearing the Inside Out.\"Also still on board is drummer Nick Mason. Collectively the three original members, along with producer Bob Ezrin, have reatained their signature Pink Floyd sound, with slow tempos, sustained keyboard chords, guitar solos with lot of delay, and loads of emotion.\n\nPink Floyd - Pulse (Sony) 1995\n\n1. Shine On You Crazy Diamond (13:37)\n\n2. Astronomy Domine (4:19)\n\n3. What Do You Want From Me (4:09)\n\n4. Learning To Fly (5:16 )\n\n5. Keep Talking (6:53)\n\n6. Coming Back To Life (6:56)\n\n7. Hey You (4:38)\n\n8. A Great Day For Freedom (4:31)\n\n9. Sorrow (10:47)\n\n10. High Hopes (7:52)\n\n11. Another Brick In The Wall (Part Two) (7:06) 1. Speak To Me (2:30)\n\n2. Breathe In The Air (2:35)\n\n3. On The Ru\" (3:47)\n\n4. Time (6:48)\n\n5. The Great Gig In The Sky (5:50)\n\n6. Money (8:53)\n\n7. Us And Them (6:58)\n\n8. Any Colour You Like (3:20)\n\n9. Brain Damage (3:46)\n\n10. Eclipse (2:37)\n\n11. Wish You Were Here (6:35)\n\n12. Comfortably Numb (9:29)\n\n13. Run Like Hell (8:36)\n\n\"Pulse\" is a live album from Pink Floyd. The live recording features a vast array of songs from the band's large catalog, including songs as old as \"Astronomy Domine\" (1967). The crowd roars at the opening notes of this song. (Now why didn't they do \"Several Small Fury Animals Gathered Together in a Cave...?) There are a number of songs from \"Division Bell\" included, which is a marvelous work in and of itself. I personally think that the live version has a new life breathed into them. David Gilmore sounds fantastic, though I do think that Roger Waters is missed on some songs. As might be expected from these vets, everything from the production, to the performance, to the seemless track flow to the packaging is top notch. The booklet enclosed is gorgeous and includes tons of photos of the band. Basically, \"Pulse\" is a testimony of the longevity and creativity of the world's biggest progressive bands.\n\nPink Floyd - The Endless River (Columbia) 2014\n\n1. Things Left Unsaid (4:27)\n\n2. It's What We Do (6:18)\n\n3. Ebb and Flow (1:56)\n\n4. Sum (4:49)\n\n5. Skins (2:38)\n\n6. Unsung (1:08)\n\n7. Anisina (3:17)\n\n8. The Lost Art of Conversation (1:43)\n\n9. On Noodle Street (1:43)\n\n10. Night Light (1:43)\n\n11. Allons-y (1) (1:58)\n\n12. Autumn '68 (1:36)\n\n13. Allons-y (2) (1:33)\n\n14. Talkin' Hawkin' (3:30)\n\n15. Calling (3:38)\n\n16. Eyes to Pearls (1:52)\n\n17. Surfacing (2:47)\n\n18. Louder Than Words (6:37)\n\n\"The Endless River\" was somewhat deceivingly promoted as a \"new Pink Floyd\" album. Of course that really isn't the case. The album was created from previous ideas and recordings, though it likely is to be the only chance we ever have of hearing something \"new\" from Floyd again. The music is mostly reconstituted from \"The Division Bell\" (1994) sessions and as might be expected, the albums sounds fragmentary and definitely derivative of their own music. \"The Endless River is a collection of mostly short passages of instrumental music that blend beautifully into each other, some of it bearing an instantly recognizable 1970s Pink Floyd sound, while other passages definitely recall the 1990's sound. The overall album sounds more like a relaxing, ambient instrumental album than a progressive-rock Pink Floyd album. In fact, the first few times I tried listening to this album was while I was driving in my car and I quickly grew bored with it and put something else on. Obviously that wasn't the right time or headspace to be listening to this album. Instead I found it to be something that is wonderful to kick back and relax to and basically drift off into sleep. There is non of the anger or rage felt on albums like \"Animals\", \"The Wall\" or \"The Final Cut\". In fact, I don't think I ever once made it all the way to the end of the CD and didn't even realize there was a song with vocals on it until I read about it on-line. The last track \"Louder than Words\" is the only one with lyrics, and the only that resembles an actual Pink Floyd song.\n\nFloyd fans across the web were raving about this album when it came out. I can understand why since it's the only thing to come out from the band in decades. However, \"The Endless River\" is far from an essential album in my opinion. It is for Floyd fanatics who must own everything with the band's name on it. For the more ethereal Floyd listening I'll still go back to the late 60's an early 70's albums. For the more rock oriented material, 1973 to 1979 is where it's at.\n\nOn DVD:\n\nPink Floyd - Live At Pompeii-The Directors Cut\n\nPink Floyd - The Wall\n\nRelated collections:\n\nDavid Gilmour | Roger Waters | Syd Barrett"
