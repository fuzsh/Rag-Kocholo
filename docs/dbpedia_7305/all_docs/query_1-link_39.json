        "text": "David Gilmour has refused to rule out performing live with the latest incarnation of Pink Floyd.\n\nBack in March 2021, Gilmour categorically ruled out another Pink Floyd reunion saying the band had “run its course” and “I absolutely don’t want to go back.”\n\nHowever, last month Gilmour and Nick Mason reunited Pink Floyd alongside bass player Guy Pratt and Nitin Sawhney on keyboards, and they premiered the video for their first all-new song in 28 years, ‘Hey Hey Rise Up.’\n\nThe charity single features vocals by Andriy Khlyvnyuk of Ukrainian band Boombox and all proceeds from its release are being donated to Ukrainian humanitarian relief following the Russian invasion.\n\nIn a recent interview to promote ‘Hey Hey Rise Up’, 76-year-old Gilmour was asked whether he’s planning to take Pink Floyd on the road again.\n\nAlthough not exactly affirmative in his response, the good news is that he didn’t totally snub the idea.\n\n“We haven’t even thought about doing live shows, but I suppose it’s a possibility,” he says in response to the big question. “I haven’t done one in such a long time, but who knows – I don’t know.”\n\nBack in 2019, Nick Mason said he was \"ready\" for a Pink Floyd reunion, however he added \"I'm certainly not going to hold my breath\" due to the conflict between Gilmour and Roger Waters.\n\nPink Floyd’s last live performance was at Live 8 in 2005, however their last full concert was almost three decades ago at Earls Court in London in October 1994 on the final date of The Division Bell Tour.\n\nAlthough Nick Mason is on the road right now with Nick Mason’s Saucerful of Secrets, David Gilmour hasn’t played a full live show since his Royal Albert Hall residency in the autumn of 2016.\n\nThe cover stars of famous albums revealed, including Pink Floyd's 'Wish You Were Here':\n\nListen to Planet Rock on DAB nationwide, on our Rayo app, online or via your smart speaker (“Play Planet Rock”)."
