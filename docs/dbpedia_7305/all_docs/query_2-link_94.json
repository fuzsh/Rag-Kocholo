        "text": "Touring with Pink Floyd is not, as you might imagine, like a quick gig down the Bull and Gate. There's a tour budget of around £70 million, and the efforts of hundreds of people go into making each concert truly spectacular. In this exclusive, Mike Lethby talks backstage to some of the men who keep the Floyd on the road.\n\nDrinking, talking, eating, checking each other's tans, getting over‑excited, jumpy and elated, they've been queuing in the hot Californian sunshine since early this morning. Thirty minutes' drive from central Los Angeles, thousands upon thousands of cars are beginning to fill the Rose Bowl's giant parking lots six long hours before show time. The hamburger stands are already doing a brisk trade, and amiable security guards sweat beneath their peaked caps as they eye \"the kids\" gathering at the turnstiles.\n\n\"The kids\" — it's the guards' stock phrase for their clients, whether they're four or 40 in age — will rush those turnstiles in a human tsunami when doors open at 6.30, run pell‑mell down the long dark tunnels under the high concrete bleachers, spilling out onto this scorched American Football arena to claim their privileged places right down at the front, where only a sturdy barrier and ten feet of Astroturf paced by day‑glo‑vested bodybuilders will stand between them and the band many have travelled hours on LA's crowded freeways to see. Many of this bunch, like their compatriots in dozens of cities across the USA, have forked out up to 50 dollars a ticket; others, slower on the uptake but equally determined not to miss the show, will have paid maybe twice that sum to a tout.\n\nIn The Pink\n\nBut then, this is Pink Floyd, 1994. Few bands today can equal the drawing power of this trio of late fortysomethings and their younger hired hands, the quintessential force of the late '60s psychedelic 'underground' scene, who have successfully defied both their former colleague and chief songsmith, Roger Waters, and the doom‑filled prophets who dismissed their prospects as bleak‑verging‑on‑pointless after the band's acrimonious split with Waters in the mid‑'80s.\n\nMany would argue that they missed the point. Pink Floyd, even in their headiest days (Dark Side Of The Moon 1973, The Wall 1979), were never a personality‑based outfit. 'Self‑effacing' would be an understatement — interviews were rarer than singles releases, and it was only during and after the split that Waters publicly laid claim to the band's treasure chest of creativity. Today, eight years on, many of their casual fans (judging by the ones I talked to in LA) appear to believe the Gloomy One still spanks plank with the astral travellers from Grantchester Meadows.\n\nWhat followed Roger Water's departure is rock history: in 1988 a modest, tentative Floyd tour of American indoor arenas swiftly exploded, literally by public demand, into a three‑year, multi‑million‑pound‑grossing world‑wide spectacular — the 'Momentary Lapse Of Reason' tour (with the accompanying live album The Delicate Sound Of Thunder). It was massively successful, both musically and commercially. These geezers who looked and dressed like bank managers could not only still play their stuff with aplomb but could also do so with the enthusiasm of twenty‑year olds.\n\nBut even before the time of the split, Floyd, like few other bands in the world, already had a reputation for large‑scale, dramatic, mould‑breaking live shows that transcended considerations of their recorded works. Even those who never bought an album (apart, maybe, from Dark Side), would flock to witness the guaranteed spectacle, the brooding son et lumière that was a Floyd gig. This tradition of leading the way in terms of live performance goes back as far as 1968/69 — even then, they had quadrophonic sound, daring light shows, planes, beds, and pigs diving overhead. You name it, the chances are they did it first, and much of what they offered even then has since become standard fare for big‑budget rock tours. And therein lay a Catch‑22 for 1994's Pink Floyd: how do you outdo your own legend when you've already taken it almost to the max?\n\nAs a result, expectations were high last November, when Pink Floyd summoned Europe's press to an official launch of the 1994 World Tour, with Dave Gilmour (vocals, guitars), Nick Mason (drums, percussion) and Rick Wright (keyboards), the three remaining original members, in the spotlight. A measure of the intense interest in the jaunt was the presence of a giant satellite transmitter dish stationed outside — to beam the launch bash live to other journos around the world. (One of the first questions to Gilmour, trivia collectors should note, was to enquire how Syd Barrett was getting on. Dave's dead‑pan reply: \"He was fine last time I saw him — but that was in 1982.\")\n\nBack To The Future\n\nSo here we are, on a balmy evening in Pasadena, a few miles north of Hollywood, in a lush valley full of golf courses and tall palm trees. The Rose Bowl here is playing host to two nights of Floyd, a total of around 120,000 people. This is the biggest league of international touring: the giant sun‑baked sports stadia of the USA, accommodating up to 100,000 people (by comparison, Wembley Stadium seats 72,000). The scale of the logistics, in the best Spinal Tap fashion, is suitably awesome. Production Director Robbie Williams, a former co‑director of Britannia Row Productions (once the Floyd's own PA company, now an independent outfit and supplying the PA for this show) presides over an entourage of 150 — and that's not counting management, accountants, local crew and security. Sound crew, lighting crew, stage riggers, backline and instrument technicians, electricians (the production provides all of its own power from Templine's mobile generators), truck drivers, caterers, site co‑ordinators and the numerous others are virtually all based in Britain, like the companies that employ them. Many have worked with the band before — in some cases as far back as the early '70s. The record, as far as I can tell, is held by Peter Wynne Wilson, one of the Floyd's original lighting designers, brought back into the fold to help recreate that authentic 1969 feel for a certain vintage track, of which more later.\n\nThe two‑and‑a‑half hour set, which begins just as darkness has fallen, spans virtually the entire lifespan of Pink Floyd, up to 1994's album The Division Bell, which coasted effortlessly into the album charts at Number one in April. Much of the material played here (about a dozen numbers are drawn each night from a rehearsed 'pool' of 20‑odd songs) was familiar from the 'Momentary Lapse...' tour — 'Learning To Fly', 'One Of These Days', 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond' (awesome), the best of Dark Side Of The Moon, 'Comfortably Numb', 'Run Like Hell'. No 'Echoes', sadly, but you might be luckier when the show hits London in November.\n\nAlso present are Pink Floyd's visual signatures: the giant circular back‑projection screen, the computer‑controlled moving lights and weird and wonderful lighting 'pods' which rise mysteriously at various points during the show, and a stunning metamorphosis of the unfolding mirrorball during 'Momentary Lapse...' — but I won't spoil the surprise. There are lasers, serious lasers, in green and amber. Oh, and yes, there are pigs. Pigs which fly — or rather, which plummet spectacularly to earth. All good Floydian fun. Then there's the sound design, which again features a production concept which Pink Floyd have made their own down the years — quadrophonic sound (see the separate 'Quadrophonia' panel elsewhere in this article).\n\nFloyd Out Front\n\nA glance at the Floyd's exceptionally neat setup shows quite graphically how much live performance technology — especially sound reinforcement hardware — has advanced since this band filled its first Transit van. When Pink Floyd first took to the road, the typical touring sound system amounted to little more than the gear today's local bands might use to play a small bar or club. Standard issue were Vox AC30 and AC50 backline amplifiers and cabinets, which, augmented by WEM (Watkins Electric Music) 4x10 inch speaker columns, would also form the PA system. It was, indeed, with just such a system that the Beatles played their famous final concert at the giant Shea Stadium. You might also have enjoyed the benefits of a small mixing desk — although these were not so common on professional tours until the relatively high‑tech days of 1970/71, when Bill Kelsey marketed his first touring mixers. Bill once recounted the story of how, on a Floyd tour in the early '70s , he pioneered the active DI box; he worked out the circuit, studiously soldered the components onto a small square of circuit board, and taped the whole assembly into an Old Holborn tobacco tin. Today, as you might expect, tobacco tins are not widely in evidence on the Britannia Row Productions' equipment list.\n\nToday, the Pink Floyd PA consists of slender, custom‑built towers either side of the stage dome, on top of which sit curious 'bonnets' — actually pig‑pens, housing the famed inflatable hogs which, eyes blazing ominously, bob and weave high in the air. They also serve a practical purpose — under each porcine belly there is an implausibly small cluster of Turbosound's Flashlight PA cabinets.\n\nFloyd's touring system has been adapted slightly from its original specification for America, in the light of experience. The delay towers were eliminated in favour of a slightly expanded main Flashlight PA. Controlling and powering this, and the on‑stage monitoring system, is a large inventory of Turbosound's dedicated Flashlight system controller racks. There are two Yamaha PM4000 mixing consoles for the main front‑of‑house mix, a PM3000 which serves for quad effects mixing, and a specially‑built Midas XL‑3 desk, which contains a unique quadrophonic panning centre, complete with dual joysticks.\n\nAndy Jackson: In The Hot Seat\n\nFront‑of‑house engineer Andy Jackson has worked with Pink Floyd in the studio since 1981; he's one of a handful of engineers to have made a successful transition to live mixing work. Although he wasn't on the last Floyd tour, he did go out with Roger Waters on the 'Pros & Cons of Hitchhiking' tour in the early '80s. As he says, this involved \"smaller venues but a similar kind of thing. That was my first time mixing live sound — the very first show I did was in front of 16,000 people!\n\n\"In some ways, it's actually easier than mixing in clubs, which I've done at various times — just bits and pieces for friends. This is easier, there's more control — if you take an instrument or a vocal out of the PA mix, it's gone, whereas in small clubs you've got the direct sound from the backline and monitors to contend with.\n\n\"Working live is a nice change: the whole dynamics are very different. I've got two and a half hours of very intense work and then it's over. And only one take! But then again, the audience doesn't really notice everything, so if there happens to be the occasional scrappy edge in it, it's gone in an instant — it's a different philosophy. I enjoy it — it's a pleasant change. Once every few years, it's quite fun.\"\n\nThe famed inflatable hogs also serve a practical purpose under each porcine belly there is an implausibly small cluster of Turbosound's Flashlight PA cabinets.\n\nAsked whether the Floyd give him feedback about his live mixing, Andy explained: \"They get DATs of the show after each night, and if they want specific cues changed, they'll tell me. But having worked with them for 13 years now, they trust me to do what I do. It's a very easy and comfortable working relationship. Dave Gilmour loves playing; he's always in the studio, it's what he loves. If Pink Floyd aren't playing he'll do other projects, charity shows.\n\n\"With a tour like this it's not just fun, it's about organisation, doing things right. Yet we don't have a fixed set list — the first half of the show changes every day. The second half can't change, though, because parts of some of the songs are timed to film clips.\"\n\nContinuing on the subject of working relationships, Andy says: \"Fortunately, the whole front‑of‑house team [Andy Jackson, Colin Norfield and Dave Lohr] gets on really well, and there's no egos involved, otherwise it wouldn't have been feasible. Colin mixes the drums and bass channels; I've got all the rest of the band, and Dave Lohr handles all the quad — the mixes, the sends and the quad‑based effects. We're kept pretty busy even with three of us mixing the show: it works out well. It's good having Colin Norfield, because he's such an experienced front‑of‑house engineer in his own right, and there are certain areas that I don't know about, since I don't do that much live work. My strength is really knowing the band, their material, and the way they work. That's why I'm here — I'm their guy. Without Colin, I'd have to start learning stuff that I don't really know anything about very quickly — ringing out the PA if there's any problems, things like that. I could do it, of course, but you need a lot of experience to make it happen quickly. Colin's much more used to spotting problem areas — occasionally, he'll zoom across to me and say, 'something's ringing', and be able to go straight to the right channel on the desk or the system graphic equalisers. I don't necessarily notice it, because I'm not used to listening for things like feedback; it's not a problem I encounter in studio work.\"\n\nAndy finds the Flashlight system \"really good. I'm not the greatest expert, but compared to anything I've heard before it's just such an improvement — it's head and shoulders better. It basically sounds like a decent speaker system rather than lots of aluminium screaming at you. It has a natural sound, which makes life much easier — we're not having to EQ because of the PA, we're EQ'ing for the instruments. And if you look at the EQ racks there's just a bit of compensation for the stadium — otherwise, they're running virtually flat. It's a great system, and it's stunningly small as well. It's difficult to believe you can do a stadium with it. But then, this band suit stadiums more than most, because they play slowly, and they take to echo well — there's a lot of space in the music. Where Pink Floyd once used analogue effects like the Roland Space Echo and the Echoplex, these have been replaced by today's conventional digital reverb and multi‑effects units\".\n\nAndy admits that despite his studio background, he's not tempted to join the slow trend towards using desk automation on the road: \"There's an inherent time‑basis problem involved in that: what does it run off? I suppose these days people have so many click tracks and sequencers running that you can potentially do it, but this isn't like that. There are some clicks going on, but nothing's running off timecode. There are so many variables — even when you're playing in the same place for ten nights, the atmospheric temperature and humidity can change the sound on each night.\"\n\nFrom Studio To Stadium\n\nAndy went on to explain the specifics of transferring his studio experience with Pink Floyd to the world's largest sports stadiums, and with material that frequently involves large numbers of active instrument and microphone channels: \"In terms of effects devices, it's actually not so intense live as in the studio. That's simply because you get so much natural reverb for nothing that your basic need for reverb almost disappears. I am using some reverbs, but far fewer than in the studio.\n\n\"In some ways, live, I'm using a more controlled system than I'd have in the studio. There's a hell of a lot more gates here than I'd have there — I don't use gates in the studio unless I need to, to sort specific things out. Whereas on stage here, every single drum is gated as a matter of course, to make sure that the signals coming up on my microphone channels are as clean and controlled as they'd be in a studio, perhaps even more so. In recording studios in the 1970s — the era that I grew up in — bands played together in the same room, it was all acoustic stuff with microphones. So with Floyd, the studio process has always had slightly more similarity to working live than with people who've grown up later, who are used to a more controlled overdub environment.\n\n\"Approaches to EQ tend to be somewhat different. Live, you start off by getting rid of all the problem frequencies and work with what you're left with. I tend to be rather more additive in the studio; I try to discipline myself to be subtractive, but inevitably end up using additive EQ a lot. In fact, here, a lot of the complication is taken out because the keyboards are sub‑mixed on stage. I get a stereo feed from the stage for those keyboards, and this appears at my desk on one stereo fader, which makes life much easier.\"\n\nAndy confessed there is a trade‑off trying to keep a sense of dynamic range within the overall mix, especially as he was having to run the show in LA at quite a high level: \"As far as the dynamics are concerned, we're 'winging it' on each show — how much headroom we have to play with depends on how noisy the audience are, and on the type of arena we're playing in — they differ quite a lot in size and shape. In this country particularly, you're competing with maybe 60,000 screaming people, so you're working with a relatively narrow dynamic range, certainly a lot less than on an album. And, inevitably, the whole approach is quite theatrical, in as much as when a song starts with just one instrument, I'll bring it in very loud so that it's in your face, rather than on an album where you can let it have its natural dynamics. But Colin [Norfield] and I share the same philosophy, which is that the simpler we can make it, the better we can make it, because we've then got a better chance of getting a decent balance — which is the single most important thing.\"\n\nNo Sync Required\n\nThe second half, as we've come to expect from Floyd's live shows, features various film segments back‑projected onto the trademark circular screen. The visuals are all of that curious, surrealist school which first emerged in the films accompanying the 'Dark Side Of The Moon' tour in 1973. Andy surprises me by pointing out that very few of these sequences are synchronised with the music — the expected SMPTE timecode track running on one of the two 16‑track tape machines on the mix riser is conspicuous by its absence: \"Only the film at the beginning of 'Money' is timecoded, because it's got synchronised sound; the film for all the other songs are just started by visual cues. Some do, admittedly, involve musicians playing to click tracks so that they time fairly accurately, but it's not absolutely critical because the film doesn't use lip‑sync. In some ways we still like to use some low‑tech solutions, which can be wonderful, because they're fool‑proof! And there are moments in these shows — there always have been — which keep it on the edge, keep it fresh.\"\n\nOne of these moments is surely the show's unexpected opener — the vintage Floyd track mentioned earlier, 'Astronomy Domine', from their very first album, Piper At The Gates Of Dawn. Andy comments: \"A lot of people in the USA seem to think Meddle was Pink Floyd's first album, so I can only assume they think it's something off the new album. Actually, when I heard we'd be doing that song, I went back and listened to the first album, and actually it sounds astonishingly good; for the time it was done it's incredibly well recorded. The version they're playing here is an updated one, using '90s technology, but essentially it's still just the four‑piece band. In fact, that was part of the challenge of doing it again live — to have the original band, as much as possible, just getting up and doing it, rather than using great session musicians as a backing band. To play a lot of the material they do need a total of 11 people on stage, but the numbers that they can do as a four‑piece, they do — and it's great!\"\n\nOutro\n\nFrom the moment you walk into the arena, there's a sense that something is going to happen tonight. And with some of rock's most experienced production brains at the controls, there's little chance that mere human error will be allowed to puncture the finely‑honed illusion.\n\nMuch of the tone for the show is set by the classic vintage opening track mentioned earlier. During pre‑tour rehearsals, Dave Gilmour hit on the idea of opening the show with a number last performed live around two decades ago. And what a coup. With the huge stage dome filled with a deep blue swirling oil‑slide projection, the band blast into a demented 'Astronomy Domine', the crashing minor chords descending darkly behind Gilmour's declamation of that archetypal early‑Floyd lyrical muse — 1969‑style outer space acid, dramatically revitalised and, yes, digitally remastered live and direct. 'Astronomy Domine', recorded live earlier this year, is now the B‑side of the Floyd's recent single release. Dust off that axe, Eugene..."
