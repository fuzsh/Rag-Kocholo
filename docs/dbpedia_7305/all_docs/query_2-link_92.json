        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nRoger Waters is 81. Waters is perhaps best known for his work within the iconic rock band, Pink Floyd. As a bassist, lyricist and overall creative force of the band, Waters played a significant role in shaping Pink Floyd’s sound and conceptual direction - especially after Syd Barrett’s departure - contributing heavily to albums like \"The Wall,\" \"The Dark Side of the Moon,\" and \"Wish You Were Here.” After leaving the band, Waters has gone on to have a successful solo career, while also keeping busy with political activism.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1968 - Eric Clapton stepped in to record the famous guitar solo on the Beatles' \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\"\n\n1969 - The \"hardest working man in show business,\" James Brown, pleaded exhaustion and declared his intention to retire from live performing. He was a little stressed at the time, battling a paternity suit filed by a one-time president of his fan club.\n\n1974 - George Harrison launches his Dark Horse record label.\n\n1975 - Glen Campbell started a two-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Rhinestone Cowboy,\" his first No. 1 after 13 Top 40 hits.\n\n1976 - For the first time in the history of Fleetwood Mac, they topped the album chart with their new self-titled album. It was the second self-titled release from the band (their first being the band's debut from 1968). This was the first Fleetwood Mac album to feature Lindsey Buckingham as guitarist and Stevie Nicks as vocalist; up until the release of this album, Fleetwood Mac's albums generally sold around 300,000 - 350,000 copies apiece. This album helped launch them as musical superstars with an almost constant radio presence. In 2003, the album was ranked No. 182 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n1978 - Record producer Tom Wilson died. He worked with various US acts including Bob Dylan (The Times They Are a-Changin', Another Side of Bob Dylan, and Bringing It All Back Home), Frank Zappa (Freak Out!), Simon and Garfunkel (Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.) and The Velvet Underground, (White Light/White Heat).\n\n1980 - Entering the album chart on this day were One Trick Pony by Paul Simon, Panorama by the Cars, Reach For The Sky by the Allman Brothers, and Playing For Keeps by Eddie Money.\n\n1989 - Motley Crue frontman Vince Neil punches Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin in the face during the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n1989 - After initially refusing to play it, MTV gives Neil Young's \"This Note's For You\" the Video of the Year award at the MTV Video Music Awards. The same night, Mötley Crüe frontman Vince Neil punches Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin in the face.\n\n1989 - Just as mainstream pop is about to welcome grunge music with its murky guitars and bleak outlook on society, newcomer Lenny Kravitz challenges the negativity with a simple, funk-styled message: Let Love Rule.\n\n1990 - Tom Fogerty (rhythm guitarist for Creedence Clearwater Revival) dies from an AIDS-related tuberculosis infection in Scottsdale, Arizona, at age 48.

The game marked Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken's 2,131st consecutive game, breaking the record held by Lou Gehrig. Jett, a huge Orioles fan and friend of Ripken, watched the rest of the game alongside a host of baseball legends, including Willie Mays and Joe DeMaggio.\n\n1997 - Elton John recorded a new version of 'Candle In The Wind' after performing the song live at Diana Princess of Wales funeral.
