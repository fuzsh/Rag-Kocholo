        "text": "Pink Floyd were the architects of two major music movements—psychedelic space-rock and blues-based progressive rock—and became known for their biting political, social and emotional commentary.\n\nWith 1973’s Dark Side Of The Moon and 1979’s The Wall, the band created two of the most ambitious (and best-selling) albums of all time—and underscored that personal torment could resonate on a massive level.\n\nJust how did a band named for two Georgia bluesman, Pink Anderson Floyd Council, journey from England’s idyllic Cambridge to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?\n\nFrom its beginnings as an improvising blues-band psychedelic band with pop hit singles to a period when journalists insisted on describing Pink Floyd, mistakenly as “electronic rockers”; from the ubiquitous Dark Side of the Moon to being the first rock band played in space; from tales of an underwear thief to the doom and gloom of The Wall, Pink Floyd have always been bigger, better and braver than the rest."
