        "text": "Gavin Brown\n\nIf you have ever talked to me, you would know that I make it no secret that my favorite band is Pink Floyd. Their psychedelic sounds, combined with deep and thoughtful social commentary, make listening to their music an experience that cannot be replicated by any other group. However, to me, their most unique trait is their form of album production. Floyd wrote songs specifically to be part of an album. Their pieces would merge together to create the effect of a multi-song album only consisting of one or two songs; this brilliant stylistic approach is best seen in their most ambitious project: The Wall.\n\nTo fully understand the depth and genius of The Wall, one must first know the story that inspired the album. In 1977, Pink Floyd was playing a concert for a massive venue in Montreal. Due to poor setup and noisy fans, the sound quality was terrible. This disappointment in the audience manifested itself in heckling of the band, which only made the sound worse. Eventually, the lead singer, Roger Waters, became so frustrated with the antics of the crowd that when he saw a fan rushing towards the stage, he spat on him, an event that became the band’s lowest moment. As Waters was being driven to his hotel that night, he wished that he could build a wall between himself and the audience so he wouldn’t be forced to deal with them, and so the idea for The Wall was born.\n\nFrom virtually the beginning, The Wall was produced as a “rock opera”, which can best be described as a rock album with a plot. In The Wall’s case, the plot follows a washed up former rockstar who goes by the stage name of “Pink”. Pink acts as a stand in for Rogers, as The Wall is a pseudo biographical telling of his life, and many of the events that occur in Pink’s life also occurred in Rogers’. Pink’s life was filled with numerous traumatic moments, including emotional abuse from his mother, physical abuse from his teacher, and drug abuse that he used initially to cope with his problems. However, when the drugs stop working, and Pink’s music career starts failing, he instead decides to ‘build a wall’ as his coping mechanism. The first half of the album follows Pink building his metaphorical wall, while in the second half, Pink realizes his mistake in building the wall, and tries to escape the confines of this prison he has created for himself. Of course, the story is far deeper, but, in the interests of space and spoiler evasion, I’ll leave it at that.\n\nSo what about the musical element of The Wall? After all, to many, it is a musical album first, and a story second. Well, in my personal opinion, the music of the album is the most enjoyable part! The album perfectly meshes so many sounds, voices, and instruments to create an experience unlike any other album. Some songs, like “Another Brick in the Wall, Pt 2” and “Young Lust” create a hyped up, angry feeling in the listener, while songs like “Comfortably Numb” and “Hey You” are far more mellow, allowing the listener to relax and appreciate the musical talent on display. These two styles, as well as many others that are included in the album, blend together to create a beautiful composition that elicits an unparalleled emotional response from the listener.\n\nFor me, the greatest moment of The Wall is “The Trial”, the loudest, most insane, and weirdest song of the album, which also serves as the climax of Pink’s story. The song has a powerful orchestral sound, which is complemented by the numerous wacky voices that Roger Waters and David Gilmour use in order to create a piece that has an incredible range of emotion and character. In many ways, “The Trial” is unlike typical Pink Floyd in every way, and yet, at the same time, it feels distinctly Floyd-esque.\n\nThe album does have its low points, however. The Wall suffers from having a high amount of filler content that exists only to push the story along. Songs like “Vera”, “Bring the Boys Back Home”, and “Empty Spaces” serve only as story propulsion and musically, lack memorability. Additionally, The Wall is a very long album, clocking in at about 1h20, and, considering the compositional style of the album favors listening to in one sitting, it can be very difficult to find the time to give it a full listen.\n\nWith both the positives and negatives of The Wall weighed, I feel required to recommend it to anyone who hasn’t listened to it yet. It is one of the most memorable rock albums ever made, and deserved every accolade that it has ever received. It is not only an album, and not only is it a story, but it is an experience that is impossible to replicate.\n\nFinally, if you enjoy the studio album, I would highly recommend Roger Waters’ live performance of it in 2014. This performance includes two songs that were dropped from the original album, and one original song, written by Waters in the mid-2000s. For this reason, I consider it perhaps superior to the original version."
