        "text": "10 Things You Might Not Know About Pink Floyd\n\nPink Floyd was formed in London in 1965 by students Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright. They gained popularity performing in London’s underground music scene during the late 1960s, and under Barrett’s leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). David Gilmour joined as a fifth member in December 1967 and Barrett left the band in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health exacerbated by drug use. Waters became the band’s primary lyricist and, by the mid-1970s, their dominant songwriter, devising the concepts behind their most critically and commercially successful albums. Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd and Wright rejoined them as a session musician and later a band member. Pink Floyd reunited with Waters in 2005 for a performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006 and Wright in 2008. The final Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River, recorded without Waters and based on material recorded in 1993–1994, was released in November 2014. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the U.K. Music Hall of Fame in 2005. By 2013, the band had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including nearly 75 million certified units in the U.S.\n\nFlip through the gallery for 10 Things You Might Not Know About Pink Floyd!\n\nThis gallery uses material from the Wikipedia article Pink Floyd, which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike License 3.0"
