        "text": "On Saturday at the Smoothie King Center, Pink Floyd mastermind Roger Waters will perform in New Orleans for the first time in 47 years. On his previous visit, things didn’t go so well.\n\nOn May 15-16, 1970, Pink Floyd, at the time an up-and-coming psychedelic rock band from Great Britain, spent two nights at the Warehouse, the famously crude brick concert hall alongside the Tchoupitoulas Street wharves. The bill also included the Allman Brothers Band and an act called Country Funk.\n\nFollowing the second show, as the musicians slept at a local hotel, a truck containing $40,000 worth of musical equipment was stolen from the parking lot. The pilfered gear, according to news reports from the time, included four guitars, two drum kits, an electric organ and a 4,000-watt sound system with 12 speaker cabinets.\n\nPink Floyd's upcoming dates in Texas were canceled, bringing the tour to a premature conclusion.\n\nNearly a half-century later, Waters hasn’t forgotten. Addressing New Orleans listeners during a phone interview with Bayou 95.7 morning radio show host John Osterlind in March, Waters said, somewhat accusingly, “You guys stole a U-Haul with all our equipment.”\n\nWarehouse gigs were also infamous for the stifling heat musicians endured. Vintage concert photos from May 15 show Waters, guitarist David Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason all wearing tank tops onstage.\n\n“I don’t think I’ve ever been anywhere so hot in my life,” Waters told Osterlind.\n\nMishaps aside, he recalled having a fine time otherwise, even catching a Fats Domino show at a near-empty nightclub.\n\nThe heat and the theft probably aren’t what kept Waters away from New Orleans for so long. Pink Floyd simply didn’t tour all that much. The tour for the 1977 album “Animals” stopped at the LSU Assembly Center in Baton Rouge, as most arena tours did before New Orleans built the Lakefront Arena and the Smoothie King Center.\n\nBy the time Pink Floyd played to 40,000 fans at the Superdome on May 14, 1994, during “The Division Bell” tour, Waters had left the band, his estrangement from his bandmates simply becoming too much to bear.\n\nWhile the latter-day Pink Floyd continued to headline stadiums, he released a series of modestly received solo albums and struggled to fill theater-size venues.\n\nBut now that Pink Floyd is no more, Waters has successfully reclaimed the legacy of one of rock’s greatest bands. Over the past decade, he’s mounted hugely successful tours built around the classic Floyd albums “Dark Side of the Moon” and “The Wall.” (Those tours, too, bypassed New Orleans.)\n\nHis current Us + Them Tour, named for one of Pink Floyd’s signature songs, intercuts Pink Floyd classics with a handful of songs from Waters’ new solo album, “Is This the Life We Really Want?” Waters’ thoughts on the human condition factor heavily in the production’s elaborate visuals.\n\nSome elements of the show, such as a series of images that cast Donald Trump in a particularly unflattering light, were first deployed during Waters’ eye-popping performance at the Desert Trip festival in southern California last fall. As it was at Desert Trip, the Battersea power station, famously depicted on the cover of “Animals,” is brought to life on the current tour.\n\nSince Desert Trip, Waters, who plays bass and guitar and also sings, has retooled his band. One holdover is keyboardist/guitarist Jon Carin, who played in the post-Waters version of Pink Floyd and has alternately toured with both Waters and Gilmour ever since. Dave Kilminster continues to carry much of the load on guitar, replicating Gilmour’s distinctive solos.\n\nJoey Waronker, Beck’s longtime drummer, has taken over the drum chair. Guitarist/vocalist Jonathan Wilson sings Gilmour’s parts. Bassist Gus Seyffert, saxophonist Ian Ritchie, keyboardist Drew Erickson and the vocal duo of Holly Laessig and Jessica Wolfe round out the ensemble.\n\nThe production is, as fans have come to expect from Waters, a technological marvel. A high-resolution LED screen, 157 feet long by 40 feet tall, dominates the stage backdrop and extends out over the seats. Six surround-sound speakers created a three-dimensional audio soundscape.\n\nA “laser pyramid” replicates the prism from the “Dark Side of the Moon” cover. After intermission, 17 custom roll-drop screens descend from rafters down the center of the arena, radically revamping the dimensions of the room. A 20-foot-long, remote-controlled inflatable pig takes flight, as does a silver orb that is eight feet in diameter."
