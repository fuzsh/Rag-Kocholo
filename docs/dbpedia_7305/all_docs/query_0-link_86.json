        "text": "Pink Floyd is up there as one of my favorite bands of all time and I am one of the types of fans that has to have everything that has the Floyd name or emblem on it. The more I got into them, the more I realized that the pre-Dark Side era has always been a bit overlooked. With the exception of the inclusion of tracks from Piper and Saucerful on compilations like Echoes, the whole pre-Dark Side era of the Floyd was sort of an enigma. I remember distinctively where I was when I found out the Early Years box set was coming out and I preordered it right away regardless of the price ( I would've made it work somehow!) I understand the reasons why people would be turned off from this release (the price, the size of the box, the quality of some of the material, parts that were missing, etc.) but I, for one, am pleased simply with the fact that the Floyd camp has unleashed this material, especially for a band that was adamant that the finished product was all the public got. Sure the unreleased goodies from the 2011-12 Immersion sets were nice but this is the real deal!"
