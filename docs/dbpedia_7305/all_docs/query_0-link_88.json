        "text": "What does it sound like?:\n\nA vast, all encompassing, wallet busting box set covering Pink Floyd’s work between 1965 and 1972.\n\nThis review covers only the cds in the set – I have not had access to any of the extensive and wide ranging DVD content that is also included.\n\nSo, cd by cd then….\n\nCambridge Station is a two cd offering covering 1965-67. The first of these covers the bands earliest recordings, moving on through the Syd Barrett era. Notably it includes the first official release of Scream Thy Last Scream and Vegetable Man , together with an instrumental backing track for In The Beechwoods – it’s slightly strange to hear these still disturbing pieces in pristine quality after years of bootleg versions. The second disc is in two sections. The first is a live recording of rather variable quality from Stockholm in 1967, while the second part covers the John Latham sessions – recordings intended to accompany a film – I think the phrase avant garde is appropriate here! They are pretty hard going – maybe they made more sense with the visual accompaniment, but I can’t imagine too many people will sit through these more than once or twice.\n\nGermination – a single cd with material from 1968 – a few more studio tracks but the bulk of this cd comprises two previously unreleased BBC sessions, the highlights being good versions of Interstellar Overdrive and A Saucerful Of Secrets, with an early attempt at Embryo.\n\nDramatisation – welcome to 1969 with the first of two cds kicking off with some alternate and unreleased versions of songs from the More album, together with the Harvest sampler version of Embryo. Another BBC session – highlights Cymbaline and Green Is The Colour, and a top live set from Amsterdam with great versions of Interstellar, Saucerful, Set The Controls and Careful With That Axe Eugene, showing the band firing on all cylinders. The second cd features a complete performance of The Man and The Journey, again from Amsterdam. Once more, it’s nice to have a good quality recording of this legendary piece after years of bootlegs.\n\nDeviation – we reach 1970 with this two cd selection. The first starts with a live Atom Heart Mother before moving onto another BBC session, including an extended Embryo and an epic 25 minute Atom Heart Mother with choir and orchestra. The second disc has 16 unreleased tracks from the Zabriskie Point soundtrack, before concluding with another Atom Heart, this one being an early studio take with band only.\n\n1971 is covered by Reverberation, only a single cd, but all unreleased material and one of the most interesting in this box for me. Another BBC session with Embryo, Fat Old Sun (extended to 15 minutes), One Of These Days and a stately lengthy rendering of Echoes. A fascinating early demo of that piece, Nothing (part 14), is also included.\n\nObfuscation deals with 1972’s Obscured By Clouds album, given a brush up and new coat of paint in this 2016 remix – one of their more overlooked albums and certainly worth listening to afresh.\n\nThe final cd – Bonus Continuation – covers three unreleased BBC sessions from 1967/68, interestingly again including versions of Scream Thy Last Scream and Vegetable Man. Also included at last is the Moonhead piece from the BBC coverage of the 1969 moon landings. The set concludes with an impressive live performance of Echoes taken from Wembley in 1974.\n\nWhat does it all *mean*?\n\nThis monumental set basically hoovers up all the releasable material from Pink Floyd in this era – as Nick Mason said recently, Floyd have gone from being incredibly meticulous about what they allowed to be released to one that has now actively been seeking out releasable material.\n\nGoes well with…\n\nObviously this is a very expensive set, although you do get a lot of unreleased material for your money on the numerous cds and DVDs. This is certainly one for the completist rather than the casual fan – the latter would be better served by the two cd highlights set ‘Creation’ or by hanging on until next year when the first six of these cds will be made available separately.\n\nRelease Date:\n\nMight suit people who like…\n\nI’ll finish with another Nick Mason quote – ‘everyone’s in the recycling business now.’ Hopefully more Floyd albums will get similar treatment – how about Animals and The Final Cut next?"
