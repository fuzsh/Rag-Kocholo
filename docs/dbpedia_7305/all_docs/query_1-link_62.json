        "text": "Brit Floyd travels with two trucks packed to the gills with musical equipment, lasers, projectors, lights and an inflatable pig or two.\n\nThe band has had a PBS special. Its 2015 Space & Time Tour includes more than a hundred shows, including a sold-out date later this month at the famed Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado, which holds nearly 10,000 fans.\n\nAnd Brit Floyd is a tribute band. The group doesn't play any original songs, instead playing note-for-note versions of Pink Floyd hits.\n\n\"We put on a very substantial show,\" said Damian Darlington, the band's guitarist and music director. \"There's a huge light show, there's video projections, there's lasers, there's inflatables and there's over 2 1/2 hours of the best of Pink Floyd music running alongside all of that.\"\n\nThe band formed in 2010 as the British Pink Floyd Show after Darlington's previous band, the Australian Pink Floyd Show, split. Many of the players in this band have been playing \"Comfortably Numb,\" \"Have a Cigar,\" \"Money\" and other Pink Floyd favorites for decades, first with the Australian band and now with the British one. The band brings 11 musicians and singers onto the stage.\n\nBut, much like Pink Floyd itself - which hasn't toured since the '90s and last played together in 2005 - the show is about the visuals as much as it is about the music. Fans will see lasers and video projections and maybe a flying pig or two.\n\n\"There's something very special about Pink Floyd, I would say,\" Darlington said. \"Plus the visual aspect of the show goes hand in hand with it. Pink Floyd was such a pioneering band when it came to developing the visual side of concerts.\"\n\nDarlington said the band's goal every night is to sound as much like Pink Floyd as possible.\n\n\"Our main aim is to recreate Pink Floyd albums as closely as we can,\" he said in a phone interview last week from Baltimore, where the band was preparing to play a show. \"There's a little bit of leeway there to put our own personal stamp on things. Our musical personalities come to the fore here and there but fundamentally we are trying to recreate these things note for note as closely as we can.\"\n\nBrit Floyd's set list includes \"See Emily Play,\" which dates back to 1967, and \"Louder Than Words,\" which was released last year. The big hits are all there - \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\" \"Breathe,\" \"Wish You Were Here,\" \"One of These Days,\" \"Run Like Hell,\" something from every studio album Pink Floyd ever released. There's hardly anything Brit Floyd can't play, Darlington said.\n\n\"There's a few tracks from the early Pink Floyd albums where they were being very experimental where you just can't do that live; it was a studio experiment,\" he said. \"Things off 'Umagumma,' for example. There are things like that that you'd never do live. But 90-odd percent of the Pink Floyd catalog, you could do it all, and we have done most of it.\"\n\nTom Szaroleta: (904) 359-4548"
