        "text": "With their unique brand of philosophical art-rock, Pink Floyd rose to become one of history’s most influential bands. Formed in 1965, the group consisted of Cambridge natives Roger Waters (bass), Nick Mason (drums), Richard Wright (keyboards), and original frontman Syd Barrett (guitar/vocals). After Barrett’s 1968 departure due to mental health struggles, David Gilmour stepped in on guitar and shared vocals with Waters. This core trio of Waters, Gilmour, and Wright then catapulted Pink Floyd into superstardom throughout the 1970s as they perfected the cerebral concept album. But with lavish productions and dense songwriting, the question remained: who actually wrote Pink Floydâs classic songs?\n\nOverview of Pink Floyd’s Core Songwriters\n\nBefore diving into the specifics, letâs briefly introduce Pink Floydâs three key songwriters over the years and their roles:\n\nRoger Waters:Â Bassist and main songwriter from 1968â1985. Wrote lyrics focused on philosophical themes. Known for albums likeÂ The Dark Side of the Moon,Â Wish You Were Here, andÂ The Wall.\n\nDavid Gilmour:Â Joined in 1967 as guitarist and co-lead vocalist. Known for lyrical guitar solos and melodic contributions. Became primary songwriter after Waters’ departure.\n\nRichard Wright:Â Keyboardist and sometimes lyricist from 1965-1979, 1987-1996. Added ambient textures and emotional musical passages.\n\nOther members like drummer Nick Mason, early guitarist Syd Barrett, and keyboardist Richard Wright also received co-writing credits on select songs.\n\nNow let’s dive into the songwriting credits, starting with those written solely by each main writer.\n\nSongs Written Solely by Roger Waters\n\nAs Pink Floydâs chief lyricist for nearly 20 years, the majority of Waters’ songwriting credits come from solo efforts. He wrote the following 58 songs alone:\n\nLet There Be More Light\n\nSet The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\n\nCorporal Clegg\n\nCirrus Minor\n\nThe Nile Song\n\nCrying Song\n\nGreen Is The Colour\n\nCymbaline\n\nGrantchester Meadows\n\nSeveral Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict\n\nIf\n\nJulia Dream\n\nBiding My Time\n\nSan Tropez\n\nFree Four\n\nMoney\n\nBrain Damage\n\nEclipse\n\nWelcome To The Machine\n\nHave A Cigar\n\nPigs On The Wing (Part 1)\n\nPigs (Three Different Ones)\n\nSheep\n\nPigs On The Wing (Part 2)\n\nIn The Flesh?\n\nThe Thin Ice\n\nAnother Brick In The Wall, Pt. 1\n\nThe Happiest Days Of Our Lives\n\nAnother Brick In The Wall, Pt. 2\n\nMother\n\nGoodbye Blue Sky\n\nEmpty Spaces\n\nOne Of My Turns\n\nDonât Leave Me Now\n\nAnother Brick In The Wall, Pt. 3\n\nGoodbye Cruel World\n\nHey You\n\nIs There Anybody Out There?\n\nNobody Home\n\nVera\n\nBring The Boys Back Home\n\nThe Show Must Go On\n\nIn The Flesh\n\nWaiting For The Worms\n\nStop\n\nOutside The Wall\n\nThe Post War Dream\n\nYour Possible Pasts\n\nOne Of The Few\n\nThe Hero’s Return\n\nThe Gunner’s Dream\n\nParanoid Eyes\n\nGet Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert\n\nThe Fletcher Memorial Home\n\nSouthampton Dock\n\nThe Final Cut\n\nNot Now John\n\nTwo Suns In The Sunset\n\nThat’s quite an impressive songwriting resume! Notice Waters dominated the writing credits on landmark Pink Floyd albums like _The Wall, Wish You Were Here, Animals, _andÂ The Final Cut.\n\nSongs Written Solely by David Gilmour\n\nWhile best known for his lyrical guitar playing, David Gilmour does have a number of solo songwriting credits in Pink Floyd’s catalog:\n\nA Spanish Piece\n\nThe Narrow Way (Parts I-III)\n\nFat Old Sun\n\nChildhood’s End\n\nThough small in number, songs like “Fat Old Sun” and “Childhood’s End” are among Pink Floyd’s most beloved album tracks. Gilmour would take on a larger songwriting role following Waters’ departure in the late 1980s.\n\nSongs Written Solely by Richard Wright\n\nOften overlooked, keyboard maestro Richard Wright contributed some all-time gems to Pink Floyd’s catalog:\n\nRemember A Day\n\nSee Saw\n\nSysyphus (Parts I-IV)\n\nSummer ’68\n\nPaint Box\n\nThe Great Gig In The Sky\n\nWright’s atmospheric keyboard textures were integral to Pink Floyd’s signature sound. Songs like âThe Great Gig In The Skyâ demonstrate his brilliance as a songwriter and arranger.\n\nSongs Written by Gilmour and Waters\n\nThe guitar duo of Gilmour and Waters co-wrote several major Pink Floyd classics over the years:\n\nA Pillow Of Winds\n\nFearless\n\nObscured By Clouds\n\nThe Gold It’s In The…\n\nWots…Uh The Deal?\n\nOn The Run\n\nWish You Were Here\n\nDogs\n\nYoung Lust\n\nComfortably Numb\n\nRun Like Hell\n\nFromÂ Wish You Were Here’sÂ title track toÂ The Wall’sÂ explosive “Comfortably Numb” guitar solo, this dynamic duo created some all-timers when they collaborated.\n\nSongs Written by Waters and Wright\n\nThe more lyrical Waters combined forces with the more atmospheric Wright to co-write these three songs:\n\nBurning Bridges\n\nStay\n\nUs And Them\n\nWhile a short list, the towering “Us And Them” remains one of Pink Floyd’s most beloved compositions.\n\nSongs Written by Gilmour, Waters, Wright, and Mason\n\nWhen all four musicians combined their talents, epic magic unfolded. Pink Floyd wrote these songs as a foursome:\n\nA Saucerful Of Secrets\n\nParty Sequence\n\nMain Theme\n\nIbiza Bar\n\nMore Blues\n\nQuicksilver\n\nDramatic Piece\n\nAtom Heart Mother\n\nAlan’s Psychedelic Breakfast\n\nCareful With That Axe, Eugene\n\nOne Of These Days\n\nSeamus\n\nEchoes\n\nWhen Youâre In\n\nAbsolutely Curtains\n\nBreathe In The Air\n\nTime\n\nBreathe (Reprise)\n\nShine On You Crazy Diamond, Pts. I-V\n\nShine On You Crazy Diamond, Pts. VI-IX\n\nFrom the 23-minute “Echoes” to “Timeâs sweeping transitions, the talent fusion of all four members spawned Pink Floyd’s most epic endeavors. Their creative chemistry was never stronger than in the early 1970s.\n\nOther Notable Songwriting Credits\n\nA few other names pop up in the songwriting credits for Pink Floyd:\n\nJugband Blues – Syd Barrett\n\nUp The Khyber – Nick Mason/Rick Wright\n\nThe Grand Vizier’s Garden Party (Parts IâIII) – Nick Mason\n\nMudmen – Richard Wright/David Gilmour\n\nSpeak To Me – Nick Mason\n\nAny Colour You Like – David Gilmour/Nick Mason/Richard Wright\n\nThe Trial – Roger Waters/Bob Ezrin\n\nThese songs came from some of Pink Floyd’s early albums and film soundtracks. Barrett, Mason, and producer Bob Ezrin made small but meaningful contributions.\n\nSummary By Member\n\nIf we tally up all of the songwriting credits for Pink Floyd members, the numbers shake out as follows:\n\nRoger Waters:Â 93 songs\n\nDavid Gilmour:Â 37 songs (39 if you count The Narrow Way’s 3 parts separately)\n\nRichard Wright:Â 32 songs (35 if you count Sysyphus’ 4 parts separately)\n\nNick Mason:Â 7 songs (9 if you count Grand Vizier’s Garden Party’s 3 parts separately)\n\nSo by pure songwriting volume, Waters takes the title. But the output of Gilmour and Wright is extremely impressive as well.\n\nAnd while his songwriting credits are the fewest, Nick Masonâs epic drumming is just as vital to Pink Floydâs singular sound.\n\nBreaking Down The Writing Process\n\nSo how did these four musical masterminds actually write all these classic tunes?\n\nIn the early days, the band would often jam together in the studio until ideas started to crystallize into song structures.\n\nBut in later albums, Waters took a leadership role and brought more fully formed song ideas to the group. He would write initial demos on an acoustic guitar or piano, outline general ideas, and record simple tapings of melodies and lyrics.\n\nGilmour would then take those raw ideas and expand them with guitar parts and solos. He also assisted with finalizing melodies and song structures.\n\nAs for lyrics, Roger Waters focused on themes of human conflict, greed, fear, time, death, and mental illness. The music matched his poetic yet hard-hitting words.\n\nWright’s keyboards and textures complemented those themes with emotional fragility and melancholy. His contributions provided a softer counterpoint to Watersâ biting lyricism.\n\nSo while Waters often originated the concepts, Gilmour and Wrightâs additions completed Pink Floydâs recordings into transcendent songs.\n\nThe collaborations with engineer Alan Parsons also massaged the material into top sonic shape through careful editing, panning, and effects.\n\nThrough this combination of forces, the four members (five including Parsons) nurtured simple musical ideas into all-time rock classics.\n\nLasting Influence\n\nDecades later, Pink Floydâs albums still land on all-time-great lists and their songs endure on classic rock radio.\n\nVery few bands can match their consistency in delivering absolute grade-A material for well over a decade:\n\n15 studio albums\n\nOver 120 combined songwriting credits\n\n75+ million albums sold\n\nSongwriting that shaped entire genres\n\nAll of that legendary output stems from the creative friction and chemistry between Roger Waters, David Gilmour, and Richard Wright.\n\nThey each brought immense talent and unconventional flair to the musical equation. And Pink Floyd’s catalog of perfect albums and life-changing songs is the output.\n\nWhile they had a messy breakup and war of words through the media, the quality and influence of those songs remain untouched. That is the greatest legacy of the Waters/Gilmour/Wright songwriting partnership.\n\nSo hopefully this breakdown has shed light on the writing credits behind Pink Floydâs monumental works. They produced countless all-time classicsâwhich makes parsing the specifics rather tricky.\n\nBut donât just take my word for it! What are your favorite Pink Floyd songs? And did any songwriting credits here surprise you? Let me know about that!"
