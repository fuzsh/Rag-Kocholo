        "text": "Legendary musicians Pink Floyd are releasing their first new song in almost 30 years in support of Ukraine. Proceeds from Hey Hey Rise Up, which will be released today (Friday, April 8), will go to Ukrainian Humanitarian Relief.\n\nThe song features vocals from Ukrainian singer Andriy Khlyvnyuk from the band Boombox, with whom Pink Floyd singer and guitarist David Gilmour performed in 2015. It is the first song the band has recorded together since 1994's The Division Bell.\n\nAlthough they rarely make music together any more, Pink Floyd still includes some members of its original line-up which has close ties to Cambridge. Gilmour, who is the impetus behind the new track, was born and grew up in the historic city.\n\nRead more: Pink Floyd announce first music in 28 years and it's in aid of Ukraine\n\nGilmour lived on Mill Road and attended the Perse School on Hills Road before going on to study at the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology, which would later become Anglia Ruskin University. It was in Cambridge that he met future bandmates Syd Barrett and Roger Waters who attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys - now Hills Road Sixth Form College.\n\nBarrett attended Morley Primary School was a Scout in the 7th Cambridge troop. His earliest experiences of music, including seeing The Rolling Stones perform live, were in Cambridge and he also spent his later years in the city. He was also said to be a regular at The Crown, later called The Flying Pig.\n\nBarrett returned to Cambridge in 1978 after leaving Pink Floyd where he became a painter and a gardener. A recluse in his final years, he died at at home in St. Margaret's Square, Cambridge, in 2006 and his possessions were sold at Cheffins auction house. Tributes to Barrett can be found around Cambridge, including a memorial bench at the Botanic Gardens.\n\nWaters, Pink Floyd's bassist, attended Morley Memorial Junior School in Cambridge and was chairman of the Cambridge Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (YCND) as a teenager. He wrote the song Grantchester Meadows which was released in 1969.\n\nHey Hey Rise Up features David Gilmour and fellow founding member Nick Mason, as well as bassist Guy Pratt and keyboardist Nitin Sawhney. The song will be released at midnight."
