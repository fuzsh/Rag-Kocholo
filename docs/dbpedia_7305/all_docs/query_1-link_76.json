        "text": "Few bands in rock and roll history have the legendary musical status as Pink Floyd. The classic art-rockers redefined popular music with albums like Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall, Animals, Wish You Were Here, and countless others, offering a unique blend that incorporated rock, jazz, psychedelia, and so much more.\n\nDespite the fruits of their creative partnership, tensions between David Gilmour and Roger Waters caused rifts within the band’s musical fabric. After dominating the charts for most of the ’70s, the classic Pink Floyd lineup was never the same after that decade, as Waters left the group in 1985. The band toured without Waters until 1994, and only reunited with him once in 2005, at the global awareness concert, Live 8. The show was the first time that the band played together in 24 years, and it would also be the last.\n\nWith keyboardist Rick Wright‘s passing in 2008, the end of the Pink Floyd legacy was all but cemented. Waters and Gilmour have both openly said that they have no intention of reuniting Pink Floyd, though even if they did, the band would not be the same without Wright’s iconic work on the keys. In honor of the group’s legacy, we wanted to share footage from the group’s final performance.\n\nRelated: Pink Floyd Releases New Single To Support Ukraine, “Hey Hey Rise Up” [Video]\n\nTaken from Live 8 on this day 19 years ago, July 2nd, 2005, watch all four core members of Pink Floyd perform “Speak To Me/Breathe”, “Money”, “Wish You Were Here”, and “Comfortably Numb”.\n\nPink Floyd – Festival 8 – London, England – 7/2/05\n\n[Video: michele matraia]\n\n[Originally published 7/2/16]"
