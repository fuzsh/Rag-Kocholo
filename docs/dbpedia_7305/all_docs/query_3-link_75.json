        "text": "They’re another brick in the wall.\n\nMoney, for Pink Floyd’s sake.\n\nIt’s OK to call Brit Floyd a “tribute band” — for lack of a better, more dignified term that describes an electrifying show that has drawn more than a million fans to some of the biggest rock arenas in the U.S. and the world since they formed in 2011.\n\nAnd why not? This 11-piece, British-based homage to the psychedelic legends that gave the music world “Dark Side of the Moon” and “The Wall” bills themselves as “Brit Floyd — The World’s Greatest Pink Floyd Tribute Show” on their own website.\n\n“The term ‘tribute band’ has been around so long, I don’t think anybody has a problem with that reference,” Brit Floyd guitarist, vocalist and musical director Damian Darlington says.\n\n“I don’t like to put ourselves in the same bracket as one of those tribute bands that goes out to put wigs on and try to look like the artist,” Darlington says, “but in the absence of a better word, ‘tribute band’ is fine.”\n\nWhen Brit Floyd takes the stage Friday at The Morris Performing Arts Center, the only things missing from a Pink Floyd concert will be David Gilmour, Roger Waters, Richard Wright, Nick Mason, Bob Klose and Syd Barrett — Pink Floyd’s trailblazing songwriter who left the band in 1968 (paving the way for Gilmour to join), then died in 2006.\n\nThe mind-blowing light show, that universe-powered wall of sound and those slow, bluesy, constellation-driven songs that transported millions of listeners to the “Dark Side of the Moon” and beyond through a set of headphones all will be re-enacted down to the hypnotic reverb of Gilmour’s pedal steel guitar on “Breathe.”\n\n“Fundamentally,” Darlington says, “we are trying to re-create these albums. Every sound effect, every drum fill, every guitar is note for note. Outside of that, there is a little bit of room to put our own collective personalities into the music.”\n\nDarlington, 45, was born in Teeside in the northeastern part of England two years after Pink Floyd released its first album, “The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,” in 1967.\n\nA year after he picked up the guitar “seriously” at the age of 12, Darlington heard “The Wall” for the first time. Such lightning-fast jazz fusion guitar influences as Al DiMeola, Pat Metheny and John McLaughlin gave way to a melodic crawl on the frets when Gilmour entered the picture.\n\n“David Gilmour was never a speed merchant,” Darlington says. “There’s no fast runs, but … as a feel-guitarist, and as somebody who pioneered these different sounds, learning to play as David Gilmour (is) as much of a challenge as learning how to play as Pat Metheny.”\n\nBy the age of 15, Darlington was performing at pubs and clubs around England. There was an original band, The Helicopters, which put Darlington on stage alongside his brothers and sisters, including brother Gareth, who works as Brit Floyd’s sound engineer.\n\nBut playing the music of Pink Floyd was Darlington’s calling, and in 1994 he joined his first Pink Floyd tribute band, the Australian Pink Floyd Show.\n\nFor 17 years, Darlington performed the music of Pink Floyd with The Australian Pink Floyd Show in 1,300 shows all over the world in theaters, large music halls and rock arenas, including the Royal Albert Hall and Wembley Stadium in London, and the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2011, Darlington took fellow Aussie Floyd members keyboardist Rob Stringer, bassist Ian Cattell, guitarist Bobby Harrison and backing vocalist Emily Jollands and added saxophonist and multi-instrumentalist Carl Brunsdon; former Andy Summers, Robbie Robertson and Dave Knopfler Band drummer Arran Ahmun; and backing vocalists Ola Bienkowska, Angela Cervantes and Jacquie Williams to form Brit Floyd.\n\nPerhaps the most significant addition was Darlington’s brother Gareth, an accomplished “sound designer” who had overseen the sound and laser light shows for the Australian Pink Floyd Show.\n\nCapturing the sound that continues to enchant Pink Floyd fans to this day, 40-plus years later, is the secret to a tribute band playing big arenas such as Red Rocks in Denver, where Brit Floyd preserved one amazing show on video.\n\n“I’m very keen on picking apart everything, getting the sounds right on the guitar rigs, all the details,” Darlington says. “It’s become a labor of love, and it’s also about the video — we have it specially produced for the show.\n\n“Financially,” Darlington adds of taking a world-class mega-tribute on tour, “it’s certainly bigger than most, if not all the tribute bands out there. It’s bigger than some of the mainstream bands with album sales.\n\n“But,” he notes, “we also have a knack of squeezing every bit out of a performance.”\n\nThat knack has captured the ears of none other than the genuine Pink Floyd members themselves. Darlington first met David Gilmour in 1994, and played at the guitarist’s 50th birthday party alongside Pink Floyd keyboardist Rick Wright, who died in 2008.\n\nMore recently, Guy Pratt, Pink Floyd’s touring bassist, sat in with Brit Floyd for an impromptu jam.\n\n“We know that they’re aware of us,” Darlington says. “They’ve seen our DVDs, and Guy Pratt joined us for a show, so there’s a bit of a connection there.\n\n“Over the years,” Darlington adds, “(the connection) wouldn’t have happened if we didn’t have an appreciation for the music.”\n\nIt’s the ultimate tribute to “A Great Gig in the Sky.”\n\n“In ’94,” Darlington says, “I got the opportunity to join a tribute band to one of my favorite bands.\n\n“I grabbed it,” he says, “and here I am 20 years later, playing and touring around the world.”"
