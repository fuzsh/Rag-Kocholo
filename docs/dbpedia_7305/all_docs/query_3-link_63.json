        "text": "# Psychedelic Rock# Rock# Progressive Rock\n\nPink Floyd, formed in 1965 in London, pioneered progressive rock with extended compositions, philosophical lyrics, and elaborate live shows. Led by Roger Waters' thematic vision, their albums like The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) and The Wall (1979) are classics. Inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, they remain icons of musical innovation."
