        "text": "He tried to empower the audience with the idea of religion, having reassured them that God gave them power and they were not weak. He then attempted to use this empowerment to convince that a correct way to use their God-given power was to act against Britain, implying this through the current argument and his stance on the issue. He emphasized this with contradictory words of “weak” and “power” to make it more important in the audience's mind. As a whole, the statement is used to give them feelings of pride toward their country and powerful in the eyes of God. As a result, Henry used the ideas of nationalism and religion to emphasize and create a feeling of patriotism.\n\nImmediately as the speech begins, Henry’s tone manifests itself and remains unwavering. Henry begins, “It is natural for a man to indulge in the illustration of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth” (1). This sheds insight on his message and portrays him as a well versed individual. He then strengthens his tone when he says\n\nMoreover, while building up his ethos, Henry uses pathos to give himself credibility. He uses words like freedom and slavery to move his audience to fight. His audience already agrees that freedom is worth fighting for but they lack the motivation to act. Henry knows this and creates his speech to remind them of the power of\n\nFinally, what I consider the most powerful technique Henry uses is the fallacy of appealing to emotion. Henry talks about various actions that the colonists have already taken to protest the English government, such as, “We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated…” By doing so, the audience is reminded of all these things that have been done, only to realize that they have failed. Henry “reveals” that the English government has only denied them and turned them down each time. “Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned…” This quote builds up anger in the audience, creating great contempt for the British. The colonists start to feel as though the British have no intention to care about them and will take advantage of Americans every chance they get.\n\nn Shakespeare's King Henry V, King Henry prepares his troops for battle with a passionate speech about fighting, honor, and kinship. Henry uses strong ethos and pathos to persuade his men to fight the French, though they are outnumbered in the battle. Henry notes that his troops feel unprepared and overwhelmed for battle. This speech marks the moment where the boy Hal transforms into King Henry. For the first time, Henry takes on the role of a valiant king and takes control of the situation. He seizes the moment to prepare them and inspire them. Henry hopes by making an effective speech his men will understand why they need to fight.\n\nHis suggestion closely parallels the actions of North Korean refugees. Despite being ruled and propagandized to lay faith in their nation and in their ruler, Kim-Jong Un, the refugees trusted in themselves, listened to banned foreign broadcasts, and escaped from North Korea. Henry, like those refugees, did not believe in the integrity of the governing power: Henry believed in the integrity of his own\n\nHenry V, written by William Shakespeare, is by far one of his more historically accurate plays. This play is the life of young King Henry V, who ascended to the throne after his father, Henry IV's death. These times were much different for England, as Henry V was a noble lord whom everyone loved, whereas angry factions haunted his father's reign. Shakespeare portrays a fairly accurate account of the historical Henry V, but certain parts are either\n\nHenry V is a wise and loyal king, changing from a wild youth to a mature king. He is described to be an intelligent, thoughtful and an efficient statesman. He thinks carefully whether to invade France or not which represents his responsible character. King Henry gives a very strong speech which gave courage and confidence to his army that they could win the battle. This character describes him to be a king of great ability to fight and having good administrative skills. Throughout the play Henry’s nature is religious, merciful and compassionate.\n\nOnce in power, the King gained popularity by purposefully hiding away from the public eye. By separating himself from the common man, King Henry was able to create a fable-like image of himself. By doing so, he “Stole all courtesy from heaven, / And dressed myself in such humility, / That I did pluck allegiance from men’s hearts, / Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths, / Even in the presence of the crowned king” (III.2 51-54). By asserting the traditional relationship between King and subject, King Henry is able to maintain his power in part on his image alone. King Henry describes himself “like a robe pontifical, / Ne’er seen but wondered at” (III.2 55-56).\n\nHenry V was the England leader who led his army to the battle of Agincourt. The character of Henry V has particularly created for the play to display the connection with several thoughts and events that are significant to the society of Shakespeare’s period. According to what mentioned in the article, “He spoke of God, and never mentioned the word ‘defeat.’ He talked about children being proud of their fathers who fought in this battle. He said ‘we are a band of brothers’ and he is one of them. He connected to the mission and to the people.” (What Shakespeare’s Henry V Tells Us about Leadership, Motivation, Wooing, and hanging, N. P) The speech makes someone think of how smart Henry V is and how skilled at public speaking because he was trying\n\nShakespearean plays are complex, intricate pieces of work in which a diverse range of interpretations and readings can be made. This is particularly true of his comedies, where the light-hearted humour is often offset by darker, more serious undertones. In adapting these comedies it is for the director – in the cinematic context – to decide how to interpret the play and which elements are privileged and which are suppressed. This variance in interpretation is exemplified in comparing two of the more recent cinematic adaptations of Shakespeare’s comedies, Trevor Nunn’s Twelfth Night and Kenneth Branagh’s A Much Ado About Nothing [‘Much Ado’]. Although both films can to an extent be seen as\n\nAt first, the movie portrays Henry in a negative light. He seems very evil: killing one wife and immediately marrying the next. He is short with his courts' people and comes off profoundly uncultured. At his meals, he devours his food and throws the bones on the floor. He is constantly needing to be cleaned up after and watched. Even though he shows this ignorant side to everyone else, he secretly cares about his image and how he acts. He goes to get his beard trimmed and comes down his hair before he talks to a woman he is interested in. When he talks to Catherine Howard, his fifth wife, he knocks on the door before coming in. He talks sweetly to her and isn’t short with her. Although he portrayed this “tough guy” with the kingdom, he was a teddy bear at heart hoping for love and affection."
