        "text": "OOPS!\n\nSorry, I hadn't uploaded\n\nthe recent sounds page, so\n\nwhen you went to it all you got\n\nwas what you didn't want.\n\nI have uploaded the new page\n\nand you should be able to see\n\nwhat you want now.\n\nThanks and sorry.\n\nNews for July 5th, 1999\n\nSound samples of the\n\nmovie soundtrack cd are\n\navailable in the\n\nsounds section as RealAudio.\n\nThey're not very good quality\n\nand aren't of the really good\n\nsongs, but you get a taste of it.\n\nNews For July 3rd, 1999\n\nA long quote from Kenneth\n\nBranagh from the soundtrack\n\ncd cover has been added to\n\nthe sounds section. The\n\nsounds section has also been\n\nre-done tremendously.\n\nHenry V\n\nThe Unofficial Page\n\n.\n\nKenneth Branagh (at right) did a splendid job both acting as Henry V himself and directing this film. The deep emotion that this film causes is portrayed through him. He sets a perfect example of a Godly authority who wouldn't let friend nor fiend stand in the way of carrying out a punishment, a decision, or a war.\n\nHenry V was an excellent portrayal of a humble King (Kenneth Branagh) who knows what leadership is and how to handle it. By God's guiding he decides that he must to go war against France to regain his fathers land, and to gain the princess Kathryn of France as his Queen. But it wasn't just for earthly gain, it was that he wanted to teach his subjects what loyalty was, both TO his subjects and to God, he wanted to show them that sometimes we must \"die to ourselves\" in order to do what is right. In several instances he is presented with the choice to save a friend, or maybe go the easy way and just let something go, and he chooses to do whatever is right. One in particular (left) was very clever. Right now he is facing three men, traitors to the King, Henry V that is. He presented them with a case of a previous date of a drunkard that shouted some vile things about the king. He asked them their opinions. They demanded that he be punished severely, even though Henry suggested he be let go. Then, giving them each papers, written on them each a sentence of death for the betrayal, they all turn white, and Henry confronts them. After they beg for mercy, he puts it back in their face, saying \"the same mercy which was quick of late at your own hands is suppressed and killed! You dare not speak of mercy!\" meaning their words are turned against them. The film is loaded with extremely clever and wise situations such as this.\n\nI encourage the whole family to watch this movie, and although the King James English can be a bit difficult to understand at times, you will gain unmatched morals by watching this humble and wise king gain victory over victory over those who would try to suppress it.\n\n.\n\nI would really like to know who and how many people visit this site. I would greatly appreciate\n\nif all who visit this page could post their comments, suggestions, etc. in the guestbook.\n\nThanks.\n\n.\n\n.\n\ne-mail: ndaher@characterlink.net\n\nhome page: http://cyberstop.hypermart.net\n\n..\n\nSince August 19, 1999\n\n.\n\nPage Updated: Thursday, August 19, 1999\n\n."
