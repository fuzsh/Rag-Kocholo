        "text": "When it comes to directors breaking into the industry with a debut that puts many veterans to shame, Kenneth Branagh is never mentioned or considered, despite the fact that he should be in the top ten.\n\nIndeed, his debut picture, a film adaptation of William Shakespeare's play Henry V, is among the best cinematic adaptations of the Bard's work. There are films that cost about a hundred million dollars that don't come close to the immersiveness of this film, like just the sheer ambition and scope on exhibit here is astounding and breathtaking. The idea that something of this magnitude was done for only nine million (around twenty-two million now) is more than astonishing, looking even more expensive on screen.…\n\nThe best scenes in Henry V (which by all accounts is a Kenneth Branagh show) are not the famous speech at the siege of Harfleur (\"Once more unto the breach...\"); or Henry's incognito, nocturnal wanderings in the English camp as he takes stock of his host; racked with doubt and grappling with the moral burden of his decisions.\n\nNo - the best scenes are the ones with Katherine, played by the ever luminous Emma Thompson. The first, almost entirely in French and devoid of subtitles, where the princess is learning English with her lady in-waiting. Thompson, so gleefully expressive and vibrant, there's little need for a translation as we're completely swept up in her energy. The second; the final scene…\n\nHenry V\n\n“If we are to represent Shakespeare by only one play, it ought to be the complete “Henry IV” plays.” Harold Bloom, Literary Scholar (1)\n\nKenneth Branagh was in his 20s when he made Henry V, his first feature film, and he was already being anticipated to be the next Laurence Olivier: a classically trained actor who could make Shakespeare accessible to contemporary audiences. Instead, as an actor, Branagh moved into a career of acting in Hollywood films and British TV, while occasionally returning to the stage. As a director, he stayed committed to adapting Shakespeare, directing 4 other Shakespeare films, but also directed films in other genres. Like Lawrence Olivier, Branagh wrote the script, directed and acted in…\n\n\"His jest will savor but of shallow wit\n\nWhen thousands weep more than did laugh at it.\"\n\nThough it was acclaimed upon release and remains a favorite among the Bard's faithful, Kenneth Branagh's Henry V has somehow slipped out of the popular rotation despite being a perfectly solid gem of a Shakespeare adaptation. The film manages to make the dated dialogue feel passionate and accessible (through edits that preserve the spirit rather than the letters on the page), helped along by a stunning array of classically-trained talent: Branagh takes center stage, but you'll also be able to spot Judi Dench, veteran Paul Scofield, Emma Thompson, Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane, and even a babyfaced Christian Bale; I need the dulcet tones…\n\n\"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers, for he today who sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.\" ~ King Henry V\n\nIf you enjoy Shakespearean drama, you couldn't ask for a much better portrayal of the Bard's craft than this directorial debut by Kenneth Branagh. It contains one of the most stirring calls to arms ever delivered to soldiers about to go into battle, one of the bloodiest, muddiest and most frustrating medieval combat scenes ever filmed, a marriage proposal worthy of high comedy, and a cast full of stars that would honor any stage. It's simply a gripping drama.\n\nBranagh himself takes the lead as young Henry V, recently enthroned in London and ready…"
