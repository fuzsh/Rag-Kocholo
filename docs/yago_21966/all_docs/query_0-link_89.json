No, my fair cousin;\n\nIf we are mark'd to die, we are enough\n\nTo do our country loss; and if to live,\n\nThe fewer men, the greater share of honour.\n\nGod's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.\n\nBy Jove, I am not covetous for gold,\n\nNor care I who doth feed upon my cost;\n\nIt yearns me not if men my garments wear;\n\nSuch outward things dwell not in my desires.\n\nBut if it be a sin to covet honour,\n\nI am the most offending soul alive.\n\nNo, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.\n\nGod's peace! I would not lose so great an honour\n\nAs one man more methinks would share from me\n\nFor the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!\n\nRather proclaim it, Westmorland, through my host,\n\nThat he which hath no stomach to this fight,\n\nLet him depart; his passport shall be made,\n\nAnd crowns for convoy put into his purse;\n\nWe would not die in that man's company\n\nThat fears his fellowship to die with us.\n\nThis day is called the feast of Crispian:\n\nHe that outlives this day, and comes safe home,\n\nWill stand a tip-toe when this day is named,\n\nAnd rouse him at the name of Crispian.\n\nHe that shall see this day and live old age,\n\nWill yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,\n\nAnd say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispin's':\n\nThen will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.\n\nAnd say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'\n\nOld men forget: yet all shall be forgot,\n\nBut he'll remember with advantages\n\nWhat feats he did that day.\n\nThen shall our names,\n\nFamiliar in their mouths as household words,\n\nHarry the king,\n\nBedford and Exeter,\n\nWarwick and Talbot,\n\nSalisbury and Gloucester,\n\nBe in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.\n\nThis story shall the good man teach his son;\n\nAnd Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,\n\nFrom this day to the ending of the world,\n\nBut we in it shall be remember'd;\n\nWe few, we happy few, we band of brothers;\n\nFor he to-day that sheds his blood with me\n\nShall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,\n\nThis day shall gentle his condition:\n\nAnd gentlemen in England now a-bed\n\nShall think themselves accursed they were not here,\n\nAnd hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks"
