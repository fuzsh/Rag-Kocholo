        "text": "Kenneth Branagh has done it. Who is Kenneth Branagh? He's the young Belfast-born actor and director, best known here for his recent appearance in the ghastly ''Fortunes of War'' mini-series on television, who has transformed what initially seemed to be a lunatic dare into a genuine triumph. Mr. Branagh has made a fine, rousing new English film adaptation of Shakespeare's ''Henry V,'' a movie that need not apologize to Laurence Olivier's 1944 classic.\n\nThe Branagh version, opening today at the Paris Theater, is comparatively small. It's almost pocket-size, but it is big enough to encompass the emotional impact of the extraordinary text as acted by the mostly superlative actors.\n\nIn addition to Mr. Branagh, who plays the title role under his own direction, the cast includes Ian Holm as Fluellen, Brian Blessed as Exeter, Paul Scofield as the King of France, Judi Dench as Mistress Quickly, Derek Jacobi as the Chorus, Emma Thompson as Princess Katherine and Geraldine McEwan as her companion.\n\nSome comparisons between old and new cannot be avoided.\n\nThe Olivier film, produced at the height of World War II, when the British withdrawal from Dunkirk was still a bleeding wound, is a heroic spectacle, a celebration of monarchy as well as a reminder of Britain's place on the European Continent.\n\nThere was contemporary political point to its pagaentry and pomp, to its magnificent battle scenes and to its depiction of Henry's French enemies as representative of an effete society, no match for the staunch islanders who journeyed to France only to do their duty for king and country.\n\nOlivier's ''Henry V'' is a splendid film that is also splendid propaganda.\n\nThe Branagh ''Henry'' is something quite other. There is little pagaentry and less pomp. No fancy sets. The lighting is kept dim in the interiors and when the film moves outside, the skies are gray and air has the chill and damp of late fall, after the sun has lost its warmth.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
