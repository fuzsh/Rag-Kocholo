A 1989 British historical drama film written and directed by Kenneth Branagh in his feature directorial debut, based on William Shakespeare's history play of the same name.

Nominated for 3 Academy Awards, but only won for Costume.

Gritty adaption of William Shakespeare’s play about the English King’s bloody conquest of France. May pick for Shakespeare Movie Club.

One of the few plays with a Chorus, played by Derek Jacobi. Others are Romeo and Juliet and Henry VIII but Henry V is unique in the number of lines.
