        "text": "John Coltrane departed this mortal plane more than fifty years ago; today he remains among us, more alive than ever. His sound continues to grab the ears of an ever-widening circle of fans. His legend is stone solid: planted firmly in our culture as that of any 20th century musical giant. His saxophone sound—brooding, searching, dark—is still one of the most recognizable in modern jazz. His influence stretches over styles and genres, and transcends cultural boundaries. The modern ideal of music serving a deeply spiritual, connective purpose? A defining facet of John Coltrane.\n\nShe was born in Detroit, into a musical family – her half-brother Ernie Farrow became a noted jazz performer, and her sister Alice married John Coltrane and recorded many albums as a jazz keyboard player and harpist. Marilyn McLeod began working as a songwriter for the Jobete publishing company at Motown in 1968. She wrote songs with Johnny Bristol before being teamed with lyricist Pam Sawyer, and the pair co-wrote Diana Ross’s 1976 hit “Love Hangover”, and the High Inergy hit “You Can’t Turn Me Off (in the Middle of Turning Me On)” the following year. In 1982, she co-wrote Jermaine Jackson’s hit with Devo, “Let Me Tickle Your Fancy”, written with Sawyer, Jermaine Jackson, and Paul Jackson, Jr.. As a recording artist, she released some singles under her own name, and fronted the group Pure Magic.\n\nAfter nearly three decades (1968 thru 1995) of divine revelations, Swamini A.C. Turiyasangitananda received the divine directive to write this book.\n\nDivine Revelations contains some of her sacred meditations, divine visions and spiritual experiences associated with the Avatar of this Age, Sri Satya Sai Baba, concurrent with spiritual guidance and wisdom received directly from Lord Rama, and Lord Krishna.\n\nThis book is a comprehensive, chronological account of some of Swamini’s most sacred meditations, communications and experiences associated with the Supreme Lord. It contains trilogies, esoteric wisdom, poetic scriptural verses as well as detailed practical knowledge for the serious spiritual truth-seeker.\n\nJohn Coltrane was born on September 23, 1926 in Hamlet, NC. He grew up and learned to play saxophone in High Point, NC, graduating from William Penn High School at the age of 16 in 1943. While in high school, Coltrane’s musical influences were Lester Young and Johnny Hodges prompting him to switch to alto saxophone.\n\nHe left High Point shortly after graduation, moving to Philadelphia, PA where he began a study of the saxophone in earnest. After a stint in the Navy during World War II (he was part of the band) Coltrane met, performed and recorded with Dizzy Gillespie, Johnny Hodges, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk and other jazz legends. Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes in jazz and later was at the forefront of the free jazz movement.\n\nFujioka was in the audience at Village Vanguard, NYC during this recording night.\n\nWithout McCoy, no John Coltrane Classic Quartet in the ’60s. His left-handed comp was so powerful and amazing engine accompanied with Jimmy Garrison’s and Elvin Jones’s powers pushing Coltrane music ahead to create new horizon in jazz history. Fortunately, I had been meeting him many times over the world and one of them was in Nice Jazz, France, on July 22, 2009. He pointed me out (with left hand) in a press pit in front of bandstand and greeted.\n\nIn a career that spans five decades and includes collaborations with some of the most iconic figures in modern jazz, NEA and Grammy winner Jack DeJohnette has established an unchallenged reputation as one of the greatest drummers in the history of the genre. The list of creative associations throughout his career is lengthy and diverse: John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman, Sonny Rollins, Thelonious Monk, Bill Evans, Stan Getz, Keith Jarrett, Chet Baker, George Benson, Stanley Turrentine, Herbie Hancock, Dave Holland, Joe Henderson, Freddy Hubbard, Betty Carter and so many more. Along the way, he has developed a versatility that allows room for hard bop, R&B, world music, avant-garde, and just about every other style to emerge in the past half-century.\n\nPharoah Sanders possesses one of the most distinctive tenor saxophone sounds in jazz. Harmonically rich and heavy with overtones, Sanders’ sound can be as raw and abrasive as it is possible for a saxophonist to produce. Yet, Sanders is highly regarded to the point of reverence by a great many jazz fans. Although he made his name with expressionistic, nearly anarchic free jazz in John Coltrane’s late ensembles of the mid-’60s, Sanders’ later music is guided by more graceful concerns.\n\nFrom the time he first arrived in New York City in 1964, Cecil McBee has remained one of the most in-demand bassists in jazz, appearing on hundreds of influential recordings as well as in clubs and concert halls throughout the world. During this same span of five decades, McBee has also become a celebrated composer and teacher, leading his own ensembles and earning a distinguished professorship at the New England Conservatory in Boston, where he has taught for over 25 years. This unparalleled experience is now captured in two remarkable publications: a revolutionary course of instruction to the art of the doublebass and a collection of McBee’s own remarkable compositions, many of which have already joined the canon of jazz standards.\n\nBorn in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1935, McBee switched from clarinet to the upright bass at the age of 17 and quickly became a sought after voice on his instrument. Following his music studies at Ohio Central State University, the bassist spent two years in the army, conducting the band at Fort Knox. In 1959 he performed with Dinah Washington and moved to Detroit, where his engagement with Paul Winter’s ensemble in 1963–64 brought him eventually to his adopted home, New York City. Within two years McBee had recorded landmark sessions with such major figures as Wayne Shorter, Jackie McLean, Andrew Hill, and Sam Rivers, and held the bass chair in Charles Lloyd’s extraordinary quartet with Jack DeJohnette and Keith Jarrett.\n\nCarlos Santana is a long time supporter of The Coltrane Home and is the Chair of the Honorary board. Delivered with a level of passion and soul equal to the legendary sonic charge of his guitar, the sound of Carlos Santana is one of the world’s best-known musical signatures. For more than five decades-from Santana’s earliest days as a groundbreaking Afro-Latin-blues-rock fusion outfit in San Francisco-Carlos has been the visionary force behind artistry that transcends musical genres and generational, cultural and geographical boundaries.\n\nSri Swami Satchidananda was one of the great Yoga masters to bring the classical Yoga tradition to the West in the 1960s. He taught Yoga postures and meditation, and introduced students to a vegetarian diet and a more compassionate lifestyle. During this period of cultural awakening, iconic pop artist Peter Max and a small circle of his artist friends invited Swamiji to extend an intended two-day visit to New York City, so they could learn from him the secret of finding physical health, mental peace, and spiritual enlightenment.\n\nThree years later, he led some half a million American youth in chanting “OM,” when he delivered the official opening remarks at the 1969 Woodstock Music and Art Festival and became known as the “Woodstock Guru.”\n\nDespite a relatively brief career (he first came to notice as a sideman at age 29 in 1955, formally launched a solo career at 33 in 1960, and was dead at 40 in 1967), saxophonist John Coltrane was among the most important, and most controversial, figures in jazz. It seems amazing that his period of greatest activity was so short, not only because he recorded prolifically, but also because, taking advantage of his fame, the record companies that recorded him as a sideman in the 1950s frequently reissued those recordings under his name and there has been a wealth of posthumously released material as well. Since Coltrane was a protean player who changed his style radically over the course of his career, this has made for much confusion in his discography and in appreciations of his playing. There remains a critical divide between the adherents of his earlier, more conventional (if still highly imaginative) work and his later, more experimental work. No one, however, questions Coltrane’s almost religious commitment to jazz or doubts his significance in the history of the music.\n\nFollowing the path of its star musician John Coltrane, Impulse Records cut a creative swath through the 1960s and 1970s with the politically charged avant-garde jazz that defined the label’s musical and spiritual identity. The House That Trane Built tells the story of the label, balancing tales of individual passion, artistic vision, and commercial motivation. Weaving together research, dynamic album covers, session photographs, and nearly one hundred interviews with executives, journalists, producers, and musicians from Ray Charles and Alice Coltrane to Quincy Jones, Pharoah Sanders, McCoy Tyner, and others–this is the riveting tale of an era-shaping jazz label in the age of rock. The thirty-eight Album Profiles–a veritable book within a book–offer a consumer’s guide to the best and most timeless titles on Impulse.\n\nNate Chinen has been writing about jazz for more than 20 years.\n\nHe spent a dozen of them working as a critic for The New York Times, and helmed a long-running column for JazzTimes. As Director of Editorial Content at WBGO, Chinen works with the multiplatform program Jazz Night in America and contributes a range of coverage to NPR Music.\n\nHe is author of Playing Changes: Jazz For the New Century, published in hardcover by Pantheon in 2018, and on paperback by Vintage in 2019. Hailed as one of the Best Books of the Year by NPR, GQ, Billboard, and JazzTimes, it’s a chronicle of jazz in our time, and an argument for the music’s continuing relevance. It has also been published internationally, in Italian and Spanish editions."
