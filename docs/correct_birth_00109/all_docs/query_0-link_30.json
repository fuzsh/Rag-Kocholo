        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - Jazz Appreciation Month was celebrated across the United States in April, and nowhere was it more appropriate than here in North Carolina. That’s because John Coltrane, the most influential jazz artist in music history, was born and raised in North Carolina.\n\nDrive by a small, older, somewhat weathered house along Underhill Street in High Point, and if you listen closely enough you might hear the beginnings of the man who would become the most iconic jazz musician ever. It’s the home where John Coltrane was raised.\n\nColtrane was actually born in Hamlet, which is in Richmond County just east of Charlotte. But when he was about three or four months old his family moved to High Point where his grandfather was a prominent minister. They moved into the house on Underhill Street. At the time the area was a thriving African American community. The Coltrane family doctor lived next door and their dentist lived just down the street. The high school where Coltrane played in the band was just a block away.\n\nAccording to Phyllis Bridges, “This home is where a legend grew up.” Bridges is a community activist who wants to see the Coltrane home restored and says, “I think his childhood had a lot of impact on his music. He got to experience the different dynamics of the African American community here in High Point, from an area of poverty to the way all middle class, upper class African Americans right in his neighborhood.”\n\nOver the years, the home has gone through several owners and fallen into slight disrepair. It was eventually bought by the city of High Point. The home was given a local historical designation, and a historical marker was unveiled. But money to make necessary repairs and upgrades has been tight. Bridges is leading an effort to raise funds to renovate the house and eventually open it to the public. According to her, “This house is very sacred to me. Just the calmness I feel when I walk into this house. I can hear in my head some of my favorite Coltrane songs. And it’s just something peaceful about this house.”\n\nBridges has made it her mission to be a voice for the African American community and help preserve key landmarks in the city. “This community was part of his upbringing. And I believe that all of this plays into his music,” she says, adding, “And you have to really, even from a religious perspective, you know, his family was very religious. So music played a major part gospel music. And he brought all that into his sound that changed the sound of jazz.”\n\nShane Wheeler is a noted jazz musician here in North Carolina and recently had the chance to play his saxophone inside the Coltrane house in a room where Coltrane likely began playing himself. Wheeler was playing his original composition called ‘Omnipotent’. A piece heavily influenced by Coltrane’s music. He explained how he was drawn to Coltrane’s music at an early age, saying, “He drew me towards learning more about jazz and going to the UNC-Greensboro jazz program and getting a degree. And that was because I heard ‘A Love Supreme’ at 17. And I was like, you know, somebody can play sax like that!” ‘A Love Supreme’ was one of Coltrane’s finest works. The album was recorded in 1964. According to Wikipedia, “One critic has written that the album was intended to represent a struggle for purity, an expression of gratitude, and an acknowledgement that the musician’s talent comes from a higher power.” The article goes on to say, “‘A Love Supreme’ was categorized by Rockdelux as modal jazz, avant-garde jazz, free jazz, hard bop, and post-bop.”\n\nColtrane was only 40 years old when he died of liver cancer in 1967. But even though he died young, his improvisational style had a major impact on the world of jazz. And as exemplified in Wheeler, resonates to this day.\n\nWally West is an award-winning and critically acclaimed musician from North Carolina who was also influenced by Coltrane. He talks about Coltrane in an almost reverent fashion, explaining, “He had to strive for his best, and with the way that he sounded, and the way that he interpreted music, and he truly sounded like no one else, like years ahead of time.”\n\nColtrane left High Point when he graduated from high school. He moved to Philadelphia and later New York, to be closer to family and friends and a very vibrant jazz scene. One of his biggest influences, was the great jazz musician Charlie Parker. Coltrane joined the Navy in the mid-1940s and returned to Philadelphia after he was discharged. He later worked and played alongside some of the greatest names in jazz such as Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Earl Bostic and Thelonious Monk.\n\nWest says there is a richness to Coltrane’s music that can’t be explained, saying, “His incredible reverence to God with some personal issues that he had overcome, led to his recording of ‘A Love Supreme’ in 1964. My father, my late father, who never liked jazz, but appreciated it…I remember playing a recording of the first movement of that suite called ‘Acknowledgment’. And I didn’t say anything. I didn’t say who it was, I just thought here’s something I want you to listen to. And we finished listening to that and he said, ‘I feel like I just listened to someone praying.’ And that blew me away.”\n\n‘Naima’ is the song many music critics say is Coltrane’s greatest composition. It’s Wheeler’s favorite and he says he feels Coltrane’s essence when he plays it. “I know we were talking about ‘A Love Supreme’, I know that changed my course of jazz,” he says. “But ‘Naima’ was a song that latched on to me. And it’s like really simplistic, really like ringing in the atmosphere when you play it. Just like really, just everything speaks in the song.”\n\nIt’s impossible to fully grasp the impact and importance Coltrane’s work has had on the world of jazz. We just know he continues to influence musicians around the world. And to think, all that might not have ever happened had he not grown up here in North Carolina.\n\nThe organizers behind the fundraising for the Coltrane house say they’ve been told it will take a half million dollars to make the necessary renovations.\n\nTo make a donation towards the restoration of John Coltrane’s home, email Phyllis Bridges at yaaacm@gmail.com."
