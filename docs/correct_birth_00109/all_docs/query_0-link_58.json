        "text": "This webpage is based primarily on research by Dr. Lewis Porter as presented in his 1998 biography, John Coltrane: His Life and Music (Amazon.com link). I first read this book for a class I took during the Fall 2014 semester at the Southern California entitled \"Teaching Jazz History\" taught by Dr. Thom Mason. For one assignment, Dr. Mason had the students write a review of a jazz biography. I chose Dr. Porter's Coltrane biography, a book I had been wanting to read for years. I was enthralled from the first page 1, and upon finishing I had a 77-page document of notes complete with it's own index. Porter's thorough and meticulous biography features census records, interviews, transcriptions, harmonic analysis, and much, much, more. A small selection of my notes features every address that was mentioned (many more than the few presented here). Each time I read an address I hopped onto Google Maps and typed it in. I loved seeing the houses, streets, and environments that were part of Coltrane's everyday life, be it where he was born, began learning music, or lived when recording Giant Steps and A Love Supreme. Soon, I started creating the webpage you're looking at now. In August 2017 I finished my own selected John Coltrane discography of approximately 105 albums which can be filtered by album title, song titles, personnel, etc., and sorted by earliest recording session.\n\nJuly 2017 Update:\n\nBeginning May 2017, I participated in an exchange of emails with Dr. Porter and Yasuhiro Fujioka (another prodigious Coltrane research, author, collector, and more; Fujioka's blog here: http://blog.livedoor.jp/coltranehouse/ and interview here: YouTube: Chasing Trane - A Conversation with Yasuhiro Fujioka About John Coltrane), and Mr. Fujioka kindly offered additional information on the residences listed below (cited as \"Fujioka, 2017, Personal Comm.\"). The information from Mr. Fujioka has allowed me to update this page with more details about the residences and circumstances outlined. Ultimately, however, these documents contain far more information than I've elected to put on this webpage, including a few more homes than the eight identified here. Some of these places include another home in High Point, NC (213 Price Street), as well as a few hotels and, at least on one occasion, Paul Chamber's apartment (Fujioka, 2017, Personal Comm.).\n\nAdditionally, I recently purchased The Coltrane Reference (Amazon.com) by Chris DeVito, Yasuhiro Fujioka, Wolf Schmaler, Dave Wild, and Lewis Porter (ed). This 800+ page monograph is astounding. The Coltrane Reference is not only the most exacting and accurate account of Coltrane's life available, but it is also surely one of the finest examples of jazz research ever published. Any serious student of jazz history and/or research should be familiar with this book; all jazz fans should be grateful for the authors' meticulous research into Coltrane's life and for setting the bar for jazz research as high as Coltrane did for his music.I'm certain that if you enjoy any of the content here, you will enjoy the original works even more.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nTrane's parents, John Robert (J.R.) Coltrane (b. ca. 1901, d. 1/2/1939) and Alice Coltrane (nee Blair) (b. 3/22/1898, d. 9/1/1977), lived in an apartment at this location around 1925, just above what is now the \"Coltrane Blue Room\" (Porter, 1998 ,298). Trane's father worked as a tailor for the entirety of his short life, and Trane's mother identified her occupation as \"domestic\" on John Coltrane's birth certificate. Alice graduated from Livingstone College (a 45 min. drive southwest) in 1925, before moving into the apartment here with J.R. Coltrane. More is known about Trane's mother's family lineage than his father's. However, both Alice and J.R. were from religious families and both of Trane's grandfathers were A.M.E. Zion ministers. Trane's paternal side of the family seemed to have had little to do with Coltrane's upbringing unlike his mother's side.\n\nDocuments provided by Yashiro Fujioka, note that this building was preserved by Dr. Fred McQueen. These documents also state that Dr. McQueen mounted the plaque (pictured below) on this building. Additionally, a 1998 photo from Mr. Fujioka shows buildings immediately across Bridges Street, in the area that is now a park (Fujioka, 2017, Personal Comm.). I'm not sure when they were demolished, but knowing this helps paint a more accurate picture than the current google map view. It's also worth noting that Coltrane's paternal grandparents were living nearby, 540 Charlotte Street, in 1920.\n\nFor more information on this period of Coltrane's life, see Dr. Porter's biography, John Coltrane: His Life and Music (amazon link). Moreover, Fujioka and The Coltrane Reference alerted me to David Tegnell's thorough article on Coltrane's early years in North Carolina, \"Hamlet: John Coltrane's Origins\" in Jazz Perspective, November 2007, pp. 167-215, which is also worth reading for a more detailed picture of the years preceding Coltrane's birth (and includes a picture of the original building at this location on page 201). I also stumbled upon this \"Tour Diary\" from a band called \"il songo del mariano\" that features some stories about visiting this location in 2014. Read it here: http://www.hootpage.com/hoot_ilsognodelmarinaio-cantosecondotour2014diary.html.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nNote: Before moving here, the Coltrane family lived at another home nearby on 213 Price Street from about 1927-1929 (Fujioka).\n\nColtrane and his parents moved to High Point, NC, about two months after his birth. Trane's maternal grandfather was the leader of the St. Stephen AME Zion Church on Price Street. Today, the St. Stephen A.M.E. Zion church is on Leonard Street, and can be seen by clicking along Price Street and turning left; the church will be on the right side of the street, across from what is now the police station, but it was previously the elementary school that Trane attended.\n\nReverend Blair (Trane's maternal grandfather) was also involved in the creation of Leonard Elementary School (pictured below), a school for the black children of High Point, NC. Porter notes that Coltrane probably began school here in September 1932 (Porter, 1998, 15). Part of this school now houses the High Point Police Department which is directly behind the inital view of the Google map above (High Point Museum: http://highpointnc.pastperfectonline.com/bysearchterm?keyword=Leonard+Street+School).\n\nJuly 2017 update:\n\nDavid Tegnell's article, \"Hamlet: John Coltrane's Origins\" in Jazz Perspective (November 2007, pp. 167-215), notes on page 204 that this exact photo shows not only Leonard Street School (the elementary school Coltrane attended), but also the \"St. Stephen A.M.E. Zion Church (built in 1928) and the house at 213 Price St., John Coltrane's first home in High Point.\" Further, Tegnell notes on (pp. 205 - 206) that John Coltrane's father, J.R. Coltrane, was an amateur musician who was well-liked. However, J.R. Coltrane, as mentioned above, does not appear to have been as integral a part of the Coltrane family. That role belonged to Coltrane's maternal grandfather (Porter, 1998, 11; Tegnell, 2007, 206).\n\nOn Coltrane's service with the Navy: August 6, 1945 - August 11, 1946\n\nColtrane was inducted into the U.S. Navy just over a month before his 20th birthday, on Monday, August 6, 1945. This was late into WWII (and happened to be the same day of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima [wiki]). He was discharged about one year later, on August 11, 1946.\n\nDuring his tenure with the Navy, Coltrane was stationed in upstate New York for a few months, but was otherwise stationed at the Island of Oahu, Hawaii by November 28, 1945 (Fujioka, 2012, english translation PDF, 2, URL). In the Navy, Coltrane was a member of a pickup band (Note: NOT a U.S. \"Navy Band\") known as \"The Melody Masters\" which played various gigs around the island (The Coltrane Reference, paperback ed.: DeVito, et. al, 2013, 12).\n\nIt was in the Navy, in Hawaii, that Coltrane made his earliest confirmed recordings (DeVito, et. al, 2012, 10). The Coltrane Reference, page 367, notes that this recording session occurred on July 13, 1946 at the Armed Forces radio station on the island of Oahu, Territory of Hawaii. The other musicians were Navy men, Dexter Culbertson (tp), Norman Poulshock (p), Willie Stader (b), Joe Theimer (dr), and Benny Thomas (voc).\n\nPorter's biography features an engaging read on his time in the Navy and how it impacted Coltrane's musical development. Porter includes transcriptions analysis of two Coltrane solos from the recordings from this session. These early recordings are now available for purchase on this Rare Live Recordings release, First giant steps (Amazon.com link):\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nTrane, Naima, and Syeeda moved into this house on December 23, 1959. Fujioka notes that Coltrane was purchased this home with an advance from Atlantic records (Fujioka, 2017, Personal Comm.).\n\nSlide Hampton lived nearby at 245 Carlton Avenue in Brooklyn (Porter, 1998, 140). Porter notes that it was a \"huge brownstone\" that Hampton rented out. Hampton's other tenants included Freddie Hubbard, Wes Montgomery, Larry Ridey, Eric Dolphy, and the painter Prophet (Prohet created cover art on some of Dolphy's albums). Dolphy has a piece titled \"245\" dedicated to the house.\n\nColtrane moved out in the summer of 1963 and was soon living with Alice Coltrane (Porter, 270). Trane also lived at the Schuyler Hotel, 57 West 45th Street, New York, NY, prior to purchasing the Dix Hills home below (Fujioka, 2017, Personal Comm., and DeVito, et al. 2013, 301). The John Coltrane Reference notes that Coltrane sold this house to Naima for $10 on June 1, 1965 (DeVito, et. al, 2013, 323). Coltrane divorced Naima and married Alice on the same day, June 1, 1965, in Juarez, Mexico in August 1966. (DeVito, et. al, 2013, 323, and Porter, 1998, 272)\n\nSteve Reid talks about visiting Coltrane at this home in this 2007 article (AllAboutJazz.com) by Ian Patterson .\n\nTrane, Alice, and Alice's daughter Michelle (from Alice's previous marriage) moved here on July 6, 1964.\n\nThis is the home in which Coltrane composed the music for A Love Supreme. In an interview on KCRW, John Scheinfled, the director of the 2017 documentary Chasing Trane, noted that Alice Coltrane said when Trane finished composing the music for A Love Supreme he walked down the stairs from his music room on the second floor as though he was \"Moses coming down from the Mountain\" (KCRW, 2017; listen to the interview here: https://www.kcrw.com/music/shows/tom-schnabels-rhythm-planet/chasing-trane). You can see this room in one of Fujioka's photos on his blog here: http://blog.livedoor.jp/coltranehouse/archives/2012-10.html\n\nEach of Trane's children with Alice were born here: John W. Coltrane Jr. (Aug. 26, 1964 - 1982), Ravi John Coltrane (b. August 06, 1965), and Oranyan (Oran) Olabisi Coltrane (b. March 19, 1967). Coltrane died on July 17, 1967. Alice, Michelle, John Jr., Ravi, and Oran continued to lived here for aother five years after Trane's passing.\n\nToday:\n\nThe house was purchased in 2004 by the Huntington Society to save it from demolition, an effort spearheaded by Steve Fulgoni in the early 2000s (read about here: https://www.thecoltranehome.org/test-page/). Recently, this home has been the subject of a massive effort by many people in order to preserve it and provide community outreach. The \"Coltrane Home\" is now a 501(c)3 Non-Profit Organization. Read about the Coltrane Home at their website (https://www.thecoltranehome.org/) and like their (Facebook page).\n\nI created and animated this YouTube video during the 2015 summer. It combines the prose of Coltrane's poem A Love Supreme with the recording of \"Psalm.\""
