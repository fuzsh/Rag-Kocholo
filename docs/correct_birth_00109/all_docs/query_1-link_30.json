        "text": "(1926–67). Unending restlessness marked the career of John Coltrane, the jazz tenor saxophonist who began by playing bebop and ended by playing free jazz. A passionate player, he aroused strong audience responses and became the most imitated of modern jazz musicians.\n\nJohn William Coltrane was born on Sept. 23, 1926, in Hamlet, N.C. He grew up in a musical family in High Point, N.C., and began playing clarinet when he was 12 and alto saxophone a year later. After high school he studied at Philadelphia music schools and then played for two years in a United States Navy band. It was while touring with blues bands that he began playing tenor saxophone. He also played in jazz bands, including those of Dizzy Gillespie and Johnny Hodges, though he did not become famous as a soloist until he joined the Miles Davis Quintet in 1955.\n\nWith the 1957 Thelonious Monk quartet, Coltrane became a virtuoso player; his fast, many-noted phrases were called “sheets of sound.” He rejoined Miles Davis, with whom he began playing modal jazz. In 1959 he left Davis again, recorded his own masterpiece, Giant Steps, and then underwent extensive dental surgery. In 1960 he studied with Ornette Coleman and formed his own quartet, which included pianist McCoy Tyner and drummer Elvin Jones.\n\nColtrane’s long, fervent solos in advanced harmonies quickly made his quartet controversial. He created works such as Alabama to reflect his support of the black civil rights movement. He also played music based on religious themes; most important was A Love Supreme.\n\nEventually he adopted the techniques of free jazz himself; his wife, Alice McLeod Coltrane, became his quartet’s pianist. After a strenuous schedule of touring and performing for many years, his health began to fail. He died of liver disease on July 17, 1967.\n\nJohn Litweiler"
