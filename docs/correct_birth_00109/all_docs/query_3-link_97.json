Please come down and join us!\n\nwww.johncoltrane.com\n\nMerely mention the name John Coltrane and you're likely to evoke a deeply emotional, often spiritual response from even the most casual jazz fan.\n\nBorn September 23, 1926 in Hamlet, North Carolina, John Coltrane was always surrounded by music. His father played several instruments sparking Coltrane's study of E-flat horn and clarinet. While in high school, Coltrane's musical influences shifted to the likes of Lester Young and Johnny Hodges prompting him to switch to alto saxophone. He continued his musical training in Philadelphia at Granoff Studios and the Ornstein School of Music. He was called to military service during WWII, where he performed in the U.S. Navy Band in Hawaii.\n\nAfter the war, Coltrane began playing tenor saxophone with the Eddie \"Cleanhead\" Vinson Band, and was later quoted as saying, \"A wider area of listening opened up for me. There were many things that people like Hawk, and Ben and Tab Smith were doing in the '40's that I didn't understand, but that I felt emotionally.\" Prior to joining the Dizzy Gillespie band, Coltrane performed with Jimmy Heath where his passion for experimentation began to take shape. However, it was his work with the Miles Davis Quintet in 1958 that would lead to his own musical evolution. \"Miles' music gave me plenty of freedom,\" he once said. During that period, he became known for using the three-on-one chord approach, and what has been called the 'sheets of sound,' a method of playing multiple notes at one time.\n\nBy 1960 Coltrane had formed his own quartet which included pianist McCoy Tyner, drummer Elvin Jones, and bassist Jimmy Garrison. Eventually adding players like Eric Dolphy, and Pharoah Sanders. The John Coltrane Quartet created some of the most innovative and expressive music in Jazz history including the hit albums: My Favorite Things, Africa Brass, Impressions, Giant Steps, and his monumental work A Love Supreme which attests to the power, glory, love, and greatness of God. Coltrane felt we must all make a conscious effort to effect positive change in the world, and that his music was an instrument to create positive thought patterns in the minds of people.\n\nIn 1967, liver disease took Coltrane's life leaving many to wonder what might have been. Yet thirty-seven years after his departure his music can be heard in motion pictures, on television and radio. Recent film projects that have made references to Coltrane's artistry in dialogue or musical compositions include, Mr. Holland's Opus, The General's Daughter, Malcolm X, Mo Better Blues, Jerry McGuire, White Night, The Last Graduation, Come Unto Thee, Eyes On The Prize II and Four Little Girls. Also, popular television series such as \"NYPD Blue\", \"The Cosby Show\", \"Day's Of Our Lives\", \"Crime Stories\" and \"ER\", have also relied on the beautiful melodies of this distinguished saxophonist.\n\nIn 1972, A Love Supreme was certified gold by the RIAA for exceeding 500,000 units in Japan. This jazz classic and the classic album My Favorite Things were certified gold in the United States in 2001.\n\nIn 1982, the RIAA posthumously awarded John Coltrane a Grammy Award of \" Best Jazz Solo Performance\" for the work on his album, Bye Bye Blackbird. In 1997 he received the organizations highest honor, the Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nOn June 18, 1993, Mrs. Alice Coltrane received an invitation to The White House from former President and Mrs. Clinton, in appreciation of John Coltrane's historical appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival.\n\nIn 1995, John Coltrane was honored by the United States Postal Service with a commemorative postage stamp. Issued as part of the musicians and composers series, this collectors item remains in circulation.\n\nIn 1999, Universal Studios and its recording division MCA Records recognized John Coltrane's influence on cinema by naming a street on the Universal Studios lot in his honor.\n\nIn 2001, The NEA and the RIAA released 360 Songs of the Century. Among them was John Coltrane's \"My Favorite Things.\"\n\nThese concerts are supported in part by The New York State Music Fund, established by the NYS Attorney General at Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, The New York State Council on the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Arts."
