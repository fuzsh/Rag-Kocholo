        "text": "North Carolina\n\nJohn Coltrane was born today, September 23, 1926, in Hamlet, N.C. He grew up in High Point, N.C. I passed through the city once looking to buy some furniture. A few locals mentioned that John Coltrane had been born in their city. It felt like he was still there, alive and living the way they spoke about him.\n\nJohn Coltrane would see much of the world in his travels. Like Malcolm X, Medgar Evers, and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., John Coltrane would not survive the 1960s. He died in 1967. He was doing work. Human work. The work of a sage, an artist trying to leave behind a roadmap for people that might guide them through trouble and enhance the good in them.\n\nWashington D.C. 1992 (Love Supreme)"
