        "text": "John William Coltrane emerged as one of the most innovative and influential Jazz musician in the 20th century. Born in Hamlet, North Carolina on September 23, 1926, his family church shaped the spiritual dimension of his musical orientation. Soon after his fathers passing, Coltrane and his mother moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1943 to ensure he would have a proper education.\n\nDuring the 1940s and ‘50s, Coltrane developed his craft as a saxophonist and composer, working with famous musicians/bandleaders Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington and Miles Davis. Coltrane’s music took an increasingly spiritual dimension. He remains one of the most influential saxophonists in music history.\n\nColtrane made connection between music and mathematic using geometric drawings. The visual experiment is believed to have been created by Coltrane during period when he undertook an in-depth study of Indian music along with a study of some of the theories of albert Einstein. The circle, which may be said t resemble a clock, incorporates some of the Coltrane’s theoretical innovations into a well-known musical scheme."
