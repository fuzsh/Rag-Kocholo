HIGH POINT, N.C. -- A North Carolina musician's passion continues to inspire great music at an annual Labor Day music festival that bears his name.

John Coltrane was born in Hamlet, North Carolina in 1926, and later moved to High Point. He attended high school at what's now the Penn-Griffin School for the Arts, where he learned to play the alto saxophone.

The Coltrane Jazz Fest celebrates his innovative contributions to the art of music.

Mention Coltrane's name and you're likely to strike a chord with even the most casual jazz fan.

"I love Kenny G, John Coltrane and Boney James,â said Gaynell Ellerbe, who lives in High Point. âI'm just a fan of jazz because it's very inspirational."

This festival is a chance for fans to check out up-and-comers as well as hear some of the genres' biggest names.

Saturday's headliner was Grammy-nominated jazz vocalist Gregory Porter. Sunday, Grammy winner and jazz icon Kenny G took the stage. Those big names attract thousands of fans.

"It's our biggest in terms of ticket sales so far,â said event organizer Patrick Harman. âWe sold north of 6,000 this year."

Organizers say the sixth year is the biggest and best ever, catching the attention of music lovers near and far.

"The cool thing about the Coltrane Festival is that we have people from 25, 26 states that come from all over to High Point,â Harman said.

Thousands share a love of Coltrane'sÂ sound and his hometown, and keeping both alive and thriving.

"It's my first time coming out, and I actually volunteered this year for the festival,â Ellerbe said. âIt's a great opportunity to be involved with the community."

Nonprofit "The Friends of John Coltrane, Inc.â has been organizing the festival since 2009.
