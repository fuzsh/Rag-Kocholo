Bio

John Coltrane was born in Hamlet, North Carolina in 1926. He only lived in North Carolina for a few years. After his grandparents and father died within a few months of each other, he relocated with his mother to Philadelphia. John Coltrane began his illustrious career in the 1950’s with two high list associations; Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk. Coltrane played with Miles Davis’ band until around 1960, when he began to lead more and more dates as a leader. In 1962, Coltrane formed the classic ‘Coltrane Quartet’ consisting of McCoy Tyner (piano), Elvin Jones (drums), and Jimmy Garrison (bass). The conception of this group also coincides with Coltrane’s music taking on a more and more spiritual angle. This group recorded some of Coltrane's most famous and encompassing works such as ‘A Love Supreme’. After the classic quartet disbanded, Coltrane pushed further and further outwards, testing the boundaries of improvised music. He would add another saxophonist, Pharoh Sanders, and also frequently collaborated with his second wife, Alice Coltrane.
