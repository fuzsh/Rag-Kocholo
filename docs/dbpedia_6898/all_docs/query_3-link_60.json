        "text": "Norman Borlaug was known as the “Father of the Green Revolution” thanks to his innovative efforts to produce high-yielding wheat plants. After graduating from the University of Minnesota in 1942, he began paving the way for new agricultural methods that would increase the amount of product from each plant while effectively prolonging the growing season. Borlaug’s efforts began in Mexico and were so successful in helping bring food security to the area that he then began helping India and Pakistan. Borlaug is credited with saving “a billion lives” that would have been lost due to starvation in these countries and he received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts."
