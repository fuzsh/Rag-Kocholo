        "text": "On March 25, 2019, the World Food Prize organization is promoting stories about “How Norm Inspired Me.” Check this site for details, and note that the hashtag #RememberingBorlaug is being used to gather information and post insights.\n\nNorman Borlaug was widely known as the “Father of the Green Revolution” and “The Man Who Fed the World” for his pioneering work developing high-yielding wheat for areas with limited cultivated land and increasing population. At the time of his death in 2009, Dr. Borlaug was one of only five people in history to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Congressional Gold Medal (an honor shared by Nelson Mandela, Elie Wiesel, Mother Teresa, and Martin Luther King, Jr.).\n\nDr. Borlaug devoted his life to ensuring food security for what he termed “the forgotten world,” mostly developing nations, where “most of the people, comprising more than 50% of the total world population, live in poverty, with hunger as a constant companion.”\n\nDr. Borlaug was a lifelong promoter and advocate for the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST), beginning at its founding in 1972. He was the featured speaker at the CAST–Industry Conference, held in January 1973, at which CAST was introduced to the agribusiness community. His remarks at the conference—later published as CAST Paper #1—helped establish the new organization and set the tone for its mission and impact."
