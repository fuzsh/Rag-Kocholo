        "text": "Editor's note: Part of this story by Register reporters Jerry Perkins and Tom Longden originally ran on Sept. 13, 2009, the day after Iowa-born scientist Norman Borlaug, the \"Father of the Green Revolution,\" died.\n\nNorman Borlaug's scientific mind and hard work saved millions of people around the world from starvation. Many say that no single person did as much as the Cresco native to alleviate hunger.\n\nHe won the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, which continued until his death on Sept. 12, 2009 from complications of cancer.\n\nA self-described “corn-fed, country-bred Iowa boy,” Borlaug was called “the Father of the Green Revolution” for his work developing high-yielding strains of wheat that were credited with staving off the starvation of millions of people in Pakistan and India in the 1960s.\n\nIt has been said that Borlaug saved more lives than any other person in history, said Kenneth Quinn, president of the World Food Prize Foundation, which Borlaug founded in 1986.\n\nAt the time of his death Borlaug was one of just five people to have won the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. The others: the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa, Elie Wiesel and Nelson Mandela.\n\n“Thanks to Dr. Borlaug’s pioneering work to develop varieties of high-yielding wheat, countless millions of men, women and children, who will never know his name, will never go to bed hungry,” former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said in 2007 when Borlaug received the Congressional Gold Medal.\n\n“Dr. Borlaug’s scientific breakthroughs have eased needless suffering and saved countless lives (and) have been an inspiration to new generations across the globe who have taken up the fight against hunger.”\n\nBorlaug had suffered from lymphoma and other ailments that had caused him to be in and out of the hospital in recent years, Quinn said.\n\nYet Borlaug maintained an ambitious travel schedule into his 90s, continuing to teach at Texas A&M and work for the International Center for the Improvement of Wheat and Maize, where he did his breeding work that led to the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nHe also spoke out for an equitable distribution of the world’s food and the threat of unchecked population growth. He supported using agricultural biotechnology to combat global hunger and malnutrition and frequently criticized environmentalists he derisively called “greenies.”\n\n“I feel obligated as a scientist to speak out,” he told The Des Moines Register in 1997. “They can’t hurt me now. They can’t fire me; I’m too old. But if some young scientist said what I’ve just said, they’d fire him.”\n\nIowa farm boy found his mission in Mexico\n\nNorman Ernest Borlaug was born in 1914 on his grandparents’ farm 11 miles southwest of Cresco.\n\nThe son of Henry O. and Clara Borlaug, he had two sisters, Palma and Charlotte. When he was 8, the Borlaugs moved to their own 56-acre farm near the Norwegian community of Saude in northeast Chickasaw County — a town that no longer exists.\n\nBorlaug attended a one-room school near his farm home, with one teacher instructing him through the eighth grade.\n\nBorlaug attended Cresco High School, graduating in 1932. He went to the University of Minnesota, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in forestry in 1937. At Minnesota, he met his future wife, Margaret Gibson, a native of Oklahoma.\n\nAfter working in Idaho and Massachusetts on forestry projects, he returned to the university and earned his doctorate in 1941 in plant pathology.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1944, Borlaug was a plant pathologist for DuPont in Wilmington, Del. But in October 1944, he went to Mexico to work at the Rockefeller Foundation’s International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center.\n\nThere, Borlaug worked on developing wheat with a sturdy, short stalk that could hold the high-yielding grain on top. He also built resistance to a fungal disease called “wheat stem rust” into the “miracle wheat.”\n\nAfter Borlaug developed his miracle wheat, Mexico became a wheat exporter and, in the 1960s, the wheat was sent to India and Pakistan, which used the grain to feed their starving populations.\n\nOther nations in Asia, South America, Africa and the Middle East also adopted miracle wheat to feed their people.\n\nBorlaug’s success earned him a new nickname: “the apostle of wheat.”\n\nWhen it was announced in 1970 that Borlaug had won the Nobel Peace Prize, he was working in experimental fields 50 miles from Mexico City.\n\nAt first, Borlaug thought the report that he had won the Nobel was a joke, and he had to be persuaded to return to the city for a news conference. When he arrived, he was wearing his work clothes, with dust on his shoes and dirt on his hands.\n\n“I wanted to show the TV men what makes an agricultural scientist — dirty hands,” he said. “I washed them later.”\n\nJoking aside, Borlaug explained what excited him most about winning the Nobel Prize.\n\n“Seventy percent of the people of the world make their living from agriculture,” he said, “and this is the first time agricultural science and the application of it have been given recognition.”\n\nBorlaug was presented the Nobel Peace Prize on Dec.10, 1970, in Oslo, Norway, the land of his ancestors. He received a gold medal and $74,112 to continue his work.\n\nTen days after receiving his Nobel, Borlaug arrived in Cresco on a bitterly cold winter’s day. When more than 200 friends gathered for a luncheon at the First Lutheran Church, Borlaug reminded them: “In Iowa, we live in a privileged world. We take the prayer 'Give us our daily bread’ as automatic and always so.\n\n“But it isn’t for half of the people of the world who go hungry several times a week.”\n\nIn 1971, Cresco dedicated a 12-foot statue of its native son.\n\nHis work continues in Africa, elsewhere\n\nBorlaug and former President Jimmy Carter, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, started working with the Sasakawa Africa Association in 1986 to take the Green Revolution to that continent.\n\nMuch of their work focused on increasing the quantity and quality of corn, or maize, in Africa because it is widely used as food there.\n\n“The passion that drives Dr. Borlaug’s life is an inspiration for all of us to follow,” Carter said in 2007. “It has been an honor to collaborate with Dr. Borlaug.”\n\nBorlaug pushed the production and commercialization of a type of corn known as Quality Protein Maize, which has a better mix of amino acids than conventional corn and almost as much nutritional value as milk.\n\nBorlaug’s legacy, he said in 2004, will be the hundreds of young plant scientists from all over the globe he taught at the international wheat and corn center in Mexico. Those scientists learned to use the new strains of high-yielding crops with high-production techniques and agronomic practices to boost food production.\n\nIn addition, the Borlaug Fellowship Program, which is run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, annually brings foreign agricultural scientists to the United States, matching them with top American crop scientists at places like Iowa State University.\n\nBorlaug-Ruan internships sponsored by the World Food Prize Foundation were established to provide all-expenses-paid, eight-week internships at international agricultural research centers worldwide.\n\nIn one of his last interviews with The Des Moines Register, Borlaug summed up the problems that he saw facing the world today: “Population growth has to be slowed, and that’s a never-ending job. Energy scarcity will continue to be a problem. And people need to realize that political instability in other countries affects us here in the United States,” he said.\n\nIn October 2007, Borlaug attended his last World Food Prize symposium, which bears his name.\n\n“I can’t be despondent, I have to be optimistic,” he said. “Pessimism has no place in action.”\n\nBorlaug’s wife of 70 years, Margaret, died in March 2007. The couple had two children, William and Jeanie Laube."
