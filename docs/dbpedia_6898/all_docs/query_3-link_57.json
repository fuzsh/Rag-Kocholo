        "text": "GREENWICH, N.Y. — Norman Borlaug is often remembered as the “the man who saved millions of lives.” Yet, outside of the world of agriculture he is sometimes called “the most important person you’ve never heard of.” Read on to learn about the research and legacy of Norman Borlaug.\n\nNorman Ernest Borlaug was born March 25, 1914 to parents Henry and Clara in the hamlet of Saude, Iowa. The descendants of Norwegian immigrants, the Borlaugs operated a small subsistence farm. From a young age Norman was involved with farm chores. Often working with his grandfather, Nels Borlaug, Norman learned to pull weeds, feed chickens, and collect eggs. When he was eight, Norman’s father purchased land adjacent to his grandparents’ farm and in the following years his roles on the farm grew to include working with draft animals, milking cows, and other farm duties.\n\nFrom the start Borlaug expressed an interest in knowing how things worked and he attended the one-room schoolhouse New Oregon #8 until eighth grade. A maxim of his grandfather’s that stuck with Norman was, “It is better to fill your head now, if you want to fill your belly later.” Norman thought eighth grade may be the end of his schooling, but sensing that he had a passion for learning his grandfather and teacher (who also happened to be his cousin Sina Borlaug) encouraged him to attend high school. While it took his parents some convincing since Norman would have been expected to help on the farm, he was allowed to attend high school in the county seat in Cresco.\n\nCresco was 12 miles from the Borlaug farm, so Norman lived with a family in town during the school week and returned home on the weekends. He was a diligent student and an excellent athlete playing football and wrestling. During these years Borlaug was greatly influenced by two teachers: his vocational agriculture teacher Harry Schroder and wrestling coach Dave Bartelma. Schroder opened his eyes to newer farming ideas like the use of hybrid seeds and fertilizers, and Bartelma instilled in him a tenacity and a drive to always do his best.\n\nAfter graduating high school Borlaug was unsure about his future, but encouragement from his family again prompted him to pursue a university education. After working to save up money he eventually attended the University of Minnesota. His college career got off to a rocky start as he failed the school’s entrance exam, but he was eventually admitted and earned a degree in forestry in 1937. He also married his wife, Margaret, shortly after graduating.\n\nBorlaug had a job as a forest ranger for the U.S. Forest Service arranged after graduating, however shortly before he was to start budget cuts eliminated his position and he was left without the job. Again unsure of what to do with his future, he turned to education and he was able to get a temporary job under University of Minnesota plant pathology professor Elvin Stakman. Much of Stakman’s work involved combating the plant disease wheat rust. Borlaug became increasingly interested in his work and its potential to alleviate hunger, and he joined the program earning a doctorate in plant pathology in 1942.\n\nHaving grown up in the Great Depression Borlaug experienced hardship and saw others experience it. In college he also saw many jobless and malnourished men and women, and was once caught up in a riot amongst dairy workers while at school. These experiences stuck with him and impressed in him what hunger can do to people. They also instilled in him a desire to do something about it.\n\nDuring World War II Borlaug worked for a chemical company called Dupont de Nemours in Delaware working to improve war-related items. However, his former boss Elvin Stakman approached him with a new opportunity in 1944 that would change his life.\n\nIn the early 1940s Mexico had undergone major land reforms. At the same time its agricultural crops had been greatly damaged by rust causing crop failures and poverty. The Rockefeller Foundation in partnership with the Mexican government enlisted Elvin Stakman to develop a rust-resistant variety of wheat to help the country’s precarious food situation. To help, Stakman, along with program director George Harrar, recruited Borlaug to join the team which he did.\n\nThe project was based in El Batátan, Texcoco, Mexico near Mexico City. Upon arriving Borlaug was struck by the poverty and outdated agricultural practices that were still being used at the time. Nevertheless, he set to work crossing wheat varieties to breed a disease-resistant variety that would grow well in the Mexican soil. He also slowly settled he and his family into the local community making relationships, enlisting the help of locals with the project’s work, and attempting to learn Spanish.\n\nAfter some initial improvements Borlaug came up with an idea to grow his wheat in two growing seasons. The research was based in the central highlands of Mexico, however wheat growing in the northern Yaqui Valley happened later in the year. By expanding research into this area and using the same seeds in both locations, he could test the wheat in two areas with different features as well as increase output. The idea was not received well which almost caused Borlaug to leave the project, before intervention from Stakman approved it. By implementing this process that came to be called “shuttle breeding” Borlaug was able to diversify the research on his seeds by accounting for a wider range of factors such as altitude, sunlight, temperatures, and rainfall.\n\nBy the early 1950s Borlaug and his team had created wheat strains that were wheat rust resistant and had larger grain heads. Mexican wheat output was increasing. But this success brought a setback: the tall, thin stalks of his varieties often collapsed under the weight of the larger grain or broke more easily in inclement weather. To alleviate this problem he began crossing his varieties with Japanese dwarf-wheat which had a smaller, sturdier stalk. This addition proved to be the winning formula. Mexican farmers’ output and income increased, and in 1956 Mexico was deemed self-sufficient thanks to the “miracle wheat” varieties.\n\nThe agricultural problems and threat of starvation that Mexico faced were shared by other developing countries at that time. After World War II the world saw a population increase and there were fears by some leaders that populations would outpace food production leading to widespread famine in places. Borlaug’s wheat was a game-changer in alleviating this major problem since it was disease resistant and produced higher yields. Using Borlaug’s techniques researchers bred higher yielding rice which helped stave off famine too. To continue work in this field the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) was founded in 1966 to continue research, share findings around the world, and train scientists in the field.\n\nIn the mid-1960s the Indian subcontinent was facing starvation and because of the success of the wheat in Mexico, Borlaug and his team were called on to test their findings in the region. India and Pakistan were on the brink of war and the hunger crisis was exacerbating hostilities. Borlaug was met with suspicion by both Pakistani and Indian leaders as he later recalled, “Someone asked me: What was the toughest wrestling match you were ever in? I told him meeting with the President of Pakistan when they were starving and again a little bit later with the prime minister of India.” Borlaug and agriculture officials in both countries were able to win leadership over though and Borlaug’s wheat was put into cultivation. By the mid-1970s production increased fourfold in both nations and the threat of wide starvation had subsided.\n\nThrough the end of the 1960s Borlaug’s wheat and other crops had been introduced in Middle Eastern countries with similar results. For the technologies he helped create and the prevention of hunger they resulted in Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. He fittingly was out working in a remote field when word reached the Borlaug household that he would receive the award and his wife had to go find him and tell him. In his acceptance speech Borlaug diffused the honor amongst his many colleagues in the field and also encouraged continual work in alleviating hunger saying, “It is true that the tide of the battle against hunger has changed for the better during the past three years. But tides have a way of flowing and then ebbing again. We may be at high tide now, but ebb tide could soon set in if we become complacent and relax our efforts…” Borlaug was the first person from the field of agriculture to win the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe development and spread of crop varieties developed by Borlaug are considered to be the start of the Green Revolution. This term refers to the production of high-producing yields and changes to agricultural practices such as increased use of machinery and farm inputs which took place in the second half of the 20th century. The results of the Green Revolution were dramatic. For instance, in Asia rice production doubled and wheat production quadrupled from 1960-1990. While there have been criticisms about the Green Revolution through the years such as its environmental impact, decrease in biodiversity of crops, and sustainability concerns, it did increase food production and is credited with saving millions of lives from famine in the mid- and late-20th century.\n\nBorlaug remained active in research and the improvement of food security around the world after winning the Nobel Prize and into his old age. In the 1980s Borlaug turned his attention to improving agriculture in Africa. Joining forces with former president Jimmy Carter and his Carter Foundation and Japanese industrialist Roichi Sasakawa, Borlaug helped operate the Sasakawa Africa Association which fought hunger and malnutrition on the African continent by introducing science-based crop production methods. A major output by this project has been the development of Quality Protein Maize. Borlaug also established the World Food Prize in 1986 which recognizes and individual who has made a significant impact in improving the world’s food supply each year.\n\nNorman Borlaug passed away in 2009 at the age of 95. According to his daughter his last words were about African farmers as he considered his work in Africa unfinished at the time of his death. The impact of Borlaug’s research and accomplishments continue to be felt today in the way crops are produced and how large-scale food systems operate. His life and contributions continue to be drawn on as scientists and farmers work to ensure food security today."
