        "text": "Trespass\n\nTheatrical Release Poster\n\nCountry United States Directed by Walter Hill Release Date 1992 Language English Studio Universal Pictures Distributor Universal Pictures\n\nMain Cast Character Actor Vince Bill Paxton King James Ice-T Don William Sadler Savon Ice Cube Raymond Bruce A. Young\n\nTrespass is a 1992 thriller directed by Walter Hill and stars Bill Paxton and William Sadler as Vince and Don, two firefighters who come across a map to a stash of gold that was stolen in the 1940s. Things become complicated, however, when they witness a gangland execution by a group of drug dealers led by King James (Ice-T) and his right-hand man Savon (Ice Cube), which leads to a hostage situation and a stand-off. Not to be confused with the 2011 heist thriller starring Nicolas Cage.\n\nThe following weapons were used in the film Trespass (1992):\n\nHandguns\n\nUnknown long-slide 1911 variant\n\nDuring the trek into East St. Louis to search for gold, Don (William Sadler) takes along an M1911-type pistol which has a long 7\" slide/barrel. This gun is also used frequently by Vince (Bill Paxton) in several scenes. It is not clear exactly what type of 1911 this is; it looks somewhat like an AMT Hardballer, but the Hardballer was only ever offered with a stainless finish, whereas the gun in the movie has a regular blued finish. It is possible that the movie's armorer had a Hardballer slide and frame re-finished and modified for the movie to look like an older 1911 (which would explain why the gun's slide release retains a stainless finish). It may also be a regular Colt 1911 frame fitted with the re-finished Hardballer long slide and barrel.\n\nThe 1911 from this movie appears to have been later re-used in Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot.\n\nColt Detective Special\n\nEarly in the film, when Vince (Bill Paxton) and Don (William Sadler) are putting out a fire in a burning building in Arkansas, they run into an old man named Eugene DeLong (Hal Landon Jr.) who holds a Colt Detective Special on them briefly before giving them a map to the gold he stole from a Catholic Church in 1940. Later in the film, the drug dealer Wickey (Stoney Jackson) can also be seen using a Colt Detective Special as his weapon-of-choice. When the drug dealers bring in a cache of heavier weapons, he rejects the opportunity to re-arm with an AR-15, saying that he \"don't need no big-ass gun\". He then takes out his Colt Detective Special, which prompts the other gangsters to mock him.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 686\n\nKing James (Ice-T) carries a snub-nose Smith & Wesson Model 686 with ivory grips as his sidearm throughout the movie. Later, this weapon is taken by Bradlee (Art Evans).\n\nGlock 17\n\nSavon (Ice Cube) carries a 2nd Generation Glock 17 as his sidearm throughout the movie.\n\nRifles\n\nColt AR-15 Sporter II\n\nWhen the hostage situation begins, King James calls up his arms dealer Raymond (Bruce A. Young) and requests \"heavy artillery\". Raymond brings along a cache of weapons including a half-dozen Colt AR-15 Sporter II (SPII) assault rifles. Although the weapons have M16A2-style hand guards, they can be recognized as AR-15 SPIIs by the \"slab side\" lower receiver (visible in several shots), and the fact that none of the weapons are ever fired on full-auto. Most of King James' men, including Savon (Ice Cube), Moon (Byron Minns), Cletus (Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister), and Davis (Tico Wells) use AR-15s after this.\n\nSteyr SSG 69 PI\n\nAnother of the weapons that Raymond (Bruce A. Young) brings along is a Steyr SSG 69 sniper rifle with a 10-round box magazine, which is subsequently used by Luther (Glenn Plummer), who claims to have been a marksman in the Army.\n\nRemington 870"
