        "text": "Reviews\n\n\"American Outrage is an important document for all those who want to understand the ongoing resistance of Native peoples to U.S colonialism in Indian country. In documenting this struggle, the film is also an eloquent testament to the courage of the Dann sisters and through them to Native women around the country who have engaged and are engaging in this fight for justice.\"\n\nEric Cheyfitz, Director of the American Indian Program, Cornell University\n\n\"As Director of the Human Rights Watch International Film Festival I have screened thousands of films on human rights over the past 13 years. I applaud filmmakers Beth and George Gage who have achieved that rare film which expertly delivers a potent and timely human rights issue through masterful storytelling, beautiful cinematography, and unforgettable characters. American Outrage is a beautifully crafted, powerful, truly exceptional human rights film whose message and impact will reverberate for years to come.\"\n\nJohn H. Biaggi, Director, Human Rights Watch International Film Festival\n\n\"Every once in a while you come across a character in a documentary that you know you will not forget for a long time. Carrie Dann is one of those characters. Sadly, her story, like the title rightly tells us, is an outrageous but quintessentially American one: the near-impossible fight to save her pristine land from avaricious government and corporate interests. Compellingly-chronicled by veteran filmmakers Beth and George Gage, American Outrage is a film that will remain not only relevant but essential for decades.\"\n\nDavid Holbrooke, Festival Director, Mountainfilm in Telluride\n\n\"A beautifully evocative yet morally disturbing documentary. American Outrage provides an excellent history of the Dann sisters' resilience to the dominant culture and of their struggle to maintain a subsistence lifestyle, living wholly and completely with and by their ancestral lands. Their defense of this lifestyle is inextricably linked to their defense against the trespass claims laid against them by the federal government. These complicated legal matters, cinematographically set against breathtaking footage of Shoshone land, are carefully and coherently described by lawyers representing the Dann sisters. The scenes of their humble ranch, of their constant toil to maintain the land and livestock, of their loving family relationships, and of the Tribe's steadfast adherence to its culture and traditions provide a real sense of the deep emotional attachment to their lands and validate their resistance to the terrible injustice done against them and of their rightful indignation. The film lifts this incredible story from the dense pages of the legal opinions and spreads it out in an incredible emotional vista.\"\n\nPatrice H. Kunesh, Associate Professor of Law, Director, Institute of American Indian Studies, University of South Dakota\n\n\"American Outrage tells a story that all Americans should see. It recounts the attempts by Mary and Carrie Dan and the Western Shoshone people to keep their traditional homelands. This is a familiar tale, though, as the United States and the majority society have long used force and 'law' to take the lands and rights of American Indians. This is not just ancient American history, but is an ongoing reality for the Western Shoshone people.\"\n\nRobert J. Miller (Eastern Shawnee), Professor, Lewis and Clark Law School, Author, Native America, Discovered and Conquered: Thomas Jefferson, Lewis and Clark, and Manifest Destiny\n\n\"American Outrage shows the continuing application of the Right of Discovery to justify American acquisition of Shoshone land without native consent. The film reveals that the lust for wealth underlies the federal government's quest for Shoshone land and its possible collusion with multi-national corporations to mine the land for gold. This is a must-see documentary for its message that the United States acquisition of tribal lands under the guise of legality continues today, but also for the human story of two Shoshone women who with steel determination resisted both legally and physically the armed seizure of their land and livestock by federal authorities.\"\n\nDr. Linda Parker, Professor, Department of American Indian Studies, San Diego State University\n\n\"Highly recommended for academic and public libraries, American Outrage is an outstanding resource for courses in history, government, sociology, law, and ethics.\"\n\nDouglas Reed, Ouachita Baptist University, Educational Media Reviews Online\n\n\"[An] epic story...This documentary portrays the Dann sisters' 35-year struggle for their human rights, a microcosm of indigenous peoples across the globe. Classes can utilize this film...to study Native American history, human rights, contemporary legal issues, and women's studies.\"\n\nPatricia Ann Owens, Wabash Valley College, School Library Journal\n\n\"This moving testimonial is essential viewing...[American Outrage] will be appreciated by history buffs, students of Native American history, and general viewers.\"\n\nMargaret Miller, University of South Dakota Library, Library Journal\n\n\"Should be required viewing for every U.S. citizen.\"\n\nSarasota Film Festival\n\n\"Here is a committed film made by artists taking the Shoshone side in their struggle against the brutal exploitation they still experience.\"\n\nPrésence Autochtone Film Festival, Montréal\n\n\"The big twist, as it turns out, is that the Dann's land was on top of a gold mine, making their removal very profitable for some of the world's largest gold companies. The film also points out the great irony that as the US was taking Shoshone lands for their gold, they were also distributing the new Sacajawea coin. Sacajawea, the woman who led Lewis and Clark safely across the West, was also a Shoshone.\"\n\nGina Telaroli, Human Rights Watch\n\n\"Real Indians. Real Lives. A powerful testament to Indian self-determination and women-power. The Dann sisters deserve our utmost respect.\"\n\nMichael Smith, Founder and Director, American Indian Film Festival\n\n\"Engaging, illuminating...A worthy film that tackles a subject that ultimately embraces the whole history and foundation of the United States.\"\n\nDVD Talk"
