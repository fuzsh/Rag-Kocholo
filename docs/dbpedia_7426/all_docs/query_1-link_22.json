        "text": "In the short film Forgive Us Our Trespasses (Netflix), a young boy with a limb difference is forced into a terrible predicament when he’s targeted for elimination by the Nazi regime. Filmmaker Ashley Eakin directed Trespasses, and co-wrote it with her husband Shawn Lovering. Eakin, who has a rare bone condition, is an advocate for increased awareness of disability issues in film, and one of the first recipients of Netflix’s Emerging Filmmakers Initiative.\n\nFORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?\n\nThe Gist: Germany, 1939. Paul (Knox Gibson) and his fellow pupils are in his mother’s schoolroom, where she teaches a curriculum dictated by the Nazi regime. According to the lesson, the arithmetic required to care for an infirm or otherwise disabled person is clearly out of balance with the welfare of the German people. One child questions that assertion. “But if it costs so much to take care of these people, what do we do?” Another one answers coldly. “Kill them.” And Paul? He can only cast a troubled glance at his amputated right limb.\n\nPaul is perfectly capable, of course. His limb difference isn’t a deterrent to operating classroom tools, eating breakfast, or doing anything else that little boys everywhere deserve to do. But he’s afraid. At bedtime prayers, he asks his mother if we really should forgive those who trespass against us. “Even the Nazis?” It’s a fine question, but one with a difficult answer, and a raft of unequal moral implications. His mother reassures him that he is loved, that he is an individual, that he is valued. And the very next day, as if on cue, jackbooted Wehrmacht troops arrive at their doorstep. Hitler has decreed the roundup of those deemed unfit.\n\nThey’ve prepared for this terrible likelihood. Paul’s mother sends him running for a nearby barn, where a prosthetic device and other supplies have been secreted. But it’s also a hiding place for other persecuted parties, one well known to the army. In a split second, Paul makes the brave decision to participate in the resistance, as both an unfairly targeted individual and a person bearing witness to blanket persecution.\n\nWhat Movies Will It Remind You Of? Forgive Us Our Trespasses, Erax and Heart Shot are debuting simultaneously as the first round of shorts from Netflix’s Emerging Filmmaker Initiative. Through the program, Ashley Eakin (Trespasses), Hebru Brantley (Erax), and Marielle Woods (Heart Shot) were able to access early-career funding, development, and production tools, and see distribution of their work on the streamer.\n\nPerformance Worth Watching: As a child with a limb difference in Nazi Germany, Paul is both an innocent and a target. Knox Gibson represents that threshold well, but also steps across it effectively once they come for him.\n\nMemorable Dialogue: “You have to think for yourself,” Paul’s mother (Hanneke Talbot) tells him after another day spent ingesting Nazi propaganda in the classroom. “No – calculation – can measure the worth of a life…”\n\nSex and Skin: None.\n\nOur Take: Forgive Us Our Trespasses is only fourteen minutes in length, but it packs in the notes of tension, dramatic action, and release that would usually embody a film with a much wider scope. An early scene in the schoolroom, where children are indoctrinated into Nazi thinking on the societal benefits of involuntary euthanasia, simmers with what’s left unsaid. Paul, operating a pencil sharpener with his left hand and right limb, puts a very personal face on the arbitrary numbers represented by the math on the chalkboard. And as the camera pans back, the deceivingly safe space of the schoolroom is shown to be indoctrinated itself, a display case for a giant Swastika and an Adolph Hitler portrait. We’ve learned a number of hard truths about everyday life under the Third Reich, and it’s only been three minutes.\n\nOnce Paul is forced into the wind by the soldiers breaking down his door, Trespasses becomes an action sequence in miniature. Frantic stumbling through mud and dirt. Desperate cowering from soldiers on the prowl. Achieving safe haven in the nick of time, only to discover it’s compromised. And finding the courage to fight back, hopefully saving oneself and others in the process. It’s another sequence that’s only minutes long, but grandly illustrative, and supported well with tightly-paced direction, evocative lighting, and stirring music cues. By the time of Paul’s ultimate showdown, there’s a strong sense of Forgive Us Our Trespasses continuing into the ether, connecting to any number of other films about this setting and time period, with Paul as an additional character in those longer narratives.\n\nOur Call: STREAM IT. Forgive Us Our Trespasses is grand filmmaking on a small scale, with its advocacy for personhood balanced against a shameful epoch of 20th century history."
