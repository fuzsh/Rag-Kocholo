        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThere are only a few great tales of true resistance in our nations' history, tales that inspire us to believe that in the fight impossible odds can be beaten. This is such a story. Ynonne Margarula is the unsung hero at its heart.\n\nOnly 24 members of Yvonne Margarula's community remain alive today. Her language and cultural survival are threatened with extinction. Yet this gently spoken traditional Aboriginal woman has led the Mirarr people on a non- violent campaign of resistance that has stopped successive Federal and Territory Governments and two of the worlds largest mining companies, in their tracks.\n\nTrespass is a unique and powerful film on many levels. It is the first time Yvonne Margarula has agreed to be the subject of a long-form film about the Mirarr struggle. It is also the first time the story has been heard in the threatened language of the traditional owners. And crucially, it is the first time the Jabiluka story has been told with such humanity, such unshakeable quiet strength, via the lyrical, immutable voice of Yvonne Margarula."
