        "text": "Michael Fassbender will soon star in the action adventure film “Assassin’s Creed,” based on the video game by the same name, but he’s already appeared in many films this past year, including “The Light Between the Oceans,” “X-Men: Apocalypse” and then “Trespass Against Us,” a family drama that premiered earlier this year. “Trespass Against Us” follows three generations of the Cutler family who live as outlaws in their own corner of Britain’s richest countryside. Fassbender plays Chad, an heir apparent to his father Colby (Brendan Gleeson), but soon starts looking for another life as his own son Tyson (Georgie Smith) comes of age. It co-stars Sean Harris (“Prometheus”), Lyndsey Marshal (“The Hours”), Rory Kinnear (“Quantum of Solace”) and more. Watch an exclusive clip from the film below.\n\nREAD MORE: Michael Fassbender Steals ‘Trespass Against Us,’ A Charming Debut From Adam Smith — TIFF Review\n\nThis is Adam Smith’s debut feature film.
