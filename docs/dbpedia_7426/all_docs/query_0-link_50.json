        "text": "THE FILM APPEARANCES OF SAM KYDD\n\nMore info and pics on samkydd.com\n\nMy father made 119 films between 1945 and 1952. So he says in his memoir. Wow! And it seems to tally. Other than the occasional half day with no mention of the name of the film and just the money earned in his accounts diary!\n\nI have now counted 286 (there are less here) according to his unpublished memoirs and accounts book and iMDB, though there are several mistakes in their lists of his films and Tellies and I’m now looking for his diaries post 1959. He has a tendency to just write the film studio and the length of time he was on the film and the fee. And no name. Some can’t be traced. I’m also aware that he did many more Film Foundation Films than I have in this list. He does many more tellies and dubbing jobs not mentioned here than you could believe.
