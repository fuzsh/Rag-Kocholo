        "text": "Trespass: Behind the Scenes (1992)\n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nThis four-minute short is one of those old promotional films that were made to show on television to try and build up interest for a movie. The movie here is Walter Hill's TRESPASS and we get some nice clips from the movie as well as some behind-the-scenes footage of the director working. We also get interviews with Ice Cube, Ice-T, Bill Paxton and William Sadler who all briefly talk about their characters and the film. At just four-minutes there's obviously nothing ground-breaking to be found here but this was actually a pretty good promo and it certainly made you interested in the film, which was its main job."
