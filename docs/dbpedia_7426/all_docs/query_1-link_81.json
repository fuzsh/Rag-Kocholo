        "text": "PORTSMOUTH — The color orange is often symbolic of caution. This color dominates in the film \"Northern Trespass,\" a documentary about the controversial Northern Pass Project.\n\nDuring the hour-long film, shown twice Saturday at The Music Hall Loft, opponents of the project wore bright orange T-shirts, berets and protest pins.\n\n\"Northern Trespass\" was produced by Jan Marvel and Michelle Vaughn, both of Thornton, who spent two years filming in Québec, Canada, Vermont, New Hampshire and New London, Conn.\n\nThe film begins with a bubbling brook and quickly switches to noisy towers transmitting hydroelectric power from Quebec. There are interviews with residents in bucolic settings along the proposed 187-mile route from Canada, through the center of the state, ending in Deerfield.\n\nThere was also an interview with a physician who talked about the higher incidence of cancer in people living near power lines giving off low-frequency electromagnetic radiation\n\nThe film addresses the impact of the construction of more than 1,500 large, steel transmission towers from Coos to Rockingham counties.\n\nNorthern Pass is a partnership between Northeast Utilities, Public Service of New Hampshire and Hydro-Quebec to bring hydropower to New England. It still requires certain federal and state permits before construction can begin.\n\nA state Certificate of Site and Facility from the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee (SEC) is required for siting energy facilities in New Hampshire, such as natural gas pipelines, certain electric power generating plants, and high-voltage transmission lines, including Northern Pass.\n\nLee Sullivan of Arundel, Maine, gave opening remarks before the lights dimmed.\n\n\"Last spring, I saw a (real estate) listing that my family's old second home in Easton was for sale,\" Sullivan said. \"It was at a bargain basement price and the Realtor said it was because of the Northern Pass.\"\n\nSullivan attended a meeting in Easton where residents of the North Country said it was time for residents of the southern portion of the state to \"wake up to what was happening.\"\n\nShe added that the Northern Pass will eventually affect residents on the Seacoast as it ends in Rockingham County in Deerfield.\n\nThe first showing at 4 p.m. Saturday was well attended by an audience of about 100 sympathetic viewers.\n\nAfter the film, Marvel and Vaughn, along with Jack Savage of the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, held a question-and-answer session.\n\n\"We wanted to show the human aspects of this project, not just the facts and figures PSNH spits out,\" Vaughn said.\n\nSavage said the project would include 10 miles through the White Mountain National Forest.\n\n\"My personal feeling would be to bury as much of the line as they could,\" he said.\n\nThe three major concerns of the project, according to the filmmakers, were the effects on health, tourism and real estate.\n\nLauren Collins, spokeswoman for Northern Pass LLC, said she watched the film on DVD Friday night.\n\n\"First of all, a lot of the footage of the power lines were taken in Canada,\" she said Saturday evening. \"The width of the lines seen in the film is not what is planned for New Hampshire. It is visually misleading.\"\n\nShe added that the film came out around the same time in the spring of 2013 when the Northern Pass had changed the route.\n\nThe first eight miles of the project near the Canadian border will be underground, but Collins said it would be very difficult to go underground through the White Mountain range.\n\n\"The landscape of New Hampshire would make it cost prohibitive to go underground,\" she said.\n\nShe added that studies from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences showed \"marginal scientific evidence linking AC current to cancer.\"\n\nAs far as the tourism, Collins said there has never been a significant study showing a negative effect on tourism because of power lines. She added that a 2011 study by Underwood Real Estate of Littleton and Deerfield shows that the project was not affecting the market.\n\nCollins said Northern Pass is hoping to receive the necessary permits by early 2015 and has a goal of completion by mid-2017.\n\nIf anything, \"Northern Trespass\" will get people talking.\n\nDale Whisler of Atkinson was visiting friends in Portsmouth and a group of seven came to the afternoon showing of the film.\n\n\"I'm wondering how we can influence the SEC,\" he said of the Site Evaluation Committee. \"They are a statewide planning board. In local towns, we have planning boards and zoning boards of adjustment who have a vested interest in more development. I'd like to know more about the SEC.\""
