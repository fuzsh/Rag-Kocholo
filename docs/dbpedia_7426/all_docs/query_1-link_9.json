Indian Stream Productions is proud to be among the many who took on the big corporations and stopped them in their tracks. We hope that our documentary can continue to be a helpful, educational tool for many others battling something similar.\n\nThis documentary is produced by two new filmmakers from the White Mountains of New Hampshire, Jan Marvel & Michelle Vaughn. “Northern Trespass” will take you on a journey from Québec, Vermont, New London, CT and many towns throughout New Hampshire. This film documents how the Northern Pass will affect the tourism industry, health, the environment, the White Mountain National Forest, property values as well as New Hampshire’s greatest treasure, its scenic beauty.\n\nThe “Northern Trespass” documentary is now available for sale on DVD!
