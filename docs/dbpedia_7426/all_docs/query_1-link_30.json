        "text": "The Mass Trespass of Kinder Scout in 1932 was one of the greatest acts of civil disobedience the UK has ever witnessed. It was an action that paved the way for our right to roam on mountain and moorland. Without it, we may not have been able to have full access to the countryside and the green open spaces we now have.\n\nSet in the Peak District, this short film tells the heroic story of the trespassers and the change they brought about in getting us access, that eventually lead to the creation of the national parks we have nationwide. It is a film that celebrates their achievements and sets an example of how mass participation can bring about change for good. For this was a fight not only about access but about class. The wealthy landowners and the state against working-class men and women who simply wanted an escape on the weekends.\n\nThe film a great example of effective protest for todayâ€™s world."
