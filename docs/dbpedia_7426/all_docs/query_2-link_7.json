        "text": "It was June, and the monsoon had arrived on the Kerala coast a few days before.\n\nShould I go for another snooze ?. Did someone hang weights on my eyelids? I could hardly open them. It was a bitterly cold day, and it was pouring outside. It's dark all over, is it morning or evening.? What is happening ? I quickly regained my senses.\n\nTime was already 7.45 am, if I wake up now, high chances I will get the 9.50 am train, or else it’s going to be a loss of pay. I finally got out of the blanket after a cognitive tug of war.\n\nHere comes the next herculean task. ‘Oh God, where is my toothbrush’. As I didn’t have enough time and patience, I went for the biggest search engine at home.\n\n‘Mom, where is it? Mother-son conversations are always telepathic. ‘It might fell from the table, look under the table dear'.\n\n'Cool man, how does she do it every time'?. The mystery remains unsolved to date. After the morning chaos, I got dressed up and was ready for work.\n\nAs I came out of the room, the appetizing aroma of ghee from the stove made me reconsider foregoing breakfast. I did some quick math and discovered that I had about 10 minutes to satiate my hunger. After having a couple of dosas, I started walking to the bus stop.\n\nWalking with a bag and an umbrella on a rainy day is not an easy task, especially when you are short on time. You’re going to get drenched one way or another.\n\nI made it to the bus stop on time. Back then, the term “social distancing” was unfamiliar. When the bus came, some ‘natural forces’ took me onto the bus !. Everything was perfect and in another 5 minutes, I should reach the railway station.\n\nIt was then a massive political rally, which appeared on the road, thwarted all of my plans. Everything got frozen, and I had little time to think about it. Unless you’re Usain Bolt, you are done for the day. I jumped off the bus and dashed towards the station. As I was running, I could hear the siren. 'Oh God, it’s on time.'\n\nAnyhow, I’m almost there, and as I entered the station, it was heartbreaking to see the train on the opposite platform. If I take the over-bridge, I will undoubtedly miss the train.\n\n'Cross the track now', my subconscious said.…\n\nAfter a momentary glance at both sides, I made a quick jump onto the railway track. Swiftly crossed to the next side. I got a smooth take-off as I attempted a jump from the track to the platform. I thought I’d made it to the top safely. But I slipped and fell back onto the railway track. On my way back to the track, my leg collided with a metal block.\n\nAwww… Ripped pants and bleeding legs. The agony was excruciating.\n\nA few kind souls gathered around and took me to the platform. Meanwhile, I could see the tail end of the train with the guard waving the green flag.\n\nI felt so bad and this one incident had a profound impact on me. I sat on the platform bench and backtracked the events of the last few minutes. I gathered some wisdom from my experiences.\n\n✅Be at least 15 minutes before the right time.\n\n✅Rules are meant for our safety, better obey them.\n\n✅Don’t be impulsive in taking decisions."
