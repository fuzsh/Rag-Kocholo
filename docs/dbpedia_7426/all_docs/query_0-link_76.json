        "text": "Universal Studios European Village in the 1930’s era…Sets I would never get to explore.\n\n1967- Sets affected that remained for decades more, include The Court of Miracles, buildings closest and not entirely engulfed and Spartacus Square. In this photo, a section of buildings on right of frame would remain standing. Paint, wood and stucco would repair the cosmetics as firefighters preserved the integrity of the stairway leading up to the structure itself.\n\nThe rooftops I’m on in this picture were built to replace the buildings devastated by the fire.the 1987 fire. This section burned twice, 67 and 87. Construction would start immediately after clean up. The buildings on the left -across the way are in pictures where fire department was battling the blaze. They saved the front side and that street was repaired. Spartacus-most distant- right side of frame avoided any damage. These rooftops pictured-have burned down twice.\n\nBoth sides of street burned below me, the cobblestone road is original as buildings went up in foot print of original.\n\nYou can see this building from rooftop pics-notice the gated columns. Building salvaged and repaired.\n\nSame building in flames 40 years later…Dressed for- Monuments of Men. A George Clooney film 2014\n\nBuildings in Spartacus Square that survived and were repaired. No longer do they exist, Sound Stages fill this area now.\n\nThis building survived and was repaired…Same courtyard, fire department is seen battling in 1967.\n\nUniversal color photos from Company 51, Our Emergency Fire Department on the lot.\n\nSpartacus- not touched but as close as you can be. This photo is “Berlin” in Monuments of Men. 2014. Spartacus was torn down, deemed unsafe by the fire department.- I can vouch for that, we had electrical panels on the backside where we ran cables for lighting and transportation power, The floor caved in on me one evening carry a heavy load of electrical cables. Wolfgang Puck Food and Wine festivals used this section of the backlot for magnificent parties. All the food and wine you could handle, entertainment, fancy lighting and movie props, such as statues, sarcophagus’s, chariots, and harems. An annual huge event…some buildings deemed unsafe basically ended this event. Now, brand new stages stand in this area.\n\nSpartacus Set survived as flames surrounded it. In the two New York Street fires I experienced, helicopters were key to saving the lot, especially the film vaults. The main focus was film storage and water dropping helicopters filled up “rapid fire” from our Red Sea. Our lake helped fight these fires.\n\nSpartacus Set-The Long Building in right of frame with a dirt road behind it miraculously survived this event. Universal Studios hosted a party sponsored by Wolfgang Puck, annually, called an American Food and Wine Festival. Mood Lighting, Music, Set Decorations, Spirits and Gourmet Food awaited you. Often used for Basecamps, trailers and tents packed this square. No longer exists…\n\nI would guess this is after the 67′ fire. Everything is exactly detailed as it was. every doorway had an electrical panel inside. Called shore power, we could handle large events here power wise, plus, we back it up with generators in case something gets over amped! The show must go on…\n\nReplacements of what burned down…\n\n“And on my side of the tram”…I did this a thousands times at least….Trams exiting the Parting of the Red Sea next will end up here…\n\nMy focus of amazement is not the fire itself, it’s the Showboat in the Black Lagoon. McHale’s Navy filmed in this quadrant of the backlot from 1962 to 1966. In fact, I see P.T. Boats next to a structure we called the Snow House. Fake snow was stored inside. The River Boat would be relocated for a Studio Tour highlight at the opposite end of this lake. The lagoon branches off the lake. This is also where The Parting of the Red Sea animation on your Glamour Tram Tour would be built. The sea would part and trams would drive through here on the way to European Street. That Showboat had 3 separate locations on this lake that I know of. It was not seaworthy when I explored it. This Showboat, Lagoon, and The Parting of the Red Sea no longer exist. The Lagoon became a Satellite Farm for large Satellite Dishes for NBC to broadcast live.\n\nEverything with a gray roof pictured here is a rebuild. Fringe sets, farthest away survived fire.\n\nCourt of Miracles is about to become engulfed.\n\nThis alley still stands today- all this burned in 1967.\n\nCobblestone still remains from this fiery event. Castle from The Scorpion King.\n\nThis “Court of Miracles” area is often used for catering-tents, tables and a nearby catering truck circle the fountain. A nice place to eat!\n\nIt’s a miracle what this fountain has “lived” through…\n\nOur fountain survived the fire, and sits in The Court of Miracles to this day. The most special “prop” on the backlot. It has four flying Lions, and has been used in everything from Monster Movies to Playboy shoots. This fountain has seen it all!\n\nCourt of Miracles fountain withstood this holocaust but this village burned. The building in background is the final stop of the Universal Train used in all our old westerns. The tracks continually do a slight curve to give impression they disappear into the frontier. I will take down those tracks in future post.\n\nThat’s where my beloved fountain was located in the 1967 Fire.\n\nEvery picture tells a story…Be Cautious and follow me, this is my home away from home!\n\nLet’s begin in a blaze of fire-1967. Historic sets, chateaus, and villages, areas most utilized in classic Universal Monsters Films. Chew on that for a moment.\n\nStrange Things Lurk Here\n\nThe staple of Universal Pictures, Monsters roamed freely here. It’s almost fitting these ghosts from the past disappeared in one flaming afternoon. Only they didn’t die, nothing really dies around here…it’s the very place I take you through today. Walk softly, trust your instincts, you’re in the footsteps,,, of Monsters.\n\nTwo stages still exist that were used in Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi films-a third, Stage 28, the most haunted of all-has been removed- willingly by NBC Universal. Shame on them, you have unleashed a curse! Stage 12 and 27 remain as testament to studio origins.\n\nMonsters are our Friends\n\nPersonally, I would have made Stage 28 the defacto museum of Universal history. The Paris Opera House was built inside and these walls from the Original Phantom of the Opera have been witness to all our history.\n\nBetter known as- The Glamour Tram. Celebrating 60 Years on the Backlot\n\nWho Didn’t watch- The Munsters.\n\nEven the Beatles watched them– then they all met in person when the Beatles played in Dodger Stadium in 1965. Unable to book hotels because of potential of being over run, Founder Lew Wasserman put them up here at Universal. If you do not know-MCA stands for Music Corporation of America. That’s who signed my paychecks -those three formidable letters. Monsters and Rock Stars united. A decade later Paul McCartney would return with new friends who love monsters…\n\nEveryone loves our Monsters…\n\nEven Steven Spielberg...This Frankenstein set is located inside Amblin Entertainment. Steven always uses our oldest biggest stages- where all our monster history took place on the front lot.\n\nLet’s Tour the Backlot Sets used in these iconic films…\n\n“All Aboard-I’ll Drive!”\n\nNo Smoking is the first rule you will hear from these pretty ladies. To build up enthusiasm, guides are provided “call sheets” to point out who and what we may run into on today’s tour. In 1967-these were the studio productions…\n\nTram Keeps a Rollin…\n\nAfter a leisurely tour outside stages we enter the backlot. “All original streets back then.” The P.T. Boat 73- from McHale’s Navy still sits in the lagoon after the show was canceled,” points out our beautiful Glamour Tram Tour Guide. Let’s push on through the Red Sea- ‘Part the Waters Everybody.”\n\n“My cue” to activate the genie that triggers a drain to lower the water level.\n\n“Ahead you see trailers that are used as dressing rooms during filming.” says our expert sitting next to me.\n\nSometimes – the water level is higher than other times creating severe drag on these vehicles that carry 125 passengers. With wet tires and wet roadways from previous trams ahead of us-this can be a “spinning tire- 16 wheel battle.” On the other side is our Little Europe Set, Spartacus, and the Court of Miracles.\n\nAs Blood, Sweat and Tears would sing back then “Spinning Wheel got to go ’round.” No truer words here…I sang that in my head. High water level also sometimes snagged women’s purses if they were on the steel plated floor. Once that happened on my tram with cash spreading into lagoon. The Tour Guide warns you to not leave things on the floor before proceeding through-“So we’re covered-pay attention!”\n\nWhat a difference a year makes, Red Sea Location – Right before the 1967 Fire McHale’s Navy was still on the air. Dry docked in photo on the right. The Creature from The Black Lagoon set became the Parting of the Red Sea for a rapidly and successfully developing Universal Studio Tour.\n\n“Are those flames ahead ?”\n\nOur vintage tour ends here in the first big Universal Backlot Fire. I saw three huge backlot fires in my career. Two on New York Street and one in our European street area featured today. That was quickly contained limiting damage, so fact is -this area burned again in 1987. It was contained to 4 structures and rebuilt very quickly.\n\nHistory repeats itself around here…\n\nWritten and Lived by…Donnie Norden\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nA friend, Kenny Paes, sent me this colorized version of the Desilu Backlot. Stalag 13-upper right.Yes they are actively filming an episode of Hogan’s Heroes on this fly over…Notice crew parking and how trucks get positioned to hide things or just remain out of frame. Equipment most closest to set is usually most often is -a camera truck. Film needs to be constantly added for camera. It’s why were all here. I can break this picture down for days straight. This captures the lot I know best.\n\nHahaha-a security guard sits parked in his car when filming isn’t taking place. The “third” guard tower exists in this photo. Security is facing the Western Street. He can see any approach to Stalag 13, except if you climb in back in the heavy brush on the corner of Lucerne. That’s exactly the where my Mission Impossible exploration began on a Sunday night in 1972.\n\nIn this photo, you see snow. Ground level and hillside, this was heavy plaster molds with spiders living underneath. You could pick them up and move them. The rooftops were simply painted patches of snow. Neighborhood houses on Lucerne Avenue looked directly into Stalag 13. Only two guard towers existed when this shot was taken, a 3rd would be added at the very left side of the camp fence. It overlooked the backyard that contained a make up trailer used by the show. That trailer originally was built and used by Marion Davies. Three snow patches on right hand hill side our where the three tree stumps are located. A Tiger Tank is parked along the fence line by crew parking, that’s where it was stored. The guy who owns the house that connects to Stalag 13 has started it up, a diesel motor, and was arrested by Desilu security and C.C.P.D. That’s where the make up trailer sits, in his yard…still. I have the mirrors and items from antiquity that were hidden inside.\n\nResidential neighborhoods surround this property on two streets. Lucerne and Higuera Streets. Ince Blvd takes you inside the lot. One other gated entrance exists farther down Higuera. Two roads to enter and exit-both are dirt, as is most of this backlot. The fences were chain link allowing easy view points. The Atlanta Train Depot is the first big large structure left of the camp and hillside I take you on in this story. That is the Gone With the Wind set. Gomer Pyle’s barracks can be seen upper right corner of backlot, La Ballona creek is the southern most boundary of this backlot.\n\nFive complete barracks that have four walls is all we have here. Three others are partials as is Klink’s office. Power is fed by generators behind Klink’s office also. Those generators are mobile., I see a cable run from a barrack to the barb wire fences-another generator positioned there. The long piece of Transportation equipment appears to be a “honey wagon.” Portable mobile bathrooms. This backlot only had one bathroom facility, located off Higuera Street. That way it could tie into public sewers….12 stalls, 6 for men, 6 for women was all that this backlot had at its disposal. Located in between Mayberry and Stalag 13 on the infamous Desilu Dirt Highway. This lot was busy and not enough bathrooms existed, so shows utilized the same equipment used on location. The things we take for granted need planning on movie sets.\n\nhe last film here was not what you would think …The only part of the camp to survive in 1974 was the shed aside from Klink’s office. That became a tool shed for The Fortune Movie.\n\nAn adult movie finished of this Stalag- She Wolf of the S.S\n\nThe hill behind this discussion is how we first approach this liberated P.O.W Camp.\n\nFact-Klink’s office was just a front of a building, the backside was wide open and the view opposite the front door looked upon the Western Street towards the saloon.\n\nKlink’s office is located behind that corner building with a German truck parked alongside. I had a fort in the saloon located on this street.\n\nMore facts–These rope cots came out of the P.O.W’s barracks. The set they are behind is a crossover set, used first by The Andy Griffith Show but also seen in Hogan’s Heroes. In the distance, an original Stalag 13 edifice, with a snow painted rooftop. ‘You gotta keep pushing snow when you’re really in sunny Southern California!”\n\nFront side- this house pictured above.The tree stumps are hidden behind camouflage as is much of the house because…This is Mission Impossible. All the snow on ground and painted on roof had to be removed, then put back immediately.\n\n“Sheriff Taylor” is being shot at as the State Police can’t believe their eyes- This is that set, in my picture I took from backside.. Pre Hogan and Gomer Pyle. You would see Camp Henderson after 1964 in background. With a sharp set of eyes, you can see this set in wide camp views, usually with a big wheeled, red- Fire fighting piece of equipment in background. Cross overs continue on this tight knit tiny backlot…Desilu is family, on the lot and on Television.\n\nColonel Crittendon on one set\n\nMalcolm Merriweather on another , A Gentle Men’s Gentlemen just down the dirt road that attaches Mayberry with Stalag 13\n\nIf that guard tower could speak, Maureen and I’ would be embarrassed!\n\nThe Mayberry Highway dirt road-connects Stalag 13 to Andy Griffith’s Courthouse.All Desilu shows have one thing in common, this centralized bathroom in the middle of the backlot. Right side of picture, nestled into hill side. 6 stalls for men and 6 for women.Notice the painted snow on the rooftop, for Hogan’s Heroes, plaster snow comes into play the closer you get to Stalag 13. So many episodes utilize this road, this hillside was my portal to watch filming in the camp area.\n\nJohn Dehner selling Elixir in Mayberry. Another Desilu cross over star. I had my own Elixir’s that we partaked in up in the Guard Towers of Stalag 13 and in the Taylor Residence where we had a fort upstairs\n\nGeneral von Platzen… Character\n\nCross overs…Hal Smith, Otis Cambell also known as “Hot Rod“\n\nWe loved this character and relived his character running around the Desilu lot…Everyone loves Elixers, even Desi Arnaz.\n\nPut some Whiskey in your water, sugar in your Tea, what are all these crazy questions your asking me?\n\nThe people behind the making of all our favorite shows including Hogan’ Heroes. Three most famous D’s…Danny Thomas, Dan Cahn, Desi. Arnaz. Desilu is a union of these fine Gentlemen. The men behind the empire…Let’s not leave out the- The Desilu Queen . Picture courtesy Daniel Cahn, son of the legend. These are the brains to all your Desilu T.V shows, read the credits. If it says Desilu= Top quality!\n\nWe need a director and Bruce Bilson worked his way from a 1st A.D on Andy Griffith to directs several Hogan’s Heroes. The ultimate cross over, the man, the legend, I’m so honored to have talked with him! Maureen and I love this legend of a man, here with our first book- Hole in the Fence. If you need just one Director for all things Desilu and Paramount… this man captures what Hollywood was and shall ever be from the Golden Years of Hollywood.\n\n.We start in 1964 for this read on Desilu History;\n\nA Prisoner of war camp that was constructed in the tail end of 1964 for the very first episode of Hogan’s Heroes that was the only aired in a Black and White format. The pilot episode is titled “The Informer.” The series would begin at this time would run from 1965 to 1971. CBS pushed for color as this series was picked up.\n\nWelcome to the Color Revolution as color console TV’s. This was as big of a culture as A.I is becoming today…60 years later. Viewing habits changed, making homes- mini theaters.\n\nYou could lay on shag carpets and eat T.V dinners off a tray parked in front of T.V sets. Some families demanded dining room participation but eventually, the talk at these table was as much about television shows as it was “what’s new with our family?”\n\nMy mom believed in family prayer at the dinner table. Going to a Catholic School, it seemed I prayed all day.” Lord- please provide me good television was my mantra and bless all the animals…Amen”\n\nPrayers answered-not only did I receive that, I was steered divinely to places where these T.V shows were made. We were taught the Golden Rules of the Ten Commandments and luckily for me-“Trespassing wasn’t one of them.”\n\nTrespassing isn’t a sin mother, she saw a passion in her son’s eyes at a time when television was taking off.\n\nStereo’s had built in record players and slots for 8 Tracks tape players to slide into, so much entertainment, you hated to have to go to school!…Columbia House had adds in magazines offering 8 records or tapes for a dollar. Once they hook you with that deal- expect a stack at your front door monthly, at a readjusted price. That describes the Home Front where we watched all are favorite shows and series in comfort and luxury, complete with a dog or two at your feet, and a 67 GTO parked out front.\n\nI knew these studios existed, I could see MGM Lot 2 from my house, Desilu was a bike ride away. Imagine for a moment when I finally crossed the Blue Line and began living amongst these iconic sets. Reruns allowed me to relieve things filmed at these studios months, years and even decades before.\n\nOver time- I would become in contact with almost every famous set in Hollywood, beyond Culver City and our neighborhood film factories.\n\nBecause of ‘Dogs on Duty” and there indeed were, it delayed my exploration of this famous Stalag. The night we finally entered Stalag 13, we were scared to death. I had very few volunteers to to go on this expedition.\n\nWe studied the camp from the big hill that looks down upon it. A calling to me was being transmitted from who I don’t know, finally on a Sunday Night the time had come to live on this sacred site. Sneaking through a yard of a city resident was the shortest path to this Stalag. At night it is pitch dark, factor that in to a place secured by vicious dogs.\n\nMarion Davies to the rescue\n\nFirst we had to climb a fence to get to the Desilu Fence, in between climbs, in someone’s yard, we hid behind a shed. This was a point of No Return. Like the Dirty Dozen at the chateau, we went over possibilities that might occur, gathering confidence needed for the next climb, we finish this planning behind a shed that 50 years later, I discovered this is Marion Davies make up trailer. This night- it was mission command post.\n\nLike the P.O.W’s had to do, we are now sneaking into…Stalag 13. We are inside laying along side fake snow and deep grass, ready to retreat if need be. Still close to a fence to escape, our eyes become night vision goggles…or better described as a nest of owls. We carry cans of mace in case shit hits the fan in Stalag 13-with dogs on duty!\n\nThe coast seems clear- next-run like a bat out of hell to a guard tower located next to the red and white guard shack. We shut the main gate and latch it in an attempt have a barrier in case dogs show up. We are now living our own episode of this cancelled T.V show. Now-up a simple ladder, and we are looking down on this Luft Stalag. If Hogan could see us now, he would salute us. We came and conquered another landmark set.\n\nFast forward 1974\n\nThis perfectly conditioned camp was ours to enjoy. I felt like a teenage Producer, having a full backstage pass. I would thank God in my nightly prayers for providing me with the Super Powers needed to be a top notch trespasser. I owned Stalag 13.\n\nAll Things Must Pass\n\nIn an unexpected move, I arrived on the lot only to find the Stalag is being decommissioned. The Guard towers were relocated toward the fence we first climbed in on. The kennel and the dog house were no where in site. Only a shed next to Klink’s office was still left where it has been since 1964. Turns out this would be used as a tool shed for the production that is now taking away everyone’s favorite prison camp.\n\nThe series lasted 6 years and the Stalag itself- 9 years. I was in charge the last two. I had every set in Hollywood to work with but this one was far my favorite…a deserted Stalag.\n\nIt wasn’t built to last forever, the barracks had ho floors inside, just dirt. No foundation, they leaked heavy in rainy season with puddles building up inside, making everything muddy. Wood and rope cots were the only contents inside. This camp never was vandalized, trespassing hadn’t taken off inside yet.\n\nNo one knew the place was empty and yours for the taking. Guards patrolled in cars now and then, but not in a forceful high profile way like MGM. More like a farmer checking out his ranch.\n\nIn 1965, Hogan’s Heroes became a Top Ten Show in its first season. When the network pulled the plug 168 episodes later, its ranking was #39, but pulled 19.8 in ratings. Gomer Pyle shut its gate just through the eucalyptus trees that separate these camps the year before in 1969. Pyle’s ratings were extremely high, winning out over Hogan’s Heroes. Only once did Pyle fall to double digits, #10 in ’67, but #2 or #3 all five other seasons.\n\nBonanza rates as the all time powerhouse and filmed many episodes on our Western Street whose upstairs saloon I had a fort in with a working off-lot phone, I have called my mom from this saloon telling her “I”m Fine and am staying over at a friends house,” Pat did the same as we camped out in the backlot all night.\n\nDesilu Television dominated T.V Ratings-Andy Griffith, Gomer Pyle, Batman, I Love Lucy, followed by Hogan’s Heroes. The Andy Griffith Show spun off to Mayberry R.F.D and that series took off, briefly. The Jim Nabors Show replaced Gomer Pyle, Hogan’s Heroes never finished back in the Top 10 after its initial season.\n\nStar Trek, Batman, Andy Griffith, Gomer Pyle, Hogan’s Heroes, That Girl, and a collie named Lassie all had successful series overlapping each other using this backlot. The only fights they had were over prime time and slotting against other big hits. Star Trek was knocked down when slotted on Friday Night against Gomer Pyle.\n\nAs Jim Nabors became the king of this lot, Bob Crane guest starred on various series such as Love American Style, and two Disney features, Superdad and Gus. and even doing the Dinner Theater circuit. That is when he met his fate, in Scottsdale, Arizona, still a mysterious and unsolved mystery.\n\nRest in Peace– Colonel Hogan, your surrounded by fans still!\n\nThese three are also linked for eternity…Their graves look at each others…\n\nThe Bob Crane Show / KNX-CBS Radio / Marilyn Monroe Interview c. 1960\n\nWhat a gem this short interview is…amazing how fate plays out- Destiny!\n\nBob is laid to rest just across from Marilyn Monroe. Forever this close…\n\nA film titled The Fortune is clearing out all things Stalag 13 for a large build on a southwest Bungalow type setting where much of this film is to be filmed. Warren Beatty is the star alongside Jack Nicholson. Jack would soon win an Academy Award for China Town following this effort. All you followers of Hogan’s Heroes will recognize the trees, grass burms, minus the fake plaster snow and all things the landscape minus the camp.\n\nI was on this set all the time, looking down from hillsides that were used by our merry men. I actually needed to be rescued by this film crew when this hill caved in and I fell into it’s bowels. I didn’t realize this hill was partially fake and hollow inside.I found at the hard way because there was no escape with an extension ladder.\n\nThe Fortune rescues Donnie…\n\nFortunately, I was the only one captured inside this hillside that was part of Stalag 13, close to the tree stump, which I had already removed from the lot. I got to know the construction crew who built this new set and they showed up for the rescue. “Oh it’s you” was how I was greeted when my head appeared through the tall grass.\n\n“Hi Guys -Thanks for showing up!”\n\nStuff from the camp…\n\nWell I got the Pearl, this tree stump would continue on entertaining kids for about 5 years before collapsing from over use and oversized kids. The Stalag Barracks doors ended up in a yard close by, the same yard we hid in our first trespass. The black door handle on Klink’s office at this time had no significant value. Nothing in this camp was considered legendary- chew on that folks!\n\nThat’s the one consistent fact of life, this was just stuff no longer needed. I wanted a dog house and a guard tower of course, but I was able to rescue “The Stump”\n\nThat home on Lucerne can still be seen today, Chris the property owner says the fence had a gate connected to the Stalag and this show used Marion Davies 100 year old trailer for make up touch ups. The stars congregated in this very special yard that Desi Arnaz was part of including for this T.V series. Desi updated Marion’s 1925 music box to a modern Panatron system of entertainment where actors could be notified they are needed and their make up status. A sink to take make up off and a bar of soap last used by- Who Knows -sits along side my ancient mirrors from antiquity. Yes Marion Davies and myself are connected to Hollywood Forever. I’m truly an old soul that’s why I was picked to rescue this from demolition that is most certain for this corner.\n\nThe last series ever to utilize this room was Hogan’s Heroes. A personal gate separated this room with Stalag 13. This property, formally owned by R.K.O has green under-paint, everywhere, walls, sidewalks, etc. This room was locked shut after Hogan’s Heroes, with all the spirits still inside. I let them all out to live on forever.\n\nPicture most -left -is where we first snuck in, the yellow streak represents Marion Davies 100 year old make -up trailer. That tiny backyard shed is where we first hid, in between fence climbing, it’s connected to Stalag with in own entry to and from camp.These screen grabs our from 1967, Mission Impossible.\n\nIn the pilot episode that started it all, General Burkhalter was a Colonel, not a General. I did not know until much later, Robert Clary was a P.O.W in WW2. I met him after the series in 1977, on the set of Fantasy Island. Yes- he was in a prison for that episode…Devil’s Island. His character Ipsy La Fan had to escape or rot forever in this jungle prison. Bert Convy also starred in this as a magician who could escape from anything. Together, they found freedom. I sat next to him in director chairs used by the cast and talked Desilu on the MGM backlot, I broke him the news that Stalag 13 was removed but softened the blow by telling him my tree stump rescue.\n\nDecades later, here I am connecting dots in history. This kid trespasser is now a historian of sorts, based of boots on the ground experiences that stand up to…the test of time!\n\nHope you enjoyed my romping around with me. My book –The Uninvited Visitor-takes you to Desilu as a trespasser and we close the curtain on this wonderful backlot with never heard -real stories.

In 1981- MGM would acquire United Artists and has much of the library that another mogul-Ted Turner would purchase this library and TCM was born. The greatest movie channel ever devised. The only channel many of us watch- besides T.V Land. I worked at MGM in 1981 in their Film Lab. I was so proud… I was earning paychecks with the MGM logo after a decade of trespassing their lots.

I’ve been to them all, they even let in minors to watch the adults. Dark, sleazy, places your mother would not go. A minor, on a stool with a glass of orange juice under a haze of thick tobacco smoke. As pool gets played on tables that our crooked or ripped. “Donald Sr -where is our son, he was with you in the car” a conversation between my parents I’ve heard. “You didn’t bring Donnie here did you- you better not have” as I hide under a table. Mom knew where to find dad at certain times.\n\nLet’s begin here-1981- MGM /United Artists\n\nI worked at MGM in 1981 in their Film Lab. I was so proud… I was earning paychecks with the MGM logo after a decade of trespassing their lots. Moral to the story-“Don’t give up your dreams, the Universe works with you if you just let it!” MGM Film Labs, do to contracts lasted longer than MGM department.

Inside, pictures of MGM. I have box loads. That picture with the light outside my old “back cottage” says 56th Precinct. Off a show titled Popi, seen here lighting up my backyard…MGM Laboratories. A story for another time, quite an experience.\n\nYet another film reel container from a James Bond film “Moonraker” produced by MGM U/A. Technicolor was located on the Universal Lot and all the naughty chemicals used in these labs were dumped run the L.A River at that studio. That’s why it was built alongside the channel, easy disposal.Now NBC News sits where Technicolor stood. All those slides are MGM and will be in my Picture Book of my “El Supremo” picture stash of Studio Backlots. Yes-it will be in color with a Hard Cover. My life in pictures…”Holy Shit Batman”\n\nOut of Business …Do to no fault of mine, the desert sands shifted. MGM as we knew it was officially done.\n\nLike a desert horizon void of water, it was time to do something else. Poisonous snakes were everywhere it seemed. It’s not easy to get jobs at the studio, so I applied for Police and Fire Department jobs in surrounding cities. I looked into stunt work, did some cool extra work, but it was the Southern California Gas Company that threw me out a solid contract. I accepted, and wouldn’t you know it, I wanted Santa Monica Base-since I lived in S.M at that time having just been married. But I was assigned to Hollywood Base, on Formosa. Just behind The Formosa Cafe and alongside The Warners Hollywood Studio. This was the former Goldwyn Studio looking down on us.\n\nI had to watch “Cattle Calls” sometimes a block long, of pretty girl behind pretty girl “demonstrating their abilities” while trying to catch the fancy of casting directors. This line took forever to move as truck after truck of heavy equipment moved slowly down Formosa Avenue checking out who we would choose for what- Only the Lord knows…\n\nI had taken tests for IBEW Local 40-Studio Electrician and was accepted to be a trainee but, there were no openings. I had to wait my turn, so I did this “manly man” job, working on live Gas Mains around Hollywood. Funny thing is in the studios, the jobs requirements at So Cal Gas equal 4 different unions in the studios. Here, we just wear 4 different hats and flame retardant clothing.\n\nTeamsters, Laborers, Welders, and Electricians would be required in the studios, due to Unions- here “it’s just me and my crew leader.” I learned a lot and am thankful for it- but I wanted to be in Showbiz. I was reminded of that every time I went down Formosa. We return to base all worn out & filthy, while the studio side of the street was all smiles and kisses…just a typical days work trying to get a part on Love Boat. The most famous Party Boat in Hollywood History!\n\nA very successful series that ran from 1977 to 1986. Basically “Love‘ sums it all up.\n\nCasting –Little Mermaids-Where’s Mary Pickford? All So happy and full of energy. A very difficult search that’s going to take some time- says every “Male Casting Director.”\n\nI Want Some Kisses… Too\n\nRumor has it -Cocaine is rampant. Not at the Gas Company-we get tested, but across the street in those long lines of females at that studio. “Producers help enable this conduct” according to Lauren Tewes one of the stars.\n\nSamuel Goldwyn wouldn’t do that…\n\nWhose “High” in these following pictures\n\nHow come my gums are so numb?\n\nI’m not sure” answers Margot Kidder, another regular at ‘The Lot”… “Can I borrow some clothes?” Superman even looks like-A person of interest. ” Fly a Straight line for me-Mr Clark – S”\n\nThe joke was the “Love Boat” smuggled drugs. Probably as accurate as it is funny. Cocaine flourished at the studios. I have stories with top actors at Universal heavily under the influence, witnessed by myself-first hand from my predecessors. Parties are legendary,\n\nCheech and Chong/ The Blues Brothers had a ” combined wrap party” that’s better than their movies. The stage was-Up in Smoke so to speak. Kids, well they had their own stage to play on so grown ups could “chill privately” – the kids weren’t allowed on the party stage. They had plenty of gadgets and gizmos on the stage next door, popcorn and clowns were provided to keep their little minds occupied. The studios are experts own keeping everybody happy. This was the most talked about party from insiders who lived it.\n\nTram Drivers and Tour Guides often lacked scruples and tuned up together before heading into the cockpit of our vehicle- tours were better that way. The kennel where the guests “dogs are boarded” doubled as a “last chance saloon.”… If those dogs could talk!\n\nLet’s not forget the bands that played The Universal Amphitheater, no rules apply where the Red Carpet connects to the “Green Room.” The holding area where Rock Stars anxiously wait to go on stage while downing expensive and hard to get liquors, pallets full of Heineken beer , and piles of white powder. All was provided and considered a must it this holding area.\n\nYou had to feel it -to sing it.\n\nI know I’ve been all over the Boat with this story and this iconic studio -but I’m never coming back here so lets- let it – all hang out-right! I’ve just been connecting lines and dots. I would soon get my invitation to party, not on a boat, but a tram that’s- as long as a boat.\n\nUniversal Studios hires me to be Captain of my own Ship… The Glamour Tram– All Aboard Ladies!\n\n“My head is spinning -go faster!”\n\nWritten and Lived by…Donnie Norden\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMaureen and I had to pay a final visit to show our respects and we ended up being the center a “Code 3.” The Burbank Police showed up after an irate guard threw a frenzy as we took pictures at the entrance.

One police car went inside the lot. I quickly concluded it’s time for Bonnie and Clyde to make for the getaway car. We hid behind the white truck before driving past this developing situation. We decided to cover our tracks, literally in a Pullman car at nearby Travel Town to process what just happened. It wouldn’t be the first time a Pullman car would provide a hideout for us. Calmly like the 63 year olds we are, we left the area with one final memory.

Famous for his Combat history at MGM, he also was the Director on The Phantom of Hollywood. A film the parallels my dealings at MGM in the beginning of the 70’s.

I disappeared to focus on my books. Out of the mist, under the cover of darkness-I’ve reappeared. The Uninvited Visitor is now available on Amazon.\n\nOn the One Hundredth Anniversary of MGM Studios, I’m proud to go back 50 years with my own stories and experiences at this legendary movie studio that ended up having a major impact on how my life would play out. The MGM Effect is real, I salute you MGM as I would any dear friend I’ve known so long. We shared so much fun together, you’re forever part of my DNA. From hundreds of tiny wooden slivers, a few small yet still distinguishable scars from cuts and stitches from long ago that required a few trips to the ER for repairs. And a tooth that broke and ripped through my lower lip while running through buildings on New York Street. That’s not counting several other…near misses!\n\nA third book detailing MGM’s final years 1977-80 will be my next and final installment. T.U.V will travel back through 1975/1976. A lot happened in these two years including my final stories involving Desilu as it disappears and literally becomes… Gone With the Wind.\n\nMeanwhile a blockbuster film titled King Kong moves in at MGM and that set becomes my home. I will take you to Skull Island. Climb the walls with me in a story titled Dark Side of the Moon. I even briefly go inside Kong as he arrives on the backlot. That story is titled…Welcome to the Machine.\n\nSo without further ado, sit back, relax, smoke a cigar and enjoy the show…it’s a 70’s Rock and Roll-experience, like no other. As MGM celebrates 100 today, lets trespass back in time to the most recent backlot no longer in existence.\n\nMy favorite books on MGM Studios. Arnold Gillespie was truly The Wizard. His career at MGM was so long that he worked on the original Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925) and its remake Ben-Hur (1959) and the original Mutiny on the Bounty (1935) and its remake Mutiny on the Bounty (1962). Buddy G. will explain how each challenging scene was put together and captured for eternity. When you finish this large book, you will have an engineering degree involving how movies are made. A tip of the hat to Mr. Robert Welch on such a marvelous presentation on his legendary grandfather.\n\nDear Pal- Steven Bingen captures a history both in pictures and interviews in his two hard covered books pictured here. Proudly, I’m part of “The MGM Effect,” no one ever was probably more “effected” than me in that fairy tailish wonderland I had the pleasure of growing up inside of.\n\nWarner Bros. Closes the Gates on what was a very special…backlot\n\nPretty amazing the final events that have taken place around this Burbank facility. The fact it’s so popular makes you wonder why tours were not offered in the Warner Studio Tour. This lot wasn’t always connected to Warners or TBS, it had rich history as Columbia Pictures. I am positive many historians would have flipped a hundred dollars for a final Curtain pulling event on this backlot.\n\nWho doesn’t love studio history-Studio executives -that’s who!\n\nMaureen and I have seen this movie before at- MGM, lots 2/3, and Desilu in Culver City. Now this legendary backlot all TV Land viewers have grown up inside of-has bitten the dust. The difference was the internet didn’t exist then and only we seemed to care. Apparently, this tear down spread like wild fire thanks to this cyber world we all now live in. You can’t rebuild it now and many things could have been auctioned and a more creative demolition or reimplementation in this land of captured memories. The park and fountain, and some wonderful mature trees who were part of all this backlots history could and should have been incorporated to respect the past in what will now be a concrete jungle of endless stages. A campus setting blending past, present and future- Not to be-thanks to contemporary visionaries.\n\nAt least MGM, RKO/Desilu and 20th Century Fox offered up incredible bargains of a historic nature. Desilu was like some circus that left town and not everything was packed on the train.\n\nBut not this place, not this legendary ranch “don’t even look inside or I’m calling the cops!”\n\n“Go ahead, just saying- Hi, is all” was how my exchange with security at Gate 11 began as Maureen and I paid our last visit.\n\nWhatever happened to the Ken Hollywoods of the world, security guards who double as legends themselves. The icons of MGM security, who wore bright smiles above shiny silver badges. Friends to movie stars and trespassers alike. Guards such as him who would introduce this impressionable teen ager to MGM’s legendary talent. Complete with decades of stories of how wonderful the magic of Hollywood touched all of us. Both those who wear shiny black shoes and those of us wearing worn out tennis shoes…we embraced history under that famous Lion logo.\n\nFor my third book which is in the works, ironically, I have a story that starts at this exact gate… Gate 11-Columbia Ranch. The story is Hooper, starring Burt Reynolds. Security, back in 1978, greets me and my actor friend Tim that morning, reminding us the speed limit and rules we should know. Tim was a bit actor in this and many other films.\n\nIf I followed every rule, we wouldn’t have all this content I present you. The Ten Commandments are the rules Maureen and I were taught to follow in our Catholic upbringing way back in our early years, we rationalized that trespassing isn’t specifically addressed as a sin in any one of those commandments. Never did we feel we were doing wrong…because this is not on Catholic school lists of sins.”…Thank God!\n\nLike a King and a Queen, we’ve sat in carriages used by movie royalty. We occupied Castles, steeples of every size and shape, including trying on left behind wardrobe from ancient times. From tree stumps with tunnels underneath to famous prisons, we became part of the dangerous landscape…literally. We kept finding things others who preceded us overlooked. Most recently, Marion Davies and her Divine spirit allowed me to rescue a vital link dating back to Hollywood’s earliest days. As if we were selected to pass on these magical heirlooms of motion picture history. We gratefully accept the challenge bestowed upon us. You can be anything you wish to be once inside these fences. These backlots were where we grew up, truly our “Home Sweet Home.”\n\nJanuary 3, 1981-we begin our rooftop story:\n\nThe Boys and I love a good challenge, my gang tonight are all good friends who have grown up together on movie backlots- along side me. You may recognize their names-Jimmy, Pat and Danny from previous adventures. Tonight, we’re going to do something special –trespass the Columbia Ranch at night. We have done Warner Brothers and Universal in the dark and of course the MGM lots and Desilu, but we’ve yet to tackle this 40 acre ranch.\n\nWe arrive by way of Jimmy’s square back VW and park in an empty parking lot behind a barb wire cage that protects Hollywood from onlookers. We sit momentarily staring at a sharply covered brick wall, Blondie sings “Call Me” on the radio and we get out the car and stand on our horseshoes. “They’ve added more barb wire since last visit” I point out. The four of us are sizing up the situation. Looking for the path of least resistance. We see a section of brick wall not wrapped in wire.\n\nThis is where the rubber meets the rode and in 30 seconds we are all now taking cover in near by bushes inside the backlot. We use a climbing method so simple it childish. One kid puts his hands together forming a cup, the next kid puts his foot in that cup and is lifted high enough to pull himself up to the top. Once there-that kid on top pulls the kid who boosted him upwards by his extended arms. It’s almost like cheating it’s so easy and quick. All you need is the right fence situation, meaning no sharp barbs or edges.\n\nWe lurk slowly towards Fantasy Island, which is as dark as you can get. We let our eyes turn into night vision goggles, on the look for the slightest movements. Employees move around in the daylight, but spirits travel at night. We fit right in.\n\nClocks are unnecessary since we have no where we need to go-we’re in exploration mode. We’ve all been here before and know certain sections better than others. It takes time to learn every square inch of a backlot-it took a couple years of “all the time visitations” to master the MGM backlot 2. The area we that attracts us is the rooftops on the tall New York Skylines. Weaving in between parked Police cars, ambulances, Army trucks, all boxed in tight formation like a Hot Wheels carrying case.\n\nAs tempting as it is to sit inside some of these unlocked picture cars from from various shows, it’s just not safe yet, that still needs to be determined. Roof tops will determine exactly what and where is safe. Soldier on…we continue behind buildings and through every kind of doorway possible, we arrive at the staircase that takes you 4 stories high where we can get a handle on what we may be in for tonight.\n\nMuch of this interior ascension upwards is in Braille- meaning you can’t see. Slowly proceed up each step, making sure- there is a step. Just because- it’s long fall the higher you go. The rooftop is our sanctuary. It overlooks the entire backlot, this set is in the middle of the backlot with very long distances in each direction to reach safety if being chased. Anythings possible, but no time to worry, rather time to celebrate…No risk-No reward moment!\n\nWe quickly light a joint and take in all our surroundings. A cold breeze blows off tiny sparks like fireflies towards our faces. You know- Danny’s high- when he goes into a music trance and everything becomes part of a Slingerland drum set. Everything…His lap, the wood he’s sitting on, and the guy he’s sitting next to are all make shift drum set pieces. Just the other night we enjoyed Buddy Rich on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Danny went completely nuts over this band leader, drummer extraordinaire as did Doc Severinsen. Buddy is the real deal. Rodney Dangerfield added humor as only he can deliver.\n\nJust 3 months ago, exactly where are car is parked tonight, the F.M radio dial, 95.5 KLOS informed us John Bonham, Led Zeppelin’s drummer, passed away. That afternoon we all trespassed this same wall… with very heavy hearts. I digress…\n\nStill up on the roof– Jimmy and I pass this Bomber doobie while game planning what to expect in tomorrows championship football game between the Raiders and the Browns, while Pat sits fixated on the picture cars below. He’s a trespassing Transportation Captain, specializing in cars that aren’t his. Pat and Danny have beards, and Pat has on a Fedora he picked up at MGM awhile back. Up on this roof we must look like an Allman Brothers record cover. The only thing missing are the instrument cases.\n\nWe can relax up here because we have the upper hand. No one knows we’re here, and we can see everywhere. There is always anxiety when – traversing in the backlot- since these studios are 24/7. Never take anything completely for granted but it appears tonight it’s just us. Very few lights are on and none where we choose to go.\n\nWe retrace the stairway back down and cross a paved street, passing a large circular fountain and square pool. We are a slingshot away now from the Dennis the Menace house now, which I enter for the first time at night. “I too- my little blonde friend- am extremely accurate with rubber band attached to a stick” I say as I open the front door. Just in case he’s hiding in here…\n\nIt’s always fun when a group of kids get in character when entering a set with a glorious past-we become that family that was …canceled!\n\nIn the dark, at ground level, the large buildings we were just on top of look so imposing. We have a tendency to compare sets we are on to other sets at other studios and that’s because…we’ve seen and touched them all. Both daytime and night time. The night winds down without any unwanted visitors or interventions as we quietly touch back down on the asphalt parking lot where this night began…\n\n40 years later here we are again…\n\nWe came to the guard shack with high hopes of sharing a little past history and perhaps getting a snapshot or two. We were appropriately dressed. She said I looked like I just stepped out of “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” and she was wearing her “C’mon Get Happy” Partridge Family t-shirt.\n\nCh-ch-changes… The former Columbia Ranch is now run by Warner Brothers. Columbia Pictures can now be found on the iconic and still standing MGM lot. Just the names changed. This backlot was entered off a street named Hollywood Way and was the best backlot still standing … it will truly be missed.\n\nI conclude this post with another picture drop presentation of my pictures tied into the past, from a couple of old folks who cherish places like this and will never forget all things we experienced inside. Put up all the cameras and barb wire you wish- but you can’t take our memories Warner Brothers.\n\nWritten and lived by Maureen Miller and Donnie Norden.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
