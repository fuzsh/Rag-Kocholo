        "text": "“Blessed are the cracked,” says Colby Cutler (Brendan Gleeson), menacing patriarch to a ragtag clan of thieving Irish travelers parked in a verdant swath of English countryside. He’s talking about Gordon (Sean Harris), a filthy lunatic whose relationship to the group is unclear. But he could be talking about his entire brood, whose marginal, scrabbling existence makes no sense at all.\n\nNeither does some of the dialogue i the first feature from Adam Smith, who might have considered using subtitles — at least when his robbers are wearing balaclavas. What we do hear, though, is pungent and colorful as Colby and his heir, Chad (Michael Fassbender), lock horns for control of Chad’s future. Illiterate and weary of wandering, Chad wants a better life for his two kids — you can tell because he has plastic covers on his couch — while Colby prefers to fill their heads with primitive beliefs and gutter yearnings.\n\nVeering from hard-man posturing to roguish whimsy, Mr. Fassbender anchors a story (by Alastair Siddons, who previously worked on a documentary about a clan like this) that’s more successful in texture than in logic. Stealing, racing and setting fire to random automobiles, the crew is a blight on the beauty around them. They’re like a scraggly bunch of bored adolescents.\n\nBut they’re also real, their decrepit campground and chafing interactions realized with rough authenticity. Though thematically vague, thinly plotted and without a reliably sympathetic soul to cling to, the movie has a mutinous energy and an absurd, knockabout charm; even its violence is more quirky than brutal. Like the Cutlers, it drifts and dreams, going nowhere and achieving nothing."
