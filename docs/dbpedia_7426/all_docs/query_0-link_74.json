        "text": "“THE past is a foreign country,” the novelist L. P. Hartley once wrote; “they do things differently there.” Like everything else in our brave new world this famous sentence, written 56 years ago, could use an update  or in movie terms, a remake. Because sometimes, as in R. W. Goodwin’s wacky new “Alien Trespass” (opening Friday), the past looks stranger than that. In “Alien Trespass,” which is set in 1957 and is both a parody of and a homage to the science-fiction films of that anxious era, the past seems like another planet.\n\nIt’s not just the weird extraterrestrial creatures running amok on Earth, sneaking up on decent, hard-working, small-town folks and reducing them to puddles of goo; we’re used to that. It isn’t even the aliens’ shiny spaceships, with their inexplicably powerful thrust and sinister but somehow festive blinking lights. What feels galactically remote in “Alien Trespass,” and in the half-century-old movies it evokes, is the people, the “ordinary” human beings whose existence is so direly imperiled by superior intelligences from far, far away.\n\nOddest of all are the scientists, our little species’ own homegrown superior intelligences, whose knowledge and mental capacity are often laughably unequal to understanding (much less defeating) the alien adversary. “Alien Trespass” has a character like that, a pipe-smoking astronomer, played by Eric McCormack, who tries to figure out what’s going on and for his trouble has his body appropriated by an extraterrestrial. This possessed scientist is a figure of fun, but it’s kind of touching that he’s in the movie at all; except for television’s many forensic pathologists, poring over runny cadavers, scientists as a type have mostly vanished from pop culture. It’s as if they’d been abducted.\n\nIn Byron Haskin’s “War of the Worlds” (1953), for example, the hero is an eminent nuclear physicist, played by Gene Barry; in Steven Spielberg’s more elaborate (and more frightening) 2005 remake, the protagonist  played by the distinctly unscientific-looking Tom Cruise  is a crane operator. When the aliens attack in the 21st-century version of “War of the Worlds,” there’s no one around to supply explanations, theories and plans of action, to stare with furrowed brow at exotic instruments and make complex calculations, to consult with military leaders and heads of government, or even to issue somber pronouncements on the fate of the human race. And without any of that earnest stuff, all that’s left is running and screaming.\n\nWhich have their place. But that place is in horror, where the threats to our well-being are impervious to reason, unconquerable by the highest mathematics. Science fiction often verges on horror, and did so even in the ’50s, in pictures like Christian Nyby and Howard Hawks’s “Thing From Another World” (1951) and Don Siegel’s “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” (1956). Yet there was always at least the hope that a bit more knowledge might save the day, a modicum of faith in the power of the mind to vanquish monsters.\n\nIt’s that seriousness of purpose that makes ’50s science fiction a fitting subject for both nostalgia and parody  as it is, simultaneously, in “Alien Trespass.” This seriousness has a character very particular to its moment in history. You can’t help being struck, as you watch the sci-fi epics of the first half of 1950s, by how strongly they bear the imprint of the world war that ended less than 10 years before, and the cold war that showed no sign of ending soon.\n\nA good many of the best films of the time have a powerfully martial aura: armies are mobilized, strategies decided upon in urgent, hushed conferences, with charts. Rudolph Maté’s “When Worlds Collide” (1951) speculates on the destruction of Earth by a planet that passes too close, and many of the images of the mass evacuation of cities and their eventual annihilation are, startlingly, taken from newsreels of wartime Europe; the 1953 “War of the Worlds” also makes use of those all-too-real pictures of human devastation, to portray the effects of a Martian invasion.\n\nThe feeling that the end of the world has been narrowly averted, and remains a fairly lively possibility, does tend to focus the mind. The ’50s had their share of space operas, like Fred Wilcox’s wonderful 1956 “Forbidden Planet” (based, improbably, on “The Tempest”), but the alien-invasion movies are more resonant and much, much more intense.\n\nThe original “Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” does a nifty job of wrapping several of the age’s deepest anxieties into a single scary metaphor: people fall asleep and wake up different, their individual bodies taken over by a kind of collective unhuman consciousness. This extreme-alien-makeover motif is, among other things, an ingenious solution to the stubbornest problem of low-budget sci-fi: namely the variable quality of the acting. It saves a ton on special effects too.\n\nBut the genius of the “Body Snatchers” metaphor (the movie is based on a story by Jack Finney) is that it combines the ’50s anxiety about the end of humankind with the era’s equally persistent fears about the toxic effects of mass movements: the Nazism and Fascism that had so recently come close to blowing up the world, the Soviet-style Communism that looked, from these shores, intent on finishing the job. There’s a warning here too about the creeping pressure to conform in our own prosperous middle-class society.\n\nThese are useful cautions because, as all these movies show, belief in authority of one kind or another  including the authority of science  was considerably stronger in that age than in the present day, when few leaders are trusted, and the word “expert” is almost invariably preceded by “so-called.” It’s this greater credulity that makes people in ’50s science-fiction films seem so far from us now  familiar but distant, unreachable, like the selves we were as children.\n\nWe all, I think, feel a small tug of childlike idealism watching a movie like Robert Wise’s “Day the Earth Stood Still” (1951), in which the noble alien Klaatu arrives on Earth to save us from destroying ourselves; he’s like a teacher or a priest or a rabbi, one of those authority figures we once upon a time believed in. Or even a scientist. The centrality of that profession in ’50s genre films was probably inevitable given the role of science in bringing World War II to its conclusion. But that conclusion was painful, even horrific, as the Japanese science-fiction movies, like “Godzilla” (1954), clearly demonstrate. American and British genre films feature both good scientists and bad; you can tell the dangerous ones by their goatees.\n\nAnd occasionally there is one who accurately reflects our ambivalence about reason and science, like the gentle-natured intellectual played by George Sanders in Wolf Rilla’s superb “Village of the Damned” (1960), who finds himself the guardian of an extraterrestrial son and tries  foolishly, tragically  first to learn from him and then to teach him. “Village of the Damned” has its own specific resonances: the alien child and his alien playmates are blond and affectless, like Hitler Youth, and the scientist’s attempts to understand them are doomed from the start.\n\nBut it’s hard not to be moved by his efforts, futile though they are; they’re evidence of a humanity that glassy children, big-headed aliens, radioactive slimes and the like might have some difficulty destroying. Every now and then it’s nice to go back in time and see the world differently, to watch the skies with the eyes of our bygone selves."
