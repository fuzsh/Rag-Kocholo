        "text": "3.5\n\n(4)\n\nIn this drama, a frustrated upper-class writer decides that he will find real inspiration by examining his subjects first-hand. This leads him to begin wandering about the seamiest side of town where he witnesses a murder. When an innocent man is arrested, the writer refuses to assist him as the knowledge that he has been “slumming” could destroy his career. The young man is sentenced to 15 years in prison. Upon his release, he hears his own story in a radio drama written by the author. This enables the ex-con to get the necessary evidence to clear his name.\n\nDirectors: Alberto Cavalcanti.\n\nStars: Richard Todd, Patricia Plunkett, Stephen Murray, Michael Laurence, Vida Hope, Rosalyn Boulter, James Hayter, Harry Fowler, George Hayes, Michael Brennan, Joan Dowling, Michael Medwin, Mary Merrall, Irene Handl, Helen Cherry, Harcourt Williams, Ian Fleming, George Hayes, James Hayter."
