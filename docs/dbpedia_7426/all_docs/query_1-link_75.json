        "text": "Michael Fassbender is an actor in an ideal position right now. He’s got the pick of the litter in terms of scripts and projects, and they are all being delivered to his doorstep. Is he an A-list star that can open a movie big? Not yet, but that likely doesn’t concern him right now (that’s his agent’s problem). What matters to the actor is that he’s working with the Terrence Malicks and Ridley Scotts of the world and he is one of the most sought-after actors in Hollywood at the moment.\n\nAnd so while he can star in whatever big power project he wants, instead Fassbender’s next film will be a heist thriller film set in Ireland with a largely U.K. cast—an illustration that while he will join franchises like “X-Men” and “Prometheus,” he’s always going to mix that up with character-driven work.\n\nTitled “Trespass Against Us,” ScreenDaily reports that the film will shoot this summer, and joining the cast is Brendan Gleeson, Rory Kinnear (“Skyfall”), Lyndsey Marshal (“The Hours”), Sean Harris (“Prometheus”) and Killian Scott (“Calvary”).\n\n“Tresspass Against Us” is set across three generations of the rowdy Cutler family, who live as outlaws, hunting hares, ram-raiding stately homes and taunting the police. As the letter of the law finally catches up with Chad (Fassbender), he is torn between the archaic principles of his father (Gleeson) and what he believes is best for his children."
