Directed by Schumacher who is the director behind such largely mediocre product like FLAWLESS, ST. ELMO’S FIRE, THE LOST BOYS, FLATLINERS, BATMAN FOREVER, BATMAN & ROBIN, PHONE BOOTH, THE NUMBER 23, & others. I did like his FALLING DOWN & BLOOD CREEK was a terrific horror film with a top-notch cast but in this one he adds nothing to the recent onslaught of home invasion films. It was lovely to look at and Cage & Kidman (both of whom might consider changing agents after getting so many run-of-the-mill roles) strut their talents with the little they have to work with. And Gigandet, so gorgeous to look at, after gracing such bombs as BURLESQUE & THE ROOMMATE, might want to consider that looks don’t last forever. Here’s a film that cost $35 million (I’d really love to examine the books on this one) but was never released. Cage plays a super-wealthy (or so we’re led to believe) businessman who’s on the verge of closing a huge diamond deal. He arrives at home during a quarrel between his wife and daughter. The girl wants to go off to a posh party but her mother insists she can’t go. The girl later sneaks out of the big mansion they live in and while the Millers are home alone they are raided by a group of thieves posing as security personnel. What follows is a series of betrayals and deception none of which make much sense. The daughter unfortunately does return from that party. Every five minutes I kept questioning character’s actions, finally dismissing the absurdly contrived ending. Still it was rather fun to watch and Cage & Kidman have some fun with their histrionic roles. But for a film with this cost to premiere at a major international film festival a big release has generally already been planned. So what happened? 2 1/2 cats”"
