        "text": "A real slice of Hollywood history is now on the market: The home that Lucille Ball moved into after signing to RKO Pictures in 1933.\n\nThen just 22, the future star of sitcom 'I Love Lucy' took up residence in 1344 North Ogden Drive, a 1,874sqft, two-bedroom home that was soon inhabited by her whole family, who followed her out from New York to Los Angeles.\n\nThat caused problems when her grandfather used it as a meeting place for his Communist Party pals, nearly crashing her career. Now the place is on the market - minus the Communists, but overflowing with early 20th century charm.\n\nSitting on a 6,751sqft lot with front and back yards, the 1919 bungalow is built in the American Craftsman style, which emphasized simplicity and craftsmanship, using locally sourced materials to provide open, elegant homes for a fast-growing populace.\n\nThe front yard is the very picture of a turn-of-the-century LA home, with its wide porch, cluster of palm trees and gently beveled edges.\n\nAnd inside is even prettier: large windows on all sides and a mostly open-plan first floor mean that the gorgeous LA sun fills the whole house.\n\nAn attractive wooden fireplace provides a center feature of the living room area, which then flows via a wide open doorway into the dining room, and in turn an open-plan kitchen with a mini breakfasting area.\n\nModern conveniences like a huge fridge are hidden behind classic-looking wooden panels to maintain the period atmosphere, while German green-stone fittings add a touch of gravitas to the proceedings.\n\nThat's offset somewhat by the unique chandeliers and lighting fixtures, which add a little of the quirkiness that Ball would later come to be loved for.\n\nAnd despite being a bungalow, there's still an impressive amount of space to stretch out, with an office area ideal for aspiring - or accomplished - Hollywood writers.\n\nGorgeous wooden flooring bring the whole thing together, adding extra warmth to the cosy home.\n\nThe home has two bedrooms, with the ground floor room opening directly onto the wooden rear patio - perfect for those who like to roll out of bed and into the fresh air as fast as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, the second bedroom comfortably houses a queen-size bed and overlooks the historic Spaulding Square neighborhood.\n\nAnd a beautiful white-tiled bathroom - one two - with gold fixtures brings an extra touch of class to morning ablutions.\n\nThe rear porch not only provides plenty of space for sun loungers, it also has a hot tub for added luxury.\n\nIf you have a hankering for fresh fruit, lime, lemon and avocado trees in the rear yard will keep you well-stocked - and the garage in the back means you won't have to go far to reach your car if you run out.\n\nAll in all, it's quite the package. And while Ball ultimately left the home after her career took flight, it does remain a key part of Hollywood history."
