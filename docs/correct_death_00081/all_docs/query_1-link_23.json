        "text": "Lucille Ball, the beloved star of I Love Lucy, died 35 years ago on April 26, 1989. Yet her legacy — as both a comedic actress and through her body of television work — remains a cultural touchstone more than 75 years since the groundbreaking sitcom made its debut. Who among us doesn't recall Lucy stomping grapes, stuffing her face with chocolate or being the first openly pregnant character on American television?\n\nMUST-READ: Behind-the-Scenes Secrets of the 10 Funniest I Love Lucy Episodes\n\nHer career did not stop when I Love Lucy ended its run in 1957, Lucille Ball continuing to work until close to her death. She starred in the critically acclaimed TV movie drama The Stone Pillow in 1985 followed by her final sitcom, 1986's Life with Lucy. In so doing, she became one of only a handful of women whose Hollywood careers have spanned more than five decades, encompassing radio, stage, television and film.\n\nBeyond her achievements in the public eye, Lucille Ball was also revered by her loving family, which includes two children and five grandchildren, all of whom are public figures. Below is a closer look at their relationship and accomplishments.\n\nWho are Lucille Ball's children?\n\nLucille Ball had two children with her late husband, Desi Arnaz. Desi, of course, portrayed Ricky Ricardo on I Love Lucy, co-starring alongside his wife. The two would divorce in 1960 with the actress marrying comedian Gary Morton a year later. She would go on to star in the series The Lucy Show (1962 to 1968) and Here's Lucy (1968 to 1974).\n\nLucille and Desi’s children are Lucie Arnaz, born in 1951, and Desi Arnaz Jr., born in 1953. Both Lucie and Desi Jr. had successful careers, following in their parents' footsteps.\n\nMUST-READ: Desi Arnaz — I Love Lucy Biographer Remembers 'The Prince of Cuba' (EXCLUSIVE)\n\nLucie Arnaz\n\nLucie Arnaz is an actress and singer with a long and successful career in the entertainment industry. She got her start by making a few short appearances on The Lucy Show, but really made her acting debut as a cast member of Here's Lucy.\n\nBetween a 1972 episode of The Sixth Sense and a 2020 installment of Will & Grace, she made about a dozen guest appearances and TV movies. Additionally, she was the star of The Lucie Arnaz Show (1985) and Sons and Daughters (1991), and appeared in numerous stage shows, beginning with 1973's Once Upon a Mattress and including 11 others prior to 2014's Pippin.\n\nBeyond all of this, Lucie released her debut album, Just in Time, in 1993, and has since recorded multiple singles. In terms of awards and recognition, she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 1981 for her performance in The Jazz Singer.\n\nShe was married to Philip Vandervort Menegaux from 1971 to 1976, and has been married to actor Laurence Luckinbill since 1980. She's the mother of three.\n\nMUST-READ: William Frawley — 15 Facts About the Beloved I Love Lucy and My Three Sons Star\n\nDesi Arnaz Jr.\n\nThe birth of Desi Arnaz Jr was heralded as a major event — the day he was born, Lucy Ricardo gave birth to \"Little Ricky\" on I Love Lucy. Both arrivals created a media and pop culture sensation!\n\nDrawn to music, at the age of 12 he became the drummer for a band named Dino, Desi & Billy, which, in 1965, had hit singles in the form of \"I'm a Fool\" and \"Not the Lovin' Kind.\"\n\nBeyond Here's Lucy, in which he co-starred with his mother and sister, he could be seen on episodes of The Mothers-in-Law (produced and directed by Desi Sr), The Brady Bunch and The Streets of San Francisco.\n\nThere would also be roles in such films as Red Sky at Morning (1973), for which he received a Golden Globe for New Star of the Year; Billy Two Hats (1974), Joyride (1977), Fake Out (1982), House of the Long Shadows (1983) and The Mambo Kings (1992), in which he played his father.\n\nAlthough he had been in highly publicized relationships with Patty Duke and Liza Minelli, he married actress Linda Purl in 1979, the two of them getting divorced a year later; and Amy Laura Bargiel in 1987 until her death from cancer in 2015. He's the father of two.\n\nMUST-READ: Vivian Vance and Lucille Ball Didn't Hit It Off Right Away — And Almost Weren't the Comedy Duo We Know and Love\n\nWhat do we know about Lucille Ball's grandchildren?\n\nNow that we've covered Lucille Ball's children, let's take a look at the lives of her five grandchildren:\n\nKatharine Luckinbill: Lucille Ball, Her Grandchildren\n\nParents: Lucie Arnaz and Laurence Luckinbill\n\nBirthdate: January 11, 1985\n\nKatharine Luckinbill is the daughter of Lucie Arnaz and Laurence Luckinbill (he played Mr. Spock's half-brother Sybok in the 1989 film Star Trek V: The Final Frontier). Although she dabbled in acting (most notably in the 2015 film College Debts), she left it to become a recruiting specialist.\n\nWith her former experience in the industry, she is an expert at helping professionals from all disciplines to find their purpose. Katharine is passionate about helping others reach their goals and building lasting relationships through meaningful work.\n\nBeyond this, she serves as the head of creative direction for new business, products and social media for Desilu, Too, LLC. This company was created by her parents to handle the estates of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. Katharine is a part of \"The Lucy Legacy,\" which is designed to keep I Love Lucy and its characters relevant in the 21st century and beyond, while also driving home the importance of Ms. Ball herself.\n\n\"She did not set out to become anyone's icon or influencer,\" Katharine explained at the time of the project's announcement. \"She always did her homework, studied her lines, and showed up ready to do the work. That is the legacy she left women: show up, do the work, be the best, don't take no for an answer. That way, no one can ignore you.\"\n\nJoseph Luckinbill: Lucille Ball, Her Grandchildren\n\nParents: Lucie Arnaz and Laurence Luckinbill\n\nBirthdate: December 31, 1982\n\nJoseph Luckinbill is a guitarist and composer who has performed at numerous venues, among them Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl. Here's how he describes himself on his LinkedIn page:\n\n\"Audio engineer, musician, composer, performer and teacher. Teaching 16+years in shops, schools and online with Lessons Sites ... Funk band called Plasm that plays all original music written, recorded, mixed and mastered by myself. I have six full length albums on all streaming services and I'm a music junkie.\"\n\nSimon Luckinbill: Lucille Ball, Her Grandchildren\n\nParents: Lucie Arnaz and Laurence Luckinbill\n\nBirthdate: December 10, 1980\n\nSimon Luckinbill is the oldest son of Lucie Arnaz and Laurence Luckinbill. An accomplished visual artist, he has a passion for giving back from his net worth, which is evident in his involvement with various charities.\n\nNotes briefly.co.za, \"The California native is a successful artist whose artworks are acrylics on canvas. In 2016, his masterpiece, The Show, Flea on a Hot Rock, was exhibited at Gallery 500. Over 50 percent of his works were sold out during this exhibition in less than 90 minutes.\"\n\nHaley Arnaz: Lucille Ball, Her Grandchildren\n\nParents: Desi Arnaz and Amy Laura Bargiel\n\nBirthdate: December 17th, 1976\n\nHaley Arnaz is the youngest child of Desi Arnaz Jr. and Amy Arnaz. Born in Los Angeles and raised in Santa Barbara, Haley is a ballet dancer who trained at the Joffrey Ballet Academy before dancing professionally.\n\nHer performance credits include roles in productions of Swan Lake, The Nutcracker and Giselle. She has also done ballet for film and television and has taught it as well.\n\nJulia Arnaz: Lucille Ball, Her Grandchildren\n\nParents: Desi Arnaz\n\nBirthdate: Unknown\n\nJulia Arnaz is another granddaughter of the legendary Lucille Ball, becoming aware of their connection through DNA test results.\n\nJulia's father, Desi Arnaz Jr, stated in a 2019 interview, \"I had no idea Julia was actually my daughter until DNA testing confirmed it.\" Julia has since made frequent public appearances and often speaks fondly of her grandmother, saying \"She was a very unique person in the industry; she changed the face of television.\"\n\nIn addition to their grandchildren, Lucille and Desi also had a great-granddaughter, Desiree Anzalone. Tragically, this daughter of Desi Arnaz Jr passed away due to breast cancer in 2020.\n\nWe really do love Lucy\n\nLucille Ball was truly one of a kind — an influential comedic genius whose legacy will not soon be forgotten by the public or her loving family. From actors and singers to artists and business professionals, her grandchildren are as unique as she was and there’s no doubt that Lucille Ball's legacy will live on through them."
