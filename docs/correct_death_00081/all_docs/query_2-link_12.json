        "text": "Lucille Ball\n\nLucille Ball: Not the Girl Next Door\n\nThis exhibit highlights Lucille Ball’s early years in Jamestown and Celoron, her many trips home throughout her career, and rarely seen photographs that were taken by her friend Marion Strong VanVlack.\n\nThe photos show a touching, and human aspect of this internationally loved comedienne. Born on August 6, 1911, at home at 60 Stewart Avenue, Jamestown, New York, Lucille has often reflected upon fond memories spent in this area. Most of Lucille’s childhood was spent in Celoron, New York. Here the excitement of Celoron Park surrounded her, planting seeds for her future career.\n\nLucille made four notable visits to the area: one in 1933, in 1944 when “Grampa” Hunt died (also tying in a campaign to sell war bonds), in 1946, and in 1956 when her film Forever Darling premiered at Dipson’s Palace Theater. She was scheduled to come again to receive an honorary diploma from Jamestown Community College in 1989, but succumbed on April 26, following heart surgery.\n\nLooking for more about Lucille Ball?
