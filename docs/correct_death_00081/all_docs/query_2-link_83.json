        "text": "There is a wonderful, magical museum tucked away in the far western corner of New York State that is a must-see for people of all ages, but especially for Baby Boomers.\n\nBest Museums in New York\n\nThe Lucy-Desi Museum in Jamestown, NY (Chautauqua County) is a fantastic treasure trove of memorabilia and memories of America's favorite star, Lucille Ball. She was born in Jamestown and is buried in the city's Lake View Cemetery.\n\nThe museum welcomes tens of thousands of visitors from all over the world each year. There are dozens of museum exhibits, hundreds of archival photographs, and an uncountable number of fascinating pieces of Lucy-Desi artifacts. You can see Lucy's Emmy Awards, many old video clips, her stage costumes, her sets from the old \"I Love Lucy\" show, her jewelry, and much more. You will also see tributes along the way to her friends and co-stars Vivian Vance, William Frawley, and husband Desi Arnaz.\n\nYou can even see Lucy's own car! It is a gold-plated Mercedes Benz 280 SE, with a sunroof! The car was bequeathed to her son-in-law, Laurence Luckinbill, when she died and he donated it to the museum. It is a show-stopper!\n\nThere are many public events held at the museum each year and they are all very well attended!\n\nCheck out the photos in this gallery and take a trip down Memory Lane with the star we all loved, Lucille Ball!\n\n(Note: Jamestown also hosts the National Comedy Center, which we will feature in a future post)"
