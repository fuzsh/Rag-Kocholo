        "text": "This past Tuesday marked the 102nd anniversary of the birth of Lucille Ball, a veteran of television, film, radio, and stage. Her most notable role, Lucy Ricardo in I Love Lucy (1951-1957), became one of the most well-known and adored characters in television history, and turned Lucille Ball into a household name who continues to entertain generations of people worldwide. She has received a countless number of accolades, including winning four Emmy Awards (Best Comedienne, 1952 and Best Actress in a continuing Performance, 1955 for I Love Lucy, and Outstanding Continuing Performance by an Actress in a leading Role in a Comedy Series, 1967 and 1968 for The Lucy Show), being the first female inductee into the Television Academy’s Hall of Fame and later being inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame in 2001, receiving a Lifetime Achievement Citation from the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1986, and being posthumously honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1989.\n\nLucille Desiree Ball was born on August 6, 1911 in Jamestown, NY. Her father, Henry, died when she was three years old, so she was raised by her mother, Desiree, a concert pianist, and her maternal grandparents. Her grandparents instilled in her both a commitment to hard work and a love for the theater. She began performing in school plays as a child and decided to pursue a show business career at age 15. As a blonde and under the stage name, Diane Belmont, she tried her luck as a Broadway chorus girl during the 1920s. She had some brief luck in this endeavor but was ultimately fired from four different shows. She was repeatedly told by people in the industry and acting coaches that she should give up because she did not have enough talent. This did not deter her, however, and after illness prohibited her from working for a period of two to three years, she returned to New York City, looking for work under her own name. She took various jobs modeling in department stores, which eventually landed her a Cigarette Girl gig in Chesterfield Cigarette’s national advertising posters in 1933.\n\nBall’s stint as Cigarette Girl led to her being cast later that year as a Goldwyn Girl in the film, Roman Scandals – the start of her Hollywood career. She made most of the over 70 films in which she appeared throughout her career during the 1930s and 1940s, under contracts with Columbia, RKO, and MGM. Ball fared well in many B-movies, but failed to receive a breakout screen role that could launch her career. Forever trying to reinvent herself during this period, she took on many different types of roles and changed her look from blonde bombshell to the fiery red hair that later became synonymous with her. From 1947 to 1951, she took on radio, starring as the ditzy housewife in the CBS show, My Favorite Husband. Upon its venture into the burgeoning industry, CBS asked Ball to recreate her character in My Favorite Husband for television. Ball agreed but only if Desi Arnaz could play her onscreen spouse, Ricky. CBS initially said no, thinking American audiences would not be able to accept Cuban-born Arnaz and his accent as Ball’s husband, despite the fact that they were married in real life. Ball and Arnaz offered to tour as a husband and wife vaudeville act throughout the summer of 1950 to prove to CBS that audiences would want to watch them. After the success of their vaudeville show, CBS agreed to shoot a pilot for what would become I Love Lucy."
