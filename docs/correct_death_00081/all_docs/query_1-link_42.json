        "text": "Biography\n\nLucille DÃ©sirÃ©e Ball (born 6 August 1911), known as Lucille Ball, was a talented American model and actress. She is most remembered for her memorable performance in the sitcom I Love Lucy.\n\nFirst and foremost, she was a businesswoman, model, singer, actress, and perfectionist. She encountered difficulties in her early years as she frequently relocated due to unfavorable circumstances.\n\nLucille Ball was a self-assured and aspirational young woman who never bowed down in the face of adversity. Still, she always rose to pursue her goals with greater vigor and resolve than before. Throughout her career, she worked as a model for several companies and as an actress in numerous sitcoms, Broadway musicals, and motion pictures.\n\nHer most well-known work was playing the role of a housewife named Lucy in the popular 1950s sitcom I Love Lucy. Everyone praised the program; it was a big hit and provided new directions and concepts for future sitcoms.\n\nLucille Ball and her husband founded Desilu, a film production firm, and she was the first woman to lead it. She was a free spirit who worked tirelessly and with great hope to achieve her goals. She was consistently devoted to her craft and will be remembered for her exceptional and true performances in films and sitcoms.\n\nLucille Ball Lucille Ball: History â§ Bio â§ PhotoWiki Facts & About DataFull Name:Lucille DÃ©sirÃ©e BallStage Name:Lucille BallBorn:6 August 1911 (age 77 years old)Place of Birth:Jamestown, New York, United StatesDied:26 April 1989, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, United StatesNationality:AmericanHeight:1.71 mParents:Henry Durrell Ball, Dede BallSiblings:Fred BallHusband â¢ Spouse:Gary Morton (m. 1961â1989), Desi Arnaz (m. 1940â1960)Boyfriend â¢ Partner:N/AChildren:Desi Arnaz, Lucie ArnazOccupation:Actress â¢ TV PersonalityNet Worth:$40 million-$80 million\n\nEarly Life & Education\n\nHenry Durrell Ball, a telephone lineman for the Bell Telephone Company, and Dede Ball welcomed Lucille Ball into the world on August 6, 1911, in Jamestown, New York, United States. Fred Ball was one of her brothers.\n\nRead Also!!\n\nWhen she was three years old, her father, Henry Durrell Ball, died from typhoid, leaving the family defenseless. She remembered the day her father passed quite clearly since it was also the day she developed an orthorhombic phobia after seeing a bird trapped in her home.\n\nThey moved in with her maternal grandparents in New York after Lucille Ballâs father passed away, and her mother, Dede Ball, got work at a nearby factory. Her mother wed Edward Peterson and moved to another city without children in search of a job.\n\nIt was a difficult period for the grandparents and both children, who were cared for by Edward Petersonâs Swedish parents. Lucille Ball rebelled because her grandparents put boundaries on her. Another unfortunate incident occurred in 1927 when her brother unintentionally shot a neighbor boy, paralyzing him.\n\nAs a result, her grandfather was sued and was forced to sell his home to pay the damages. Lucille Ball attended the John Murray Anderson School for the Dramatic Arts the same year, but Betty Davis, a brilliant pupil, overshadowed her.\n\nLucille Ballâs mother received a letter from the school telling her not to waste money because her daughter has no future in this sector.\n\nCareer\n\nLucille Ball adopted Diane Belmont as her stage name in 1928 and began modeling for Hattie Carnegie. When she contracted rheumatic fever and could not work for the following two years, she had a promising career ahead of her. She resumed her modeling career for Hattie Carnegie in 1932 after overcoming the illness, and she also took up the role of the Chesterfield cigarette girl.\n\nIn 1933, she moved to Hollywood to pursue her acting career. She starred in several B-rated films, earning the nickname Queen of the Bâs. The Three Musketeers (1935), Stage Door (1937), Room Service (1938), Too Many Girls (1940), and The Big Street (1940) are a few of her more well-known films.\n\nLucille Ballâs husband convinced her to work in radio and television, and she was given the main role in the 1948â1951 CBS radio series My Favorite Husband. Later, CBS approached her with the offer to adapt it for television. She seized the chance and demanded to collaborate on the project with her real-life husband, Desi Arnaz.\n\nLucille Ball and her husband established Desilu Productions, and in association with CBS, the program was transformed into I Love Lucy. She laid the groundwork for comedy, which eventually inspired succeeding generations when the show debuted in 1951 and was an enormous success.\n\nShe worked in several movies, sitcoms, and Broadway musicals after the 1957 finale of the show. In 1986, Lucille Ball made her final appearance in the sitcom Life With Lucy, which was canceled after only a few episodes.\n\nAwards & Achievements\n\nLucille Ball received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.\n\nShe became the first female recipient of the Gold Medal from the International Radio and Television Society in 1971.\n\nShe was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Womenâs International Centerâs Living Legacy Award in 1989, both posthumously.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nLucille Ball met the Cuban bandleader Desi Arnaz in 1940, and they both acted in the B-movie Dance, Girl, Dance. They both fell in love with him, and they later wed.\n\nDue to her work, which required her to travel constantly during the first few years of their marriage, they could not stay together. She requested a divorce in 1944 but made amends with her spouse.\n\nLucille Ball suffered losses in 1942, 1949, and 1950 before giving birth to Lucie Arnaz in 1951. Desi Arnaz Jr., their second child, was born on January 19, 1953. She filed for divorce from Desi Arnaz in 1960, alleging the union had been a nightmare for her throughout that time.\n\nLucille Ball wed stand-up comedian Gary Morton in 1961, and they remained together until her passing. After having heart surgery for an aortic rupture, she experienced acute back pain on April 26, 1989, and shortly after that, she passed out.\n\nRead Also!!\n\nLucille Ball passed away shortly after; it was later determined that her death was caused by an unconnected second abdominal aortic rupture. Her grandchildren are Katharine Luckinbill, Haley Arnaz, Simon Luckinbill, Julia Arnaz, and Joseph Luckinbill.\n\nFilmography\n\nI Love Lucy (1953)\n\nTop Hat (1935)\n\nStage Door (1937)\n\nKid Millions (1934)\n\nThree Little Pigskins (1934)\n\nYours, Mine and Ours (1968)\n\nRoman Scandals (1933)\n\nThe Long, Long Trailer (1953)\n\nThe Whole Townâs Talking (1935)\n\nFollow the Fleet (1936)\n\nNet Worth\n\nAccording to the Gazette Review, Lucille Ball had a net worth of $40 million, which equals about $80 million today.\n\nSocial Media\n\nInstagram: @/luciearnazofficial\n\nWebsite: www.luciearnazofficial.com\n\nPost Your Contents & More On TheCityCeleb\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnKCtsZOauaaujZympmeSnryovsCpn7Jnk5q5pq7RoquyZ5GYwbOx0qxmpa2TnrmtsYybmKWkXZe2sLPRmqehsV2WtKZ5wpqsrJ1dpLNusMSaq6FlnprBbsPOq6uhZZiqwKOtzZ1knKCZobGzsc1mn56hl53BbrnOr6Ceq12pw26%2Fx6iurGWXp66vsMKhoKWcopq7brzHqKuoq18%3D\n\nncG1vNJzZmiZn6jBsK%2FKomWbpJ%2BXe6S70Z5lsKGemby4v42nnK1nmKS5rcXWqKadoJWWwbit1Z6uoqqVZLm2r8ilo55lkpa5rXnBoqagqpGltbp5wKCcZpuRqsCmec6fZJ2dkam1brrErWSwp6KptW601KyZmqaUYrCptcudqZ6mXZ2yqrPHrWSmp6aesrR5069krKCfrMBvtNOmow%3D%3D"
