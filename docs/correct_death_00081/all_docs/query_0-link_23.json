        "text": "Call it ‘I Live Lucy.’\n\nThe first Los Angeles home of beloved actress and comedienne Lucille Ball has hit the market for $1.75 million.\n\nThe queen of sitcoms first rented the humble home in 1933, at age 22 after signing her first studio deal. The contract, a small role in the RKO Pictures musical comedy Roman Scandals, prompted her to head west from New York with her entire family. So along with her mother, brother, and grandfather, Lucy squeezed into the modest two-bedroom, two-bathroom home.\n\nThe house is no 623 East 68th Street – but 1344 N. Ogden Drive still exudes the charisma that Lucy was so cherished for. Built in 1919, the century-old bungalow has obviously been renovated, but much of the craftsman-style charm still remains.\n\nThe 1,874-square-foot house, situated in the historic Spaulding Square neighborhood, is a quintessential turn-of-the-century Los Angeles home with its wide veranda and shady palm trees.\n\nThe open design—with oversized windows and many glass doors—allows the sun to stream in. With a living and dining room that flow seamlessly into each other, the cozy house has an airy feel.\n\nHardwood floors and crown molding line the whole home, while a wooden fireplace pulls the living room together.\n\nThe kitchen, embellished with German Green stone, is modernized by a stainless-steel fridge dressed with wood doors. The wooden touches, along with a cute breakfast area, helps maintain the period atmosphere.\n\nThe kitchen-dining space opens into a bright backyard, dotted with avocado and lemon trees around the deck.\n\nLittle hints of Ball’s quirkiness – chandeliers with character, white bathroom tiles with gold accents – offer odes of the the early 20th century.\n\nThe spacious master suite packs in a lot: besides a sleeping area, an office nook and dressing space are sectioned off around the corner.\n\nA bedroom with a view, the large French doors let in plenty of light and also lead to a patio with a hot tub.\n\nOnce Ball’s career took off, she moved into her own apartment. Her family still occupied the residence, though, and her grandfather Fred Hunt continued to host Communist Party meetings there. Ball’s potential Red connection would cause some trouble for the legendary redhead in Joe McCarthy's America , but she ultimately escaped unscathed.\n\nThe Emmy and Golden Globe-winning actress finally moved into a lavish Beverly Hills estate with her husband, Desi Arnaz, with whom she created and starred in I Love Lucy for nine years, ending in 1960. Their 1000 North Roxbury Drive residence sat on the star-studded street occupied by other icons like Jack Benny, Jimmy Stewart, and Rosemary Clooney. Ball eventually passed away in that home at age 77."
