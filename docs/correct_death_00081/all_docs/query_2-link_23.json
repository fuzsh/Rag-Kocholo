        "text": "There are also three photos (downloaded from the internet). One dates from 1919, the year before Lucy moved to the house, and is a photo of her class at the 8th Street School in downtown Jamestown (not 8th St. in Celoron):\n\nLucy is in the middle row, 5th from the right.\n\nThe second photo is an enlargement of the portion showing Lucy:\n\nThe third is a photo of Grandpa and Grandma:\n\nWe sent copies of the photos of Lucy and her grandparents to an artist friend of ours, Chuck Dransfield, who found photos of DeDe and Fred Ball; we commissioned him to paint the family portraits that hang in the parlor:\n\nFor a letter from Dransfield to me that provides the sources of the portraits of DeDe and Fred, along with some insight on his painting process, link here.\n\nOn the table in the center of the room, surrounded by souvenirs from the amusement park and elsewhere in Western NY, is a display case on top of which is a page from an 1881 Chautauqua County atlas showing the James Prendergast Library Building on the corner of Main and 3rd St. in downtown Jamestown:\n\nThe original Prendergast Building.\n\nThe horse and buggy are driving south on Main St.\n\nAhlstrom Pianos has their showroom on 3rd St.\n\n(The present Prendergast Library building on 5th St. was constructed in 1890.) This original Prendergast Building was torn down around 1937, and the building that is there now was erected and leased from the library for use as a Woolworth's:\n\nAfter Woolworth's moved to Chautauqua Mall, the building housed a Rite Aid pharmacy, and now houses the Lucy-Desi Museum. But of more significance for us, the original building housed the showroom for Ahlstrom Pianos (take a close look at the 1881 atlas figure). So, the piano in the parlor was most likely purchased from the building that used to be where the Lucy-Desi Museum is now!\n\nIn the display case underneath this atlas page is a December 1923 issue of the Jamestown Morning Post newspaper that Mary found wrapped as insulation around the outside of the \"poop pipe\" that leads from the upstairs bathroom to the sewer. (It's not in great shape, but it is now nearly 100 years old; who are we to throw it out?)\n\nThere are also two photo albums on the coffee table under the front window. One contains photos from the 2005 visit by Fred and Zo Ball, Cleo and Cecil Smith, and Lucie Arnaz, as well as photos from the 2007 visit by Zo (Fred had passed away earlier that year), Cleo, and Lucie. The 2005 visit was videotaped (including Fred and Cleo's re-enactment of the shooting!), and a DVD of it is in the DVD player next to the piano. Here a few of those photos:\n\nLeft: Fred Ball and Mary Rapaport\n\nMiddle: Fred Ball, Mary Rapaport, and Zo Ball\n\nRight: Cleo, Fred, and Lucie in the back yard\n\nFred and Cleo re-enacting the shooting\n\nThe other photo album contains historical photos of the house, beginning with a photo that may have been taken around 1927 and that I found in a TV Guide article about the family. It shows Lucy, an unidentified little girl (could it be Johanna?? — despite local newspapers saying that she was from Celoron, no Ottingers show up in the 1922, 1926, or 1928 City Directories), Fred (holding a dog), and Cleo, standing in the driveway of the house. (This is the only other photo I have of the family at the house. The dog might be Lucy's dog Whoopie, according to Michelle Zimmerman [personal email, 9 May 2023), who identified the dog in another photo with Lucy.) The photo also shows a house across the street, but the house in the photo doesn't quite look like the house that is currently across the street, so either the one in the photo was torn down and replaced, or else remodeled. (In nearly a hundred years, anything can happen!)\n\nThis is followed by a series of photos given to us by Lloyd Faulkner that were taken when Lucy and Desi visited Jamestown in 1956 for the world premier of their movie Forever Darling at the Palace Theater in downtown Jamestown (now the Reg Lenna Center for the Arts). (The full story of this visit, with many photos, is told in Christopher T. Olsen's Lucy Comes Home: A Photographic Journey\" (New York: G-Arts, 2018). (You can look inside Olsen's book at its Amazon.com page.)\n\nLucy had been back to Celoron in the 1940s. Here are two photos from Lucy's visit in 1946:\n\nLeft: Lucy at Celoron Park, with Edward J. Keller (mayor) on left and Harry Illions (owner of the park, with hat)\n\nRight: Lucy at Celoron Park, with Caresse Bush \"photobombing\" on the left!\n\nBut this was the first time she had returned to her childhood home. And, of course, it was Desi's first visit to the area. The photos show Lucy, Desi, Mrs. Faulkner, Lloyd's toddler son, and several neighbors. The two central photos show Lucy in the parlor; in one of them, she touches the curtain rod:\n\n(That's Mrs. Faulkner on the left and Lloyd's son Craig in the high chair.\n\nFor the record, other photos (not in this document) show Desi\n\nwith Craig's younger brother Clark, who was upstairs sleeping.)\n\nBesides perhaps being used to provide privacy for Flora Belle, Lucy also used the curtain rod when she put on plays (along with Pauline Lopus and, perhaps, Fred and Cleo) in the foyer, with the adults seated in the parlor as the audience. Lucy would put a sheet over the curtain rod to use as a curtain:\n\nA possible set-up for Lucy's home theater.\n\nThere is one other possible use of the curtain rod: As we'll see later, there are three bedrooms, one for DeDe, one for Grandpa and Fred, and one for Lucy and Cleo. But where did Lola sleep? The 1926 Jamestown and Celoron city directory lists Lola as working downtown at a hair salon but with her residence in Celoron, yet she is not listed in the Celoron section of that directory. Presumably, she was living at the house and, perhaps, sleeping in the parlor — where she would have needed something hanging from the curtain rod to give her privacy.\n\nCourtesy of Michelle Zimmerman, here are two other photos from that 1956 visit:"
