It was there, in 1951, that Ball and her husband, Desi Arnaz, started Desilu Productions.\n\nLucy’s El Adobe Cafe is a popular campaign stop for local and national politicians. It is also the restaurant where former California Gov. Jerry Brown, now the state’s attorney general, first met singer Linda Ronstadt in the 1970s.\n\nCouncilman Tom LaBonge will unveil the square’s new sign during an afternoon ceremony."
