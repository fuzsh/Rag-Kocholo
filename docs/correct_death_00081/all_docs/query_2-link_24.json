        "meta_description": "The childhood home of legendary actress and comedian Lucille \"Lucy\" Ball was originally located at 59 Eighth Street in Celeron, New York. Fred and Flora Belle Hunt, Ball's maternal grandparents, purchased the home in 1920, and their widowed daughter Desiree (Dede) Ball, and her two children, Lucy and Fred, lived there with her parents. The family lost the home in a lawsuit in 1928, leading Dede, Lucy, and Fred to relocate to a small apartment in Jamestown. In 1989, the year Lucy passed away, the street name was changed to Lucy Lane. The home is now privately owned and it has been restored to its 1920s appearance. The home is not open to the public, but the current owners have occasionally opened their home to fans of Lucille Ball for special events.",

        "text": "The house now located at 59 Lucy Lane was the home where actress Lucille Ball lived from the age of eight to seventeen. It is not known the exact date it was built, but, based on the architecture, it is estimated to have been around 1880 or 1890. Frederick Hall was the publisher of the Jamestown Journal, and he and his wife resided on Lakeview Ave. in Jamestown, so they most likely used the house as a rental property. The first renter of the house was Matthew Wright, one of the paper’s employees, who died in 1915. After his death, Frederick Hunt, his wife Flora Belle, and their daughter Lola lived there as renters before Hunt purchased the home in 1920 for $2000. Shortly after Fred Hunt purchased the house, his and Flora Bell’s daughter, Desiree “Dede,”, moved in with her second husband, Ed Peterson, and her children, Lucille “Lucy” and Fred Ball. Dede’s first husband, Henry Ball, had died in 1915, shortly before the birth of Fred.\n\nThe family lived happily in the home until a fateful event in July 1927 changed everything. Fred Hunt was in the backyard with his grandson, Fred, his granddaughter, Cleo, a little girl named Johanna Ottinger, and a neighbor, Warner Erickson. Warner was sitting on the ground near the porch when his mother called for him to come home. Holding the rifle, Johanna pulled the trigger just as Warner began to run. The little boy was hit in the spine, and he died due to the injuries five days later. Fred Hunt was held responsible for the event, and he was put under house arrest in Mayville, which was the county seat. Out of a job, Fred Hunt was forced to declare bankruptcy, and Frederick Hall, who had the mortgage, foreclosed on the house.\n\nAfter the incident, the family went their separate ways, as Dede and her children moved to an apartment in Jamestown. Years later, when Lucy had established herself as an actress in Hollywood, she brought her family out to the West Coast to reside. Over the years, Lucy returned to Jamestown on a couple of occasions, most notably in 1956, when she and her first husband, Desi Arnaz, stopped in Jamestown to promote their movie, Forever, Darling. On this occasion, the actress returned to her childhood home and posed for some photographs. In April of 1989, she was scheduled to attend an event in Jamestown that celebrated the street name being changed to Lucy Lane. Unfortunately, Lucille Ball passed away on April 26, 1989, but the street remains named in her honor.\n\nIn 1928, the Faulkner family purchased the home, and they owned it for more than seventy years. After going through a couple of more owners, Bill and Mary Rapaport purchased the house in 2005, and they soon began an extensive project to restore the residence and make it appear as it did when Lucy and her family resided there. Lucy’s brother, Fred, and her cousin, Cleo, revisited the home in 2005, telling the new owners that, in the backyard, the family had fruit trees, a vegetable garden, and a chicken coop. The house still holds a few original items, such as the doors, floors, and a lot of the woodwork. Although the home is not open to the public, the owners have occasionally opened it up to Lucy fans who make the trek to Jamestown to explore the roots of the Queen of Comedy."
