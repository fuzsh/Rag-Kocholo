        "text": "On July 27, 2008, we decided to travel to Jamestown, New York to stop at the Lucille Ball Museum (Lucy and Desi Museum), and to pay our respects at Lucy's grave site.\n\nShawn's sister Keri was recently married to her husband Scott out in Washington State. It was a \"get-a-way\" type marriage, so when they returned back to Ohio, they decided to have two separate wedding receptions. One in Warren, Ohio (Shawn's family) and one in Dunkirk, New York (Scott's family). We traveled up to Dunkirk to attend that reception as well and to meet Scott's family. On the way back home, we decided to make a detour to Jamestown, and see the house, museum, and Lucille Ball's final resting place.\n\nThe following video talk a little bit more about this trip and Lucille Ball.\n\nLucille Ball's Childhood home is located at 59 Lucy Ln, in Jamestown NY. Originally the address was 59 W. 8th St, but you can understand why the street was renamed. The house belonged to her Grandpa Fred and Grandma Flora Belle Hunt, and it is where they, along with Desiree (\"DeDe\") Ball (Lucille's mother), DeDe's sister Lola and her her young daughter Clean, and Lucille and her younger brother Freddy called home. We were in the area, so we made sure to go and find the location. (website)\n\nThe Lucy Desi Museum is also located in Jamestown at 2 West 3rd Street. We did go to the museum, but we did not go inside. We were looking for something else; however, The legacy of Lucille Ball has been proudly honored in Lucy’s hometown of Jamestown by the Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum since 1996.\n\nWhat we were looking for was Lucy's final resting place. Yes, even though this was before we even started getting into the paranormal, we did have this fascination with \"Our Haunted Travels.\" How many people can actually say, \"Hey, I saw Lucille Ball's Grave site.\" Better yet, is most people don't even realize that she is buried in Jamestown, Pennsylvania. You would think, someone of her celebrity status would be out in Los Angeles.\n\nOn April 18, 1989, Ball complained of chest pains at her home in Beverly Hills and was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was diagnosed with dissecting aortic aneurysm and underwent an eight-hour aortic transplant. The surgery was successful, and Ball was soon able to walk around her room with little assistance. She received a flurry of get-well wishes.\n\nShortly after dawn on April 26, Ball awoke with severe back pains then lost consciousness; she died at 5:47 a.m. PDT at the age of 77. Doctors determined that Ball had succumbed to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm not directly related to her upper aneurysm and surgery. Ball had been a heavy smoker most of her life, increasing her risk of abdominal aneurysm.\n\n​\n\nHer body was cremated and the ashes were initially interred in Forest Lawn – Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles. In 2002, her children moved her remains to the Hunt family plot at Lake View Cemetery in Jamestown, New York, where her grandparents are buried.\n\nFind her grave site in Lake View Cemetery is quite simple since they have hearts in the pavement, and markers that direct you to the location. There is even a path with hearts that leads you right up to her head stone.\n\nIf you have visited any of these please (or would like to visit some of these places), please let us know down in the comments section."
