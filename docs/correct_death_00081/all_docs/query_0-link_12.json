        "text": "Los Angeles, California Then & Now\n\nPam Hawley Marlin January 2020\n\nLucille Ball\n\nLucille Ball's house on Roxbury Drive. While living in this house, Lucy used it in one of her \"I Love Lucy\" episodes, \"The Tour.\" The front facade of the house has been completed changed by owners.\n\nLucille Ball's original dressing room entrance at Desilu Gower Studios (1950's-1960's) and at Paramount Studios in 2019. The steps and iron railing are still there today.\n\nLucy and Desi at Desilu Studios and the same watertank at Paramount in 2019.\n\nThe audience entrances to \"Our Miss Brooks\" and \"I Love Lucy.\" Called Red Studio today, Lucy and Desi's Desilu Studios operated from this location in 1946. Notice one of the metal sign holders still exists.\n\nThe Ambassador Hotel\n\nThe former Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles was built in 1921. The hotel had a famous nightclub, The Cocoanut Grove, that attracted such celebrities as Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland and Bing Crosby. More infamously, this hotel was also the site of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination in June 1968 by Sirhan Sirhan. After the assassination, the hotel and surrounding area declined resulting in the building's demolition in 2005 (there are few remnants, such as the art deco road entrance and hotel entrance that still remain). Today the site is a school.\n\nDisneyland\n\nThe entrance to Disneyland being built in 1954.\n\nDisneyland excitement in 2019.\n\nThe iconic fire department building in Disneyland where Walt Disney had an apartment.\n\nThe Espresso machine that Walt Disney is posing next to is still on display at Cafe Orleans in Disneyland.\n\nThe home of Robert Disney where Walt Disney first lived when he arrived in Los Angeles in 1923. A freestanding garage in the back of the house was converted to a cartoon studio and is currently owned by the local historical society. The house is currently surrounded by a fence.\n\nThe Spadena or Witch's House\n\nThe Spadena or Witch's House was constructed in 1920 for a silent film studio in Culver City, California. The house served the cost cutting purpose of not only being a studio office, but also a dressing room and film set. When it proved to be too much of a distraction, it was moved to its present location on Walden Drive in Beverly Hills around 1926. It is privately owned.\n\nMurder House\n\nActress Lana Turner lived in this house in 1958 when her daughter, Cheryl, stabbed and killed Lana's boyfriend, Johnny Stampanato. Stampanato was a bodyguard for a crime family and was said to bully Lana, who tried to get out of the relationship. Cheryl was acquitted of all charges and the murder was considered justifiable homicide.\n\nBeverly Hills Hotel\n\nBuilt in 1912, the timeless Beverly Hills Hotel."
