        "text": "JAMESTOWN, N.Y.\n\nThe gathering set a world record for the most Lucy look-alikes in one place at one time.\n\nThis was just one part of Lucy Fest, which also includes performances from several stand-up comics.\n\nNow in its 20th year, the festival draws diehard Lucy fans from all over the world.\n\nIn Southern California, a special exhibit is underway at the Hollywood Museum, honoring the beloved star and the 60th anniversary of her classic TV show \"I Love Lucy\".\n\nBall's daughter says she's always amazed at the legacy her mother left behind.\n\n\"At the end of every episode, no matter how bad the trouble was, somebody would still hug her,\" Lucie Arnaz said. \"'I Love Lucy,' it was about unconditional love and laughs.\"\n\nThe museum exhibit includes memorabilia from both Balls and husband Desi Arnaz's careers. It runs through Nov. 30.\n\nBall was born in 1911 in Jamestown. She died in Los Angeles in 1989."
