        "text": "LUCILLE Ball was a star in the 1950's thanks to her hit sitcom I Love Lucy, which is still loved and enjoyed today.\n\nIn 2021, Ball will make her comeback to the screen, so to speak, in the biographical drama film Being the Ricardos, which details the relationship between the late Ball and her first husband Desi Arnaz.\n\nWho was Lucille Ball and when did she die?\n\nBorn August 6, 1911, Ball was known as an American actress, comedian, model, studio executive, and producer.\n\nOver the years, she starred in countless shows, her most famous being I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy, and Life with Lucy.\n\nBall started her career in 1933 and appeared in over 120 productions prior to her death.\n\nThe star passed away on April 26, 1989, at the age of 77 after suffering from a ruptured aorta following open-heart surgery.\n\nWho was Lucille Ball's husband?\n\nThroughout the course of her life, the star was married twice.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1960, Ball was married to the I Love Lucy producer Desi Arnaz Sr., who was known professional as a Cuban-American actor, musician, bandleader, comedian and film and television producer.\n\nOver the years, Arnaz was known for his work with I Love Lucy, The Long, Long Trailer and Holiday in Havanna.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1969, Arnaz also famously served as the executive producer on 80 episode of Star Trek: The Original Series.\n\nArnaz later died on December 2, 1986, at the age of 69 from lung cancer.\n\nWhile they were together, Ball and Arnaz Sr. welcomed two children together, Lucie Arnaz, 70, and Desi Arnaz Jr., 68.\n\nIn October 2020, Ball's son suffered the loss of his daughter, Desiree, who passed away at the age of 31 following a battle with stage 4 breast cancer.\n\nFollowing her divorce from Arnaz, Ball then remarried Gary Morton, who was known as an American stand-up comedian.\n\nMorton and Ball were married from 1961 up until her death in 1989.\n\nOn March 30, 1999, Morton then passed away after a battle with lung cancer, the same disease that took Ball's first husband almost a decade prior.\n\nWhat is Being the Ricardos and when does it come out?\n\nBeing the Ricardos is a new film written and directed by Aaron Sorkin.\n\nThe upcoming drama takes a look at the life of Ball and Arnaz, who also worked on I Love Lucy back in the day.\n\nThe movie is scheduled to be released in theaters on December 10, 2021, and will feature award-winning actress Nicole Kidman as the iconic role of Ball.\n\nFollowing the release of the trailer, Ball's daughter, Lucie Arnaz, took to Instagram to comment on Kidman's portrayal, saying that she can see that Kidman \"cared very deeply about this part.\"\n\n\"Nicole Kidman became my mother's soul. She crawled into her head,\" Arnaz wrote. \"I don't know how you do that. She cared very deeply about this part. It shows.\"\n\nFollowing the release in theaters, the film will then be added on Amazon Prime on December 21."
