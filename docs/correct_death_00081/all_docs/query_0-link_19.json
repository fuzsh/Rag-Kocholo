        "text": "The world became a little less brighter when Lucille Ball died on April 26, 1989. But what if we told you that America's favorite redhead never really went away? According to many rumors, Lucy can still be found occasionally haunting her former Beverly Hills home.\n\nSightings include reports of unexplained broken windows, loud voices coming from the attic, and furniture moving around the home. While it could've been another ghost, there was one eyewitness who said he saw Lucy visit the property after her passing:\n\nA friend of Lucille's drove past the property to see the home one last time. Walls were missing and he could see Lucille's old bedroom. He then noticed a tall, slim redhead peering through the fence at what was left. She turned toward him and he realized it was Lucy. She looked upset and confused. She then walked around the south corner of the house and disappeared.\n\nOne such reason why she might be drawn to her old home might have to do with the changes made to it following her death. Her husband, Gary Morton, had sold the estate. The new owners were bothered by visiting tourists, so they decided to redo the facade with stucco so the home would be virtually unrecognizable. (It also appears as if they removed part of the home on the right.) Here's what it looks like today:\n\nFlickr photo by Loren Javier\n\nHonestly, we'd haunt them too. In addition to redoing the exterior, it also appears as if part of the home was knocked down, and much of the front yard gardens have been removed. Here's another view of what the estate looked like before the changes, where you can also see a gated carport-like structure:"
