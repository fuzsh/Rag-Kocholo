        "text": "The first President of the Independent Republic of Texas was Sam Houston. In 1836, five sites served as temporary capitals of Texas, before President Sam Houston moved the capital to Houston in 1837. His victory at the Battle of San Jacinto secured the independence of Texas from Mexico in one of the shortest decisive battles in modern history. He was also the only governor within a future Confederate state to oppose secession and to refuse an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy, a decision that led to his removal from office by the Texas secession convention."
