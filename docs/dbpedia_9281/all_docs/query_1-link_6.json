        "text": "OLD VELASCO — Three things I remember clearly about our first family trip to Surfside Beach in the early 1960s:\n\n1. Our house was called the Dome. Sturdy concrete posts, painted white, supported the lower rooms, painted navy blue, which were topped by a white geodesic half-dome. The six children slept in a central upper room directly under the dome, while the adults scattered out into the tiny peripheral rooms downstairs. The Dome had survived devastating Hurricane Carla in 1961, although it did not hold out against later beach erosion.\n\nIt was under that dome that a peculiar child read his first Texas histories and marched downstairs to announce to the bemused adults, “If there aren’t books in heaven, I don’t want to go.”\n\n2. In contrast, many nearby houses near the jetty at the old mouth of the Brazos River — a second, more southerly mouth had been dredged out by the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1920s — did not survive Carla. Their wooden posts stood dark, lonely, askew, without houses or families to uplift, a powerful image.\n\nThe adults explained that the hurricane’s surge smashed the first row of houses into the ones behind them. It would take years to replace them. After which, some Surfside beach houses did and some did not make it through later storm surges.\n\nYears after, I read about that kind of structural domino effect in Erik Larson’s bestseller “Isaac’s Storm: A Man, a Time and the Deadliest Hurricane in History.”\n\n3. A single historical marker down the beach told the strangest story of all: The site of Surfside Beach, now a 4-mile stretch of narrow barrier island, once served, ever so briefly, as the capital of the Republic of Texas.\n\nIt was called Velasco. The port welcomed most of the colonizers of Stephen F. Austin’s Old Three Hundred, who proceeded up the Brazos and Colorado rivers, in the 1820s.\n\nOld Velasco was wiped out by a series of 19th-century hurricanes.\n\nThat’s all I knew. But it stuck in my imagination for decades.\n\nI have returned to Surfside for seaside therapy — and reading — every year since then. In February, we migrated back for two weeks of beach bliss. My 91-year-old mother, who adores the Gulf of Mexico, visited us for one night, along with my middle sister, Valerie Barnes Koehler, who owns a Houston bookstore, and her husband, Greg Koehler.\n\nBy coincidence, just before we packed the SUV in Austin to head for the coast, my youngest sibling, Thomas James Barnes of Houston, had called to ask about the location of the Velasco historical marker, which is now joined by other such markers and was planted at a prominent roadside pullover near the “big bridge” over the Intracoastal Canal, the main entrance to the Village of Surfside Beach.\n\nThat spot was, however, not the physical location of Old Velasco. It was, naturally, about a mile away to the southwest, directly on the Brazos River. Thomas had stumbled upon that historical district in a municipal park just upstream of the landmark jetty made of Central Texas red granite.\n\n(Besides “Old Velasco,” other markers near the big bridge on Texas 332 are dedicated to “Historical Jetties,” “Velasco” and the “Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.”)\n\nSo even before we headed to the coast, I alerted my stout crew of Texas history informants, who sent me news about Old Velasco, as well as a battle that occurred there in 1832 when Texians stormed the small Mexican fort that enforced customs at the port. Some people consider that a prelude to the Texas War of Independence.\n\nThe most important document these history buffs shared was a report from a 1996 archaeological dig performed before the channel was widened to take in the ever-larger oceangoing vessels that visited Freeport and other busy inland docking spots. The diggers had found thousands of artifacts, mostly pottery shards, from Old Velasco, which were carefully documented and preserved.\n\nBut wait! There’s more.\n\nOld Velasco hadn’t disappeared altogether. After the huge 1886 hurricane that had also wiped out Indianola further down the coast, backers moved Velasco 4 miles inland, where it barely survived the Galveston hurricane of 1900 and eventually was absorbed by the city of Freeport.\n\nVelasco lives! As a neighborhood in Freeport.\n\nEven more awesome, Surfside Beach, which I had associated exclusively with the late 20th century — given its surfers, seafood shacks, bait shops, a hippie discotheque and beach crowds — went all the way back to the 1890s. “Surf Side” was laid out in 1891 as a resort. It was reached from New Velasco by an electric train.\n\nIt was time to see what remained of Old Velasco, named — like Quintana, its smaller sister village on the other side of the river — after a Mexican general.\n\nI parked near the jetty in a lovely, modern park and walked inland, trying to remember the digital maps of the dig. Eventually, on a rise in the land, I spotted the old U.S. Coast Guard base, which looks like something on the New England coast and now serves as a municipal building for the Village of Surfside Beach.\n\nAs I approached, I saw a simple stockade of posts, not unlike the ones that hold up many a beach house. The site of the fort at Old Velasco! A sign told me that history lovers want to build a more complete replica of the fort where this starter stockade stands.\n\nAnother sign nearby reads, “Historical Site: Per Village Ordinance No. 2017.04.11B. Metal Detecting or Scavenging on Historical/Archeological Sites and Specifically Blocks 567, 568, 569 and 560 of Surfside Townsite Is Prohibited. Punishable By a Fine Up To But Not Exceeding $500.”\n\nA big hand for the village government, but its warning sign also just advertised exactly where Old Velasco and its remains lie.\n\nDon’t take that notice as a beachcomber challenge (in other words, don't scavenge an archaeological site).\n\nI wandered over to the old Coast Guard HQ. There, a plaque is affixed to a granite plinth.\n\nIt reads, “The Lively, the first vessel with emigrants to Austin’s colony, landed here December 23, 1821. The Battle of Velasco was fought here June 26, 1832. Public and secret treaties of peace between the Republic of Texas and General Santa Anna were signed here May 14, 1836. Dedicated May 14, 1956.”\n\nSign up for Think, Texas, delivered every Tuesday at statesman.com/newsletters.\n\nOr simply text “thinktexas” to 33777.\n\nEach free newsletter contains two dozen Texas History stories and links.\n\nFollow Michael Barnes on Twitter: @outandabout\n\nMiss a column?
