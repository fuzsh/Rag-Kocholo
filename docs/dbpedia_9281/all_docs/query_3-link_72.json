        "text": "Join us at the 2025 TSHA Annual Meeting for an enlightening session titled “Capitals of Texas on the Eastside of the Colorado.” Chaired by historian David Vickers, this session will delve into the fascinating history of Texas’s early capitals located east of the Colorado River. Francis X. Galán, Ph.D., from Texas A&M University-San Antonio, will present “Ghost Town of Tejas: Los Adaes and the Spirit of Survival in East Texas,” shedding light on the early settlement of Los Adaes and its role in East Texas. Richard B. McCaslin, Ph.D., from the Texas State Historical Association, will discuss “Glad to Get Out of so Disgusting a Place: Washington on the Brazos as the Capital of the Republic of Texas,” exploring the challenges faced by Washington on the Brazos. Finally, Stephen L. Hardin, Ph.D., of McMurry University, will provide insights into “Houston City, Capital of the Texas Republic: The Most Miserable Place in the World,” revealing the hardships endured during Houston City’s brief stint as the capital.\n\nThis session offers a unique opportunity to uncover the trials and triumphs of Texas’s lesser-known capitals. Don’t miss this chance to deepen your understanding of the state’s early political centers and their impact on Texas history.\n\nPresenters\n\nRichard B. McCaslin joined the Texas State Historical Association (TSHA) staff as Director of Publications in September 2023.

His notable works include Tainted Breeze: The Great Hanging at Gainesville, Texas, October 1862 (Tullis Award), Lee in the Shadow of Washington (Laney Prize, Slatten Award, Pulitzer nomination), Fighting Stock: John S. “Rip” Ford of Texas (Pate Award, Bates Award), At the Heart of Texas: One Hundred Years of the Texas State Historical Association, 1897-1997 (Award of Merit from the Texas Philosophical Society), and Saratoga on the Cibolo: Sutherland Springs, Texas (Publication Award from the San Antonio Conservation Society). A TSHA Fellow, McCaslin has also received commendations from the Civil War Round Tables in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Shreveport for his scholarly contributions.\n\nDr. Stephen L. Hardin is an expert in Texas, military, and social history. His extensive body of work includes the acclaimed Texian Iliad: A Military History of the Texas Revolution and, more recently, Texian Macabre: The Melancholy Tale of a Hanging in Early Houston, which explores early Houston society.
