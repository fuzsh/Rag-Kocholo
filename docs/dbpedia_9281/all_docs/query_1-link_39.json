        "text": "Velasco, at the mouth of the mighty Brazos River, on the Gulf of Mexico, is the natural site for an important port when the Panama Canal shall have been completed. Within four miles of the city a New York syndicate is on the eve of opening what is probably the largest sulphur deposit in the world. At this writing practically all the machinery and equipment has been installed for the operation of the mine.\n\nThis industry alone means great things for Velasco and the surrounding country, for the opening of these mines will require the employment of a “dinner pail brigade.” And that means more money for the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker, and the merchants in general.\n\nThe soil in the vicinity of Velasco is very productive, and in a comparatively short time this locality is bound to be a gold mine for the industrious “truck” growers, who are settling here in considerable numbers. I was much impressed by the enterprise of Velasco.\n\n(Source: The Texas Magazine ,Volume VI (May 1912-October, 1912, Transcribed by: Mary Kifer)"
