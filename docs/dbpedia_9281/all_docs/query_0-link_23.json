        "text": "Journey back to the incredible summer of 1836 and events were exciting along the shores of Port Freeport (formerly the Brazos River) at the Gulf of Mexico. A new nation had just signed the Treaty of Velasco at Surfside Beach (previously Velasco) with the self-proclaimed glorious Napolean of the West, ruler Antonio de Lopez Santa Anna recognizing the truly independent Republic of Texas. The previous rulers of Mexico had long desired a buffer civilization between northern Mexico and the Commanche raiders of the north and now they had created a mess of hornets. Soon, even the highly feared Comanche would come to respect the hard charging Texas Ranger with Walker Colts on their sides.\n\nSurfside Beach would remain the nation’s de facto capital until October 1836 and the government was hard at work establishing order. Given this precarious location upon the coast, the Texas Revolutionary battle-hardened Texas Navy would be based at Surfside Beach and Quintana with four refitted schooners to protect the young nation’s Provincial Government and coast against seaborn raiders and piracy. Also, a Republic of Texas battery, the Texian-built Fort Velasco stood guard at the Port’s entrance to fortify the administrative seat and secure its warships at dock.\n\nSoon, more discovery will follow!\n\nA Gathering Storm\n\nIn the fall of 1835, “the winds of war” were gusting across the Texas Colonies. Firebrand William B. Travis had crossed paths with one Colonel Bradburn of Santa Anna’s command in Anahuac and had been incarcerated. Angry colonists from across the land gathered to demand and win his release, even violently if warranted. Heavier armament was deemed necessary, and a cannon was requested from the Brazoria settlement. The citizens’ efforts to deliver the howitzer though would be impeded by Santa Anna’s garrison at Surfside Beach (Velasco), an overnight engagement would ensue, 112 riled Texans would prove victorious, and the opponents would be sent packing to their homeland from which they came. Sensing the deteriorating turn of events unfolding Mr. Stephen F. Austin, the gentlemanly and most influential statesman, chartered a diplomatic mission to possibly mitigate the spreading flames, but for all his well-intentioned efforts, he would be imprisoned upon his arrival in Santa Anna’s Capital, suffer disease in the deprecated, morose environment of captivity and only gain his release after 20 months of purgatory. Now, to add insult to injury as his party approached the harbor at Surfside Beach in the confines of the schooner San Felipe, Santa Anna’s sloop of war the Correo Mexicano was churning through the waters at maximum speed to intercept the Texas vessel in an act of piracy. Luckly for Austin’s sake, an experienced, capable, and daring Captain Thomas McKinley would recognize favorable sailing conditions and direct his vessel over the Brazos River Bar to the safe refuge of the Texian port. Passengers and cargo would quickly be exchanged for fighting men and weapons and the San Felipe along with the Steamboat Laura would embark to confront the menace. Pursuit and a naval engagement would ensue as the Correo Mexicano attempted an escape, but nevertheless, she would be commandeered by the gallant Texians. Upon return of the spoils of the first Texian naval victory to the Surfside Beach docks, Diplomat Austin would recognize that Texas must be freed from the despot Santa Anna’s rule and that the “San Felipe Incident” at Surfside Beach had absolutely closed all other avenues of resolution leaving only war.\n\nThe Day of Destiny\n\nYes, the Texians under the leadership of General Sam Houston had vanquished the self-proclaimed Napolean of the West, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, and his forces at San Jacinto, but now, in May 1836, the excitement brewed at Surfside Beach (formerly Velasco). Approximately 3,000 angry and vengeance enthralled, soon to be former colonist had gathered along the shores of Port Freeport (formerly the Brazos River) in remembrance of those surrendering troops who had been cruelly and unmercifully executed at both the Alamo and Goliad. Shouts of “Remember the Alamo!” and “Remember Goliad!” once again reverberated through the skies. Those gathered clamored for a “mob style” justice to be adjudicated upon the fallen dictator, but ole Sam had been keenly aware of the prevailing sentiment and kept his quarry safely confined in a Texian naval vessel off the coast. Today on May 14, the quivering, almost cowardly tyrant was to be brought ashore to execute the treaty for which served as the only reason his hide had been spared.\n\nNeedless to say, there was a heavily armed presence at Surfside Beach that day as General Houston nor the Texian Provincial Government could take any chances. Santa Anna was heavily guarded as he was led from the docked Texian warship “The Invincible” to the “Brown-Hoskin’s Tavern,” the de facto home of a new nation’s capital seat of government led by one Mr. Davd G. Burnet. On this date, Mr. Burnet and Santa Anna would sign two treaties – one public and the other private. The Treaty of Velasco would establish Texas as a free independent republic and Mexico would grant its recognition through its chosen leader. In ensuing years, the Treaty would be recognized by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Republic of the Yucatan. Furthermore in 1848 in defense of an invasion of its borders from the south, this Treaty would provide a legal justification for the United States of America to declare war upon Mexico and claim all territories west of Texas to the Pacific Ocean in a perceived pursuit of manifest destiny. Few foresaw that the California Gold Rush and the Miner 49er would be just around the corner. Now stop and consider that those events would all be set in motion upon the outcome of a gathering at a tavern in Surfside Beach, Texas – the last of the interim locations of The Republic of Texas’ Provincial Government. On Saturday, May 18th, 2024, the citizens of southern Brazoria County will celebrate the signing of the Treaty of Velasco with cannon fire, a reenactment, music, rations, and refreshments. Mark the date."
