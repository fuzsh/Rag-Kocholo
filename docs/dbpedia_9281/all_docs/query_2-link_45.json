        "text": "Kyriakos Mitsotakis : Dear friends, as Greeks we are surrounded by history and as Greeks we are acutely aware of the importance of that history, which is why evenings like this matter. Because as custodians of Greece‚Äôs ancient history, the preservation, protection, and promotion of Greek antiquity isn‚Äôt just important, it is inviolable, a duty and a commitment never to be broken. Yes, that means that part of my mission as Prime Minister is about ensuring the return of Greek artefacts to Greece. But it also means that I have a duty to ensure that in doing that, these collections are also available to as wide an audience as possible. https://lnkd.in/duAV7PdV\n\n#Regeneration is required in Europe!

The Museum of Us, like other museums and related institutions, holds massive amounts of cultural resources and ancestral remains from Indigenous communities. Many 20th century museums and researchers believed that Indigenous cultures were ‚Äúdisappearing‚Äù and needed to be preserved and studied. This belief ignored the history of genocide and removal of Indigenous peoples from their ancestral homelands by colonists and the U.S. government from the 1600‚Äôs into the present. This narrative of ‚Äúvanishing‚Äù or ‚Äúextinction‚Äù presents Indigenous cultures and communities as peoples of the past‚Äìcontinuing the silencing and erasure of their humanity.
