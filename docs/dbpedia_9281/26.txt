Fort Velasco was a garrison located in Velasco, Texas at the present-day location of Surfside Beach along the mouth of the Brazos River. In response to fear of annexation of Texas by the United States during the era of Mexican Texas, the Mexican Congress passed the Law of April 6, 1830, which halted legal immigration by Americans and established military occupation. As a result, Fort Velasco was erected in 1831 by the order of General Ter√°n to serve as a customs port of entry.[1][2]

During the Texas Revolution, Fort Velasco was the primary target of attack for the Texian militia at the Battle of Velasco. After the revolution, and prior to the establishment of the capital in Columbia, Fort Velasco housed the government documents of the Republic of Texas.
