Velasco & Freeport

Freeport has a rich history. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca landed in the area and named the river "Los Brazos de Dios."

In 1821, Stephen F. Austin and 38 men landed at the mouth of the Brazos River on the schooner Lively.

Mr. Austin and his "Old Three Hundred" colonists settled the area and in 1831 founded Velasco. It was the site of the Battle of Velasco in 1832.

Velasco

Velasco consisted of a single house until 1831, when Mexico set up a customs port there and dispatched troops to help the customs collector. More than 25,000 settlers entered through the port. The town was named for a Mexican general, as was Quintana, on the opposite side of the river.

In 1836 following the decisive battle of San Jacinto, Velasco was made the first capital of the Republic of Texas by interim President David G. Burnet.
