        "text": "Lilly Singh Made Her Own Pretend Disney Channel Series, And TBH, I Wish It Was Real\n\nIt's truly everything I ever needed.\n\nSo, now that Disney+ exists, you can watch all of your old faves, like That's So Raven, Lizzie McGuire, and basically anything else that was ever on Disney Channel.\n\nThat being said, on A Little Late With Lilly Singh, Lilly took matters into her own hands and made her own Disney Channel-esque series called \"The Wizard Twins of Hotel High.\"\n\nAnd she called in reinforcements too. Not only was Lilly starring in her own fake show, but she had some legendary Disney Channel alums (!!!) too.\n\nIn the sketch, Lilly played twins, Priya and Puja, \"two magical twins who go to high school in a hotel.\"\n\nWhich is verrrrrry clearly a nod to Wizards of Waverly Place and The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.\n\nAnd, of course, the show needed a ~popular~ girl, so Brenda Song — London Tipton herself — stepped into the role.\n\nMaria Canals-Barrera, from Wizards of Waverly Place, popped in as the bellhop–teacher hybrid that threatened to send the twins to detention.\n\nAnd Karan Brar, from Jessie, played the ~resident jock~ — who may actually be \"the ghost of an old man living in a young man's body.\"\n\nSecrets are spilled...\n\nAnd there's a very, very quirky catchphrase.\n\nIDK about you, but I'd 100% watch this show.\n\nWatch the full \"Wizard Twins of Hotel High\" sketch below.\n\nShare This Article"
