        "text": "Demi Lovato is getting a good laugh from her past starring role in Camp Rock.\n\nThe 27-year-old pop star took a stroll down memory lane on Saturday (July 11) by rewatching the 2008 Disney Channel movie and sharing a series of Instagram Story videos of herself giving hilarious commentary about her “awkward” character Mitchie Torres.\n\n“The amount of awkward f—ing things I did in this movie… I can’t,” Lovato captioned a scene of herself alongside Camp Rock co-star Alyson Stoner.\n\nThe “Sorry Not Sorry” singer continued to poke fun at herself during another scene featuring her and Joe Jonas. “I told yall – how awkward am I?!!!” the artist wrote in the post, in which she can be heard laughing hysterically in the background.\n\nIn the Matthew Diamond-directed film, Lovato plays the role of Torres, an aspiring young singer whose trials and tribulations are chronicled during her time at summer camp.\n\nLovato capped off her Camp Rock rewatch by sharing a spunky scene of herself performing the song “Our Time Is Here” with Stoner and other cast members. “This s–t still slaps not gonna lie…,” she captioned the clip.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nThe original Camp Rock also starred Nick and Kevin Jonas. The sequel, Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam, was released in 2010. In recent years, Lovato has expressed an interest in filming a third installment of the popular Disney Channel movie.\n\n“We want to come out with an R-Rated Camp Rock 3,” the singer told Ellen DeGeneres in 2017. “I mean, all of our fans have now grown up and so anybody that watched Camp Rock is now older and can appreciate it.”"
