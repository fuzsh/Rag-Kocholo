This year marks the second anniversary of the event and the City of Edinburg is proud to welcome two of Hollywood’s finest.\n\nBarrera who born and raised in San Juan, Texas is easily recognizable to television audiences for appearances on hit shows such as Castle, The Big Bang Theory, CSI: Miami, The Closer, N.C.I.S., Medium, The Mentalist, Heroes, The West Wing, NYPD: Blue and 24. The Pharr San Juan Alamo graduate has also appeared on the big screen in feature films like Evan Almighty and the 2016 Festival chosen film premier, Crave: The Fast Life.\n\nRecently Barrera was seen in Southland, The Bridge, Generation Kill and soon, Shut Eye on HULU.\n\nEqually talented is his wife, award winning actress, María Canals-Barrera who is widely recognized for her portrayal of the mother of three young wizards in the Disney Channel’s Wizards of Waverly Place and the mother of Mitchie Torres in Camp Rock and Camp Rock 2. She also made a name for herself with her role in the hit ABC comedy Cristela and the Telemundo series Marielena.\n\nShe has been nominated and has won countless awards including an Imagen Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Alma Award for her role in Brothers García. David and Maria Canals-Barrera reside in Los Angeles, California with their two daughters.\n\nRobert Obregon, writing for IMDb, which describes itself as the most authoritative source for movie, TV, and celebrity content, provides other insights into Barrera and Canals-Barrera:\n\nDavid Barrera was the seventh of eight children. He attended Pharr-San Juan-Alamo High School, where he was involved in Theatre. He received his BFA from Southern Methodist University on a Theatre scholarship. He went on to receive his MFA from The University of California, San Diego, where he garnered a San Diego Fellowship and was awarded The Princess Grace Acting Scholarship in his third year. While at UCSD, he was trained in and worked on several classical works of theatre. He also did an internship at the prestigious La Jolla Playhouse and at Luis Valdéz’ El Teatro Campesino. Upon graduation, he moved to Los Angeles. In 1999, he married actress María Canals-Barrera, with whom he now has two daughters.\n\nMaría Canals-Barrera was born in Miami, Florida as María Pilar Canals. She is also known for Justice League (2001) and God’s Not Dead 2 (2016). When casting the Hawkgirl character on Justice Leage, the casting department looked for an actress with an accent, in order to make Hawkgirl sound more unique since she was an alien. Therefore María was chosen in part for her Hispanic accent.\n\nMarried to David Barrera since 1999, their two daughters are Bridget Barrera (2003) and Madeleine Barrera (2005).\n\nAGENDA ITEMS FOR EDINBURG EDC BOARD OF DIRECTORS SESSION\n\nIn open session, the following items are scheduled for review and possible action by the Edinburg EDC Board of Directors: Discuss and consider election of officers;\n\n• Consider approval of Board of Director’s Minutes for June 28, 2016 and August 20, 2016 Board Meetings;\n\n• Discuss and consider approval of the Edinburg Economic Development Corporation Fiscal Year 2016-2017 Budget;\n\n• Discuss and consider authorizing the Executive Director to renew the Technical Assistance Agreement with the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley;\n\n• Discuss and consider approving a sponsorship for the Jr. Vipers Academy, Venom Volleyball, and RGV FC Toros Academy;\n\n• Discuss and consider authorizing the Executive Director to enter into an Interlocal Agreement with the City of Edinburg regarding the purchase of surplus property;\n\n• Discuss and consider approval of a Resolution and Real Estate Contract with the City of Edinburg for the purchase of real property know as a 1.192 acre tract of land out of a 1.47 acre tract (Part 1), Hidalgo County, Texas, and a 1.422 acre tract of land, being out of a 3.70 acre tract (Part 2), Hidalgo County, Texas; and\n\n• Discuss and consider approval of a Resolution, Loan Agreement and related documents with Greater State Bank.\n\nIn executive session, the following items are scheduled for review and possible action by the Edinburg EDC Board of Directors:\n\n• Deliberate the offers of financial or other incentives to business prospects;\n\n• Deliberate authorizing the Executive Director to enter into a Development Agreement with Project Forum;\n\n• Deliberate authorizing the Executive Director to request proposals for the Ebony Hills project;\n\n• Deliberate possible action regarding the Lease Agreement with Nu-Co Tools, Inc.;\n\n• Deliberate authorizing the Executive Director to enter into a Lease Agreement with Fernanda Brites;\n\n• Deliberate authorizing the Executive Director to enter into a Development Agreement with El Cofre del Tesoro;\n\n• Deliberate authorizing the Executive Director to enter into a Development Agreement with Durga Properties, Ltd.; and\n\n• Deliberate authorizing the Executive Director to enter into a Development Agreement with Project Urban.\n\nAccording to the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, closed, or executive sessions, may be held by a governmental body in certain situations.\n\nExecutive sessions are permitted when a body is meeting with its attorney on litigation or a settlement offer; deliberating personnel matters; deliberating the purchase or lease of property; discussing certain financial contract negotiations; or discussing deployment of security devices.\n\nThe aliases given to the economic development projects – such as Project Domain, Project Quest, etc. – are also allowed by state law in order for the city to encourage business prospects to engage in more detailed negotiations that can lead to the creation of more jobs.\n\nOnce a decision is made, the actions must be announced during the public portion of the EEDC board meeting, and most, and details regarding those actions, including contracts, are available to the public.\n\nSeveral other exceptions to open meetings are also contained in the Texas Open Meetings Act.\n\nMORE ON THE TEXAS PUBLIC INFORMATION ACT AND TEXAS OPEN MEETINGS ACT\n\nSeveral other exceptions to open meetings are also contained in the Texas Open Meetings Act.\n\nThe Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas strives to ensure that the public’s business is conducted in public and works to protect the liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment, according to its website (http://foift.org).\n\nThe organization assists individual citizens, journalists and government officials through educational seminars, an annual conference and a speakers bureau. FOIFT also file briefs in important legal cases addressing open government and freedom of speech and press. It’s FOI Hotline connects Texans with volunteer attorneys who explain open government laws. The FOIFT’s Light of Day project teaches college students how to use public records in their reporting. It is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization.\n\nAlso according to the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas:\n\nTexas Open Meetings Act\n\nThe Texas Open Meetings Act is detailed in Chapter 551 of the Government Code. It states that governmental bodies must hold open meetings unless there is an authorized reason for a closed session, also known as an executive session.\n\nKey provisions of the act are as follows:\n\nCovered Entities\n\nGoverning boards, commissions, agencies and other bodies created within the executive and legislative branches of government are subject to the Texas Open Meetings Act. Commissioners courts, city councils, school boards and certain nonprofit corporations providing public services or spending taxpayer money are among the entities covered. Certain property owners’ associations also are subject to the law.\n\nQuorum\n\nA quorum refers to a majority of members of a governing body, unless a quorum is defined differently by an applicable law or rule or charter of the body. A quorum must be present for the body to take action.\n\nPosting of Notice\n\nThe governmental body must give the public notice of the date, time, place and subject of an upcoming meeting. The notice must be posted in a place readily accessible to the general public at all times at least 72 hours before the meeting. In case of an emergency or “urgent public necessity,” a meeting notice or addition to a meeting agenda may be posted at least two hours prior to the meeting. The governmental body must clearly identify the emergency.\n\nOther Exceptions to Posting Law\n\nBoards or commissions with statewide jurisdiction must have their meeting notice posted on the Internet by the secretary of state at least seven days before a meeting. Committees of the Texas Legislature are not subject to the meeting notice rules above. Their rules are set by the Texas House and Senate.\n\nClosed Sessions\n\nClosed, or executive, sessions may be held by a governmental body in certain situations. Executive sessions are permitted when a body is meeting with its attorney on litigation or a settlement offer; deliberating personnel matters; deliberating the purchase or lease of property; discussing certain financial contract negotiations; or discussing deployment of security devices. Several other exceptions to open meetings are also contained in the Texas Open Meetings Act.\n\nDeliberations Between Meetings\n\nUnder a new provision of the act that took effect September 1, 2013, members of a governing body are allowed to communicate with one another about public business between meetings if they do so in writing and on a publicly accessible online message board. The message board must be prominently displayed and easy for the public to find on the government entity’s website. Officials may not take action on the message board. That must wait for a posted meeting.\n\nVideo Conferencing\n\nThe Texas Open Meetings Act now allows for members of a governmental body to attend a public meeting via a video conference call. The head of the board or commission must be physically present in the designated meeting place and the public must be given access to that meeting space. The public must be able to witness the comments and actions of those officials attending the meeting remotely via audio and video equipment and be able to participate via the videoconferencing just as they would at a traditional public meeting.\n\n••••••"
