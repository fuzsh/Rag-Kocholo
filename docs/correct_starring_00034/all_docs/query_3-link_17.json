        "text": "Maria Canals-Barrera is known best for playing Theresa Russo in Disney Channel’s “Wizard of Waverly Place”. Maria is also co-starring in the Tom Hanks directed film “Larry Crowne” this summer. Movie Mikes had a chance to chat with Maria about working on “Wizard” and also her new film role.\n\nMike Gencarelli: Tell us about working with such a great cast in “Wizards of Waverly Place”?\n\nMaria Canals-Barrera: It is wonderful. It is just wonderful because from the very beginning it just felt right, we clicked and there was great chemistry. All of the kids on the show at time, now they are young adults, they have always been prepared, professional, talent and wonderful. There has been wonderful writing and we just have a great time. Honestly it is best job I have ever had.\n\nMG: What do you like most of playing Theresa Russo?\n\nMCB: I like that she is a fun mom and a caring mom. She has a lot of passion. She gets to really be part of the story and isn’t just a parent role. The parents are really involved with the plot and caught up in the magic. It is a real family ensemble.\n\nMG: How is playing a wife to David Deluise?\n\nMCB: It is effortless to play his wife. I love him. He makes me laugh. He makes me angry. He is just a wonderful comedic actor. He is a lot of fun.\n\nMG: With “Wizards” coming to an end, how do you feel to see the show end?\n\nMCB: I feel really sad. Taking it all in slowly, looking at the sets. I notice I am looking at the kids and hugging them a lot more. I am starting my slow goodbye, like you are starting your slow decent when you lane in the plane [laughs]. You prepare yourself and that is what I have been doing. I have been taking it all in and tell people how much I loved working with them and how I feel about them. I am also grateful that it even happened and I don’t want to forget that because these kinds of jobs as an actor are very rare. It is a tremendous blessing, so I am very happy about it.\n\nMG: Tell us about your upcoming film “Larry Crowne” with Tom Hanks & Julia Roberts?\n\nMCB: Yeah, that was amazing. Tom is amazing, probably one of our greatest American actors. The man is full of energy. He is so funny off camera as well. It was a great experience. I just saw a screening of it and it is really good.\n\nMG: Lastly I have to ask, how did you get involved voice She-Hulk in the video game “Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds”?\n\nMCB: Well they offered it to me and I was thrilled. I didn’t have to audition for it which was really exciting. You know I am have done “Justice League” prior. I played Hawkgirl. I have done some other voice work and I guess they liked that. It is always great for an actor when you do not have to audition. It is nice to be offered something and I was thrilled to do it. She is such a tough character but she is funny too. I loved doing She-Hulk.\n\nRelated Content"
