        "text": "Updated 10/8/14. What skin care products does Maria Canals-Barrera, star of ABC’s “Cristela”use? What are her favorite beauty tips? I have the pleasure of giving her facial treatments on my visits to Los Angeles and she shared her secrets with me.\n\nI honestly have to say that in my 25 years of working with skin, Maria has one of the most beautiful skins I have ever worked with. Why? Simply because at the young of age 48, Maria has all the traits that make her look younger than her age. Plump and firm skin, high prominent cheekbones, a strong neckline, tiny pores and a flawless, smooth texture. (Read more about aging skin: What I Know For Sure About Skin) So on my recent visit, I asked Maria if she would share her favorite skin tips and products for my readers.\n\nCan you share your skin tips that you swear by? Cleanliness is always a priority for me, followed by consistent hydration. I always wash morning and night with a gentle, yet foaming cleanser. (I feel most clean with those.) I blot with clean blotting cloths to absorb oil during the day (especially, right before an interview or an audition) and try to avoid using my hands on my face. Since we touch all kinds of things like public doorknobs, elevator buttons, telephones, etc…our hands can get quite grimy without us even realizing it!\n\nI am also faithful in protecting the skin under my eyes with eye cream EVERY night. I’ve been faithful in doing this for YEARS!…\n\nDid your mother or grandmother give you advice on how to care for your skin? Did you practice it?\n\nOh, yes. The cleanliness advice was straight from my mom. Both she and my father have beautiful skin. And although good skin can be genetic, it can also be damaged by not taking care of it! So, I do.\n\nMy mom is a beautiful Cuban woman who won a beauty pageant when she was young. She was “Queen of the Carnival” in Holguin, Cuba in 1957. She would tell us to NEVER go to sleep with make-up on. When I got the Chicken Pox as an early teen, she said, “Don’t scratch your face! It’ll leave a hole!”\n\nAlso, I remember when we’d go to the beach as kids, my mom would lay out, tanning only her baby oil soaked body. On her face, would be a thick white towel completely covering it. She would lift that towel only to sit up (every 10 minutes or so) to cry out, “Get out of the deep end!” And then she’d lay back down again. Hahaha!\n\nSo, I learned to really protect my face from direct sun exposure from her. Not that I followed suit right away…I remember playing all day in that Florida sun as a kid with NO sunscreen on, but as I grew up, like in High School, I began to take better care of it. I’ll get sun on my face by daily activities and playing outside with my kids, but not from laying out and frying it in the sun at the beach or poolside.\n\nI often wear a hat and glasses to protect my skin from direct sun when I walk to school to pick up my kids. The other moms think I’m “glamorous” by wearing my fabulous hats, but I tell them, “Really, I’m just protecting my face.” Hahaha! Oh, and my mom always preached on not over plucking my eyebrows!\n\nWhat kind of skin advice do share with your own daughters? They are young. 8 & 6. I use a baby wipe every morning to clean the oil off their face and I apply sunscreen on them before school. At night I make sure they wash their gorgeous faces in the bath with a natural cleanser.\n\nDo you do anything different to your skin now that you didn’t do in the last decade? Thanks to Renée Rouleau, I am more aware about the necessity of sunscreen at ALL times! I didn’t know we need it in the shade! I thought I only needed protection from DIRECT sunlight. This was a big eye opener for me. Even in winter on a cold day, I need sunscreen? Yes! I am also, exfoliating more often now. Around 2- 3 times a week.\n\nWhat is your age? I am 48. Yikes! But I do like my skin and I’m grateful for all the great products available to protect it and help keep it looking good.\n\nWhat are some general tips and tricks you practice to look your best? I enjoy make-up and the artistry of it. I did take a few make-up classes and enjoy seeing how one can play up “positive” features (eyes, lips) and contour less “positive” ones (a large forehead, double chin) and it’s fascinating. I also learned how beautifully prepped skin is essential before applying make up. Your skin is your “canvas.” I learned the importance of the eyebrow and how it frames the face.\n\nAnd of course, a good night’s sleep does so much for the complexion. I try my best to do that!\n\nHave you learned skin advice or tips from Renée Rouleau that you do faithfully?\n\nOh, yes. The tip about using a Vitamin C&E Treatment under our sunscreen helping to activate it. That’s a great one. And the benefits of SPF-infused mineral powder as a sunscreen (I used that one while I was camping with the family in Texas!) Also, I gotta stop sleeping on my face if I want to look good in 10yrs. Renée says it aids in bringing on more wrinkles. Yikes! Also, I am learning to protect my hands from the sun while driving by dabbing sunscreen on them, too! (I read Renée’s skin tips on her Twitter page.)\n\nWhich Renée Rouleau products are you loving and why?\n\nI am absolutely hooked on Pro Remedy Oil. It gives my skin a serious glow. I also love the exfoliating power and natural properties of Renee Rouleau Triple Berry Smoothing Peel. It’s fragrant and crimson red with seeds in it. I have to fight the temptation to stick a spoon in it and eat it! Hahaha. I also love the Luxe Mint Cleansing Gel (discontinued), Advanced Resurfacing Serum and AHA Smoothing Serum 17%. And my skin wouldn’t be caught dead without Daily Protection SPF 30!\n\nHow do you prepare your skin for the red carpet?\n\nI ALWAYS exfoliate the day of and immediately follow with a LIGHT moisturizer…because I now always wear sunscreen before every Red Hot Carpet. They’re usually held outdoors!\n\nThank you Maria for sharing your words of skin wisdom with my readers! xo\n\nMaria’s Biography: Whether she is appearing on TV/Film, on stage or lending her voice to countless hit shows, Maria Canals-Barrera is a multi-talented actress who has showcased her talent across the board in entertainment.
