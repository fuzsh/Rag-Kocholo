        "text": "British actor Chris Mason (Vampire Academy) has signed on as a series regular in ABC drama pilot Model Woman. The project, from Sony TV’s TriStar Television and ABC Studios, is a fictionalized family soap inspired by Robert Lacey’s book Model Woman: Eileen Ford and the Business of Beauty, the recently published biography of the outspoken and controversial woman who started as a model and went on to co-found the famous Ford Modeling Agency with her husband Jerry. Mason will play Elsdon Geiss, Bertie and Miller’s youngest son. He’s smart, interesting and perceptive and already has proved that he has the knack for finding new faces. Mason next will be seen in indie film Mad Genius Project. His credits include Universal’s Legend and BBC’s Our World War. He’s repped by 3 Arts Entertainment, United Agents and attorney Lon Sorenson.\n\nMaria Canals-Barrera (Wizards of Waverly Place) has joined the cast of NBC’s untitled multi-camera family comedy pilot starring Vladimir Caamaño. Produced by Bill Lawrence and written by Adam Sztykiel and Caamaño, the project is inspired by Caamaño’s real-life family dynamic living with his Dominican father and older brother in the Bronx, which often is featured in his stand-up. In the show, Vlad (Caamaño), the son of Dominican immigrants, wants to carve his own path in life, which proves difficult as his father has no desire to change their extremely co-dependent relationship. Canals-Barrera will play Andrea, Vlad’s high-energy mom who loves everything about the U.S. Canals-Barrera most recently was seen on ABC’s Cristela and is best known for her role as Theresa Russo on Disney Channel’s Wizards of Waverly Place. She’s repped by APA and Teitelbaum Artists Group."
