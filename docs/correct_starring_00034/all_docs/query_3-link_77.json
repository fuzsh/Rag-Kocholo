Producers Ryan Armendariz and writer, producer Jimmy Summerall are both from the team behind hit teen dance films To The Beat! (2018) and To The Beat! Back 2 School (2020). This coming-of-age story was executive produced by Fernanda Whitworth and features a cast of top TikTok stars and popular talent from the world of dance. Choreographed by Emily Lutes, who toured with Mariah Carey and owns The House dance studio, and Ade Obayomi, a top-six star from So You Think You Can Dance, the high-energy dance-heavy movie features dance phenomena Bailey Sok, Jalen Forward and Josh Price. The title song, \"LA, Here I Come,\" was performed by Hannah Giraldo, daughter of Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo, and written by Kyle Massey (Disney Channel's That's So Raven and Cory in the House).\n\nSynopsis: When a talented young dancer moves to Los Angeles with her family, she is nervous about fitting in. As she teaches her younger sister's dance team, she is quickly noticed and recruited by the top dance squad in the city. But tensions rise between her and the reigning dance queen, so they each assemble their own crews and settle their differences on the dance floor. Watch the trailer: https://youtu.be/ZMNd82jvRVk\n\nStarring Savannah Lee May (Julie and The Phantoms), Maria Canals-Barrera (Wizards of Waverly Place), Laura Krystine (100 Things To Do Before High School, To The Beat!, To The Beat! Back 2 School), singer Hayden Summerall, and also starring Gunner Burkhardt (Alexa and Katie). Maria Canals-Barrera's daughter and husband also appear in the film.\n\nA red-carpet screening event with the cast and more will be held on Sunday, July 14 at the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills starting at 4:00pm PT.

I had the pleasure of working with three of my sons, Hayden Summerall, Dylan Summerall, and Hunter Summerall on this film. We also had an incredible team, including lifelong friends and new connections that I will cherish forever. We are excited to share this amazing experience with audiences and hope it resonates as deeply with you as it has with us.\"\n\nDance Rivals will be available on major TVOD platforms including iTunes, GooglePlay, Amazon Instant, Vimeo, and hoopla along with most cable providers in the US including Dish, DirecTV, Comcast, Spectrum, Charter, Cox, Verizon Fios, Frontier, Suddenlink, Mediacom, Century, and in Canada on, Shaw, Rogers, and Bell.
