        "text": "Susannah Grant‘s “The Club” has let in a new member.\n\nMaria Canals-Barrera (“Wizards of Waverly Place,” “Gang Related”) joins ABC’s upstairs/downstairs soap as Hilda, the house manager of the country club where most of the action takes place.\n\nHilda has a big personality that she keeps in check on the job. But don’t cross her. She rules her staff by the book. As for the guests, she hears, sees and knows everything: who’s broke, who’s cheating, and who’s a crook. The smart members realize this and treat her with the respect she deserves. The stupid dismiss her at their own peril.\n\nCanals-Barrera is repped by APA, Imperium 7 Talent Agency, Teitelbaum Artists Group and Core Public Relations Group.\n\n“The Club’s” cast also includes Betsy Brandt, Chris Conroy and Callie Hernandez.\n\nThe hour-long drama, received a straight-to-series 13-episode order in January. It hails from CBS Television Studios and ABC Studios and is exec produced by creator-scribe Grant (“Erin Brockovich,” “In Her Shoes”) with Sarah Timberman and Carl Beverly. David O. Russell was attached to the project, but left in February."
