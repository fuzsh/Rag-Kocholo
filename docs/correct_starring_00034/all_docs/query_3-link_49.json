        "meta_description": "Maria Canals-Barrera is an American actress. She is known for starring as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_Russo in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Channel series https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizards_of_Waverly_Place (2007–2012), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Torres in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Rock (2008) and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Rock_2:_The_Final_Jam (2010), and Daniela in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company comedy series https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristela (2014–2015). Canals-Barrera has voiced https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkgirl in a lead role in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League_(TV_series) (2001–2004) and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League_Unlimited (2004–2006) and in a guest appearance in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_Shock as part of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Animated_Universe, Sunset Boulevardez in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Proud_Family (2001–2005) and Paulina in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Phantom (2004–2007).\n\nOn the Show:\nDisney Fans Overrunning Austrian Village That Inspired \"Frozen\": The NY Post says the Austrian village that inspired the movie ''Frozen'' has shut down it's lakefront viewing area because it is being overrun by tourists. The town of Hallstatt has 750 residents. Over 7,000 people a day are now visiting the city because of the Disney film. Mayor Alexander Scheutz was left with no choice, but to shut down the viewing area due to heavy traffic and privacy concerns. \n\nGizmodo says Disney is opening a theme park based on the movie ''Frozen''.The park is part of Hong Kong Disneyland's expansion. It will open later this year.\n\n\nThe Liverpool Echo newspaper says a bar, inspired by the Top Gun movies, is going to open in Merryside, England. The bar is called Maverick's. It will feature a jukebox, vintage neon signs, an American flag and a Statue of Liberty. Owner Andrew Mikhail says, \"Top Gun is my favorite film of all time and so the bar just had to have a nod to the iconic Tom Cruise film. There's one thing that holds true for all American dive bars: If you visit one, you're always going to have a story to tell later, and that is what we want to achieve with Maverick’s\".  \n\nUproxx says Eddie Murphy is in talks to star in the next Pink Panther movie as Inspector Clouseau. Amazon owns the rights to the Pink Panther franchise \n\n\nFanFest says Bradley Cooper has allegedly turned down the role of Lex Luthor in the upcoming ''Superman: Legacy'' movie. The film is going to be released on July 11th, 2025.  \n\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger wants to play Conan the Barbarian again. Ace Showbiz quotes him as saying;  \"It's been pending for the last ten years. [Fredrik] Malmberg owns the rights. He comes to me and says, 'Oh, I have a deal with Netflix' and when we ask Netflix, they don't know anything about it. It's one of those crazy things. I hope he figures it out. I think you do it like 'Unforgiven', where you play the age. There's a great script out there that John Milius wrote, and others have written one. The story is there. There are directors who want to do it. But he has the rights, and until he sells the rights for one or two movies, or for the franchise, there's nothing you can do about it.\"Arnold Schwarzenegger tells\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter that he is done playing the Terminator. “The franchise is not done. I’m done. I got the message loud and clear that the world wants to move on with a different theme when it comes to The Terminator. Someone has to come up with a great idea. The Terminator was largely responsible for my success, so I always would look at it very fondly. The first three movies were great. Number four [Salvation] I was not in because I was governor. Then five [Genisys] and six [Dark Fate] didn’t close the deal as far as I’m concerned. We knew that ahead of time because they were just not well written.”\n\nMichael J Fox tells Variety magazine that he doesn't care if ''Back to the Future'' gets rebooted. “I’m not fanatical. Do what you want. It’s your movie. I got paid already. I don’t think it needs rebooting because are you going to clarify something? You’re going to find a better way to tell the story? I doubt it.”Christopher Lloyd, aka Doc Brown, says, “I would love to do a sequel, but I think Bob Zemeckis and [producer Steven] Spielberg felt that they told the story in the three episodes. But if somebody has a brilliant idea that would justify a fourth film it might happen.”",
