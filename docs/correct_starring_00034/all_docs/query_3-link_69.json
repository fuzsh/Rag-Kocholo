        "text": "1.4K\n\nHollywood stars David and Maria Barrera are relying on God to raise strong Children.\n\nDavid & Maria Barrera\n\nActors David Barrera and Maria Canals-Barrera are popularly known for their roles in the series “Killing It” and “Wizards of Waverly Place.” The couple has been married for over 20 years and has two kids. Today, they will be starring together in the recent film “Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters,” Pure Flix’s original movie. It is inspired by Meg Meeker’s bestselling book of the same title.\n\nIt’s a story about a father of three who is trying to hold onto his little girls. But he felt like his daughters were slipping away from him. That’s when he turned to God and gave up control over his children’s lives. Maria said that through the film, they wanted to let fathers know that they are enough.\n\n“A lot of dads, I imagine, focus on shortcomings or feeling ill-prepared just because they’re of a different gender and think that moms need to handle certain things when in actuality, a father stepping up to the plate and having those intimate conversations with their daughters is exactly what the daughter needs,” she explained.\n\n“Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters”\n\nFathers just need to be there for their children. They don’t have to be perfect and flawless, they just have to be involved.\n\n“I think it’s encouraging dads to know that it doesn’t matter where you think you lack; the fact that you care and are present and want to be there for her is an 80% of it right there. So don’t get caught up in being perfect as a dad, just be involved, because a daughter needs to know that her dad wants to know what she has to say.”\n\nShe also shared the most important thing that this film is trying to teach every parent, that they have to rely on God.\n\n“We don’t realize as parents … but there is a line where if you exasperate your kids, it is not effective, and the accepting who they are as adults, because [in the film], she is an adult, knowing that she has her own separate God-given purpose. It’s a beautiful walk alongside [them] the way God does with us. That’s what an earthly father is called to do with his grown children. We know as parents, it’s a shift that we’re making as our children are older teenagers now. Which is not easy,” she noted.\n\nRead also: COMEDIAN JIM BREUER TALKS ABOUT FAITH AMID WIFE’S CANCER BATTLE: ‘I’LL NEVER BE MAD AT GOD’\n\nGrow closer to God daily by getting exclusive video teachings on God Today!\n\nRead God’s Word For You Today directly from your phone.
