        "text": "Mariela obtained her PhD in Physics from Instituto Balseiro, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, Argentina in 2003 (PhD advisor: Prof. Francisco de la Cruz). She was postdoctoral fellow at the Vrije Universteit (The Netherlands) and at the KU Leuven (Belgium). She held a position as Research Expert in the Functional Nanosystems group at KU Leuven from 2015 till 2018. She has been the responsible for the Quantum Transport group at IMDEA Nanociencia since October 2018.\n\nJosé Luis Vicent is Professor Emeritus of the Departamento de Física de Materiales (Universidad Complutense, Madrid). Prof. Vicent has worked at the University of Virginia, F. Bitter National Magnet Lab. at MIT, Argonne National Lab., University California-San Diego, Centro Atómico Bariloche (Argentina), and Universidad del Valle (Colombia). He has been Chairman of the Spanish Condensed Matter Division (GEFES-RSEF) and Chairman of the Materials Science Commission (Spanish National Science Foundation). Prof. Vicent has been the advisor of more than 20 master and Ph. D. students. He has been Programme Manager of Nanoelectronics and Superconductivity research programme and head of the Transport in 2D systems group at IMDEA Nanociencia since 2010. His publications cover a diversity of materials from single crystals to metallic glasses, and many different effects mostly related to magnetism and superconductivity at the nanoscale.\n\nElvira got her PhD in Physics from Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) in 1998 (Premio Extraordinario de Doctorado). She worked at the University of California San Diego and at the University of New York at Stony Brook with a NATO postdoctoral fellowship. In 2001, she got a Ramon y Cajal research fellowship at Facultad de Ciencias Físicas (UCM). Currently, she is Full Professor at the Departamento de Física de Materiales (UCM) and in 2013 she joined IMDEA Nanociencia as an Associated Scientist.\n\nHer research work has been focused mainly on the fabrication, design and characterization of nanostructured systems based on superconducting and magnetic materials. One of her main interests is the study of new effects appearing when two dissimilar materials are brought together, especially in the range of reduced dimensionality or nanoscale.\n\nÁlvaro obtained his Ph.D in Physics in 2011 from the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM) under the supervision of Profs. Miguel Manso, Raul Martín Palma y Josefa P. García. He held postdoctoral positions at Instituto de Cerámica y Vidrio (ICV-CSIC), ESRF (Grenoble, France) and at the Hiroshima University (Japan). In 2017 he joined the Group of Superconductivity and Thin Films at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Since 2019 he is a TALENTO-CM Senior Research fellow and in 2021 he became Associated Scientist at IMDEA Nanociencia.\n\nHis research has been mainly dedicated to the development X-ray techniques and applying X-ray spectroscopy to the study of materials. His research interest includes studying the interaction of superconductors and magnetic materials with reduced dimensionality (nanostructured) by combining transport, magnetic and synchrotron techniques.\n\nSandra graduated in Physics at Universidad de Córdoba (Córdoba, Spain) in 2020. She also obtained her Master's degree at the same institution in 2021. Then, Sandra joined IMDEA Nanociencia, where she does her PhD supervised jointly by Dr. Mariela Menghini (Transport in Quantum Materials group) and Dr. Enrique Cánovas (Nanostructured Photovoltaics group)."
