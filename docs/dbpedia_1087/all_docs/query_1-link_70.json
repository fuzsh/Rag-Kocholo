        "text": "MLS MEDIA RESOURCES: WEEK 24 NEWS & NOTES\n\nNews and notes and statistical trends from around Major League Soccer\n\nJOSEF MARTÃNEZ ADDS YET ANOTHER CHAPTER TO HISTORIC RECORD\n\nAs he chases down his MLS record-setting performance in winning the Golden Boot a season ago, Josef MartÃ­nez of Atlanta United has already etched his name in yet another mark as the most prolific striker in the leagueâs history.\n\nMartÃ­nez last weekend scored a pair of goals in Atlanta Unitedâs 3-0 win vs. the LA Galaxy at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, giving him 20 goals for the season. Along with his 31 goals from a year ago â the single-most of any player in the leagueâs first 23 seasons -- MartÃ­nez has become just the second player in MLS annals to record back-to-back 20-goal seasons.\n\nThe first was David Villa, who scored 23 goals in 2016, then 22 goals in 2017, for New York City FC. Just one other player in MLS history has even scored 20 goals in multiple seasons â Bradley Wright-Phillips of the New York Red Bulls, who reached the 20-goal plateau on three occasions: 2014, 2016 and 2018.\n\nMULTIPLE 20-GOAL SEASONS (MLS)\n\n<div align=\"center\">YEAR</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">TM</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">GMS</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">GLS</div>\n\n<div>Josef Martinez</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">2018</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">ATL</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">34</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">31</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">2019</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">ATL</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">22</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">20</div>\n\n<div>David Villa</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">2016</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">NYC</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">33</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">23</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">2017</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">NYC</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">31</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">22</div>\n\n<div>Bradley Wright-Phillips</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">2014</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">NYR</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">32</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">27</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">2016</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">NYR</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">34</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">24</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">2018</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">NYR</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">32</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">20</div>\n\nTo hit the 20-goal mark this season, MartÃ­nez has scored 15 goals over his past 10 games, dating back to May 24. That equals the most goals over a 10-game span in league history â which MartÃ­nez himself first set last year, from June 2-July 28.\n\nMartÃ­nez last season had previously scored 14 goals in 10 games (from May 30-July 21), which equaled the record for most goals over a 10-game span which had stood since the leagueâs inaugural season, when it was done by RaÃºl Diaz Arce of D.C. United, then matched in 1998 by Stern John with the Columbus Crew.\n\nMartÃ­nez has the opportunity to set the outright record this Saturday when Atlanta United travel to the Portland Timbers (11 p.m. ET, FS1). If he scores two goals or more, he will have scored 16 goals in a stretch from May 29 to Aug. 18.\n\nMOST GOALS, 10-GAME SPAN (REGULAR SEASON)\n\n<div align=\"center\">GMS</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">START</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">END</div>\n\n<div>Josef Martinez</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">15</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">5/24/2019</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">8/11/2019</div>\n\n<div>Josef Martinez</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">15</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">6/2/2018</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">7/28/2018</div>\n\n<div>Josef Martinez</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">14</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">5/30/2018</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">7/21/2018</div>\n\n<div>Stern John</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">14</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">8/16/1998</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">9/27/1998</div>\n\n<div>Raul Diaz Arce</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">14</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">9/17/1996</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">7/4/1997</div>\n\nCredit: Elias Sports Bureau\n\nThe brace on Saturday also gave MartÃ­nez 70 goals for his MLS career â by far the fastest player to that total in MLS history. David Villa last year became the quickest, netting his 70th goal in his 103rd league appearance on May 19.\n\nGAME NUMBER OF 70th MLS GOAL\n\n<div>Josef Martinez</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">76</div>\n\n<div>David Villa</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">103</div>\n\n<div>Roy Lassiter</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">104</div>\n\n<div>Robbie Keane</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">106</div>\n\n<div>Bradley Wright-Phillips</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">110</div>\n\n<div>Taylor Twellman</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">113</div>\n\n<div>Carlos Ruiz</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">114</div>\n\n<div>Raul Diaz Arce</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">114</div>\n\nLAFCâS CARLOS VELA PUTS HIS STAMP ON BEST SEASON EVER\n\nThere are still 10 regular season games to be played for the Los Angeles Football Club, but Carlos Vela has already equaled the single greatest season performance in MLS history.\n\nVela scored a goal and added two assists in LAFCâs 4-2 win against the New York Red Bulls at Banc of California Stadium last Sunday evening. The performance gave him 23 goals for the 2019 season, along with 15 assists â the league leader in both categories.\n\nThe 38 combined goals and assists equals the most in a single season in MLS history. In 2015, Sebastian Giovinco of Toronto FC netted 22 goals and added 16 assists, in 33 performances, the 38 combined goals and assists the highest single-season total ever in MLS.\n\nVela is also on track for another piece of history. In the first 23 MLS seasons, no player has finished the season with the outright league lead in both goals and assists. In 2015, Giovinco led MLS in assists, but was tied for the goals lead with Kei Kamara, then with Columbus Crew SC. (Giovinco did win the MLS Golden Boot on the basis of more assists).\n\nMOST COMBINED GOALS AND ASSISTS, SINGLE SEASON MLS HISTORY\n\n<div align=\"center\">GP</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">G</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">A</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">G+A</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">2019</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">Carlos Vela</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">LFC</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">23</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">23</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">15</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">38</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">2015</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">Sebastian Giovinco</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">TOR</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">33</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">22</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">16</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">38</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">2018</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">Josef Martinez</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">ATL</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">34</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">31</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">6</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">37</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">2012</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">Chris Wondolowski</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">SJ</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">32</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">27</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">7</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">34</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">2014</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">Robbie Keane</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">LA</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">29</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">19</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">14</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">33</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">1999</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">Jason Kreis</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">DAL</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">32</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">18</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">15</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">33</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">2018</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">Zlatan Ibrahimović</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">LA</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">27</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">22</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">10</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">32</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">2017</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">Diego Valeri</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">POR</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">32</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">21</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">11</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">32</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">2016</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">Sebastian Giovinco</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">TOR</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">28</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">17</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">15</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">32</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">1998</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">Cobi Jones</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">LA</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">24</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">19</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">13</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">32</div>\n\nThe goal was Velaâs 37th in his two seasons in MLS â now the most of any player born in Mexico in league history.\n\nThe previous record-holder was Erick Torres, who netted 36 goals over five seasons with Chivas USA and the Houston Dynamo from 2013-17.\n\nThe player with the third-most goals for a Mexican-born player is Luis Silva, who had 32 goals with Toronto FC, D.C.
