        "text": "Join us for a new chapter in the life of The Madeleine Brand Show.\n\nDon't worry, we're not changing much. Madeleine Brand and all the show regulars (the Sklar Brothers, the Dinner Party, Luke Burbank, etc.) are still there with a daily look at news, life and culture in Southern California. We've added a new cast member, A Martinez, who will co-host with Madeleine starting August 20, as The Madeleine Brand Show morphs into Brand & MartÃ­nez.\n\nÂ\n\nThe Madeleine Brand Show debuted on KPCC in September of 2010. In its relatively short time on the air, the show has built a strong following and significantly added to KPCCâs news presence during the day. It has won a dozen major news awards for reporting, writing, features and use of sound, including the 2012 âGolden Mikeâ award for best news and public affairs program from the Radio & Television News Association of Southern California.Â\n\nÂ\n\nNew cohost A Martinez is a Los Angeles native. He grew up in Koreatown, attended Daniel Murphy High School and played baseball at L.A. City College before getting a journalism degree at Cal State Northridge.Â A is well known to sports-talk radio listeners in L.A. as host of 710 KSPNâs In the Zone.Â Heâs done pre- and post-game shows for most of L.A.'s major professional and college sports teams, and is especially known as the longtime host of Dodger Talk and Laker Line.\n\nÂ\n\nA brings a deep knowledge and passion for the city to KPCC, and we're thrilled to have him as part of KPCCâs fast-growing news family.\n\nÂ\n\nAnd, oh yeah, it really is A.Â Just the letter A.Â And not anÂ initial A. Here's the story: A's given name is Jorge.Â One of his early bosses couldn't remember âJorge,â so every time the boss needed something heâd shout, âHey,Â Martinez!âÂ That eventuallyÂ became... wait for it... A Martinez."
