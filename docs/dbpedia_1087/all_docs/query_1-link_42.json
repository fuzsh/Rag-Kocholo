        "text": "The worst thing about you, Nuño, is that you were reincarnated at the same time as I was.\n\nYou had to traverse the lost dream of other lives,\n\nin which I cornered myself to sleep after four hours of screaming\n\nand sluggish footsteps in Mexico City.\n\nHow did you get to that corner that I myself do not know!\n\nHow you are in the region that I had to discover in my solitude.\n\nYou went ahead of me.\n\nYou are again, intruder.\n\nI am sure you remember the Pánuco.\n\nYou were reflected in the sharp, black teeth\n\nof the lords of Coxcatlán, of Tampamolón, of Hutzihuayán.\n\nThen you blackened their whole bodies.\n\nI recognize you.\n\nYou have the gesture with which you killed my father’s grandfather’s grandfather’s father’s grandfather’s father’s grandfather’s grandfather’s my father’s father.\n\nYou lasted one year ruling the Pánuco.\n\nTwenty thousand went astray in that year.\n\nThey were in Cuba, in Haiti and in the Antilles.\n\nThey never wondered what happened after they were in the belly of the sea monster.\n\nThere was no time for that,\n\nyou just worked.\n\nYou followed me and I followed you to Michoacán; back then it was a pot.\n\nI heard that you dismembered several men in Tzintzuntzan.\n\nI heard no more. I broke down.\n\nAs you know, a fraction of memory is lost when one loses usefulness.\n\nEveryone knows that.\n\nI recognize you, Nuño.\n\nIn this time, we coincided;\n\na few hours ago, you spoke;\n\nthousands see you on screens,\n\nthousands listen to you through electronic miracles.\n\nYou feel more omnipresent than five centuries ago.\n\nDo you really believe that we are reincarnated in objects? To your regret, no.\n\nWith your same will that recognized neither mortal nor body limits. Here you are.\n\nYou knew how to be on Cortés’ back so that no one would see your bullshit.\n\nToday, yesterday, a week ago, a while ago you have been multiplying.\n\nThere are parts of you everywhere,\n\nin men who have decided to be things.\n\nAnd, because of that, they lose memory when they have outlived their usefulness.\n\nWe all know that.\n\nThe point, Nuño, is that in this time we already know each other.\n\nWe already know you.\n\nFor years we have met from time to time in dreams.\n\nSome of us have searched for you and were annoyed when we woke up\n\nand not knowing in which region of oblivion you stayed.\n\nThe worst of you is the best for all of us.\n\nOpen, close,\n\nclose the skin,\n\nopen the skin.\n\nTo open the ears like navels,\n\nto open the navel like an ear,\n\nto open things as if closing things\n\nclose things as if they were opening things.\n\nPendulum of language:\n\nliar,\n\nsimulates moving with the equation of time,\n\nof time divided from space.\n\nClose eyes,\n\nreasons,\n\nmemories\n\nhistories\n\nComplexes for us, reasons for you.\n\nPendulum of reasons and concepts, history for you.\n\nMemories for us, blurred, almost oneiric.\n\nImages for you, experiences for us, and experience has no reasons.\n\nYour images, your reasons.\n\nYour images, your stories.\n\nYour images, your power.\n\nYour images, your hungry mouth.\n\nMy images, a complex.\n\nA complex of color, of words.\n\nPendulum of growing, grooooooowing, grooooooooooooooooowing images,\n\nand growing again.\n\nDead images, because you only produce death.\n\nDid you realize that you only live by my gaze?\n\nBy our gaze.\n\nYour mouth screams shit,\n\nwe have to see images of shit.\n\nOf your shit.\n\nOf shit that no longer serves to be free.\n\nThe tongue, the language and the sea.\n\nThe tongue, the navel and the leather.\n\nThe tongue, the navel and the congenital slave.\n\nI have a slave in my navel,\n\nI have a slave in my tongue,\n\nI have a slave in my language.\n\nI look at the slave I was in the sea,\n\nI look at the slave I am in the sea.\n\nThe sea incapable of becoming memory,\n\nincapable of becoming language.\n\nincapable of becoming my navel again.\n\nIncapable of being architecture.\n\nBroken body\n\nMollusk body\n\nBody decorating bodies\n\nBark skin subjected to geometry\n\nTree\n\nSnail\n\nLeather\n\nMetal\n\nGeometry in language\n\nin the sea\n\nNouns turned to salt\n\nI am lost\n\nnot a snail\n\nnot a tree\n\nnot leather\n\nI am slave.\n\nFeet wet with your culture,\n\nfeet that step on my own words.\n\nDust of pots, coal and bones.\n\nThe eternal mineral romance.\n\nWith my words under my palms,\n\nI only look\n\nI never speak, my words drowned in your culture.\n\nSand that can hardly be an image\n\nwill never be on the ocean.\n\nReptile that carries the sea.\n\nAnimal sand\n\nAnimal of the depths where there is no light, although everything is bright.\n\nYou come dead and open my navel,\n\nyou germinate without end.\n\nEndless like a pendulum.\n\nYou start where it opens but never closes.\n\nYou open in your culture,\n\nendless culture.\n\nI am a custom, you are a form.\n\nBecause the universal must have no end,\n\nbecause my custom ends in my gaze.\n\nIt is a ship with words traveling,\n\nbut the culture\n\nyour culture\n\nis the ocean.\n\nThat’s how you taught me to see it.\n\nThat’s why culture\n\nyour culture\n\ndevours bodies\n\nsinks the little ships of words.\n\nMy gaze cannot see her,\n\nmy gaze always runs out first.\n\nAnd the culture\n\nyour culture\n\npretends to have no end\n\nmurderer of my gaze.\n\nRivers are my refuge and I remain on the shores,\n\non the shore of culture,\n\nof your culture,\n\nmy head sunk in my gaze,\n\nthe gaze lost in culture,\n\nthe image trapping wills,\n\nintimacies.\n\nBecause intimacy is not infinite for culture,\n\nit is the place without experience,\n\nconsuming me, eating and shitting its infinite ocean.\n\nThe Culture\n\nyour culture\n\nit is your culture that names me.\n\nThe nightmare of not knowing how to speak,\n\nof not being in your culture,\n\nbecause dreams are not culture.\n\nThe greatest degradation of experiences,\n\nthe great debt to the human spirit.\n\nBut the West is infinite, and experiences have an end.\n\nThe deep love of the end of things,\n\nto then awaken in the comfort of the shore,\n\nof the company of others on the shore,\n\non the shore of your culture.\n\nI saw people in lines getting off a boat in the middle of the day.\n\nHundreds, almost naked,\n\nbony and fearful with eyes full of dull stars,\n\ndry mouths, skins like crispy husks,\n\nsweating from the effort to survive\n\nin the belly of the sea monster.\n\nI heard the bustle of a market,\n\nundecipherable tongues,\n\nthe timid footsteps creaking the wooden piers,\n\nthe sound of fear lost amidst the landscape of noises\n\nthat come when the corners\n\nof the world meet.\n\nI saw the light of a violent sun among bright fabrics,\n\nblue, yellow and green.\n\nI saw a woman with no will to move forward,\n\nblinded by this new sun,\n\nwhich was different from everything I had ever seen.\n\nI saw when a healthy and fierce man\n\nstruck a woman’s belly\n\nand the humanity that contained her belly\n\nwith the contempt with which the images are struck\n\nwhen they no longer perform miracles.\n\nI heard death in the crackle of that blow.\n\nI have never stopped listening to it.\n\nIt will never go away, the whisper that turned us into things.\n\nBut I know the thunder is furious about it.\n\nI saw my head turn into a pot\n\nand crack at the same time of hearing that blow.\n\nI saw in my arms the salt of the sweat of all the bodies in that row.\n\nI saw my mouth on them, I saw my eyes in their eyes.\n\nI went back to the line and my will broke.\n\nMy grandmothers watched my body\n\nmove through the market.\n\nThe metal stuck to my skin\n\ntook all the weight of a forgotten world.\n\nI saw bodies thrown into the sea,\n\nI still see them now,\n\nlost on roads\n\nwith dead muscles.\n\nI lost my balance and walked\n\nthrough the western world.\n\nI saw those who fell\n\ntrapped by the empire.\n\nIt never stops.\n\nThe empire has eyes.\n\nThose eyes see resources.\n\nThey do not recognize essences.\n\nI discovered a word\n\nsunk in my head,\n\nwaiting for me for centuries.\n\nNow it makes me scream.\n\nI took the empire out of me.\n\nIt was in my bones\n\nand it went into my arteries,\n\nhid in my nerves.\n\nHistory to the present.\n\nYou named me; indigenous.\n\nYou gave me a time;\n\npre-Hispanic past.\n\nI stayed on the shore\n\nbecause I am not\n\nin the extractivist\n\ncivilization of yours.\n\nLost walking,\n\nbuilding cities.\n\nWe have seen all\n\nthe faces of the colonizer:\n\nFriar, encomendero,\n\nviceroy, enslaver,\n\nreligious, military,\n\nassassin, president.\n\nNews arrives\n\nfrom many places.\n\nLost, carried away,\n\nwe just became things.\n\nThe news came today.\n\nWe saw broken bodies\n\ncarrying fat bodies.\n\nFat, sugar, skin dust.\n\nThe news was forgotten,\n\nwe can’t talk anymore.\n\nThe other is dead,\n\nI killed him, I forgot him.\n\nThe slavers of the Caribbean\n\nrecommended sorting:\n\nmen, women, old, strong,\n\nyoung, weak, horseshoes.\n\nReward some and\n\npunish others.\n\nAccept and despise\n\nand all must see it.\n\nThey told the slave buyers:\n\nenvy is stronger than empathy,\n\nspite is always stronger than help,\n\ndo this to dominate for four hundred years.\n\nAren’t we seeing the same thing today?\n\nThey separate us and classify us,\n\naccept us or exclude us.\n\nThey created the others in us.\n\nWill they dominate us for more years?\n\nSometimes I am the other,\n\nsometimes you are the other,\n\nand we are always lost.\n\nIn us the absence,\n\nbut walking we are presence.\n\nPresence of the Hurricane.\n\nI killed you and forgot you.\n\nWhen I see that I broke,\n\neach piece breaks again.\n\nFragments of tongues,\n\nfragments of cosmos.\n\nWalking in time is desolate.\n\nThere are answers, but colonial wounds are\n\nopen, deep, newly discovered.\n\nI step on them as I walk in the city.\n\nWith certainty I tell you that we dissolved inside a long time ago.\n\nIt happened when we met.\n\nI can call you mountain today,\n\nbecause of the need to communicate with others I use the words that least describe you.\n\nThe custom of five hundred years of thinking that beings have only one shape,\n\ntoday I know you, mountain,\n\nheap of sand and shells\n\nhollow of water.\n\nYou were the hill and we met in the rain,\n\nthe difference is now the water is inside.\n\nNo one confuses people by the amount of water they swallow\n\nbut you do,\n\nthat little difference makes me confuse you\n\nand your geography is inside\n\ninside me.\n\nFauna, not architecture\n\nanimals with strong legs, with animal roofs and animal walls,\n\nthose on the outside do the inside,\n\nthat’s why architecture is a category,\n\ncategory,\n\ncategory,\n\ncategory,\n\ncategory,\n\ncategory.\n\nWater inside, in the bowels\n\nwater outside, in the rain\n\nand the matter of my interior is also outside, without architecture\n\nwe are outside when we live,\n\nwe are outside when we sleep\n\nand we are outside when we die,\n\nto be outside is more similar to sweat than to a word, so it is not a category\n\nthat is why it is not a category,\n\ncategory,\n\ncategory,\n\ncategory,\n\ncategory,\n\ncategory.\n\nThe dissolution of the interior has brought me many consequences\n\nand it is more and more difficult to locate the illnesses\n\nfor the same reason the remedies are misguided\n\nsometimes I dose the stream to calm symptoms from inside,\n\nbut inside the viscera are inflamed,\n\nthen I understand that the dampness has transferred the things lived before being born and it is complicated to know my age\n\nto know exactly my age."
