Who has a vote?\n\nas.com\n\nBallon d'Or 2023: women's favourites\n\nAlexandra Popp - Wolfsburg/Germany\n\nPopp is by far the most experienced player among this year’s candidates. Capped 133 times by Germany, she is the third top scorer of all-time for the national team with 66 goals. At club level, she is one of the most decorated players in the Frauen-Bundesliga having won the league seven times with Wolfsburg and finishing last season as the top scorer with 16 goals. Popp and her team lifted the DFB-Pokal Frauen in May - the club’s 10th title, a record. But there was disappointment in the Champions League - Popp was on target in the final, but Die Wölfinnen ended losing 3-2 to Barcelona. There was some consolation as she was voted Women’s Footballer of the Year for the first time.\n\nas.com\n\nBallon d'Or 2023: women's favourites\n\nMary Earps - Man United/England\n\nKeeper Mary Earps is another name cited as an outside favourite with the 30-year-old delivering a series of dazzling performances at the 2023 World Cup as the the Lionesses advanced to the final, only to succumb to an Olga Carmona goal as Spain lifted the title.\n\nas.com\n\nBallon d'Or 2023: women's favourites\n\nAitana Bonmati - FC Barcelona/Spain\n\nMidfielder Bonmatí, who starred for Spain as they clinched their first ever World Cup this summer in Australia, is tipped to succeed club and international team-mate Alexia Putellas as the winner of the Ballon d’Or Féminin in 2022.

The fact Les Bleus ended up on the losing side could count against him, however, as might Paris Saint-Germain’s poor form for much of 2023 with the Parisians crashing out of the Champions League at the hands of Bayern Munich.\n\nas.com\n\nBallon d'Or 2023: men's favourites\n\nErling Haaland - Man City/Norway\n\nIn any other year, Manchester City striker Erling Haaland would be a shoe-in for the award as the 23-year-old striker secured a historic treble (Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League) with City in his debut season with the English side scoring 52 goals across all competitions in his debut season for the club.\n\nThe Norwegian will undoubtedly grace future award ceremonies with City boss Pep Guardiola recently stating: “I always said that the Ballon d’Or had to be of two sections - one for Messi and one for the others. Haaland should win. We won the treble because he scored 52 goals but, of course, Messi - his worst season is the best of most players. Both deserve it”.\n\nas.com\n\nBallon d'Or 2023: men's favourites\n\nLeo Messi - Inter Miami/Argentina\n\nMessi seems set to add to his collection of seven Ballon d’Or trophies on Monday night as the current MLS star appears set to be rewarded for leading Argentina to their first World Cup in 36 years - and The Herons to their first ever trophy with their 2023 Leagues Cup earlier this summer.\n\nThe Rosario native bagged seven goals at the Qatar 2022 World Cup and after the Albiceleste were stunned in their Lusail opener falling to Saudi Arabia (2-1), Messi led the way to the delight of the thousands of Argentine fans who made the trip to the Gulf to see the South American side add to their 1978 and 1986 triumphs.\n\nas.com\n\nBallon d'Or gala 2023: headlines\n\n- Ceremony due to start in Paris at 8:45pm CET/3:45pm ET\n\n- France Football to start counting down award rankings at 5:15pm CEST/10:15am ET\n\n- Leo Messi is firm favourite to win an eighth men's Ballon d'Or\n\n- Aitana Bonmati tipped to win women's Ballon d'Or\n\n- Five other awards to be handed out in French capital\n\nas.com\n\nBALLON D'OR\n\nDoes the American Sophia Smith have a chance of winning the 2023 Ballon d’Or?\n\nas.com\n\nBallon d'Or awards: timetable\n\nHere is a breakdown of the timetable for tonight's ceremony:\n\nRed Carpet - 1930 CET / 2:30 pm (ET) / 11:30 am (PT)\n\nCeremony - 2045 CET / 3:45 pm (ET) / 12:45 pm (PT)\n\n2023 Ballon d'Or (debrief, speeches etc) - 2240 CET / 5:45 pm (ET) / 2:45 pm (PT)\n\nas.com\n\nThe seven awards up for grabs tonight\n\nIn total, seven awards are due to be handed out in the French capital today.
