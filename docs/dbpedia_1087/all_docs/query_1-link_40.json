        "text": "SIN DOCUMENTOS\n\nOf God, we only understood His wrath, and still, we spoke about Him\n\nas if He were an older brother. Another one of us: brown and buzzed cut,\n\nrunning into the ditch, learning about the dangers of tall grasses.\n\nOf bullets. Uninsured. On weekends, He’d drive across the bridge\n\nto get drunk off two-dollar liquor. Listened to country music\n\nwhile sucking bone marrow when afternoons got cold and lonely.\n\nNot the good kind of songs. The ones with heft and heartache,\n\npulled from the deepest wells of His throat. Untranslatable.\n\nThen, like the rest of us, He’d return. Remorseful. Heavy-breath\n\nand bloodshot, speaking another language. Smelling like a burnt museum\n\nwith souvenirs He’d smuggled inside His pockets: A silver tooth.\n\nA stuffed bird. A dried-up seahorse. A miracle. A new wound for us to share.\n\nGOD MADE DIRT, AND DIRT DON’T HURT\n\nThey say the only language God understands is thirst.\n\nListens to that craving rumbling out of your mouth\n\nmore than any sweet or piercing prayer. And that the ground,\n\nand anything slamming against it doesn’t belong to Him.\n\nTruth be told, I grew up believing that nothing precious\n\ncame from dirt, was careful not to spill food, a drink, trip,\n\ntumble or fall. Never sat on grassy hills or sand at the beach,\n\nnever picked anything up, making sure I was absolved.\n\nSo that no one could mockingly say, “Te chupó el diablo!”\n\nBut, when a blue-eyed man, using his breath as bait, led me\n\nby my wrists down the corridors of his thirst, I complied.\n\nWas God listening then? I wanted to heed (hand to the heavens,\n\nI did). I believed him when he said I was precious\n\nwhile making me lap up sand to make mud with my spit.\n\nEduardo Martínez-Leyva was born in El Paso, TX to Mexican immigrants. His work has appeared in Poetry Magazine, The Boston Review, The Adroit Journal, Best New Poets, and elsewhere. His debut poetry collection Cowboy Park won the 2024 Felix Pollak Prize in Poetry and is forthcoming from University of Wisconsin Press.\n\n15 July 2024"
