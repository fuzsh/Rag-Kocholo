        "text": "In Mexico, it is estimated that three out of 10 people suffer from a mental disorder at some point in their lives, and only about 40% receive treatment. The WHO notes that disorders like depression and anxiety often occur during adolescence and youth. Therefore, the project aims to increase access to mental health for more young people, with a collective and contextual approach prioritizing those suffering from poverty, discrimination, and racism, such as the Indigenous populations.\n\nErika Hernández explains that the Network created audiovisual material, consisting of short videos in which people from different Indigenous Peoples provided key information to identify symptoms of depression and anxiety, mechanisms for attention, and access to community means in 30 indigenous languages. This number exceeds the 15 languages predominantly spoken in Oaxaca, according to the National Catalog of Indigenous Languages.\n\nEduardo also shares: \"We realized the importance of the interpreter not only in judicial matters but also in socio-emotional processes, and that's when we asked ourselves, how can we train interpreters who, in addition to speaking an indigenous language and being a communication bridge, are also a crucial bridge when taking therapy?\"\n\nThe project's guiding principles were to make visible, attend to, and accompany from a perspective that challenges conventional clinical notions of mental health by including the cultural diversity perspectives of Indigenous languages and communities. This approach addresses mental health from a position that questions cultural, social, and political structures.\n\nHilda Gómez López from the community of San Miguel Reagui explains that mental health is a personal and collective process related to how people live within their closest circle, that is, the community. Sandra García Reyes, an educator participating in the project, says that mental health is about self-care and care about those around us.\n\n\"The Illness Nobody Talks About in the Village\" was one of the 20 projects selected from over 900 applications from young people aged 18 to 29 and youth organizations to the UNESCO and Nestlé pilot program for the Latin America and Caribbean region.\n\nThe program granted seed capital of 10,000 dollars and specialized advisory services to strengthen innovative projects with positive social impact in communities. In June, it brought together the selected young people from 11 countries at the UNESCO Villa Ocampo Observatory in Buenos Aires, Argentina, for intensive training sessions, practical workshops, mentorships, and various activities to continue strengthening their initiatives.\n\nImpulso Joven – Because Youth Matters is coordinated by UNESCO's Social and Human Sciences Sector. It is part of the \"Initiative for Youth,\" a global project by Nestlé, and the UNESCO Global Youth Scholarship Plan.\n\nIn Mexico, the Sector strengthens the knowledge, skills, capacities, and attitudes of public and private actors, civil society, and academia to enhance inclusive public policies, promote the ethical approach to sciences and technologies, and facilitate dialogue spaces to mobilize the construction of peaceful, inclusive, and resilient societies from an intercultural, gender, and social transformation perspective."
