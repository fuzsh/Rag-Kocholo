He is a resident of Woodbury and acted as one of the Governor's top enforcers. In the television series, he serves as the secondary antagonist of the second half of Season 3 and an anti-villain in Season 4. In the comic series, he serves as a supporting antagonist in Volume 5: The Best Defense and the secondary antagonist of Volume 6: This Sorrowful Life.\n\nIn the TV series, he was portrayed by Jose Pablo Cantillo, who also portrayed Amerika from Chappie.\n\nComic Book Series[]\n\nMartinez in the comic book series is a fence guard who first appears when he allowed Rick Grimes, Michonne and Glenn into Woodbury to meet the Governor. After they are tortured by the Governor, Martinez realized how evil the Governor truly was and helped the three escape. When they arrive at the prison, Martinez sneaks away in an attempt to inform the citizens of Woodbury of the location of the prison. On his way back to Woodbury though, Martinez was stopped by Rick, who ran him over with the RV. Martinez admits that he was sent by the Governor, but also says that he intended to bring the good citizens, not the Governor and his men. Rick, however, strangled Martinez to death, saying that he doesn't know what people are capable of. Martinez' head was then found by a Woodbury scouting party, who brought back his reanimated head as a form of propaganda for the Governor to use to rally the townspeople and attack the prison.\n\nTelevision Series[]\n\nIn the AMC TV series, Martinez is one of the Governor's allies. After Merle Dixon was betrayed by the Governor, Martinez became his second-in-command. In the episode \"Arrow On The Doorpost\", Martinez reveals to Daryl that his family was killed by walkers, thus creating his hatred for them. In \"Welcome To The Tombs\", Martinez joined the assault on the prison. After it failed, he joined the Governor in wanting to go back, but then watched in horror along with Shumpert as the Governor massacred all the citizens that resisted. Although he is horrified, Martinez still joins the Governor as he, Martinez and Shumpert drive off to an unknown location.\n\nIn Season 4 episode 6 \"Live Bait\", Martinez and Shumpert abandoned the Governor because of what he did and because he is \"dead weight\" to them. They continued travelling together but Shumpert was bitten by a walker and Martinez had to kill him. In the episode \"Dead Weight\", Martinez is shown to lead another group of survivors. They meet the Governor, who is accompanied by a family, and Martinez accepts them into his group but demands that each of them helps in the group. One day, a drunken Martinez takes the Governor on top of an RV where they play golf. There, he says that maybe he and the Governor could form a partner-based leadership, to which the Governor becomes enraged and hits him over the head with a golf club. He then kicks him off the RV and drags him over to a walker pit, yelling \"I don't want it\" as he lowers a screaming Martinez into the pit where the walkers devour the perished Martinez. In the aftermath, others assume that he got drunk at night and fell onto the walker pit where he perished.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nNovel Series[]\n\n\"Rise of the Governor\"\n\n\"The Road to Woodbury\"\n\n\"The Fall of the Governor\"\n\nComic Series[]\n\nVolume 5: The Best Defense[]\n\nIssue 27\n\nVolume 6: This Sorrowful Life[]\n\nIssue 31\n\nIssue 32\n\nIssue 33\n\nIssue 34\n\nIssue 35\n\nIssue 36\n\nVolume 8: Made To Suffer[]\n\nIssue 43 (Flashback)\n\nVolume 13: Too Far Gone[]\n\nIssue 75 (Back-Up Story)\n\nTV Series[]\n\nSeason 3[]\n\n3x03: \"Walk With Me\"\n\n3x05: \"Say The Word\"\n\n3x07: \"When the Dead Come Knocking\"\n\n3x08: \"Made To Suffer\"\n\n3x09: \"This Sorrowful Life\"\n\n3x10: \"Home\"\n\n3x11: \"I Ain't a Judas\"\n\n3X13: \"Arrow on the Doorpost\"\n\n3x14: \"Prey\"\n\n3x15: \"This Sorrowful Life\"\n\n3x16: \"Welcome to the Tombs\"\n\nSeason 4[]\n\n4x06: \"Live Bait\"\n\n4x07: \"Dead Weight\"\n\nGallery[]\n\nComics[]\n\nTV Series[]"
