If you are suffering from this deadly condition, reach out to our Tijuana team to discuss a duodenal switch. Call (619) 484-9903 today to get started.\n\nWeight loss is often a frustrating journey, and sometimes traditional weight loss methods such as diet and exercise just aren't enough.\n\nDr. Sandy Martinez and her staff in Tijuana, Mexico, are recognized to be the surgical team that performs the most duodenal switches annually in the entire world. Dr. Martinez is double board-certified, and she uses state-of-the-art technology that meets U.S. standards. Low costs mean bariatric weight loss surgery is more attainable for more patients.\n\nDon't risk your health and live with weight-related pain and other issues. Request a free consultation at our Tijuana bariatric surgery office by using our online form or call us today at:\n\n(619) 484-9903\n\nDuodenal switch is recognized as a more complex procedure than other bariatric surgeries like gastric sleeve or gastric bypass. It also has a slightly higher complication rate than these other surgeries. Due to these facts, it is extremely important that you entrust your duodenal switch to a highly qualified team that has vast expertise in this complicated operation.\n\nOur team performs more of these procedures than any other provider in the world, so we know how to predict and prevent complications while executing a duodenal switch surgery that is extremely effective. As an added plus, all procedures at our Tijuana facility are performed by board-certified surgeons who are accompanied by a certified anesthesiologist. To explore how you can benefit from elite care, reach out to our practice today.\n\n(619) 484-9903\n\nYou may be a candidate for duodenal switch bariatric surgery if:\n\nYour BMI is above 55\n\nYou are 40 or older\n\nYou have comorbidities like metabolic syndrome, diabetes, hypertension, high levels of cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, joint pains, or any obesity-related illness\n\nYou have had unsuccessful bariatric surgery, such as sleeve gastrectomy, and have regained some or all of the weight\n\nYou have attempted traditional weight loss methods with little or no success\n\nWe hear time and again that American patients have been told they are not good bariatric surgery candidates for various reasons. We know this can be utterly heartbreaking. You're not just a number to us. We pride ourselves on helping people with complex needs find a viable solution.\n\nAn initial consultation is needed first. During your initial consultation, Dr. Martinez will go over your medical history and your weight loss goals to determine if you are a candidate for a duodenal switch. It is important that you let Dr. Martinez know if you have type 2 diabetes, heart disease, or other health concerns. You will then schedule your surgery with our coordinator.\n\nAlthough duodenal switch surgery is intensive, there are fewer risks when it is performed by a focused bariatric surgeon and a dedicated team. Consistency and dependability describe Dr. Martinez' focus. She values quality results over speed and recognition.\n\nWeight loss surgery can greatly improve the quality of your life, giving you the opportunity to be more active and boost your self-esteem. When performed by a double-certified bariatric surgeon like Dr. Martinez, duodenal switch surgery comes with lower risks and high rewards.\n\nRequest a free consultation online, or call our Tijuana office:\n\n(619) 484-9903\n\nAs a result of a duodenal switch, you will have to take vitamins and nutritional supplements for the rest of your life. By taking your daily recommended dose of Vitamins A, K, D, and B12, your body will remain healthy and you'll have an easier time maintaining your target weight. Our Tijuana team will provide you with a list of vitamins and mineral supplements you should take.\n\nWe offer an all-inclusive package in Tijuana, Mexico, starting at $6,750 (limited time offer) that is significantly less than the cost of surgery in the United States or Canada. We also offer a financing option to help cover the costs of your duodenal switch surgery. However, certain things are an additional expense, including:\n\nTake home medications\n\nAdditional nights in the hotel or hospital\n\nCompanion expenses\n\nAdditional procedures such as hiatal hernia repairs\n\nDuring your initial consultation, you will be able to discuss the total costs of your surgery and what out-of-pocket costs you should expect.\n\nContact us to learn more about our financing options.\n\nThe duodenal switch is such an effective procedure in large part because it pairs a sleeve gastrectomy with an intestinal bypass, optimizing the effects of the two. While it is an ideal solution for many of our patients, you might benefit from one of these procedures on its own.\n\nThe only way to learn more about your ideal treatment is to reach out to our office. Dr. Sandy Martinez and her bilingual team will conduct a thorough evaluation of your goals, concerns, and needs. We want to help you make a confident, empowered decision whether you elect for a duodenal switch, gastric sleeve, or gastric bypass.\n\nOur entire practice is constantly training in the most cutting-edge bariatric surgery technologies and techniques. You can trust we will make the best recommendation for your unique situation."
