        "text": "Aztec Surnames: a Modern Link to a Proud Hertiage\n\nWe’re very grateful to a good friend of ours, Scott Hadley - teacher, researcher, student of Nahuatl and resident of San Andrés, Cholula - for this unusual, refreshing and personal study of Nahuatl surnames from Cholula, many of which will not have changed for centuries...\n\nPic 1: Cover and first page of the 1973 Horcasitas article (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nThis article explores an interesting branch of what is technically called “anthroponymy,” or rather, the study of personal names. In particular, we are going to look at the Aztec or Nahuatl surnames that still exist in the territories where Nahuatl was either spoken at one time or still is today. Back in 1973, the distinguished mexicanist Fernando Horcasitas wrote an article that provides a very thorough look at this fascinating subject and thus it is also the basis for this introduction.\n\nFirst, he describes the prehispanic system of name giving and divides it into five key categories. To begin with, there were the calendar names or tonaltoca which literally translates as “day names.” These names were given by an Aztec astrologer and usually signified the birth date of the child or the date of some other important observance surrounding the birth. Next there was the tlalticpactoca or “world name.” These can be based on natural phenomena like a comet (citlalpopoca or “star that smokes”) that coincided with the child’s birth. Also names of gods can be used like Tlaloc, Tlaltecuhtli etc., and these were used until the very late era of the Aztecs. Names can also be associated with toponyms or place names and they usually end in -tecatl which means an inhabitant of a certain place. Such examples can be found in names like Zempoaltecatl which designates someone who is from the ancient city of Zempoala (also spelled Cempoala) and Xochitecatl which indicates that someone is from Xochitlan (Horcasitas 1973:277). Finally some names can also be given after infancy to indicate a title or other honor that the person had acquired in his or her lifetime.\n\nPic 2: Patio de los altares, main pyramid, Cholula, with the church of Nuestra Señora de los Remedies on the hilltop (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nHowever, Horcasitas warns us that none of the surnames that survive today are the product of this complex system but are only the relics of the past that have been handed down from generation to generation without many of their owners being aware of their historic origin or meaning. He also prophesied back in 1973 that many of these surnames would disappear before long due to the pressure that the indigenous people experience when trying to mainstream themselves into a modern world. However, I have happily seen nothing of the kind as I explore graveyards, signs with the names of the sponsors for local festivities, names of political candidates on posters and even class lists with the names of my English students. Thus, these surnames to me are very living relics that are visible every day even though they have a mysterious past in many cases. In the list below, I have mainly limited my sources to names found in Cholula and its environs although names from other places will crop up like the names from class lists which belong to students from other areas. It is not a very scholarly list but, it is a very personal one that is the product of my own informal field work. The translations of the names in brackets come from Horcasitas, the capsules of a local radio station and my own elementary knowledge of the language. If a translation is in doubt, I place a question mark next to it. In short, it is a list that is more of an expression of my appreciation and interest for the Nahuatl language and it is hoped that it can be used to encourage people to preserve this fascinating heritage for future generations.\n\n*Coyopol (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nNahuatl Surnames from Cholula\n\nAca (Short for acatl cane?)\n\nAcxotlan 1761 (Appears in the Puebla phonebook for 2008 as “Axotlan”)\n\nAmaxal (paper made of sand; Acatepec; south of Cholula found in Axocotzin Radio)\n\nAzcatl (ant: Horcasitas 1973:274 )\n\nChapul (variation of Chapulin below?)\n\nChapula\n\nChapulin (from grasshopper)\n\nCoatl (serpent)\n\nCocolo (same as below?
