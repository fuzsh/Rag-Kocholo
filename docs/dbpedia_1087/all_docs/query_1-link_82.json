        "text": "Telling our stories – Cristina Martínez Montes\n\nEach year we meet incredible women at womENcourage™ celebrations. We ask womENcourage participants to tell their stories in blog posts. We continue 2023 with Cristina Martínez Montes, who is currently a PhD student at Chalmers University in Sweden in the Computer Sciences department. She attended womENcourage 2023 in Trondheim and initialy pursued social sciences.\n\nMy name is Cristina Martinez Montes, and I’m currently a PhD student at Chalmers University in Sweden in the Computer Sciences department. My background, however, lies in the realm of social sciences. Attending the womENcourage event for the first time was an eye-opening experience, as it allowed me to meet remarkable women from diverse backgrounds who share a common interest in technology.\n\nI initially pursued social sciences, driven by a passion for understanding human behaviour and well-being. However, my interest in technology and its potential to positively impact mental health led me to venture into the world of computer sciences. I believe technology can play a pivotal role in addressing mental health challenges, and I am committed to exploring various ways to achieve this.\n\nThroughout my journey, a combination of curiosity, determination, and support from mentors and peers has been crucial. My academic advisors and colleagues have provided invaluable guidance as I navigated a field distinct from my initial background. Their support has been instrumental in my transition and learning process.\n\nDuring my journey in the IT field, I have learned that the biggest challenges for women in technology often stem from stereotypes and biases. There is an ongoing need for more diversity and inclusivity in the tech industry. However, this also presents an opportunity for us women to make our mark by bringing fresh perspectives and innovative solutions to the field.\n\nTo women considering a path similar to mine, I would say, “Embrace the challenges, for they are opportunities in disguise.” Don’t be deterred by imposter syndrome or setbacks; instead, view them as integral parts of your journey. Seek mentorship and connect with a supportive community, as networking is a powerful tool for personal and professional growth. One significant challenge I faced was transitioning from social sciences to computer sciences. It was an adjustment that required a considerable amount of effort, but it allowed me to develop a multidisciplinary perspective that I now consider one of my strengths.\n\nThis was my first womENcourage event, and it exceeded my expectations. Meeting inspiring women from various tech disciplines and backgrounds left a lasting impression. The most enjoyable aspects of this year’s program were the insightful keynotes, engaging workshops, and the chance to connect with like-minded individuals. It was an enriching experience that opened new horizons for my career.\n\nWomENcourage inspires me to continue pushing the boundaries of my academic and professional pursuits, and to be a part of a supportive community that advocates for gender diversity in technology.\n\nFor women planning to attend womENcourage in the future, I would recommend being open to new perspectives and seizing every opportunity for learning and networking. The event offers a unique platform for personal and professional growth, and the connections made there can be invaluable in your journey."
