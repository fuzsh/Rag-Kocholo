        "text": "Beautiful, vibrant-looking 60s actress Wende Wagner (her real name) was born in Connecticut in 1941. Of French, German and Native American heritage, her exotic looks would later serve her well on TV and in motion pictures. She inherited her athletic genes from her parents; her father was a former Olympic swimming/diving coach turned Naval Commander and her mother was a champion downhill skier.\n\nThe sweet-looking beauty entered the entertainment arena as a model and made her TV debut in 1959 on the Wagon Train (1957) western series. Very much a free spirit, she was more interested in surfing and traveling around the world than a career. She combined both passions when she earned work as an underwater female stunt double for Lloyd Bridges on his hit series Abenteuer unter Wasser (1958) as well as the TV series The Aquanauts (1960), which took her to ideal tropical settings. She also stunted for such movies as Der Schatz der Balearen (1960) co-starring Joanne Dru and Mark Stevens.\n\nOn that movie set, she met and subsequently married fellow stunt diver Courtney Brown (he was Mr. Stevens' double in that film), who coached her in underwater shooting. They had a daughter, Tiffany. During this time, they based their lives in the Bahamas where most of their shooting occurred. They divorced, however, after a short time and she returned to Hollywood where she won the role of an Apache girl in the movie Rio Conchos (1964) with Richard Boone, Anthony Franciosa and Stuart Whitman. A few years later, she married actor James Mitchum, Robert Mitchum's eldest son, but they too split. Wende's career continued in the 60s with a couple of movies and a role in the Die gr√ºne Hornisse (1966) TV adventure series but she eventually dropped out of sight. Little was heard from her until reports of her death from cancer in 1997.\n\nThe less famous, but still undeniably talented, of the \"Marilyn\" sex symbols of the 1940s/'50s was born Marvel Marilyn Maxwell in Clarinda, Iowa on August 3, 1920 (she later began using her middle name professionally at the suggestion of Louis B. Mayer). As a teenager, she worked as an usher at the Rialto Theater in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and later as a radio singer.\n\nIn 1942, Maxwell signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, appearing on such radio shows as \"The Abbott and Costello Show\", \"Beat the Band\", and \"Stars Over Hollywood\". That same year, she made her movie debut in the star-studded World War II propaganda film Stand by for Action (1942). She went on to star in such popular movies of the 1940s/50s as Nacht der tausend Sterne (1943), Abenteuer im Harem (1944), Zwischen Frauen und Seilen (1949), Ein charmanter Flegel (1950), The Lemon Drop Kid (1951) (in which she introduced the carol \"Silver Bells\"), and 5 auf einen Streich (1958). Throughout World War II, and later the Korean War, she accompanied three-time co-star (and off-screen lover) Bob Hope on USO tours to entertain troops.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Maxwell directed her focus to television, with guest appearances on such series as The Colgate Comedy Hour (1950), General Electric Theater (1953), The Red Skelton Show (1951), The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show (1956), and Playhouse 90 (1956). This continued into the '60s, as Maxwell appeared on Wagon Train (1957), Make Room for Daddy (1953), Amos Burke (1963), The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962), and The Bob Hope Show (1950), and even game shows such as I've Got a Secret (1952) and Pantomime Quiz (1947). Her most prominent part in this period was that of diner owner Grace Sherwood on Bus Stop (1961), a series she left after one season after becoming bored of \"doing nothing but pour a second cup of coffee and point the way to the men's room\".\n\nMaxwell was married three times - to actor John Conte, restaurateur Anders Nylund McIntyre, and producer Jerry Davis - each marriage ending in divorce. She had one son with Davis, Matthew (b. 1956). On March 20, 1972, 15 year-old Matthew returned home from school, only to find his mother dead from an apparent heart attack. Maxwell was 51 at the time of her death.\n\nJill Ireland was a British-American actress best known for her appearance as \"Leila Kalomi,\" the only woman Mr. Spock ever loved (in the Raumschiff Enterprise (1966) episode, This Side of Paradise (1967)) and for her many supporting roles in the movies of Charles Bronson. She is also known for her battle with breast cancer, having written two books on her fight with the disease and serving as a spokesperson for the American Cancer Society.\n\nJill Dorothy Ireland was born in London on April 24, 1936, to wine merchant Jack Ireland and his wife Dorothy, who were fated to outlive their daughter. Young Jill started her entertainment career at age 16 as a dancer, and made her screen debut in 1955, in Michael Powell's Fledermaus 1955 (1955). On May 11, 1957, she married actor David McCallum, whom she met on the set of the Stanley Baker action picture Duell am Steuer (1957). In the mid-'60s, they moved to the United States so McCallum could star as agent \"Ilya Kuryakin\" in the TV series Solo f√ºr O.N.K.E.L. (1964). She got steady work on American television and would co-star with her husband in five episode of the series in 1964, 1965 and 1967.\n\nIreland separated from McCallum, with whom she had two biological sons and one adopted son, in June 1965. He filed for divorce in August 1966, and it was finalized in February 1967. On October 5, 1968, she married Charles Bronson, who was 15 years her senior and still several years away from coming into his own as a leading man. They had first met when McCallum introduced them on the set of Gesprengte Ketten (1963). With Bronson, she had two children, a daughter born to the couple in 1971, and an adopted daughter. They first co-starred together in the 1970 French movie Der aus dem Regen kam (1970), which made Bronson a major star in Europe (she had first played an uncredited bit part in his movie Der Amerikaner (1970), released that same year). They starred in 13 more pictures over the next 17 years, a period during which Bronson and Ireland rivaled Clint Eastwood and Sondra Locke as the most prolific screen couple. During her marriage to Bronson, Ireland appeared in only one TV episode, one TV movie and one theatrical picture that didn't star her husband.\n\nShe was diagnosed with cancer in her right breast in 1984 and underwent a mastectomy. She wrote about her battle and became an advocate for the American Cancer Society, which led to the organization giving her its Courage Award. Ireland was presented with the award by President Ronald Reagan. Tragically, she lost her battle with the disease after it metastasized and died at her home in Malibu, California, on May 18, 1990, aged only 54. She was survived by her husband, children, stepchildren, parents, brother, and extended family.\n\nOn November 12, 1929, Grace Patricia Kelly was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to wealthy parents. Her girlhood was uneventful for the most part, but one of the things she desired was to become an actress which she had decided on at an early age. After her high school graduation in 1947, Grace struck out on her own, heading to New York's bright lights to try her luck there. Grace worked some as a model and made her debut on Broadway in 1949. She also made a brief foray into the infant medium of television. Not content with the work in New York, Grace moved to Southern California for the more prestigious part of acting -- motion pictures. In 1951, she appeared in her first film entitled Vierzehn Stunden (1951) when she was 22. It was a small part, but a start nonetheless. The following year she landed the role of Amy Kane in Zw√∂lf Uhr mittags (1952), a western starring Gary Cooper and Lloyd Bridges which turned out to be very popular. In 1953, Grace appeared in only one film, but it was another popular one. The film was Mogambo (1953) where Grace played Linda Nordley. The film was a jungle drama in which fellow cast members, Clark Gable and Ava Gardner turned in masterful performances. It was also one of the best films ever released by MGM. Although she got noticed with High Noon, her work with director Alfred Hitchcock, which began with Bei Anruf Mord (1954) made her a star. Her standout performance in Das Fenster zum Hof (1954) brought her to prominence. As Lisa Fremont, she was cast opposite James Stewart, who played a crippled photographer who witnesses a murder in the next apartment from his wheelchair. Grace stayed busy in 1954 appearing in five films. Grace would forever be immortalized by winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Georgie Elgin opposite Bing Crosby in Ein M√§dchen vom Lande (1954). In 1955, Grace once again teamed with Hitchcock in √úber den D√§chern von Nizza (1955) co-starring Cary Grant. In 1956, she played Tracy Lord in the musical comedy Die Oberen Zehntausend (1956) which also starred Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby. The whimsical tale ended with her re-marrying her former husband, played by Crosby. The film was well received. It also turned out to be her final acting performance. Grace had recently met and married Prince Rainier of the little principality of Monaco. By becoming a princess, she gave up her career. For the rest of her life, she was to remain in the news with her marriage and her three children. On September 14, 1982, Grace was killed in an automobile accident in her adoptive home country. She was just 52 years old.\n\nPatricia Mart√≠nez better known as Patrice Martinez was a Mexican-American actress. She had a strong background in theatre acting. However, her talents were not limited to the stage. Her resume manifests a \"well-rounded\" acting career that is complemented by her film and television credits. She began her career in her early teens, when she was working as an extra in Convoy (1978) starring Kris Kristofferson and directed by Sam Peckinpah. After catching the director's eye, Peckinpah offered her a speaking role.\n\nStill a teenager, Patrice became the lead stage actress for \"La Compa√±√≠a\", a bilingual theatrical repertory company founded by her mother, Margarita Mart√≠nez, and her mentor, Jose Rodr√≠guez. Graduating early from high school, this diligent actress followed the footsteps of some very distinguished actors when she decided to seek formal training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London, one of the world's most prestigious and respected drama schools. Among 3000 aspiring actors from around the world vying for the only 23 coveted entries that were offered, Patrice was awarded the sole scholarship of her term. Upon her graduation from RADA, she was honored with five of the most prominent awards the academy has to commend.\n\nPatrice returned to the US after finishing her studies at RADA and moved from her home state of New Mexico to California. After being in Hollywood for only a couple of months, she was cast in a lead role in her first feature film, A Walk on the Moon (1987). Shortly thereafter she was cast in another leading role in the hit comedy Drei Amigos! (1986) starring Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short and directed by John Landis.\n\nProducer Chas. Floyd Johnson selected her as Tom Selleck's love interest in Magnum (1980), and out of all his leading ladies she was the only one asked back to reprise her role in the final episode. In the interim she guested on Miami Vice (1984) with Don Johnson and Edward James Olmos. She also appeared in the films Beetlejuice (1988) with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davisand The Effects of Magic (1998), among others. She even managed to sneak in appearances in a few music videos with Morris Day and a double feature with Robbie Robertson.\n\nOne of the highlights of her professional career was when she began to appear in international productions, such as her role in the series Zorro - Der schwarze R√§cher (1990), shot was for the Family Channel in Spain. Thereafter she worked on several other European projects, namely Winnetous R√ºckkehr (1998) for German television.\n\nDiana Dors was born Diana Mary Fluck on October 23, 1931 in Swindon, Wiltshire, England. She and her mother both nearly died from the traumatic birth. Because of the trauma, her mother lavished on Diana anything and everything she wanted--clothes, toys and dance lessons were the order of the day. Diana's love of films began when her mother took her to the local movies theaters. The actresses on the screen caught Diana's attention and she said, herself, that from the age of three she wanted to be an actress. She was educated in the finest private schools, much to the chagrin of her father (apparently he thought private education was a waste of money). Physically, Diana grew up fast. At age 12, she looked and acted much older than what she was. Much of this was due to the actresses she studied on the silver screen and Diana trying to emulate them. She wanted nothing more than to go to the United States and Hollywood to have a chance to make her place in film history. After placing well in a local beauty contest, Diana was offered a role in a thespian group (she was 13).\n\nThe following year, Diana enrolled at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) to hone her acting skills. She was the youngest in her class. Her first fling at the camera was in Der Mann, der zum M√∂rder wurde (1947). She did not care that it was a small, uncredited role; she was on film and at age 16, that's all that mattered. That was quickly followed by Dancing with Crime (1947), which consisted of nothing more than a walk-on role. Up until this time, Diana had pretended to be 17 years old (if producers had known her true age, they probably would not have let her test for the role). However, since she looked and acted older, this was no problem. Diana's future dawned bright in 1948, and she appeared in no less than six films. Some were uncredited, but some had some meat to the roles. The best of the lot was the role of Charlotte in the classic Oliver Twist (1948). Throughout the 1950s, she appeared in more films and became more popular in Britain. Diana was a pleasant version of Marilyn Monroe, who had taken the United States by storm. Britain now had its own version.\n\nDiana continued to play sexy sirens and kept seats in British theaters filled. She really came into her own as an actress. She was more than a woman who exuded her sexy side, she was a very fine actress as her films showed. As the 1960s turned into the 1970s, she began to play more mature roles with an effectiveness that was hard to match. Films such as Craze - D√§mon des Grauens (1974), Every Afternoon (1972), The Amorous Milkman (1975) and Three for All (1975) helped fill out her resume. After filming Steaming (1985), Diana was diagnosed with cancer, which was too much for her to overcome. The British were saddened when word came of her death at age 52 on May 4, 1984 in Windsor, Berkshire, England.\n\nBorn in Burbank, California, USA on October 18, 1960, Erin Moran was the youngest daughter of Sharon and Edward Moran, who have five other children. She attended Walter Reed Junior High School for one year and North Hollywood High School for another year. Her first professional acting job was in a TV commercial. She played Richie Cunningham's baby sister, Joanie Cunningham, on ABC's Happy Days (1974); however, this was not Erin's first major TV series. She was a regular on the series, Daktari (1966). She has also made guest appearances on TV series such as Die Waltons (1972), Lieber Onkel Bill (1966), Meine drei S√∂hne (1960), Eddies Vater (1969), Rauchende Colts (1955), The Smith Family (1971), and F.B.I. (1965).\n\nErin Moran has worked on feature films with Debbie Reynolds in Der t√ºrkisfarbene Bikini (1968), with Godfrey Cambridge in Ein Mann sieht schwarz (1970), and with Wayne Newton in 80 Schritte bis zum Gl√ºck (1969).\n\nLike many other child actors, Erin had difficulty finding roles as an adult. Following the cancellation of Happy Days (1974) in 1984, she made occasional guest appearances on scripted and reality shows. She eventually moved away from Hollywood after her home was foreclosed on.\n\nOn April 22, 2017, she died in Corydon, Indiana, where she had been living with her husband of 23 years; she was 56 years old.\n\nBibi Besch, a talented actress, was born in Vienna, Austria, to Gotfrid K√∂chert, a renowned race car driver, and actress Gusti Huber. She had a busy career, especially as a supporting actress on TV, spanning over twenty years. Her exceptional performance in the TV series, Der Schein tr√ºgt (1992), earned her an Emmy award nomination in the category of Best Supporting Actress. Later in 1993, she was again nominated for her guest appearance in the TV series, Ausgerechnet Alaska (1990).\n\nBesch was a veteran of numerous television movies between 1976 and 1995. Despite her success on TV, she also appeared in several feature films, including the iconic role of Dr. Carol Marcus in Star Trek II - Der Zorn des Khan (1982). She also delivered remarkable performances in movies like Magnolien aus Stahl - Die St√§rke der Frauen (1989), Tremors - Im Land der Raketenw√ºrmer (1990), and Who's That Girl (1987). Besch was equally phenomenal on stage and acted in plays such as Fame, The Chinese Prime Minister, Here Lies Jeremy Troy, and Once For the Asking. She also made guest appearances on popular network shows like Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994) and Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984).\n\nBesch's acting talents knew no bounds, and her TV work ranged from the soap opera Somerset (1970) to Wei√ües Haus, Hintereingang (1979) to The Hamptons (1983). Sadly, Bibi Besch passed away at the young age of 54 on 7 September 1996, after a long battle with breast cancer. Her remarkable contributions to the entertainment industry continue to inspire many aspiring actors and actresses.\n\nAnn Sheridan won the \"Search for Beauty\" contest which carried with it a Paramount screen test. Signed to a contract at 18, she was put into a number of small roles under her real name of Clara Lou Sheridan. As she got better, her name was changed to Ann. In 1936, after two dozen films, she went to Warner Brothers, which billed her as the \"Oomph Girl,\" a name she despised -- although she certainly looked the part. She was allowed to mature into a leading star who could be the girl next door or the tough-as-nails dame. She was in a lot of comedies and a number of forgettable movies, but the public liked her, and her career flourished. She also gave great performances such as the singer in Tropische Zone (1940) and the waitress in Nachts unterwegs (1940). In 1948, she was dropped by Warner Bros., but came back in Howard Hawks' comedy Ich war eine m√§nnliche Kriegsbraut (1949) with Cary Grant. She continued to make films into the 1950s but retired before the end of the decade. She starred in the soap opera Another World (1964) and the western series Pistolen und Petticoats (1966). Unfortunately, just as her career was reviving with this series, she died of cancer.\n\nMinor league singer/actress Gale Robbins was a knockout-looking hazel-eyed redhead who made a modest dent in post-war Hollywood films. Born Betty Gale Robbins in Chicago, Illinois (some say Mitchell, Indiana) on May 7, 1921, she was the eldest of five daughters of Arthur E., a doctor, and Blanche Robbins, and educated at Chicago's Jennings Seminary at Aurora, Illinois and Flower Tech. Gale had a natural flair for music and appeared in glee clubs and church choirs in the early days. She graduated from her Chicago high school in 1939.\n\nShe started out in entertainment as a model for the Vera Jones Modeling School in Chicago, but her singing talents soon took over. Signed by a talent agency, she sang with Phil Levant's outfit in 1940 and later teamed with some male singers for a swing band that called themselves \"The Duchess and Her Dukes.\" She went on to work with some of the top radio and live 'big bands' of that era including the Jan Garber and Hal Kemp orchestras, her best showcase was working for Art Jarrett in 1941 when he took over Kemp's band.\n\n20th Century-Fox caught sight of this slim looker while she was singing for 'Ben Bernie (I)'s outfit and was quickly signed her up, her first film being the pleasant time-filler In the Meantime, Darling (1944). A semi-popular cheesecake pin-up, Gale appeared on the cover of \"Yank, The Army Weekly\" in 1944, was heard on radio, and toured with Bob Hope in Europe the next year. Her post-war parts, mostly sultry second leads, were typically lightweight in nature. She was often lent out to other studios and not always in a singing mode. Gale's better known film work includes Race Street (1948), T√§nzer vom Broadway (1949), Drei kleine Worte (1950), Seine Frau hilft Geld verdienen (1950) and Schwere Colts in zarter Hand (1953).\n\nGale went on to host the Hollywood House (1949) and also appeared on The Colgate Comedy Hour (1950) in 1951. In the late 50s the gal with the smooth and sexy vocal style released an easy-listening album (\"I'm a Dreamer\") for the Vik Label backed by Eddie Cano & His Orchestra. She covered such standards as \"Them There Eyes\" and \"What Is This Thing Called Love.\" After her final film appearance in Die Kanaille von Kansas (1958) and a few additional TV parts on such programs as \"Bourbon Street Beat,\" \"77 Sunset Strip,\" \"The Untouchables,\" \"Perry Mason\" and \"Mister Ed,\" Gale phased out her career to focus full-time on raising her family.\n\nMarried to her high school sweetheart Robert Olson in November of 1943 while he was serving in the Air Force, her husband turned to construction engineering as a career and they had two children. After her 47-year-old husband was tragically killed on February 4, 1967, in a building accident, a distraught Gale, left the States for a time with her two daughters, and decided to make a transatlantic comeback of sorts appearing in nightclubs in Japan and the Orient. She later was glimpsed in the film Jede Stimme z√§hlt (1972) and appeared on stage in Stephen Sondheim's musical \"Company\" in 1975. She also made ends meet as an interior decorator. Gale died of lung cancer in February of 1980, and interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery."
