        "text": "Drake Baldwin doesn’t get nearly as much hype as he deserves, plus how close is Rhett Lowder to making some noise in the majors?\n\nDemetrio Crisantes suffered two major injuries in high school, but now that he’s healthy, he’s showing what he can do. The best may be yet to come.\n\nRoboScout’s top players for this week include a first rounder who has returned to form, a DSL pitcher who is now lighting up Low-A and a sidearming Ranger.\n\nThe Orioles have tripled down on athletic college outfielders in the past three drafts. They have a clear rationale for taking Vance Honeycutt this year.\n\nA two-way player for two seasons in college, Steven Zobac has zoomed to Double-A in pro ball on the strength of his athletic ability.\n\nChandler Simpson and Craig Yoho have the Hot Sheet Show’s attention, plus a deep dive on the state of high school recruiting.\n\nGeoff Pontes welcomes an experienced dynasty baseball manager onto the podcast to discuss potential buys and sells heading into next season.\n\nIn this week’s 90th Percentile Podcast, Geoff Pontes & Matt Pajak look into how athleticism and top speed are evaluated in MLB prospects.\n\nWith the trade deadline now passed, J.J. Cooper and Geoff Pontes lead a deep-dive discussion on the state of each NL West organization."
