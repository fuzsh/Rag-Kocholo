        "text": "A cover letter (in the form of the body of the email) is not required but may be provided to quickly convey pertinent information to Submission Editors such as the title of the manuscript, reviewer suggestions or aversions, matters of funding/financial support, etc.\n\nSubmissions are evaluated by editors to determine whether the paper adheres to the Journal Scope and Aims and can move on to peer review. Papers are typically sent to two or three independent referees, and authors may suggest referee names, both for review and/or exclusion, with proper justification. Manuscripts may be submitted in English or Spanish, along with any additional abstracts in other languages. Page costs are currently $40 per page (journal subscribers receive a 15% discount), but these may be waived or reduced under certain circumstances. Please contact the editor and make arrangements before publication. Manuscripts are not rejected due to lack of financial support. All other editorial questions may be directed to Barney Lipscomb, jbrit@brit.org, Botanical Research Institute of Texas, 1700 University Drive, Fort Worth, Texas 76107-3400, U.S.A. 1-817-332-4441 voice; 1-817-332-4112 fax.\n\nPlease submit manuscripts at letter size (8.5 × 11 inches) in electronic format (doc, docx, rtf) as an email attachment (1-inch page margins, Times New Roman 11pt font, 1.5 line spacing, 0pt paragraph spacing). If absolutely necessary, submissions are also accepted by USPS mail with a single hard copy and on CD-ROM. For review purposes only, figures/illustrations may be submitted in low-resolution format (jpgs) as email attachments or they may be embedded in the manuscript/doc file.\n\nUpon acceptance for publication, the manuscript may be submitted as an email attachment or returned in the mail with a single hard copy and an electronic copy. If you have figures/illustrations in electronic format, they should be submitted at this time in high resolution tif format, scanned at the absolute best quality possible. Digital figures may be submitted on a CD-ROM disk or via a filesharing site (e.g., Dropbox) if they are too large for email. Typically b/w line drawings should be scanned at 600 dpi or higher and b/w half tones and color photos at 300 dpi. Full-page image/text size is 5½ × 8 inches (32.5 × 48 picas; 138 × 202 mm). If you need your figures/illustrations digitized, the editorial staff at the BRIT Press will be happy to handle any electronic digitization needs you have; all original material can be returned if requested.\n\nConsult the latest issue of J. Bot. Res. Inst. Texas (or Sida) for format of articles and notes regarding title, author, and address. Ranges of numbers are separated by double hyphens (6–8) OR the en-dash symbol. Footnotes, figure legends, appendices, and tables should be on separate pages and inserted at the end of the manuscript following references. Authors are encouraged to use the APG IV families, which can be accessed through the Missouri Botanical Garden research site (Angiosperm Phylogeny Website).\n\nLabel information should be provided for specimen citations in the label’s original language. No translation is necessary. Similarly, follow whatever unit of measure is provided on the label (e.g. metric or standard/English). Use the collector’s last name (or full name) and number (or “s.n.”) and italicize both. Abbreviate the months of the year by the first three letters of the month without a period. Separate country and state/region/subdivision names with periods with a colon following the terminal name (separating the locale names from the beginning of the locality description).\n\nExamples:\n\nU.S.A.

(1992a)”\n\nIn a list of parenthetical citations, arrange citations chronologically, then alphabetically, and separate the citations with a semicolon: “…by previous researchers (Williams 1970; Davis 2004; Marshall 2004).” If websites are referenced, then include the name of the website, URL, and the date accessed.\n\nDo not italicize “et al.” in the text. Do include the period after “al” as it is an abbreviation for “et alii/aliae.”\n\nEnd of article references should be cited as follows:\n\nArrange references alphabetically and chronologically, making use of a, b, etc. if an author had more than one publication in a given year.\n\nAuthors’ names are eventually printed in the journal using Cap/small caps, NOT ALL CAPS. Please type author names in Cap/small cap or in Cap/lower case, initializing all but the last name(s). Please note there is no space between multiple initials of a single author (Smith, A.B., not Smith, A. B.).\n\nOnly the first letter of the initial word, proper nouns, and proper adjectives of both article titles and book titles should be capitalized.\n\nJournal names should be capitalized and abbreviated as designated by Botanico-Periodicum-Huntianum.\n\nThere is no space after the colon when listing journal number and page numbers (Sida 4:1–21, not Sida 4: 1–21).\n\nItalicize all genus and species names.\n\nDo not italicize journal titles or book titles.\n\nYou do not have to indent each citation. We will format the entire list at once with hanging indent after submission.\n\nInclude the Digital Identifier or DOI or stable URL of the article, if one is available.\n\nFor all other formatting questions, see examples below.\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nTypical journal article citations\n\nBarrie, F.R., C.E.

A scale should be in or on the illustration or photograph; reduction will automatically reduce the scale and subject proportionately. In halftones, sharp glossy photographs with good contrast are necessary for good reproduction. You may also submit graphic materials in electronic format (tif, jpg, high res PDF, or other graphic image formats). If you are submitting your own digital scans, typically b/w line drawings should be scanned at 600 dpi or higher and b/w half tones and color photos at 300 dpi at the size of reproduction (5.5″ wide). Please consult the latest issue and/or the editor for additional information if needed. Color figures can be used, but an additional cost may be charged. Color slides/transparencies may be submitted for scanning. Please submit color prints or low resolution images for reviewing purposes. Captions and figures should be placed at the end of manuscript after references. For review purposes, figures may be embedded in text documents.\n\nTables and appendices should be presented as a unified, single sequence of tables and appendices. Placement order of these sections immediately following references: 1) tables, 2) figures, 3) appendices.\n\nFloristic papers are important, but they need to be more than a list of plants; they need added value, they need meat and context added. Such papers should emphasize the uniqueness of the floristic study area, physical characteristics, cultural and historical information, land use history, climate, major vegetational habitats, rare/endangered/special concern taxa, new county records, state records, disjuncts, invasives, etc. Lists in and of themselves are not that useful. Annotate your list as much as possible. The more annotations you can add to the checklist, the more value it will have. A list that provides ecological notes on rare and endangered taxa or other noteworthy taxa, State and Federal status on any rare and endangered species, and highlights and notes any endemics, disjuncts, or significant geographic distribution records, etc. is so much more valuable and useful. Conservation issues are also important, and any information and discussion on such would add considerable value to the paper.\n\nAlso note which and how many species are state-listed by the local Heritage Program if one exists. Summarize how many taxa occur in various classes of county numbers, which is informative for conservation of the state’s flora."
