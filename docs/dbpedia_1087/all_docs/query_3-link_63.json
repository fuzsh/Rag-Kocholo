Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points blow, raised during the review process.\n\nPlease submit your revised manuscript by Jul 25 2020 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at gro.solp@enosolp. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/ and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.\n\nPlease include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:\n\nA rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.\n\nA marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.\n\nAn unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes.

Howvere some revisions could be taken into account:\n\n- Abstract: in the conclusion maybe it would be more appropriate to say \"MRD should be implemented over sCR..\" since MRD is not yet in clinical practice and sCR could be still helpful nowdays.\n\n- Methods: usually patients caractheristics are in the results part, I suggest to put the table and the explanation in the first part of results.\n\n- MFC: probably MFC 4 color has too low sensitivity. How many events did you acquire?

Moreover, 4-colors flow used in the study is not appropriate considering its low sensitivity over 8 or 10-colors flow. Authors should comment on that as well.

They demontsrated that in a coohrt of MM patiemts ther is no difference in outcome in pts < sCR vs > scR. Howvere some revisions could be taken into account:\n\n- Abstract: in the conclusion maybe it would be more appropriate to say \"MRD should be implemented over sCR..\" since MRD is not yet in clinical practice and sCR could be still helpful nowdays\n\nWe agree with your suggestion and have modified abstract conclusion as follows:\n\n“We suggest that MRD categories should be implemented over sCR for the future classification of MM responses”\n\n- Methods: usually patients characteristics are in the results part, I suggest to put the table and the explanation in the first part of results.\n\nDescription of patients’ characteristics and the table have been moved to Results part.\n\n- MFC: probably MFC 4 color has too low sensitivity. How many events did you acquire? I think at least 8 colour MFC should be done ot at least to discuss a little bit in the discussion part the role of more sensitive techniques\n\nIn the discussion section, we added that although our MFC is 4-color, the acquisition of at least 2 million of events increases the sensitivity above 10-4, much higher that achieved with immunochemistry (about 1%). More sensitive techniques to evaluate MRD, as next-generation flow or NGS, improve the predictions of outcome. This has been confirmed in a recently published study using next generation cytometry to study MRD. An 82% of reduction in the risk of death or relapse is showed in MRD negative patients.\n\nReviewer #2: The authors should comment more on how MRD evaluation should complement sCR more than replacing it. Moreover, 4-colors flow used in the study is not appropriate considering its low sensitivity over 8 or 10-colors flow. Authors should comment on that as well. It would be important to add patients characteristics in the results section. English should be checked.\n\n4-color MFC has achieved an intermediate sensitivity if enough number of events are acquired. We include this explanation in discussion, as well as the relevance of more sensitive techniques for MRD analysis in the clinical setting.\n\nPatients characteristics have been moved to results section.\n\nEnglish has been checked by a native English spoken.\n\nWe hope we have answered appropriately your suggestions.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJoaquín Martínez-López\n\nAttachment\n\nSubmitted filename: Response to Reviewers-2.doc\n\n22 Jul 2020\n\nClinical significance of stringent complete response in multiple myeloma is surpassed by minimal residual disease measurements\n\nPONE-D-20-12394R1\n\nDear Dr. Martinez-Lopez,\n\nWe’re pleased to inform you that your manuscript has been judged scientifically suitable for publication and will be formally accepted for publication once it meets all outstanding technical requirements.\n\nWithin one week, you’ll receive an e-mail detailing the required amendments.
