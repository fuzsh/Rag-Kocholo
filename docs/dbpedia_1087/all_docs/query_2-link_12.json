        "text": "What is Sandy Koufax's Net Worth?\n\nSandy Koufax is an American former professional baseball pitcher who has a net worth of $5 million. Sandy Koufax played for MLB's Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers from 1955 to 1966. Considered one of the greatest pitchers in the history of baseball, he won four World Series titles and three Cy Young Awards, and also won three pitching Triple Crowns. Since his retirement from playing, Koufax has worked as a broadcaster for NBC and as a pitching coach in the Dodgers' farm system.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nSandy Koufax was born as Sanford Braun on December 30, 1935 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City to Jewish parents Evelyn and Jack. His parents divorced when he was three, and his mother remarried when he was nine. He would end up taking the surname of his stepfather, Irving Koufax. In his youth, Koufax was known for his prowess in basketball. At Lafayette High School, he captained the basketball team in his senior year and averaged 16.5 points per game. Koufax continued playing basketball at the University of Cincinnati, but soon switched to baseball. His skills as a pitcher eventually drew the attention of several baseball scouts, including Bill Zinser, Gene Bonnibeau, Ed McCarrick, and Brooklyn Dodgers scout Al Campanis, who would go on to sign Koufax. During his first MLB season, Koufax attended night classes in architecture at Columbia University.\n\nMLB Career, 1955-1960\n\nKoufax signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1955. He went on to have a solid rookie season, going 2-2 with a 3.02 ERA as the Dodgers won the NL pennant and then the World Series. It was the first World Series title in Dodgers franchise history, although Koufax didn't appear in the series. He had a less successful season in 1956, posting a 4.91 ERA. In preparation for the 1957 season, Koufax was sent to Puerto Rico to play winter baseball with the Criollos de Caguas. With the team, he pitched two shutouts. Back with the Dodgers for the 1957 season, he pitched a complete game against the Chicago Cubs in May. After that season, the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles. Koufax had a rough season in 1958 due to an ankle sprain and persistent back pain; as a result, he went 11-11 and led the league in wild pitches. He performed much better in 1959, when he set the NL single-game record with 18 strikeouts. The Dodgers went on to win the 1959 World Series over the Chicago White Sox. Following that successful season, Koufax had a disappointing season in 1960, going 8-13 with a 3.97 ERA. Frustrated with himself, he threw his gloves and spikes into the trash at the end of the season and vowed to quit baseball.\n\nMLB Career, 1961-1966\n\nDespite his decision to leave baseball behind, Koufax chose to give himself another year to improve. It turned out to be the right call, as he went on to dominate MLB from 1961 to 1965. In 1961, Koufax went 18-13 and led the league with an NL record of 269 strikeouts. The following season, he hit his first career home run and threw his first career no-hitter; his no-hitter also included his first immaculate inning. Koufax threw another immaculate inning in 1962 in a shutout of the Houston Colt .45s. He subsequently threw his second career no-hitter, against the San Francisco Giants. Koufax continued his incredible success in 1963, winning the first of his three Triple Crowns by leading the league in wins (25), strikeouts (306), and ERA (1.88). Moreover, he broke the record for single-season shutouts, with 11. For his exceptional season, Koufax won the NL MVP Award, the Cy Young Award, and the Hickok Belt. The Dodgers went on to face the New York Yankees in the 1963 World Series, and swept the team in four games. Koufax, who struck out 23 batters in 18 innings, was named the World Series MVP.\n\nEarly in the 1964 season, Koufax threw his third career immaculate inning, against the Cincinnati Reds. In the process, he became the first pitcher in MLB history to throw three immaculate innings. A couple of months later, he threw his third career no-hitter. Despite his auspicious start to the season, however, Koufax was plagued by arm troubles. In early August, he jammed his pitching arm, and later in the month woke up to a severely swollen elbow. Koufax was subsequently diagnosed with traumatic arthritis. Although unable to pitch again that season, he finished with a 19-5 record and an NL-leading 1.74 ERA. Under an exhaustive regimen of cortisone shots, ointments, and various drugs to treat his elbow, Koufax resumed pitching in 1965. That season, he won his second Triple Crown by leading the league with 26 wins, 382 strikeouts, and a 2.04 ERA. He also claimed his second Cy Young Award. On September 9, 1965, Koufax threw a perfect game against the Chicago Cubs in his fourth career no-hitter. The Dodgers went on to win the 1965 World Series, with Koufax earning his second career World Series MVP Award.\n\nBefore the 1966 season, Koufax staged a joint holdout with fellow Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale. The pair demanded a fair negotiation and better contract terms from Dodgers general manager Buzzie Bavasi, whom they realized had been pitting them against one another. Considered the first major event in baseball's labor movement, the holdout came to an end after 32 days, with Koufax and Drysdale receiving significant salary raises. Koufax would play his final MLB season in 1966 due to his persistent arm problems. Despite the pain and occasional numbness, he posted a terrific 27-9 record with 317 strikeouts and a 1.73 ERA, earning him his third Triple Crown and third Cy Young Award. Koufax became the first pitcher ever to win three Cy Young Awards. In the final win of his career, he threw a complete game against the Philadelphia Phillies to clinch the NL pennant. The Dodgers were subsequently swept by the Baltimore Orioles in the 1966 World Series. A few weeks later, Koufax announced his retirement from baseball, at the age of 30.\n\nPost-playing Career\n\nNot long after his retirement from playing, Koufax signed a 10-year contract as a broadcaster on NBC. However, he felt uncomfortable in front of the camera, and quit after six years. In 1979, Koufax became a pitching coach in the Dodgers' farm system, and continued in that position until his resignation in 1990. Later, from 2013 to 2015, he worked as a special advisor to Dodgers chairman Mark Walter. Among his other activities, Koufax has been closely involved with the nonprofit Baseball Assistance Team, having served as a member of its advisory board.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nKoufax married his first wife, Anne Widmark, in 1969; they divorced in 1982. He was wed to his second wife, Kimberly Francis, from 1985 until their divorce in 1998. Koufax married his third wife, Jane Clarke, in 2008. He has no biological children, but has a stepdaughter from Clarke's previous marriage."
