        "text": "Claudia Martínez Garay is a Peruvian polyglot whose fluencies extend far beyond the spoken word. Using ceramics, painting, textiles, and, more recently, animation and music, she grinds layer upon layer of Andean cultural histories into a polarized, contemporary lens. So focused is she on this task that it took six years of living in Amsterdam for her to realize she had officially moved there. At that point she bought some plants and got back to work. Her newest exhibition, Ghost Kingdom, is on view at GRIMM.\n\n—Melissa Joseph\n\nMelissa Joseph I love your work so much! Each body of work is so specific and is embedded with its own mythologies. Can you talk about your concept for the show at GRIMM?\n\nClaudia Martínez Garay For most of my life I’ve been trying to share the same ideas, but the question is: How can I find subjects or mediums or different ways of trying to say the same things? It’s mostly related to the historic and social problems in Peru. When making work, I think about the tone of what I’m doing and the tone I want the viewer to have.\n\nFor this show, I’m presenting an animation titled Ayataki (2022), meaning “songs for the dead.” The video is based on ideas of the war in Peru during the time I was brought up and how that is still a very open wound. I was thinking about music as a bridge. For me this piece is a lament.\n\nMJ Have you worked in video before?\n\nCMG\n\nMy first video was ÑUQA KAUSAKUSAQ QHEPAYKITAPAS / I WILL OUTLIVE YOU (2017) which is an animated video of an ancient Moche ceramic held at an ethnological museum in Berlin. The second video is an animation in collaboration with artist Arturo Kameya, my partner. It’s not digitally perfect, but it’s important that Brown representation is entering that media. Usually you just see white bodies with white European thematics, so it’s important to immerse myself in media that are sometimes not open to me.\n\nMJ Can’t wait to see it. And what is showing upstairs?\n\nCMG Upstairs I am showing some works that I made before but never had a chance to show in New York. I’m continuing a series called Pachas (2020–), or the idea of time and space, but thinking in Andean perspective.\n\nMJ Those are the tapestries?\n\nCMG Yes, I’m presenting seven more of those. Each is a snapshot of what I’m thinking. The ideas behind Andean cosmovision are too complex to grasp in one work, so I decided to work in a series, each of them as an approach to what I read or speculate from the past. There are many cultures that I’m interested in, and it’s important to understand the very different civilizations that existed, one on top of the other, invading and conquering each other, and then all conquered by the Incas before being colonized and their culture erased by Spaniards and later suffering terrorism by the Shining Path group, not in a specific timeline but jumping to different moments because that is how I relate and learn from history.\n\nI don’t think about them as though one can say everything. That’s why I make such a large number. When I am reading and trying to understand what a concept means in Quechua, there are ideas that you find in books that have shifted and are very different.\n\nMJ I’m reminded of Emily Wilson’s translation of the Odyssey, the first time it’s been translated by a woman into English. Historically—and still—translators were disproportionately men. Your perspective matters because words carry several meanings, and if they’re only being interpreted by one group, whether homogenized by gender or race, we’re left with very limited versions of what these texts actually were about.\n\nCMG Translation is a big problem. In Peru, they don’t give it much importance. The fact that the majority of populations speak Quechua, and Lima doesn’t, is so hard. Many people don’t know how to read or speak Spanish, but they have to vote in Spanish. Also, a lot of oral things in Quechua need to be written down for more people to understand.\n\nMost archaeologists that worked on the cultures in Peru were European, and the texts we can find are from European scholars. They make very important writings, but it’s weird to read about those things through the eyes of a foreigner. It’s complex but also very interesting to reread them and to see what I can create or speculate from them.\n\nMJ How does it feel to be making the work that you’re making from the Netherlands? Does it give you some distance to think about it in a different way? Does it make it more difficult to access documents?\n\nCMG I wish I had more access, but luckily most museum collections or archives are being uploaded so it’s easier to share information in academia and open sources and libraries. I came to the Netherlands seven years ago for the Rijksakademie residency, which was something I really wanted to do. This residency was a dream come true because I could just focus on my work, but I never planned to stay here. I thought I was just doing a residency. I never even bought a plant. Last year was the first time I got plants and realized, Okay, I’m living here.\n\nI have been exposed to concepts living here that I didn’t know before. For example, I learned what entitled meant because I didn’t know how else to describe the other artists that I met. I also learned to talk about colonialism, because in Peru we didn’t discuss that when I was studying, and it is still not an important issue, as it should be. I started questioning myself about what it means to be Indigenous. As an artist, it’s very good to be here, because quality of life for an artist is better. Hopefully, in the future I can spend more time in Peru, and I hope to help in some way to improve the situation of artists in my own country.\n\nMJ Is anyone creating opportunities for artists in Peru?\n\nCMG There is growing interest in the artistic sector. Some people have started their own residences. In the past two years artists can apply for subsidized exhibitions in public spaces, but it tends to only show up in the capital. It’s not a lack of money; it’s corruption. I was a teacher in Peru for years and tried to guide students, but the infrastructure was not prepared for cultural development, as the artist’s career is not valued in a monetary way. Many artists work for free, and that is a change that has to be done at an institutional level.\n\nMJ Who are some of the artists you admire in Peru that we may not know about?\n\nCMG Jesús Ruiz Durand is a pioneer in digital art and one of the most interesting artists today. Juan Javier Salazar had the greatest stories and the most special humor and honesty in his work. I admire Sandra Gamarra’s strong, political painting and subtle, poetic approach.\n\nMJ Tell us something you want people to know about your work?\n\nCMG The most important thing is hearing things that sometimes you don’t want to hear. Things that happen in daily life to real people. They are not easy or fun to talk about: racism, classism, displacement. They should be discussed more in order for them to be real so that people can feel a bit of empathy when seeing the disproportionate inequality.\n\nMJ It’s powerful to shine light on these things, and you’re taking them to the ultimate colonizers: the Netherlands and Western Europe.\n\nCMG Yeah, I would feel much weirder if I were in Spain. But of course it’s different for every colonized country how to feel about their colonizer.\n\nMJ It’s good because there is a history of erasure with these stories. Not that the Dutch are your target audience; but by seeing the work and supporting you, they’re actually helping to recover these narratives.\n\nCMGI’m doing it for people that can share certain feelings. They may not be from Peru but from another country that has some similarities. In that sense these local issues are spread all over. I’m not locally pointing, but it’s important to discuss the ideas of tokenism, the disadvantaged countries and how they came to be like that, and those kinds of things.\n\nMJ I find tokenism to be a dangerous part of the conversation around race. I remember discussing it a few years ago with artist Jason Stopa, and he said something I haven’t forgotten: that people were mistaking representation for progress. I don’t have the solution, but it’s something to always consider living in this climate.\n\nCMG I have experiences where what I say is included because I represent a demographic that they need; but in other cases I feel heard or at least like I have the possibility to make myself heard. I really hope some day that the latter will be the majority and we can feel accompanied and more equal and not tokenized.\n\nMJ I love that word “accompanied” as a solution to tokenism.\n\nCMGWell, most of the time we are isolated, or we are just a few people of color in a big white room. Right now, especially in the States, I feel a strong growth around Latin American artists and artists that have a native origin. It’s a big step. The next step is for people who are artists, but not in the contemporary art world, to also have value and validation in terms of art history.\n\nClaudia Martínez Garay: Ghost Kingdom is on view at GRIMM in New York City until October 15; Martínez Garay’s work can also be seen in the group exhibition Who tells a tale adds a tail: Latin America and contemporary art at the Denver Art Museum in Denver until March 5, 2023."
