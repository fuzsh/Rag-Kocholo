        "text": "As Seen In\n\nMeet Sandra Maguir of Maguir\n\nBriefly walk us through your story – how you started and how you got to where you are today.\n\nMy full name is Sandra Martínez Aguirre. I started my musical quest from Madrid, Spain. I was born and raised there. I’ve been always very artistic and in my early years I realized that by being a Musician and specially a vocalist, I could communicate and convey my stories.\n\nIn addition, I was really involved in being in front of the camera. Acting was also one of my passions and music totally supported it by giving me the push I needed to utilize all of my talents. After a finished High School, I decided to move to the U.S. and master my craft in Los Angeles.\n\nHas it been a smooth road? If not, what were some of the struggles along the way?\n\nOnce I got to Los Angeles and started my Music studies at Musicians Institute, the goal began to look clearer and clearer: I wanted to become a professional music performer.\n\nIt sure was tough at times, specially as I found myself very far from my home and the people I love. America is a very different culture and I had to adapt slowly.\n\nNonetheless, what I ended up learning it’s more than I could ever describe or thank for. Making me the musician I am today.\n\nWhat do you do, what do you specialize in, what are you known for, etc. What are you most proud of as a company?\n\nAlthough I had performed live at different venues in Los Angeles including The Hotel Café, Hard Rock Café and other places as a backing vocalist and with cover bands, I knew I wanted something of my own.\n\nWith my artistic brand MAGUIR, I finally decided to put together a few songs that I wrote. I worked on my first EP “Defying” with my friend Dave America, who helped me produce it and with whom I have collaborated in a few projects after we met at music college.\n\nThe debut of “Defying” has been well received. I now look forward to perform it live everywhere.\n\nHow do you, personally, define success? What’s your criteria, the markers you’re looking out for, etc?\n\nThe word “Success” to me stands for that thing we pursue our whole life, doing what makes us feel true to oneself.\n\nIt can be anything. In my case, as long as one single person feels related, inspired, happy or not alone thanks to my music, my job has been fulfilled. And I can go to bed satisfied and happy to wake up to a new day to do it all over again.\n\nThat is my goal. That is success. I really hope to bring together as much people as I can through my music. Whether you are listening in your room or singing out loud with the crowd in one of my concerts."
