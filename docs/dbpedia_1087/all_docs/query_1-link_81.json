        "text": "¡Hola!\n\nMy name is Raúl Martínez and I will be teaching Spanish II as well as Spanish II Honors courses.\n\nAllow me to share some of my background to let you know a little bit about \"the Spanish teacher\".\n\nI was born in Santiago, Cuba and at an early age, my family relocated to Spain, where we lived for over 9 years. Here is where I completed my elementary and middle studies.\n\nAnother relocation brought the family to Puerto Rico, where I completed High School and started my studies in Science of Education, majoring in Spanish.\n\nAt that time, I enlisted in the U. S. Navy, serving 6 years, which took me back to Spain to serve at the Rota Naval Base in Cádiz, Spain, providing C-130 airlift logistics support to the U. S. Mediterranean fleet.\n\nUpon my Honorable Discharge, I completed my degree, graduated in the year 2000 and, while working as a teacher, I entered Law School at night. I graduated in 2005 and passed the Puerto Rico Bar Exam that same year. I taught and held office until my move to Texas in 2014.\n\nRed Oak is the second district I've had the opportunity to teach and couldn't have been happier. The facilities are excellent, the staff is very well-prepared and the support from the families is nothing but spectacular.\n\nMost of all, our students make RED OAK HIGH SCHOOL the best place to be, and I am ready to help the future get off with the right foot \"in two languages\".\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n\nConference Period: 6th Period\n\n¡Hasta pronto!"
