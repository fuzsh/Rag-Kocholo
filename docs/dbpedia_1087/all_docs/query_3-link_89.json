Please contact bancroft@library.berkeley.edu for availability and pricing.\n\nLiterary Industries: Chasing a Vanishing West\n\nBy Hubert Howe Bancroft and edited by Kim Bancroft, 2013\n\nA bookseller in San Francisco during the Gold Rush, Hubert Howe Bancroft (1832-1918) rose to become the man who would define the early history of California and the West. Creating what he called a \"history factory,\" he assembled a vast library of more than sixty thousand books, maps, letters, and documents; hired scribes to copy material in private hands; employed interviewers to capture the memories of early Spanish and Mexican settlers; and published multiple volumes sold throughout the country by his subscription agents. In 1890 he published an eight-hundred-page autobiography, aptly entitled Literary Industries.\n\nLiterary Industries sparkles with the exuberance of nineteenth-century California and introduces us to a man of great complexity and wit. Edited and abridged for the modern reader yet relating the history of the West as it was taking place—and as it was being recorded—Kim Bancroft's edition of Literary Industries is a joy to read.\n\nBeyond Words: 200 Years of Illustrated Diaries\n\nBy Susan Snyder, 2011\n\nBeyond Words is a collection of excerpts from 50 illustrated diaries spanning 200 years of adventure and contemplation. From the records of 18th-century Spanish explorer Pedro Font to those of a young David Brower first encountering the wilderness, these unfolding stories reveal as much about the times in which they were written as they do the diarists’ particular inner worlds. Whether filled with chicken-scratch sketches or gilded illuminations, these diaries have become objets d’art that expand our understanding of the uniquely compelling experiences of their creators—from anonymous writers to luminaries like LeConte and Muir, and from Beat poets to 12-year-old girls. Beyond Words is a fascinating and intimate collection that will inspire you to pull out pen and paper to capture the fleeting images and experiences of your own life.\n\nCelebrating Mexico\n\nEdited by Charles Faulhaber, 2010\n\nA generously illustrated bilingual catalogue, jointly published by The Stanford University Libraries and The Bancroft Library, commemorates the 200th anniversary of Mexico's independence from Spain and the 100th anniversary of the Mexican Revolution. It accompanies the concurrent \"Celebrating Mexico\" exhibits held at both institutions. In addition to three scholarly essays and a complete checklist of each library's exhibition, 86 full-color images drawn from the collections of both institutions illustrate aspects of Mexican Independence and significant events of the Revolution.\n\nBancroft Anniversary Poster\n\nBy David Lance Goines, 2009\n\nThis limited edition poster by renowned Berkeley artist David Lance Goines celebrates the 100th anniversary of The Bancroft Library at Berkeley and the 150th anniversary of its foundation.\n\nSongs of California: The U.C. Berkeley Tradition\n\nCompiled by the Cal Song Book Committee, 2007\n\nThe 1890s saw the beginning of the creation of Cal’s college songs, and that tradition continued strongly through the 1930s. Cal songs were played by the Cal Band and sung by all the living groups, spirit groups, and the Glee Club—not only at athletic events but also at all University occasions. In 1944, these representations of school spirit were compiled into a portable song book, Songs of California, from which students could learn them. The turbulent 1960s, however, took their toll on this musical tradition, and fewer and fewer students and alumni actually knew, sang, or played these wonderful songs. This new Songs of California is intended, as was its 1944 predecessor, to preserve Cal’s rich musical heritage and revitalize the singing and playing of these songs. It includes the selections of the earlier version, as well as a number of new ones written since the 1944 publication. The musical score, along with background history, is provided for each song.\n\nExploring The Bancroft Library\n\nCo-edited by Charles Faulhaber and Stephen Vincent, 2006\n\nOut of Print\n\nIn this centennial guide, readers are introduced to the day-to-day life of an institution devoted to the collection, preservation, and study of original documents. From an in-depth look at the way material is acquired and conserved to chapters by individual curators on the history and highlights of the collections entrusted to their care, this book celebrates Bancroft's one hundred years on the Berkeley campus.\n\nTestimonios: Early California through the Eyes of Women, 1815-1848\n\nBy Rose Marie Beebe and Robert M. Senkewicz, 2006\n\nFrom the editors of the highly influential Lands of Promise and Despair, here are thirteen women’s firsthand accounts from the time California was part of Spain and Mexico. Having lived through the Gold Rush and seen their country change so drastically, these women understood the need to tell the full story of the people and the places that were their California. Some of their words are translated here into English for the first time.\n\nUn Manuscrito Inédito de Poesías de José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi\n\nBy Nancy Vogeley, 2004\n\nNancy Vogeley examines the emergence of the novel in Mexico at the conclusion of Spain's 300 years of colonial rule. Acknowledged as Spanish America's first novelist, José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi introduced the genre into Mexico during its war of independence. His 1816 novel, El Periquillo Sarniento, became the symbol of new nationhood, and his commentary on social issues contributed to the revolutionary dialogue.\n\nDrawn West: Honeyman Collection of Western Americana\n\nBy Jack von Euw and Genoa Shepley, 2004\n\nOut of Print\n\nThe Honeyman Collection could be described formally as a collection of more than 2,300 items that focus on the visual interpretation of California and the West from 1790 through the early 1930s. During the days of exploration and settlement, the region was full of adventure, danger and wonders—and before there were cameras, artists depicted all of it.\n\nBear in Mind: The California Grizzly\n\nBy Susan Snyder, 2003\n\nOnce arguably the most powerful and terrifying animal in the California landscape, the grizzly now lives in the imagination, a disembodied symbol of the romantic West. More than 150 images from The Bancroft Library's collections—newspaper illustrations, paintings, photo albums, sheet music, settler's diaries, fruit crate labels, and more—accompany the bear stories of Indians, explorers, vaqueros, forty-niners, and naturalists.

Chiles, 1970\n\nJoseph B. Chiles was a colorful California pioneer. He was an assiduous fiddle player, a lover of jokes and joking, a devoted hunter of grizzlies, and a notable pathfinder on the California Trail. His interview is one of the scores that Hubert Howe Bancroft collected through his agents while working on his history. It is obviously unfinished, broken off almost between sentences, but there is no indication of the reason. This Keepsake also contains an interview with one of Chiles's sons by a highly inexperienced interviewer who did not know how to spell Chiles.\n\nKeepsake 17\n\nThe Life of George Henry Goddard\n\nBy Albert Shumate, 1969\n\nAn artist, architect, surveyor, and mapmaker, George Henry Goddard was a remarkable individual.

Camp, 1966\n\nThe term \"Desert Rats\" was \"a proud one and not lightly bestowed. Genuine burro prospectors were self-sufficient, self-reliant men; uninhibited lovers of independence and solitude.

Camp offers his remembrances of these unique Western figures in a Keepsake volume designed and printed by Lawton and Alfred Kennedy.\n\nKeepsake 13\n\nGPH: An Informal Record of George P.

Farquhar, 1964\n\nThe original journal kept by Bidwell during the 1841 migration to California by wagon train was never found.

Gregory Crampton, 1957\n\nThis is the second published volume of the diaries of Robert Eccleston. The first appeared under the title Overland to California on the Southwestern Trail, 1849. Like many participants in the Gold Rush, Robert Eccleston kept an excellent record of the journey to California only to break it off on arrival, December 28, 1849. After ten months in California, however, he returned to his diary to record his experiences in the Southern Mines during the years 1850 and 1851, centering on a war provoked when the miners intruded upon Indian lands.\n\nKeepsake 5\n\nRamblings in California: The Adventure of Henry Cerruti\n\nEdited by Margaret Mollins and Virginia Thickens, 1954\n\nAt Hubert Howe Bancroft’s request, Henry Cerruti began his account on October 6, 1874. Originally he had intended to describe his adventures in the Sonoma valley, but as his travels took him to different parts of the state, these too were added. In his work, Cerruti faithfully recorded his conversations with the pioneers, omitting only those which he wrote up at greater length for Bancroft's use. For this Keepsake, several Spanish passages that Cerruti included in his manuscript have been translated into English, and because Cerruti wrote spontaneously with little thought of formal organization, the text has been paragraphed and divided into chapters. The original manuscript is held by The Bancroft Library.\n\nKeepsake 4\n\nThe Opening of the California Trail\n\nEdited by George R. Stewart, 1953\n\nThis Keepsake recounts the story of the Stevens Party from the reminiscences of Moses Schallenberger, as set down for Hubert Howe Bancroft circa 1885. The Stevens Party set out for the Pacific Coast in the spring of 1844 and opened the first wagon road to California. This intrepid group is also credited with the discovery of Donner Pass.\n\nKeepsake 3\n\nA Description of California in 1828\n\nBy José Bandini and translated by Doris Marion Wright, 1951\n\nThe original document consists of nineteen manuscript pages, written in the distinctive handwriting of José Bandini. It is undated, and unsigned except for the initials \"J.B.\" The manuscript probably came to the University of California with the Cowan Collection in 1897, where it remained almost unnoticed among the treasures of The Bancroft Library. With this Keepsake, Bancroft is glad to bring this remarkable document to the attention of scholars. Both the original version and an English translation are provided.\n\nKeepsake 2\n\nOverland to California on the Southwestern Trail, 1849: Diary of Robert Eccleston\n\nEdited by George P. Hammond and Edward H. Howes, 1950\n\nWord of the California gold discoveries had reached the East during the summer of 1848, and the news was confirmed in President James K. Polk’s annual message to Congress in December of that year. At once, thousands of men seized the first opportunity to head west for the reputed easy riches. Robert Eccleston distinguished himself among them by keeping a painstaking record of the trip from Texas to California. His journal is especially interesting as a record of the opening of two sections of the great Southwestern Trail—the Lower Road from San Antonio to El Paso and the cut-off from the Burro Mountains in New Mexico to Tucson—as well as for its description of the entire nine-month journey to the Pacific Coast.\n\nKeepsake 1\n\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, February 2, 1848\n\nEdited by George P. Hammond, 1949\n\nThis Keepsake, published in a convenient form with an explanatory accompaniment and map, is a boon to all California residents who have any degree of curiosity about the origins of their laws, their land titles, and many other aspects of their citizenship. This publication is the first to appear under the sponsorship of the Friends of The Bancroft Library."
