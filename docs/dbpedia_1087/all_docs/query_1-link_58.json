In an effort to determine the predictive character of current approaches, we predict the results of an upcoming ultrafast diffraction experiment on the photodynamics of cyclobutanone after excitation to the lowest lying Rydberg state (S2). A picosecond of nonadiabatic dynamics is described with ab initio multiple spawning. We use both time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) theory for the underlying electronic structure theory. We find that the lifetime of the S2 state is more than a picosecond (with both TDDFT and EOM-CCSD). The predicted ultrafast electron diffraction spectrum exhibits numerous structural features, but weak time dependence over the course of the simulations.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1063/5.0203800\n\nView details for PubMedID 38912674\n\nAbstract\n\nRed fluorescent protein (RFP) variants are highly sought after for in vivo imaging since longer wavelengths improve depth and contrast in fluorescence imaging. However, the lower energy emission wavelength usually correlates with a lower fluorescent quantum yield compared to their green emitting counterparts. To guide the rational design of bright variants, we have theoretically assessed two variants (mScarlet and mRouge) which are reported to have very different brightness. Using an α-CASSCF QM/MM framework (chromophore and all protein residues within 6 Å of it in the QM region, for a total of more than 450 QM atoms), we identify key points on the ground and first excited state potential energy surfaces. The brighter variant mScarlet has a rigid scaffold, and the chromophore stays largely planar on the ground state. The dimmer variant mRouge shows more flexibility and can accommodate a pretwisted chromophore conformation which provides easier access to conical intersections. The main difference between the variants lies in the intersection seam regions, which appear largely inaccessible in mScarlet but partially accessible in mRouge. This observation is mainly related with changes in the cavity charge distribution, the hydrogen-bonding network involving the chromophore and a key ARG/THR mutation (which changes both charge and steric hindrance).\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/jacs.4c00458\n\nView details for PubMedID 38885641\n\nAbstract\n\nElectronic structure theory, i.e., quantum chemistry, is the fundamental building block for many problems in computational chemistry. We present a new distributed computing framework (BigChem), which allows for an efficient solution of many quantum chemistry problems in parallel. BigChem is designed to be easily composable and leverages industry-standard middleware (e.g., Celery, RabbitMQ, and Redis) for distributed approaches to large scale problems. BigChem can harness any collection of worker nodes, including ones on cloud providers (such as AWS or Azure), local clusters, or supercomputer centers (and any mixture of these). BigChem builds upon MolSSI packages, such as QCEngine to standardize the operation of numerous computational chemistry programs, demonstrated here with Psi4, xtb, geomeTRIC, and TeraChem. BigChem delivers full utilization of compute resources at scale, offers a programable canvas for designing sophisticated quantum chemistry workflows, and is fault tolerant to node failures and network disruptions. We demonstrate linear scalability of BigChem running computational chemistry workloads on up to 125 GPUs. Finally, we present ChemCloud, a web API to BigChem and successor to TeraChem Cloud. ChemCloud delivers scalable and secure access to BigChem over the Internet.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1063/5.0190834\n\nView details for PubMedID 38591672\n\nAbstract\n\nControlling excited-state reactivity is a long-standing challenge in photochemistry, as a desired pathway may be inaccessible or compete with other unwanted channels. An important example is internal conversion of the anionic green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore where non-selective progress along two competing torsional modes (P: phenolate and I: imidazolinone) impairs and enables Z-to-E photoisomerization, respectively. Developing strategies to promote photoisomerization could drive new areas of applications of GFP-like proteins. Motivated by the charge-transfer dichotomy of the torsional modes, we explore chemical substitution on the P-ring of the chromophore as a way to control excited-state pathways and improve photoisomerization. As demonstrated by methoxylation, selective P-twisting appears difficult to achieve because the electron-donating potential effects of the substituents are counteracted by inertial effects that directly retard the motion. Conversely, these effects act in concert to promote I-twisting when introducing electron-withdrawing groups. Specifically, 2,3,5-trifluorination leads to both pathway selectivity and a more direct approach to the I-twisted intersection which, in turn, doubles the photoisomerization quantum yield. Our results suggest P-ring engineering as an effective approach to boost photoisomerization of the anionic GFP chromophore.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s42004-024-01099-1\n\nView details for PubMedID 38316834\n\nAbstract\n\nX-ray absorption spectra (XAS) of biradicaloid species are often thought to represent a challenge to theoretical methods. This has led to the testing of recently developed multireference techniques on the XAS of ozone, but reproduction of the experimental spectral profile has proven difficult. We utilize a minimal model consisting of a single configuration state function (CSF) per excited state to model core-level excitations of ozone, with the orbitals of each CSF optimized using the restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham (ROKS) method. This protocol leads to semiquantitative agreement with experimental XAS. In fact, we find that low-lying core-hole excited states in biradicaloids can be approximated with individual CSFs, despite the presence of multireference character in the ground state. We also report that the 1s → π* and 1s → σ* transitions have quite distinct widths for O3. This reveals the importance of sampling over a representative range of geometries from the vibrational ground state for properly assessing the accuracy of electronic structure methods against experiments instead of the popular procedure of uniformly broadening stick spectra at the equilibrium geometry.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.jctc.3c01035\n\nView details for PubMedID 38175153\n\nAbstract\n\nPterodactylane is a [4]-ladderane with substituents on the central rung. Comparing the mechanochemistry of the [4]-ladderane structure when pulled from the central rung versus the end rung revealed a striking difference in the threshold force of mechanoactivation: the threshold force is dramatically lowered from 1.9 nN when pulled on the end rung to 0.7 nN when pulled on the central rung. We investigated the bicyclic products formed from the mechanochemical activation of pterodactylane experimentally and computationally, which are distinct from the mechanochemical products of ladderanes being activated from the end rung. We compared the products of pterodactylane's mechanochemical and thermal activation to reveal differences and similarities in the mechanochemical and thermal pathways of pterodactylane transformation. Interestingly, we also discovered the presence of elementary steps that are accelerated or suppressed by force within the same mechanochemical reaction of pterodactylane, suggesting rich mechanochemical manifolds of multicyclic structures. We rationalized the greatly enhanced mechanochemical reactivity of the central rung of pterodactylane and discovered force-free ground state bond length to be a good low-cost predictor of the threshold force for cyclobutane-based mechanophores. These findings advance our understanding of mechanochemical reactivities and pathways, and they will guide future designs of mechanophores with low threshold forces to facilitate their applications in force-responsive materials.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/jacs.3c11293\n\nView details for PubMedID 38131266\n\nAbstract\n\nOver the past decade, there has been a growth of interest in polaritonic chemistry, where the formation of hybrid light-matter states (polaritons) can alter the course of photochemical reactions. These hybrid states are created by strong coupling between molecules and photons in resonant optical cavities and can even occur in the absence of light when the molecule is strongly coupled with the electromagnetic fluctuations of the vacuum field. We present a first-principles model to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics of such polaritonic states inside optical cavities by leveraging graphical processing units (GPUs). Our first implementation of this model is specialized for a single molecule coupled to a single-photon mode confined inside the optical cavity but with any number of excited states computed using complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) and a Jaynes-Cummings-type Hamiltonian. Using this model, we have simulated the excited-state dynamics of a single salicylideneaniline (SA) molecule strongly coupled to a cavity photon with the ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) method. We demonstrate how the branching ratios of the photodeactivation pathways for this molecule can be manipulated by coupling to the cavity. We also show how one can stop the photoreaction from happening inside of an optical cavity. Finally, we also investigate cavity-based control of the ordering of two excited states (one optically bright and the other optically dark) inside a cavity for a set of molecules, where the dark and bright states are close in energy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.jpca.3c06607\n\nView details for PubMedID 38110364\n\nAbstract\n\nOver the years, many computational strategies have been employed to elucidate reaction networks. One of these methods is accelerated molecular dynamics, which can circumvent the expense required in dynamics to find all reactants and products (local minima) and transition states (first-order saddle points) on a potential energy surface (PES) by using fictitious forces that promote reaction events. The ab initio nanoreactor uses these accelerating forces to study large chemical reaction networks from first-principles quantum mechanics. In the initial nanoreactor studies, this acceleration was done through a piston periodic compression potential, which pushes molecules together to induce entropically unfavorable bimolecular reactions. However, the piston is not effective for discovering intramolecular and dissociative reactions, such as those integral to the decomposition channels of phenyl radical oxidation. In fact, the choice of accelerating forces dictates not only the rate of reaction discovery but also the types of reactions discovered; thus, it is critical to understand the biases and efficacies of these forces. In this study, we examine forces using metadynamics, attractive potentials, and local thermostats for accelerating reaction discovery. For each force, we construct a separate phenyl radical combustion reaction network using solely that force in discovery trajectories. We elucidate the enthalpic and entropic trends of each accelerating force and highlight their efficiency in reaction discovery. Comparing the nanoreactor-constructed reaction networks with literature renditions of the phenyl radical combustion PES shows that a combination of accelerating forces is best suited for reaction discovery.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.jpca.3c05484\n\nView details for PubMedID 37934692\n\nAbstract\n\nIt has been well-established that the topography around conical intersections between excited electronic states is incorrectly described by coupled cluster and many other single reference theories (the intersections are \"defective\"). Despite this, we show both analytically and numerically that the geometric phase effect (GPE) is correctly reproduced upon traversing a path around a defective excited-state conical intersection (CI) in coupled cluster theory. The theoretical analysis is carried out by using a non-Hermitian generalization of the linear vibronic coupling approach. Interestingly, the approach qualitatively explains the characteristic (incorrect) shape of the defective CIs and CI seams. Moreover, the validity of the approach and the presence of the GPE indicate that defective CIs are local (and not global) artifacts. This implies that a sufficiently accurate coupled cluster method could predict nuclear dynamics, including geometric phase effects, as long as the nuclear wavepacket never gets too close to the conical intersections.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1063/5.0151856\n\nView details for PubMedID 37283267\n\nAbstract\n\nMachine learning (ML) offers an attractive method for making predictions about molecular systems while circumventing the need to run expensive electronic structure calculations. Once trained on ab initio data, the promise of ML is to deliver accurate predictions of molecular properties that were previously computationally infeasible. In this work, we develop and train a graph neural network model to correct the basis set incompleteness error (BSIE) between a small and large basis set at the RHF and B3LYP levels of theory. Our results show that, when compared to fitting to the total potential, an ML model fitted to correct the BSIE is better at generalizing to systems not seen during training. We test this ability by training on single molecules while evaluating on molecular complexes. We also show that ensemble models yield better behaved potentials in situations where the training data is insufficient. However, even when only fitting to the BSIE, acceptable performance is only achieved when the training data sufficiently resemble the systems one wants to make predictions on. The test error of the final model trained to predict the difference between the cc-pVDZ and cc-pV5Z potential is 0.184 kcal/mol for the B3LYP density functional, and the ensemble model accurately reproduces the large basis set interaction energy curves on the S66x8 dataset.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01298\n\nView details for PubMedID 37192428\n\nAbstract\n\nLight-driven molecular motors have generated considerable interest due to their potential applications in material and biological systems. Recently, Greb and Lehn reported a new class of molecular motors, chiral N-alkyl imines, which undergo unidirectional rotation induced by light and heat. The mechanism of unidirectional motion in molecular motors containing a C═N group has been assumed to consist of photoinduced torsion about the double bond. In this work, we present a computational study of the photoisomerization dynamics of a chiral N-alkyl imine motor. We find that the location and energetics of minimal energy conical intersections (MECIs) alone are insufficient to understand the mechanism of the motor. Furthermore, a key part of the mechanism consists of out-of-plane distortions of the N atom (followed by isomerization about the double bond). Dynamic effects and out-of-plane distortions are critical to understand the observed (rather low) quantum yield for photoisomerization. Our results provide hints as to how the photoisomerization quantum yield might be increased, improving the efficiency of this class of molecular motors.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/jacs.3c00275\n\nView details for PubMedID 36920260\n\nAbstract\n\nAb initio and semiempirical electronic structure methods are usually implemented in separate software packages or use entirely different code paths. As a result, it can be time-consuming to transfer an established ab initio electronic structure scheme to a semiempirical Hamiltonian. We present an approach to unify ab initio and semiempirical electronic structure code paths based on a separation of the wavefunction ansatz and the needed matrix representations of operators. With this separation, the Hamiltonian can refer to either an ab initio or semiempirical treatment of the resulting integrals. We built a semiempirical integral library and interfaced it to the GPU-accelerated electronic structure code TeraChem. Equivalency between ab initio and semiempirical tight-binding Hamiltonian terms is assigned according to their dependence on the one-electron density matrix. The new library provides semiempirical equivalents of the Hamiltonian matrix and gradient intermediates, corresponding to those provided by the ab initio integral library. This enables the straightforward combination of semiempirical Hamiltonians with the full pre-existing ground and excited state functionality of the ab initio electronic structure code. We demonstrate the capability of this approach by combining the extended tight-binding method GFN1-xTB with both spin-restricted ensemble-referenced Kohn-Sham and complete active space methods. We also present a highly efficient GPU implementation of the semiempirical Mulliken-approximated Fock exchange. The additional computational cost for this term becomes negligible even on consumer-grade GPUs, enabling Mulliken-approximated exchange in tight-binding methods for essentially no additional cost.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1063/5.0132776\n\nView details for PubMedID 36813714\n\nAbstract\n\nThe computation of two-electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) is often the most expensive step of integral-direct self-consistent field methods. Formally it scales as O(N4), where N is the number of Gaussian basis functions used to represent the molecular wave function. In practice, this scaling can be reduced to O(N2) or less by neglecting small integrals with screening methods. The contributions of the ERIs to the Fock matrix are of Coulomb (J) and exchange (K) type and require separate algorithms to compute matrix elements efficiently. We previously implemented highly efficient GPU-accelerated J-matrix and K-matrix algorithms in the electronic structure code TeraChem. Although these implementations supported the use of multiple GPUs on a node, they did not support the use of multiple nodes. This presents a key bottleneck to cutting-edge ab initio simulations of large systems, e.g., excited state dynamics of photoactive proteins. We present our implementation of multinode multi-GPU J- and K-matrix algorithms in TeraChem using the Regent programming language. Regent directly supports distributed computation in a task-based model and can generate code for a variety of architectures, including NVIDIA GPUs. We demonstrate multinode scaling up to 45 GPUs (3 nodes) and benchmark against hand-coded TeraChem integral code. We also outline our metaprogrammed Regent implementation, which enables flexible code generation for integrals of different angular momenta.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00414\n\nView details for PubMedID 36200649\n\nAbstract\n\nFluorescent proteins have become routine tools for biological imaging. However, their nanosecond lifetimes on the excited state present computational hurdles to a full understanding of these photoactive proteins. In this work, we simulate approximately 0.5 nanoseconds of ab initio molecular dynamics to elucidate steric and electronic features responsible for fluorescent protein behavior. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Dronpa2─widely used fluorescent proteins with contrasting functionality─as case studies, we leverage previous findings in the gas phase and solution to explore the deactivation mechanisms available to these proteins. Starting with ground-state analyses, we identify steric (the distribution of empty pockets near the chromophore) and electronic (electric fields exerted on chromophore moieties) factors that offer potential avenues for rational design. Picosecond timescale simulations on the excited state reveal that the chromophore can access twisted structures in Dronpa2, while the chromophore is largely confined to planarity in GFP. We couple ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) and enhanced sampling simulations to discover and characterize conical intersection seams that facilitate internal conversion, which is a rare event in both systems. Our AIMS simulations correctly capture the relative fluorescence profiles of GFP and Dronpa2 within the first few picoseconds, and we attribute the diminished fluorescence intensity of Dronpa2, relative to GFP, to flexible chromophore intermediates on the excited state. Furthermore, we predict that twisted chromophore intermediates produce red-shifted intensities in the Dronpa2 fluorescence spectrum. If confirmed experimentally, this spectroscopic signature would provide valuable insights when screening and developing novel fluorescent proteins.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/jacs.2c02946\n\nView details for PubMedID 35786916\n\nAbstract\n\nThe ability of molecular photoswitches to convert on/off responses into large macroscale property change is fundamental to light-responsive materials. However, moving beyond simple binary responses necessitates the introduction of new elements that control the chemistry of the photoswitching process at the molecular scale. To achieve this goal, we designed, synthesized and developed a single photochrome, based on a modified donor-acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA), capable of independently addressing multiple molecular states. The multi-stage photoswitch enables complex switching phenomena. To demonstrate this, we show spatial control of the transformation of a three-stage photoswitch by tuning the population of intermediates along the multi-step reaction pathway of the DASAs without interfering with either the first or final stage. This allows for a photonic three-stage logic gate where the secondary wavelength solely negates the input of the primary wavelength. These results provide a new strategy to move beyond traditional on/off binary photochromic systems and enable the design of future molecular logic systems.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41557-022-00947-8\n\nView details for PubMedID 35681046\n\nAbstract\n\nWe develop a quartic-scaling implementation of coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) based on low-rank tensor hypercontraction (THC) factorizations of both the electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) and the doubles amplitudes. This extends our rank-reduced (RR) coupled-cluster method to incorporate higher-order tensor factorizations. The THC factorization of the doubles amplitudes accounts for most of the gain in computational efficiency as it is sufficient, in conjunction with a Cholesky decomposition of the ERIs, to reduce the computational complexity of most contributions to the CCSD amplitude equations. Further THC factorization of the ERIs reduces the complexity of certain terms arising from nested commutators between the doubles excitation operator and the two-electron operator. We implement this new algorithm using graphical processing units and demonstrate that it enables CCSD calculations for molecules with 250 atoms and 2500 basis functions using a single computer node. Furthermore, we show that the new method computes correlation energies with comparable accuracy to the underlying RR-CCSD method.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1063/5.0077770\n\nView details for PubMedID 35135289\n\nAbstract\n\nThe functional diversity of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) family is intimately connected to the interplay between competing photo-induced transformations of the chromophore motif, anionic p-hydroxybenzylidene-2,3-dimethylimidazolinone (HBDI-). Its ability to undergo Z/E-isomerization is of particular importance for super-resolution microscopy and emerging opportunities in optogenetics. Yet, key dynamical features of the underlying internal conversion process in the native HBDI- chromophore remain largely elusive. We investigate the intrinsic excited-state behavior of isolated HBDI- to resolve competing decay pathways and map out the factors governing efficiency and the stereochemical outcome of photoisomerization. Based on non-adiabatic dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that non-selective progress along the two bridge-torsional (i.e., phenolate, P, or imidazolinone, I) pathways accounts for the three decay constants reported experimentally, leading to competing ultrafast relaxation primarily along the I-twisted pathway and S1 trapping along the P-torsion. The majority of the population (∼70%) is transferred to S0 in the vicinity of two approximately enantiomeric minima on the I-twisted intersection seam (MECI-Is). Despite their sloped, reactant-biased topographies (suggesting low photoproduct yields), we find that decay through these intersections leads to products with a surprisingly high quantum yield of ∼30%. This demonstrates that E-isomer generation results at least in part from direct isomerization on the excited state. A photoisomerization committor analysis reveals a difference in intrinsic photoreactivity of the two MECI-Is and that the observed photoisomerization is the combined result of two effects: early, non-statistical dynamics around the less reactive intersection followed by later, near-statistical behavior around the more reactive MECI-I. Our work offers new insight into internal conversion of HBDI- that both establishes the intrinsic properties of the chromophore and enlightens principles for the design of chromophore derivatives and protein variants with improved photoswitching properties.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1039/d1sc05849e\n\nView details for PubMedID 35126970\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC8729814\n\nAbstract\n\nCommunity efforts in the computational molecular sciences (CMS) are evolving toward modular, open, and interoperable interfaces that work with existing community codes to provide more functionality and composability than could be achieved with a single program.

We investigate photoinduced proton transfer between the photoacid 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (HPTS) and water using fast fluorescence spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Photoexcitation causes rapid proton release from the HPTS hydroxyl. Previous experiments on HPTS/water described the progress from photoexcitation to proton diffusion using kinetic equations with two time constants. The shortest time constant has been interpreted as protonated and photoexcited HPTS evolving into an \"associated\" state, where the proton is \"shared\" between the HPTS hydroxyl and an originally hydrogen bonded water. The longer time constant has been interpreted as indicating evolution to a \"solvent separated\" state where the shared proton undergoes long distance diffusion. In this work, we refine the previous experimental results using very pure HPTS. We then use excited state ab initio molecular dynamics to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanism of aqueous excited state proton transfer in HPTS. We find that the initial excitation results in rapid rearrangement of water, forming a strong hydrogen bonded network (a \"water wire\") around HPTS. HPTS then deprotonates in ≤3 ps, resulting in a proton that migrates back and forth along the wire before localizing on a single water molecule. We find a near linear relationship between the emission wavelength and proton-HPTS distance over the simulated time scale, suggesting that the emission wavelength can be used as a ruler for the proton distance. Our simulations reveal that the \"associated\" state corresponds to a water wire with a mobile proton and that the diffusion of the proton away from this water wire (to a generalized \"solvent-separated\" state) corresponds to the longest experimental time constant.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c07254\n\nView details for PubMedID 34743512\n\nAbstract\n\nTime-resolved near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (TR-NEXAFS) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for studying photochemical reaction dynamics with femtosecond time resolution. In order to avoid ambiguity in TR-NEXAFS spectra from nonadiabatic dynamics simulations, core- and valence-excited states must be evaluated on equal footing and those valence states must also define the potential energy surfaces used in the nonadiabatic dynamics simulation. In this work, we demonstrate that hole-hole Tamm-Dancoff-approximated density functional theory (hh-TDA) is capable of directly simulating TR-NEXAFS spectroscopies. We apply hh-TDA to the excited-state dynamics of acrolein. We identify two pre-edge features in the oxygen K-edge TR-NEXAFS spectrum associated with the S2 (pipi*) and S1 (npi*) excited states. We show that these features can be used to follow the internal conversion dynamics between the lowest three electronic states of acrolein. Due to the low, O(N2) apparent computational complexity of hh-TDA and our GPU-accelerated implementation, this method is promising for the simulation of pre-edge features in TR-NEXAFS spectra of large molecules and molecules in the condensed phase.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00478\n\nView details for PubMedID 34623139\n\nAbstract\n\nThe chromophore of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) is critical for probing environmental influences on fluorescent protein behavior. Using the aqueous system as a bridge between the unconfined vacuum system and a constricting protein scaffold, we investigate the steric and electronic effects of the environment on the photodynamical behavior of the chromophore. Specifically, we apply ab initio multiple spawning to simulate five picoseconds of nonadiabatic dynamics after photoexcitation, resolving the excited-state pathways responsible for internal conversion in the aqueous chromophore. We identify an ultrafast pathway that proceeds through a short-lived (sub-picosecond) imidazolinone-twisted (I-twisted) species and a slower (several picoseconds) channel that proceeds through a long-lived phenolate-twisted (P-twisted) intermediate. The molecule navigates the non-equilibrium energy landscape via an aborted hula-twist-like motion toward the one-bond-flip dominated conical intersection seams, as opposed to following the pure one-bond-flip paths proposed by the excited-state equilibrium picture. We interpret our simulations in the context of time-resolved fluorescence experiments, which use short- and long-time components to describe the fluorescence decay of the aqueous GFP chromophore. Our results suggest that the longer time component is caused by an energetically uphill approach to the P-twisted intersection seam rather than an excited-state barrier to reach the twisted intramolecular charge-transfer species. Irrespective of the location of the nonadiabatic population events, the twisted intersection seams are inefficient at facilitating isomerization in aqueous solution. The disordered and homogeneous nature of the aqueous solvent environment facilitates non-selective stabilization with respect to I- and P-twisted species, offering an important foundation for understanding the consequences of selective stabilization in heterogeneous and rigid protein environments.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1039/d1sc02508b\n\nView details for PubMedID 34667545\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC8447926\n\nAbstract\n\nInputting molecules into chemistry software, such as quantum chemistry packages, currently requires domain expertise, expensive software and/or cumbersome procedures. Leveraging recent breakthroughs in machine learning, we develop ChemPix: an offline, hand-drawn hydrocarbon structure recognition tool designed to remove these barriers. A neural image captioning approach consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder and a long short-term memory (LSTM) decoder learned a mapping from photographs of hand-drawn hydrocarbon structures to machine-readable SMILES representations. We generated a large auxiliary training dataset, based on RDKit molecular images, by combining image augmentation, image degradation and background addition. Additionally, a small dataset of ∼600 hand-drawn hydrocarbon chemical structures was crowd-sourced using a phone web application. These datasets were used to train the image-to-SMILES neural network with the goal of maximizing the hand-drawn hydrocarbon recognition accuracy. By forming a committee of the trained neural networks where each network casts one vote for the predicted molecule, we achieved a nearly 10 percentage point improvement of the molecule recognition accuracy and were able to assign a confidence value for the prediction based on the number of agreeing votes. The ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 76% on hand-drawn hydrocarbons, increasing to 86% if the top 3 predictions were considered.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1039/d1sc02957f\n\nView details for PubMedID 34447555\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC8365825\n\nAbstract\n\nWater is one of the most important, yet least understood, liquids in nature. Many anomalous properties of liquid water originate from its well-connected hydrogen bond network1, including unusually efficient vibrational energy redistribution and relaxation2. An accurate description of the ultrafast vibrational motion of water molecules is essential for understanding the nature of hydrogen bonds and many solution-phase chemical reactions. Most existing knowledge of vibrational relaxation in water is built upon ultrafast spectroscopy experiments2-7. However, these experiments cannot directly resolve the motion of the atomic positions and require difficult translation of spectral dynamics into hydrogen bond dynamics. Here, we measure the ultrafast structural response to the excitation of the OH stretching vibration in liquid water with femtosecond temporal and atomic spatial resolution using liquid ultrafast electron scattering. We observed a transient hydrogen bond contraction of roughly 0.04A on a timescale of 80 femtoseconds, followed by a thermalization on a timescale of approximately 1 picosecond. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the need to treat the distribution of the shared proton in the hydrogen bond quantum mechanically to capture the structural dynamics on femtosecond timescales. Our experiment and simulations unveil the intermolecular character of the water vibration preceding the relaxation of the OH stretch.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-021-03793-9\n\nView details for PubMedID 34433948\n\nAbstract\n\nWe have recently reported a series of ladder-type cyclobutane mechanophores, polymers of which can transform from nonconjugated structures to conjugated structures and change many properties at once. These multicyclic mechanophores, namely, exo-ladderane/ene, endo-benzoladderene, and exo-bicyclohexene-peri-naphthalene, have different ring structures fused to the first cyclobutane, significantly different free energy changes for ring-opening, and different stereochemistry. To better understand their mechanochemistry, we used single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) to characterize their force-extension behavior and measure the threshold forces. The threshold forces correlate with the activation energy of the first bond, but not with the strain of the fused rings distal to the polymer main chain, suggesting that the activation of these ladder-type mechanophores occurs with similar early transition states, which is supported by force-modified potential energy surface calculations. We further determined the stereochemistry of the mechanically generated dienes and observed significant and variable contour length elongation for these mechanophores both experimentally and computationally. The fundamental understanding of ladder-type mechanophores will facilitate future design of multicyclic mechanophores with amplified force-response and their applications as mechanically responsive materials.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/jacs.1c05857\n\nView details for PubMedID 34310875\n\nAbstract\n\nWe introduce a diagrammatic approach to facilitate the automatic derivation of analytical nuclear gradients for tensor hyper-contraction (THC) based electronic structure methods. The automatically derived gradients are guaranteed to have the same scaling in terms of both operation count and memory footprint as the underlying energy calculations, and the computation of a gradient is roughly three times as costly as the underlying energy. The new diagrammatic approach enables the first cubic scaling implementation of nuclear derivatives for THC tensors fitted in molecular orbital basis (MO-THC). Furthermore, application of this new approach to THC-MP2 analytical gradients leads to an implementation, which is at least four times faster than the previously reported, manually derived implementation. Finally, we apply the new approach to the 14 tensor contraction patterns appearing in the supporting subspace formulation of multireference perturbation theory, laying the foundation for developments of analytical nuclear gradients and nonadiabatic coupling vectors for multi-state CASPT2.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1063/5.0055914\n\nView details for PubMedID 34266268\n\nAbstract\n\nThe ab initio nanoreactor has previously been introduced to automate reaction discovery for ground state chemistry. In this work, we present the nonadiabatic nanoreactor, an analogous framework for excited state reaction discovery. We automate the study of nonadiabatic decay mechanisms of molecules by probing the intersection seam between adiabatic electronic states with hyper-real metadynamics, sampling the branching plane for relevant conical intersections, and performing seam-constrained path searches. We illustrate the effectiveness of the nonadiabatic nanoreactor by applying it to benzene, a molecule with rich photochemistry and a wide array of photochemical products. Our study confirms the existence of several types of S0/S1 and S1/S2 conical intersections which mediate access to a variety of ground state stationary points. We elucidate the connections between conical intersection energy/topography and the resulting photoproduct distribution, which changes smoothly along seam space segments. The exploration is performed with minimal user input, and the protocol requires no previous knowledge of the photochemical behavior of a target molecule. We demonstrate that the nonadiabatic nanoreactor is a valuable tool for the automated exploration of photochemical reactions and their mechanisms.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1039/d1sc00775k\n\nView details for PubMedID 34163820\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC8171323\n\nAbstract\n\nChannelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) is the most commonly used tool in optogenetics. Because of its faster photocycle compared to wild-type (WT) ChR2, the E123T mutant of ChR2 is a useful optogenetic tool when fast neuronal stimulation is needed. Interestingly, in spite of its faster photocycle, the initial step of the photocycle in E123T (photoisomerization of retinal protonated Schiff base or RPSB) was found experimentally to be much slower than that of WT ChR2. The E123T mutant replaces the negatively charged E123 residue with a neutral T123 residue, perturbing the electric field around the RPSB. Understanding the RPSB photoisomerization mechanism in ChR2 mutants will provide molecular-level insights into how ChR2 photochemical reactivity can be controlled, which will lay the foundation for improving the design of optogenetic tools. In this work, we combine ab initio nonadiabatic dynamics simulation, excited state free energy calculation, and reaction path search to comprehensively characterize the RPSB photoisomerization mechanism in the E123T mutant of ChR2. Our simulation agrees with previous experiments in predicting a red-shifted absorption spectrum and significant slowdown of photoisomerization in the E123T mutant. Interestingly, our simulations predict similar photoisomerization quantum yields for the mutant and WT despite the differences in excited-state lifetime and absorption maximum. Upon mutation, the neutralization of the negative charge on the E123 residue increases the isomerization barrier, alters the reaction pathway, and changes the relative stability of two fluorescent states. Our findings provide new insight into the intricate role of the electrostatic environment on the RPSB photoisomerization mechanism in microbial rhodopsins.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/jacs.1c00058\n\nView details for PubMedID 33794085\n\nAbstract\n\nWoodward and Hoffman once jested that a very powerful Maxwell demon could seize a molecule of cyclobutene at its methylene groups and tear it open in a disrotatory fashion to obtain butadiene (Woodward, R. B.; Hoffmann, R. The Conservation of Orbital Symmetry. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 1969, 8, 781-853). Nearly 40 years later, that demon was discovered, and the field of covalent polymer mechanochemistry was born. In the decade since our demon was befriended, many fundamental investigations have been undertaken to build up our understanding of force-modified pathways for electrocyclic ring-opening reactions. Here, we seek to extend that fundamental understanding by exploring substituent effects in allowed and forbidden ring-opening reactions of cyclobutene (CBE) and benzocyclobutene (BCB) using a combination of single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) and computation. We show that, while the forbidden ring-opening of cis-BCB occurs at a lower force than the allowed ring-opening of trans-BCB on the time scale of the SMFS experiment, the opposite is true for cis- and trans-CBE. Such a reactivity flip is explained through computational analysis and discussion of the so-called allowed/forbidden gap.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/jacs.0c12088\n\nView details for PubMedID 33667078\n\nAbstract\n\nWe present the first investigation of excited state dynamics by resonant Auger-Meitner spectroscopy (also known as resonant Auger spectroscopy) using the nucleobase thymine as an example. Thymine is photoexcited in the UV and probed with X-ray photon energies at and below the oxygen K-edge. After initial photoexcitation to a pipi* excited state, thymine is known to undergo internal conversion to an npi* excited state with a strong resonance at the oxygen K-edge, red-shifted from the ground state pi* resonances of thymine (see our previous study Wolf, et al., Nat. Commun., 2017, 8, 29). We resolve and compare the Auger-Meitner electron spectra associated both with the excited state and ground state resonances, and distinguish participator and spectator decay contributions. Furthermore, we observe simultaneously with the decay of the npi* state signatures the appearance of additional resonant Auger-Meitner contributions at photon energies between the npi* state and the ground state resonances. We assign these contributions to population transfer from the npi* state to a pipi* triplet state via intersystem crossing on the picosecond timescale based on simulations of the X-ray absorption spectra in the vibrationally hot triplet state. Moreover, we identify signatures from the initially excited pipi* singlet state which we have not observed in our previous study.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1039/d0fd00112k\n\nView details for PubMedID 33566045\n\nAbstract\n\nWe have developed a graphical processing unit (GPU) accelerated implementation of our recently introduced rank-reduced coupled-cluster singles and doubles (RR-CCSD) method. RR-CCSD introduces a low-rank approximation of the doubles amplitudes. This is combined with a low-rank approximation of the electron repulsion integrals via Cholesky decomposition. The result of these two low-rank approximations is the replacement of the usual fourth-order CCSD tensors with products of second- and third-order tensors. In our implementation, only a single fourth-order tensor must be constructed as an intermediate during the solution of the amplitude equations. Owing in large part to the compression of the doubles amplitudes, the GPU-accelerated implementation shows excellent parallel efficiency (95% on eight GPUs). Our implementation can solve the RR-CCSD equations for up to 400 electrons and 1550 basis functions-roughly 50% larger than the largest canonical CCSD computations that have been performed on any hardware. In addition to increased scalability, the RR-CCSD computations are faster than the corresponding CCSD computations for all but the smallest molecules. We test the accuracy of RR-CCSD for a variety of chemical systems including up to 1000 basis functions and determine that accuracy to better than 0.1% error in the correlation energy can be achieved with roughly 95% compression of the ov space for the largest systems considered. We also demonstrate that conformational energies can be predicted to be within 0.1 kcal mol-1 with efficient compression applied to the wavefunction. Finally, we find that low-rank approximations of the CCSD doubles amplitudes used in the similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian prior to a conventional equation-of-motion CCSD computation will not introduce significant errors (on the order of a few hundredths of an electronvolt) into the resulting excitation energies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1063/5.0063467\n\nView details for PubMedID 34773962\n\nAbstract\n\nWe present a reduced scaling and exact reformulation of state specific complete active space second-order perturbation (CASPT2) analytical gradients in terms of the MP2 and Fock derivatives using the supporting subspace method. This work follows naturally from the supporting subspace formulation of the CASPT2 energy in terms of the MP2 energy using dressed orbitals and Fock builds. For a given active space configuration, the terms corresponding to the MP2-gradient can be evaluated with O(N5) operations, while the rest of the calculations can be computed with O(N3) operations using Fock builds, Fock gradients, and linear algebra. When tensor-hyper-contraction is applied simultaneously, the computational cost can be further reduced to O(N4) for a fixed active space size. The new formulation enables efficient implementation of CASPT2 analytical gradients by leveraging the existing graphical processing unit (GPU)-based MP2 and Fock routines. We present benchmark results that demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the new method.

New TBFs are spawned when nuclear wavepackets enter regions of strong nonadiabaticity, permitting the description of non-Born-Oppenheimer processes. The spawning algorithm is simultaneously the blessing and the curse of the AIMS method: it allows for an accurate description of the transfer of nuclear amplitude between different electronic states, but it also dramatically increases the computational cost of the AIMS dynamics as all TBFs are coupled. Recently, a strategy coined stochastic-selection AIMS (SSAIMS) was devised to limit the ever-growing number of TBFs and tested on simple molecules. In this work, we use the photodynamics of three different molecules-cyclopropanone, fulvene, and 1,2-dithiane-to investigate (i) the potential of SSAIMS to reproduce reference AIMS results for challenging nonadiabatic dynamics, (ii) the compromise achieved by SSAIMS in obtaining accurate results while using the smallest average number of TBFs as possible, and (iii) the performance of SSAIMS in comparison to the mixed quantum/classical method trajectory surface hopping (TSH)-both in terms of its accuracy and computational cost. We show that SSAIMS can accurately reproduce the AIMS results for the three molecules considered at a much cheaper computational cost, often close to that of TSH. We deduce from these tests that an overlap-based criterion for the stochastic-selection process leads to the best agreement with the reference AIMS dynamics for the smallest average number of TBFs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1063/5.0045572\n\nView details for PubMedID 33722031\n\nAbstract\n\nDirect irradiation of crystalline cis,cis-1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene (cc-DPB) forms trans,trans-1,4-diphenyl-1,3,-butadiene via a concerted two-bond isomerization called the bicycle pedal (BP) mechanism. However, little is known about photoisomerization pathways in the solid state and there has been much debate surrounding the interpretation of volume-conserving isomerization mechanisms. The bicycle pedal photoisomerization is investigated using the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics complete active space self-consistent field/Amber force-field method. Important details about how the steric environment influences isomerization mechanisms are revealed including how the one-bond flip and hula-twist mechanisms are suppressed by the crystal cavity, the nature of the seam space in steric environments, and the features of the bicycle pedal mechanism. Specifically, in the bicycle pedal, the phenyl rings of cc-DPB are locked in place and the intermolecular packing allows a passageway for rotation of the central diene in a volume-conserving manner. In contrast, the bicycle pedal rotation in the gas phase is not a stable pathway, so single-bond rotation mechanisms become operative instead. Furthermore, the crystal BP mechanism is an activated process that occurs completely on the excited state; the photoproduct can decay to the ground state through radiative and non-radiative pathways. The present models, however, do not capture the quantitative activation barriers, and more work is needed to better model reactions in crystals. Last, the reaction barriers of the different crystalline conformations within the unit cell of cc-DPB are compared to investigate the possibility for conformation-dependent isomerization. Although some difference in reaction barriers is observed, the difference is most likely not responsible for the experimentally observed periods of fast and slow conversion.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.jpca.0c05803\n\nView details for PubMedID 33064471\n\nAbstract\n\nThe dynamics of proton transfer to the aprotic solvent 1-methylimidazole (MeIm, proton acceptor) from the photoacid 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) was investigated using fast fluorescence measurements. The closely related molecule, 8-methoxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (MPTS), which is not a photoacid, was also studied for comparison. Following optical excitation, the wavelength-dependent population dynamics of HPTS in MeIm resulting from the deprotonation process were collected over the entire fluorescence emission window. Analysis of the time-dependent fluorescence spectra revealed four distinct fluorescence bands that appear and decay on different time scales. We label these four states as protonated (P), associated I (AI), associated II (AII), and deprotonated (D). We find that the simple kinetic scheme of P AI AII D is not consistent with the data. Instead, the kinetic scheme that describes the data has P decaying into AI, which mainly goes on to deprotonation (D), but AI can also feed into AII. AII can return to AI or decay to the ground state, but does not deprotonate within experimental error. Quantum chemistry and excited state QM/MM Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations indicate that AI and AII are two H-bonding conformations of MeIm to the HPTS hydroxyl, axial, and equatorial, respectively.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c05525\n\nView details for PubMedID 32790382\n\nAbstract\n\nAb initio multiple spawning provides a powerful and accurate way of describing the excited-state dynamics of molecular systems, whose strength resides in the proper description of coherence effects during nonadiabatic processes thanks to the coupling of trajectory basis functions. However, the simultaneous propagation of a large number of trajectory basis functions can be numerically inconvenient. We propose here an elegant and simple solution to this issue, which consists of (i) detecting uncoupled groups of coupled trajectory basis functions and (ii) selecting stochastically one of these groups to continue the ab initio multiple spawning dynamics. We show that this procedure can reproduce the results of full ab initio multiple spawning dynamics in cases where the uncoupled groups of trajectory basis functions stay uncoupled throughout the dynamics (which is often the case in high-dimensional problems).

In this study, the impact of a strong, nonresonant IR field (1064 nm) on the photoisomerization of cis-stilbene is investigated in cyclohexane solution. The design of a suitable reaction vessel for characterization of this effect is presented. The electric field supplied by the pulsed, near-IR radiation (epsilonl = 4.5 * 107 V/cm) enhances the cis trans photoisomerization yield at the red edge of the absorption spectrum (wavelengths between 337 and 340 nm). Within the microliter focal volume, up to 75% of all cis-stilbene molecules undergo isomerization to trans-stilbene in the strong electric-field environment, indicating a significant increase relative to the 35% yield of trans-stilbene under field-free conditions. This result correlates with a 1-3% enhancement in the trans-stilbene concentration throughout the bulk solution. Theoretical analysis suggests that the observed change is the result of dynamic Stark shifting of the ground and first excited states, leading to a significant redshift in cis-stilbene's absorption spectrum. The predicted increase in the absorption cross section in this range of excitation wavelengths is qualitatively consistent with the experimental increase in trans-stilbene production.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.jpca.0c02732\n\nView details for PubMedID 32585098\n\nAbstract\n\nWe present a reduced scaling formulation of the extended multi-state CASPT2 (XMS-CASPT2) method, which is based on our recently developed state-specific CASPT2 (SS-CASPT2) formulation using supporting subspaces and tensor hyper-contraction. By using these two techniques, the off-diagonal elements of the effective Hamiltonian can be computed with only O(N3) operations and O(N2) memory, where N is the number of basis functions. This limits the overall computational scaling to O(N4) operations and O(N2) memory. Thus, excited states can now be obtained at the same reduced (relative to previous algorithms) scaling we achieved for SS-CASPT2. In addition, we also investigate how the energy denominators can be factorized with the Laplace quadrature when some of the denominators are negative, which is critical for excited state calculations. An efficient implementation of the method has been developed using graphical processing units while also exploiting spatial sparsity in tensor operations. We benchmark the accuracy of the new method by comparison to non-THC formulated XMS-CASPT2 for the excited states of various molecules. In our tests, the THC approximation introduces negligible errors (0.01 eV) compared to the non-THC reference method. Scaling behavior and computational timings are presented to demonstrate performance. The new method is also interfaced with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM).

Malonaldehyde is the simplest example of ESIHT, yet only little is known experimentally about its excited-state dynamics. Several competing relaxation pathways have been proposed, including internal conversion mediated by ESIHT and C[double bond, length as m-dash]C torsional motion as well as intersystem crossing. We perform an in silico transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy (TRXAS) experiment at the oxygen K-edge to investigate its potential to monitor the proposed ultrafast decay pathways in malonaldehyde upon photoexcitation to its bright S2(ππ*) state. We employ both restricted active space perturbation theory and algebraic-diagrammatic construction for the polarization propagator along interpolated reaction coordinates as well as representative trajectories from ab initio multiple spawning simulations to compute the TRXAS signals from the lowest valence states. Our study suggests that oxygen K-edge TRXAS can distinctly fingerprint the passage through the H-transfer intersection and the concomitant population transfer to the S1(nπ*) state. Potential intersystem crossing to T1(ππ*) is detectable from reappearance of the double pre-edge signature and reversed intensities. Moreover, the torsional deactivation pathway induces transient charge redistribution from the enol side towards the central C-atom and manifests itself as substantial shifts of the pre-edge features. Given the continuous advances in X-ray light sources, our study proposes an experimental route to disentangle ultrafast excited-state decay channels in this prototypical ESIHT system and provides a pathway-specific mapping of the TRXAS signal to facilitate the interpretation of future experiments.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1039/d0sc00840k\n\nView details for PubMedID 34122881\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC8152795\n\nAbstract\n\nThe study of photoinduced dynamics in chemical systems necessitates accurate and computationally efficient electronic structure methods, especially as the systems of interest grow larger. The linear response hole-hole Tamm-Dancoff approximated (hh-TDA) density functional theory method was recently proposed to satisfy such demands. The N-electron electronic states are obtained by means of double annihilations on a doubly anionic (N + 2)-electron reference state, allowing for the ground and excited states to be formed on the same footing and thus enabling the correct description of conical intersections. Dynamic electron correlation effects are incorporated by means of the exchange-correlation functional. The accuracy afforded by the simultaneous treatment of static and dynamic correlation in addition to the relatively low computational cost, comparable to that of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), makes it a promising ab initio electronic structure method for on-the-fly generation of potential energy surfaces in nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of photochemical systems, particularly those for which the nπ* and ππ* electronic excitations are most relevant. Here, we apply the hh-TDA method to nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of prototypical photochemical processes. First, we demonstrate the ability of hh-TDA to adequately describe conical intersection geometries. We next examine its ability to describe the ultrafast excited state dynamics of photoexcited ethylene through an ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) dynamics simulation. Finally, we present an alternative variant of the hh-TDA method, which uses orbitals from a fractional occupation number Kohn-Sham (FON-KS) calculation applied to an ensemble with N-electrons. The resulting method is termed floating occupation molecular orbital hh-TDA (FOMO-hh-TDA). This scheme allows us to combine hh-TDA with global hybrid functionals and allows us to avoid unbound valence orbitals that may result from an (N + 2)-electron self-consistent field (SCF) procedure. FOMO-hh-TDA-BHLYP faithfully reproduces the nonadiabatic dynamics of trans-azobenzene (TAB) and is used to characterize the excited state decay pathways from the first (nπ*) excited state.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00644\n\nView details for PubMedID 32786902\n\nAbstract\n\nThe photochemistry of cis-stilbene proceeds through two pathways: cis-trans isomerization and ring closure to 4a,4b-dihydrophenanthrene (DHP). Despite serving for many decades as a model system for photoisomerization, the photodynamics of cis-stilbene is still not fully understood. We use ab initio multiple spawning on a SA-2-CASSCF(2,2) potential energy surface to simulate the nonadiabatic dynamics of isolated cis-stilbene. We find the cyclization (to DHP and cis-stilbene) and isomerization (to trans- and cis-stilbene) reaction coordinates to be orthogonal; branching between the two pathways is determined on the S1 excited state within 150 fs of photoexcitation. Trajectory basis functions (TBFs) undergoing cyclization decay rapidly to the ground state in 250 fs, while TBFs moving along the isomerization coordinate remain on the excited state longer, with the majority decaying between 300 and 500 fs. We observe three avoided crossing regions in the dynamics: two along the isomerization coordinate (displaying pyramidalization and migration of an ethylenic hydrogen or phenyl group), and one DHP-like conical intersection along the cyclization coordinate. The isomeric form of the vibrationally hot photoproducts (as determined by measurement 2 ps after photoexcitation) is determined within less than 50 fs of decay to the ground state mediated by passage through a conical intersection. Excess vibrational energy of ground state cis- and trans-stilbene is channelled into phenyl torsions (with mostly opposing directionality). Our simulations are validated by direct comparison to experiment for the absorption spectrum, branching ratio of the three photoproducts (44:52:4 cis-stilbene:trans-stilbene:DHP), and excited state lifetime (520 ± 40 fs).\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c03344\n\nView details for PubMedID 32428407\n\nAbstract\n\nThe study of photochemical reaction dynamics requires accurate as well as computationally efficient electronic structure methods for the ground and excited states. While time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is not able to capture static correlation, complete active space self-consistent field methods neglect much of the dynamic correlation. Hence, inexpensive methods that encompass both static and dynamic electron correlation effects are of high interest. Here, we revisit hole-hole Tamm-Dancoff approximated (hh-TDA) density functional theory for this purpose. The hh-TDA method is the hole-hole counterpart to the more established particle-particle TDA (pp-TDA) method, both of which are derived from the particle-particle random phase approximation (pp-RPA). In hh-TDA, the N-electron electronic states are obtained through double annihilations starting from a doubly anionic (N+2 electron) reference state. In this way, hh-TDA treats ground and excited states on equal footing, thus allowing for conical intersections to be correctly described. The treatment of dynamic correlation is introduced through the use of commonly employed density functional approximations to the exchange-correlation potential. We show that hh-TDA is a promising candidate to efficiently treat the photochemistry of organic and biochemical systems that involve several low-lying excited states-particularly those with both low-lying ππ* and nπ* states where inclusion of dynamic correlation is essential to describe the relative energetics. In contrast to the existing literature on pp-TDA and pp-RPA, we employ a functional-dependent choice for the response kernel in pp- and hh-TDA, which closely resembles the response kernels occurring in linear response and collinear spin-flip TDDFT.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1063/5.0003985\n\nView details for PubMedID 32668944\n\nAbstract\n\nThe encapsulation and commoditization of electronic structure arise naturally as interoperability, and the use of nontraditional compute resources (e.g., new hardware accelerators, cloud computing) remains important for the computational chemistry community.

Bacteriorhodopsin (bR), a light-activated proton pump in Archae, has served for many years as a model system for the study of this process in photoactive proteins. Upon absorption of a photon, its chromophore, the retinal protonated Schiff base (RPSB), isomerizes from its native all-trans form to a 13-cis form and pumps a proton out of the cell in a process that is coupled to eventual ATP synthesis. Despite numerous time-resolved spectroscopic studies over the years, the details of the photodynamics of bR on the excited state, particularly the characterization of the I fluorescent state, the time-resolved reaction mechanism, and the role of the counterion cluster of RPSB, remain uncertain. Here, we use ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) with spin-restricted ensemble Kohn-Sham (REKS) theory to simulate the nonadiabatic dynamics of the ultrafast photoreaction in bR. The excited state dynamics can be partitioned into three distinct phases: (1) relaxation away from the Franck-Condon region dominated by changes in retinal bond length alternation, (2) dwell time on the excited state in the I fluorescent state featuring an untwisted, bond length inverted RPSB, and (3) rapid torsional evolution to the conical intersection after overcoming a small excited state barrier. We fully characterize the I fluorescent state and the excited state barrier that hinders direct evolution to the conical intersection following photoexcitation. We also find that photoisomerization is accompanied by weakening of the interaction between RPSB and its counterion cluster. However, in contradiction with a recent time-resolved X-ray experiment, hydrogen bond cleavage is not necessary to reproduce the observed photoisomerization dynamics.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/jacs.9b08941\n\nView details for PubMedID 31621314\n\nAbstract\n\nEquation-of-motion coupled-cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) is a reliable and popular approach to the determination of electronic excitation energies. Recently, we have developed a rank-reduced CCSD (RR-CCSD) method that allows the ground-state coupled-cluster energy to be determined with low-rank cluster amplitudes. Here, we extend this approach to excited-state energies through a RR-EOM-CCSD method. We start from the EOM-CCSD energy functional and insert low-rank approximations to the doubles amplitudes. The result is an approximate EOM-CCSD method with only a quadratic number (in the molecular size) of free parameters in the wavefunction. Importantly, our formulation of RR-EOM-CCSD preserves the size intensivity of the excitation energy and size extensivity of the total energy. Numerical tests of the method suggest that accuracy on the order of 0.05-0.01 eV in the excitation energy is possible with 1% or less of the original number of wavefunction coefficients; accuracy of better than 0.01 eV can be achieved with about 4% or less of the free parameters. The amount of compression at a given accuracy level is expected to increase with the size of the molecule. The RR-EOM-CCSD method is a new path toward the efficient determination of accurate electronic excitation energies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1063/1.5121867\n\nView details for PubMedID 31675873\n\nAbstract\n\nWe studied the reaction dynamics of a proposed prebiotic reaction theoretically. The chemical process involves acetone cyanohydrin or formalcyanohydrin reacting with hydrosulfide in an aqueous environment. Rate constants and populations of reactant and product bimolecular geometric orientations for the reactions were obtained by using density functional theory for the energies, transition-state theory for the rates, and matrix exponentiation as well as the hybrid tau-leaping algorithm for the population dynamics. The role of including the solvent explicitly versus implicitly was also investigated. We found that adding explicit water or hydrogen sulfide molecules lowers the activation energy barrier and leads to a more efficient reaction pathway. In particular, hydrogen sulfide was a better proton donor. Finally, we studied the role of including more than one reactant and product bimolecular orientation geometry in the dynamics. Including all initial pathways, reactant to reactant, product to product, reactant to product, and product to reactant led to a larger reaction rate constant compared to the single minimum energy pathway approach. Overall, we found that most reactions which involve formalcyanohydrin occur more rapidly or at the same speed as reactions which involve acetone cyanohydrin at room temperature.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.jpca.9b05735\n\nView details for PubMedID 31348667\n\nAbstract\n\nRange-separated hybrid functionals whose range-separation parameter gamma has been nonempirically tuned to a particular molecule have been shown to yield frontier orbital energies and other properties in very good agreement with experiments. However, many cases, such as organic optoelectronic devices, require the description of molecules embedded in an environment. This can be done by combining the gamma-tuning procedure with polarizable continuum models in general and the very versatile conductor-like screening model in particular. There are at least two different ways of performing this combination. The partially vertical gamma-tuning employs equilibrium solvation throughout. The strictly vertical gamma-tuning, on the other hand, employs nonequilibrium solvation to obtain ionization energies. In this article, we compare ground-state and excited-state properties of several different molecules relevant to organic optoelectronics that were obtained using both of the two different tuning procedures. While there are significant differences in the ground-state properties, we see virtually no difference in the excited-state properties. Given these results, we conclude that both tuning procedures have to be used in conjunction for the correct description of both ground-state and excited-state properties.\n\nView details for PubMedID 31067895\n\nAbstract\n\nWe develop a new algorithm for the computation of the rotationally averaged elastic molecular diffraction signal for the cases of perpendicular or parallel pump-probe geometries. The algorithm first collocates the charge density from an arbitrary ab initio wave function onto a Becke quadrature grid [A. Becke, J. Chem. Phys. 1988 , 88 , 2457 ], providing a high-fidelity multiresolution representation of the charge density. A double sum is then performed over the Becke grid points, and the interaction between points computed using the scattering kernels of Williamson and Zewail [J. C. Williamson and A. H. Zewail, J. Phys. Chem. 1994 , 98 , 2766 ]. These kernels analytically average over the molecular orientations with the cos2 gamma selection factor appropriate for one-photon dipole absorption in a perpendicular pump-probe geometry. We show that the method is converged with small grids containing <500 points/atom. We implement the algorithm on a GPU for increased efficiency and emonstrate the algorithm for molecules with up to a few dozen atoms. We explore the accuracy of the independent atom model (IAM) by comparison with our new and more accurate method. We also investigate the possibility of detecting signatures of electronic transitions in polyatomic pump-probe diffraction experiments.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30702882\n\nAbstract\n\nThe development of high throughput reaction discovery methods such as the ab initio nanoreactor demands massive numbers of reaction rate calculations through the optimization of minimum energy reaction paths. These are often generated from interpolations between the reactant and product endpoint geometries. Unfortunately, straightforward interpolation in Cartesian coordinates often leads to poor approximations that lead to slow convergence. In this work, we reformulate the problem of interpolation between endpoint geometries as a search for the geodesic curve on a Riemannian manifold. We show that the perceived performance difference of interpolation methods in different coordinates is the result of an implicit metric change. Accounting for the metric explicitly allows us to obtain good results in Cartesian coordinates, bypassing the difficulties caused by redundant coordinates. Using only geometric information, we are able to generate paths from reactants to products which are remarkably close to the true minimum energy path. We show that these geodesic paths are excellent starting guesses for minimum energy path algorithms.\n\nView details for PubMedID 31042909\n\nAbstract\n\nThe relaxation dynamics of thymine and its derivatives thymidine and thymidine monophosphate are studied using time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy applied to a water microjet. Two absorption bands are studied; the first is a bright ππ* state which is populated using tunable-ultraviolet light in the range 4.74-5.17 eV and probed using a 6.20 eV probe pulse. By reversing the order of these pulses, a band containing multiple ππ* states is populated by the 6.20 eV pulse and the lower energy pulse serves as the probe. The lower lying ππ* state is found to decay in ∼400 fs in both thymine and thymidine independent of pump photon energy, while thymidine monophosphate decays vary from 670 to 840 fs with some pump energy dependence. The application of a computational quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical scheme at the XMS-CASPT2//CASSCF/AMBER level of theory suggests that conformational differences existing between thymidine and thymidine monophosphate in solution account for this difference. The higher lying ππ* band is found to decay in ∼600 fs in all three cases, but it is only able to be characterized when the 5.17 eV probe pulse is used. Notably, no long-lived signal from an nπ* state can be identified in either experiment on any of the three molecules.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.jpca.9b08258\n\nView details for PubMedID 31756106\n\nAbstract\n\nPhotoactive yellow protein (PYP) is a small photoreceptor protein that has two unusually short hydrogen bonds between the deprotonated p-coumaric acid chromophore and two amino acids, a tyrosine and a glutamic acid. This has led to considerable debate as to whether the glutamic acid-chromophore hydrogen bond is a low barrier hydrogen bond, with conflicting results in the literature. We have modified the p Ka of the tyrosine by amber suppression and of the chromophore by chemical substitution. X-ray crystal structures of these modified proteins are nearly identical to the wild-type protein, so the heavy atom distance between proton donor and acceptor is maintained, even though these modifications change the relative proton affinity between donor and acceptor. Despite a considerable change in relative proton affinity, the NMR chemical shifts of the hydrogen-bonded protons are only moderately affected. QM/MM calculations were used to explore the protons' potential energy surface and connect the calculated proton position with empirically measured proton chemical shifts. The results are inconsistent with a low barrier hydrogen bond but in all cases are consistent with a localized proton, suggesting an ionic hydrogen bond rather than a low barrier hydrogen bond.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b01571\n\nView details for PubMedID 31117606\n\nAbstract\n\nThe fluorescence lifetime is a key property of fluorophores that can be utilized for microenvironment probing, analyte sensing, and multiplexing as well as barcoding applications. For the rational design of lifetime probes and barcodes, theoretical methods have been developed to enable the ab initio prediction of this parameter, which depends strongly on interactions with solvent molecules and other chemical species in the emitter´s immediate environment. In this work, we investigate how a conductor-like screening model (COSMO) can account for variations in fluorescence lifetimes that are caused by such fluorophore-solvent interactions. Therefore, we calculate vibrationally broadened fluorescence spectra using the nuclear ensemble method to obtain distorted molecular geometries to sample the electronic transitions with time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The influence of the solvent on fluorescence lifetimes is accounted for with COSMO. For an example 4-hydroxythiazole fluorophore containing different heteroatoms and acidic and basic moieties in aprotic and protic solvents of varying polarity, this approach was compared to experimentally determined lifetimes in the same solvents. Our results demonstrate a good correlation between theoretically predicted and experimentally measured fluorescence lifetimes except for the polar solvents ethanol and acetonitrile that can specifically interact with the heteroatoms and the carboxylic acid of the thiazole derivative.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30507127\n\nAbstract\n\nHydrogen bonds are fundamental to biological systems and are regularly found in networks implicated in folding, molecular recognition, catalysis, and allostery. Given their ubiquity, we asked the fundamental questions of whether, and to what extent, hydrogen bonds within networks are structurally coupled. To address these questions, we turned to three protein systems, two variants of ketosteroid isomerase and one of photoactive yellow protein. We perturbed their hydrogen bond networks via a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and unnatural amino acid substitution, and we used 1H NMR and high-resolution X-ray crystallography to determine the effects of these perturbations on the lengths of the two oxyanion hole hydrogen bonds that are donated to negatively charged transition state analogs. Perturbations that lengthened or shortened one of the oxyanion hole hydrogen bonds had the opposite effect on the other. The oxyanion hole hydrogen bonds were also affected by distal hydrogen bonds in the network, with smaller perturbations for more remote hydrogen bonds. Across 19 measurements in three systems, the length change in one oxyanion hole hydrogen bond was propagated to the other, by a factor of -0.30 ± 0.03. This common effect suggests that hydrogen bond coupling is minimally influenced by the remaining protein scaffold. The observed coupling is reproduced by molecular mechanics and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations for changes to a proximal oxyanion hole hydrogen bond. However, effects from distal hydrogen bonds are reproduced only by QM/MM, suggesting the importance of polarization in hydrogen bond coupling. These results deepen our understanding of hydrogen bonds and their networks, providing strong evidence for long-range coupling and for the extent of this coupling. We provide a broadly predictive quantitative relationship that can be applied to and can be further tested in new systems.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/jacs.8b01596\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000441475800011\n\nView details for PubMedID 29990421\n\nAbstract\n\nWe present a reduced scaling formulation of the state specific complete active space second-order perturbation method (CASPT2) requiring O(N4) operations and O(N2) memory for a fixed active space, where N is proportional to system size. Motivated by the properties of the Kronecker sum, we introduce the supporting subspace technique (SST), which decomposes the CASPT2 linear equations into two parts: a single-reference MP2 energy term using dressed orbitals, plus a reduced linear system with dimension scaling as O(N2). Together with Laplace quadrature, the SST allows us to reformulate CASPT2 using a MP2 energy computation and Fock builds. By further applying the tensor hyper-contraction (THC) approximation, the MP2-like term can be computed with O(N4) operations, and the remainder can be solved with O(N3) operations using the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. This is the first application of THC in the context of multi-reference methods. We also developed an efficient implementation of the method by utilizing graphical processing units and exploiting spatial sparsity in tensor operations. We benchmark the accuracy of the new method against conventional CASPT2 for reactions in the gas phase. We apply the new method to Menshutkin SN2 reactions in carbon nanotubes, demonstrating the feasibility of CASPT2 calculations with O(100) atoms.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30068209\n\nAbstract\n\nNot only the molecular structure but also the presence or absence of aggregates determines many properties of organic materials. Theoretical investigation of such aggregates requires the prediction of a suitable set of diverse structures. Here, we present the open-source program EnergyScan for the unbiased prediction of geometrically diverse sets of small aggregates. Its bottom-up approach is complementary to existing ones by performing a detailed scan of an aggregate's potential energy surface, from which diverse local energy minima are selected. We crossvalidate this approach by predicting both literature-known and heretofore unreported geometries of the urea dimer. We also predict a diverse set of dimers of the less intensely studied case of porphin, which we investigate further using quantum chemistry. For several dimers, we find strong deviations from a reference absorption spectrum, which we explain using computed transition densities. This proof of principle clearly shows that EnergyScan successfully predicts aggregates exhibiting large structural and spectral diversity. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29297589\n\nAbstract\n\nThe excited state non-adiabatic dynamics of the smallest polyene, trans 1,3-butadiene (BD), has long been the subject of controversy due to its strong coupling, ultrafast time scales and the difficulties that theory faces in describing the relevant electronic states in a balanced fashion. Here we apply Ab Initio Multiple Spawning (AIMS) using state-averaged complete active space multistate second order perturbation theory [SA-3-CAS(4/4)-MSPT2] which describes both static and dynamic electron correlation effects, providing a balanced description of both the initially prepared bright 11Bu (ππ*) state and non-adiabatically coupled dark 21Ag state of BD. Importantly, AIMS allows for on-the-fly calculations of experimental observables. We validate our approach by directly simulating the time resolved photoelectron-photoion coincidence spectroscopy results presented in Paper I [A. E. Boguslavskiy et al., J. Chem. Phys. 148, 164302 (2018)], demonstrating excellent agreement with experiment. Our simulations reveal that the initial excitation to the 11Bu state rapidly evolves via wavepacket dynamics that follow both bright- and dark-state pathways as well as mixtures of these. In order to test the sensitivity of the AIMS results to the relative ordering of states, we considered two hypothetical scenarios biased toward either the bright 1Bu or the dark 21Ag state. In contrast with AIMS/SA-3-CAS(4/4)-MSPT2 simulations, neither of these scenarios yields favorable agreement with experiment. Thus, we conclude that the excited state non-adiabatic dynamics in BD involves both of these ultrafast pathways.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29716209\n\nAbstract\n\nThe ultrafast excited state dynamics of the smallest polyene, trans-1,3-butadiene, were studied by femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron-photoion coincidence (TRPEPICO) spectroscopy. The evolution of the excited state wavepacket, created by pumping the bright 1Bu (ππ*) electronic state at its origin of 216 nm, is projected via one- and two-photon ionization at 267 nm onto several ionization continua. The results are interpreted in terms of Koopmans' correlations and Franck-Condon factors for the excited and cationic states involved. The known predissociative character of the cation excited states is utilized to assign photoelectron bands to specific continua using TRPEPICO spectroscopy. This permits us to report the direct observation of the famously elusive S1(21Ag) dark electronic state during the internal conversion of trans 1,3-butadiene. Our phenomenological analysis permits the spectroscopic determination of several important time constants. We report the overall decay lifetimes of the 11Bu and 21Ag states and observe the re-appearance of the hot ground state molecule. We argue that the apparent dephasing time of the S2(11Bu) state, which leads to the extreme breadth of the absorption spectrum, is principally due to large amplitude torsional motion on the 1Bu surface in conjunction with strong non-adiabatic couplings via conical intersections, whereupon nuclear wavepacket revivals to the initial Franck-Condon region become effectively impossible. In Paper II [W. J. Glover et al., J. Chem. Phys. 148, 164303 (2018)], ab initio multiple spawning is used for on-the-fly computations of the excited state non-adiabatic wavepacket dynamics and their associated TRPEPICO observables, allowing for direct comparisons of experiment with theory.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29716221\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Born-Oppenheimer approximation underlies much of chemical simulation and provides the framework defining the potential energy surfaces that are used for much of our pictorial understanding of chemical phenomena. However, this approximation breaks down when the dynamics of molecules in excited electronic states are considered. Describing dynamics when the Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down requires a quantum mechanical description of the nuclei. Chemical reaction dynamics on excited electronic states is critical for many applications in renewable energy, chemical synthesis, and bioimaging. Furthermore, it is necessary in order to connect with many ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopic experiments. In this review, we provide an overview of methods that can describe nonadiabatic dynamics, with emphasis on those that are able to simultaneously address the quantum mechanics of both electrons and nuclei. Such ab initio quantum molecular dynamics methods solve the electronic Schrödinger equation alongside the nuclear dynamics and thereby avoid the need for precalculation of potential energy surfaces and nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements. Two main families of methods are commonly employed to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics in molecules: full quantum dynamics, such as the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method, and classical trajectory-based approaches, such as trajectory surface hopping. In this review, we describe a third class of methods that is intermediate between the two: Gaussian basis set expansions built around trajectories.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29465231\n\nAbstract\n\nSymmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) is a valuable method for analyzing intermolecular interactions. The functional group SAPT partition (F-SAPT) has been introduced to provide additional insight into the origins of noncovalent interactions. Until now, SAPT analysis has been too costly for large ligand-protein complexes where it could provide key insights for chemical modifications that might improve ligand binding. In this paper, we present a large-scale implementation of a variant of F-SAPT. Two pragmatic choices are made from the outset to render the problem tractable: (1) Ab initio computation of dispersion and exchange-dispersion is replaced with Grimme's empirical dispersion correction. (2) Basis sets with augmented functions are avoided to allow for efficient integral screening. These choices allow the F-SAPT analysis to be written largely in terms of Coulomb and exchange matrix builds which have been implemented efficiently on graphical processing units (GPUs). Our formulation of F-SAPT is routinely applicable to molecules with well over 3000 atoms and 25,000 basis functions and is particularly optimized for the case where one monomer is significantly larger than the other. This is demonstrated explicitly with results from F-SAPT analysis of the full indinavir @ HIV-II protease complex (PDB ID 1HSG ) in a polarized double-ζ basis.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29345933\n\nAbstract\n\nWe present the rank-reduced full configuration interaction (RR-FCI) method, a variational approach for the calculation of extremely large full configuration interaction (FCI) wavefunctions. In this report we show that RR-FCI can provide ground state singlet and triplet energies within kcal/mol accuracy of full CI (FCI) with computational effort scaling as the square root of the number of determinants in the CI space (compared to conventional FCI methods which scale linearly with the number of determinants). Fast graphical processing unit (GPU) accelerated projected σ=Hc matrix-vector product formation enables calculations with configuration spaces as large as 30 electrons in 30 orbitals, corresponding to an FCI calculation with over 2.4x1016 configurations. We apply this method in the context of complete active space configuration interaction calculations to acenes with 2-5 aromatic rings, comparing absolute energies against FCI when possible and singlet/triplet excitation energies against both density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and experimental results. The dissociation of molecular nitrogen was also examined using both FCI and RR-FCI. In each case we found that RR-FCI provides a low cost alternative to FCI, with particular advantages when relative energies are desired.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29889519\n\nAbstract\n\nUltrafast proton migration and isomerization are key processes for acetylene and its ions. However, the mechanism for ultrafast isomerization of acetylene [HCCH]2+ to vinylidene [H2CC]2+ dication remains nebulous. Theoretical studies show a large potential barrier ( > 2 eV) for isomerization on low-lying dicationic states, implying picosecond or longer isomerization timescales. However, a recent experiment at a femtosecond X-ray free-electron laser suggests sub-100 fs isomerization. Here we address this contradiction with a complete theoretical study of the dynamics of acetylene dication produced by Auger decay after X-ray photoionization of the carbon atom K shell. We find no sub-100 fs isomerization, while reproducing the salient features of the time-resolved Coulomb imaging experiment. This work resolves the seeming contradiction between experiment and theory and also calls for careful interpretation of structural information from the widely applied Coulomb momentum imaging method.The timescale of isomerization in molecules involving ultrafast migration of constituent atoms is difficult to measure. Here the authors report that sub-100 fs isomerization time on acetylene dication in lower electronic states is not possible and point to misinterpretation of recent experimental results.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28878226\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Frenkel exciton model is a useful tool for theoretical studies of multichromophore systems. We recently showed that the exciton model could be used to coarse-grain electronic structure in multichromophoric systems, focusing on singly excited exciton states [ Acc. Chem. Res. 2014 , 47 , 2857 - 2866 ]. However, our previous implementation excluded charge-transfer excited states, which can play an important role in light-harvesting systems and near-infrared optoelectronic materials. Recent studies have also emphasized the significance of charge-transfer in singlet fission, which mediates the coupling between the locally excited states and the multiexcitonic states. In this work, we report on an ab initio exciton model that incorporates charge-transfer excited states and demonstrate that the model provides correct charge-transfer excitation energies and asymptotic behavior. Comparison with TDDFT and EOM-CC2 calculations shows that our exciton model is robust with respect to system size, screening parameter, and different density functionals. Inclusion of charge-transfer excited states makes the exciton model more useful for studies of singly excited states and provides a starting point for future construction of a model that also includes double-exciton states.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28617595\n\nAbstract\n\nWe recently developed an algorithm to compute response properties for the state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field method (SA-CASSCF) that capitalized on sparsity in the atomic orbital basis. Our original algorithm was limited to treating small to moderate sized active spaces, but the recent development of graphical processing unit (GPU) based direct-configuration interaction algorithms provides an opportunity to extend this to large active spaces. We present here a direct-compatible version of the coupled perturbed equations, enabling us to compute response properties for systems treated with arbitrary active spaces (subject to available memory and computation time). This work demonstrates that the computationally demanding portions of the SA-CASSCF method can be formulated in terms of seven fundamental operations, including Coulomb and exchange matrix builds and their derivatives, as well as, generalized one- and two-particle density matrix and σ vector constructions. As in our previous work, this algorithm exhibits low computational scaling and is accelerated by the use of GPUs, making possible optimizations and nonadiabatic dynamics on systems with O(1000) basis functions and O(100) atoms, respectively.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1063/1.4979844\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000400625800014\n\nView details for PubMedID 28477593\n\nAbstract\n\nWe recently outlined an efficient multi-tiered parallel ab initio excitonic framework that utilizes time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to calculate ground and excited state energies and gradients of large supramolecular complexes in atomistic detail - enabling us to undertake non-adiabatic simulations which explicitly account for the coupled anharmonic vibrational motion of all the constituent atoms in a supramolecular system. Here we apply that framework to the 27 coupled bacterio-chlorophyll-a chromophores which make up the LH2 complex, using it to compute an on-the-fly nonadiabatic surface-hopping (SH) trajectory of electronically excited LH2. Part one of this article is focussed on calibrating our ab initio exciton Hamiltonian using two key parameters: a shift δ, which corrects for the error in TDDFT vertical excitation energies; and an effective dielectric constant ε, which describes the average screening of the transition-dipole coupling between chromophores. Using snapshots obtained from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations (MD) of LH2, we tune the values of both δ and ε through fitting to the thermally broadened experimental absorption spectrum, giving a linear absorption spectrum that agrees reasonably well with experiment. In part two of this article, we construct a time-resolved picture of the coupled vibrational and excitation energy transfer (EET) dynamics in the sub-picosecond regime following photo-excitation. Assuming Franck-Condon excitation of a narrow eigenstate band centred at 800 nm, we use surface hopping to follow a single nonadiabatic dynamics trajectory within the full eigenstate manifold. Consistent with experimental data, this trajectory gives timescales for B800→B850 population transfer (τB800→B850) between 650-1050 fs, and B800 population decay (τ800→) between 10-50 fs. The dynamical picture that emerges is one of rapidly fluctuating LH2 eigenstates that are delocalized over multiple chromophores and undergo frequent crossing on a femtosecond timescale as a result of the atomic vibrations of the constituent chromophores. The eigenstate fluctuations arise from disorder that is driven by vibrational dynamics with multiple characteristic timescales. The scalability of our ab initio excitonic computational framework across massively parallel architectures opens up the possibility of addressing a wide range of questions, including how specific dynamical motions impact both the pathways and efficiency of electronic energy-transfer within large supramolecular systems.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1039/c7cp00492c\n\nView details for PubMedID 28430270\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the first paper of the series [Paper I, C.

This reduced the formal scaling of the SOS-MP2 energy calculation to cubic with respect to system size. The computational bottleneck then becomes the THC metric matrix inversion, which scales cubically with a large prefactor. In this work, the local THC approximation is proposed to reduce the computational cost of inverting the THC metric matrix to linear scaling with respect to molecular size. By doing so, we have removed the primary bottleneck to THC-SOS-M"
