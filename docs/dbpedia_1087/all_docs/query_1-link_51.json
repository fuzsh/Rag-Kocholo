        "text": "My name is Oscar Martínez. I am a reporter for El Faro. I coordinated the project “On the Road” about undocumented migrants, mainly Central Americans, in transit across Mexico. This project started in late 2007 and ended in 2010. Then I helped to create and coordinate the first stage of the “Sala negra” project for El Faro, which covers violence in Central America, mainly in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Among other topics I’m interested in organized crime, especially criminal groups that systematically or frequently commit high-profile crimes using economic and public power. We mostly hear about drug trafficking cases. But there are many more cases: criminal groups that focus on trafficking women for sexual exploitation, on extorting business, gangs that supplant the State by providing public services such as garbage collection, and criminals who traffick objects and people and can count on an entire infrastructure, including judges.\n\nThere are different situations. In El Salvador, gangs are the biggest animals of the criminal ecosystem… the Texis cartel and drug-trafficking groups recognized by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, have to work with very powerful gangs. El Salvador isn’t a very interesting country for large-scale drug traffickers. They use the country as a base. They have infiltrated politics – three of our ex-deputies are in jail, two of them in the United States, as well as a lot of mayors – but El Salvador has a small coast. In Guatemala and Honduras, gangs aren’t the biggest animals of the criminal ecosystem. In Honduras I think the police are the biggest criminal organization, like small cells operating in different places [and] as a type of arbitror who decides who is brought to power and who is pushed farther down on the criminal ecosystem.\n\nSecond, there are criminal organizations that commit different crimes. And third, there are certain gangs like the Mara Salvatrucha of San Pedro Sula that has managed to get in touch with criminal groups. In Guatemala, gangs are definitely not the biggest animals of the criminal ecosystem. They have almost no relationship with the big criminal organizations. Let me give you the simple example of Petén, on the border with Mexico. Unlike Péten, Tecún Umán – the town that borders with Ciudad Hidalgo – is a border zone where people traffic products such as soap, etc. I am not saying that there is no drug trafficking, but Petén is the equivalent of Sonora in Mexico. Petén is the golden gate of arms and drug trafficking, by the river La Pasión in the municipality of Sayaxché. And in that department, there are almost no gangs. In the second largest department in Guatemala, Péten, gangs are present only in the municipality where people live, especially those who work in tourism where there is no border and no other way to get rich than by extorting the poor. It’s the only place where the gangs are present. Because it’s very difficult for a criminal organization interested in profit to make a pact with gangs that aren’t primarily interested in that. If the Zetas don’t offer a hitman money, he won’t kill. Gang members when they join the gang don’t demand a salary, they don’t even ask how much they are going to be paid. They continue to live in the same miserable conditions and they might even start to extort people themselves.\n\nI’m currently working on the case of a 15-year-old member of the 18th gang who had managed to start – and there are rules set by the gangs – extorting people for US $40 a month. He was making ends meet with that. As a gang member, this guy earned less than the minimum rural wage in the country. He could have earned around US $100 a month working in agriculture. The DNA of gangs isn’t focused on profit, and that’s what sets them apart from criminal groups. It’s a matter of cultural identity: Who am I? Am I a miserable guy who takes care of a cow which isn’t even my own, my entire life, like my dad and my great-great-grandfather who both died impoverished in a bajareque house? Or am I a poor guy with a weapon who can command respect in my community? At thirteen years old, the answer is very simple and very logical, I think. Many gang leaders have been able to capitalize on this element of cultural and social identity, although it’s not so easy. In contrast, criminal organizations have a militarized logic: “I command you. You kill him, I will pay you and that’s all, there is nothing more to talk about.”\n\nOne of the things to take into account in the case of Central America is that it remains on the list of top 5 countries in the world with the highest rate of homicide. During the last five years in in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, we’ve faced an unprecedented number of homicides and corruption of governmental authorities responsible for addressing these issues. In Guatemala, after deputies were murdered in the first five years of the century, the entire state apparatus was dismantled, because the Chief of Police, the Interior Minister, the special police forces and even one deputy were involved. It shows that confidence in authorities is in crisis. In Honduras, Police Commissioners traditionally accuse their predecessors of attempted murder. The murder of the National University rector’s son unleashed a crisis and revealed corruption of authority figures. In El Salvador, not only is the former Attorney General now accused of corruption for having used the judicial system in his favor, but he just confessed that he received a secret envelope with payment from someone he should have investigated. There is no confidence in authorities. What happens in a traditionally poor region where there are various powerful criminal groups and where the State is corrupt and weak?\n\nIn these situations, people have to develop new strategies in order to survive this hell in a dignified way. I mean different things like the communal association that we call ADESCOs here. The communities talk to the corresponding gang leaders and say: “We have an issue. You don’t allow our relatives to come and visit us because they live in a neighborhood that belongs to another gang. But we want them to come and visit us. What should we do?” They refer to an authority and, in one of the cases we’ve seen, the gang leader answers: “Let’s make a deal: those who want to visit can come on Sundays between such and such hours of the morning. One of you will meet all of them at the train track. You will be responsible for those people inside the community. If they do something wrong, the one who brought them will pay for it. And you can allow them to leave the community at such time.” They have established mechanisms. I recently spoke with a school director and published her story, “The Salvadorans cross warlines every day.” Not all her students are gang members, but the school is located right in the middle of the 18 and MS territories. The school is the limit point. The first issue the director faced was that her students used to split the basketball court: the MS there and the 18 here. The second and most pressing issue was that students who lived in the MS community on the other side of the road had to cross the 18’s territory in order to go back home. She talked to her students who were gang members and said: “What should I do? Give me a safe-conduct.” And the students told her: “We’re going to let two pickup trucks with uniformed students cross this street from 12 to 12:30 without killing them. But at 12:35, we start shooting.”\n\nOn another level, all big companies including the Coca-Cola Company hire someone to negotiate extortion payments. Not only do they report extortion, they pay too. A gang member recently told us during an investigation we did for the New York Times, that the SABMiller Coca-Cola company was paying US $5,000 a month. Paying extortion is a way of recognizing a new parallel state. When you say “I pay you so you don’t harm me, although I know you can,” it’s like paying taxes. I pay you so you don’t put me in jail. Many transportation entrepreneurs hire extortion negotiators, people whose job isn’t to drive a bus or do accounting. Their only function is to receive and manage the calls of the different gang members. Because gangs have changed the demographics of a country like El Salvador, and the problem of a bus is that it crosses different territorial lines. Every gang wants its money because it’s more like a network of groups than a monster with a head and feet. One of the MS gangs in San Salvador doesn’t care if the bus paid another MS gang in Santa Tecla. They want money as well. A good extortion negotiator talks with a gang leader who manages a few gangs, and says: “Let’s make a deal: I want to pay you a single price for all the gangs.”\n\nIn this country, it’s all about business. The only one who thinks that bullets are the solution is the State. Even in Los Angeles, Intervention Teams have emerged. Bullets are the Salvadoran State’s only major way of dealing with gang territories. The State also takes a symbolic approach. Sometimes it organizes folkloric dances or builds a court in a gang municipality. But it’s absurd to think that when you build a soccer court and leave it there, you help people get along. The only way the State approaches these communities is through the Police. The State could easily create Intervention Teams, people who do what this school director did, without weapons or the power to arrest. In El Salvador, everybody has to negotiate extortion payments in order to stay put: big companies, but also the government itself, through public schools or police stations. There are hospitals that have had to negotiate: “We are in a MS zone, but sometimes when an injured patient arrives in an emergency, gang members come and ask which gang the patient belongs to and in the meantime he dies. Ask later when the patient leaves the hospital, let me treat him first.”\n\nHow do gangs express themselves when organized crime takes on a different form, like Guatemalan groups? Huehuetenango is a department where organized crime is very powerful, where the famous Agua Zarca shooting occurred when a commando of the Zetas trying to get in from Mexico fought for 24 hours with a commando of local narcos without the intervention of the authorities. They chased each other down the road and left many dead. It shows the level of control of criminal groups. In those places, in the Carrizo for example where poppy is cultivated, the Guatemalan State sent in only arrogant soldiers. The army was the only state representative the indigenous peoples had ever seen. The only figure of authority they had ever seen was a soldier brutalizing them and searching their houses. And then another authority figure arrived. Let me give you an example. In the Carrizo, on that hill where poppy is grown, I was told by a Prosecutor about one time when his teams came with pick-ups to eradicate poppy fields. Poppy cultivation has a very simple logic: the peasants have land and if they cultivate one thing, they receive some money and if they grow something else, they receive 40 times more. Which would you choose? So the Prosecutors and the Police arrived and it was so unusual to see them that a lot of happy children ran out to meet the pick-ups. When a Prosecutor asked them why they were running, the children replied: “Because pick-ups always bring presents.” They were alluding to the other parallel power, to the criminals who were regularly coming for the poppy. That other authority figure doesn’t always harm people despite being ruthless criminals who kill when they have to kill. They also resolve communal problems.\n\nFor example, Walther Overdick who has been extradited to the United States as the capo of Alta de la Paz, used to settle marital conflicts. When he was paying indigenous people to work his properties, one of their wives came to him and said: “My husband takes all the money and beats me at night.” He would go to them and say: “I’m not going to give you the money anymore. I will give it to your wife, and if you touch her I will take care of you.” His rule replaced the State. It wasn’t a model, but it was a State. It wasn’t some soldiers who suddenly appeared to burn all the poppy crops. The State was quickly replaced, for example in a town called “Democracy.” Because here we love to give completely paradoxical names to places. For example, one of the most violent neighborhoods in the country is called Ciudad Pacifica. And the most inaccessible part of Huehuetenango is called Democracy. It’s a municipality almost at the border with Mexico, above Agua Zarca. Prosecutors of the Guatemalan Public Ministry will talk about about Democracy and say: “We can’t go there, not even to pick up corpses. People there take care of things.” That explains why homicide rates in Guatemala are suspect.\n\nObviously there is a gap between the homicide rate in Honduras and El Salvador and the one in Guatemala. Guatemala has the same rate that we had during the truce, about 30. If we talk about the number of deaths, what is happening in Guatemala is what we call “peace.” So the Prosecutors told me: “We can’t go in there. There is no way for us to come and pick up a corpse because people have been angry with us.” We see different strategies. How did the Colombian narcos take the lead In the Nicaraguan Caribbean? Why do Colombian and not Mexican drug traffickers cross the Pacific Ocean? Because they look more like Nicaraguan Caribbean people than Mexican narcos. They are black. It’s easier for them to get used to the food, ways of relating to others, etc. They look like them. Mexicans don’t. When I went there, people called me “Spaniard” or “the man from the Pacific”. Their community has been completely forgotten by the Nicaraguan State. It was the entry point of the Contra that was coming down from Honduras through Gracias a Dios and into the territories of Ramas, Miskitos and Mayangnas. The situation is completely different there, historically. The main religion for example is the morava. The State is so absent that to go from one place to another, you have to use pangas. There is no road infrastructure to take you to Sandy Bay in 15 minutes. Instead you have to take a 45-minute boat ride. Because no investment has been made there. Many of the fishermen there have suffered brain atrophy from spearfishing lobsters. They plunge underwater for two and a half minutes to look for lobsters or big snails in the rocks. Then they end up with paralysis in their legs because they have an oxygen bubble in their brain. When these fishermen began to fish what they call the “white lobster,” which are bales of cocaine that Colombians throw off board when they are chased by American boats, we call them “criminals”. And the State starts to worry about them.\n\nIt’s the great contradiction of this violent region. The State believes that it can knock on the door and get into a house where it has never come before, not even to ask if people have enough to eat.” Thus the State has a long way ahead to be able to exercise its authority. It’s important to speak out, and with this I’ll finish. When you highlight the absence of the State, you reveal several things that the book A History of Violence summarizes. First, we have to speak of loneliness. Some people find themselves completely alone in the middle of this hell, this Molotov cocktail. Second, in this context, people can go crazy. They witness such terrible acts of barbarism. And people reach a point when they either escape or create a more sustainable model where the gang leader is no longer the person they’re afraid of, but becomes their boss and is treated accordingly. It’s something the evangelical pastors understood very well. When you talk about the absence of the State, you’re talking about the lack of protection and the consequences this has in people’s lives, the lack of responsibility of the State and then you’re able to see the full arc of violence. “You forgot about them, this happened to them and they overcame it in this way. Now you worry about them because of these consequences.” It’s important to establish this line of violence in order to explore causes, consequences and results. This is the logic."
