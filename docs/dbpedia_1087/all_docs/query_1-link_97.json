        "text": "Last Saturday, I recapped a horrific, sloppy Orioles loss to the Padres that I described as “the Birds’ absolute low point” of the season.\n\nI may have been wrong. After tonight, they’ve got some real competition for the ugliest loss of the year.\n\nThe O’s were trounced once again by the Guardians, 8-4, looking very much like a club that didn’t belong on the same field as the majors’ best team. Offense, pitching, and especially defense — you name it, the Orioles were terrible at it.\n\nBefore I get into the bad stuff, let’s talk about Coby Mayo. The third baseman made his long-awaited major league debut tonight and, as it turned out, never put a ball into play. His first MLB at-bat was a very professional one indeed, as he patiently laid off some very close pitches to work a walk on a full count. Mayo later added another free pass as well. In his other two plate appearances, though, he struck out, including a rough fourth-inning at-bat in which he swung and missed at three straight sliders. He’s a work in progress, for sure, but I look forward to seeing him figure things out.\n\nAs for the Orioles as a whole...woof. There’s no sugar-coating it. They were flat-out awful tonight. The last time Dean Kremer pitched, in that aforementioned Padres game, his defense abandoned him with multiple ugly errors, sticking him with three unearned runs in an otherwise strong start. I’m sorry to tell you that Kremer once again got no help tonight from his teammates, who blundered again on defense and gave him no run support to boot. Seriously, why do these guys hate Dean? Hair envy?\n\nKremer first got into trouble in the second inning, giving up three singles, walking in a run, and allowing a sac fly, giving the Guardians an early lead. OK, that’s on Dean. But the other Cleveland rally, which came in the fifth, wasn’t really his fault. The Guardians put two on base with two outs before Kremer got Josh Naylor to hit a dying quail blooper into shallow left field. Coby Mayo rushed out and Colton Cowser rushed in, but neither took charge, and the ball fell out of the sliding Cowser’s reach.\n\nUgh! Really, guys? That play had a hit expectancy of .050! It was the second straight start in which Kremer was the victim of O’s fielders turning a pop fly into two gift runs. Dean, not normally the most demonstrative guy, screamed an expletive into his glove after that play. The frustration is palpable. Kremer had to throw 95 pitches to get through five innings.\n\nAnd then came the bottom of the sixth. My goodness, folks. Avert your eyes. Cover your ears. Turn off your computer and throw it into the ocean. You’re going to be getting flashbacks to the 2018-2021 Orioles. This was an absolute disaster class. The kind of inning so atrociously played that even the Chicago White Sox would point and laugh at the O’s.\n\nPoor Gregory Soto suffered one of the worst Orioles debuts in the history of the franchise. The O’s, who acquired the veteran southpaw from the Phillies for a Double-A and a High-A pitching prospect, would have been better off putting either of those guys on the mound instead of Soto. Andrés Giménez started the inning with a lefty-on-lefty single, and the notoriously wild Soto then walked Ángel Martínez.\n\nThe Guardians tried to give the Orioles an out, with Brayan Rocchio bunting the ball to Soto, but the lefty made the poor decision to try to get the lead out at third. Giménez beat the throw and everyone was safe. Still, Soto had a chance to limit the damage if he could retire #9 hitter Austin Hedges, who is batting .153 this year and has a career average of .187 over ten (10!) major league seasons.\n\nWhat do you think happened? If you guessed, “Hedges got an RBI single,” you win a cookie. He roped a grounder past the drawn-in Gunnar Henderson at short to plate a run. Soto then got wild again, walking Steven Kwan on a 3-2 pitch (after committing a pitch clock violation to start the at-bat) to force home another run. Good gravy.\n\nSoto finally recorded his first and only out on a fly ball to right, and alertly backed up the plate, preventing a run from scoring when Anthony Santander’s throw bounced wildly past home. But that was it for him. Soto began his Orioles career by tossing a third of an inning, giving up three hits, two walks, and four runs. That’s nearly Thyago Vieira territory there. (Look him up.)\n\nWait ’til you hear how those two inherited runners scored. Against Jacob Webb, José Ramírez lofted a fly to deep center that easily scored Rocchio. Cedric Mullins fired to second and caught the trail runner, Kwan, in a rundown. But as Jackson Holliday and Ryan Mountcastle tossed around the ball uncertainly, Hedges broke for the plate. Mountcastle got his feet all tangled up and couldn’t get enough on the throw home to nail the runner. That’s right, folks, it was a two-run sacrifice fly, thanks to the Orioles butchering a rundown. This team is seriously still in first place? How?\n\nIf atrocious defense and awful pitching weren’t enough, the O’s completed the trifecta of incompetence with an AWOL offensive performance against Guardians starter Carlos Carrasco, who entered the game with a 5.68 ERA. A lineup this talented should, ideally, crush a pitcher like this. Instead, they scored one (1) run against him.\n\nIn fairness, the Orioles had some patient at-bats, drawing four walks against Carrasco and chasing him in the fifth with a pitch count of 79, but they couldn’t deliver the big hit when needed. They had only one hit against him at all. It wasn’t until the top of the eighth, when it was far too late to matter, that the O’s put together a three-run rally against reliever Scott Barlow, thanks to RBI singles by Holliday and Cowser and a Santander sac fly. Even then, they still trailed 8-4, and closer Emmanuel Clase made quick work of them in a non-save situation in the ninth.\n\nAnd that’s a wrap on another lopsided O’s loss. So far this showdown between the two best teams in the AL has been incredibly one-sided. The Guardians are clicking on all cylinders, while the Orioles look like a team that needs to get their heads out of their...uh, the sand."
