It's been one year since I joined Pernod Ricard and certainly, the first couple of months came with a potpourri of emotions: moving from settling into my new role to self-doubt, from pushing myself to eventually getting a hang of the demands of the role. Joining at a time when the organisation was going through a series of transformations, it appeared my teething phase lingered longer than I'd anticipated. Struggling to find my rhythm meant I occasionally doubted my abilities and contemplated throwing in the towel a couple of times. To get past this stage, two things worked for me. Firstly, in my subconscious, I was convinced that if I could endure, be consistent, push myself, and not give up, I'd come out stronger. Lastly, I had the support and cheering of those that mattered the most; my family and colleagues. Munirat Yahaya was that one person who kept believing in me. In fact, she opened my mind to cracking what I had thought impossible, and this was the beginning of me getting my groove back. I also enjoyed the immense support of my line manager - thank you, Bode Omosagba, for seeing the potential in me and for providing the required support all the way. I'm elated that the efforts I put into turning things around didn't go unnoticed as I clinched two awards at the FY23 company retreat and awards ceremony. Having won the CEO award and the \"Deliver through collaboration\" award, I'm motivated to continue to give my utmost best to contribute to the growth of the business. As I continue to put in the work, I'm excitedly looking forward to what the future holds. #workanniversary #resilience #appreciation\n\nIn Danone, we have 5 Behaviors as our guiding principles. They are Put Danone First, Keep It Simple, Be Accountable, Walk The Talk, and Lead with People. Something that sounds easy and simple. Achieving things that appear easy can be unexpectedly difficult. Making complex things simple is not an easy task. Putting the company's interests first, rather than personal agendas, is a challenging job. Following stated principles is not only hard but also requires courage and determination to achieve seemingly simple goals. If everyone adopts the culture as their guiding principle, corporate values will naturally become a part of daily life, not just words on slides or wallpaper. As a Danoner, we believe in it. As in Indonesia, the whole team has been on this journey for a while already and we are slowly harvesting what we sow some time ago.\n\nüåüAssertive yet Kind. Not only Thrive but also Adaptive üåü We had the privilege of joining a coffee chat with our ASEAN SVP Vijayanand Sinha who shared invaluable insights from his extensive experience as a country manager and his journey with Reckitt. His words were not only inspiring but also deeply insightful. During our conversation, he highlighted the importance of being assertive yet kind. He emphasized that we should confidently share our opinions, backed by facts and evidence, while maintaining respect and empathy for others. This balance is crucial for fostering a positive and productive work environment. He also shared his belief that to thrive globally, especially in the diverse ASEAN market, adaptability is key. He encouraged us to step out of our comfort zones and be willing to work across different regions. This global mindset is essential for personal and professional growth. Reflecting on his journey, he said he joined Reckitt because it is agile, fast, and entrepreneurial - exactly what he was looking for. His advice to himself, if he could go back to his first day at Reckitt, was to embrace these qualities fully and practice assertive kindness every day. A special thank you to our GM Alpana Titus and HR director Jarunate Pintusan for organizing this insightful session. What resonated with me the most was his emphasis on cross-regional collaboration and adaptability. It's a powerful reminder that our growth isn't confined to our home country but extends across borders. This session has reinforced my commitment to being more adaptable and open to new challenges. Thanks again for this enriching experience. Let's continue to strive for excellence and kindness in everything we do! #Leadership #CareerGrowth #Adaptability #Reckitt #Inspiration\n\n'Do you know the difference in prize money between a Wimbledon Champion and Runner Up? ‚Äì Before I share the story behind this question, let me set the context first. I have completed 11 years of my career in Unilever Bangladesh Limited today. This journey was full of challenges and opportunities. I always believed that the core source of my learning came from the interactions I had with people who had different perspectives and abilities. Therefore, I aim to recount a series of impactful encounters with both colleagues and influential leaders, pivotal moments that have played a substantial role in shaping my professional development and advancement. In 2013, upon joining Unilever as TTM, I had the privilege of participating in weeklong mentoring session led by one of the esteemed leaders in our industry, Mohsin Ahmed Bhai who was the acting Customer Development Director of that time. During a group session, he presented us with a P&L math problem to solve. While I responded swiftly, my answer proved to be incorrect. Upon identifying the step I had overlooked in my calculation, I instinctively remarked, 'oh! That‚Äôs a marginal error, somehow, I missed it,' reflecting my status as a recent graduate on my third day of employment. Mohsin bhai paused and posed a question: 'Do you know the difference in prize money between a Wimbledon Champion and Runner Up? The Runner Up receives exactly half (In the year 2013,16 million pound for the champion and exactly 8 million pound for the Runner Up), and the disparity between these figures represents that 'marginal Error.'‚Äô That impactful statement resonated deeply with me, shaping my professional trajectory over the subsequent 11 years. I always Tried my level best to be that perfectionist in every role that I was given and avoid the pitfalls of 'Marginal Error' that distinguish the best from the merely good. I remain profoundly grateful for the leadership insights gleaned from such remarkable mentors, endeavoring each day to emulate those invaluable moments of guidance and inspiration. Thank you, Mohsin Ahmed Bhai, for your dedication and the valuable time you invest in grooming us.\n\nüéâ Celebrating 6 Months in Danone's Global Digital Transformation Team! Grateful and thrilled to mark my first half-year milestone which I realized was already a week ago. It's been a hell of a ride, that's for sure üöÄüöÄüöÄ Here's a glimpse into my reflections on the transition from a local to a global role: üåê Global Perspective, Local Impact: The shift from a local role to a global one has been nothing short of transformative. Engaging with diverse markets and understanding their business needs has broadened my horizons. Yet, amidst the global scale, the real thrill lies in how every initiative contributes to local impact. It's about leveraging a global mindset to make a difference in individual communities for our consumers and patients. üåê Collaboration Across Borders: Working across borders means collaborating with brilliant minds from different cultures, backgrounds, and expertise. This diversity of ideas fosters innovation and creativity. üåê Adapting to Global Dynamics: Navigating the complexities of a global role demands adaptability. From understanding varied regulatory landscapes to tailoring strategies for diverse consumer behaviors, every day is a learning experience. Embracing this challenge every day is key. üíô Celebrating Success Together: Achievements in a global role are shared victories. Whether it's the successful launch of a direct commerce platform or the positive impact on our business performance, the celebration is collective. So shoutout to some of the most amazing people who make a difference every day: Rik Tholen, Esther Zhong, Ina Garvanska, Luuk de Klijn, Goetz Klingelhoefer, Vlad Sterngold, Monhir El-Achheb, Patrick Krul, Marissa Wouters and Camille Lavenant üéì Continuous Learning Journey: The learning curve in a global role is steep but immensely rewarding. From understanding market dynamics to mastering the nuances of cross-cultural communication, the journey is a perpetual learning experience. Here's to the incredible journey of growth, collaboration, and making a global impact through Direct commerce! ü•Ç Grateful for your trust and leadership Mabel LU and looking forward to the challenges and successes that lie ahead. üöÄ #DigitalTransformation #DirectCommerce #ProudToBeDanoner Picture by Alejandro F.
