        "text": "Muhammad Ali would almost seem unbelievable if he was created as a work of fiction for a movie script.\n\nHe was brash, bold, the best in the world just ask him and might have won an Oscar instead of heavyweight gold had he taken his A-list talents to Hollywood instead of the boxing ring.\n\nHe was more quotable than any Tarantino flick, had the presence of Brando in boxing gloves (though he WAS a contender) and survived more adventures and cliffhangers in his career than Bond.\n\nAli was made for the movies.\n\nHis life story was made into a movie or a documentary seemingly more times than he had professional fights. Ali even starred in his own biopic and guest starred on television shows such as \"Diff'rent Strokes.\"\n\n\"Hi there, Arnold,\" Ali tells Strokes' kid Arnold Jackson, played by Gary Coleman.\n\n\"Who's that?\" Arnold asked, feigning illness so he could meet Ali.\n\n\"It's me, the champ,\" Ali said.\n\n\"Joe Louis,\" Arnold says to laughter.\n\n\"This kid's delirious,\" Ali deadpanned.\n\nAli had the presence for the big screen and here are some of the greatest films made about the champ:\n\nALI\n\nWill Smith portrayed Ali when his life got flipped upside down.\n\nSmith, more memorable for his comedy and action roles, was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Ali in the 2001 flick.\n\n\"I ain't got to be what nobody else want me to be and I ain't afraid to be what I wanna be,\" Smith, as Ali, says in one scene.\n\nThe biographical film , directed by Michael Mann, centers on Ali from 1964-74 and follows him as he defeats Sonny Liston for the heavyweight title and the personal and professional drama that followed him.\n\nSmith plays Ali as he defied the draft, converted to Islam and fought Joe Frazier and George Foreman.\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert gave the film two stars and said it was a, \"long, flat, curiously muted film about the heavyweight champion.\"\n\n___\n\nWHEN WE WERE KINGS\n\nEbert had much more love for the acclaimed 1996 documentary \"When We Were Kings.\"\n\nThe film chronicles perhaps Ali's most memorable bout, the \"Rumble in the Jungle,\" when he upset George Foreman to become heavyweight champion once again at age 32.\n\nEbert praised the film and said it \"captures Ali's public persona and private resolve.\" The film won an Oscar for best documentary feature.\n\nWith Jodie Foster and Kevin Spacey wildly applauding, Foreman and Ali both hit the stage to help accept the award.\n\n___\n\nTHE GREATEST\n\n\"The Greatest\" was more than just Ali's nickname it was the title of a dramatized version of his life starring, well, Ali.\n\nThere is real fight footage in the 1977 movie, which chronicles Ali's life from the 1960 Olympics to his early 1970s title fights. Ernest Borgnine played Angelo Dundee and James Earl Jones played Malcolm X.\n\n\"The Greatest\" wasn't all that great, though it does boast one bit of interesting trivia. That song that plays over the opening credits of a jogging Ali is \"The Greatest Love of All\" by George Benson. You might know it more from a decade or so later when it became a smash hit for Whitney Houston.\n\n___\n\nMUHAMMAD ALI'S GREATEST FIGHT\n\nThe 2013 HBO film was notable because it did not actually feature an actor playing Ali. The film was about Ali's refusal to report for induction into the United States military during the Vietnam War over his claim to conscientious objector status.\n\nThe film used real clips of Ali boxing and conducting interviews. It starred actors Christopher Plummer, Ed Begley Jr. and Danny Glover as the Supreme Court justices who had to decide Ali's fate.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in Ali's favor in the 1971 case of Clay v. United States. Ali was born Cassius Clay."
