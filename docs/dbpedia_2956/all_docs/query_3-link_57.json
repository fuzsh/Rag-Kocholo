        "text": "They’ve been around as long as the film industry and the format would seem to be a winner: take a historical figure from sport, the arts, politics, or just ….history and tell their story. No problems with copyright unless you’re filming a published biography/autobiography and if the subject’s long dead, you’ve got carte Blanche.\n\nBiographical films also tend to be ‘prestige’ projects. A film about a worthy figure from history, if done competently, will automatically attract consideration by awards committees, who are always keen on ‘elevating’ subject matter.\n\nProblem is: perceptions of great historical characters change, screenwriters and filmmakers often have to ‘adapt’ the facts to make a commercial product and there’s also the fact that biopics tend to date very quickly. There have been some famous ones, but I can’t think of a single biopic that’s fondly remembered.\n\nAnd if anyone is tempted to say ‘Gandhi’ - I don’t think that IS fondly remembered. It’s dull as ditchwater and Ben Kingsley’s AA-winning performance represents a triumph of prosthetics/miraculous dieting rather than acting.\n\nRock biopics, of course, tend to fall out of favour even more quickly, even if they’re initially well-received. Bohemian Rhapsody was huge a few years back, but who admits to liking it (or its ridiculous central performance) now?\n\nMore recently, hardly anyone seems to have liked Ridley Scott’s overblown and unnecessary film about Napoleon (how many good smaller films could have made from the obscene amount of money that cinematic black hole swallowed up?).\n\nI think Being The Ricardos caught that significant moment in time for Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz eloquently. Using the actress' obsession with nailing that one comedic timing issue, and widening the story out to what really made the marriage work (and fail) is the sort of masterstroke of framing a narrative Aaron Sorkin can be proud of. Both as a biographical subject and a character piece, the film works extremely well.\n\nMeanwhile across the country but at the same network, there's George Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck, centering-around a pivotal incident in the career of Edward R. Murrow. The whole challenge of whether to deliver the news the public deserves, rather than the story they want, writ large and delivered in 2005 as the public was asking the same questions of themselves.\n\nIn my mind, a great double-feature for people who have just gotten through the relative fictions of Mad Men and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and are looking for something more substantial to chew through. Because these are not \"autobiographical\" movies that try and sum up the subjects' entire life, but just to capture the essence of what makes those subject significant at all.\n\nMy guess is SERGEANT YORK (1941) isn't 100% accurate in its storytelling much like Gary Cooper's baseball-themed starring vehicle about 'The Iron Horse' (Lou Gehrig) isn't. But there's definitely some truth in the telling of these tales. Same with ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS with Raymond Massey from 1940. Who wants to watch a boring bio so dramatic elements are often added to these films.\n\nOn the other hand the 1948 movie THE BABE RUTH STORY is, uh, not quite in the league of other, better bio-pics. A syrupy, childish film apparently meant to be released to celebrate The Bambino's life before he died that year. Babe Ruth was only 53 at the time of his passing. William Bendix stars as The Babe, who's depicted as a \"big-kid-all-growed-up\". If you watch the movie you'll see what I mean, but it's pretty dire in laying thick on the hero-worship! You might end up tossing your cookies by the end of it.\n\nYes, but does historically inaccurate make it less good? I'll say 95% of the time, yes, inaccurate films will get a hard pass from me, especially if they can't get the period down. On the other hand, such well-made films like Amadeus and Lawrence..., which at least appear historically accurate on the surface, can gain a lot of traction with me, because of the filmmaking and an \"alternate reality\" stance I can take if it's good enough. Most aren't good enough, though.\n\nI still like the film Gandhi. I would not expect anything different from a film made in 1982 about his life. Any film from 4-5 decades ago needs to be seen in its cultural context. Lawrence of Arabia, The Aviator, Raging Bull, Amadeus, The Last Emperor, Schindler's List, My Left Foot, Malcolm X...love all these. I think the OP just happens to not like these movies, I'm not sure how one then makes the leap that they are therefore a \"discredited genre.\" Particularly when an especially good biographical film is going to win Best Picture this year. There is indeed often an overdose of hype at the time of release about an actor's transformation into a known historical figure, but that doesn't mean all biopics eventually go sour like milk left out on the counter. Like any other genre, there can be good ones and not so good ones, ones that age well and ones that don't."
