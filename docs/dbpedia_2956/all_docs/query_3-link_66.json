        "meta_description": "This article aims to outline some of the main ways         in which biographical film is influencing both modern print biography         and the current development of biography theory. It begins by looking         back to a debate going on in the 1970s and 1980s about whether film         was a suitable medium for historiography and historical research,         contrasting the reluctance of some American and British researchers         like Robert Rosenstone, Ian Jarvie and Belén Vidal with French         historian Marc Ferro’s engagement in favour of the use of cinema in         history studies, and his contention that “history on film has become a         force”. The term “biopic”, designating properly speaking a Hollywood         invention, introduces a deleterious conceptual-cum-ideological         misunderstanding that inhibits theorization. Concurring with         Rosenstone to favour the word “biopic”, it suggests to go one step         further by deriving from Hayden White’s “historiophoty” the term         “biophoty”. With particular reference especially to examples of         American and French biofilms, it shows how film has retroacted on         print, especially by fostering the development of what Hans Renders         has called “partial biography”.",

        "text": "2If, on the one hand, the gap with “what really happened” is thus made more obvious, on the other hand, the biopic stresses the biographical “point of view” and proffers an implicit statement about the chosen topic. Whether this point of view is complimentary or derogatory, and even if it aims to some extent to be neutrally scientific, it necessarily elicits a discourse, determined in both form and content by the place and time in which the film was produced. For reasons that are partly technical, film yields itself more easily than print to translation and cultural transference. Thus, in the current globalization of culture, biopics exert an influence on biography practice and theory in several respects that demand to be assessed. Most remarkably, cinema tends to wrench biography free from national discourses, by turning to topics of worldwide relevance, although biographical films are by no means always about world-famous celebrities. In terms of narrative form, biopics favour “fragment biography”, by relating a limited period in the life of a chosen subject, who is often still alive, and to whose (after-) life-story each biographical production adds a chapter. Arguably, biographical film contributes to a current evolution of biography further away from hagiography, towards an ephemeral, “journalistic” reflection on the “living subject”, thus exerting an influence that foreshadows, and sometimes matches, the impact of digital humanities.\n\n3 Robert A. Rosenstone, op. cit., 93.\n\nGiven the size and universality of the genre, and the difficulties of locating or viewing more than a tiny fraction of them, generalizations about the biofilm must be tentative. Yet years of tracking such works suggests to me that the form can be seen in terms of three (admittedly) baggy and arbitrary categories: the biopic of Hollywood’s studios era; the “serious” biofilm which has for a long time been made in Europe and other parts of the world, and has more recently come to Hollywood; and the innovative or experimental bio, which presents a life in the form of a fragmented or a chronological drama rather than a traditional linear story. (A fourth form, the documentary film biography, follows the formal properties I have mentioned in Chapter 4 and will not be dealt separately here.)\n\n7 Margarita Carretero Gonzalez and Maria Elena Rodriguez Martin, “Life Through a Lens: Writers (...)\n\nIndeed, it is not always easy to establish the boundaries between the biopic and other genres, since a biographical film very often morphs into any other depending on the nature of the subject depicted. The boundaries, then, are necessarily “fluid”; the biopic can include “historical film, costume drama, musical melodrama, western, crime film, social problem film, documentary, and so on”.\n\n7It is not easy to assess such films in comparison with, for instance, the biopics of the Hollywood studio era, produced by Darryl Zanuck, Jack Warner or William Dieterle, because if the latter may appear to us today as more naïve ideological vectors, one has to account for the place and time gap: there is quite a difference in the public doxa between the 1930s and today, not to speak of the geographical differences between America and other regions of the world, although the globalization of culture, and the hegemony that the American cinema industry exerts over it, tends to mask this crucial issue. In assessing a film, the formal criteria, fluctuating with the advancement of taste and technology, overlap with the ideological criteria that vary with time and space. It may be that the latter are even more important for the biofilm, whose socio-historical context very strongly determines firstly the choice of subjects, secondly the treatment, and thirdly the film’s reception. It thus clearly appears that, in order to accomplish further breakthroughs, the theory of biofilm, just as the theory of biography, will have to approach its objects with tools derived increasingly from reception theories, and most certainly via case studies. Theoretical literature on biofilm today is rife with brief studies of particular films, but it often tends to get stranded in categorization.\n\n15 Ibidem, 366-367.\n\nSelection is only half the story; fakery is the other. From the earliest times movie-makers have faked and restaged events for their newsreels and documentaries. In 1902 Georges Méliès faked the coronation of Edward VII, prize-fights were faked, and so much World War I footage was faked we do not know for sure which is which. March of Time faked (‘restaged’) a lot, and the famous picture (and statuary) of the marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima seems to have been arranged for the camera. Patton (USA 1970) goes so far as to show several ‘takes’ of General Patton stepping ashore in Sicily to emphasize how calculated even newsreel shots were. The argument here is not over what is authentic, for if a piece of film is selected, as every piece is, it is not raw; and if the piece of film is not raw, it is not authentic even if the piece is not faked; therefore no piece of film can be regarded as simply a transparent window on a lost world.\n\n9Granted, but then nothing can be regarded simply as a transparent window on a lost world, whether it is written text, objects in museums, visited monuments or battlefields, etc. On the other hand, the accusation of fakery hardly holds water in the case of filmed political speeches, parliamentary sessions, or television allocutions, which for modern historians and biographers can be said to be superior to the written text, insofar as they convey a sense of the facial expressions, voice intonation, audience reactions, and other significant elements that concur to a greater precision of information. Be it as it may, the historian still has to do the work of interpretation. Yet, Jarvie makes a more interesting point when he comes to the question of impersonation of a historical character by an actor in biofilm, whether fiction or docudrama:\n\n22 Ibid., 1173.\n\nNo matter how serious or honest the filmmakers, and no matter how deeply committed they are to rendering the subject faithfully, the history that finally appears on the screen can never fully satisfy the historian as historian (although it may satisfy the historian as filmgoer).\n\n25 Ibidem, 6. My translation.\n\nHistory on film has become a force, like history in drama has been, with Shakespeare’s works, or else in the novel with Tolstoy and Dumas, before cinema existed. In these forms, it stood as a parallel companion of sorts, for, sitting on its throne beside her, a demanding discipline, grounded on sources, documents, which it quoted in reference. This discipline – the history of the historians – called itself scientific whereas in fact it was only erudite, savant. It demonstrated nothing, but told “what had happened”. […] The specificity of history on film, when it is a matter of fictions that do not aim at being reconstructions, is the figure of inventiveness. For us, the genius of filmmakers lies in this, that they have been able to find, in order to reconstitute its past authenticity, either an operative idea accounting for a situation that is above it, or a frame of action exerting the function of a revelatory microcosm.\n\n27 Robert A. Rosenstone, “History in Images/History in Words: Reflections on the Possibility of (...)\n\nFilm thus suggests new possibilities for representing the past, possibilities that could allow narrative history to recapture the power it once had when it was more deeply rooted in the literary imagination. […] Before Herodotus, there was myth, which was a perfectly adequate way of dealing with the past of a tribe, city, or people, adequate in terms of providing a meaningful world in which to live and relate to one’s past. In a post-literate world, it is possible that visual culture will once again change the nature of our relationship to the past. […] History does not exist until it is created. And we create it in terms of our underlying values. Our kind of rigorous, “scientific” history is in fact a product of history […].\n\n16Hayden White, whom some historians still brand as a radical “postmodernist” pretending to abolish altogether the borderline between history and fiction, applauds Rosenstone’s defence of cinema as a valid medium for history:\n\n28 Ibidem, 1197.\n\nRosenstone’s list of the effects of historians’ prejudices against “historiophoty” is sketchy but full enough. He indicates that many of the problems posed by the effort to “put history into film” stem from the notion that the principal task is to translate what is already a written discourse into an imagistic one. Resistance to the effort to put history into film centres for the most part on the question of what is lost in translation. Among the things supposedly lost are accuracy of detail, complexity of explanation, the auto-critical and inter-critical dimensions of historiological reflection, the absence or unreliability of documentary evidence. […] He seems unsure whether historiophoty might not “play down the analytical” aspects of historiography and favour appeals to the emotive side of the spectator’s engagement with images. But, at the same time, he insists that there is nothing inherently anti-analytical about film representations of history and certainly nothing that is inherently anti-historical about historiophoty. And, in his brief consideration of the film documentary, Rosenstone turns the force of the anti-historiophoty argument back on those who, in making this argument, appear to ignore the extent to which any kind of historiography shares the same limitations.\n\n31 Michael Benton, Literary Biography : An Introduction, Chichester: Wiley Blackwell, 2009, 201 (...)\n\nIt is, therefore, helpful to invoke the notion of the genre’s hybrid nature again, and to think of biographical writing as ranging along a continuum whose two poles might be labelled “documentary biography” and “aesthetic biography”. Some texts will reflect an emphasis upon documentary information about a life, others upon the narrative shape that gives coherence to a life. Beyond these poles, biography shades off into either history or fiction. Arguably, the most successful biographies are ones that exploit the mobility of the continuum, blending the verifiable information of research with a narrative imagination.\n\n19The most striking specificities of biofilm, that is to say of biophoty as compared to biography, is that for historical and civilizational reasons film is a short form, and that the cinema industry imposes upon it a commercial formatting. Thus the Simon Mirren and David Wolstencroft TV series Versailles, which can be viewed as a biophoty of Louis XIV, has been amply derided for its obvious imperative of having a sex scene every fifteen minutes, its gross implausibility, as well as its characters and situations obviously incompatible with mentalities in seventeenth-century France. Clearly the same reproaches are valid for the most gossipy, “penny dreadful” type of biographies, or other kinds of pulp fiction for that matter. Such judgements incriminate some productions, not the genre as such, and this is an issue for criticism to deal with, not theory.\n\n20From a theoretical point of view, biophoty is most interesting for its very concision, and the effect of condensation imposed upon it. As a matter of fact, very few biofilms ever tell a life story “from the cradle to the grave”. On the contrary, most of them concentrate on a particularly meaningful period of the life, usually on an existential hapax when the individual is involved in a historically meaningful event. That was already the case of The Life of Emile Zola (William Dieterle, 1937), which concentrated on the novelist’s commitment in favour of Capitaine Dreyfus, as well as J’Accuse (Abel Gance, 1919; speaking version in 1938), and TV series Émile Zola ou la conscience humaine (Stellio Lorenzi, 1978). In a different style, Le Promeneur du champ de Mars (Robert Guédiguian, 2005), based on Georges-Marc Benamou’s book Le Dernier Mitterand (1996), stages President Mitterand in the last days of his second mandate, when he was waging a losing battle against a fatal disease. The film, celebrated for actor René Bousquet’s impressive performance, is remarkable for its insightful characterization of François Mitterand, at the time when he was most tragically preoccupied with the trace he would leave in history. Another fascinating example is Camus (Laurent Jaoui, 2009), a biophoty that concentrates on the last ten years of the author of The Rebel (1961), The Fall (1956) and The First Man (published posthumously in 1995). The film portrays Albert Camus at the time he reached international fame during a period marked by his moral dilemma and commitment during the Algerian War, and the split between him and Sartre, before his untimely death in a car crash with editor Michel Gallimard in 1960, at the age of forty-six.\n\n36 Hans Renders, “The Art of the Partial Biography”, Panel presentation, Biographers Internatio (...)\n\nBiographers in their narratives have always focused on an essential part in the life of the biographee, but in recent years a striking number of books have been published as “partial biography”, in which one period or even one event by which someone has become famous emphatically is presented as the torso of the biography. […] Partial biography serves not only to improve the understanding of this person’s life, but also to improve the understanding of the history beyond this life. In this case biography does not function merely as an illustration of a well-known history, but as a multiplier of interpretations of historical events and structures.\n\n22In fact, as a concise form biophoty inscribes itself in a time-honoured tradition of shorter biographical writings, looking back to Plutarch and Suetonius at the origin of the genre, and which in modern times runs from Izaak Walton’s and John Aubrey’s Lives, to Samuel Johnson’s Lives of the Poets and Lytton Strachey’s Portraits in Miniature. In its documentary form especially, the biofilm seems to count among its ancestors these traditional shorter biographies, as well as the often abundant photograph sections that characterize the bulkier specimens of the species."
