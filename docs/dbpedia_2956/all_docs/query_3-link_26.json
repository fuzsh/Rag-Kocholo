        "text": "I don’t know if you noticed, but there has been a lot of biographical movies lately. From the lives of celebrities to historical figures to even the founders and creators of some of the most significant inventions of our time, it seems like the film industry is making movies about anyone these days.\n\nThe fact that one of the most anticipated movies of the year is about the man who made the atomic bomb is blowing my mind right now (both literally and metaphorically). This isn’t to say that all biopics are bad, but the question has to be asked: “Why is Hollywood obsessed with biopics?” So in this article, we will dive into the appeal of biopic movies, and explore why Hollywood continues to produce origin stories that nobody asks for.\n\nAre There Really A Lot Of Odd Biopics?\n\n2023 alone has released a variety of interesting biographical movies. So far, we have gotten the origin stories of Blackberry, Air Jordon’s, Tetris, Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, the Atom Bomb, and even Amazon. While majority of these movies have fairly good reviews on sites like Rotten Tomatoes, they are not exactly box office successes."
