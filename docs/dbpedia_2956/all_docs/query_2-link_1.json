        "text": "ALI Written by Stephen J Rivele, Christopher Wilkinson, Eric Roth & Michael Mann Story by Gregory Allen Howard FADE IN: EXT. MIAMI STREET - MOVEMENT - NIGHT (1964) in the dark. Coming toward us. Up and down in sync to an INSTRUMENTAL LEAD-IN from somewhere. A slip of light. A glimpse of somebody in shadow under a sweatshirt hood, staring at us, in and out of the dark as... INT. THE STAGE, HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - EMPTY FRAME - NIGHT A man walks into the shot, grabs a microphone, slips out of his jacket and looks at us. He wants to tell us something. He's in a lavender light. This is SAM COOKE. What he calls out...a throaty mixture of gospel, soul and sex...is \"Let me hear it!\" And WOMEN SHRIEK. He says, \"Yeah!\" They answer, shrieking, \"Oh, yeah!\"... EXT. MIAMI STREET - HOODED MAN'S FACE - NIGHT up and down, running along a dark road in the dead of night, passing vacant lots with debris amid trees and faded buildings. He is CASSIUS CLAY. He runs in construction boots. His eyes stare from under the hood. He passes the husk of an abandoned car, a pastel storefront. We're in Overtown, Miami's inner-city black neighborhood. INT. THE STAGE, HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB (MIAMI) - SAM COOKE shouts, \"Don't fight it! We gonna feel it!\" The women in the audience answer: \"Gotta feel it!\" EXT. MIAMI STREET - CASSIUS - NIGHT now runs diagonally across NW 7th INTERCUT with Cooke shouting, \"Yeah!\" EXT. MACARTHUR CAUSEWAY - CASSIUS - NIGHT SAM COOKE'S AUDIENCE (O.S.) Oh, yeah! Cassius runs toward us. Off to the side in the black- mirrored water of Biscayne Bay, leaden clouds in a black sky. And now Sam Cooke SINGS \"...because you make me wanna mooove...!\" and breaks into the first verse of \"Feel It.\" But we see Cassius' eyes are FOCUSED, CONCENTRATED, ELSEWHERE. To where is this man running? Why is his expression so distant? A WHITE LIGHT suddenly hits him from behind. He looks over at... 2. WIDE FROM THE FRONT: CASSIUS + A METRO-DADE POLICE CAR that's slowed, clocking the suspicious, running black man. The driver starts to pull over, to hassle Cassius. Then, the cop riding shotgun gets a radio call. He taps the driver's shoulder. They take off, the driver laughing. Cassius looks after the white cops. He is neither relieved nor angry. He's dismissive. And, instead, he sees something else... INT. A BOARD ROOM - GORDON DAVIDSON - DAY and six other patrician, white business-people of Louisville in their green baize and wood-paneled Luxo boardroom. They speak soundlessly and patronizingly to Cassius Clay, Sr., seated at the foot of the table. It relates to the stack of contracts in front of him. He is in a suit and tie, his hair and moustache are dapper. His tie's a little loud. He has his hands folded deferentially in front of him. LSG BOARD MEMBER (reading) \"...the successor trustee shall be fully authorized to pay or disperse such sums from the income or principal as may be required.\" (beat) Do you understand so far, Mr. Clay? CASSIUS CLAY, SR. Uh, yes, I do. We get the impression that, if he doesn't understand what he's being told, he's faking it. He is conforming, delivering socially mandated deference... FRONTAL: CASSIUS, SR. and BEYOND HIM, seated against the wall, is Cassius, Jr. in sport jacket and tie. Right now he looks to his left and to the right, and only then do we notice the entire wall he's against is covered with pictures of thoroughbreds and studs this Louisville Sponsoring Group owns as well. He is one among their sporting possessions. He doesn't like it. He looks at the back of his father listening. LSG BOARD MEMBER Are you sure, sir? CASSIUS CLAY, SR. Yeah. I follow you. 3. LSG BOARD MEMBER Okay. 'Cause I'd be happy to explain any of these terms. CASSIUS CLAY, SR. No, thank you. LSG BOARD MEMBER Thank you, sir. EXT. MACARTHUR CAUSEWAY - CLOSER: CASSIUS' EYES - NIGHT back here, now, crossing through black night and over black water of the MacArthur Causeway. We start to HEAR pop pop pop pop pop pop POP over Sam Cooke's music, and Sam Cooke's image SUPERIMPOSES as he segues from \"Feelin'\" to \"Bring It On Home.\" And the pop pop pop pop pop carries us into... INT. THE FIFTH STREET GYM, (MIAMI) - SPEED BAG - DAWN Cassius' fists fly in a reeling motion, hitting the speed bag. But it's his eyes that arrest us...focused, concentrated. OVER CASSIUS' SHOULDER: BROWN SPEED BAG is a blur. And it SLOWS and becomes a brown boxing glove driving in a SLOWED straight line right at us like a piston. OVER the glove, pushing the fist at us is SONNY LISTON. The brown glove hits... INT. RING - A BOXER (N.D. BOXER) in a linear left jab. These punches are watched by Cassius' eyes in the Fifth Street Gym...studiously studying Liston's feet...straight-line movement...the jab, linear and straight at us. But it SLAMS into the Boxer, not Cassius. Down he goes. He's out. The referee pulls out his mouthpiece. It's a bloody mess. Teeth have been knocked out with it, so devastating is Sonny Liston... A distant crowd ROARS. INT. RING - CASSIUS - NIGHT VERY CLOSE, climbs into the crush with other contenders. Victorious, Liston, being escorted out, passes very close to him on purpose to say... SONNY LISTON (whispers; low) Gonna fuck you up. Gonna beat you like I's your daddy... To Cassius, boxing is dangerous athletics, but Liston's malevolence is straight from the street. 4. INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS' EYES SEE... INT. CHURCH - THE BACK OF HIS FATHER'S HEAD working. He's painting a mural. It's the face of WHITE JESUS with blue eyes and blonde hair. CASSIUS, SR.'S EYES painting... EYES OF 12-YEAR-OLD CASSIUS, JR. watching white Jesus go up on the Negro Baptist Church in Louisville become... INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS' EYES watching now... INT. A CITY BUS - WATCHING - DAY the back of his own head moving through a tunnel of white faces, holding his mother's hand, passing the balloon faces of nice white passengers, teenagers in athletic sweaters going to high school, some children, all seated. MOVING through to the rear of the bus where, standing, are black women, heavyset with heavy legs, and middle-aged black men with large, rough hands, crowded on their way to the day's labor or domestic jobs in the back of the bus. 12-YEAR-OLD CASSIUS LOOKS at a newspaper being refolded by one man in front of his face... CASSIUS' POV: LOUISVILLE COURIER: EMMETT TILL Published nationwide, it shows his gouged-out eye, the barbed wire noose around his neck, the mutilation to his face because at 14 years old he winked at a white girl in Alabama. CASSIUS, JR. is frozen by the image. It will haunt him for most of his life. The man holding the paper sees the boy's fear and pushes the paper out at him as a rough joke. Cassius reacts. Then, the man rises and offers his seat to Odessa. Then someone shouts... ANGELO DUNDEE TIME! INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS PAST him a short man in a white shirt, ANGELO DUNDEE, has entered with a folded newspaper under his arm. 5. And Cassius -- elsewhere -- SLAMS the speed bag with a right hook, and the bag becomes... INT. THE MASJID AL ANSAR-MOSQUE - CASSIUS - DAY (MIAMI) in black glasses, leaning against a wall. MALCOLM X (O.S.) ...and those of you who think you came here to hear us tell you, like these Negro leaders do, that times will get better and we shall overcome someday, I tell you: you came to the wrong place. MALCOLM X is at the podium. Ceiling fans. We could be in Tripoli. MALCOLM X (CONT'D) 'Cause your times will never get better until yo make them better. And any of you who think you came here to hear us tell you to turn the other cheek to the brutality of the white man and the established system of injustice in this country, to beg for your place at their lunch counter, I say again! You came to the wrong place. And Cassius is there in a black shirt, standing in the back. Malcolm X sees him, nods...the casualness attests their familiarity is close and extensive... MALCOLM X (CONT'D) (beat) 'Cause we don't teach you to turn the other cheek. We don't teach you to turn the other cheek in the South. We don't teach you to turn the other cheek in the North. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches you, instead, to obey the law. To carry yourselves in a respectable way. And a proud Afro-American way. But at the same time...we teach you...that anyone who puts his hand on you? Do your BEST...to see he doesn't PUT HIS HAND on any...body...else...AGAIN. 6. INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - LUMINOUS HOOP - MORNING Whopwhopwhopwhopwhop...as first rays of golden light illuminate the jump rope spinning effortlessly over his head in a blur. Dust dances in light through the two dirty windows with boxing gloves and \"Fifth Street Gym\" painted on them. It's that time of day Jack Johnson called the \"fighter's hour,\" \"...between the night and the light...\" ...whopwhopwhopwhopwhop... And Angelo Dundee puts on a pot of coffee. He washes his hands in a dirty sink, thoroughly drying them. Alert and clean, he's old school. He goes back to the edge of the ring, reading his newspaper. Now, crossing past the white windows is DREW \"BUNDINI\" BROWN. He takes an orange out of his pocket, sitting on a bench, silently peels it... As Cassius \"walks\" the rope, jumping up and back. ANGELO DUNDEE (approving; past newspaper) Yeah. Like that, Daddy. Don't jump in one place. Bad for the heart. That's the most important thing. (without looking) TIME! Cassius drops the rope where he stands, and walks off as Sam Cooke... INT. THE HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - SAM COOKE segues into \"Bring It On Home\" and women in the front row reach out for him. The heat between Cooke and them is palpable. The first row is going crazy as... INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS sits into our frame, glistening with sweat, directed through tortuous calisthenics by the hands of Luis Sarria. ANGELO DUNDEE TIME!!! INT. HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - HIGH + WIDE FRONTAL: SAM COOKE'S sweating. The place is rocking as... INT. THE RING, FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS' EYES - DAY alive, sparring. But Cassius never throws a punch... He jerks back, sliding away, an inch away from being hit. He circles in a movement that seems off-balance and then becomes fluid and changes rate, faking out where you think he'll be. His sparring partner throws a jab that misses and 7. follows with a hook. Cassius slips it by an inch. Entering the gym, now, is gregarious DR. FERDIE PACHECO with a young, afro'd HOWARD BINGHAM, who starts photographing while LUIS SARRIA looks at us. None of the gathered crowd, the greatest \"corner\" in boxing, breaks his concentration. He's in his zone. We're in the ring. Cassius, trance-like, hands down, circles and slips in no predictable way as... INT. A LIMOUSINE - NOW CASSIUS IS - DAY zenned out in SLO-MO on the way somewhere in a suit and tie. People on the Miami streets drift by. The slow-moving limo floats on its soft suspension through the pastel heat of Miami. While Sam Cooke... INT. HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - SAM COOKE drives to the big climax of \"Bring It On Home To Me...!\" counter to the limo's EXTREME CALM as Sam Cooke's medley ends and... INT. A HALLWAY, THE MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER - CASSIUS - DAY in a terry-cloth robe, walks faster and faster as Dundee and Bundini, Bingham and his cameras, Pacheco and RUDY race to keep up. And as Cassius slams through a door into a large room... INT. THE WEIGH-IN ROOM, MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER - CASSIUS - DAY EXPLODES: CASSIUS/BUNDINI (shout) Float like a butterfly! Sting like a bee! Rumble, young man, rumble. Aaaaaaargh! CASSIUS Sonny Liston: you ain't no champ! You a chump! (beat) You want to lose your money, bet on Sonny. He know I'm great. He will go in eight! 500 press, promoters and boxing people turn and stare! CASSIUS (CONT'D) What you lookin' at, you ugly bear?! LISTON a tree trunk in boxing shorts, can't wait to pull apart this kid. 8. CASSIUS (CONT'D) C'mon, bum. I whup you right here! Cassius pushes past people and leaps at Sonny! He wants to rumble right now. Bundini, Rudy, Dundee, Liston's handlers struggle to keep them apart, wrestle Cassius onto the scale. A MAN (reading) ...210... Cassius Clay weighs 210 pounds. CASSIUS (changes down) You sure you got that right...? The man nods. Cassius gets off, is pulled aside. And Liston gets on: unremitting stare of death at Cassius... THE MAN 218. Sonny Liston...the heavyweight champion of the world weighs 218 pounds... BUNDINI Pounds of what?! And Cassius goes off again... CASSIUS Pounds of ugly! He so ugly, sweat run backwards off his forehead to get away from his face! C'mon, bear! I turn you into a rug!! Rumble right now, man! He's restrained by Angelo and Bundini. SONNY LISTON (low) Keep talkin', punk-ass faggot! I'll fuck you up like I's your daddy... Handlers break it up and hustle Liston out of there. CASSIUS You whup me, I'll crawl out of the ring on my knees and catch the next jet plane out of the country. JIMMY CANNON (older reporter) That a promise? 9. Laughter. CASSIUS (to Jimmy Cannon) ...you be the first eatin' his words! A Doctor claps a cuff around Cassius' arm, taking blood pressure. THE DOCTOR (alarmed, to Pacheco) 210 over 110?! I can't let him in the ring in this condition! REPORTERS (shout) Liston says he'll talk with his fists. \"Lip from Louisville.\" (laughter) ...odds 7:1 against you. Big bet's whether he'll knock you out in the first round or third round or kill you altogether. You scared of him? CASSIUS I'm scared of no man. I give Sonny Liston talking lessons, boxing lessons and falling down lessons. CANNON/OTHERS Yeah, sure. Are you a Black Muslim? Pat Putnam in the Miami Herald said... CASSIUS \"Black Muslim\"'s a press word... Dundee's defensive, fast... ANGELO DUNDEE Man's religion's his own business. What kinda question's that? REPORTERS/HOWARD COSELL Does he hate white people? Malcolm X was in town. Then he left. Was that so he wouldn't embarrass you? Liston cannot stand you... ANGELO DUNDEE (sees) Howard! 10. HOWARD COSELL ...cannot stand you, Cassius. He really wants to kill you... HOWARD COSELL is balding, tall, forties, lugging a tape recorder. CASSIUS Howard Cosell, you are an instigator! (Cosell smiles) How you get that way? When I'm done with Liston, I'm comin' for you! Dundee uses that to end the conference before it strays into \"Black Muslim\" territory. Meanwhile on the way out... DOCTOR (to Pacheco) It doesn't come down, I cancel this fight. You call me in an hour with his blood pressure. EXT./INT. MIAMI RENTAL HOUSE - DR. PACHECO - DAY past guards, Bundini, press, starts to enter. Inside, Clay's on the sofa, in his underwear, watching \"The Man With the X-Ray Eyes,\" who has the power to imbue and control from beams emitted from his eyes. Dundee and Bingham hang out. Cassius' mind is elsewhere. His eyes float to the corner of the doorway before we see Pacheco, even though from the outside, has started to enter... EXT. CASSIUS' RENTAL HOUSE, BACKYARD - CORNER OF HOUSE - DAY (MIAMI) Nothing. Cassius is asleep in a lounge chair...incongruously a TV is run from the house by an extension cord. Cassius wakes. His eyes say, \"Who are you?\" BUNDINI (entering) I'm called Bundini, rhymes with Houdini. He was a Jew, too...some other people call me Fastblack...or Daddy Mac... Drew \"Bundini\" Brown, early forties, holds a hat in his hand, his eyes always seem to be glistening, ready to rage, laugh or cry, tentatively approaches. Cassius' flat eyes return to the television. 11. BUNDINI (CONT'D) (motions at lounge chair) Shorty sent me to Sugar Ray Robinson. I gave my power to Sugar Ray for seven years, gave him my voodoo, my magic. Now Shorty sent me to you. CASSIUS Who Shorty? BUNDINI I call him Shorty 'cause he like 'em circumcised. Original people. Like Moses. And I was a babe in a basket, too. I was born on a doorstep with a note 'cross my chest that read, \"Do the best you can for him, world.\" I had to suck the first nipple come along. I didn't run away from home...I been runnin' to home. Cassius should kick him out, but Bundini's got his foot in the door of Cassius' attention. BUNDINI (CONT'D) (beat, and his raison d'�tre) Now, I gotta ask you. You fixin' them fights? Else no way you could tell great Archie Moore what round you droppin' him in...all of them predictions you make, comin' true. Never heard of nobody predictin' the round like you. You either a phony or Shorty's in your corner. Tell me the truth, young man... Cassius, stretched out, mumbles without looking at him... CASSIUS ...I study every fight. 'Til I got a plan. Wear him down two through four. Drop him in the fifth round. So the p'diction ain't a p'diction. It's a plan. And 'cause of all the poppin' off I do, I know I gotta win! That's the truth. And why I'm tellin' you? 12. BUNDINI 'Cause I'm gonna be your Inspiration. Your motivator. In your corner. Can I be in your corner, young man? CASSIUS (thinks, then) Yeah... BUNDINI (inexplicably moved, covers) Ain't spent much time in Miami. Where the water? Cassius has drifted off, back to watching TV. What he sees as his eyes close is: INT. MIAMI RENTAL HOUSE - PACHECO The blur of Pacheco taking his blood pressure. Now Cassius looks and his shaman, Bundini, enters. PACHECO 120 over 80? (re: his blood pressure) You should be asleep... The weigh-in episode was an act. We take a different measure of this man. Pacheco sits next to Cassius and eats some of his potato chips. INT. MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER, A DRESSING ROOM - HANDS - EARLY EVENING being wrapped. Cassius' shirt is off, sitting on a bench in the dressing room...the ritualistic tradition, having his hands taped. Dundee expertly does it. In the background, Bundini, Pacheco, Bingham, Rudy and Two Men in dark suits, someone from Liston's camp, and a State Boxing Inspector watch. Then, the door opens for Malcolm X, in a dark suit, thin tie. Cassius lights up. Dundee is done. The Boxing Inspector signs the tape. Then, Dundee puts on gloves and laces them while... CASSIUS When you get back? MALCOLM X Just now. I'm front row, seat 7. RUDY I'm gonna find Mom and Dad. 13. CASSIUS You could have stayed. Nobody gotta hide when they with me. MALCOLM X Nothing wrong with being cool, my brother. You been working toward this moment for four years. ANGELO DUNDEE (while tying) He's right. Dundee turns away to tear two strips of tape while Cassius and Malcolm face into a corner. Sarria throws a towel over Cassius' shoulders. Arms bent, head down, a true believer, he silently stands in prayer, bowing to the east with Malcolm. During this, Dundee starts collecting his cut gear on table. MALCOLM X It's a crusade in modern times. And television is beaming if off Telstar to the whole world. So Allah has brought this about for a reason... (time to leave) Salaam alaikum, my brother... And as he goes, leaving us, not Cassius, incomplete, Cassius returns to Dundee, who ties gloves and puts tape over the knot. The Inspector signs that, too. INT. A CORRIDOR, CASSIUS - NIGHT A door slams open. Cassius comes along the hallway, his entourage surrounding him. Three large middle-aged white officials accompany him, too. His face is set in stone. White towels are draped over his head onto his shoulders. Bundini chirps in his ear. Dundee, like a plumber, carrying the tools of his trade...a bucket, his swabs and Vaseline. And they seem distant to Cassius. They reach the end of the corridor, and against the wall stand three or four older bad cigar guys. A curtain...the sounds from the arena drift into the hallway. Cassius is on his toes now, dancing, dancing. And as if being drawn by a force we can't see, he just goes...his entourage, as if holding on, carried along by him... INT. THE MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER - NIGHT He comes into the hall...there are shouts, some scattered applause, some booing, growing; and the sound moves through the arena...the sounds of expectations, ridicule, potential 14. violence. But past the faces and the press, what's arrested Cassius' attention and makes him oblivious in his solitude to all else is the bright 20-by-20-foot place he wants to be most in all the world: the ring. INT. THE RING - CASSIUS - NIGHT is struck by the brilliance. Illuminated, ready to go... dancing...warming up. Counter to an expectation of anxiety, Cassius can't wait to get this on. Other sounds happen...irrelevant to him...and now the distant sound of Liston coming into the ring...his bulked-up presence, the roar he inspires, somewhere over there. And all of a sudden, Cassius turns to face the angry man who wishes him death. Cassius rocks left and right, like a tough kid on a corner ready to rumble. The hysteria act is gone; so is the boasting. Instead, there is only Cassius' stare. The effect is enigmatic: what is going on here? A Referee, like a distant bird, says something we don't hear... In the corner, his feet float, waiting. There's the BELL for ROUND ONE. INT. RING - ROUND ONE - WIDE It starts. LISTON right away throws a left that misses and attacks Cassius, throwing seven more that Cassius with extreme, awkward caution evades. He is fearful of the monster whose punches he has yet to feel. Nevertheless, he does his job: measure Liston's range and speed. Then, a body shot catches him above the heart. Cassius feels the real power of Liston. It could stop your heart's beating. He survives. Then... CASSIUS throws his long left jab. It keeps Liston at a set distance. He has Liston's range, now, and he dances away from Liston's charges. Then, halfway through the round, Cassius' eyes have hunted out an opportunity, and he throws his first combination with a few hard shots that, to Liston's surprise, rock Liston's head back. And, then, Cassius easily evades... LISTON'S furious big misses to the left and right. 15. CASSIUS keeps tagging Liston with his long left. And, now, infuriates Liston even more by merely walking away from Liston's big misses, provoking even wilder and more inaccurate Liston assaults. (We're aware that any Liston shot could knock out Cassius if it connected.) Then Cassius soaks up a couple of body shots, most flicks his jab, slides, dances, clinches, circles away...UNTIL... AT THE END OF THE ROUND Cassius launches a second combination, slams a couple of big lefts Liston's way that rock his head back two times. Liston's so furious, he flips, charging Cassius, who hits and ducks at the same time. The BELL RINGS THREE TIMES before they stop. CLAY'S CORNER - CASSIUS breathes hard. Dundee works. Cassius says something we can't hear. CASSIUS He was supposed to kill me. Well, I'm still alive. Angelo is talking to Clay a mile a minute, while Clay MUGS an open mouth...to the press, ridiculing their accusation he was all talk. It's clear he controlled Round One to everyone's surprise. THE BELL. INT. RING, ROUND TWO - CASSIUS + LISTON We see press with typewriters, ribbon, microphones, note pads; massive TV cameras hang on platforms over two of the corners. It's a desultory, lower-key version of Round One. And... BIRD'S NEST TV CAMERA + MEDIA Coverage segues to Liston, who throws and misses a few lefts. Cassius tags him with a few rights. THE BELL. CASSIUS literally ambles into the corner. SONNY'S CORNER: HIS TWO TRAINERS Liston's getting a lot of strident advice. THE BELL. 16. INT. RING, ROUND THREE LISTON'S LEFT comes in like a freight train. Cassius merely leans away to avoid Liston, circles and now snaps off a flurry and OPENS A CUT UNDER SONNY'S LEFT EYE. Then, he splits out of there. ANNOUNCER (at ringside, on radio) He's opened a cut on Liston. Liston's never been cut! And Cassius, seizing opportunity, hits Liston with more combinations. If Cassius won Round One, probably but not certainly won Round Two, he now demonstrates he OWNS Round Three. It's a symphony of classical Cassius Clay footwork, flicked jabs that confuse, and, then, hard-hitting combinations that rock the presumably immovable Liston. No one told Sonny that Cassius could hit. And, at 210 pounds, he hits HARD. Liston, angered, panicked, knows he's losing and goes after Cassius and misses wildly as the BELL ends Round Three... INT. CLAY'S CORNER - CLAY stands a moment before he sits. EXTREMELY CLOSE: CASSIUS CLAY breathing heavily, ignoring the stool and Dundee and Bundini, looks around. THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE 22, TO BE CASSIUS CLAY, TO BE ON TOP OF YOUR GAME AND TO BE ABOUT TO OWN THE WORLD. He looks over the crowd. Only then, turns and sits... CASSIUS (to Dundee) He's nothin' to me... The genius of Cassius... CASSIUS (CONT'D) And he knows it... INT. LISTON'S CORNER - CORNERMAN slips a vial of some medicant from his pocket and rubs it into Liston's shoulder. INT. RING - ROUND FOUR The BELL RINGS. Clay peppers Liston with jabs. Liston pokes his left at Cassius, trying to reach him. They feint, 17. circle. Liston gets his left into Cassius' face. It's more a poke than a shot. CLOSE: CASSIUS blinks back something...we're not sure what. It seems to go away. Then it's back. The fight continues... WIDER: CASSIUS dominating. They clinch. They break. This time Cassius violently blinks his eyes! Something's wrong! CASSIUS ...my eyes! A knife-like pain. He can't see. He's getting beaten up. He's in trouble. The BELL. INT. RING, CASSIUS' CORNER - CASSIUS sits. CASSIUS (shouting) My eyes! I can't see...somethin' in my eyes! Dundee feverishly washes water to get the irritant out of Cassius' eyes. INT. ARENA A buzzer sounds, warning the bell's coming for Round Five. Now Cassius stands, saying... CASSIUS (his gloves) Cut 'em off! Cut 'em! I'm blind. The BELL. Dundee's still in the ring. ANGELO DUNDEE No. You quit, it's over! Get out there. Be a yardstick. This is the big one, daddy. Get out there and run! He literally pushes Cassius into the ring. INT. RING - ROUND FIVE - LISTON rushes Clay. He knows this is his chance. Cassius tries to tie Liston up by holding onto the back of his neck, but 18. Liston pounds left and right hooks. If anybody wondered if Clay could take punishment, this answers that. WHAM-WHAM- WHAM-WHAM-WHAM...five huge hooks. Liston is desperate to end it while Cassius is in trouble. Haymaker after haymaker; some connect, others are blocked but knock Clay sideways. Clay, still blind, keeps backing and dancing. CLOSER: CASSIUS' EYES With a minute left, now, he sees better. Liston throws him into a corner, still trying to put him away. But, he can't, and Liston's energy seems to deflate once he knows that. The BELL. INT. RING, CASSIUS' CORNER - CASSIUS' eyes are clear. In 60 seconds he recovers his energy. He's ready. BELL. INT. RING - ROUND SIX - CASSIUS can't wait to get out. He shuffles. He circles. He fires combinations. In the early rounds, provoked by Cassius, Liston's anger caused him to abandon his fight plan. Now, having been proven futile, Liston's confidence is gone. He's left with nothing. Psychologically and athletically, Liston is defeated. The BELL. Liston's eyes contemplate the inevitable: face nine more rounds of this. INT. RING, CASSIUS' CORNER - BETWEEN ROUNDS - AS CASSIUS waits for the seventh-round bell. HOWARD COSELL (doing color radio commentary with Les Kelter's blow-by-blow) ...Clay, a round ago, looked like he'd about had it, but in round six... Then Cassius, knowing before anybody else, suddenly rises as if on wings. Both arms are in the air...followed by a roar from the crowd... HOWARD COSELL (CONT'D) (realizing, screaming) Sonny Liston is not coming out! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Sonny Liston is not coming out! And we can see Liston still sitting on his stool in his corner, spitting out his mouthpiece. 19. HOWARD COSELL (CONT'D) The winner...and the new heavyweight champion of the world is Cassius Clay! Cassius jumps onto the ropes in the corner, rails the crowd: CASSIUS I upset the world! I am the greatest! I am the greatest! All hell breaks loose... CASSIUS (CONT'D) (to press) Eat your words! Eat your words! Howard Cosell, the first to climb into the ring, is on him... HOWARD COSELL What made him so easy for you? CASSIUS I told you. Didn't I tell you? Bundini gives him a comb. Cassius combing his hair. HOWARD COSELL Was there any single point you knew you had him? And he sees Malcolm leaving his seat...they look at each other. Malcolm's huge smile. CASSIUS I had him in the first round. 'Cause I'm the greatest! (and seeing at ringside, calling him up) Sam... Hey, Sam! Let him up. And Sam Cooke climbs into the ring. CASSIUS (CONT'D) I am the greatest! And he the greatest rock 'n' roll singer. Sam Cooke! I want everybody to bear witness. (they embrace) I shook up the world! Don't have a mark on me! I was burning. I was blind. I'm the prettiest thing that ever lived. I shook up the world! I shook up the world! 20. As Sam Cooke embraces Cassius... INT. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - WIDE - NIGHT A small older man with fine features, ELIJAH MUHAMMAD, THE MESSENGER, sits on plastic-covered furniture in his expensive living room. With him is an expressionless man who, literally, never smiles, in a tailored dark suit. He's JOSEPH 13X. As Elijah Muhammad, the head of the Nation of Islam, contemplates Cassius' victory -- like everyone else in America, he's surprised. INT. THE MIAMI BEACH CONVENTION CENTER - PAY PHONE - NIGHT GORDON DAVIDSON is from the Louisville Sponsoring Group, standing in the chaos with another partner and Odessa and Cassius, Sr.... GORDON DAVIDSON ...I don't care what should have been ordered! We need a victory party right now. (pause) I got national press, the family, the champ, all kinds of folks... (beat) 250 to 300. Yes. INT. THE SIR JOHN NIGHTCLUB - SAM COOKE - NIGHT singing \"Feel It.\" It's packed with elated people. Outside, celebrations spill out onto the streets...cars honking... EXT./INT. HAMPTON HOUSE VILLAS - CLOSE ON COOKE AS HE CROSSES - NIGHT through the club, with lots of partygoers, picks up Chesterfields from the cigarette girl and goes out by pool, around which we see women at tables in cocktail dresses and good-looking men. Most of the rooms' doors are wide open, couples drinking, celebrating...radios playing out into the Floridian night. INT. THE BALLROOM, THE RONEY PLAZA HOTEL - GORDON DAVIDSON - NIGHT and others of the Louisville Sponsoring Group in a crowd of predominantly white people, drinking free drinks at the hastily arranged victory party, wait. Sportswriters...Jimmy Cannon, Red Smith. Cassius, Sr. is there. They all wait. No sign of Cassius. \"Where's your boy?\" A young New York Times sportswriter, ROBERT LIPSYTE, is there as well. He looks like he doesn't belong...his clothes are only perfunctorily conventional, and he's a generation younger. 21. INT. HAMPTON HOUSE HOTEL ROOM - SAM COOKE - NIGHT enters and closes the door and greets Malcolm X, in a white shirt, no tie, and Cassius, eating ice cream in a pool of light from the TV. Malcolm's wife, Betty Shabazz, comes out of the kitchenette. A little girl runs from the bathroom back to Cassius. The girl plops into his lap with much familiarity, so we understand Cassius is family and has been for a while. He's not at the Fontainebleau or the Roney Plaza. It says Cassius' sense of himself is more about what's next than what he did tonight. GIRL Why's he so scared? MALCOLM X Man, look at that guy run! Cassius feeds the girl some ice cream. CASSIUS The Mummy! \"I can't get away from the mummy!\" Yeah, but that mummy too slow to catch anybody. SAM COOKE Hey! The mummy always gets his man... CASSIUS No, he don't! (to kid) Now, don't believe that stuff on television... Laughter from the outside. Cassius looks. He's not drawn to all the partying. Malcolm takes a picture with his Contax. Through the door enters Jim Brown. Jim embraces Malcolm and Betty, Sam Cooke, and congratulates the new champ and helps himself to food. INT. THE HAMPTON HOUSE HOTEL ROOM, 1964 - NIGHT, LATER The room's near dark. Soft sounds from outside. A laugh. A snatch of music. Malcolm's children are asleep on a cot. And we see Cassius has fallen asleep on the sofa. A bedsheet is over him. Malcolm and Betty, sitting at the table in the kitchenette, quietly talking...an intimate laugh...partners. And as Cassius, the new heavyweight champion of the world, spends the first night of his reign asleep at \"home\" with this family... 22. EXT. 125TH STREET + 7TH AVENUE - CASSIUS, MALCOLM + A CRUSH OF PEOPLE (NEW YORK, 1964) - DAY Suddenly we're in Harlem. The streets are jammed. Making them crazy, causing a riot, coming down the sidewalk, looking like a rock-and-roll star in a black leather jacket, is CASSIUS CLAY and in an overcoat and hat, MALCOLM X. They OWN this day on 125th Street. EXT. MICHAUX BOOK SHOP - PEOPLE - DAY engulf them. People are their army. The sea of people press close to their heroes...reaching out to touch the champ, share a joke, laugh. A girl runs up to hug Cassius and runs off. We catch a glimpse on the periphery of Joseph 13X. Seven or eight reporters, black and white, and still photographers and Bingham, half with Cassius, half photographer in privileged position. A REPORTER The people look to you. Do you plan on being a people's champ, like Joe Louis? CASSIUS (tentative) Yeah. I going to be a people's champ... (beat) But not like Joe Louis, exactly... A REPORTER (starts) Mr. Clay...? And Cassius drops it on them... CASSIUS And I'm not Clay. Clay's the name of the people who owned by ancestors. I don't want to be called after that slave name no more. So I'm \"X.\" Cassius X. And I'm a member of the Nation of Islam. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is my spiritual guide. Malcolm X is my mentor. This is hard news! REPORTERS (all at once) You a card-carrying member? Aren't Black Muslims a hate group? 23. CASSIUS (droll) \"Card-carrying\"...? Don't need no \"card.\" You got a Christian card? 750 million people believe in Islam. I'm one of them. ANOTHER REPORTER (O.S.) Minister Malcolm...what about the reports of a split between you and Elijah Muhammad? JOSEPH 13X: we read his face listening to Malcolm. MALCOLM X This is the champ's time. And I'm here as a friend to celebrate his victory. So I got nothing you want... CASSIUS I'm going to be a people's champion. But I don't have to be the way you want me to be. I'm gonna be what I want. And I'm free to think any way I want... And, as he goes on, the crowd knows neither Cassius nor Malcolm will ever turn their backs on them. EXT. THE HOTEL THERESA - MALCOLM - NIGHT enters into the street with his Bodyguard and looks up to a top-floor window in which he sees a light is still on at 4 a.m. INT. THE HOTEL THERESA, CASSIUS' ROOM - CASSIUS - BEFORE DAWN asleep with the television on. There's a knock on the door. Barely awake, he gets up to answer it. It's Malcolm. Still in his familiar hat and overcoat. He hasn't slept... MALCOLM X I was leaving, saw the light on...how come you're up? CASSIUS (mumbles, half-asleep) ...watchin' a show on termites...they knockin' down this house, here. He goes back to lay on the bed. Malcolm looks out the window...the wet streets at night. 24. MALCOLM X I been invited to speak at Ibadan University in Nigeria. C'mon with me? CASSIUS Six million in your house and you don't know it. Where? MALCOLM X Africa. You been there? CASSIUS Africa? No. Only Rome. Yeah, man, let's go! MALCOLM X Nkrumah stayed with me when he was a student in New York, so we'll stop in Ghana... CASSIUS When we leaving? MALCOLM X Next Thursday. Malcolm's distracted. He fingers his glasses. CASSIUS (sees) What is it? MALCOLM X You ever been so angry...have you ever been so angry that you'd explode? CASSIUS (after a beat) Tore out a picture of Emmett Till when I was little. Couldn't take my eyes to it...couldn't look at it. Barb-wire around his neck to a 75- pound cotton-gin fan. Took out his eye. The cruelty to it...I couldn't look at it...couldn't throw it away. MALCOLM X What else? 25. CASSIUS I thought, \"What I do wrong to be so low that people could do that to people like me?\" It made me feel ashamed. And that makes no sense. But that's what it was. MALCOLM X ...when I heard about the four girls bombed in the 16th Street Church in Birmingham? (beat) The prohibitions of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad prevented me from speaking my voice in action. Because Birmingham was part of the civil rights movement, begging for a place at the white man's table... But dead children...are dead children. So the anger I felt, I had to contain. I locked that down! So tight my muscles seized. I lost control over the right side of my body. Leg didn't work...right arm didn't work. \"I'm having a stroke,\" I thought. I had to hold it in 'cause I wanted, all I wanted was to BREAK SOMETHING! Break a part...any part of this system. Because you are so provoked as a human being. In your spirit. In your heart... At the death of children. But I COULD DO...nothing. Cassius is quiet. MALCOLM X (CONT'D) (putting his glasses back on) Everyone knows... Now I'm advocating more direct political action involvement with the international struggle... So Elijah Muhammad has suspended me as a Minister in the Nation of Islam for 90 days. CASSIUS You can fix that... MALCOLM X I don't know. I will try when we get back. Until then I will live each day as if I am already dead. 26. That statement surprises Cassius, but he says nothing. Malcolm X stands by the window and watches the day begin in Harlem. INT. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S HOUSE, CHICAGO, 1964 - JOSEPH 13X - DAY approaches Cassius in a suit and tie and beckons him into a living room in which sits Elijah Muhammad on a plastic- covered white sofa. Cassius is at his most deferential, awed at being in this man's presence. Elijah's power is the inverse of his size. He's short and delicate-featured. He motions for Cassius to sit beside him. Joseph 13X sits across the room with two men. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD Only after long service and high merit in the spiritual and physical rebirth of Afro-American people...is one granted an original name. But you are special. A world champion. So there is a gift I wish to give you. From this day forward you will be known as Muhammad Ali...which means \"one worthy of praise,\" and Ali means \"most high.\" CASSIUS (a beat, sounding it) Muhammad Ali. (humble) \"Worthy of praise...\" Thank you! And he's genuinely moved. As Elijah Muhammad puts his small hands in Muhammad Ali's hands...giving him his blessings... ELIJAH MUHAMMAD (cautioning) Be very careful what you say...your words reflect on the nation of Islam, now. CASSIUS Yes, sir. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD (after a beat) Up until now, I have entrusted your spiritual development to Brother Malcolm. (beat) I do not feel this is a wise course anymore. 27. Extremely emotional about Malcolm, tears come to Elijah Muhammad's eyes. Joseph 13X observes in the background. Cassius is taken by surprise at \"The Messenger\"'s display... ELIJAH MUHAMMAD (CONT'D) Malcolm has gone off into the secular world and does not measure his words. I have decided to give you, as your guide, my very own son, Herbert Muhammad. And he looks across the room...a roly-poly man wearing a bow tie...HERBERT MUHAMMAD. He has a habit of nervously straightening his shirt. A seemingly mild, pleasant man, he is without self-definition. Below this avuncular surface, he defines himself by quietly desiring and acquiring what is others'. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD (CONT'D) Herbert will supervise all of your spiritual and material needs. CASSIUS (not a thought) This is a great honor, Messenger... Elijah gives a subtle look and Herbert retreats to where he came from, sitting back on the couch by Joseph 13X... EXT. THE CLAY HOUSE, LOUISVILLE, 1964 - EVENING We've entered mid-scene. CASSIUS CLAY, SR. Why you want to change? A NEIGHBOR (V.O.) (to Ali) Could we get a picture with you? (to Cassius, Sr.) You mind, Mr. Clay? A neighboring family coming to stand beside Ali. Cassius, Sr. steps aside. CASSIUS CLAY, SR., a sport, a flamboyant man, is impatient. Inside, Odessa Clay and brother, Rudy, are talking. CASSIUS CLAY, SR. What's wrong with the lawyers and managers you got? 28. A NEIGHBOR One more. (click) Thank you. CASSIUS CLAY, SR. Yeah, yeah... They leave. CASSIUS CLAY, SR. (CONT'D) You got...I got you the best white men I could find. Right here in L'ville... ALI When the contract run out. I want black lawyers and managers. Chauncey Eskridge on North La Salle Street... CASSIUS CLAY, SR. (angrily) They saved you from the gangsters, from the jackals and the hyenas of boxing. Never cheated you. Protected you with a trust fund... ALI I don't need no \"protectin'\" from myself. Why I need protecting from myself by them...? CASSIUS CLAY, SR. And now I got to go tell them, \"Piss off. Cassius don't want you around no more.\" ALI I ain't one of their thoroughbreds! Or their charity things. \"Let's do somethin' for that well-behaved colored boy, Cassius.\" I ain't well-behaved nothing! I am a man. The light starts to go...porch lights starting to come on... ALI (CONT'D) And I am not Cassius. I changed my name. I am Muhammad Ali, now. CASSIUS CLAY, SR. You what? 29. ALI That's right. CASSIUS CLAY, SR. (stunned) What? What's wrong with...our name, my name...? We're...we made you. We... ALI No one \"made me\"... CASSIUS CLAY, SR. No bow-tie-wearin', Arab-talkin' nigger gonna change that... ALI (anybody's son) I made me. (adamant) No one's in that ring but me! CASSIUS CLAY, SR. You don't know who you are... ALI I know who I'm not...I'm not drinkin'! Goin' back on my wife! I am not prayin' to no blue-eyed, blonde-haired Jesus. I ain't... CASSIUS CLAY, SR. Paintin' blue-eyed, blonde-haired Jesuses and signs on cars is what put steak and vegetables in you, clothes on you... ODESSA CLAY ...dinner! And we realize it has gotten too dark to see... CASSIUS CLAY, SR. (cold) Go ahead! Bitter silences. CASSIUS CLAY, SR. (CONT'D) Go ahead. Cassius, Sr. walks off...his back arched too straight, trying to hold his pride together. 30. ODESSA CLAY You didn't get it from me...your words, your sense of humor, what makes you angry, what makes you a fighter. You got that from your daddy... ALI You saying I'm just like him? ODESSA CLAY I'm saying, if he was your age today, he'd do the same as you. And he knows that. And Odessa goes back inside. INT. MALCOLM'S HOUSE, KITCHEN (QUEENS, NEW YORK), 1964 - NIGHT We see Malcolm at work at the kitchen table. It's cluttered and small. The telephone rings... ONE OF HIS CHILDREN (OVER) Daddy... For you... Malcolm gets it. JOSEPH 13X (V.O.) Brother Malcolm... MALCOLM X What is it, Joseph? JOSEPH 13X (V.O.) The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has given the Muslim name, Muhammad Ali, to Cassius X. Herbert Muhammad's been placed in charge of his training, instead of you. (and ultimately) Muhammad Ali will not be traveling with you to Africa. Malcolm's still. He's been co-opted. JOSEPH 13X (V.O.) (CONT'D) The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has asked me to inform you your suspension has been extended indefinitely. Joseph 13X hangs up. Malcolm quietly closes the door. Malcolm dials a number. No answer. 31. Betty has come in. They exchange a look. BETTY SHABAZZ (concerned for her husband) Malcolm? MALCOLM X (after a beat, disconsolate) Cassius won't be coming to Africa...not with me. She puts her hand on Malcolm's shoulder. BETTY SHABAZZ Go anyway. Don't put it off. It's not safe here. ONE OF HIS CHILDREN (OVER) (calling) Mommy...the bath's ready... CUT TO: INT. GHANA AIR DC-8 COCKPIT - ALI - NIGHT in first class on a \"Ghana Airlines\" flight to Africa. Close by is Herbert Muhammad. Howard Bingham and Ali's brother, Rudy, are across the aisle from him, asleep... The plane bumps in choppy air. Muhammad, unable to sleep, a nervous flyer, gets up. He wanders up the aisle to the front of the plane. A Stewardess comes out of the cockpit. Muhammad slows, startled by the pilots. Both pilot and copilot are black. ALI (joking) Hey, man, where they put the real pilot? What you doin' up here? PILOT (not understanding; British accent) I am...the pilot. He's the copilot... (moves map case) Here, Mr. Clay, sit down... ALI No, man, I meant...in L'ville, when I growed up, they barely let black folks drive buses. 32. Ali looks out the window...a new day downs over the land. Then Bingham shows up over Ali's shoulder. They all pose, facing the rear of the cockpit. Then, the Pilot points to the coast below them and the sunrise... THE PILOT Here we are. Cote d'Ivoire...Africa. CUT TO: EXT. BUILDING IN CAIRO - CABLE - DAY (EGYPT) snakes out a building. CAM FOLLOWS IT and we HEAR... BETTY SHABAZZ (V.O.) We should think of a name, Malcolm... INT. CAIRO BUILDING - WIDE: HALLWAY - DAY MARLIN THOMAS -- paunchy, grey, late 40's -- walks up the stairs carrying take-out food. MALCOLM X (V.O.) How about Gamilah or Khalilah? INT. CAIRO EMPTY APARTMENT - MARLIN THOMAS - DAY crosses to ANOTHER AMERICAN wearing headphones in the glassed-in balcony where the CABLE connects to a portable tape-recorder. MARLIN THOMAS (eating) Anything? THE MAN ...on the phone with his wife. She's having a hard time sleeping...baby's kicking a lot... MARLIN THOMAS Motor Pool, here, have a Chevy parts catalogue...? As the CIA monitors Malcolm X... CUT TO: EXT. INDEPENDENCE SQUARE, ACCRA - ALI - DAY (GHANA) in a Mercedes convertible. It's a monumental expression of the force for the independence of black Africa. Accra is a wonder to Ali. A Third World showplace, in 1964 Ghana is alive with the optimism of emerging Africa. Infrastructure 33. and real estate are well-managed. Under Nkrumah, the city is in a frenzy of building public housing... ALI in the three-car caravan, passes the huge triumphal arch with its giant black star on the top. Thousands line the route to see the heavyweight champion and cheer him. For Ali it's another kind of parade... ALI'S POV: GHANAIANS They're stockbrokers and street cleaners, salesmen and secretaries, hotel managers and military officers... All is a contrast to the de facto apartheid of the middle America of Ali's experience. They all cheer his caravan as it passes. CUT TO: EXT. THE AMBASSADOR HOTEL, ACCRA - MERCEDES - LATE AFTERNOON (GHANA) arrives with Ali and entourage. It's a modern hotel. Meanwhile, a different group are about to depart in limos. One among them, a tall Man in a dashiki and sunglasses and carrying a walking stick, separates. He sees Ali. So does the woman next to him. She is the poet Maya Angelou. MALCOLM X (shouts) Brother Muhammad... Taking off his shades, we realize it's Malcolm X. He wears a goatee, now. Ali turns, sees him. Total surprise. ALI Hey, man!!! They embrace. Ali greets him like the old friend he is. Maya and the Chinese diplomat wait a few steps removed. ALI (CONT'D) How you doin'? What's up, brother? I knew you were here...didn't think you were still here... MALCOLM X And I heard you were coming. 34. ALI We just got here now... (words rush out) And, maaan, the brothers were flyin' a DC 8. Flippin' switches, navigatin', filing flight plans, talkin' French... And they remember how much they like each other. ALI (CONT'D) Where you goin'? MALCOLM X When...uh, Liberia. When you fighting Liston? ALI November. MALCOLM X This is Maya Angelou and Ambassador Huang Ha. Amando Gonzalez is from Cuba. Taher Kaid is the Ambassador from Algeria. Ali waves. They keep their distance. ALI Man, where should I go? We're planning on Egypt. MALCOLM X Algeria. See Ben Bella... (beat) Go to Mecca, Medina. I just came back. Made my seven circuits around the Kaaba, prayed at sunrise... There were two million people...pilgrims from all over. Dressed all the same, high and low, the same. Blonde-haired, blue-eyed Muslims. Arabs. (off Ali's look of surprise) Blacks. Yeah. All of them, Muslims praying together. INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL ROOM - MARLIN THOMAS - DAY who was surveilling Malcolm X in Cairo is here, too. Right now he picks up the phone. REVEAL at the window an African Man and another American with binoculars. 35. BRADLEY (V.O.) Hello...? MALCOLM X It's Marlin. You'll never guess who Malcolm ran into... CUT TO: INT. LEOPOLDVILLE SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - BRADLEY - DAY (CONGO) BRADLEY (in French; into phone) Un moment... BRADLEY (CONT'D) (English translation; into phone) Hold on a second... BRADLEY, an American in his late 30's, who's balding and whose mouth is too wide, sits at the teacher's desk in an empty classroom. A heavyset American and two Black African Thugs with M-1 carbines are with him. MOBUTU'S MILITARY AIDE (in French) Le Minist�re de D�fense vous remercie. MOBUTU'S MILITARY AIDE (CONT'D) (English translation) The Defense Minister thanks you. Uniformed MOBUTU'S MILITARY AIDE smiles and warmly shakes Bradley's hand. Bradley says \"he's welcome\" and signals to the Heavyset American. The American leads Mobutu's Military Aide somewhere. Meanwhile... BRADLEY (in French) Il n'y a pas de quoi. Cela m'a fait grand plaisir. Faites-lui mes compliments. BRADLEY (CONT'D) (English translation) It's nothing. Give him my compliments. INT. LEOPOLDVILLE SCHOOL CORRIDOR - MOBUTU'S MILITARY AIDE FOLLOWS BRADLEY'S AMERICAN to a sports court. Eight Uniformed Soldiers are with them. In the sports court, on their knees, hands bound behind them, facing away from us, are six prisoners in business clothes. 36. One is a woman. Guarding them are Bradley's Guards. Mobutu's Military Aide's soldiers take over the prisoners. Mobutu's Military Aide talks into a walkie-talkie. Meanwhile... GEN. JOSEPH MOBUTU IN UNIFORM listens to his walkie-talkie. He has distant eyes. He's heard what he needs and walks up a staircase and around a corner. INT. LEOPOLDVILLE SCHOOL, SECOND CLASSROOM - MOBUTU enters. He is the beneficiary of this routine military coup. Other uniformed officers at students' desks now stand and applaud. Mobutu will rename the Congo \"Zaire\" and we'll see him later. Meanwhile in Ghana... INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL ROOM - MARLIN THOMAS - DAY MARLIN THOMAS Malcolm bumped into Cassius Clay. Muhammad Ali...whatever he calls himself... BRADLEY I thought that was all over. Is Clay going to support Malcolm's U.N. resolution? MARLIN THOMAS I don't know. BRADLEY Find out. We'll pick up on Malcolm in Liberia ourselves. EXT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - ALI + MALCOLM X MALCOLM X Drank from the well of Zem-Zem... And you should visit Cairo. I have friends there in... Meanwhile... ALI (his thoughts) ...shouldn't have quarreled with the Honorable Elijah... The rapport between them becomes fleeting. Ali's attention drifts away. He closes down... 37. ALI (CONT'D) (to himself) You shouldn't have... (vocalized) ...quarreled with the honorable Elijah Muhammad... MALCOLM X What? ALI You shouldn't have quarreled with Elijah Muhammad. And Ali separates. He turns away. Malcolm calls after him... MALCOLM X Brother Muhammad... Ali won't turn back from his rejection of Malcolm. He shakes his head \"no\" and walks off. MALCOLM X (CONT'D) Brother Muhammad...! INT. TIGER LOUNGE, CHICAGO - SHERI - NIGHT sings \"For Your Precious Love,\" and REVEAL: ALI + SONJI ROI dancing. We're back in Chicago. She's sexy and has a great smile and flashing eyes. People leave Ali alone. One Fruit of Islam bodyguard is nearby, semi-conspicuous. In a booth is Herbert with a date, another FOI guard, and a businessman. Sonji, who is sexually overt and fun, is laminated to Ali. After a few bars... ALI Sonji...Sonji Roi... SONJI (laughs) What you keep sayin' my name for? ALI 'Cause I love it, girl. How long you been workin' for Herbert? SONJI 'Bout a year. I sell \"Muhammad Speaks\" over the phone... ALI What kind of name is that? 38. SONJI My father named me after Sonja Henie. ALI What's your father do? SONJI He was shot in a poker game when I was two. He don't do nothin'. Sonja, on the other hand, was an ice skater, and my mother died when I was eleven. ALI So who raised you? SONJI Godparents, but I been on my own, doing my own thing... ALI Whatcha doin' tomorrow? Go ridin' with me. SONJI No. I gotta work, you know. ALI I square it with Herbert. I got a record player in my car. SONJI A record player? C'mon. How come it don't skip? ALI Got springs and stuff. SONJI Herbert said you met The Beatles. ALI Yeah. Only one of 'em's smart...the one with the glasses. SONJI ...he's my favorite. ALI People all screaming and fainting. I asked him, \"This the way they act when you get big?\" 39. SONJI What he say? ALI He said, \"Champ. The more real you get, the more unreal it gonna get.\" SONJI Wow... After Sheri sings the first chorus... ALI Let's go... SONJI Yeah... ALI (crossing out) Where you live? SONJI I'm takin' you there... Herbert looks up from his booth, starts to ask where they're going...but they're gone. He turns back to the man he's talking to... INT. SONJI'S APARTMENT - WINDOW - NIGHT (1964) PULL BACK from being above Chicago in the winter at night to Ali and Sonji making love where Sheri's voice sings the second verse. To Ali's reactions... ALI I think I gonna keep you around forever, girl. SONJI (laughs) Well, I'm not too busy right now, so...I'll think on it. ALI Herbert said you weren't a Muslim. SONJI Cover my hair? No make-up? Long dresses? Honey, please. (beat) Were you a virgin? 40. ALI Why? SONJI (laughs) 'Cause you so \"gone\" off a little good time. ALI I'm no virgin...but I may as well be. (beat) I ain't jokin'! I always know when I know. See this face? I mean, you got a pretty face for a girl's face, but you ever seen somethin' as pretty as me? Now, you about five-foot-three...that's too small. But I overlook that, too, 'cause... SONJI (sarcastic) Thank you so much. ALI ...'cause of your spirit! SONJI My \"spirit\"...? ALI Yeah. 'Cause you too much fun! SONJI You serious? She raises his head next to hers, looks in his eyes. ALI But you gotta be a Muslim. SONJI Huh? How you do that? Step over a broom...shazaam...you a Muslim? She laughs.

My father will kill me. BUNDINI True love! Bundini cracks up. Ali signs without even glancing at the documents. Bingham notices this. BINGHAM Watch what you signing, Ali. HERBERT (to Bingham; sharp) Nothing to do with you. BINGHAM You talkin' to me, or someone walk inna room, fat boy? Anything's do to with me I think's to d-d-do with me...I'm st-st-still a Christian. ALI (signs anyway) And get me a kosher cook...lady who cooks at Malcolm's temple. Put my brother on the payroll. 50g a year for drivin' and jivin'. HERBERT Lana Shabazz... 42. ALI Yeah. How 'bout it, Howard. You be my official full-time photographer. BINGHAM I ain't goin' on your payroll. I like it freelance. Emphasis on \"free.\" As Ali signs the last of the contracts. HERBERT Muhammad. She's not...for you. When I met her, she was working at a cocktail lounge with a bunny tail on her backside. BUNDINI What were you doin' down at a cocktail lounge, Herbert? Sellin' \"Muhammad Peeks\"? Ali and Bingham crack up... HERBERT (to Bundini) Sober up and say something to this man, Bundini. You supposed to be his \"inspiration.\" BUNDINI (looks at Ali; to Ali, serious) I got to know about Sonji, Muhammad. She got a sister? (as Ali laughs) BINGHAM You been s-s-saving it up, training, Champ. You can't unleash it on this girl all sudden. You may kill her! Maybe you should spread it around more before you tie it down. ALI No. Marriage is the cornerstone of Muslim life. HERBERT Sonji Roi is not a Muslim! ALI She gonna be a Muslim, now! (flashes) So fix it up, Herbert. 43. INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - ALI past a speed bag onto Ali with Dundee + Sarria on the exercise table. They do NOT see, and we PASS them and other training boxers and MOVE IN to a portable B&W TV on top of a cabinet. ON B&W TV: MALCOLM X + MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. exchange greetings and introductions as if in a first-time meeting, and King turns back to CAMERA. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. (mid-statement) I fear if this bill is not passed... (beat) ...our nation is in for a dark night of social disruption. As an anchorman pontificates...IMAGE SUDDENLY BECOMES: FIVE DIFFERENT SURVEILLANCE ANGLES. King and Malcolm have no clue how extensive is the FBI Cointelpro surveillance and the operations mounted against them. And the image of the two of them becomes... INT. A COFFEE SHOP (WASHINGTON, D.C.) - THEIR PICTURE - SMILEY - DAY on the front page of the Washington Post. REVEAL Joseph 13X sitting next to JOE SMILEY in a small Washington, D.C. coffee shop. JOSEPH 13X Why we meeting? JOE SMILEY The idea was...to...make...Malcolm smaller, you know? Diminished; obscure? Not to turn him into a messiah. (the paper) What I got, now, is Malcolm shoulder to shoulder with Martin Luther King. (beat) And Malcolm running all over the world getting Ben Bella and Nasser to denounce racism in the U.S. while we're competing over there with the Soviets. (MORE) 44. JOE SMILEY (CONT'D) (droll) Not...a resounding success. We were better off before, with Malcolm INSIDE the Nation. (beat) So... We want you...to get Elijah Muhammad...to take Malcolm back. Joseph 13X stares at him, slack-jawed. Incredulous. No reaction. JOE SMILEY (CONT'D) That's a joke. I'm kidding! Don't you ever smile? Joseph 13X doesn't say anything. He does not smile. JOE SMILEY (CONT'D) We're on a timetable. Malcolm's pal, Quaison from Ghana, is introducing Malcolm's resolution to the General Assembly in Washington. That's in five weeks. Joseph 13X oddly gets up, moving a stool over... JOSEPH 13X You got bad breath, man. JOE SMILEY Thyroid. I got a stab wound in 1961. They took it out. We gotta talk about this guy, too. Smiley indicates the picture of Ali in \"Muhammad Speaks\" identifying him as a militant and a revolutionary.

Bundini and Cassius Clay, Sr. were laughing about something else. They got quiet. Bundini has a large water glass in his hand; Sr., a highball glass. 45. ALI (to Bundini) What you drinkin'? BUNDINI What am I drinkin'? Water's what I'm drinkin', champ! I'm a natural man... Ali goes to the bedroom door. ALI What's goin' on? We're late. He's dressed for an occasion. SONJI (V.O.) I'm changing my damn clothes! You didn't like what I was wearin'! As Ali re-enters the living room, there's a knock on the door...\"Room Service...\" BUNDINI Come on in...! (sees) What's that? ROOM SERVICE (with large glass) What you wanted, isn't it...a water glass with vodka...? BUNDINI That was before... ROOM SERVICE Before what? BUNDINI Before you showed up... And, now, Sonji comes out. This dress makes what she had been wearing look demure. Tight angora sweater and a miniskirt. She's Tina Turner 30 years ago. SONJI I fine runnin' around in all these cute short things for you. I submissive to you. But I ain't gonna be submissive to the Brother X's and what they think. They askin' me questions alla time anyway. 46. ALI What questions?! SONJI (V.O.) About you and us and I ain't tellin' 'em shit. CASSIUS CLAY, SR. (drunk) Tell it like it is, sugar! They took my boy's name...and what they give him back? Bad style. Ali takes her back into the bedroom and closes the door. SONJI I don't drink. I don't smoke. I converted to Islam for you and... INT. BEDROOM - SONJI + ALI - NIGHT SONJI All except the dress! I ain't puttin' no bleached-out, double- ugly bedsheets on this body, honey! I'm normal! He's furious. She smiles. He picks her up. She moans and her tongue darts in his ear and they're on the bed making out. And as CAMERA DRIFTS away we HEAR D.J. Daddio Daley's \"Jazz Patio\"... INT. A NEW CAR (CHICAGO) - ALI - DAY king of the city, cruising through the pristine winter air of Chicago... DADDIO (on radio) Hey there, old, aware ones. And you, too, my fair ones...This is \"Daddio's Jazz Patio.\" ON KBCA this fine day, which is A-okay... Segues to...Brubeck's \"Time Out,\" cruising... INT. THE AUDUBON BALLROOM, HARLEM - REAR OF MALCOLM'S HEAD - DAY center-punches the FRAME through the green-glazed terra- cotta hallway. He and his Bodyguard (#1) come to a door. Shedding his coat, he hesitates, and like a prizefighter gathering himself, he goes inside. 47. INT. ALI'S NEW CAR - ALI - DAY at a light, waves to a cluster of girls waiting for a bus who recognize him, go nuts...listening to Brubeck... INT. THE AUDUBON BALLROOM - MALCOLM - DAY walks across the stage, aware of every little sound, every motion. He makes his way to the podium...peering beyond his glasses at the gathered. Bodyguard #1 goes to the side door instead of standing next to him...and Malcolm notices that...as he... MALCOLM X As-Salaam Alaikum... THE GATHERED Wa-Alaikum-Salaam... And two young Black men, TALMADGE HAYER and NORMAN BUTLER immediately stand up in the back, jostling each other... A YOUNG MAN (shouts) What you doin' in my pockets, man? Get your hand outta my pocket! MALCOLM X Hold it, hold it, brothers! (pleading) Let's be cool. And the commotion in the back diverts Bodyguards #1 and #2 towards the rear, away from the stage and Malcolm, as... THOMAS JOHNSON comes forward from a front row, his coat flapping open, revealing the 12-gauge sawed-off double- barrel shotgun coming up. MALCOLM'S EYES go to it. Settle on it. He new it was coming, as... JOHNSON, an indifferent expression on his face, FIRES one barrel at... MALCOLM ...which rips through the lectern as if paper and SLAMS a dead-center into his chest a seven-ring. 12 pellets, each the size of .32 bullet. Seven destroy Malcolm's heart. Five shred his aorta and burrow into his spine. Malcolm's hands fly back, and he topples, crashing off empty chairs onto the floor. 48. UPSIDEDOWN ECU: MALCOLM'S FACE + PAST ...as life exhales from his mouth and his eyes go grey, dying, indifferent to Johnson emptying a second blast into him and the meaningless indignities of Hayer and Butler firing a .45 and a 9mm Luger at him. INT. ALI'S CAR - RADIO - DAY Dave Brubeck, loud... INT. THE AUDUBON BALLROOM - STAGE - DAY Chaos. Malcolm on the floor. Betty kneels over his body, desperately trying to breathe life into it. An Asian woman, a disciple, holds up his head. Somebody shouts, \"Jesus, God!\" But there is no God today... INT. ALI'S CAR - ALI - DAY stops short at a light because a man runs across the street. CRAZY MAN Ambushed! LOUD Brubeck in 5/4 time. Ali can't hear. CRAZY MAN (CONT'D) From the bullet holes, black eagles flew! They screaming through the streets... Ali rolls down the window. ALI What? CRAZY MAN (dazed) They killed Malcolm...they shot Malcolm. \"Daddio's Jazz Patio\" is interrupted. Malcolm X has been killed. Ali pulls over...not really parking. The world stops. The South Side of Chicago goes still...people numb...a young Man sitting down on the curb, crying. An elegy...Sam Cooke's \"A Change is Gonna Come...\" plays. \"I was born by a river in a little tent...\" And as Ali sits in his car...he sees the face of Malcolm...the glasses... 49. ALI (his thoughts) You were the first...you walked me forward, my brother...you were the first... He's overcome with a deep grief and a lack of confidence in the order of his world. SAM COOKE (sings) \"Been a long, long time comin', but a change gonna come, yes it is...\" INT. THE RING, ST. DOMINIC'S ARENA (LEWISTON, MAINE) - ALI - NIGHT HOWARD COSELL ...the arena is surrounded by FBI, the stands are only half full, the promoter has taken out a million- dollar insurance policy due to Cassius Clay's membership in the militant and radical Black Muslims because of death threats. Oh, and by the way...Sonny Liston is here, too. ...sees Sonji enter in a sequined mini-dress, bouffant hair. She attracts attention and disapproval from Herbert. She sits next to Ali's parents at ringside amid the large, conservatively dressed Muslim contingent. He's angry at her presentation. She looks like a girl singer from a doo-wop group. He slips off his robe. Ali raises his gloves in Muslim prayer. Meanwhile: the BELL rings. ALI meets Liston, nails him with a straight right. Ali begins baiting him, dancing. Liston tries to cut off the ring, jabbing ineffectually. Ali lets Liston in, pulls back, then pivots on his right foot, throws a short right and RAMP INTO SLO-MO...to see Liston not see it coming. The muscles of Ali's upper body contract and ripple in release after his short RIGHT catches Liston on the point of his chin. Liston drops to the canvas like a stone. HOWARD COSELL (CONT'D) Liston is down! Scarcely a minute into the first round, I can't believe it! Sonji is up. For some reason, tears of worry stream, absurdly, from her eyes. 50. The IMAGE: Ali standing over Liston, fist cocked, bellowing: ALI Get up, sucker! Get up and fight! No one gonna believe this! Liston tries to get up, rolls over. His left leg spasms. As the ref finally pushes Ali to a neutral corner. HOWARD COSELL It's over; it's over! INT. MUHAMMAD'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT Sarria, Bundini, Pacheco as Dundee cuts the tape off Muhammad's hands. And Sonji appears at the door...runs and embraces Ali. SONJI You okay? (he's cold) What's wrong? ALI Why you done up like that? SONJI I'm dyin' and...'cause this is how I dress! I dyin' for you out of worry... ALI \"Worry\"...? SONJI Yeah. And all you care about is if I look dull enough? ALI The world looks at me, girl! What if I straightened my hair, live in the white suburbs? How I am says something! SONJI (quiet; tough) Well, sorry you don't like how I am... EXT. HOLIDAY INN, BALCONY - ALI - NIGHT enters up the stairs. Bundini's waiting for him as are Reporters, trying to ambush him. Lots of activity in the motel forecourt. 51. ALI (to Bundini) Where's Herbert? Bundini indicates and Ali exits into Herbert's room. Beyond is the Holiday Inn marquee: \"Clay vs. Liston II.\" A few letters droop. EXT. HOLIDAY INN, HERBERT'S ROOM - ALI - NIGHT ALI What do I do...? Ali, angry, stands in front of Herbert. HERBERT If you want, have no contact with her for ninety days. Then you make a public statement of divorce in the mosque, and Islamic law will be satisfied. BUNDINI \"Satisfied?\"...satisfaction is not makin' it with the woman who send you to the moon? Cassius, Sr. bursts in. Bundini has Ali's championship belt over his shoulder. BUNDINI (CONT'D) Man, I'm the only normal person left around here and I'm a black Jew who can't read and is half drunk. CASSIUS CLAY, SR. I gotta talk to you. Bundini and Herbert start to leave. ALI Please stay, Brother Herbert. CASSIUS CLAY, SR. He ain't your brother! Your brother taking your wife back to Chicago. She's crying like a widow. ALI I ain't dead! CASSIUS CLAY, SR. You might as well be. You don't remember your name or who you are. 52. Cassius, Sr. leaves the room. INT. HOLIDAY INN, ALI'S MOTEL ROOM - HIGH ANGLE: ALI - NIGHT enters. Stands at the dresser. Only his suitcase is there. She left her chartreuse blouse. He takes it and smells the scent of her cologne. He is torn with grief at the loss of her, curling into a ball on the bed, alone in the room. INT. GREEN ROOM - ALI - DAY getting made up by a good-looking ASIAN COSMETOLOGIST. An ASSISTANT DIRECTOR lounges against the wall with headset, reading the newspaper... COSMETOLOGIST You got the prettiest eyes... ALI Yeah? BUNDINI He so pretty, when you look up \"pretty\" in the dictionary, he too pretty to be there. She laughs and whispers something in Ali's ear, holding his hand where the others can't see it and slips her phone number to him. Meanwhile...a phone rings. Bundini answers while... A.D. (re: newspaper, to Ali) ...you gonna try for Germany? ALI Huh? A.D. You gonna try to get stationed in Germany? ALI What you talking about? BUNDINI Champ. It's Eskridge... 53. A.D. (Ali didn't know) They changed your classification. (turns page) It's in the paper...You're 1-A. You're gonna get drafted into the Army... ALI (takes phone) You know about this? CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE (V.O.) Yes. But I think the government's looking to negotiate a deal... A.D. (hears on headset) Here we go...! INT. A NEW YORK TELEVISION STUDIO, ABC - COSELL - DAY \"Wide World of Sports\" is ON THE AIR. We've entered mid- broadcast. ALI ...I flunk their draft board test. Now, without testing if I am \"wiser\" or \"worser,\" they decide I can go into the Army. HOWARD COSELL Cassius, it is my opinion you... ALI (cuts in) And I'm not Cassius Clay. That's a slave name. I'm a free man. I'm Muhammad Ali. HOWARD COSELL (stops, realizing) You know, I apologize to you. On the air. Your name is Muhammad Ali. You have the right to be called whatever you want. ALI (stays angry) You make a lot of mistakes for a so-called educated man. You really go to law school? 54. HOWARD COSELL Yes, Muhammad. And to think I gave up a lucrative practice for the likes of you. ALI I'm the best thing that ever happened to you, Howard Cosell. Without me you be a tall white man with a microphone in his mouth. HOWARD COSELL (fast) And without me...you'd be a mouth. Ali lifts Howard's toupee. HOWARD COSELL (CONT'D) (into camera) We'll be right back. Laughter. INT. ABC TELEVISION STUDIO, BACKSTAGE - ALI + COSELL - LATER Ali pours three spoons of sugar in his coffee. HOWARD COSELL (sarcastic) Have a little coffee with your sugar...? ALI Keep talking. You were saying something half-smart... HOWARD COSELL They want to make an example out of you. ALI Why? I'm no Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown... HOWARD COSELL All they are is political. They tell people how they ought to be. But you are the HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION of the WORLD. You're important. And they don't like your militancy, your politics. So, they'll make an example out of you. 55. ALI ...of a good \"Ne-gro,\" who do what he told? HOWARD COSELL Yes. Or, to demonstrate here is what happens to your ass if you don't... He's screwed either way. EXT./INT. THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES STATION, HOUSTON - LOBBY - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE - DAY waits at the curb as Ali and Herbert pull up and get out of a car...move through the crowd...reporters shouting questions at him we don't hear, go up the steps, into the lobby, joining other recruits and M.P.'s. CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE (quietly) You do six weeks basic...you go into the Reserves...you don't go to Vietnam...you get to box...you even get to keep the money... He gives Ali a piece of paper signed by the Justice Department, confirming the deal... HERBERT (lets him know) The Messenger would not object if you joined under these terms. ALI I stay out of jail and I get to fight. HERBERT (nods) All you have to do is accept the induction. And life goes on. CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE They call your name. You say yes. We're not sure what Ali will do. INT. INDUCTION CENTER, HOUSTON - ALI - DAY lined up with the twenty-five other inductees...being addressed by an Induction Officer, Naval LT. JEROME CLARIDGE... 56. LT. JEROME CLARIDGE ...and you will take one step forward as your name and service are called, and such a step will constitute your induction into the Armed Force indicated. Lt. Claridge begins to read the names, and services...the young Men dutifully stepping forward. Ali expects his name to be called. Instead... LT. JEROME CLARIDGE (CONT'D) Cassius Marcellus Clay. It's quiet. Dead quiet. Ali's lips move. NO sound comes out. We anticipate him stepping forward...he doesn't. LT. JEROME CLARIDGE (CONT'D) Mr. Clay, I am required to inform you that refusal to accept a lawful induction order constitutes a felony under the Universal Military Training and Service Act, punishable by up to five years' imprisonment and a five-thousand-dollar fine. Do you understand? ALI (nods) Yes. TWO FBI AGENTS in suits have appeared. LT. JEROME CLARIDGE (repeats) Cassius Marcellus Clay. Ali doesn't move. LT. JEROME CLARIDGE (CONT'D) (a third time) Cassius Marcellus Clay. Herbert's dying. Ali \"stands his ground...\" and the die has been cast. A MAN (presenting badge) Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Clay, you're under arrest for refusing induction... As they turn around and handcuff him. 57. EXT. HOLIDAY INN (HOUSTON) - ALI + ENTOURAGE - LATE AFTERNOON approach from two vehicles. Rudy and SIX LARGE MUSLIMS escort Ali through the crowd of media trucks, reporters and conspicuous unmarked police cars and neighborhood people. ALI waves in Robert Lipsyte, the New York Times sportswriter in his late 20's we've seen before. He and Howard Bingham, waiting inside, know each other. They enter. The phone's already RINGING. INT. HOLIDAY INN ROOM + BALCONY - ALI on the phone, on a long extension, joined by Lipsyte and Howard Bingham, while Bundini keeps at bay reporters at the front door. It all feels like a rock group in town for a concert. ALI (listens; to cam.) Ask Chauncey Eskridge in Chicago. He's my lawyer. No. I'm out on bail. (goes onto balcony [rear shot]) Yeah, I fight. I fight clean. I'm an athlete. Army's there to kill, kill, kill. My religion forbids that. No. I never shot anything in my life. (turns) Do I know where Vietnam is? (wry; playing to Bingham) Yeah. It's on TV... (beat) In southeast Asia? It there, too? (beat) That's a joke, man...! Ali hangs up. The phone rings again. ALI (CONT'D) (frustrated) What do I think about who? Vietcong? Next is something Ali has not deduced. Ali perceives it intuitively and reflexively. As with other of his decisions, once made, he doesn't hesitate to speak them. And he won't waver. He says... 58. ALI (CONT'D) Man, I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong. It goes dead silent. Ali listens. Lipsyte is stunned. So's Howard. ALI (CONT'D) No Vietcong ever called me nigger. BINGHAM You know what you j-j-just said...? He hangs up. LIPSYTE From Europe to China...every home in America...the world's gonna know what the heavyweight champion of the world said about the U.S. war... ALI So what? (beat) I ain't gonna be what anybody else want me to be. I'm not afraid to be what I want. And think how I want. And that's the real Ali, right there. INT. HOLIDAY INN, ALI'S SUITE - ALI - NIGHT laying on the sofa. Dundee, Pacheco and Rudy have joined. There's the feeling the house is a bunker. Phones ring. Television is on. LIPSYTE, taking notes, watching Walter Cronkite on TV. He crosses to Ali. Dundee's on the phone. LIPSYTE (reading) Nixon, the Republicans, Boxing Commission in New York, Cleveland and L.A. (a foregone conclusion) But you're also getting attacked as unpatriotic by the NAACP, Roy Wilkins, Jackie Robinson, the New York Times and Joe Louis... The expression on Ali's face is blank, as if he's accepting a pounding: he knows what it is; it's not a surprise. 59. INT. GRANT PARK UNDERGROUND GARAGE - QUIET - NIGHT A very low ceiling; we're in a green-lit cavern with a low ceiling. Chauncey Eskridge and Ali wait. Ali's in the backseat of a 1961 Lincoln. Two FOI guards stationed at the distant ramps allow a Black Oldsmobile to pass. BOB ARUM a New York lawyer and promoter arrives and climbs out of the Oldsmobile. Ali opens the door...but doesn't get out... ALI (to Arum) People are following me... BOB ARUM I got almost nowhere I can promote a fight for you. Plus, I think they're going to vacate you from the crown. ALI What? BOB ARUM Yeah. If you're convicted. ALI They gonna take away what no fighter in the world can? BOB ARUM And New York may revoke your boxing license. CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE You sure you want to do all this? (politics) Your next three to four years are every heavyweight's prime. And there are few of those years... ALI What 'bout Terrell? BOB ARUM We'll know if we can fight Terrell in Illinois this afternoon. Terrell's running his mouth. He said if you're called, you should serve... 60. ALI (angrily) Motherfucker. He got a deferment for bein' too tall, or havin' flat feet. Why don't he serve for me? Tellin' me what I should do... BOB ARUM (to Ali + Eskridge) I got to get you some fights. Fast. Ali's quiet, not really listening anymore... INT. ILLINOIS BOXING COMMISSION - ALI - DAY wearing a suit and a narrow tie at a table in front of Daley machine apparatchiks. A bald man, angrily: COMMISSIONER You understand we could take away your license to fight Terrell in Illinois? ALI Yes. COMMISSIONER Are you prepared to apologize? About your unpatriotic remarks that you made? ALI Apologize? No. COMMISSIONER You said that you were the people's champion. ALI (angry) Yes, sir! COMMISSIONER Do you think you're acting like the people's champion...?! ALI Yes, sir. I am not going to apologize to you. This isn't a courtroom. And I don't have to sit here and answer your questions. Ali gets up and walks out on them. Eskridge and NOI men in black suits follow. 61. INT. CHICAGO OFFICE BUILDING - ALI + ENTOURAGE - DAY march through the lobby. Ali gives a walking interview. He's angry. He won't slow down. ALI I ain't draft dodgin'! I ain't goin' to Canada. I ain't burnin' my draft card. I ain't burnin' the flag. I'm stayin' right here. And you want to throw me in jail? Go ahead. I'll do my time. I been in jail four hundred years. I'll be in jail four, five more. But I ain't goin' ten thousand miles to help murder and kill poor people for you. 'Cause if I'm gonna die, I'll die now, right here, fighting you. If I wanna die. You my enemy, not Vietcong or Chinese or Japanese. You my opposer when I want freedom. You my opposer when I want justice. You my opposer when I want equality. You want me to go somewhere for you, but you won't even stand up for me in America, for my rights and beliefs, you won't even stand up for me here at home. INT. THE HOUSTON ASTRODOME - CLOSE: TERRELL - DAY ERNIE TERRELL is taller than Ali. The empty stadium has a scale and press at one end. Girls in cowboy hats and lone stars say we're in Texas. Ali is distracted. ERNIE TERRELL (getting on scale) Tell Clay he can get on after me. ALI What...? ERNIE TERRELL Get on the scale after... ALI (cuts in) What you call me...? Terrell wrongly thinks there's psychological value in provoking Ali. 62. ERNIE TERRELL Only thing I knows you as: Cassius Clay! ALI (infuriated) Announce it right here or from flat on your back! Ali throws a punch that doesn't land because he's separated. ALI (CONT'D) What's my name?!? CLOSE ON ALI something else in his eyes. INT. THE HOUSTON ASTRODOME - TERRELL - NIGHT hit FOUR TIMES by Ali: WHAM, WHAM, WHAM, WHAM! In the glaring lights... ALI What's my name, motherfucker?! And Ali flicks out punches...disorienting Terrell. The BELL. GIRL IN BANGLED MINISKIRT STARTS 15TH ROUND WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Ali hits him five times...Terrell ties him up. Ali throws him off, slips two jabs and snaps his left into Terrell's face. ALI (CONT'D) What's my name? Ali, at the apex of his athletic skills, fires six- or eight-punch combinations and then changes direction. Ali shoots jabs and hooks going backwards; every move and set of combinations is a dance. Ali's never been as light on his feet, as fast, as complex as in this fight. Like any moment of greatness, we want it to last forever... Then, Ali throws a 17-punch combination. ALI (CONT'D) WHAT'S MY NAME?! ...that burns down Terrell. Terrell starts to fall. Ali moves away. He doesn't want it to end. Sportswriters don't like it. Half the fans don't like it. Ali defies both their sensibilities and their politics. 63. TERRELL'S face is battered. Ali SLAMS in SHOTS. ALI (CONT'D) (shouted) My name?! WHAT'S MY NAME?! The BELL ends the savage pounding. Ali in the middle of the ring, glorying in opposition and triumph. INT. HOUSTON COURTROOM - ALI - DAY with Eskridge and his other attorneys. The courtroom's packed. In the back we spot Joe Smiley, anonymous in the crowd. ALI (to Judge) If the court would give me my sentence right now instead of waiting and stalling. JUDGE INGRAHAM (obliges) My pleasure. The jury has found you guilty of refusing induction into the United States armed forces. I sentence you to the maximum sentence allowable...five years' imprisonment and a fine of ten thousand dollars. (pause) Fast enough? Your attorney will lodge an appeal. While you're out on bond, I order your passport surrendered. I'll not have you benefitting yourself by fighting abroad... INT. HOUSTON COURT, FOYER - ALI - DAY on his way out of the building. Media is held at the other end. CLOSER - ALI looks dazed, not sure how to act on the way out of court. Oddly, he shakes hands with each of a half a dozen white Houston Bailiffs. It's as if, benumbed by the verdict, he seeks human contact. The only contact available, ironically, is with the officers of the court that just convicted him. 64. EXT. 79TH STREET, CHICAGO, 1968 - ALI - DUSK Time has passed. It's winter. Snow's on the ground. He's in a car coat and a hat with a hooded sweatshirt underneath. Street lights are on. Traffic's slight. He walks through the whiteness as new snow falls. ECU: ALI under the hat brim, his gaze is internal, as it was in the opening in Miami. BURNED-OUT STOREFRONT with icicles from Fire Dept. water. His work boots stop deep in the new falling snow...vanishing in the WHITEOUT... INT. N.O.I. BAKERY, CHICAGO - WHITE SILK SCARF - DAY (FLASHBACK) in Ali's hands. He leans across a white showcase of bakery goods. It's cold outside; warm inside. It smells of bread and coffee. BELINDA BOYD reacts. ALI Watch now... He makes a fist, balls the scarf up, and puts it in the hollow of his fist. ALI (CONT'D) (offering) Blow on it... She blows on it. She's not quite eighteen, six feet tall; there's a supremely confident expressiveness about her. Her gestures are large. He opens his hand. The scarf is gone. She instinctively looks over at his other hand. Nothing's there. His eyes go wide in mock fright at the mysterious. ALI (CONT'D) This spooky! Don't get scared... She laughs. How'd he do it? He makes a fist again, puts his thumb in the hollow. And slowly pulls the scarf out... BELINDA (laughs) See, you don't need to fight no more... He gives it to Belinda. She ties it around her neck. Ali looks at her. On a cold and dark afternoon, the windows are steamed and the bakery seems a fine refuge. 65. ALI So what's fresh, girl? BELINDA (smiles) Everything fresh! ALI (smiles) What's the freshest of the freshest? BELINDA (smiles) Doughnuts just came out... ALI (holds up the doughnut) Feed me those things, I gotta come back as a wrassler. (a ring announcer) 645 pounds. I'd still be pretty...but I be fat pretty... BELINDA You don't remember when you met me once before...long ago... ALI (joking) I remember something... Wha's your name? She slaps his arm. BELINDA You know my name! You came to my school, right before you win the title. Interviewed you for the school paper. I was eleven. ALI You had a long braid... BELINDA Yeah! You called me little Indian girl, then. ALI That was you? BELINDA I loved you then, like all those kids. I never stopped. I still do. 66. INT. NATION OF ISLAM ASSEMBLY - ALI + BELINDA - DAY (FLASHBACK) ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S VOICE (OVER) (finishes) The African-American Albert Speer-regimented seating breaks up. Ali's wearing a black suit, a white suit and white tie. As he drifts through the crowd, approaching him is Belinda in a white caftan and a white satin turban with gold earrings. It feels like they are an official couple, eugenically chosen mates. ECU: THEIR HANDS join. MACRO CU: SHOULDERS touch. She turns and leans back slightly against him... Their thighs touch. EXT. 79TH STREET, CHICAGO - DUSK INTO NIGHT We walk past the bakery. It's closed. Ali crosses the grey guttered street and exits into... INT. ALI'S SINCLAIR STATION, BACK OFFICE - ALI - NIGHT enters. CTA bus passes. Eskridge is there, waiting for him. Ali takes a coffee in a paper cup and grabs a Danish. ALI You see the Ellis-Quarry fight? CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE Yes... We'll be in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals next month. We'll lose. Then we appeal to the Supreme Court. ALI Ellis the champ? Man. I beatin' on him since we was sixteen. They give Ellis to Joe Frazier? Frazier'll kill him. Then they out of juice. Where's the gate? So they gotta let me fight. I fight Ellis in a phone booth...middle of Times Square...you think that draw a crowd? 67. CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE Draw a crowd or not draw a crowd, Muhammad, is NOT going to make a difference with your boxing licenses. They don't want you to fight. (so much for speculation) ACLU's handling your case against the New York Boxing Commission. They discovered New York's got actual ex-murderers and ex-rapists currently licensed to fight. But revoked yours...? ALI Tijuana? CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE No. State Department refused permission for the one-hour visa. No fight in Tijuana. Look... ALI Can't fight here. Can't fight outside the country... CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE I know people in the restaurant business...want to start up a chain. Muhammad Ali's \"Champ Burger\"...\"Muhammad Malts,\" \"Fist Full of Fries\"...all of that. They start out towards the gas pumps. ALI Why I want to be in the restaurant business?! CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE 'Cause you need the money. ALI How much all this gonna cost? CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE Too much. They do that to you, too, you know. They seek to destroy every facet of Ali's life. Ali knows that. As they pass the pumps. Some customers recognize him. CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE (CONT'D) Where you goin'? 68. ALI (to customers) Look out! CUSTOMER Hey, champ! And Ali pretends to start sparring. The working men laugh. One is brave enough to raise his hands, too. Ali smiles and trades a couple of phantom slaps. It breaks off. He made their day. He shakes each of their hands. His spirit's raised, he walks off. Chauncey watches this ritual... INT. CHICAGO APARTMENT, ALI + BELINDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT hands and skin and faces against white in bed. So close we are intimately inside the moment... ALI Not then... BELINDA First time? 1961...Sister Khalilah introduced you at assembly. You said you would be heavyweight champion of the world by the time you were twenty-one! ALI I always tell the truth... BELINDA I was eleven. I interviewed you for the student paper. You called me \"little Indian girl,\" 'cause I wore my hair real long, in a braid...I told you...\"Man, you scribble! You can't even write! You ought to go back to school until you do it better...\" Laughing, he starts poking her in the ribs, and she turns onto him. She's six feet tall, he's six-three. He grabs her wrist. She wrestles him down on the large bed until there's a NOISE, and Belinda separates from Ali and approaches a smaller bedroom to replace the bottle their daughter, MARYUM, threw out of her crib. As she exits, MOVE IN on the crib in streetlight and we HEAR Jimi Hendrix's bottleneck instrumental part of \"All Along the Watchtower.\" It makes us feel the child in the crib is threatened, and that takes us INTO... 69. INT. COLLEGE HALL - ALI in a black leather jacket with a white shirt and skinny tie, speaking to an audience of college students, white and black, some Asian and Latino. JIMI HENDRIX (from \"All Along the Watchtower\") \"There must be some kind of way outta here, said the joker to the thief...\" Bingham waits in the wings. Applause. Ali joins Howard and a small group watching a portable TV... TV: \"DAYS OF RAGE\" occurring on Chicago's North Clark Street. Off-screen we HEAR police sirens. On TV, Weathermen attack lines of Chicago police! The cops fall back. JIMI HENDRIX (CONT'D) \"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief. Business men, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth, None of them along the line, know what any of it is worth.\" INT. CHICAGO GYM - ALI - NIGHT trains in grey sweats to Hendrix. He flashes 60 sit-ups hanging off a table. He sweats profusely. He has no trainers. Bingham holds his legs. Ali seems heavier. The gym is grimy, filled with other boxers, a forest of heavy bags. Ali's one among other guys working out. ALI'S FACE grimacing through another set, trying to stay in shape, trying to retain skills going dormant. JIMI HENDRIX \"No reason to get excited, the thief, he kindly spoke. There are many here among us, who feel that life is but a joke.\" Then, he's slow on the heavy bag. Sparring alone in the ring... Everyone ignores him. 70. INT. ALI'S GAS STATION - ALI'S TV: NEWS - DAY REVEAL Ali + Bingham watching the 1968 Olympics. NOW, Tommy Smith and John Carlos bow their heads and raise fists in black power defiance, instead of acknowledging the national anthem. JIMI HENDRIX \"But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate. So let us not talk falsely now, the hour it's getting late...\" And the coverage cuts to George Foreman with a small American flag in his hand. Then, it flashes back to Ali in the ring with Sonny Liston at his feet. And Ali coming out of the Illinois Boxing Commission, angry. Dead Black Panthers, Fred Hampton and Matt Clark murdered by police in Chicago. And Malcolm X and Ali together. The meaning of it is clear: MUHAMMAD ALI IS THE WARRIOR SAINT IN THE REVOLT OF THE BLACK ATHLETE IN AMERICA. On Ali watching, as a phone rings... JIMI HENDRIX (CONT'D) \"All along the watchtower, princes kept the view, while all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.\" EXT. MEMPHIS MOTEL - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE - DAY speaks to Ali on a pay phone on ground level. CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE ...struck out at the appellate level in New Orleans. So we're heading back to the Supreme Court... INTERCUT WITH: INT. ALI'S GAS STATION - ALI - DAY ALI Thought we already got turned down there. 71. EXT. MEMPHIS MOTEL - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE I'm petitioning on a conscientious objection basis. Religious belief. We'll petition that your sincere religious belief prohibits you from shooting people. I believe they'll hear that... A fast car drives by, distracting Ali momentarily. Then, Ali focuses 100% on... ALI Where the money come from, Chauncey? Herbert tell me I'm runnin' on empty. Put aside \"how do that happen\"? Licenses all revoked. No passport. I can't fight here. Can't fight abroad. (beat) And what happen if I lose the Supreme Court? CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE It's all over. You go to jail for five years. There's no response from Ali. Ali hangs up, looks the other way, lost in thought. EXT. MEMPHIS MOTEL ROOM - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE - DAY hangs up the phone. Looks up. Starts to dial another number. A sound CRACKS OPEN THE NIGHT... Chauncey runs up the stairs to the second-floor balcony to join... EXT. MEMPHIS MOTEL, BALCONY - JESSE JACKSON - DAY cradling Martin Luther King, Jr. in his arms. People SCREAM. King involuntarily spasms. Under King, dark blood pools like crude oil. Eskridge, ANDREW YOUNG and JULIAN BOND point into the Memphis afternoon. EXT. ALI'S APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP (CHICAGO) - CITY AT NIGHT as if they were pointing at a burning fire, sirens, blue police flashers, an isolated gunshot. And REVEAL Ali on a rooftop, in sweatpants, sweatshirt, SHADOWBOXING while... 72. JIMI HENDRIX \"Outside in the cold distance, a wild cat did growl, two riders were approaching, and the wind began to HOWL!\" He leaves off to look into the distance. The agility, what he was with Terrell, isn't there. He exhales in time with punches HUH, HUH, HUH...Ali's struggling to hold onto diminishing sharpness. Police lights. Looting? He contemplates the fabric of the city ripping itself apart while... INT. JEFFREY STREET HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - FRAZIER RIPS APART ELLIS - NIGHT on ABC. REVEAL Ali with Maryum in his arms watches the fight...an activity from which Ali, the resident genius on the planet, is excluded. BINGHAM Ellis doesn't belong in there. ALI (curt) Man give him a shot, he took a shot. BINGHAM I saw Bundini in New York. ALI How's he? BINGHAM ...bad shape. You better get your belt b-b-back... Belinda brings coffee to Bingham... BELINDA (O.S.) She's got to be done with that bottle. BINGHAM You call your parents, Ali? BELINDA No, he didn't. I told them about the one on the way...myself. (moves to the kitchen) BINGHAM You p-p-p-promised you'd call them. 73. ALI I'll call 'em, I'll call 'em... (re: the baby) May-may! It go in one end and come out the other. BELINDA You wanna try changing her, for the experience? ALI You so much better at it, mama. Belinda takes Maryum. FRAZIER holds his arms up in victory, a formality of applause from the half-empty Garden. ALI (CONT'D) (to Maryum) Maaan...Joe Frazier can't talk, can't up the gate, can't fill the arena. They gotta let me fight. BELINDA That happen, you promise me you put some new people around you. Ali crosses to kitchen phone. ALI I need Angelo, Rudy, Ferdie -- BINGHAM Ali, she's talkin' about \"Brother\" Herbert. Ali stops. Between him and Belinda, this is important: her solidarity is with her husband, not with the NOI. BELINDA Where are they when we need them? You got Gene Kilroy droppin' off groceries like charity. Borrowin' money from my folks. So...? As Ali contemplates what she's said, we HEAR... HOWARD COSELL (V.O.) What are your feelings about up- and-coming Ken Norton? 74. INT. FRAZIER LOCKER ROOM (POST FIGHT) - COSELL + FRAZIER - NIGHT FRAZIER (still sweating) Norton's big and strong, but... Someone's talking into Howard's period headset. HOWARD COSELL (interrupting) Hold on one second...we have a caller. Go ahead. ALI (V.O.) (into phone) Cosell? This Muhammad Ali. A still photo of Ali in an iris appears superimposed on monitors. ALI (CONT'D) Go to Georgia or Alabama or Sweden. Everybody know I'm the champ. The crown is a lie. I know it's a lie. Joe Frazier know it's a lie. It time for everybody to stop lying and tell the truth. HOWARD COSELL Let's tell it like it is. With your court and boxing problems, Muhammad, can you get a fight promoted? ALI I ain't interested in the paycheck, I'd fight Joe Frazier for free in a phone booth in Times Square, if I wasn't broke. I still will. HOWARD COSELL Did you say you were broke? How can you be broke? Ali hesitates. INT. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT Elijah Muhammad reacts to the interview on television. There's a formality to Elijah Muhammad, even at his kitchen table. 75. HOWARD COSELL You've made more money than all previous heavyweight champions combined. What about your management? Surely they have provided for you... ALI I'm saying it's time for everybody to quit lying! Muhammad Ali is the champ! I have to, I'll get the fight on myself. (beat) And if they offer me money, I ain't gonna turn it down. CROSSCUT: Elijah turns to an aide. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD Get me my son, Herbert, on the telephone! INT. RUNDOWN CHICAGO GYM - ALI - DAY training. There is NO entourage with him. Ali hits the heavy bag. He doubles up the left jab on the taped-together heavy bag. Sweat stains his sweats. EXT. U.S. STEEL - ALI - DAY runs through tall reeds in the abandoned industrial landscape, ending at the lakefront and the cold, open sky and water. He's breathing hard, struggling against time to hold onto shape and prowess. He seems vulnerable against the open sky and water. INT. TEMPLE #2 - NIGHT Elijah Muhammad is at the lectern ringed by Fruit of Islam Guards. HERBERT is behind him. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD Mr. Muhammad Ali desires to do that which the Holy Qur'an teaches him against. I am, therefore, suspending Mr. Ali from the practice of Islam. He may no longer appear in temple, pray or teach, or have any conversation with any Muslim whatsoever. Furthermore...he may no longer use the name of Muhammad Ali. Henceforward, he will revert to his old slave name, Cassius Clay. 76. INT. JEFFREY ST. HOUSE, KITCHEN - ALI - DAY sits at the table. A deep vacancy is beginning to be there we've never seen before. May-may makes a mess. BELINDA Muhammad...? ALI You can't call me that no more. BELINDA Hell, I can't. I'm defying them by talking to you. And being with you. MOVE CLOSER and CLOSER into Ali's eyes. He's oblivious. Belinda's pregnant again. She says something to him. Ali can't hear. She says it again, louder. Ali doesn't look at her. OVER ALI onto the Formica table with Log Cabin syrup and powdered sugar and ceramic salt and pepper shakers SEEN in his ECU, disconnected, depressed, withdrawn... INT. FLOPHOUSE, FOYER - ALI + BINGHAM - DAY entering, concerned and urgent... ALI Whyn't you call an ambulance or a doctor? LANDLADY (following behind) Wouldn't let me. Said he knew you...and to call you, Mr. Ali... He's not been out for three days... Ali's up the stairs, down the corridor and takes the key from the lady and opens the door. It's a dump. Rotting food, something burned on the stove. On the floor, wrapped in a threadbare bedspread, half in and out of the bathroom, which is foul, is Bundini, sleeping off a drunk. BINGHAM Bundini! BUNDINI (opens his eyes; half sits) Watchu' doin' here? Gimme that short dog! Ali -- his concern crashes. He detests the type Bundini resembles. He throws a half-empty half-pint of Old Taylor against the wall. It splatters... 77. ALI What's wrong with you, man?! BUNDINI Nothin' wrong with me! Ali goes to the curtains and pulls them back. Bundini, blinded... BUNDINI (CONT'D) What that?!!! BINGHAM A mystery...d-d-d-daylight... BUNDINI (shielding his eyes) Leave me alone! ALI I leave you alone. You called me! BUNDINI That were a week ago... Ali grabs Bundini's arm and twists it and pushes his sleeve up. Bundini tries to pull his arm away. Ali is way stronger. Track marks up and down Bundini's arm. Ali slaps Bundini on the side of the head. SMACK! He slaps him again. SMACK! ALI What you shame yourself like this for, maaan...?! Why you shame yourself?! Bundini flails back with his arms. Ali leans in and SMACKS him again. BUNDINI Lemme alone! (shouts) I'm flyin'! The Sky Chief talk through me. I know the word! ALI You know \"low.\" You so low, the curb look like up! BUNDINI (demonstrates) Yeah? The king gotta go home to his throne! From the root to the fruit...! 78. ALI Those rhymes is old. Forget 'em. BUNDINI (demonstrates more) God don't care about you! Don't care about me! In all of everything, we mean nothin'. He don't know us. We be. And that's the onliest thing he did. And that's good 'cause that's why we free. But free ain't easy. Free is real. And realness is a motherfucker... (low; almost spooky) It eats raw meat. (beat) It walk in its own shoes. (beat) It does not waver... (pause) Yeah... There's a pause in the room. Bundini crashes. He starts crying, unabashedly... BUNDINI (CONT'D) I sold your belt for five hundred dollars to a barber on Lenox Avenue. That's how low I did you. I'm filled with weakness and got a crazy mind. That belt say you the Heavyweight Champion of the World. Five hundred dollars and I put it into my arm. That's what I called to tell you... Ali leans back against the wall...the last vestige, gone. BUNDINI (CONT'D) ...heard 'bout the Nation, all that court stuff. ALI (absent) Yeah. BUNDINI Forgive me, Muhammad. Take me back... ALI No. There's no \"back\" to take you to... 79. Ali gets up -- Bundini has been taken from him, too -- and leaves. INT. \"EL\" - ECU FRONTAL: ALI - NIGHT and beyond the side of Ali's face, elevated through the slums and decrepit tenements of the south side of Chicago...the mean alleys and decaying back porches. Men gathered around 50-gallon steel drums, burning wood for warmth. Everything is corrupted or has left him. FRONTAL: ALI staring into nowhere. REVERSE: PAST ALI The city recedes. Vectors, in perspective, carry structures, buildings away. The sky is grey, going to blue. The city flees and SUDDENLY disappears as we race into the dark tunnel of subway. Ali's lost in the depths of attempting a calculation. He can't do that for which he has a genius beyond other men... ALI (to himself) ...you can't do what you do best in the world. And how you feed your family? From prison? Who take care of your kids? And is Allah, is God with me? And he's been exiled from the belief system that explained the universe to him. SUDDENLY LIGHTS slash across his face in the white-tile North Avenue station. BEYOND, ghostlike working men and two heavyset women enter. Ali"
