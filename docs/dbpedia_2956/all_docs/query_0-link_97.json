        "text": "Biopics of popular music stars have become quite popular in the first decade of the twenty-first century, with a number of box-office successes and movie awards in the genre. In seemingly offering a glimpse of the ‘real story’ behind the star persona, biopics contribute to individual star images but they also reproduce broader narratives of popular music stardom. This paper offers a brief description of some of the central tropes of popular music stardom before detailing how they are reproduced in four recent biopics. Further, the paper also discusses the popular music biopic's ambiguous relationship to truth. On the one hand, the biopic must continually assert its truthfulness in order to gain the authority that a biopic needs to be believable and a source of audience pleasure. On the other hand, however, the biopic can never be a ‘real’ truth as it is constrained by both the conventions of cinematic realism and broader ideologies of popular music stardom. In its complicated merging of truth and fiction, we argue, the popular music biopic reflects the socially constructed nature of stardom more generally.\n\nThis thesis analyses the contemporary musical biopic (biographical film) examining theatrically released feature films from the years 2004 to 2007. Focusing on selected case studies, each chapter discusses the representation of actual musical artists including musicians, composers and singers. The musical biopics; El Cantante (2006), Control (2007), Beyond the Sea (2004), De-Lovely (2004), Walk the Line (2005), Ray (2004) and I’m Not There (2007) are analysed in depth. This thesis examines the text (the film itself) and context of the musical biopic. Through consideration of media representations of the respective music artists portrayed, the filmmakers and cast, significant factors are discussed including the omission and inclusion of certain biographical details, star/celebrity identities and cinematic elements such as visual imagery, narrative and musical integration; which shape the public perception of the persona. The musical biopic demonstrates that biography is a subjective interpretation of a life history. There can be no ‘truth’ or accurate re-telling of an actual life narrative. The contemporary musical biopic represents the public memory of the popular musical artist through exploring their various public/private identities, while focusing on a certain attribute or persona. The filmmaker unavoidably conveys a biased perspective of the protagonist, effectively re-interpreting and re-representing media sources. Through unique styles of depiction in musical integration, audio-visual representation, storyline and narrative, the contemporary musical biopic attempts to present an exclusive view of the popular music artist. Hence, the contemporary musical biopic re-mythologises the music artist, creating a fabricated account of a life history. Contributing predominantly to the discipline of film studies, this thesis is also significant to the areas of popular music studies, screen sound, biography and cultural studies. This thesis will draw attention to the undervalued scholarly study of the biopic, establishing new analytical tropes for further development in the field.\n\nMy graduate thesis published in 2015. In “These Colors Only Exist In Your Dreams; Hiphop, Music Video, and Racial Mythmaking.” I will attempt to explain how music videos are displays of sensuously rendered spectacle that communicates social and cultural ideals about blackness and whiteness. Because of this music videos are significant forces in the circulation of social and cultural ideologies that inform and are informed by America’s racial mythology. Through exploring historical practices such as minstrelsy and the coevolution of rap and music video in the late 1980s and early 1990s I will show that popular performance and entertainment in the United States has remained stratified along racial lines which in turn shape popular perceptions of racial identity. Through an examination of music video iconography, within the music genres of rap as well as alternative rock, I will show that a collection of specific symbols and objects have been effectively etched into America’s mainstream imagination. These objects and symbols, through repeated use, have come to be associated with ideals of whiteness and blackness. By the exploring the social and cultural context of these objects and symbols as well as tracking their movement across different cultural periods, I will scrutinize the ways in which Black and White rap artists are visualized in a Black coded musical space that is drastically shifting. Clearly defining what these visualizations signify sheds lights on current notions on how and what Black and White bodies should perform.\n\nThis article analyzes a jazz trope that appeared in literature, film, and journalism from the 1930s to the early 1960s. It shows how the distinct symbolic order and moral boundaries of these cultural fields shaped a “story of jazz” that acted as a metaphor for class, race, and urban America. The jazz trope represented a double consciousness of romantic rebellion and dangerous deviancy in which the story of jazz almost always ended in tragic consequences. The ultimate tragedy of the jazz life in the popular imagination acted to reaffirm dominant norms against a rebellious and deviant world in urban America."
