        "text": "Featured\n\nAfong Moy\n\nAfong Moy (c. 1817 â€“ unknown) was brought to the United States by New York City merchants in 1834 to present and sell their wares at an orientalized salon. As the first recognized Chinese woman in America, she became a national media sensation and touring attraction. But she did not choose this role; it was forced upon her by circumstances beyond her power. She had no control over how she was portrayed. Her managers presented, through her image, a frequently distorted view of China, its objects, and its people. While some Americans gained firsthand information about China and the Chinese from her performances, others were merely titillated by her bound feet, exotic staging, and presence."
