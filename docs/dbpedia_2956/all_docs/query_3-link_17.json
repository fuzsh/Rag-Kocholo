        "text": "From James Marsh's The Theory of Everything to Bryan Singer's Bohemian Rhapsody, the last few years have seen a real surge of biopics.\n\nAnd there's more to come. Amy Winehouse's biopic Back to Black will be released in April 2024, and director Sam Mendes has announced he plans to make not one but four biopics about The Beatles, one for each member of the band.\n\nSo there's no shortage of them, but what counts as a biopic? We answer some popular questions about this film genre.\n\n1. How do you pronounce biopic, and what does it mean?\n\nBiopic is short for âbiographical pictureâ, where 'picture' is an old-fashioned word for a film or movie. Itâs pronounced bio (that's b-eye-o)-pic.\n\nBiopics are a genre of film that tell the story of a single, real personâs life - or at least a part of that life that is historically important or interesting.\n\nBiopics have often been made about well known historical figures. Recent examples include director Christopher Nolanâs Oppenheimer (2023) about the inventor of the atomic bomb, or Elvis (2022) about the life and career of Elvis Presley.\n\nBut sometimes theyâre made about ordinary people whose lives were interesting, important or dramatic in some way. For instance, A Beautiful Mind (2001) starred Russell Crowe as brilliant mathematician John Nash, who developed schizophrenia soon after publishing some of his breakthrough works.\n\n2. What was the first biopic?\n\nBiopics go right back to the beginnings of cinema. The first movie audiences were understandably fascinated with the idea of seeing historical figures, who they could only previously read about or see in paintings, brought to life. One of the earliest films ever made, Joan Of Arc directed by Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s (1900), was a biopic.\n\nOther famous biopics from movie history include Abel Glance's Napoleon, The Diary Of Anne Frank by director George Stevens (1959) and David Lean's Lawrence Of Arabia (1962).\n\nMore recent successful biopics include Bradley Cooper's Maestro, about the life of composer Leonard Bernstein (2023), and Terence Davisâs Benediction (2021) about the life of war-poet Siegfried Sassoon.\n\n3. Whatâs the difference between a biopic and a historical drama?\n\nThe categories often blur into each other, but itâs really all about the main subject of the film. A biopic is about a person, while a historical drama is generally about an event or period in history.\n\nSo, to take a couple of recent examples, while Martin Scorseseâs The Killers Of The Flower Moon features real historical figures, it focuses on an event (the murders of the Osage tribe of Native Americans in 1920s Oklahoma) rather than any single life, and so is best described as a historical drama.\n\nRidley Scottâs Napoleon, on the other hand, is all about the the French leader's rise to power, so most people would call it a biopic.\n\nEqually Spike Leeâs Malcolm X (1992) is all about the life of the civil rights leader, and so is considered a biopic. Selma (2014) mainly focuses on the civil rights marches of the 1960s, and so some would argue it's a historical drama.\n\n4. Whatâs the difference between a biopic and a docudrama?\n\nMuddying the water a bit is the term âdocudramaâ. Itâs most often used about TV programmes rather than cinema, but occasionally it's applied to movies as well.\n\nDocudramas use actors and dramatic techniques to tell the story of real, usually contemporary events. A recent example is ITV's Mr Bates vs The Post Office (2023) which covered the Post Office scandal and subsequent fight for justice for those involved.\n\nA docudrama might focus on a character like sub-postmaster Alan Bates, but it wouldnât be called a biopic because the real subject isnât their whole life but a specific thing that happened to them, and which affected lots of other people too.\n\nAnd itâs not a historical drama, because the events are too recent.\n\nSometimes the line between docudrama, historical drama and biopic is quite thin, and you could argue for any of the descriptions.\n\n5. Are biopics always accurate?\n\nNo. A biopic has to fit a whole life, or a big part of one, into a single film. So, inevitably, huge amounts are left out. Sometimes screenwriters may choose to re-arrange the order of events to make things clearer. Fictional characters are sometimes invented to smooth the story out, or real characters are merged together - these are called âcomposite charactersâ.\n\nAnd, of course, sometimes the exact historical facts about someone's life are unknown or disputed. For instance Amadeus (1984), Milos Foremanâs biopic of Mozart, was criticised for exaggerating the rivalry between Mozart and fellow composer Salieri. And The Greatest Showman (2017), which was about the life of circus impresario P.T. Barnum, controversially omitted his use of enslaved people in his shows.\n\nSo while a biopic is a great way to get into a subject, they are not always reliable sources of historical fact."
