        "text": "Biographies ,Christian movies spotlighting the lives of some of the most influential people to have ever lived\n\nWelcome to the biographies section of FishFlix.com! We’ve put this section together especially to spotlight some of the greatest Christian people to have ever lived. In this section you will find over 75 DVDs featuring movies that take close looks at some influential Christian people who have lived over the years. You will find the stories of more recent people like C.S. Lewis and Billy Graham, but you will also learn more about people who lived long ago. We hope these movies can be a great encouragement to you as you learn about some of the amazing people who worked to make a true difference in their world. There have been some incredible Christian influences over the years and many people’s lives have been touched or forever changed by the influences of these Christian people in their lives.\n\nWe’re so excited that we get to serve you in this area, and we hope that these Christian movies can be a true encouragement to you in your faith. If you’ve ever wanted to learn more about some of the great lives that have made a difference in our world, this is the place to start. As you learn about these missionaries, nurses, and teachers who made a difference in the world, we hope you’ll also be inspired to make a difference in our world today. It’s easy to forget that we could become just like these people that we honor in biography movies. Someday, more biography films will be made spotlighting some of the great lives of our current time. And what if we choose to make a difference like the people in these movies? There are some truly inspirational stories in these films and they can be a real encouragement to us as we walk in our faith.\n\nThrough these films, you can learn about people who chose to give all and chose to give everything they had to serve God. Some were able to minister from where they lived, but others chose to give up everything they had and leave home to a place they felt called. These places were not always comfortable or enjoyable. Sometimes, it meant risking or even giving their lives just to further the cause of Christ. And the incredible thing is that these people were willing to do it. They didn’t hold back or try to avoid what they felt called to do. They simply felt the call from God and used their gifts to further the kingdom. Some were able to bring physical healing to areas that would otherwise never have had it. Others were able to evangelize to places that would never have heard God’s call. No matter what they were doing, they were doing something that would serve God and further the kingdom.\n\nChristian movies can be a great way to find out more about the lives of those who came before. They make a very perfect venue to produce biopics and documentaries about the lives of some of the most incredible Christian men and women to have ever lived. Because of this format, Christian films can be a fantastic way to learn more about Christians and learn how we can be inspired to make a difference in our world today. Remember that our world still needs people like those in these movies to make a difference in our world. Possibly now more than ever do we need good Christian men and women to go into all of the world and continue making disciples of all nations.\n\nWhen Jesus came down to earth, he left an incredible ministry behind and he would encourage people two thousand years later to continue making a difference in his name. That’s the amazing thing about Christianity and faith. It’s continued to make a difference in our world thousands of years after Jesus’ death. Although Jesus is no longer here on earth in his physical form ministering and teaching, his ministry is still being taught through his vessels; people who felt called to preach his word to the masses. Jesus gave us a call at the end of his ministry before ascending into heaven. We can read about it in Matthew 28, where he tells us that we are to go into all of the world and make disciples of all the nations. It’s a simple call, but it has some life-changing ramifications. It means devoting our lives to furthering his kingdom and trying to bring as many people to God as we can during our limited time here on earth. Some people took this call incredibly seriously and chose to do everything they could to give their lives over to Christ.\n\nThese films make for great family movie nights as they can help your family come to understand the importance of living our lives for God. In the end, the very most important thing is to follow Christ wholeheartedly and do what he calls us to do. And if that means giving everything a following him, that’s what we should do. We love families and know the importance of spending time together. This can be a great way for families to come together and watch a family-friendly movie together. The problem with many movie theaters today is their inappropriate content and off-color humor. It’s getting increasingly difficult to take our children to the movies as they continue to have mindless or even inappropriate content.\n\nThat’s the great thing about these Christian movies is that they can help you build your faith and encourage you in your Christianity. Rather than feeling torn down or discouraged, these movies feature uplifting stories of those who were willing to give everything they had to serve God. Whether you’re feeling called into ministry, or you’re simply looking to learn more about a certain historical figure, these films can be a great resource for you. Perfect for small groups, churches, and even homeschooling, the Christian biography movies can be a powerful way for you to learn more about Christians from history. We hope these films can be a true encouragement to you in your faith."
