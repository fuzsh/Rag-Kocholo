        "text": "I took the very unscientific approach of using Wikipedia and their List of biographical films. I then put all the information into a spreadsheet, removed a lot of annoying merged cells and came up with a list and turned this into a hopefully pretty graph:\n\nUsing this, and ignoring non 20th/21st century people, it looks like Adolf Hitler and Albert Schweitzer lead the way with seven films each.\n\nOf course, Wikipedia's list of biographical films can be edited by anyone and is in no way definitive - but I can't find any other list on the Internet tracking it. Interestingly, they had just three films for Steve Jobs (as out of the six films created about him, they considered three biographical and three documentaries.\n\nThere are literally dozens of movies about Wong Fei-hung, who died in 1924 and therefore qualifies for your time range. Granted, most of those movies aren't well-known outside China / Hong Kong.\n\nAnd you might want to make a very close inspection before declaring that e.g. Iron Monkey (1993) is a \"biographical\" account of his childhood! So not all of them qualify as biographies. I think you'd be able to find almost a continuum from \"sincere attempt to recount events that actually occurred\" to \"complete fiction that just uses his name\", and draw the line where you want within that."
