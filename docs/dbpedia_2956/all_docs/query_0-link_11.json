Clays work ethic was apparent even in the early years of his life. As a child, he raced the school bus to school each morning. His friends would wave to him as the lead fluctuated based on the school bus’ stops. This work ethic extended to the classroom. Because of a learning disability, Clay had to work extra hard in school to not fall behind. Clay grew up with racial segregation all around him. These injustices sparked a passion in him to change the way people viewed African Americans: “I wanted to show that color didn’t matter”(Muhammad Ali: An American Legend). Clay’s boxing career began because of an incident when he was 12 years old. He and a friend rode their bikes to the Columbia Auditorium for The Louisville Home Show.

At the time of Ali's fighting, the United States were involved in the Vietnam War. As a result, young Americans were been drafted to serve in the military. When political figures saw Ali fighting, they decided to stop the hurting of our own and draft him, so he hurts the people in Vietnam. Ali was not pleased with this decision, because ha had just won the Heavyweight Championship and because he said, \"I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong\"(Hauser 144). His final decision on the issue was that he would not go to war. He was not willing to go and kill people, while his own are in bad conditions at home. In the same way, he was forced to decide if he wanted to become a billionaire and sell his people, or to become poor and not sell his people (185). For this rebel action, his Heavyweight Title was taken away and he was put in jail. This did not matter to him because he h!ad followed his beliefs and obeyed\n\nClay’s fighting technique was far different than that of the other heavyweights at the time, he moved quickly and refused to set in a position. At the time this was seen as almost cowardly – he couldn’t handle a punch and his hits were soft blows. This philosophy all changed after Clay decided to fight the World Champion at the time, Sonny Liston. Cassius Clay somehow pulled off one of the greatest upsets in boxing history by defeating Liston in the seventh round. Afterword’s his name was changed to Muhammad Ali. Muhammad means “worthy of all praise” while Ali means “most high”. Muhammad Ali’s name wasn’t the only aspect that people used to deify him.
