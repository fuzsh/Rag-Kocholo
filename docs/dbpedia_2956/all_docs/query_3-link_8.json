        "text": "The year 2023 saw an increase in the release of biographical films (biopic), which dramatize the lives of historical figures ranging from beloved artists to the creator of the atomic bomb. However, the rise of biographical films has been met with widespread criticism, with most films, with the exception of Christopher Nolan’s Oscar-nominated “Oppenheimer,” underperforming at the box office. With more biopics set to be released in 2024, the popularity of the genre is called into question, particularly in light of debates regarding accuracy and exploitation. This trend raises concerns regarding originality, representation, and the risk of oversimplification.\n\nIn an era dominated by biographical films, audiences are bombarded with stories of historical figures and celebrities. “Priscilla,” “Iron Claw,” “The Boys in the Boat,” “Ferrari,” “Maestro” and “Napoleon” are some of the biographical pictures that hit cinemas in 2023. While these cinematic portrayals offer a glimpse into the lives of extraordinary individuals, there is a growing sentiment that the genre has become stale and formulaic, leaving viewers craving originality.\n\nAdditionally, the monetization of real-life tragedies or triumphs for entertainment purposes can be seen as exploitative or insensitive, especially when the subjects or their families are still alive. In the pursuit of profit, filmmakers may sensationalize or romanticize real people’s struggles.\n\nBalancing historical accuracy with cinematic storytelling is a delicate task. Filmmakers often take creative liberties to improve the story or make it more appealing to audiences. This can lead to historical inaccuracies that misrepresent the lives of the individuals being depicted. Filmmakers often wield significant influence over the representation of real people, affecting public opinions and potentially altering historical records.\n\nThe appeal of biopics is undeniable. They provide an opportunity to dig into the lives of interesting personalities, exploring their accomplishments, struggles, and complexity. Biopics have long fascinated viewers with captivating storylines about legendary figures like Elvis Presley and Bob Marley, as well as prominent leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nHowever, moviegoers have grown tired of biographical films. Many biopics follow a predictable formula, depicting their subjects’ rise to fame, inevitable struggles and the eventual victory or downfall. This formulaic approach might lead to a lack of surprise or emotional impact since audiences are already aware of the story’s beats before they appear on screen.\n\nAudiences are craving diversity and creativity in their cinematic experiences. They want to be challenged, surprised and moved by stories that defy convention. While biopics can provide valuable insights into the human experience, they should not dominate the landscape at the expense of other genres and stories.\n\nIt is time for filmmakers to break away from the constraints of conventional storytelling and explore new approaches to biographical cinema. This might include experimenting with unconventional story structures, focusing on overlooked historical figures or using elements of fiction to breathe new life into familiar stories."
