        "text": "Rahaman Ali had a ringside seat for nearly all of his brother’s life…Yet despite the sheer volume of Ali books, Rahaman Ali succeeds in telling us things we didn’t already know about his brother, a man the Guinness Book of World Records decided in 1980 had surpassed Lincoln, Napoleon and Jesus Christ to become the most written-about figure in human history.\n\n— USA Today\n\nArguably no one knew Muhammad Ali better than his brother, as Rahaman Ali proves in this astute account of the world boxing champion’s life . . . instead of milking the Champ’s well-worn myth and hype, Ali offers an intimate, bittersweet remembrance. This is a great addition to the literature about one of the 20th century’s towering figures.\n\n— Publishers Weekly\n\n[Ali and Rafiq] present intimate memories of an infamous man. Muhammad Ali’s childhood in Louisville, KY; boxing career; Muslim faith; and years in retirement are all described fully, as are the many myths and legends surrounding him—some confirmed, others debunked. Of special interest is a thorough account of Ali’s reaction to being drafted during the Vietnam War, a provocative stand that brought him further into mainstream culture. The lifelong connection between the two brothers allows the author to differentiate between Ali’s private and public personas. His exclusive observations make this an important account of Ali’s life for fans of “The Greatest,” and all readers who want to learn more about one of the 20th century’s most successful, polarizing, and, ultimately, beloved public figures. ­VERDICT The only sibling of Ali brings us into the boxer’s inner circle with warmth and ease.\n\n— Library Journal\n\nThere's no man like Muhammad Ali. Everything we have he supersedes us in... Rahaman, at last, has written the definitive biography on his late brother, which tells the real Ali story by a close family member.\n\n— Mike Tyson\n\nThe real life of the Great One. A real biography about Muhammad Ali by the man who knew him more/longer than anyone else... the man Ali loved more than himself, his brother.\n\n— George Foreman\n\nHeart-warming, multi-faceted and hard-hitting. Thanks to Rahaman's powerful storytelling ability, My Brother, Muhammad Ali shares with the world a tale unlike any other biography on Muhammad Ali.\n\n— Fox Sports\n\nNo one knew Muhammad Ali better than Rahaman, and he provides a welcome and insightful addition to the extensive Ali literature.\n\n— Sunday Times\n\nRahaman was alongside Muhammad Ali all the way, from his street-fighting teenage days, loving home life, soaring fame, marriages, troubles, notoriety, highs and lows. In this long-overdue book, he takes us inside the legend's head and home. And just like the man, the book never stops surprising. A must for fight fans.\n\n— Sunday Sport\n\nFrom the foreword: I’ve known Rahaman personally for over five and a half decades. I don’t think there’s anyone who was closer to Muhammad than his own brother. I am delighted that Rahaman has written the definitive biography on his brother Muhammad Ali, who was more than merely the most fascinating sporting figure of modern times. He was a lover of human beings, a warrior for the fight against discrimination, and not only did this great heavyweight champion transcend boxing, but he transcended all sports. The Muhammad Ali story is an important part of history, and I can say, with great conviction, that his legacy will live on for a very long time . . . hopefully forever.\n\n— Jim Brown, NFL Legend"
