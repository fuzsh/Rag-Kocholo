        "text": "Ranked By\n\n59.4K votes\n\n4.8K voters\n\nEvery awards season it seems countless new biopics are released about notable historical figures, celebrities, and politicians. You would think that nearly every huge figure in history had their own biographical film by now (there's even one about Howard Stern), but you would be wrong. There are lots of important artists, scientists, musicians, and other famous people who have not yet gotten the Hollywood treatment in the form of a biopic.\n\nThere are loads of untapped stories for Hollywood to cash in on. Sure, the Oskar Schindlers, the Muhammad Alis, the Abraham Lincolns, and the Ray Charleses of history have had their day in the sun, but there is still a surprising number of people whose lives have not yet been immortalized on film.\n\nThe real question - what make's a good story for a biopic? Adventure? Laughter? Tears? Violence? Heroism? Sex? The best biopics feature one or more of these and are about famous people we all know, but are interested in knowing better. So who else do you want to see a biopic movie about?\n\nUpvote the most interesting people below who you think should have a biopic made about their life? Have a biopic candidate in mind who isn't listed? Add him or her below, and be sure to tell us what makes them interesting and who should play them (both the dream casting choice, and the person Hollywood would most likely cast).\n\n1\n\n1,000 VOTES\n\nThere's no question. This dude was smart... and weird. He developed the theory of relativity, but get this - he also married his first cousin! The wigs alone will win an Academy Award.\n\nAge : Dec. at 76 (1879-1955)\n\nBirthplace : Ulm, Germany\n\n1,000 votes\n\n2\n\n830 VOTES\n\nBelieve it or not, Ol' Blue Eyes has never gotten his own biopic (though Martin Scorsese claims to have been working on one for years). Sinatra's involvement with women, Hollywood, and the mob would make for a rich flick.\n\nAge : Dec. at 82 (1915-1998)\n\nBirthplace : Hoboken, New Jersey, USA\n\n3\n\n903 VOTES\n\nBob Ross\n\nThe man, the myth, the legend. Bob Ross hooked an entire generation on painting trees and mountains via his PBS TV show. But who was Bob Ross really? Behind that soft voice was an Air Force hero who battled lymphoma, forcing his retirement.\n\nAge : Dec. at 52 (1942-1995)\n\nBirthplace : Daytona Beach, Florida, USA\n\n4\n\n554 VOTES\n\nThe first woman to win the Nobel Prize, Curie is perhaps most well known for her discovery of radium. Yes, she actually discovered an element. Unfortunately, she died of radiation poisoning. Who could have seen that coming?\n\nFilm: Radioactive (2019)\n\nAge : Dec. at 66 (1867-1934)\n\nBirthplace : Warsaw, Poland\n\n5\n\n743 VOTES\n\nHe cut off his own ear! It's the part of a lifetime! Vincent van Gogh was the definition of a tortured artist. The painter suffered from mental illness, anxiety attacks and took his own life at the age of 37. It's the stuff biopic dreams are made of.\n\nFilm: At Eternity's Gate (2018)\n\nAge : Dec. at 37 (1853-1890)\n\nBirthplace : Zundert, Netherlands\n\n6\n\n498 VOTES\n\nFilm: Stardust (2020)\n\nDavid Bowie, born David Robert Jones, was an iconic figure in the world of music, renowned for his distinctive voice, eclectic musical style, and innovative approach to artistry. Born on January 8, 1947, in Brixton, London, England, Bowie's passion for music began at a young age. His early influences included Little Richard, Elvis Presley, and the jazz records played by his father. Known for his continuous reinvention, Bowie's career spanned over five decades, during which he released 27 studio albums. Bowie's breakthrough came in 1969 with his single Space Oddity, timed with the Apollo 11 moon landing. His versatility was showcased in his album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars that introduced the alter ego Ziggy Stardust, a character that personified alienation and glam rock. This was followed by a series of successful albums including Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs, and the soul-influenced Young Americans. In the late 1970s, Bowie moved towards electronic and ambient music with his Berlin Trilogy: Low, Heroes, and Lodger. Aside from music, Bowie also had a significant impact on fashion and theater. He was known for his androgynous looks and flamboyant stage outfits, influencing trends throughout his career. He also acted in films like The Man Who Fell to Earth and Labyrinth, proving his talent across multiple artistic mediums. Bowie passed away on January 10, 2016, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire musicians and artists worldwide. His innovative approach to music and his ability to constantly reinvent himself have solidified his place as one of the most influential figures in popular culture.\n\nAge : Dec. at 69 (1947-2016)\n\nBirthplace : London, England, UK"
