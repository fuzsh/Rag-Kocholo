        "text": "“Bohemian Rhapsody” (2018)\n\nBrian Singer’s Freddie Mercury movie was a massive hit, winning four Oscars and briefly turning classic rock biopics into Hollywood’s hottest subgenre. But diehard fans of the band were appalled by the film’s many historical inaccuracies and rearranging of events, with some even suggesting that its portrayal of Mercury’s sexuality and AIDS diagnosis bordered on irresponsible. Many were also stunned by the film’s Oscar win for Best Film Editing, with several strangely-edited clips from the film going viral shortly after its win.\n\n“Richard Jewell” (2019)\n\nMany critics regard “Richard Jewell” as a solid entry in Clint Eastwood’s late-career oeuvre, but the film attracted controversy for the way it portrayed Atlanta journalist Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde). The former Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter, who died of a drug overdose before the film was made, is seen offering to trade sexual favors for classified information, an event that everyone involved with the story has firmly denied. While some (including Wilde) defended the choice as an artistically beneficial element of the storyline, the decision to damage the reputation of a real person who was not alive to defend herself left a bad taste in the mouths of many viewers.\n\n“House of Gucci” (2021)\n\nTo tell the story of the infamous family drama surrounding the legendary fashion brand Gucci, Ridley Scott enlisted an all-star ensemble cast that would make any director jealous. The swarm of A-listers on the call sheet led to insanely high expectations for the film, and while it was far from a bomb, it didn’t quite live up to the hype either. The quality of the performances varied, with Adam Driver and Lady Gaga earning critical acclaim and Al Pacino and Jared Leto devolving into cartoonish caricatures.\n\n“American Sniper” (2014)\n\nClint Eastwood’s “American Sniper” briefly became a bona fide cultural phenomenon in late 2014, earning over $500 million at the box office and picking up six Oscar nominations. But while the film, which tells the story of Chris Kyle, the most lethal sniper in American military history, was able to reach an audience that often avoids going to the movies, it wasn’t for everyone. Many critics accused the film of ignoring complicated moral questions and glorifying the Iraq War. Also, that prop baby did not help anything…\n\n“Snowden” (2015)\n\nOliver Stone has been known to take a fair amount of artistic license in his historical dramas, and his Edward Snowden biopic drew criticism from both supporters and critics of the famous whistleblower. While Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s performance as Snowden earned near-universal acclaim, Stone’s attempts to reimagine the nerdy intellectual into an action hero left many feeling like the biographical film left much to be desired.\n\n“All Eyez on Me” (2017)\n\nSometimes, a biopic is controversial just because people idolize the person it portrays and despise the fact that it came up short. That appeared to be the case with “All Eyez on Me,” Benny Boom’s critically panned Tupac Shakur biopic that starred Demetrius Shipp Jr. as the legendary rapper. The film was never able to come close to capturing the magic of successful hip-hop films like “Straight Outta Compton” and “8 Mile,” and Jada Pinkett Smith accused the film of getting many details about her relationship with Shakur wrong.\n\n“Jobs” (2013)\n\nShortly after Steve Jobs’ death in 2011, two competing films about his life were quickly announced. One was “Steve Jobs,” Danny Boyle’s Aaron Sorkin-scripted film that told the story of Jobs’ career in three long scenes, each taking place on the day of an important product launch. That film is a modern classic, a clever riff on the biopic genre that boasts a stellar performance from Michael Fassbender in the lead role. The other film was “Jobs,” Joshua Michael Stern’s much more conventional life that starred Ashton Kutcher as the Apple co-founder. While the physical resemblance between Kutcher and Jobs was obvious, the “Two and a Half” men star lacked the acting chops for the role and “Jobs” remains firmly in the shadow of Boyle’s superior film.\n\n“Aline” (2020)\n\nValérie Lemercier’s unauthorized take on Celine Dion’s life is a rare example of a controversial biopic that turned out far better than its detractors expected. Lemercier plays Aline Dieu, a fictionalized version of the Canadian music star, from childhood all the way through middle age, a strange choice that seemed doomed to fail on paper. But the film was a crowd pleasing hit when it premiered at Cannes in 2021, overcoming its strangeness to become something truly unique. It’s not a film for everyone, and it never reaches the highs of the best music biopics, but it’s a fitting tribute to Dion’s legacy.\n\n“Alexander” (2004)\n\nOliver Stone’s Alexander the Great biopic was almost universally panned, with many critics citing its excessive use of narration and the strange casting of Colin Farrell as the Macedonian king as unforgiveable sins. While three subsequent director’s cuts of the film have been released on home video and slightly improved its legacy, “Alexander” is still a crash course in what not to do when making a film about an iconic historical figure.\n\n“J. Edgar” (2011)\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover is one of the more complicated figures in American history, serving as FBI director for 48 years and presiding over some moral atrocities while being the subject of countless rumors about his sexuality. His life had all the makings of a fascinating biopic, but Clint Eastwood’s “J. Edgar” never quite delivered. While DiCaprio earned rave reviews for his performance, many critics felt like Eastwood missed his opportunity to examine Hoover’s legacy with a truly critical eye, resulting in a bland film that played things far too safe."
