        "text": "19. OUT OF AFRICA (1985)\n\nDirector: Sydney Pollack. Written: Kurt Luedtke. Starring: Meryl Streep, Robert Redford, Klaus Maria Brandauer.\n\nStreep is fine as the adventurous and independent Karen Blixen, a Danish baroness who moved to Kenya and ran a coffee plantation in 1914. But I never bought a rather stiff Redford as her big-game hunter lover boy who won’t commit, even during their supposedly sensual outdoor shampoo scene where he suggestively pours water over her mane. Brandauer as her sphinx-like husband who escapes his loveless marriage is far more believable as an unfaithful carouser. Like many an ‘80s bio epic, the film is bloated yet beautifully shot on location. Oscar tally: 11 nominations, seven wins including director for Pollack.\n\n18. THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA (1937)\n\nDirector: William Dieterle. Writer: Henry Blanke. Starring: Paul Muni, Gale Sondergaard, Joseph Schildkraut.\n\nAn earnest if speech-heavy account of the late-19th-century French muckraking novelist who first found fame with “Nana,” a then-shocking account about a Parisian street prostitute. He would later become entangled in a court case involving a Jewish Army captain, Alfred Dreyfus, who is wrongly accused of treason by the anti-Semitic government . Muni was a specialist at portraying real-life men, having won Best Actor the previous year for his performance in “The Story of Louis Pasteur.” Oscar tally:10 nominations, three wins.\n\n17. ARGO (2012)\n\nDirector: Ben Affleck. Writer: Chris Terrio. Starring: Affleck, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, John Goodman.\n\nCIA operative Tony Mendez (Affleck) devises a scheme to rescue six U.S. diplomats from Tehran during the 1979-81 Iran hostage crisis. His plan: To pretend he is a film producer and the trapped embassy workers are part of a Hollywood crew shooting a sci-fi adventure – with the hope they can eventually board a plane to return home. Affleck is OK as an actor but is better as a director as he manages to blend tense action scenes with a caper comedy about the making of a cheesy “Stars Wars” rip-off. The cast is overloaded, with Oscar-nominated Arkin standing out as a cagey old-school film producer who assists Mendez with his ruse. All in all, “Argo” is a satisfying old-style piece of entertainment Oscar tally: seven nominations, three wins.\n\n16. BRAVEHEART (1995)\n\nDirector: Mel Gibson. Writer: Randall Wallace. Starring: Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan and Catherine McCormack.\n\nGibson’s bloody, brutal, romantic and often thrilling war epic depicts 13th-century Scottish warrior William Wallace who led a rebellion for independence against King Edward I of England. The actor’s on-screen charisma was at its height and his behind-the-camera skills in staging the battle scenes (he picked up some tricks from his “Mad Max” director George Miller) were impressive. He also didn’t care that the blue war paint worn by the Scots – known as “woad” – was an anachronism as were the tartan kilts they sport. They are key in a taunting scene as the Wallace’s men and their battlefield opponents stare down each other. They give out a war cry and chant before they lift their skirts and flash their manhoods. “Braveheart” was a bit of a scrappy underdog that year, up against the likes of “Apollo 13” and “Sense and Sensibility.” But it came on strong when it counted. Oscar tally: 10 nominations, five wins including director.\n\n15. A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001)\n\nDirector: Ron Howard. Writer: Akiva Goldsman. Starring: Russell Crowe, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany.\n\nHoward made a compelling human story about John Nash, a Princeton math scholar and Nobel Laureate in Economics who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. He would later help the Pentagon crack encrypted enemy telecommunications. Crowe can emote pain and sorrow with the best of them and Connelly, won a supporting actress Oscar, showed how to nail what I call the “stand-by-your-man” role. What didn’t work for me was that several of the more interesting characters, especially Bettany as a cheeky college roommate, are exposed late in the game as only existing in Nash’s mind. For me, it felt like a cheat. Brainy, troubled men would become a staple in awards-seeking biopics, including “The Theory of Everything” and “The Imitation Game.” Oscar tally: eight nominations, four wins including director.\n\n14. CHARIOTS OF FIRE (1981)\n\nDirector: Hugh Hudson. Writer: Colin Welland. Starring: Ben Cross, Ian Charleson, Alice Krige, John Gielgud\n\nAnyone who has ever jogged on the beach probably can’t get that rippling Vangelis Oscar-winning score out of their head. It accompanies the story of two athletes who competed in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. Eric Liddell (Charleson), a Christian missionary who races to glorify God, and Harold Abrahams (Cross) who experienced anti-Semitism while student at Cambridge and runs to defy such prejudice. The two men, after years of training, end up representing Great Britain at the Games. They each score personal victories, as Liddell is allowed to skip a race done on the Sabbath and scores a victory in another on a Thursday instead. Abrahams, beaten badly in an earlier race, manages to win a Gold medal in the 100 meter contest. At its worst, “Chariots” is slow-moving and obvious. At its best, it is a testament to the strength of human conviction. But really another biopic — Warren Beatty’s epic “Reds,” about radical journalist John Reed –should have triumphed. At least he won Best Director. Oscar tally: seven nominations, four wins.\n\n13. THE GREAT ZIEGFELD (1936)\n\nDirector: Robert Z. Leonard. Writer: William Anthony McGuire. Starring: William Powell, Myrna Loy, Luise Rainer.\n\nPowell dashingly embodies theatrical showman Flo Ziegfeld Jr. in what once was considered a state-of-the-art musical biopic based on Broadway’s “Ziegfeld Follies.” Real-life entertainers such as Fanny Brice (whose own life story was the basis of the movie musical “Funny Girl”) play themselves. A production number done to the tune of “A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody” employs an elaborate rotating wedding-cake tower with an immense chorus line of fabulously attired beautiful women along with male singers and dancers amid 175 spiral steps is the show-stopper. But the film is best known for Rainer’s emotional one-way telephone conversation as her fragile French singer Anna Held tearfully calls her ex-love Ziegfeld to congratulate him on his marriage to actress Billie Burke. L “The Greatest Showman,” a lavish 2017 musical about circus impresario P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman), was clearly influenced by this predecessor with its musical interludes and big-top performers while romanticizing its subject. Oscar tally: seven nominations and three wins, including Best Actress for Rainer.\n\n12. GREEN BOOK (2018)\n\nDirector: Peter Farrelly. Writers: Farrelly, Nick Vallelonga, Brian Hayes. Starring: Viggo Mortenson, Mahershala Ali, Lina Cardellini.\n\nA rough-around-the edges Italian American nightclub bouncer known as Frank “Tony Lip” Vallelonga (Mortenson, who gained 45 pounds) signs up to be a bodyguard and chauffeur for a refined African-American jazz pianist Don Shirley (Ali) as he goes on an eight-week tour in the Midwest and Deep South during the Jim Crow era. The odd couple initially clash as Don is put off by some of Tony’s sloppy habits but soon find common ground in music and also the way the musician is discriminated against. Don pays him back by upgrading his love letters he sends to his wife (Cardellini). Along the way, they forge a bond that they kept for the rest of their lives. Farrelly, best known for raunchy comedies, took a career detour that paid off with Oscars for Best Picture, Original Screenplay and Supporting Actor for Ali. When Steven Spielberg took an early gander at “Green Book,” he declared it to be the best buddy picture since “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” and switched its studio from indie label Focus to parent company Universal.\n\n11. THE KING’S SPEECH (2010)\n\nDirector: Tom Hooper. Writer: David Seidler. Starring: Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nWhile many were disgruntled that another biopic, “The Social Network,” that focused on Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg didn’t win, this more upbeat buddy pic that paired Firth as stuttering King George VI and Rush as speech therapist Lionel Logue proved to be a palatable-enough crowd-pleaser. The hold-your-breath scene that seals the deal arrives at the end, when Firth – with his trusty coach by his side – delivers Britain’s declaration of war against Nazi Germany over the radio in 1939 without getting tongue-tied. Hooper has a thing for filming wide shots in large in-door rooms with empty walls that can feel oddly claustrophobic. But casting is key, as Firth, Rush, Bonham Carter as the mother of Queen Elizabeth II, Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill and Guy Pearce as King Edward VIII, who notoriously abdicated the throne to wed Wallis Simpson, make for quite a royal flush of talent. Oscar tally: 12 nominations and four wins including director and lead actor for Firth.\n\n10. THE LAST EMPEROR (1987)\n\nDirector: Bernardo Bertolucci. Writer: Mark Peploe, Bertolucci. Starring: John Lone, Joan Chen, Peter O’Toole.\n\nAnother grandiose ‘80s-style bio epic relates the fate of Pu Yi, the last emperor of China who reigned as a child ruler from 1908 to his abdication in 1912 after the Xinhai Revolution. He briefly was put back on the throne for several days in 1917. He would be imprisoned and eventually underwent political rehab by the Communist Party. As Roger Ebert said in his review at time of release, “This is a strange epic because it is about an entirely passive character. … Pu Yi was born into a world that allowed him no initiative.” He eventually becomes a gardener and finds some satisfaction in his life. The movie was most noteworthy for being allowed to film in the People’s Republic of China and inside the Forbidden City, a sprawling medieval structure. Also,19,000 extras were employed and used throughout the film. O’Toole plays a Scottish tutor to teach Pu Yi the ways of European culture. Oscar tally: nine nominations and nine wins, include director and art direction.\n\n9. GANDHI (1982)\n\nDirector: Richard Attenborough. Writer: John Briley. Starring: Ben Kingsley, Candice Bergen, Edward Fox, John Gielgud.\n\nThis decades-spanning epic kicks off with the Indian holy man’s death from an assassin’s bullet in 1948 and goes back in time to when Gandhi, then 23, was kicked off a South African train for sitting in a whites-only first-class compartment even though he had the appropriate ticket. That prejudicial act leads the lawyer to turn into an activist and lead a nonviolent protest campaign for the rights of Indians living in South Africa. He returns to India, and is celebrated as a hero as he begins a campaign in his homeland and fights for its independence from British rule. The country becomes divided by religion and tensions between Hindus and Muslims spark nationwide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike until the fighting ends. Kingsley, who is partly of Indian descent, won an Oscar in just his second movie role and became a star overnight. “Newsweek” reviewer Jack Kroll wrote that the actor “gives what is possibly the most astonishing biographical performance in screen history.” “Gandhi’s” success led to a boom in India-set British films such as “Heat and Dust” and “A Passage to India.” Oscar tally: 11 nominations, eight wins including director.\n\n8. SPOTLIGHT (2015)\n\nDirector: Tom McCarthy. Writers: McCarthy, Josh Singer. Starring: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber.\n\nThose like myself who worked in a newsroom in 2001, when actual physical papers were still being read by the public and not just on the Internet, can’t help but be absorbed by the extraordinary commitment and professionalism of The Boston Globe’s crackerjack Pulitzer-winning investigative team. But anyone will be appalled by the rampant sexual abuse committed by Catholic clergy that was being covered up by the city’s Archdiocese. Unlike “All the President’s Men,” which focused on the dynamic duo of Woodward and Bernstein, this is a celebration of an entire team of scrappy journalists brought to life by a knockout ensemble. McCarthy handles the delicate subject at hand as well as the grueling act of research with aplomb, building tension without undercutting the importance of the mission. That the Church continues to struggle to handle this long-standing issue has kept this winning title quite relevant. Oscar tally: Six nominations, and two wins, including original screenplay.\n\n7. A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS (1966)\n\nDirector: Fred Zinnemann. Writer: Robert Bolt. Starring: Paul Scofield, Wendy Hiller, Leo McKern, Robert Shaw.\n\nBolt’s play is the basis of this straight-forward rendering of the conflict between the devoutly Catholic Sir Thomas More (Scofield), the 16th-century Lord Chancellor of England, and King Henry VII (Shaw).More is averse to signing a letter asking the Pope to annul the marriage of the ruler to Catherine of Aragon. He also balks at taking an oath declaring the king to be the head of the Church of England. Henry attempts to bully More into changing his stance but to no avail. More resigns from his position and refuses to attend the king’s wedding to Anne Boleyn. He ends up being imprisoned in the Tower of London, and is accused of treason and sentenced to death. The man of faith delivers these words to his executioner: “I die His Majesty’s good servant, but God’s first.” Scofield, who brings a voice of gentility to his character’s unwavering beliefs, had previously played More on stage in London and on Broadway. He wouldadd a lead Academy Award to go with his Tony. Oscar tally: Eight nominations, six wins including director.\n\n6. PATTON (1970)\n\nDirector: Franklin. J. Schaffner. Writers: Francis Ford Coppola, Edmund H. North. Starring: George C. Scott, Karl Malden.\n\nRoger Ebert in his review of this large-scale biographical war film starring Scott as General George S. Patton during World War II wrote of the portrayal: “It is one of those sublime performances in which the personalities of the actor and the character are fulfilled in one another.” The actor and the soldier shared not only a first name, but an irascible personality. That Scott refused his lead Oscar since he disdained such awards contests is all you need to know. The iconic first scene sets the tone, with Patton covered in his medals and standing before an immense American flag as he delivers his morale-raising speech to the Third Army. The writers had to tone down the actual cursing, with “fornicating “ replacing another f-word to avoid an R rating. Another famous scene: Patton visits a field hospital and notices a traumatized soldier crying. Declaring him a coward, he slaps his face and threatens to shoot him. General Eisenhower relieves him of his duties and forces him to apologize to the soldier and his entire command. The battles are believably re-created, but they can’t compete with Scott’s outsized acting. Oscar tally: 10 nominations and seven wins, including director.\n\n5. THE SOUND OF MUSIC (1965)\n\nDirector: Robert Wise. Writer: Ernest Lehman. Starring: Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Eleanor Parker, Peggy Wood.\n\nYes, it is a movie musical – the most successful ever, with an adjusted 2018 domestic gross of $1.3 billion-plus, according to Box Office Mojo. And the Rodgers and Hammerstein songs such as “My Favorite Things” and “Climb Ev’ry Mountain” are sublimely sing-along-able. But it is also based on a true story of Maria (Andrews), a free-spirited young Austrian woman training to be a nun who becomes a governess to seven children. She eventually earns their trust while teaching them to sing as a group. She ends up marrying their stern widower father, Captain von Trapp (Plummer). When the family performs at a festival, they manage to escape from the Nazis that are annexing their homeland. Not in the film: They would end up in Stowe,, Vermont, where they ran a music camp between tours as the Trapp Family Singers. Screenwriter Lehman, a fan of the opening of the big-screen version of “West Side Story,” wanted to the musical to similarly feel like “a fairy tale that’s almost real,” including the palatial von Trapp estate and the Cinderella feel to the romance that carries over to the wedding sequence. Oscar tally: 10 nominations, five wins including director.\n\n4. AMADEUS (1984)\n\nDirector: Milos Forman. Writer: Peter Shaffer. Starring: F. Murray Abraham,Tom Hulce, Elizabeth Berridge, Jeffrey Jones.\n\nAnother music-packed biopic, one that swirls around the late-18th-century rivalry between an older Italian composer Antonio Salieri (Abraham) and the gifted though immature Austrian boy wonder Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Hulce) as both try to please Emperor Joseph II (Jones) with their compositions. Since Salieri lacks the talent to keep up with Mozart’s output, including such operas as “The Marriage of Figaro” and ‘Don Giovanni,” he instead plots to take him down. Forman and Shaffer manage to make the world of classical music cutthroat, funny and moving. Abraham, best known for playing a bunch of grapes in a Fruit of the Loom underwear commercial, and Hulce, best known as Pinto in “Animal House,” both competed for Best Actor. But, in this case, Salieri triumphed. One senses that this court-side film might have inspired the makers of “The Favourite.” Oscar tally: 11 nominations, eight wins including director.\n\n3. 12 YEARS A SLAVE (2013)\n\nDirector: Steve McQueen. Writer: John Ridley. Starring: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Lupita Nyong’o.\n\nThis powerful, grueling and rightfully brutal depiction of Southern slavery in all its cruelty and ignorance is based on a 1853 memoir written by Solomon Northup (Ejiofor), a free African-American man born in New York who was kidnapped and sold into bondage. He would toil on plantations in Louisiana for 12 years until he was finally released. His owners ranged from the gentlemanly William Ford (Cumberbatch) to the self-hating sadist Edwin Epps (Fassbender), who especially mistreats Patsey (Nyong’o), raping and abusing her regularly. Eventually, Northup finds a way to convince officials of his free status. Nyong’o won a supporting Oscar for her feature debut while McQueen became the first black filmmaker to receive a Best Picture Academy Award. Oscar tally: Nine nominations, three wins.\n\n2. SCHINDLER’S LIST (1993)\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg. Writer: Steven Zaillian. Starring: Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Embeth Davidtz.\n\nThis rare upbeat if often devastating true tale about the Holocaust centers on Oskar Schindler (Neeson), a German businessman and member of the Nazi Party who rescued over a thousand Polish-Jewish refugees by employing them in his factories during World War II. Shot in Krakow and filmed in black and white, Schindler hires a local Jewish official, Itzhak Stern (Kingsley) to help him run his business. His helper encourages him to hire Jewish laborers to prevent them from being put in concentration camps or killed. Trouble arrives in the form of a SS officer Amon Goth (Fiennes) who oversees a massacre of ghetto dwellers. Schindler soon after shifts his priorities from making money to saving lives. The Spielberg who made crowd-pleasers definitely stepped up his game on this one, creating scenes of violence that were often unwatchable – something he would benefit from when he shot his 1998 World War II epic, “Saving Private Ryan.” Oscar tally: 12 nominations, seven wins including best director.\n\n1. LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (1962)\n\nDirector: David Lean. Writers: Robert Bolt, Michael Wilson. Starring: Peter O’Toole, Alec Guinness, Omar Sharif, Jose Ferrer.\n\nA sprawling epic supreme at nearly four hours follows the World War I adventures of that human enigma known as T.E. Lawrence, a British archaeologist, army officer, diplomat and writer during the time he was sent to Arabia to collaborate with Prince Faisal (Guinness) in his revolt against the Turks. He is brought to dashingly handsome life by O’Toole, who became an international sensation in the title role. So much so, that Noel Coward told the actor after attending the movie’s premiere,” If you had been any prettier, the film would have been called ‘Florence of Arabia.’ ” The star’s main rival in the looks department is the gorgeous 70mm cinematography that makes a shot of a giant sun rising over the desert obscenely beautiful. While there is a dearth of female roles, O’Toole’s Lawrence shares a world-class bromance with Omar Sharif, who makes a fabulous entrance as Arab leader Sherif Ali. He is the one who convinces Lawrence to wear traditional robes atop a camel while crossing dangerously seductive landscapes. Oscar tally: 10 nominations, seven wins including director."
