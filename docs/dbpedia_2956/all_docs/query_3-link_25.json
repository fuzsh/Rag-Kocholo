        "text": "Written by: Lili Minato | Freelancer\n\nIn the past year alone, 17 biopics were released in movie theaters and on major streaming services. The most notable of them is, “Oppenheimer,” which is currently nominated for 13 Oscars. Now, in 2024, new biopics are playing in theaters, including: “Bob Marley: One Love,” as well as the trailer for, “Back to Black,” a film about the life of Amy Winehouse.\n\nMany of the upcoming blockbuster films fall under the category of biographical movies, including a recently announced four-film series about The Beatles. Theaters everywhere are currently being overrun with these biographical retellings.\n\nBiopics are a genre that attracts a very specific audience. Most films during this day and age attempt to appeal to all viewers, which can cause the movie to fall flat. Biographical films attract an audience that is interested in the people, or person, that the film is about; rather than having to worry about reaching a large audience, the directors only need to worry about making a mediocre film and disappointing the fans.\n\nBy making a film about a subject with adoring and intrigued fans, directors are almost guaranteed a box office hit. They simply have to hire the right actors and writers to depict an accurate story. There is little creativity needed to share the life of another person.\n\nBiopics are easier to make compared to an original story with an original script and there is less risk. Even if the film doesn’t end up being well-loved, most people will still go to theaters to see their favorite historical figure on the big screen.\n\nThis is the reason for the constant output of biopics. There will always be famous and notable people to make movies about, and there will always be an audience for them. Original scripts and stories don’t have the safety net of a premade story featuring a well-known figure.\n\nThese biographical films will never stop being produced; people will continue to die and movies will continue to be made. While these films hold some substance for sharing the lives of misunderstood individuals who didn’t have a voice like Priscilla Presley in, “Priscilla,” most biopics continue to reshare over-told stories of famous personalities.\n\nBiopics have their purpose in our society, but after a while, they will soon become old and overused.\n\nContact the author at lminato22@mail.wou.edu."
