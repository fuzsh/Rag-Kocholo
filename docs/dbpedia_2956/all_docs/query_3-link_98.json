        "text": "The last few years have brought a bevy of popular biopics to theaters, from 2023 Best Picture nominee “Elvis,” to 2024 contender “Oppenheimer.” It looks as if that trend will continue into this year, with a biographical treatment of Amy Winehouse slated for May of this year and another of Bob Marley, called “Bob Marley: One Love” set for release on February 14. Many of these movies draw praise and accolades for their stars and directors, but according to Ranker data, they’ve also improved the standings of their historical subjects among our readers.\n\nPeople come to Ranker, the #1 source of crowdsourced rankings on the internet, to voice their opinions on their favorite movies, TV shows, celebrities, and even historical figures."
