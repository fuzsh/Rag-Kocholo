        "text": "Post by codystarbuck on\n\nThis question is prompted by my viewing of Bohemian Rhapsody. I'm a big fan of Queen and have read a couple of books and viewed some documentaries and concert films. Plus, I was alive during their career. The film plays very fast and loose with facts and timelines, especially shifting things around to manipulate emotions and motivations for things, rather than depicting what really happened. it ignores a lot more interesting stuff, then twists actual things to fit their narrative, which is mostly false or extremely massaged. it ticked me off greatly (my wife was just bored by it).\n\nOn the other hand, we watched Hidden Figures and enjoyed it, even though they also played fast and loose with some of the events. For instance, after one of the three women has had enough and rants about segregated bathrooms, there is a scene of Kevin Costner's character tearing down a \"Whites Only\" sign. Never happened. One character is being passed over for supervisor, yet had actually been promoted to a supervisory role years before the time period depicted.\n\nTo me, that one still uses mostly factual things to tell the actual story. It does shift some things around, time wise, and shifts experiences between characters; but, it mostly tells a great story with the real facts. It certainly plays to certain tropes, and was criticised for the Costner scene, as depicting the White Savior cliche, in context of civil rights. That seemed rather fair, though I didn't think it detracted from the film.\n\nWith Queen, there is definitely a more personal aspect to the film, as a fan of the band; but, I felt like they were deliberately manipulating an audience to tell their jazzed up story, rather than telling the actual story. For instance, Freddie was not diagnosed with AIDS until about 1987; yet they have him telling the band before Live Aid, to help convince them to reform and play the gig. In reality, the band had never broken up and had finished a tour some months before and were taking time off. The film would have you think that Live Aid was it for them, despite touring the following year and putting out 3 albums, before Freddie's death (and one after). They show his personal manager Paul interfering with word about Live Aid, yet he was out by 1984. They create motivations that weren't there, rather than Freddie and the band getting involved because of the cause, though being wary of whether the event would work or was a pipe dream and whether they could play up to their standards, in that kind of a set-up. It has MTV existing before they record \"Another One Bites the Dust, yet MTV debuted in the summer of 1981. They claim I Want to Break free's video was banned by MTV, yet it was in heavy rotation, at first. It might have been retired early, due to concerns about the drag; but, I don't recall it suddenly disappearing, just appearing more sporadically, when the album wasn't getting much coverage in the US and they weren't touring here.\n\nTo me, this film isn't remotely factual, as too much is fabricated or altered to tell something other than the actual story. It is a fiction inspired by events and people in Freddie's life. For me, a biopic or historical film needs to be true to the facts, while still presenting them in an entertaining way. A complete fiction that intersects with history is a different story (like Quantum Leap's various intersections with history, like when Sam meets young Woodie Allen or Stephen King). The defense on the other side is \"It's not a documentary!\" That's fine, if you aren't marketing it as a biopic. that implies that it is factual, with some events dramatised, condensed or whatever. This felt like a fabricated story, with some facts placed in for emotional impact.\n\nBy contrast, The Right Stuff has a bunch of things that are made up, massaged, condensed, ignored, magnified or glossed over; yet, it is mostly faithful to the truth and the people who lived it. Same with Apollo 13. No, they didn't get into a sparring match in the middle of the mission; yet, you could see the truth of those emotions, like it might have been inside their head,; but, not ever verbalized. As Jim Lovell said, they had too many things to do and they were professionals. Character actions were composites of those of several people (especially the engineers and things you see with Ken Mattingly, in the simulator, testing procedures to restart the command module). Yet, most of it happened and happened the way it was shown, even if more than one person was doing things you see one character doing.\n\nSo, anyway, the question is, how important is accuracy, to you. Do you mind massaging things if the story is good, or do you prefer that the facts be correct, even if events are given heightened drama? Is it more forgivable in a biopic or a film that re-enacts historical events? Does it matter, as long as you are entertained?\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nWhen I was in grad school (studying ancient/medieval history), my thesis adviser (Prof. Sunshine, no lie) had what he called Sunshine's Law of Historical Movies, which stated, any movie depicting historical or \"true events\" will tell you more about the time it was made and the people making it than it will about the time it is set or the people it is about.\n\nAll history is interpretation of events by those doing the telling. It is all biased in some way or another, the key is in identifying the bias of the tellers. Facts and evidence are one thing, but history is another, it is a story based on those facts and evidence told through the lens of the teller's interpretation of them. Even first hand accounts and primary sources are biased and will contain inaccuracies based on the lens of the witness/teller. Secondary and tertiary sources even more so.\n\nSo inaccuracies in historical or biopics do not bother me much, as they are in and of themselves historical clues telling us about the time the story is told and what is important tot he people of that time, especially when contrasted with other sources and evidence about the topic. What matters to me about such movies is-is it a good movie? Does it tell a good story that I enjoy experiencing? I don't go in expecting accuracy because I know better. Even if the movie were 100% true to source material it would still contain inaccuracies, it would just be those of the source material not of the movie makers doing. People believe the fallacy that there is a \"T\"rue history or that history is an infallible fact based account. Nothing can be further from the truth. At best, it is a best guess based on what evidence and sources we have available, and it is a rarity when it even achieves that (and if all the sources agree or are uncontested or that a majority of historians agree on what they say actually means, or that the sources are even reliable in their accounts or that new evidence or sources won;t come to light to totally change our understanding or that evidence and sources are not being deliberately ignored because they challenge the \"accepted\" accounts, etc. etc.).\n\nWhat can bother me is if the filmmakers/storytellers misrepresent what they are actually doing, but then a part of that is on me for not going in with my eyes open and determining for myself what the movie actually aspires to be.\n\n-M\n\nPost by berkley on\n\nIf the subject is anyone that's lived since the age of film and television, I'd much prefer to see a documentary than watch some actor, no matter how talented and skilful, trying to impersonate them. I'm a bit of a diehard about this and have not and likely never will see the current Neil Armstrong movie, Will Smith as Muhammad Ali, whoever played Ray Charles and Johnny Cash in those highly commercially successful biopics from a few years back, Gary Oldman as Churchill, etc, etc.\n\nSome of these and others I've seen bits and pieces of in previews or when they've been playing on someone's tv while I was at a get-together at someone's house or some such situation, and nothing has compelled me to change my mind about this. I just don't have any interest in watching an actor when I can see and hear the actual person, even if only in their public moments.\n\nI really don't get the attraction, especially if you're watching, for example, Oldman give his version of Churchill's famous radio speech, which is such an iconic piece of 20th century history that it's even become a part of pop-culture; not to mention those actors who give their own renditions of famous songs by the singer or artist they're playing, something I'll never understand - what, if they made a biopic of Leonardo da Vinci would they get the actor to paint his own version of the Mona Lisa?\n\nI can kind of see the interest in watching re-enactments of things that went on behind the scenes, but even then, some of these people are so familiar in themselves that I find it almost impossible to accept an actor's portrayal.\n\nThere are exceptions: the German film about Hitler's last days, Downfall, was one of the best things I've seen the last 10 or 20 years. Perhaps it helped that Hitler himself, as we see him in newsreel footage and so on, was already a caricature, so the film actually adds nuance rather than taking it away. I suppose fans of the movies I listed in the first paragraph might make the same claim for those performances, but I just don't see it. Interestingly, I saw a documentary called Hilter's Secretary not long afterwards and it confirmed the dramatic film both in factual detail and in atmosphere and feeling.\n\nAnd there was French film a few years back about Sarkozy that was pretty good - in this case because it wasn't so much Sarkozy himself that was interesting as the whole story, the political back-door dealing, etc. Also, I'm not all that familiar with French politics, so hadn't seen much in the way of photos, video, etc of the people involved. I doubt if I'd be able to sit through a similar film about, for example, Canadian politicians I am very familiar with, no matter how interesting the story - just as I'm not interested in watching the dramtised film CBC made about the 1972 Canada-Russia series, so famous here in Canada: don't want to see actors playing my favourite hockey players like Yvan Cournoyer.\n\nPost by Dizzy D on\n\n@mrp said:\n\nWhen I was in grad school (studying ancient/medieval history), my thesis adviser (Prof. Sunshine, no lie) had what he called Sunshine's Law of Historical Movies, which stated, any movie depicting historical or \"true events\" will tell you more about the time it was made and the people making it than it will about the time it is set or the people it is about.\n\nAll history is interpretation of events by those doing the telling.

Something we are noticing more and more as we catch up to and surpass a lot of classic sci-fi books and movies.\n\nAs for the topic itself:\n\nI like accuracy in my movies, but I don't demand it. I just feel that if a writer, director or actor did his work in researching the period of the piece, the events surrounding it and so on, that it nearly always result in a better product in the end. I also think that if you want to make a story out of it, you *will* have to change things, because reality never follows the structure of a regular story (unless it's a Coen's style story where the protagonists don't know what is going on, learn nothing and/or nothing gets resolved). I also like if movies/books/comics include an in-story reason for changing events , presenting the story as told by an unreliable narrator for instance, or just ignore history in the most blatant way to show \"yes, no historical accuracy here at all\" a la Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds.\n\nPost by chadwilliam on\n\nI don't believe that someone knowledgeable about the subject at hand should be penalized for possessing that knowledge which I think is what happens when you watch a \"based on a true story\" film that gets everything wrong. If you're interested in the subject, why would you want to see the film makers make one mistake after another. If you're not interested, why even see the movie. I avoid biopics like the plague for this reason.\n\nIt's also manipulative and cheap. I remember watching that Bruce Lee \"biography\" that came out in the early 90's and being amazed that a man who broke his back and had to live inside a giant metal contraption for a time, could make a comeback and reclaim his title as the greatest martial artist in the world. I didn't question the veracity of this (I would have been about 12 or 13 at the time) and thought \"Wow. What a guy!\". Eventually of course, I found out this never happened. It was a ridiculous plot line which if utilized in a film open about its fictional status would have been laughed out of the theatres. However, because they shoved a real person we all knew into it, the film makers were granted the benefit of the doubt (at least in my case). \"Hey, I've heard of Bruce Lee and I know he was capable of incredible things! This, therefore, must have happened!\" It was a cheap and crass tug at the ol' heartstrings which commandeered the public's perception of a real person to enhance their one-dimensional creation. Had the film makers simply told the story they had written - about an unbelievably powerful superhuman I can't imagine they would have gotten much acclaim. Slap Bruce Lee's name on their character however, and suddenly they've garnered instant credibility without effort.\n\nOf course, this is hardly the worst example of twisting reality to make your movie shine.\n\nEd Wood perverted Bela Lugosi into a foul mouthed old man bitter about not getting the lead role in Frankenstein. Not who the guy was in real life, but hey, why be respectful when an Oscar's on the line?\n\nThat Abraham Lincoln biopic from several years back reduced a great man into a father who'd hit his son if he lost his temper. Never mind the fact that in real life, the worst display of Lincoln's temper was when he spoke to his son sternly for misplacing some important papers. Why respect your meal ticket and the man who freed the slaves when a few seconds of dramatic tension is at stake?\n\nSpeaking of Presidents, thanks to Oliver Stone, intelligent discourse on the assassination of JFK has been set back generations because of all the lies he peppered throughout his film (which also made a hero out crooked cop Jim Garrison).\n\nOh, and Houdini didn't die in the Water Chamber act either."
