        "text": "Black History Month is a great time to brush up on your knowledge of great Black leaders, thinkers, innovators and changemakers who have left their mark on the world for the better. Despite being celebrated during the shortest month of the year, Black history and individual stories of trials and triumphs deserve to be observed year round. After all, Black history is American history, and as the great Ava DuVernay once said, “When we’re talking about diversity, it’s not a box to check. It is a reality that should be deeply felt and held and valued by all of us.”\n\nIn addition to reading books by Black authors, visiting historic museums and sites, taking classes and listening to podcasts, these watching a few (or all!) of these movies about Black history are a good way to honor and celebrate Black culture.\n\nSome of the stories on this list are heavier, but necessary to watch documentaries that explore the ugly truths about racial inequality. While others are uplifting historical films focused on Black heroes who overcame the odds. Then we have must-see movies that are brought to life by Black filmmakers and directors.\n\nPick out a few of your favorites and embark on an educational movie marathon."
