        "text": "Luke Hemmings’ solo career is at the starting line.\n\nAs the clock struck midnight, the 5 Seconds of Summer singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist dropped his debut solo single, “Starting Line.”\n\nA shimmering power ballad, “Starting Line” is a collaboration with producer and songwriter Sammy Witte (Maggie Rogers, Jessie Ware).\n\n“Starting Line” discusses “missing various memories,” Hemmings explains in a statement. “You’re reflecting on your youth and all of the madness and craziness. It’s like you’re forgetting so many pieces of your life—not from vices or anything—but from the sheer volume. I had to figure out how to fill a lot of gaps for myself in a positive way. It’s the human condition to change everything up after so long.”\n\nThe new release is lifted from Hemmings’ solo debut LP When Facing the Things We Turn Away From, due out Aug. 13.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nHemmings and his 5SOS bandmates have climbed to the very top on multiple occasions. The band has landed three No. 1s on the Billboard 200 albums chart, a first for an Australian act to do so. Their hit “Youngblood” cracked the top 10 of the Hot 100 chart in 2018 and finished the year as the best-selling single in their homeland, where it was named song of the year at the annual ARIA Awards.\n\nEarlier in 2021, 5SOS split with Interscope and signed up with YM&U Group’s Joel Mark and Peter Katsis for management.\n\nHemmings’ single and album announcement cap a big month for the pop-rock artist. Earlier, 24-year-old popped the question to his long-time gal-pal Sierra Deaton. She said “yes”.\n\nStream “Starting Line” below."
