        "text": "THE STARTING LINE KICKS BUTT\n\nIf there are any bands out there looking for a lead singer, do an America Online member profile search like the guys of The Starting Line did and voila! - the band has a new singer. If it was only as simple as that - but luckily, it was that simple for the guys of The Starting Line.\n\nA few years ago, Matt Watts of the Starting Line did an AOL member profile search and sent out an email to numerous addresses looking for a lead singer. Ken was the only one to reply to Matt's e-mails and the guys found a vocalist and a bassist in Ken himself.\n\nSince then, The Starting Line has been playing together with one goal in mind - to have fun. It wasnât long after until the guys started playing local gigs at clubs and recorded a demo that they started to shop around to record companies.\n\nAfter finding their bassist/vocalist off of the internet, it was only fitting to rely on the internet circuit to get their music heard as well. The Starting Line then posted their songs as MP3s and one day when the Southern California based We The People Records stumbled upon The Starting Lineâs songs online, everything changed. We The People were impressed and felt that their friends at Drive Thru Records, should check out The Starting Line themselves. After hearing the band play, Drive Thru was hooked and The Starting Line landed a record deal"
