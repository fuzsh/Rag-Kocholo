        "text": "Eager to start your own band but donât know where to start? Fear not. Starting a band doesnât have to be intimidating. It just takes a lot of coordinating, communicating and (quite often) a little bit of compromise!\n\nIf you're already an artist in your own right, starting a band can be a great way to gain some confidence as a musician in your field, network with other musicians, find your own inner circle and just straight up have fun.\n\nâ\n\nHow to form a band: 9 tips for starting your own\n\nStarting a band is no quick, slapdash job. A strong and long-lasting band is built on hard work, long hours of practice and a vibe thatâs uniquely your guysâ own.\n\nHere are the essential things youâll need to do to get the ball rolling.\n\nStep 1. Choose your band membersâ\n\nThereâs a big difference between finding some people to have a bit of a jam with and being highly selective about who you choose to start a long-term project with.\n\nPeople butt heads. It happens!\n\nBut ideally, you want to try and find people who you either already have (or know you can form) a genuine connection with. Youâll be spending countless hours with your bandmates, so make sure theyâre the kind of people you want to be around in the first place.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nPersonalities aside, youâll also need to think about each person's skill set and the style of music they play. The band members you choose will dictate much of your sound, profile and the genre of music you make going forward.\n\nSo if you want to form a 5-piece indie rock band thereâs not much use hunting down a Baroque style harpist.\n\nThink individually but also think logistically. Which kind of people would work as members - personality, skills, and instrumentation-wise, and which wouldnât necessarily?\n\nHereâs a few ways you can start actually finding members to join your band:\n\n- Put out flyers or posters - Displaying âBand Member Wantedâ posters around your local area is an old school but effective way of getting the feelers out around your local community of musicians.\n\nâ- Word of mouth - Another way is to simply network with musicians you already know, find out if theyâre interested or if they have a friend (or a friend of a friend) who might be!\n\nâ- Post on social media - Probably the best way to find band members is through social media. Post an Instagram Story or a status in a Facebook Group and ask people to DM you if theyâre interested.\n\nâ\n\nReddit is a great place to find potential new band members. Get started by checking out these top music subreddits.\n\nâ\n\nStep 2. Find your unique groove\n\nThe key to a long-lasting and successful band is finding your own, individual groove.\n\nAnd by 'groove', I donât just mean your sound and style. Itâs also about knowing how to build a music brand thatâll make your group stand out from the crowd.\n\nInitial jamming sessions are a great way to experiment with your new band members and find a sound that fits.\n\nDiscussing things like your musical influences, inspirations and favourite artists will also help you form a much better understanding about the kind of music you want to create and the image you want to portray.\n\nIf some of your band members have already released or written music before, it could be a good idea to craft your style around the kinds of music you're already familiar with or skilled in making.\n\nBut thatâs not to say you canât experiment down the line!\n\nPlenty of well-known bands have spiced up their sounds and images over the years to keep their fans interested. Bands like Radiohead, Maroon 5 & Fleetwood Mac have all undergone some kind of sonic redefinition since their initial formation.\n\nBut at this early stage, knowing exactly who you are & what sets you apart is whatâs going to make you a more successful band in the longer run.\n\nStep 3. Choose a memorable band name\n\nGetting the name of your band right is actually a really important part of your bandâs profile and overall branding.\n\nOnce you start bouncing ideas off each other, youâll be surprised how quickly you could find the perfect fitting name.\n\nBand Bastille got their name because the bandâs lead singer was born on the 14th July, which also happens to be national Bastille Day. Very fitting.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nColdplay took their name from an anthology of childrenâs poems called âChildâs Reflections: Cold Playâ.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nThe inspiration behind Two Door Cinema Club comes from a mispronunciation of an old theatre that was called âTudor Cinema Clubâ, in one of the memberâs hometowns.\n\nâ\n\nSo yeah, thereâs really no limit to the scope of inspo for cultivating a band name thatâs unique (for one reason or another) to you and your fellow bandmates.\n\nMake a list of some potential names and then plug them into Google to make sure they havenât already been taken. Youâll probably find to your dismay that a lot of them will be (sigh) but itâs better to know now than when you go to trademark your band name.\n\nâ\n\nTIP: Choose a name thatâs searchable, i.e. donât choose something thatâs so super vague that itâll bring up a tonne of search results when people look it up online. For example, âCast Iron Cornbreadâ is way more unique and will give you much more online visibility than something like âRock Godsâ.\n\nâ\n\nStep 4. Create a âBand Agreementâ\n\nOkay so this might sound a bit serious and corporate, but having a set of standards that outlines the process of how the bandâs actually going to work and function, is really quite important.\n\nIt doesn't have to be as serious as a formal ten page document thatâs dated, signed and sealed with a drop of each memberâs blood.\n\nIt can literally be an open discussion that leads to everyone agreeing on some non-negotiables to keep a happy camp.\n\nThings you might want to consider agreeing on areâ¦\n\nTime commitment - How many hours a week will you commit to rehearsals, gigging, etc? Can you all meet at set times that fits with everyones individual schedules?\n\nResponsibilities - Who will be responsible for things like PR and getting booked, communicating with promoters, bookkeeping bits and tax etc?\n\nOwnership - Who will own the specific rights to the songs? How will this affect how you claim your publishing royalties or performance cuts?\n\nAll of these things will need to be seriously discussed and decided upon well ahead of time to avoid any sticky situations or butting of heads later in the game.\n\nStep 5. Start writing your own material\n\nIf you and your group have never played before, writing your own songs might be a bit of a challenge at the beginning.\n\nBut itâs okay! Your first songs don't have to be hits. You donât even have to release them if you donât want to. The point of these initial songs is to start getting used to singing and playing with each other until youâre at a level where the songs are #bangermaterial.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nPlaying and releasing cover songs is a really easy way to start getting some material under your belt and building up a short set list that could work for a gig or performance.\n\nUsually each band has a designated songwriter or a few, so you may need to sit down and work out whoâs doing what in the early stages of the writing process.\n\nIf you're still stuck, here's 10 tips on how to write a song from a songwriting pro!\n\nStrike the right balance between having the best person for the job do most of the actual writing part, without shutting out everyone elseâs voices and opinions.\n\nCollaboration is KEY.\n\nStep 6. Record & release a demo\n\nSo youâve had some time to play around and now the serious writing process has taken off. Hooray!\n\nOnce youâve crafted a song you can be proud of, don't waste any time! Record and release your music online to platforms like Apple Music & Spotify.\n\nIdeally youâll want to have a demo released that you can send out to venues or promoters when it comes to getting potential gigs to let them hear how you sound.\n\nNot only that, releasing your music is the quickest way to start building a listener-base. And making your music readily available is really the only way youâre going to start building that all important audience.\n\nStep 7. Create an EPK\n\nBuilding an EPK (Electronic Press Kit) is crucial to your success at landing gigging opps, press coverage and self-promotion - making EPKs especially important for new acts on the scene who want to get booked.\n\nPlus, itâs something youâll always need to refer back to and update as you develop and level up as an act.\n\nAn EPK should basically be a profile for your band, with all the need to know information, as well as links to your assets, music, socials, website or anything else thatâs relevant.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWant to learn more? Find out how to create an EPK.\n\nStep 8. Busk & gig casually Â\n\nGetting booked for live gigs can be tricky when youâve yet to make a name for yourselves. But - performing live is probably the best exposure you can get at this early stage.\n\nBusking and gigging casually are great options at this early stage in your band's career.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nStay local and donât expect to headline any shows right away. Casual gigs at your local pizza place, bar or college are all good ways to start.\n\nThen once youâve perfected your on-stage performance skills, you can branch out into more serious playing opportunities - for example as a support act for another group, at festivals and other live events.\n\nStep 9. Spread the word\n\nLast but not least, itâs time to let people know that *insert your band name here* have ARRIVED.\n\nCreating social media pages specifically for your band will be a huge part of your social media marketing strategy.\n\nInstagram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok are all the big players - each with their own unique set of features that support engagement and interaction with fans, followers and other artists.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAsk your friends and family to share your account with their own friends and followers, and make sure you provide live audiences with your socials handles to check you out after the gig.\n\nOn top of social media, writing a music press release, pitching your music for playlists, and gaining exposure from submitting to music blogs & print, are all different ways you can really get the word out about you and your new band.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ"
