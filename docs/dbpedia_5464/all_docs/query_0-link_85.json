At Zoo Camp, campers will not only have the opportunity to learn about everything scaly, furry, and feathery, but they’ll find out how they can help San Antonio Zoo in securing a future for wildlife! Spending most of the day outdoors, campers will stay active and engaged with zoo tours, fun activities and games, exclusive experiences, and visiting animals.\n\nThe iconic Texas Horned Lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum) is the state reptile of Texas and was once abundant across the western two-thirds of the state. Since the late 1960s, horned lizard populations have declined or disappeared in many areas due to a variety of factors, including deterioration, fragmentation, and loss of habitat; non-native invasive species such as exotic grasses and red imported fire ants; and pesticide use. Many Texans have fond memories of the Texas Horned Lizard (aka “horny toad”) and wish for its return to its former abundance.\n\nThe Texas Horned Lizard Reintroduction Project at Center for Conservation and Research (CCR) at San Antonio Zoo seeks to restore the Texas Horned Lizard population by working with private landowners to introduce zoo hatched lizards in areas where it has disappeared in recent decades."
