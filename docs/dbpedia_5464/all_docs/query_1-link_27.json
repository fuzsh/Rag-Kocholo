        "text": "Best known as the lead vocalist of Australian pop rock outfit 5 Seconds Of Summer, Luke Hemmings has stepped away from the band to launch his solo career, beginning with the release this week of his new single Starting Line, produced by Sammy Witte.\n\nWhile work continues on new 5 Seconds Of Summer material, Hemmings has nevertheless taken the chance to release his own new work, with Starting Line – a powerful pop rock affair with a big chorus – the first release taken from his upcoming solo album When Facing Things We Turn Away From.\n\nWriting on his official Facebook page about the new album, Hemmings said: “I couldn’t be prouder to introduce you to When Facing the Things We Turn Away From, a project that grew out of a year of enforced stillness. I’m so grateful for the journey this album has taken me on and I’m so thankful to have had this creative outlet during my time at home.\n\n“Lyrically and sonically, this album has allowed me to decipher the last 10 years of my life and help me make sense of the person I am today and how I got here. It will be released everywhere August 13.” He added: “Thank you to my brothers in 5sos for your support and allowing me to pursue this project. Endless love to you.”\n\nIn another post on Facebook, Hemmings discussed his new track, saying: “Starting Line was written in one stream of thought at my friend Sammy’s house. The lyrics come from a reflection of 10 years of my life passing me by in what felt like forever but also in the blink of an eye. I have always had an obsession with time but it was elevated by staying at home after years of constant movement.”\n\nHemmings is not the only 5 Seconds Of Summer band member to release their own material away from the group. Last year drummer Ashton Irwin released his own solo album Superbloom, which was preceded by the single Skinny, Skinny.\n\nWatch the official visualizer for Starting Line here."
