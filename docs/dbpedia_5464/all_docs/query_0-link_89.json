Or tap suggested contacts in your call history.\n\nTap to make a video call or tap to make a FaceTime audio call.\n\nEach participant appears in a tile on the screen. When a participant speaks (verbally or by using sign language) or you tap the tile, that tile becomes highlighted or more prominent. Tiles that can’t fit on the screen appear in a row at the bottom. To find a participant you don’t see, swipe through the row. (The participant’s initials may appear in the tile if an image isn’t available.)\n\nTo prevent the tile of the person speaking or signing from becoming more prominent during a Group FaceTime call, go to Settings > FaceTime, then turn off Speaking below Automatic Prominence."
