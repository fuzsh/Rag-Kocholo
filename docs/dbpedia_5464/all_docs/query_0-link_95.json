        "text": "âI donât want to be that clichÃ© of an aging artist that puts out new shit that nobody cares about,â Walker tellsÂ Rolling Stone. âAnd when you write so many records doing a certain thing, you start to worry about recycling and repeating yourself. I would rather celebrate a record that has an anniversary âÂ and I have a lot of them. By the time I get through that cycle, Iâm going to be like 900 years old.â […]\n\nSo, if Walker is serious about calling his solo career quits, would that make 2022âsÂ Butch Walker asâ¦Glenn, his excellent piano-man LP in the vein of Elton John and Billy Joel, his final album?\n\nâGlennÂ was the swan song,â he confirms. âAnd I thought that when I did it. I just really needed to process it over a year or two and see if my theory held up.â\n\nA new feature announced by Instagram today will allow users to add a song on their profile â much like Myspace in the early 2000s.\n\nThe music added to a userâs profile shows up in the bio area, according to screenshots shared by Instagram. A song will be featured on a profile until the user removes or replaces it. But unlike Myspace, songs wonât autoplay â people viewing a profile with a song can play and pause the track.Â"
