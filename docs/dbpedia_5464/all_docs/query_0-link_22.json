It’s one of the main reasons why Carole Kai puts on the race … that and raising money for the community.\n\nWe want you to have an incredible time with your fellow runners, walkers and stroller babies. Just keep moving forward, have fun, and be safe. Enjoy all the various entertainment on the course, such as music, costumes, communities filled with cheering onlookers, and of course, the Shaka Zone.\n\nHere is what you can expect:\n\nEntertainment\n\nGreat Aloha Run has long been known for its music and entertainment on course, and this year you can expect to hear and see the 25th Infantry Band, Kaleheo High School Band, Stink Eye Band, Wahiawa Middle School Band, Farrington High School Band, Hawaii Matsuri Taiko Drummers, Islands of Aloha Dancers, Nanakuli High School Band, and the University of Hawaii Rainbow Pep Band. Expect some ‘inspirational’ music to motivate you along the course.\n\nPua Zone\n\nA longtime favorite spot on the course, Watanabe Florist will once again be out there supporting the run with flowers to enjoy. Mahalo to Watanabe Floral for making the great Aloha Run a Tradition! Special MAHALO to Craftsway for joining!\n\nShaka Zone\n\nWe want you to celebrate Aloha all morning long, by giving us the “Shaka” every time you pass one of these “Shaka” hands along the course. Keep a lookout for some of these along the climb on Kamehameha Highway,just after Radford Drive and before you can see the stadium."
