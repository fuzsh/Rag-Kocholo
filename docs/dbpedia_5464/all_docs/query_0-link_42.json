        "text": "They've just announced a new album\n\nColdplay may have formed over 20 years ago, but the band are truly unstoppable. The group, consisting of Chris Martin, Jonny Buckland, Guy Berryman and Will Champion, have had plenty of hits over the years, including their collaboration with K-Pop group, BTS 'My Universe', and 'Humankind', which they performed with Michael J Fox at Glastonbury 2024.\n\nThe band have now announced their next studio album will be called 'Moon Music', which sets new sustainability standards, and released 'feelslikeimfallinginlove' and 'We Pray' from the album.\n\nForming as a duo in 1996, Coldplay have a couple of decades experience in the music business to look back on. The band performed on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury Festival in 2024, making it the fifth time they have headlined the iconic festival, and the first since 2016.\n\n1) What were Coldplay originally called?\n\nColdplay weren't always called Coldplay! The band formed in 1996 when Chris Martin met lead guitarist Jonny Buckland at university in London. As a duo they were known as Pectoralz. Guy Berryman then joined as a bassist and they changed their name to Starfish.\n\nA little later, drummer and backing vocalist Will Champion joined to complete the line-up. In 1998 the band changed their name to Coldplay - something Chris Martin explained in a Carpool Karaoke segment with James Corden.\n\nWATCH: Chris Martin on James Corden's Carpool Karaoke\n\n2) What's the inspiration behind the song title 'Yellow'?\n\nColdplay's 2000 song 'Yellow' was so-called because Chris Martin spotted the Yellow Pages when he was trying to think of a name for the song. Not quite as romantic as we thought!\n\n3) Where are Coldplay from?\n\nThe band members all met at university in London, but they come from all over the UK. Chris Martin comes from a village near Exeter in Devon, whilst Jonny Buckland comes from London. Guy Berryman was born in Kirkcaldy, Scotland and Will Champion is from Southampton.\n\n4) Did any of the band ever go to university?\n\nThey sure did - like we said, it's where they met! Three members of Coldplay continued with their university degrees in the early days of the band starting out, but Guy decided to work in a London bar.\n\nChris has a degree in Ancient World Studies and Jonny studied Astronomy and Mathematics.\n\n5) How was the music video for 'The Scientist' filmed?\n\nAs fans of Coldplay will know, the music video for 'The Scientist' is no normal music video! The whole video is played in reverse, showing Chris walking backwards and telling the storyline from end, to beginning. Chris, however, is singing the track from beginning to end.\n\nSo how was this filmed? Simple - Chris Martin had to learn to sing 'The Scientist' backwards for the music video - which makes it even more impressive!\n\nWATCH: Coldplay - 'The Scientist' (Official Video)\n\n6) They take the London tube\n\nYep - Coldplay take the London tube, just like the rest of us! Chris once travelled to his own gig at the O2 Arena in London by tube, but despite his superstar A-list status, no-one recognised him - even though he was surrounded by Coldplay fans!\n\n7) Where do they record their music?\n\nColdplay have their own studio in north London. They bought a bakery in 2006 and converted it into a studio aptly named The Bakery. They decided to get a studio to help them refocus after the success of 'X & Y'.\n\n8) Can any of them speak another language?\n\nWord on the street is that Chris can speak Devonian, 'farm language'. Other than that, he will normally learn a couple of phrases in the language of any other countries the band are performing in.\n\n9) 'Something Just Like This' broke a record\n\nThe lyric video for Coldplay's single with The Chainsmokers, 'Something Just Like This', broke the record for the most streams in 24 hours. It had over nine million streams in the first 24 hours - impressive!\n\nWATCH: Coldplay & The Chainsmokers - 'Something Just Like This' (Lyric Video):\n\n10) Former president Obama is a Coldplay fan\n\nFormer US President Barak Obama is a HUGE Coldplay fan, and back in 2012 revealed had their music loaded onto his iPod. He apparently allowed his rendition of 'Amazing Grace' to be included on their 'A Head Full of Dreams' album.\n\nOf course, Chris Martin and his ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow are also famously friends with Jay-Z and Beyonc√© Knowles-Carter.\n\n11) Who is Phil Harvey?\n\nPhil Harvey is the band's current creative director and former manager, having single-handedly managed Coldplay during their early years. He is often referred to as the band's fifth member.\n\n12) Why are there two music videos for 'Viva La Vida'?\n\nThere are two versions of the music video for 'Viva La Vida' - one directed by Hype Williams, and the other directed by Anton Corbijn. They were released alongside one another, with Anton's version being tribute to his previous video for Depeche Mode's 'Enjoy the Silence'.\n\nWATCH: The official music video for 'Viva La Vida' by Coldplay\n\nWATCH: The Anton Corbijn Version of 'Viva La Vida' by Coldplay\n\n13) Are Coldplay in any films?\n\nYes! Both Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland made cameo appearances in the cult comedy horror film Shaun of the Dead - they're even good friends with film star Simon Pegg!\n\nChris Martin also appeared in an episode of Modern Family Season 9, which aired in November 2017.\n\nWATCH: Chris Martin in Modern Family\n\n14) What was their first release?\n\nColdplay's first music release was back in 1998, when they released an EP called 'Safety'. Only 500 copies of that EP were made!\n\n15) What is a Xyloband?\n\nThe Xyloband is a radio-controlled LED wristband which can change colour in time with the music. They were first used for Coldplays 'Mylo Xyloto tour' in 2012. The bands were made popular by Coldplay and have since been frequently used at shows and concerts.\n\nWATCH: Coldplay's 'Xylobands' in action:\n\nAs the band embarked on their 'Music of the Spheres World Tour', videos began to go viral of the gorgeous scenes as the crowd's Xylobands lit up.\n\n16) Has Coldplay's music been on any adverts?\n\nDespite being enormously popular, Coldplay will rarely allow their music to be used for advertising and endorsements. They have apparently turned down multi-million pound contracts from both Diet Coke and GAP.\n\nHowever, in 2021 the band's song 'Higher Power' was used in an advert for BMW's ix and i4 electric cars. With the line 'this joy is electric' and the song title, it is a fitting choice of song for an electric car advert.\n\n17) Do Coldplay always use the same music producer?\n\nColdplay have worked with a few producers, however have worked particularly closely with Brian Eno on a number of songs - including their fourth album 'Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends'. Brian was also involved with 'A L I E N S' which is featured on their long-awaited EP 'Kaleidoscope'!\n\n18) Which charity did the profits for 'A L I E N S' go to?\n\nAll profits from 'A L I E N S', a track which is featured on their Kaleidoscope EP, were donated to an international NGO which rescues migrants called Migrant Offshore Aid Station.\n\n19) They once announced an album by writing letters to their fans\n\nShaking things up a bit when it comes to announcing a new album, the band took the unusual decision to announce their 2019 album 'Everyday Life' by sending a typed letter to their fans.\n\nAfter receiving the letters in the post, fans took to social media to ask if anyone else had received the letter. It revealed the album would be made up of two halves called, 'Sunrise' and 'Sunset'.\n\nThe letter confirmed details of the album, including its release date of 22nd November 2019, and featured the band members' signatures written in gold pen.\n\n20) They had an exclusive album launch show\n\nColdplay had an exclusive album launch show for 'Music of the Spheres' in London, on 12th October 2021. Only 2,000 lucky fans attended the performance!\n\nThe band thrilled fans with the announcement of their ninth studio album 'Music of the Spheres', which was released on Friday 15th October 2021. The album has 12 tracks, including 'Higher Power', which came out in May 2021 as the lead track.\n\nWATCH: Coldplay's 'Higher Power'\n\n21) Their latest tour was their most eco-friendly yet\n\nIn 2019, it was revealed that Coldplay were set to take a break from touring until their concerts are 'environmentally beneficial'. In 2022, the band pledged for their upcoming tour to 'cut the tour's direct emissions by more than 50% compared to our previous tour (2016-17)'.\n\nColdplay announced several UK dates for the 'Music of the Spheres tour' in London and Glasgow for August 2022. They later added six more dates for May/June 2023.\n\nShows included eco-friendly features such as kinetic dance floors and stationary bikes, as well as the band making reforestation pledges involving planting and protecting trees - including one for every ticket sold.\n\nSpeaking about the new green technologies included in their shows, Guy said: \"You don't want to come across as being overly earnest. This stuff is really good fun as well. That's the way it will bed in, if people see it less as a sort of onerous responsibility and more as a kind of opportunity to do something fun.\"\n\n22) The London Tube forced them to move tour dates\n\nThe band originally had three dates at Wembley, but added three more due to high demand. Then, in early August 2022 they announced they would be moving the extra gig on the 19th August to the 21st, due to planned industrial action on the London Underground.\n\nIn a statement the band wrote: 'Due to planned industrial action on the London Underground network, Coldplay‚Äôs Wembley Stadium concert on Friday 19 August 2022 has had to be rescheduled for Sunday 21 August 2022.\n\n'We have been informed that there will be insufficient transport for ticket holders on August 19 so, with regret, the event cannot be licensed for that day.\n\n'All tickets for Friday 19 August will remain valid for Sunday 21 August.'\n\n23) Chris didn't think their collab with BTS would ever happen\n\nColdplay released their song 'My Universe' with world-renowned boyband BTS on 30th September 2021. ahead of the release of 'Music of the Spheres'. In keeping with the astronomy theme of the album, the music video for 'My Universe' follows a sci-fi storyline which takes place in space many years in the future.\n\nDespite the song's resounding success, Chris revealed that he wasn't sure the collab would ever even happen, questioning how their two sounds would fit together.\n\nIn an interview with Ellen Degeneres, he shared how the collaboration came about: \"That (collaboration) came about because someone said to me, ‚ÄòOh, BTS asked you to do a song for them‚Äô, that‚Äôs what I got told,\" he explained.\n\nHe then added how he didn‚Äôt think the project would ever happen, revealing: \"‚ÄòHow are we going to fit these two things together?'\"\n\nHe continued: \"Then the idea started to seem really attractive in its weirdness, and then one day, the right song just kind of arrived.\n\n\"And I just knew at the time (that) this was the song we were supposed to do with BTS and it‚Äôs supposed to be about people who can‚Äôt be together, or told they shouldn‚Äôt be together.\"\n\nIn April 2022, he also said on the Audacy podcast: \"I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever be able to match the BTS surprise... That was surprising even for us,\" he explained, before adding: \"It‚Äôs an amazing lesson for myself in keeping an open mind all the time, because you just never know what life or music is gonna throw you.\"\n\n24) They hold a BRIT Award record\n\nColdplay have the current record for most BRIT Award nominations for a band, with 30 nominations to date. Of these, they have won nine BRIT Awards over the years, with their first awards in 2011 for British Group and British Album of the Year, and their most recent in 2016 for British Group.\n\nThey were nominated in the 2022 BRIT Awards for Best Rock/Alternative Act and Best Group but the awards went to Sam Fender and Wolf Alice respectively.\n\n25) Their first performance after the pandemic was on a pontoon\n\nColdplay had their first TV performance following the pandemic when they opened the show at the BRIT Awards in 2021 from a pontoon! They performed their song 'Higher Power' and wowed fans with an incredible light show and fireworks.\n\n26) They've performed at the Super Bowl Half-Time show\n\nColdplay performed at the Super Bowl Half-Time show in 2016! The band headlined and performed alongside special guest performers Beyonc√© and Bruno Mars. Coldplay performed songs including 'Viva la Vida', 'Paradise' and 'Adventure of a Lifetime' during the incredible show.\n\nWATCH: Coldplay - Higher Power (Live at The BRIT Awards, London 2021):\n\n27) They set new sustainability standards\n\nIn June, the band announced their next studio album would be called 'Moon Music', and would set sustainability standards when it's released.\n\nThe album will come in several formats, including four physical ones.
