        "text": "Ten years ago, respected music website Allmusic.com gave an unflattering review to The Starting Line’s full-length debut album, “Say It Like You Mean It,” dismissing the pop-punk act as lightweight, even comparing the group’s harmonies to those of mega-selling boy bands.\n\nThe review noted the band’s “unsophisticated” EP had sold 25,000 copies and predicted — derisively — that the new album would “no doubt sell double that.”\n\nClose. The reviewer was only off by ... oh, about a quarter of a million copies.\n\n“Say It Like You Mean It” sold around 300,000 copies on California-based label Drive-Thru Records, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers new artist chart and catapulting The Starting Line from Philadelphia-area favorites to national success story.\n\n“Putting out that record changed all of our lives,” guitarist Matt Watts says.\n\nIt’s fitting, then, that the Bucks County-based band, which has mostly been on hiatus since 2008, is reuniting for a series of concerts celebrating the 10th anniversary of “Say It Like You Mean It.” The group is playing the 13-track album from start to finish at the shows, which include hometown dates at the Electric Factory Wednesday and Sunday.\n\nThe band starts the shows by reading the Allmusic review onstage, a write-up the guys can laugh about now.\n\n“None of us had any idea the record would do as well as it did,” says Watts, 33, a Churchville native now living in Manhattan and working as a band manager for Advanced Alternative Media. “We were just friends writing music in (singer) Kenny’s (Vasoli) basement, and for whatever reason, the songs resonated with a lot of people. It was the right record at the right time.”\n\nIt helped that the band members — Watts, singer/bassist Vasoli of Hatboro, guitarist Mike Golla of Warminster and drummer Tom Gryskiewicz of Croydon — were the same age as or only a few years older than their largely teenage fan base. But mostly it was the album itself, expertly produced by veteran soundman Mark Trombino (Blink-182, Jimmy Eat World) and featuring explosive, relatable songs about young love and heartbreak, including a bona fide pop-punk anthem in “The Best Of Me.”\n\nThe Starting Line wasn’t an overnight success story; the band had been around for three years before the release of “Say It Like You Mean It,” making its reception that much sweeter.\n\n“It’s been long enough where we can really appreciate that album, and where we were as a band and as people when we were creating that record,” Watts says. “It brings us back to being 20 years old and writing stuff together. It’s a really great feeling to share that sense of nostalgia with the fans.”\n\nThe band’s relationship with the songs on “Say It Like You Mean It” wasn’t always so cozy, though. Over the course of subsequent, major-label releases “Based on a True Story” (2005) and “Direction” (2007), The Starting Line tried to distance itself from its early days.\n\n“Five years ago, we thought we had progressed as musicians and artists and we didn’t embrace the first record as much,” Watts says. “We felt we had grown, and people should appreciate the more-mature sound. It’s something all bands go through.\n\n“But now, we’re so far removed from the material, we can look back at ‘Say It Like You Mean It’ and really be proud of it.”\n\nAt the same time, the guys can act like they’re kids again.\n\nWhile Vasoli continues to perform in the Philly band Vacationer (a group Watts manages), the rest of the guys have full-time day jobs, revisiting their rock-star days only occasionally over the last four years.\n\n“It’s completely surreal to be back onstage again,” Watts says, “almost awkward for a song or two. It’s like an out-of-body experience.”\n\nThe musicians aren’t the only ones reliving their youth. Watts notes that in Los Angeles earlier this month, the guys had to stop the show for about 20 minutes while a fan too old to be crowd-surfing injured himself doing just that.\n\n“The kids are all legal now, drinking in the back of the room,” he says. “But they get to act like they’re 16 and 17, crowd-surfing even though they’re too old. OK, we’re not 16 anymore. But for one night, the kids can certainly act like that.”\n\nThe fact that the band members can look into the crowd and see some of the same faces who have been following them for 10 years or longer is a reassuring feeling, Watts says. Of course, those same fans would love to see The Starting Line get back together on a more-permanent basis, but that doesn’t appear likely.\n\n“I still consider us on hiatus,” Watts says. “But it’s been great to play these shows. We really enjoy being around each other again.\n\n“I don’t think any of us are in a place to do this full-time again, but if or when we decide to focus on new music, it would be fun to do shows like this again behind a new record.”\n\nFor now, though, four guys who began making music together as teens (plus keyboardist Brian Schmutz of Lansdale, who joined the band in 2005) are having a blast revisiting the songs that made them rock stars.\n\n“We started this band with the intention of playing one show,” Watts says. “If it ended there, it would have been cool.”\n\nMore than a decade later, the story isn’t over yet.\n\nThe Starting Line perform Wednesday with The Wonder Years and Sunday (sold out) with Fake Problems at the Electric Factory at Seventh and Willow streets in Philadelphia. Show times: 8 p.m. Tickets: $25. Information: 800-745-3000; www.ticketmaster.com."
