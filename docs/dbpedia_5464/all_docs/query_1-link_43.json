        "text": "Leading up to today’s release of Taylor Swift’s 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, many fans theorized it would be largely about her breakup with Joe Alwyn, the boyfriend of six years she split from just as she began her record-smashing Eras Tour. However, with the album finally out (including 15 additional tracks that appear on a surprise double-album edition, called The Anthology), it’s clear many of the songs are actually about Swift’s whirlwind relationship with Matty Healy, frontman of British pop-rock band the 1975.\n\nAll throughout The Tortured Poets Department, Swift seems to be revisiting her brief dalliance with Healy, and there are Easter eggs and clues to spare. Ahead, we break down all the evidence that points to Healy being the inspiration, but you can decide for yourself by listening to each track and reading the full lyrics below.\n\n“The Tortured Poets Department”\n\nTo begin, let’s take a look at the album’s title track, “The Tortured Poets Department.” Once thought to be an allusion to a group chat among Alwyn and fellow actors Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott, this now seems likely to be a reference to Healy.\n\nThe most obvious indication is in the lines “I scratch your head, you fall asleep / Like a tattooed golden retriever,” as Healy has many tattoos (and Alwyn has none). Then there’s the already-viral lyric “You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate / We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist.” In 2018, Healy tweeted about his love for Puth: “That Charlie Puth and Boyz II Men track is harrrrrd,” he posted (seemingly in reference to the song “If You Leave Me Now”).\n\nMeanwhile, typewriters have been a motif throughout the promotion and rollout of the new album, and another line from the title track goes: “You left your typewriter at my apartment / Straight from the Tortured Poets Department.” Fans were quick to dig up a video of Healy from 2018, in which he tells GQ about his love of the vintage machines. “I really like typewriters as well. I don’t have one with me because that is really impractical,” he says. “And the thing is with typewriters and writing with pen to paper, there’s a kind of element of commitment that goes with the ceremony of it—therefore, it requires you to concentrate a bit better.”\n\nYou left your typewriter at my apartment\n\nStraight from the Tortured Poets Department\n\nI think some things I never say\n\nLike, “Who uses typewriters anyway?”\n\nBut you’re in self-sabotage mode\n\nThrowing spikes down on the road\n\nBut I’ve seen this episode and still love the show\n\nWho else decodes you?\n\nAnd who’s gonna hold you like me?\n\nAnd who’s gonna know you, if not me?\n\nI laughed in your face and said\n\n“You’re not Dylan Thomas, I’m not Patti Smith\n\nThis ain’t the Chelsea Hotel, we’rе modern idiots”\n\nAnd who’s gonna hold you like me?\n\nNobody\n\nNo-fucking-body\n\nNobody\n\nYou smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate\n\nWe declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist\n\nI scratch your head, you fall asleep\n\nLike a tattooed golden retriever\n\nBut you awaken with dread\n\nPounding nails in your head\n\nBut I’ve read this one where you come undone\n\nI chose this cyclone with you\n\nAnd who’s gonna hold you like me?\n\n(Who’s gonna hold you? Who’s gonna hold you?)\n\nAnd who’s gonna know you like me?\n\n(Who’s gonna hold you?)\n\nI laughed in your face and said\n\n“You’re not Dylan Thomas, I’m not Patti Smith\n\nThis ain’t the Chelsea Hotel, we’re modern idiots”\n\nAnd who’s gonna hold you like me?\n\n(Who’s gonna hold you? Who’s gonna hold you?)\n\nNobody\n\n(Who’s gonna hold you? Who’s gonna hold you?)\n\nNo-fucking-body\n\n(Who’s gonna hold you? Gonna know you? Gonna hold you?)\n\nNobody\n\nSometimes, I wonder if you’re gonna screw this up with me\n\nBut you told Lucy you’d kill yourself if I ever leave\n\nAnd I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen\n\nEveryone we know understands why it’s meant to be\n\n’Cause we’re crazy\n\nSo tell me, who else is gonna know me?\n\nAt dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger\n\nAnd put it on the one people put wedding rings on\n\nAnd that’s the closest I’ve come to my heart exploding\n\nWho’s gonna hold you? (Who?) Me\n\nWho’s gonna know you? (Who?) Me\n\nAnd you’re not Dylan Thomas, I’m not Patti Smith\n\nThis ain’t the Chelsea Hotel, we’re two idiots\n\nWho’s gonna hold you?\n\nWho’s gonna hold you?\n\nWho’s gonna hold you?\n\nWho’s gonna hold you?\n\nWho’s gonna hold you?\n\nWho’s gonna hold you?\n\nWho’s gonna hold you?\n\nWho’s gonna hold you?\n\nGonna know you? Gonna hold you?\n\nYou left your typewriter at my apartment\n\nStraight from the Tortured Poets Department\n\nWho else decodes you?\n\n“But Daddy I Love Him”\n\nBut the references don’t stop there. In “But Daddy I Love Him”—the title is a cheeky nod to a line from The Little Mermaid—the pop singer sings about the public scrutiny of her relationship with Healy: “ ‘Stay away from her,’ the saboteurs / Protested too much / Lord knows the words we never heard / Just screeching tires of true love.”\n\nI forget how the West was won\n\nI forget if this was ever fun\n\nI just learned these people only raise you\n\nTo cage you\n\nSarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best\n\nClutchin’ their pearls, sighing, “What a mess”\n\nI just learned these people try and save you\n\n’Cause they hate you\n\nToo high in a horse for a simple girl\n\nTo rise above it\n\nThey slammed the door on my whole world\n\nThe one thing I wanted\n\nNow I’m runnin’ with my dress unbuttoned\n\nScrеamin’, “But Daddy, I love him\n\nI’m havin’ his baby”\n\nNo, I’m not, but you should see your faces\n\nI’m tellin’ him to floor it through thе fences\n\nNo, I’m not coming to my senses\n\nI know he’s crazy, but he’s the one I want\n\nDutiful daughter, all my plans were laid\n\nTendrils tucked into a woven braid\n\nGrowin’ up precocious sometimes means\n\nNot growin’ up at all\n\nHe was chaos, he was revelry\n\nBedroom eyes like a remedy\n\nSoon enough the elders had convened\n\nDown at the city hall\n\n“Stay away from her,” the saboteurs\n\nProtested too much\n\nLord knows the words we never heard\n\nJust screeching tires of true love\n\nAnd now I’m runnin’ with my dress unbuttoned\n\nScreamin’, “But Daddy, I love him\n\nI'm havin’ his baby”\n\nNo, I’m not, but you should see your faces\n\nI’m tellin’ him to floor it through the fences\n\nNo, I’m not coming to my senses\n\nI know he’s crazy, but he’s the one I want\n\nI’ll tell you somethin’ right now\n\nI’d rather burn my whole life down\n\nThan listen to one more second of all this bitchin’ and moanin’\n\nI’ll tell you somethin’ ’bout my good name\n\nIt’s mine alone to disgrace\n\nI don’t cater to all these vipers dressed in empath’s clothing\n\nGod save the most judgmental creeps\n\nWho say they want what’s best for me\n\nSanctimoniously performing soliloquies I’ll never see\n\nThinkin’ it can change the beat\n\nOf my heart when he touches me\n\nAnd counteract the chemistry and undo the destiny\n\nYou ain’t gotta pray for me\n\nMe and my wild boy, and all of his wild joy\n\nIf all you want is pray for me\n\nThat’s just white noise, that’s just my choice\n\nThere’s a lot of people in town that\n\nI bestow upon my fakest smiles\n\nScandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer\n\nWe came back when the heat died down\n\nWent to my parents and they came around\n\nAll the wine moms are still holdin’ out, but fuck ’em, it’s over\n\nNow I’m dancin’ in my dress in the sun and\n\nEven my daddy just loves him\n\nI’m his lady\n\nAnd oh my God, you should see your faces\n\nTime, doesn’t it give some perspective?\n\nAnd no, you can’t come to the weddin’\n\nI know it’s crazy, but he’s the one I want\n\nI’ll tell you somethin’ right now\n\nYou ain’t gotta pray for me\n\nMe and my wild boy, and all of his wild joy\n\n(He was chaos, he was revelry)\n\nIf all you want is pray for me\n\nThat’s just white noise, that’s just my choice\n\nScreamin’, “But Daddy, I love him\n\nI’m having his baby”\n\nNo, I’m not, but you should see your faces\n\nBut oh my God, you should see your faces\n\n(He was chaos, he was revelry)\n\n(He was chaos, he was revelry)\n\n“Fresh Out the Slammer”\n\nIn “Fresh Out the Slammer,” Swift compares ending a long-term relationship, presumably with Alwyn, to emerging from a stint in prison. With her newfound freedom, she knows exactly whom she plans to rebound with. As she sings in the first verse, “Now, pretty baby / I’m runnin’ back home to you / Fresh out the slammer / I know who my first call will be to.”\n\n“I’m runnin’ back home to you” may suggest that Healy and Swift had a romantic connection before her relationship with Alwyn, as Swifties have long speculated.\n\nNow, pretty baby\n\nI’m runnin’ back home to you\n\nFresh out the slammer\n\nI know who my first call will be to\n\n(Fresh out the slammer, oh)\n\nAnother summer, takin’ cover, rolling thunder\n\nHe don’t understand me\n\nSplintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter\n\nHe was with her in dreams\n\nGray and blue and fights and tunnels\n\nHandcuffed to the spell I was under\n\nFor just one hour of sunshine\n\nYears of labor, locks and ceilings\n\nIn the shade of how he was feeling\n\nBut it’s gonna be alright, I did my time\n\nNow, pretty baby\n\nI’m runnin’ back home to you\n\nFrеsh out the slammer\n\nI know who my first call will be to\n\n(Frеsh out the slammer, oh)\n\nCamera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches\n\nToss the ashes off the ledge\n\nAs I said in my letters, now that I know better\n\nI will never lose my baby again\n\nMy friends tried, but I wouldn’t hear it\n\nWatch me daily disappearing\n\nFor just one glimpse of his smile\n\nAll those nights, he kept me goin’\n\nSwirled you into all of my poems\n\nNow we’re at the starting line, I did my time\n\nNow, pretty baby\n\nI’m runnin’\n\nTo the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)\n\nTo the one who says I’m the girl of his American dreams\n\nAnd no matter what I’ve done, it wouldn’t matter anyway\n\nAin’t no way I’m gonna screw up now that I know what’s at stake here\n\nAt the park where we used to sit on children’s swings\n\nWearing imaginary rings\n\nBut it’s gonna be all right, I did my time\n\n“Guilty As Sin?”\n\nThen there’s “Guilty as Sin?” in which Swift sings about getting pulled into a relationship because of lust. The beginning starts off with a reference to the band the Blue Nile, which Healy has referenced as his favorite group of all time.\n\nThe song describes Swift’s fantasies about a potential paramour, though the lyrics imply\n\nshe has not yet acted on her desires: “My bed sheets are ablaze / I’ve screamed his name / Buildin’ up like waves crashin’ over my grave / Without ever touchin’ his skin / How can I be guilty as sin?”\n\nIn the bridge, she weighs the pros and cons of giving in to her lust, despite what the public may think of her in the aftermath: “They’re gonna crucify me anyway / What if the way you hold me is actually what’s holy? / If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me / They don’t know how you've haunted me so stunningly / I choose you and me religiously.”\n\nDrownin’ in the Blue Nile\n\nHe sent me “Downtown Lights”\n\nI hadn’t heard it in a while\n\nMy boredom’s bone deep\n\nThis cage was once just fine\n\nAm I allowed to cry?\n\nI dream of crackin’ locks\n\nThrowin’ my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks\n\nCrashin’ into him tonight, he’s a paradox\n\nI’m seeing visions\n\nAm I bad or mad or wise?\n\nWhat if he’s written “Mine” on my upper thigh only in my mind?\n\nI’m slippin’, fallin’ back into the hedge maze\n\nOh, what a way to die\n\nI keep recalling things we never did\n\nMessy top lip kiss, how I long for our trips\n\nWithout ever touchin’ his skin\n\nHow can I be guilty as sin?\n\nI keep these longings locked\n\nIn lowеrcase inside a vault\n\nSomeonе told me, “There’s no such thing as bad thoughts\n\nOnly your actions talk”\n\nThese fatal fantasies\n\nGiving way to labored breath takin’ all of me\n\nWe’ve already done it in my head, if it’s make-believe\n\nWhy does it feel like a vow we’ll both uphold somehow?\n\nWhat if he’s written “Mine” on my upper thigh only in my mind?\n\nI’m slippin’, fallin’ back into the hedge maze\n\nOh, what a way to die\n\nMy bed sheets are ablaze\n\nI’ve screamed his name\n\nBuildin’ up like waves crashin’ over my grave\n\nWithout ever touchin’ his skin\n\nHow can I be guilty as sin?\n\nWhat if I roll the stone away?\n\nThey’re gonna crucify me anyway\n\nWhat if the way you hold me is actually what’s holy?\n\nIf long-suffering propriety is what they want from me\n\nThey don’t know how you’ve haunted me so stunningly\n\nI choose you and me religiously\n\nWhat if he’s written “Mine” on my upper thigh only in my mind?\n\nI’m slippin’, fallin’ back into the hedge maze\n\nOh, what a way to die\n\nI keep recalling things we never did\n\nMessy top lip kiss, how I long for our trips\n\nWithout ever touchin’ his skin\n\nHow can I be guilty as sin?\n\nHe sent me “Downtown Lights”\n\nI hadn’t heard it in a while\n\nAm I allowed to cry?\n\n“I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)”\n\nIn “I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can),” Swift takes aim at her partner’s bad-boy reputation. Tellingly, the first verse hints at Healy’s history of disturbing behavior, which her fans loudly disapproved of: “The jokes that he told across the bar / Were revolting and far too loud.”\n\nDespite this, Swift repeatedly tells herself that she “can fix him.” In the second verse, she sings, “I could see it from a mile away / A perfect case for my certain skill set / He had a halo of the highest gradе / He just hadn’t met me yеt.”\n\nBut by the end of the track, Swift has reconsidered, admitting that “maybe I can’t.”\n\nThe smoke cloud billows out his mouth\n\nLike a freight train through a small town\n\nThe jokes that he told across the bar\n\nWere revolting and far too loud\n\nThey shake their heads sayin’, “God, help her”\n\nWhen I tell ’em he’s my man\n\nBut your good Lord doesn’t need to lift a finger\n\nI can fix him, no, really, I can\n\nAnd only I can\n\nThe dopamine races through his brain\n\nOn a six-lane Texas highway\n\nHis hands so calloused from his pistol\n\nSoftly traces hearts on my face\n\nAnd I could see it from a mile away\n\nA perfect case for my certain skill set\n\nHe had a halo of the highest gradе\n\nHe just hadn’t met me yеt\n\nThey shake their heads sayin’, “God, help her”\n\nWhen I tell ’em he’s my man\n\nBut your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger\n\nI can fix him, no, really, I can\n\nAnd only I can\n\nGood boy, that’s right, come close\n\nI’ll show you Heaven if you’ll be an angel, all mine\n\nTrust me, I can handle me a dangerous man\n\nNo really, I can\n\nThey shook their heads sayin’, “God, help her”\n\nWhen I told ’em he’s my man (I told ’em he’s my man)\n\nBut your good Lord didn’t need to lift a finger\n\nI can fix him, no, really, I can (No, really, I can)\n\nWoah, maybe I can’t\n\n“The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived”\n\nSwift contemplates a relationship after it has ended in “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,” second-guessing the strength of her partner’s bond with her. The first clue the song is about Healy comes in the first verse, in which she sings about his “Jehovah’s Witness suit,” likely a jab at the suits Healy and his 1975 bandmates often perform in. She suggests the relationship met its end after her partner ghosted her: “You tried to buy some pills / From a friend of friends of mine / They just ghosted you / Now you know what it feels like.”\n\nThe chorus indicates the time period during which Swift and Healy had allegedly started dating, with the two first going public around in May 2023: “And I don’t even want you back, I just want to know / If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal.”\n\nWas any of it true?\n\nGazing at me starry-eyed\n\nIn your Jehovah’s Witness suit\n\nWho the fuck was that guy?\n\nYou tried to buy some pills\n\nFrom a friend of friends of mine\n\nThey just ghosted you\n\nNow you know what it feels like\n\nAnd I don’t even want you back, I just want to know\n\nIf rusting my sparkling summer was the goal\n\nAnd I don’t miss what we had, but could someone give\n\nA message to the smallest man who ever lived?\n\nYou hung me on your wall\n\nStabbed me with your push pins\n\nIn public, showed me off\n\nThen sank in stoned oblivion\n\n’Cause once your queen had come\n\nYou’d treat her likе an also-ran\n\nYou didn’t measure up\n\nIn any measurе of a man\n\nAnd I don’t even want you back, I just want to know\n\nIf rusting my sparkling summer was the goal\n\nAnd I don’t miss what we had, but could someone give\n\nA message to the smallest man who ever lived?\n\nWere you sent by someone who wanted me dead?\n\nDid you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?\n\nWere you writin’ a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?\n\nIn fifty years, will all this be declassified?\n\nAnd you’ll confess why you did it and I’ll say, “Good riddance”\n\n’Cause it wasn’t sexy once it wasn’t forbidden\n\nI would’ve died for your sins, instead, I just died inside\n\nAnd you deserve prison, but you won’t get time\n\nYou’ll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars\n\nYou crashed my party and your rental car\n\nYou said normal girls were boring\n\nBut you were gone by the morning\n\nYou kicked out the stage lights, but you’re still performing\n\nAnd in plain sight you hid\n\nBut you are what you did\n\nAnd I’ll forget you, but I’ll never forgive\n\nThe smallest man who ever lived\n\n“The Black Dog”\n\nWhile some fans initially speculated that the “The Black Dog” referenced Alwyn, the current overwhelming consensus seems to agree that it actually is another song about Healy.\n\nThe most damning evidence about the track's subject lies in the second verse: “When someone plays ‘The Starting Line’ and you jump up / But she's too young to know this song / That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming / Old habits die screaming.”\n\nHealy covered 2000s band The Starting Line during a 1975 concert on May 3, 2023—tellingly, the same concert Healy mouthed onstage, “This one is about you. You know who you are. I love you.” Days later, at Swift's Nashville show during the U.S. leg of the Eras Tour, she mouthed the same phrase, an act that seemingly confirmed their rumored romance.\n\nThe verse also hints at Healy's young romantic interests following his split from Swift, from his brief reconciliation with ex-girlfriend Meredith Mickelson, 24, in August 2023 to his current relationship with model Gabriette Bechtel, 26. At 35 years old, Healy shares a nearly 10-year age gap with both Mickelson and Bechtel."
