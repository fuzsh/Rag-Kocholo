Maurten Gels use patented Hydrogel Technology that enables smooth transportation of carbohydrates through the stomach during high-intensity exercise, reducing discomfort.\n\nMEDICAL SUPPORT\n\nMedical support is available at 22 on-course locations: medical tents are located at all 20 aid stations with additional medical tents located between Mile 14 and Mile 15 and in the final mile. Medical tents are indicated by tall, red, blade signs with the medical icon. Each medical tent is staffed by a team of medical professionals equipped with medical supplies and equipment, and has access to ambulance service.\n\nIn Grant Park, the Main Medical Tent, Podiatry Tent and Ice Station are located directly beyond the finish line. An additional medical tent is in Grant Park adjacent to the 27th Mile Post-Race Party. For the safety of all participants, only those requiring medical assistance may access the medical facilities. If you feel like you need medical assistance on race day, you are encouraged to seek help from a medical volunteer or to visit a medical tent in Grant Park or on course.\n\nLend a hand, save a life! Participants, volunteers and event staff are encouraged to watch an instructional Hands-Only CPR video. This training is critical and can be lifesaving.\n\nCOURSE TIME LIMIT\n\nThe Bank of America Chicago Marathon has a course time limit of 6 hours and 30 minutes. After this time, the course will re-open to vehicular traffic. You must maintain a 15-minute per mile pace (approximately) or faster, completing the full marathon distance—start line to finish line—within the event time requirement. Participants outside of the time limit may not be recorded or published as official finishers and may not receive full on-course support from aid stations and traffic safety personnel.\n\nCLOCKS & MILE MARKERS\n\nTiming checkpoints are positioned at the start line, at each 5K, at the halfway point (13.1 miles) and at the finish line. Your MYLAPS BibTag timing device will register split times at each of these checkpoints.\n\nDigital clocks are positioned at the start line, throughout the course and at the finish line to provide the elapsed race time. Mile and kilometer markers are positioned at each mile and 5K to assist you in locating the clocks. Digital clocks at the finish line will display the elapsed race time, which begins with the official race start time. Your individual race time may differ depending on when you cross the official start line.\n\nPROHIBITED DEVICES ON COURSE\n\nWheeled devices are not permitted on the Bank of America Chicago Marathon course by anyone other than a registered and authorized wheelchair, handcycle and duo team participants.
