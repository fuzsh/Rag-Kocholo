        "text": "Back to the Starting Line\n\nWords by: Zoe Marquedant\n\nThere have been rumors: The Starting Line might be getting back together. They might be writing a new CD. But was any of it true? Now it is. The band’s ladman Kenny Vasoli confirmed at The Starting Line’s annual holiday show in Philadelphia that they would be releasing new music 2015. If that wasn’t enough evidence, the band’s Facebook message about the concert included the message: “we’ll see you in 2015!”\n\nIn case you missed the Drive-Thru boat and only know Vasoli as the guy from Vacationer, here are five releases from The Starting Line that you need to hear before their new album:\n\n1. With Hopes of Starting Over\n\nThe band’s debut EP came out in 2001 off of Drive-Thru Records. Tracks like “Three’s A Charm” and the EP version of “Leaving” make it a sweet, heartbreaking and strong first listen. Hunt down a digital copy of “Song for Her,” which was added to the track listing via the band’s Purevolume after the EP released. It’s a young Vasoli at his best.\n\n2. Say It Like You Mean It\n\nThe band’s second release with Drive-Thru is a personal favorite. Vasoli’s sweet and occasionally cheeky lyrics are set to a backdrop of good ol’ fashioned pop punk power chords. “Left Coast Envy,” “The Drama Summer” and “The Best of Me” are quintessential Starting Line and it’s the record that will win you over.\n\n3. Based On A True Story\n\nAfter being signed to Geffen Records, The Starting Line released this their second full length.\n\nThe album ranges from bitter (“Surprise, Surprise”) to saucy (“Bedroom Talk”) to sentimental (“Photograph.”) It’s a more refined sound compared to Say It Like You Mean It, but songs like “Autography” prove that it’s definitely still The Starting Line. They’re just experimenting with a new sound.\n\n4. Direction\n\nThis CD is perhaps the band’s biggest departure from their sound. “Direction” is way heavier than past tracks like “Up & Go.” The band returns to their previous formula a bit with “21” and seem to find a midground with the love song “Island.” You may not start out liking it, but Direction is the release you learn to love.\n\n5. Somebody’s Gonna Miss Us\n\nThis complication of sorts accompanied the documentary/live recording Somebody’s Gonna Miss Us, which detailed the band’s career up until their final show at Bamboozle 2008. Whether you’re catching up on your favorite band from middle school or new to the fanbase, it’s all you need. It’s the SparkNotes version of The Starting Line with tracks from all their releases, like “Are You Alone” and “Almost There, Going Nowhere.”"
