        "text": "For those who are completing the live Baltimore 2024 half marathon, here’s what you can expect:\n\nThe half-marathon start line is a party on the shores of Baltimore’s famed Inner Harbor, the 13-mile mark of the marathon. Complete with a live band and 10,000 of your new best friends, this unique set up allows for the fastest marathoners and those attempting to qualify for Boston to pass and assures that the marathon champion will be the first to cross the finish line for the LIVE television coverage on WBAL-TV. The half-marathon will run its own course for the first 3 miles and merge with marathon at Patterson Park. From that point, marathoners and half-marathon participants will run the same course to the finish line in Baltimore’s famed and iconic Inner Harbor!\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1) Participants in the Half-Marathon must be at least 13 years old\n\n2) Participants must be able to complete the course in 5 hours (22:54 min/mile pace)\n\nThose who participate virtually, will have the option to run their own course wherever they chose! For more information on running virtually, visit HERE\n\nWalkers: Walkers are welcome to participate in the CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield Half-Marathon. Please be advised of the following:\n\nWalkers will start at the back of the field in wave 5. If you plan to walk but have not been assigned to this wave, please start here anyway.\n\nWalkers must complete the half marathon course in the 5-hour time limit (22:54 min/mile pace). Any walker who does not keep this maximum pace throughout the race will have the option of 1) getting on the SAG vehicle to return to the Inner Harbor or 2) or finishing the course off the road and on the sidewalks as a pedestrian.\n\nAs a courtesy to runner participants, we ask that walkers not be more than two abreast so runners can easily pass.\n\nWave Start: In order to maintain a comfortable and safe race experience for all participants, the CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield Half Marathon uses a wave start. Bib numbers will be issued based on expected finish time and will correspond to the holding pen you have been assigned. There will be five (5) holding pens and we ask that all participants adhere to this policy and start with their assigned wave. Please keep in mind that with the B-Tag system, your time will not start until you cross the start line.\n\nCharity Groups: The Baltimore Running Festival welcomes charity groups to utilize the event to fund raise and raise awareness of their cause. For more information on charity groups and the requirements involved, visit our Run for a Cause page or email [email protected].\n\nPacket Pick Up\n\nLive participants will be given the option to have their race bibs mailed to them in order to limit travel and personal exposure. All you have to do is cover the postage and handling fees. This option is offered as an add on during registration.\n\nAll live runners who do not pay for the mailing option are required to pick up their packets at our one-day Health & Fitness Expo held on Friday prior to race day. The expo is located at the Baltimore Convention Center. For more details, click here.\n\nTHERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO RACE DAY PACKET PICK UP. Please plan accordingly.\n\nRunners participating virtually will automatically get their packet mailed to them and WILL NOT be permitted to claim their packet during the expo.\n\nChip Timing\n\nThe event will continue to utilize the best timing technology available. The B-tag technology offers runners a streamlined race experience with timing tags attached to participant bib. This method eliminates the need to scan your chip at the expo or to return the chip following the race, which means no more sitting down to undo your shoe lace just after your run and you no longer have to worry about a charge for a lost chip.\n\nTips to have your time accurately recorded:\n\nRace bib is clearly visible on the front of the torso\n\nRace bib is unaltered and unmodified (do not fold or wrinkle)\n\nRace bib is pinned in all four corners\n\nRace bib is not covered (jackets, runner belts, water bottles, etc.)\n\nVirtual Runners: All virtual runners will be self-timed. You will have the opportunity to print a race bib and report your finish time into the official race results.\n\nCourse Nutrition\n\nGatorade Endurance Formula (Lemon-Lime flavor) will be served on the course and at the finish line of this year’s race. Gatorade Endurance Formula is a specialized sports drink that contains approximately twice the amount of sodium (200 mg per 8 ounces) of Gatorade Thirst Quencher, along with chloride, potassium, magnesium and calcium to help sustain hydration by more fully replacing what is lost in sweat. Gatorade Endurance Formula also contains a 6% carbohydrate solution (14 grams per 8 ounces), just like Gatorade Thirst Quencher, which research shows is optimal to help speed fluid back into the body and fuel working muscles. Gatorade Endurance Formula is available in 34 ounce and 24 ounce sport bottles at major grocery and convenience stores nationwide, and Gatorade Endurance Formula powder is available at specialty athletic stores and at www.gatorade.com/endurance."
