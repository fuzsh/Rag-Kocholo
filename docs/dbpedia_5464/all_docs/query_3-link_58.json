        "text": "The Starting Line Group was a coalition of more than 400 non-governmental actors, from across the European Union, active in the field of anti-discrimination, active from 1990 to 2000.\n\nThe Group based its activities on the belief that a well-informed policy debate among and between representatives of all sectors of society – public, private, and business – could lead to the adoption of effective European anti-discrimination policies.\n\nTo promote such a debate, the Group drafted its own proposals for a Directive, the Starting Line, which received the support of many organisations across the expanding European Union. In the policy debates governmental and European institutions often referred to the Starting Line Group and took its proposals into consideration."
