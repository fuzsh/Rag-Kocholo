        "text": "EAU CLAIRE, Wis. (WEAU) - It was a busy day in the Chippewa Valley Wednesday as the Trump-Vance and Harris-Walz campaigns both made stops in Eau Claire.\n\nThe Vice President arrived to the Chippewa Valley Regional Airport around 12:30 PM, and one of the first people to greet her on the tarmac was Eau Claire City Council President Emily Berge.\n\n“All eyes are on Eau Claire and it’s really cool because Eau Claire is great, and it’s really fun to show off our city and our region,” Berge said.\n\nAfter meeting a local girl scout troop, it was off to the Eau Claire Event District where thousands of supporters gathered to hear from the newly established Harris-Walz ticket.\n\nMeanwhile on the west side of Eau Claire, Republican Vice Presidential nominee JD Vance spoke with supporters before making a local stop to enjoy some Olson’s Ice Cream.\n\nThe VP also making a stop at a local business, with her and her VP pick visiting The Local Store, causing quite the stir for owner Nick Meyer.\n\n“They bought some cheese curds, and some local honey, and some records from local musicians, and just chatted with a few people, hung out, and took off,” Meyer recalled. “It was a whirlwind of excitement, of press and media, and Secret Service.”\n\nIt was a day that put the spotlight squarely on Eau Claire, and more broadly the Chippewa Valley, as a focal point for both campaigns.\n\n“It’s incredible that both campaigns are paying attention to what’s happening in this city and the voters of our community, and they know how important Wisconsin is overall,” Meyer said.\n\n“I do think a lot of political campaigns eye up Eau Claire, so kind of all eyes are on Eau Claire because they see it could go either way,” Berge added. “I’ve heard that the path to the White House goes through Eau Claire, which is pretty amazing.”\n\nWith less than 90 days until Election Day, Berge wouldn’t be surprised to see more political events come through the Eau Claire area over the next few months."
