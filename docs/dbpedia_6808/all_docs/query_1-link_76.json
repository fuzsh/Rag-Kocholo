        "text": "Set in the late 15th century during the reign of King Yeonsan, two male street clowns and tightrope walkers, Jangsaeng and Gong-gil, are part of an entertainer troupe. Their manager prostitutes the beautiful Gong-gil to rich customers, and Jangsaeng is sickened by this practice. After Gong-gil kills the manager in defense of Jangsaeng, the pair flee to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers.\n\nHigh school senior, Jayo is seduced into his first sexual experience by classmate Hara, who eventually kills herself when he ignores her. Since then, he immerses himself in loveless sex until he meets cheerful nurse, Namok. Meanwhile, his pal Seuin has developed a crush on his teacher, which is socially taboo.\n\nAfter being dumped by her boyfriend just before their 100-day anniversary, Ha-young meets a college guy named Hyung-joon when she kicks a can that accidentally hits him in the face and causes him to scratch his Lexus. He demands she pay him $3000 on the spot.\n\nJi-hae's friend is having problems expressing her feelings to the boy she loves, so she asks Ji-hae to write e-mails to him in her name. As the boy falls in love with her letters, Ji-hae discovers the story of her mother's romance which is remarkably similar to her own circumstances.\n\nIn the gloomy 80s, Sang-ho is wanted by the authorities for his participation in the student movement. Parting with his colleagues, Sang-ho happens to end up in a town on the outskirts, a town he has no connection to. The place where he is in hiding is the second floor of a worn down wooden house. Spending his time idly in the room, one day, Sang-ho discovers a hole looking into the room downstairs by chance. Casually looking through the hole, Sang-ho exhales. At first, Sang-ho tries to avoid looking, out of guilt. However, before he knows it, he is drawn to the hole. Every gesture she makes is very captivating and seductive. He watches her body, feels her, and takes her into his heart."
