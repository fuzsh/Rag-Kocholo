        "text": "AbstractThe problem of evil is not only a logical problem about God's goodness but also an existential problem about the sense of God's presence, which the Biblical book of Job conceives as a problem of aesthetic experience. Thus, just as theism can be grounded in religious experience, atheism can be grounded in experience of evil. This phenomenon is illustrated by two contrasting literary descriptions of aesthetic experience by Jean-Paul Sartre and Annie Dillard. I illuminate both of these literary texts with a discussion of the 18th Century philosopher Lord Shaftesbury's concept of ‘enthusiasm’.\n\nThis paper analyzes how South Korean (SK), evangelical media discuss two outgroup categories: North Korea and homosexuality. Analysis of SK media over two decades-mainly longitudinal analysis of evangelical newspaper Kidok Sinmun (1998-2019) generates several findings. First, homosexuality is catching up to North Korea as the leading outgroup in SK Christian discourse. Second, both outgroups are subjects of dual, competing narratives: one (threat) frames outgroups, and their supporters , as threats to the liberties and/or values of Christians; another (outreach), as subjects of Christian love and personal relationship. The threat and outreach narratives, in turn, are, respectively, associated with right-wing and non-right politics on the out-group. We argue that the dual narratives are shaped by American evangelical culture; cross-national communications (e.g., South Korea and USA); and cross-national events (e.g., presidential elections) that influence the perceived threats posed by, or opportunities to outreach to, outgroup members.\n\nThis thesis argues that Christian bereavement care needs to proceed from a solid biblical foundation in determining the goal (receiving comfort from God), model (by focusing on communion with God), and method of care (through narrative and relationship) to guard against secular influences and to bring soul-satisfying comfort to the bereaved. Chapter 1 introduces the thesis. Chapter 2 critically evaluates contemporary bereavement care approaches. Chapter 3 explores the human experience of grief by examining autobiographical narratives and God’s account of the origin of grief in the Genesis narrative. Chapter 4 develops the argument for a theocentric and Christocentric approach. A proposed bereavement care framework is derived from the way Jesus relates to the bereaved and God. Chapter 5 offers practical guidelines on caring for the bereaved using eight relational steps. Chapter 6 concludes by drawing together the arguments to demonstrate how employing narrative in Christian bereavement care effectively connects the bereaved with the heart of God.\n\nThe viewer’s experience of Malick’s cinema can be arguably approached from the notion of dwelling. As Toles points out, the essence of this dwelling derives from the use of the medium’s capacities to reveal the world as something real. In contrast with earlier films, ‘The Tree of Life’ (2011) opens up the possibility of transcendence by pushing the limits of the world revealed by the film medium: here the world is no more an absolute presence, but the visible sign of a further presence, that of its Creator. The chain of revelations is thus expanded: the filmic dwelling holds the world’s presence and, in turn, this screened world points towards God’s presence. In this vein, the image of Jack O’Brien standing at the enigmatic doorframe in the wilderness might well illustrate the experience of the viewer of ‘The Tree of Life’."
