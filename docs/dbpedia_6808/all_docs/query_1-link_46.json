        "text": "Wednesday, May 9, 2007\n\n'Spider-Man 3' entombs Korean prey\n\nSpidey's sticky web turned out to be more lethal than expected for Korean filmmakers. \"Spider-Man 3,\" released here on May 1, entangled and entombed Korean films in the past week. Even \"Thousand Year Crane,\" the 100th film by Im Kwon-taek, crashed helplessly at the box office.\n\nCiting poor ticket reservation data, most local theaters are now planning to stop screening Im's critically acclaimed film this weekend, sparking a dispute about whether a single Hollywood film should be allowed to dominate theaters.\n\n\"Thousand Year Crane\" was released on April 12, securing some 210 screens. Since then, the film sold just shy of 130,000 tickets, falling far short of expectations, especially given that local press splashed rave reviews about director Im's latest movie.\n\nIn contrast, Spidey is casting a wider money-making web in Korea. On the opening day, the American blockbuster started with 617 local screens -- the biggest release scale this year. Given that there are a total of 1,700 theater screens, that means at least one in three screens in Korea showed \"Spider-Man 3.\"\n\nOn the weekend, the number of screens showing the blockbuster increased to 816, pushing other small-budget Korean films out of the theaters. Not only director Im's \"Thousand Year Crane,\" but also other well-made films like \"Adeul (Son)\" by Jang Jin are struggling to survive. The key issue is that audiences have only a few alternatives at this point. Yongsan CGV, an 11-theater multiplex cinema in central Seoul, has set aside eight screens for \"Spider-Man 3.\" Lotte Cinema multiplex near Konkuk University, equipped with 12 screens, allocated six screens to the American movie.\n\nThe favorable screening conditions instantly translated into box-office profit. \"Spider-Man 3\" sold 502,000 tickets on its opening day, eclipsing even the country's biggest hit film \"The Host,\" which grossed 450,000 viewers on its debut.\n\nTicket sales data showed that \"Spider-Man 3\" attracted 2.56 million people in just six days, the second highest box-office record for the opening week after \"The Host.\"\n\nOne of the reasons for the trailblazing performance of \"Spider-Man 3\" is the dearth of Korean blockbusters armed with comparable artistic and commercial appeal. Although \"Milyang (Secret Sunshine),\" directed by former Culture Minister Lee Chang-dong, is expected to be a strong contender at the box office when it gets released on May 24, there are few Korean movies that could compete with American big-budget flicks on an equal footing during the summer season. Despite its own weaknesses, \"Spider-Man 3\" has all the virtues to become a blockbuster that can be enjoyed by mainstream moviegoers.\n\nOutside of Korea, the third installment of the Spidey franchise received some critical reviews for its lengthy running time and disjointed storylines, but its shock and awe special effects are highly attractive for moviegoers who want to have pure fun.\n\nKorean filmmakers have a tougher road ahead. A series of American blockbusters led by \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" and \"Shrek the Third\" are scheduled to hit local theaters in the coming months.\n\nThe destructive power of Hollywood blockbusters has been forgotten in the past couple of years, thanks largely to the heady growth of the local film industry. Last year saw an unprecedented growth in terms of Korean film productions, but the oversupply sparked a backlash this year, resulting in a sharply reduced number of new film projects, particularly big-budget films that also come with a wide nationwide release.\n\nThe dampened investment mood in the local film industry is feared to undermine the quality and diversity of Korean films, which in turn will translate into poorer box-office scores, a spiraling crisis that hit the nation shortly after the industry witnessed the strongest expansion in decades, bolstered by the Korean Wave in Asia.\n\nBy Yang Sung-jin\n\n(insight@heraldm.com)\n\nSource: The Korea Herald\n\nhttps://www.koreaherald.co.kr/SITE/data/htm...00705100008.asp\n\nMay 16, 2007\n\nActress without ambition gets it all\n\n'For the first time in my acting career, I told the director I couldn't do it.'\n\nVersatile actress Jeon Do-youn will attend the Cannes\n\nInternational Film Festival with her latest film, “Secret Sunshine.” By Park Jong-geun\n\nJeon Do-youn is one of the most versatile actors in Korea. From a hillbilly teenager with rustic clothing in “The Harmonium in My Memory” to a housewife who lost her mind as the result of an extramarital affair in “Happy End,” Jeon has moved from one role to another and has become a jewel in the Korean movie scene.\n\nToday, Jeon will be on the red carpet at the Cannes International Film Festival in France, promoting her role in “Secret Sunshine.”\n\nIn an interview before she left for the French resort city to attend one of the world’s most important film festivals, Jeon said she was not that confident about her role in “Secret Sunshine,” in which she plays Sin-ae, a woman who loses her husband in a traffic accident and her son to a kidnapper.\n\nHer character lives in a country town with a name whose Chinese characters mean “Secret Sunshine,” Sin-ae almost finds relief by devoting herself to religion. Yet she loses her faith in God when she confronts the kidnapper of her son, who tells her that he has already been saved by God.\n\n“After reading the script, I felt I could not do it,” Jeon said. “And the director said he appreciated my honesty.” But Jeon eventually decided to accept the role, thinking, “Why don’t I test myself and go beyond my limits?”\n\nIt was not easy. The hardest part was the scene where Sin-ae gets a call from the kidnapper. “For the first time in my acting career, I told the director that I couldn’t do it,” Jeon said. The director understood, waited for her to find her pace and got the scene on film.\n\nJeon doesn’t scream or act crazy. Instead, she swallows her grief. In a scene where Sin-ae leaves the prison after confronting the kidnapper, she simply collapses on the ground. This is director Lee Chang-dong’s way of conveying realism without sympathy. He draws the cruelty of life as it is. “I had this feeling that all the energy went out of me. I was physically awake yet mentally in a coma,” Jeon said, referring to her emotions after shooting the scene.\n\n“Lee doesn’t give much direction, and I was sometimes angry and defiant,” Jeon continued. “Yet I now understand that the director wanted the actors to find answers for themselves.” She said the director’s style helped her stay away from the tried-and-trusted methods she had used in the past.\n\nFilm critics hailed Jeon’s performance. The film is scheduled to open next week, but critics are already giving her rave reviews. One said, “We thought Jeon Do-youn had nothing left to offer. We were wrong.”\n\nLee is sharing in the success, fuelling his comeback to the movie scene after years of serving as the culture minister.\n\nA scene from “Secret Sunshine,”starring Jeon Do-youn.\n\nProvided by the company\n\nSong Gang-ho, who plays a supporting role in “Secret Sunshine,” said, “This film is the best production ever from the director, and it is all about Jeon.”\n\nThe filming went on for five months and Jeon found it physically and emotionally exhausting.\n\nShe coped, in part, because, she met and married her husband. “It was during the final stages of filming that I met my husband and I guess I needed some consoling from the stress of my role in the film,” Jeon said. “I usually go out with a person for at least four seasons to get to know him. But this time, everything went so fast, and I surprised myself.”\n\nJeon describes herself as an “actress without ambitions.” “I didn’t know I would be successful, because I thought I didn’t have what it takes to be an actress,” Jeon said. Her dream was to be a “good wife,” so now she says she has everything ― a great career and a happy married life.\n\nWhat brought her this far?\n\n“I have a strong will and I never want to lose,” she said. “Once I decide to do something, I clench my teeth and fight until I win.”\n\nIn a recent survey by the film magazine Cine 21, Jeon was placed third on a list of best actors. Among actresses, she was number one.\n\nBy Yang Sung-hee JoongAng Ilbo [sujiney@joongang.co.kr]\n\nSource: English JoongAng Daily\n\nhttp://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2875578\n\nMay 16, 2007\n\n'Love affair' with Asia will be felt at Cannes fest\n\nBy Jonathan Landreth\n\nBEIJING -- The influence of Asia will be felt from the moment Wong Kar Wai's \"My Blueberry Nights\" lights the opening-night screen Wednesday at the 60th edition of the Festival de Cannes.\n\nShot in the U.S., the Hong Kong director's English-language debut stars Jude Law and features the acting debut of singer Norah Jones. It joins three other Asian films in the official selection at Cannes.\n\n\"There is definitely some kind of love affair between Cannes and Asian cinema,\" said Christine Pernin, chief China representative of Unifrance, the French government's cultural envoy.\n\nAlso In Competition is \"Breath,\" the 14th film by Kim Ki-duk, one of South Korea's biggest names on the international film festival circuit. \"Breath\" stars Taiwanese actor Chang Chen as a man awaiting execution who falls for a betrayed wife.\n\nAlso from Korea is \"Secret Sunshine,\" by Lee Chang-dong, a former minister of culture and tourism and one of Korea's most respected filmmakers. Lee's 2002 film \"Oasis\" -- about a social misfit who falls in love with a woman with cerebral palsy -- won the FIPRESCI prize and Marcello Mastroianni awards at Venice.\n\nIn \"Secret Sunshine,\" Lee again tackles a challenging subject, the story of a grieving widow who travels to her late husband's hometown only to find that her newfound religious faith fails her when she is struck by another tragedy.\n\nThe lone Japanese entry In Competition comes from director Naomi Kawase, who, at 27, won the Camera d'Or at Cannes in 1997 for her first feature film, \"Moe No Suzaku.\" Kawase is back this year with \"Mogari No Mori\" (The Mourning Forest). Scheduled for a June 23 release in Japan, the film is about the relationship between a young caregiver and her recently widowed elderly ward in a retirement home in the mountains.\n\nThe three Asian films in the Directors' Fortnight sidebar include the debut film of Japanese comedian Hitoshi Matsumoto, \"Dai Nihonjin.\" Ai Inoue, spokeswoman for domestic distributor Phantom Film, describes it as a \"one-of-a-kind comedy.\" \"He didn't want it to be reviewed in the orthodox way,\" she said.\n\nMatsumoto told reporters in January: \"I definitely don't think it's the kind of work that will be winning prizes at Cannes.\"\n\nAlso in Directors' Fortnight are \"Foster Child,\" Filipino director Brillante Mendoza's exploration of international adoption, and the erotic thriller \"Ploy,\" by Pen-ek Ratanaruang of Thailand.\n\nThere are four Asian films in Un Certain Regard sidebar: \"The Red Balloon,\" Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien's take on the classic French children's book; \"Pleasure Factory,\" by Thai helmer Ekachai Uekrongtham, set during one night in the red-light district of Singapore; and two films from mainland China, \"Blind Mountain\" by Li Yang and \"Night Train\" from Diao Yinan.\n\nInternational festivals, including Cannes, always have been politically sensitive for directors from China, who must gain Beijing's approval if they wish to get domestic distribution and avoid being blacklisted. In 2006, Lou Ye was banned from filmmaking in China for five years for taking his film \"Summer Palace\" to Cannes without permission. The film touched on the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing.\n\nPernin said that this year's selection of Chinese-language films came as a surprise to many Asian film fans, as little-known directors got spots at the festival at the expense of such veterans as China's Jiang Wen, who is rushing to finish \"The Sun Also Rises.\"\n\n\"Many people thought the old masters were shoo-ins, but this year's selection shows more diversity,\" Pernin said. \"Perhaps it was timing that worked against some films still in postproduction.\"\n\nA late Out of Competition addition is the police story \"Triangle\" by Hong Kong hitmakers Tsui Hark, Ringo Lam and Johnnie To.\n\nTold in 30-minute segments and starring Hong Kong talent Louis Koo, Simon Yam and Sun Hong Lei, the film will be distributed on the mainland (now key to boosting Hong Kong's flagging local industry) by co-producer Poly Bona, the business arm of China's army.\n\nAs such, \"Triangle\" would have needed to get the Film Bureau's approval to screen at Cannes.\n\nIndustry insiders are watching to see if Beijing's approval of a collaborative and potentially commercial genre film was a one-off marketing decision or a shift in policy inside the notoriously conservative Film Bureau.\n\nMark Russell in Seoul and Julian Ryall in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n\nAsian films at Cannes 2007:\n\nIn Competition:\n\n\"My Blueberry Nights,\" Wong Kar Wai, Hong Kong (opening night)\n\n\"Breath,\" Kim Ki-duk, South Korea\n\n\"Mogari No Mori,\" Naomi Kawase, Japan\n\n\"Secret Sunshine,\" Lee Chang-Dong, South Korea\n\nDirectors' Fortnight\n\n\"Dai Nihonjin,\" Hitoshi Matsumoto, Japan\n\n\"Foster Child,\" Brillante Mendoza, Philippines\n\n\"Ploy,\" Pen-ek Ratanaruang, Thailand\n\nUn Certain Regard:\n\nOpening -- \"The Red Balloon,\" Hou Hsiao-hsien, Taiwan\n\n\"Blind Mountain,\" Li Yang, China\n\n\"Night Train,\" Diao Yinan, China\n\n\"Pleasure Factory,\" Ekachai Uekrongtham, Singapore\n\nShort films:\n\n\"Grandma,\" Anthony Chen, Singapore\n\n\"My Dear Rosetta,\" Hae-hoon Yang, South Korea\n\nSpecial screenings, Out of Competition:\n\n\"He Fengming,\" Wang Bing, China\n\nCritics Week\n\n\"Funukedomo, Kanashimi No Ai Wo Misero,\" Daihachi Yoshida, Japan\n\nSource: The Hollywood Reporter\n\nhttp://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/conten...2b99f85f7a5fa6d\n\nCannes: 'Secret Sunshine', a mysterious journey of faith\n\nBy Joan Dupont Published: May 23, 2007\n\nfrom International Herald Tribune\n\nCANNES:\n\nIt is difficult to picture Lee Chang Dong, the director of \"Secret Sunshine,\" going up the red carpet. Lee, who was minister of culture in Korea, is a shy person and surely the most discreet director at this festival.\n\nHis film, which is in competition, looks quiet too. \"Secret Sunshine\" opens on a fable: a gentle young widow, a piano teacher, goes to a small town with her child. It is her husband's hometown, and the early signs are promising: people seem welcoming, the pharmacist smiles at her, and her small son adapts to his new school.\n\nShe also meets a car mechanic - a lumbering awkward man - who trails her, faithful-dog style.\n\nBut things are not as they seem and her life takes a tragic turn.\n\n\"Secret Sunshine\" is mysterious and terrifying. At times, it feels like a thriller, with surprising twists, but it has a hidden core. It is a story of faith, how it can enter a life, and how it can vanish.\n\n\"I adapted the story from a novella,\" the director said in an interview. \"It was called the 'Story of Insects,' by Lee Chung Joon; I read it in the 1980s. It stayed with me.\"\n\nThe director, 53, speaks in a whisper, which makes conversation tricky, especially at a lunch table - there's no such thing as a quiet one at Cannes - and with an interpreter in the middle.\n\n\"The kernel of the story touched me. And I thought about it for a long time, before I even made films. Later, in between films, I thought about it again, and about the fate of the heroine.\"\n\nThe woman's child is kidnapped.\n\nThis is Lee's fourth movie. A novelist and a professor who teaches film at the Korean National University of the Arts, he never thought he would become a filmmaker. But in the late 1980s, with video players in homes and the rise of what was called the New Wave, cinema became part of Korea's changing society. Lee worked as an assistant on a film, \"To the Starry Island\" (1994) by Park Kwang-Su, a New Wave director.\n\nToday, with only four films Lee stands out on the current scene, an intellectual who searches the hidden significance in ordinary lives. This is his originality, and what gives a sense of mystery to his films.\n\nHe is a director who switches genres: \"Green Fish\" (1997) was a gangster movie. \"Peppermint Candy\" (2000) has a story that goes backward, a time trip, partly inspired by Harold Pinter's \"Betrayal.\" \"Oasis\" (2002), which he calls a kind of love story, won him the best director award in Venice.\n\nIn 2002, Lee was appointed minister of culture and tourism, which certainly got in the way of making movies. He resigned two years later and founded his own production house.\n\nThe movie was made on location in Miryang, a medium-size town far from Seoul, \"an ordinary city, we just know that it's a rough imitation of a big city,\" the director said. The city, and the film's Korean title, \"Milyang,\" where the action is set, means \"a place with good sunshine,\" he added. \"But we have expanded it to make it secret sunshine.\"\n\nLee shot in CinemaScope for the first time. \"Most suspense movies aren't made in CinemaScope,\" he said, \"but I thought it would be a good way to show the little things, the details in our daily life. I felt that CinemaScope could be a way of telling this story which is not just about what you see, but also touches on what is hidden. I tried to compose the scenes in such a way that you are not aware of the composition, only fluidity.\"\n\nWe are not so much in a state of suspense, as stunned by each turn of the story. \"I think that audiences today know everything, so my goal is to do something unpredictable, to show them something they don't expect,\" he added.\n\nThis is a movie that you can look at for the actors, but they are so good that they melt into the story. Jeon Do-Yeon stars as the frail heroine, and Song Kang-Ho, the popular lead of \"The Host,\" is her mysterious well-wisher. Both are stars in Korea.\n\nSong, who made his film debut in Lee's \"Green Fish\" as a gangster, uses his talent in a completely different way here. He behaves like a secondary character, a figure of fun because of his girth and clumsy ways.\n\n\"But if you watch closely, he is the focus of the film,\" the director said. \"And, in a way, the storyteller. His eye is always on her, but she keeps looking up at the sky. And when she walks, she can only go in one direction, straight ahead, she can't look back. He has to follow her from a distance - if she looked behind her, she would see him.\"\n\nRomance is not on her mind, not when she first comes to town, and certainly not after the drama that befalls her.\n\n\"But my focus is not on the drama, but on what happens after,\" Lee said. \"All kidnapping cases have the same motivation and violence. It is the cruelest, most painful thing. I thought about making this film for a long time.\"\n\nThere are evangelistic forces in Miryang and they get to work on the bereft woman. In no time, she is converted - but that is not the end of the story. In a densely written script, stories keep blossoming: some are unbearably sad, others funny.\n\n\"You see many crosses against the skyline of Korean cities,\" the director said. \"There are many religions and sects. My family has a Confucian tradition so I had no religion, but my wife's family was Protestant, and I taught in a Protestant school.\"\n\nLee says that things that happened in his own life made him feel close to this story. \"The woman's great despair touched me. She is in such pain, but in the end, she finds something inside herself.\n\n\"I think we keep living with faith because we need it. Even atheists believe in something - in something else. Yet, I didn't want to make a movie about faith, really, but a reflection on what goes on inside us. Cinema is a great tool, a way to talk about the invisible through the visible.\"\n\nsource http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/23/arts/cannes24.php"
