        "text": "Lee Chang-dong and Jeon Do-yeon create magic…\n\nThe films of Lee Chang-dong are never just one thing. In three decades, the legendary director has produced six feature length films, far fewer than many of his counterparts who have been working for the same length of time. Upon watching any of his films, though, they reveal layer after layer of meaning not found in films twice their length. His films are deliberate, thoughtful, and while it may seem like quite a high-falootin’ word to be using, they are genuinely profound.\n\nConsidered by many to be his magnum opus, 2007’s Secret Sunshine could have so easily been any number of decent films. It could have worn the skin of a religious parable, it could have been the bleakest domestic drama ever made, it could have been a more uplifting drama about grief and redemption. It is somehow all of these things, and more than any other Lee film, it is far greater than the sum of its parts, even if that sum is still enormous.\n\nIt’s hard to give a proper summary as to what Secret Sunshine is really about, but on the surface at least, it is about newly widowed Shin-ae who moves to the town of Miryang (whose meaning in the hanja Chinese script gives the film its title), where her late husband grew up, in order to set up a piano school with her son. Following further tragedy, she begins to find meaning in life through the local Christian community.\n\nThis leaves out large chunks of the film’s plot, and while it’s not a film reliant on huge plot twists in the traditional sense, it is a film whose entire process is worth experiencing as its bundle of threads slowly unravels. The only true constant in the film is Shin-ae, who is on screen for almost the entirety of the film; one cannot understate just how difficult of a performance it is for lead actress Jeon Do-yeon. Shin-ae is not a stock character, so it’s not as simple as playing a grieving wife, a struggling mother, or an evangelical Christian. She has a complexity seen in very few films, with much of her character history and traits left unspoken, or hinted at in passing.\n\nAnd it’s not just that she is a quote-unquote ‘complex’ character, but she is one who genuinely changes a huge amount over the course of the film. Jeon’s work here is genuinely extraordinary at anchoring a film with difficult themes with an equally difficult performance. The scene in which she first enters the church sees so much happen within her in the space of about five minutes, but it always feels absolutely genuine, and in service of the film as a whole.\n\nIt seems strange to go this deep into a review and not mention the fact that Song Kang-ho also puts in a shift as Jong-chan: a well-meaning mechanic who starts doing whatever Shin-ae does as a means to inveigle his way into her life. It’s an interesting performance, as in many ways it feels like Song going through the motions, but in reality only an actor with his genuine level of likeability could have pulled it off. Everything tells you that he should be annoying and awful and you wait for him to reveal his true nature. In reality, maybe he is a bit annoying, but he certainly isn’t a nasty piece of work. If joining the church makes people improve themselves, even if they don’t truly ‘believe’ in what they are hearing (whatever that means), need it be a bad thing?\n\nIn what could easily be a throwaway scene near the end, there’s an exceptional moment in which Shin-ae walks in on Jong-chan talking to his mother on the phone as he lies about how he spent his birthday. It reveals Jong-chan’s distance from the macho posturing of his colleagues, and even from the respectable man-about-town image he likes to present himself with. It’s a deeply sad, beautiful moment in a film filled with too many to count.\n\nIt would also be easy for the film to be nothing more than a showcase for Jeon. While it’s exceptional at that, it is a fascinating rumination on belief in the modern world. Rather than taking the easy route of criticising the myriad ways that people perceive religion as hiding the truth from people, it makes no cases for either side of any argument; presenting actual people with actual lives that are affected in moving and profound ways daily by their faith.\n\nLee is not interested in watering down the film, or providing unnecessary exposition or context. He instead has written and directed possibly the most complex film on grief and the nature of forgiveness yet produced in the 20th century. There is so much to talk about, but so much that doesn’t make sense to talk about until you’ve seen the film.\n\nSecret Sunshine is far from an easy watch: there are rarely moments of levity, and to get the most out of it it will require full attention for the entirety of its intimidating runtime. It may, however, be the best introduction to one of the greatest writer-directors currently working. You may only watch it once, but you’ll want to think about it, discuss it for months afterwards. A bona fide masterpiece."
