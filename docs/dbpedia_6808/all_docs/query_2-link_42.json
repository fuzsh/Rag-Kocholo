        "text": "THE South Korean director Lee Chang-dong occupies a unique, somewhat contradictory position in his country’s film scene. As the first filmmaker to serve as South Korean minister of culture (from 2003 to 2004) and a longtime advocate of the quota system that obliges his nation’s theaters to show a minimum number of local films, he has played a central role in the resurgence of Korean cinema.\n\nAs a director, though, he does not exactly fit in. While the best-known Korean movies of the past few years are stylish, violent genre works — crime thrillers like “Oldboy” or effects-heavy fantasies like “The Host” — Mr. Lee’s films have a more subdued, literary flavor, and they tend to defy easy classification.\n\nDespite being a fixture on the international festival circuit for some time (having won prizes at Venice, Vancouver and Karlovy Vary), Mr. Lee has been somewhat overshadowed by flashier compatriots like Park Chanwook and Kim Ki-duk. “Secret Sunshine,” his fourth film, is his first since leaving office and also the one that has brought him the most attention. It had its premiere in May at the Cannes Film Festival (where its star, Jeon Do-yeon, was named best actress), recently played in Toronto and Telluride and will be screened at the New York Film Festival on Monday and Tuesday. (The film is awaiting a distribution deal for the United States.)\n\nAs “Secret Sunshine” begins, Shin-ae (Ms. Jeon), a young widow from Seoul, is moving with her little boy to her late husband’s hometown, a provincial city called Miryang. (The literal translation provides the English title.) Under the disapproving scrutiny of the gossipy locals, she sets up a piano school and finds a puppyish admirer in a friendly mechanic (the popular actor Song Kang-ho, last seen here in “The Host”). Before long a blindsiding tragedy sends the protagonist — and the film — spinning into an altogether different orbit. As Shin-ae agonizes over the meaning of suffering and the mystery of salvation, the movie evolves into a provocative study of madness and belief.\n\n“One of the most important things to me was to find a way to portray things that are not visible to the naked eye, faith being one of them,” Mr. Lee said, speaking via a translator in Toronto this month.\n\nA former high school teacher and novelist who turned to filmmaking in his 40s, Mr. Lee, now 53, has a knack for depicting the invisible. His films are intricate character portraits that succeed at animating the larger forces at work in Korean history and society.\n\nHis first feature, “Green Fish” (1997), is a gangster drama rooted in the dark side of the so-called Asian economic miracle. “Peppermint Candy” (1999) mingles personal and national history, recounting the life of a troubled man in reverse chronology, through two decades of defining traumas. The movie rewinds all the way to the Kwangju massacre of 1980, when the government cracked down on a pro-democracy demonstration, killing at least 200 protesters, many of them students. (That was the year Mr. Lee graduated from his university, with a degree in Korean literature.)\n\n“Oasis,” which won several prizes at Venice in 2002, chronicles the forbidden romance between a mildly retarded ne’er-do-well and a young woman with cerebral palsy. Mr. Lee leavens his forthright naturalism with sprinklings of magic realism, as if insulating the unlikely lovers from the hostile prejudices of the outside world. (Both “Peppermint Candy” and “Oasis” are available in the United States on DVD.)\n\n“Secret Sunshine,” perhaps Mr. Lee’s most unflinching film, acknowledges its heroine’s need for spiritual succor even as it takes a coolly skeptical look at the role of evangelical Christianity in Korean society. “Christians are quite a powerful group in South Korea, and people on the production team were worried about what the reception would be,” Mr. Lee said. When the film opened in South Korea in May, he added, “some people were critical, but there was also positive feedback. Some pastors were recommending the film to their church members.”\n\nAccording to Sung-Deuk Oak, an assistant professor of Korean Christianity at the University of California, Los Angeles, about a third of South Koreans are Christian and the majority of South Korean Christians are conservative, evangelical Protestants. Mr. Oak said that “Secret Sunshine” was a hot topic of conversation in churches and the news media in South Korea this year.\n\n“Non-Christians are uncomfortable because the movie has a lot of Christian things,” he said. “Christians are uncomfortable because Christian messages and activities are depicted in a simple and superficial way.”\n\nStill, Mr. Oak added, Mr. Lee’s film raises “heavy theological questions” and is nowhere near as condescending or stereotypical in its portrayal of the devout as “Lady Vengeance,” the concluding installment in Mr. Park’s revenge trilogy. The film also deals with forgiveness and redemption, albeit in a very different way.\n\nMr. Lee said he had been careful not to exaggerate or caricature Christian rites. “In terms of the services and prayer meetings, it was very realistic, more or less a documentary approach,” he said. “If people feel uncomfortable or find some elements of it a little ridiculous, they might be admitting there’s a problem with the way Christianity is practiced in Korea.”\n\nA good part of the film’s power derives from the range and intensity of Ms. Jeon’s performance. Mr. Lee has a reputation for demanding many takes. “I am notorious for giving actors a hard time,” he said with a smile. “I believe that acting should not be about actions, but reactions.” By the end of the shoot, he said, his lead actress “was starting to hate me.” But, he added, “Maybe that helped her since her character really hates her God at the end of the movie.”\n\nAsked about his own religious beliefs, Mr. Lee quoted Ludwig Wittgenstein — “Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent” — and added, “That’s my position on God and faith.”\n\n“Secret Sunshine” ends on a note at once ambiguous and hopeful. Its limpid, humble approach to suffering and grace suggests something like “Breaking the Waves” stripped of mysticism, or a rationalist version of “The Pilgrim’s Progress.”\n\n“Shin-ae is always looking up and never at the ground,” Mr. Lee said, pointing out a recurring motif. The film opens with a wide shot of the sky and concludes with the camera trained on a patch of earth. “I wanted to show that the meaning of life is not far from where we are,” he said. “It’s not up there. It’s here, in our actual life.”"
