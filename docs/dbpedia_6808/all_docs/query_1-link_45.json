        "text": "PC: The characters in your films live in a world that is structured to deny their social and economic agency, but they still try to search for answers, like Jong-su in Burning, or for meaning, like Shin-ae in Secret Sunshine or Mi-ja in Poetry. How do you approach the question of agency for your characters when they are so constrained by limited possibilities?\n\nLCD: My films can be said to be stories about individuals fighting to find the meaning of their lives. They are the weak, yet they engage in a reckless and foolish fight with the absolute strong. They fight against a society’s moral insensitivity and hypocritical ideology (Poetry and Oasis), they fight against the inequality of the mysterious world (Burning), and they don’t mind fighting with God like the heroine of Secret Sunshine. The main character of Peppermint Candy even stands up to the meaninglessness of time like trying to stop a running train. This fight itself is their identity and their agency.\n\nPC: How do you collaborate with performers to create their characters? Has an actor ever changed your initial characterization in the script?\n\nLCD: I like that you said “collaborate with performers” rather than “direct the performers.” I don’t really care for the term “directing the actors.” There probably are a million different methodologies for so-called “directing the actors,” which is equivalent to saying there is no method. One thing I say a lot to actors is, “Don’t act.” It can make the actors bewildered and confused. “Wait a minute, I am an actor. I am supposed to act, but what do you mean not to act?” I tell actors not to try to express certain emotions of the character, but to feel as the character. This is of course easier said than done. At times, it requires a lot of conversation with the actors. I often share conversations that seem irrelevant to the film, such as what I have experienced in life. The good thing about this way (collaborative way) is that the actors don’t feel like they’ve received direct directing, but instead, they think they have found the necessary emotions on their own. Actors can draw even extreme emotions that they will never experience in real life from their own experience. I call this “grabbing the doorknob.” Once you grab the doorknob, you can open the door no matter how heavy the door is. The director helps the actors grab the doorknob. What more can a director do? I never thought that an actor changes a character. Strictly speaking, a character, by nature, is never planned or determined, but is completed by an actor.\n\nPC: The reverse structure of Peppermint Candy becomes a way to explore cause and effect, at the level of an individual character, but also in the context of broader historical forces. How do you approach this idea of causality in your work?\n\nLCD: If we go back in time, namely, if we reverse the cause and effect, know the result first, and then see what brought the result, we can better understand how our life itself is a series of ironies. It is said that the ancient Greeks divided the concept of time into two: time that can be divided evenly into each minute and second (Chronos), and time that can have different weight and meaning when looking back in the face of death (Kairos). Peppermint Candy can be said to be a film that looks back one’s time in the face of death and asks for its meaning.\n\nWe live making countless choices in our own time. And if you look back at the time in reverse order, that is, if you look back already knowing the result, you can see the terrifying meaning of the choices that led to that result. Not only personal history but also the history of a nation is the result of choices. Korea’s most recent modern history was the result of the choices made by the Korean people, including the Gwangju Uprising, the military regime, and the IMF national bankruptcy. Peppermint Candy is a film that shows it. I wanted audiences, especially young audiences, to feel the meaning of choices that we make at countless moments in our lives.\n\nPC: Relatedly, many of your films open with a moment of chance or coincidence that triggers unfolding events, like the scarf on the train in Green Fish (1997), or Jong-su meeting Hae-mi in Burning. What is the role of coincidence and chance in your films?\n\nLCD: I believe a story begins when one person meets another. Just like our lives. It seems like a coincidence, but in retrospect, it was inevitable. In Green Fish, the story would not have begun if Mak-dong had just pretended not to see the woman, the owner of the scarf, being bullied by the gangs, or if he had not tried to settle the score. The same goes for Jong-su in Burning, who grants Hae-mi’s favor to feed the cat while she travels to Africa. A film captures coincidence and chance and represents it on the screen, but audiences realize that beneath the coincidence and chance lies the framework of the inevitable story.\n\nPC: You mentioned that a sense of widespread, simmering rage motivated you to make Burning. What do you think art can do with this despair?\n\nLCD: When people are enraged and despairing of the pain of reality, what can art do? This is a question I have been constantly asking myself, from the time I was writing as a writer until now as a filmmaker. Earlier, I said that I ask about the meaning of the film I make, and it can be said to be the same. It’s not easy to answer, but to put it simply, wouldn’t it be what art can do to express their anger and despair? The question here seems to be how art, especially films, treats them and with what kind of attitude. Even now, films are pouring out problems and suffering of the real world onto the screen, whether it is the pain of war, terrorism, the tyranny of capital or state power, or murder. They are, however, simply consumed as entertainment or materials for cheap catharsis without affecting the soul of the audience.\n\nPC: Have you revisited any of your older films and experienced something unexpected, or realized something new?\n\nLCD: I usually don’t watch my films again once I’m done making it, so this new remastering project offered me a chance to see my films for the first time in a long time. Films make us see the world through the eyes of someone else other than me. This time, I was able to see through my eyes from 20 years ago or ten years ago, and at times it felt unfamiliar. It was interesting to realize that I was subtly or significantly different from who I am now.\n\nPhoebe Chen is a writer and PhD candidate living in New York.
