        "text": "TOP OF PAGE\n\nTuesday, February 19 at 7pm\n\nHALE COUNTY, THIS MORNING, THIS EVENING – Exclusive Area Premiere!\n\nRaMell Ross (U.S. 2018) 76 min. DCP.\n\nAn inspired and intimate portrait of a place and its people, Hale County This Morning, This Evening (winner of the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival) looks at the lives of two young men from rural Hale County, Alabama, over the course of five years. One attends college in search of opportunity while the other becomes a father to an energetic son. In his directorial debut, award-winning photographer and director RaMell Ross offers a refreshingly direct approach to documentary that fills in the gaps between individual black male icons, inviting us to experience the mundane and monumental, birth and death, the quotidian and the sublime. These moments combine to communicate the region’s deep culture and provide glimpses of the complex ways the African American community’s collective image is integrated into America’s visual imagination. Co-presented by Bucknell’s departments of History and Africana Studies. Introduced by Beeta Baghoolizadeh, Assistant Professor of History and Africana Studies."
