When her contract with a top-tier killing agency is up for renewal, she decides to step away from the company to find out what is keeping her daughter shut away from her.\n\nJeon previously won best actress at the Cannes Film Festival for her role in Lee Chang-dong’s Secret Sunshine and also has credits including Untold Scandal, The Housemaid and Emergency Declaration.\n\nByun’s past work includes The Merciless (2017), which premiered in the Midnight Screenings sections of Cannes Film Festival, and political thriller Kingmaker (2022).\n\nProduced by Korea’s See At Film Co, the film also stars Kim Si-A as Boksoon’s daughter, along with Sul Kyung-gu, Esom and Koo Kyo-hwan as her colleagues at the killing agency.\n\nBerlin film festival is taking place February 16-26.\n\nHere’s the poster for the film, featuring Boksoon, a woman with a 100% success rate of completing her assignment:"
