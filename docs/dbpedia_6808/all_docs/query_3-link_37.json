Struggling to fit in, Shin-ae tries different approaches to her new life, all the while local try-hard Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho, who we just saw in Memories of Murder last week) tries to get in her good graces.

Indeed, Lee’s background is in writing, which he did before and during his celebrated filmmaking career—just earlier this year he had a short story published in The New Yorker.\n\nIn Korean with English subtitles., powered by Localist, the Community Event Platform",
