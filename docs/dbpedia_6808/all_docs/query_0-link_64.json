Oxford University Press: hardcover (ISBN: 978-0197760413), paperback (ISBN: 978-0197760420), ebook, 328 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"Activism and Post-activism: Korean Documentary Cinema, 1981-2022 is a new book about nonfiction filmmaking in the private and independent sectors of South Korean cinema and media from the early 1980s to the present day. Drawing on the methodologies of documentary studies, experimental film and video, digital cinema, local discourses on independent documentary, and the literature on the social changes of South Korea, author Jihoon Kim historicizes the formation and development of Korean independent documentary in close dialogue with South Korea's social movements. From the 1980s mass anti-dictatorship movement to twenty-first-century labor issues, feminism, LGBT rights, environmental justice, and key events such as the Sewol Ferry disaster and the Candlelight Protests, Kim offers a comprehensive history of Korean social change documentaries in terms of their activist tradition.\n\nAt the same time, Kim also maps out the formal and aesthetic divergences of twenty-first-century Korean documentary cinema beyond the activist tradition, while also demonstrating how they have inherited and dynamically renewed the tradition's engagement with contested reality and history. Making the tripartite connections between the socio-political history of South Korea, documentary's aesthetics and politics, and the shifting institutional and technological evolution of documentary production and distribution, the book argues that what is unique about this forty-year history of South Korean documentary cinema is the intensive and compressed coevolution of its two interlocked tendencies: activism and post-activism.\"\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction: The Double Helix\n\nPart I Activism\n\n1 The Development of the Activist Tradition in the 1980s and 1990s\n\n2 Twenty-First-Century Activist Documentaries: Three Traditional Issues\n\n3 New Social Movements and Alternative Media Practices\n\nPart II Post-activism\n\n4 The Personal Turn: Domestic Ethnography, the Essay Film, Reenactment\n\n5 The Audiovisual Turn: From hyonjang to Memoryscape\n\n6 The Archival Turn: Memory Wars and Materialist Historiography\n\n7 The Digital Turn: Seeking Truth Differently\n\nEpilogue\n\nSOURCES: Oxford University Press.\n\nTHE LATE AND POST-DICTATORSHIP CINEPHILIA BOOM AND ART HOUSES IN SOUTH KOREA (2023) by Andrew David Jackson. Edinburgh University Press: hardcover (ISBN: 978-1399514200), ebook ISBN: 978-1399514231), 296 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"This monograph examines an unexplored area of South Korean cinema history- the 1985-1997 growth of art film exhibition, consumption, and cinephilia. This moment of heightened interest in art film altered how many Koreans conceptualised cinema and helped pave the way for the critical success of South Korean film. This historical study analyses the cultural, political, social, and economic developments of the post-1985 period that increased interest in European art film. It looks at the interactions of art house exhibitors with cinephile audiences, the media and the state-level administrators responsible for governing the industry. The aim of young cinephiles was nothing less than a bottom-up cultural transformation of a society emerging from three decades of dictatorship. The analysis is based on the previously unheard voices of audiences who participated in the cinephilia. This study is both a history of an era in Korean cinema and an argument about the impact of this period of cultural renewal on the industry.\"\n\nContents:\n\nPart 1: Rise\n\nChapter 1.

Palgrave Macmillan: hardcover (ISBN: 978-3031272677), available in open access digital version, 343 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"This open access book examines the depiction of Korean history in recent South Korean historical films. Released over the Hallyu (\"Korean Wave\") period starting in the mid-1990s, these films have reflected, shaped, and extended the thriving public discourse over national history. In these works, the balance between fate and freedom-the negotiation between societal constraints and individual will, as well as cyclical and linear history-functions as a central theme, subtext, or plot device for illuminating a rich variety of historical events, figures, and issues. In sum, these highly accomplished films set in Korea's past address universal concerns about the relationship between structure and agency, whether in collective identity or in individual lives. Written in an engaging and accessible style by an established historian, Fate and Freedom in Korean Historical Films offers a distinctive perspective on understanding and appreciating Korean history and culture.\"\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction\n\nChapter One.

University of California Press: paperback (ISBN: 978-0520394377), also available in free open access digital version, 182 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"Celluloid Democracy tells the story of the Korean filmmakers, distributors, and exhibitors who reshaped cinema in radically empowering ways through the decades of authoritarian rule that followed Korea's liberation from Japanese occupation. Employing tactics that ranged from representing the dispossessed on the screen to redistributing state-controlled resources through bootlegging, these film workers explored ideas and practices that simultaneously challenged repressive rule and pushed the limits of the cinematic medium. Drawing on archival research, film analysis, and interviews, Hieyoon Kim examines how their work foregrounds a utopian vision of democracy where the ruled represent themselves and access resources free from state suppression. The first book to offer a history of film activism in post-1945 South Korea, Celluloid Democracy shows how Korean film workers during the Cold War reclaimed cinema as an ecology in which democratic discourses and practices could flourish.\"\n\nContents:\n\n1.

University of California Press: paperback (ISBN: 978-0520395695), also available in free open access digital version, 272 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"Melodrama films dominated the North and South Korean industries in the period between liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945 and the hardening of dictatorship in the 1970s. The films of each industry are often read as direct reflections of Cold War and Korean War political ideologies and national historical experiences, and therefore as aesthetically and politically opposed to each other. However, Political Moods develops a comparative analysis across the Cold War divide, analyzing how films in both North and South Korea convey political and moral ideas through the sentimentality of the melodramatic mode. Travis Workman reveals that the melancholic moods of film melodrama express the somatic and social conflicts between political ideologies and excesses of affect, meaning, and historical references. These moods dramatize the tension between the language of Cold War politics and the negative affects that connect cinema to what it cannot fully represent. The result is a new way of historicizing the cinema of the two Koreas in relation to colonialism, postcolonialism, war, and nation building.\"\n\nContents:\n\n1. Introduction\n\n2.

Edinburgh University Press: hardcover (ISBN: 978-1399513067), ebook, 128 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"Korean cinema, though currently established as one of the most successful international film industries, has never been a fair ground for women filmmakers. Amidst the heavily male dominated Korean cinema and the film industry, Yim has consistently produced critically and commercially influential films and has been recognized at numerous film festivals/awards both in and outside of Korea. Yim has produced/directed over a dozen films including shorts - the highest number that any female director has ever achieved in Korea. Also, Yim is the only female director with a blockbuster (Gyoseop, 2023) under her belt, which was always considered to be the arena for male directors.

As the first comprehensive scholarly volume on Kim Ki-young in English, ReFocus: The Films of Kim Ki-young covers his entire career and history of cinematic work, highlighting the thematic and stylistic singularity of Kim's oeuvre, which was produced relative to the specific historical and cultural conditions of post-war South Korea.

Routelege: hardcover (ISBN: 978-1032245010), ebook, 234 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"Cinema has become a battleground upon which history is made?a major mass medium of the twentieth century dealing with history. The re-enactments of historical events in film straddle reality and fantasy, documentary and fiction, representation and performance, entertainment and education. This interdisciplinary book examines the relationship between film and history and the links between historical research and filmic (re-)presentations of history with special reference to South Korean cinema. As with all national film industries, Korean cinema functions as a medium of inventing national history and identity, and also establishing their legitimacy?in both forgetting the past and remembering history. Korean films also play a part in forging cultural collective memory. Korea as a colonised and divided nation clearly adopted different approaches to the filmic depiction of history compared to colonial powers such as Western or Japanese cinema. The Colonial Period (1910-1945) and Korean War (1950-1953) draw particular attention as they have been major topics shaping the narrative of nation in North and South Korean films. Exploring the changing modes, impacts and functions of screen images dealing with history in Korean cinema, this book will be of huge interest to students and scholars of Korean history, film, media and cultural studies.\"\n\nContents:\n\n1.

Fireflies Press: paperback (ISBN: 978-0645454703), 216 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"In the fourth title of our Decadent Editions series, Dennis Lim explores the oeuvre of South Korean auteur Hong Sangsoo via his 2005 film.\n\n'With Hong Sangsoo less is more. Less time to shoot, fewer explanations, fewer people on set - more inspiration, more cinema. Working with him (twice) counts among my most rewarding experiences as an actress. Every day was a miracle. Camera movements, frames, dialogues, costumes - Dennis Lim's brilliant book shows us that, with Hong, it is about getting to what's essential. Poetry, humour, emotion.' Isabelle Huppert\n\n'To discuss the entirety of Hong Sangsoo's oeuvre, which spans some thirty titles, Dennis Lim decided to focus on one. Lim loves and knows Hong's work thoroughly, and the film he chose is the crystal in which all the others are reflected. Here is the best gateway into the Hong multiverse.' Ryûsuke Hamaguchi\n\n'Dennis Lim deconstructs one by one the usual tropes assigned to Hong's mise en scène and illuminates other paths to think anew about a filmmaker who stays in constant and elusive movement. Tale of Cinema is both insightful and humorous, a pleasure to read, and a wicked invitation to keep on deciphering Hong Sangsoo's irreconcilable geometries of love and friendship.'

Harvard University Asia Center: hardcover (ISBN: 978-0674267978), 270 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"In 1916, a group of Korean farmers and their children gathered to watch a film depicting the enthronement of the Japanese emperor. For this screening, a unit of the colonial government's news agency brought a projector and generator by train to their remote rural town. Before the formation of commercial moviegoing culture for colonial audiences in rural Korean towns, many films were sent to such towns and villages as propaganda. The colonial authorities, as well as later South Korean postcolonial state authorities, saw film as the most effective medium for disseminating their political messages. In Cine-Mobility, Han Sang Kim argues that the force of propaganda films in Korea was derived primarily not from their messages but from the new mobility of the viewing position. From the first film shot in Korea in 1901 through early internet screen cultures in late 1990s South Korea, Cine-Mobility explores the association between cinematic media and transportation mobility, not only in diverse and discrete forms such as railroads, motorways, automobiles, automation, and digital technologies, but also in connection with the newly established rules and restrictions and the new culture of mobility, including changes in gender dynamics, that accompanied it.\"\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction: World as Gesture to Learn from Cinematic Experience\n\nI.

Routelege: hardcover (ISBN: 978-0367340865), ebook, 248 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"This book examines the various film festivals where Korean cinema plays a significant role, both inside and outside of Korea, focusing on their history, structure and function, and analysis of successful festival films. Using Korean film festivals and Korean cinema at international film festivals as its primary lens, this interdisciplinary volume explores the shifting relationships between the multi-media genre of film and the fast-growing changing world of film festival cultures. It examines the changing aesthetics of Korean film in a transcultural context and historical (dis)continuity from a variety of angles from film and media studies, literary and cultural studies, Korean studies, Japanese studies, and also from film festival practice. Moreover, through comprehensive examinations of both domestic and international film festivals from the perspectives of production, distribution and marketing it highlights the reception of Korean cinema outside of Korea in an increasingly globalised industry. Featuring the contributions of expert scholars of international film and Korean cinema, in addition to interview material with a practicing film professional, this book will be of huge interest to students and scholars of Korean and Asian film and media studies, as well as those interested in the impact of film festivals more generally.\"\n\nContents:\n\n1.

Harry N. Abrams: hardcover (ISBN: 978-1419758126), ebook edition, 272 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"Brilliantly illustrated and designed by the London-based film magazine Little White Lies, Bong Joon Ho: Dissident Cinema examines the career of the South Korean writer/director who has been making critically acclaimed feature films for more than two decades. First breaking out into the international scene with festival-favorite Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000), Bong then set his sights on the story of a real-life serial killer in 2003's Memories of Murder and once again won strong international critical attention. But it was 2006's The Host that proved to be a huge breakout moment both for Bong and the Korean film industry. The monster movie, set in Seoul, premiered at Cannes and became an instant hit-South Korea's widest release ever, setting new box office records and selling remake rights in the US to Universal. Bong's next feature, Mother (2009), also premiered at Cannes, once again earning critical acclaim and appearing on many \"best-of\" lists for 2009/2010. Bong's first English-language film, Snowpiercer (2013)-set on a postapocalyptic train where class divisions erupt into class warfare-followed on its heels, bringing his work outside of the South Korean and film festival markets and onto the stage of global commercial cinema. With 2017's Okja, Bong became even more of an internationally known name, with the New York Times' A. O. Scott calling the film \"a miracle of imagination and technique.\" Bong's next film, the 2019 black comedy/thriller Parasite, simultaneously scaled back-the film is mostly set in just two locations, with two Korean families taking center stage-and took his career to new heights, winning the Palme d'Or with a unanimous vote, as well as history-making Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film. Parasite's jarring shifts in tone-encompassing darkness, drama, slapstick, and black humor-and its critiques of late capitalism and American imperialism are in conversation with Bong's entire body of work, and Korean culture writer Karen Han's mid-career monograph will survey the entirety of that work, including his short films and music videos, to flesh out the stories behind the films with supporting analytical text and interviews with Bong's key collaborators. The book also explores Bong's rise in the cultural eye of the West, catching up readers with his career before his next masterpiece arrives.\"\n\nContents:\n\nForeword by David Lowery\n\nIntroduction\n\nBarking Dogs Never Bite\n\nMemories of Murder\n\nThe Host\n\nMother\n\nSnowpiercer\n\nOkja\n\nParasite\n\nShort Films and Music Videos\n\nInterviews\n\nOutro\n\nSOURCES: Abrams.\n\nKOREAN CINEMA IN GLOBAL CONTEXTS: POST-COLONIAL PHANTOM, BLOCKBUSTER AND TRANS-CINEMA (2022) by Soyoung Kim.

Rutgers University Press: hardcover (ISBN: 978-1978809659), paperback (ISBN: 978-1978809642), ebook edition, 316 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"Rights advocacy has become a prominent facet of South Korea's increasingly transnational motion picture output, especially following the 1998 presidential inauguration of Kim Dae-jung, a former political prisoner and victim of human rights abuses who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000. Today it is not unusual to see a big-budget production about the pursuit of social justice or the protection of civil liberties contending for the top spot at the box office. With that cultural shift has come a diversification of film subjects, which range from undocumented workers' rights to the sexual harassment experienced by women to high-school bullying to the struggles among people with disabilities to gain inclusion within a society that has transformed significantly since winning democratic freedoms three decades ago. Combining in-depth textual analyses of films such as Bleak Night, Okja, Planet of Snail, Repatriation, and Silenced with broader historical contextualization, Movie Minorities offers the first English-language study of South Korean cinema's role in helping to galvanize activist social movements across several identity-based categories.\"\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction: \"I am a Human Being\": The Question of Rights in South Korean Cinema\n\nPART I - Institutional Foundations and Formal Structures\n\n1.

Routledge: hardcover (ISBN: 978-0367546205), ebook edition, 248 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"Film viewing presents a unique situation in which the film viewer is unwittingly placed in the role of a multimodal translator, finding themselves entirely responsible for interpreting multifaceted meanings at the mercy of their own semiotic repertoire. Yet, researchers have made little attempt, as they have for literary texts, to explain the gap in translation when it comes to multimodality. It is no wonder then that, in an era of informed consumerism, film viewers have been trying to develop their own toolboxes for the tasks that they are faced with when viewing foreign language films by sharing information online. This is particularly the case with South Korean film, which has drawn the interest of foreign viewers who want to understand these untranslatable meanings and even go as far as learning the Korean language to do so. Understanding Korean Film: A Cross-Cultural Perspective breaks this long-awaited ground, by explaining the meaning potential of a selection of common Korean verbal and non-verbal expressions in a range of contexts in South Korean film that are often untranslatable for English-speaking Western viewers. Through the selection of expressions provided in the text, readers become familiar with a system that can be extended more generally to understanding expressions in South Korean films. Formal analyses are presented in the form of in-depth discursive deconstructions of verbal and non-verbal expressions within the context of South Korea's Confucian traditions. Our case studies thus illustrate, in a more systematic way, how various meaning potential can be inferred in particular narrative contexts.\"\n\nContents:\n\n1. Introduction\n\n2.

It examines the most iconic comedy films and comedians to show how North Koreans have enjoyed themselves and have established a culture of humor that challenges, subverts, and, at times, reinforces the dominant political ideology. The author argues that comedy films, popular comedians, and the viewers have an intricate interdependent relationship that shaped the film culture -- the pre/post production of filmmaking, film-watching experience, and the legacies of actors -- in North Korea.\"\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction: Let's Proceed with Laughter!\n\n1.

Historians and legal practitioners who deal with transitional justice agree that the relationship between historiography and justice seeking is contested: this book reckons with this question of how much truth-telling from a violent past will lead to healing, forgiving, forgetting and finally overcoming resentment. Nuanced interpretations of South Korean filmic and literary texts are featured, including Park Chan-wook's Oldboy, Bong Joon-ho's Mother and literary texts of Han Kang and Ch'oe Yun, whilst also engaging the ethical and political philosophy of Levinas, Hannah Arendt, and others. Also offered is new and extensive research into the hitherto hidden history of thousands of North Korean war orphans who were sent to Eastern European countries for care. Grappling with the evils of history, the films and novels examined herein find their ultimate themes in compassion, hospitality, humility and solidarity of the wounded. Healing Historical Trauma in South Korean Film and Literature will appeal to students and scholars of film, comparative literature, cultural studies and Korean studies more broadly.\"\n\nContents:\n\n1.

Rutgers University Press: hardcover (ISBN: 978-1978818910), paperback (ISBN: 978-1978818903), ebook edition, 254 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"Bong Joon Ho won the Oscar for Best Director for Parasite (2019), which also won Best Picture, the first foreign film to do so, and two other Academy Awards. Parasite was the first Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes. These achievements mark a new career peak for the director, who first achieved wide international acclaim with 2006's monster movie The Host and whose forays into English-language film with Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017) brought him further recognition. As this timely book reveals, even as Bong Joon Ho has emerged as an internationally known director, his films still engage with distinctly Korean social and political contexts that may elude many Western viewers. The Films of Bong Joon Ho demonstrates how he hybridizes Hollywood conventions with local realities in order to create a cinema that foregrounds the absurd cultural anomie Koreans have experienced in tandem with their rapid economic development. Film critic and scholar Nam Lee explores how Bong subverts the structures of the genres he works within, from the crime thriller to the sci-fi film, in order to be truthful to Korean realities that often deny the reassurances of the happy Hollywood ending. With detailed readings of Bong's films from Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000) through Parasite (2019), the book will give readers a new appreciation of this world-class cinematic talent.\"\n\nContents:\n\n1.

University of Michigan Press: paperback (ISBN: 978-0472054299), hardcover (ISBN: 978-0472074297), ebook edition, 612 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"South Korean cinema is a striking example of non-Western contemporary cinematic success. Thanks to the increasing numbers of moviegoers and domestic films produced, South Korea has become one of the world's major film markets. In 2001, the South Korean film industry became the first in recent history to reclaim its domestic market from Hollywood and continues to maintain around a 50 percent market share today. High-quality South Korean films are increasingly entering global film markets and connecting with international audiences in commercial cinemas and art theatres, and at major international film festivals. Despite this growing recognition of the films themselves, Korean cinema's rich heritage has not heretofore received significant scholarly attention in English-language publications.\n\nThis groundbreaking collection of thirty-five essays by a wide range of academic specialists situates current scholarship on Korean cinema within the ongoing theoretical debates in contemporary global film studies. Chapters explore key films of Korean cinema, from Sweet Dream, Madame Freedom, The Housemaid, and The March of Fools to Oldboy, The Host, and Train to Busan, as well as major directors such as Shin Sang-ok, Kim Ki-young, Im Kwon-taek, Bong Joon-ho, Hong Sang-soo, Park Chan-wook, and Lee Chang-dong. While the chapters provide in-depth analyses of particular films, together they cohere into a detailed and multidimensional presentation of Korean cinema's cumulative history and broader significance.\n\nWith its historical and critical scope, abundance of new research, and detailed discussion of important individual films, Rediscovering Korean Cinema is at once an accessible classroom text and a deeply informative compendium for scholars of Korean and East Asian studies, cinema and media studies, and communications. It will also be an essential resource for film industry professionals and anyone interested in international cinema.\"\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction: Rediscovering Korean Cinema (Sangjoon Lee)\n\n1.

Christina Klein provides a unique approach to the study of film style, illuminating how Han's films took shape within a \"free world\" network of aesthetic and material ties created by the legacies of Japanese colonialism, the construction of US military bases, the waging of the cultural Cold War by the CIA, the forging of regional political alliances, and the import of popular cultures from around the world.

His films tend to follow conventional genre structures, including thriller and melodrama, but are consistently surprising in both their emotional subtlety and their characters' confrontations with Korean history and politics. The latest in a monograph series from Dis Voir, the book was designed by Lee himself, who selected and arranged all the images, and includes an interview with the director along with several scholarly essays on his work.\"\n\nFeatures three essays, an interview with Lee Chang-dong, a biography, a filmography, and numerous images.\n\nSOURCES: Artbook (English version), Book Depository (English version), Amazon.fr (French version).\n\nTRANSNATIONAL KOREAN CINEMA: CULTURAL POLITICS, FILM GENRES, AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES (2019) by Dal Yong Jin.

University of California Press: paperback (ISBN: 978-0520295308), ebook edition, 208 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"The colonial experience of the early twentieth century shaped Korea's culture and identity, leaving a troubling past that was subtly reconstructed in South Korean postcolonial cinema. Relating postcolonial discourses to a reading of Manchurian action films, kisaeng and gangster films, and revenge horror films, Parameters of Disavowal shows how filmmakers reworked, recontextualized, and erased ideas and symbols of colonial power. In particular, Jinsoo An examines how South Korean films privileged certain sites, such as the kisaeng house and the Manchurian frontier, generating unique meanings that challenged the domination of the colonial power, and how horror films indirectly explored both the continuing trauma of colonial violence and lingering emotional ties to the colonial order. Espousing the ideology of nationalism while responding to a new Cold War order that positioned Japan and South Korea as political and economic allies, postcolonial cinema formulated distinctive ways of seeing and imagining the colonial past.\n\nA free ebook version of this title is available through Luminos, University of California Press's Open Access publishing program.

Focusing on films born of transnational collaboration and its networks, Choe shows how the integration of the tourist imaginary into hallyu cinema points to the region's evolving transnational politics and the ways Korea negotiates its colonial and Cold War past with East Asia's neoliberal present. Hallyu cinema's popularity has inspired scores of international tourists to visit hallyu movie sets, filming sites, and theme parks. This tourism helps ease regional political differences; reimagine South Korea's relationships with North Korea, China, and Japan; and blur the lines between history, memory, affect, and consumerism. It also provides distractions from state-sponsored narratives and forges new emotional and economic bonds that foster community and cooperation throughout East Asia. By attending to the tourist imaginary at work in hallyu cinema, Choe helps us to better understand the complexities, anxieties, and tensions of East Asia's new affective economy as well as Korea's shifting culture industry, its relation to its past, and its role in a rapidly changing region. \"\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction: Distracted Attractions\n\nPart I.

Routeledge: paperback (ISBN: 978-1138609064), hardcover (ISBN: 978-0415707657), Kindle edition, 282 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"The rapid development of Korean cinema during the decades of the 1960s and 2000s reveals a dynamic cinematic history which runs parallel to the nation's political, social, economic and cultural transformation during these formative periods. This book examines the ways in which South Korean cinema has undergone a transformation from an antiquated local industry in the 1960s into a thriving international cinema in the 21st century. It investigates the circumstances that allowed these two eras to emerge as creative watersheds, and demonstrates the forces behind Korea's positioning of itself as an important contributor to regional and global culture, and especially its interplay with Japan, Greater China, and the United States. Beginning with an explanation of the understudied operations of the film industry during its 1960s take-off, it then offers insight into the challenges that producers, directors, and policy makers faced in the 1970s and 1980s during the most volatile part of Park Chung-hee's authoritarian rule and the subsequent Chun Doo-hwan military government. It moves on to explore the film industry's professionalization in the 1990s and subsequent international expansion in the 2000s. In doing so, it explores the nexus and tensions between film policy, producing, directing, genre, and the internationalization of Korean cinema over half a century. By highlighting the recent transnational turn in national cinemas, this book underscores the impact of developments pioneered by Korean cinema on the transformation of 'Planet Hallyuwood'. It will be of particular interest to students and scholars of Korean Studies and Film Studies.\"\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction: Introducing \"Planet Hallyuwood\"\n\nPart I.

Rutgers University Press: paperback (ISBN: 978-0813569970), hardcover (ISBN: 978-0813569987), Kindle edition, 306 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"As the two billion YouTube views for \"Gangnam Style\" would indicate, South Korean popular culture has begun to enjoy new prominence on the global stage. Yet, as this timely new study reveals, the nation's film industry has long been a hub for transnational exchange, producing movies that put a unique spin on familiar genres, while influencing world cinema from Hollywood to Bollywood. Movie Migrations is not only an introduction to one of the world's most vibrant national cinemas, but also a provocative call to reimagine the very concepts of \"national cinemas\" and \"film genre.\" Challenging traditional critical assumptions that place Hollywood at the center of genre production, Hye Seung Chung and David Scott Diffrient bring South Korean cinema to the forefront of recent and ongoing debates about globalization and transnationalism. In each chapter they track a different way that South Korean filmmakers have adapted material from foreign sources, resulting in everything from the Manchurian Western to The Host's reinvention of the Godzilla mythos. Spanning a wide range of genres, the book introduces readers to classics from the 1950s and 1960s Golden Age of South Korean cinema, while offering fresh perspectives on recent favorites like Oldboy and Thirst. Perfect not only for fans of Korean film, but for anyone curious about media in an era of globalization, Movie Migrations will give readers a new appreciation for the creative act of cross-cultural adaptation. \"\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction: South Korean Cinema's Transnational Trajectories\n\nPart I.

Peter Lang AG, Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften: paperback (ISBN: 978-3034318228), Kindle edition, 330 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"The «Korean Wave», or Hallyu phenomenon, has brought South Korean popular culture to the global population. Studies on Korean visual culture have therefore often focused on this aspect, leaving North Korea sidelined and often considered in a negative light because of its political regime. Korean Screen Cultures sets out to redress this imbalance with a broad selection of essays spanning both North and South as well as different methodological approaches, from ethnographic and audience studies to cultural materialist readings. The first section of the book, «The South», highlights popular media - including online gaming and television drama - and concentrates on the margins, in which the very nature of «The South» is contested. «The South and the North» examines North Korea as an ideological other in South Korean popular culture as well as discussing North Korean cinema itself. «The Global» offers new approaches to Korean popular culture beyond national borders and includes work on K-pop and Korean television drama. This book is a vital addition to existing scholarship on Korean popular culture, offering a unique view by providing an imaginary unification of the two Koreas negotiated through local and transnational popular culture flows. \"\n\nContents:\n\n1.

Flatiron Books: paperback (ISBN: 978-1250054272), hardcover (ISBN: 978-1250054265), Kindle edition, Audiobook, 384 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"Before becoming the world's most notorious dictator, Kim Jong-Il ran North Korea's Ministry for Propaganda and its film studios. Conceiving every movie made, he acted as producer and screenwriter. Despite this control, he was underwhelmed by the available talent and took drastic steps, ordering the kidnapping of Choi Eun-Hee (Madam Choi)-- South Korea's most famous actress -- and her ex-husband Shin Sang-Ok, the country's most famous filmmaker.\n\nMadam Choi vanished first. When Shin went to Hong Kong to investigate, he was attacked and woke up wrapped in plastic sheeting aboard a ship bound for North Korea. Madam Choi lived in isolated luxury, allowed only to attend the Dear Leader's dinner parties. Shin, meanwhile, tried to escape, was sent to prison camp, and \"re-educated.\" After four years he cracked, pledging loyalty. Reunited with Choi at the first party he attends, it is announced that the couple will remarry and act as the Dear Leader's film advisors. Together they made seven films, in the process gaining Kim Jong-Il's trust. While pretending to research a film in Vienna, they flee to the U.S. embassy and are swept to safety.\n\nA nonfiction thriller packed with tension, passion, and politics, author Paul Fischer's A Kim Jong-Il Production offers a rare glimpse into a secretive world, illuminating a fascinating chapter of North Korea's history that helps explain how it became the hermetically sealed, intensely stage-managed country it remains today.\"\n\nSOURCES: Amazon.\n\nSPLIT SCREEN KOREA: SHIN SANG-OK AND POSTWAR CINEMA (2014) by Steven Chung. University of Minnesota Press: paperback (ISBN: 978-0816691340), hardcover (ISBN: 978-0816691333), Kindle edition, 263 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"Shin Sang-ok (1926-2006) was arguably the most important Korean filmmaker of the postwar era. Over seven decades, he directed or produced nearly 200 films, including A Flower in Hell (1958) and Pulgasari (1985), and his career took him from late-colonial Korea to postwar South and North Korea to Hollywood. Notoriously crossing over to the North in 1978, Shin made a series of popular films under Kim Jong-il before seeking asylum in 1986 and resuming his career in South Korea and Hollywood. In Split Screen Korea, Steven Chung illuminates the story of postwar Korean film and popular culture through the first in-depth account in English of Shin's remarkable career. Shin's films were shaped by national division and Cold War politics, but Split Screen Korea finds surprising aesthetic and political continuities across not only distinct phases in modern South Korean history but also between South and North Korea. These are unveiled most dramatically in analysis of the films Shin made on opposite sides of the DMZ. Chung explains how a filmmaking sensibility rooted in the South Korean market and the global style of Hollywood could have been viable in the North. Combining close readings of a broad range of films with research on the industrial and political conditions of Korean film production, Split Screen Korea shows how cinematic styles, popular culture, and intellectual discourse bridged the divisions of postwar Korea, raising new questions about the implications of political partition.\"\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction: Visible Ruptures, Invisible Borders\n\n1.

Stanford University Press: hardcover (ISBN: 978-0804783613), Kindle edition, 221 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"Since 1999, South Korean films have dominated roughly 40 to 60 percent of the Korean domestic box-office, matching or even surpassing Hollywood films in popularity. Why is this, and how did it come about? In Unexpected Alliances, Young-a Park seeks to answer these questions by exploring the cultural and institutional roots of the Korean film industry's phenomenal success in the context of Korea's political transition in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The book investigates the unprecedented interplay between independent filmmakers, the state, and the mainstream film industry under the post-authoritarian administrations of Kim Dae Jung (1998-2003) and Roh Moo Hyun (2003-2008), and shows how these alliances were critical in the making of today's Korean film industry. During South Korea's post-authoritarian reform era, independent filmmakers with activist backgrounds were able to mobilize and transform themselves into important players in state cultural institutions and in negotiations with the purveyors of capital. Instead of simply labeling the alliances \"selling out\" or \"co-optation,\" this book explores the new spaces, institutions, and conversations which emerged and shows how independent filmmakers played a key role in national protests against trade liberalization, actively contributing to the creation of the very idea of a \"Korean national cinema\" worthy of protection. Independent filmmakers changed not only the film institutions and policies but the ways in which people produce, consume, and think about film in South Korea.\"\n\nContents:\n\n1.

Columbia University Press: hardcover (ISBN: 978-0231157483), paperback (ISBN: 978-0231157490), Kindle edition, 304 pp.\n\nPublisher's intro: \"Korean writers and filmmakers crossed literary and visual cultures in multilayered ways under Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945). Taking advantage of new modes and media that emerged in the early twentieth century, these artists sought subtle strategies for representing the realities of colonialism and global modernity. Theodore Hughes begins by unpacking the relations among literature, film, and art in Korea's colonial period, paying particular attention to the emerging proletarian movement, literary modernism, nativism, and wartime mobilization. He then demonstrates how these developments informed the efforts of post-1945 writers and filmmakers as they confronted the aftershocks of colonialism and the formation of separate regimes in North and South Korea. Hughes puts neglected Korean literary texts, art, and film into conversation with studies on Japanese imperialism and Korea's colonial history. At the same time, he locates post-1945 South Korean cultural production within the transnational circulation of texts, ideas, and images that took place in the first three decades of the Cold War. The incorporation of the Korean Peninsula into the global Cold War order, Hughes argues, must be understood through the politics of the visual. In Literature and Film in Cold War South Korea, he identifies ways of seeing that are central to the organization of a postcolonial culture of division, authoritarianism, and modernization.\"\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.

It explores the importance of folklore and myth on horror film narratives, the impact of political and social change upon the genre, and accounts for the transnational triumph of some of Korea's contemporary horror films. While covering some of the most successful recent films such as Phone and A Tale of Two Sisters, the collection also explores the obscure, the arcane and the little-known outside Korea, including detailed analyses of The Devil's Stairway and Woman's Wail.

Propelled by underdog protagonists who can only communicate through shared corporeal pain and extreme violence, Kim's graphic films have been classified by Western audiences as belonging to sensationalist East Asian \"extreme\" cinema, and Kim has been labeled a \"psychopath\" and \"misogynist\" in South Korea.\n\nDrawing upon both Korean-language and English-language sources, Hye Seung Chung challenges these misunderstandings, recuperating Kim's oeuvre as a therapeutic, yet brutal cinema of Nietzschean ressentiment (political anger and resentment deriving from subordination and oppression). Chung argues that the power of Kim's cinema lies precisely in its ability to capture, channel, and convey the raw emotions of protagonists who live on the bottom rungs of Korean society. She provides historical and postcolonial readings of victimization and violence in Kim's cinema, which tackles such socially relevant topics as national division in Wild Animals and The Coast Guard and U.S. military occupation in Address Unknown. She also explores the religious and spiritual themes in Kim's most recent works, which suggest possibilities of reconciliation and transcendence.\"\n\nContents:\n\n1.

No other medium penetrated the whole of the population so thoroughly, and no other medium remained so strictly and exclusively under state control. Through movies, the two successive leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il propagandized their policies and sought to rally the masses behind them, with great success. This volume chronicles the history of North Korean cinema from its beginnings to today, examining the obstacles the film industry faced as well as the many social problems the films themselves reveal. It provides detailed analyses of major and minor films and explores important developments in the industry within the context of the concurrent social and political atmosphere.

It differs from previous studies by drawing links between the arrival in Korea of modern technology and ideas, and the cultural, political and social environment, as it follows the development of exhibition, film policy, and filmmaking from 1893 to 1948. During this time, Korean filmmakers seized every opportunity to learn production techniques and practice their skills, contributing to the growth of a national cinema despite the conditions produced by their occupation by colonial and military powers. At the same time, Korea served as an important territory for the global expansion of the American and Japanese film industries, and, after the late 1930s, Koreans functioned as key figures in the co-production of propaganda films that were designed to glorify loyalty to the Japanese Empire. For these reasons, and as a result of the tensions created by divided loyalties, the history of cinema in Korea is a far more dynamic story than simply that of a national cinema struggling to develop its own narrative content and aesthetics under colonial conditions. \"\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.

Duke University Press Books: paperback (ISBN: 978-0822351016), hardcover (ISBN: 978-0822350880), Kindle edition, 280 pp.\n\nFrom the back cover: \"In the late 1990s, South Korean film and other cultural products, broadly known as hallyu (Korean wave), gained unprecedented international popularity. Korean films earned an all-time high of $60.3 million in Japan in 2005, and they outperformed their Hollywood competitors at Korean box offices. In Virtual Hallyu, Kyung Hyun Kim reflects on the precariousness of Korean cinema's success over the past decade. Arguing that state film policies and socioeconomic factors cannot fully explain cinema's true potentiality, Kim draws on Deleuze's concept of the virtual-according to which past and present and truth and falsehood coexist-to analyze the temporal anxieties and cinematic ironies embedded in screen figures such as a made-in-the-USA aquatic monster (The Host), a postmodern Chosun-era wizard (Jeon Woo-chi), a schizo man-child (Oasis), a weepy North Korean terrorist (Typhoon), a salary man turned vengeful fighting machine (Oldboy), and a sick nationalist (the repatriated colonial-era film Spring of Korean Peninsula). Kim maintains that the full significance of hallyu can only be understood by exposing the implicit and explicit ideologies of protonationalism and capitalism that, along with Korea's ambiguous post-democratization and neoliberalism, are etched against the celluloid surfaces.\"\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction: Hallyu's Virtuality\n\n1.

Hong Kong University Press: paperback (ISBN: 978-9888083596), hardcover (ISBN: 978-9888083589), Kindle edition, 232 pp.\n\nPublisher's Introduction: \"This book provides a political and cultural exploration of the Pusan International Film Festival in South Korea since its inception in 1996. By paying a particular attention to the organizers' use of an Asian regionalization strategy, SooJeong Ahn reveals how the festival staked out a unique and influential position within a rapidly changing global landscape. Very little primary empirical research has been conducted to date on non-Western film festivals, though PIFF and Tokyo and Hong Kong have swiftly grown more exciting and influential as testing grounds for global cinema innovations. The initiation, development and growth of PIFF should be understood as resulting from productive tensions in the festival's efforts to serve local, regional and national constituencies. The book also reflects the complexities of rapid transformation in the South Korean film industry as it has reached out to the global market since the late 1990s.\"\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction: Film Festivals between the National and the Regional in the Age of Globalization\n\n1 Why Pusan?: The Political Economy of a Film Festival\n\n2 Negotiating a Place between Korean Cinema and Asian Cinema: Programming Politics\n\n3 Re-imagining the Past: Programming Retrospectives\n\n4 A Global Film Producer: The Pusan Promotion Plan\n\n5 Remapping Asian Cinema: The Tenth Anniversary in 2005\n\nConclusion: Toward a New Channel\n\nSOURCES: Amazon.\n\nNEW KOREAN CINEMA: BREAKING THE WAVES (2010) by Darcy Paquet.

With innovative storytelling and visceral effects, Korean films not only have been commercially viable in the domestic and regional markets but also have appealed to cinephiles everywhere on the international festival circuit. This book provides both an industrial and an aesthetic account of how the Korean film industry managed to turn an economic crisis--triggered in part by globalizing processes in the world film industry--into a fiscal and cultural boom. Jinhee Choi examines the ways in which Korean film production companies, backed by affluent corporations and venture capitalists, concocted a variety of winning production trends. Through close analyses of key films, Choi demonstrates how contemporary Korean cinema portrays issues immediate to its own Korean audiences while incorporating the transnational aesthetics of Hollywood and other national cinemas such as Hong Kong and Japan. Appendices include data on box office rankings, numbers of films produced and released, market shares, and film festival showings.\"\n\nContents:\n\n1. Faces of Globalization 15\n\n2.

South Korea came from nowhere in the 1990s to become one of the biggest producers of pop content (movies, music, comic books, TV dramas, online gaming) in Asia---and the West. Why? Who's behind it? Mark James Russell tells an exciting tale of rapid growth and wild success marked by an uncanny knack for moving just one step ahead of changing technologies (such as music downloads and Internet comics) that have created new consumer markets around the world. Among the media pioneers profiled in this book is film director Kang Je-gyu, maker of Korea's first blockbuster film Shiri; Lee Su-man, who went from folk singer to computer programmer to creator of Korea's biggest music label; and Nelson Shin, who rose from North Korea to the top of the animation business.

Dis Voir: paperback (ISBN: 2-914563-21-3), 128 pp. Published in English and French editions.\n\nFrom the back cover: \"Born in 1960, the South Korean film director Kim Ki-duk is today counted among the most prominent directors of the new contemporary cinema while at the same time resolutely remaining outside the cinema industry. From his very first films, he has been noticed at international film festivals such as Berlin (Golden Bear for best director, for Samaritan Girl), Locarno (Coast Guard), or Venice (Silver Lion for 3-Iron. In spite of a growing success, Kim Ki-duk favors independence in his way of working: small budget, fast shooting and strong personal implications which lead him to create his own backgrounds and accessories.\n\n\"Self-taught, Kim Ki-duk seems to have accumulated in the first part of his life all the experiences necessary to inscribe his future cinema. Moving on the edge for thirty years, he physically explored the forthcoming themes of his work as a director: wandering, escape and, especially, survival.\n\n\"In Kim Ki-duk's films people don't talk, they hit. Relationships are always frontal, direct, decoded, never mediated through language which would neutralize its violence. Flayed, traumatized and continually turning red... Kim Ki-duk's heroes are presented in idyllic and luxurious landscapes, worthy of romantic postcards sent from Korea. Yet the best dramas are played between the flourishing mountain crests and the blue surfaces of the lakes and oceans.\n\n\"Through a filmography as injected with blood on the edge, Kim Ki-duk shows the still-oozing wounds of a Korean society maltreated by its history with an art of precision and a staging of suffering which is all Far-Eastern refinement.\"\n\nContents:\n\n1.
