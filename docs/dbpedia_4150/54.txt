Looks like Victory Venkatesh haven’t learnt the lessons with ‘Nagavalli,’ a sequel to ‘Chandramukhi.’ Although selecting the movies and directors very slowly, one film for Venky on the sets for moment is Telugu remake of Malayalam hit ‘Bodyguard’ with Trisha in lead. Listening to the scripts and stories has become a daily routine for Venky and he is known to be very much impressed by a narration of his old friend Suresh Krissna few days ago.

Yes, it is the sequel story to super hit film ‘Dharma Chakram.’ Taking the rapport of Suresh and Venky which was evident in ‘Prema’ and ‘DC,’ this one could be rated as a super hit combo. Obviously Suresh Productions of Rama Naidu will be the producer. Let us wait for few more days as we may get a clearer picture on ‘Dharma Chakram 2.’
