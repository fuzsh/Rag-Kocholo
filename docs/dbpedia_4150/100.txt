अघायुरिन्द्रियारामो मोघं पार्थ स जीवति || 16||

evaṁ pravartitaṁ chakraṁ nānuvartayatīha yaḥ

aghāyur indriyārāmo moghaṁ pārtha sa jīvati

evam—thus; pravartitam—set into motion; chakram—cycle; na—not; anuvartayati—follow; iha—in this life; yaḥ—who; agha-āyuḥ—sinful living; indriya-ārāmaḥ—for the delight of their senses; mogham—vainly; pārtha—Arjun, the son of Pritha; saḥ—they; jīvati—live

Translation:

The man who does not follow the cycle thus set revolving is a sinner rejoicing in sense-pleasures and he lives in vain.

Commentary:

It is already said that yajna and other selfless acts of worship and service are necessary for the purification and protection of all beings because the Supreme Being is directly present in them. Such men who follow the Chakra are purified and attain Moksha. The rest live a useless life. They forget God; they are enslaved by earthly pleasures; they have no purity and so their life is a waste, and they go down into the bottomless pit of Samsara. One way of life is pure and blessed; another way of life is sinful and useless. One is Atmarama, and another is Indriyarama, one fulfills his life, another destroys it.

To forget God is sin. Those who do not follow the Dharma Chakra forget God and run after the mirage of sensual pleasures. So they accumulate sin. They are described as “living in sin” (Aghayuh). They are men rejoicing in sensual delights. Their life is not useful either to themselves or to others. So their life is a waste. Is it proper for men to live like animals, reptiles, worms, and germs? According to the Lord’s command, one should fulfill his life by maintaining the Dharma Chakra.

Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 3 🔻 (43 Verses)

Question: What is he that does not follow the Dharma Chakra?

Answer: He is a sinner. He is a slave to sense-pleasures. His life is a waste.
