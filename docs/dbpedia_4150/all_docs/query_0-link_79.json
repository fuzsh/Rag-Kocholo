        "text": "An actor for all seasons. An actor family audiences love to love. An actor who refuses to be called a star hero. An versatile talent who is the choice of a range of directors. A performer whom awards have followed. A learner who began his journey in late '70s and has since never gone out of fashion. An excellence whom success has followed. A seeker who could have become a renunciant. He is Venkatesh, fondly called as Venky by one and all.\n\nAs one of the most long-standing stars of Indian cinema completes a successful journey of 30 years, we at IndiaGlitz chronicle his illustrious career.\n\nThe many films, the many magics\n\nFrom mass-oriented films to so-called class-oriented ones, he has done them all. From playing a new-age lover boy to a family man to boot, he has played them all.\n\nTake a look at the range of choices. Kaliyuga Pandavulu, Srinivasa Kalyanam, Swarna Kamalam, Prema, Bobbili Raja, Shatruvu, Coolie No.1, Chanti, Sundarakanda, Kondapalli Raja, Abbaigaru, Dharma Chakram, Sahasa Veerudu Sagara Kanya, Intlo Illalu Vantintlo Priyuralu, Pavitra Bandham, Preminchukundam Raa, Pellichesukundam, Suryavamsam, Ganesh, Premante Idera, Raja,Kalisundam Raa, Jayam Manade Raa, Nuvvu Naaku Nachav, Vasu, Malliswari, Gharshana, Sankranthi, Lakshmi, Adavari Matalaku Ardhale Verule, Tulasi, Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu, Drushyam, Gopala Gopala. The list is long and envious.\n\nThe eclectic quality of the range of movies says it all. For a wide array of genres, Venky fits the bill. His choices are bold. He doesn't shy away as long as there is enough potential for him to display his studied acting prowess.\n\nHe is excellence, success is his, awards are his\n\nFor an actor not exactly known for serious kinda roles as far as the new Millennium cinegoers are concerned, especially since the days of Kalisundam Raa, it's instructive that through the '80s and '90s, he ha excelled in many an intense role.\n\nThe fact that some of the prestigious awards he won were for non-playful roles says it all. He won the Nandi (Special Jury award category included) for Kaliyuga Pandavulu, Prema, Dharma Chakram, Kalisundam Raa, Swarna Kamalam, Ganesh, and Adavari Matalaku Ardhale Verule. Definitely, the roles he played in these films are distinct from one another.\n\nAs for the Filmfare awards, he had it for films as diverse as Brahma Putrudu, Dharma Chakram, Ganesh, Jayam Manade Raa, Sankranthi, and Adavari Matalaku Ardhale Verule.\n\nWhether or not he won an award, his capacity to show variation in emotions in films like Kshana Kshanam, Raja (an underrated act), Seenu, and Nuvvu Naku Nacchav is hailed by all.\n\nHis directors are of all types\n\nFrom working with greats like K Raghavendra Rao, K Viswanath, Dasari Narayana Rao to new-generation directors like VV Vinayak (Lakshmi), Selvaraghavan (AMAV, Boyapati Srinu (Tulasi), Srinu Vaitla (Namo Venkatesha), Srikanth Addala (SVSC), Maruthi (Babu Bangaram), Kishore Tirumala,, he has been there, done that.\n\nK Viswanath (Swarna Kamalam), KRR (Kaliyuga Pandavulu, Bharatamlo Arjunudu, Coolie No. 1, Sundarakanda, Muddula Priyudu, Sahasa Veerudu Sagara Kanya), Raviraja Pinishetty (Chanti), Kodi Ramakrishna (Srinivasa Kalyanam, Shatruvu), Dasari Narayana Rao (Brahma Putrudu), B Gopal (Bobbili Raja), Kodandarami Reddy (Surya IPS), RGV (Kshanam Kshanam), Suresh Krishna (Prema), Muthyala Subbaiah (Pavithra Bandham, Pellichesukundam) - they all built his career, brick by brick.\n\nIf the old-school ones made Venky what he is, the new-school ones have/are re-inventing his style. The result: a treat of sorts from 'babu bangaram' of TFI.\n\nThe remake star to reckon with\n\nThe 'Chinna Thambi' of Tamil became the beloved 'Chanti' of Telugu. The 'Chinna Gounder' of Tamil was the 'China Rayudu' of Telugu. 'Sundara Kandam' in Tamil is 'Sundara Kanda' in Telugu. Likewise, Suryavamsam, Unnidathil Ennai Koduthen (Raja), Gemini, Kaakha Kaakha (Gharshana), Aanandham (Sankranthi), A Wednesday! (Eenadu), Aptharakshaka (Nagavalli), Bodyguard (Bodyguard), Bol Bachchan (Masala), Drishyam, Oh My God (Gopala Gopala), Salaa Khadoos (untitled sports drama) are some of the most notable remakes in his career.\n\nEven as a remake star, Venky has held his own. Refusing to ape any and always putting his efforts toward projecting his own style, Venky has maintained his uniqueness from time to time.\n\nA spiritual seeker in his own right\n\nA devotee of Ramana Maharshi, Venky has admittedly found peace in the middle path after toying with the idea of renouncing everything and taking to 'sanyas'. ÂUltimately itÂs a business, but I didnÂt get into films for stardom. For years I struggled, unable to cope with stardom. I am happy for the love and recognition, but at one point I wanted to run away and become a sanyasi. Now I am happy in the mid path Â at peace with work, family and finding my inner voiceÂ, the actor was once quoted by a national daily as saying.\n\nA seeker in his own right, Venky has maintained a healthy detached attachment."
