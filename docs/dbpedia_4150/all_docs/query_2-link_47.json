        "text": "(1): Prema\n\nBanner: Raajeswari unit\n\nDirector: Suresh Krishna\n\nProducer: D.Rama Naidu\n\nYear of the Release: 1988\n\nBox-Office Result: Super Hit\n\nPrema was Suresh Krishna's first straight movie in Telugu. His debut film Satya was dubbed into Telugu and went unnoticed though it was shot well. By looking at his performance and the script that he narrated to Rama naidu, he wanted to produce a film with Suresh Krishna. As a result of it, Prema was happened. It was a love story, told in, Suresh Krishna's style. Venkatesh, then was, doing regular format roles and this was little different to his earlier roles. As an orphan, he better performed in the first half and as a true lover, given decent performance in the later half. Revathy, was his co-star, who did the naughty teenage girl role. Ilayaraja's soul stirring music added life to the movie. Despite all these, film wasn't well received at the box-office. Venkatesh won the best actor award from the AP Government.\n\n(2): Swarna Kamalam\n\nBanner : Bhanu Art creations\n\nDirector: K.Viswanath\n\nProducer: K.Benarji\n\nYear of the Release: 1988\n\nBox-Office Result: Super Hit\n\nWorking under K.Viswanath's direction was a great gift to any upcoming artiste. Venkatesh was lucky to have got a call from Viswanath in the early days of his career. Venkatesh, being an upcoming actor, still not matured to do performance oriented roles that time, where as Viswanath kind of movies require some natural performance. One really wondered how this would be possible? But they made it possible. Viswanath cleverly used the potential of Venkatesh that time and offered a role of a young painter who craves for traditional arts. Though movie had importance to a legend in koochipudi dance, and his daughter, this character takes the lead in their life and supports them till the end. With excellent songs from Ilayaraja, spell bounding histrionics from BhanuPriya and last but not least, fine performance from Venkatesh, this movie reached the target audience. Venkatesh, with this film, proved that he had ambitions to do different roles if chances were given.\n\n(3): Bobbili Raaja\n\nBanner: Suresh Productions\n\nDirector: B.Gopal\n\nProducer: D.Suresh\n\nYear of the Release: 1990\n\nBox-Office Result: Sensational Hit\n\nThis was Venkatesh's first biggest commercial success. Though nothing new to offer in this same old revenge drama, it was well packed with all the commercial ingredients that made this film a golden duck at the box-office. With this film, venkatesh's fan following had almost doubled. The clash between Atta-alludu once again proved that Andhra box-office never get sick of this theme if well executed. Late ‘Divya Bharati' was introduced with his film, she became very popular. Ilayaraja songs were rage and helped for the film's repeat value. Venkatesh had done this role with ease. The mass oriented dialogues and histrionics of him were well received and eventually, he had become big mass star with this film's marathon success. It had broken many of the box-office records live that time.\n\n(4): Chanti\n\nBanner: Creative commercials\n\nDirector: Raviraaja Pinisetty\n\nProducer: KS Ramarao\n\nYear of the Release: 1992\n\nBox-Office Result: Sensational Hit\n\nThis movie was a remake of a Tamil super hit film directed by P.Vasu. There is only one word to express the success of this film Phenomenal. There is no wonder if one says people have thronged to theatres on bullock carts from rural areas only to see this film. The mother-child sentiment moved the audience to the core by the great support of Ilayarajas lilting music. Venkatesh was one lucky person to get good scripts/good characters in right time in his career. He utilized them with proper planning and care. Though he was labeled as Remake hero, but it didn't stop him winning many hearts. Venkatesh's popularity had seen a big crest at this juncture. Chanti had re-written the box-office stamina of Telugu cinema in terms of any aspect that time. Producers even had plans to release a book on the records this film had created. This was the first film to cross 100 days in more than 40 direct centers that was a industry record that time. Meena & Raviraaja were another persons benefited out of this film. With the stupendous success of this film, venkatesh realized that he should do more remakes to keep his success profile high. He succeeded in that aspect with so many remakes and maintained the tag of victory venkatesh.\n\n(5): Sundara Kaanda\n\nBanner: Soudamini creations\n\nDirector: K Raghavendra rao\n\nProducer: KVV Satya Narayana\n\nYear of the Release: 1992\n\nBox-Office Result: Super Hit\n\nThis was again a remake film by Venkatesh. For a change, venkatesh had chosen the soft romantic film rather going for a heavy sentimental movie again. It worked out. This college backdrop movie had its own mark of entertainer and leaf of sentiment in the end. Venkatesh came up with brilliant performance as lecturer venkateswarlu. Comedy scenes in the class room, between Meena , Aparna and Venkatesh entertained all the classes. K.Raghavendra rao did justice to the original script done by Bhagyaraaja. Songs tuned by Keeravani were instant hit and added more attraction. Venkatesh, once again proved that he could do justice to all sort of roles without having any image problems. This movie ran very well despite having a tight opposition at the box-office in the form of Nagarjuna starrer Presdient gaari Pellam , which was a come back film Nagarjuna.\n\n(6): Dharma chakram\n\nBanner: Suresh Productions\n\nDirector: Suresh krishna\n\nProducer: D. RamaNaidu\n\nYear of the Release: 1994\n\nBox-Office Result: Super Hit\n\nThough Prema disappointed commercially, Venkatesh didnt hesitate to give a second chance to the director. Dharmachakram shaped up respectively. This time, the duo, by keeping changed image of Venkatesh in mind, and done a different revenge drama. This was story of a family in which mother and son together fought against father for the principles and human values. Srividhya, as a ditched wife, rises up her kid (Venkatesh) with well behavior, manner and makes him a good lawyer to do justice to the fellow woman who are cheated brutally by their husbands. How Venkatesh takes the revenge on his father for the injustice that he had done to his mother was the crux of the film. Venkatesh portrayed this role like a maturated artiste. His controlled performance made audience to clap for certain scenes. He, for the second time, won the best award for this role. Commercially, this film didn't do wonders, but not a disaster.\n\n(7): Preminchukundam raa\n\nBanner: Suresh Productions\n\nDirector: Jayant C Paranjee\n\nProducer: D.Suresh\n\nYear of the Release: 1997\n\nBox-Office Result: Sensational Hit\n\nThis movie was the one set the path for Seema oriented stories. Though ‘Love' was the main elements of the film, it was laced with faction backdrop to give a new dimension to the routine theme. Jayanth, a debutant director made this film a family entertainer with the help of good dialogues, excellent songs and speedy narration. Jayanth had taken all the care to project venkatesh as a romantic lad who doesn't care any for his love. He also blended the right emotional scenes and ferocious scenes that would elevate hero image. Venkatesh did complete justice to this role. He looked handsome through out the film. He was good at the emotional scenes where he argued with his parents over his love. Songs tuned by Late Sri Mahesh were awesome. This film had very good run at box-office and proved the stamina of Venkatesh. It had set many records in terms of its run and collections. Jayanth, Venkatesh combination made wonders after this film.\n\n(8): Ganesh\n\nBanner: Suresh Productions\n\nDirector: Late sri Tirupathy Swamy\n\nProducer: D.Suresh\n\nYear of the Release: 1999\n\nBox-Office Result: Super Hit\n\nGanesh was also performance oriented subject chosen by Venkatesh. One good thing in him was, he tries to do different characters at least occasionally. Ganesh was one such film. His character fights against the corruption in hospitals. Venkatesh has also habit of encouraging new directors. Late Sri Tirupathy swamy, who was a journalist, happened to narrate this storyline to Venkatesh. He immediately Okayed it and went onto the sets with him as the director. Though it was well shot and pointed out many loopholes in the society, commercially not done too many wonders. ManiSarma , in his career beginning, done this movie. Couple of songs were good. Kota sreenivasarao character was well etched being Venkatesh's the best. This film won few awards at state level.\n\n(9): Raaja\n\nBanner: SuperGood films\n\nDirector: Muppalaneni Shiva\n\nProducer: RB Chowdhury\n\nYear of the Release: 2000\n\nBox-Office Result: Sensational Hit\n\nRaaja was again a remake.

The film had broken the box-office records with its unexpected run.\n\nVenkatesh was named a family hero with plenty of films of this type released just before and after of this film and cemented his position in lady fans.\n\n(10): Nuvvu Naaku Nachhav\n\nBanner: Sravanthi movies\n\nDirector: K.Vijaya Bhaskar\n\nProducer: Sravanthy Ravikishore\n\nYear of the Release: 2001\n\nBox-Office Result: Sensational Hit"
