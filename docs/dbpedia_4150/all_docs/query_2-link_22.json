The aim of this mod is to showcase the diversity of the region in the medieval period as well as the cultures influenced by the greater cosmopolis that existed during this period. Mod contains dozens of new civs, new units, new buildings and brand new mechanisms that makes each of them unique. A lot of time and love has been pored into it. Hope you like it!\n\nAssamese\n\n“Various people groups have settled the fertile plains of the Brahmaputra valley and established various states since antiquity. Eastern Indo-Aryans such as the Kamrupi, various Tibetic peoples, and even the Ahom who originally hailed from Guangxi have found their footing here. The Ahom state that remained unconquered for more than 600 years. These groups coalesced to form the Assamese culture. The archers of Kamrup were famous for their accuracy and sharp shooting ability. Combined with incredible indegenously built gunpowder weaponry they proved a formidable force to reckon with to their enemies.”\n\nOverview\n\nAs an archer civilization, the Assamese have fully upgraded Archers. Their archers get bonus attack vs Infantry making them deadly and these archers can regarrison in archery ranges to fire from inside while in protection acting as a tower. To further the advantages the Assamese also get a unique unit ####### a commander unit that boosts the speed and heals health of nearby archers. This commander unit can also train another unique unit called Karpai Dhenu which is an archer with low health but with bonus damage against other unique units. The ####### are built for free at zero cost and training time equal to the number of castles they own. For some more survivability of the archers it is advisable to mix in a few Elephant Archers into their army composition. Their economy is easy to manage as they can build storages as an all in one drop site in place of lumbercamp, mining camp and mill. Though they must require building barracks or dock along with the storage in dark age two fill in the two dark age buildings count. And their economic units, that is their villagers, trade units, fishing boats are cheaper. By researching Hengdang Sword all their militia line units gain pierce damage equal to the melee damage they deal, thus making them an excellent choice to mix in the army. Being the earliest inventors of indegenous toaps (cannons), Assamese are also able to research Bortop Mithaholong which replaced the gold cost of bombard cannons with food thus making them a lot more affordable.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nUnique Units\n\n########## = Commander Unit, trained at Castle, build limit equals the number of castles you own.

Bengal is the hub of trade and religion and universities that date back a millennium years. Bengali agricultural and material wealth was matched by none; indeed, the economy of Pāla Bengal at its peak with their possession along the Ganges alone outstripped all of Europe at the time. Bengal is a land of Vedic and indigenous legends as well as the hotbed of the kind of Buddhism that dominated during the Pāla period which influenced all of South East Asia, Mahāyāna and ####################\n\nOverview\n\nThe Bengalis are an Elephant and navy civilization. Their Elephant corps is very formidable, having not only Elite Battle Elephants, Elephant Archers, and Siege Elephants, but also nearly every upgrade for them, only lacking Thumb Ring for the Elephant Archer. In addition, their Elephants take -25% bonus damage and resist conversion, and Paiks gives them faster attacking speed. Their Monks have great survivability, on account of having +3 armor against both ranged and melee attacks. The other land units, however, are average, as lacking Thumb Ring hinder their Arbalester and Skirmishers. Their Stable units are limited to Light Cavalry (other than excellent Battle Elephants). The infantry are mediocre, lacking both Supplies and Plate Mail Armor. Unlike other Indian civilizations, the Bengalis have no gunpowder units on land, and lack Siege Onagers. Their unique unit, the Ratha, can compensate for lacking Knights and Cavalry Archers, since it can switch its attack. But on the Monastery, defense, and economy line, there is only one technology missing from their technology tree, their navy can regenerate, and they get additional Villagers from Town Centers every Age advanced. Mahayana also makes full use of the population. So they have good economy, defense, and navy. In addition to all this they can also tran Ramdao an infantry from Barracks which can switch between charge (higher attack and speed) and defend mode (higher armour).\n\nCharacteristics\n\nUnique Units\n\nRatha = Chariot unit that can switch between melee and ranged attacks.\n\nRamdao = Infantry unit that can switch between charge and defend modes, trained at Barracks\n\nUnique Technologies\n\nPaiks = Rathas and elephant units attack 20% faster.\n\nMahayana = Villagers take up -10% population space.\n\nCivilization bonuses\n\nElephant units receive 25% less bonus damage and are more resistant to conversion\\n\n\nTown Centers spawn 2 Villagers when the next Age is reached\\n\n\nShips regenerate 15 HP per minute\n\nMonks +3/+3P armor\\n\n\nMelee Cavalry gain +2 bonus damage vs Skirmishers\n\nTeam bonus\n\nTrade units yield 10% food in addition to gold.\n\nIn-game dialogue language\n\nUnits in-game speaks Shadhu Bengali, a historical literary register of the Bengali language most prominently used in the 19th to 20th centuries during the Bengali Renaissance. Sadhu language was used only in writing, unlike its standard counterpart, which follows up with the colloquial form of the language.\n\nWonder\n\nDeccanis\n\n“The name Deccan has an ancient derivation that originates from a local Prakrit which equates to the South. Various megalithic cultures resided in the dry plateaus of Deccan that eventually gave rise to powerful polities. Various cultures from the Karnata, Maharashtrian, and Telangana realms have vied for power here and amalgamated with each other along with various native tribes of the region, including the Gonds. Owing to their wealth derived from trade and local resources, they’ve garnered a lot of attention and immigration from Persia, Yemen, and even the Horn of Africa who contributed to the Dakhni/Deccani culture. Deccanis were considered seasoned fighters with fortifications that were loaded with artillery, among which there is the longest cannon in the world Malik-e-Maidan.”\n\nOverview\n\nDeccanis are a gunpowder civilization, their bombard towers are cheaper and their handcannoneers regenerate health and have faster speeds when around bombard towers. To boost their economy they get extra boar in the start of the game which if carefully gathered can help them a lot in early aging ups. Their main focus should be to rush in aging up process as most of their advanced features come late. By researching Malik-e-Maidan their castles upgrade into a Bombard Castle firing a bombard shot in each burst of fire along with arrows. They have two unique units, one is Pindari trained at the Castles. He is a horse rider arsonist who throws fire bombs at enemies that ignore armour. And the second unique unit Shishpar Cavalry is trained at the stables. He is a mediumly armed horse cavalry with a hammer that damages the enemy armour. In Imperial Age they are able to research Bhalaeet Spear that make their spearline units regenerate health and have extra line of sight. They are able to research all techs for free in the University in Imperial Age. Siege Towers are half priced for them and their allies, thus making them a more effective siege weapon into their army. They also are able to train fully upgraded cavalry archers which comes in handy with their fast moving army.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nUnique Units\n\nPindari = Cavalry unit trained at Castle that throws fire bombs, ignoring armour.\n\nShishpar Cavalry = Cavalry unit trained at Stable that damages enemy armour in each hit with its hammer.\n\nUnique Technologies\n\nMalik-e-Maidan = Upgrade Castles with a Bombard Cannon Shot.\n\nBhalaeet = Spearmen regenerate health and have extra line of sight…\n\nCivilization bonuses\n\nStart with 1 extra Boars\n\nBombard Towers are 15% cheaper\n\nBombard Towers boost health and speed of nearby Hand Cannoneers\n\nIn Imperial Age your University comes with all techs free to research\n\nTeam bonus\n\nSiege Towers are 50% cheaper\n\nIn-game dialogue language\n\nDeccani Units speak in Marathi, Telugu, and Dakhini\n\nWonder\n\nHindustanis\n\n“The claim to the populous, diverse lands and lucrative trade routes of Hindustan can be attained as one steps into the conqueror’s shoes themselves. With its sophisticated division of the labour system, significant scientific achievements, bustling trade networks, and powerful military technology let allowed Hindustanis to flex their might from the Ganges, through Punjab, Khyber and beyond. This coveted land named after what lays beyond the Indus River, has historically invited a multitude of invasions in all directions. The nomadic Scythians, Kushānas, and Hunas all sought to control the trade routes by taking the prized possession of Mathura. It was later Kannauj that was fought over by the Gurjāras, Bengalis, Deccanis, and even the Kashmiris. But none could outclass the brilliance of Delhi that was snatched by the Islamic powers. To profit from these magnificent cities, one must exert their power in all directions, whether into Afghanistan, Bengal, Deccan, or the Arabian Sea.”\n\nOverview\n\nThe Hindustanis are classified as a Camel Rider and gunpowder civilization. As such, they have excellent Camel Riders with a unique upgrade, faster attack rate, an additional attack bonus against standard buildings, and all upgrades. They also have access to the Hussar which also shares the attack bonus against standard buildings, but no Knights at their disposal. Their archers and Cavalry Archers are usable and their Skirmishers are fully upgraded. They have excellent Hand Cannoneers getting all possible upgrades and getting another +2 range from Shatagni, combined with additional armor, making the Hand Cannoneer one of the most prominent unit in Hindustanis armies. Their infantry misses out on the final armor upgrade and Halberdier, but the Ghulam is a great anti-archer unit. The siege weapons are quite good apart from the missing Heavy Scorpion and rare Siege Onager upgrades, due to having extra armor on their Bombard Cannons and Siege Elephants, which are almost as good as Siege Rams. Their navy is not good, since the Fast Fire Ship, Heavy Demolition Ship, Dry Dock and Shipwright are missing. Their Monks are average. Their defenses are weak, but their economy is good with cheaper Villagers, faster gold income due to Grand Trunk Road, and their unique building, the Caravanserai, which heals and increases speed of Trade Carts in a 10 tile radius. They are also able to train Gazis, who gain +1 attack for every 10 of the Gazis that have fallen in battle (Murattab), the unit becomes battle hardy as it fights on.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nUnique Units\n\nGhulam: Infantry unit that thrusts its spear through multiple targets.\n\nGazi: Cavalry Unit trained at Stables that gains +1 attack for every ten of them felled.\n\nImperial Camel Rider: Upgrade of the Heavy Camel Rider, provides additional HP and attack\n\nUnique Buildings\n\nCaravansarai = Building which heals and speeds up nearby Trade Carts.\n\nUnique Technologies\n\nGrand Trunk Road = Increases the speed of all gold income by +10%.\n\nShatagni = Gives Hand Cannoneers +2 range.\n\nCivilization bonuses\n\nVillagers are 10%/15%/20%/25% cheaper in the Dark/Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\n\nCamel Riders attack 20% faster.\n\nGunpowder units units have +1/+1 armor.\n\nTeam bonus\n\nCamel units and light cavalry units have +2 attack against standard buildings.\n\nIn-game dialogue language\n\nHindustani units speak Hindi.\n\nWonder\n\nKalingans\n\n“The tales of the ######## are as old as the Vedic Age. Stretching from the Utkala region near Bengal, to the Kalingāndhra region in the South, and into the deep jungles of Kosala in the West, the Odra people groups were a sturdy and culturally important bunch. Maintaining their independence since the age of classical antiquity, this land of Khandayat warriors never gave up. Legend has it that ancient mariners from this region colonized south-east Asia, and even founded the kingdoms of Funan (Khmer) and Shailendra (Malay). Their artforms with unique masks and mudras are observed even as far as Bāli. Multiple empires sprang up from Kalinga that thundered its adjoining neighbors with its martial tradition.”\n\nOverview\n\nKalingans are a defensive civilization. They start with a gold and a stone mine near town center meaning so they can save some wood from building mining camp early on. Their farms produce infinite food which further saves some wood but with a catch that there are no mill upgrades thus they will need to build more farms to be efficient. But these little wood savings can help them build ships early on domintating the seas reflecting the ancient maritime traditions of Kalinga. Their trade cogs are able to attack like galleys, so they can defend themselves if the need arises. And they can research all their dock techs free when they reach the imperial age. Them and their allies get extra 0.5 extra range for their archers and buildings which gives a slight advantage for ranged warfare. Their unique unit Khandayat is multi-talented trained from the Paika Akhadas. Trained at castle, he can ride into battle on horses able to switch between sword and bow and continuing the fight on foot if felled. Researching Ghumura Chhau allows them to train foot unit Khandayats at Barracks. And their second unique unit Prahari comes with a Khond Battle Axe charging into massed units dealing trample damage though it is fragile in terms of health and can be shooten out afar by archers, used carefully they can be very fruitful. Researching ######## Emperors lets them be trully the lord of Elephants by making their gold cost replaced with wood. Though they are unable to research their elite versions so they will need their numbers for advantage.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nUnique Units\n\nKhandayat = Multirole Unit trained at Castle, can switch between melee cavalry (phadikara), ranged cavalry (dhanuki) and after felling becomes melee infantry (dhenkiya), ranged infantry (banua).\n\nPrahari = Cavalry unit with low HP and high trample attack, trained at Stable\n\nUnique Technologies\n\nGhumura Chhau = Allows the creation of Khandayat Infantrymen at Barracks.\n\n########## Emperors** = Elephant units cost wood in place of gold.\n\nCivilization bonuses\n\nStart with a Gold and Stone mine near Town Center\n\nFarms produce infinite food\n\nTrade Cogs can attack like Galleys\n\nIn Imperial Age your Dock comes with all techs free to research\n\nTeam bonus\n\nArcher units and buildings +0.5 range\n\nIn-game dialogue language\n\nKalingan Units speak Odia\n\nWonder\n\nKannadigas\n\nKaru Nādu which either means ‘elevated country’ or ‘black country’ named after either the increasing elevation or the black cotton soil, exists in the lower reaches of the Deccan. With its unique geography, we’ve seen Konkan region kings by the coast, native power houses within the mountainous Malēnādu, the southern ki### that border Kongu Nādu in the Tamil country, and the northern kings who contested for power in the upper Deccan with various Deccani kings. This region is the home to massive empires such as the Chalukyas, Hoyasalas, and Vijayanagara that asserted power in all directions. The earliest attestation of the Kannada language is observed in the Kadamba period while the Kannada literary culture was started in the upper Deccan by the Kannada speaking Rashtrakutas who ruled from what is now Maharashtra. The language and culture was revered by native and non native kings alike, and the linguistic Kannadiga identity was built through the ages. The lands of Karnataka was protected by its most loyal and prominent generals that kept the enemies at bay with an aggressive stance, so much so that the rump state of Mysuru survived even till the 20th century.\n\nOverview\n\nKannadigas are an aggressive civilization. Fear not to aggressively strike your enemies as you are able to defend and quickly recover yourself from any devastation at home. Their houses cost -10 wood saving you the resources to invest in other areas. It is an great idea to invest your early resources on scout rush as your cavalry upgrades are free and researching arson affects your stable units as well thus letting them burn down everything faster. To assist your fast moving army you can also recruit cavalry archers. Adding to this you can also train tanky Eleohant Archers and Battle Elephants. Your infantry is no less either. Researching the Nayankara System allows your Nayakas to manage your armies more efficiently to make them take up 0.9 population so you can make more of them. Your unique unit Karnatabala is the pride of your army, as it spreads fear in the minds of enemy unique units, doing bonus damage against them and is unconvertible by monks rendering them useless and able to regenerate health over time. In the Imperial Age you are able to build Workshops that heal nearby buildings. Researching the City of Victory allows you to build massive fire towers and makes your defensive structures like walls, gates, towers auto repair over time. The prosperity of Vijayanagar attracts traders from abroad allowing your allies to research market techs instantly.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nUnique Units\n\nKarnatabala = Cavalry unit that is unconvertible, regenerates health and has bonus against other unique units.\n\nUnique Buildings\n\nFiretower = Powerful tower that spews fire at short range.\n\nWorkshop = Heals nearby buildings.\n\nUnique Technologies\n\nNayankara System = Infantry Units take 0.9 population space.\n\nCity of Victory = Can build fire towers and all towers, walls and gate regenerate health.\n\nCivilization bonuses\n\nHouses cost -10 wood\n\nCavalry armor upgrades for free\n\nArson upgrade affects Stable units\n\nIn Imperial Age you can build Workshops that heals nearby buildings\n\nTeam bonus\n\nMarket techs research instantly\n\nIn-game dialogue language\n\nKannadiga Units speak Kannada\n\nWonder\n\nNepalis\n\n“The hill people residing in the foot hills of Himalaya are collectively known as the Paharis. Though Nepal was first referred to as Kiratadesa, the ancient tactician, Chānakya, is the first person to use the name referring to the Nepalis. However, they still weren’t a monolith. Various ethnicities and states sprung up in the region. In the medieval period, part of this region was called Khasdes. The Khasi Gorkha kingdom later unified Nepal and much of the Pahari people creating an empire that extended to Kashmir and parts of Tibet in the North West and to Sikkim in the East. The well defensible fortress of a nation of the Gorkhas couldn’t even be conquered by the mighty British empire.”\n\nOverview\n\nNepalis are a Monk and Monastery Civilization. They get their theocracy and block printing researchs free, so monk rush is a viable option. Their monks move 10% faster, and their monasteries heal nearby villagers. They are also able to train Bhikshus from Town Centers that are special monks that can dodge projectiles and able to heal and convert but unable to pick relics. Researching Abode of Gods spawns 2 relics at their castle, thus always making them the key to relic victories. They and their allies can get +5 population space from monasteries. Their unique unit is Gosain which is a peculiar mercenary ascetic that is not visible on minimaps and generates gold when attacking enemy units. After researching Kukri Knife they are able to deal bonus damage when fighting uphills so now they are the boss of fighting in rugged terrains. Their Trebs are able to move faster and are cheaper to purchase. They are able to train Steppe Lancers without the Elite upgrade and Cavalry Archers which can be fully upgraded only missing the ring archer armor. The lancers can be quite effective in use with Battle Elephants.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nUnique Units\n\nGosain = Infantry Unit trained at Castle, invisible on Minimap, generates gold while fighting enemy units.\n\nBhikshu = Monk that can dodge projectiles, trained at Town Centers\n\nUnique Technologies\n\nAbode of Gods = Spawns 2 Relic at your Castle.\n\nKukri Knife = Your units do bonus damage fighting uphill.\n\nCivilization bonuses\n\nTheocracy and Block Printing is free\n\nTrebuchets move 35% faster and 15% cheaper\n\nMonks move 10% faster\n\nMonasteries heal nearby Villagers\n\nTeam bonus\n\nMonasteries provide +5 population\n\nIn-game dialogue language\n\nNepali Units speak Nepali\n\nWonder\n\nPersians\n\n“Emerging from inner Persia, the House of Sasan toppled feeble Parthia, establishing a dynasty capable of challenging their Roman neighbors to the west. Even after the Muslim conquest, the Sasanian legacy lived on in the structure of the medieval Persian states. Stun your enemies with a stampede of mahouted War Elephants and hails of arrows thick enough to blot out the sun while your Savaran #### #### down, or field an army of gunpowder units worthy of the great Safavid Empire. Nothing is beyond your grasp!”\n\nOverview\n\nThe Persians are a cavalry civilization. They are the only civilization with access to Hussars, Paladins, and Heavy Camel Riders , with all their Stable and Blacksmith upgrades, which also benefits their unique unit, the War Elephant. And these food- and gold-intensive Cavalry units are sustained thanks to faster-working Town Centers, which provide Persians with a quick economic boom that aids into achieving the required Villager production of their key units. Infantry are weak for Persians, and their archer units are not very prominent, due to missing important upgrades such as Bracer, Two-Handed Swordsman, and Arbalester. Still, the Persians can utilize fully upgraded Halberdiers and Hand Cannoneers. Thanks to Kamandaran, their Archers have no gold cost, making them weak but cheap units, which pair well with cavalry due to countering Camel Riders and Halberdiers. They also have access to a large variety of siege weapons, but they lack Siege Engineers. In the water, the Persian navy is above average through the Castle Age, thanks to the faster working rate of their Docks. But once they hit Imperial Age, the lack of Shipwright can be unfavorable in longer games, and the lack of Bracer for their Galleons does not go unnoticed. The Persian Monks are a#### the weakest of all civilizations. The lack of Heresy is unfortunate, as the Persians rely on expensive Heavy Cavalry units that are prone to conversion: the Paladin and the War Elephant. Because of this, it is important to mix in Hussars along with the heavy cavalry. About their defenses, they lack Fortified Wall and Keep as upgrades, and also they’re missing on Bombard Towers, and the absence of Bracer and Siege Engineers haunts Persians again in the aspect of their defensive options. Nevertheless, Persians can fully upgrade the armor and HP of their buildings, having both access to Hoardings and Architecture, and it is very worth noting that Persian Town Centers and Docks have a massive double HP. Their economy is simply excellent; they get all economic upgrades, as well as a head start with additional resources given at the start of the game. All of this is further bolstered by their faster working Town Centers and Docks across all Ages, which also gets them villager lead over their opponents, furthermore, translating into economic, and military production advantages. Persians get to recruit Savaran at Stables who are great against archers thrusting their spear through multiple units. They also gain Sogdian Fighter who rise from the wrecks of destroyed buildings, having a high pierce armor. These fighters become stronger by +30 HP every age.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nUnique Units\n\nWar Elephant: Slow but extremely powerful elephant cavalry unit.\n\nSavaran: Cavalry Unit trained at Stables that thrusts its spear through multiple units\n\nSogdian Fighter: Infantry unit that cannot be recruited but rises from the wrecks of destroyed buildings.\n\nUnique Technologies\n\nKamandaran = Archer-line gold cost is replaced by additional wood cost.\n\nMahouts = Increases War Elephant speed by +30%.\n\nCivilization bonuses\n\nStart with +50 wood, food\\n\n\nTown Center, Dock 2x hit points; work rate +10% Feudal, +15% Castle, +20% Imperial Age\\n\n\nCavalry Archers +1 range in Castle Age and Imperial Age each\\n\n\nDestroyed buildings (except houses and drop sites) spawn Sogdian Fighters\n\nTeam bonus\n\nKnights have +2 attack against archers.\n\nIn-game dialogue language\n\nPersian units speak Farsi.\n\nWonder\n\nRajputs\n\n“There are many theories about the origins of these legendary states. Some stories link them to the nomadic horsemen like the Scythians and Hunas, while other traditions link them to the kshatriya groups that ruled the realm. Whatever their origin, these regional states sprung up during the Gurjāra period. They ruled much of Gurjāradesa which includes present day arid deserts of Rajasthan (formerly Rajputana) where they rode with their swift camels as well as Gujarat where they earned their wealth through lucrative trade. They drove away invasions after invasions from the Islamic world, even defeating the Ummayad Caliphate at its zenith while under the Gurjāra empire. They maintained their states through intricate allegiances with Islamic Hindustān. The valiant rulers of Rajputana considered their land as their mother and proudly shed blood to protect it.”\n\nOverview\n\nThe Rajputs focus on mounted units. They lack Blast Furnace, but their mounted units do more bonus damage. Both their unique technologies helps them to train their mounted units easier, and also gives more durability to their Elephant Archers and Camels, which benefit from their team bonus as well. Their siege weapons are slightly above average, as their Siege Elephants are the best one at tearing down buildings, and they have access to Bombard Cannons. Their foot units are very lacking, with no Champions or Squires, which makes their unique infantry, the Chakram Thrower, less mobile. What’s worse, they have Spearmen that cannot be upgraded. They are able to train Gauntlet Blades from Barracks who are able to dodge projectiles and are a viable infantry options for the Rajputs. Their archers are average at best, lacking Ring Archer Armor and Arbalesters, making their archer units vulnerable against ranged units. Their navy and Monks are reliable in the early game, but missing some essential technologies in the late game makes them mediocre. Defense is just OK, without Arrowslits and Bombard Towers. Their economy is overall good with proper management, especially in the early games, because of getting more Berry Bushes they can collect, and the ability to garrison herdables to generate food automatically. Fishing Ships will be safer due to being able to garrison. But their bonuses only focus on food, and they lack late-game economy, since Two man Saw and Guilds are absent.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nUnique Units\n\nChakram Thrower = Infantry Unit trained at Castle that throws two chakrams that passed throw massed enemies doing melee damage.\n\nGauntlet Sword = Infantry trained at Barracks that can dodge projectiles.\n\nCamel Scout = Early camel unit.\n\nUnique Technologies\n\nKshatriyas = Military units cost -25% food.\n\nFrontier Guards = Camel Riders and Elephant Archers +4 melee armor.\n\nCivilization bonuses\n\nStarts with 2 Forage Bushes.\n\nCan garrison Mills with livestock to produce food.\n\nMounted units deal +20%/+30%/+40% bonus damage in the Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\n\nCan garrison Docks with Fishing Ships.\n\nTeam bonus\n\nCamel and elephant units are created 25% faster.\n\nIn-game dialogue language\n\nRajput units speak Gujarati.\n\nWonder\n\nSiamese\n\n“Siam - now Thailand - has a long and storied history. A beautiful and mysterious land of dark forests and ancient mountains, Siam has seen occupation and revolution, flood and famine, and the rise and fall of empires. Command the army of elephants to defeat the mighty Burmese and Khmer Empires and establish your supreme reign.”\n\nOverview\n\nThe Siamese are a civ with Defensive playstyle. All your techs (not age ups) at town center grant you a free villager thus you should consider researching them as soon as they are available. They get to recruit fully upgradable Barrack and Archery Range units. Their towers deal bonus damage against cavalry and that too with faster moving projectiles. To add to this synergy they get to recruit unique unit Daab Ngao that pins down nearby enemies by slowing them down thus opening a greater time window for you to hitting them with other units. This might even help monks to convert enemies easier. Being a good team player you get to research Phrai Luang making the unique unit from castle for you and your allies cheaper by 10% and this stacks up if there are more allied Siamese players. To add to the scare of enemies the Siamese are also able to upgrade their Battle Elephants into Imperial Status which effectively wipes the enemies already pinned down. The famous Ayutthayan tactics of Rattanakosin Formation makes your spearmen have +20 HP. The Siamese relied heavily on foreign mercenaries for handling their gunpowder thus you are able to recruit handcannoneers at no food cost only a little bit of extra gold cost. Lacking siege rams and siege engineers might be a bit hard for you to bring down enemy buildings but the Siamese get extra attack from their mighty elephant units against enemy buildings for their team.

The Great Indus River gives it the name Sindh and has always given life to the economy of the region. Sindh is sometimes referred to as the Bab-ul Islam (translation ‘Gateway of Islam’), as it was one of the first regions of the continental India to fall under Islamic rule. Sindh maintained its autonomy throughout the medieval period, acting as a regional power balancer. It’s home to an excellent cavalry tradition and beautiful architecture owing to the historic tradition of importing lapis lazuli from Central Asia stretching back to the time of the Meluhhans of the Indus Valley.”\n\nOverview\n\nSindhis are a cavalry civiliation. Their camels move faster. Researching Bab-ul Islam in Castle Age allows their camels to deal trample damage making them even more deadly to deal with. They are able to recruit the Bhuj Cavalry at Stables which is a fast cavalry with the ability to dodge ranged attacks, while also attacking faster than common cavalry units. Their buildings gain more armor for each age upgrade. Blast FUrnace and Two-Handed Swordsman are available to them from Castle Age. Owing to its fertile soils, they are able to make Farms in 2x2 tiles and thus allowing them to produce more food from a small patch of land. Their unique unit Malakhro Malh is an infantry with a Mace that does bonus damage against Siege and Buildings with a slight extra range. They are able to research Ranikot Fortress allowing them to build walls at wood cost instead of stone. Them and their allies get to train Petards at half cost thus making these suicide bombers more efficient to use.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nUnique Units\n\nMalakhro Malh = Maced Infantry Unit with bonus against Siege Weapons and Buildings and slighty extra attack range.\n\nBhuj Cavalry = Light cavalry which can dodge ranged attacks.\n\nUnique Technologies\n\nBab ul-Islam = Your camel units deal area damage in the blast width of 0.5.\n\nRanikot Fortress = Walls cost 20 wood instead of 5 stone.\n\nCivilization bonuses\n\nBuildings +1/1 armor and +10 building armor for each age upgrade\n\nBlast Furnace and Two-handed Swordsman are available in the Castle Age\n\nCamel Riders move 10% faster\n\nFarms take up less area to build (2x2 tiles)\n\nTeam bonus\n\nPetards are 50% cheaper\n\nIn-game dialogue language\n\nSindhi Units speak a mix of Sindhi.\n\nWonder\n\nSinhalese\n\n“The ancient land of Tamraparni known for its spice trade with the Greco-Romans has been inhabited by various people groups including the indigenous Veddas, Tamils, and the Sinhalese. The epic of Mahavamsa traces the lineage of the Sinhalese to Prince Vijaya and his followers who left the port of Suppāraka across the sea to reach this beautiful island. Later known by the names of Eezham, Ceylon, and Sri Lanka, this centre of the trade attracted numerous invasions from across the sea in Tamils and Kalingans, as well as from the other side of the world (Portuguese, Dutch, British). Despite all this, the defiant Theravada Lions held firm to their traditions. Under Parakramabahu, the Sinhalese reached unprecedented heights of prosperity as he launched campaigns into Tamilakam and even Burma. Their Buddhist cultural practices and architectural forms spread across Southeast Asia.”\n\nOverview\n\nSinhalese are a defensive civilization. They don’t have any early game economic bonuses but as the time passes they become stronger. Their villagers work faster around monasteries. They are able to research all armour techs in blacksmith by just researching the infantry armor techs. Their fire ships are 20% cheaper thus allowing them to defend their costs more easily. Their elephant units cost reduced by -10 gold for each relic they garrison. Their unique unit is the Kastane Warrior trained at Castles which is an Infantry that always takes 10 hits before killed for non-elite, and 15 hits before killed for elite version. He is trained for food and wood cost only and has the prized kastane sword which returns gold when he is dead. They are also able to train Velakkaras, a two population mercenary tamil siege unit that protects units behind it and throws a boomerang that passes through massed units. Researching Land of Serendipity gives them and their allies 1000 stone instantly which is very useful for fortification. Researching their imperial age tech bondikula gun gives their hand cannoneers blast damage. Them and their allies get to build outposts with no stone cost so it might be a good idea to build more of those.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nUnique Units\n\nKastane Warrior = Infantry Unit trained at Castle which takes no bonus damage and returns some gold when felled.\n\n**Velakkaras =**Siege Unit trained at Siege workshop costing two pop space that protects units behind it who receive 50% less damage from incoming projectiles and throws a boomerang that passes through crowded units.\n\n![305 ##################################################83/3382659/profile/305_50730.png)\n\nUnique Technologies\n\nLand of Serendipity = The player and allies recieve 1000 stone.\n\nBondikula Gun = Hand Cannonneer 0.5 blast damage.\n\nCivilization bonuses\n\nVillagers work faster around monasteries\n\nFire Ships are 20% cheaper\n\nBlacksmith Armour Techs merged\n\nElephant units -10 gold cost for each Relic Garrisoned\n\nTeam bonus\n\nOutpost cost no stone\n\nIn-game dialogue language\n\nSinhalese Units speak Sinhala. The Velakkara Mercenaries speak Eelam Tamil.\n\nWonder\n\nTamils\n\n“Theirs is a culture that has a record of existence from the Iron Age. The chiefdoms that dotted ancient Tamilakam grew into powerful trading and conquering empires. Chief among them were the three great Mūvēndars: the Cholas, Pandyas, and Cheras. Tamilakam traditionally had quite a bit of diversity in their culture, but they were all known for their naval capabilities. The Tamils under Chola rule used their massive sea vessels to seize control of the lucrative Indian Ocean trade routes and built one of the wealthiest sea empires of the world. Their metallurgy invention of Wootz Steel, a predecessor of modern steel was used to make weapons that were stronger, deadlier, and more durable than their counterparts elsewhere. The Malayan Tamils from the Keralite realm, the Cheras, practiced a unique style of martial art called Kalarippayattu, and produced a whip like sword called the Urumi that would instantly instill fear in the enemy.”\n\nOverview\n\nThe Tamils are classified as an infantry and navy civilization, and have fully upgraded infantry and Dock, with Barracks technologies at half price, while both unique units are in their main strength part. Despite this, they also have above-average ranged units with fully upgraded Arbalesters, Hand Cannonners, and faster-attacking Skirmishers and Elephant Archers. To offset them, their Stable units are lacking, with only Light Cavalry and (non-Elite) Battle Elephants as their Stable choices, with no other Stable technologies or Plate Barding Armor. Although Wootz Steel and Medical Corps slightly compensate for their Stable, it is more useful for the elephant units and infantry. Lacking Stable technologies is a hinderance for their elephants. Outside of the Siege Elephant, their siege weapons are relatively average, with Bombard Cannons and Siege Onagers without Siege Engineers as their only reliable siege units. Their Monks are also underwhelming, as they lack Redemption and Fervor, which not only makes them less functional, but it is also harder to collect Relics. They also lack Heresy, so their elephants are vulnerable to conversion, combined with no Husbandry. Defense is average, without Architecture and Treadmill Crane. Their economy is good at wood and fishing, thanks to getting wood when advancing ages, and carrying more from fishing. Apart from this, their economy is weak, since both Castle Age mining technologies and Crop Rotation are absent.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nUnique Units\n\nUrumi Swordsman = Melee infantry trained at Castle that can charge its attack.\n\n########## 4|256x256](https://media.moddb.com/images/members/4/3383/3382659/profile/Untitled.4.png)\n\nThirisadai = Warship that fires multiple projectiles.\n\nUnique Technologies\n\nMedical Corps = Elephant units regenerate 20 HP per minute.\n\nWootz Steel = Infantry and cavalry attacks ignore armor.\n\nCivilization bonuses\n\nReceive +200 wood when advancing to the next age\n\nFishermen and Fishing Ships carry +15\n\nBarracks technologies cost -50%\n\nSkirmishers and Elephant Archers attack 25% faster\n\nSiege units cost -33% wood\n\nTeam bonus\n\nDocks provide +5 population space.\n\nIn-game dialogue language\n\nTamil Units speak Tamil. Urumi Swordsman Speaks Malyalam.\n\nWonder\n\nTibetans\n\n\"Often called the roof of the world, the plateau of Tibet hosts the mighty Tibetans. In the cold, hostile environment of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau in Central Asia and the Himalayas these tough Warriors were born to make the world bow before them. Lead the Tibetan people to either war and conquest, or build a vibrant civilization. Build an empire with your armored cavalry and monks and establish history within Central Asia and the Himalayas. \"\n\nOverview\n\nThe Tibetans have a very unorthodox style of gameplay with Cavalry Focus. The longer the game is stretched, the harder it gets, as the civ finds it rather hard to find supplies of food to support its army. The Tibetans are unable to research any mill techs for their farms in its hostile environment. They rely on a constant supply of Yaks from their Mill that is recruitable every 100 seconds for every Town Center you own. As the enemy economy grows, you might have to rely on stealing some of enemy farms to help your economy. You are able to train monks and monasteries one age earlier thus making Relic rush and Monk rush very viable options. All your houses spawn one berry bush every age up. In castle age you can research Dzongs which allows you to recruit villagers from Castles. Your unique unit Zimchongpa is an incredible unit in the sense that it can take down enemy cavalry very fast, especially having massive bonus against cav archers. It is not weak against archers as in the case of Camels. Even though it is a melee cavalry, it costs wood and gold and thus not costing heavily upon your economy. Your cavalry archers are also very strong as they upgrade freely to Heavy Cavalry Archers in the Imperial Age and you can research Qinghai Bows giving them +2 Attack. To end it in a glorious fashion you also get Imperial Steppe Lancers to support your Imperial Army.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nUnique Units\n\nZimchongpa: Melee Cavalry units trained from the castle that cost wood and gold and have bonus attack against mounted units.\n\nYak: Herdable Himalayan Cattle that you can train from Tibetan Mills every minute for every TC you own.\n\nImperial Steppe Lancer: Imperial Upgrade to Steppe Lancer Line.\n\nUnique Technologies\n\nDzong = Enables training Villagers at Castle.\n\nQinghai Bow = Cavalry Archers gain +2 Attack.\n\nCivilization bonuses\n\nRecruit Yaks from Mills every 100 sec for every Town Center you own\n\nEvery Age Up spawns Forage Bush around houses\n\nCan build monastery and train monks from Feudal Age\n\nHeavy Cavalry Archer researched free\n\nTeam bonus\n\nCaravan is free.\n\nIn-game dialogue language\n\nTibetan units speak Tibetan.\n\nWonder\n\nLinks:\n\nWebsite:\n\nMod Manager:\n\nDiscord:"
