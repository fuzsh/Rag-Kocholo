One of the extended Sanathana Dharma family known as “Theravada Bhudha” (Therraputh) Sanyaasi appeared in the dream of Swami Vivekananda and told him that, now your ship is anchored in Kreet Island. The Christianity was created from this Island. This place is very close to Turkey seashore. Whatever we preached and practiced were stolen by the “decorated assumed Christians” and spreading our messages as Jesus teachings in the western world. In fact, there was one born as Jesus, all the relevant documents about this secretly created religious story were hidden in this Island, if you dig it out, you will find it. Swami Vivekanda jumped out of sleep by hearing this and he rushed to the Captian to find out the position of his ship. The Captian said we are in Kreet Island! Being a Bharathian (Indian), I can’t disbelieve this incident of Swami. To add more, some other prominent people too raised the question of Christianity in this manner. Even Sri Ramakrishna Paramahasa asked Narendran about his dream. My view – Religion is not spiritual although the English dictionary may say so. In my view, religion is only a practice to understand a portion of the spiritual world as per some founder/leader’s clever idea behind it.
