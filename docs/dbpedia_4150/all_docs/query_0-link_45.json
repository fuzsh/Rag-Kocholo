In the collections point\n\nof view.The first week collections were 78% in Apsara ,Vijayawada.this\n\nshows the fate of the movie ,which was released in the days where there\n\nis no other new movie.It is already taken away in all the A and B\n\ncenters,So the point of hit or average does not appear.It is a\n\ndisastrous flop in all A centers and B centers.It is not yet released in\n\nC centers.\n\nSOGGADI PELLAM:This is one more hit for Mohan babu,who has the credit of\n\nhaving the movie that grossed the highest amount(PEDA RAYUDU) in the\n\nhistory of Telugu film industry.It is the first hit for Muthyala\n\nSubbayya after a long time.\n\nDHARMA CHAKRAM:As expected this movie is a hit in A centers and having\n\nmixed response in B centers.\n\nHere is another interesting item regarding RIKSAVODU.It will never gross\n\n3 crores in the coming 10 years.Leave the grossing of 4.2 crores in the\n\nfirst week(Gharana mogudu ,the biggest hit of Chiranjeevi grossed\n\n10crores in 100 days according to its producer.Can any one imagine the\n\nworst movie of Chiranjeevi grossing 4.2crores in first week.If all the\n\ntheatres in AP where RIKSHAVODU is released are full it would have\n\ngrossed around 1.1crores)\n\nVAMSANIKOKKADU:This movie is running house fulls in the sixth week in\n\nall the theatres it is released.It is supposed to be the highest grosser\n\nof all the movies so far released in 1996.\n\nORAY RIKSHA:This movie of R.Narayanamurthy is considered to be a hit in\n\nTelengana areas where it is successfully running and an average movie in\n\nother areas.This is directed by Dasari.\n\nThanks,\n\nAnil.\n\nAnil K.

( He has given 3\n\n: hits in a row for 3 sankraanthis)\n\n: Number One, Amma Donga and what was the third one ?\n\nPachchani Kaapuram, if I am not mistaken.\n\n: >Vamsaani kokkadu is average\n\n: By Average, do you mean that the movie broke even ?\n\n: Like No profit and No Gain ?\n\nNo. The box-office ratings, which I read in Superhit are like this:\\\n\n1. SuperHit - 3:1 returns for investment\n\n2. Hit - 2:1\n\n3. Above average 1.75 : 1\n\n4. Average 1.25:1\n\n5. Below Average 1:1\n\n6. Flop , loss obviously\n\n7. Utter flop , toatl wash out.\n\nNow again, this varies from hero to hero. Also, sometimes u anticipate to make\n\na 2:1 atleast on a big hero's movie. In that case if u make only say 1.25:1, u will still consider it a loss. This is because of the interest rates the producers pay to the financiers. This happens only for big heroes, as the buyers pay at the muhurtham of the movie. So the interest accrues right from the date of\n\ncommencement of production.\n\nA recent example for this is Big Boss. Obviously it got its investment in the first 3 weeks (6 crores), but could not sustain, hence it was considered the\n\nbiggest flop for chiru in recent times as the returns were the lowest ever.\n\nsomefacts if are interested :\n\nRikshavodu is above average in 'A' centers and a hit in B & C centers. Its first week gross is 4.2 crores.\n\nMore news:\n\nSooggadi Pellam is a flop(the result was attributed to Muthyalaa subbaiah, as he was known to be a flop director).\n\n: >Kumar, Kuppam Sudheer\n\n: Bhimaraju Kalidindi\n\n\n\nFor your kind information,\n\nI was in India and that too in vijayawada. during the first 20 days of\n\nrikshavodu. My brother has the details of the collections for all the\n\ntheaters in the vij area. The housefull broke in Apsara on the 25th day or so\n\nthat too for the noon show, which clearly disproves the fact that it had 78%\n\nin the first week in apsara. BTW, rikshavodu had 100% in the first week in both\n\napsara and vekateswara deluxe which is opposite to apsara(near neighbour).\n\nI know that some people cannot believe some facts. I can give you the\n\ntheatre wise collection in just Nazam for rikshavodu for the first week. I got\n\nit with me from India. It came in superhit. I hope I have not lost it. Nizam\n\nis just 1/5 of total collections of rikshavodu. The first week gross in\n\nNizam is 80 lakhs. That blows of the pits 1.1 crores straight away.\n\nThe time when Gang leader, GM were released the prices were really low and also\n\nthe theater release range for chiru was not that high. It increased with\n\ngm.\n\nPeadraayudu, is the highest grosser in the telugu film industry (20 crores)\n\nbut with inflation it still did not beat GM.\n\nI had this argument with some one earlier indicating that I can get the stats.\n\nI do have them. Peadraayudu ran gfor 100 days in 37 theaters far less compared\n\nto GM ( 65 theaters). the no. of theaters for 200 days are 2. Out of which\n\none of them is theater in Madanapalli or so and is owned by mohanbabu himself.\n\nI doubt if pedaraayudu grossed more than chanti with inflation taken into\n\naccount. Chanti grossed over 9 crores and is next to gm at that time.\n\nIn vijayawada, the record is still jvas, 207 days followed by shiva 205 days\n\n.\n\nOfcourse the movies compared are the recent ones. Old movies as many know\n\nused to run for 52 weeks very easily.\n\nIf u want a theater listing for pedaraayudu, I can post it.\n\nAlluda majaaka ran for 100 days in 27 theaters. Grossed 14 crores.\n\nI still repeat that sooggadi pellam and dharmachakram are flops.\n\nIn fact, one other thing is that, during the gang leader season, every chiru\n\nmovie grossed more that 7 crores. Now a days, 6 crores is child's play for\n\nchiru movies.\n\nBigboss, did have that initial. Without that much guarantee no one\n\nbuys a chiru movie. Inspite of being a miserable flop, it ran for 40 days in\n\nvijayawada. That really shows the range of chiru's pull.\n\nAs for the statement that rikshavodu did not have buyers for the first week.\n\nCheck out superhit afetr the first week week of its release. It reported the\n\nap collections as 4.2 crores in over 250 theaters. In fact, it gave area wise\n\nsplit like Nizam, Ceeded, andhra etc etc\n\nAHad it not been sold, it wld not have made this kind of money.\n\nBTW, these are some of the prices for chiru movies area wise,\n\nNizam 1.5 crores , chiru gets the rights and distributes thru geetha arts.\n\nCeeded 2 crores most of the parts take fixed hire, especially chittoor.\n\nKrishna 30-40 lakhs\n\nGuntur 50-60 lakhs\n\nVizag 25 lakhs\n\nEast & West 60 lakhs\n\nAlso there are some other areas including out of the state karnaataka.\n\nIt can easily get another 50 lakhs. Plus u have audio, video, then tamil,\n\nhindi rights etc.\n\nOverall in ap alone its sold for more than 6 crores. However, I did not list\n\nall the areas.\n\nI think I shd list the following fact published in Jyothi chitra.\n\nThis shd enlighten some of my friends about how our movie industry\n\nhas become a crores market than the B.C lakhs market.\n\nNag has signed a movie with Sushmita sen, music by Ar Rahman produced by\n\nKumjumon (producer of tamil gentleman and premikudu.\n\nCost of tye movie unknown. sushmita gets 1 crore. Nag gets his usual 75\n\nlakhs.\n\nThis movie is already sold in tamil for 5 crores, 4 crores in telugu\n\nand supposedly 1.5 crores in all the 6 major territories of the hindi area.\n\nThat makes a total of 18 crores. Hoe does this figure sound?\n\nThe movie is being made in tamil (Rakshakan). Rakshakudu in telugu (dubbed)\n\nand may be rakshak (dubbed) in hindi.\n\nOne more interesting thing. Vajram is a big flop. But it still grossed 45\n\nlakhs in the first week in Nizam alone.\n\nBTW, Vamsanikokkadu is slated to just manage a 50 + run in Raj in vijayawada.\n\nDoes that tell something!!!!!\n\nKumar\n\nAnil Kumar Sunkara (asun...@cne.gmu.edu) wrote:\n\n: THIS IS IN REFERENCE TO THE NEWS ABOUT BIG BOSS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n: Anil K.
