        "text": "üåü Celebrating the outstanding team effort of our High Performance Club winners! üåü A huge thank you to Ian Mackenize-Smith, Marcus Ascensao, Mate Szegedi, Clayton Webb, Ryan Ashton, Sam Dhaliwal, Alistair Mackenzie, Peter Mizon, Jed Heenan, and Tom Davis. Your collective efforts truly embody our organisational ethos of resilience, innovation, and unwavering dedication to excellence. Even in the face of adversity, you've exemplified our core values, earning high praise from our customers. \"They have all gone above and beyond when it comes to resolving the issues we have had. I know that when I have a fault and I call through to get one of them to attend, I will get the best results that can be achieved. The team have done this with a can-do attitude that supports us from the moment we call, until the completion of the work.\" Your ability to navigate complex systems and faults with effective communication and a collaborative spirit ensures seamless coordination between on-site engineers, office staff, and our customers. Your contributions have not only alleviated operational hurdles but also instilled confidence among stakeholders, reinforcing the reliability of our services. This is a wonderful example of the 1% actions that help us deliver Premium Service every day. Thank you, Ian, Marcus, Mate, Clayton, Ryan, Sam, Alistair, Peter, Jed, and Tom. #TIS #HighPerformanceClub #TeamEffort #PremiumService #EmployeeRecognition\n\nLet's say your team has been working on a special project. You had hard deadlines, and the effort put extraordinary demands on certain team members. But they did it, and you got through it for a successful outcome. So now what? Do you just move on to the next project, or do you take the opportunity to spotlight team members who stand out? I would say the latter! We can incorporate short segments for recognition into meetings where we spotlight and appreciate people by highlighting their hard work and dedication in general but also calling out specific instances of going above and beyond. It doesn't have to be fancy, but it should be meaningful. Consider these benefits: ‚û°Ô∏è This type of recognition will make your team feel valued and appreciated, and it may very well motivate them to work even harder. ‚û°Ô∏è It will also boost your team's confidence and job satisfaction. ‚û°Ô∏è You will reinforce the cultural values of accountability, rewarding work and fun. If you're like me, you want to make sure your team feels seen, valued, and appreciated but your mind is already racing to the next thing. So, next time you're finishing up a major project, consider taking a few moments to recognize the people who really stood out and the overall team accomplishment. You'll likely find that taking time to celebrate is just as important (and healthy) for you as much as it is for your team. üòâ\n\nQ1 was my first quarter as a frontline manager‚Äîa journey marked by collaboration, strategy, and determination. Alongside my team, I dove into the trenches, helping every individual carrying a quota hit their marks. Juggling my own responsibilities, onboarding new team members, and refining workflows, it was a whirlwind of success, although not without its challenges and lessons. But now, as Q2 creeps to the midway point, there's room to breathe, to reflect, and to iterate. We've laid the groundwork, fostering trust and camaraderie, and now it's time to elevate. Q1 was about building that essential foundation, instilling trust and confidence in each other. Q2 presents a new phase‚Äîa time to push boundaries, to set our sights higher, both individually and collectively. It's not merely about meeting expectations set by the company or management; it's about surpassing them, about each team member raising their personal bar. We must all aspire to more, to craft meticulous plans and execute them with precision. Y'all are my rockstar of a team!

As s consequence, you investigate and discover that neither you not your colleague were completely right, however you know understand the task far better. Do you: A) Spend time doing an analysis showing that your colleague was wrong, then set up a meeting with them to show them. Only then do you start applying your newfound understanding to progress with the task people are waiting for. You aren‚Äôt able to finish it before tomorrow‚Äôs team call, but you do update everyone that yoir colleague was wrong. B) Think about the task again in light of what you‚Äôve learnt, plan how to apply it, then finish it. You update the team that it‚Äôs done in the team call the next day, adding a brief explanation of what you learnt thanks to the challenge from your colleague. If you pick option B, you: 1) Save yourself time 2) Save your colleague time 3) Get more valid work done 4) Contribute to creating a team atmosphere which is focussed on understanding not winning 5) Trade a petty win over a colleague that achieves nothing valid for a real win for your company.\n\nToday our 11 person executive management team held an offsite to get through usual company challenges. We argued. We laughed. We educated each other. We learned. We breaked. We came together. It was a long day :). At the end we had a dinner scheduled and everyone was still excited for it and we had a dinner reservation in Greek Town. We had about a 90 minute break from one another ü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏èand we‚Äôd meet at the restaurant. When I got, there four LaSallians were already half a drink in and smiles glued to their faces. We ate. We drank. We laughed. I tried to leave a few times because I‚Äôm always anxious that people are staying out for me. One person was sick and fought through the day and tried to fight through dinner and left. And two others with young babies, left after dinner. But not without a million texts. Eight people walked across the street and after a couple drinks I did an Irish exit (insert St Patrick‚Äôs day jokeü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è‚òòÔ∏è). Why post? I‚Äôm sitting on my couch and smiling. A bunch of ‚Äúthank you for dinners‚Äù later. But really because‚Ä¶work should be FUN. You should like who you do it with. You should enjoy what you do. You should have a common goal. You should be able to call each other out (which we did a lot of!) And after it‚Äôs all said and done, you should be able to have drinks and dinner and laugh and share stories. Because, without the relationships, the wins are shallow. The world is a different place, but the connection to people is so important and I‚Äôm afraid that‚Äôs what has gotten lost these past four years‚Ä¶. Everyone should have deep and heart felt relationships with their team. It‚Äôs the sweetness that goes on top of the wins. The best part is, it was fun, and what made it great was someone said ‚Ä¶there are so many others at our company who will rise in the ranks and could fit easily. One of the best parts of a career is being on a team and building something together.\n\n‚≠ê March‚Äôs Olly Olly All Stars ‚≠ê \"A huge congratulations to Shannon K. and Julian V. both. You truly embody Olly Olly‚Äôs values every day! What do their managers say about them? ‚ÄúShannon is always smiling. She has a great attitude and comes in every day fired up to work. She is always willing to help others out. She is one of the hardest workers in the office, often staying up late calling Hawaii and Alaska at night. Shannon is one of the most curious people in the office. If she runs into a new or weird situation, she will look toward more experienced rep or manager. She is skilled herself, but she is always curious how other people would handle things so she can constantly grow. Shannon is known for showing up for her teammates, whether it is help with a demo, or hanging out on a Saturday afternoon, you can count on Shannon.‚Äù ‚ÄúJulian consistently embodies our company values and excels in his role, but he's recently gone above and beyond for our entire team. He exemplifies initiative by taking ownership of improving processes. He identified a bottleneck in our new build writing efficiency and, without prompting, dedicated the past three months to developing a new system. Julian's dedication extends beyond just his own work. He readily helps his colleagues, ensuring a positive and supportive team environment. This willingness to share his knowledge and expertise contributes significantly to the overall success of the department.‚Äù #leadwithhumilityandcuriosity #showupforoneanother #teamwork"
