        "text": "Vedam–A Positive Belief System For The Next Generation-\n\nHow To live Your Life-Prana Kishore\n\nVedam is a positive belief system on how to live your life. Many sanskrit words do not have equivalent words in English and they cannot be translated.Intentionally few Telugu words have been written on the side to understand the beauty of the words by those who know Telugu.Telugu words have been written in English as the next generation know Telugu but cannot read.\n\nThis is helpful to Baby Boomers and other generations as well.\n\nWhat is the deference between Vedas and Vedam?\n\nThe Vedas (Sanskrit véda “knowledge“) are a large body of texts originating in ancient India. Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of Hinduism.The Vedas are apauruṣeya (“not of human agency”).They are supposed to have been directly revealed, and thus are called śhruti (“what is heard”),distinguishing them from other religious texts, which are called smṛti (“what is remembered”). In Hindu tradition, the creation of Vedas is credited to Brahma.The Vedic texts or śhruti are organized around four canonical collections of metrical material known as Saṃhitās, of which the first three are related to the performance of yajna (sacrifice) in historical Vedic religion:\n\nThe Rigveda, containing hymns to be recited by the hotar, or presiding priest;\n\nThe Yajurveda, containing formulas to be recited by the adhvaryu or officiating priest;\n\nThe Samaveda, containing formulas to be sung by the udgatar or priest that chants;\n\nThe Atharvaveda, a collection of spells and incantations, apotropaic charms and speculative hymns.[9]\n\nThe individual verses contained in these compilations are known as mantras. Some selected Vedic mantras are still recited at prayers, religious functions and other auspicious occasions in contemporary Hinduism.\n\nAncient powerful Mantras on all Gods 50 of them in sanskrit are composed and sang by Prana Kishore in his album”Om Shri Rama Hanuman Raksha” available at http://www.pranakishore.com and I Tunes,Amazon worldwide.These mantras are mixed with real sounds of Holy river Ganga and other rivers,Temple bells,rare birds to be effctive as Music Therapy to bring the temple inside your living room.It is enough if you know these 50 Mantras to be a true Hindu\n\nVedam\n\nIs God There?\n\nGod Is There\n\nThe belief system is Vedam\n\nDevudu unnada ?\n\nDevudu Unnadu\n\nOka namakam is vedam (telugu words)\n\nAnimals have no common sense (Budhi) nor have Karma.Human beings have both.\n\nDevathalu (Angels)are in swargam(heaven)as long as they have their punyam (Credit for Good deeds).\n\nOnce the punyam (Credit for good deeds) expires they fall to the earth(Bhulokam )\n\nEarth (Bhulokam) has humans with Happiness,sadness,pleasures and difficulties\n\nWhat is it we should do to reach Ishwara,Shiva,God ?\n\nWho has to tell us how we should live and How we should pray ?\n\nIshwara ( God )only can tell us about this.\n\nThis is Vedam\n\nIshwarudu Vakku is vedam\n\nShiva or Gods word is Vedam\n\nHow to live ? What to do is vedam Given by Ishwara,Shiva or God\n\nHow to reach god is vedam\n\nShruthi is not in written form. It is in spoken form\n\nHow to reach god is vedam spoken as shruthi\n\nShruthi is spoken from Teachers (guru) to Students, it is not written in books\n\nVedam is very very old, ancient, would it work now in our modern world ?\n\nVedam works even in today’s time because,\n\nThe way we breath many many years back and now is the same.\n\nThat’s vedam.That is the truth\n\nVedam says no need to change,since it is the truth\n\nIshwara said no need to change vedams\n\nSmrithi is in written form.\n\nSmrithi can be also be in spoken form too\n\nHow to reach God?\n\nTemple (Devalayam) is a way to reach God\n\nAt Temples in the evening,spiritual discourses( pravachanams ) are conducted.\n\nDisourse (Pravachanam) is showing how everything happened in vedam\n\nIts like showing to you in a magnifying glass\n\nAt Temples evening discourses are Ramayanam\n\nIts for people to listen and learn about Dharma (Right way of living) for people to practice in day to day life. It’s a way to help people.\n\nWhat is the definition of Dharma?\n\nIn short ”right way of living” or “Path of Righteousness”.\n\nDharma signifies behaviors that are considered to be in accord with order that makes life and universe possible,and includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and ”right way of living” or Path of righteousness. The Classical Sanskrit noun dharma is a derivation from the root dhṛ, which has a meaning of “to hold, maintain, keep”.The meaning of word “dharma” depends on the context, and its meaning evolved as ideas of Hinduism developed over its long history.\n\nVedam is shruthi and Shruthi is Shastram (Specialised Knowledge)\n\nAccept vedam as a promise since it is the truth\n\nPractice vedam to reach God\n\nNever argue against vedam\n\nNever argue with people who do not believe in god or vedam,its a waste of time.\n\nPeople belief system develops by the way they are raised from child hood.\n\nPeople belief system changes with age,some believe in God at a later age or many not believe at all in this birth. That’s their fate.\n\nWe cannot change it.\n\nWe should not try to force people who do not believe in God\n\nTo reach God how do you know god is there?\n\nSince you did not see God? or Speak to God\n\nEarth is rotating you. You have accepted earth\n\nDid you see Earth rotating? Did you not accept it as earth without questioning?\n\nWhen you see something beautiful You want to know who is the owner?\n\nwho created it?\n\nGod created (shusti) nature.\n\nDo you Know who created nature ? Sun? moon ? mountains?\n\nrivers ? seas? birds? flowers?\n\nGod created them\n\nHumans everyone are alike 2 hands,2 legs,1 Head, 2 eyes.2 Ears,1 Mouth etc\n\nThey have hunger and they need to sleep.\n\nWho is making you breath when you Sleep?\n\nYou don’t see person who is doing all this? If you accept all this Why is it you are not accepting God Because you don’t see him\n\nNarasimha avataram came to prove to to child Prahaladhu where God is.\n\nGod is there everywhere.\n\nNarasimha, is 4th Avatar of Vishnu came to prove God is every where\n\nNarasimha is often visualised as half-man/half-lion, having a human-like body,with a lion-like face and claws.This image is widely worshipped in deity form by a significant number of Vaishnava groups. He is known primarily as the ‘Great Protector’ who specifically defends and protects his devotees in times of need.\n\nHiranya asked Prahaladha if he shows any where will vishnu come?\n\nPrahaladhu believed vishnu is there and every where\n\nPrahaladhu came to know from Narada through shruthi\n\nVishnu wanted to make the belief of Prahaladhu come true\n\nHiranya asks Prahaladha if Vishnu is there in this pillar.\n\nPrahaladha said Yes Vishnu is there in this pillar.\n\nVishnu comes as Narasimha from pillar and kills Hiranya kasikudu\n\nVishnu wanted to make the belief of Prahaladhu come true\n\nIs God There?\n\nGod Is There\n\nThe belief system is Vedam\n\nIn our body we have 5 elements of earth.\n\nGod created this body and placed the mouth,eyes,ears,stomach in the right place.\n\nFire (Agni) goes up water goes down\n\nWhen u drink water through mouth,Water goes down to stomach due to gravity\n\nAgni vapour goes up from stomach.\n\nImagine if God placed Mouth where stomach is and place stomach where our mouth is.When we drink water can the water go up?\n\nwhen we cook rice in a vessel\n\nImagine if reverse happens,\n\nWater going up\n\nAgni vapour going down\n\nCan we cook rice?

Brahmins are generally very educated.\n\nShudrulu or Non Brahmins can also read vedams\n\nVedams are not restricted to Brahmins alone.\n\nPeople who are selected to be on stage it’s Dharmam (Rule/tradition) to speak People who come as audience to listen must Just listen that’s Dharmam.\n\nThis is Sabha Dharmam( rules or traditions of a function)\n\nVedam only will say what’s Brahman Role is in life\n\nVedam only says whats sanyasins role is in life.(Brahmachari-one who gives up a married life)\n\nVedam only says what Each one of us role is in life\n\nGruhas ashramam is all about Married life\n\ndoing good to every one is most difficult\n\nSanyas Ashramam is all about you Discovering your self\n\nVedam gives happiness.\n\nVedam is tool and way to reach Ishwara\n\nRespect pujari’s,priests and veda pandits\n\nPl namaskar all veda pandits,Pujaris,priests where ever you see them\n\ntouch their feet and seek their blessings.They are the persons who convey your wishes to God through mantras,archanas,puja in the temple.\n\nwe do not know which God is residing in which priest as god is there in every person and God is everywhere.\n\nIs God There?\n\nGod Is There\n\nThe belief system is Vedam which teaches you how to live a great life\n\nAll this helps you develop a great winning Positive attitude to succeed.\n\nThere is no need to search for answers to questions.Our religion\n\nHinduism and Vedam has all the answers from Ishwara,God\n\nwe just have to slow down and look inside than outside for everything.\n\nJoin me in this quest to help others and our next Generation.\n\nSubham\n\nPrana Kishore\n\nShiva Tattvam-Shiva’s Concept -Theory For Next Gen-Prana Kishore\n\nWhat is Shiva Tattvam?\n\nA single Sanskrit-word can have many meanings.Sanskrit words cannot be truly translated into English as there are no English words for many Sanskrit words.\n\n“Tattvam” or “Tattva” means, “Theory” or Concept\n\nIt also means, “Existence”, as in “Vishnu-Tattwa” or “Jiva-Tattva”.\n\n“Tattvamasi” is found in upanishads is a combination of three words,\n\nnamely, “Tat”, “Tvam” and “Asi”.\n\n“Tat” :- That;\n\n“Tvam” :- You;\n\n“Asi” :- Are;\n\nSo, “Tattvamasi” means, “You are That”. Here, “That” refers to God. Since God exists in every one of us, it is said, “You are That” or “You are God”. Factually, however, we are not God, but only part of God as we unite finally with God\n\nHow many Tattvas are there?- 36 Tattvas of Shiva\n\nThe Samkhya school of Hinduism made the concept of tattvas their central philosophy while detailing the process of creation. There are 36 tattvas and dered as Shiva tattva is the highest. Beyond Siva tattva is the Atattva, which is not counted among the 36.\n\nAtattva – ParaShiva or formless absolute Brahman who is beyond all the tattvas, symbolized by sivalinga, experienced in the state of samadhi\n\nThe names of the 36 tattvas and their descriptions are as below.\n\n1- 5 are Iswara-tattvas. They belong to the pure worlds.\n\n6-10 are Shakti-tattvas.\n\n11-16 are recognized as atma-tattvas .\n\n17 – 36 are prakriti-tattvas. Through them Prakriti manifests gross bodies, organs, senses, sense-objects and other things of gross material.\n\nLets discuss 36 tattvas in a saparate blog\n\nLord Shiva is a formless eternal and mysterious being with many aspects and dimensions. He is both transcendental and immanent, who cannot be quantified and qualified objectively with our limited awareness. He is beyond our mind and senses, but within the reach of our experience and awakening.\n\nHow To Worship Lord Siva\n\nIn the Sivapurana it has been told that once Sanatkumara was traveling in an aircraft and happened to see sage Parasara, practicing austerities\n\n(tapas ) on the banks of the river Saraswathi. Sanatkumara stopped by and asked the latter the reason for being at such a lonely place. Sage Parasara replied that having done his ordained duties as a teacher and helped lots of students to gain knowledge, he decided to practice austerities for his own salvation. Sanatkumara then revealed to him the knowledge he received earlier from Nandikeswara and suggested him to practice mananam, sravanam and kirtanam instead of austerities as effective means of attaining the grace of Lord Siva and achieve liberation. These three means are explained below.\n\nMananam: Uttering the Siva mantras or prayers, contemplating or meditating upon the grandeur and significance of Siva or the sacred texts of Saivism and performing similar mental activities.\n\nSravanam: Listening from others, or in a gathering of Siva’s devotees, about Lord Siva, the concepts of Saivism, the books on Saivism, the life and activities of Nayanars or other devotees of Siva.\n\nKirtanam: Singing the glory of Lord Siva either alone or in the company of other devotees. When it is done in groups it is called bhajan. Devotional singing helps the mind become stabilized in God.\n\nThe Worship of Sivalinga\n\nAccording to the Sivapurana, in the age of Kali (kaliyuga) ,worship of Siva in the form of Sivalinga is the best means of liberation. Woship of Sivalinga can be done either at home or in a Siva temple or a sacred place such as the banks of a sacred river. The linga has to be worshipped by the traditional means (sadupachara) of\n\ndhyana, (meditate on Shiva)\n\navahana,(Invite him to your home)\n\nasana,(request him to sit)\n\npadya,(Giving water to wash his Feet)\n\narghya,(Giving water to wach his hands)\n\nachamaniya,(Give him water Ganga)\n\nabhisheka, ( Pouring water,milk on the linga)\n\nvastra,(adoring him with cloth,dress)\n\nbhasma,( applying Vibhudhi)\n\ngandha,(Applying Sandalwood)\n\nakshata, (sprinkling Rice )\n\npushpa,(praying with flowers)\n\nbilva,( Offer Bilva tree Leaves so dear to Shiva)\n\ndhupa,(lightening the agarbathi)\n\ndipa,(lightening the lamp)\n\nnaivedya, ( offering prasad,food to him)\n\ntambula,(offering betel leaf,nut,)\n\nmahanirajana,Praying Shiva’s another name Maha Niranjana\n\nmantrapushpa,(Repeate mantra and offer him)\n\nnamaskara (Pray folding both your hands)in Namaste position\n\nprardhana.(Make your requests to Shiva for his blessings to grant your wishes)\n\nThe Significance of Sivalinga\n\nAs the highest reality Siva is both Saguna (with form and qualities) and Nirguna (without form and qualities). The Siva linga is a rendering of Siva in his formless or nirguna aspect. Saguna Siva is known by his five aspects known as panchanana aspect and there are temples in India where we can see a Sivalinga having five faces representing these five aspects. According to the followers of Saivism, Nirguan Siva is the highest reality, the absolute principle, the formless unknown Self of all and the one indivisible Supreme Reality. Sivalinga represents this aspect of Siva and therefore its worship is considered to be the highest form of worship we can perform.\n\nWhy Perform Abhisheka To Shiva?\n\nPerform Abhishekam with water and milk to shiva lingam to solve any and all problems and for (chaladhanam) to keep your body,mind,calm in peace.\n\nAbhishekam can be done with water, milk, ghee, curd, pasupu, etc\n\nSpatika Lingam\n\nSphatikam (Quartz) is the mineral in the Earth’s continental crust, after feldspar. Sphatikam is made up of a continuous framework of SiO4 silicon–oxygen tetrahedra, with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra, giving an overall formula SiO2. In short it comprise one part silicon and two parts oxygen. Quartz belongs to the trigonal crystal system. The ideal crystal shape is a six-sided prism terminating with six-sided pyramids at each end. Sphatikam is the semi-precious gemstone. There are many different varieties of sphatikam. High quality quartz crystals are single-crystal silica with optical or electronic properties that make them suitable for hardstone carvings. The Hindu temples in South India use this semi-precious mineral for making Shiva Lingams. Sphatikam beads are made from translucent rose quartz are cut and polished as beads. Each bead is about ten millimeters in diameter. It is good conductor of heat. Hence people wear sphatikam jewelry (mala) to keep their body cool. Some other people claim that these beads have healing properties.\n\nIn Hindu Shiva temples, Saiva Agamas allow to worship Lord Shiva in the form of Sphatika Lingam. Sphatika Lingam is representing the icon of Lord Nataraja. The Sphatika Lingams are protected in the sanctum sanctorum of Lord Shiva. Hindu priests offer Milk, Water, or Vhibuti consecrations to the Sphatika Lingam. They also chant 108 times Shiva Panchakshari Mantra. It is believed that Sphatika Lingam removes all curses and negative karma and will enhance ones confidence and power.\n\nWhat Size Linga should one buy?\n\nPeople who pray at home must always buy linga of height less then your forefinger when folded into fists. This is your strength as a human being to buy for doing pujas at home.If you buy any idol more than this size you can keep it as decorative item at home.If you buy any idol more than this size you need to keep it in a temple and do pujas like in a temple.\n\nHow do you know Spatika Linga is Pure ?\n\nSpatika linga when you pour pasupu it turns yellow,with kumkum it turns red,\n\nShiva’s Miracle in Kalahasti ?\n\nPriests do abhishekam to siva linga at Kalahasti temple and immerse the linga in water.Once the water covers the linga,the sky becomes dark and it will start raining.People do this for rain in Kalahasti which is other wise a hot place.\n\nSiva Linga at Kalahasti (AP) India\n\nConcept of Time\n\nTime eats everything.\n\nWhen time keeps moving Our bodies start deteriorating, as we age with time\n\nTime we lost can never be gained.\n\nGet up before sunrise and start your daily chores.Watch the sun for 1minute.\n\nYou will gain positive energy from sun.
