        "text": "The Sri Yantra is a form of mystical diagram, known as a yantra, found in the Shri Vidya school of Hindu tantra.\n\nThe diagram is formed by nine interlocking triangles that surround and radiate out from the central (bindu) point.\n\nWhen the two-dimensional Sri Chakra is projected into three dimensions, it is called a maha meru. Mount Meru derives its name from this Meru-like shape.\n\nIn religion[edit]\n\nIt[which?] represents the goddess in her form of Shri Lalita or Tripura Sundari, \"the beauty of the three worlds\": Bhu Loka (Physical Plane, Consciousness of the Physical Plane), Bhuvar Loka (Antariksha or Intermediate Space, Consciousness of the Prana) and Swar Loka (Svarga, Heaven, Consciousness of the Divine Mind).\n\nThe worship of the Sri Chakra is central to the Shri Vidya system of Hindu worship. Four isosceles triangles with the apices upwards, representing Shiva or the Masculine. Five isosceles triangles with the apices downward, symbolizing female embodiment Shakti. Thus the Sri Yantra also represents the union of Masculine and Feminine Divine. Because it is composed of nine triangles, it is known as the Navayoni Chakra.[1]\n\nThese nine triangles are of various sizes and intersect with one another. In the middle is the power point (bindu), visualizing the highest, the invisible, elusive centre from which the entire figure and the cosmos expand. The triangles are enclosed by two rows of (8 and 16) petals, representing the lotus of creation and reproductive vital force. The broken lines of the outer frame denote the figure to be a sanctuary with four openings to the regions of the universe.[2]\n\nIn a recent[when?] issue of Brahmavidya, the journal of the Adyar Library, Subhash Kak argues that the description of Sri Yantra is identical to the yantra described in the Śvetāśvatara Upanisad.[3]\n\nTogether the nine triangles are interlaced in such a way as to form 43 smaller triangles in a web symbolic of the entire cosmos or a womb symbolic of creation. Together they express Advaita or non-duality. This is surrounded by a lotus of eight petals, a lotus of sixteen petals, and an earth square resembling a temple with four doors.[1] The various deities residing in the nine layers of the Sri Yantra are described in the Devi Khadgamala Mantra.\n\nThe Sri Chakra is also known as the nav chakra because it can also be seen as having nine levels. \"Nine\" comes from \"Nau or Nava\" of Sanskrit. Each level corresponds to a mudra, a yogini, and a specific form of the deity Tripura Sundari along with her mantra. These levels starting from the outside or bottom layer are:[1]\n\nTrailokya Mohan or Bhupar, a square of three lines with four portals\n\nSarva Aasa Paripurak, a sixteen-petal lotus\n\nSarva Sankshobahan, an eight-petal lotus\n\nSarva Saubhagyadayak, composed of fourteen small triangles\n\nSarva Arthasadhak, composed of ten small triangles\n\nSarva Rakshakar, composed of ten small triangles\n\nSarva Rogahar, composed of eight small triangles\n\nSarva Siddhiprada, composed of 1 small triangle\n\nSarva Anandamay, composed of a point or bindu\n\nThe Sri Chakra (called the Shri Yantra) is the symbol of Hindu tantra, which is based on the Hindu philosophy of Kashmir Shaivism. The Sri Yantra is the object of devotion in Sri Vidya.\n\nIn temples[edit]\n\nAadi shankaracharya sthapita Dharma mahasamsthana Dakshninamnaya Peetham Sringeri Sharadamba Temple .\n\nMuttakkulam Devi Temple Kattachira Kayamkulam Kerala\n\nMaa Pitambara Bagulamukhi Mahakal Temple Guraiya Chindwara Madhya Pradesh India[4]\n\nŚri Chakra Mahameru Peetham in Koradacheri,Tamil Nadu\n\nŚhree Kshetra Hedavde Mahalaxmi, Optimised Sri Yantra intsalled by Sri Sri Dada Hatey\n\nPashupatinath Temple, Nepal, At the roof of Ganga Mai temple (This temple is carved in shape of meru shri yantra)\n\nŚri Chakra Man with 10 claws, Blacktown Temple, Shivashivashivamanium\n\nŚri Yantra carved on Stone in Mahalaxmi Temple Kolhapur Maharashtra, it installed by Adi Shankaracharya.(This temple is shape of meru shri yantra)\n\nAdiparashakti (Tripurasundari Rajarajeshwari) Chapel, Anand Ashram Ubud (Bali) - where the Personification or Vigraha of Śri Yantra is installed and worshiped daily\n\nKamakshi temple, Jonnawada, Nellore\n\nKamakshi temple, Kanchipuram\n\nKalikambal temple, Chennai\n\nKamakshi temple, Mangadu, Chennai\n\nŚri Kali Temple, Outside Sanganeri Gate, MotiDunri Road, Jaipur\n\nNimishamba temple, SriRangapatana, Mysore District, Karnataka.\n\nPrasanna Meenakshi Temple, Shivanasamudra, Malavalli Tk, Mandya Dist, Karnataka.\n\nKollur Mookambike Temple, Udupi dist, Karnataka\n\nMatrubhuteshwar Temple, Sri Ramanasramam, Tiruvannamalai installed by Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi\n\nAt Kamakhya Temple, Guwahati, Assam (This mandir itself in the shape of shree yantra)\n\nPuthenkavil Devi Temple, Cherumukha, Nooranad, Alapphuzha, Kerala\n\nŚri Tyagarajaswamy udanurai Vadivudai amman temple Thyagaraja Temple, Tiruvottiyur\n\nŚri Chakra MahaMeru Temple in Thrikkuttissery, near Balussery in Kozhikode District, Kerala, India.\n\nSri Maha Meru engraved in rock inside the Arapaleeshwarar Shiva temple, Kolli Hills\n\nSri Mah Meru Dhyana Nilayam, Panruti-Kandigai, Near Oragadam (Royal Enfield Factory), 631604 [1] [archive]\n\nShri Laxminarayan Temple, Orchha, Madhya Pradesh.\n\nShri Raja Rajeshwari Temple, RR nagar, Mysore Road, Bangalore\n\nSri Narasimha Swamy Temple (9 Temple Complex), Aho Bilam, Andhra Pradesh 518553\n\nDurga Parmeshwari Temple, at Uppunda, Udupi District, Karnataka.
