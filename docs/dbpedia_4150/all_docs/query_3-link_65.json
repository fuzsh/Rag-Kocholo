        "text": "We are spirit souls encaged within the material body made of five gross elements – air, earth, fire, water, and ether and are meant to remain in the spiritual realm. This is the wisdom of scriptural literature and the teachings of great saints and sages. The human body possesses seven Chakras or subtle energy channels within. When awakened and tapped into, these focal points steer a flow of energy throughout the gross and subtle bodies and harmonize the mental, physical, and spiritual well-being of the individual. According to Hinduism and Buddhist belief systems, there are seven main Chakras and each Chakra is associated with certain qualities and aspects of consciousness. Visualizing these Chakras within or meditating on their symbolic representations as prescribed in Tantra artwork is one of the many ways of spiritual awakening and advancement.\n\nExotic India is delighted to offer this vast collection of Chakra art paintings to cater to all your purposes. Showcasing the divine symbols of Chakra, these have been hand-painted by skilled artisans who know the art of Tantra and spiritual bliss. This collection is a tapestry of colors and geometrical elements that reach beyond the scope of our senses and ignite the sacred fire within. Apart from being meditational and visualization tools, these masterpieces are perfect as wall art decor as well. The Sri Yantra, the mother of all Yantras, is the symbolic personification of the divine feminine energy (Shakti) that creates, maintains, and annihilates the material cosmos. Consisting of interlocking triangles, circles, squares, and lotus petals, it represents the union of Shakti and Shaktiman (Shiva).\n\nImbued with a touch and element of a traditional style of painting, each art painting in this collection is a testament to the artistic culture of a region while also preserving the spiritual significance of the figure. Some of our paintings feature the fascinating Madhubani form of art from Bihar, India, which is full of vibrant colors and intricate traditional motifs. Other paintings display the details of the distinct Pattachitra art from Orissa, India, on Tussar Silk. These enchanting features make each Chakra wall painting the emblem of pristine beauty and allow the viewers to embark on the journey of self-discovery and spiritual enlightenment at the same time.\n\nQ. What are the benefits of meditating on Chakra paintings?\n\nChakra paintings depict the energetic channels within the human body or the symbolic representation of various divine energies in the spiritual realm. Meditating upon these artworks helps harmonize one’s overall well-being, tap into their spiritual awakening, and heal their emotional traumas.\n\nQ. Are Chakra paintings suitable for home decor and personal expression?\n\nYes, you can absolutely add Chakra paintings to your home decor and use them as personal expression. Designed in vibrant colors and representational symbols, these paintings not only appear aesthetically pleasing to the eyes but also act as tools for meditation and healing.\n\nQ. Where can I display Chakra paintings?\n\nChakra paintings can be displayed in various spaces including homes, offices, or schools (for educational purposes). At your home, you can hang these divine paintings on the living room or bedroom wall. You may also display them in your hallway to give your visitors a flow of positive energy as they enter. For meditational purposes, you can put Chakra paintings in your meditation room or the dedicated area for your daily ritual practices to stay aloof and focus on the inner work."
