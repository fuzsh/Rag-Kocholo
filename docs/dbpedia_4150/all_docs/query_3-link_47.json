        "text": "#newdaynewchapter Chapter 1134: April 7,2024 Chanakya Niti 614:\"It is not strange if a man reviles degrades things that he has no knowledge of, like ignorant people throw away precious stones and look for piece of glass\" Sanatan Dharma is a way of life where the purpose is to become completely spiritual in every aspect of living, thinking, feeling and willing.Because Hindu religion is way too complex. Whereas the Western template of religion is simple: One god, One book, One life - Jews, Christianity and Islam are based on the belief in God as per the word of God sent Messenger - Jesus etc. Move to Buddhism and Jainism, there is supreme being that is at the centre of liberation from human life. Follow his advise and get liberated. Now Hinduism, Vaishavas say Vishnu is supreme, but wait, Shaivaites claim Shiva as supreme. Hold on, Shaktas say Devi is supreme. And, why is then Indra called lord of heaven? Is Indra powerful than Vishnu? We have many books, so many gods, and so many lives to be born into. Hindu religion is not based on belief but on seeking ultimate reality through experiments, observation etc. There is no concept of God's Messenger because God himself was born on this land in various avatars. It is not against material life, but it is against materialism as the goal of life. The goal of life according to Sanatan Dharma is to steadily make everything spiritual by offering it to the Supreme Being as Bhakti or devotion. Lord Krishna says in Shrimad Bhagwad Geeta9/27: “O son of Kunti, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me.” Hinduism truly understood life and man. Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha are valid aims of life. The main thing is not to get too attached, and transcend it at some point in life. Brahmachari, Grihasta, Vanaprastha Sannyasa are 4 stages of life. Hinduism has no single founder. There is no single religious book or one single source of religious authority. It does not demand that adherents follow one path, but instead allows individuals to choose muliple paths. Some worship demigods, other practice yoga or asceticism, and some serve others. Enlightenment rather than salvation is the end goal. It is able to synchronize concepts and beliefs from other religions. It is able to coexist with other ways of understanding the world like science. Hinduism is about respecting and trying to giving back to nature, what you have taking/consuming all our life from it. That is why Hindus believe in worshiping the Sun, Moon, Planets and Cows etc. Moreover there are many animals and birds as vehicles of Gods thereby giving respect. Nature have given us life, we need to make sure that the ecosystem remains intact and healthy. so, you will find many Hindu scripts which directly or indirectly link to saving the nature. Hinduism says to attain eternal liberation and peace as Moksha. Take Care and God Bless 🙏\n\nDirect Pointing at the ultimate Mind It is the most effective way to attain the Way ( enlightenment ( in Ch'an Buddhism. It is particularly suitable for sharp people of superior root, as their minds are less disturbed by worldly matters, thus always at ease. They can be easily awakened by just a few words. The Ch'an masters use point at the ultimate mind, so that their followers can eradicate all attachment, not only to the phenomenal world around them, but also to the subtle view of self [我] and things/Dharma [法]. As a result, their disciples immediately understands Para Vidya ( ultimate truth ) by the dialogues between the masters and their followers. In Ch'an Buddhism, it is important to realize the sameness of noumenal and phenomenal, i.e. the oneness of all. Even this 'Dharma' is but an integral part of our Buddha-nature. Thus, all traces of Dharmas are eradicated so as to reveal the absolute, which is neither Dharma nor non-Dharma, and thus beyond all dualisms. The Forty Transmission Gathas are generally used in Ch'an Buddhism for the practice of direct pointing at the ultimate mind. These Gathas are recorded in the book called The Transmission of Lamp [傳燈錄]. These Gathas, which are related to the ultimate-mind Dharmas, were composed by the 7 ancient Buddhas, the 27 Patriarchs in India and the 6 Ch'an Patriarchs Patriarchs in China, For instance, Shakyamuni Buddha said in his Gatha when transmitting the Dharma to Mahakasyapa, The Dharma's fundamental Dharma has no Dharma, The Dharma of No-Dharma is Dharma too, Now that the Dharma of No-Dharma is transmitted, Has there ever been a Dharma❓️🤔 May all sentient beings attain the Way. Namo Amituofo ❗️ 🙏🙏🙏🪷🪷🪷\n\n🙏🕉️🕉️🕉️🙏 Hinduism is the most perfect Dharma on this earth. Hinduism is not a religion. Hinduism is called as Sanatana Dharma as it is present since the “aadi kalam” (unknown time frame) and will definitely last long for the “ananta kalam” (unknown infinite time frame). This means Sanatana Dharma is eternal, everlasting, never-ending, endless, perpetual, undying, immortal, imperishable, etc. Sanatana also means which is opposite of ‘anatha’, that is, orphan. Sanatana Dharma can never be anatha (orphan). Sananata Dharma was first started by directly Lord Vishnu. Sanatana Dharma is as old as Lord Vishnu himself. Now, let us understand the meaning of the words Shukla Paksha and Krishna Paksha in a very simple way. In Sanskrit Shukla means brightness and Krishna means darkness. Both Shukla and Krishna are the names of Lord Vishnu (Krishna / Rama) himself. Meaning of Shukla ... In Sri Vishnusahasra Nama, the first shloka itself starts from the word Shukla as given below: शुक्लाम्बरधरं विष्णुं शशिवर्णं चतुर्भुजम् । प्रसन्नवदनं ध्यायेत् सर्वविघ्नोपशान्तये ॥ 1 ॥ śuklāmbaradharaṁ viṣṇuṁ śaśivarṇaṁ caturbhujam। prasannavadanaṁ dhyāyēt sarvavighnōpaśāntayē॥ 1॥ Meaning of shloka (Not the full meaning ...Only the Shukla related meaning) : Here Lord Vishnu is called as śuklāmbaradharaṁ viṣṇuṁ O Lord Vishnu, you are the one who have the color like the wide white sky (brightest). Here nīla mēgha varṇaṁ ... means, Lord Krishna (Vishnu) is someone who has the “body color of cloud ... just before the rain“. Even Lord Panduranga (nīla mēgha varṇaṁ) has the same meaning (Lord Panduranga / Vittala of Pandharpur). Panduranga is Sanskrit word and not Marathi word. Lord Vishnu (Krishna / Rama) have both colors, that is, brightness and darkness and thus he is known as Shukla and Krishna. Sometimes, Lord Vishnu takes the form of Shukla (brightness) and sometimes takes the form of Krishna (darkness). But we should always remember that, Lord Vishnu has both the colors, that is, brightness and darkness. Also we should note that, there is no difference between Lord Vishnu or any of his avatars like Lord Krishna, Lord Rama etc. Let us know the meaning of Shukla Paksha and Krishna Paksha now: Shukla Paksha meaning : Shukla Paksha means brightness, that is, Lord Chandra (Moon) moving from darkness to brightness. In English it is called as waxing, that is, from waning Moon (dark Moon) towards waxing Moon (bright Moon). Krishna Paksha meaning : Krishna Paksha means darkness, that is, Lord Chandra (Moon) moving from brightness to darkness. In English it is called as waning, that is, from waxing Moon (bright Moon) towards waning Moon (dark Moon). As per Hindu Panchanga (Lunar calendar), in Shukla Paksha there are 15 days and in Krishna Paksha there are 15 days as given below: 👇👇👇\n\n#newdaynewchapter Shripada Adi Shankaracharya strengthened Hindu religion, spread his ideas nationwide, and through debate converted several Jains and Buddhists, but it wasn't to “save” Hinduism. In fact, Hinduism was hardly in danger at that time. He lived between 700 and 750, and was one of the most successful religious thinkers of Indian history. It was a time when Northern India was progressing towards political disturbance, but it was also a time when Hinduism was flourishing more and more. Dharma had witnessed a lot of growth under the Guptas, most of whom were staunch and devout Hindus. Even though they collapsed in the late 6th century, the Guptas left a lasting impact on the country. More importantly, the Bhakti movement had already begun and was on its peak in Draviḍa regions. Under the leadership of Āḷvārs and Nāyanārs, both Vaiṣṇava and Śaiva sects were developing and thriving in the southern states. Buddhists probably did see a powerful patron in the 7th century. Harshavardhana. However, his patronage, if he was too much of a patron at all, did little to harm the popularity of Hinduism. Indian texts describe him as a Śaiva, though he may have been supportive to Buddhists. Unlike Aśoka and Kaniṣka, he did not “spread” Buddhism. Hinduism at that time was in a powerful position. Even though the traditional Vedic yajñas had declined due to the earlier rise of Buddhism, the ideas of Bhakti proved enormously successful in resuming the spread of Vaidika Dharma, this time in a far simpler way. The compositions of the Āḷvārs and Nāyanārs became famous and this religious development led to the development of several temples and regional traditions. Shankaracharya's major contribution was in consolidating and systematizing the diverse strands of Hindu philosophy and establishing the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta as a prominent school of thought. Advaita Vedanta emphasizes the ultimate oneness of the individual soul (Atman) and the universal consciousness (Brahman). According to Shankaracharya, the material world is illusory, and true knowledge can only be attained through self-realization and the realization of the identity between the individual soul and the universal consciousness. Shankaracharya traveled extensively across India, engaging in debates and discussions with scholars and philosophers of various religious traditions. He wrote commentaries on the ancient Hindu scriptures, including the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Brahma Sutras, which provided profound interpretations and explanations of these texts from an Advaita Vedanta perspective. Shri Adi Shankaracharya Maharaj ki Jay\n\nWho is a guru ? “Only a master, one who knows God, may rightly teach others about Him. To regain one’s divinity one must have such a master or guru. He who faithfully follows a true guru becomes like him, for the guru helps to elevate the disciple to his own level of realization.”\"Guru Brahma Gurur Vishnu...Guru Devo Maheshwaraha...Guru Saakshat Para Brahma...Tasmai Sree Gurave Namaha\"Meaning:-Guru is verily the representative of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. He creates, sustains knowledge and destroys the weeds of ignorance. I salute such a Guru. The importance of finding a guru who can impart transcendental knowledge (vidyā) is emphasised in Sanatana/Hindu Dharma.The role of the guru continues in the original sense of the word in such Hindu traditions as the Vedānta, yoga, tantra and bhakti schools.In our Indian culture, a person without a guru or a teacher (acharya) was once looked down on as an orphan or unfortunate one. The word anatha in Sanskrit means \"the one without a teacher.\" An acharya is the giver of gyan (knowledge) in the form of shiksha (instruction). A guru also gives diksha initiation which is the spiritual awakening of the disciple by the grace of the guru. Diksha is also considered to be the procedure of bestowing the divine powers of a guru upon the disciple, through which the disciple progresses continuously along the path to divinity. Hindu scripture is sometimes called shastra. Since the Vedic wisdom was first transmitted orally it is also called shabda­brahman, spiritual sound. According to tradition, it was written down only when human memory began to deteriorate at the start of Kali-yuga (some 5,000 years ago). The Guru Gita (verse 17) describes the guru as “dispeller of darkness” (from gu, “darkness” and ru, “that which dispels”). A true, God-illumined guru is one who, in his attainment of self-mastery, has realized his identity with the omnipresent Spirit. Such a one is uniquely qualified to lead the seeker on his or her inward journey toward perfection.\n\nThe Ancient Hindu Code of War; Astra Shastra (अस्त्र शास्त्र) and Dhanurved Dharma is an important Sanatani, Buddhist, Jain and Yogic concept, referring to a law or principle which governs the universe. Kshatriya Dharma refers to the the duties of one of the four Varnas; To maintain law and order. To enforce the law; To serve and protect truth and dharma, by peaceful methods whenever possible, and physical violence as necessary, including surrendering one's own life to the cause. A kshatriya must protect the innocent and harmless (i.e., sadhus) from all harm. For an individual to live out their dharma is for them to act in accordance with this law. According to Hindu philosophy all Gods and Goddesses have different energy system /power as weapons- Astra and Shastras. These instruments can be regarded as an extension of their powers as without the energy of the God the weapon by itself would be hardly as powerful. Astra: The word Astra (अस्त्र) is derived from the Sanskrit root word अस् - meaning to throw. The weapons which are used by releasing these from the user’s hand or a machine, are called Astra (अस्त्र) eg. Discus, spear etc. The ‘Astra’ that is released from machine is called ‘Yantramukta’ e.g. Arrow. Shastra: The word Shastra (शस्त्र) is derived from the Sanskrit root word शस्- meaning to kill. The handheld weapons are called Shastra. Eg. Sword, mace etc. Divyastra or Devastra: The weapons associated with a particular Devi or Devta is called a Divyastra or Devastra. The weapon is be invoked by a mantra given by the Deity. Some of the famous Divyastra are Agneyastra, Nagapasha, Yamastra etc. There are instances in which even a blade of grass has been powered to become an Astra. Astra could be a invoked weapon too, in that case these would be called Divyastra. eg. Brahmastra or Pashupatiastra. These Divyastra were so powerful that they could annihilate humanity. It was forbidden to use a Divyastra against anyone who were not themselves not powerful enough to invoke them. So only if your opponent was powerful enough to invoke a particular astra then was any opposing warrior allowed to use it. Dhanurveda is the Upaveda which is associated with the Yajurveda. It is not a single book but has been talked about at different times and explains the science of warfare, weaponry, martial arts and the duties of a warrior to the ones who learn about all this. It was established for the protection of Dharma and to defend the weak. Skill level of Dhanurveda (considering archery only) from basic to advance. According to the Adiparva of Mahabharata narrates the ten angas of Dhanurveda. They are Adana, sanḍhana, mokṣaṇa, vinivarttana, sṭhana, musti, prayoga, prayaacitta, mandala and rahasya. https://lnkd.in/gQnvQuxc #spiritualbharat #dhanurveda #Astra #Shastra #अस्त्रशास्त्र #अस्त्र #शास्त्र #comic #warrior #human #science #humanfriendly #sanskrit #battlefield #courage\n\nRecently, a certain Amir Khan, with a UK-based email ID, favored Hindudvesha with his profound insights, proclaiming that Hindu Dharma is on a downward spiral, and blessed us with a rather pompous analysis of Hindu Dharma!! Hindu Dharma is often mislabeled as chaotic in contrast to monotheistic rigidity. This narrative is not just oversimplified; it's an outright misrepresentation of one of the world's oldest and most resilient spiritual traditions. Hindu Dharma isn't a relic of the past; it's a living, breathing philosophy that has thrived through millennia, offering a rich mosaic of thoughts, practices, and philosophies. Let's set the record straight: Hindu Dharma's diversity is not a weakness but its greatest strength. It fosters a culture of inquiry, debate, and spiritual exploration unparalleled in its depth and breadth. Critics who dismiss this as disorder are either ignorant or willfully blind to the sophisticated spiritual framework that allows for a multitude of paths to the divine, all while championing individual freedom and responsibility. The claim that Hindu Dharma is declining due to its inherent pluralism is a gross misunderstanding of its dynamism and adaptability. Far from spiraling downward, Hinduism has continuously evolved, absorbing and integrating a wide array of cultural and philosophical influences. This isn't the sign of a tradition in decline; it's the hallmark of a tradition that's vibrantly alive and eternally relevant. To those who predict the subjugation of Hindu Dharma and Bharat, know this: we are not a civilization that bends to the winds of conquest or conversion. The enduring stream of dharma that runs through the heart of Bharat is stronger than ever. We stand united in our diversity, proud of our ancient heritage, and confident in the wisdom of our ancestors. We don't just survive; we thrive. Hindu Dharma continues to guide millions with its timeless wisdom, and as long as we uphold its principles, it will continue to be a beacon of light and truth in a world desperately in need of both. So, to the detractors and doomsayers, we say: underestimate us at your own peril. Hindu Dharma has stood the test of time, and it will continue to flourish long into the future. Our spirit is unbreakable, our philosophy profound, and our commitment to dharma unwavering. #Hindudvesha #hindu #SanatanaDharma https://lnkd.in/g-2Y2a8V\n\n1. Synonyms of Dharma 1.1 The Sanatan religion (Sanatan Dharma) A. Origin: In ‘सना आतनोति इति सनातन: ।' sana (सना) means eternal and aatanoti (आतनोति) means that which helps in acquiring; hence Sanatan (सनातन) is that which bestows the eternal. B. Meaning: 'सनातनो नित्य नूतन: ।’ means that which remains ever new despite being permanent, eternal and timeless is Sanatan. Only that which always manifests in a new form, will last, e.g. one expects a tree to die when no new shoots spring from it. In the Bhāvārthdīpikā (Dnyānēshwarī 1.71) Sant Dnyānēshwar says - हें नित्य नूतन देखिजे । गीतातत्त्व ।। Meaning: If one contemplates (on the Srīmadbhagwadgitā) then each time one does so, this principle of the Srīmadbhagwadgitā appears new. (In other words, each time one realises a different meaning.) The 's' in the word 'Sanatan' is the bīj of the sun (sūrya) principle which symbolises the absolute fire (Tēj) element. 1.2 The Vedic code of Righteousness (Veda Dharma) The word Vēda (वेद) has been derived from vid (विद्) which means to know. Vēda means knowledge, the concept of knowledge or the means to acquire it. Knowledge in this context refers to the knowledge of the soul, the realisation of God or spiritual experiences. 1.3 The Aryan code of Righteousness (Arya Dharma) This religion is called Arya Dharma because it was professed by the Aryans. 1.4 The Hindu religion A. Origin and meaning I. The Holy text the Merutantra defines the word Hindu (हिंदु) as हीनानि गुणानि दूषयति इति हिंदु । (hinaani gunaani dushyati iti hindu)'. ‘हीनानि गुणानि दूषयति’ means that which destroys (dushyati) the base and inferior (hin) Raja and Tama components (gun). Thus Hinduism is an attitude. It means being a seeker. If one is a seeker enriched with the Sattva component which destroys the Raja and Tama components then one is certainly a Hindu. By this definition, a seeker belonging to any religion, can be considered a Hindu. Hence the Hindu religion, in a real sense, views all religions with equality. II. The Arabs began to call the Aryans residing in the regions alongside the river Sindhu as Hindus. B. Who can be called a Hindu? i. The one who accepts the Vēds, Vedaangs (sciences related to the Vēds), the Purāṇs and their corresponding sects and who is born in a traditional Hindu family is a Hindu. ii. The one who wholeheartedly accepts the above definition as the authority is called a 'Hindu by initiation' (dikshā-hindu). iii. The one to who both of the above are not acceptable but who is born of Hindu parents is a 'Janmaarth,' meaning a Hindu by birth (Janma-hindu). iv. The first is certainly superior but in its absence a Hindu by initiation (dikshaartha) is deemed to be superior from the point of view of worship. However in matters of marriage a Hindu by birth (Janmaarth) should be chosen. C. Special feature I. 'The sole eternal goal of Spirituality in Hinduism is to realise the God principle in man, rather to bring about the manifestation of God in man.\n\nSwastik Symbol in Hinduism Significances of Swastik symbol, which is made before starting anything auspicious, a holy symbol for Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Europe. Some of the most ancient Swastikas where found in ancient India and it adopted across sub-continent over centuries. Swastika (स्वस्तिक) = Su (सु) + Asti (अस्ति) + Ka(क) Su(सु) means Shubh(शुभ) i.e auspicious or welfare Asti(अस्ति) means be/happen or exist. It stand for power or existence Ka(क) stands for doer or performer i.e Karta(कर्ता) ॐ स्वस्ति न इन्द्रो वृद्धश्रवाः। स्वस्ति नः पूषा विश्ववेदाः। स्वस्ति नस्तार्क्ष्यो अरिष्टनेमिः। स्वस्ति नो ब्रिहस्पतिर्दधातु ॥ ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥ (नक्षत्र शास्त्र के अनुसार चार नक्षत्र चित्रा, पुषा, रेवती, बृहस्पति की स्थिति की वजह से स्वास्तिक के आकार का निर्माण हुआ है। प्राकृतिक स्वास्तिक निरूपण के साथ साथ ये श्रुति (स्वस्तिक मंत्र ) मानव के लिए स्वस्ति के अधिष्ठाता इन्द्रादि चारो नाक्षत्रिक देवताओ से प्रार्थना कर रही है कि वे चारो देवता मानव के स्व स्वस्तिक को सुशांत बनाये रखे) Swasti in the above means the one who takes care of our wellbeing and when we add a ‘K’ to Swasti - ‘Swastik’, becomes a symbol that signifies wellbeing, goodness. The symbol of Swastik is considered as a swaroop of Ganesha as it is the first thing that we make before starting anything good and new. Brahman is explained as the combination of static and dynamic forces, which is also called as Shiva and Sakthi, Prakasha & Vimarsha, Purush and Prakriti. Brahman is the formless absolute Consciousness who is the root cause of everything. Hinduism has 18 Vidhya Sthanams: 4 vedas, [Rik Yujur, Sama, Atharvana] 6 Angas, [niruktam, chandas, shiksha, vyakaranam, kalpam, jyotisham] 4 Upa angas [Mimamsa, nyaya, purana& itihasa, dharma shastram] and 4 upa vedas [ Gandarva, Ayur Veda, Dhanur Veda & Arta Shastram]. When Brahman takes form, It do works through 3 Gunas or characters called Satva, Rajo and Tamo Gunas. By the combination of these 3 Gunas with 5 fold matter Prithvi (earth), Agni (fire), Jal (water), Vyau (air) and Akaash (ether/space) contribute the entire creation. Swastika also represents five fold matter with its axis fixed on Akaash (ether/space). The reference to this symbol can be found in Vedas and Upanishads. Swasti means Be Auspicious or Be Welfare, good fortune, represents the Sun or Surya, the source of all life on earth, the direct representer of Brahman, represents Kala or the flow of time, the cyclical motion of time to be exactly representing constructive progress and the cyclic representation of the chaturyugas (Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali) and thereby time, also interpreted as representing the four Seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter), the four directions (North, East, South and West) believed that it attracts all the good and positive vibrations from across the four directions. https://lnkd.in/gyNU6zHa #swastik #स्वस्तिक #prosperity #goodvibes #swastiksymbol"
