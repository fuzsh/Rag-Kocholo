        "text": "After 1000 BC, the Aryans moved into the upper Ganges basin, around present-day Delhi, and settled there. While they established Brahmanism, in which the ritual of Vedas predominate, and defined the social status system of the Varna caste, they also adopted various cultural elements of the native peoples and rapidly became indigenised. This was the restoration of the indigenous culture that had been suppressed unilaterally during the period of invasion, and at the same time the beginning of Indra’s downfall.\n\nThen, around 800 BC, Krishna, who was later deified, appeared in the land of Mathura. Originally he seems to have been a religious leader from the indigenous Yadava tribe who made their living as cattle herders. Krishna means dark-skinned one. So, He was a descendant of Dasuyu, who was once the object of thorough contempt during Indra’s heyday.\n\nThis is where the indigenous people began to strike back. Krishna rejected the then-established ‘traditional’ belief in Indra and preached a new nature god belief to the people. He was, so to speak, a religious reformer who defied the authority imposed on them by the Aryan invaders.\n\nHis teachings were accepted by many people, particularly indigenous peoples, and formed a firm foothold in northern India. It became an anti-Indra movement and at the same time a strong antithesis to Aryan culture, which was rooted in destruction and invasion.\n\nWhile Krishna denied belief in Indra but not in the authority of the Vedas or the castes system. We do not know what the real Krishna was like. But at least as an idolised deity described in the scriptures and stories that have come down to us today, Krishna functioned more as a promoter of the Vedic and caste systems. This would later be a major point of difference between Krishna and Buddha, who was also a religious reformer.\n\nInitially, the indigenous peoples were overrun one-sidedly by the Aryans due to the overwhelming difference in military strength, but by this time, indigenous tribes that had actively absorbed the superior material civilisation of the Aryans and could compete with the Aryan tribes were rising to prominence. The Yadava were probably one of these powerful tribes.\n\nThis may overlap with the process by which Japan, a country of so-called “coloured people”, achieved westernisation through the Meiji Restoration and eventually became a major power, fighting in world wars alongside the Western powers.\n\nAccording to mythology, Lord Indra, enraged by Krishna’s rebellion, tried to destroy the Yadavas by falling heavy rain. In response, Krishna lifted Mount Gowardhan with one hand and used it as an umbrella to protect the people from the rain.\n\nThis Krishna was later adopted as an incarnation of Vishnu, becoming the God Krishna and culminating in the pantheon of gods in India. The national epic Mahabharata played an essential role in this process.\n\nThe story revolves around the great war of the Bharata, a powerful Aryan tribe, on the vertical axis and various mythological episodes on the horizontal axis. Of particular importance in relation to Krishna is the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nWhen Arjuna, a hero of the Pandavas, faced the enemy army in his Ratha chariot just before the outbreak of the great war, he lost his will to fight, sceptical about a war in which his own kinsmen were killing each other. Krishna, acting as a charioteer, sees this and rebukes, encourages and inspires him. In the process, Krishna revealed his divine nature and disclosed to Arjuna the laws of the Universe.\n\nThe composition of the story, in which Krishna, a dark-skinned native, takes a subordinate position as charioteer to Arjuna, a warrior from the powerful Aryan tribe of Bharata, but stands above him as the Supreme God and teaches him, is very interesting because it reflects the complicated relationship between the Aryans and the natives at that time.\n\nThe word dharma played an important role in this scene. Dharma means justice, law and the duty that one must fulfil as humankind.\n\nWhen we Japanese hear the word dharma, we first think of Bodhidharma or Buddha Dharma in a Buddhist context, but the original meaning of the Indian word was ‘that which supports and holds’, from which the various meanings necessary to maintain the world order, as described above, were derived.\n\nHere Krishna brilliantly plays the role of “the protector of Dharma”.\n\nInterestingly, here and there in the Mahabharata and the accompanying Krishna mythology, scenes of Krishna fighting enemies by throwing his Sudarshan chakra appear. The process of how a wheel for running Ratha turned into a throwing weapon is not quite clear, but a ring-shaped throwing weapon called a chakram has existed in India for a long time. The word chakra means disc as well as wheel, which may have caused confusion between the two.\n\nEither way, when this connection between Krishna, Dharma and the throwing weapon Chakra was incorporated into Vishnu’s avatara, it was probably sublimated into the ultimate weapon of destructing evil, the world-protecting Sudarshan Chakra.\n\nThe image of Krishna and Arjuna riding a Ratha chariot became synonymous with them, and this eventually overlapped with the celestial Ratha chariots of Rig Veda, leading to the Ratha Yatra festivals held in the Jagannath temple and others. Conversely, Indra, who once fought spectacularly on the battlefield driving a Ratha chariot, was deprived of his Ratha ownership and became depicted as riding an elephant before long.\n\nThis was a fine example of Indra’s decline of power in the Indian world, where the chakra (or Ratha chariot) is a symbol of divine authority. In later Indian mythology, Indra, on the one hand, is called the king of gods, but in reality, he comes to play the role of a clown who enhances Shiva and Vishnu.\n\nOn the other hand, another important incarnation of Lord Vishnu is Rama. He is the Hero of the epic Ramayana, alongside Mahabharata, whose stories have had a profound influence on the culture of Thailand and other South-East Asian countries. He is said to be a dark-skinned indigenous prince who existed shortly before the Buddha.\n\nTherefore, Vishnu is a deity whose name alone is taken from Aryan Vedic authority, but its qualities were almost entirely of indigenous origin.\n\nThe same can, in fact, be said about another supreme deity, Shiva. I have already mentioned the portrait of a meditating yogi in the Indus civilization. Rudra Shiva is originally a Vedic divine name, but it is said that Pashupati, the king of animals, who meditates surrounded by jungle beasts inscribed on the Indus seal, is the real origin of Shiva.\n\nThere, the belief in the genital organ of the indigenous people, which had been an object of contempt in the Rig Veda, is revived as Linga (phallic), the belief in the earth mother is revived as the belief in goddesses such as consort Parvati, and the snake, once slain as a demon by Indra, is symbolically wrapped around Shiva’s neck, which simultaneously makes a comeback as a Naga deity or as a divine cobra protecting Vishnu and Buddha.\n\nIn this way, it will be seen that although both Shiva, Vishnu and the other Ideas have borrowed only their name titles from the Arya Veda, their true nature is almost entirely derived from the Natives.\n\nIt tends to be commonly said that Aryan Vedic culture is the source of India’s religiosity, but in my opinion, this cannot escape the critique of ‘how one-sided it is‘.\n\nIt was rather the sensibilities and ideas of the indigenous peoples who clashed with the completely alien invaders, the Aryans, and were thoroughly overrun, conquered denied and humiliated, became the root of Indian religiosity. It was out of this complex and profound chemical reaction between the Aryan and the Natives that the noble and deep spirituality of India was born, I think.\n\nThis is evidenced by the fact that almost all the scriptures of current importance in Hindu thought were created under strong indigenous cultural influence during the process of Aryan integration with indigenous peoples.\n\nThe Rig Veda and other early pure Aryan Vedic literature now play little more than a mere incantation in rituals and is of little ideological importance. It is not the strong winner who creates spiritual culture, but inspiration from the souls of the defeated.\n\nThis can clearly be seen in the modern world we live in.\n\nWhat original spiritual culture can be found in the United States, which still desires to dominate the world as the only superpower? Can we find a universal and advanced spirituality that touches the human soul in an American culture that has expanded through the destruction and invasion of native societies, the enslavement of black people and the taking away from others?\n\nIt is said that on the West Coast, symbolized by Los Angeles, religious thought and practice from all over the world can be seen like an exhibition hall, with Zen, Tibetan Buddhism, Vipassana, Yoga and Tai Chi all originating from the non-Western world “discovered” by the West. Tibetan Buddhism, symbolised by the Dalai Lama, who went into exile in India after the Chinese Communist invasion, started out as a true loser and now attracts the conscience of the whole world.\n\nSimilarly, if we look at the great practical thinkers of the 20th century, those who were once despised as coloured, such as Gandhi, the father of Indian independence, Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Martin Luther King Jr. of the US, rise to the top. It should not be forgotten that Vietnam, a country that once suffered thorough destruction at the hands of the US, emerged an outstanding Buddhist, Thich Nhat Hanh, whose ideas have attracted many Westerners.\n\nIn addition, the ideas of the Native Americans, who were once unilaterally slaughtered by the Pilgrim Fathers and subsequent colonists, are being re-evaluated as a guide to a new global consciousness and symbiotic society, along with the growing seriousness of global environmental problems.\n\nThe fact is that many of the ideas that have the centripetal force and capture the hearts and minds of people today in the midst of the Western-centred world order are derived from the traditions of those who were once discovered by Westerners and denied as barbaric and inferior.\n\nIn contrast, the hymns to the gods of the Rig Veda, which remain as pure Aryan thought, show only a very simple-minded and carefree mentality, like that of the American cavalrymen and cowboys who continue to fight the Native Indians (just like Bush during the Afghan-Iraq war!).\n\nThe process by which this barbaric and simple-minded invader mentality was enlightened under the tutelage of profound spirituality nurtured by the invaded Natives was the process by which Vedicism became Brahmanism and was eventually transformed into Hinduism.\n\nThe episode of Bhagavad Gita, in which the god Krishna teaches and guides Arjuna, symbolizes this process vividly.\n\nThe Mahabharata is a story that seems to be full of ethos praising the warrior’s valour throughout, with Krishna urging Arjuna to fight with all his might as the warrior’s dharma, but the story does not finish there, with all the characters, including Krishna, meeting tragic destinies at the end, which in fact strongly impresses the emptiness and foolishness of war.\n\nIn this aspect, too, there is a vivid contrast with the Rig Veda’s Indra, who glorifies invasion and deprivation in a simple-minded way. It was unmistakably the sensibility of the indigenous Indians symbolised by Krishna.\n\nThus, Indra, the Rig Vedic god of war, was completely ousted from his position as the supreme deity and eventually degraded to a mere guardian god of the East. He is still alone, gazing at the eastern sky, nostalgic for his past glory as the revered military god of the eastern expedition.\n\nBrahmanical Hinduism, which abandoned the invading warrior god Indra, eventually matured the idea of ahimsa (non-violence and non-killing), influenced by Buddhism and Jainism. It culminated in Mahatma Gandhi’s independence movement against Britain in a much later period.\n\nHis devotional deities were Krishna and Rama, and he took the Bhagavad Gita as his guide in life, his last words being ‘Hey Rama’.\n\nDoesn’t his way of life, in which he stood up against British rule of invasion, overlap somewhat with that of Krishna, who is said to deny the belief in Indra?\n\nHis way of life and its political lineage eventually led to Mandela and King, who functioned as an important antithesis to the Western or white Christian-centred world order.\n\nIt is the inevitability of history and universal Dharma (law of the universe) that simple-minded ideas or deities that can only invade, destroy and plunder would become useless once an order was established and the world has entered a period of maturity, I suppose.\n\n~to be continued~"
