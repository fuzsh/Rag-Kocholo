        "text": "‘OM! Praise be to the blessed Vasudeva! May you be purified by Hari’s lotus feet that became manifest when they bestrode Bhur, Bhuvah, and Swah! May you be purified by Hari’s lotus feet that have the power to annihilate the sorrow and fear of existence! May you be purified by Hari’s lotus feet that are approached by yogins whose minds discern the truth! May he whose form lies on the naga’s coils within the milky ocean’s depths protect you! May he protect you at whose touch the sea with froth of foam tossed upward by his breath seems to begin to dance.’ – Shrimad Markandeya Mahapurana\n\nViṣṇu is a full form of Bhagavān. He specializes in the maintenance and operation of the universe, rather than creation or destruction, as a general principle, with exceptions.\n\n‘Wearing a yellow robe, he was large-eyed, of vast dominion like a dark cloud, the soul of Yoga whose dwelling is the heart of yogins.’ – Shrimad Kurma Mahapurana\n\nIn Viṣṇu’s Swayam Rupa, his skin is the color of dark blue rainclouds. He has four arms. On his chest is the Shrivatsa whorl-mark, symbolizing his wife Lakshmi. He wears the Kaustubha gem on his chest as well, sometimes even the Syamantaka, and a mala of flowers and gems known as Vaijayanti. With his lower left hand he holds Kaumodaki, his gada. With his lower right hand he holds a padma. With his upper left hand he holds Panchajanya, the conch of the five elements. With his upper right hand he holds the Sudarshana Chakram. He wears a golden kiritamukuta, sometimes adorned with a peacock feather, and two earrings, often in the same ear. He also wears a vanamala. He wears the pitambara garment, made of gold and symbolizing the Vedas. Viṣṇu wears yellow. His sacred cord is wound round his torso. As Lord of Vaikuntha he sometimes appears with four heads and eight arms. He is associated with the Sun.\n\nSometimes he holds a pustaka of the Vedas. Sometimes he holds a chamara.\n\nHe also has the form Vishwarupa, or Vishwavirat Swarupam, which is beyond the normal limits of human perception and imagination.\n\nViṣṇu’s wife is Lakshmi, who also has the form Bhumi.\n\nViṣṇu has a son, Kamadeva. As Mohini, he had a son with Shiva, Ayyappan.\n\nViṣṇu manifests as the Prabhava Vilasa, also known as the Chatur Vyuha, the four ‘expansion forms’ Vasudeva, Shankarsana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha. Shankarsana possesses Gnyana and Balam, Pradyumna possesses aishwarya and virya, Aniruddha possesses virya and tejas, and Vasudeva possesses all these plus Shakti. Each of the Prabhava Vilasa in turn expand into six more forms known as Vaibhava Vilasa, totaling twenty-four Vaibhava Vilasa. Four of them preside over the four directions and twelve of them over the twelve months. The other eight are known as Vaibhava Vilasa Murtis.\n\n‘Lord Narayana, the blessed god who pervades the universe, is four-fold, O brahmin. He exists both with and without characteristics. One form is beyond description; the wise see it as white. Its limbs are obscured by wreaths of flame. It is the ultimate foundation of yogins. Being both far and near, this form is beyond Triguna. Called Vasudeva, he is said to be indifferent to possessions. The color, shape, and other attributes of this first form are not without existence, but they exist in imagination. This form does exist. It is always pure, single in form, and a fine foundation. The second form, called Shesha, lies below, carrying the earth on its head. Said to be full of tamas, it stretches out horizontally. The third form performs action. Its aim is the maintenance of all creatures. It abounds in sattwa and upholds Dharma. The fourth form, lying in the middle of the water, rests on a serpent bed. Its characteristic is rajas and it continually produces creation.\n\n‘In his third form Hari protects creatures and constantly sustains Dharma on earth. He destroys the Asuras who arise to obstruct Dharma, and he protects the Devas and virtuous men whose aim is the defense of Dharma. Whenever Dharma declines and adharma rises to power, O Jaimini, then the lord pours himself forth.\n\n‘Long ago, after dispelling the water with his snout while in the form of a boar, the lord dug up the earth like a lotus. Taking the form of a man-lion, he slew Hiranyakashipu and other Danavas led by Viprachitti. I cannot here enumerate all his avataras, Vamana and the rest, but now he has appeared as a man in Mathura. In this way does the sattwika form of Hari produce avataras. Called Pradyumna, this form is bent upon acts of protection. It adopts a variety of natures – divine, human, and animal – always according to the desire of Vasudeva.’ – Shrimad Markandeya Mahapurana\n\nThe twelve are known as Vyuhantaras. Each Vyuhantara is meditated upon in a specific way, and has a distinct color, form, and set of qualities. All of them have four arms. Each is associated with a specific urdhwa pundra on the body.\n\nVasudeva’s Vyuhantaras include:\n\nKeshava the Golden, wielding four Chakras\n\nNarayana the Blue, bearing four conches\n\nMadhava the Jewel-Colored, wielding four gadas\n\nShankarsana’s Vyuhantaras include:\n\nGovinda the Silver, wielding four bows\n\nViṣṇu the Lotus-Colored, bearing four ploughshares\n\nMadhusudhana the Lotus-Colored, bearing four pestles\n\nPradyumna’s Vyuhantaras include:\n\nTrivikrama the Fiery, wielding four swords\n\nVamana like the Rising Sun, wielding four thunderbolts\n\nSridhara the Lotus-Colored, bearing four shields\n\nAniruddha’s Vyuhantaras include:\n\nHrishikesha the Lightning-Colored, wielding four hammers\n\nDamodara the Silk-Colored, bearing four pashas\n\nPadmanabha the Sun-Colored, wielding five weapons\n\nOne of Shankarsana’s Vilasa forms is known as Mahashankarsana. Mahashankarsana incarnates as a Purusha Avatara known as Mahaviṣṇu.\n\nMahaviṣṇu is one of Viṣṇu’s three Purusha Avataras. He is also known as Karanodakasayi or Mahat Virat. The other two are Garbhodakasayi, also known as Kshudra Virat, and Kshirodakasayi. Each of these three forms has an accompanying form of Lakshmi.\n\nMahaviṣṇu lies on the surface of the Causal Ocean. He generates Mahat-Tattwa and exhales through his pores the Bijaksharas of all the infinite universes into Mahat-Tattwa, which forms a multi-layered womb around each Bijakshara. Each layer of Mahat-Tattwa is ten times thicker than the last. Then Mahaviṣṇu fertilizes the Bijaksharas with his glance and causes them to germinate and grow, assimilating the Mahat-Tattwa. Finally Karanodakasayi incarnates in each universe as Garbhodakasayi.\n\nGarbhodakasayi incarnates in each of the developed universes in their Mahat-Tattwa wombs and perspires. His perspiration fills half of each universe and is known as the Garbha ocean. At this point the universe still doesn’t contain any light. Garbhodakasayi creates Shesha, a Saksat Shaktyavesa Avatara empowered with Swa Sevana Shakti, who floats on the surface of the Garbha ocean and arranges Himself into a bed, on which Garbhodakasayi lies down. Garbhodakasayi then creates from His navel a lotus, which consists of all the universe’s potential active energy. The lotus grows and shines, dissipating the universe’s darkness. Then Brahma appears and creates the universe, and Garbhodakasayi incarnates as Kshirodakasayi.\n\nKshirodakasayi is Viṣṇu’s aspect of the omnipresent Paramatman, with the specific quality of maintenance and operation of the universe, rather than creation or destruction. However, Kshirodakasayi also has a co-manifest form with Aniruddha. This form of Viṣṇu lives on Swetadwipa, an island in the Ocean of Milk in Aniruddha’s part of Vaikuntha Loka.\n\nViṣṇu considered separately from these three forms is known as Vasudeva, hence Vasudeva being known as Turiya, the fourth. This Vasudeva is unrelated to the Chatur Vyuha form by the same name.\n\nViṣṇu’s Loka is Vaikuntha, which consists of twenty-four sub-Lokas, each ruled by one of Viṣṇu’s twenty-four forms that expand from his Chatur Vyuha. The six Vaikuntha Lokas of Vasudeva are known as Devavatipur, and are generally oceanic. The six Vaikuntha Lokas of Shankarsana are known simply as Viṣṇuloka, and are above Satyaloka. The Vaikuntha Lokas of Aniruddha include part of Kshira Sagara, the Ocean of Milk, and the island Swetadwipa. Kshirodakasayi and Aniruddha are manifest there in a combined form, along with Shesha.\n\nViṣṇu’s Vahana is Garuda. He also often reclines in the coils of Shesha.\n\nViṣṇu’s Mantras include Aum Vishnave Namaha, Aum Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, and Aum Namo Narayanaya.\n\nViṣṇu’s weapons include the Sudarshana Chakram, his gada Kaumodaki, his bow Sarangam, and his sword Nandaka.\n\nThe Sudarshana Chakra was forged by Twashtra from the shed fire of Surya.\n\nViṣṇu took birth as a son of Aditi.\n\nViṣṇu’s importance peaks in Dwapara Yuga, during which time he is more important than Brahma, Surya, or Rudra.\n\nViṣṇu has infinite Lila Avataras. Twenty-six of them are also known as Kalpa Avataras because they incarnate in each Kalpa.\n\nViṣṇu’s Kalpa Avataras who incarnate in Satya Yuga include: the four Kumaras (who are eternal and collectively known as Chatursana; they are Vaibhava Avataras), Matsya (who is a Vaibhava Avatara), Narada, Varaha (also known as Sukara; He is a Vaibhava Avatara), Yagnya, Nara (who is a Vaibhava Avatara, and a partial Avatara of Krishna), Narayana (who is a Vaibhava Avatara, and the same soul as Arjuna), Kapila (who is eternal), Dattatreya (a co-Avatara of Viṣṇu, Shiva, and Brahma; He is eternal), Hayasirsa (also known as Hayagriva; He is a Vaibhava Avatara, and He incarnated at the end of a millennium), Hansa (who is temporary), Prishnigarbha (who is a Vaibhava Avatara), Rishabha (who is eternal), Prithu, Narasingha, Kurma, Dhanvantari (who is eternal), and Mohini (who is temporary).\n\nViṣṇu’s Kalpa Avataras who incarnate in Treta Yuga include: Vamana, Parashurama (also known as Brighupati), a man-god who subdued the ocean and did other tasks as well (Agastya?), and Rama.\n\nViṣṇu’s Kalpa Avataras who incarnate in Dwapara Yuga include: Vyasa (who is eternal), Balarama (who is a Vaibhava Avatara), and Krishna.\n\nViṣṇu’s Kalpa Avataras who incarnate in Kali Yuga include: Buddha and Kalki. In a previous Kali Yuga, Viṣṇu incarnated as an Avatara named Buddha who tricked demons who were massacring the inhabitants of other Lokas by flying in invisible aerial vehicles made by Mayasura.\n\nViṣṇu also has many Shaktyavesa Avataras, who are beings empowered with aspects of Viṣṇu’s Shakti. His Shaktyavesa Avataras include some of His own Lila Avataras. A Shaktyavesa Avatara who is also a full Avatara of Viṣṇu is known as a Saksat Avatara, and a Shaktyavesa Avatara who is not a full Avatara of Viṣṇu is known as an Avesa Avatara.\n\nViṣṇu’s Saksat Shaktyavesa Avatars include Ananta, empowered with Bhu Dharana Shakti, Shesha, empowered with Swa Sevana Shakti, and Chaitanya (a co-Avatara with Krishna and Radha), empowered with Bhakti Shakti.\n\nViṣṇu’s Avesa Avataras include the four Kumaras, empowered with Gnyana Shakti; Narada, empowered with Bhakti Shakti; Brahma, empowered with Shristi Shakti; Prithu, empowered with Palana Shakti; and Parashurama, empowered with Dushtha Nashaka Virya.\n\nViṣṇu has a Manvantara Avatara for each Manvantara, all of them also Vaibhava Avataras. Some of them are also Lila Avataras. Viṣṇu’s Manvantara Avataras in our current Kalpa are: Yagnya, Vibhu, Satyasena, Hari, Vaikuntha, and Ajita (all past), Vamana currently, and Sarvabhauma, Rishabha, Vishwaksena, Dharmasetu, Swadhama (also known as Sudhama), Yogeshwara, and Brihadbhanu in the future.\n\nViṣṇu has a Yuga Avatara for each Yuga. Satya Avatara is shukla (white), Treta Avatara is rakta (red), Dwapara Avatara is krishna (black), and Kali Avatara is usually krishna again, but occasionally pita (yellow). In the current Kali Yuga, Viṣṇu’s Kali Avatara was the yellow Chaitanya.\n\nScriptures about Viṣṇu include Rig Veda, Viṣṇu Sahasranama, Shrimad Bhagavata Mahapurana, Gopal Uttartapani Upanishad, Pancharatnam, Puranabharati, Brahmavaivarta Purana, Brahma Sanghita, Satwata Tantra, Naradiya Tantra, Bhavartha-Dipika, Matsya Purana, Kurma Purana, Varaha Purana, Vamana Purana, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Padma Purana, Garuda Purana, Agni Purana, Kalki Purana, Brahmanda Purana, Markandeya Purana.\n\nSanskrit names of Viṣṇu include:\n\nAchyuta – The Unfallen One, He Who Never Fails\n\nAnanta-Shayana\n\nHari – Yellow, golden, taking away of evil\n\nHrishikesha\n\nJagaddhama\n\nJagannatha\n\nJanardana\n\nMadhava – Husband of the Goddess, lord of fortune, he who was born in the Madhu clan, slayer of the demon Madhu. Adi Shankara also interprets it as “Lord of knowledge”.\n\nMadhusudana – Slayer of the demon Madhu.\n\nMukunda – Giver of Mukti, Giver of Moksha.\n\nNarayana – One Who Dwells Within Human Beings, One Within Whom All Humans Dwell, Dweller of the Waters, Lying in the Waters\n\nPurushottama\n\nRanganatha\n\nShrinivasa – He On Whom Shri Abides\n\nUpendra\n\nVaikunthanatha\n\nVasudeva\n\nViṣṇu – All-Pervading One, Doer. ‘The name Vishnu itself is usually understood to mean “pervader”, in the sense of an unseen divine force or spirit that pervades and motivates the entire universe.’ – Cornelia Dimmitt and J.A.B. van Buitenen, Classical Hindu Mythology: A Reader in the Sanskrit Puranas\n\nNames of Viṣṇu in other languages include:\n\nBeikthano (Burmese)\n\n‘We celebrate that very manhood of Viṣṇu the savior who gives not harm but bounty, who with three strides bestrode in width the wide spaces to bestow wide-ranging scope and life itself. The mortal who watches two of the strides of him who gazes on heaven bestirs himself, but no one dares to conquer his third, not even the winged sky-going birds.’ – Rig Veda\n\n‘The eternal Shri, loyal to Viṣṇu, is the mother of the world. Just as Viṣṇu pervades the universe, O excellent Brahmin, so does she. Viṣṇu is meaning; Shri is speech. She is conduct; Hari is behavior. Viṣṇu is knowledge; she is insight. He is Dharma; she is virtuous action.\n\n‘… She is the earth and Hari earth’s upholder. The eternal Lakshmi is contentment, O Maitreya; the blessed lord is satisfaction. Shri is wish, the lord desire. He is the Yagnya, she the fee. The Devi is the offering of butter, Janardana the sacrificial cake. At the Yagnya… Lakshmi is the altar, Hari the Yangya pole. Shri is the firewood, the lord the sacred grass… Lakshmi is the swaha cry; Jagannatha Vasudeva is the oblation-eating fire.\n\n‘Shauri the lord is Shankara, and Lakshmi is Gauri, excellent Brahmin… Shri is the sky; Viṣṇu, the Self of everything, is wide-open space… Lakshmi is fortitude, enacted in the world, Hari the all-pervading wind…\n\n‘Lakshmi bears the form of Indrani, while Madhusudana is Indra, her spouse, among the Devas. The Chakra-bearing Viṣṇu is Yama personified; the lotus-dwelling Lakshmi is his wife…\n\n‘He who bears a mace in his right hand is reliability, O excellent Dwija; Lakshmi is power. Lakshmi is the instant, the lord the wink of an eye… Shri, mother of the world, is a forest creeper while Viṣṇu is a tree. Shri is the starry night; the Deva who carries gada and Chakra is the day. Viṣṇu, granter of wishes, is the bridegroom; the lotus-dwelling Devi is the bride.\n\n‘Appearing in the form of a male river is the lord, while Shri takes the form of a female river. The lotus-eyed Deva is a banner; the lotus-dweller is a flag… Together Lakshmi and Govinda are passion and love.\n\n‘What more is there to tell? In summary, let it be said that among Devas, beasts, and human beings, Hari is all that is known as male, and Shri all that is known as female. There is nothing more beyond these two!’ – Shrimad Viṣṇu Mahapurana\n\n‘Innumerable are the avataras of Hari, who contains the ocean of being, O Dwijas! Those who know the Veda, the Manus and all the others are said to be portions of this same Viṣṇu. From them the various creatures are born; they are to be honored by means of vows and other observances.’ – Shrimad Garuda Mahapurana\n\n‘… on the naga Shesha as his bed lies Hari, the sole lord, lustrous as a lotus petal, origin of all the worlds. Contemplated by the leaders of the yogins … who had drunk the nectar of the bliss of the Self, that long-armed one is himself beyond darkness, the practicer of Mahamaya, eternal, clothed in yellow, whose feet are embraced continuously by the daughter of the milk ocean.’ – Shrimad Kurma Mahapurana\n\n‘Vishnu is one of the most popular deities in Puranic mythology. While Brahma is regarded as the agent of creation, and Shiva that of destruction, Vishnu is worshiped as the preserver of the created world during the periods of time between each successive emergence and dissolution of the universe. Vishnu is called the all-pervader, but he is also said to be the primal person and the first-born of creation, who has neither beginning nor end. In fact, Vishnu appears to be regarded by his devotees as the sole source of the universe, active in all three of its phases: creation, preservation, and dissolution. Epithets similar to those given to Vishnu are elsewhere in the Puranas offered both to Shiva and to the Goddess in some of her forms… It appears that a generalized view of deity as the monistic source of the birth, growth, and death of all universal phenomena dominates Puranic thought and that various deities… are regarded as the sole divine source of the world…’ – Cornelia Dimmitt and J.A.B. van Buitenen, Classical Hindu Mythology: A Reader in the Sanskrit Puranas\n\n‘Most characteristic of Vishnu in all his forms… is his nature as a benevolent, protective deity who pervades the universe in all its multitudinous phenomena, and who takes shape as animal or man to assist the forces of good in the world whenever evil threatens to prevail… his central character as guardian, protector, and preserver remains constant wherever and whenever he appears. And further, it is through the symbolism of Vishnu that the complete identity of god and universe, a theme of continuing importance to Hindu thought, is made abundantly clear. This identity also implies the full identity of god and man, so evident in the avataras of Rama and Krishna, but also experienced personally by Vishnu’s famous devotee Prahlada, who exclaims after a period of intense meditation on the lord:\n\n“Viṣṇu is omnipresent. Because of this he exists even as myself. I am the source of everything! I am all things. Everything exists in me. I am eternal. I am undecaying. I am immortal. I am the Supreme Self! I am the refuge of all souls. I am known as Brahman, and at the end, I am the Supreme Person!” (Viṣṇu Purana)’ – Cornelia Dimmitt and J.A.B. van Buitenen, Classical Hindu Mythology: A Reader in the Sanskrit Puranas\n\n‘In all his forms… Vishnu is the preserver and protector of the universe. His divine personality is one of kindness and beneficence. He is always the destroyer of the enemies of the good, the preserver of the welfare of the world.’ – Cornelia Dimmitt and J.A.B. van Buitenen, Classical Hindu Mythology: A Reader in the Sanskrit Puranas\n\n‘O Lord who fulfills desires! Like a peacock shaking loose its brilliant feathers and holding them high in front of a hen, by your wish you spread out the expanse of souls and matter that are one with your body during the time of pralaya, and playfully display your glory before the eyes of Shri.’ – Shri Rangaraja Stava\n\n‘With an ease like that of a peacock displaying his plumage, Vishnu shakes loose creation from matter so subtle that it seems to be one with his body. The cosmos is a manifestation of Vishnu’s splendor, and he playfully displays it in Shri’s presence. There is, of course, an underlying erotic note in this verse, for the peacock usually dances in full glory to attract the hen.’ – Vasudha Narayanan, Shri: Giver of Fortune, Bestower of Grace\n\n‘Creation… is understood in Shri Vaishnava literature as forming part of the love play between Vishnu and Shri. This divine playfulness finds expression in the creation of the worlds as well as in the passion (shringara) that Shri and Vishnu share.’ – Vasudha Narayan, Shri: Giver of Fortune, Bestower of Grace\n\n‘In the temple rituals at Srirangam… Vishnu and Shri play with flowers, adorning themselves with fresh blossoms, celebrating the vibrancy of spring and the creation of life.’ – Vasudha Narayanan, Shri: Giver of Fortune, Bestower of Grace"
