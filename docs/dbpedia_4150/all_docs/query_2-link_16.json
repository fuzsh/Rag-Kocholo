There is no time for anyone to search over 75 to 108 mantras and chants at various places to listen and learn one by one. This is just one long song contains everything you need to know. You can listen in your car or home or work or in trains or Airports not only your time will move fast, you will also utilize your time usefully and at the end notice changes in you which you will be surprised.\n\nLISTEN TO THIS SONG\n\nListen With Head Phones, Phone ear buds,Surround Sound Speakers for maximum effect\n\nHow you can make the best use of this song to your maximum benefit\n\n1-PLAYING THE MANTRAS AND CHANTS IN THE SONG:\n\nPlay at Home or in Your Car ideally during long journeys\n\nPlaying the song in your home daily will increase the positive energy in your home removing the negative energy. The subconscious listening while you work in your home will have an immense effect on you within you without your knowledge and you will see the change in 5days that you are happy content and full of energy to do more to your life\n\n2-LISTENING THE MANTRAS AND CHANTS IN THE SONG:\n\nListen at Airports,in flights,in trains and watch how your time passes with a purpose\n\nPlease always listen through head phones or phone ear buds or surround sound speakers to feel the effects of the music, mantras and chants.Mantras and Chants selected are very powerful and more you listen the more changes you feel within you.\n\n3-LEARNING THE MANTRAS AND CHANTS IN THE SONG:\n\nThe best way to learn the mantras and chants is to look at the lyrics and observe how Iam pronouncing each word.Notice how Iam singing with no stress in my throat.Notice how Iam breathing while singing.Then sing along with me next time.Finally sing alone the mantras and chants.You will be shocked how you can sing perfectly with right pronunciation in 1-2days for smaller mantras and within 21days for longer mantras chants. You don’t have to be a good singer to sing these mantras and chants.They will make you a good singer such is their power.\n\nI composed and sang the mantras chants and recorded them in HD specifically to make it easy for you to learn and sing fast and enjoy the powers of the mantras and chants\n\nSinging has 5 challenges.\n\n1-Lyrics Pronunciation-Write your notations on lyrics based on how it is pronounced\n\n2 Fear in Voice as if you are chocking-Looking at lyrics and singing removes this fear.Singing over 21 times removes this fear.\n\n3-Breathing while Singing- Less you are stressed more freely you can breathe while singing. Observe the discrete gaps I give between each mantra chant while singing. Sing over 21 times to breathe freely and sing\n\n4-Singing in right key pitch Shruthi as it is called. This improves as you listen more and sing along with me\n\n5 Rhythm or Thallam or the Beats needs to be in sync with the song.Its ok to feel the beat with your hands as you sing.Again it becomes easy if you sing along with me.\n\n4-PRANA HEALING MANTRA THERAPY:\n\nMantras and Chants selected in this song though, you may think some are common or known to you. What you may not know is that healing powers of the mantras comes from the way you pronounce them perfectly and how you sing them. Mantra and chant differ here how you sing them.How the power multiplies by repeating the mantras be it 3 times or 5 times or 21 times or 108 times or 1008 times. This is reason I have selected few mantras and repeated them 108 times but each time differently though you may not notice the difference.\n\n5-PRANA HEALING MUSIC THERAPY:\n\nPrana Healing Music Therapy is developed by me by mixing the most powerful mantras with real sounds of Holy river Ganga,Temple Bells in real temples, and birds and effects like rain.\n\nThe choice of Raaga and Thalam (rhythm) in my composing makes the song unique together with use of melodies Indian and western instruments. My voice flows as I sing thinking of the God. The Voice, the singing, the effects the surround sound recording is what makes you feel like the front row seat to feel the God and that’s when miracles happen to you, your body, mind and soul.\n\n6-NON-STOP LISTENING FOR 5 HOURS\n\nTo people with extreme problems be it physical, emotional or psychological like PTSD and similar kind I recommend the following:\n\nClosing yourself in a room you like the most.\n\nMaking the room very comfortable for you\n\nChoosing the sitting position in the right furniture or just sitting on the floor touching the earth or floor.\n\nEat light food, keep lots of water to drink, preferably vegetarian and no-alcohol please\n\nWear soft and loose garments preferably 100% cotton\n\nStart listening the song but do take a break for 5 minutes every 30 minutes and break for 20 minutes after 2.30 hours for lunch or dinner. Wash your face with cold water during this break. Continue after the break till you complete taking 5 minutes break after 30 minutes. Breaks are not a must and if you like to continue listening do it and take break when you want. At least ensure you finish listening to this song in 2 days maximum first time.\n\nWhen you listen, the song will take you to a different world of your own where your body, mind and soul is at peace with yourself and you experience total inner peace and silence with your mind blank. Its as if you are in a meditative zone. Yes, you will be in meditative zone wondering why you feeling happy. Many experience tears rolling their eyes this is normal and allow them to roll.\n\nHEALING MANTRAS MIRACLE CHANTS TO WALK WITH\n\nSRI KRISHNA TO HAPPINESS AND HEAVEN\n\nThis song is my personal journey. This is no way different from your journey in whichever country you live-in. The journey of my inner struggle in search of the external truth in this world.\n\nThe journey and path to\n\nDiscover Your Self,\n\nAwaken Your Self,\n\nand finally Surrender Your Self\n\nto Your Self or God.\n\nWho Iam I? is the big question. Why Iam I Born? What is the purpose of my Birth?\n\nWhat are my duties and responsibilities to complete in this birth?\n\nI learnt through lessons from my life that we all live in three worlds. First Internal World, the real you, your family. Second the External World, what we do or better known by the job we do our occupation and friends. Third the Universal World, where the Internal and External world connects with the Universal world. We all connect with the universe, earth and nature because they help us survive in this world by providing oxygen, sun light, moon light, food from the earth, and water through rains. It looks simply but this is your world. Born as a Hindu is my Internal world, but I look at the External World as a non-Hindu like you, where Truth Is God and Truth is religion and nothing else matters. We have one God with different names like Sri Rama, Jesus or Allah.\n\nWhether we believe in God or not we all have two most important wishes in our life.?\n\n1 We want Happiness\n\n2 We want to go to heaven\n\nIn the first 50 years we want to know “What we need to do to bring happiness into our life”\n\nIn the next 50years we want to know “What we need to do to go to heaven” we do not admit but these are our two inner fears we don’t express outside. Now how can our wishes be full filled in this birth?\n\nI looked at what happened when our universe was created. When our universe was created we learnt that we first heard a sound. The very first primordial sound we heard when our universe was created was the sound of Om (AUM). This is the same sound which unites our body mind and soul finally with the God. Our Life is nothing but a combination of sounds. Life starts with the sound of baby crying at birth and people around smiling. Life ends with the person passing away laying with a smiling calm face and people around crying. Life Starts with Om and ends with Om. Om is the breath of our life. When you sing Om, you can feel your breath and each person experiences this feeling differently due to their unique DNA. This is what makes you a special person one of its kind in the world. I was able to relate to various sounds because I learnt to play Tabla, from a blind teacher. Tabla is an Indian rhythm instrument played with both hands using both the right and left side of the brain. I learnt to sing compose in multiple languages like Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, and Awadhi since the sounds were unique and had different impact in each language due to their words. I noticed these sounds of mantras and chants had healing powers on our body mind and soul. This is how my relationship started with the sounds. The miracles of the chants are due to their association with the creator the lord\n\nSri Krishna the supreme God who took the human form to make us realize the need for a God in our life. To those who do not believe in God, let’s call it an unknown power or Belief or Hope in life.\n\nI decided to virtually travel the path Om Traveled throughout India through various holy cities, holy rivers, holy mountains and holy temples through this song\n\n“Healing Mantras Miracle Chants To Walk With Sri Krishna to Happiness and Heaven”\n\nOm Mantra for meditation\n\nThe journey starts with first singing or listening to Om the mantra for meditation. This is a soul purifying mantra followed by mantras on all the gods ends with the most important sloka from Bhagavad Gita -Puthra Dhara\n\nMantras are powerful sounds which can make you experience miracles. When you hear them, you may think each mantra sounds same but if you listen closely you will notice each time its sang or rendered differently. This means same mantra repeatedly 108 different ways for maximum impact and experience in your body and mind and this is main reason for amazing problem-solving capabilities of the mantras and miracles.\n\nYou will hear many powerful mantras on various Gods repeated 108 times and even 1008 times and ends with again Om\n\nLife begins with Om Life ends with Om. The universe which was created ends one day to create a new universe again with the sound of Om.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis virtual journey covers\n\n54 Temples\n\n33 Gods\n\n4 Dhams\n\n9 Planets\n\n3 Poets\n\n2 Rishis\n\n5 Elements of nature through the temples for Fire-Water-Air-Space-Earth and Temple of sun and Moon\n\n4 Yugas\n\n4 Lokas\n\n7 Colors\n\n5 Chiranjevis\n\n2 Incarnations in Humans\n\n5 languages\n\n2 Epics born from two Epic battles, Sri Ramayana and Maha Bharatham and from it Bhagavad Gita the manual how to life our life today in this kaliyuga\n\nWho Iam I? I realized that there is God living inside each one of us and we are unique blessed Divine individuals that’s why we say “Namaste” when we see other Persons recognizing God inside them. We start to respect all living beings elevating our self into a spiritual human being\n\nWhy Iam I Born?\n\nThere are estimated 8.7 Million living species on the earth 6.5 million living on the earth and 2.2 million species living in the ocean. You being born as a human among 8.7 million species\n\nIs what makes you special, unique as proved by DNA since only you have it. People who had more bad karma then good karma are born as other living species other than Humans.\n\nYou are born based on the good and bad karma of the previous birth where you did more good than bad and you still have certain duties which you need to do in this birth as defined by the purpose of your birth which you will discover slowly.\n\nWhat is the purpose of this birth?\n\nYou are born to Give life, Save Life and not to take any Life including your life. Your purpose of life is to help others by serving God and strive for the happiness of all human being and living species till you attain Moksham Salvation by surrendering Saranagathi to the God\n\nWhat are my duties and responsibilities in this birth?\n\nThe four goals of human life\n\nDharma: the right way to life, the “duties and obligations of the individual toward himself and the society as well as those of the society toward the individual”;\n\nArtha: the means to support and sustain one’s life;\n\nKāma: pleasure and enjoyment;\n\nMokṣa: liberation, release\n\nHow you balance the four is most important aspect of your life which makes the difference between success and failure.\n\nIs there a manual I can follow how to live a truthful good life and how to solve our problems?\n\nBhagavad Gita is the manual given by Sri Krishna him self knowingly that life during kaliyuga will be very difficult with every one experiencing unimaginable problems.\n\nHappiness\n\nI experienced Happiness after the mantras 1 to 63 the last mantra from Bhagavat Gita teaches about detachment and that this life is nothing but one sweet dream from birth to death which is such a blessing from the God. I noticed the 10 heads of Ravana are no more\n\nManas (Mind) Buddhi (Intellectual) Chita (Will) Ahamkara (Ego) leaving only Happiness to me and us. If I WANT HAPPINESS than its only in my hand to be happy and I must sacrifice I Ego Want which is Desire once I sacrifice these two Iam left with only Happiness.\n\nHeaven\n\nI experienced Heaven from mantra 64 to 75 as I traveled through space with the 108 mantras.\n\nI experienced meeting Sri Hanuman who helped both Sri Rama and Sri Krishna win both their wars. He made me realize Gayatri Mantra essence of om and finally meeting Lord Shiva with the Maha Mrityunjaya mantra and Om Nama Shivaya. I was at the gates of Heaven. Standing there was Chitra gupta the one God who keeps accounts of good and bad done by all of us and he decides who goes to Hell or Heaven. The Chitra gupta mantra helps here and I repeated Hare Krishna Maha Mantra that’s when I experienced heaven and unity with the God. I then realized Loka Samastha Sukhino Bhavanthu meaning not only I should be happy but I want all living beings and all living creatures to be happy and be in heaven. I finally wanted Shanthi Peace Inner peace and outer peace in the universe. Somewhere at a distance I heard Ram Ram Ram voice of Sri Hanuman in Ayodhya. I also heard Hare Krishna-Hare Krishna -Hare Krishna voice of Arjuna in Kurukshetra as I opened my eyes to the sound of om om om om om\n\nHealing Mantras Miracle Chants Is a Strong Belief That Sri Krishna Will Walk with You To\n\nHappiness and Heaven because you are a Spiritual Being going through a Temporary Human Experience in this life\n\nWorldwide launch on 22nd July 2018\n\nSearch for Prana Kishore Bommireddipalli in your country in the following sites:\n\nApple I Tunes,Amazon Mp3,Spotify,Pandora,Google Music Store,You Tube Music,\n\nNapster,Saavn,Shazam,I Heart Radio, and over 30 Digital Music Distributers,\n\nwww.pranakishore.com\n\nPrana Kishore Bommireddipalli\n\nJoin me in this journey to regain Faith in God to achieve everything, if we just have Belief and Hope through prayers, mantras while protecting our Sanatana Dharma which gave us everything\n\nVedam–A Positive Belief System For The Next Generation-\n\nHow To live Your Life-Prana Kishore\n\nVedam is a positive belief system on how to live your life. Many sanskrit words do not have equivalent words in English and they cannot be translated.Intentionally few Telugu words have been written on the side to understand the beauty of the words by those who know Telugu.Telugu words have been written in English as the next generation know Telugu but cannot read.\n\nThis is helpful to Baby Boomers and other generations as well.\n\nWhat is the deference between Vedas and Vedam?\n\nThe Vedas (Sanskrit véda “knowledge“) are a large body of texts originating in ancient India. Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of Hinduism.The Vedas are apauruṣeya (“not of human agency”).They are supposed to have been directly revealed, and thus are called śhruti (“what is heard”),distinguishing them from other religious texts, which are called smṛti (“what is remembered”). In Hindu tradition, the creation of Vedas is credited to Brahma.The Vedic texts or śhruti are organized around four canonical collections of metrical material known as Saṃhitās, of which the first three are related to the performance of yajna (sacrifice) in historical Vedic religion:\n\nThe Rigveda, containing hymns to be recited by the hotar, or presiding priest;\n\nThe Yajurveda, containing formulas to be recited by the adhvaryu or officiating priest;\n\nThe Samaveda, containing formulas to be sung by the udgatar or priest that chants;\n\nThe Atharvaveda, a collection of spells and incantations, apotropaic charms and speculative hymns.[9]\n\nThe individual verses contained in these compilations are known as mantras. Some selected Vedic mantras are still recited at prayers, religious functions and other auspicious occasions in contemporary Hinduism.\n\nAncient powerful Mantras on all Gods 50 of them in sanskrit are composed and sang by Prana Kishore in his album”Om Shri Rama Hanuman Raksha” available at http://www.pranakishore.com and I Tunes,Amazon worldwide.These mantras are mixed with real sounds of Holy river Ganga and other rivers,Temple bells,rare birds to be effctive as Music Therapy to bring the temple inside your living room.It is enough if you know these 50 Mantras to be a true Hindu\n\nVedam\n\nIs God There?\n\nGod Is There\n\nThe belief system is Vedam\n\nDevudu unnada ?\n\nDevudu Unnadu\n\nOka namakam is vedam (telugu words)\n\nAnimals have no common sense (Budhi) nor have Karma.Human beings have both.\n\nDevathalu (Angels)are in swargam(heaven)as long as they have their punyam (Credit for Good deeds).\n\nOnce the punyam (Credit for good deeds) expires they fall to the earth(Bhulokam )\n\nEarth (Bhulokam) has humans with Happiness,sadness,pleasures and difficulties\n\nWhat is it we should do to reach Ishwara,Shiva,God ?\n\nWho has to tell us how we should live and How we should pray ?\n\nIshwara ( God )only can tell us about this.\n\nThis is Vedam\n\nIshwarudu Vakku is vedam\n\nShiva or Gods word is Vedam\n\nHow to live ?

It’s a way to help people.\n\nWhat is the definition of Dharma?\n\nIn short ”right way of living” or “Path of Righteousness”.\n\nDharma signifies behaviors that are considered to be in accord with order that makes life and universe possible,and includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and ”right way of living” or Path of righteousness. The Classical Sanskrit noun dharma is a derivation from the root dhṛ, which has a meaning of “to hold, maintain, keep”.The meaning of word “dharma” depends on the context, and its meaning evolved as ideas of Hinduism developed over its long history.\n\nVedam is shruthi and Shruthi is Shastram (Specialised Knowledge)\n\nAccept vedam as a promise since it is the truth\n\nPractice vedam to reach God\n\nNever argue against vedam\n\nNever argue with people who do not believe in god or vedam,its a waste of time.\n\nPeople belief system develops by the way they are raised from child hood.\n\nPeople belief system changes with age,some believe in God at a later age or many not believe at all in this birth. That’s their fate.\n\nWe cannot change it.\n\nWe should not try to force people who do not believe in God\n\nTo reach God how do you know god is there?\n\nSince you did not see God? or Speak to God\n\nEarth is rotating you.
