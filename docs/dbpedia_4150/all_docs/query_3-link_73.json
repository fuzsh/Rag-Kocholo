        "text": "NakṣatranemiḤ {नक्षत्रनेमि:}\n\n(1) He who is the ‘heart’ of all the stars, planets, sun and the moon. (2) He who is the axle of the brilliant and glowing wheel of light. (3) Dhruva governs the motions of the celestial bodies and resides at the tail of the Śiṃśumāra grouping of stars – Nārāyaṇa is the heart of this wheel of light and controls them all.(Śaṅkara) (1) He who makes the stars move. (2) He is known as ‘pravāha” since he supports all the luminous bodies – all the stars follow him like a wheel as he moves in a circle.(Parāsara Battar)\n\nParāsara Battar’s interpretation flows from: Jyotiś-chakram nayati iti Nakṣatranemiḥ – he who leads the sun, the moon, the stars and all celestial beings as he moves in a circle and they follow in his wake…\n\nEvam bhraman bhrāmayati candrādityakān grahān\n\nbhramantamanu tam yānti nakshatrāṇi ca cakravat |2.9.2|\n\n[2.9.2]: Even as he goes around, he makes all the other stars and planes to move as well in a circle -around him (who is in the center)…\n\nShri Narasimhan Kṛṣṇamācāri in his multi-volume translation of the Viṣṇu Sahasranāma, cites the following verse from the Viṣṇu Purāṇa\n\nŚiṃśumāra kṛtiḥ proktam yad-rūpaṁ jyotiśām divi\n\nNārāyaṇaḥ param dhāmnām tasyādhārah svayam hṛdi |2.9.4|\n\n[2.9.4]: The porpoise-shaped celestial wheel of light is upheld and supported by Nārāyaṇa himself, seated in the heart (of that celestial wheel of light)\n\nThe reference here is to the Dhruva-Nakṣatra who is the visible symbol of Viṣṇu in the sky – with the whole visible arc of the sky moving in an apparent circle around him. Symbolically, this is a reference to that one person who is at the center of the whirl of life, who alone is the steady one, and around whom everything and everyone moves in the whirlpool of saṃsāra. Sri Radhakrishna Shastri in his Tamizh commentary on the Viṣṇu Sahasranāma, adds that Viṣṇu is the heart of the “luminous wheel (of life)”\n\nPolaris, the Dhruva-Nakṣatra known as the North Star, is located almost directly above Earth’s north pole along its rotational axis. This is the imaginary line that extends through the planet and out of the north and south poles. Earth rotates around this line, like a spinning top. It marks the point around which the whole sky appears to turn, while the North Star itself appears to remain ‘fixed’. Polaris is located very close to earth’s pole – therefore it traces out a very small circle over 24 hours. So Polaris always stays in roughly the same place in the sky, and offers a reliable way to find the direction of north.[1]\n\nThe phrase “Finding one’s true North” finds resonance here – to find and stick to one’s true north is to identify our true purpose and go forward in fulfilling this quest – in the context of this nāma, it is a call to find out for ourselves what our true purpose is and to realize that there is more to life than just the material – Nārāyaṇa is at the heart of this quest and purpose and it is in finding him that we find ourselves and our true north.\n\nMAHāmakaḤ {महामखः}\n\n(1) The receiver of that which is offered in the yajña. (2) He is Mahāmakaḥ because that which is offered to him bestows on us the greatest gift that everyone seeks – mokṣa, i.e., liberation from the cycle of saṃsāra.(Śaṅkara) (1) He who is the great yajñasvarūpi. (2) He is Dharmasvarūpi (his head is symbolic of Dharma as seen in the previous nāma) as well as yajñasvarūpi.(Parāsara Battar)\n\nOne way of interpreting yajña is to look at it as an intense and focused sankalpa that is directed at achieving a particular goal – it derives from ‘Yaj” which is to yoke oneself, strive to achieve a goal, attain to something. In the Chāndogyopaniṣad, the following description of yajña is provided:\n\nअथ यद्यज्ञ इत्याचक्षते ब्रह्मचर्यमेव तद्ब्रह्मचर्येण ह्येव यो ज्ञाता तं विन्दतेऽथ यदिष्टमित्याचक्षते ब्रह्मचर्यमेव तद्ब्रह्मचर्येण ह्येवेष्ट्वात्मानमनुविन्दते ॥ ८.५.१ ॥[1]\n\natha yadyajña ityācakṣate brahmacaryameva tadbrahmacaryeṇa hyeva yo jñātā taṃ vindate’tha yadiṣṭamityācakṣate brahmacaryameva tadbrahmacaryeṇa hyeveṣṭvātmānamanuvindate ||8.5.1||\n\n[8.5.1]: That which is known as yajña is brahmacarya. This is because one who knows the Self attains Brahmaloka through brahmacarya. Again, that which is known as iṣṭa is brahmacarya, for the desired Self is attained through brahmacarya. Brahmacarya here is to be understood in the context of self-restraint and effort – in that sense, meditation is brahmacarya, worship is brahmacarya, upavāsa is brahmacarya, vrata is brahmacarya, and so on… All effort towards the realization of the “Self” is brahmacarya and as a corollary, yajña. There is also the choice of an ‘iṣṭa’ who is meditated upon and that too is brahmacarya and yajña to attain to that ‘iṣṭa’ – there is no goal greater than this and in the context of this nāma that ‘iṣṭa’ is the Mahāmakaḥ\n\nThat which is offered to ‘Agni‘ during the yajña is called ‘havis‘ – in the great ‘sacrifice of life‘, we offer ourselves as the ‘havis‘ to be purified by Agni, who is Nārāyaṇa himself. This is why he is the Mahāmakaḥ who is the yajñasvarūpi.\n\nIn the Bhagavad-gītā, Bhagavān says something similar in the following verses:\n\nब्रह्मार्पणं ब्रह्म हविर्ब्रह्माग्नौ ब्रह्मणा हुतम् |\n\nब्रह्मैव तेन गन्तव्यं ब्रह्मकर्मसमाधिना ||4-24||[2]\n\nbrahmārpaṇaṁ brahma havir brahmāgnau brahmaṇā hutam\n\nbrahmaiva tena gantavyaṁ brahma-karma-samādhinā\n\n[BG:4-24]: For those who are completely absorbed in that one consciousness, the ‘havis’ i.e., that which is offered to Agni is Brahman, the ladle with which it is offered is Brahman, the act of offering is Brahman, and the Agni (that accepts that which is offered) is also Brahman. To such a person, all action is brahma-karma-samādhi – there is nothing else but the consciousness that all work and every action is Brahman.\n\nदैवमेवापरे यज्ञं योगिन: पर्युपासते |\n\nब्रह्माग्नावपरे यज्ञं यज्ञेनैवोपजुह्वति ||4-25||[3]\n\ndaivam evāpare yajñaṁ yoginaḥ paryupāsate\n\nbrahmāgnāvapare yajñaṁ yajñenaivopajuhvati\n\n[BG:4-25]: In that ‘fire of Brahman’ the true yogis (brahmāgnāvapare) offer nothing but their own self – for it is in the sacrifice of the Self that the supreme self is realized…All other worship is meant for the Devas and for obtaining things other than that supreme knowledge…(daivam evāpare yajñaṁ)\n\nSri Radhakrishna Shastri in his Tamizh commentary on the Viṣṇu Sahasranāma, says that Viṣṇu is the personification of Dharma – anything that is done for him or done with his approval expands into ‘supreme good’ that works for the greater good of the individual as well as the universe at large. Furthermore, he is the only one who can bestow on us that, which even the Devas desire and struggle to obtain – liberation from the cycle of saṃsāra. Therefore he is known as Mahāmakaḥ.\n\nDHARMAYūpaḤ {धर्मयूप:}\n\n(1) Yūpaḥ (यूप:), is the post, yajña-stambha to which the Bali-Paśu (sacrificial animal) is tied – similarly, Nārāyaṇa is the yajña-stambha to which Dharma, and the entire universe of forms and objects are tied. (2) He who is the support and source of strength for Dharma.(Śaṅkara) (1) He who is united with Dharma. (2) If Dharma is seen as the human body, then he represents the head.(Parāsara Battar)\n\nParāsara Battar looks at the Yūpa in the nāma and interprets it as being derived from ‘Yū‘ meaning ‘union’ – therefore he who unites everything and is the protector and preserver of Dharma, is the Dharmayūpaḥ – “dharma-tattvam śiraḥ avayavatayā yauti\n\niti Dharmayūpaḥ” – “He in whom Dharma is united with the body and forms the head that cognizes, thinks, protects, and proclaims the Dharma.”\n\nParāsara Battar further says, “Dharmo Mūrdhanam āśritah” – Dharma itself resorted to his head – as the head is the most important part of the body, this allegory is being used to show that Viṣṇu forms the head of the body of Dharma and therefore is the leader who shows the way to all, including the Devas.\n\nŚaṅkara’s interpretation is based on how the Yūpaḥ (यूप:), yajña-stambha is central to the performance of the yajña, so also Bhagavān is central to the Dharma – he is not only the originator of Dharma but is also the very personification of it, in addition to being the firm post (stambha) to which it is tied. By yoking ourselves to this stambha, we too can be on the path of Dharma.\n\nSri Radhakrishna Shastri in his Tamizh commentary on the Viṣṇu Sahasranāma points to the Taittirīyāraṇyaka (verse-2.19)[1] which was referred to in the context of nāma #437, Sthaviṣṭhaḥ “Yasmai namaḥ tacchiro dharmo” – Your (Viṣṇu‘s) head (Śrutiśiras) forms the conceptual basis of Dharma – in essence the Sarvadarśana-saṃgraha.\n\nHe is the cause of everything in the world, stands as the firm Dharma-stambha to which is tied not only this world but also Dharma itself and the secret to a life of meaning is to hold on to that stambha which is the source of all – the Dharmayūpaḥ.\n\nABHūḤ (OR) BHūḤ {अभूः /भूः}\n\n(1) He who has no birth, i.e., the unborn, eternal one. (2) He who is of the nature of “firm existence” (3) He who is symbolic of pṛthvī. (4) He is the one goal of all seekers – attaining him, their cycle of Saṃsāra comes to an end.(Śaṅkara) (1) He who is the one supporter of all. (2) He who exists as the one being without any support (even as he supports all). (3) He who (as Dhruva-Nakṣatra) supports the Śiṃśumāra grouping of stars.(Parāsara Battar)\n\nBroadly both ācāryas interpret this nāma similarly – that Nārāyaṇa is the one support of all, the only eternal being in the universe, and the goal of all those who want to break out of the cycle of Saṃsāra. Śaṅkara however makes an additional and brilliantly intuitive interpretation, when he says that this nāma can be seen as Abhūḥ – the unborn one – the only being in the universe who is not born, never dies and is eternal and limitless, therefore, the only way we can get out of the cycle of Saṃsāra is to make him who is the one eternal being of the universe, as our goal.\n\nThere is a verse in the Chāndogyopaniṣad, a conversation between Śvetaketu and his father, the sage Uddālaka Aruni, when the father tells the son about the ephemerality of life and also how everyone, every being goes through cycles of multiple births and deaths and the secret to cessation of that cycle is to realize our own “SELF” connect to the inner being…He also points to how those who have a human birth are privileged because it is only in the human life that there exists the possibility of something more than just the material world and an opportunity to go deeper to explore the very meaning of life:\n\nत इह व्यघ्रो वा सिंहो वा वृको वा वराहो वा कीटो वा पतङ्गो वा दंशो वा मशको वा यद्यद्भवन्ति तदाभवन्ति ॥ ६.९.३ ॥[1]\n\nta iha vyaghro vā siṃho vā vṛko vā varāho vā kīṭo vā pataṅgo vā daṃśo vā maśako vā yadyadbhavanti tadābhavanti ||6.9.3||\n\n[CU-6.9.3]: Whatever they were before in this world – whether a tiger or lion or leopard or boar or bug or insect or flea or mosquito – all of them, they are born again. (They never know that they came from Sat, the one truth) – We are born again and again till we overcome our ignorance (of our true nature) and attain Self-knowledge. Death, for an ignorant person, is not liberation. It is like going into deep sleep. And when you are reborn it is as if you are waking up. You die again and again, and again and again you are reborn. This goes on until you attain Self-knowledge. Once you know the Self, you are free -free from birth and death.\n\nParāsara Battar connects this nāma to the previous one, Śiṃśumāra. He refers to the Dhruva-Nakṣatra which is situated at the tail of the Śiṃśumāra constellation, the Dhruva-Nakṣatra spins and the entire constellation spins in its wake, and as Dhruva is an aṃśa of Viṣṇu, he is the one around whom everything and everyone spins – therefore he is Bhūḥ – the great supporter of all.\n\nSthaviṣṭhaḤ {स्थविष्ठ:}\n\n(1) He who is of huge proportions, because he is in the form of the virāṭarūpa / virāṭapuruṣa. (2) He himself is the universe which is his manifestation, he is the supremely gross form of the universe and hence comes to be known as Sthaviṣṭhaḥ.(Śaṅkara) (1) He is Sthaviṣṭhaḥ because of his prodigious size and form. (2) Hari is seen in the form of the great Śiṃśumāra (शिंशुमार), the collection of stars in the north-eastern sky.(Parāsara Battar)\n\n“Sthoulyāt Sthaviṣṭhaḥ” – Shri Narasimhan Kṛṣṇamācāri in his multi-volume translation of the Viṣṇu Sahasranāma, uses this phrase to describe this nāma, where Sthoulyāt derives from “Sthūla“meaning large, immense, huge, heavy and so on.\n\nParāsara Battar refers to the large porpoise-shaped grouping of stars in the north-eastern sky as the marker of Hari’s presence and oversight of the entire world. His reference point comes from the Viṣṇu Purāṇa[2.9.1]: “Tārāmayam Bhagavataḥ\n\nŚiṃśumāra Kṛtiḥ Prabhuḥ” – Hari is seen in the form of the porpoise, consisting of the constellation of stars, with Dhruva-Nakṣatra situated at the tail of this constellation.\n\nShri Narasimhan Kṛṣṇamācāri, further cites V.V. Rāmānujan’s observation on the above interpretation by Parāsara Battar: “This Śiṃśumāra grouping of stars is slowly revolving (on its own axis) and is a reminder of the Dharma chakra of Viṣṇu and this constellation of stars is also constantly drenched by the Ākāśagaṅgā (आकाशगङ्गा) of Satya Loka – and therefore his presence therein.\n\nSri Radhakrishna Shastri in his Tamizh commentary on the Viṣṇu Sahasranāma points to the Taittirīyāraṇyaka which also refers to the Śiṃśumāra constellation as symbolic of Hari:\n\nSri Radhakrishna Shastri also points to the series of verses in the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam that specifically refer to Viṣṇu as the Sthaviṣṭhaḥ (verses 2.1.24 through 2.1.38), the first and the last in this set of verses are given below:\n\nविशेषस्तस्य देहोऽयं स्थविष्ठश्च स्थवीयसाम् ।\n\nयत्रेदं व्यज्यते विश्वं भूतं भव्यं भवच्च सत् ॥२.१.२४॥[1]\n\nviśeṣas tasya deho ’yaṁ\n\nsthaviṣṭhaś ca sthavīyasām\n\nyatredaṁ vyajyate viśvaṁ\n\nbhūtaṁ bhavyaṁ bhavac ca sat\n\n[SB-2.1.24]: This gigantic manifestation that we see as the phenomenal world of forms and objects, is the body of that supreme being, Nārāyaṇa and it is here that all phenomena – past, present, future, the play of Kāla and results of actions are experienced…\n\nइयानसावीश्वरविग्रहस्य\n\nय: सन्निवेष: कथितो मया ते ।\n\nसन्धार्यतेऽस्मिन् वपुषि स्थविष्ठे\n\nमन: स्वबुद्ध्या न यतोऽस्ति किञ्चित् ॥२.१.३८॥[2]\n\niyān asāv īśvara-vigrahasya\n\nyaḥ sanniveśaḥ kathito mayā te\n\nsandhāryate ’smin vapuṣi sthaviṣṭhe\n\nmanaḥ sva-buddhyā na yato ’sti kiñcit\n\n[SB-2.1.38]: This entire gross manifestation of the world is verily that Viṣṇu – there is nothing else other than him that exists. The means to liberation is to concentrate the mind on this form of Bhagavān – what else is there in this world other than Bhagavān?\n\nश्रीभगवानुवाच\n\nस एष जीवो विवरप्रसूति:\n\nप्राणेन घोषेण गुहां प्रविष्ट: ।\n\nमनोमयं सूक्ष्ममुपेत्य रूपं\n\nमात्रा स्वरो वर्ण इति स्थविष्ठ: ॥११–१७.१७॥[3]\n\nWe find yet another reference in the Bhāgavatam to this Sthaviṣṭhaḥ in the conversation between Uddhava and Kṛṣṇa:\n\nśrī-bhagavān uvāca\n\nsa eṣa jīvo vivara-prasūtiḥ\n\nprāṇena ghoṣeṇa guhāṁ praviṣṭaḥ\n\nmano-mayaṁ sūkṣmam upetya rūpaṁ\n\nmātrā svaro varṇa iti sthaviṣṭhaḥ\n\n[ŚB 11.12.17]: The Supreme being animates every living being – he pervades everything and is also located within the heart-cave and there, intimately associated with the prāṇa and that primal sound that is heard within each being. This supreme being can be perceived in his subtle form within the heart by one’s own mind, since it is he who controls the minds of everyone. This very same supreme being also assumes a gross form as the various intonations and sounds of the Vedas, composed of short and long vowels and consonants of different…\n\nTherefore he comes to be known as Sthaviṣṭhaḥ.\n\nAnirviṇṇaḤ {अनिर्विण्णः}\n\n(1) He who is always self-fulfilled. (2) With all desires fulfilled and sublimated, he has no regrets nor does he have any wants. (3) He who is free of dejection, depression or despondency.(Śaṅkara) (1) He who is never despondent. (2) He does all acts with no expectations and is never dispirited ever, because he has no desires or wants.(Parāsara Battar)\n\nŚaṅkara sees this nāma as a reflection of the perfect state in which Nārāyaṇa remains – the state of ‘anirveda‘ – the griefless state of perfect equanimity and equipoise – in his state of perfect fullness, he has no desire to fulfill as there is nothing that he seeks or desires.\n\nParāsara Battar takes a different angle when he says that Bhagavān continues to do what he does with no expectations from his devotees – many times, his expectations from his devotees are not fulfilled because most people are worldly-minded and caught up in, and infatuated by the pleasures of the world only – Bhagavān however does not get dispirited or despondent -he knows that although they may wander across many lifetimes they finally have to come to him, like the bird with a string tied to its feet that can fly around but is reeled-in by the owner when he wants her back…\n\nParāsara Battar further adds that the universe is eternal and limitless, anādi and ananta and continues to remain so only because of Bhagavān‘s attitude of ‘anirveda‘. If he displayed even a bit of ‘nirveda‘ the world as we know it would cease to exist.\n\nIn the Bhagavad-gītā, Bhagavān points to this in Chapter-3 when he is speaking of Karma Yoga. He does not do anything for personal gain because there is nothing to be gained or lost – the whole universe is his, but that in itself cannot be an excuse to not do anything or disengage from the world:\n\nन मे पार्थास्ति कर्तव्यं त्रिषु लोकेषु किञ्चन |\n\nनानवाप्तमवाप्तव्यं वर्त एव च कर्मणि ||3-22||[1]\n\nna me pārthāsti kartavyaṁ triṣhu lokeṣhu kiñchana\n\nnānavāptam avāptavyaṁ varta eva cha karmaṇi\n\n[BG:3-22]: In all the three worlds, there is nothing for me to fulfill, because there is nothing unachieved or unattained (anavāptam), nor is there anything to be gained (avāptavyaṁ), but I am still engaged in work\n\nAgain, in verses 20 through 22 of Chapter-4, Brahmārpaña Yoga or also know as Jñāna Karm Sanyās Yoga, Bhagavān points to this possibility, of how it is possible to attain to that state of equanimity and equipoise in the here and now:\n\nत्यक्त्वा कर्मफलासङ्गं नित्यतृप्तो निराश्रय: |\n\nकर्मण्यभिप्रवृत्तोऽपि नैव किञ्चित्करोति स: ||4-20||[2]\n\ntyaktvā karma-phalāsaṅgaṁ nitya-tṛipto nirāśhrayaḥ\n\nkarmaṇyabhipravṛitto ’pi naiva kiñchit karoti saḥ\n\n[BG:4-20]: When a person gives up attachment to the consequences of action or work performed, then he reaches a state of equanimity and contentment, independent, free, and dependent on nothing – such a person in reality does nothing although, and even if he is engaged in constant action!\n\nनिराशीर्यतचित्तात्मा त्यक्तसर्वपरिग्रह: |\n\nशारीरं केवलं कर्म कुर्वन्नाप्नोति किल्बिषम् ||4-21||[2]\n\nnirāśhīr yata-chittātmā tyakta-sarva-parigrahaḥ\n\nśhārīraṁ kevalaṁ karma kurvan nāpnoti kilbiṣham\n\n[BG:4-21]: When the craving ceases, then peace descends – such a person who has his mind, body, and all organs (particularly the jñānendriyas and karmednriyas) in perfect control and is devoid of all possessions – nothing possesses him, nor does he possess anything (i.e., attached to nothing or no one), free from the sense of ownership and the idea of agent-ship – such a person accumulates on karmaphala and is free...\n\nयदृच्छालाभसन्तुष्टो द्वन्द्वातीतो विमत्सर: |\n\nसम: सिद्धावसिद्धौ च कृत्वापि न निबध्यते ||4-22||[3]\n\nyadṛichchhā-lābha-santuṣhṭo dvandvātīto vimatsaraḥ\n\nsamaḥ siddhāvasiddhau cha kṛitvāpi na nibadhyate\n\n[BG:4-22]: He who is satisfied and content with what comes to him unasked for, and is free from envy, has transcended the apparent duality of life. Such a person is equipoised and is bound or tied-down by nothing – even by the actions he performs…\n\nThis nāma tells us that Nārāyaṇa is the one person who is in that dimensional state of permanent equipoise and in attaining to him we attain that state as well. Therefore he is Anirviṇṇaḥ.\n\nMAHĀdhanaḤ {महाधनः}\n\n(1) He who has the entire universe as his wealth (Dhana). (2) He whose wealth is immense, the wealthiest person in the universe.(Śaṅkara) (1) He who is endowed with immeasurable and unlimited wealth that he gives to those who deserve it. (2) He who possesses the great wealth of Dharma.(Parāsara Battar)\n\nSri Radhakrishna Shastri takes a straightforward approach to interpreting this nāma – this great wealth is stored in the Mahākośa (nāma # 433) and is needed for the experience of Mahābhogaḥ (nāma # 434).\n\nWhen Śaṅkara and Parāsara Battar talk about Nārāyaṇa as the possessor of the greatest wealth and as the wealthiest person in the universe, they are referring to the greatest wealth that he can bestow on us – the wealth of his benevolence. Furthermore, as Bhagavān says in the Bhagavad-gītā, whatever one sees in this world as beautiful, glorious, powerful, opulent, we must realize that it springs from but a spark of his divine splendor and supreme wealth:\n\nयद्यद्विभूतिमत्सत्त्वं श्रीमदूर्जितमेव वा |\n\nतत्देवावगच्छ त्वं मम तेजोंऽशसम्भवम् ||10-41||[1]\n\nyad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ śhrīmad ūrjitam eva vā\n\ntat tad evāvagachchha tvaṁ mama tejo ’nśha-sambhavam\n\n[BG:10-41]: Whichever being or whatever object is imbued and endowed with the quality of Sattva, with supreme majesty, power, and opulence (yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ), and blessed with the presence of ‘Sri‘ i.e., Lakṣmī the inseparable consort of Viṣṇu who is symbolic of fortune, wealth, and success, and energized by supreme vigor and an abundance of strength (śhrīmad ūrjitam eva vā); each one of them, you must know derives all of these from but a fraction of my divine aṃśa that has entered into them (tad evāvagachchha tvaṁ mama tejo ’nśha-sambhavam)\n\nIn this particular chapter of the Bhagavad-gītā, Bhagavān speaks of 82 different ways in which his divine splendor and opulence manifests itself in the universe, but even these are only a fraction of the true wealth he possesses. There is no limit to his wealth and greatness as he himself declares:\n\nनान्तोऽस्ति मम दिव्यानां विभूतीनां परन्तप |\n\nएष तूद्देशत: प्रोक्तो विभूतेर्विस्तरो मया ||10-40||[2]\n\nnānto ’sti mama divyānāṁ vibhūtīnāṁ parantapa\n\neṣha tūddeśhataḥ prokto vibhūter vistaro mayā\n\n[BG:10-40]: There is no limit, no beginning or end to my divine manifestation. What I have declared to you covers not even a fraction of my infinite glory and supreme pervasiveness.\n\nThis is why he is Mahādhanaḥ.\n\nShri Narasimhan Kṛṣṇamācāri in his multi-volume translation of the Viṣṇu Sahasranāma, cites the Dharma Chakram writer who talks of a specific incident during the Paṭṭābhiṣēkam of Sri Rāma. Sri Rāma is distributing a lot of gifts and material wealth to all those in attendance when Sītādevi asks him why he is not giving anything to Hanumān. Rāma asks Sītādevi to go ask Hanumān himself. When Sītādevi asks Hanumān, he points to his heart indicating that Sri Rāma has given himself to Hanumān and resides always in his heart – there can’t be a greater wealth than that… That is how the Mahādhanaḥ offers himself to those who are dear to him.\n\nParāsara Battar cites the Viṣṇu Purāṇa in the context of this nāma and his interpretation of it:\n\nThis nāma completes the 46th couplet of the Viṣṇu Sahasranāma containing 9 beads for a total of 435 nāma–beads till date in the garland of a 1,000 names…\n\nMAHĀBHOGAḤ {महाभोग:}\n\n(1) He whose very nature is that of eternal Paramānanda (happiness and pure bliss) (2) He from whom the greatest Paramānanda can be sought and obtained. (3) He who gives the great gift of Paramānanda to his devotees.(Śaṅkara) (1) He who has objects of great enjoyment. (2) Great sensual gratifications which have to be acquired through wealth, they too can be obtained from him.(Parāsara Battar)\n\nŚaṅkara’s interpretation is connected to the attainment of that state of Saccidānanda (pure consciousness imbued with the supreme knowledge) which is the natural state of being of that Nārāyaṇa and therefore it is he alone who can bestow it upon us and none else. This nāma flows seamlessly from the earlier nāmas in this string.\n\nSri Radhakrishna Shastri in his Tamizh commentary on the Viṣṇu Sahasranāma (which is based primarily on Śaṅkara Bhāṣya) cites the following verses from the Chāndogyopaniṣad and the Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad in explaining the true meaning of this nāma:\n\nयो वै भूमा तत्सुखं नाल्पे सुखमस्ति भूमैव सुखं भूमा त्वेव विजिज्ञासितव्य इति भूमानं भगवो विजिज्ञास इति ॥ ७.२३.१ ॥[1]\n\nyo vai bhūmā tatsukhaṃ nālpe sukhamasti bhūmaiva sukhaṃ bhūmā tveva vijijñāsitavya iti bhūmānaṃ bhagavo vijijñāsa iti || 7.23.1 ||\n\nThis verse appears in the context of the conversation between Sanatkumāra and Nārada where Sanatkumāra is explaining the true nature of happiness, that which is the “source of true happiness” and points to how trying to locate ‘happiness’ in things that are finite is futile, because they are limited and short lived. True happiness comes from the quest for the infinite, the Bṛhad-Satya – the expansive all-encompassing truth of the universe:\n\nYaḥ vai bhūmā: that which is infinite; tat sukham: that is where true happiness is located; na alpe sukham asti: How can there be long-lasting happiness in that which is ephemeral and short-lived? That is why there is no (permanent) happiness in the finite; bhūmā eva sukham: happiness therefore is only in the infinite; bhūmā tu eva vijijñāsitavyaḥ iti: but this requires work and effort in trying to understand the true nature of the infinite; bhūmānam bhagavaḥ vijijñāse iti: Dear Master, I want to understand the true nature of the infinite (Nārada says that he wants to learn this secret that leads to true knowledge and eternal happiness)\n\nIn the verse from the Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad cited by Sri Radhakrishna Shastri, Yājñavalkya is in conversation with Janaka Mahārāja when their discussion leads to this point and they start to explore the true nature of happiness, what constitutes it and how it can be cognized. The following passage occurs in the context of their “investigation of the three states of being”\n\nसलिल एको द्रष्टाद्वैतो भवति, एष ब्रह्मलोकः सम्राडिति हैनमनुशशास याज्ञवल्क्यः,एषास्य परमा गतिः, एषास्य परमा संपत्, एषोऽस्य परमो लोकः, एषोऽस्य परम आनन्दः; एतस्यैवानन्दस्यान्यानि भूतानि मात्रामुपजीवन्ति ॥ ४ .३.३२॥[2]\n\nsalila eko draṣṭādvaito bhavati, eṣa brahmalokaḥ samrāḍiti hainamanuśaśāsa yājñavalkyaḥ, eṣāsya paramā gatiḥ, eṣāsya paramā saṃpat, eṣo’sya paramo lokaḥ, eṣo’sya parama ānandaḥ; etasyaivānandasyānyāni bhūtāni mātrāmupajīvanti ||4.3.32||\n\nWhen the ignorance that veiled the true understanding of the being disappears, then everything becomes clear and transparent, like pure water (when water is crystal, the bottom of the lake can be seen clearly, this is what Yājñavalkya is using as an allegory). Then, the jīva being fully embraced as it were by his own self-luminous Supreme Self, attains to that state of the infinite, becomes perfectly serene and in harmony with everything and everyone around him, with all his objects of desire attained, and the self alone remaining as the only object of his desire. That state without a second, is the highest attainment, greatest wealth, greatest place to be, the and the highest state of supreme bliss (eṣāsya paramā gatiḥ, eṣāsya paramā saṃpat, eṣo’sya paramo lokaḥ, eṣo’sya parama ānandaḥ) – On a minuscule speck of this Paramānanda, all other beings live (draw succour from)\n\nParāsara Battar’s interpretation derives from the following verse in the Bhagavad-gītā, where Bhagavān says that even those fruits (material benefits) that are obtained through the worship of the other Devas, actually come from him who is the Deva of all Devas:\n\nस तया श्रद्धया युक्तस्तस्याराधनमीहते |\n\nलभते च तत: कामान्मयैव विहितान्हि तान् ||7-22||[3]\n\nsa tayā śhraddhayā yuktas tasyārādhanam īhate\n\nlabhate cha tataḥ kāmān mayaiva vihitān hi tān\n\n[7-22]: Imbued with devotion and śhraddha, those who worship deities and devas for material gains, get those things only through me because I am the inner controller of all and everything is but a manifestation of me…\n\nIn Buddhism (Vajrayana Buddhism) too, this state of Paramānanda finds mention where it is a feeling that is felt across the physical, mental, and spiritual realms[4]:\n\nThe supreme bliss of the body (kāya-paramānanda)\n\nthe supreme bliss of the mind (citta-paramānanda)\n\nthe supreme bliss of speech (vāc-paramānanda)\n\nthe supreme bliss of knowing (jñāna-paramānanda)\n\nMAHĀBHOGAḤ is he who is the bestower of the state of supreme bliss as he himself is forever in that state…\n\nMahākośaḤ (महाकोश:)\n\n(1) He who has the great kośas, veiling/covering him from the world. (2) He who is shielded by the five kośas.(Śaṅkara) (1) He who has/is the possessor of the ‘great treasure’. (2) Bhagavān possesses an inexhaustible treasure that never diminishes and is always full.(Parāsara Battar)\n\nKośa can mean treasure – then Mahākośa is reference to the great or supreme treasure. This Mahākośa is the inexhaustible treasure that is Viṣṇu’s gift to his devotees – even though he keeps giving and devotees keep drawing from it, it never diminishes or depletes. This is how Parāsara Battar sees this nāma and connects it to the two previous nāmas – Arthaḥ – the real wealth that we need to seek and the answer to the riddle of life and Anarthaḥ he who is self-fulfilled and not wanting in anything. As the Mahākośa he is the supreme, inexhaustible treasure because he is both Arthaḥ and Anarthaḥ.\n\nŚaṅkara’s interpretation of this nāma is based on how the real nature of the ātman is covered and enveloped by the Pañcakōṣas namely annamayakōśa, prāṇamayakōśa, manōmayakōśa, vijñānamayakōśa, and ānandamayakōśa with the divine principle, the ātman situated behind these kōṣas, shining within the “Hṛdayaguha” or ‘Hṛdayākāśa‘ (Heart-cave or Heart-space).\n\nThe Taittirīya Upaniṣad discusses the five kōṣas in great detail, where the annamayakōśa is the outermost sheath/veil and ānandamayakōśa the innermost sheath/veil – beyond these kōṣas is the ātman which is the aṃśa of Viṣṇu within each one of us. These kōṣas veil the truth at the level of the individual and Nārāyaṇa has also thrown this veil, this Mahākośa, around the world as well – this is how he envelops everything as well as embeds himself within everything and everyone – that is why he is Viṣṇu – the one who is the initiator of this cycle of creation, enveloping everything in his embrace and he who has also entered into his own creation – the one being, within and without…\n\nShri Narasimhan Kṛṣṇamācāri in his multi-volume translation of the Viṣṇu Sahasranāma, cites the Dharma Chakram writer who says that the path to the ātman lies in the following steps:\n\nBy controlling the Indriyas (the organs of sense), we can cross the annamayakōśa\n\nThrough the control of the prāṇa, and holding onto the thread of our breath, we can cross the prāṇamayakōśa\n\nThrough the control of the manas (mind), we can cross the manōmayakōśa\n\nBy developing the power of viveka (discernment), and choosing the right path we can cross the vijñānamayakōśa\n\nThrough meditation and contemplation on our true nature on our ‘Self’ we cross the ānandamayakōśa\n\nIt is by passing through these kōṣas that we arrive at the doors of Vaikuṇṭha, the abode of Viṣṇu\n\nHe who is shielded by the five kośas is the Mahākośaḥ.\n\nanarthaḤ {अनर्थ:}\n\n(1) He who is self-fulfilled and not wanting in anything. (2) He who has no other Artha or end to seek and therefore is ever-full and in the state of Anarthaḥ. (3) He who has no lingering Vāsanās (subliminal and/or subconscious inclinations, habits, desires) and therefore has no further desires and is full and complete in all respects.(Śaṅkara) (1) He is not the goal and is not sought after by those who are hankering after only material wealth and comforts. (2) Some seek him only for the limited purpose of acquiring of material wealth.(Parāsara Battar)\n\nIn the previous nāma, Arthaḥ, Nārāyaṇa was described as he who is worshipped and invoked by all. Nārāyaṇa whose nature is that of Saccidānanda (pure consciousness imbued with the supreme knowledge) and who is sought after as the ultimate goal by everyone – Therefore he is Arthaḥ – the real wealth that we need to seek and the answer to the riddle of life – Śaṅkara’s interpretation of this present nāma, Anarthaḥ flows from this. He who is the very epitome of supreme wealth, the greatest treasure house in the entire universe, has to necessarily be self-fulfilled and not wanting in anything. Neither is there any lingering desire whatsoever and therefore he is Anarthaḥ.\n\nParāsara Battar on the other hand, while interpreting the previous nāma on similar lines as Śaṅkara, takes a slightly different stand with respect to this nāma. For him Anarthaḥ is a reference to those people (including devotees of Nārāyaṇa) for whom ‘HE’ is not the final goal. He describes three types of devotees to substantiate this interpretation:\n\nDevotees who approach him and seek him (if at all) only for the attainment of material wealth and comforts – a very transactional relationship\n\nThose who worship him in order to regain lost wealth and material comforts – again transactional\n\nThose who seek ‘Kaivalyam” that is the realization of their own Self and not ‘Kaiṅkaryam‘ which is servitude and service of Nārāyaṇa – this comes from the differences in the philosophical streams of Advaita and Viśiṣṭādvaita and for Parāsara Battar, even self-realization is only a subset of the greater goal which is the Śaraṇ of Nārāyaṇa and nothing else – it is in serving him that the greatest (or the greater) state of being can be achieved.\n\nŚaṅkara’s interpretation can be understood in the light of the following verse from the Bhagavad-gītā, where Bhagavān prepares Arjuna for receiving the supreme knowledge that clears all doubts and lingering Vāsanās and shines a light on that truth, knowing which, there is nothing else to be known:\n\nज्ञानं तेऽहं स-विज्ञानम् इदं वक्ष्याम्य् अशेषतः ।\n\nयज् ज्ञात्वा नेह भूयोऽन्यज् ज्ञातव्यम् अवशिष्यते ॥७.२॥[1]\n\njñānaṃ te’haṃ sa-vijñānam idaṃ vakṣyāmy aśeṣataḥ |\n\nyaj jñātvā neha bhūyo’nyaj jñātavyam avaśiṣyate ||7.2||\n\njñānam–knowledge; te–to you; aham–I; sa-vijñānam–together with realization of that knowledge; idam–this; vakṣyāmi–shall explain; aśeṣataḥ–in full; yat–which; jñātvā–having understood; na–nothing; iha–in this material world; bhūyaḥ–further; anyat–else; jñātavyam–to be known; avaśiṣyate–will remain[1]\n\n[BG-7.2]: Let me explain to you in detail, this knowledge that when combined with realization and Viveka (discernment) leads to the experience of a state (of being) that is beyond the limited dimensional space of the material world – the state of “Absolute Existence”. When you stand in the presence of and are immersed in that Existence of absolute Truth, it is then that you will become self-fulfilled and complete (with all desires dropping away)…\n\nIt must also be clarified, that anartha is not the shunning of wealth (material or otherwise) but the approach one takes towards it. The following passage from Sri Aurobindo provides this clarity:\n\nTHE place and importance of money in the creative economy of life cannot be overestimated. Without it nothing can be achieved in the material field. Whether it is the formation and growth of a society, or the promotion of its culture and civilisation and commerce and industry, or the stimulation and progress of scientific research and discovery, in the great undertakings, in the works of destruction as much as in those of creation and construction, the one indispensable means (but only a means) is money. Even the ascetic, who studiously avoids all contact with money, has perforce to depend upon the money of others for the sustenance of his body and the dissemination of his teachings, if he has any. If we turn to history, we shall see that all great nations, in the heyday of their culture, were sufficiently rich to expand and organise the creations of their individual genius, and any period of decline in the life of a nation has been invariably associated with either a growing poverty or a reckless waste of wealth. Let us take the example of India. When she was great in the realms of the Spirit, when the higher Light moulded and guided the manifold expression of her expanding life, she was great also in material opulence her plenty was the envy of the world. Poverty, famine and pestilence were regarded as exceptional visitations, and reflected upon the integrity and purity of the ruling head. But when the decline set in, corruption too set in, a multiform corruption, which drained the fabulous wealth by a steady process, and paved the way for the predatory incursions and ruthless exploitation of foreigners. And yet the opulence India possessed even in the sunset glow of her ancient greatness struck the foreigners dumb with amazement, and fired the cupidity of unscrupulous adventurers.[2]\n\nIt may be argued that money is the source of much evil, but so are all forces in the world. One never thinks of eschewing fire because it burns, or water because it drowns. It is the use to which a force is put that determines its character. A world- shunning spirituality instinctively shrinks from the forces of life and has not the courage to look them in the face. Its achievement is in a cowering retreat and not in conquest. But a complete retreat is not possible, so long as the body is there, therefore the ascetic is compelled to resort to a compromise, a clumsy enough compromise, with the forces he detests and dreads, and yet cannot altogether avoid. A dynamic spirituality, which aims at a divine conquest of the world and all its forces and movements, cannot permit itself the relief and comfort of a retreat, but has to grapple with the very elements which oppose its progress but which, once conquered and converted, would substantially contribute to its creative fullness. If the whole of human life has to be organised anew on the basis of divine Consciousness, fall its energies are to be marshalled and mobilised for the revelation of the splendours of the Divine on earth, the money-power has to be utilised with a disinterested control and a perfect knowledge of its potentialities. If spirituality fights shy of the money-power, its material self-expression is bound to be what it has almost always been, poor and halting, or squalid. Much of the aversion of the modern mind to spirituality is due to the latter’s uncouth expression in life, its lack of control over material things, and an uncertain, hesitant and slovenly attitude towards them. This weakness for, it is nothing short of that has to be cured and replaced by a masterful dealing with the money-power for the organisation of a rich and powerfully creative material life in the world.[2]"
