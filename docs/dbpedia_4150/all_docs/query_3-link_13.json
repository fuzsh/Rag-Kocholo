Writing in his journal, Young India, Mahatma Gandhi first spoke about the need for an Indian flag in 1921. He proposed a flag with the charkha or spinning wheel at the centre.\n\n2. The idea of the spinning wheel was put forth by Lala Hansraj, and Gandhi commissioned Pingali Venkayya to design a flag on a red and green banner. The flag underwent some changes and became the official flag of the Congress at the 1931 meeting.\n\n3. A month before Independence, the committee formed to select a flag for independent India recommended that the flag of the Indian National Congress be adopted as the national flag of India with suitable modifications. And so, the spinning wheel of the Congress flag was replaced by the chakra.\n\n4. The chakra, which features in the middle of the tricolour, has twenty-four spokes. It was adopted on July 22, 1947.\n\n5. The wheel is called the Ashoka Chakra because it appears on a number of edicts of Ashoka, the most prominent among which is the Lion Capital of Ashoka.\n\n6. Each spoke on the chakra symbolises one principle of life and also the twenty-four hours in the day, which is why it is also called the ‘Wheel of Time’.\n\n7. Some of the twenty four principles that the spokes represent are — love, courage, patience, selfsacrifice, truthfulness, righteousness, spiritual knowledge, and faith, among others.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nAfter a long stretch of slump, what’ll set the course for the hero of 100 cc bikes\n\nThe many gaps in conflict of interest allegations against Sebi chief, other Indian regulators\n\nFour ingredients that helped Mahindra Thar leave Maruti Jimny and Jeep Wrangler behind\n\n10 financial stocks that are trending in anticipation of rate cuts\n\nIndian investors are diverging from those in advanced markets.
