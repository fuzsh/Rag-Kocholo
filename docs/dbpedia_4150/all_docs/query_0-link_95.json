        "text": "If you’ve ever wished you could bake a cake filled with rainbows and smiles and we’d all eat it and be happy… we wouldn’t tell you to go home, you do go here!\n\nWe treasure that intrinsic fundamental buddha nature.\n\nYour genuine heart is the vessel for a message we want to amplify.\n\nOur speciality is digital design for your compassionate business, but we also recognise that the most compassionate people are also those most prone to burnout.\n\nWe want to repay your kindness.\n\nI’m all about reclaiming idealism. I want to make the dharma accessible to all and spread a message of equanimity and kindness.\n\nThere’s so much suffering in the world, all the damn time, but especially so at the moment.\n\nThe straights are dire and the sultans are swinging.\n\nI want to offset that samsara by highlighting the good that people are actually doing.\n\nAnd to repay that kindness with Shakyamuni Buddha’s teachings that date back 2600 years, tried and true, to help the passionately compassionate not burn out on the way.\n\nIn Buddhism, Tara is the female Buddha of Compassion and Action. She’s the Liberator of All Beings.\n\nThe Swift One. She doesn’t need an Eras Tour outfit change, there’s already 21 of her.\n\nYou’ve met the 22nd – that’s Tara Sleeman, our pun-loving Buddhist founder.\n\nTara is the Liberator or Saviouress, and Save-Your-Ess indeed, we’re here to get your voice heard.\n\nHey, speaking of being heard…\n\nNoun and verb. You are both.\n\nA radical is a change-maker and shaker-upper, a disruptor who sees things aren’t where they should be, but knows the possibility and potential for what could be!\n\nIn this instance, Peter Parker, we hope you use that power for good. A radical has great responsibility.\n\nThink radically and be emboldened to help others. You can certainly do it. Have a voice and speak up.\n\nWhatever discomfort you experience in sticking your head up is nothing compared with that of the suffering of the sentient beings that you are advocating for.\n\nWhich leads us to…\n\nIf you’re reading this, this is the very term which likely brought you to this page. It resonates the most easily.\n\nYou have a kind heart and loving mind, and have probably declared at some stage “How don’t people get it!?” “Why don’t they just get along!?”\n\nCompassion is the wish for all beings to be free from suffering.\n\nRegardless of realm – both humans and animals – all beings wish for happiness and freedom from suffering.\n\nThat’s your drive.\n\nAh! The hidden word within compassion: Passion.\n\nNot lust, attachment, sensuality. This is the very fire which fuels you!\n\nIt’s the combination of all four factors – The Liberator, The Radical, and The Passionately Compassionate that shape you.\n\nYou know what can be done, you see the possibility. You’re a visionary.\n\nAnd with joyous effort we can get there!"
