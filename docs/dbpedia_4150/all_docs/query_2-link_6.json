        "text": "Vedam–A Positive Belief System For The Next Generation-\n\nHow To live Your Life-Prana Kishore\n\nVedam is a positive belief system on how to live your life. Many sanskrit words do not have equivalent words in English and they cannot be translated.Intentionally few Telugu words have been written on the side to understand the beauty of the words by those who know Telugu.Telugu words have been written in English as the next generation know Telugu but cannot read.\n\nThis is helpful to Baby Boomers and other generations as well.\n\nWhat is the deference between Vedas and Vedam?\n\nThe Vedas (Sanskrit véda “knowledge“) are a large body of texts originating in ancient India. Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of Hinduism.The Vedas are apauruṣeya (“not of human agency”).They are supposed to have been directly revealed, and thus are called śhruti (“what is heard”),distinguishing them from other religious texts, which are called smṛti (“what is remembered”). In Hindu tradition, the creation of Vedas is credited to Brahma.The Vedic texts or śhruti are organized around four canonical collections of metrical material known as Saṃhitās, of which the first three are related to the performance of yajna (sacrifice) in historical Vedic religion:\n\nThe Rigveda, containing hymns to be recited by the hotar, or presiding priest;\n\nThe Yajurveda, containing formulas to be recited by the adhvaryu or officiating priest;\n\nThe Samaveda, containing formulas to be sung by the udgatar or priest that chants;\n\nThe Atharvaveda, a collection of spells and incantations, apotropaic charms and speculative hymns.[9]\n\nThe individual verses contained in these compilations are known as mantras. Some selected Vedic mantras are still recited at prayers, religious functions and other auspicious occasions in contemporary Hinduism.\n\nAncient powerful Mantras on all Gods 50 of them in sanskrit are composed and sang by Prana Kishore in his album”Om Shri Rama Hanuman Raksha” available at http://www.pranakishore.com and I Tunes,Amazon worldwide.These mantras are mixed with real sounds of Holy river Ganga and other rivers,Temple bells,rare birds to be effctive as Music Therapy to bring the temple inside your living room.It is enough if you know these 50 Mantras to be a true Hindu\n\nVedam\n\nIs God There?\n\nGod Is There\n\nThe belief system is Vedam\n\nDevudu unnada ?\n\nDevudu Unnadu\n\nOka namakam is vedam (telugu words)\n\nAnimals have no common sense (Budhi) nor have Karma.Human beings have both.\n\nDevathalu (Angels)are in swargam(heaven)as long as they have their punyam (Credit for Good deeds).\n\nOnce the punyam (Credit for good deeds) expires they fall to the earth(Bhulokam )\n\nEarth (Bhulokam) has humans with Happiness,sadness,pleasures and difficulties\n\nWhat is it we should do to reach Ishwara,Shiva,God ?\n\nWho has to tell us how we should live and How we should pray ?\n\nIshwara ( God )only can tell us about this.\n\nThis is Vedam\n\nIshwarudu Vakku is vedam\n\nShiva or Gods word is Vedam\n\nHow to live ? What to do is vedam Given by Ishwara,Shiva or God\n\nHow to reach god is vedam\n\nShruthi is not in written form. It is in spoken form\n\nHow to reach god is vedam spoken as shruthi\n\nShruthi is spoken from Teachers (guru) to Students, it is not written in books\n\nVedam is very very old, ancient, would it work now in our modern world ?\n\nVedam works even in today’s time because,\n\nThe way we breath many many years back and now is the same.\n\nThat’s vedam.That is the truth\n\nVedam says no need to change,since it is the truth\n\nIshwara said no need to change vedams\n\nSmrithi is in written form.\n\nSmrithi can be also be in spoken form too\n\nHow to reach God?\n\nTemple (Devalayam) is a way to reach God\n\nAt Temples in the evening,spiritual discourses( pravachanams ) are conducted.\n\nDisourse (Pravachanam) is showing how everything happened in vedam\n\nIts like showing to you in a magnifying glass\n\nAt Temples evening discourses are Ramayanam\n\nIts for people to listen and learn about Dharma (Right way of living) for people to practice in day to day life. It’s a way to help people.\n\nWhat is the definition of Dharma?\n\nIn short ”right way of living” or “Path of Righteousness”.\n\nDharma signifies behaviors that are considered to be in accord with order that makes life and universe possible,and includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and ”right way of living” or Path of righteousness. The Classical Sanskrit noun dharma is a derivation from the root dhṛ, which has a meaning of “to hold, maintain, keep”.The meaning of word “dharma” depends on the context, and its meaning evolved as ideas of Hinduism developed over its long history.\n\nVedam is shruthi and Shruthi is Shastram (Specialised Knowledge)\n\nAccept vedam as a promise since it is the truth\n\nPractice vedam to reach God\n\nNever argue against vedam\n\nNever argue with people who do not believe in god or vedam,its a waste of time.\n\nPeople belief system develops by the way they are raised from child hood.\n\nPeople belief system changes with age,some believe in God at a later age or many not believe at all in this birth. That’s their fate.\n\nWe cannot change it.\n\nWe should not try to force people who do not believe in God\n\nTo reach God how do you know god is there?\n\nSince you did not see God? or Speak to God\n\nEarth is rotating you. You have accepted earth\n\nDid you see Earth rotating? Did you not accept it as earth without questioning?\n\nWhen you see something beautiful You want to know who is the owner?\n\nwho created it?\n\nGod created (shusti) nature.\n\nDo you Know who created nature ? Sun? moon ? mountains?\n\nrivers ? seas? birds? flowers?\n\nGod created them\n\nHumans everyone are alike 2 hands,2 legs,1 Head, 2 eyes.2 Ears,1 Mouth etc\n\nThey have hunger and they need to sleep.\n\nWho is making you breath when you Sleep?\n\nYou don’t see person who is doing all this? If you accept all this Why is it you are not accepting God Because you don’t see him\n\nNarasimha avataram came to prove to to child Prahaladhu where God is.\n\nGod is there everywhere.\n\nNarasimha, is 4th Avatar of Vishnu came to prove God is every where\n\nNarasimha is often visualised as half-man/half-lion, having a human-like body,with a lion-like face and claws.This image is widely worshipped in deity form by a significant number of Vaishnava groups. He is known primarily as the ‘Great Protector’ who specifically defends and protects his devotees in times of need.\n\nHiranya asked Prahaladha if he shows any where will vishnu come?\n\nPrahaladhu believed vishnu is there and every where\n\nPrahaladhu came to know from Narada through shruthi\n\nVishnu wanted to make the belief of Prahaladhu come true\n\nHiranya asks Prahaladha if Vishnu is there in this pillar.\n\nPrahaladha said Yes Vishnu is there in this pillar.\n\nVishnu comes as Narasimha from pillar and kills Hiranya kasikudu\n\nVishnu wanted to make the belief of Prahaladhu come true\n\nIs God There?\n\nGod Is There\n\nThe belief system is Vedam\n\nIn our body we have 5 elements of earth.\n\nGod created this body and placed the mouth,eyes,ears,stomach in the right place.\n\nFire (Agni) goes up water goes down\n\nWhen u drink water through mouth,Water goes down to stomach due to gravity\n\nAgni vapour goes up from stomach.\n\nImagine if God placed Mouth where stomach is and place stomach where our mouth is.When we drink water can the water go up?\n\nwhen we cook rice in a vessel\n\nImagine if reverse happens,\n\nWater going up\n\nAgni vapour going down\n\nCan we cook rice? In vessel?\n\nParameswarudu (God) (unadu) exists is a belief\n\nA belief System we must believe without questioning its existence\n\nTo reach ishwarudu (God)\n\nwe seek the help of ishwara (God) through vedam\n\nWhat ever work you do,one does for sukham (Happiness ) only\n\nAny women who leaves her husband,to go somewhere for sukham (happiness)cannot be considered a women\n\nWhen the kid is about to go on travel\n\nMother gives food packed by her\n\nFather gives money for travel\n\nThis is Dharma\n\nPerson who follows dharma,Achieves all happiness\n\nPerson who does not follow dharma,Suffers in his next birth, in what ever Birth he may take as human or animal\n\nRama Rajyam name came because when Shri Rama ruled he followed dharma.\n\nThere were No thief’s.\n\nThere were 3 times rain in a month.\n\nFarmers were Happy and people had plenty of food.\n\nDevathalu anugrahincheru Angels blessed people happily\n\nDharma chakram (wheel of Justice )must be rotating\n\nEverything comes from earth (fruits,plants,rice,grains,food,water,oil,list goes on and on)\n\nEarth is called vasundhara\n\nAs fruits flowers metals cars gas\n\nEverything comes from earth Vasundhara\n\nDid mother earth complain of this Weight that she is unable to carry?\n\nWhen we follow vedam,dharma chakram will be rotating\n\nHow to Seek the Blessings of Devathallu (Angels)\n\nWe need to keep Devathalu(Angels) Happy with Agni Hothram and Vedams\n\nAll this is done only through vedam and only in Hinduism or sanathana dharma\n\n1-Start fire Agni Hothram,\n\n2-Repeat vedams\n\nThe smoke from fire reaches the angels in the sky\n\n3-Devathallu (Angels) will come and Bless you\n\nHuman being cannot see devathalu (angels)\n\nlike they cannot see bright sun light for long\n\nWhen you don’t know alphabets\n\nHow can you understand advanced Science subjects\n\nSimilarly unless you learn and understand vedam\n\nYou cannot understand about Devathalu (Angels)\n\nHow to make it Rain ? When you need it\n\nWhen you want rain read Ramayanam at home\n\nVedams read during Agni Hothram,Are reason for good things to happen\n\nIts a regular pratice in india to perform Agni Hothram by a large group of priests for rain in the city or village.\n\nWhy only brahmins read vedams?\n\nIt is very difficult to live as true Brahman or priest doing sandya vandanam,leading simple life.Brahmins learn and read sanskrit from child hood startingfrom mantras,slokas to vedas and vedams. Brahmins are generally very educated.\n\nShudrulu or Non Brahmins can also read vedams\n\nVedams are not restricted to Brahmins alone.\n\nPeople who are selected to be on stage it’s Dharmam (Rule/tradition) to speak People who come as audience to listen must Just listen that’s Dharmam.\n\nThis is Sabha Dharmam( rules or traditions of a function)\n\nVedam only will say what’s Brahman Role is in life\n\nVedam only says whats sanyasins role is in life.(Brahmachari-one who gives up a married life)\n\nVedam only says what Each one of us role is in life\n\nGruhas ashramam is all about Married life\n\ndoing good to every one is most difficult\n\nSanyas Ashramam is all about you Discovering your self\n\nVedam gives happiness.\n\nVedam is tool and way to reach Ishwara\n\nRespect pujari’s,priests and veda pandits\n\nPl namaskar all veda pandits,Pujaris,priests where ever you see them\n\ntouch their feet and seek their blessings.They are the persons who convey your wishes to God through mantras,archanas,puja in the temple.\n\nwe do not know which God is residing in which priest as god is there in every person and God is everywhere.\n\nIs God There?\n\nGod Is There\n\nThe belief system is Vedam which teaches you how to live a great life\n\nAll this helps you develop a great winning Positive attitude to succeed.\n\nThere is no need to search for answers to questions.Our religion\n\nHinduism and Vedam has all the answers from Ishwara,God\n\nwe just have to slow down and look inside than outside for everything.\n\nJoin me in this quest to help others and our next Generation.\n\nSubham\n\nPrana Kishore"
