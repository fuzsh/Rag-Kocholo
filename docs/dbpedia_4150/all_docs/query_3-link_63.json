        "text": "The structure of Sri Chakra -Part Two\n\nThe nine avaranas , enclosures that compose Sri Chakra are briefly as under. These are described in the order of absorption (Samhara-krama) according to Dakshinamurthy tradition. It starts with the outermost enclosure-Bhupura- and leads to Bindu , the central point.\n\n!. Bhupura also called Trilokya _mohana_chakra (Deluder of the Realms) , is the four-sided enclosing wall. The three lokas being three levels of experience, attainments, obstructions and powers.They are also related to the body_mind complex of the devotee.\n\nA tantra design is always enclosed within an outer wall serving as a protective cover. As the devotee enters into the Mandala he leaves behind the nomal woldly distractions and conflicts ; and emigrates into a world of symbols and vizualizations. A Mandala is thus a mansion of gods and goddesses , a symbol of a higher form of existence.\n\nThere are actually six gateways to the fortSri Yantra, if we take a three-dimensional view of it; the four obvious dwaras and those 'above' and 'below'.The Eastern gate is the way of the mantras. The Southern gate is the way of devotion or bhakti. The Western gate is for the performance of rites and rituals, or karma-kanda. The Northern gate is the way of wisdom, or Jnana. The gate 'below' is the 'path of words' while the gate 'above' is the way or 'road of liberation'. These are located at the Southern and Northern gate, respectively, i.e. 'above' is north, 'below' is south. Each of these gates also stands for one of the six primary chakras in the body.\n\nThe Bhupura Chakra , the earth stretch , includes within its spacial scope the entire design even as the earth supports the entire existence.Bhupura is a Shiva aspect and is made up of three lines or ramparts.The first(outermost) line is identified with the attainments of yoga powers called Siddhis.They are needed for self-protection along the inward journey. Such Siddhis are eight in number; and are attained consequent on gaining control over the elements and the mind. The second or the middle line represents the powres of eight mother_like divinities Mathrika who rule over emotions such as passionate longing(Brahmi ), violent anger(Maheshwari), avrice(kaumari) obstenecy(Varahi) etc. The third (inner) line of the square is identified with ten feminine deties , Mudra devathas, carrying seals of authority. The mudras are an approach to the divinities.These could be gross(sthula) being body postures and gestures by hand; subtle(sukshma) by way of seed-mantras; and para transcendental that is mental or intutional approach.\n\nThese three lines are also taken to represent the Mother goddess; the outermost line corresponds to her feet; the middle line to her thighs ; and the inner line to her knees.\n\nThere are also three concentric circles(trivritta) representing three objectives of life: Dharma , Artha and Kama.\n\nThe avarana is Bhoopura and the Chakra is Trailokyamohana chakra ‘enchants the three worlds’. The yogini is Prakata;Mudra is Sarva Somkshibhni;Siddhi is Anima; and the mental state of the aspirant is Jagrata.The oresiding deity is Tripura . Her Vidya is Am Am Sauh.The gem is topaz. The time is 24 minutes and the Shaktis are 28 that include the ten starting with Anima, the eight starting with Brahmya and the ten Mudra Saktis. 28 is the dominant number.\n\nThis avarana corresponds to the feet of the mother goddess.\n\n2.The sixteen petalled lotus(shodasha dala padma) called sarva asha paripuraka chakra , the fulfiller of all desires , is the second enclosure. In the sixteen petals , the sixteen vowels of Sanskrit alphabet is inscribed.These symbolize sixteen kalas or aspects or phases. They are also called nithyas and named Kamakarshini (fascinating the desires), Budhyakarshini (fascinating the intellect) etc. These relate to powers in the Five Elements, the ten senses of perception or Indriyas (being further divided into five organs of action and five sense organs) and the Mind.\n\nThe significance of this enclosure is explained as self-protection(atma raksha) of the devotee.Since frustrated desire is the strongest obstacle to spiritual progress, the next stage is wisely concerned with satisfying them. Only he who has experienced can renounce. The values of virtue, wealth and pleasure are granted at this stage.\n\nThe craving Asha springs from discontent; and is quenched when discontent is eliminated. That is possible when devotee identifies himself with Shiva , ever complete and ever content.\n\nThis is acheived by the cultivation or strengthening of power over mind, ego, sound, touch, sight, taste, smell, intellect, steadiness, memory, name, growth, etheric body, revivification, and physical body.\n\nThe avarana is Shodasa Dala, and the Chakra is Sarvasaparipuraka chakra ‘fulfills all expectations’; the yogini is Gupta Yogini; Mudra is Sarva Vidravini; the Siddhi is Laghima; and the mental state is Swapna, The presiding deity is Tripureshi. Her vidya is Aim Klim Sauh.The gem is sapphire.The time is three hours. The Shaktis are the sixteen starting with Kamakarshini.16 is the dominant number.\n\nThis avarana corresponds to the Savdhistana chakra of the mother goddess.\n\n3. Eight petalled lotus (astha dala padma) called Sarva-samkhobhana –Chakra the agitator of all, is the third avarana.Each petal has a consonant inscribed within it that begins with 'Ka' The petals represent eight divinities associated with erotic urges , independent of physical body(ananga).These relate to mental pleasures derived through five organs and through the modalities of mind: rejection(repulsion or withdrawal), acceptance (attention or attachment) and indifference(detachment).\n\nThis enclosure represents the last of the first group of the chakras that symblolzes Shrusti or emanation.\n\nThe avarana is ashta dala; The Chakra is Sarvasamkshobana chakra ‘agitates all’. The Yogini is Gupta_ tara; Mudra is Sarvakarshini; the Siddhi is Mahima; and the mental state is Shushupti. The Presiding deity is Tripura Sundari. Her vidya is Hrim Klim Sauh.The gem is cat's eye.The time is day and night .the Shaktis are the eight starting with Ananga Kusuma. 8 is the diminant number.\n\nThis avarana corresponds to the navel region of mother goddess.\n\n4. Fourteen triangles(chaturdasha trikona) called sarva sowbhagya dayaka , the bestower of all prosperity is the fourth enclosure. This is in the form of a complex figure made up of fourteen triangles. The fourteen triangles are inscribed with fourteen consonants beginning with ka and ending with dha.The fourteen corners represent fourteen powers of mother goddess. These are said to preside over fourteen principle channels of vital forces in human body(naadis) corresponding with fourteen powers Sarva _Samkshobhini and others.\n\nThey are also related to the seat of Shaktis who represent: the Mind (Manas), the Intellect (Buddhi), Being (Chitta), the Conscious Ego (Ahamkara) and the ten Indriyas.\n\nThis enclosure refers to the channels of life currents in the human body(prana) and their identity with the aspects of Sri Chakra.The explanation given in Tantra texts is that the breathing in human body is influenced by five elements present in the body; and in turn those five elements are influenced by the manner we breathe.Normally , we breathe 360 times in a unit of time called nadika( equivalent to 24 minutes). A day (dina) consists 60 such nadikas.Therefore , in a day(24 hours) we breathe 21,600 times.The collection of all breathes is mother goddess herself.This is called nadi_chakra , the organization of winds within the body.The distribution of breathes among the body centers is as follows:\n\nChakra\n\nNumber of\n\nBreathes\n\nTime taken\n\nHrs-mins-sec\n\nMuladhara\n\n0,600\n\n00-40-00\n\nSvadhistana\n\n6,000\n\n06-40-00\n\nManipura\n\n6,000\n\n06-40-00\n\nAnahata\n\n6,000\n\n06-40-00\n\nVishuddha\n\n1,000\n\n01-06-40\n\nAjna\n\n1,000\n\n01-06-40\n\nSahasra\n\n1,000\n\n01-06-40\n\nTotal\n\n21,600\n\n24-00-00\n\nThe navel is the central point for distribution of all breathes and life forces moving along the channels. Normally breath alternates between the ida channel reaching the left nostril and pingala the channel reaching the right nostril. The former is moon principle and cools the body; and the latter is sun principle warms the body. The two meet at muladhara, close to kundalini. Around this central channel is a network of 72,000 channels of which the more important are the 14 mentioned earlier in this paragraph. These are referred also as 14 divinities. In this avarana the number 14 is dominant.\n\nSri Chakra is also described as the diagrammatic representation of the cycle of time (kaala chakra) and of the chakras in human system.\n\nThe Avarana is Chaturdasara; the Chakra is Sarva soubhagya dayaka chakra, ‘grants excellence’. The Yogini is Sampradaya Yogini; the Mudra is Sarva Shankari; the Siddhi is Ishitva The mental state is Iswara Vichara. the presiding deity is Tripura Vasini. Her vidya is is Haim Hklim Hsauh.The gem is coral.The time is day and night . The Shaktis are the fourteen starting with Samkshobhini.14 is the dominant number.\n\nThis avarana corresponds to the heart of mother goddess.\n\n5.Ten-sided figure (bahir_dasara) called Sarvartha Sadhaka chakra (accomplisher of all objects) consisting ten triangles , is the fifth avarana. It is named “ the outer ten cornered figure”(bahir dasar) inorder to distinguish it from a similar figure enclosed within it.\n\nThe ten triangles in this avarana house ten auspicious deties , such as Sarva siddhi prada, Sarva sampath prada, Sarva priyamkari, Sarva mangala karini and so on. The five of the triangles are inscribed with consonants beginiing with Ka; and the other five triangles are inscribed with consonants beginning with Cha..These represent ten powers of mother goddess who presides over ten vital forces pranas active in the body.The idea of vayu the winds or vital currents is fundamental to the concept of channels. The vital currents are divided into two groups : prana_panchaka and naga_panchaka.The first group consista prana, apana, vyana,udanaand samana vayus.These are responsible for body functions such as respiration, blodd circulation , digestion, voice and seperation of nutrients from food etc. The second group consists vital currents such as naga,kurma, krkara, devadatta and dhananjaya.These are involved in body movemen like belching, yawning movement of eyelids,causing various sounds in the body. The Dhanajaya vayu , it is said, is the last to leave the body at its death. In this avarana the number ten is dominanat.\n\nThe Avarana is Bahirdasara; the Chakra is Sarvarthasadhakachakra, the ‘accomplisher of all’. The Yogini is Kulotteerna yogini;; the Mudra is Sarvonmadini; and the Siddhi is Vashitva. The mental state is Guroopa Sadanam. The presiding deity is Tripura Shri. Her vidya is is Haim Hklim Hsauh.The gem is pearl.The time is lunar day. The Shaktis are the ten starting with Sarva Siddhi Prada.10 is the dominant number.\n\nThis avarana corresponds to the neck of mother goddess.\n\n6.Ten sided figure (antar dasara) called Sarva raksha karaka ( one that protects all )consisting ten triangles is the sixth avarana. It is named antar dasara , the inner ten cornered figure , since it is placed within a similar ten cornered figure , mentioned earlier.\n\nThe ten triangles are inscribed with ten consonants beginning with the five of Tha and the five of Ta group. They represent the powers of the mother goddess who presides over ten vital fires (vanyaha).These represent the ten specific fires within the body; being the fire of purgation (Rechak), digestion (Pachak), absorption (Shoshak), burning (Dahak), the secretion of enzymes (Plavak), acidification (Ksharak), to take out or excrete (Uddharak), the fires of pessimism and frustration (Kshobhak), the fire of assimilation (Jrambhak) and creating luster (Mohak).\n\nThis enclosure is the third of the secong group of chakras representing Preservation. The advent of inner realization begins here.The significancew of this avarana is explained as protection from all obstacles.The devotee distances himself from all that hinders his spiritual progress ; and he begins to develop an awareness he is Shiva( the consciousness).\n\nThe Avarana is Antardasara; the Chakra is Sarvaraksakara chakra ‘protects all’. The Yogini is Nigarbha Yogini; the Mudra is Sarva mahankusha; and the Siddhi is Prakamya. The mental state is Upadesa. The presiding deity is Tripura Malini. Her vidya is is Hrim Klim Blem.The gem is emerald.The time is Lunar Fortnight . The Shaktis are the ten starting with Sarvagnya.10 is the dominant number.\n\nThis avarana corresponds to the middle of the eyebrows (bhrukuti) of the mother goddess.\n\n7.Eight_cornered figure(ashtara) called Sarva roga hara ( the removere of all deceases) is the seventh avarana.In the eight triangles formed by this figure, eight divinities presiding over speech reside.Between them they cover all the alphabets in Sanskrit grammar.These shaktis also rule over contradictions in lfe (dwandwa) such as cold(water) and heat(fire); happiness(air) and sorrow( earth); as also the Desire(akasha-space) and the three gunas of Sattvas (consciousness), Rajas(ego) and Tamas(mind).\n\nThe significance of this enclosure is its power to eradicate the most basic disease viz. involvement with impure , fleeting existence that is laden with stress. The blessed state is attained when the distinctions between the subject, the object and transactions between them are dissolved.\n\nThe avarana is asthakona; the Chakra is Sarvarogahara chakra ‘cures all ills’.the Yogini is Rahasya Yogini; The Mudra is sarva khechari; and the Siddhi is Bhukthi. The mental state is Manana. The presiding deity is Tripura Siddha. Her vidya is is Hrim Shrim Sauh.The gem is diamond (Vajra).The time is Lunar month. The Shaktis are the eight, starting with Vashini. 8 is the dominant number.\n\nThis avarana corresponds to the forehead (lalata) of the mother goddess.\n\nThe Four Weapons\n\nIn between the mandalas of eight triangles and the central triangles are the four weapons -- flowery bow, flowery arrows, noose(pasha) and goad(ankusha). They are red in color.They are the wepons of both the mother goddess as Kameshwari and also of Shiva as Kameshwara.\n\n8.The primary triangle with its apex downward(East) and colored white(Sattva) sorrounding immediately around the central point , Bindu , is the eigth avarana. It is called Sarva Siddhi prada chakra , the one that bestows all accomplishment. This triangle does not intersect with other triangles; and stands independent.It is Kama Kala. It is femine in its aspect; and represents three fundamental manifestations of the mother goddess: Kameshwari (symbolizing moon - creation); Vajreshwari (symbolizing sun- preservation); and Bhagamalini (symbolizing fire -dissolution).\n\nThe three angles of the triangle also represent three forms of speech : Pashyanthi,Madhyama and Vaikhari. The triangle is therefore the speech aspect Vak Bhava.\n\nIt also represents the three powers of iccha (will) , jnana (knowledge) and kriya(activity).The three corners of the triangle stand for three peaks(kuta) of the fifteen_lettered mantra; or as three dimensions of all existence. The triangle itself is regarded the abode of the mother goddess (kama_kala).\n\nThe Avarana is Trikona; the Chakra is Sarvasiddhiprada chakra, ‘grants all attainments’. the Yogini is Athi Rahasya Yogini;the Mudra is Sarva Beeja; and the Siddhi is Iccha. The mental state is Nitidhyasana. The presiding deity is Tripuraamba. Her vidya is is Hsraim Hsrklim Hsrsauh..The gem is Gomaya .The time is a ritu- two months. The Shaktis are the three starting with Kameshwari. (4+3=7)is the dominant number.\n\nThis avarana corresponds to the top of the head (masthka) of the mother goddess.\n\n9.The ninth enclosure is strictly not an enclosure. It is the central dimensionless point , the Bindu . It is called Sarvananda_maya chakra , the supremely blissfull one. It is independent of the intersecting triangles.It is colored red.This, in a temple, would be the sanctum sanctorum, with all the other circles or enclosures representing various parts of the temple as you move inwards.\n\nIt is this Bindu that is in reality the Sri Chakra; it represents the mother goddess Maha Tripura Sundari , Lalitha or Rajarajeshwari hersef ; and everything else is a manifestation of her aspects.\n\nThe goddess is nothing other than the devotees own self.The self here does not refer to jiva , engaged in organizing the body, mind and senses.The self here refers to individual conciousness(buddhi) which is beyond the body-mind complex. It is filled with all bliss(sarvananda maya). This constant , abundant bliss is the epression of the union of Shiva( consciousness) and Shakthi (power of deliberation Vimarsha). It is the very basis of existence. it is called beautiful , sundara , in this sense. It is in this sense the supreme mother goddess is called Maha Tripurasundari.\n\nThe significance of this avarana is the complete harmony(samarasya) of principles of pure consciousness (Shiva) and the principle of energy as deliberation(vimarsha shakthi).It signifies a state of nondualty, where all tendencies of approach and withdrawal become nonexistent, dissolve in a state in which the devotee ultimately rests.Bliss , in Tantra , is explained as resting in oneself(Svarupa pratishta).\n\nThere is also a school which propounds that the central point is composed of three dots or drops(Bindu traya) representing three fires(vanhi): Moon(soma);Sun(surya); and Fire(Agni).The top dot symbolizes the head of the deity; and the pair of dots at the bottom symboloze the breasts of the Mother.It is explained that the central point expandin into the three is an act of swelling(ucchuna); and that is how the central point becomes the primary triangle in Sri Chakra.\n\nThe avarana is the Bindu and the Chakra is Sarvanandamaya chakra, ‘replete with bliss’. The yogini is parathi para Rahasya; the Mudra is sarva yoni; and the Siddhi is Prapthi. The mental state is Savikalpa Samadhi. The presiding deity is her Transcendent Majesty Lalita Maheshvari Mahatripurasundari. Her vidya is Kamaraja vidya : ka e i la hrim ha sa ka ha la hrim sa ka la hrim, plus a secret 16th syllable.The gem is ruby. The time is year. The Shakti is Maha Tripura Sundari the personification of Brahman.\n\nThis avarana corresponds to Brahma_randra on the top of the head of the mother goddess.\n\n***\n\nTraveling from the outer periphery wall to the inner bindu is an ascent through various levels of consciousness and mystical significance, overcoming myriad obstacles of conditioning and fears along the way. As he proceeds inward from the outermost enclosure the devotee’s thoughts are gradually refined; and the association of ideas is gradually freed from the constraints of conventional reality.The Devi is felt or visualized in his heart and then drawn out through the breath and installed in the yantra. She is then worshipped as actually residing there. The true home of Devi is however in his heart .The devotee identifies himself with the Devi and goes through the worship guided by the symbolism. Whatever be the details , the symbolism involved is important in the external worship ; and more so in internal worship( contemplation on the import of the chakra).\n\nSri Chakra is also a contruct of space and time, just as the universe is a space time continum. The way of the universe is continious and consitant change. That change , in a relative existence , is measured by the phases of moon . Mother goddes is the principle of time ; she is kala or nitya. The Sri Chakra also puts forth the interdependence of time and space. The devotee views the evolution of the universe as the unfolding of a changeless reality of Mother goddess\n\n.\n\nThe Sri Chakra represents the interplay of the purusha and prakriti; the universe and its energy. The union of the Devi (energy) and Shiva (consciousness) worshipped in Sri Chakra is the universe and its evolution. The universe is trhus stylized into a pattern of energies, symbolized by the patterns and layout of Sri Chakra.It provides a model to the individual for transformation . The conciousness of the individual finds in it an articulation; and the model helps in breaking the barriers of subjective feelings and limitations of the objective world. The devotee identifies that his body is the Sri Chakra or the universe in epitome; and that TheYantra too is the Devi. The aim is to realize that oneness, the bliss of pure consciousness.\n\nReference;\n\nThe Tantra of Sri Chakra\n\nBy Prof.SK Ramachandra Rao\n\n(1953)\n\nLalita Tripurasundari, the Red Goddess\n\nSri Yantra - the Significance and Symbolism of its design\n\nPrevious\n\nSri Muthuswami Dikshitar – a life sketch\n\nDikshitar and Western Music\n\nDikshitar and Hindustani music\n\nMusic of Muthuswami Dikshitar\n\nSri Chakra and Sri Vidya\n\nNext:\n\nKamalamba Navavarana Kritis"
