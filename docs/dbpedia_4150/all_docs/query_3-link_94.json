        "text": "Success and wellbeing are things that everyone looks for. Each of us may have individual ideas of what success is and follow different routes to wellbeing, but the underlying desire is the same. This was recognized in ancient Indian culture, and so, yogis and mystics down the ages created many devices to aid human beings in their quest for immediate and ultimate wellbeing. Yantras are devices of this kind, which are created as support systems towards a particular purpose.\n\nIn classical Sanskrit, the word, yantra, means “instrument,” “apparatus” or “contrivance.” It is derived from the root word, yam, meaning “to support” or “to sustain the essence of an object/concept.”\n\nA yantra means a machine. A machine is a combination of very purposeful forms. For example, a computer is a product of our minds, but still, if we want to multiply 1736 with 13,343, we reach for a calculator – a yantra. It is not that the calculation is not possible in the mind, but this purposeful form or yantra allows us to use our body in a much better way.\n\nEven though you already have the body – the most sophisticated yantra – with you, it is possible to perform different types of activities better with specific machines for those activities.\n\nCan Yantra transform our life?\n\nYantras are usually associated with a particular deity and are used for specific benefits, such as meditation; protection from harmful influences; development of particular powers; attraction of wealth or success, etc. They are often used in daily ritual worship at home or in temples, and sometimes worn as a talisman.\n\nAs an aid to meditation, yantras represent the deity that is the object of meditation. These yantras emanate from the central point, the Bindu. The yantra typically has several geometric shapes radiating concentrically from the center, including triangles, circles, hexagons, octagons, and symbolic lotus petals.\n\nThe outside often includes a square representing the four cardinal directions, with doors to each of them. A popular form is the Sri Chakra, or Sri Yantra, which represents the goddess in her form as Tripura Sundari. Sri Chakra also includes a representation of Shiva and is designed to show the totality of creation and existence, along with the user’s unity with the cosmos.\n\nHow are Yantras consecrated?\n\nYantras can be on a flat surface or three dimensional. Yantras can be drawn or painted on paper, engraved on metal, or any flat surface. They tend to be smaller in size than the similar mandala, and traditionally use less color than mandalas.\n\nOccult yantras are used as good luck charms, to ward off evil, as preventative medicine, in exorcism, etc., by their magical power. When used as a talisman, the yantra is seen to represent a deity who can be called on at will by the user. They are traditionally consecrated and energized by a priest, including the use of mantras which are closely associated with the specific deity and yantra.\n\nPractitioners believe that a yantra that is not energized with a mantra is lifeless.\n\nTypes of Yantras.\n\nIndia’s ancient science of architecture Vastu Shastra recommends the use of cosmic instruments (Yantras). Popular yantras such as Shri Yantra, Yantra for meditation, Ganesh Yantra, Sri Chakram, Gayatri Yantra, Shani Yantra, etc were used by yogis, rishis, and sages for there numerous benefits.\n\nBut one cannot install any yantra. There are different yantras for different purposes. One may look for an increase in wealth, therefore kuber yantra is recommended as Lord kuber is the treasurer of heavenly planets who blesses material riches and wealth. The installation of the yantra is like placing an idol in the temple.\n\nIn an absolute sense of spirituality, Yantras are the living force that attracts positive energies and pushes the negative ones out of the atmosphere. A yantra needs to be installed with particular mantras, to attract positive energies, drive away from the negative ones, and spiritually uplift the occupant house."
