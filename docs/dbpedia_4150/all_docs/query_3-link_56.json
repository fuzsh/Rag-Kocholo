        "text": "Vedic astrology or Jyotish is the “Science of Light”, an ancient astrological discipline that originated more than 5,000 years ago during the Pre-Vedic civilization of ancient India. The “Rishis”, a Sanskrit word meaning “seers” or high priests of the Vedas, cognized through transcendental visions, the connection between the celestial bodies of our solar system and the human body.\n\nThe motion of the planets and their positions in relation to each other, acts upon us throughout our lifetime, just as the lunar phases push and pull the oceans and the seas.\n\nAccording to the Vedic science of astrology, the planets and all the stars in our universe represent certain energies, and, in fact, do emit magnetic and electric fields. Vedic astrology held that each planet gives out its own, cosmic color, generating a particular energy and influence that propagates throughout the cosmos. The transmission of these colored rays through space, accompanied by the energy-giving properties of heat, magnetism and electricity, have an influence on the life of every living creature.\n\n“Yat Pinde Tat Brahmande”\n\n“We, as microcosm, are just a reflection of the outer macrocosm.”\n\nThe location of the various planets during a person’s birth, can be mapped scientifically through an astrological horoscope.\n\nAccording to it, certain planets will be well positioned, some will be unfavorable and some will give mixed results.\n\nEvery person’s life is therefore, the result of this cosmic design, this planetary arrangement seen in the sky at the time of our birth, which originated and resulted by activities and actions during our previous lives.\n\nVedic astrology opines that karma is not eternal and can be changed. There are several ways to balance or enhance our planetary karma. Its methods include meditation (the greatest balancing method), physical postures (yoga), medicine (ayurveda), wearing of gemstones, color therapy, mantras, prayers, rituals, herbs, food, etc.\n\nVedic astrology deals with seven visible planets and two invisible ones: the SUN, MOON, MARS, MERCURY, JUPITER, VENUS, and SATURN, along with the two lunar nodes, RAHU (ascending lunar node) and KETU (descending lunar node). These nodes are the two intersecting points of the solar and lunar planes as seen from the earth.\n\nNine astrological gemstones are associated with these planets. Associated with the Sun is the RUBY, with the Moon is the PEARL, with Mars is the RED CORAL, with Mercury the EMERALD, with Jupiter is the YELLOW SAPPHIRE, with Venus is the DIAMOND, with Saturn the BLUE SAPPHIRE, with Rahu the HESSONITE GARNET, and with Ketu is the CAT’S EYE CHRYSOBERYL. Associated with the nine planets are also the days of the week, different parts of the human body and different metals.\n\nHowever,todays science has found there is a enoughf scientific truth behind Planetary Gemology.\n\nGEMOLOGY: THE MYSTERY HIDDEN IN STONES\n\nOur great sages and polymaths perfected the art and the science of astrology in ancient times. As such astrology has witnessed continuous development and proliferated into many branches and divisions, all of which are equal in importance. Gemmology or the scientific and ethnic study of gemstones is an important and integral part of applied astrology. It is so popular among the Indian public that no one is certain as to when it had actually come into practice. Use of precious gems and stones has been an ancient practice in India. Some people believe that it is one or two thousand years old science while others maintain that science and art of gemmology originated about five or ten thousand years ago. Scriptural evidences however show that concept of gemmology is as old as the creation itself. A very famous hymn says:\n\nSASHANKH CHAKRAM SAKIRIT KUNDALAM, SAPEET VASTRAM SARASI RUNEKSHANAM ||\n\nSAHAR VAKSH STHAL KAUSTUBHASHRIYAM, NAMAMI VISHNUM SIRASA CHATURBHUJAM ||\n\nApart from many kinds of weapons, Lord Vishnu bears Kaustubha Mani (a gem named Kaustubh) on his chest. This gem is most dear to Him. This hymn shows that even before the whole universe came into being, Lord Vishnu did have an existence and the gem Kaustubh also existed along with Him.\n\nDuring medieval period also, various scholars shed light on the science of gemmology. They authored many great scriptures as well. Acharya Varahmihir was the most prominent of those great scholars. A scripture Vrihat Samhita written by Varahmihir still has a wide recognition among the gemologists. It has a whole chapter, Ratnadhyay devoted to the comprehensive description of the gemstones. Among Puranas, Agnipurana contains exhaustive description about gemmology.\n\nIn modern era also, countless scholars are continuously working with dedication in the field of gemmology. Thanks to their efforts that the science of gemmology is scaling new heights.\n\nIn the present discussion, we shall try to find out:\n\n1) What are gems?\n\n2) Is wearing a stone mere superstition or it really bears fruit?\n\n3) What is the chemical composition of the gemstones?\n\n4) In what circumstances should the gemstones be worn?\n\n5) In which circumstances should the gemstones not be worn?\n\n6) Which person should wear which stone?\n\n7) Which person should not wear which stone?\n\n8) How did the gemstones originate as per the religious scriptures of India?\n\n9) Stones of which planets can be worn together?\n\n10) Do the gemstones have medicinal use also? What is the gemopathy?\n\n11) What are the 6 jewels and how did they originate?\n\n12) How can the gems and jewels be classified?\n\n13) What is the total number of the gemstones and what are their names?\n\nLet us first try to understand what a gem is. We are all familiar with the adjective use of the words gem, jewel etc. Any dear one or prominent one is addressed as a ‘gem’ or ‘jewel’ in colloquial terms. Similarly anything that is rare in qualities, availability or virtues is also referred to as a gem or jewel. But literally, a gem is something that has been dug out from earth or deep sea and has many rare but miraculous qualities. A gem is unique and often rare because of its specific composition. It may differ in effects, colour, tinge and hues. Similarly, prices of the same stone, may also vary with slight difference in appearance.\n\nAll the gems and jewels however have one thing in common i.e. their hue. A jewel has a distinct hue that differentiates it from the rest of the commonly available materials. Our learned sages have described eighty-four different kinds of gems and jewels among which nine are most important. Because of it, titles like Navratna (nine most precious gems) came into practice. But being superior in designation does not mean that the remaining seventy-five gems are totally worthless or not in common use. They too have their distinct appearance, beauty, hues and effects and are important accordingly. Their uses are also wide and varied such as personal beautification, adornment, house building, idol construction, exhibition of wealth and luxury etc. Thus, there are totally eighty-four gems and jewels of which nine are main (or more popular) and seventy-five are less popular.\n\nThough there are different classes and categories of the gems that distinguish them from one another, but gemstones belonging to the same category resemble one another to a great extent with slight variations in hues and appearance.\n\nSome of the stones have uniform colours like yellow, green, red, blue, violet, black or golden while many have a mixed hue of different colours. Each gem has its own importance. Regardless of category, a gemstone is priced according to its beauty, brilliance, appearance and purity. Lacking these qualities, a gemstone has no worth in the eye of a connoisseur. Diamond, sapphire, topaz, emerald and ruby belong to the category of most precious stones. All of them have their distinct chemical composition and are priced accordingly.\n\nThus now we may say that-\n\n1) Gemstones are harder than ordinary stones.\n\n2) Gemstones are more brighter and smoother than ordinary stones.\n\n3) Distinct hue is the main feature of a gemstone.\n\n4) Usually, each gemstone radiates rays similar to its colour.\n\n5) Radiation effect of the gemstones is controlled and affected by the light and rays of the planets and group of stars situated in space.\n\n6) Gemstones have both positive and negative capacities.\n\n7) A particular gemstone prescribed for a particular planet receives the rays from that planet and facilitates them to enter our body.\n\nORIGIN OF JEWELS: Experts have a difference of opinion regarding the origin of jewels. Researchers tell that many kinds of jewels are manufactured within the body of living organisms from the various actions and reactions of their blood, marrow, flesh etc. Some of the jewels are produced in nature through the reactions and combinations of different chemical compounds. Still some jewels are obtained from specific vegetation, plants and rocks.\n\nLike gems, jewels too can be classified into different categories according to their appearances, effects and the compounds present within them. But before going through their physical classification, lets be familiar with the classification of jewels as has been mentioned in Indian scriptures. Through the origin of jewels as given in Indian mythology appears more like fantasies in the present scientific age, but it may have some degree of truth. Besides, it is relevant here to learn about the origin of jewels as described in mythology for various reasons. Hymns and other descriptions of Indian religious scriptures are more cryptic in nature and need proper deciphering for who knows what is hidden in them. Gemmology is no exception in this context.\n\nAccording the great astrologer Varahmihir, jewels are of three kinds\n\n1) Jewels of the sky or heaven.\n\n2) Jewels of the earth.\n\n3) Jewels of the nether world.\n\nThus, in all the three worlds, superior gems are found and the excellent among them are known as jewels.\n\nAccording to mythology, jewels found in heaven are-\n\n1) Kaustubh Mani.\n\n2) Chinta Mani.\n\n3) Syamantak Mani.\n\n4) Rudra Mani.\n\n1) Kaustubh Mani: It has a deep blue colour like a blue lotus and a radiance equal to the sun. It was obtained during the churning of the sea. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Vishnu wears Kaustubh Mani in a garland on his chest. This is said to be a powerful jewel and bestows fortune, luxuries as well as invincibility on to its wearer besides extremely beautiful and imposing.\n\n2) Chinta Mani: Name of this jewel is self-explicit. The wearer is freed from all the worries and fretting. It is white in colour and has a brilliant hue. It gives its wearer all kinds of wealth and comforts.\n\n3) Syamantak Mani: It is a common belief that this jewel adorns the necklace of Lord Surya (the sun god). It is said to have a brilliant blue hue that instantaneously blinds the onlooker. If it is taken in darkness, it fills the ambience with day-like light. There is an interesting tale related to this jewel.\n\nIn the Dwapar Yuga, Lord Surya had presented the Syamantak Mani to his devotee Prasanjit as he was pleased by his devotion. Prasanjit visited the court of Lord Krishna wearing the jewel. All the courtiers were amazed by the brilliance of this jewel and said to Prasanjit that he did not deserve the jewel, so he should present it to none other than Lord Krishna. But Prasanjit did not want to present the jewel to Lord Krishna and stealthily left the court. Later on, Prasanjit’s brother whose having the Mani in his possesion went to the forests on a hunting excursion and was killed by a lion. The lion took the jewel with it but was killed by Jambvant, the ursine aid of Lord Rama. Jambvant took the jewel to his cave and gave it to his daughter.\n\nBack there in the kingdom, when Prasanjit’s brother did not return for many days, suspicious fingers began to point at Lord Krishna. So, Lord Krishna set out to search Mani. Following the footmarks of Prasanjit brother, the lion and Jambvant, Lord Krishna reached the den of Jambvant and saw Jambvant’s children playing with the jewel. As soon as Lord Krishna took the jewel in this possession, Jambvant also arrived there and a fierce duel followed between them. At last Jambvant recognized Lord & presented Lord Shri Krishna the Mani with his daughter Jambvati . Thus recovering the jewel Syamantak, Lord Krishna returned to Dwarka and washed the blemish. It is believed now that Lord Krishna himself wears the jewel Syamantak.\n\nRudra Mani: Nobody will be unaware of the bounty of Lord Shiva. His costumes as well as ornaments are strange. He wears only tiger’s skin and formidable black snakes around his shoulder. The gods presented Lord Shiva with a jewel that came to be known as Rudra Mani. Lord Shiva threadened the jewel among the beads of His rosary. The jewel has a brilliant, golden hue and three stripes on it. Like Lord Shiva, the jewel Rudra Mani is also benevolent in virtues.\n\nThus, according to Hindu mythology, only four jewels come in the category of heavenly jewels. Now, lets understand something about the jewels that belong to the nether world.\n\nPaatal of Hindu mythology is known by different names such as Nagaloka, Rasatala, Bhugarbh loka etc. According to mythology, it is inhabited not by humans but by great snakes as its name Naga loka shows. While discussing about the jewels of the nether worlds, Nagas are regarded as the inhabitants of the Paatal and Vasuki was their monarch. Some of the prominent and popular jewels of Naga Loka or are the following- Naga Mani: It is said that this jewel is present on the head of a snake. Its light shows the snake its way even in pitch darkness. When the snake senses some danger, it at once swallows the jewel. But it is said that all the snakes do not have this jewel. Only a few, privileged ones have it on their hoods. Naga Mani is said to be extremely rare.\n\nOnly nine kinds of snakes are regarded as the wearer of this mysterious jewel called Naga Mani. It is said that the colour of the jewel exactly matches the colour of the snake and the jewel emits light of the same colour. These nine kinds of the snake are:\n\n1) Black snake.\n\n2) Blue snake.\n\n3) Yellow snake.\n\n4) Gray snake.\n\n5) Red snake.\n\n6) White snake.\n\n7) Green snake.\n\n8) Copper-coloured snake.\n\n9) Milky snake.\n\nAccording to the scriptures all of these snakes wear jewels that exactly match their body colour. It is also a coincidence that the number of planets in the solar system is also nine. The colours of these planets more or less match with the colours of these jewels. That is why, the practice of wearing a jewel, whose colour exactly matches with that of the planet came into being. But these jewels (Naga Manis) are not easily available. That is why practice of wearing gems and stones in place of the jewels became popular.\n\nNow is the time to take a detailed look at the gems and jewels found on the earth. Though, not innumerable kinds of gems and jewels are found on earth but according to Puranas and other authentic sources following kinds of gems and jewels are prominent:-\n\n1) Manikya (Ruby).\n\n2) Moti (Pearl).\n\n3) Mungaa (Coral).\n\n4) Panna (Emerald).\n\n5) Pukhraj (Yellow Sapphire).\n\n6) Neelam (Blue Sapphire).\n\n7) Heera (Diamond).\n\n8) Gomed (Hassonite).\n\n9) Lahsumiya (Cat’s eye).\n\n10) Phiroza (Turquoise).\n\n11) Chandrakant (Moon stone).\n\n12) Ghrit Mani.\n\n13) Tail Mani.\n\n14) Bheeshmak.\n\n15) Upalak Mani. (Opal)\n\n16) Sphatic Mani. (Rock Crystal)\n\n17) Paras Mani.\n\n18) Ulook Mani.\n\n19) Larvart. (Lapis Mani)\n\n20) Masar Mani.\n\n21) Ishiv.\n\nLets first understand the scriptural basis of classification of the gems and jewels.\n\nAccording to Vishnu Purana and Shrimad Bhagwat Mahapurana, Bali, the grandson of Prahlad was a great king of the demons. With a resolution of dethroning Indra as the king of heaven, Bali organized a hundred Ashwamedha Yagyas. On the appeal of Indra, Lord Vishnu decided to stop the hundredth Ashwamedha Yagya of Bali and arrived there in the guise of Vamana (a dwarf Brahmin) and begged him to donate land measuring three steps. In two steps, Lord measures entire earth and heaven. Since there was not room then to put the third step, Bali offered his head for the Lord to put his third step. Thus, Lord Vishnu sent Bali direct to the Paatal & offered him to rule the Whole nether World. With the touch of the Lord’s foot, Bali’s earthy body converted into Gem stones.\n\nThus, origin of different gems and jewels is as follows:\n\nManikya or Ruby: It originated from the Heart of Bali, hence it has red or pink colour\n\n.\n\nMoti or Pearl: It is believed to have originated from the mind or Manas of Raja Bali.\n\nMunga or Laal Mooga or Pavizham or Coral: It is orginated from the Blood of Mahabali\n\nPushyaraag or Peela Pukhraj or Yellow Sapphire: It originated from the flesh of Bali.\n\nIndraneela or Blue Sapphire: It originated from the eyes of the King Bali.\n\nVajra or Heera or Diamond: It originated from the pieces of Bali’s brain.\n\nHassonite or Gomet: This gem originated from the fat of the demon king.\n\nVaidurya or Lasouniya Cat’s Eye: This jewel originated from the Yagyopavit (sacred thread) of Bali.\n\nHara Panna or Maradaka Mani or Emreld: It originated from the nervous system of the demon king Bali.\n\nChandrakanth or Moonstone: It originated from the radiance of the eye’s pupils.\n\nGhrit Mani: This jewel originated from the pieces of the waist.\n\nTail Mani: Skin of the king Bali formed this jewel.\n\nBheeshmak: This gem was produced from the head pieces of Bali.\n\nUpalak Mani: phlegm of Bali produced this jewel.\n\nSphatik Mani (Rock Crystal): This jewel was formed from the sweat of Bali.\n\nParas Mani: Pieces of Bali’s heart formed Paras Mani.\n\nUlook Mani: This jewel was formed from the pieces of Bali’s tongue.\n\nLapis Lazuli: Bali’s hair formed this jewel.\n\nMasar Mani: This jewel was produced from the faeces of Bali.\n\nIshiv Mani: This jewel is believed to have from the semen of King Bali.\n\nThus in all, eighty four different parts and constituents of the demon king MahaBali. Of them, only twenty-one are described as gems or jewels due to peculiar brilliance they possess. Of these twenty-one gems, only nine are most famous for their radiance & special powers and are hence known as Navaratna.\n\nThus, there are nine main gems or jewels, twelve common gems and sixty-three ordinary gems which are also known as sub-gems.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF GEMS AND JEWELS\n\nTotal Main Jewels Common Jewels Ordinary Gems\n\n84 (EIGHTY FOUR) 9 (NINE) 12 (TWELVE) 63 (SIXTY THREE)\n\nThis origin of gems as given in the scriptures may appear not more than a mere high flight of imagination to the modern physicists, but no one can refute the logic behind this origin. Even the modern science describes about the existence of eighty-four different kinds of specific stones in nature. Now their existence is a universal truth regardless of how these stones came into being. The earth is the mine of all the gems and jewels hence it is also called as Ratnagarbha (mother of all the jewels).\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF JEWELS\n\nGems and jewels are basically stones but they are not easily and universally available as ordinary stones are. From time immemorial, stones have been affecting our life either directly or indirectly. Building of temple, idols of the deity, near the railway tracks and the building of our own house we see scores of varied uses of stones. This is a world of stones literally.\n\nThere will hardly be a country in the world where stones are not found. Now even the ordinary stones come in scores of varieties. Some are highly expensive while others are comparatively cheap. But each of them has their own independent existence. Not one stone can be given a lower value and that is why every kind of stone has its own use.\n\nGemstones are inherently expensive and cannot be put in menial uses. Almost all of them have some latent power often called divine power. These gemstones are not universally available also. Due to their peculiar appearance, brilliance and colour, these gemstones draw our attention and tempt us to wear or possess them.\n\nEven the experts world over agree regarding the total number of gemstones and recognize eighty-four kinds of different gemstones. But only nine of them are recognized as the main gems, while the rest seventy-five gems come under the sub-gem category. But those seventy-five minor kinds of gems too have some latent power. Often some sub-gems surpasses the main gems in qualities.\n\nIn India, nine major types of gems have been used more traditionally. But as the trade and commerce of our country increased with others, we gained more knowledge about lesser varieties of gemstones as well. Our learned experts analyzed them deeply and discovered many practical applications of these jewels. Thus, the use of seventy-five lesser kinds of stones also saw a fare and square increase. Lets first of all be familiar with the names of these gemstones.\n\nThe names of these gemstones:\n\nAmber.\n\nAkik(Agate).\n\nAbari.\n\nAmalia.\n\nAlemani.\n\nUdak.\n\nUpal(Opal).\n\nAlexendrite.\n\nCasoti (Touch stone)\n\nKaharava.\n\nCalaline.\n\nKataila (Amethyst)\n\nKurund.\n\nKakarnili.\n\nKuduratta.\n\nKhara.\n\nGomed (Hassonite)\n\nGodanta.\n\nGauti.\n\nGudari.\n\nCheeta (Vyaghraksha or Tiger’s eye)\n\nChumbak (Magnet)\n\nJaharmohara (Soap stone)\n\nJaje Mani.\n\nJaharat (Dugdh pashan or milk stone)\n\nJabar jad.\n\nJharana.\n\nTori.\n\nDuur.\n\nTamara (Garnate)\n\nTurvasa.\n\nTurmali (Tourmaline)\n\nDana firang.\n\nDarchana.\n\nDanvala.\n\nDurrenazaf.\n\nDoposta.\n\nDhunaila.\n\nNaram.\n\nNeelam (Blue Sapphire)\n\nPanna (Emerald)\n\nPanaghana.\n\nPitonia.\n\nPanni.\n\nPukhraj (Yellow Sapphire)\n\nPhiroza (Turquoise)\n\nPhitak.\n\nBeiruj.\n\nBansi.\n\nMariam.\n\nMarmar (Marble stone)\n\nMakatanis.\n\nMargaz.\n\nMakari.\n\nManikya (Ruby)\n\nMusa.\n\n57) Muvenazaf.\n\nMoonga (Coral)\n\nMoti (Pearl)\n\nMritangar (cinder stone)\n\nYashab (jade)\n\nYahood.\n\nRatartna.\n\nRomani.\n\nLahsuniya (Cat’s eye)\n\nLajvard (Lapis Lazuli)\n\nLalari.\n\nLudhia.\n\nShajar.\n\nSitara.\n\nSangi.\n\nSaramahi.\n\nCimac.\n\nSimrak.\n\nSinduria (carnelian)\n\nSingali.\n\nSulemani. (onyx)\n\nSunahala (Citrine)\n\nSona Makkhi.\n\nSuryaksha.\n\nCibar.\n\nHavas.\n\nHeera. (Diamond)\n\nHaddek.\n\nApart from these eighty-four stones, more kinds of stones have been described:\n\nParas (Philosopher’s stone).\n\nThus there are a total of eighty-eight different kinds of gemstones. Of these, existence of Paras (Philosopher’s stones) has never been found except folklore.\n\nMany experts do not regard magnet as a stone.\n\nTraditionally none major gems and jewels that belong to the category of Navaratna have been given more importance .\n\nGEMS DESCRIBED IN BRIHAT SANHITA\n\nGreat Indian mathematician and astrologer of the yore, Varahmihir has written profusely about the gemstones in his famous treatize Vrihatsamhita.\n\nFollowing is the names of the gemstones described in Vrihatsamhita.\n\nVajramani (Heera) Diamond.\n\nPadma r\n\nVimalak.\n\nMarakat (Panna) Emerald.\n\nVaidurya (Lahsunia) Cat’s eye.\n\nSphatic (Rock Crystal)\n\nSangandhik.\n\nIndraneel Mani (Neelam) Blue Sapphire.\n\nRudhir.\n\nRaja Mani.\n\nGomed (Gomedak) Hassonite.\n\nPushprag (Pukraj) Yellow Sapphire.\n\nMukta (Moti) Pearl.\n\nSamyak.\n\nShankh.\n\nKarkotak.\n\nPulak.\n\nShashikant.\n\nMahaneel.\n\nJyotiras.\n\nBrahmin Mani.\n\nPraval (Munga) Coral.\n\nThus, only twenty-two gemstones have been described in Vrihatsamhita. You may ask: Why? It can only be said about it that during the period of Varahmihir only these twenty-two gemstones could have been in fashion.\n\nOPAQUE GEMSTONES\n\nMany elemental impurities that are present in the crystal lattice of a gemstone not only increases its density but also makes it opaque to light. Though presence of these impurities does not affect the utility of the stone. Akik and Phiroza (turquoise) are the famous example of opaque gemstones. These two stones are regarded particularly miraculous.\n\nTRANSLUCENT GEMSTONES\n\nThese fall between the transparent and opaque categories. Many important gemstones come under the category of translucent stones. These stones are not as clear as the transparent stones nor as filthy as the opaque ones. Hence, the translucent gemstones can aptly be described as dim gemstones.\n\nRegardless of the category, gemstones have more importance than the ordinary stones and are hence more in demand despite their high value. To be valuable a gemstone should fulfill some conditions like smoothness, better cut, brilliance etc. Apart from these hardness is another condition that a gemstone should comply to be designated as a jewel. Gemstones are invariably harder than the ordinary stones.\n\nHARDNESS OF THE GEMSTONES\n\nComposition of the chemical compounds, their mixture, relative density, crystal lattice etc. together determine the hardness of a gemstone. Since the chemical composition varies from stones to stones hence each and every gemstone has its unique hardness which commonly does not match with that of the other. Hardness is the main property of a gemstone. Diamond is the hardest gemstone. In fact, it is the hardest substance in the world. Besides it, emerald, blue and yellow sapphires and ruby are also hard. Coral is also hard but interestingly it is not a true stone. It is in fact a fossil and organic in origin.\n\nNext to hardness it is specific density that differentiates one gemstone from another.\n\nSPECIFIC DENSITY OF THE GEMS\n\nGemstone Sp.Density\n\nTOPAZ 3.53\n\nDIAMOND 3.52\n\nHASSONITE (AGATE) 4.20\n\nSPINEL 2.15\n\nOPAL 2.60\n\nROCK CRYSTAL 2.65\n\nAQUAMARINE 2.74\n\nTURQUOISE 2.82\n\nMOONSTONE 2.87\n\nPARIDOT 3.40\n\nGAMET 4.07\n\nApart from brilliance, hardness is the second distinguishing feature of the gemstones. Hardness of one gemstone differs from that of the other. On the hardness scale, talc represents the softest substance while diamond is the hardest material known to mankind.\n\nFollowing is a hardness scale to compare the hardness of gemstones with one another.\n\nSequence of Hardness Material/Gems\n\n1 Talc\n\n2 Gypsum\n\n3 Calcite\n\n4 Spar\n\n5 Apatite\n\n6 Foldspar\n\n7 Rock Crystal\n\n8 Topaz (Yellow)\n\n9 ( Sapphire)\n\n10 Blue Sapphire\n\nDiamond\n\nAll the gemstones have some amount of latent electricity which can be experienced in different ways. This latent form of electricity is basically of static in nature and an be produced in three different ways:\n\n1) Friction\n\n2) Heat\n\n3) Pressure\n\n1) Electricity produced by friction or Frictional Electricity: When a gemstone is rubbed with a cotton or woolen cloth, some electric charge is produced in the gem. In some stones the charge is so intense that it can even burn the cloth that causes it to appear. Diamond is such a stone that produces intense electric charge on rubbing. Besides diamond, topaz, Shobha Mani, Trinakant Mani etc are some other jewels that produce intense electric charge.\n\n2) Thermal Electricity: Heating a gemstone also produces some electric charge in it. But there is a threshold limit below which heating does not produce any charge in the stone. Rock crystal is the prominent gemstone that produces intense charge upon heating.\n\n3) Piezo Electricity or charge due to pressure: If a certain amount of pressure is applied on a crystal, it begins to act like a battery cell and produces electric charge. With the removal of pressure, the crystal regains its original state. Rock crystal is again an efficient gemstone to produce electric charge under pressure.\n\nAlexandrite: It is an extremely beautiful gem and like Opal it is also very sensitive to light. It glows like a rainbow of colours. Hence it is also known as colour changing stone. It is found in Sri Lanka and Africa. Mostly, Alexandrites with deep indigo colour are available with the jewellers. It is regarded as a potential substitute for blue sapphire.\n\nKatiala: It belongs to crystal category and is found in deep and light voilet colours. In common parlance and the jewellers terms it is called as Jamuniya (amethyst). It is used as a substitute for blue sapphire. It is mostly found in Hampshire (England), Germany, Iran, Balkan countries, Madagascar, Mexico and some parts of India. It also changes its colour when heated in fire.\n\nKaharava: It is mostly found in brown colour. It is opaque like amber. Kaharava is also a fossilized resin of pine that has metamorphosed into stone. It may be found in many colours like yellow, blue, white, red and green. It has a sweet, camphor-like smell. Due to its property to attract grass, paper etc. when charged, Kaharava is also known as Trinakant Mani or Trinakarsh. It is mostly found in Thailand, Romania, Myanmar, Brazil and some parts of India. Madagascar and Peru are the regions where Kaharava is found aplenty. But it has more medicinal uses than astrological.\n\nKasoti (Touch stone): Jewellers use this stone to test the purity of gold. It is mostly used in making crockery, utensils and mortar etc.\n\nCalamine: Some crafty jewellers sell it as a substitute for blue sapphire but in fact it cannot replace blue sapphire. It is known as black star and presents a complete rainbow of colours in flood light.\n\nKurund: This stone is found in many colours like violet, brown, blue, white, green, red, black and pink. It is mostly used to make the grinding stone that the jewellers use to scourge gemstones. It is mostly found in Thailand, lower regions of Russia, Myanmar, Srilanka, Canada, Australia and India.\n\nKakarnili: Due to its deep blue colour, many astrologers prescribe it as a substitute for blue sapphire. It is indeed effective but not as much as blue sapphire. But there is no guarantee that you get genuine Kakarnili in the market because most jewellers sell synthetic stone instead. Kakarnili is mostly found in Kashmir.\n\nKudaratta: It is black stone that has mote decorative uses than astrological ones. It is cheaper and appears attractive due to yellow-black spots on it.\n\nKhara: It is an ordinary stone available in black colour. It radiates green light. It is also mostly used in medicines.\n\nAgate: It belongs to the Navaratna category of the gemstones. It is mostly used to please the shadow planet Rahu. It is known as Gomed in Hindi, Gomed Mani, Gomedak, Tapo Mani, Peet Mani, Peet Sphatic in Sanskrit. In Arabian and Persian it is known as Zargun, Hazarya Mani, Siduri etc. In Marathi it is known as ‘Gomed Mani’. In colloquial terms, it is called zircon, but it is a misnomer. Even in common English its often referred to as Zircon. But the correct term for it is Hassonite or Agate.\n\nA transparent Agate is regarded as the best. But it is available in many colours: black, reddish brown, red, orange and occasionally green. Despite being cheap, it is an extremely effective gemstone. It is found in the Orissa province of India besides Myanmar, China, Arab, Florida, South Africa and Sri Lanka. Best Agates come from Sri Lanka. Agate is prescribed by the astrologers for the people to get rid of many kinds of problems. It has profound effect on the diseases also. But one should imperatively get his horoscope scrutinized by an able astrologer.\n\nMoonstone: It is an inexpensive stone. It resembles with the teeth of a cow in appearance. It is prescribed as a substitute for pearl. It is found in small bits in Myanmar, India, North America and Sri Lanka. It is also found in Brazil and Switzerland.\n\nGauri: It is brown or green coloured stone that belongs to Akeek category. Streaks of many colours are present on it. Hence it is also known as rainbow stone. It gives mental peace besides riches and repute. It can be worn on any auspicious day.\n\nTiger’s Eye: It is a yellow stone that closely resembles the eye of a tiger. It is also known as cat’s eye and proves specially beneficial for the fearful people.\n\nMagnet: This term conjures up a figure of metallic magnet. But here we are talking about a stone and not about a metal. The stone does have some magnetic properties and is beneficial in correcting bodily disorders caused by wind. It is said that this stone is particularly present in huge quantities in certain regions like Bermuda Triangle and causes Shipwrecks and plane accidents there.\n\nJaje Mani: The same stone is called as Yaje Mani. It is actually an Akeek with prominent streaks. Its surface is commonly brown, yellow or white, black or brown streaks. It is mostly found on the banks of Narmada and Indus. It has miraculous virtues.\n\nJahar Mohara (Soap stone): This yellow coloured stone has green radiance. It is mostly used to make utensils. It is a strange kind of stone that destroys the effects of poison. It is found in Tibet, India and Iran.\n\nJarahat (Milk stone): It is an ordinary stone not commonly used for astrological purposes. It is mostly used in cosmetics and to make utensils and idols. It has a peculiar smoothness. Many experts do not regard it as a true gemstone.\n\nPeridot: This parrot-green coloured stone is prescribed as a substitute for emerald. It is found in Norway, Arizona (USA), Mexico, Myanmar and the island of St. John.\n\nJharana (Fountain): It is a pastel coloured stone not frequently used for astrological purposes.

It is highly beneficial in the diseases of kidney and urinary bladder. Hence it is known as kidney stone.\n\nSardonyx: This brown stone appears to have a dual structure. It has white or brown streaks on the surface.\n\nSmoky Quartz: This transparent stone is mostly available in smoky colours besides black, yellow and brown. It is mostly found in Switzerland and North Carolina (USA) and is mostly used in making idols, toys and goggles.\n\nSpinel Ruby: This stone is mostly found in pink colour though shades like green, yellow, orange, blue and violet are also common. It is used as a substitute for ruby. It is found in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Brazil, USA and India.\n\nBlue Sapphire: This highly famous stone is composed of aluminum oxide. It is regarded as the most respected as well as the most dangerous stone. Its positive as well as negative effects are manifested from within hours to days. Though found in many countries like USA, Java, Thailand, Australia, Sri Lanka etc. but the sapphire found in Kashmir province of India is the most beautiful and expensive. Sapphire is often compared with notorious anti-biotic penicillin because of its accelerated effects. In Sanskrit it is known as Neel Mani, Indraneel Mani, in Urdu it is known as Yakoob, Kabood. Blue Sapphire is one of the Navratna.\n\nEmerald: This green coloured stone is used to please mercury. It is bright, transparent stone with brilliant green colour and is very expensive. The best grade of emerald comes from South American countries, Columbia and Brazil.\n\nPanghat: This translucent stone is found in white, black and green colours. It appears to contain water inside it and hence looks very attractive. It is mostly used in making ornaments and toys.\n\nBlood stone: This opaque, green stone has a number of small red dots on it hence its named as blood stone. It is found in India and Siberian region of Russia.\n\nSang-e-panni: This green coloured stone is a potential substitute for emerald. It is available both in transparent and opaque forms and is used in making utensils also.\n\nPukhraj (Topaz or Yellow Sapphire): This rare, beautiful and expensive jewel is one of the Navratna.

Hence, describing its physical properties is very difficult job. It is a common belief that any metal can be turned into gold by a mere touch of philosopher’s stone.\n\nSince the beginning of civilization, gemstones have always been thought to possess metaphysical powers. All the main ancient cultures, Vedic Aryan, Egyptian, Mayan, and Greek, had used these colorful and shiny pebbles for ritualistic, sacramental and healing purposes. The idea of using gemstones as solely item of adornment and wealth was a later development; yet, even this shift of perception, had originally an occult reason behind it.\n\nGems seems to have a special power, a transcendental quality that go beyond their colorful mirror, the thought of far away lands and mysterious places.\n\nIn ancient India, a number of Sanskrit texts on gems have been written.\n\nOf a purely scientific, gemological knowledge are works like “Ratnapariksa” (literally ‘Gemology’), and “Mani-Mala”. More specifically, the “Graha-Gocara Jyautisha”, the “Garuda Purana”, the “Brhat Samhita”, the “Agni Purana” are the texts dealing with planetary gemology.\n\nAs we already know, according to Vedic astrology, nine main gemstones are associated with nine planets. Associated with the sun is the RUBY, with the moon is the PEARL, with mars is the RED CORAL, with mercury is the EMERALD, with Jupiter is the YELLOW SAPPHIRE, with Venus is the DIAMOND, with Saturn is the BLUE SAPPHIRE, with Rahu is the HESSONITE GARNET, and with Ketu is the CAT’S EYE CHRYSOBERYL.\n\nIt is clearly stated in many passages of the different Vedic texts that “inward luster, transparency, illumination with rays, sparkle, free from impurities and good formation of the shape are the characteristics of good gems” (Agni Purana, 246.13-14).\n\n“Gems are not good if they are sandy, cracked within, scratched, stained, if they are lusterless, rough, dull or mixed with mineral substances even though they may have all the characteristic features of their family” (Garuda Purana, 70.18).\n\n“Since a jewel (gem) endowed with good characteristics ensure good luck, prosperity and success to kings, and one with bad ones, disaster and misfortune, connoisseurs ought to examine their fortune depending on jewels (gems)” (Brhat Samhita, 80.1-3).\n\n“If anyone wears a gem of many flaws out of ignorance, then grief, anxiety, sickness, death, loss of wealth and other evils will torment him” (Garuda Purana, 70.19).\n\nA special attention needs to be addressed to the always-included emeralds. References from the Sanskrit texts claim that emerald inclusions are accepted, as far as the inclusions are not detracting from the overall transparency and beauty of the gem.\n\n“Experts in gems are inclined to say that the following types of emeralds are of good potency: Emerald that has dark green color or the color of a spring meadow, a soft glow, that is not highly complicated (referring to inclusions), hewn in different ways and appear to be stuffed with gold dust (still referring to very small inclusions); emerald that is endowed with qualities of shape, even shade all over, sufficient heaviness and shoots diffusion of light when sun’s rays fall on it” (Garuda Purana, 71.12-15)\n\nTo summarize, a planetary Jyotish gem should possess an eye flawless clarity, appealing color, good cutting, and a sweet feeling or “life” that will undoubtedly be felt by the person choosing that particular gem. As a general rule, it is advisable that the gem be of the finest quality affordable, and…the larger the better.\n\nThe use of alternative gemstones is practiced as well, especially for those gems which can be expensive over two carats sizes, such as diamonds and rubies. It is found, however that the alternative gem has a milder effect than the correspondent main gem. See in the table below the alternative gems, metals, and fingers used to wear rings related to the main gem and the correspondent planet.\n\nPlanet\n\nMetal\n\nFinger\n\nMain Gem\n\nAlternatives\n\nSUN\n\nGold\n\nRing\n\nRUBY\n\nRhodolite, red tourmaline, red spinel\n\nMOON\n\nSilver\n\nRing\n\nPEARL\n\nMoonstone\n\nJUPITER\n\nGold\n\nIndex\n\nYELLOW SAPPHIRE\n\nTopaz, Heliodor, citrine\n\nMARS\n\nGold\n\nRing\n\nRED CORAL\n\nCarnelian\n\nRAHU\n\nWhite gold\n\nMiddle\n\nHESSONITE\n\nOrange zircon\n\nMERCURY\n\nGold\n\nPinkie\n\nEMERALD\n\nTourmaline, peridot, chrysophrase, jade\n\nVENUS\n\nGold\n\nMiddle\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWhite sapphire, damburite, white zircon\n\nSATURN\n\nWhite/yellow Gold\n\nMiddle\n\nBLUE SAPPHIRE\n\nAmethyst, blue spinel, iolite\n\nKETU\n\nWhite Gold\n\nMiddle\n\nCAT’S EYE\n\nOpal or tourmaline cat’s eye\n\nGEMOPATHY: TREATMENT OF DISEASES WITH THE HELP OF THE GEMS\n\nAlmost all the gems have some kind of medicinal properties. But the jewels that belong to Navratna category are famous for their medicinal properties as well besides their divine virtues.\n\nTreatment of a particular disease with the help of a gemstone is known as Gemopathy. It is very wide subject.

But the jewels that belong to Navratna category are famous for their medicinal properties as well besides their divine virtues.\n\nTreatment of a particular disease with the help of a gemstone is known as Gemopathy. It is very wide subject. Following is a brief description of the medicinal values of the jewels that belong to the Navratna category.\n\nWith the development of science, gemstones have been subjected to detailed scientific scrutiny and their chemical composition has been revealed. Following is a brief discussion of chemical composition of the jewels that belong to Navratna category.\n\n1) Ruby: This is the stone of the sun and hence has a supreme position among the Navrartnas. The sun is the centre of the solar system. Ruby is an extremely expensive and rare stone. It has a hardness of 9 and a refractive index of 1.716 to 1.77 and a specific density of 4.03. Aluminum oxide (AlO) is the main constituent of ruby. Pink colour of the ruby is due to the presence of chromium oxide (CrO).\n\nRuby is next to diamond only in hardness. Sometimes it surpasses even diamond in beauty and value. All types of rubies appear similar superficially but a deep scrutiny reveals many distinct differences among them. These are as follows-\n\n1) Kuruvind Manikya.\n\n2) Neelgandh Manikya.\n\n3) Padma Manikya.\n\n4) Jamuni Manikya.\n\n5) Saugandhik Manikya.\n\nPearl: This gem of the moon is at the second position among Navratnas. It is both natural as well as cultured. Both kinds of pearls impart mental peace in the wearer. Pearl is basically not a stone. It has organic origin and develops inside the sea-shells.\n\nCultured pearls are produced by artificially inseminating the shells. This method has been perfected in Japan. Chemically, pearl has calcium carbonate and an organic compound named conchiolin. It has a hardness of 3.5 to 4.0 and a specific density of 2.50 to 2.75. It is opaque and cannot be burnt. Excellent pearls come from the Persian gulf. Following are the kinds of pearl-\n\n1) Shankmukta (Conch Pearl)\n\n2) Gajamukta (Elephant Pearl)\n\n3) Shukarmukta (Boar Pearl)\n\n4) Sarpamukta (Snake Pearl)\n\n5) Abhramukta (Mica Pearl)\n\n6) Meenmukta (Fish Pearl)\n\n7) Bansamukta (Bamboo Pearl)\n\nAs per the qualities pearl has following types-\n\n1) Dhanmukta.\n\n2) Snigdhmukta.\n\n3) Asphutitmukta.\n\n4) Suvritmukta.\n\n5) Sutarmukta.\n\n6) Nirmalmukta.\n\n7) Succhmukta.\n\n8) Sudhamukta.\n\nCoral: Like pearl, Coral also is not a true stone. In fact it is fossilized from a tiny sea creature known as corals. Coral is worn to please the Mars. Heat and light of the sun play a major role in the formation of coral. Its specific density is 2.65; refractive index 1.486 to 1.66 and hardness is 4.0. Coral reacts with hydrochloric acid to form froth. When touched by a hot wire coral smells like burning hair. Coral has following types-\n\n1) Brahmin coral.\n\n2) Kshatriya coral.\n\n3) Vaishya coral.\n\n4) Shudra coral.\n\nEmerald: This green coloured stone is also a prominent jewel among the Navratnas. It is worn to please Mercury. It has a specific density of about 3.0; hardness 8.0 and refractive index of 1.6. Emerald is usually transparent in appearance and is composed of aluminium and berilium silicate. Some people incorrectly call it as aquamarine. Often emerald is more expensive than diamond. As per the appearance, colour, clarity and radiance, emerald has following types-\n\n1) Brahmin emerald.\n\n2) Kshatriya emerald.\n\n3) Vaishya emerald.\n\n4) Shudra emerald.\n\nYellow Sapphire (Topaz): This yellow coloured transparent jewel is the main stone of Jupiter. It is extremely expensive, rare and enchanting gem. Some experts regard yellow sapphire as a crystalline mineral. Chemically it is aluminum fluorosilicate. It has the hardness of 8; refractive index 1.63 and specific density of 3.5 to 3.6.\n\nDiamond: It is regarded as the ‘king of the gems’. This white coloured transparent and radiant stone is worn to please Venus. Chemically, diamond is a crystalline isotrophe of carbon and with a hardness of 10, it is the hardest known substance on earth. It has a specific density of 3.15 to 3.55 and a refractive index of 2.5. Diamond has following types as per the colour-\n\nBrahmin diamond.\n\nKshatriya diamond.\n\nVaishya diamond.\n\nShudra diamond.\n\nApart from these, on the basis of clarity, diamond has following types-\n\n1) Polluted diamond.\n\n2) Crow-foot diamond.\n\n3) Dotted diamond.\n\n4) Blemished diamond.\n\n5) Grained diamond.\n\n6) Streaked diamond.\n\n7) Cursed diamond.\n\nThere are many evidences in the history that show the profound creative as well as destructive qualities of the diamond. Many diamonds like Kohinoor, Calinen, King Orloff are very famous in human history.\n\nBlue Sapphire: It is the most talked about gem that belongs to Navratna category. This beautiful attractive and transparent gem is the main stone of Saturn and has tremendous powers. Basically, sapphire, topaz and ruby belong to same class of stones. A slight variation in colour differentiates them from one another. Aluminum oxide is the main constituent of blue sapphire. In hardness, specific density and refractive index sapphire is similar to topaz and ruby.\n\nAgate (Hassonite): This stone also belongs to Navratna category and is available in black, light brown and amber colours.\n\nCat’s eye: This opaque but miraculous stone also belongs to Navratna category. It is available in many colours like white, sky blue, black and green. Green cat’s eye is the most expensive. It is worn to please Ketu.\n\nSCIENTIFIC BASIS OF WEARING GEMSTONES\n\nQuestions related to importance of gemstones and their effects on the well being of the wearers have always stirred the thoughts of human beings. Does the wearing of gemstones have any scientific basis or is it mere superstition?\n\nThe answer is simple as that ” All the energy present in the the world comes from one source that is our Sun Surya this same energy is found in different forms mainly distributed in five elements, nine planets, etc\n\nA specific gemstone absorbs the energy fom the sun as battery and transform the energy to a dif forms of energy depending on their respective planets .the Metal of the ring or chain acts like electric connection between the specfic points in the hands or the body.\n\nthe part of energy of the respective planets which is needed by the person is thus regained by the help of the Gem stone.\n\nGemmology is an important part of astrology and it has never been mentioned in it that one, who wants good fortune, should give up his efforts and come to depend upon the fortune entirely. In fact, both fate and action are two sides of the same coin and have their own importance. Neither of them is complete alone. Only working together action and fate can give synergic results.\n\nHOW DO THE GEMSTONES EXERT THEIR EFFECTS?\n\nWe have so far clarified that every gemstone has some kind of miraculous powers which is often referred to as divine powers. According to its colour, every gem represents a planet of the matching colour. As for example, Venus has white colour hence it is represented by diamond. Red or pink ruby similarly represents the sun and yellow sapphire represents Jupiter.\n\nEvery gemstone has the power to draw energy or beams from its respective planet and channelise it into the wearer’s body. This property of a gemstone is helpful in exerting its influence in miraculous ways.\n\nEach gem of the Navratna category represents a planet of the solar system. When we wish to enjoy the favourable effects of a particular planet, we wear the stone representing that planet on our fingers, neck or arm. It is also important here to know that stone of a particular planet must be worn on the finger that represents it. In astrology, every finger is believed to represent a particular planet viz. Thumb represents Venus, index finger represents Jupiter, middle finger represents Saturn, ring finger represents the sun and little finger represents Mercury.\n\nSuppose a particular planet is not strong enough in the horoscope of a person and a person was hence suggested to wear the stone that represents that planet. The stone draws positive energy from the planet and channelises it into the body of the wearer. The planet, since then, begins to bestow its good effect on the person who then climbs the ladder of success quickly, reaps great benefits and enjoys good food. Now even if the person doesn’t make fervent efforts, the luck still gives him strong support.\n\nEffects of the stones can be compared with the way modern medicine employs to remove the deficiency of vitamins in body. As for example green vegetables are prescribed to remove the deficiency of vitamin A and iron and basking is suggested to correct the disturbances in the level of vitamin D. Similarly stones are suggested to remove the deficiencies in the influence of particular planet.\n\nPeople blinded by the dazzles of modernity do not reject the prescription of modern medicine. In fact they cannot do so. Thus, they have no moral right to reject the science that had helped since millenia, millions of people to live a healthy life and reap good fortune\n\nThere are many more reasons behind the gemstones being effective to channelise the influence of a particular planet. Each of the nine planets represents many fields of activity, things and human conditions\n\nLet us see now which planet governs which of the fields-\n\nZODIAC SIGN LORD FIELDS CONTROLLED BY LORD PLANET\n\nLEO LORD Right eye, nervous system, heart diseases,Medicines, prestige, technology.\n\nCancer Moon Mind, water, cough, arts, silver, romance,`Water-borne diseases, feminity, left eye.\n\nAries/Scorpio Mars Blood, blood disorders, firework, army,land, credit, anger, copper, bile.\n\nGemini/Virgo Mercury Neuterity, singing, mathematics, Accounts, share market, brokerage,Bronze, disorders related to voice.\n\nSagittarius/Pisces Jupiter Son, spirituality, gold, politics, study of Vedas, teaching, writing, jaundice.\n\nTaurus/Libra Venus Cotton, luxury, silver/platinum, poetry,Acting, dancing, venereal diseases and Physical strength.\n\nCapricorn/ Aquarius Iron, indifferences, pettiness, technology, wind-borne diseases, service, forgery.\n\nRahu Gambling, smuggling, Arabian countries,Drinking of wine, abdominal diseases,Anal disorders.\n\nKetu Skin diseases, mica, ghosts, poltergeists,impracticality.\n\nThe specific studies on this matter has shown that the cosmic color spectrums emanated by the different planets, are very similar to the color spectrums of the correspondent gems.\n\nThe cosmic energy of the planet is reflected on the human body through the gem and creates an effect by absorption and reflection of the rays and vibrations.\n\nThe gem acts as a filter and produces good or evil effect, depending on the need of the body.\n\nLike the crystals used in radio technology are the fundamental constituents of transmitting, receiving and transforming invisible energy into sound, thus the crystalline structure of gemstones attract and condense the cosmic, planetary energies that rain from sky to earth and transform them for use by the human physiology.\n\nBy keeping the proper gemstones in touch with the body, profound and significant changes can take place overtime.\n\nTo conclude, now more than any other period in history, where the knowledge and technology of natural gemstones has reached a peak, a divine science is again made available to anyone to fulfill mankind’s dream of life free from problems and negativity. Natural, very effective and magnificent gemstones that demand no will power or effort whatsoever, are available now to transform our lives radically.\n\nSCIENTIFIC BASIS OF WEARING GEMSTONES\n\nIN WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES GEMSTONE SHOULD NOT BE WORN\n\nWhen your astrologer forbids you from wearing a stone, you should follow his advice by all means. Secondly, if you are not having full faith in the gems and their powers, you should not go for them. This point is more psychological than astrological. We are all aware of the positive and negative thoughts and their consequences. Any of these two types of thoughts, when developed beyond a certain limit, comes to dominate the life of a person. If a person has more negative thoughts, his whole outlook for life becomes highly pessimistic. Such a condition is recognised as a mental disorder described as ‘inferiority complex’. Similarly, if your whole thinking about the gemstones and their influence is negative and still you decide to wear the gemstone, the probability is that it will manifest more negative influences than positive. It is therefore highly imperative to cultivate positive attitude for the gemstones before deciding to wear one.\n\nDWIJW, TIRTHE, MANTRE, AUSHADHE, BHESHAJE GURAU | YADRISHI BHAWANA YASYA TADRISHI PHALAM LABHET ||\n\nThat means, pilgrimage, Brahmin, mantra, gemstones, medicines and teacher give the same result as one has feelings about them.\n\nNo matter how beautiful and attractive it might appear. Besides, if a particular gemstone is specially forbidden for you, you should not wear it in any circumstance because such a gemstone may prove lethal for you. This fact particularly applies to diamond and blue sapphire. These two stones are particularly notorious for ruining the life of even a person of kingly status.\n\nDIFFERENT BASIS OF WEARING GEMSTONE\n\nThree questions are naturally linked with everything we do : Why? When? And How? These questions also arise in the case of gemstones. We have already discussed about the first two questions. Let us now consider the third question How? How should a gemstone be worn?\n\nThere is no single basis for wearing a gemstone. According to their experience and knowledge, experts express different opinions regarding wearing of stones. In different communities, there are different religious reasons for wearing the stones. Our learned sages and savants have proposed different provisions to wear a particular gemstone. Many of these provisions are universally accepted and there is no difference of opinion about them. Astrologers and experts from ancient as well as modern ages seem to have similar opinions about these provisions.\n\nWEARING OF A STONE AS PER THE ASCENDANT HOUSE\n\nDeep scrutiny of your horoscope may reveal more than one reason why you should wear a gemstone. But the most important and fool-proof reason is the position of ascendant house in your horoscope and position of its ruling planet. If the ruling planet of the ascendant house is in a weak position, the whole horoscope can be safely designated as weak. In such a horoscope, other planets too cannot show their full influence no matter how powerful they are.\n\nThe most important logic behind this provision is that, the ascendant house is the most important factor in one’s horoscope. It actually represents the soul of the person in question. Its position is akin to that of heart. If the heart is weak, the whole body suffers from many kinds of ailments and other parts appear quite helpless.\n\nIf the ascendant house is weak in a horoscope, wearing of gemstones are related to planets other than the ruler of the ascendant house proves fruitless. All the experts therefore unanimously opine in favour of a strong ascendant house even if reaping of benefits from other well placed planets is desirable. Almost all the astrologers therefore suggest to wear the stone that is related to the ruling planet of the ascendant house. Let us see now which gem is related to which of the ascendant houses. In a horoscope, there are twelve houses that represent all the twelve zodiac signs. In the horoscope given here, fifth house is ascendant. It represents the zodiac sign Leo. In other words, in the given horoscope, Leo is the ascendant house. Sun is the lord of this house. We have already discussed that ruby is the stone for the Sun. Hence, the person who has Leo as his ascendant house in his horoscope must wear ruby.\n\nSimilarly, people with ascendant house Aries should wear coral, those with ascendant house Taurus should wear diamond, those with Gemini must wear emerald, those with Cancer must wear pearl, those with Leo should wear ruby, those with Virgo should wear emerald, those with Libra must wear diamond, those with Scorpio must wear coral, those with Sagittarius must wear topaz, those with Capricorn and Aquarius must wear blue sapphire and people with ascendant house Pisces must wear topaz.\n\nAscendant house Aries: Mars is the ruling planet of this house. It will be beneficial for the people with Aries as the ascendant house to wear coral but such people may also wear ruby, pearl or topaz and reap rich benefits. Such people may also go for the following combinations of the gemstones: coral, pearl and ruby; coral, ruby and topaz or coral, topaz and pearl. These combinations prove extremely beneficial for such people.\n\nAscendant house Taurus: Venus is the ruling planet of this house. It will be beneficial for the people with Taurus as their ascendant house to wear diamond. But such people may also wear blue sapphire for Saturn and emerald for Mercury. They may also go for the various combinations of these gemstones.\n\nAscendant house Gemini: Mercury is the ruling planet of this house. Hence the people who have Gemini as the ascendant house must wear emerald. They may also wear diamond or both of the gems together.\n\nAscendant house Cancer: Moon is the lord of this house. Hence the people with Cancer as the ascendant house must wear pearl. They may also wear coral. In the opinion of some experts, such people may also wear ruby and topaz.\n\nAscendant house Leo: Sun is the lord of this house. Hence, the people with Leo as the ascendant house must wear ruby. Besides it, they may also wear coral, pearl and topaz as well either alone or in combination. However, among these stones, coral will yield highest benefit while pearl and topaz may exert somewhat weaker influence.\n\nAscendant house Virgo: Mercury is the ruling planet of this house. Hence the people with Virgo as ascendant house must wear emerald. Some experts however believe that such people may also be benefited from pearl.\n\nAscendant house Libra: Venus is the ruling planet of this house. Hence the people with Libra as the ascendant house must wear diamond. Apart from it, they may also wear and reap benefits from blue sapphire and emerald.\n\nAscendant house Scorpio: Mars is the ruling planet of this house. Hence the people with Scorpio as the ascendant house must wear coral. They may also wear ruby, pearl and topaz.\n\nAscendant house Sagittarius: Jupiter is the ruling planet of this house. Hence the people with Sagittarius as the ascendant house must wear topaz.
