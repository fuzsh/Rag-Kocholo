        "text": "An actor for all seasons. An actor family audiences love to love. An actor who refuses to be called a star hero. An versatile talent who is the choice of a range of directors. A performer whom awards follow. A learner who never goes out of fashion. An excellence whom success follows. A seeker who could have become a renunciant. He is Venkatesh, fondly called as Venky by one and all.\n\nOn Venky's birthday, IndiaGlitz chronicles the illustrious career of one of the most long-standing actors in the history of Telugu cinema. As this is his 30th year in cinema, let the tribute be rich!\n\nKing of class, he gets mass too right\n\nFrom mass-oriented films to so-called class-oriented ones, he has done them all. From playing a new-age lover boy to a family man to boot, he has played them all.\n\nTake a look at the range of choices. Kaliyuga Pandavulu, Srinivasa Kalyanam, Swarna Kamalam, Prema, Bobbili Raja, Shatruvu, CoolieNo.1, Chanti, Sundarakanda, Kondapalli Raja, Abbaigaru, Dharma Chakram, Sahasa Veerudu Sagara Kanya, Intlo Illalu Vantintlo Priyuralu, Pavitra Bandham, Preminchukundam Raa, Pellichesukundam, Suryavamsam, Ganesh, Premante Idera, Raja,Kalisundam Raa, Jayam Manade Raa, Nuvvu Naaku Nachav, Vasu, Malliswari, Gharshana, Sankranthi, Lakshmi, Adavari Matalaku Ardhale Verule, Tulasi, Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu, Drushyam, Gopala Gopala. The list is long and envious.\n\nThe eclectic quality of the range of movies says it all. For a wide array of genres, Venky fits the bill. His choices are bold.\n\nAwards embrace him\n\nFor an actor not exactly known for serious kinda roles as far as the new Millennium cinegoers are concerned, especially since the days of Kalisundam Raa, it's instructive that through the '80s and '90s, he ha excelled in many an intense role.\n\nThe fact that some of the prestigious awards he won were for non-playful roles says it all. He won the Nandi (Special Jury award category included) for Kaliyuga Pandavulu, Prema, Dharma Chakram, Kalisundam Raa, Swarna Kamalam, Ganesh, and Adavari Matalaku Ardhale Verule. Definitely, the roles he played in these films are distinct from one another.\n\nAs for the Filmfare awards, he had it for films as diverse as Brahma Putrudu, Dharma Chakram, Ganesh, Jayam Manade Raa, Sankranthi, and Adavari Matalaku Ardhale Verule.\n\nWhether or not he won an award, his capacity to show variation in emotions in films like Kshana Kshanam, Raja (an underrated act), Seenu, and Nuvvu Naku Nacchav is hailed by all.\n\nA spiritual seeker for many years\n\nA devotee of Ramana Maharshi, Venky has admittedly found peace in the middle path after toying with the idea of renouncing everything and taking to 'sanyas'. ÂUltimately itÂs a business, but I didnÂt get into films for stardom. For years I struggled, unable to cope with stardom. I am happy for the love and recognition, but at one point I wanted to run away and become a sanyasi. I am now happy in the middle path Â at peace with work, family and finding my inner voiceÂ, the actor was once quoted by a national daily as saying.\n\nA seeker in his own right, Venky has maintained a healthy detached attachment."
