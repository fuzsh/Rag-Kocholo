        "meta_description": "Fundamental Hindu Concepts - Free download as PDF File (.pdf), Text File (.txt) or read online for free. Hinduism is a diverse set of beliefs that center around concepts like dharma, karma, samsara, and moksha. The goal for most Hindus is to achieve moksha, or liberation from the cycle of repeated birth and death through union with Brahman. Hindu theology holds that the eternal soul or atman is distinct from the temporary physical body and is entrapped by maya, or illusion. By following dharma and adhering to scriptures, one can overcome ignorance and purify the mind to achieve moksha. The document provides an overview of some key Hindu concepts and explains parallels between the human body and the universe.",
