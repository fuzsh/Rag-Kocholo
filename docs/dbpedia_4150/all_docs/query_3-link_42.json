Swamy Desikan defeated all his challengers and firmly established the Supermacy of VisishtAdhvaitham over 15 other SiddhAnthams . Lord DevanAthan was very pleased at the accomplishment of His dear devotee and blessed him profusely . The avathAram of Para Matha Bhngam ****************************** After this historic debate , Swamy Desikan composed the major MaNipravALa SrI Sookthi named \"PARA MATHA BHANGAM \" to summarize the content of his debate with the people of Para Mathams ( other SiddhAnthams) . There are 24 chapters in that SrI Sookthi/Rahasyam . Swamy Desikan took the first and the last paasurams of these 24 chapters that were in chaste TamiL and strung them together as a garland along with 6 more special Paasurams to create the FOURTH Desika Prabhandham with the same name of \"PARA MATHA BHANGAM \" . There are thus 54 Tamil Paasurams in this Fourth Desika Prabhandham . The Original SrI Sookthi in MaNipravALam *********************************** The original MaNipravALa Version of \"Para Matha Bhangam \" is an intellectual achievement of the highest magnitude. Abhinava Desikan , Vaikunta Vaasi , SrI UttamUr Swamy has blessed us with a commentary for this MaNipravALa version entitled \"AnapAya PrabhA \". It has 1168 pages of commentary . Erudition to grasp the fine points of this grantham is beyond the capabilities of many of us . Only a very few AchAryAs can help us understand atleast a small portion of this extraordinary creation of Swamy Desikan. The SrI Sookthis of Swamy Desikan such as Tatthva Muktha KalApam , Satha DhUshaNi , SarvArTa Siddhi , MeemAmsa PadhukA , The Five RakshA granthams have material related to Para Matha Bhangam. It will take many lives and SadAchArya KatAksham to get even a glimpse of the deep doctrines covered by Swamy Desikan in the original SrI Sookthi of Para Matha Bhangam . For our benefit , Swamy Desikan has assembled the 54 Tamil Paasurams of the original SrI Sookthi to realize the Fourth Desika Prabhandham named Para Matha Bhangam . That Tamil Prabhandham will be the subject of the subsequent postings for the next few days. Please bear with adiyEn's incompetence to summarize them . Swamy Desikan's Prayer to Lord DevanAthan ************************************** The original MaNipravALa Version starts with the prayer of Swamy Desikan to Lord DEvanAthan , who was waiting eagerly on the banks of PeNNai River during one of His Uthsavam to witness this debate between His intimate devotee and the challengers from the other Mathams. The prayer of Swamy Desikan to Lord DevanAthan at the beginning of this debate is : \" apaayAsthu tama: pumsAm anapAya prabhAnvitha: AhIndhranagarE nithyam udhithOayam ahaskara: \" Word by Word Meaning ******************** anapAya PrabhA anvitha : = the Lord with never leaving lustre (prabhA) of SrI HemAbhja Naayaki AhIndhra NagarE = at His dhivya dEsam of AhIndhrapuram nithyam = always udhitha: = rising ayam = this Lord , the origin of this SrI Sookthi Ahaskara: = is shining as the radiant Sun PumsAm Tama: nithyam apAsyathu = May He banish the darkness (tamas) of nescience and viparItha Jn~Anam of the chEthanams ! ( Integrated Meaning ): Lord DEvanAthan with the unique lakshaNam of His eternal Prabhai of SrI HemAbhja Naayaki . Her is always resplendent as the rising Sun. May this Lord of Thiruvaheendhrapuram chase away all the spirtual darkness of people with His matchless lustre! This prayer is linkable to the command of Manu in His Smruthi according to Sri UtthamUr Swamy : \" yaa vEda-bAhyaa: smruthayO yaasccha kaasccha kudhrushtaya: SarvasthA: nishphalA: prEthya tamOnishtA hi taa: smruthA:\" Para Mathams are born due to the influence of TamO guNam and are rooted in that guNam . The prayer to the ishta dhaivam of Swamy Desikan is to remove the Tamo GuNam of people through study of the SrI Sookthi born out of Lord DEvanAthan's grace . Paraphrasing Manu , the First Law giver , Swamy Desikan condemns the Veda BAhya and Kudhrushti Mathams as nishphalam ( fruitless) and prays to the Lord to banish the TamO GuNam that stands in the way of the ChEthanams to adopt the Vedam-prescribed UpAyam of SaraNAgathy to gain freedom from the cycles of Births and Deaths in the SamsAric world (Moksham ). The Scope of Para Matha Bhangam **************************** Swamy Desikan was a Master of all Darsanams . He was one of the greatest scholars of all times to understand the faulty assumptions and conclusions of Veda Baahya Mathams and Kudrushti Mathams . He was also a Master of the tenets of SrI VisishtAdhvaitham as developed by Rishis like VyAsa-ParAsara-Parankusa and PoorvAchAryAs like Swamy Nathamuni, EmperumAnAr and other AchAryas like NadathUr AmmAL and AathrEya RaamAnujar (His own AchAryan). Swamy Desikan used his immense scholarship to provide the logic-based critique about the deficiencies and pitfalls of 15 other Mathams(SaarvAkam , Four kinds of Bhouddha Matham , Jainam , Adhvaitham , BhAskara-Yaadhava Matham , VyAkaraNa Matham , KaNAtha Matham , Gouthama Matham , MeemAmsaka Matham , Saankhya Matham , Yoga and Paasupatha Mathams ) and established the unassailable superiority of VisishtAdhvaitha SiddhAntham . Swamy Desikan created the major MaNipravALa commentary as his critique of all the other SiddhAnthams and to establish the glories of VisishtAdhvaitha SiddhAntham over all of them . There are 24 chapters in the MaNipravALa Rahasyam known as \"Para Matha Bhangam \". These 24 chapters of Paramatha Bhangam are: 1.PrasthAvanAdhikAram ( The chapter serving as an Introduction / Preface to this Sri Sookthi ) 2. Jeeva TatthvAdhikAram (Sentient Tatthvam) 3. Achith TattvAdhikAram (insentient Tatthvam) 4. Para TatthvAdhikAram (Iswara Tatthvam) Chapters 2, 3 and 4 deal with the Tatthva Thrayams of ChEthanam , achEthanam and Iswaran . 5. SamudhAya DhOshAdhikAram This chapter deals with the defects /blemishes (dhOshams) common to all (samudhAya dhOshams) of the Para Mathams 6. LokAyadhika BhangAdhikAram /SaarvAka Matham critique 7. MadhyAmika BhangAdhikAram/ criticism of MaadhyAdhmikam 8. YogAchAra BhangAdhikAram/Criticism of YogAchAram 9. SouuthrAndhika BhangAdhikAram 10. VaibhAshika BhangAhikAram 11. Prachanna BHouddha BhangAdhikAram 12. Jaina BhangAdhikAram 13. BhAskara-Yaadhava BnagAdhikAram 14. VyAkaraNa BhangAdhikAram 15. VaisEshika BhangAdhikAram 16. Goudhama(NyAya) BhangAdhikAram 17. NirIswara MemAmsA BhangAdhikAram 18. NeerIswara Saankhya NirAkaraNAdhikAram 19. Yoga SiddhAntha BhangAdhikAram/Criticism of Yoga Matham 20. Paasupatha BhashikArAdhikAram The above 15 chapters ( 6-20 ) serve as the criticism of the specific dhOshams of each of the above 15 Para Mathams . 21. Salutation to PaancharAthra Saasthram/ Bhagavath Saasthra VirOdha BhangAdhikAram. This chapter is constructed as the defense of Paancha Raathra Aagamam and to establish that it does not belong to the category of Para Mathams . 22. ParOkthOpAya BhangAdhikAram 23. ParOktha PrayOjana BhangAdhikAram These two chapters assert that the UpAyam and Phalan / PrayOjanam advocated by the 15 Para Mathams are insubstantial, inappropriate and not lasting to gain Moksha Sukham in distinct contrast with the UpAyam and Phalan realizable with the Parama Vidhika Matham of VisishtAdhvaitham. 24. Nigamana AdhikAram Based on Tarkam , Nigamanam means conclusion in a Syllogism. Nigamana AdhikAram can also be intrepreted as that which has Vedic Sanctions. This is the concluding chapter of the illustrious SrI Sookthi of Para Matha Bhngam . Swamy Desikan ThiruvadigaLE SaraNam Daasan , Oppiliappan Koil Varadachari Sadagopan\n\nSlokas\n\nSee Commentary below\n\n1. the first three Paasurams of Para Matha Bhangam . --------------------------------------------------- The first Paasuram consists of Swamy Desikan's salutaions to Lord Sudarsanar , the embodiment of the Sankalpa Sakthi of SriMan NaarAyaNan. The second and the Third Paasurams are tributes to AchAryans for their great UpakAram to us. 154) Salutations to Sudarsana BhagavAn ********************************* vaNN taLa ambhuyatthuL ilankum aRu kOnam misai vaNN paNilam Thikiri vaLai vill vaLai-vaay Musalam tiNN kaiyil ankusam seer thihazhum Gadhai senkamalam yeNN padai yEnthi ninRAn yezhil Aazhi IRayavanE (Meaning ): Lord Sudarsanar is standing on top of a eight petaled Lotus flower housing the six cornered yanthram . He is radiant with the eight weapons in His eight hands : Conch , Chakram , Bow , Axe , Pestle , Elephant Goad , Mace , Lotus shaped weapon. Additional Comments: ***************** The soundharyam of Lord Sudarsanar is saluted as \"Yezhil Aazhi IRayavan\" . His status as the Master of the battle field is recognized by the choice of the name \"IRayavan \" ( Lord ) . The weapons are held firm in His hands (tiNN kayil ) for immediate use (prayOgam) . \" VeNN paNilam \" refers to the white hued conch. \" VaLai moonRu vill \" denotes the Saarngam bow bent at three places . Lord Sudarsanar is ready to fly in to action as indicated by His PrathyAleeDam posture with one step mounted forward . Swamy Desikan seeks the protective power of Lord Sudarsana in the context of the imminent debate with the Para MathasthAL. 155) The great help of AchAryAs ; A verse with 16 lines ******************************************** This Paasuram is set in PathinARu SeerAsiriya Chandha Viruttham . It is a majestically moving Paasuram with beautiful Chandham and has to be recited without break to enjoy the TaaLa PramAnam. : vidu neRi anji vidat-thodakkiya vithiyar adainthu thozhat-tazhaitthu yezhu vizhi aruL tanthu vilakku adi kaLai virahil iyambi vilakki vaitthanar kodu vinai yenpathanai tinatthinai koNarthal ihantha guNat-tanatthinar Kuruhayil vanthu kozhuppu adakkiya Kulapathy tantha kuRippil Vaitthanar Kadu narahu anbhu kazhaRRi maRRoru kathi peRum anpil yemmaip-porutthinar Kamalai uhantha kadal kidaikkadal karuNai uyarntha tidarkku orukkinar padu mudhal inRi vaLarttha naRRkkalai pala pala onRa yemakku uraitthanar pazha maRaiyanthi nadaikku idaic-chuvar Para Matham yenRu idittha pattharE (meaning): The Para Mathams (Veda Baahya and Kudhrushti Mathams ) were obstacles to the spreading of our timeless Matham rooted in Veda/VedAnthams. Our parama BhAgavatha AchAryAs refuted the incorrect doctrines of Para Mathams through their SrI Sookthis and one-on-one debates with the challengers from Para Matham. We went and prostrated before these AchAryAs driven by our fear of following the sinful ways (deceptively alluring Para Mathams) .Those merciful AchAryAs blessed us with affection and cast their auspicious glances on us. They instructed us about (1) the misfortunes that would result from the sins that block our pursuit of the right UpAyams (2) the need for observance of the right upAyam to gain Moksham . Those AchAryAs have the caring disposition to make sure that no sins come our way. They made us follow the way shown by Swamy NammAzhwAr , who with His sweet paasurams refuted the unsound doctrines of Para Mathams.They asked us to be aware of the deeds that will land us in Narakam and made us long for Moksham .They made us fit objects for approaching the Lord resting in the Milky Ocean .They initiated us in to many eternal vidhyAs . Many indeed are the matchless upakArams extended to us by our most merciful AchAryans . Special Notes based on SrI UtthamUr Swamy's commentary: ************************************************ Question may arise as to the appropraiteness of the Viraktha SikhAmaNis like our AchAryas to engage in acts of refutation and deflation of the Para mathams. In reality , it is the way shown by our PoorvAchAryAs. There is nothing wrong with such refutations. This refutation is not to condemn the Para Matha AchAryAs ; it is for the auspiciousness of the world and to spare one's own sishyAs from being confused and agitated . It is like removing the weeds from a planted field for the health of the crop under cultivation.In creating this KhaNDana Grantham , Swamy Desikan points out that it is not only dhUshaNam (finding fault with the premises of other Veda Baahya and Kudhrushti mathams ) but it is also Sva-paksha sTApanam ( securing the foundations of one 's own Matham : VisishtAdhvaitha SiddhAntham). Para Matha nirasanam or condemnation of the faulty doctrines of other Mathams is defended as an important duty of an AchAryan. This is the legitimate duty of a SadAchAryan : Sva Paksha sTApanam and Para Paksha Prathikshiptham . Both have to go together : Establishment of the soundness of one's doctrines as well as the logical rejection of the faulty doctrines of Para Mathams . Additional Notes on this Paasuram *************************** Para Mathams were like the blocking walls between the straight way of ancient VedAntham ( Para Matham pazha maRayanthi nadaikku idaic-chuvar). Those walls had to come down.AchAryAs broke them down so that there are no more obstructions to travel on the right royal road of VedAntham . AchAryAs are saluted here as \" Idaic-chuvar idittha Patthar \". The fortunate sishyAs were afraid to travel on the misleading routes of Para Matham and abandoned such travel ( vidu neRi anji vidat- thodakkiya vithiyar ) and prostrated before the sacred feet of their AchAryAs ( adainthu Thozha) . What did the AchAryAs do ? They cast their merciful glances on these sishyas ( aruL vizhi tanthu) and instructed them on the futile pursuit of Para Mathams for gaining Moksham and removed their doubts like a farmer will remove the weeds from the field to protect the main crop ( vilaku adi kaLai iyampi ) . They not only saved us from observance of sinful deeds but also initiated us in the performance of the UpAyam ( Bhakthi or Prapatthi yOgam ) befitting our sakthi. The AchAryAs helped us with additional things as well : (1) They positioned us to comprehend and practise the deep doctrines of our Kulapathi , Swamy NammAzhwAr ( Kulapathy tantha kuRippil vaitthanar). (2) They removed our penchant for committing sins through their SadhupadEsams (kodu vinai tavirtthanar). (3) They kindled our longing for Moksha Sukham ( maRRoru gathi peRum anbil yeMMai porutthinar). (4) They raised us to the elevated plateau , where the most merciful Lord is resting ( KaruNai tidarkku orukkinar). (5) They revealed to us many vidhyAs bequeathed to them by PoorvAchAryAs and Sages ( pala pala nall kalai uraitthanar ). Such is the grand Compassion and UpakAram of our AchAryAs ! 156) The act of AchAryAs instructing us only on the essence of Doctrines ******************************************************** pOm uraikkum poruL yaamm aRiyOm poruL aar maRayil uraikkinRa thAmE aRiyum taram udayArAm uraikkinra ivai aayntu yedutthu AaraNa nool vazhiyE nAmm uraikkum vahai nall aruL yEnthi navinRanaRE (meaning ): The Veda manthrams with their true meanings of doctrines are like the deep ocean . We can not know without the help of AchAryAs as to which Veda Manthrams are to be used and which are to be discarded . Our AchAryAs have the power to see directly , what they speak about as upadEsams. Out of their boundless mercy towards us , they have searched deeply among the Veda manthrams and picked those , which are indispensable for us and instructed us on them .As a result , we (Swamy Desikan ) embraced the path of VedAntham and are able to create this SrI Sookthi of Para Matha Bhangam . Before the AchArya UpadEsam , we were ignorant ones , who had no idea about which portions of the vast Vedam is appropriate for us and which one are not (PoruL aar maRayil pOm uraikkum poruL yaamm aRiyOm ) . The quality of our AchAryAs is such that they have the power to directly visualize what they teach us ( tAmm uraikkinrana tAmE aRiyum taram udayAr ). These glorious AchAryAs have DayA towards us and have analyzed the entire gamut of Veda Manthrams , picked among them whatever is appropriate for us ( nall aruL yEnthi , aaynthu ivai uraikkum aamm yenRu). Then they instructed us on those selected manthrams in the way in which Vedam shows ( aaraNa nool vazhiyE nAmm uraikkum vahai navinRanar). Additional Comments ****************** We do not know the Bhaava Patha arTams of the Veda Manthrams. We can not use yukthi vaadham or kutarkkam to establish which of the meanings of Veda Manthrams is lasting and which are not . AchAryAs endowed with satthva GuNam are able to distinguish Nithya ( lasting) and anithya (non-lasting ) meanings and have the vivEkam to instruct us about the true and lasting meanings of SaarIradhi Saasthrams. 2. the Four Paasurams of Para Matha Bhangam of PrasthAvanAdhikAram dealing with Jeeva and achEthana TatthvAdhikArams . -------------------------------------------------------- There are two paasurams for each of the two subjecs: ChEthanam and achEthanam . 157) Chastisement of the Para Mathams that confuse even the VivEkis ****************************************************** chitthum achitthum IRayumenat-teLivuRRu ninRa tatthvam moonRum tanittani kaattum tani maRayAl mutthi vazhikku ithu moolam yenat-tuNivArkaLayum katthi mayakkum kathakarai nAmm kadihinRanamE (Meaning): VedAntha Saasthrams define distinctly the individual Svaroopams and SvabhAvams of the three tatthvams : ChEthanam , achEthnam and Iswaran . VivEkis ( those with discriminating intellect ) clearly understand these distinctions. They also know that this understanding about the Tatthva Thrayams is the basis of gaining MOksham. We , who have been blessed with AchArya UpadEsam , condemn those prathivAdhis , who enchant even these vivEkis with their ensnaring and loud arguments . 158) Removal of doubts about the three kinds of Jeevans ******************************************** mutthin vadangaL yena Mukundhan punai moovahayAm chitthil arum suruthi .c-chevvai mARiya sinthaihaLAl patthil iraNDu meykkap-pahattum para vAdhiyar tamm katthil vizhunthu adainthaa-avazhukkuinRu kazhaRRinamE (Meaning): EmperumAn adorns the three kinds of Jevans ( Bhaddhar , Mukthar and Nithyar) as a pearl necklace on His chest . About these three kinds of Jeevans , Para Matha Vaadhis attack with their doctrines that areinconsistent with the VedAs . They argue loudly to see if they can make atleast two of their ten faulty points stick and blabber to confuse the VivEkis. We (Swamy Dsikan ) have cleared these erroneous statements of Para Matha Vaadhis in this chapter on Jeva Tatthva adhikAram. Yeka Jeeva Vadham , Aanandha Taara Tamyam in Moksham , the confusion that Isvaran is the AathmA and the other confusion about the AathmA being understood as the body are some of the befuddlements that can confuse even a VivEki. Jeevan has the eight guNams , prakruthi vilakshaNathvam and Iswara Seshathvam as the ten guNams. Yet , the Para Matha Vadhis conclude incorrectly that dEham is AathmA and Iswaran is the Jeevan . Swamy Desikan states that in the JeevAthma TatthvAdhikAram , he engaged the Para Matha Vaadhis in debate and showed that their intrepretations about the JeevAthmA and its realtionaships to achEthanam andn Iswaran are utterly false . 159) The removal of the confusion about achEthana Tatthvam ************************************************ nAkku iyalum vahai nammai aLitthavar nall aruLAl bhAkkiyam yEnthip-paran adiyAr tiRam pArtthaRppin thAkkiyar tangaL talai misai tAkkit-tanimaRai tAnn bhOkkiyam yenRatanil poy mathangaLai pOkkuvamE (Meaning): We , who had no knowledge about tatthvams ( their svaroopams and SvabhAvans) have been blessed to speak about them with confidence due to our AchArya UpadEsam and anugraham. We presented the correct description about the Jeevans in the previous chapter. In this adhikAram , we criticize those , who use aabhAsa yukthis ( disgusting arguments) to advance their incorrect doctrines about the achEthanam (BhOgyam ) enjoyed by the Jeevan ( bhOkthA). Upanishads describe the three Tathtvams as \" BhOkthA (Jeevan, the one that enjoys) , BhOgyam ( the vasthu that is being enjoyed by the BhOkthA ) and PrEritha ( Iswaran, the Commander ). Boudha-VaisEshAdhikaL' s celebration of ParamANu Vaadham , adhvaithin's view that the world is a myth , misintrepretation of Kaalam and Nithya VibhUthi are some of the points that Swamy Desikan attacks under the achEthana adhikAram. 160) Explanation of AchEthanam according to AchAryAs ******************************************** thee vajai mARRi anRu ohr tEril aaraNam paadiya Devaki seer mahanAr tiRampA aruL soodiya nAmm moovahaiyAm aRiyAt-tatthuvathtin muham aRivAr naa vahayE nadatthum nadai paartthu nadanthanamE (Meaning ): DEvaki's son , KrishNa ParamAthmA decided to uplift the Jeevans from SamsAric mire. He stood as the charioteer for Arjunan during the great war .Our Lord used Arjunan as an excuse to instruct the beings of the world on the meanings of VedAnthams through His SrI Sookthi of Geethai. We who have been blessed by th Lord explained the intrinsic nature(Svaroopams) and SvabhAvams of achEthana entities such as Prakruthi, Kaalam , Suddha Satthvam as our AchAryAs explained to us from the SrI Sookthis of Sages VyAsa , ParAsarar and the AzhwArs. 3. the two Paasurams of Para Matha Bhangam dealing with Isvara (Para ) TatthvAdhikArams . ------------------------------------------------------- This is the Fourth adhikAram of Para Matha Bhangam.The second and the third adhikArams were about he Jeevan and achEthana Tathtvams . For additional information on the three Tatthvams and ParadEvathA nirUpaNam , the bhakthAs are referred to SWamy D esikan's SrImth Rahasya Thrayam Chapters of (1) Tatthva Thraya ChinthanAdhikAram and (2) ParadEvathA PaaramArTyAdhikaram. 161) Isvara Tatthvam : Explanation according to AchAryAs ********************************************** velaip-puRam aham kANpathu pOl vEda nannERi sEr noolaip-puRam aham kANDalil nuNN aRivnRi ninReer Maalaip-peRa vazhi kAttiya Desikar VaachakamE Olaip-puRatthil yezhuthuhinROm uLL yezhuthumin (Meaning ) : Oh AaasthikAs ! It is impossible to see the inside and outside of the great ocean. Similarly , it is a difficult task to comprehend the simple and the deeper inner meanings of the SaasthrAs that describe Veda mArgam . You do not have the sharp intellect to accomplish that task.Therefore , we are writing the essence of the AchArya UpadEsams on the UpAyam for Moksham . May You inscribe this message in your mind and benefit from it ! 162) Isvaran: Explanation to remove confusions ************************************* siRai nilayAm bhavatthil siRu tEn inbham uNDu uzhlvAr maRai nilai kaNDu aRiyA mayal mARRiya mann aruLAl thuRai nilai pAram yenat-tuLangA amuthak-kadalAm iRai nilai yAmm uraitthOm yemm gurukkaL iyambinavE This SamsAric life is like the life in prison. The happiness (Sukham ) that one experiences in this SamsAric life is like an insignificant drop of honey that is tasted in between all the sufferings . The chEthanams deeply comitted to SamsAram think of this trivial sukham as great and are enveloped in ajn~Anam that prevents them from engaging in the learning of the meanings of VedAntham (VaakyArTams and TaathparyArTams. Sath SampradhAyam isessential for the understanding of these VedArTams .Our AchAryAs are powerful to destroy our ajn~Anam with their DayA for us through their merciful upadEsams on our Sath SampradhAyam .Our AchAryAs reveal Isvaran as (1) the descending steps (ThuRai) for the ocean of Bliss (2) as our enduring home (3) as the other bank of the ocean of SamsAram and (4) as the tranquil ocean of nectar . Following our AchAryan's upadEsams , we (Swamy Desikan ) reveal the Svaroopam and SvabhAvam of Iswaran . Special Notes about the Fourth AdhikAram ( Para Tatthva adhikAram) ****************************************************** We will follow the commentary of UtthamUr Swamy now . The second and the third adhikArams were about Jeevan (BhOkthA) and AchEthana (BhOgyam ) Tathvams. The fourth adhikAram is about Iswaran (PrErithA ) and His Svaroopam as well as SvabhAvam according to VisishtAdhvaitha SiddhAntham. PrErithA means one who commands (niyamikkiRavan/yEvuhiravan). He is the One who orders the chEthanams as their indweller. He is Omniscient (Sarvajn~an) .He can only be seen through SaasthrAs ( Saasthraika vEdhyan). He (Vaikunta NaaTan) can not be seen with one 's own physical eyes on this earth. Our inability to see Him and enjoy His physical form , guNams and Iswaryams here is known as anulabdhi. It can be overcome by the knowledge about His SaasthrAs that reveal His presence here. He can be seen & enjoyed only in His archA roopam on this earth by us until we reach SrI Vaikuntam by practising one of the two MokshOpAyams. The Creation , protection and destruction of the universe and its beings is carried out by this Iswaran . He is UpAdhAna and Nimittha KaaraNan.Thus , He is Sarva Sakthan with SarIrAthma Sambhandham and as One Brahman carries out the Srushti, STithi and PraLayam .He becomes the UpAsyan ( the One to be meditated upon ) for Mumukshus ( those who desire MOksham). Iswaran is avAptha Samastha Kaaman ( one who has gained all fruits/phalans and needs nothing ).Therefore He has no PrayOjanApEkshai ( want for any gain ). In this Para Tatthva adhikAram (Para Tatthva NirNaya adhikAram ), Swamy Desikan proves the invalidity of the assumptions of Para Mathams about Iswara Tathvam and instructs us on the Veda Maarga prathishtApitha Iswara Tatthvam in all its correctnness and glories. Swamy Desikan reminds us of the Atarava Sikhpanishad Vaakyam: \"KaaraNam tu dhyEya: \" ( One who is the Jagath KaaraNan should be the object of one's dhyAnam ) and proves that He is SrIman NaarAyaNan , the Supreme Tatthvam, Para Brahmam and Param JyOthi . He is full of all auspicious attributes and is free from any blemishes . This Iswaran is the One who is SaasthrIya Sarva Karma SamArAdhyan ( all karmAs sanctioned by the Vedams is NaarAyaNa AarAdhanam; whatever is a dreesed to other DevathAs , who are all influenced by their karmAs ( karma VasyALs) reach Him ). This Iswaran is Sarva Karma Phala pradhan (as RaajAdhi Raajan , He grants the fruits for all KarmAs ).He is the One , who can say with clarity , conviction and authority : \" MokshayishyAmi Maa sucha: \" ( Do not grieve; I will chase away all your sins and grant you freedom from the cycles of births and deaths).Thus He is Moksha Phala Pradhan . Summing up, Swamy Desikan states here that for those , who were incessantly tasting the bitterness (kasappu ) of the Taapa Thrayams of SamsAram , he has shown the sukhAnubhavam of the taste of a little drop of the honey of Iswaran in this Para Tatthva adhikAram and attempted to remove their ajn~Anam & ViparItha Jn~Anam. The three adhikArams covered so far are elaborations of \"Sva -paksha sTApana pEtikai \" ( Statement and defense of one's SiddhAntham ); the next 17 adhikArams are about the logical criticisms and condemnations of the other Pakshams ( Para Paksha prathikshEpa pEtikai) , where Swamy Desikan reaches dizzying heights of scholarship and AchAryakathvam . 4. the two Paasurams of SamudhAya dhOshAdhikAram of Para Matha Bhangam --------------------------------------------------------- dealing with the integrated analysis of the defects found in the approaches by the Para Mathams regarding Tatthva Thrayams as well as Hitham and Parama PurushArTam. VeRi aar tuLavudai Vitthahan tanmayin meyyaRivAr kuRiyAr nediyavar yenRu oru kuRRam piRarkku urayAr aRiyAr tiratthil aruL purinthu AaraNa nanneRiyAl siRiyAr vazhigaL azhippathum theengu kazhippathaRkkE (Meaning) : Our AchAryAs who fully understand the Svaroopa- SvabhAva visEshams of the Lord of mysterious deeds adorning the fragrant TuLasi garland will not venture to cast even the smallest of accusations (blames ) on other AchAryAs s. It is not their nature to engage in such activities. Inspite of this leaning , the reason for these merciful AchAryAs with deep faith in Veda mArgam , to criticize the incorrect docrines of other mathams is to protect the simple people , who may be enchanted and ensnared by these alluring (bewitching) appeal of doctrines of Para Mathams even if they have faulty premises. Our AchAryAs point out the inaccuracies and blemishes in Para Mathams purely out of their dayA to save us , the saadhAraNa adhikAris(the untutored). Special Notes: ************* The key passage of this Paasuram is : \" AaraNa nool neRiyAl siRiyAr vazhikaL azhippathum , aRiyAr tiRatthil aruL purinthu theengu kazhippathaRkkE \" ( Following the path laid out by the never-failing VedAs , our merciful AchAryAs destroy the incorrect siddhAnthams that either misintrepret VedAs or stand outside the Vedic doctrines. This they do to remove the damages done from following these alpa darsanams by unsuspecting simple folks). These AchAryAs are fully aware (mey aRivAr) of the Svaroopam and SvabhAvam (tanmai) of the Lord (MaayOn/Vitthahan ) , who sports the fragrant TuLasi garland ( VeRiyAr TuLavudai Vitthahan) . That is why they undertake on themselves the duties of a SadAchAryan to instruct us on the true doctrines based on the correct intrepretations of the VedAs . Veda PramANam **************** Vedams are the best among PramANams to reveal the hollowness of other inaccurate doctrines of Para Mathams . Therefore AchAryAs choose Sabdha (Veda ) PramANam for their efforts .Swamy Desikan suggests that Matha DhUshaNam is not to be mixed with manushya dhUshaNam , while they (AchAryAs) are engaged in the criticism of mathams created by those with either alpa jn~Anam about the true meanings of the VedAs or created by them with total disregard for Vedic doctrines. They have no legitimate pramANams to back them up. PramAnam and PramEyam ********************* PramANa is derived from the root \" PramA \" meaning valid and true knowledge.PramANa means the instrument ( reason ) for valid knowledge. PramEya is the object of cognition/object of knowledge. VisishtAdhvaitha VedAntham accepts Perception , inference and verbal testimony ( Sabdha) as PramANmas . ChArvaka Matham accepts perception (prathyaksha) as the only means of valid knowledge. The Bhuddhists and VaisEshikAs accept two PramANams : Perception (pratyaksha ) and inference ( anumAna ) . PrabhAkara MeemAmsa accepts Prathyaksha, anumAna and Sabdha along with presumption (arthApatti ) as PramANams . Bhatta MeemAsa and Adhvaitham accepts the traditional three along with three more as PramANAs: comparison , presumption and noncognition ( anupalabdhi) . Saiva SiddhAntham accepts Siva-chith-Sakthi as the primary pramAnam and accepts the traditional three as secondary pramANams. DvaithAs have two kinds of PramANAs: Anu pramANa and Kevala PramANa . Latter is defined as an object as it is. For Dvaitha VedAnthins , the traditional three PramANAs are grouped under the category of anu-pramANa (Source of valid knowledge) . Veda PrAmANyam ( True Validity of the VedAs ) is common to Advaitha, Dhvaitha and VisishtAdhvaitha Darsanams . Buddhism, Jainism do not accept the validity of the VedAs and are therefore called Veda Baahya Mathams. 164) The common dhOshams of Para Mathams *************************************** minDu uraikka virahu tarum tarukkam koNDE vENDumkAl vENDuvathE viLampuhinrAr kaNDatharkku viparItham katthuhinrAr kANAtha kuRai maRayil kAtta niRpAr PaNDu orutthan kaNDu uraitthEn nAnE yennap- pala vahayilum upAthihaLAl padinthu veezhvAr KoNDal okkum ThirumEni Maayak-kUtthan kurai kazhal sEr vithi vahayil koodAthArE (Meaning ): The followers of KaNAtha-Gouthama- VyAkaraNa -MeemAmsa darsanams say whatever they want at the desired times and use illogic that gives rise to futile debates . Those who belong to the BhAskara-Yaadhava adhvaitham will distort what they see (Prathyaksham/Perception ) and shout about them . The ChArvAka- Bhoudda -Jaina Matham followers will declare that Vedam is created by humans and deny its apourushEyam origin from the Lord Himself. Those who belong to Saankhya-Yoga and Paasupatha mathams believe in the statements of Sage Kapila, BrahmA and Siva that they invented these mathams and eat and seek dhravyams to make their lives comfortable. Alas ! What a pity that none of those belonging to these Para Mathams have the good fortune of seeking the divine feet of SrIman NaarAyaNan and enjoy them as Parama bhOgyam and PurushArTam. 5. the two Paasurams dealing with the criticism of the ChArvAka Matham . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 165) Condemnation of the ChaarvAka /UlOhAyatha Matham *********************************************** KaNdathu mey yenil kANum maRayil aRivu kaNDOm kaNDathu alAthathu ilathu yenil ithil kuRRam kaNDilam kaNDathu pOl maRai kAttuvathum kaNDathu otthathanAl uMDathu kEtkkum ulOhAyathar yenRu meeruvathE The Doctrine of ChArvakam : Prathyaksham alone is PramANam says ChArvaakAs.Only those recognized by direct perception (Prathyaksham) are true according to them. Rest are false . Therefore , every thing described by Vedam that is not seeable by the direct perception such as Dharmam, adharmam , Iswaran , the Other world are all false according to CharvAkAs. These CharvAkAs equate arTa kAmams (POruL , Inbham) as equal to PurushArTam ( Veedu). Swamy Desikan rejects the view that Prathyaksham alone is PramANam.He goes on to establish why anumAnam and Sabdham(Vedam) are additional necessary PramANams. Swamy Desikan quotes Swamy ParAsara Bhattar's SrI RangarAja Sthava SlOkam 2.5 to refute CharvAkA's claim that Vedam is not PramANam . Here Bhattar argues that CharvAkAs hear the Vedam through their ears , which is Prathyaksham since it is a prathyaksha indhriyam and develop knowledge about the Meanings of the Vedam (arTa Jn~Anam ) from there. Bhattar asks how one can categorize Vedam as Meaningless , when the knowledge about meaning is obtained through one's ears . The chief reason for Prathyaksham is the assistance of an Indhriyam . When the ear as an Indhriyam hears it and develops arTa Jn~Anam , Bhattar asks how can you reject sabdham(Vedam ) as false . Some CharvAkAs include anumAnam and aagamam in Prathyaksham . Swamy Desikan rejects that view and points out that Prathyaksham and anumAnam are separate PramANams .Swamy Desikan's arguments are deep and incisive to reject ChArvaka Matham as unacceptable as elaborated in the next paasuram. 166) The inconsistency between the ChArvakA's doctrines and actions ******************************************************* KaNDathanAl kANathathu anumikkinranar KaNDu Orutthan uraitthatanai kavaruhinRAr uNDu pasi kedum yenRE uNarnthu uNkinrAr onRAlE onRait-tAmm sAdhikkinRAr paNDu mulai uNDu athanaal mulai uNkinrAr pArkkinrAr pala allAt-taMMai maRRum kaNDu mathi ketta nilai kANahillAr kANathathu ilathu yenRu kalnguvArE (Meaning ): ChArvakAs infer the presence of Agni from the directly seen smoke. Another believes in the vishayam that is directly seen and experienced by the ear and accepts it . >From this , it is clear that the charvAkAs accept anumAnam and sabdham. They consume food with the knowledge that hunger will be relieved , when one is hungry. They do not know however that hunger will be removed by eating , before eating through the power of prathyaksham . Further , as Vaadhis , they point why they agree with the PrathivAdhis on the reasons and state that the unseen vasthu exits. By this act, they have agreed to the validity of anumAnam and Sabdham. The CharvAkAs , who only accept the body that is seeable by prathyaksham and reject the unseeable aathmA as nonexistent can come up with the only answer for the new born baby drinking mother's milk because of poorva janma vaasanai (memories of previous births). By this they have to agree that there is an eternal aathmA other than the SarIram . Further , the CharvAkAs who equate the body with the aathmA see the aathmA , which has no hand or leg or eye in the same way as the limbs of the SarIram ( hand, leg, eye of that SarIram ) that they can see by direct perception (Prathyaksham). Thus the CharvAkAs know that their doctrines are inconsistent with their actions and lose their minds and yet wont give up their faulty doctrines. 6. Today , we will study the two Paasurams dealing with Swamy Desikan's criticism of the MaadhyAmika Matham . -------------------------------------------------------- Before we proceed with the study of the meaning of the Paasurams realted to the refutation of the doctrines of the four sects of Bhouddha Matham , it would be useful to have an overview of this matham as elaborated in SarvArTa Siddhi of Swamy Desikan . The excerpts from the Doctoral thesis of Dr.V.N.SeshAdhriyAcchAr about SarvArTa Siddhi is : \" There are four schools of Buddhism: VaibhAshika , Sautraanika , YogAchAra and Maadhyamika.They have some common points: (1) all entities are impermanent , transitory and in a continous state of change (2) apart from the flow of cognitions , there is no soul or Aathman as the seat of cognition or consciousness. Coming to The School of Budhdism of Maadhyamika , it has close relationship with the school of nihilists of western philosophy in denying the real existence of every thing seen within and around us.... The MaadhyAmikas deny the reality of everything in the universe. Even consciousness or intellect (chaitanya) is considered unreal . Nothing comes into existence nor perishes. Like other schools of Buddhism , MaadhyAmikas hold that things are momentary... There is a close relationship to Advaitham among the doctrines of MaadhyAmikam (Samvruthi in MaadhyAmikam is the same as the term avidhya in advaitham).Adhvaithin holds every thing except Brahman is unreal and the appearance of thing as existing is due to the superimposition on the basis (adhishtAna) , namely , Brahman which alone is real as per his (adhvaitin's) contention , MaadhyAmika finds no purpose in holding even that Brahman as real to serve as basis (adhishtAna) for the superimposition and maintains that no cognition requires a basis.The MaadhyAmika asks: \" What harm would arise if Brahman alone is denied reality ? . The MaadhyAmika does not accept the authority of Vedam and has no scruples in denying the need for a real basis (adhishtAna) for unreality. Thus, MaadhyAmikan denies the existence of Brahman and is an atheist. Swamy Desikan refuted soundly the MaadhyAmika's views , which seek to prove the void of the universe as opposed to the reality of the universe. \" 167) Criticism of the MaadhyAmika Matham ************************************ kANa(tha)thu ilathu yenuumkalviyinArai kaDinthathaRppin kONAr kutharkkangaL koNDE kuzhappum bhavuttharhaLil nANAthu anaitthum ilathu yenRum nAlvahai anRu yenRum VaazhnAL aRukkinRa matthimatthAn vazhi mARRuvamE (Meaning): One of the four sishyAs of Bhuddha is Maadhyamikan, who developed the doctrine : \"Sarvam Soonyam \" (all is void ) and without hesitation declares that there are no Tatthvams. He was the most favored sishyan of Buddha. It is generally accepted that there are four kinds of vasthus in the Prapancham (universe): (1) Sath (Truly existing ) , (2) asath (nonexistent ) , (3) Sathasath ( Mixture of true and untrue ) and (4) sathasath vilakshaNam ( one which is neither Sath or asath). Maadhyamikan holds that the Universe can not be classified as any one of the above four kinds. He denies the existence of Iswaran and the vasthus of the universe belonging to Him and therefore loses the fruits obtained through the grace of Iswaran . In this context , MaadhyAmikan is like the women , who hates her living husband and cuts her MangaLa Soothram and throws it away. Swamy Desikan says that He refutes MaadhyAmikam as the First of the four Buddhistic systems in the 7th adhikAram of his Para Matha Bhangam. 168) Protecting the world from being stolen/deluded by MaadhyAmikAs ******************************************************* mAnam ilai mEyam ilai yenRu maRROr Vaadha neRi ilai yenRum vaathu pooNDa thAnumilai tannurayum poruLm ilai tatthuvathtin uNartthi sayam illai yenRum vAnavarum mAnavarum manamum veLha vaLam pEsu mathkEdan MatthimatthAn tEna neRi koNDu anaitthum thiruDA vaNNam sezhumathi pOl yezhum mathiyAR-semitthOmE (Meaning ): MaadhyAmikan's doctrine is that all is soonyam (void). In his matham , there is no pramANam to comprehend the different vasthus. There is no debating method . He is not there for engaging in debate. There is no vaakyam uttered by him and no meaning for those vAkyams. There is no Tathtva Jn~Anam . There is no victory in debates. Inview of these strange aspects of his matham , the DevAs and humans laugh at his doctrines and his own mind also chuckles about his stupidity . We (Swamy Desikan ) refuted these strange doctrines of MaadhyAmikan , which makes every thing void and denies the existence of Iswaran and His sentient and insentient universe. 7. Swamy Desikan's criticism of the Second of the Four Matham associated with Buddhism : YogAchAram. ----------------------------------------------------------------- Before we proceed further with the study of the meaning of the Paasurams realted to the refutation of the doctrines of the four sects of Bhouddha Matham , it would be useful to have another summation of this matham as elaborated in SarvArTa Siddhi of Swamy Desikan . The excerpts from the Doctoral thesis of Dr.V.N.SeshAdhriyAcchAr about SarvArTa Siddhi is : \" There are three corner stones of Buddhism with the exception of VaibhAshika matham : (1)Nothing is permanent , (2) Nothing has any self or inner substratum , and (3) NirvANa is tranquility . According to Yamakami, these three are fundamental tenets of Buddhism , which distinguishes it from all other religious systems in the history of the world. According to Buddhists , there is no being , but there is only becoming . All individual objects are unstable nad ephemeral. Every thing , be it a person , a thing or God , is therefore merely an aggregation of component elements. Further in all individuals , with out any exception , the relation of their component parts is eternally changing and is never the same even for two consecutive moments.Putting together implies becoming , becoming means becoming different , and becoming different can not arise without a dissolution-- a passing away , which must inevitably and finally be complete.\" As an introduction to YogAchAra matham , the summing up by Dr.V.N.SeshaadhriyAcchAr is pertineny : \" Things may be considered as permanent only if , at all times, present , past and future , they remain the same without undergoing any change or assuming a new future. If it suffers any alteration or acquires a new feature or peculiarity , which did not exist before , it can not be maintained as permanent . To the Buddhists , there is no distinction between the attributes (dharma) and the thing possesesing that attribute(dharmi) . The attribute and the thing which is supposed by the scholars of other doctrines as having that attribute are one and the same. So if a new change or attribute or feature occurs in the thing , it is a new thing , the old thing having ceased to exist ... YogAchAran denies the existence of three different entities , namely , cognition , its object and the cognizer. The existence of them as distinct entities according to YogAchAran is due to illusion .\" 169) Refutation of YogAchAra Matham ********************************* muRRum chahatthil ilathu yenRE pahattiya muttarai nAmm suRRum thuRanthu thuRayil ninRE tuhaL-Aakkiya pinn maRRu onRu ilathu mathi pala uNDenRu vanchanyAl saRRum thuRantha yOgAchAranai sathikkinRanamE (Meaning) : One of the four groups of Bhouddham with the name of MaadhyAthmikan propagated his foolish doctrine that every thing is void in this world and cheated the human beings with his trickery. Earlier , We stood firmly on VedAnthic ground and refuted his matham and pulverized his doctrines. Now , we refute the doctrines of the second group of Bhouddham known as YogAchAram , which also tried to enchant the world with its sophistry. YogAchAran's main contention is that Jn~Anam alone is true. It is of many kinds. Beyond that , there is neither the knower nor the vasthus understood by that Jn~Anam. Since he rejected himself as the knower and the objects enjoyed by him , he is a forever loser that forefeits even the trivial phalans that he is entitled to in this & the other world. Dr.SeshAdriyAcchAr sums up this philosophy of YogAchAryan this way: \" Cognitions apprehend their objects as if the objects were distinct from the cognitions and as existing externally. Hence , the yogAchAran is called \" aathma-khyAti vaadin \" . If the so-called external objects , he says , are spoken of as being real, it is due to their having only the empirical reality ( Samvruthi-sathyatA )... As a matter of fact , there is neither a separate apprehender nor even a seperate apprehended object . One and the same apprehension appears in three forms as apprehender , apprehension and apprehended...\". In the next paasuram , Swamy Desikan says that the two eyes of YogAchaaran are KshaNikathvam and NirAkArathvam. These are his PramANam and PramEyam. Swamy Desikan says that he used VedAnthic arguments to destroy them as meaningless babble. 170) Establishment of the Universe denied by YogAchAran ********************************************** uLak-kathiyai nAmm uLLI uLLam tERi ulahatthAr uhanthu isaya ulahu uNDu yenROm iLakka arithAhiya nall tarukkam sErntha yezhil maRayil Isanudan yemmaik-kaNDOm viLakku nirai pOl mathikaL vERAy vERu onRu aRiyAthE viLangumena viLambuhinRa kaLak-karutthan kaNNIraNDu azhitthOm nANA kAham pOl thirinthu avan kathaRumARE (Meaning ): The doctrine of YogAchAryan is that Jn~Anam is born from moment to moment in new forms and ceases to exist the next moment(KshaNikatthvam) .This Jn~Anam will not relate to any thing other than itself. Therfore , there are no external objects (nirAkArathvam). The successions of the Jn~Anam that is born every second and dies is considered as AathmA . This leads to the inevitable conclusion that AathmA is not eternal. At the same time , consideration of AathmA as Jn~Anam confers its firm presence as a lasting entity (sTiram). Therefore, there is a fundamental contradiction in YogAchAran's views. Just as the flames (JwAlAs) emanating from a lamp (Dheepam ) varies from moment to moment and yet is the same dheepam that is behind these variations in a firm and steady manner to give the Jn~Anam that it is the same Dheepa JwAlai , it is concluded that Aathma is anithyam and the doctrines of YogAcchAran are incorrect. YogAchAran negates ChEthanam , achEthanam and Iswaran using untenable logic. He says that \" the knower is false\" and \" the known vasthu is false (nonexistent)\". Swamy Desikan states that he has destroyed the above two \"eyes\" of YogAchAra matham and reduced the status of YogAchaaran as a wailing blind man . He compares the YogAcharan's status to that of the KaakAsuran , who committed unforgivable apachArams to SithA PirAtti and sought without success some one to protect him in all the three worlds and finally lost one of his eyes to the blade of grass empowered by Lord Raamachandran to serve as BrahmAsthram . Swamy Desikan says that KakAsuran wailed over loss of one eye , where as YogAchAran symbolically lost both his eyes(KshaNikatthvam and NIrAkAratthvam ) in the debate with him and was wailing over that unbearable loss. 8. Criticism of the Third of the Four Mathams associated with Buddhism : SouthrAnthikam . -------------------------------------------------------------- Before studying the two Paasurams of Swamy Desikan on this branch of Buddhism , let us summarize the key aspects of SouthrAnthikam as presentedd by Dr.V.N.SeshAdhriyAcchAr Swamy ( Dr.V.N.S Swamy ) : 1. The MadhyAmikan focused on Soonya Vaadham. 2. The YogAchAryan stayed with the theory of the Phenomenality of the world. 3. SauthrAnthikan represented that things being imperceptible are to be inferred by their forms imprinted in the cognitions. Buddhist's views of momentariness of all things (KshaNikathvam ) and the theory that substratum is no more than an aggregation of qualities (nirAkArathvam ) are broadly present in all of the four Buddhistic Mathams. Although momentary features can not be completely denied such as Cloud , flood et al , this does not lead to the conclusion that non-momentary entities do not exist. Dr.Varadachary of the French Institute of Indology points out in this context that Recognition proves that stability (AakArathvam instead of nirAkArathvam) is at the basis of the worldly things in most of the Vaidhika Mathams . Coming back to SautrAntikan , he hods that the external objects like pot and cloth are real but they can not however be directly percieved by the senses . He states that these (pot or cloth) can only be inferred by the cognition , which bears their \" form \" or \"likeness\". SautrAntikan 's view of the process of generation of a perception and subsequent cognition is described by Dr.V.N.S Swamy this way : \" There are few requisites for every cognition: (1) Aalambana Pratyaya (2) Samanantara Pratyaya (3) SahakAri Pratyaya and (4) Adipathi Pratyaya . ( Let us understand each of the four Pratyayas and their interrelationships) (1) Aalambana pratyaya relates to the objects , which are the causes of the cognitions in which , in the absence of those objects , can not come in to being . (2) Samanatara pratyaya is a cognition that enables the succeding cognition to recieve the form of the external objects. (3) SahakAri pratyaya refers to light etc. which are responsible in making the cognition distinct with regard to its object. The absence of light disables a person from having a clear apprehension of an object placed in the darkness.Therefore light is sahakAri (assistive). (4) Adhipathi pratyaya refers to the sense organs . It is the sense organs that make the objects present their forms to the cognition in the succeeding moment . As the external objects present their forms to the Cognition , so do the internal objects like pleasure, pain and hatred ; thus they too become inferable . \" SautrAntikan's view is based on an untenable theory and has been criticized by the other two Mathams associated with Buddhism ( YogAcharam and VaibhAshikam). AchArya RaamAnuja and Swamy Desikan have soundly criticized the SautrAntrikan's theories using Tarkam and VedAntham. Acharya Raamanuja asks the question : \" If things are contended to be MOMENTARY , the external things would cease to exist in the moment of the presentation of their form to the mind. In the absence of such a thing , how can its form alone survive to be presented to the mind? The unsoundness of the SautrAntikan's views is severely criticized by Swamy Desikan in SarvArTa Siddhi and Para Matha Bhangam as well as in the Desika Prabhandham carrying the same name. 171) Refutation of the SautrAntika Matham ********************************** PoruL onRu ilathu yenRu bhOdham onRum kONDa poyyarai nAmm teruL kONDu theertha pinnkANavoNNA poruL tEDuhinRa maruL koNDa soothu uraikkum SoutthhirAnthakan vaNNikkai nAmm iruL koNDa pAzhamkiNaRu yenRu ihazhnthu Ooda viyampuvamE (Meaning) : YogAchAran has the doctrine that there are no external objects and that Jn~Anam alone exists. We (Swamy Desikan ) refuted those views with our special Jn~Anam acquired from our AchAryAs in the previous adhikAram. The Buddhist belonging to SautrAnthika Matham accepts the reality of external objects. The SautrAnthikan due to his ignorance tries to use beguiling ruses to prove the existence of the external objects and internal entities through anumAnam (inference ). His unconvincing arguments are like the Paazhum KiNaRu ( dark and dangerous empty well ). If any one stumbles in to this type of well will lose his life . We (Swamy Desikan ) criticized severely the SautrAnthika Matham so that VivEkis will develop a distaste for this Matham and stay away from it. 172) The Inconsistencies of the SautrAntikan's doctrines ******************************************* nilayillA poruL mathiyai viLaitthu tAnn sER niRam kodutthu tAnn azhiyum tannAl vantha nilayillA mathi tannil niRatthaik-kANum ithu kANum poruL kANNKai yenRa neesan mulai illAt-tAai koduttha mulaip-paal uNNUm muhamilla mozhi yenavE mozhintha vArtthai talai illAt-taaL oorum kaNakkAi ninRa kattaLai nAmm kaNDu inRu kaattinOmE (Meaning): In contrast to YogAchAran , SautrAnthikan accepts the existence of external objects. SautrAntikan's doctrine is: External objects generate Jn~Anam and hand over the white , yellow and other colors to that Jn~Anam and become extinct. Therefore , the Indhriyams can not apprehend /comprehend these objects , which have the svabhAvam of extinction after enriching Jn~Anam about their attributes like their colors. Even id these external objects cease to exist, we can comprehend the objects through the information transferred to Jn~Anam about the colors through a process of anumAnam (inference). Even this Jn~Anam with transferred information on the colors of the external objects becomes extinct in a trice (KshaNam ). This Jn~Anam is equivalent to the AathmA. This Jn~Anam will enjoy the colors like blue , yellow et al that has been given to it by the external objects. This anubhavam is termed Vasthu SaakshAthkAram. In SautrAntikan's doctrine , one has to accept that Jn~Anam is generated after the birth of the Vasthu . That vasthu exists for a KshaNam and ceases to exist after that kshaNam . During that KshaNam of its existence , the external object creates Jn~Anam and imparts information about itself to Jn~Anam and thereafter the external object ceases to exist . Thus this external object that is destined to become extinct in a kshaNam has to be born first, Create Jn~Anam in the first second , transfer the information to Jn~Anam in the second Second and in the third second has to become extinct. This is totally impossible to concieve . Further, the Jn~Anam housing the imparted information also becomes extinct after a KshaNam . First second, Jn~Anam is born , the next second it becomes the repository of information from the external objects and in the third second , it has to become extinct . How can that Jn~Anam accomplish Vasthu SaakshAthkAram ( Visualization of external objects )? It is inconceivable and imposisble . The situation here is similar to the baby helping itself to mother's mik from a mother , who has no breasts; it is like speaking , when there is no face ; it is like the movement by the feet , when there is no head in the body to command it. Thus we refute the inconsistent and unsound theories of SautrAnthikam says Swamy Desikan in this Paasuram. 9. criticism of the fourth of the Four Mathams associated with Buddhism : VaibhAshikam . ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Before studying the two Paasurams of Swamy Desikan on this branch of Buddhism , let us summarize the key aspects of VaibhAshikam as presented by U.Ve. Dr.V.N.SeshAdhriyAcchAr Swamy ( Dr.V.N.S Swamy ) and his elder brother , U.Ve. V.N.SrIrAma DesikAcchAr Swamy : \" The Four Schools of Buddhism , namely , VaibhAshika , SautrAntika , YogAchAra and Maadhyamika , inspite of many differences in their principles , have some aggrements in their viewpoints : (1) All entities are impermanent , transitory and in a continous state of change (2) apart from the flow of cognitions , there is no soul or aathman as the seat of cognition or consciousness. Unlike the two latter Buddhists (YogAchara and MaadhyAmika) , the VaibhAshika and the SautrAntika hold both mental and physical entities as real and existing . The VaibhAshika contends that all external objects are real and apprehensible by perceptions generated by the sense organs . Space and NirvANa are , according to him , eternal ; matter and mind which is not an entity distinct from the so-called soul or atman , are impermanent and momentary. For the reason that some entities are held as permanent and non-momentary , the VaibhAshika is condemned as a non-buddhist even by his colleagues , who uphold the momentariness of all existing entities. The VaibhAshika is grouped with SautrAntika because both of them maintain the reality of external things. Consequently, they are both called Sarva-asti-vAdhins .The VaibhAshika objects however to the contention of SautrAntika on the point of presentation of a form by the external thing to the mind \". 173) Swamy Desikan's condemnation of VaibhAshikam ******************************************** KaaNkinravan ilai kAtcchiyum kaNDathum uNDu avai tAmm yENN koNDana anRu ivaRRil guNamum nilayum ilai sENN koNDa santhathiyAl sErnthum onRu yena niRkum yenRa kONN koNDa kOLUrai VaibhAtikan kuRai kUruvamE (Meaning ): VaibhAshika's doctrine are: (1) The Jn~AthA , who knows the meaning is false ( poy aavAn) (2) Jn~Anam , and the entity comprehended by the Jn~Anam are real entities(3) That Jn~Anam and the vasthus comprehended by it are limitless(4) Both of them however have no attributes (GuNams) (5) They do not stay permanent and are destroyed in a moment. (6) Vasthus will stay as assemblies of ParamANus ( sub-atomic entiites ). Some weird and distorted inferences are made form this ParamAnu theory of VaibhAshikan . According to him , although the ParamANus are limitless , their assembly makes the entity of similar ParmANus that we call as a Pot or the flame made up of similar ParamANus of fire(microcosms of fire ) . Even if the sparks of flames are similar ParamANus to make the mighty flame , it is confusing to extend the instaneously perishing sarks to become an existign flame. This kind of Vakra (distorted) rguments are criticized heavily by Swamy Desikan in VaibhAshika BangAdhikAram . (174) The contrast between Theory and Reality in VaibhAshikam **************************************************** kumbhiduvAr yAr yenRu tEduhinRAr guNangaLayum tangaLuku kooRuhinRAr tamm padiyai tamarkku urIaitthup-padivikkinRAr tamakku ini mEl VeedenRu sAthikkinRAr tamm pudavai uNal kuritthu nedithu yeNkinRAr santhatikkut-tavam palikkat-tAmm pOhinRAr sempadavar seyhinRa siRRinippaic- chEvahap-paRRudanE nAmm sehtthittOmE (Meaning ): VaibhAshikars accept Jn~Anam and vasthu as real and yet reject guNams (attributes) in them and state their existence is momentary. These doctrines counter their behavior . VaibhAshikAs spend a lot of time and effort to collect sishyAs for the sake of amassing wealth and glory . They proclaim that they possess dispassion (VairAgyam ) and non-violence (ahimsA) . They instruct the sishyAs about their doctrine that they will secure MOksham , the moment their bodies fall down at the end of their life span . They take a lot of trouble to amass wealth and food and worry quite a bit on bodily matters. They state that they perform penance for the upliftment of their sishyAs and family . All of these are inconsistent with their doctrines that all entities are momentary and these entities have no attributes. We (Swamy Desikan ) have refuted all these inconsitencies between the VaibhAshikA's acts and their professed philosophies . The use of the Tamil word in this Paasuram \"Sempadavan \" has double meanings: (1) Sempadavar means fishermen . Hers the VaibhAshikAs are compared to fishermen , who use their distorted logic to attract the minds of the people to win them over to their doctrines (2) Sem+padavar means one , who wears ochre robes ( KaashAyam). 10. criticism of Adhvaitham . ----------------------------- At the outset , let me request all who to read this posting to treat it as a historical summary with no intention to hurt anybody's feelings . This particular posting is aimed at the students of Philosophy . Source Literature ************* There are many outstanding books on Advaitha, Dhvaitha , VisishtAdhvaitha VedAnthams by eminent AchAryAs going back to many centuries . In most recent times , the following books on the comparitive analysis and defense of Advaitha and VisishtAdhvaitha Darsanams would be of immense use to the students of such darsanams : 1. SrI Madhusoodhana Saraswathi ( 1540-1647 C.E) : Advaitha Siddhi 2. Swamy Desikan (1268-1369 C.E) : Satha DhUshaNi & Other SrI Sookthis such as AdhikaraNa SaarAvaLi , 11th chapter of Para Matha Bhangam 3. SrI AnanthakrishNa Saasthri ( 1956) : Satha BhUshaNi 4. SrI UtthamUr Swamy ( 1959): ParamArTa BhUshaNam 5.SrI S.M.S. Chari 1961) : Advaita and VisishtAdhvaitha (A study based on Vedanata Desika\"s Sata DhUshaNi ). 6. SrI S.M.S. Chari ( 1998): The Philosophy of the Vedantha SoothrAs Before studying the two Paasurams of Swamy Desikan on Advaitham , let us summarize the key aspects of Advaitham as presented by U.Ve. Dr.V.N.SeshAdhriyAcchAr Swamy ( Dr.V.N.S Swamy ) and his elder brother , U.Ve. V.N.SrIrAma DesikAcchAr Swamy along the lines of AchArya RaamAnujA in SrI BhAshyam (laghu and MahA SiddhAntham) and Swamy Desikan in Satha DhUshaNi, Tatthva Muktha KalAPam , SarvArTa Siddhi and Para Matha Bhangam (11th Chapter: Pracchanna Bhouddha BhangAdhikAram) . Adhi Sankara's contributions *********************** His contributions are many from PrakaraNa granthams to moving sthOthrams and subhAshithams like Bhaja Govindham. Adhi Sankara destroyed the faulty doctrines of Veda-Baahya mathams like Bhuddhism and Jainism and established the authority of Vedams and crushed the nihilistic theories of Bhuddhisam . We are indebted to Adhi Sankara for these unique contributions . Adviatham & Buddhism (Continued) ***************************** Dr.V.Varadachary's observations on Adhvaitham developed by Aadhi Sankara are : \" Idealism of the Bhuddhists found room in SankarA's system in which Brahman assumed the place of Knowledge. Brahman is without attributes and is the only Reality. The world of animates and inanimates (ChEthanams and achEthanams ) has only phenomenal existence and while dividing existence thus in to absolute and phenomenal , SankarA paved the way for living a virtous life leading finally to absolutism \". In view of overlaps with Buddhistic doctrines in some key areas , some have described adhvaitham as Pracchanna Bhouddham. Some disagreements **************** VaishNavite Achaaryas have over centuries disagreed with the basic premises of Advaitham in the follwing areas as defined by Dr.S.M.S. Chari in his classical monograph entitled \"Advaitha and VisishtAdhvaitha \" : (1) The validity of PramANAs for Advaita VedAntham (2) The nature and content of Perception (3) TheNature of Consciousness (4) The nature of Jeevan (5) The Nature of Brahman: SaguNa or NirguNa Brahman (6) The nature of Jagath (Universe) (7) The doctrine of avidhya and (8) Sadhana and Mukthi . As Dr.S.M.S. Chari points out , there have been criticisms Advaitham by VisishtAdhvaitham and vice versa over centuries and continues even today. Darsanams wiht different view points ****************************** Professor P.N. SrInivAsAchAri's wise assessment has to be borne in mind, while we treat this subject ( the Two schools of VedAnthA ) in this series of Postings on Para Matha Bhangam . \" Every VedAnthic System has a synthetic purpose as it claims be a criticism of and fulfilment of previous systems. The conflicts between two schools of thought do not in any way affect their value as a system of philosophy . On the other hand , they enrich them in so far as they serve as an impetus to further development of Philosophic thought \" . The Core Doctrines of Adhvaitham *************************** Samkara Advaitha has the core doctrines: \" Brahma Satyam Jagan Mithya , JivO Brahmaiva na Para: \" This core statement of Advaitham affirms (1) the nonduality of Brahman / the onenness of the individual Jeevan with the absolute Brahaman/ the nondifference between the Jevan and Brahaman (2) the nonreality of the empirical world around us and (3) Brahman alone is True. The key concept in Advaitha VedAntha is avidhyA /MaayA ) . It is used to explain the distinction between the attributeless (nirguNa ) Brahman and the One with attributes (SaguNa Brahman ) and to explain the distinction between non-dual reality appearing as Jeevans and as God ( Iswaran) . 175) Refutation of Adhvaitham ************************** VedangaL mouli viLanga ViyAsan virittha nal nool paadhangaL aana pathinARil Isan padi maRaitthu BhEthangaL illai yenRu ohR birama picchu iyambuhinRa bhOdham kazhinthavanai Bhuddhar mAttudan poottuvamE (Meaning): For the purpose of understanding the true meaning of Upanishads , Sage VyAsa compiled Brahma Soothrams in four adhyAyams containing sixteen padhams . Adhvaithins do not accept Iswaran's anantha kalyANa guNams and Svaroopam proclaimed by the above VedAntha Saasthram . Instead , they describe Brahman as mere JN~Ana Svaroopan without any guNams (nirguNa Brahman). They assert Brahman alone is Real (sathyam ) and all else are false. They declare that MayA does make all these unreal objects appear real to Brahman as a result of its Ajn~Anam . We have no choice under these circumstances to link adhvaitham with Bhouddham and reject both as unsound in this adhikAram of Pracchanna BhouddhA Matha Bangam . 176) Condemnation of the avidhyA sambhandham to Brahman ************************************************ pirivu illa iruL onRu piNakku onRu illA peru-veyilai maRaitthu ulaham kaattum yenna aRivillA aRivu onRai avitthai moodi aham puRam yenRu ivai anaithtum amaikum yenpAr seRivu illA Buddharudan sErnthu kettAr seevanayum Isanayum chithaikkap-pArthAr neRi illA nErvazhiyum tAnE aanAn NedumAlai nAmm adainthu nilai peRROME (Meaning ) : The main tenet of Adhvaithis is that Brahmam alone is true (sathyam). It has no GuNams like Jn~Anam. But it (Brahman) stands as the Jn~Ana Svaroopam . There is no real Vasthu other than Jn~Anam .Brahma Svaroopam has sambhandham from time immemorial to a vasthu called MaayA. The nature of MaayA is to hide its aadhAram , Brahman.Sine Brahman is hidden by MaayA , Brahma svaroopam does nor shine as it should in its real nature. This MaayA is a vasthu made up of the three guNams , Satthvam , Rajas and Tamas ; it can not be described either as real or unreal; it has the svabhAvam (nature ) to hide its substratum (aadhAram); it changes constantly.It hides Brahma Svaroopam and shows transformed vasthus like Water, Earth ( Pruthvee) and similarly through its thirOdhanam (hiding Brahman ) , shows up as variations such as Desire (icchA ), Jn~Anam and DhvEsham ( resentment). These are the key doctrines of Advaitham. The description of avidhyai hiding Brahman to create all vasthus is like saying that a mighty darkness hides the brightest luminous body and that mighty darkness shows all vasthus of the world to the people ( IruL onRu peru veyilai maRaitthu ulaham kAttum yenna) . It is YogAchAran's doctrine that Jn~Anam alone is sathyam and the rest are false.He says that Jn~Anam is momentary in existence.It ceases to exist every moment and newer Jn~Anams are born and perish the next second. This anithyathvam (impermanence) and Bhauthvam ( nature of being many Jn~Anmas) are figments of fancy and are not consistent with Veda PramANams. In this Bhouddha Matham , Jn~AthA (the knower ) is false ( asathyam) and the phalans of the Jn~Anam are also unreal. Adhvaitham overlaps thus with YogachAras in some areas and MaadhyAmikas in other areas . There are commonalities between the two mathams. Bhouddham is an avaidhika matham ( Veda Baahya matham ) and does not accept Vedam as PramANam. Adhvitham is indeed a Vaidhika matham but misintreprets the true meanings of VedAntham as revealed by Sage VyAsa in his Brahma Soothrams.The key outcome for adhvaitham is that they do not accept that Jeevan and Iswaran are different tatthvams. The Adhvaithins believe in the identity of Jeevan with Brahman . In Adhvaitham , \" All things other than Brahman are unreal because they are different from Brahman, like the shell-Silver . Avidhya (ignorance ) makes one see the universe in Brahman even though the Universe has no real existence...This doctrine of avidhyA or MaayA is the very life blood of Adhvaitha \" .With the use of avidhyA , the realtion between Brahman and the Universe is distorted by adhvaithins. VisishtAdhvathins stoutly refute many of the above doctrines of Adhvaitham.They hold that The Universe is Real and the Supreme Being is full of kalyAna GuNams . Brahman is held to be playing the role of Soul to the Universe , which is recognized as His own body. The Body-Soul relationship between the Universe and Brahman is the life blood of VisishtAdhvaitham . All the chEthanams and achEhtanams form the body of Brahman . VisishtAdhvaitham's central tenet is \" Brahman (the Supreme Being) having the Universe of ChEthanams and achEthanams as its body is the ONLY Real thing and there is NOTHING , which is not the body of Brahman and which is independent of the same Supreme Being .Whereas in the doctrine of Adhvaitha , Brahman alone is real, and every thing else--Sentients and insentients -- is false ; the VisishtAdhvaitha while presenting the view that brahman alone is real explains that brahman includes sentients and insentients , which are proved to be inseparable attributes and body of Brahman. This intrepretation reveals a vast gulf of difference between Adhvaitham and VisishtAdhvaitham \". Swamy Desikan states in this slOkam : \" neRi illA nEr vazhiym tAnE aanAn, NedumAlai adainthu nilai peRROM \" ( We performed the UpAyam of SaraNAgathy to the Lord , SrIman NaarAyaNan , who has no other alternative except Himself for granting MOksham and we as Sesha BhUthans protected out Svaroopam as His eternal servant through rejection of other misleading Mathams like Adhvaitham . 11. refute the avaidhika Matham of Jainam ------------------------------------------- ( 12 thChapter of Para Matha Bhangam: Jaina Matha BhangAdhikAram). 177) Refutation of Jainism ********************************* sOthanai vittu orutthan sola meyyenac-chOhatarai sEthanai aRRavar yenRu sithaittha pinn seevarkatkkOr vEdanai seyhai veRum maRam yenRu viLampi vaitthE maatavam yenRu mayir paRippAr mayal maaRRuvamE (Meaning): The Jains do not accept the eternal VedAs as having been created by no human beings (apourushEyam) . Tthey do not accept the Vedams bequeathed to us by the Lord as PramAnam.Bouddhism is in the same category of Veda Baahya Mathams . In this chapter , we refute the Jaina Matham as we did before the four kinds of Bhouddha mathams. The key doctrine of Jainism is nonviolence to every living being. Inspite of this avowed doctrine not to cause any pain to living beings , they pull out their own hair and cause harm to themselves and consider that act of himsai as a great act of penance. We will remove their ignorance about fundamental tatthvams. The reason for many to like Jaina Matham over Buddha Matham is because of its difference from Buddhism in accepting that the world is real and that here are nithya and anithya vasthus. They agree however with the Bhuddhists that mind is not a distinct entity from the Soul.They preach ahimsai but perform forcible pulling of their hairs as dhigambhara monks and cause himsai to themselves. The nigamana (concluding , suming up) paasuram on Jainism goes in to more details about the doctrines of this Matham and its inconsistencies and contradictions . 178) Inconsistencies of doctrines **************************************** sonnAr tAmm sonnathu yelAm thuravOmyenRum sonnathuvE sonnathu alathu aahum yenRum siRiyanumAm periyanumAm seevan yenRu mannAthum mannumathum onRE yenRum vaiyamellAm vizhuhinRathu yenRum yenRum tennAdum vada naadum sirikka pEsum sina neRiyAr sinam yellAm sithaitthittOmE (Meaning): Jaina Matham's chief doctrine is that there is no Iswaran . TFor them , he ParamANus ( sub-atomic particles ) are the cause of the Universe.Every vasthu in this world consists of the duals of Sathyam-asathyam , bhEdham-abhEdham , nithyathvam-anithyathvam . They are made of dhvandhvams(duads) , which are polar opposites. If some one from other Matham points out that the acceptance of polar opposites of the kinds pointed above would lead to the acceptance of other dhvandhvams as well , then the Jains accept them all without objection. If some one says that their views are inconsistent with PramANams , then they point out there is no problem since they consider inconsistency as a guNam in vasthus.They say that what can be eaten and what can not be eaten among vasthus is one and the same. They say that the Jeevan will have the same size as one's body. They say that vasthus would be eternal (nithyam ) and at the same time evanescent (anithyam/limited life). They state that the Earth because of its weight is forever descending downwards . All of these strange beliefs and statements make them national laughing matter.We have rejected their doctrines(saptha bhangee Vaadham) in this adhikAram . 12. refute the BhAskara- Yaadhava Mathams ------------------------------------------- ( one of the BhEdha- AbhEdha Matham ). The detailed account of this matham as a group of FIVE MATHAMS and its refutation is housed in the 6th Chapter of SrImath Rahasya Thraya Saaram . Durign Jan 16, 1999 HH Prakrutham Azhagiya Singar gave a Tele-upanyAsam on the Subject that has been summarized by me in the Ahobila Matam Web pages: http://www.ahobilamutt.org/upan/jan1699 Please refer to this posting for details .

Pages 2 & 3 of the 7 page posting cover in detail the key aspects of BhEdhAbhEdham doctrines . adiyEn will summarize the content below. 179) Refutation of BhAskara-Yaadhava Matham *************************************** yEkAnthikam illai yenRu aasayau t-thAmuduppAr sOkAnthamAhat-thuRappunDa pinn thozhil vaidhikam yenRu EkAnthikaL sonna Isan padiyil vikaRpam yeNNUM lOkAntha VeeNar tamm vEdAntha Vaartthai vilakkuvamE (Meaning ): Jaina AchAryaas wear the directions as their dress ( they are naked). They were saying that there are no vasthus with the same svabhAvam. They became less sure about that declaration after hearing our criticisms of that concept in the earlier chapter . Sages VyAsa, ParAsara are the great ones , who established Brahma Svaroopam as firm and having the same nilai .In those doctrines established by Sages VyAsa and ParAsarar , the BhAskara-Yaahava matham followers create discord by suggesting BhEdham and abhEdham are in Brahman .They keep telling that their BhEdhAbhEdha doctrines are rooted in the VedAs and VedAntham.We will refute their Matham as unsound in this chapter . 180) Condemnation of the BhEdha-abhEdha Matham of Bhaskara-Yaadhava ************************************************************ onRenavum palavenavum thORRuhinRa ulahu yellAm oru Bhiramam tAnE aakki nanRu yenavum theethu yenavum pirintha yellAm nanRu anRu theethu yenRE yena navinRAr kanRum alar pasuvum alar aahi ninRE kanRAhi PasuvAhi ninRa vaNNam inRu maRai mAttukku ohr idayanAna yEkAnthi isayinthada nAmm iyambinOmE Introduction: ********** BhAskara Matham: Jeevan and Braman will stay united without any variations (BhEdham) .This kind of non-difference (abhEdham ) is natural for Brahman. The differences (BhEdham) from Brahaman for Jevans is thru the UpAthi of Buddhi, Indhriyam , SarIram et al. For the insentients ( achEthanam ) and Brahman , both BhEdham and abhEdham are natural manifestations. Yaadhava PrakAsa Matham: The bhEdham and abhEdham between Brahman and Jeevan as well as that between achEthanam and Brahman are natural manifestations(SvabhAvikam) of Brahman . Yaadhava Matham asserts that the Svaroopam of Brahaman has the capacity to transform in to chEthanams and achEthanams. BhAskara-Yaadhava (B-Y) Matham was a powerful Matham in their day . That was why Sudarsana Suri , the author of Srutha PrakAsikA , the author of the authoritative Commentary on AchArya RaamAnujA's SrI BhAshyam spent a lot of effort to refute the above doctrines of B-Y matham. BHEDHABHEDHAM LITERALLY MEANS IDENTITY IN DIFFERENCE. The authors of B-Y matham had elegant but illogical arguments to sustain this untenable position. How can there be Identity in difference ? Ultimately , as history tells us YaadhavaprAkAsa , one time AchAryan of SrI RaamAnujA surrendered his loyalty to B-Y matham and became a devout SishyA of VisishtAdhvaitham as developed by AchArya RaamAnujA . From the history of Philosophy , B-Y matham has to be looked at .The 180th Paasuram covers Swamy Desikan's refutation based on the views of his PoorvAchAryAs. Swamy Desikan refutes the central doctrine of B-Y Matham that the Svaroopam of Brahman transforms in to ChEthanam and achEthanam . VisishtAdhvaitham avers that the Svaroopam of Brahman is totally different from ChEthanams and achEthanams and the Brahama-ParinAma vAdham of B-Y matham is undefendable based on Saasthrams and Upanishads . Issues in B-Y Matham ***************** The issue centers on the explanation of the material causality of Brahman ? For reference , a lump of clay is the material cause (UpAdhana KaaraNam ) for an earthern pot . How does Brahman , whcih Upanishads assert as immutable transform in to the Universe ? How is the material casuality of Brahman accounted for without affecting the Svaroopam of Brahman ? B-Y Matham accounted for this by stating that Brahman itself transforms into the material universe .This is known as the Brahma PariNAma Vaadham . VisishtAdhvaithins connected Brahman with ChEthanam and AchEthanam (sentient/chith and insentient/achith) and held that the subtle form of assoication of Brahman with chith and achith ( Sookshma-chith-achith visihta form). The material causality of Brahman is explained through the Brahman becoming antharyAmi for all chith and achith while retaining its Svaroopam (with out any vikAram or changes) . VisishtAdhvaithin's position is therefore considered as a modified Brahma-PariNAma Vaadham . Adhvaithins hold their view on matrerial causality based on the illusory nature (MaayA) of the Universe. They believe that Brahman is the basis of the illusory appearance of the universe and links it to the material cause.Swamy Desikan classed this view as Vivartha Vaadham and dismissed both the Adhvaithin's and B-Y views following the doctrines of VisishtAdhvaitham elaborated by AchArya RaamAnujA. In YadhavaprakAsa's matham , Brahman has three fold power (sakthi) and transforms in to Chith , achith and Isvara sakthis. Brahman , which is BEING (SATH) transforms itslf in to a triadic form , while mintaining its svaroopam unchanged (abhEdham ) although its sakthi undergoes transformation (bhEdham ) . This matham of YaadhavaprakAsa was rejected by Swamy Desikan as unsound on the basis that the acceptance of bhEdham and abhEdham in one breath amounts to SELF-CONTRADICTION .This Aathmaikyam ( the identity of aathmA /ParamAthmA with prapancham (material universe) is thus rejected. The key words of this Paasuram are: \" OnRu yenavum pala yenavum thORRuhinRa ulaham yellAm oru Brahmam tAnE aaki \" (The whole world staying as one vasthu or as many vasthus in B-Y matham is viewed as being driven by BhEdhAbhEdham through Brahma PariNAma Vaadham). The Self-contradiction arising from this premise is pointed out by Swamy Desikan . 13. reject VyAkaraNa Matham ------------------------------- for accepting amsams(aspects ) of Adhvaitham , Yaadhava, Jaina and Bhouddha Mathams as the planks in its foundation. Swamy Desikan dismisses VyAkaraNa matham as Brahma Vivartha Vaadha matham . 181) chAyA maRaihaLil sattham teLinthida c-chARRutalAl thUyAr ivar yenRu tOnRa ninRE pala soothuhaLAna mAyA mathamum maRu sina vaathum bhavatthumum sEr vyAkaraNar sollum maRu mARRangaL mARRuvamE (Meaning ): VyAkaraNar came to be considered as the pious & pure ones because they established the precise ways to pronounce ( precise akshara , Svara , Matthirai pronunciation ) of Veda manthrams so that the meanings of these Veda Manthrams are not distorted through their VyAkaraNa Saasthram . Yet they have made their arguments about the superiority of their matham by adopting illogical doctrines from Adhvaitham , Jainism and Bhouddham. Their Vivarttha vAdha doctrines are suspect and therefore VyAkaraNa matham has to be rejected. What is this Vivarttham ? In the waterless desert , the hot Sun creates a mirage creating the appearance of floods and waves , which really do not exist. The phenomenon of one appearing as the other is known as Vivarttham. Adhvaithins hold that the Universe (Prapancham ) is the Vivarttham of Brahman . VyAkaraNa matham holds that there is a vasthu known as SphODam besides aksharam , word ( padham made up of aksharam ) and Svaram . That SphODam is attributed to produce meanings to Aksharam and Padhams and that SphODam is Brahman. The VyAkaraNars describe the entire Prapancham to be the vivarttham of that SphODam . Here they are close to Adhvaithins' vivarttha Vaadham views (Prapancham is a Vivarttham of Brahman) . Brahman never loses its svaroopam and is distinct from Prapancham ( Jeevans and insentients) according to VisishtAdhvaitham . BhAskara-Yaadhava Matham described derisively as Jaina VedAnthAm asserts that Brahmam transforms in to Prapancham and undergoes vikArams. Brahman gives up its svaroopam (thru the act of pariNAmam) to become some thing else (viz)., Prapancham according to this Matham .Some of the VyAkaraNar believe that sabdha roopa Brahman transforms in to Prapancham through the act of PariNAmam . Thus VyAkaraNar agrees with BhAskara-Yaadhava matham in the matter of adopting Brahma PariNAmam that has been rejected as untenable by VisihtAdhvaithins . One class of VyAkaraNar and BhouddhAs believe that the individual words constituting a sentence have their own meanings ( artha Jn~Anam about the Padhams forming the Vaakyams ) and the integrated use of these words /padhams create a Jn~Anam known as PrathibhA , which provides the true total meaning . Here , there is correlation between the two groups --Bhouddham and VyAkaraNam on one hand and VyAkaraNars on the other --and this is also unacceptable.. Swamy Desikan rejects the VyAkaraNa matham for borrowing the faulty doctrines of the three mathams that have been proven earlier to be unsound . 182) The delusion of the VyAkaraNars led by the nose by other Mathams ******************************************************** Kalahatthil kalangi varum kANikku yellAm kaNNARu sathira vazhi kattuvAr pOl ulahatthil maRai sErntha uraihaL tammAl oru pizhayum sErAmal ubhaharitthAr pala katthum Bhouddhar mudhalAna paNDaip- pahar kaLLar pahattazhikka paravum poyyAm sila kaRRu siddhAntham aRiyahillA c- chiRvar ini mayangAmal sEmitthOmE (Meaning ): In the case of ownership over the boundaries of a disputed land , it is customary to ask for the help of mediators (MadhyastharkaL) to intervene and resolve the disputations. The correct boundary agreed upon with the help of MadhyasthAs is known as \"KaNNARu \". Similarly , VyAkaraNar served as madhyasthAs to establish the true meanings of Veda Vaakyams using VyAkaraNa Saasthram . Inspite of this great help, VyAkaraNars fell for the ostentatious propaganda of BhouddhAs and accepted number of doctrines unique to Bhouddha Matham and were travelling on dangerous roads going no where.We (Swamy Desikan ) intervened and saved them from the dangers of the borrowed doctrines from Jainam , Bhouddham and adhvaitham. 14. reject KaNAtha Matham -------------------------- for creating concepts (padhArthams) not accepted by PramANam like Prathyaksham ; they also do not accept Iswaran as revealed by the sabdha pramANam of Vedam . They declare that the timeless Vedams were created by ordinary humans (PourushEyam ) instead of by the eternal Iswaran (apourushEyam ) . 183) kaNDathu alAthana kattuthalAl kaNDa vittathanAl paNDu uLathAna MaRaikkup-pazhamayai maaRRuthalAl koNDathum Isanaik-koLLA vahai yenRu kURuthalAl kaNDakarAy ninRa kaNAthar vAdham kazhaRRuvamE (Meaning ): KaNAtha Matham invented concepts that are not consistent with Prathyaksha PramANam .Some of these strange concepts are different from avayavam such as avayavee, SaamAnyam , VisEsham , SamavAyam , abhAvam et al . KaNAthAs also reject Tatthvams approved by the VedAs such as Prakruthi , MahAn et al. They accept Iswara tatthvam but reject Vedam as apourushEyam . They do not recoignize Iswaran as revealed by the eternal VedAs and accept Him as being revealed by the pramAnam of anumAnam (inference) alone. KaNAthAs are like thorn in the flesh and we (Swamy Desikan ) removed that thorn from the Vaidhika SiddhAnthams . 184) The strange doctrine of KaNAtham to explain Iswaran & Moksham ********************************************************** aagamatthai anumAnam yenkayAlum azhiyAtha maRai azhikka ninaitthathAlum bhOgam aRRu ohr upalam pOl kidakkai tAnE puNNiyarkku veedenRu puNartthalAlum maakam ottha MaNivaNNan padiyai mARRi maRRu avanukku ohru padiyai vahutthathAlum kAkam ottha KaaNAtan kaNNai vAngik- kAkkaikku aar yenRu alaRRak-kaattinOmE (Meaning): The KaNAthAs do not accept Sabdham as separate (independent) PramANam and bury it inside the pramANam of anumAnam .

They state that the state of Moksham enjoyed by the Jeevan is the state when it exists without any anubhavam like a stone without possessing any Jn~Anam or aanandham .They say that Iswaran is nimittha kAraNam ( like potter for a clay pot ) and not upAdhAna kAraNam ( like the clay ). They declare Iswaran , who is without any admixture with Prakruthi as one without SarIram (Suddha Satthva maya sarIram) and deny Him as possessing limitless bliss (aanandha mayan ).The KaNAthAs are like the crow , which committed huge apachAram to SithA PirAtti and lost its eye to the BrahmAsthram sent after it by Lord Raamachandran . We (Swamy Desikan ) have pulled out the eye (the doctrine ) of KaNAthan and made him cry with desperation about not having any place to resort to in this adhikAram through our refutation of his doctrines . 15. to assess Gouthama(NyAya ) Matham. -------------------------------------- He criticizes it for bending over backwards to reconcile its inconsistencies with some aspects of KaNAtha Matham . Swamy Desikan criticizes Gouthama matham for having some Soothrams that are inconsistent with the path shown by Brahma Soothrams . Swamy Desikan's rejection of the KaNAtha matham concepts were covered earlier . His objections on KaNAtha Matham were (1) nonacceptance of Sabdham as a valid PramANam (32) Treatement of Vedam as PourushEyam (composed by a mortal instead of being created by the eternal Lord ) and (3) Status of Jeevan in Moksham devoid of Jn~Anam and other guNams . Swamy Desikan accepts that NyAya matham as a Vaidhika Matham except for the above cited deficencies.He says that those defects could be removed and NyAya Matham can be made acceptable. He likens the effort to straighten out NyAya Matham to that of surgically removing the hunch from the hunchback with some effort . He says that an entirely new NyAya Saasthram can be created by accepting the portions consistent with VisishtAdhvaithic intrepretation of Brahma Soothrams and rejecting the objectionable portions . Swamy Desikan went ahead and created a SrI sookthi revered as NyAya Parisuddhi (Cleansification of Gouthama Matham ) on a three pronged approach to bring it back in to the fold of VedAntha Saasthrams .In summary , Swamy Desikan accepts NyAya Matham as an anukoola Matham and rejects KaNAtha Matham as a Prathikoola Matham.Swamy Desikan's position with respect to NyAya-VaisEshikA matham as well as any other Matham is that of a VisihtAdhvaithin upholding the Supreme authority of Sruthi (Vedam as unassailable PramANam) and taking positions that are not Veda Viruddham ( inconsistent with apourushEya Veda PramANams). Dr.V.Varadachary Swamy's summing up of the criticism of the NyAya theory is as follows: \" The concepts of Parts and whole based on AarambhavAdha is untenable (baseless). Swamy Desikan elaborates on the theory developed by VisishtAdhvaithins ( SathkAryavAdha) to defeat the NyAya developed theory on matter and its parts. Swamy Desikan also rejects the NyAya-VaisEshika views on the nature and function of sense organs and their views on the status of the soul in Moksham . 185) Criticism of Gouthama Matham ****************************** gOthama noolakLai kuRRam illA vahai koottalamumAm kOthu kazhitthoru kooRRil guNangaLaik-koLLavumAm yaathum ihanthu oru neethiyai yAmE vahukkavum vEdiyar nannaya vittharam yenpathu meyuLLatE (Meaning): It is possible to consider the doctrines of Gouthama Matham as not being totally inconsistent with Vedam (Veda VirOdham) with some corrections . It is also possible to remove those sections , which are Veda VirOdham and accept the rest . We can also reject the whole NyAya Matham and construct a new one , which is totally compatible with the Vedam .We can do that . Respecting the insight of Maharishis like Manu, who clearly understood the true meanings of VedAntham and gave support for the inclusion of NyAya Vistaram as one of the 14 VidhyA sthAnams , we accept the Gouthama matham ( elaboration of nyAya Vistharam ) as sathyam. We (Swamy Desikan ) have however straightened out the areas of inconsistencies with Veda PramANams , accepted the areas that are backed up by Veda PramANams and replaced the others with new NyAya soothrams , where they contradict Brahma Soothrams . 186) Three ways to make nyAya matham acceptable **************************************** nAnn maRaykkut-thuNayAha nallOr yeNNUm naaliraNDil onRAna naya nool tannil koon maRaithtal kOthu uLathu kazhitthan maRROr kONAtha kOthil vazhi vahuthalanRi Oon maRaitha uyir oLi pOl otthathu ovvAthu uyirillAk-kANatham uraittha yellAm vAnn maRaikka madi kOlum vaNNam yenROM maRRu ithaRkku maRu mARRam pEsuvArE (Meaning ): NyAya vistharam is accepted as one of the 14 vidhyA sthAnams used to intrepret the meaning of the four Vedams.The rest of the ten are the six angAs of the Vedams ( SikshA , VyAkaraNam , chandas, niruktham , jyOthisham and Kalpam ) , MeemAmsai, nyAya vistharam , PurANam and dharma sAsthram . Among these ten, PurANams and Dharma Saasthrams give the meanings of Vedams in a way and therefore are not strictly considered as direct helps to determine the meaning of the Vedams.Therefore the VidhyA SthAnams needed for the determination of the precise meanings of the VedAs are reduced to 8 from 10 . Among the 8 vidhyA sthAnams , NyAya vistharam focuses on pramANams like prathyaksham and objects experienced by prathyaksham in a brief manner. MeemAmsai dwells in depth on these pramANams. They (NyAya Vistharam and MeemAmsai ) fit thus in to an overall topic for examination of PramANams in brief and elaborate manner. This VidhyA sthAnam of nyAya vistharam was taught by Gouthama Maharishi through his nyAya soothrams . PramANams and the pramEyams explained by those pramANams form the content of the nyAya soothrams (Gouthamma matham). Swamy Desikan researched them and straightened out some areas , which were inconsistent with Vedam , Smruthi and Braham Soothram , removed some which could not be fixed to fit in to VedAntha Saasthrams . The results of this scholarly research took birth as Swamy Desikan's SrI sookthi revered as NyAya Parisuddhi .Swamy Desikan pointed out the mistakes made by Gouthama matham in its enthusiasm to unify its doctrines with those of KaNAtha Matham and deemphasis on the need to be aligned with the tenets of VedAntha Saasthams .Swamy Desikan refutes this misplaced enthusiasm on the part of nyAya matham of Gouthamar to bridge its doctrines to KaNAtha matham that has totally unacceptable doctrines (Vedam is pourushEyam , Jeevan in the state of Moksham is like a stone or wood without aanandha anubhavam et al) . Swamy Desikan concludes that there is no one , who will disagree with his analysis of treating Gouthama matham (after fixes ) as an anukoola matham and KaNAtha matham as a vipareetha matham that is not at all acceptable. 16. criticism of MeemAmsaka Matham ---------------------------------- 187) Criticism of the MeemAmsa Matham ********************************** Isanum maRRa aNangum ilathuyenRu yezhilnAnmaRayil pesiya nall vinayAl perum paazhukkuneer iraykkum neesarai neethikaLAl nigamAnthatthin nool vazhiyE mAsu il manam kodutthum maRu mARRangaL mARRuvamE (Meaning): MeemAmsakAs do not accept either the Lord or the other gods like Indhran. They believe that the Yaagams and Yaj~nams done by humans produce a vasthu known as apoorvam and that vasthu gives the phalans for those karmAs .They accept sabdham as the DEvathai . This creates a situaton in their matham , where the devathais have no sarIram , problem in acceptance of the havis by the dEvathai , enjoyment of that havis by the accepting devathai, granting fruits for the karmA performed and for the devathai to be at more than one place to particpate in more than one yaj~nam . The MemAmsakAs do not accept the existence of Iswaran , who is worshipped by all types of KarmAs and who grants the fruits for those kinds of worship . Instead , they create an insentient vasthu named apoorvam (PuNyams and Paapams), perform karmAs enjoined by the VedAs with pomp and expenditure of a lot of money , undergo a lot of physical sufferings (SarIra Sramam) . Their effort is like irrigating a desert region. It is futile and fruitless. We (Swamy Desikan ) will refute their foolish ways with appropriate Veda PramANams and help them understand their follies. 188) Poorva and Utthara MeemAmsais are one Saasthram only ************************************************** kanai kadal pOl oru neerAm sootthiratthai kavunthanayum irAhuvaium pOlak-kaNDu ninaivudanE nilait-tarumam ihanthu niRkkum neesar nilai nikai nADA vaNNam yeNI vinai paravu saiminiyAr vEda noolai vEdAntha nooludanE virahAl kOttha munai udaya muzhu mathi namm munivar sonna mozhi vazhiyE vazhi yenRu muyanRittOmE (Meaning) : Our SiddhAntham is to accept Poorva MeemAmsai, Utthara MeemAmsai as one vEdAntha Saasthram. Like the One ocean is called lower and upper ocean , the MeemAmsai, which is one sAsthram is nomenclatured as Poorva and Utthara MeemAmsais. Poorva MeemAmsai covers the KarmAs dealing with Bhagavath AarAdhanam . The Iswaran , who is worshipped by those KarmAs is the subject matter of Utthara MeemAmsai or Brahma KaaNDam . BhOdhAyanar , Swamy AaLavanthAr and AchArya RaamAnujA established this unifying classification and accepted the two MeemAmsais as belonging to one Saasthram. We follow this path recommended by these great intellectuals . The usage of the words in this Paasuram ( Kavanthanayum IrAhuvayum pOlE ) refers to the MeemAmsakAs calling Poorva MeemAmsam ( Karma KaaNDam) that does not accept Iswaran and only KarmAs as trunk without head ; they call Utthara MeemAmsam , which eschews KarmAs and talks only about Iswaran (Brahman ) as head without trunk. Raahu has head but no trunk; Kabhandhan of SrImath RaamAyaNam has no head but he has trunk only. Swamy Desikan gives these apt comparisons to describe the position of the MeemAmsakAs and goes on to assert that the united Poorva and Utthara MemAmsams are one Saasthram (body witha head) and that they can not be seperated . Swamy Desikan rejects Nireeswara MeemAmsakas , who extoll KarmAs over Iswaran with the rules of SaarIraka Saasthram . Swamy Desikan accepts the PoorvOtthara MeemAmsa Kramam. Swamy Desikan blessed us with two SrI Sookthis (sEswara MeemAmsa and MeemAmsa PaadhukA ) to establish the oneness of MeemAmsa instead of rigid separation of hte one Saasthram in to two MeemAmsa Saasthrams. 17. criticism of Saankhya Matham . ----------------------------------- The full title of this adhikAram (chapter) is NirIswara Saankya NirAkaraNAdhikAram. There are two Sankhya Mathams: sEswara Saankhya darsanam ( Theistic one) and nirIvara Saankhya Darsanam (atheistic one created by Sage Kapila). Saankhya KaarikA of Vaachaspathi Misra is a detailed statement on this atheistic Saankhya Darsanam .There are significant differences between VisishtAdhvaitha and SaankhyA darsanams. 189) Criticism of the Saankyaa Matham ********************************** mukkuNamAy ninRa moola prakruthikku azhiyA akkuNamaRRa aru tuNai athaRkku Isan illai ikkaNanaippadi Iyainthum yeNNil munn mutthi yennum pakkaNa veeNar pazham pahattaip-pazhuthAkkuvamE The two key doctrines of Saankhya darsanam are: (1) Prakruthi and (2) Jeevan.There is no Iswaran .Satthvam , Rajas and Tamas are not GuNams but dhravyams. When these three guNams are in exactly equal proportions , Prakruthi is called Moola Prakruthi (MP) ; it is eternal and is not destroyable . MP is enjoyed by the Jeevan . MP is pervasive everywhere(Vibhu). MP will always undergo changes. This is the prime cause for all other doctrines and transforms in to tatthvams like MahAn. Jeevan is eternal. It is also Vibhu since it is pervasively present everywhere. Jeevan is without any guNam.He is the embodiment of Jn~Anam.He ahs no activities. He stands apart from every SarIram. Prakruthi undergoes transformation as a result of Jeevan standing as support .Like a blind person walks with the help of a lame person , Prakruthi performs its duties with the help of Jeevan , which is Jn~Ana Svaroopan .Since the world's activities are accounted by Prakruthi and Jeevan, Sankhya darsanam denies the need for the Tattvam of Isan . Saankhya darsanam believes that one can earn mOksham , if one understands the twenty five tattvams ( Moola Prakruthi , MahAn , ahankAram , five bhUthams , five tanmAthrams , five Jn~AnEndhriyams , five karmEndhriyams , manas and jeevan. We (Swamy Desikan ) condemn the futile assertions about its doctrines which are like the brainless prattle of hunters in a hunter collony because of their lack of knowledge about Iswaran and DharmAdharmams . 190) Contradictions in Saankya Matham: Destruction is the Phalan **************************************************** Isan ilan yepathanAl yenRum seevar yengum uLar ilar uNarvai yenRavatthAl pAsamenum prakruthitannAl yenRum palamum ilai veedum ilai yennum paNN pAl kAsini neer mudhalaana kAriyangaL kacchapatthin kAl kai pOl yennum katthAl nAm isayA Saankhiyatthai nAduvArkkE (Meaning ): SaankhyAs deny the existence of Iswaran, who is celebrated by all the VedAs . They describe the Jeevan as Vibhu and without Jn~Anam in opposition to the Vedic view that Jeevan is aNu (atomic in size) and filled with Jn~Anam. First , they say that Jeevan's samsAric experineces and MOksham are directly linked to Prakruthi and next state some thing that is totally contradictory : Jeevan has no SamsAram and Moksham. Prakruthi alone has SamsAram and Moksham. SaankhyAs state that the dissolution of the universe and its being during PraLayam and the appearace of the Universe during Srushti Kaalam is like the shrinking and sntretching of tortoises' head in to its shell .They link the shrinking and expansion (sankuchitham and Vikasitham ) of the Tatthvams to the dissolution and creation of the Universe , which is not acceptable on the grounds of Veda PramANams. VisishtAdhvathins point out the need for Prakruthi being under the control of the Omniscient , Omnipotent Iswaran as controller of this insentient Prakruthi . Therefore they reject the NirIswara Vaadham of the SaankhyAs. There are differences of opinions on the Kaala Tatthvam between the two darsanams. Therefore says Swamy Desikan that he rejects the strange prattlings of SaankhyAs as being inconsistent with Veda and other PramANams . 18. criticism of Yoga Matham . ------------------------------- 191) Refutation of Yoga Matham ***************************** thAvib-bhuvnangaL thALiNai soottiya Tanthai unthip- p"
