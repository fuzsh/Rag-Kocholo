        "text": "Murugar or Kandhan is the Tamil God of war and victory.\n\nMurugar, considered as the son of Shiva and Parvathi.\n\nMurugar is considered the God of Tamil language and he is mentioned a lot in Sangam literature.\n\nMurugar has six shrines in Tamil Nadu, which are known as Arupadaiveedu.\n\nThe six abodes of Karthikeya are all in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe six sites (padaiveedu) in Tamil Nadu where Murugar sojourned while leading his armies are Palani, Swamimalai, Thiruparamkundram, Pazhamudirsolai, Thiruthani and Thiruchendur, the Arupadaiveedu.\n\nBalambika (also known as “Bala”) is a goddess of the Hindu religion, usually found in South India. Her name means “Goddess Of Knowledge”, or “Child Goddess”.\n\nBalambika is considered a child, and acts as one, but is said to bring true knowledge, education, wisdom, power and prosperity for a better life. She is sometimes called the goddess of children, and therefore, her temple was constructed to be devoted to children.\n\nVishnu, also known as Narayana and Hari, is one of the principal deities of Hinduism. He is the supreme being within Vaishnavism, one of the major traditions within contemporary Hinduism.\n\nVishnu is known as “The Preserver” within the Trimurti, the triple deity of supreme divinity that includes Brahma and Shiva. In Vaishnavism, Vishnu is the supreme being who creates, protects, and transforms the universe.\n\nWhenever the world is threatened with evil, chaos, and destructive forces, Vishnu descends in the form of an avatar (incarnation) to restore the cosmic order, and protect dharma."
