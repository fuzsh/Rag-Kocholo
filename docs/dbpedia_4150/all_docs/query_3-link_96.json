HIS REAL NAME IS ARYAN BHATTATHIRIPAD FROM MY HOMETOWN OF CALICUT — A VISITING PROFESSOR FROM KODUUNGALLUR UNIVERSITY ( MUZIRIS ) OWNED BY THE CALICUT KING ..\n\nBHATTATHIRIPADS ARE HE CREAMY LAYER OF NAMBOODIRIS WELL VERSED IN MATH AND ASTRONOMY..\n\nNAMBOODIRIS ARE HE CREAMY LAYER OF THIYYAS OF KERALA WELL VERSED IN SANSKRIT AND VEDA SMRITI ORAL ROUTE..\n\nARYAN NAMBOODIRIS WERE VISITING PROFESSORS AT TAXILA/ NALANDA/ SARASWATI DHAR / UNIVERSITY OF ALEXANDRIA ETC\n\nCHANAKYA WAS AN ARYAN NAMBOODIRI PROFESSOR AT TAXILA..\n\nhttps://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.com/2014/08/chanakya-taxila-university-professor.html\n\nAN ARYAN WAS RECOGNIZED BY HIS SPECIAL HAIRDO ( KUDUMI TO THE SIDE OF THE HEAD ) ..\n\nhttps://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.com/2013/09/sikha-kudumi-choti-open-flag-of.html\n\nARYAVARTA , BRAHMAVARTA AND BRAHMARISHIDESHA ARE ALL THE SAME…\n\nBRAHMAVARTA WAS THE VAST HOLY FOREST UNIVERSITY LAND WHERE THE BRAHMANAS ( PART 2 ) AND ARNYAKAS ( PART 3 ) OF VEDAS –TECHNICAL SECTIONS– WERE PENNED.. THIS IS MODERN MALABAR OR NORTH KERALA..\n\nThese two parts written in Sanskrit and Grantha lipi ( techinical volumes ) have been stolen by the white invader..\n\nIN KERALA ARYA VAIDYASALA IS A AYURVEDA HOSPITAL RUN BY ARYANS.. EVEN TODAY A NAMBOODIRI LODGE IN A TEMPLE TOWN IS CALLED ARYA BHAVAN.\n\nMANU SAID BHARAT IS THE LAND BETWEEN THE HOLY RIVER OF SARASWATI ( NORTH ) AND THE HOLY LAND OF BRAHMARISHIDESA ( SOUTH ) GIRDLED BY THE SEAS ON EITHER SIDE….\n\nLET ME QUOTE BHAGAWAD GITA CHAPTER 2 VERSE 2 , PENNED 6000 YEARS AGO..\n\nश्रीभगवानुवाच |कुतस्त्वा कश्मलमिदं विषमे समुपस्थितम् |अनार्यजुष्टमस्वर्ग्यमकीर्तिकरमर्जुन || 2||\n\nśhrī bhagavān uvāchakutastvā kaśhmalamidaṁ viṣhame samupasthitamanārya-juṣhṭamaswargyam akīrti-karam arjuna\n\nśhrī-bhagavān uvācha—the Supreme Lord said; kutaḥ—wherefrom; tvā—to you; kaśhmalam—delusion; idam—this; viṣhame—in this hour of peril; samupasthitam—overcome; anārya—CUNT OF THE FIRST ORDER ; juṣhṭam—practiced; aswargyam—which does not lead to the higher abodes; akīrti-karam—leading to disgrace; arjuna—Arjun\n\nTranslationBG 2.2: The Supreme Lord said: My dear Arjun, how has this delusion overcome you in this hour of peril? It is not befitting an NOBLE HIGHLY EVOLVED MAN. It leads not to the higher abodes, but to disgrace.\n\nTHIS IS 100% PROOF !\n\nManu wrote 10,300 years ago –“ All the people on earth should learn their respective practices from a ARYAN born in that land of Brahmarisihidesa ”..\n\nARYAVARTA ( PUNT/ SHEBA / OPHIR/ MALABAR/ ARYAVARTA / LAND OF GODS / BRAHMARISHIDESA ) WAS PART OF THE DANAVA CIVILIZATION-WHICH PRECEDED THE VEDIC CIVILISATION BY SEVERAL MILLINIUMS..\n\nEVEN TODAY KERALA IS KNOWN AS GODs OWN COUNTRY..\n\nhttps://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.com/2017/05/land-of-punt-ophir-and-sheba-is-north.html\n\nARYAVARTA IS THE CRADLE OF THIS PLANETs KNOWLEDGE ..\n\nCONTINUED TO 2-\n\nCapt. Ajit VadakayilFebruary 13, 2019 at 2:24 PM\n\nCONTINUED FROM 1–\n\nhttps://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.com/2016/10/eight-sided-pyramid-of-giza-egypt.html\n\nI AM FROM THE LAND OF ARAVARTA – MY GENOME SPEAKS TO ME..\n\nBrahmarshi-Desha or Aryavarta, is a model region of discipline and order, and that “from a ARYAN born in that region, all men on earth should receive their lessons in their respective duties and responsibilities.” (MBh. XIV, 110.47).\n\nThe Law Code of Manu mentions the Rig Veda many times, but the Rig Veda did not mention the Law Code of Manu even once.\n\nMANU WAS A SAGE FROM ARYAVARTA..\n\nThis is because Rig Veda went of oral route for 330 centuries before being penned down 70 centuries ago.. Manu made his laws 10,300 years ago.\n\nThe Law Code of Manu does not just mention the Rig Veda only in passing, but as the cornerstone of its civilization’s philosophical and spiritual thought.\n\nHAMMURABI LIFTED HIS LAWS WHOLE SALE FROM THE LAWS OF MANU ..\n\ncapt ajit vadakayil..\n\nSOMEONE CALLED ME UP AND SAID\n\nBILLIONS OF WORDS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE WORD “ARYAN” ON INTERNET AND IN BOOK.. IF YOU GOOGLE SEARCH THE WORD “ARYAN ” YOU GET 36 MILLION POSTS..\n\nYOU ARE THE FIRST AND ONLY PERSON ON THE PLANET TO GIVE THE CORRECT MEANING..\n\nINDEED —\n\nTHIS IS WHY I STARTED THIS BLOGSITE…\n\nAND I DONT EVEN CONSIDER THIS AS A REVELATION ..THIS BLOGSITE HAS MADE 10,000 REVELATIONS.. I HOLD IT AT THIS RESERVOIR LEVEL–I LET THE LIGHTER ONES OVERFLOW THE DAM WALL.\n\nTHE SAME READER WANTED TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THE WORD “BRAHMIN” . AFTER ALL TWITTER HEAD JACK DORSEY WANTED TO SMASH BRAHMINS..\n\nJACK DORSEY IS GUILTY OF INSULTING PM MODI.. HE WAS IMPROPERLY DRESSED …\n\nWHEN JACK DORSEY SAT TALKING TO PM MODI, IF HE HAD RAISED HIS LEG A BIT MORE HIS COWBOY BOOT WOULD HAVE GONE OVER HIS HEAD..\n\nIT IS NOT ABOUT THE MAN, IT IS ABOUT THE PM CHAIR.. TWITTER CEO JACK DORSEY HAS INSULTED INDIA AND WE INDIANS WONT FORGIVE HIM..\n\nIF THIS COCKY BASTARD WENT TO MEET THE ENGLISH QUEEN , HE WOULD HAVE CURTSIED LIKE A GIRL..\n\nIN ANCIENT INDIA THERE WERE FOUR VARNAS ..\n\nWE DID NOT HAVE A CASTE SYSTEM OF SHUDRAS TILL THE WHITE INVADER CAME TO INDIA AND USED MORE THAN A 1000 FAKE HINDU MUTTS TO INJECT POISON INTO THE SCRIPTURES.\n\nhttps://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.com/2011/07/untouchables-capt-ajit-vadakayil.html\n\nWE HAD 4 VARNAS–1) INTELLECTUALS ( THESE ARE NOT MERE PRIESTS )2) WARRIORS3) SKILLED LABOUR4) UNSKILLED LABOUR\n\nTHE KINGS OF ANCIENT INDIA WERE DRAWN FROM THE “WARRIOR CLASS”.. BRAHMINS COULD NOT BE KINGS ..\n\nTHIS RULE WAS BROKEN BY JEW ROTHSCHILD WHEN HE CONVERTED PALE EYED CHITPAVAN JEWS INTO BRAHMINS AND ALLOWED THESE PESHWAS TO RULE MAHARASHTRA AFTER EMPEROR SHAHU… SHIVAJI WAS A MAHAR..\n\nMAHARS WERE DEMOTED TO SHIT CLEANING SCAVENGERS ( UNTOUCHABLE CASTE SHUDRAS ) FROM RULING CLAN BY JEW ROTHSCHILD..\n\nSAME HAPPENED IN KERALA..

One who seeks happiness should become supremely content and self controlled, for happiness is rooted in contentment and its opposite is the root of unhappiness. – 4.11–4.12\n\n— Manusmriti\n\nAN ARYAN BRAHMIN IS NOT SOMEONE WHO WILL POUR MOLTEN LEAD INTO THE EARS OF A SUDRA AS PER FOUL PROPAGANDA OF THE WHITE INVADER..\n\nAjyesthaaso Akanisthaasa YeteSam Bhraataro Vaavrudhuh Soubhagaya- RigVeda, Mandala-5, Sukta-60, Mantra-5- (5000 BC)\n\n‘No one is superior or inferior; all are brothers; all should strive for the interest of all and progress collectively’.\n\nA BRAHMIN WILL TEACH HIS ART ONLY TO A MAN WHO IS AN ARYAN.

WHILE LAW OF MANU REFERRED TO VEDAS ..\n\nJust as a modern computer memory gets “backed-up” every day, the Brahmins (“brAhmaNa”) had to recite every day all that they had emorized, so as not to forget words, pronunciation and the rhythm –since everything they memorized had been reduced to a kind of “hymn” and was required to be chanted with a specially assigned metered rhythm..\n\nEach line of Vedas seems to have been so carefully thought out so as to contain not only what appears on first blush to be religious and spiritual prayers and stories, but upon further examination reveal information about history, geography, astronomy, astrology , philosophy and mathematics.\n\nMind you part 2 Brahmanas and part 3 Aranyakas were technical sections of Vedas and they have been stolen by the white invader..\n\nवेदोऽखिलो धर्ममूलं स्मृतिशीले च तद्विदाम् । आचारश्चैव साधूनामात्मनस्तुष्टिरेव च ॥\n\nTranslation : The whole Veda is the (first) source of the sacred law, next the tradition and the virtuous conduct of those who know the (Veda further), also the customs of holy men, and (finally) self-satisfaction (Atmana santushti).\n\nThe word DHARMA means: ” …that which is established or firm, steadfast decree, statute, ordinance, law, usage, practice, customary observance or prescribed conduct, duty; right, justice (often as a synonym ofpunishment; virtue, morality, religion, religious merit, good; holding to the law, doing one’s duty.\n\nThe word SHASTRA means” … an order, command, precept, rule; teaching, instruction, direction, advice, good counsel; any instrument of teaching, any manual or compendium ofrules, any book or treatise, any sacred book ..\n\nMANAVA DHARMA SHASTRA IS MANU SMRITI.\n\nबलं बलवतां चाहं कामरागविवर्जितम् |धर्माविरुद्धो भूतेषु कामोऽस्मि भरतर्षभ || 11|| Bhagawad Gita Chapter 7 Verse 11 –4000 BC\n\nbalaṁ balavatāṁ chāhaṁ kāma-rāga-vivarjitamdharmāviruddho bhūteṣhu KAMO smi bharatarṣhabha\n\nBG 7.11: O Arjuna, in strong persons, I am their dispassionate strength. I am DESIRABLE ACTIVITY not conflicting with dharma .\n\nREMEMBER – KAMA HAS NOTHING TO WITH SEX.. KAMA PURUSHARTHA IS “DESIRABLE ACTION”..\n\n‘Dharma’ is a special attribute of the conscious man . Bereft of ‘Dharma’, man is equal to animal.\n\nWhether the rules of Dharma that :1. Everyone should tell the truth;2. No one should indulge in violence against other living beings;3. No one should acquire illegitimate wealth;4. Every one should establish control over his senses;5. There should be purity in thought, speech and deed;6. Everyone should render service to other individuals;7. Every one should eschew selfishness and greed.8. The world should be regarded as one family.\n\nDharma has attributes like rationality, sense of duty, justice, peace, truthfulness, hospitality, kindness , respect, compassion, non-violence, rectitude, humanity, spirituality, fairness , patience, self restraint , tolerance, ethics, service to others, right to life , natural justice, virtue, morality, bonafide work and philanthropy. Dharma thus truly symbolises universal values of humanism and forms the basis of global ethics.\n\nManusmriti written by the ancient sage Manu, prescribes 10 essential rules for the observance of dharma: Patience (dhriti), forgiveness (kshama), piety or self control (dama), honesty (asteya), sanctity (shauch), control of senses (indraiya-nigrah), reason (dhi), knowledge or learning (vidya), truthfulness (satya) and absence of anger (krodha).\n\nManu further writes, “Non-violence, truth, non-coveting, purity of body and mind, control of senses are the essence of dharma”. Therefore dharmic laws govern not only the individual but all in society.\n\nManu further writes, “Nonviolence, truth, non-coveting, purity of body and mind, control of senses are the essence of Dharma”. Dharma thus is a code of conduct that is intended to secure both worldly joys and supreme happiness.\n\nTo act dharmically is, in essence, to act appropriately; what is appropriate is determined by the context in which the action is to be performed and who is performing it. A UNSKILLED varna is NOT expected to sacrifice his life when the country is in danger. He is NOT expected to do skilled labour or brainwork he is incapable of.\n\nNobody is a Shudra by birth.\n\nIf on my ship, my steward who could NOT pass his school exams want the same salary as I the Captain, he wants family carrying facility, he wants same comforts and space in his cabin –it is just wishful thinking. Mayawati cannot hope to snatch away the beauty contest crown from Aishwarya Rai, no matter how hard she tries. Sanatana Dharma is a pragmatic way of life..\n\nManu cautions everyone to have self -control, so that his mind does not act as the instigator for committing any sinful mental action which would inevitably lead to one or the other type of evil verbal actions or wicked bodily actions.\n\nA verse from Manusmriti:-\n\n“Satyam BruyatPriyamBruyat”Ma Bruyat Satyam Apriyam;PriyamCaNanrutam,BruyatEshaDharmahSanatanah;”\n\nTranslation: Speak truth in such a way that it should be pleasing to others. Never speak truth which is unpleasant to others. Never speak truth which might be pleasant. This is the path of eternal morality, Sanatana Dharma.\n\nMeaning: The main point is speaking truth which in one’s dharma. Speaking such truth tactfully which benefits others and is pleasant to listen.\n\nMANU XII 10-11 :- That man is called ‘Tridandin’ who has established three controls, on his mind viz., (i) Manodanda -control over his thoughts, (ii) Vakdanda -control over his speech and (iii) Kayadanda- control over his body.\n\nHe who exercises these three controls with respect to all created beings and wholly subdues desire and wrath, assuredly gains complete success in his life.\n\nManu calls upon man to use his conscience . His verseneeds every individual to establish an internal check, which alone is the guarantee for good conduct or to eschew bad conduct and not the fear of state police, which only makes a man to be more careful and secretive in committing offence. This internal check is what is meant by “God Fearing” as Atma (Soul) is God within the man. If man listens to his conscience he will not commit the sin.\n\nManu has gone into terrific detail. Few examples only – or it will run into hundreds of pages.\n\nMANU X-163 :-Asteya is the unterior motive or desire to secure wealth by illegitimate methods which makes a man corrupt, a cheat, a smuggler, a black marketeer, an exploiter, and makes even men in noble professions exploit the miseries of others to make more and more money in utter disregard to professional ethics. Therefore, it is very essential to ingrain in the heart and mind of every individual the desire not to indulge in ‘asteya’ i.e., acquiring wealth by illegitimate and immoral methods.\n\nShoucham : Manu commands every individual to maintain purity of thought, word and deed (Trikarana shuddi i.e., Kaya, Vacha, Manasa), which is also called Antaranga Shuddi (internal/mental purity) and Bahiranga Shuddi (external purity or purity in action).\n\nThis rule means absolute honesty in that there should be harmony in thought, word and deed of an individual. One should not think something in the mind, speak something else, and do entirely another thing. Hypocrisy is addressed here , which is so abundant in the west.\n\nIndriyanigraha: Manu wants every individual to have of control over his senses. Failing which the man will indulge in all types of illegal and immoral actions, being instigated by the one or more of the six inherent enemies (Arishadvargas). This lands himself as well as others in misery and loss of happiness.\n\nThe mere knowledge of the rules of Dharma, however does not make a man ‘Dharmishta’ i.e., a man acting always in conformity with Dharma. Therefore, Dharma has to be ingrained in the mind of every individual from child hood. It is a slow but a sure process. This process was called ‘Samskara’.\n\nMANUVI11-15:- Dharma protects those who protect it. Those who destroy Dharma get destroyed. Therefore, Dharma should not be destroyed so that we may not be destroyed as a consequence thereof.\n\nMANU-IX-3 :-The father protects the girl in her childhood, the husband protects her after marriage and her sons protect her in old age.\n\nMANU II-145 :- The acharya is more venerable than a Upadhyaya (teacher). Father is more venerable than an acharya. But the mother is more venerable than the father.\n\nMANU III-51-52 :-No father who knows (the law) must take even the smallest gratuity for his daughter; for a man who, through avarice, takes a gratuity, is a seller of his offspring.\n\nMANU Ch.IV-176: Discard wealth (artha) or desire (kama) if it is contrary to Dharma as also any custom or rules regarded as source of Dharma if at any time they were to lead to unhappiness or arouse people’s indignation.\n\nManu’s concept of gratitude (Kritajnata) included custom of worshipping animals, and plants as also Ayudha Pooja, i.e., worshipping one day in year all the implements or instruments through which we earn our lively hood.\n\nMANU SMRITHI -IX -101 and III-60 : -Mutual friendship and fidelity is the highest Dharma to be observed by husband and wife, throughout their life. The family in which husband and wife have mutual affection and respect always secures happiness and prosperity.\n\n(The West has 63% divorce rate. The balance 37% have had multiple sexual partners. Only the gays /dykes and the repulsively fat and ugly do NOT include in this 37% )\n\nMANU 4-239 -242 :-When one departs from this world to the other World, neither father nor mother, neither son nor wife will accompany him. Only the “Dharma” practiced by an individual follows him even after death. A person takes birth alone and dies alone, he alone enjoys or suffers the consequences of his evil deeds.\n\nअनुमन्‍ता विशसिता निहन्‍ता क्रयविक्रयी ।संस्‍कर्ता चोपहर्ता च खादकश्‍चेति घातका: ।। – मनुस्‍मृति ५.५१\n\nMeaning: One who promotes or supports non-vegetarianism, the butcher, one who sells or purchases meat, the one who cooks it, serves it or consumes it, are all destructive / vicious in nature.- Manusmritiय: अहिंसकानि भूतानि हिनस्‍ति आत्‍मसुखेच्‍छया ।स जीवंश्‍च मृतश्‍चैव न क्‍वचित्‌ सुखमेधते ।। – मनुस्‍मृति ५.५४\n\nMeaning: One who slaughters non-violent, helpless animals for his own happiness never attains happiness when alive and even after death.- Manusmriti\n\nयो बंधनवधक्‍लेशान्‍प्राणिनां न चिकीर्षति ।स सर्वस्‍य हितप्रेप्‍सु: सुखम्‌ अत्‍यंतम्‌ अश्‍नुते ।। – मनुस्‍मृति ५.४६\n\nMeaning: One who does not have a desire to shackle and slaughter animals, becomes the well-wisher of animals and acquires infinite happiness. Manusmriti\n\nManusmriti says that ahimsa is the foremost among the dharmas that are common to all. It is included in the yoga of mind control. Ahimsa means much more than non-injury or nn-violence ; it implies not doing harm to others even by thought or word.\n\nManu Smriti says – Yatra Naryastu Pujyante Ramante Tatra Devatah – “Where women are worshipped there the angels tread”.\n\nThis great law-giver of Hinduism and first lawgiver on this planet defined the status of a wife and her equal rights thus:1. If a wife dies, her husband may marry another wife. (Manu, Chapter V, Verse 168). If a husband dies, a wife may marry another husband. (Manu)2. If a wife becomes fallen by drunkenness or immorality her husband may marry another. (Manu, Chapter IX, Verse 80). If a husband becomes fallen, a wife may re-marry another husband.4. If a husband deserts his wife, she may marry another. (Manu, Chapter IX, Verse 76 )\n\n“Women must be honoured and adorned by their fathers, brothers, husbands, and brothers-in-law, who desire (their own) welfare” Manu Smriti Chapter III, Verse 55 -8200 BC\n\n“Where women are honoured, there the gods are pleased; but where they are not honoured, no sacred rite yields rewards “ Manu Smriti Chaptaer III, Verse 56 – 8200 BC\n\nUntouchability and caste-based discrimination were unknown during the Varnashrama days. No one was born high and no one low. You became what you are with your karma.\n\nA dimwit who cannot pass a single exam in school has no reason to write the IIT entrance exam and hope to get Computer Science stream.\n\nIt is easy to secure a job on quota but very difficult to hold on to it, unless you work for the useless and corrupt Indian government offices or town municipality office.\n\nIn the times of SEVERE ADVERSITY , ( war / famine ) Manusmriti recommends that a Brahmin may live by engaging in the occupations of the warrior class, or skilled labour class .. There has been times when brahmins picked up the sword as borne out by 6000 year old Mahabharata..\n\nA BRAHMIN IS NOT TO BE SLOTTED AND POTTED AS A NAPUNSAK “TATTU”..\n\nWE ASK GUJJU NO 2 PM MODI– DO NOT KEEP EXTOLLING THE VIRTUES OF ROTHSCHILDs AGENT GUJJU NO 1 GANDHI– AND DRY OUT THE KSHATRIYA BLOOD WHICH COURSES THROUGH THE VEINS OF HINDUS..\n\nWE ARE FROM THE LAND OF MIGHTY WARRIORS BHISHMA , KARNA , DRONA ETC ..\n\nMegasthenes, the great Greek historian has recorded two milleniums ago that there were four classes in Hindus and a Hindu of any class may become a Sophist (Brahmin).\n\nCaste hierarchy and privileges based on caste had no sanction in Sanatana Dharma -they are the direct result of the immoral white invader and their vested historians.\n\nThe very expression Dharma in Manusmriti is opposed to and inconsistent with any social inequality by birth . The relevant provisions of the Shruti (Vedas) leave no room for doubt that discrimination on the ground of birth or otherwise had no Vedic sanction; on the other hand such discrimination was plainly opposed to vedic injunction.\n\nDiscrimination of any kind is, therefore, contrary to Dharma. It is really Adharma. All discrimination in Hindu society was introduced by the white invader to divide and rule.\n\nSanatana Dharma respects the planet along with its flora and fauna. It is the only religion which advocates vegetarianism.\n\nManu wrote that polluting the environment was a punishable offence. In Manu’s laws a person could be ex-communicated from society for mindless felling of tree or killing of animals, the way the English speaking white man shot the buffalo and exterminated the Indian American , or how the Australian Aborigine race was exterminated..\n\nThe whole idea of Vaastu was to construct something without disturbing the flow of nature and interrupting natural flow of energy. It is about peaceful co-existence and comfort. Vaastu is about living in harmony with nature , grateful for her natural bounties.\n\nIt tells us not dominate and harass other living beings, have inherent grace and know your “duties”.. That human beings are just but a link in this symbiotic chain of life and consciousness\n\nSANATANA means ” that which holds eternal Vedic knowledge”– encompassing everything from microcosm to macrocosm. Dharma leads to eternal bliss, both in this world and the next. It is your sole and soul companion after death.\n\nDharma leads you on the path of self realisation. Dharma includes adhara or regulation of daily life as per your conscience and written Vedic laws.\n\nHinduism is a spiritual code. Know thyself is the quintessence. It has no founder or a Supreme head. There is NO supreme middleman like the Pope who can canonise a human into a saint, by hoodwinking the unsuspecting masses.\n\nIn Sanatana Dharma Rita is the principle of cosmic truth and order.\n\nIn the 7000 year old Rig Veda there is a remarkable insight on the notion of Rita, the inflexible law of universal order and harmony whereby all disorders and chaos is restored to equilibrium.\n\nRita is, in essence, the ordering principle of nature which gives to everything from the vast galaxies, down to the nucleus of an atom, their nature and course.\n\nIn the Vedic vision, this law of cosmic order is conceived to be manifesting at three levels: on the cosmic plane Rita governs the course of nature; on the socio-ethical level, Rita imparts justice; and on the religio-spiritual level.\n\nThough originally understood as a subordinate component of the essentially metaphysical concept of Ṛita, Dharma eventually grew to overshadow. Ṛita remained largely confined to the Vedas, and most Hindus don’t even know the meaning of Rita. .\n\nA central concept of the Ṛigveda is that created beings fulfil their true natures when they follow the path set for them by the ordinances of Ṛita, and failing to follow those divine ordinances was thought to be responsible for the appearance of various forms of calamity and suffering . A man who follows the ordinances of nature ( universal laws ) can be described as one who acts according to the “Dharma of Ṛita”.\n\nDharma, was originally conceived of as a manifestation of Ṛita inasmuch as it represents that aspect of the universal Order which specifically concerns the mundane natural, religious, social and moral spheres as expressed in ritualistic regulations, public laws, moral principles and laws of nature. . Rita, gives order to the universe and shows the righteous path for the mind to follow.\n\nṚita can be abstract concepts such as “law”, “order”,, “truth”, and “regularity”. It can also be concrete objects such as the waters, aakasha ( ether ) or the sun as manifestations of the operation of Ṛita in the cosmos.\n\nIndia is widely recognized at the last place on earth where spirituality still exists. Even the western thinkers agree that a chapter which had a Western beginning will have to have an Indian ending if it is not to end in self-destruction of the human race.\n\nAt this supremely dangerous moment in human history the only way of salvation for the mankind is an Indian way – Arnold Toynbee\n\nIn times of confusion and crisis regarding what is right and what is wrong, one’s own conscience is the sole guide.\n\nTHE CASTE SYSTEM IN INDIA WAS POISON INJECTED BY THE IMMOTAL WHITE CHRISTIAN INVADER TO DIVIDE AND RULE , AND TO CONVERT FRUSTRATED LOW CASTES INTO CHRISTIANITY.\n\nJEW ROTHSCHILD USED HS AGENTS BR AMBEDKAR AND EVR PERIYAR..\n\nUNKNOWN TO ALL BR AMBEDKAR WAS A ROTHSCHILD SPONSORED STAR KID\n\nhttps://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.com/2015/10/the-only-dalit-freemason-of-india-capt.html\n\nJUST READ AND ENJOY KHALISTANIS RUNNING DOWN HINDUISM — BRANDING MANU AS A BAAAAAAD EVIL TYRANT..\n\nhttp://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Manu_Smriti_on_Shudras\n\nThe ten Vishnu Avatars are:\n\n1.

Kalki (the mighty warrior)–the FINAL avatar\n\nVISHNUs FIRST AVATAR SET THE PLANET TO THE FREQUENCY OF OM, THE HINDU KING MANTRA , AT 7.83 HERTZ.\n\nhttps://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.com/2013/05/vishnu-first-matysa-avatar-dolphins-and.html\n\nEVERY SANSKRIT MANTRA STARTS AND ENDS WITH OM\n\nThe human brain in a healthy state oscillates at 7.83 Hertz. People who go for Sabarimala pilgrimage get their brains formatted to the correct frequency by PRATIPRASAVA – the klesha seeds are burnt (dagdha bija)– by Prati Prasava by accessing the deep hidden negative memories of the past this and previous lifetimes.\n\nThese memories remain hidden deep in the subconscious mind though ‘forgotten’ by the conscious mind that are the root causes of our negative reactions, habits, and actions that cause more karmic, thus falling into the endless loop of cause and effect. By Prati Prasav Sadhna we can dissolve fears, phobias, sufferings, limitations and awakening of your consciousness towards infinite dimension\n\nEverything is made out of energy. What appears to be solid is made up of vibrating particles, atoms and molecules. This includes human beings.\n\nSince life began, the Earth has been surrounding and protecting all living things with a natural frequency pulsation of 7.83 Hz—the ancient Indian Rishis called OM. Jews converted it to SHALOM.. Christians converted it to AMEN.. Muslims converted it to 786, which is drawing the symbol of OM on a paper , shwing it to the mirror and then reading it from right to left..\n\nThe Earth behaves like a gigantic electric circuit. Its electromagnetic field surrounds and protects all living things with a natural frequency pulsation of 7.83 hertz\n\nOM frequency, 7.83 Hertz –is the electromagnetic matrix for all life on this planet, the frequency at which all life forms have developed and, the prevailing electromagnetic frequency at which all life took place.\n\n7.83 hertz is the frequency of OM which is heard by the heart.. The human ear cannot hear sounds of less than 20 Hz.. . The sound of the conch is of frequency 7.83 hertz— this is the frequency of planet earth\n\nAlpha brain Frequency of 7.83 Hz on the EEG, has been lifted by the white man to be known as Schumann’s Resonance . Winfried Otto Schumann predicted it mathematically in 1952 by doing reverse engineering..\n\nResonances of earth, ie, 7.83, 13.7, 19.6, 25.5, 31.4, 37.3 and 43.2 Hertz of earth. We all know 7.83 hz being the strongest of all, OM or Schumann frequency.\n\nOhm- 7.83HzGam – 13.7HzHleem – 19.6HzHreem – 25.5HzKleem – 31.4HzKrowm – 37.3HzSreem – 43.2Hz\n\nThe Schumann Resonances are the result of cosmic energy build-up within the cavity that exists between Earth’s highly conductive surface and the conducting layer in the upper atmosphere called the ionosphere. the space between the surface of the earth and the conductive ionosphere acts as a waveguide.\n\nThe cavity is naturally excited by energy from lightning strikes. This ionospheric charge creates an electrical shield around the Earth.. The atmosphere is a dielectric insulator, which separates the two. Thus a spherical capacitor as well as a spherical resonator is created and maintained.\n\nElectrical signals of sufficient wavelength (low frequency) are wave-guided around and around between this “sphere within a sphere” and is the base Schumann Resonance of 7.8Hz mainly traveling from West to East.\n\n7.83 hertz is also the human brain’s average alpha frequency in electroencephalography. 7.83 Hz or the ALPHA frequency is the gateway that leads into deeper states of consciousness. Among the five main categories of brain waves, alpha waves, which stand in the middle of the scale, induce relaxation but not quite meditation — a state where we begin to tap into the wealth of creativity that lies just below our conscious awareness.\n\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is an electrophysiological monitoring method to record electrical activity of the brain. It is typically noninvasive, with the electrodes placed along the scalp, although invasive electrodes are sometimes used such as in electrocorticography.\n\nMost people are in an alpha state during the short time immediately before they fall asleep and when the conscious nervous system switches over to the subconscious.\n\nFor thousands of years the Schumann Resonance or pulse (heartbeat) of Earth has been 7.83 cycles per second, recently due to military ELF waves from HAARP , GWEN and Woodpecker, this resonance has been slowly rising.\n\nNikola Tesla transmitted scalar waves mainly through the Earth, and Hertz waves between ground and the Heaviside layer, and found the resonant frequency of Earth of 7.83 Hz.\n\nThe one sided use of Schumann (YANG) wave simulation without the geomagnetic (YIN) signal caused serious health problems. An underground bunker which completely screened out magnetic fields. suffered emotional distress and migraine headaches. After only a brief exposure to 7.8 Hz (the very frequency which had been screened out), the volunteers health stabilized again.\n\nThe same complaints were reported by the first astronauts and cosmonauts, who, out in space, also were no longer exposed to the Schumann waves. Now modern spacecrafts are contain a device which simulates the Schumann waves. by producing a 7.83 Hz pulse with a field generator (Schumann device), we can counter the effects of the irritating man-made fields.\n\nSAMUDRA MANTHAN ( CHURNING OF THE COSMIC OCEAN ) WAS DONE ON VISHNUs SECOND AVATAR THE KURMA ( TORTOISE ) USING MOUNT MERU …\n\nTHIS EFFORT GAVE US RAHU AND KETU OF ASTROLOGY AND GOLDEN MEAN 1.618.\n\nWe ( souls ) are all the inhabitants of the shadow planet where Rahu and Ketu are NORTH and SOUTH poles .

His favourite queen Kaikeyi was on the horse chariot with him. Dasaratha was injured , and the wheel of his chariot was about to be dislodged due to a missing cotter pin .\n\nQueen Kaikeyi put her finger into the orifice suffering great pain. In addition to this , as soon a Dasaratha became unconscious she drove the chariot away from the battle field and saved the king.\n\nLater when Dasharatha came to know what transpired , he gave his wife two boons . She said that she would redeem the boon at a later date and time.\n\nYears passed . Lord Rama being the eldest son was crown prince and Dasarath wanted to hand over his kingdom to Rama and then retire for sanyas. Queen Kaikeyi’s son Bharata was away in another city. The city of Ayodha was being decorated for the huge event as the people loved prince Rama.\n\nThe shrewd hump backed maid Mandara of Kaikeyi poisoned her mind. She reminded Kaikeyi of the two boons which the King had given her, and told her that she must redeem it now. She must ask that her son Bharat must be crowned king and his elder half brother Rama , son of eldest queen Kausalya must be banished to a far away forest on exile for 14 years.\n\nQueen Kaikeyi approached King Dasaratha and reminded him of his promise . Then she told him what she wanted. The king was in a bind . He had to follow his dharma of not breaking a promise. Out of sheer grief he fell dead.\n\nRama did the last rites for his father and went away of exile with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshman . It was the dharma of both his wife and brother to be with him . The whole city of Ayodha was in gloom.\n\nMeanwhile Bharata had a bad dream and a premonition . He came rushing back to Ayodhya. He knew something was wrong as the whole city of Ayodhya was in mourning and darkness. When he heard that his father is dead and his brother Rama was in exile, he fainted out of grief.\n\nWhen he came to, he gave a piece of his mind to his mother Kaikeyi and went to Rama’s mother Kausalya’s room and slept at her feet.\n\nNext morning with the queen mothers, his brother Shatrughna , priests, ministers and a small army , he set off to the forest to bring his brother back to Ayodhya and crown him king. Maharishi Bharadwaja directed him to the cottage where Rama would be with his wife Sita and brother Lakshman.\n\nBoth Rama and Bharat hugged each other . Bharat fell at his elder brother Rama’s feet and implored him to come back to Ayodhya and become king. Kaikeyi apologized and took back her boon.\n\nRama did NOT want to break his dharma of obeying his dead father’s command. Bharat then asked Rama to give him his sandals and said till Rama comes back after 14 years his sandals would be on the throne and that he would rule on Rama’s behalf from outside the palace , from Nandigram.\n\nAfter 14 long years when Hanuman broke the news of Rama’s impending return to Ayodhya , Bharat again fainted with joy—this time around. He showered Hanuman with gifts for the good tidings and commanded his brother Shatrughna to have the people decorate Ayodhya city .\n\nThe two brothers met and hugged each other, after which, Bharat led him to the throne on which was placed Rama’s sandals. Rama was crowned king and there was great joy. Rama made Bharat his crown prince.\n\nAt Rama’s command, Bharat and his sons went to the Gandhar kingdom and defeated the Gandharvas living there. Bharat founded the two capital cities of Takshashila and Pushkalavat in the conquered kingdom and established his sons, Taksh and Pushkal as its rulers.\n\nThis was the Hindu dharma. Dharma broadly means righteousness. Our scriptures and history is full of such sacrifices to sustain dharma.\n\nAiswarya rFebruary 16, 2019 at 1:10 PMSir,\n\nhttps://reclaimtemples.com/restarting-centuries-old-hindu-festival-of-kerala/\n\nMaghamakam ritual at tirunavaya restarted.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@subhashkak1/is-indias-strategic-plan-for-ai-credible-4edf09bfb3f1\n\nNeed of the hour is indigenous STEM research.

The South Node Ketu is like anti-matter in a natal chart.\n\nMY WIFE AND ALMOST ALL ANCIENT FAMILIES IN KERALA CONSULT THE RAHU KALAM CHART BEFORE WE DO SOMETHING CRITICAL.\n\nhe Moon (Chandra) completes its orbit round the earth in about a month crossing the orbit of earth twice in the same period, once when it goes from south to north and at another time while travelling from north to south.\n\nThe ascending point is called “Rahu” and descending point – “Ketu”. These have retrograde motion in the zodiac at the rate of 19°20′ per year.\n\nIt has been established beyond doubt that Rahu and Ketu influence an individual’s life, at times more than other planets.\n\nSince Rahu and Ketu are in exact opposition to each other, their effect should be considered simultaneously.\n\nRahu has the properties of Shani (Saturn) whereas Ketu has the influence of Mangala (Mars)\n\nThey indicate the precise point of the harmony with the three most important influences in our life- the Sun, the Earth and the Moon. This relationship plays an important part in the enfolding of individual consciousness.\n\nTheir role as Karmic indicators of our life is connected with their power to cause eclipses.\n\nThe eclipses occur in the vicinity of Rahu Ketu during the Full Moon and the New Moon. (During New Moon when it is +/- 18 degrees from Rahu Ketu, the Solar eclipse takes place. At the full Moon +/- 11 degrees 15′ from the nodal position, the Lunar eclipse takes place.)\n\nAs they symbolically eclipse the Sun (consciousness) and the Moon (the Mind), they have a great part to play in darkening our perspective in order to bring in new light. They deal with the concept of death and re-birth, transformation and regeneration.\n\nThey have been given the status of planets to emphasise their significance and the importance placed on eclipses.\n\nThey have no substance and are physically non-existent. Yet their influence is full of potency and spiritual significance.\n\nThey work in unison 180 degrees apart, two opposite points in the zodiac with a mission to churn our lives in order to externalise hidden potential and wisdom. In keeping with their shadowy nature, they work on a psychological level.\n\nIt is always difficult to gauge their effect because their main concern is with our emotional makeup. They effect us internally. We are unaware of what exactly is happening to us at the time..\n\nThe five instincts that keep us attached to the materialistic purpose of life are Kaam (Desire, passions) Krodh (Anger) Madh (intoxicants- drugs, alcohol etc) Moh (Attachment) Lobh(Greed) and Matsaya(Jealousy).\n\nWe need to control our instincts rather than allowing ourselves to be controlled by them. Both Rahu and Ketu have the ability to keep our mind focused on these instincts- Rahu by exaggerating and Ketu by obscuring or blocking.\n\nWe are tied down to the cycle of unhappiness and dissatisfaction as we cannot break away from our lower selves. We are born again and again to experience the pleasures and pains of the earthly life until we recognise them to be the illusions that they are.\n\nRahu Ketu deals with the inner fight within us, the moral and the social choices we have to constantly make and the inner dilemmas.\n\nCONTINUED TO 2–Capt. Ajit VadakayilFebruary 16, 2019 at 5:27 PMCONTINUED FROM 1–\n\nRahu takes people off their Dharmic past path to tempt them on the road of self destruction. Ketu is considered the keeper of the book of our life- past and present Karmas.\n\nWhen all the planets are hemmed between Rahu and Ketu (i.e., the moon’s north node and the moon’s south node), Kaalsarpa YOGAM ( not dosham ) is formed.\n\nKalasarpa yogam is a karmic dosha that may run across the generations—bad luck galore .\n\nPeople go for Kalsarpa Shanti Pooja to Trimbakeshwar Temple at Nasik .\n\nRAHU AND KETU IS MAJOR PART OF KERALA ASTROLOGY. WE DON’T USE URANUS , NEPTUNE AND PLUTO AS THESE PLANETS STAY IN ONE SINGLE RASHI FOR TOO LOG AND ARE TOO FAR AWAY. WE USE RAHU/ KETU/ MOON INSTEAD ..\n\nA lunar eclipse happens when the Earth, sun and moon align in space, with Earth in between the sun and moon. At such times, Earth’s shadow falls on the full moon, causing a lunar eclipse.\n\nA solar eclipse happens at the opposite phase of the moon – new moon – when the moon passes between the sun and Earth. Why aren’t there eclipses at every full and new moon?\n\nThe moon takes about a month to orbit around the Earth. If the moon orbited in the same plane as the ecliptic – Earth’s orbital plane – we would have two eclipses every month. There’d be an eclipse of the moon at every full moon. And, two weeks later, there’d be an eclipse of the sun at new moon for a total of at least 24 eclipses every year.\n\nBut the moon’s orbit is inclined to Earth’s orbit by about 5 degrees. Twice a month the moon intersects the ecliptic – Earth’s orbital plane – at points called nodes. If the moon is going from south to north in its orbit, it’s called an ascending node.\n\nIf the moon is going from north to south, it’s a descending node. If the full moon or new moon is appreciably close to one of these nodes, then an eclipse is not only possible – but inevitable.\n\nSolar and lunar eclipses always come in pairs, with one following the other in a period of one fortnight (approximately two weeks). For example, in 2017, the descending node partial lunar eclipse on August 7-8 was followed by an ascending node total solar eclipse on August 21.\n\nAgain, the lunar nodes are the orbital nodes of the Moon, that is, the points where the orbit of the Moon crosses the ecliptic. The ascending or north node is where the moon crosses from south of the ecliptic to north of the ecliptic. The descending or south node is where it crosses from north of the ecliptic to south of the ecliptic.\n\nEclipses occur only near the lunar nodes: Solar eclipses occur when the passage of the Moon through a node coincides with the new moon; lunar eclipses occur when passage coincides with the full moon. A lunar eclipse may occur if there is a full moon within 11° 38′ (Celestial Longitude), of a node, and a solar eclipse may occur if there is a new moon within 17° 25′ of a node.\n\nThe plane of the lunar orbit precesses in space and hence the lunar nodes precess around the ecliptic, completing a revolution (called a draconic or nodal period) in 6798.3835 days or 18.612958 years (note that this is not the same length as a saros). The same cycle, measured against an inertial frame of reference such as ICRS (relative to the stars) is 18.599525 years.\n\nThe two solar eclipses in July 2000 (Solar eclipse of July 1, 2000 and Solar eclipse of July 31, 2000) were around the time that the moon was at its ascending node. Ascending-node eclipses recur after one draconic year on average, which is about 0.94901 Gregorian years, and the same goes for descending-node eclipses.\n\nThe ascending node is referred to as RAHU its symbol is U+260A.svg. The descending node is called KETU and its symbol is the inversion of that of the ascending node: U+260B.svg.\n\nCONTINUED TO 3-Capt. Ajit VadakayilFebruary 16, 2019 at 5:29 PMCONTINUED FROM 2–\n\nThe lunar orbit is inclined by about 5.1 degrees to the ecliptic: hence the Moon can be up to about 5 degrees north or south of the ecliptic. The ecliptic is inclined by about 23.4° to the celestial equator, the plane that is perpendicular to the rotational axis of the Earth.\n\nAs a consequence, once during the 18.6-year nodal period, when the ascending node of the Moon’s orbit coincides with the vernal equinox, then the Moon reaches extreme northern and southern declinations. Then it also has its extreme northern and southern azimuth points of rising and setting on the horizon; its extreme lowest and highest altitude when crossing the meridian; and potentially extreme late first sightings of the new moon.\n\nFurthermore, occultations by the Moon of the star group the Pleiades ( Karthika ) , which are over 4° North of the ecliptic, occur during a comparatively brief period once every nodal period.\n\nThe constellation of Karthika are the Pleiades, the Seven Sisters in the Western. In the Indian they are the seven wives of the Sapta Rishis !\n\nTHE JNU COMMIES AND LITERARY FEST DROHIS RIDICULED THAT LORD SHIVA WAS CREWING THE WIVES OF THE SAPT RISHIS WHILE THEY WERE MEDITATING IN DEODHAR FOREST –SHIVA USED TO WALK WITH HIS ERECT PRICK OUT AND THE HRNY WOVES WOULD RUN AFTER HIM SHEDDING THEIR CLOTHES.

They do not own any signs, but they do own nakshatras.\n\nIn Indian astrology the lunar nodes, known as Rahu and Ketu, have special powers in a rashi chart. Often referred to as our karmic destiny, they indicate our greatest gifts and our darkest issues.\n\nIn prediction they are where the annual eclipses fall, and indicate the areas of our life that involve the most transformation for that year.\n\nWhen the lunar nodes are combined with another planet they take on the quality of that planet. Each combination will produce very different results.\n\nThe Moon’s orbit around the Earth intersects the ecliptic ( sun’s path ) at two points. These two points are the nodes of the Moon. The north node of the Moon (Rahu) is where the Moon crosses from south to north, called the ascending node. This symbolizes the birth into the material manifestation.\n\nThe south node (Ketu) is where the Moon crosses from north to south, called the descending node. This symbolizes our leaving the material plane for the spiritual realm.\n\nSo Rahu takes us into the physical world and Ketu takes us out of it.\n\nWe ( souls ) are all the inhabitants of the shadow planet where Rahu and Ketu are NORTH and SOUTH poles .\n\nIt represents the earth on the rashi chart .\n\nRahu and Ketu are the indicators of destiny and fate, symbolizing our entrapment in this physical plane.\n\nThese shadow planets control us by our desires. Our desires are our karmas. Our destiny is to release the chains this world has cast upon us. It is like the serpent’s bite. The poisonous venom intoxicates us into this world.\n\nRahu takes us under its spell with the illusions of this world, the promise of happiness, leaving us with a sense of wanting: “If I could only have more of the things that give me pleasure”. But of course, this only leads to insatiable desires. We can never have enough. This is the venomous bite of Rahu.\n\nBelow: 54 devas and 54 Danavas ( I am a Danava ) or asuras churned the cosmic ocean to obtain amrit or ambrosia. This represents OM –whose digital value is 108 and geometry shape is the Sri Yantra , which contains the theory of everything https://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2016/12/108-numerical-equivalent-of-hindu-king.html\n\nConversely Ketu strips us of the objects of our desires, revealing that nothing in this world gives us security and permanence. It is essentially the process of enlightenment, when we come to realize that ultimately, it is all an illusion. Nothing of this material world lasts, therefore; it is all an illusion or Maya.\n\nKetu is the bringer of enlightenment through the realization of this truth. Ketu is the release of this world.The strength of Rahu and Ketu when compared to other planets is very high by thousands of times or more.\n\nIf Rahu is well-placed in a horoscope, it will bring power and material success. If it is not well-disposed, it can cause alot of problems. One may expect professional setbacks, loss of work and friends, and the possible break-up of a marriage during its major and sub-periods. Rahu is said to give similar effects as Saturn.\n\nIf Ketu well-placed, it will works towards providing knowledge and moksha, the final liberation from cycle of birth and death. A poorly disposed Ketu can also create total chaos. There may be monetary setbacks,personal unhappiness or a feeling of alienation, which can even result in withdrawal from materialistic life. It is said to produce the same effects as Mars.\n\nThe nodal points of the Moon, what we call Rahu and Ketu, are infact, clubs of magnetic and gravitational forces of two celestial bodies, the Moon and Earth and hence are very influential upon the life of mankind.\n\nThese points Affect our central nervous system as well as sympathetic and para sympathetic nervous system, which work on the principles of electromagnetic systems. Nodal points (Rahu and Ketu) are psychosomatic, which govern not only stress level of our mind, but also the activities of hormones, blood circulation and function of the heart.\n\nRahu is the immature child with in us, he want everything which he like. He is our deepest subconscious material desire. Rahu is obsession over the things that we need to learn a soul lesson in this life, so that eventually we are free of them, but usually through many painful mistakes and subconscious imagined fears, hypnotic attachments.\n\nKetu is the inner parent who knows everything. Ketu is our past life experience which we already know. This is why Ketu brings doubt and sharp criticism to the areas of life where he sitting in the birth chart. He is eternally unsatisfied, he only observe what missing.\n\nBoth Nodes are the illusion of what we don’t know and what we know. It is the push and pull of Rahuobsession and Ketu doubt teaches us the lesson of life so that we can liberate from this world and be one/merge with universes.\n\nPariharasthalam ( to alleviate ) – Sacred Shrines of Rahu and Ketu\n\nWorship at any of the temples mentioned below can reduce the intensity of the problems arise from Sarpa dosha- Sri Nageshwara temple, Thirunagesswaram- Mannarsala in Kerala- Kukke Subramanya temple, Karnataka\n\nThe best day on which the remedies for Sarpa dosha be performed are Nagapanchami day, the day before the Maha Shivaratri.\n\nCapt.

Microtubules are quantum devices that are orchestrating our conscious awareness.\n\nMicrotubules are bio-electrochemical transistors that form nonlinear electrical transmission lines.\n\nQuantum entanglement and coherence are two fundamental features of nature, arising from the superposition principle of quantum mechanics..\n\nStructures inside brain neurons called microtubules act as sources of laser-like coherence for the brain’s vibrational hierarchy. Microtubules and axional membranes are also hollow cylinders.\n\nThe brain processes and stores information holographically as a massively parallel processing and associative computer system.\n\nConsciousness is a universal attribute of creation. BrahmAn ( the Hindu god ) is the field of morphogenetic consciousness.\n\nThe conscious human brain is like an grand symphony orchestra, a multi-scalar vibrational resonance system, than a computer..\n\nBrain information patterns repeat over spatiotemporal scales in fractal-like, nested hierarchies of neuronal networks, with resonances and interference beats.\n\nVedas say that brain is a HOLOGRAPHIC STORAGE device…\n\nThis model allows for important aspects of human consciousness, including the fast associative memory that allows for connections between different pieces of stored information and the non-locality of memory storage (a specific memory is not stored in a specific location, i.e. a certain neuron) device..\n\nIn a hologram, any part of the hologram with sufficient size contains the whole of the stored information. In this theory, a piece of a long-term memory is similarly distributed over a dendritic arbor so that each part of the dendritic network contains all the information stored over the entire network\n\nHolographic processing is accomplished with the brain acting as a phase conjugating device (e.g. a phase gate) which is type of logic circuit where the inputs are sensitive to the phase of the input signal producing..\n\nA laser hologram is that it exhibits the distributive property. This means that even a small part of an entire holographic record contains the entire record of the recorded image .\n\nConsciousness derives from deeper level, finer scale activities inside brain neurons. There are quantum vibrations in “microtubules” inside brain neurons..\n\nEEG rhythms (brain waves) also derive from deeper level microtubule vibrations, and that from a practical standpoint, treating brain microtubule vibrations could benefit a host of mental, neurological, and cognitive conditions.\n\nhttps://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.com/2011/12/7000-year-old-vedic-brain-wave-theories.html\n\nAll cells, including neurons, contained the same structures that make up mitotic spindles, which are basically microtubules the interior of a cell was like a tiny forest—NOT A WATERBAG..\n\nThis forest is very dynamic. It moves things around, rearranging itself, defining the shape, function, and structure of the cell. Each neuron is a network of microtubules.\n\nA cell has a skeleton, somewhat like our body has a skeleton. It’s called “the cytoskeleton.\n\nThe cytoskeletal branches are moving cooperatively, like arms and hands, passing things along from place to place inside the cell, and rearranging themselves to change cell shape, and grow extensions like axons or dendrites.\n\nMicrotubules are ideal quantum computers.\n\nCONTINUED TO 2-\n\nCapt. Ajit VadakayilFebruary 17, 2019 at 11:55 PMCONTINUED FROM 1–\n\nMicrotubules in the brain’s neurons, are arrayed in parallel— if all the microtubules in about 100 neurons were in a quantum state for 500 milliseconds—a half second —a conscious event would then occur. For a more intense experience involving 1000 neurons, it would be 50 milliseconds..\n\nA series of conscious events gives a stream of consciousness.\n\nThere is a quantum process called quantum coherence occurring within the microtubules..\n\nHow the quantum world operates, there is a thought experiment created by the well-known physicist Erwin Schrödinger. He asked that one imagines a box that contains a cat. The cat is fed by a mechanism that has a 50 per cent chance to either release food into the box, or a poison. The observer of the box will never know whether or not the cat is dead, unless he opens the box and looks inside. In effect, the cat exists in a limbo; it is both dead, and alive.\n\nBut when the observer opens the box, he finds that the cat is dead. When particles are in a quantum state, they can be in many different states at once, but when the observer views those particles, they ‘choose’ a state; this is quantum coherence. That’s how qubits, or quantum bits, work in a quantum computer. A regular bit is either on, or off, but qubits exist in multiple states until coming together at once.\n\nIf consciousness holds its roots in some sort of quantum mechanism (i.e quantum vibrations within microtubules), then the quantum nature of that mechanism allows for a more random decision-making process to occur.\n\nA quantum computer is a type of computer that uses quantum mechanics so that it can perform certain kinds of computation more efficiently than a regular computer can.\n\nRegular computer stores information in a series of 0’s and 1’s.\n\nA quantum computer does not use bits to store information. Instead, it uses something called qubits.\n\nEach qubit can not only be set to 1 or 0, but it can also be set to 1 and 0\n\nA binary digit, characterized as 0 and 1, is used to represent information in classical computers. A pure qubit state is a coherent superposition of the basis states. An important distinguishing feature between qubits and classical bits is that multiple qubits can exhibit quantum entanglement.\n\nQuantum entanglement is a nonlocal property of two or more qubits that allows a set of qubits to express higher correlation than is possible in classical systems. A number of qubits taken together is a qubit register.\n\nQuantum computers perform calculations by manipulating qubits within a register. A qubyte (quantum byte) is a collection of eight qubits\n\nhttps://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-a-quantum-computer-explained-with-a-simple-example-b8f602035365\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiLplTc8rQY\n\nBEFORE THE ADVENT OF QUANTUM COMPUTERS ALL THIS WAS MUMBO JUMBO TO THE WHITE MAN– SUPERSTITION OF SAVAGE HINDUS..\n\nNOT ANY MORE !\n\nA binary digit, characterized as 0 and 1, is used to represent information in classical computers. … However, whereas the state of a bit can only be either 0 or 1, the general state of a qubit according to quantum mechanics can be a coherent superposition of both the state of a bit is either 0 or 1, the state of a qubit can also be a superposition of both. It is possible to fully encode one bit in one qubit.\n\nHowever, a qubit can hold even more information, e.g. up to two bits using superdense coding. … It’s called superposition. Vedanta explains this unique phenomenon by postulating “maya” as the cause of the superimposition.\n\nThe quantum world cannot be observed by our 5 senses, and they do NOT follow the cause and effect laws of classical physics.\n\nWe live in a time obstructed world using 5 senses — and also a timeless realm in the quantum dimension, where what you see is NOT what you get. Vedanta has told 7000 years ago that matter is not condensed substance but a diffused form of energy It is written in the Vedas that energy and matter are inter convertible.\n\nCONTINUED TO 3-\n\nCapt. Ajit VadakayilFebruary 17, 2019 at 11:56 PMCONTINUED FROM 2–\n\nAt the level of quantum reality the universe is not made up of things. It is comprised of oscillating fields of energy. In the quantum domain everything is interrelated. Photons and electrons have the ability to shift their form in an instant.\n\nMeasured one way they behave as particles. Measured another way they act as waves.\n\nIn spiritual dimensions energy is the reality. These energies have different vibrational levels and none are as dense as the physical world.\n\nThe theory of relativity, and the space-time character of the universe, were perceived by the old Indian Rishis in their advanced stage of spiritual consciousness\n\nThe intuition of Indian mystics led them to understand the multidimensional reality and of space-time continuum which is the basis of the modern theory of relativity.\n\nWhen the Gita says “The Universe produced phenomenally in me, is pervaded by me. . . From me the world is born, in me it exists, in me it dissolves.” It can only be understood if we understand consciousness.\n\nमया ततमिदं सर्वं जगदव्यक्तमूर्तिना |\n\nमत्स्थानि सर्वभूतानि न चाहं तेष्ववस्थित: || 4||\n\nmayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā\n\nmat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni na chāhaṁ teṣhvavasthitaḥ\n\nTranslation: BG 9.4: This entire cosmic manifestation is pervaded by Me in My unmanifest form. All living beings dwell in Me, but I do not dwell in them.\n\nWhile modern mathematics, science and technology centre around linear dimensional reality , but the Vedic systems avail multidimensional spiraling reality.\n\nHeisenberg’s uncertainty principle, is an equation of maya. The position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrarily high precision. There is a minimum for the product of the uncertainties of these two measurements. There is likewise a minimum for the product of the uncertainties of the energy and time.\n\nQuantum Physics does NOT give us a clear vision of what we call the classical cause and effect truth.\n\nNewtons “isolated systems ” are NOT found in nature.\n\nIn his book “My view of the world”, Schrödinger outlined his mystical and metaphysical view as derived from Hindu Vedanta philosophy.\n\nThe timeless principles of Vedanta is expressed in the technical language of Quantum Mechanics and the philosophy of science, even today with little or no attenuation of meaning.\n\nThe term MAYA is mentioned 72 times in Rigveda written down in Sanskrit in 5000 BC. Maya is mentioned 29 times in the Atharva Veda. In Puranas and Vaishnava theology, Maya is described as one of the nine shaktis of the reclining Vishnu.\n\nMAYA is the veritable fabric of duality, and she performs this role at the behest of BrahmAn, the morphogenetic consciousness field.. The Supreme God is not bound by Maya just as magicians do not believe the illusions of their own magic.\n\nCONTINUED TO 4–\n\nCapt. Ajit VadakayilFebruary 17, 2019 at 11:57 PMCONTINUED FROM 3–\n\nDespite a century of clinical use, the underlying origins of EEG rhythms have remained a mystery.\n\nClinical trials of brief brain stimulation aimed at microtubule resonances with megahertz mechanical vibrations using transcranial ultrasound or vedic srutis have shown reported improvements in mood, and is useful against Alzheimer’s disease ..\n\nConsciousness depends on anharmonic vibrations of microtubules inside neurons, similar to certain kinds of Indian music, but unlike Western music which is harmonic..\n\nOur human brain is in reality none other than a biological space-time energy transducer. As such, it creates not only space, but also time.\n\nSanatana Dharma or Hinduism believes that God has given us 5 senses of narrow bandwidth, so that we do NOT have an information overload breakdown.\n\nThis is how the brain – a lump of ‘pinkish gray meat’ – produced the richness of conscious experience and subjective experience .\n\nQuantum computing is about qubits of information remaining in multiple states until coming together into an instantaneous calculation, called “quantum coherence,” making a large number of things act together in one quantum state.\n\nYOU CANT HACK QUANTUM COMPUTERS..\n\ncapt ajit vadakayil\n\n..\n\nCapt.
