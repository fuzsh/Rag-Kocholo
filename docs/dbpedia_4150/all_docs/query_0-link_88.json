        "text": "Lord Krishna, in the Bhagavad Gita, imparts profound wisdom on work and its significance. He emphasizes the importance of performing one's duties diligently, without attachment to the results. Here are some key teachings from Lord Krishna on work: 1. **Duty and Dharma:** Lord Krishna advises individuals to fulfill their duties and responsibilities in life, known as dharma. He encourages everyone to perform their roles with sincerity and dedication. 2. **Detachment from Outcomes:** Krishna teaches that while we have control over our actions, we should not be attached to the results. He emphasizes doing the work as an offering without expectation of rewards. 3. **Selfless Service:** The concept of \"Nishkama Karma\" or selfless service is central to Krishna's teachings. He encourages individuals to work without selfish desires, ego, or seeking personal gain. 4. **Equanimity:** Lord Krishna advises maintaining equanimity in success and failure, gain and loss. This balanced approach to work helps individuals stay focused and unaffected by external circumstances. 5. **Yoga of Action:** Krishna introduces the \"Karma Yoga\" path, which involves performing actions as an act of devotion and surrender to the divine. It is a way to find spiritual growth through work. 6. **Efficiency and Excellence:** While emphasizing detachment from outcomes, Krishna also encourages performing work with excellence and efficiency. He acknowledges the importance of skill and dedication in one's actions. 7. **Guidance to Arjuna:** The Bhagavad Gita is a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield. Krishna provides guidance to Arjuna, who is faced with a moral and ethical dilemma. Through this discourse, Krishna imparts wisdom on how to navigate life's challenges. In essence, Lord Krishna's teachings on work revolve around performing one's duties with a sense of responsibility, dedication, and selflessness. He emphasizes the idea of working as an offering to a higher purpose, which leads to spiritual growth and fulfillment. #loardkirshna #krishna #ahmedabad #motivation #job #work #india\n\n#newdaynewchapter Chapter 1224: July 7,2024 During the wandering young days of Swami Vivekananda, he once went to Varanasi. There, he visited the Kashi Vishvanath temple. When he was returning from the temple, on the way, a troop of monkeys was sitting there. On seeing Swami ji, the monkeys attacked him. Frightened, the Swami started running away from the monkeys. However, as he was running away from them, the monkeys became more and more violent. He became helpless. Just then came a voice from behind. ‚ÄòStop Running, face the brutes‚Äô. Swami ji, moved by these words, stopped and stood boldly. Suddenly, the monkeys stopped chasing him and finally retreated. So he learnt a lesson face the brutes boldly or they will chase you\" It is ghor kali yuga, and most Hindus themselves are not performing their own Dharma rituals, because their intellect has reduced, and they have collectively become adharmi. They also lack the will/courage to act as per Dharma because 'Artha'(money) has become more important. Ask yourself, where have the great builders and architects of the ancient fantastic [temple] monuments all around us, gone? With the exception of the latest Ayodhya Ram Mandir, what extraordinary combination of art and science did they pursue to build such historical monuments that will last the ages of time? Because we don't believe that we are United Hindus. We divide ourselves geographically like South Indians, North Indians etc or linguistically apart from caste & creed hence we are at most disadvantage despite being a majority. There are Shaiva, Vaishnavs, Jains, Vaniya, Dravids, Kshatriya and what not. And our politicians keep playing each other's caste in order to get voters bank! Because the most educated person with highest degree stays away from voting sensibly. Because we have multiple government Reservation system in getting education and jobs for disadvantaged population and when higher caste Hindu asks about the quota he is taught lessons on Secularism! Today the Hindu community is in the same condition. The brutes like the separatists, the secular liberals, the jihadists are chasing us and we are running away from them. We never retaliate and that's our real problem. We have forgotten our inner strength.We have neglected the great wisdom of our Shastras and culture. Therefore, Arise! awake! Hindus and do not stop till you realise your dreams of creating Akhand Hindu Rashtra Bharat. Read your Shastras, realise your strength and face these brutes before they attack you and silence them with unity. Take Care and God Bless üôè\n\nToday is 2622 Birth anniversary of Mahavir Why do we call Mahavir a Spiritual Saint as a ‚ÄòCourageous Soldier‚Äô? His search or research for 12 years in jungles of Vihar now Bihar is to find true happiness outside materialistic pleasures. His search was for finding ‚ÄòThe True Truth‚Äô. He discovered that the journey of true truth starts from inside self. That internal journey of understanding self requires extreme courage and bravery and that must be reason for naming him ‚ÄòMahavir‚Äô. The inner journey of self has been simplified by him in 3 simple words besides 357 sutras written in Tatvarthsutra. Ahimsa, Anekantvaad and Aprigrah are those 3 simple words which enables one to start this inward journey. As explained in last year post A1. Ahimsa - no hurt to anyone even at Thinking level before speaking or Action. This is starting point of collaboration. A2. Anekantwad - acceptance of multiple views and respect them. This is starting point of creativity. A3. Aprigrah - Non-attachment to specific offering or object but just commited to purpose. The purity of purpose removes all the fears and provide extreme courage to take on any initiatives. These 3 principles are foundational signposts for inner journey to begin supported by Satya (Principle centric), Sanyam (Perseverance), Tap (deep research) and Tyaag(Letting go or letting go ego). My mind was connecting Inspirational Institutional Leadership with above seven teachings of Mahavir - Collaboration, Creativity, Purpose, Principle centric, Perseverance, Research and letting go ego. Just a point of reflection and connecting self leadership of spirituality and self Leadership of human centric contribution.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita, a sacred Hindu scripture, offers timeless wisdom and guidance that remains relevant to modern life. Here are some citations from the Bhagavad Gita along with their application to contemporary challenges: 1. Chapter 2, Verse 47: \"Karmanye Vadhikaraste Ma Phaleshu Kadachana\" (You have the right to perform your actions, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions). This verse emphasizes the importance of focusing on the process rather than the outcome. In modern life, it encourages individuals to do their best in their endeavors without being overly attached to the results, thereby reducing stress and anxiety about success or failure. 2. Chapter 3, Verse 16: \"Evam pravartitam chakram naanuvartayatiha yah | Aghayurindriyaramo moghamparthasajivati ||\" (He who does not follow the wheel of creation set in motion thus, sinful and sensual, rejoicing in the senses, he lives in vain, O Partha!) This verse highlights the importance of fulfilling one's duties and responsibilities in life. In the modern context, it encourages individuals to contribute positively to society, fulfill their professional obligations, and strive for personal growth and development. 3. Chapter 3, Verse 19: \"Tasmaad asaktah satatam kaaryam karma samachara | Asakto hyaacharan karma paramaapnoti purushah ||\" (Therefore, without attachment, always perform your duty; for by working without attachment, one attains the Supreme). This verse underscores the principle of detached action, advocating for the performance of duties without being overly attached to the outcomes. In today's fast-paced and competitive world, it advises individuals to focus on doing their best in their endeavors while maintaining equanimity and inner peace. 4. Chapter 6, Verse 5: \"Uddharedaatmanaatmaanam naatmaanamavasaadayet | Aatmaivahyaatmano bandhuraatmaiv ripuraatmanah ||\" (Let a man lift himself by himself; let him not degrade himself; for the Self alone is the friend of oneself, and the Self alone is the enemy of oneself). This verse emphasizes the importance of self-motivation, self-discipline, and self-improvement. It encourages individuals to take responsibility for their own growth and well-being, both personally and professionally, by cultivating self-awareness, resilience, and inner strength. 5. Chapter 18, Verse 63: \"Yathecchasi tathaa kuru\" (Do as you wish). This verse underscores the principle of individual agency and free will. In modern life, it reminds individuals of their power to make choices and decisions that align with their values, aspirations, and goals, thereby empowering them to take control of their destiny and shape their future.\n\nüåü Embracing Swami Vivekananda's Teachings on the Duties of Hindus üôè Swami Vivekananda, a spiritual luminary and a profound thinker, shared invaluable insights on the duties of Hindus to foster a better society and a deeper connection to their faith. Here are some of his teachings to guide us on this path: 1. **Self-Realization**: Swami Vivekananda emphasized that the primary duty of a Hindu is to realize their divine nature. By seeking self-realization through meditation and introspection, you can strengthen your inner self and connect with the divine presence within. 2. **Universal Brotherhood**: He urged Hindus to embrace the idea of universal brotherhood. Recognize that all beings are connected, transcending barriers of caste, creed, and nationality. Treat everyone with respect and compassion. 3. **Service to Humanity**: Swami Vivekananda believed that service to humanity is the highest form of worship. Engage in selfless service, helping those in need, as this is a direct path to spiritual growth. 4. **Study of Scriptures**: Dedicate yourself to the study of Hindu scriptures and philosophy.

Uphold truth, honesty, and ethical conduct in all aspects of life. Swami Vivekananda's teachings provide a profound roadmap for the duties of Hindus. By embracing these principles, you can contribute to the betterment of society, foster a deeper spiritual connection, and lead a purposeful life in alignment with the core values of Hinduism. üôèüåÑ #SwamiVivekananda #HinduDuties #Spirituality #UniversalBrotherhood #ServiceToHumanity #SelfRealization #CulturalHeritage üìöüåü\n\nIn the vast tapestry of human philosophy, the teachings of Lord Mahavir shine as timeless beacons of wisdom, guiding us towards a world of peace and harmony. At the heart of his doctrine lie three fundamental principles: Ahimsa, Anekantvaad, and Aprigrah, each a pillar upon which the edifice of inner transformation stands. Ahimsa, the principle of #nonviolence, exhorts us to refrain from causing harm, not only through actions but also through our thoughts and words. It is the cornerstone of collaboration, fostering empathy and understanding among individuals. Anekantvaad, the acceptance of #multipleperspectives, cultivates a fertile ground for creativity and innovation. By acknowledging the complexity of truth and embracing diverse viewpoints, we transcend the limitations of dogma and prejudice. Aprigrah, the practice of #nonattachment, liberates us from the shackles of materialism and ego. With a clear purpose untainted by selfish desires, we find the courage to pursue our goals with unwavering determination. These principles, complemented by Satya, Sanyam, Tap, and Tyaag, offer a roadmap for the journey inward, towards self-discovery and enlightenment. They underscore the essence of leadership, both spiritual and worldly, grounded in integrity, perseverance, and humility. As we commemorate the 2622 #birth anniversary of Arihant Prabhu #Mahavir (24th Tirthankara), let us reflect on the profound significance of his teachings, recognizing their transformative power in shaping a world where peace, harmony, and compassion reign supreme."
