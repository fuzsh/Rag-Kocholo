        "text": "The three Sahsranama stotrams dedicated to Lord Vishnu are found in Padma Purana,Skanda Purana and the Mahabharata.They are together called the \"Trividha Vishnu Sahasranamams\".Similarly,for Shiva we have \"Chaturvidha Sahsranamams\" but from Agama Texts we have many more.\n\nAnyways,the verse in question appears within the Dhyana Sloka of the Vishnu Sahasranama that is from the Anushasanika Parva of Mahabharata.\n\nAlso, as you can see from the passage given below, that Vyasa is mentioned as the Rishi of the stotram so Vyasa only is the author of those verses.\n\nAsya Shri Vishnordivya Sahasra naama Stotra Maha Mantrasya Shri Veda Vyaaso Bhagavan Rishih Anushtup Chhandah Shri Maha Vishnuh Paramatmaa Shrimannarayano Devata Amritaamshad –bhavo Bhanuriti beejam, Devaki nandanassrashteti Shaktih,Udbhavah Kshobhano Deva iti paramo Mantrah Shankha bhrinnandakeecha Chakriti keelakam, Sharangadhanvaa Gadaa dhara ithystram Rathaanga paani rakshobhya iti netram, Trisaamaa saamagassaameti kavacham, Aanandam Parabrahmeti yonih, Rithussudarshanah Kaala iti digbandhah Vishwarupa itidhyanam Shri Maha Vishnu preetyarthey kainkaryarupey Shri Vishnu Sahasra naama japey viniyogah......\n\nDhyaanam: Ksheerodanvatpradeshe Shuchimani Vilasatsaikatey Mouktikaanaam, Maalaaklaptaa –sanasthah Sphatika Mani nibhair mouktikair manditaangaha/ Shubhrabhrairadabhrairupari virachitairmukta peeyusha varshaih, Anandeenah puneeyaadari naleenagadaa shankha paanirmukundah/ Bhu paadasya naabhirviyadadasrura nilaschandra Suryoucha Netrey, Karnaavaashaashiro Dyormukhamkapi dakanoyasya vaasyamdbhih/ Antastham yasya Vishwam Sura nara khaga Gobhogi Gandharvadaityaschitramram Ramyate tam Tribhuvana vapusham Vishnu meesham Namaami/ Shantaakaaram Bhujagashayanam Padmanaabham Suresham, Vishwaakaaram Gagana sadrusham Meghavarnam Shubhangam/ Lakshmi kaantam Kamala nayanam Yogi hriddhyaana gamyam, Vandey Vishnum Bhavabhayaharam Sarva Lokaika naatham/ Meghashyaamam Peetakousheya vaasam Shri Vatsaangkam Koustubhodbhaasitangam,Punyopetam Pundarikayataaksham Vishnum vandey Sarva Lokaika naatham/ Sashankha chakram Sakireeta kundalam Sapeeta Vastram Saraseeruhekshanam, Sahaara Vakshahsthala Koustubham Namaami Vishnum Shirasaa Chaturbhujam/ Harih Om/\n\nMeaning\n\nMay Bhagavan Mukunda purify us as he is seated on the Ocean of Milk in the surroundings of sand that reflects the illumination of precious gems while wearing garlands of pearls transparent like crystals and adorned with Gada-Shankha-Chakra-Padma besides smiles of blissful trance showering rains of nectar from pure clouds over head on the blue skies; I salute Vishnu with admiration and deep veneration as He his physique representing the Three Worlds apppears as though Earth is His Sacred Feet, Sky His Navel, Air as His breathing, Sun and Moon as His eyes, Dishas or Directions as His ears, Heaven as His head, Fire as His Countenance and Oceans as His stomach. I salute Vishnu who contains the Universe in totality with Devas, humanity, birds, cattle, snakes, Gandharvas, Demons and so on all of whom act and play in their own ways and means. I salute to and prostrate before Vishnu who is the Paramount Power in all the Lokas as He is the embodiment of Peace and Tranquility resting comfortably on Sesha Naaga as Padmanabha or with a Lotus sprouted from his naabhi, Suresha or the Over Lord of Sura Ganas, Vishwaakaaram or the Divine Profile of Vishwa or the Universe, Gagana Sadrusham or like the most undefinable Skies, Neela Varnam or of Blue complexion and Shubhangam or of the most auspicious Physical Frame; Lakshmi Kantam or the family partner of Devi Lakshmi; Kamala nayanam or of the enticing eyes of Lotus; Yogi hriddhyaana gamyam or the Ultimate Goal of the heart-felt meditation of Yogis; Bhavabhayaharam or the Single Saviour of the Dread and Distress of Life’s Travails and the Unique Chief of all the Lokas; Bhagavan is also renowned for His Physique of Cloud-like Blue Complexion, His abode as the Ocean of Milk or dressed in yellow robes, Shri Vatsa mole on his Chest, the bright Koustubha Mani on his body, Punyopetam or surrounded by devotees and Dharmaatmas and of Lotus Eyes. Bhagavan is famed as the ever-adorned with Shankha-Chakra-Kireeta-Kundala-Yellow robes, Lotus like vision, Sacred and glitttering neck laces on chest and the outstanding Koustubha all decorated on his Four Mighty Hands! Indeed to that unparalleled Bhagavan Vishnu, my sincere salutations and Prayers\n\nHere is another link for the Vishnu Sahsranama Stotram from Mahabharata:\n\nYou can read the Dhyanam part from page 3 onwards and on page 5 we get the verses in your questions:\n\nI'm unable to copy sanskrit verses from that document hence given the image as a reference."
