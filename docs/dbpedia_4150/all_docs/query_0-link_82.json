Such men who follow the Chakra are purified and attain Moksha. The rest live a useless life. They forget God; they are enslaved by earthly pleasures; they have no purity and so their life is a waste, and they go down into the bottomless pit of Samsara. One way of life is pure and blessed; another way of life is sinful and useless. One is Atmarama, and another is Indriyarama, one fulfills his life, another destroys it.\n\nTo forget God is sin. Those who do not follow the Dharma Chakra forget God and run after the mirage of sensual pleasures. So they accumulate sin. They are described as “living in sin” (Aghayuh). They are men rejoicing in sensual delights. Their life is not useful either to themselves or to others. So their life is a waste. Is it proper for men to live like animals, reptiles, worms, and germs? According to the Lord’s command, one should fulfill his life by maintaining the Dharma Chakra.\n\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 3 🔻 (43 Verses)\n\nQuestion: What is he that does not follow the Dharma Chakra?\n\nAnswer: He is a sinner. He is a slave to sense-pleasures. His life is a waste."
