        "text": "Verse 1\n\nArjun said:\n\nO Janardana( Krishna) you have said that the self-knowledge or spiritual wisdom (buddhi) is greater (jyayasi) than action( karmanam), then why do you urge me(ma niyojasi) to wage this terrible(ghore) action(karmane), war?\n\nArjuna believes the paths of knowledge(jnana yoga) and action(karma yoga) to be separate from each other or even opposite of each other. He does not know that both are the paths of our spiritual journey, the journey of liberation. Spiritual wisdom (pragna) arises in us when we follow the path of Karma Yoga as described in the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nVerse 2\n\nYou are bewildering and confusing my intellect, my mind, (buddhism mohayasi) by mixed messages(vyamishraneva vakeyna). Please tell me definitely(nischitya) the one way I can attain(apnuyuat) the supreme good(shreya).\n\nWe use intellect to figure out and judge what is right and what is wrong.The intellect divides and categorises. Using our intellect for this reason is very valuable. But it has limitations when we use our intellect for understanding the truth, for cultivating wisdom. The limitation is the intellect can only see the parts and not the whole. And that’s why Arjuna sees Karma Yoga and Jnana Yoga as opposite of each other or separate from each other. As the Rigvedic sage says “ Truth is one, paths are many.”\n\nVerse 3\n\nThe Blessed Lord Spoke\n\nAt the beginning of time(pura), I declared(provacha) two fold paths(dwividha nishtha) for the pure heart((anagh). The path of knowledge(jnana yoga), the path of Self-realization, for the followers of Sankhya(sankyanam), the path of contemplation, and the path of action(karma yoga), the path of selfless service.\n\nThere are people who have a natural tendency called Prakruti for contemplation, deep inquiring, and deep reflection. They have an uncanny ability to discriminate between the real and the unreal, whose self-will and separateness are very small, and who have an awareness of the unity of all life. They do not identify themselves with body-mind complexes. They transcend the duality of subject and object. Jnana Yoga is more suitable to them than Karma Yoga, the path of selfless service. Karma Yoga is more suitable for active, action-oriented persons like Arjuna. This verse, like almost all verses, can be applied to our daily life. The last 18 verses of Chapter 2 describe the characteristics of Sthitaprajna, an enlightened or self-realized person. These verses provide guidelines for applying the knowledge in our everyday life. As we will explore Karma Yoga in depth, we will learn how to apply the characteristics of a Karma Yogi to our daily life.\n\nVerses 4 and 5\n\nMan does not attain(ashnute) freedom from actions(naiskarma) by abstaining from(anarambhat) actions(karmanam), nor(na cha) does he by mere renunciation(sanyasat) of action, attain perfection(siddhi).\n\nIndeed no one, even in the twinkling of an eye(kaschit kshanam api), ever exists( jatu tishthati) without performing action. Everyone is driven to action(karyate) even against his will(hi ayavasha) by nature-born(prakrutijayihi) qualities(gunaihi).\n\nThe central message of these two verses is that we all are born to do work. Nobody can survive and thrive without doing work for oneself and for others in our life. Even those who renounce the world, work for themselves and for others. How do I relate to the work I want to do for myself or for others is the main question. And how do I relate to the work I do not feel like doing or the work I am doing is not my cup of tea. The Gita offers a very helpful perspective on work. If we perceive work negatively and act negatively, the taste of the work will be negative. If we relate to work positively, the taste of the work will be positive. Jesus The Christ states the law of karma in precise terms:” As you sow, so shall you reap.” And he adds:” With what measure you mete, it will be measured to you again.” There are two other sayings from the Bible that are applicable to Karma Yoga.\n\n“ You should love your neighbor as yourself.” and “ So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you.”\n\nHow do we spiritualise our work? What makes our work spiritual.? When we relate to work as selfless service with no expectation in return, our work becomes worship. Mahatma Gandhi is a living example of a Karma Yogi. Even those who have taken the path of sanyas, renunciation, need to work. In fact when a student is initiated by his Guru, the spiritual teacher, he is required to do a lot of manual work in the ashram before he is qualified to be a spiritual teacher.\n\nThe word Naishkarmya or the state of worklessness used in verse 4 needs to be understood in two contexts. Those who are on the spiritual path need to work on themselves, have to discipline their life.They cannot abstain from work. However, the state of worklessness is attained by great mystics or self-realized beings. They live in the world but not of the world. Ramana Maharshi, Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Anadimaiya and Amma and many such spiritual teachers live in a state of worklessness, beyond time and space. In their presence, we can feel their workless state.They are beyond the doing state.They exist in the being state of pure consciousness, a state of blissfulness.\n\nVasanas or desires create cravings. Clinging to cravings cause suffering. Our minds get impured by such cravings. Here comes the application of Viveka-discretion and Vairagya-renunciation. Vivek helps us to make pure choices and vairagya helps us release and let go of impure desires. When we live selfishly our mind gets polluted and confused and that kind of mental state obstructs clarity and creativity. Our mind is not awful. What bubbles in our mind makes our mind awful. Karma Yoga is the path of selfless service. Selfish thoughts and actions create bondage. When we use our energy to help and serve others we become free from the self-created bondage.\n\nThere is an interesting Zen story about pure thoughts and impure thoughts. A student went to a Zen master for help to purify his mind. His mind had many dark thoughts. The Master told the student to look at the two bowls; One is full of white pebbles and the other is full of black pebbles. And there is one empty bowl. He asked him to put the back pebble into the empty bowl when a negative thought comes to his mind. The student followed the Master’s instruction. As he was going through this mindfulness practice he came to notice that the number of black pebbles was increasing and eventually his mind was completely empty of back pebbles. The Zen Master was teaching the student the value of emptying his mind for enlightenment. According to the Buddha, one needs to be aware of what kinds of thoughts are going in our mind and act wisely to let go of harmful thoughts. Chitta shuddhi, purification of the mind, is one of the significant teachings of Karma Yoga. The purified mind is the spiritual mind.\n\nMahatma Gandhi’s path was Karma Yoga. According to Mahatma Gandhi “ The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.” In one of the prayer meetings he quoted the saying of Jesus:’ Blessed are the pure in heart. They shall see God.” He also said,” Non-violence means avoiding injury to any one on earth in thought, word, or deed. Non-violence cannot be preached. It has to be practiced. It was a means by which the truth is realized.’’ In fact, later he concluded that the ends were in the means, or perhaps, they were even the same. How and what means we use to attain our goal is very important. According to Mahatma Gandhi the means need to be in alignment with the ends. He used two important words for attaining freedom from the British Rule. One was Satyagraha, the soul force, and the other was Ahimsa-non-violence. Non-violence is not only reframing from physical violence but also from inner violence. We can use both the soul-force and non-violence to attain our liberation, enlightenment It is worth noticing how Dr. Martin Luther King Jr and his followers have followed Gandhi’s Karma Yoga philosophy and his path.\n\nIn verse 5 the word Prakriti-nature- is mentioned. This word is used and explained in depth in Samkhya Yoga-one of the six ancient Indian Philosophies.There are six ancient Indian Philosophies called Bhartiya sat Darshanas. Samkhya is the oldest Indian philosophy. They are Nyaya, Vaishika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mimansa, and Vedanta. The concept of Prakriti is briefly described in Samkhya Karika in the following verse:\n\nSattvam laghu prakasam ishtam upmushtakam chalam cha rajaha.\n\nGuru varukamava tamaha pradipvat arthataha vrittihi.\n\nSattva is buoyant and illuminating. Rajas is desired, exciting and mobile.\n\nTamas is heavy, sluggish, and enveloping.They-the three qualities-function together for a simple purpose like an illuminating lamp.\n\nChapter 14 of the Bhagavad Gita is called Gunatraya Vibhaga-Yoga of The Diversity of the Three Gunas. In this chapter there is a detailed description of the three gunas.\n\nQualities of Sattva Guna: Purity(nirmalatva)), luminosity (prakasha), Happiness (sukha), knowledge(janana), Light of wisdom(prgna prakasha),uplifting(urdhva gacchati), Lifts to Upper regiom\n\nQualities of Rajas Guna: Passion(raga), Thirst for Enjoyment, Selfishness Greed(lobha),Desire(spruha) Keep in the Middle region\n\nQualities of Tamas :Ignorance(ajana), Negligence(pramad),Stupor(moha)), Tamas(darkness),Sinks to the lower region\n\nPrakriti is nature and gunas are qualities or attributes of nature. These qualities are in flux.They change. When a sattva guna is predominant in a person, that person is sattivaka, has a sattvik disposition. He will also have some rajasik and tamasik qualities. When a rajasic guna is predominant in a person, that person is rajasik, has a rajasik disposition. He will have rajasik qualities. When a tamas guna is predominant in a person, he is tamasik, has a tamasik disposition and tamasik qualities. He will also have some sattvik and rajasik qualities.\n\nThere is always a possibility of moving from tamasik to rajasik and satvik state. It requires discipline to move from the lower level to the higher level.There is also a possibility for a person to go beyond the three gunas, to transcend these qualities. Such a person is called gunatita. The 14 th Chapter of the Bhagavad Gita describes the three gunas in depth and also describes the marks of a gunatita person.\n\nGunan etan ateetya trin dehi deha samudbhavan.\n\nJanma mrityu jara dukhair vimukto amritam ashnute.\n\nWhen an embodied being(dehi) transcends(ateetya) these three qualities which are the source of the body(dehasamudbhavan), he is freed from(vimuktha) birth(janma), death(mritu),old age(jara), and pain (dukha) and he attains(ashnute) immortality(amritam).-Verse 20, Chapter 14\n\nVerse 6\n\nHe who sits(aste) restraining(sayamya) the organs of action(karmendriyani), who is menatally(manasa) brooding(smaran) over the objects of senses(indriyarthan) with a deluded mind(vimudhatma) is called(uchyate) hypocrite, not a sincere spiritual aspirant.\n\nA person who is sincerely aspiring to live a spiritual life learns how to govern his thoughts, to control his mind, and to unify his consciousness. Practicing spirituality in daily living is hard and whole-hearted work. You may have a desire to control your sensory objects but without your sincere and whole hearted efforts, you will not succeed. Your mind will be deluded. Outwardly you may restrain objects of sensory pleasure but inwardly you may dwell on sensual pleasures. Then you aren’t true to yourself. That makes you a hippocratic person.\n\nVerse 7\n\nIn contrast, O Arjuna, he excels ( vishishyate) who undertakes (arabhate) the control (niyamya) of the senses (indriyani) by the mind(manasa) without attachment(asaktaha) directs his organs of action(karmendriya) to the path of action(karma yoga -yoga of selfless service).\n\nThis verse offers a good description of how to spiritualize our daily actions. How to convert our daily actions into spirituality. This is the right path for Arjuna as he is a warrior. Rajas is the dominant natural quality of Arjuna. Hence Lord Krishna asks Arjuna to be a Karma Yogi. Karma Yoga is the right path for him, not jnana yoga.\n\nVerse 8\n\nPerform(kuru) your allocated niyatam) duty for action(karma), for action (karma) is better (jyayo) than nonaction(akarmana). And even maintenance of your body(sharir yatra) could not be accomplished(prasiddyed) without action(na karmana).\n\nAccording to the Hindu tradition, each one of us has dharma, duty, to perform according to our developmental stages.There are four developmental stages called Ashrams: Brahmacharya-, Studenthood, Grihashtha- Householder, Vanaprastha- Forest Dweller stage, stage of retirement, and Sannyas-Renunciation. As a Hindu, I am ordained to follow the three stages. Very few people may choose the fourth stage. Each stage has its own developmental tasks. There are four castes: Brahmin-teacher and preiset, Kshatriya-warrior, Vaishya- businessman, and Shudra-manual worker. In the families that follow this system, marriages are done in the same caste. Inter Caste- marriages were prohibated. Such boundaries are loosening and young people tend to go away from the traditional caste system especially in urban areas. There are four Purusharthas. The term Purusharth is made up of two words: Purusha means a man and Artha refers to purpose, aim, or goal of life. Dharma means duty and it upholds society by implementing moral and ethical living.. It regulates both Artha and Kama. Artha-prosperity, Kama-worldly pleasures, and Moksha-liberation, Self-realization. It refers to the release of one’s soul from all material desires, free from the cycle of birth and death. The second and the third prescriptions should be in alignment with the first prescription, Dharma. Every Human being strives to attain these goals. If we live our life according to these prescriptions, we attain Moksha free while living in the world. Some may get stuck on the second and third goals and may not go beyond them. Some may achieve these two goals without screening them through Dharma. Living this way life may not be fulfilled.\n\nWork- karma- is a necessity. When we work to serve others without manipulating or harming them our actions become sacraments. It is important for us to take care of us to take care of others. Otherwise we develop action fatigue. It is essential to have a balance between action to serve our needs and to serve the needs of others.\n\nLord Krishna gives Arjuna onr axiom: Action is better than inaction. Inaction Is a violation of the basis of our existence. The Bible tells us we must earn our bread by the sweat of our brow. Hard physical work and good healthcare are good for us in the early stages of our spiritual journey, Sadhana.Work takes us on a higher plane when it is performed without selfish desire for profit, prestige and power. Such a way of working will lead to ill will, frustration, and insecurity while working for the benefit of others lead to increasing health, security and wisdom. If we lead a selfless life, our contribution becomes a great force to elevate the consciousness of mankind.\n\nVerse 9\n\nThe world (loka) is bound (bandhana) by selfish actions, actions (karmana) other than (anyatra) those performed (samachara) for the sake of sacrifice (yagnarthat), without any thought of personal profit (tadarham). Therefore, O Kaunteya (son of Kunti), perform (samachara) action (karma) without attachment (muktasanga).\n\nThis verse offers a way of spiritualizing our life. When our action is not motivated by selfish desire our action becomes a Yagna-sacrifice. The word Yagna is used as selfless service, serving others with no expectation of reward or personal profit. One is not caught up in the selfish game, in the profit game, or even prestige game. If we get caught up in the selfish game, it becomes an inescapable compulson. We create our own prison and waste our time. This is the time to wake up and realize that we are driving our life in the wrong way and there is a way out. This way is Karma Yoga-a path of selfless service. With practice our whole life becomes Karma Yoga. When a journalist asked Gandhiji “What is your life message?” Gandhi answered in one sentence. “My life is my message.”\n\nThere are many ways to serve. We can give our time, knowledge, skills, food, clothes, books to others without any attachment to desire, expectation or a selfish motive behind our help. In the Bhagavad Gita we different words such as Nishkama Karma, a desireless action, Anasakta Karma, action without attachment or as Sri Krishna says in this verse “muktasanga” without attachment. Each word conveyed a way to spiritualize. We become aware of what is the motivation for doing a Karma.\n\nVerse 16\n\nAll life turns ( pravartitam)) on this wheel (chakram), O Parthja, whoever violates (nanuvartati) it, indulging his own senses (indriyaramo) lives (jivati) maliciously (aghayu), ignoring the needs of others, has wasted (mogham) his life.\n\nWhile explaining Karma Yoga Sri Krishna introduces a beautiful paradigm of Chakra, cycle. He talks about the Cosmic Cycle where we receive whatever we need from the universe such as air, heat, water, light, and space. Our duty is to thankfully give it back to the universe. This is a deep ecological idea. We are an integral part of the universe. If we exploit natural resources for personal gains, and personal pleasures we are violating the Cosmic Law and we all are paying the price for our selfish and unwise actions. We are witnessing big global changes taking place. We are responsible for creating the vicious cycle.\n\nOur Dharma as evolving and maturing beings is to preserve the purity of the natural gifts we receive from the universe. Nature nurtures us. It is our Dharma to nurture nature. Nature teaches us a lesson of living unselfishly. When we live this way in all areas of our life we are practicing Karma Yoga. Such a way of living creates joy, contentment, fulfilment and peace. If we do not live this way we are wasting our life. The mystics tell us that he who lives for himself suffers and he who lives for others lives fully and joyfully. The more we pry off the ugly mask of our ego or self-centeredness, the more our Real Self- the Atman- will reveal all its beauty, wisdom, abiding joy, and love in There is an interesting ancient story. A young devotee was praying everyday to Mother Goddess for a boon. One day Mother Goddess appeared and told her devotee to choose one of the three boons-Dana (donation), Daman (Self-control) and Daya (mercy). Her devotee asked for Dana. Dana is a selfless action without any expectation our lives.\n\nof a reward in return. Every one of us can use this boon of helping others selflessly. We can offer our help in small or big ways according to our capacity. I can offer my service as a teacher to those who need it.This is called jnana dana or vidya dana- boon of knowledge. One can offer his service as shramadana-donating labor, dhana dhana-donating wealth, annadana-donating food, vastradana-donating clothes, rakta dana-donating blood, bhumidana-donating land All danas, donations, are offered without any selfish motive such as for earning publicity, power, position and prestige.\n\nI came across a real story a few years ago. Milton Freedman, the Nobel Prize Award winner and the Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago was invited by a big Church in California to give a fundraising talk. When he met the Master Pastor, he asked him a startling question, “ Have you considered giving the money you will raise to help the poor?”. The pastor asked Professor Frieman,” Are you the real Milton Freedman?” Dr. Milton replied by asking a question,” Are you the real church?” There are some temples who have accumulated a large sum of money and gold donated by their devotees. An important question to ask like Dr. Freedman asked, How are they using their money? If they do not use the money for serving people then the temples or churches are not spiritual centers.\n\nVerse 17 and Verse 18\n\nHe who takes delight in the Self-the Atman- (atmaratireva), and whose satisfaction is in the Self (atmatruptaha), and is content in the Self (atmanaiva santushtaha) has no duty to perform. ( tasya karyam na vidyate)\n\nHe has no purpose (arthha) or interest in what is done-action- ( krutena) and what is not done-non-action (akrutena), nor he has no need or purpose (artha) for dependance vyapassryaha) on anybody (sarvabhuteshu).\n\nIn these verses Lord Krishna describes how a fully functioning Karma Yogi derives profound contentment, joy and fulfillment without depending on people or things. He derives deep satisfaction from within himself. Such a person has self autonomy and complete freedom from external sources.\n\nAs long as we have a hankering for personal profit or power, we cannot act freely. We create by ourselves the bondage of Karma-Karma bandhana. We go through the cycle of pleasure and pain, elation and depression, ups and downs. The way to be free from the cycle of suffering is to live a life unselfishly. Our actions are not mitivated by selfish desires. Mahatma Gandhi was a Karma Yogi. He had extinguished every desire for self-aggrandizement, recognition or reward. He was indeed a Nishkma Karma Yogi. According to Adi Shankaracharya one who follows this spiritual path is ready for enlightenment.\n\nAs long as there is a desire for anything external to us, there is a vacuum in our consciousness. The notion like If only I get and possess something or somebody I will be happy is delusional. Such a mindset is bound to create disappointment, misery and mental slavery. “We should heed well Sri Krisna’s words: if you want to act in freedom, develop a sustained spiritual campaign to remove every vestige of self-will and separateness from your consciouness.”-Eknath Easwaran.\n\nVerse 19\n\nTherefore (tasmat), strive constantly (satatam samachara) without attachment (asaktaha) to serve the welfare of the world (Karma); by devotion to selfless work ( karma) without attachment (asakta), a man (purushaha) attains (apnoti) the supreme goal (param) of life, self-realization or enlightenment.\n\nSri Krisna gives Arjuna the same advice for understanding and practicing Karma Yoga. To detach ourselves from our ego, to be free from the grip of our selfish desires and ambitions so that we can act for the welfare of others. If we internalize this advice, it gives us tremendous motivation for removing every trace of selfishness.\n\nIt is hard to embrace the path of selfless service, Our minds are conditioned by likes and dislikes. A disciplined mind is essential for walking on the spiritual path. We need to learn and practice to let go our attraction and attachment to our self serving domain of sensual pleasures-preyas- and follow the path of shreyas-the path of wellness and welfare of us as well of others-swa hitaya and para hitaya. When we attain maturity in our spiritual journey the boundary between swa-self- and para-gets dissolved.There are not two; there is one. And that is our Real Self.\n\nVerse 20\n\nKeeping in mind (sampashyan) the welfare of others (lokasamgraham), you should work in their service ( kartum arhasi). It was by such action (karmanaiva) that Janaka and others ( Jankadayaha) attained (asthita) perfection ( samsiddhim), the supreme goal of their life.\n\nKing Janaka appears in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. He was a great king of Mithila. He was also renowned as the father of Sita- wife of Rama, He performed all his duty wholeheartedly as a king, as a husnand, and as a father. He attained complete illumination while doing his duty, Dharma. We can attain such illumination by doing our duty as a husband or a wife, a father or a mother, as an employer or as an employee, as a teacher or as a student. It is not the kind of work we do but how we do it. If we do it selfishly, we plant bad Karmas. If we do it selflessly, we plant good karmas. Bad karmas bring misery and suffering “hell”, Good karmas bring happiness and wellness“heaven”. So it is our choice, a choice between preyas and sreyas. The law of Karma is at work all the time in the smallest details of life. When we act selflessly, we become aware of the unity or oneness of life in every relationship-relationship with human beings, with animals and with nature.\n\nWe are in this world to contribute, whether on a small scale or a large scale to serve others, take care of them, to help them without any selfish motive for our action. We develop our sensitivity and compassion for all living beings. In Buddhism the word Bodhichitta is for the compassionate mind, Bodhisattva is used for a compassionate person. Living this way we sustain and support the cosmic order. When we participate in hurting any being, we violate the cosmic order. We are breaking the underlying unity of all living creatures. William Blake describes the violation of the cosmic oneness in his poem:\n\nA robin red- breast in a cage\n\nPuts all heaven in a rage. . .\n\nA dog starved at his master’s gate\n\nPredicts the ruin of the State.\n\nEven by putting a little Robin in a cage or not giving food to a starving dog the cosmic order is violated. When we take care of life in any form, we are contributing to the cosmic order. Everything is closely interwoven. The law of Karma is at work all the time. We should try to practice this spiritual awareness of the unity of life in every relationship. The pain inflicted on a fish is in me. This is how spiritual awareness shows itself in us. Until we become aware of this unity underlying all life, all talk of spiritual awareness is just in words, hollow signifying nothing.\n\nVerse 21\n\nWhat the outstanding or superior (shrestha) person does (acharti), others will try to do that ( tad-tad itero janaha), The standards (pramanam) such people create will be followed (anuvartate) by the whole world (lokaha)\n\nThe more gifted we are in different aspects of life such as physically, menatlly and spiritually, the greater is our duty to contribute to the welfare of others. In this way we set the standards for others to follow. We can act this way in many contexts of life. We provide role modeling as parents to our children, as teachers for learners, as leaders for the nation , as business leaders for the employees, and spiritual teachers for the community. We set ethical standards by living ethically. We make it sure that there is congruence or alignment in our thoughts, speech, and actions. And our actions are to serve a noble cause of helping others without any reward in return. As Sri Krishna instructs Arjuna in verse 47 of chapter 2: “ You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of rewards, nor should you long for inaction.” Wrong means can never bring about a right end and the right means can never fail to bring about a right end.\n\nWe get several opportunities everyday to set a good example to others. As parents we can be masters of patience, endurance, and steadfastness because children give us many opportunities to cultivate good parenting qualities in us. We can make our lives an inspiring example to those who are associated with us or who come in contacts with us. Listen to the words spoken in the Sermon on the Mountain: “ You will be the city on the hill of light to everybody.” This way of living leads to enlightenment, liberation and self-realization.\n\nVerse 25\n\nO Bharat, as (yatha) the ignorant (avidvanso) act (karmani kurvanti) with attachment (saktaha), so (tatha) the wise (vidvansa) should act (kuryat) without attachment (asaktaha), intending (chikirsur) to maintain the welfare of the world (lokasamgraha).\n\nHow do we engage with life? Shri Krisna tells Arjuna not to turn away from his duty as a warrior. He advises him to be engaged with his life as a warrior. The core message of a religion is to transcend materialism, to go beyond the material world. It is for improving the world.\n\nAccording to Ken Wilber, modern way of practicing religion has three components:\n\nStop fighting with each other in the name of religion. There are no holy wars. Genuine respect for a religion.\n\nReligion should be in sink with science.\n\nReligion must not be against progressive values. It should be in harmony with our day to life.\n\nShri Krishan gives Arjuna Janak as an example of religious living. He performs wordly duties as a king, as a husband, as a father, and as a protector of his kingdom. He is fully engaged with the world without getting attached to the world. His actions contribute to the welfare of the world-loksangram. He is a good example of jivanmukta Karma Yogi.\n\nLokasangraham is a spiritual idea. It means welfare of the world, welfare of all beings living in the world including one’s enemies. This is a core idea of all religions. The prayer of St. Francis is founded on this idea of lokasamgraha.\n\nPrayer of St. Francis of Assisi\n\nLord make me an instrument of your peace.\n\nWhere there is hatred, let me sow love.\n\nWhere there is injury, pardon.\n\nWhere there is doubt, faith.\n\nWhere there is despair, hope\n\nWhere there is darkness, light.\n\nWhere there is sadness, joy.\n\nO Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek\n\nTo be consoled as to console,\n\nTo be understood as to understand,\n\nTo be loved as to love.\n\nFor it is in giving that we receive,\n\nIt is in pardoning that we are pardoned,\n\nAnd it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen!\n\nLet us contemplate on this spiritual prayer of St Francis of Assisi.\n\nReflect on the words or phrases that deeply resonate with you.\n\nVerse 26\n\nLet no wise man (vidwan) unsettle the minds (buddhi bhedam janayet) of the ignorant (agnanam) who are attached to their actions (karmasanginam). The enlightened one (vidwan) performing all works in a spirit of yoga (yuktaha) should cause (joshyet) others to act (as well).\n\nA wise and enlightened person inspires and encourages others to follow the spiritual path by performing actions selflessly, guided by compassion. Such actions have an impact not only on our dear ones but also on our antagonists. On the other hand, when we hate our enemies, we are helping them to hate us more. When we attack them, we are encouraging them to attack us back. On the other hand, when we forgive them, we are helping them forgive us. When we come closer to them, we’re drawing them closer to others. This is the spiritual law. Listen to what Jesus Christ says to his disciples, “ Love them that hate us and become compassionate with those who strike against us. When we develop the capacity to love whom we hate, we will be united with the Lord through His grace.” Refer to the prayer of St Francis of Assisi and listen to his sayings, “Lord make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. Where there is injury, pardon.” Mahatma Gandhi was a living example of this spiritual path.\n\nVerse 27, Verse 28, Verse29\n\nAll actions (sarvashaha) are performed (kriyamanani) by nature prakriti) and by the qualities (gunas) of prakriti ( prakruthi), by the products of prakriti,; but deluded (vimudhatma) by his identification with the ego (ahamkara), the body and mind, the ignorant (vimudhatma) one thinks (manyate), “ I am the doer (kartaham) of all actions.”\n\nWe have discussed the idea of prakriti and guna in Verse 5. Prakriti is the word used for anything that changes, anything that is impermanent, anything that was born one day, it will die one day. In Chapter 2, Sri Krisna talks about the impermanence of our body. Our body has the beginning and the end.The Atman is immortal, eternal, and infinite. The Buddha talks to his disciples in reference to his body, “ This house was assembled one day, and it has to be disassembled one day; what is there in this to grieve about.” When we identify ourselves with the body, the very thought of losing this body causes fear, dread and grief. Denial of death does not prevent the arrival of death.\n\nPurusha is our real self, our atman, exists outside the realm of change and the three gunas. The relationship between prakriti and purusha is explained by Sri Krishna with the metaphor of old clothes ( verse 22 in chapter 2).\n\nAnother important idea is quality (guna). There are three ultimate constituents of prakriti They are sattva, rajas, and tamas. Sattvik guna signifies purity, selflessness, freedom Rajasic guna signifies desire, energy and restlessness. Tamasic guna signifies inertia, laziness. In each one of us there is a different combination of sattva, rajas, and tamas. It is helpful to remind ourselves that we are not the body and the mind. When we do not identify ourselves with body-mind complex, and do selfless service, we transform tamas into rajas, rajas into sattva, and finally to go beyond all three gunas-gunatita.\n\nThe Gita talks about spirituality in the midst of life- how to live spiritually in the midst of life not as a monk in a cave or in an ashram. Spirituality about our day-to-day activity in family, in community, at our career place, and of course in our spiritual practice too.\n\nHow do we spiritualize our actions? This question is relevant for everybody. Questions to reflect on:How is action done by the ignorant, by those who do not have spiritual insight? And how is it done by the enlightened one or by the one who wants to be enlightened?\n\nAll actions are done by prakriti, by nature, made of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. Prakriti is the source of the physical universe and our body-mind complex- our physical body and our mental body-our thoughts, feelings, emotions, desires, our ideas, memories and experiences-gross-sthula-matter and subtle-suskhama-matter. We can see the physical body. All our inner experiences are private. Whatever we experience as this, as an object, is matter. This room is an object. It is matter. This body is matter. This breath is matter. The five sheaths-pancha koshas- of personality are also matter. The five layers or sheaths: annamaya kosha-physical body, pranamaya kosha-vital body, manomaya kosha-mental body-intelligence, vijnanamaya kosha- intellect, ananda maya kosha-the bliss body. The real you is not matter. The experiencer of the matter is the real you. The witness consciousness, sakshi chaitanya, is the real you. The witness consciousness is Purush or the Atman. It lights up the matter, sense organs, body-mind complex\n\nThere is one function of the mind called Ahamkara-ego maker, I maker, the ego. The ignorant ego is always connected with the body-mind. A thought comes from the mind. I want this, a desire comes up. The desire is in the mind. Mind connects with ego. I want this. I will get it. The I maker is the ego.The function of the ego is to appropriate unto itself all the activities of the body-mind unit. This my body. I am this. I want this.I think this. I ate this.I went there. I forgot it. I remember thatI forgot it. We identify with the changing prakriti-nature. The very nature of nature- prakriti- is to change. These are the functions of the mind. Each organ has its own function. The function of the ego is to integrate what is going in our body and mind. In itself there is nothing wrong in it. . Everything changes. The world is changing. The body is changing. The mind is changing. The problem is I am identifying with these changes. The seer-drashta- becomes the seen-drishya. We try to arrange things according to our satisfaction. I want this and that’s the way it should be. I like this job and that’s the way it should be. It is a little more wise to know I cannot change people so I change my life. I do not get what I expect so I change my expectations.My daily routines are not healthy for me. So I change my routines such as I exercise, meditate, pray etc. I may change my job place, my residence and the like. Do not forget nature is always changing. You arrange this way but it will change which may cause dissatisfaction, resentment and upsetness. We are condemned to suffer as long as we are identified with the changing body-mind, the reflected face in the outer mirror will change according to the light and shade.\n\nGood news is knowing that you-the real you- are not the body-mind complex. Detach yourself from the body-mind complex. Realize that I am not the ego-detach and be free. The process of disidentification and detachment releases us from the grip of the ego. We are released from the ego caused suffering. We do not participate in the ego games.Then we are not affected by the ego. We realize that we are the illuminator of the ego. The object is not me. Light illuminates everything but it is not affected by what is present before it. The seer-drusta- does not become the seen-drushya. The body-mind-ego continue to do their work. Since you are nonidentified and disengaged with it, you are at ease. You play your perfect role with ease. Ethical living becomes effortless when we are not engaged with or hooked and engulfed by the body-mind-ego complex. I am witness consciousness. Realizing the truth opens the doorway to pure existence-sat, pure consciousness-chit, and pure bliss-ananda. The stream of life flows freely through the five layers or sheaths of personality:\n\nStart with letting go of the hold of small obvious things such as my book, my bed, my room, my possessions and then go to subtle things like preconceptions and prejudices. This is life time practice-sadhana.This is also called renunciation or sanyasa. The ego is getting thinned out, weakened, loosened by spiritual practices. In the Song of Sanyasi Swami Vivekananda says,” Thine only is the hand that holds the rope that drags the arm. Let go thy hand Sanyasi and say” tat sat.” We hold on. Start letting go of small things. Starting early is better than starting late. Morning dawns when we wake up, awakened.\n\nAs long as I am identified with the body-mind complex, the ups and downs of the body-mind complex become my ups and downs. When I am the witness consciousness, I can lead a calm and serene life. I live in the world but not of the world.\n\nThe Gita teaches us how to live spiritually in the midst of life. How to make Karmakshetra Dharmakshetra.How to spiritualize our actions. There is a difference between how the ignorant and the one who knows the truth, his real nature, the self-realized person.\n\nAll action is done by prakriti, by nature. Prakriti has three gunas-Sattva, Rakas, and Tamas and the products of these gunas. It is made up of the five primordial elements: earth (bhumi), water (apas), fire (anala), air (vayu) and kham (space) and our physical gross body-sthula sharira, and mental body-sukshma sharira, subtle body-our body mind complex, our physical senses and physical organs and our thoughts, feelings, memories and samskaras, All this is matter. The Real I is not matter. It is the experiencer of matter. It lights up matter. That is Witness consciousness, sakshi chaitanya, Purush or atman.\n\nIn the mind a desire arises. I want this. I want that. Mind connects with ego-I want it. The ignorant are always connected with body-mind. Problem -dukkha-happens when we identify with prakriti and its constituents. Such projects are doomed to failure. I am condemned to suffer as long as I identify myself with the changing prakriti. When we realize that we are not body-mind complex, when we detach from ego and become the witness of the ego, the process of disengagement and non-involvement begins, The body-mind may continue their activities without affecting the Self.\n\nGreat sages use the word I in a different way. It is the witnessing I, observing I without attached to and bound by the ahamkara. As Swami Vivekananda sings in The Song of Sannyasi: “ Thine only is the hand that holds the rope that drags the arm. Let go thy hold Sannyasi and say tat sat.” Become aware of what you are holding on. Start letting go of the small external things and then letting go of the inner hold of resentment, disappointments, frustration, anger, pride and prejudice, and unforgiveness.\n\nAttaining this state is a lifetime practice because of our past life and present life samskaras.Unselfishness loosens the grip of I, the ego. This is Karma Yoga.In Bhakti Yoga the ego bows down to the Lord. When the bhalta merges with the divine the ego is completely dissolved-naham,naham. To the Bhakti Yogi the whole belongs to Gopala-sabahi bhumi Gopalki. In Raja Yoga, Yoga of Meditation, the ego is gradually vanished by withdrawing the mind (pratyahara) from distractions and focusing the mind on the object of concentration (dharana), and continuing concentration without break or disruption leading to oneness with Ishwara- the mind fully absorbed and resting in the Divine abode.\n\nVerse 28 and Verse 29\n\nBut the one who knows the truth (tatva vittu), the illumined person, understands the domains or spheres of the gunas and actions of the gunas(gunakarmavibhagyoho) and is not attached (na sajjate). Such a person knowing (matva)that the gunas interact with each other(guna gunesu vartante)) does not get attached to them, O Might Arm Arjuna.(Verse 28)\n\nO might arm Arjuna (mahabaho), the knower of the truth(tatva vittu)) that I am not the ego. I am the witness of the ego. I am also not the body-mind complex which is doing its thing, but I am not it. What does he know? He knows that the entire world is the product of the constituents of prakrit-sattva, rajas and tamas.and the products of prakriti-the five elements-earth, water, fire, air and space-bhumi, apaha, analaha, vayu and kham and their combinations such as bodies, minds, plants etc. All that is guna. Karma-all activities and actions are performed in this nature-walking, talking, sitting, running, even thinking, loving, hating, meditating. They all are within the realm of body-mind, all within the realm of ego. I am the light which lights all them up. Gunas are constituents of nature. Karma is action, activity. Vibhaga-domains.\n\nKnow that the constituents of nature are working with the constituents of nature (guna gunesu vattanalle). It has nothing to do with me.( Iti mattva na sajjate). Body-mind are products of nature. The people I interact with them are also the products of nature, not I. Knowing this he does not get mixed up. It does not mean that the person stops acting. You are not attached to this. Body-mind keeps on doing what they are supposed to do. Break through and stay that way. Body-mind will try to subdue you. This could happen due to the traces left behind in the previous life-purvajanma samskara. The first part is seeking the truth, studying it. Now you have found it. You have realized that I am the witness consciousness. Remain centered in it. Don’t be swept away. Do not get trapped again. Do not get stuck up.\n\nVerse 29\n\nThose who are deluded (sammudhaha) by the operations of the gunas (guna) of the material nature (prakriti) become attached (sajjante) to the results of their action (guna karmasu). The perfect knower (kritsnavid) who understands the truth should not unsettle or confuse (na vichalayet) the ignorant ones ( tan akritsnavidaha) and the slow learners(mandan) (Verse 29)\n\nThese two verses depict two kinds of persons. Those who are illuminated-the knower of their real nature and non- attached and those who are attached and deluded . Those who are enlightened should help the ignorant and slow learners and push them to move upward.\n\nThe word Prakriti is used in the Gita in many chapters like Chapter 2, 3 and 14. Let me discuss a few basic ideas of Samkhya Philosophy in which there is an explanation of Prakriti and Purusha. Samkhya is one of the six ancient Indian philosophies. It is a school of rational or realistic dualism. The founder of Samkhya philosophy is Sage Kapil in 700 BC. The book is Samkhya Sutra containing 526 sutras. Samkhya Karika is the commentary on Samkhya Sutra. I have taken the main ideas of Samkhya Philosophy from Samhya Karika.\n\nMain Features of Samkhya Philosophy\n\nIt is Rational Dualistic Philosophy. Prakriti and Purusha-opposite of each other. Purusha is a conscious principle. Prakrity is an unconscious principal. Purusha is like the knower, pure consciousness, witness consciousness, the ultimate Truth. Prakriti is like the known which we can see, feel and experience in nature. Prakriti cannot exist without Purusha while Purusha can exist without Prakriti. Prakriti is the root cause of the universe, not the Purusha.Prakriti is the mother of all creation. There are 24 components of Prakriti including Prakriti.\n\nPrakriti has three inherent components called Gunas. They are Sattva-the lightness, Rajas-activity and Tamas-inertia.When the gunas remain in equilibrium, Prakrity is unmanifested.The equilibrium is disturbed nature comes in manifestation. When Purusha comes in contact with Prakriti the equilibrium is disturbed. Prakriti gives birth to 23 components.They are nothing but the part of the Prakriti. The first is Mahad-the cosmic intelligence. On the individual level it is called Buddhi, the intellect. Then comes Ahamkara, Iamness or ego. Ego is born out of nature.\n\nThe very nature of Prakriti is to change. Everything is changing-the world, the body, the mind. If I identify myself with any of these changing phenomena, I suffer. We are condemned to suffer as long as we are identified with and attached to the changing body-mind. Ignorance causes bondage and suffering.\n\nPurush is the individual soul. Purusha is pure consciousness, the witnessing consciousness. Soul is eternal, ever pure, ever detached and all pervading.\n\nVerse 29\n\nThose who are deluded (smmudha) by the operation of the gunas (prakriti gunaha) become attached (sajjate) to the results of their action (gunakarmasu). Those who know the complete truth (tan kriutsnsvida) should not disturb (vichalayet) the ignorant (akrutsnavid), the one who does not have complete understanding, and the slow one (mandan)- who is slow in understanding.\n\nThose who are confused or deluded by the constituents of prakriti (praktuter gunasammudha) get attached to the activities of these constituents (sajjante gunakarmasu). One who knows the totality (Krutsnavid), the knower, who knows body-mind-prakriti- is not he. In contrast, there are a akrutsnavid- ignorant-not knowing the truth or knowing it partially. The knower of the totality should not disturb or confuse them. The knower should push them up and support them with compassion.\n\nThis is a very good advice given to the wise and knowledgeable person by Lord Krishna. Relate to the ignorant and the slow learner with compassion. Do not cause disturbance in them. Accept them as they are without causing distress in them. Encourage them, support them and inspire them. Give them an upward push. Encourage them to act selflessly, to help others, to serve others. Encourage them to do small acts of kindness.\n\nSpirituality is necessary for everyone in any action we are doing. There are four interconnected steps in the journey of self realization or enlightenment.\n\nTo move from adharma-unethical path to dharma-ethical path.\n\nFrom ethical to unselfish living.\n\nFrom unselfish to spiritual way of living\n\nFrom spiritual way of living to self-realization or enlightenment.\n\nWe need to work though these steps slowly and steadily to cultivate spiritual maturity. It takes time for most of the people to be spiritually mature. According to the Vedic\n\nsystem there are four stages of development called ashrams to develop spiritual maturity. In the first ashram, the student learns how to be self responsible, He learns how to do his duty as a student. Also how to be helpful to others and serve others. In the second ashram, the field of doing dutiful and serviceful actions expands. In the third ashram there is further expansion of caring for others and serving them selflessly. The community becomes the family. In the fourth ashram all the ties of attachment are broken. Such a person is completely free from attachments and is liberated from all Karma bandhana. He is a self-realized person. He is no more deluded. He is fully awakened.\n\nThere are two kinds of actions for the spiritual seeker. The first is Karma Yoga for Self-realization. The second is lokasamgraha-welfare of the world. These are the two modes of Karma Yoga. A self-realized person sees himself in all persons-sees the unity underlying in all beings.\n\nVerse 30\n\nSurrendering all actions to me (mayi sarvani karmani samyasa) with spiritual awareness (adhyatma chetsa), without selfish desire (nirashi) and without attachment (nirmamo), engage in this fight (yudhyasva), battlefield of life being free from fever, mental fever of the ego-anxiety, worry, fear, and confusion.\n\nSurrendering is offering all our activities such as prayer, worship (puja), mediation, and our routine and necessary activities such as cooking, teaching, driving, working. We do all these actions as a worship to God, offering them at the lotus feet of God. Sanyas does not mean giving up activity but offering them to Lord Krishna like we offer a leaf (patram),.a flower (puspam), a fruit (falam), water (toyam) with adhyatma chetsa- spiritual awareness, the internal spiritual attitudes. I am jiva seeking God realization. I am the doer (karta) as the servant of God. I am doing this as my service to God.This is called adhytma chetsa. The goal is spiritual. Work is worship. This is done without self-serving desire (nirashi) and without attachment (nirmamo). This world is prakriti, body-mind prakriti. My actions belong to God. In fact everything belongs to God, not to me (na mama).This way of living frees us from the fever of worrying and anxiety (vigato jwara). Engage in action but deeply calm, deeply relaxed in the midst of intense activity. In the words of Swami Vivekananada, “Eternal calmness in the midst of intense activity.”\n\nYudhysva- Engage, fight. Do not withdraw from the battlefield of life.\n\nIgnorance: This is my body, my mind, my desire, my possessions, my achievement. They are not ours and will never be ours.There is a beautiful verse in the Shanti Parvam in the Mahabharata: Dvyaksaram bhavet mrituhu, tryaksram Brahmasasvatam. Mameti cha bhavet mrityu, na mameti cha sasswatam.“Mama bhavet mrityu” Two letters mama bind us. It causes mortality, death, There cannot be a relationship between nitya and anitya. Prakriti is anitya, changing.Purusha- Witness Consciousness- is beyond change. Three letters. Namama-not mine-frees us. It causes eternity.” Namama bhavet mukti.” My body, my mind, my possessions, my desire, my accomplishments. They are not ours. I am not the body. I am not the mind. I am not ahamkara. When we are not conscious and aware, we get trapped by Prakriti. When we realize this truth we continue working, living in the world without identification and attachment.We are jivanmukta.\n\nDesire, Asha, I want this- and Possessiveness, and it belongs to me, Mama. I want this and It belongs to me-attachment- causes suffering. It’s a worldly attitude.When we think and say that it’s not mine and all is worship to God. This is the Lord’s body to serve and worship Him. This is the Lord’s world.Everything that belongs to me belongs to God.This is spiritual consciousness-adhytmachetsa. Then there is no fever of anxiety and worry-vigatajvara.\n\nThey were never ours.Pure being, pure consciousness is eternal.It has no birth, no death, no disease, no old age. I am aware of my body and my mind, but I am not that.They will never be ours.There can be no relationship between eternal-nitya- and non eternal-anitya. You are unchanging by nature, you are beyond change.I am the witness, purusha. Purusha and prakriti are separated-purusha prakriti connectedness-samyoga- causes suffering, ups and downs. When purusha and prakriti are separated, purusha-prakriti viyoga, there is no suffering. There is moksha-liberation.\n\nEverything I have belongs to God. Brahmarpanam Brahma haviahi. I offer everything to God as nothing belongs to me.The world is Prakriti. I am the witness consciousness.The link between Parakriti and Purusha is broken It is called smabndha viccheda. We continue living in the world without being attached to it.This way of working is called adhytmachetsa. Then the work we do is a part worshiping God, our spiritual practice.When we realize that we are apart from body, mind and work in the world it is called Naishkarmya.\n\nRenounce all actions in me with spiritual consciousness, Give up all desires (nirashi) and the idea of possessions (nirmama) and do your duty.. Fight the battle of life, being free of all care,all anxiety and all mental stress. This is the teaching of Karma Yoga.\n\nNotice the core elements of Karma Yoga. The first element is adhytmachets. Spiritual orientation.Our Life is guided by spiritual goal. The goal of life is God realization. I acknowledge it.\n\nThe second element is how do I practice it? How to keep my actions in alignment or in accord with the goal? Now begins sadhana. I am on the spiritual journey to realize the ultimate truth or God realization. Really I am Brahman but I have not yet realized the goal. Jiva experiences the world as dualistic-Prakriti and Purusha. All dualistic practices become useful in spiritual practices. What Lord Krishna teaches is that in order to be a Karma Yogi you need to purify your mind. The impurity of the mind is selfish desire, craving for sensual and selfish desires and possessiveness.\n\nI will continue doing actions but not for my own sake or for my self interest or meeting my selfish desires. We may have the intention to follow life spiritually. The problem is distraction and deviation. Distraction of the mind is an obstacle on the spiritual path. Concentration of the mind is the solution. The method is upasana-meditation. Vivekanada calls it emptying the bucket of selfish desires and possessiveness. I am not the mind. I have the mind. Mind is an instrument. If I identify myself with the mind, it will be difficult to separate the self from the mind, from Prakriti. As mentioned before we make our work worship of God. I am doing all activities as offerings to God. The focus is God.\n\nThis verse teaches the essence of Karma Yoga. It has four components:\n\nAtmachetsaha- Spiritual orientation.The goal is Self-realization, Liberation.This is the overall purpose of life- jivana mukta.\n\nDo all the activities in your life (sarvani karmani), perform your duties (sarvani karmani). Offer them to God as prasad( sanyasya). This is done mentally without any self-serving desire (nirash) or attachment (nirmama).\n\nVigata jvaraha- without the fever of anxiety or tension. Since you do not have any attachment (na mama) you will not have anxiety. Do your duty to fight for the right cause-yodhyasva.\n\nKarmabandhamukti. They are free from the bodage of Karma. They are free from the effects of Karma. Purify your mind by doing Karma Yoga.\n\nVerse 31\n\nThose men (manvaha) who have abiding faith (shraddhavanto) in me and are free from criticism ( anasuyanto ) always (nityam) live (anutishtanti) in accordance with these divine laws or who constantly follow my teachings (me matam) are liberated (muchyante) from the bonage of action( karmabhihi).\n\nThe teaching in Verse 31 is an extension of the teaching of verse 27.” All kinds of actions (karmani sarvashaha) are caused by the qualities of nature (prakritehe gunanahai). However the ignorant man, deluded (vimudhatma) by egoism (ahamkara) thinks (manyate), I am the doer.” All actions are done by nature -prakriti-, not by the individual.\n\nWhen we identify ourselves with body and mind, it becomes our default mode of thinking and acting. This is the primary delusion. I am in charge. I do actions.This is my body. This is my mind. These are meant for my prayojana, my purpose. This is the fatal error. Our biological mechanisms are autonomous.The same is the case with the mind-our thoughts, feelings and memories. I like this. I don’t like this (desire) and we act upon it. We think we are doing it. Behind the scene is Prakriti. Prakriti is in charge of the body-mind complex.\n\nHow do we relate to this fact?\n\nFirst you acknowledge at this level. Right now It is more true.to say that way.\n\nThe next step: Prakriti does everything and you’re the witness consciousness, awareness. I am the witness consciousness comes only when the mind is purified enough to see the truth. Right now it is a concept for me. Whatever is going in my life, I have little control over it. I have a free will. But a lot is done by nature. We are on the spiritual journey. Recognize that gunas are working. Prakriti is working. God is in charge. To realize that I am Brahman, soham, is a far cry at this level of funcioning. We need to purify our mind. We purify our mind by doing selfless service. Serving others with no rewards in return. We contribute to the wellness of others-lokasamgraha. Be nirashi and nirmama.\n\nThe goal of life is God or Self-realization. My body-mind belongs to Dod. The world is not our goal. God realization is our goal. We make it sure that our desires and actions are in accordance or in alignment with our goal. My goal is not samsar. But It is God realization. Know the difference between Dharma and Adhrma. Follow the path of Dharma. Discriminate between shreyas and preyas. What needs to be done and what does need to be done. Discriminate between dharma and dharma, between nitya and anitya, between satya and mithya. Have this viveka-discretion.\n\nAll work is now worship of God. Faith: I am putting my life in God’s hands. He will help me to achieve my spiritual goal-to attain joy, contentment and peace.\n\nReal self is satyam, jnanam, and annatam- existence, consciousness, and infinte\n\nIt takes time to change, to realize our spiritual goal. We see good things in people and ignore their limitations. We do not find fault with others.\n\nPrakritehe kriyamanani gunaihi karmani sarvashaha!\n\nAhamkara vimudhatma kartaham iti manyate!! Verse 27\n\nVerse 32\n\nThose (ye), however (tu), who, finding fault with or criticise (abhyasuyante) my teachings (me matam) and do not follow them, know (viddhi) them to be deluded (vimudha) of all knowledge (sarvajana), unaware (achetsa) of spiritual ways of living, and lost (nashtan). They are the cause of their own suffering.\n\nOur main goal of life is Self-realization. There are spiritual teachings for those who want to get out from the wheel of worldly living , samsara chakra. However, there are people who are so caught up in the worldly materialistic ways of living that they do not know the way to be liberated from this wheel of suffering. They do not have spiritual attitudes. They are bereft of all knowledge. They do not know the difference between what is ethically right (Dharma, and what is ethically wrong (Adharma) -Dharmadharma vivek. They do not discriminate between eternal (Nitya) and non eternal (Anitya)-Nityanitya vivek). They do not discriminate between real or true (Satya) and Appearance or unreal (mithya)- Satya Mithya vivek. God is Real and the world is an Appearance or an illusion like a mirage. This is the final viveka, the deeper knowledge. It is there but they don’t see it as they are blinded by the worldly self-centered living. byThey live for their own pleasure, profit, and power. Not only they are ignorant but they criticise the spiritual teachings of Sri Krishna. Ignorance and scepticism do not exempt them from the spiritual laws governing the world. They are deluded by raga-desires and dvesha- aversion and they cause their suffering, in their lives and in the lives of others associated with them.\n\nThe consciousness of such ignorant people is constricted.They feel insecure, are not at peace, and they do not contribute to the welfare of others.\n\nAchetsaha-lack of spiritual orientation or spiritual purpose of life. They are engaged in pursuing worldly pleasures and that is the root cause of their suffering.\n\nAbhyasuyantaha: Those who are atheists and strongly involved in the materialistic world criticise the spiritual teachings. They do not want to see the Truth\n\nVerse 33\n\nEven a wise man (jnanavan api) acts (chestate) in accordance with (sadrusham) his own nature (swasyaha prakritehe). Beings (bhutani) follow (yanti), act according to their nature ( prakriti). Every creature is subject to prakriti. What (kim) will restraint or repression(nigraha) accomplish (karishyati) ?\n\nEven an enlightened person, Brahmagnani or jivanmukta follows his nature, prakriti. Then what to speak of ordinary people? Prakriti is our nature. What is our real nature? Our real nature is Satchidananda- existence, consciousness, and bliss or described as truth, knowledge, infinite-satyam jnanam anantam. Prakriti refers to the body-mind complex, our body and thoughts, tendencies desires or vasanas, likes and dislikes, memories we got in this life. They are the products of prakriti. In mind we have samskaras carried on from our past lives and also affected by our present life, our body-mind actions. They are accumulated life after life as Adi Shankaracharya says.-prachin karma samskaras. This is the totality of Prakriti. These samskaras are different from person to person. We all have our distinct individualized personality which is shaped by our natural-prakritik- tendencies. As Shankracharya says Prakriti Nama purva kritaha- done before- dharmaadhrmadi samskaras-good and bad karmas vartamana-present janmadadau- and prior to this life. They are manifested in our present life, abhivyakta sa prakrithi.They differ from person to person. That’s why we find differences even in the same family members. Some are relatively quiet, some like to talk a lot, some are introverted and some are extrovert.Our Atman is the same for all people. It is universal. We all are pure beings, pure consciousness, pure bliss. This is impersonal. But each of us have a different personality. This individualized personality is prakriti. Where does it stay? In our mind. Where does it come from? From our past lives. We have woven the web in which we are trapped. We can be untrapped by doing the wholesome karmas in this life. How we live in this life makes a difference. We make our own destiny. All Eastern religions believe in past lives. The present life is impacted by the past life. The future life can be shaped by how we live in our present life. As St Paul says,’’ As you sow so shall you reap.” The doctrine of Karma-Karma Vada- is not fatalistic. It’s up to you. You use or vivek- discretion and do what promotes your spiritual growth.\n\nOur accumulated samskaras, vasnas, desires, memories are accumulated life after life in the store house of prakriti. In each life a part of the store house is manifested and it becomes active. What we have done, dharma and adharma, right and wrong create samsakars in prakriti.\n\nKarma has two effects. One is called samsanskara.What we repeat, what we do again and again affects our mind. Our repeated actions become our habits and our habits become our character. Karma has another effect which is called Karma Phala-fruits of our action. It creates papa and punya- virtue and vice. Good and bad Karmas create events in our life-otr relationships with people like our parents, husband and wife and children,friends, our health and illness. This is called our Kramafala-the fruit of our actions, the outcome of our actions. Again how we live our daily life plants the seeds of good fruit or bad fruit. Prakriti is expressed in the form of raga and dvesha-likes and dislikes which guide our actions.We go for what we like and avoid what we don’t like. All our experiences go into prakriti.\n\nNature and nurture are very important concepts in understanding our karmas-actions. Nature is what we have inherited. It is genetic. Nurture is epigenetic. It refers to what kind of inner and outer environment we create that nurtures Nature. What happens to us in our life, how we are nourished and taken care of by the people and or by ourselves in our life. Both nature and nurture together is our prakriti. Our True nature is sat chit and ananda. That is called swarupa. It is universal. The problem is prakriti. Each person is different because of prakriti.\n\nJiva, our embodied self is thrust in the playing field. How do we play? Selfishly? Selflessly? The teaching of the Karmavada is simple and straightforward. We spiritualize our life by serving those who need our help in whatever we can provide it. The word loka sangraha used in the Bhagavad Gita is the key idea of living spiritually in a secular world. Secularity and spirituality are not separate from each other. Offer food to those who are hungry, Offer water to those who are thirsty. Teach those who are ignorant. Swami Vivekananda used to say to the monks: Jiva seva is Shiva seva. Serving others is Divine. Gandhiji called the poor daridra narayana- Poor Godly people. Recently the prestigious award Bhatnagar was awarded to a monk for his original contribution to the world of science by writing a book on Pure Mathematics and topology. Monks do not only serve the people in the ashram. They can serve and make a positive contribution to the society and world at large. What we need to change is our mindset. I remember a monk telling his students in Hindi: Jano ya na jano; mano ya na mano, sabme Rama hai. Know it or not, believe it or not. Rama resides in everyone-rich or poor. There is another way of conveying spiritual teaching. Sabibhumi Gopalki-Gopal, Krishna, resides everywhere in this world. Worship the living God right in front of you, the pepole. We may go to temples, do pooja, worship and do the rituals.The heart of spirituality is self-less service, serving people who need help.\n\nPrakriti yanti bhutani-all beings follow nature. Parakriti is composed of karmas done in our past lives as well as how we live our current life. This is where the viveka, discretion comes into play. What kinds of choices we make is up to us. We can shape our future by making wise choices that take us on a higher ground , practicing Karma Yoga. We extend our helping hands to those who need our help. Helping others is not social service, It is spiritual service.\n\nThere is another significant idea of Nature + Nurture. Nature or prakriti is genetic. We have inherited samskaras from previous lives. The past is beyond my control. How I relate to the karmas in the present life is up to me. I am not bound by my past karmas forever. The Gita does not believe in a fatalistic view of life. We can wake up from the sleep of ignorance and do the right thing. There is a Gujarati saying: jagya tyarthi savar. Morning is when we wake up and we keep our eyes open to do the right karmas. It’s never too late. We can provide nurturing conditions to the seeds already planted in the soil of our consciousness. This is very promising. We are not doomed by the past actions. We can resurrect ourselves from the past by choosing and following the right path. Our present spiritual work helps us to make a transformation in our life. We are not controlling, suppressing or repressing our samsakaras. We are channelizing our energy in the right direction and that way we are transforming ourselves.\n\nWhen we do spiritual practices like Nishkama Karma Yoga-Yoga with no selfish desires- we make our minds more sattvik. Spiritual growth is facilitated by the sattvic mind. Spiritual practices increase and maintain sattva guna and create sattvik mindset, sattvik personality. We cultivate sattvik traits. Before enlightenment all spiritual practices polish the mind, remove the accumulated dust in the mind. Our mind gets purified-chitta shuddhi. We are qualified for enlightenment, Self-realization. We are working on growth restricting prakriti. As Swami Vivekananda says, “ You cannot run away from the machine. You have to learn how to operate the machine that will set you free.” We have to know the inner workings of prakriti to be from the hold of the prakriti. We can transform our prakrit.\n\nBy doing right karmas and by meditation and prayer we can polish the mirror of our mind. A clean and clear mirror reflects our original face. Knowing what is like a flashlight that illuminates the object and we can see as it is without distortions. Seeing the truth liberates us from the chain of ignorance and distortions. Suppression and repression of our unwholesome desires is counter productive. They will show up in different guises following us and deuding us. This approach is menatlly and physically very harmful, not only to us but also to other people who come in contact with the perverted mind.\n\nVerse 34\n\nAttachment (raga) to the pleasant and aversion (dwesha) to the unpleasant are rooted (vyavashtitau) in the senses and sense objects (indriyasa indriyasyarthe). Do not be ruled by them or swayed by them (tayrona vasham agachet), for they (tau) indeed (hi) are obstacles (paripanthanau) or stumbling blocks in your spiritual path.\n\nTwo important words are mentioned in this verse-indriya and indriyartha. Indriya denotes the sense organs, and indriyartha denotes sense objects. In the relationship between these two words, there exists raga dvesha, attraction and aversion. All of us are governed in large measure by this duality of likes and dislikes. We are tied to what we like and also to what we do not like. When we like something or someone, we are thinking about that thing or that person. If we do not like something or someone, we stay away from that thing or that person. It is an emotional relationship, positive or negative. As long as we are dominated by likes and dislikes in the work we do, in our relationships, in our studies, in our food, we are compelled by our nervous system to move towards what we like and move away from what we dislike. Neurological studies show that what we think and what we feel has a strong impact on our prefrontal cortex, our executive brian. Relaxation response has a positive impact on the prefrontal cortex which is involved in making decisions. Belly breathing, palming our eyes, practicing Loving Kindness Meditation or Concentric Meditation also have a positive impact on the prefrontal cortex. Such simple practices recondition our nervous system. Sri Krishna is telling us, through Arjuna, that we should try everyday to calm the mind and not become agitated by likes and dislikes.\n\nShould we avoid doing many things we do not like though they may be beneficial to us and others? We all know relaxation, meditation and a healthy lifestyle are very helpful to us physically, menatlly, emotionally, relationally and spiritually. Everyday, we should do a few things we don’t like and try to do them with entusiasm. After some time we may enjoy doing them. One of the most graceful ways of learning to juggle with our likes and dislikes is to do things we dislike for those we love. For example, doing kitchen chores to help our dear one. We may not like doing some chores but when we do them mindfully and heartfully we feel great joy and gratitude.\n\nAnother way of overcoming diskies in the matter of work is to give more attention when we are becoming bored with a particular job. The simple cure for our boredom is to give a little more attention, a little more concentration. When we do it this way we may find how good this discipline is for our intellectual development. It is only after we have freed ourselves from the grip of likes and dislikes, raga and dvesha, we live in complete freedom and security. This is one of the significant teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. It is about making wise choices that help us cultivate spiritual maturity and move us on a higher level of living.\n\nWhat is the role of free will? And of spiritual teachings and instruction? Are they meaningless and powerless? Our prakriti is manifested in our reactions to people and objects. Reactions like anger, desire, greed. A desire-vasna , a thought of wanting or not wanting is generated in our mind (manas) . I see sugar candy. I like it( raga). If we hold onto that desire, that thought, we nourish it Then it becomes stronger. Then you express it in words (vacha) and then it becomes action( karma).. It is a three-stage process. What can we do about it? Use our judgment by asking questions like is it good for my health? Is it helpful for my spiritual path? If it is not good or helpful to me I let go of it. I discipline myself. I do not succumb to it. If I don’t act this way and if I get carried away by my impulse, I pay the price for it. Amazon shopping is largely based on impulsive buying. We click the button and we buy it instantly-instant gratification. In such situations we need to use viveka-discretion and renounce it-let go of it (vairagya).\n\nAt the level of vritti or desire act like a traffic policeman. Allow it if it is good, or avert it, intercept it or bypass it if it is harmful, or replace it-kartum, akartum, anyatha kartum-do it, do not do it or do it differently. Replace it with something benevolent. Prakriti changes by making wise choices, It is a transformation process. Good samskaras are created and they will help us walk on the spiritual path.This is called sadhana-spiritual practice. It becomes natural and effortless over time and only good tendencies or vrittis will arise in our mind. As prakriti is spiritualized, eventually it becomes natural and effortless to do the right actions. If we do not regulate our raga and dvesha we will be adding more samskaras in our prakriti. Only intellectual processes will not be enough to transform our prakriti. Prakriti is a body-mind complex. Body and mind interact with each other. Our intellect tells the body to get up early in the morning to do meditation. The body wants to stay in the comfortable warm bed. We know the benefits of meditation. We rise, We awake and follow the right path though it may be difficult in the beginning.\n\nThere is an interesting story about the body-mind complex. It’s a story of an elephant and mahut, the elephant rider. The elephant represents the body and the mahut represents intellect. Our challenge is to tame and train the elephant. We need the cooperation of the entire body and mind for sadhana. Right efforts and repetition are important for training the body and mind. This is the way we can change our prakriti. It is difficult but doable.\n\nBuddhi is intellect, our discerning- viveka, and decision making -nirnatmimika-faculty. Systematic and consistent repetition is essential in all spiritual practices such as jnanayoga-shravana, manana, and nididhyasana, Karma Yoga, Raja Yoga or Dhyana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga. It is not easy for everyone to follow our Dharma. As the sages say in the Kathopanishad: Uttishtha jagrata, prapya varan nibodhata kshurasya dhara nishita duratyaya durgapathatstey kavayoa vadanti. Rise. Wake up. Seek instruction. This path is sharp like a razor’s edge difficult to cross says the sages. Crossing the path maybe a struggle but no longer repression. We are diverting our energy to a higher spiritual goal. We are replacing one movement for another higher movement. We need to polish the mirror of our prakrit so that our real self is reflected, Our subconscious mind is purified.This is our sadhana for transforming our prakriti, our raga and dvesha. This polishing will lead us to self-realization. It will be a living reality.\n\nWhen we serve people unselfishly and unconditionally we are moving from sakama karma- actions to fulfill our personal self-serving desires and actions- to serving others without self-erving desires(nishkama karma)- Karma Yoga. We see the Divine in everyone. Our love extends to all. (Bhakti Yoga). We see God within and in others. We see unity in life (Jnana Yoga), We get totally absorbed in Divinity (raja Yoga). We follow Yoga according to our natural tendency. All other Yogas will complement our chosen spiritual path.\n\nVerse 35\n\nIt is better (shreyan) to strive (anutisthat) in one’s own dharma (swadharma) though deficient (vigunaha) than the dharma of another (paradharmat) well performed (swanutistaha). Better is death (nidhanam) in following one’s own dharma (swadharmam) than of another’s darma (paradharma) which breeds fear (bhayavaha).\n\nWe all have prakriti, our nature. There are two significant concepts we need to understand- Swarupa and Swabhava. Swarupa is our essence, our real nature, our atman.Our real nature is universal. Swabhava is our personal nature, our individualized personality.It is shaped by our past karmas but also by our present karmas. They are stored in our subtle body-sukshma sharira. Part of the past karma is activated in this life.\n\nThere are two other important concepts we need to understand- Nature and Nurture. They form Swabhava. Prakritim yanti butani (Verse 33) Even learned and jivanmukta people act according to their swabhava. Some follow Jnana Yoga, some follow Karma Yoga, some follow Raja Yoga or Dhyana Yoga and some follow Bhakti Yoga-Yoga of Devotion. The difference between the awakened people and the sleeping people is that the swabhava of the awakened people does not bind them. They may get upset or anxious but they recover from their emotional reactions fast. In our case we struggle with our swabhava, our prakriti.In prakriti there are resources that bind us down, preventing us from progression and there are some resources that help us grow spiritually. Arjuna has such inner resources. They can be tapped to walk on the path of spirituality by doing spiritual practices. Duryodana has a large stock of negative inner resources that keep him trapped and tied up.\n\nSwabhava manifests in mind-mamas-, then in speech- vacha-, and then in action-karma. In manas, mind, swabhava is manifested as raga and dwesh-likes and dislikes, attraction and aversion, approach and avoidance. They arise from swabhava, Normally we act according to them. They become obstacles in our spiritual journey. (Verse 34). This is where we have to act like a policeman. Allow the cars to go if they are going in the right direction. Stop them and divert them if they block or hinder our journey. Replace them with good cars that facilitate our spiritual progess. We must be awake and alert-jagrata and sajaga. If we do not nip in the bud the poison tree, it will need a lot of power to stop it growing.\n\nThis the core of a spiritual practice. Skilfully replace the raga dvesha that is taking us away from our spiritual life. Replace them with holy, sacred and spiritual desire, thought and action. Do not fall in the trap of raga dvesha. They are enemies of the person on the spiritual path.\n\nVerse 35\n\nBetter (shreyan) is to strive in your own dharma (swadharma), the law of one’s own nature though it has deficiencies (vigunaha) than to succeed (anutisthata) in the dharma of another (paradharma) Better (shreya) to die (nidhanam) in following in one’s own dharma (swadharme) than following something alien to your nature (paradharma). It breeds fear and anxiety (bhayavaha)\n\nThe central word used in this verse is Dharma. It is derived from the root dhri which means holds or supports, keeps us together. Dharma is the central law of our being., which is to extinguish our separateness and attain Self-realization, to lose ourselves and be united with God. It is a transformation. In Buddhism it is called nirvana, the extinction of self-will in union with the infinite. Ansari of Herat, a great Sufi mystic, tells us, “Know that you learn to lose yourself, you will reach the Beloved.” In Gita !2:8) Sri Krishna says, “ Still your mind in Me (mayi eva mana adhasya), let your intellect (buddhi) dwell in me in Me ( mayi buddhim niveshaya), and without doubt (na samshaya) you will live (mayya eva) in Me there after.”\n\nWhen we add swa to dharma, the word becomes swadharma, our personal dharma.We need to follow our personal dharma in the context of our life. On our spiritual path, we start from where we are by fulfilling our personal responsibilities as a member of our family, our society, our work and in the world. Our swadharma may change as our spiritual awareness deepens. Later on our , as our capacities grow, our opportunities and responsibilities for serving will grow. How can we make our job or profession a part of our spiritual living, our sadhana? Follow your own dharma. We do not need to compare and change our profession or the sphere of our activities. Be yourself completely and accept yourself completely.Living a spiritual life is like a boat that helps us cross samasar sagar or bhava samudra, the worldly ocean, and takes us to the other shore-the shore beyond worldly boundaries, the Divine shore, moksha-liberation.\n\nEach one of us has a different prakriti. Our personal dharma should be according to our prakriti. After listening to Sri Krishna’s teaching on sthitaprajna at the end of Chapter 2, Arjuna asked Krishna why he should fight and destroy his kith and kin. He would rather follow jnana yoga and act like a monk. To which Sri Krishna asks to follow his prakrit, his kshatriya dharma and do his duty. Each one of us has our own prakritik tendency for doing spiritual work and we follow it. Prakriti yanti bhutani. Follow your dharma, spiritual way of living, according to your individualized personality.\n\nThe word pradharma is used not as another religion. It was not about conversion. At that time three was only one dharma, sanatana dharma. Swadharma is according to one’s prakriti. Arjuna’s dharma was to follow his warrior prakriti. Dharma also means following moral, ethical and spiritual prescriptions. such as to tell the truth, live honestly, be loving, be generous,be faithful and loyal etc.\n\nThere are four cells in the matrix of dharma and prakriti.\n\nPrakriti and dharma.\n\nAdharma and prakriti\n\nAprakriti and dharma\n\nAprakriti and adharma\n\nArjun belongs to the first cell. His prakriti is of a warrior and he lives ethically, a dharmic life.\n\nDuryodana does not follow ethics. He lies, he manipulates and lives unethically. But he follows his warrior prakriti\n\nSomeone may noti live according to his prakriti but may follow the ethical laws.\n\nA few may be going against both, prakriti and dharma.. These will be the most difficult people to deal with.\n\nThere are 4 dharmas according to the ancient system\n\nSadharana dharma-general common ways of following moral principles.\n\nVarna dharma- dharma according to caste. This is changing in the modern world we live in.\n\nAshrama dharma- duties to perform according to the four stages of life.\n\nAsadharana dharma-Unique duty as a parent, as a teacher, as a family member, as a leader, and as a business person.\n\nSwami Vivekananda offers 4 indicators of a spiritual person. They are simple but very helpful.\n\n1.The way you live takes you toward God. Follow it.The way you live takes you away from God. Discard it\n\n2.That strengthens you on your spiritual path. Follow it.\n\nThat weakens you on your spiritual path. Discard it.\n\n3.That leads you to oneness , harmony and unity. Follow it.\n\nThat leads you to divisiveness and separateness. Discard it.\n\n4. That leads you to be unselfish. Follow it.\n\nThat leads you to selfishness. Discard it.\n\nQuestions to think on;\n\nHow as a spiritual seeker will you relate to social and political issues?\n\nNotice how your mind reacts to such issues. If the issue moves you then it is your dharma to face it. You do not run away from it or ignore it. Take an example of Mahatma Gandhi. When he was asked questions like are you a freedom fighter, a social reformer or a politician. His answer was, “ I am a simple man in search of God.. He was tremendously active to overcome social, political and economic injustice and against colonialism. One has to find his own way for addressing these issues. The four indicators given by Swami Vivekananda could be useful in deciding what to do when we face such situations.\n\nVerse 36\n\nArjuna uvacha. Aruna says:\n\nAtha (then) by what force (kena) is a man (purush) pushed or impelled (prayuktaha) to do wrong things, selfish deeds or a sin (papam) even if he doesn’t want to do it (anichhana apai) O Varshneya, Krishna as if urged by force (balat iva nitojitaha)?\n\nArjuna, like us, is a genuine seeker of spirituality. He has a great desire to lead a selfless life. This is a very human and personal question for all of us. Like Arjuna we want to lead the right life. We want to do good for every creature in the world. We want to enter into a state of abiding joy. Like Aruna we ask the question what force prevents us from carrying out these high ideals? What makes us fall over and over again and regret later on? What makes us go after personal profit and personal pleasure?\n\nThis question was asked by Durodhana in Pandava Gita. Duryodhana presents his dilemma in the following verse:\n\nJanami dharmam na cha me’ pravritti, janami adharmam na che me’ nivaritti.\n\nI know what is my dharma, my duty, but I do not perform it. I know what is my adharma but I still do it. He says there is some power of selfish desire, kama, in me that impells me to go against my dharma. He is so engulfed in his selfish desires that he is unable to do the right thing.\n\nThis is the central human problem. We know what is fair? What is not fair? What is right? What is wrong? What is just and what is unjust?What is moral and what is immoral?\n\nAsk yourself: What is my dharma at this stage in my life? Am I really ready to change? God realization is my goal. I act in such a way that my action is in alignment with my goal, in accordance with my goal. Follow your dharma though it may not be perfect. Swami Vivekananada advises us to follow our highest ideals and not to deviate from them. Follow your own prakriti. In our prakrita there are many things such as our tendencies, desires, thoughts, inclinations. Some of which may not take us Godward. Use nira-kshira viveka. Use your discretion and separate water from milk. Let go of water and drink milk that nourishes you. When we suffer by our own misdeeds or by the misdeeds of others, forgive yourself and others. Become aware of such deeds and let them go. Our spiritual practices help us recover fast from such harmful tracks. The intensity, frequency and duration of our suffering gets significantly decreased and our recovery from it will be faster. We need to be sincere and firm about our wish to follow our dharma- to change our misdirected and misdirecting path, and walk on the right path.\n\nVerse 37\n\nSri Bhagavan uvacha. Sri Krisna says:\n\nIt (esha) is selfish desire (kama) and anger (krodha), arising from (samudbhava) guna of rajas (rajo guna), all devouring and horatius (mahasahana) and most sinful (mahapama). Know (viddhi) this (etam) to be the enemy in the spiritual context (iha).\n\nOur enemy is within us. It is not a demon, a shetan, living outside of us. It is the negative part of our own swabhava, prakriti. Raga and dvesha pull us toward samsara. Kama and krodha, desire and anger, are our enemies. They take us away from our spiritual path. Both are within us. Forces of bondage(bandhana) and mukti(liberation) are within us. It is a tug of war and peace. In this verse kama krodha are put together. Kama is the root cause of krodha. When desire gets frustrated, when we do not get what we desire to get, we get angry. As Sri Krishna had said to Arujuna in Chapter 2 verse 62 kamat krodho bhijayate- anger arises from unfulfilled desire. The third block in our spiritual life is created by lobha, greed. When our desire is satisfied it turns into lobha-greed. Lobha has no dhobaha- there is no block to greed. I want something. I like something. I have a desire to get something. This is raga. I do not like it. I don’t want it. I don’t like it. This is dwesha. In both cases there is suffering. It traps us to the wheel of samsara.\n\nKama and krodha are our greatest enemies. Kama is selfish desire or self-will. It drives us to impose our will on all around us, to satisfy our selfish desires at the expense of others. Kama shows itself in many ways: in physical craving, greed for material possessions, lust for power, money and prestige.This drive for personal selfish satisfaction is inevitably connected with anger. It causes friction between two persons having selfish desires- a recipe for disaster and destruction.\n\nWhen we get free from our raga and dvesha, we are moving along on the path of spirituality. Spirituality channelizes our desire.\n\nAre there good and wholesome desres? Desire for God is infinite. Desire for meditation is wholesome. Desire for sensual pleasures and self-serving desires are finite. We use discretion-viveka. We follow desires that take us on a higher level of living or toward Godliness and we move away or discard desires that bring us down in our spiritual journey. Karma Yoga is a relatively easy and powerful path for self-realization. Swami Ranganathan, a self-realized swami puts it in two brief sentences. He says,” When I close my eyes-meditate- I find peace within. When I open my eyes I ask what can I do for others? This is Karma Yoga.\n\nVerse 38\n\nJust as (yatha) a fire (vhani) is covered (aviryate’) by smoke (dhumena), as a mirror (adarsh) is obscured by dust (malena), just as an embryo (garbha) is enveloped (avrutaha) by the womb (ulbena), so is this (idam) ( knowledge) covered by selfish passion.\n\nJust as a great pall of smoke obscures the fire blazing underneath, just so the pall of desire-selfish, self-willed- hides the blazing light of divinity, that shines forever in the depth of our consciousness.\n\nJust as a mirror is covered by dust, so is the knowledge of the Atman hidden by Kama, selfish passion. If you indulge your sense all of the time, exercising no discrimination in what you eat and drink, what you read, think, speak, and act , you will not be able to see your real self. You will see only the body, not the dweller within, only the house, not the resident. In order to see yourself as you are-as beautiful, loving, wise, universal- you must rise above physical consciousness. Put this into practice everyday by asking yourself,” In what ways can I guard myself against being trapped in body consciousness?” Once you ask this question , you see that everywhere there is a room to make wise choices. It is these right choices which will gradually enable you to rise above physical consciousness.\n\nSri Krisna uses the simile of the embryo, well protected and nurtured and hidden in the mother’s womb. Once the child comes out of the well protected and nourished inner environment, he naturally makes free movements. The mother needs to let go of holding her child in the womb who is ready to be liberated.\n\nWith these three similes Shri Krishna reminds us that the Atman is always within us. But we bring all kinds of covers to hide his glory. Depending on one’s past karmas, some may need more time than others to be free from these covers. This is spiritual work, sadhana. Instead of bringing more covers or envelopes at home, start removing them, letting them go using your will power. Do not burden yourself by adding more covers. The moment we begin to restrain our senses diligently and practice other spiritual disciplines, we shall see that envelope after envelope- or as the Sufis say, veil after veil- falls away until we at last see the Divine face in the depths of our own consciousness. Such knowledge, such wisdom, liberates us for Self-realization, the supreme purpose of life. It removes suffering and brings joy-dukkha nivrutti, ananada prapti.\n\nVerse 39\n\nO son of Kunti, wisdom (jnanam) is covered (avrutam) by this eternal (nitya) enemy (vairina) of the wise (janino), by this unquenchable or insatiable (duspoorena) fire (anala) of passion (kamarupena) for self- satisfaction.\n\nArjun’s question and inquiry applies to all of us who are on the path. We make mistakes in spite of the fact that we know they are mistakes. Our knowledge is obscured by the constant enemy, different forms of self-satisfying worldly desires. It habituates us. Satisfying our personal and self-serving desires have a strong hold on us. Our selfish desires are hard to conquer.And they are never fully fulfilled. There is always one more desire to satisfy. It is never-ending. Tanha, craving, as Buddha says is hard to satisfy. Tanha or trishna is the cause of suffering. He shows the way of freeing oneself from the grip of tanha. He found the way of freeing oneself from the craving, his ashtanga marga-eightfold noble path.\n\nSelf-awareness, discretion, non-attachment, self-effort, and self-discipline are necessary for restraining our selfish passion. The Gita says that to be able to use anything wisely we must not be attached to it. Gandhiji provides the best lesson of living a simple but rich life. At the time of his death his material possessions were worth only two dollars. He had no selfish craving and no personal attachment.\n\nIn this verse Sri Krishna uses the strong word kama which means keeping our eyes only what will serve and satisfy our personal needs at the exclusion of the rights and needs of others. Living this way we create bad karmas. Sri Krishna advises Arjuna and that way to all of us who are on the spiritual path to be vigilant against the blandishments of the desire for selfish satisfaction. It could be craving of the senses or the urge to enforce self-will on those around us.\n\nIf we are not vigilant, little by little this will become a fierce enemy any time we succumb to a selfish desire. Any time we yield to a selfish desire, we are actually strengthening our enemy.\n\nVerse 40\n\nIndriyani (the senses), mano (mind), buddhihi (intellect) asya adhishtanam (its aboode) uchyate (are said to be). The senses. mind, and intellect are said to be the abode of the desire, passion or lust. Avrutya (veiling or obscuring) jnanam (knowledge) etaihi (by these senses) vimohayati eva (it indeed deludes) dehinam( the embodied (soul), the sentient being or jiva.\n\nWe normally think desire is something that is mental, an internal instrument-antahkarana: manas -mind- and buddhi-intellect. Here shri Krishna says desire pervades both, senses-outer instrument-bahirkarana and mind and intellect. The senses, indriyas, are within us but they contact the external world, the sensory objects, indriyarthas. Sense organs gather information from the outside world and they present it to the mind and intellect. This information is stored in the memory, in the mind. Memory, mind and intellect are parts of the inner instrument because they are not in direct contact with the external world. Senses provide the information to the mind and intellect.\n\nKama has three houses or hide outs-senses, mind and intellect. His favourite house is indryas, the five senses: eyes for seeing, tongue for tasing, nose for smelling, ears for healing and hands for touching. If we want to see Kama, we do not need to look very far at meal time to see which is his favorite room.\n\nKama’s second house is the mind.where he lives during the turbulent periods, where it has to struggle between conflicting desires. Strong desires obscure or overwhelm the thinking mind. The thinking mind may get defeated by the pull of strong passions especially sexual desires or desire for power, money, prestige and possessions.The lust for power in our modern age is responsible for so much misery and suffering all over the world. Samapakavikalpatmika mannha.\n\nKama’s third house is buddhi, intellect. Nischaityatmika buddhi. The function of intellect is to apply discretion in making right and wise choices. Senses over power buddhi. When the intellect is overwhelmed by the power of sensual desires there is a huge downfall in one’s life. Vivekabrasthanam bhavati vinipataha shatamukhaha says a learned poet. When the intellect loses its capacity to discriminate between right and wrong, the downfall is hundred fold.\n\nThe energy flows through the senses unless it is channelized or it is controlled by the mind at the sensory level.This is the first level The next level is the mind where the sensory data is collected and coordinated. Should I keep it or discard it? This is a crucial level. If the mind loses its control then it will be very difficult to stop the sensual energy. The mental faculty of control is lost. Buddhi, intellect is a discriminating faculty. Since the mind has lost control over senses, it will be very hard for buddhi to exercise its discriminating capacity. Buddhi is defined as nishchayatmika antahakaran buddhi. Buddhi is the discriminating faculty. Buddhi makes the wise choices. Since the mind has lost its control it will be difficult for buddhi to make the wise and right choice. Buddhi is affected by the wavering mind. Intellect is deluded and confused at the moment of decision making. We decide to do sadhana spiritual practices like meditation,-Raja Yoga, selfless service, Karma Yoga, worship and devotion Bhakti Yoga or Self-realization- Jnana Yoga. Losing control of senses, mind and intellect makes it very hard to do sadhana in spite of our wish to do spiritual practice.\n\nSelf-control is the key in following Karma Yoga in our daily transactions..We can render a great service by listening to opposite opinions without agitation, attack, discoutsey and violence. Gandhiji showed the world that we can state our point of view, our case in simple, gentle,and respectful language. We should provide a model to our children,students, and employees by listening to them empathically and respectfully.\n\nVerse 41\n\nTasmat (therefore) tvam (you) niyamya indriyani ( restraining the senses) adau (first)) Bharatarshabha ( O mighty prince, the best of Bharat,) niyamya (control) indriyani (senses), (hi) indeed prajahi (destroy) evam (this) papanam (wicked) enemy. Who is the nashanam ( destroyer) of jnana (knowledge) and vignanam (spiritual wisdom).\n\nThere is nothing wrong in having a desire. We may have a noble desire to acquire knowledge, to take care of our body, to help others selflessly, to do spiritual practices and teach good things. It becomes a problem when we have selfish desires or desire to steal or desire to hurt ourselves or hurt others and when such desires take control of our mind and intellect. Such desires need to be controlled, restrained, and disciplined. We should not let such harmful desires control us. We should be in control of such desires.\n\nWe begin our conquest of Kama by controlling senses which is very much like training a puppy. We can train our senses if we have a deep and ardent desire to bring them under control. Sri Krishna tells us through Arjuna to put to death the greed or craving for harmful pleasure, personal profit, prestige and power. It is our worst enemy which prevents us from living in peace, joy, and contentment and attaining spiritual wisdom.\n\nIn the Ramayana, the great Indian epic book, there are two opposite characters. Rama represents selfless service and the ten- headed Ravana represents selfish satisfaction.. Both exist within us. When Rama faces Ravana on the battlefield, he severs all ten heads of his enemy at once without delay. This is how we must slay or get rid of the barriers between us and the selfish “I”, the main barrier between us and God. In our daily life we begin the conquest of Ravan by serving others selflessly doing Karma Yoga.\n\nSri Krisna describes the charecteristics of Sthitaprajna to Aruna in Chapter 2, verse 55. of the Bhagavad Gita. Sthitaprajna is a jivanmukta person, a person who is free from the bondage of selfish desire or craving.Sri Krisna says to Arjuna, “ Prjahati yad kaman sarvan partha monogatan. Atman eva sthita pragnastadochyate,” When a man renounces all cravings of the mind and dissatisfied in the self by the self, then he is called a man of steady wisdom.” Without control of senses one cannot attain enlightenment and without enlightenment one cannot be under control of senses. Sri Ramanujacharya suggests to turn our desire, to channelize our desire by devotion to the Lord; by following the path of love- Bhakti Yoga.\n\nVerse 42\n\nIndriyani parani ahur indriyebhyaha param man"
