        "text": "King Charles III boasts a bloodied family tree thanks to an infamous distant relative.\n\nThe newly appointed monarch is a descendant of Vlad the Impaler, the 15th century ruler of the Romanian region of Wallachia, famous for his namesake torture method.\n\nVlad was known to kill his enemies by impaling them on wooden stakes, initiating an excruciating death that could sometimes take up to three days. His brutal actions made him the assumed inspiration for Bram Stoker’s “Dracula.”\n\nAccording to Romania Tour Store, Charles, 73, is the great-grandson 16 times removed of Vlad, through the consort of George V, Queen Mary.\n\nIn fact, the new British king has a longtime love for Romania, especially Transylvania, which he first visited in 1998.\n\nSince then, he bought and restored an 18th century cottage in the village of Viscri.\n\nHe’s also done charity work in the region through the Prince of Wales Foundation, including farming systems, sustainable development and conservation endeavors.\n\nGet the latest on Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral with The Post’s live coverage\n\nIn 2017, the mayor of the city of Alba Iulia claimed they invited Charles to accept the honorary title of Prince of Transylvania for his love and commitment to the region."
