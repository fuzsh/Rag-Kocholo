        "text": "According to historian Hayden White history bears a strong resemblance to literature and is in need of emplotment. In this paper I will attempt to support this theory, using the historical figure of Vlad III Dracula as a case study. Being a rather controversial figure even during his lifetime in the 15th century, Vlad, also known as Ţepes (the Impaler), became even more notorious after his death. First of all, the literature that began to circulate by the Saxons in the 15th century continued to spread well into the 17th century and triggered various oral traditions, some negative and some positive. This dichotomy soon became the norm as even historians debated whether Vlad III was the monster that some sources made him out to be. However, a novel written by an Irish author, Bram Stoker, in the end of the 19th century was bound to add yet another dimension to the infamous Wallachian Prince. As on one hand Count Dracula was readily associated with the historical Vlad III, especially in the West thus enhancing his monstrosity, on the other hand Romanian historiography was beginning to present Vlad Dracula as a national hero. This became even more prevalent during the 20th century and more specifically during Ceausescu’s reign so that it would fit the national ideology. So, it would seem that Vlad III is a rather good example to showcase Hayden White’s theory, since his story has been the subject of emplotment for centuries and continues to do so well into the 21st century\n\nThis book explores cases of decapitation found in sources on the reign of Alexander the Great. Despite the enormous literature on the career of Alexander the Great, this is the first study on the characterisation of violent deaths during his hectic reign. This historiographical omission has involved the tacit and blind acceptance of the details found in the ancient sources. Therefore, this book seeks to illustrate how cultural expectations, literary models, and ideological taboos shaped these accounts and argues for a close and critical reading of the sources. Given the different cultural considerations surrounding decapitation in Greek and Roman cultures, this book illustrates how those biases could have differently shaped certain episodes depending on the ultimate writer. This book, therefore, can be especially interesting for scholars focused on the career of Alexander the Great, but also valuable for other Classicists, philologists, and even for anthropologists because it represents a good case of study of cultural symbolism of violent death, semantics of power, imperial domination and the confrontation between opposite cultural appreciations of a practice.\n\nToday’s image of the vampire in Russia is a fascinating case study in how people both bring Slavic folklore to life in the digital age and how they make use of developing technologies to participate in political protest. For instance, online commentators and political cartoonists portray Russia’s current president, Vladimir Putin, as a modern-day vampire who feeds on the dual policies of expansionism and political repression. On the other hand, his uncanny ability to avoid the signs of aging bolsters his hold on power and further aligns Putin with the vampire and the character’s subsequent iterations in popular culture. Using the vampire to convey political and social anxieties predates Putin’s presidency. Given the vampire’s possession of taboo knowledge and its ability to wreak havoc on communities, the figure appears as a simulacrum for a politically savvy, yet heinously unjust, ruler. From the tyrannical Vlad Dracula (1431-1476) who impaled his advisories and then reportedly drank their blood, to the display of Vladimir Lenin’s (1870-1924) embalmed, seemingly “undead” body on Moscow’s Red Square, longevity of the state has paralleled the search for ultimate sovereignty, both in life and in death. This article examines a variety of folktales, fiction (including Stoker's Dracula and Pelevin's Empire V) and media (including film and memes). We argue that the supernatural in modern Russia in the form of the vampire myth performs paradoxical functions, in that it both serves to legitimize the autocratic state, while at the same time is weaponized (by journalists, artists, Internet users) to critique the Putin regime"
