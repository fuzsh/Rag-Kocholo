        "text": "If you can read Romanian (or want to struggle with inputting the text into Google Translate, which is kinda adequate for rendering Romanian into English), there is a very detailed and scholarly treatment of the wives of Vlad at pp. 151-159 of this PDF.\n\nThis source is reference [134] in the following discussion from English Wikipedia:\n\n\"Vlad had two wives, according to modern specialists.[134][135] His first wife may have been an illegitimate daughter of John Hunyadi, according to historian Alexandru Simon.[134] Vlad's second wife was Jusztina Szilágyi, who was a cousin of Matthias Corvinus.[134][136] She was the widow of Vencel Pongrác of Szentmiklós when \"Ladislaus Dragwlya\" married her, most probably in 1475.[137] She survived Vlad Dracul, and first married Pál Suki, then János Erdélyi.[136]\"\n\nAs I read the table on p. 159 of the PDF, though, it is suggested that Mihnea was a son not of Vlad's unknown first wife (the \"unknown Transylvanian noblewoman\"), but rather of an unknown mistress before the first marriage.\n\nSo here is my attempt at feeding the relevant sections of Hasan's 2013 article through Google Translate.\n\n\"Like his grandfather, Mircea, Vlad benefited from the monographs that were intended to be exhaustive, but two recent studies [footnote refers to studies in Romanian by Alexandru Simon] have drawn attention to the possibility of the existence of two wives from the Hunedoara family: the one from 1462, which is said to have been his summer Mathias Corvin [this phrase makes no sense to me], and Justina Szilágyi Horogszegi, who was certainly Mathias' cousin.\n\nIf about the first wife was written as much as possible at this time [I think this means \"will be written as much as possible in a short time\"], there are several things to mention about Justina, since the sources are more numerous. Pál Engel considered her the daughter of Ladislaus Szilágyi, starting with Dezsó Csánki, who nevertheless claimed to be the daughter of Osvaldus, the niece of a Franciscus. András Kubinyi considered her, rather, Osvaldus' daughter. In a deed dated May 28, 1479 of King Mathias to the convent in Cluj Mănăștur, he named her Justina, the daughter of Osvaldus. On June 9, 1496, she is mentioned as the daughter of Ladislaus. Probably the first assertion, [even though] being older, is not the real one. She must have been born after 1450, until 1455, and as a family she came from the border of Timiș and Cenad counties. We believe that her father, Ladislaus, died when Justina was at most one year old and then this would explain this bivalence of fathers. Osvaldus must have adopted his niece into his family. The first of the family to succeed in removing this family of nobles from the anonymity of their native county was Ladislaus, who became a relative of the powerful Johannes Mároti, and from this position occupied, in turn, the position of vicecount of Válkó [1404], vicecount of Bács [1405], and castelan of Srebernik [1405-1408], all in the South of the kingdom [of Hungary]. Ladislaus had several brothers, who did not survive. From his marriage to Katherina Bellenyi, several children were born, six in number, three girls and three boys. Elisabeth, the first daughter, married Ioan de Hunedoara, the future regent of Hungary, and Osvaldus, the first son, married Agata Posáfi, became the relative of Ioan de Hunedoara, and had a daughter, Margareta. In 1446 he became count of Timiș county. The second son, Mihail, also became familiar with the future governor and even became the count of Bistrita and governor in the first years of his nephew, [King] Mathias [Corvinus]. Ladislaus, the third son, did not hold public office, but we can guess that, like his brothers, he was familiar with the Hunedoara family. We do not know who he married, but he certainly had a daughter, Justina, who grew up in the turbulent years after the death of Ioan de Hunedoara. We do not know where she spent her childhood and adolescence, probably on the family's possessions in Timiș or Cenad, and she first married, probably at the suggestion of the family, around 1474 to Ladislaus (Vencel) Pongrác, son of Pancratius Liptói, count Liptó of the Bogomér family.\""
