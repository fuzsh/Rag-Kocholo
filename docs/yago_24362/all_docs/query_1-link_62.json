This particular kind of magic predates the modern word-based magic via incantations and was considered by some to be more powerful than most due to the esoteric nature of blood, as user has the inherent power in their blood, they can cast extremely powerful spell. Blood Magic was a kind of magic based on the employment of blood which is an important component in many rituals, spells and other aspects of the supernatural world, an due to the supernatural properties of the user's blood they can inherit specific magical blood-based powers (E.g. Blood Manipulation). Due to diversity of blood, users can used different blood type to preform different forms of spells which can bound to the blood they used.\n\nMental characteristics\n\nSocial\n\nReign\n\nThe Burning of Emberose and the Fall of the House of Embers\n\nUpon taking the Throne of Wallachia and murdering the usurper Malik Rhysford of the House of Embers, Voivode Vlad organized his forces for an offensive on the heart of the House of Embers, on their Seat of Power, the planet Emberose. The sudden attack on Emberose after such a bloody rebellion was unexpected but the Ember House was not unprepared for an attack. They raised their planetary shielding and activated their orbital defense systems, The Wallachians didn't have the tech to penetrate the dome or destroy all the ODSs, so the Embers dug in for a short siege. But they misunderstood the Wallachian's goals, and they underestimated Dracula Vlad III. Spilling the blood of 200 Mages as a sacrifice, Vlad used his magics to conjure a cosmic storm right on top of Emberose. Solar Flares and Cosmic Winds disrupted technology outside the shielding and ate away at the integrity of the barrier. And when it failed, Vlad released every nuclear warhead the Wallachian Empire was capable of building and bombarded the planet for three weeks straight. Vlad left the cosmic storm over Emberose, which was now the eye of the storm, but no starship could safely enter or leave it. To this day, it remains and has been known as the Devil's Eye. Some serval other smaller House Ember colonies were dealt with until a formal surrender was accepted by Voivode Vlad. The Embers were wiped out and the last member of the main line, Maria-Rhoderika, was wed to Prince Radu III. And thus, Vlad's revenge for the death of his father and brother was complete.\n\nAlucard, the Inverse of Dracula\n\nAt the capital city on the planet Wallachia, as the Knights of Camelot pressed into the kingdom, Count Vlad was approached by his son, Prince Mizan, named el-Alucard \"The Alucard\", the antithesis of his father. Wielding his Moonveil long sword, Mizan crossed blades with his father as their kingdom fell apart around them. Vlad was a master of Blood Magic and an Eight-Arts Mage, but he found his son to match him by every metric and was ultimately felled. The death of Vlad marked the defeat of the Wallachian Blood Empire and the defeat of The Nosferatu.\n\nFamily Ties\n\nVlad Dracula II | Parent ♂\n\nEupraxia Moldavescu | Parent ♀\n\nRadu Dracula III | Sibling ♂\n\nVlad Dracula IV | Sibling ♂\n\nAlexandra Dracula | Sibling\n\nMircea Dracula II | Sibling ♂\n\nVlad III was the favorite child of his mother and loved by his father because he could learn to do anything he set his mind to. After the death of his parents and Prince Mircea II, Vlad III, Radu III, and Vlad IV vowed a blood pact of revenge and were bonded in their hatred. After they liberated their homeland again, his relationship with his sister Princess Alexandra became strained. During the Civil War, her son by the usurper, Prince Saint-Valeryion, was cut down and Vlad sought to butcher all the bastards and made a ghastly example of 4 of her remaining 6 children. She removed herself from the House of Drăculești and eloped with her last two living children to Realms unknown.\n\nJustina Szilágyi | Spouse ♀\n\nMihnea Dracula | Offspring ♂\n\nVlad-Drakwlya Dracula | Offspring ♂\n\nValdric Dracula | Offspring ♂\n\nIntisaar | Spouse ♀\n\nMizan el-Alucard | Offspring ♂\n\nRomanitza Cojoc | Spouse ♀\n\nAdam Dracula | Offspring ♂\n\nVergil Dracula | Offspring ♂\n\nVlad-Brândușa Dracula | Offspring ♀\n\nMihaela Dracula | Offspring ♀\n\nEupraxia Dracula II | Offspring ♀\n\nVlad-Gheorghe Dracula | Offspring ♂\n\nReligious Views\n\nVirgil\n\nHonorary & Occupational Titles\n\nVoivode of Wallachia\n\nThe 1st Dark Lord of the Night\n\nThe Father of the Nosferatu\n\nThe 1st Vampire\n\nVlad the Impaler\n\nAge\n\n500+\n\nCircumstances of Death\n\nKilled by his son Prince Mizan on the Throne of Wallachia during the Fall of the Wallachian Blood Empire\n\nSex\n\nMale\n\nEyes\n\nPiercing Orange / Yellow\n\nHair\n\nLong Black / Brown Curly\n\nSkin Tone/Pigmentation\n\nWhite / Cream\n\nHeight\n\n7'1\"\n\nWeight\n\n250 Lbs.\n\nQuotes & Catchphrases\n\n\"The pursuit of power is not for the faint of heart, nor the feeble of mind. It is a relentless pursuit, an unquenchable thirst that drives us to the brink of madness. But in the end, it is the wielder of power who dictates the course of history, and those who dare stand in our path are mere pawns in our grand design.\"\n\n\"In the crucible of war, when empires clash and destinies are forged, it is the strength of one's resolve that sets them apart. For I have seen the mightiest of armies crumble before the unyielding will of a single individual. Power is not solely measured in numbers; it is the indomitable spirit, the unwavering belief in one's own supremacy, that can turn the tide of any battle.\"\n\n\"The annals of history are stained with the blood of conquerors and the tears of the conquered. To wield power is to write one's own chapter in this eternal saga. But remember this, my brethren: Power is but a double-edged sword, for it can elevate you to the heavens or cast you into the abyss. Choose your path wisely, for in the end, it is not the throne that defines a ruler but the legacy they leave behind.\"\n\n\"Mercy is a luxury that the powerful cannot afford, for it is often mistaken as weakness. To show mercy to my enemies would be to invite chaos and rebellion, to sow the seeds of my own demise. In the unforgiving world of power and conquest, ruthlessness is the currency of survival.\"\n\n\"My enemies, those who have dared to challenge me, have chosen their path. They have declared their intentions with steel and blood. To show them mercy would be to betray the sacrifices of those who fought and bled by my side. In this crucible of conflict, there is no room for clemency.\"\n\nCreative Sources\n\nCompiled list of (free) sites, tools, and links I use for various assets or art in SEVEN SEALS\n\nArticle, World, & Icons made with Bannersnack (FREE)\n\nCharacter Portraits & Landscapes made with ArtBreeder (FREE)\n\nExternal Family Tree Tool is FamilyEcho (FREE)\n\nUnique Symbols & Signs from Cool Symbols (FREE)\n\nVarious Fantasy Names generated from Fantasy Name Generator (FREE)\n\nSci-Fi inspired names & Generators via Donjon (FREE)\n\nFlags & Shields made with Armoria"
