        "text": "few people knew that the story’s main character was based on Vlad III. Despite being different people, they both lived in the same region. Vlad III was born in Sighisoara, a Transylvanian city, in 1431. The house where Vlad was born in is still built and can be visited. He grew up in Tirgoviste and was raised by his mom, Princess Cneajna. She made sure that Vlad and his brothers went to Church and received communion from the monks. Vlad’s father made sure that Vlad and his brothers grew up to become fierce warriors. Vlad and his older brother Mircea were the toughest of Vlad Dracul’s sons. They resembled their father’s features and attitude. Radu, however, was not as outgoing as his brothers were. He liked to spend time with his male friends and was believed to be…\n\ncentury, Vlad III has been called by many names. He has been called Vlad Dracula and Vlad Tepes, or Vlad the Impaler. This came from his habit of punishment by impalement, displaying them on stakes. He would become well known for his cruelty.The Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund founded the Order of the Dragon in 1410, to defend Europe from the Ottoman Turks and uphold Christianity. Vlad's father, Vlad II, joined the order and became known as Vlad Dracul, or Vlad the dragon. As such, Vlad III became…\n\npowerful rulers of that era, and as to his constant battles with the Ottoman Empire and also against the Christian forces in that region. Vlad III is known as Vlad the impaler or Vlad Tepes (in Romanian) after his atrocious ways of torture and killing and his lust for human blood. As result of this fact, many cultures have depicted him as blood sucking demon. While other cultures, mainly in Eastern Europe, saw him as a hero and a savior of the people against outer threats. EARLY LIFE OF VLAD -…\n\ninfamous Wallachian ruler Vlad III Drăculea, they think of the famous literary monster of nightmares, Bram Stoker’s Count Dracula. Dracula, who has appeared in many media outlets from the big screen of Hollywood to the bright lights of Broadway, is thought by many to have been inspired by the Wallachian Voivode that is better known as Vlad the Impaler. There is, however, little evidence that backs this assumption. In fact, there is actually a lot of evidence that refutes the idea that Stoker…\n\n\"Our soldiers mixing with theirs entered the fortress and conquered the city which I set in fire\". Facts,myths and legends about a long dead ruler come back to life by an Irish author named Bram Stoker in a new form but carries the same name Dracula a character placed in many good and bad films but many people in the United states don't know his real name but in Romania people know him as vlad the impaler. The terrifying legend of Vlad the impaler or more commonly known as Dracula. A man that…\n\nA vast, haunting darkness filled the sky, storms looming. The streets of the Transylvanian town were filled with merchants and townsfolk bustling around, making any last purchases before the rain began to pour. Vlad III, or Dracula, his preferred title, was also among those in the streets. However, he was not shopping. Instead, he was inviting people to a feast that would be held at his house. He felt that his feasts were most enjoyable, and many of his guests would agree. In fact, most would…\n\nVlad III was born in the year of 1431. He was not an ordinary baby, he was born as the prince of Wallachia and later to become the prince of Romania too. Vlad III had a nick name he created for himself, this nickname was Vlad the Impaler. He got this nickname form brutally murdering his victims by impalement. He had a very sick way of “justice”. His only form of justice in fact was brutally murdering people in many different ways. Most people now a days know Vlad III by the name of Dracula.…\n\nPrince Vlad of Wallachia ,got his fame from being one of the most evil men in history. We all know him as dracula, they get this from “his father ivan the terrible and the nickname \"Dracul\" means either \"devil\" or \"dragon\". So \"Draculea\" means either \"son of the devil\" or \"son of the dragon\"(Gale...). Although he has had a hard life. What am I saying, I'm getting ahead of myself. “Prince Vlad was born 1431 in Sighisoara, Romania. Vlad was not very tall, but stocky and strong with a bull's…\n\nDracula vs Vlad the Impaler It is a known fact that Bram Stoker based his famous novel ‘Dracula’ on the legend of Vlad III, Prince of Wallachia. Vicious acts that defy humanity, but most importantly his insatiable thirst for blood and the fact that he impales all his enemies still twitching bodies on a stick earned him his nickname Vlad Tepes, or Vlad the Impaler in english. Although the word ‘dracula’ has a distinctive meaning than the word people associate it with today, a vampire. ‘Dracula’…\n\nat one time. In Transylvania, Romania was count Dracula, otherwise known as “Vlad IV, 1431?–1476, prince of Wallachia (1448, 1456–62, 1476), known as Vlad the Impaler.
