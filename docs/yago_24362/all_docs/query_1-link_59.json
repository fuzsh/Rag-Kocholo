He was posthumously dubbed Vlad the Impaler (Romanian: Vlad Țepeș), and was a three-time Voivode of Wallachia, ruling mainly from 1456 to 1462, the period of the incipient Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. His father, Vlad II Dracul, was a member of the Order of the Dragon, which was founded to protect Christianity in Eastern Europe. Vlad III is revered as a folk hero in Romania as well as other parts of Europe for his protection of the Romanian population both south and north of the Danube. A significant number of Romanian and Bulgarian common folk and remaining boyars (nobles) moved north of the Danube to Wallachia, recognized his leadership, and settled there following his raids on the Ottomans.\n\nAs the cognomen 'The Impaler' suggests, his practice of impaling his enemies is part of his historical reputation. During his lifetime, his reputation for excessive cruelty spread abroad to Germany and elsewhere in Europe. The name of the vampire Count Dracula in Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula was inspired by Vlad's patronymic.\n\nHouse of Drăculești\n\nThe Drăculești were one of two major rival lines of Wallachian voivodes of the House of Basarab, the other being the Dănești. These lines were in a constant contest for the throne from the late fourteenth to the early sixteenth centuries. Descendants of the line of Drăculești would eventually come to dominate this principality until its unification with Transylvania and Moldavia by Mihai Viteazul in 1600.\n\nThe line of the Drăculești began with Vlad II Dracul, son of one of the most important rulers of the Basarab dynasty, Mircea cel Bătrân. The name Drăculești is derived from the membership of Vlad II Dracul, \"the Dragon,\" in the Order of the Dragon (founded 1408). One of his sons was Vlad III Draculea, (Son of Dracul).\n\nSources\n\nSee also:\n\nWikipedia: Vlad the Impaler\n\nWikipedia: House of Drăculești\n\nThe Real Dracula - Live Science.com\n\nPosthumous execution: Wikipedia: Posthumous execution.
