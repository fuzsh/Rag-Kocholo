        "text": "Support me by buying me a coffee ☕\n\nWhen people think of Vampires the first things that might come to mind are Nosferatu, Dracula and Twilight, But did you know that there was a real-life counterpart Vlad The Impaler?\n\nVlad III, commonly known as Vlad the Impaler, was born 1428–1431 in Transylvania. A mountainous area in Romania nowadays. His father, Vlad II Dracul, was the principality ruler of Wallachia, which is situated south of Transylvania. Following his admittance into the Order of the Dragon, a Christian military order backed by the Holy Roman emperor, Vlad II was given the surname Dracul, which means “dragon”.\n\nTransylvania and Wallachia, which were sandwiched between Christian Europe and the Muslim areas of the Ottoman Empire, often saw violent conflicts as Christian Crusaders either drove out the invading Ottoman forces or advanced eastward towards the Holy Land.\n\nVlad II brought his infant sons Radu and Vlad III with him to a diplomatic visit with Sultan Murad II in 1442. However, the gathering turned out to be a trap, as the three were taken into custody. Released from prison, the older Vlad agreed to leave his boys behind."
