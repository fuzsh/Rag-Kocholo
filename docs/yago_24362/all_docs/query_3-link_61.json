        "text": "A bow to you all,\n\nI have been holding onto this since 2019 unpublished. It seems due to be 'dusted off' and finally published on Wattpad. Some things to note, before you begin to enter, this complicated romance is based on the past.\n\nVlad's surname I chose to use is Draculesti, instead of Draculea/Dracula, and is the family name related to the Basarabs. Names and places are fairly accurate, but this story is also loosely based. The year begins in 1460, and Vlad III is still Voivode of Wallachia. In historical dates, his first wife (possibly a concubine) is believed by many to have died in 1462 by suicide. Still to this day, her name is not even known, and so is listed only as died with no details by historians. I have decided to make an author liberty in telling this historical based story, as his wife/ concubine died in the winter of 1459.\n\nA concubine is defined as a woman (in polygamous societies) who lives with a man but is not married to him. These women have lower status than his wife or wives.\n\nMisogynism (misogynist is a person who hates or doesn't trust women) is a part of this story. In fact, this was what the Church (overall) and men in power/nobles deemed truth about women. We know now that just horrible conditions were for most women. Any woman could bear the next male heirs when it came to the Wallachia throne and not just a Noble birth, married wife. Hence, a male child could be a fish merchant, and then discovered an heir child of the late voivode becomes a possible ruler. This was due to Ottoman influence, concubines play more of a role, besides sexual pleasure, the child would have rights to the throne and nobility that their mother wouldn't have themselves.\n\nHaving been a political prisoner of Sultan Mehmed's father, Vlad is a worldly man of sorts and has been taught more about sexual performance and satisfaction of a woman, to a certain point. He's more educated in this area of medieval life, and it was known that orgasm increased the chance of becoming pregnant for the woman.\n\nIn some respects, Ottoman Turk women had more rights, such as their own businesses. Pantaloons were allowed to be worn instead of dresses, being the only choice in the Medieval Society of Europe.\n\nThe grooming and hygiene (new articles about such details available online currently) of Vlad's body, with baths, comes from a medieval fact that the church feared public bathing houses. The church leaders feared bath houses lead to lust and that too many baths were taken as a problem. So contrary to certain Medieval wives' tales, taking a bath was a common occurrence.\n\nAs for water in general, it was safe to drink for the most part. Rainwater was the best, according to online sources. Yet water doesn't have a 'taste' per say, so ale and wine were drunk due to having a pleasant taste.\n\nThe female protagonist is Sabine, a stubborn and ahead of her time thinker. Depending on the regions of Europe, she would have been tortured and burned at the stake. Yet outstanding women who 'bucked' the society norms in their age are still recorded in literature of the time. Queen Elizabeth I of England and Joan of Arc are but two examples.\n\nThere is some content that is based around Vlad III Dr«éculea's historical-based ruthlessness as the Voivode of Wallachia. The Prince was known for extreme violence, brutal forms of torture, and the final act of execution. Yet Dr«éculea was a master tactician and considered a great warrior in his time. His knowledge of the Ottoman army and Sultan Mehmed made Vlad an extremely valuable leader as a commander of armies.\n\nJust in his surname alone, there are hints to how people viewed him. His father was called Dragul, meaning beloved but also called Dracul, which means devil. The name allies and friends used for Vlad III was Dragulia, which means 'beloved' also denoting he is the son of Dragul and it was his enemies who called him Dr«éculea/ Dracula. In the 1500s, long after his death, the Ottoman Turks nicknamed him Kazikli bey (Sir Impaler) or Kazikli Voyvoda (Impaler Prince). The Impaler Prince, as most know him, by the name of Vlad »öepe»ô (impaler in Romanian).\n\nDuring his short third reign, having converted to Catholicism, his name in Latin was Ladislaus Draghwl√øa. He was the only Catholic Voivode, and perhaps the boyars turned against him for no longer being of the Eastern Orthodox religion.\n\nVlad III's methods of punishment actually followed a nobility rule that often boyars (nobles) were banished. When execution was a must, only decapitation by sword was allowed. It is that which made Vlad III angry at the death of his older brother, as he was buried alive.\n\nAs such, one of many things this Voivode understood was psychological and mental leverage, which in our modern times are unfathomable.\n\nYet Vlad III Dr«éculea and known to the rest of the world, Vlad »öepe»ô was and still a Romanian hero to this day. This must not be overlooked in a country in which the Iron Fist government has been prevalent. His method of battling against far larger forces (30,000 versus the Sultan's 100,000) was to terrify the enemy instead of head-on battle in open fields.\n\nIt is also hypothesized that he suffered from possibly PTSD, so the violence he performed was partly the reaction to other stressors. Though most of the violent acts would have Vlad a front row seat this modern age, to a genocide trial in Nuremberg, Germany. An example of 'coping' is the impaling of mice and birds, serving as a way to feel in more control when being contained by King Matthias Corvinus or just Matthias I for short. This detail is up for debate as Vlad did not live 12 years in a dungeon cell. That was not how a person of noble birth was treated and is but German propaganda with leaflets, created by the newly made printing machine.\n\nThe lavish jailed prince resided for about twelve years was most likely Visegr√°d, King Matthias's countryside residence, on the bend of the Danube river and not Hunedoara Castle. It is most likely why Vlad III Draculea lived to be approximately forty-four years of age.\n\nAn example of a cruel execution is the execution of Michael Szilagyi, who was a Hungarian General. In 1460, Ottoman Turks executed the general by the method of sawing. I add no further details on this agonizing method of being put to death.\n\nAs for my own 'young' country, the treatment of Indigenous Tribes is a gory and cruel past that still lingers heavily. The well attempted genocide of a race that lived first in America is deeply documented in history. Yet U.S. army heroes are still considered heroes, though known for barbaric acts to the tribal nations.\n\nShould they not follow under a front seat at the trial, too?\n\nIs there a difference between taking land from others to expand a nation or trying to keep the land and the nation you live in?\n\n\"He without sin cast the first stone...\" I can not comment truly and judge Vlad III Dr«éculea on his way of ruling. I only truly know it was another time period, and we have the luxury to sit back and leave commentary.\n\nNow, back to the main character, Sabine is preferring both male and female lovers to be. The story is a complex, at times, mature love-hate relationship. The concept of polyamorous relationships is involved, as is society, in which mistresses and concubines could have male heirs and still be able to ascend the throne of Wallachia. This, of course, doesn't constitute a healthy relationship, as we understand it today, in society."
