        "text": "I dig Dracula lore. From Bram Stoker’s epic tale to cinematic depictions in Blade, Underworld and TrueBlood, I’m simply a huge fan (I am, however, less interested in Twilight and Vampire Diaries). More importantly, I enjoy a good Gothic story, particularly one steeped in dark cultural and historical accounts. To speak truthfully, I have a yen for narratives that tie-in with the history of Vlad the Impaler. “Who was Vlad the Impaler?” I’m so glad you asked. He’s this guy:\n\nI first encountered Vlad Tepes in the book The Historian, by Elizabeth Kostova (2005). The novel fell into my hands fortuitously at an airport while I was on vacation, and I tore through it in 2 days. The book connected the dots between a terrifying historical figure and the mysterious vampire lore I knew and loved; the novel also brought to life new and exciting places in Romania I never knew existed.\n\nIn short, the name “Dracula” came as a result of Vlad III’s patronymic name “Dracul,” meaning “Dragon.” In 1431 Vlad II was inducted into the Order of the Dragon, a fraternal order of knights founded by King Sigismund of Hungary to protect Christianity in eastern Europe. It was from this Order that Vlad II came to be known as Vlad Dracul. The word “Dracula” is the diminutive form meaning “Son of the Dragon” or “Dragon-born,” which is how Vlad III came to be known as Vlad Dracula. He received the nickname Vlad Tepes posthumously as a result of his preferred method of torturing his enemies by impalement.\n\nRomanian history, especially that of the time of Vlad Tepes, is quite gory to say the least. Born in Sighisoara in 1431, Vlad III lived during a precarious period where at different times he was either supported by the Turks or by the Hungarians in their stand off in eastern Europe. During his youth, Vlad was held hostage in Turkey in an agreement between his father and the Sultan, and then following the assassination of his father and older brother in Wallachia, the Turks supported Vlad to retake the throne in Wallachia only to be driven out two months later by the ruling Hungarians. As alliances and politics shifted in the region, the Hungarians sought out Vlad to help him retake the throne in Transylvania, and eventually invaded and governed Wallachia as well, establishing his capital and court in Targoviste. It was in this last period that Vlad instituted the remarkably harsh policies and gruesome punishments by impaling, a tactic he used frequently against the invading Turks. He also built his castle, Poienari, just north of the Arges river near the town of Arefu.\n\nIt’s a fascinating history to say the least. After I spent a brief stint in Hungary in 2009, I met various people who told me how beautiful Romania was. Upon further investigation dissecting maps and learning more about the history of Vlad Tepes and Romania, I plotted a viable 6 day itinerary. It was an easy sell to Manfriend: unbeknownst to me, he has a fascination with eastern Europe and a road trip around Romania sounded like an adventure.\n\nThus the trip was planned. We flew into Bucharest on May 18, 2012.\n\nDay 1 – Bucharest\n\nWe arrived in Bucharest in the late morning. We rented a car at the airport along with a GPS and drove into town, which was an easy drive. We stayed that night at the Athenee Palace Hilton Bucharest, located along the street Calea Victoriei at the park Ateneului. The hotel was okay. It’s an old establishment, and definitely caters to the business set, but it was comfortable and clean, and was located within walking distance of one of the rivers and some of the hustle and bustle of the old town of Bucharest, which made site-seeing convenient. After a post-travel nap, we decided to take a stroll around Bucharest, walking along the Calea Victoriei. It was a nice walk because there are several museums along this street between our hotel and the old city, which made it more pleasant. We walked south toward one of the city rivers, and roamed the neighborhood and pedestrian streets like the one below, popping into Byzantine churches and enjoying the afternoon. I’ll say Bucharest is not a beautiful city to say the least, but it has its moments.\n\nWe walked along the river on the Splaiul Independentei street and of course could not miss a photo opp in front of the cheesy and famous Dracula Club (no, we did not go inside…but only because it was closed; don’t judge me). We found a footbridge and crossed the river to the south side and made our way over to see the absolutely enormous Parliament building. According to several sources, the Palace of the Romanian Parliament is the largest administrative building for civilian use in the world. It is also the world’s heaviest building, and the most expensive administrative building. These distinctions exist, and this building owns them all. And based on personal experience, let me just say that it is simply massive.\n\nAfter seeing the Parliament building, we walked back to the area around the Calea Victoriei and the old city area to have dinner at the restaurant Caru’ cu Bere, a famous and traditional restaurant (albeit, quite touristy) with absolutely beautiful wooden-paneled interior and lovely exterior architecture. Just up the street is a lovely little church called Stavropoleos Monastery that I recommend entering as it’s beautifully decorated and so tiny and charming. Caru’ cu Bere is worth visiting for the ambiance as well as the architecture. The establishment offers lively folkloric music and the servers perform a dance routine throughout the restaurant at various points during the evening. Yes, it’s cheesy, but it’s friendly. We quite enjoyed our first evening in Romania.\n\nTourist Tip: There were several museums along the Calea Vitoriei near our hotel and the old town. We opted not to visit these and we didn’t really spend much time in Bucharest, but I if we had more time in the capital I would have been interested to duck inside and learn a little more about Roma history in particular.\n\nTravel Tip: Before visiting Romania, I highly recommend you do some research on Romanian food. We spent the first few days just guessing, pointing at items on the menu or specialties that our waiters recommended, and we found all the food was insanely rich, and we couldn’t manage more than two bites a dish. By the fourth day we finally figured out where the simple grilled food was located on the menu. These would be the options that are cooked and served in a light wine sauce or anything other than the usual (and typical) thick crazy creamy sauce.\n\nSafety Tip: Overall, we felt quite safe in Romania. The one caveat was the number of stray dogs, which made us (particularly Manfriend) very uneasy. The number of stray dogs in Bucharest, and really everywhere we visited in Romania, is staggering. Do some research and you’ll this is a chronic issue that the country is trying to address. I would advise caution in the cities, especially Bucharest since there are so many strays there.\n\nNote on Bucharest: Bucharest has always wanted to be known as “The Little Paris,” though I’ll say it certainly falls short. There are wide boulevards in the center of the city like the one below that leads to the Parliament building. While it looks quite nice as you drive along it, upon closer inspection one can easily see that the buildings flanking the boulevard are dilapidated and covered in graffiti. There is an Arc de Triumf located along the E60 highway that goes north to Snagov, however, which makes for a nice drive since the road passes alongside a park and is treelined and surprisingly scenic.\n\nDay 2 – Entering Transylvania\n\nWe woke up early on our second day and ate a quick breakfast in our hotel. It was important on our second day to cover a lot of ground between northern Wallachia and sourthern Transylvania, which included visiting several key sights such as the Snagov Monastery on Snagov lake, Peles castle in Sinaia, Bran Castle, Rasnov, and finally Brasov. We drove north from Bucharest along E60 toward Snagov Monastery. The monastery is located about 40 minutes north of Bucharest along the north-eastern side of Snagov lake. Follow the GPS carefully to get there. The monastery is actually located on an island just off of the northern side of the lake that has a connecting bridge. If you go to the south side of the lake, where there’s a big tourist center, you might have to hire a boat to get to the island, and it’s much further away.\n\nWith regards to its importance in the history of Vlad Tepes, it is said that he was buried in the middle of this monastery. As it turns out, our tour of Dracula lore and Vlad Tepes history began (appropriately) with his death.\n\nAfter visiting the monastery, we continued driving north along E60 another hour and twenty minutes and arrived at Sinaia, one of the northernmost towns in the state of Wallachia. A beautiful resort town, Sinaia is also known for the Peles Castle, a Neo-Renaissance castle in the heart of the Carpathian mountains. Built at the end of the 19th century by King Carol I of Romania, the castle incorporates several Saxon elements and hints of Gothic Revival, too. Additionally, the castle houses a wonderful museum and beautiful art objects. To visit the castle you must take a tour. We decided to splurge (which wasn’t much) and take the tour of the full castle, including the ground floor, first and second floors, which I felt were well worth the visit.\n\nAfter visiting the Peles Castle, we continued our drive north into Transylvania. We drove for a scenic hour along highway E60 onto route 73A. With Rasnov on the horizon, we took a short detour south along route 73 to visit Bran Castle, what is thought to be the inspiration for the home of the titular character in Bram Stoker’s Dracula. The current fotress was built during the 14th century, and was an important stronghold in the south of Transylvania over the centuries. It is possible that Vlad passed through this castle at some point during his travels between Wallachia and Transylvania, but otherwise his association with this place in modern memory is entirely imagined. In the early 20th century, the castle became a royal residence until the communist regime took over in 1948. Today it is a private museum and tourist site. The caste is located on top of a hill on a beautifully scenic plain, giving it both a gothic feel walking up to its gates as well as a beautiful view from the towers. At the base of the castle there are several barns and cottages selling local souvenirs as well as food. Because we had a packed itinerary for the day, we didn’t budget in time for lunch, so we ended up having an afternoon snack at the market at the foot of the castle.\n\nWe spent a good hour and a half at Bran Castle, and then drove up 73 to Rasnov just 15 minutes away, to get a closer look at the citadel. We wanted to hit all the birds with one stone in a day, and planned to visit the Rasnov citadel as well.\n\nUnfortunately we took a wrong turn going up the hill to the citadel and ended up deep in the woods. It was a beautifully warm afternoon, and having spent most of the day in a car, we decided to take a walk in the woods thinking we were heading up toward the citadel. Instead, we came upon the Peştera Valea Cetatii, or ‘Cave Valley City’, a cave hidden deep in the gorgeous forest below. We couldn’t resist this unexpected spelunking adventure, and went inside, which I highly recommend. By the time we exited the cave, it was evening. The Rasnov citadel, located only 3 km away, had closed for the day so we weren’t able to go inside. However, the citadel’s advantageous position on the hill still allowed us to admire it from afar.\n\nTravel Tip: I would recommend to a fellow traveler to visit the Rasnov citadel as it’s really an impressive citadel and very well preserved. I’m still a bit disappointed we missed seeing it. I believe the cave is open later, so it might be possible to visit that site later in the evening, should you follow a similar itinerary.\n\nAfter we set out from Rasnov, we drove the last 20 minutes to Brasov. We only spent the night in Brasov, so we really didn’t get much of a chance to see more than the center of town. We stayed at the Hotel Aro Palace, which is the epitome of a very basic, business hotel. It was our least favorite place we stayed on our trip. The advantage of staying at this hotel, however, was that it was located within a five minute walking distance from the Brasov Council Square, which is quite lovely with its colorfully painted buildings and little clock tower. Looking at the photograph below, the mountain behind the square in the distance is called Tampa mountain. There is a cable car that goes to the top of the mountain, where there is a restaurant with a breathtaking panoramic view of the city, the citadel, and the surrounding land. Unfortunately we arrived quite late in the afternoon and were very tired after the long day of driving, so we didn’t enjoy the hill top restaurant. If I were to do it again, I would try to motivate myself to go to the summit!\n\nNext to the Council Square is the famous gothic Black Church, so called because the walls were blackened by a fire that ravaged the church in 1689. It is apparently the largest gothic church between Vienna and Istanbul. Unfortunately, being so late in the evening when were arrived in Brasov, the church was closed and we were unable to go inside. We did, however, walk around the outside and admire the one tower (it was supposed to have two) and the carved statues around the facade.\n\nThe center of Brasov was cute and pleasant to walk around in. We enjoyed an evening stroll and then went to dinner at a restaurant down the street from our hotel called Sergiana. We heard the restaurant was very good (and I’m sure it was) but similar to the night before in Bucharest, we had no idea what items on the menu weren’t bathed in cream sauce, so (again) we made some less than savory choices for our meal. The atmosphere was nice so we enjoyed it all the same.\n\nDay 3 – Around and About Transylvania\n\nWe woke up early the next morning again, and hopped back into the car and drove northwest for an hour to arrive at the town of Fagaras. I was interested in Fagaras because I had heard there was a well-preserved 14th century castle with a moat! The castle was built in 1310 on the site of a wooden fortress from the 12th century. Over the centuries the castle functioned mainly as a royal residence, until it became a military garrison in the 18th century. Today the preserved castle houses a museum, which unfortunately was closed for ongoing restoration at the time of our visit. This was the only castle we saw on our trip that had a moat around the entire structure filled with water. There were several swans as well, which made for some very scenic photos.\n\nFrom Fagaras, we cut through the country side along some winding roads. According to Google Maps we took DJ104D going north of Fagaras to DJ105A turning east toward Rupea. These two roads were small, country roads that were not particularly well-paved, so it made for a slightly uncomfortable drive. Luckily it was a nice day outside, and we passed through several charming villages. Interesting to note, we passed several apiaries along the road, with lodges attached to trucks with dozens of hives, which meant we had to make sure to keep our windows shut tight on the drive lest we get bees in the car! At Rupea, we turned north along the main highway E60 to make our way to Sighisoara (pronounced “Shig-ee-SHAR-ah”). The trip from Fagaras through the back roads to Sighisoara was about two hours in the end. We took a break about half way at Rupea. We saw the Rupea citadel at the top of the hill, and decided to drive up and take a closer look. It was under restoration at the time so we weren’t able to climb around inside, but we did get a peak up close.\n\nWe arrived at Sighisoara around lunch time, so we walked around the old part of the city and saw the central square and church, as well as the house where Vlad Tepes was born. There is a plaque outside the house indicating that this was the birthplace of Vlad Dracul, which today is a restaurant. The place was packed with tourists, so instead we found a nice pizza place on a terrace nearby over looking the city. It was a lovely town, and we had terrific weather that day.\n\nAfter lunch, we continued our circuit around Transylvania and we drove on to Biertan to see the famous fortified church, only half an hour west of Sighisoara. Transylvania has a number of Saxon villages, many of which we drove through before lunch. Biertan is one of the most well-known of these villages. The origin of Saxon villages in Transylvania dates back to the 12th century, when the Hungarian kings sent Germans to settle and colonize this area of Romania. Over the centuries, this civilization persisted and thrived, and to this day there exist people who identify themselves as Romanian Saxons, and even speak German as a first language. Because of the threat from the Ottomans and the Tartars throughout the centuries, the Saxons built fortresses around the central church in their villages. Biertan is one of the most important of these villages and a wonderful example of the Transylvanian Saxon fortified church.\n\nWe continued west past the city of Medias, and looped down and around making our way to Sibiu. As we passed the town Slimnic, we decided to stop and take a look at the ruins of its medieval citadel, which is not yet restored. What was exciting was that the ruins weren’t exactly roped off, so we could wander around freely.\n\nAfter our little adventure in Slimnic, we finally arrived in Sibiu. We stayed at the Hotel Villa Astoria right in Piata Mica next to the clock tower. It was a lovely B&B with a homey feel, and very simple. We enjoyed both the location and the charming ambiance. Our room was a little small, so in hindsight we should have sprung for a bigger room, but for two nights it was fine.\n\nTourist Tip: Between Rupea and Sighisoara is the town of Viscry with another famous fortified church. We ended up not taking the detour, although in hindsight I wish we had since it was less than 10 miles away from Rupea. The photos I’ve seen of this church are very impressive and rival Biertan.\n\nDay 4 – Country and Castle\n\nThis was technically our “rest day” after so many days of driving and sight-seeing, but we still decided to take a drive in the countryside to visit a town called Hunedoara. In this old industrial town is a beautiful medieval castle of Hunyad, also called Corvin Castle. Hunedoara is less than a 2 hour drive west from Sibiu, making this an ideal day trip. We took an alternate route getting to the city that passed us through a road with several abandoned and dilapidated industrial buildings that added to the gore and charm of the Transylvanian countryside. The city of Hunedoara is not much of a site, making this incredible castle stand out even more from its surroundings.\n\nIt is thought that the original fortress was first constructed from limestone and pebble stone in the 14th century. Later, in the 15th century, the Hungarian appointed governor Ioan Hunyadi (John Hunyadi) expanded the fortress into a castle. The castle today is large and imposing, with a beautifully Gothic facade, tall defense towers, and interior courtyard, and several decorative embellishments and gargoyles around the towers. It is said that Dracula was held prisoner by John Hunyadi in this castle for 7 years starting in 1462. Some believe this castle inspired the castle in Bram Stoker’s Dracula, although it is unlikely he even knew this castle existed. There is another legend that says the main well in the castle was dug by 12 Turkish prisoners in the 15th century, who were promised their freedom upon completion of the well. This promise was never kept. This place oozes a chilling and haunted feeling. The gloomy, cloudy, rainy weather emphasized this all the more. The best part was, we were the only tourists there, so we had this enormously seductive and ghostly castle all to ourselves to explore.\n\nAs we were leaving Hunedoara to go back to Sibiu, we came upon a cluster of Gypsy Palaces. These were enormous houses, between 3 and 4 stories, that were painted in bright colors with gaudy silver-metallic roofs. I have never seen anything like it. It’s worth stopping by the Gypsy village just to take a look at the excessive structures that feel completely over the top, but are built on very barren and unattractive plots of land with a foreboding stone wall and gate around it.\n\nDay 5 – The Search for Dracula’s Real Castle\n\nWe awoke the next morning, bid farewell to Sibiu and the adorable piatas, and made our way to Poienari, the real Dracula’s castle.\n\nI had wanted to take the Transfagarasan Road to Poienari from Sibiu. This is a road that cuts through the Fagaras mountains, riddled with hairpin turns and stunning vistas. It is a unique road that I was hoping we would drive along and enjoy. Unfortunately, the road is only open in the summer months, so it was closed. I can’t even express my disappointment and frustration, considering that we were there in mid-May. Instead, we took the road south from Sibiu toward Ramnicu Valcea and then turned inward toward the mountains on the road to Curtea de Arges, and turned north toward Poienari, just north of Curtea. At first we over shot the castle, and ended up driving up the Transfagarasan Road to Lake Vidraru, which meant we did actually get to experience the tail end of the famous road. We drove until we hit the closed signs and started encountering workers preparing the road for summer, and made our way back down the mountains in search of Poienari. The funniest part was, we could often see the castle as we drove around it along the Transfagarasan Road, but we couldn’t figure out where the path was at the bottom of the mountain to go up to the castle.\n\nWe finally found the entrance to the castle, and we were faced with a daunting climb to the top, approximately 1,480 steps through the woods. It was a long climb, but the woods are very scenic, so we enjoyed the adventure to the top.\n\nPoienari Castle was first erected around the beginning of the 13th century by the rulers of Wallachia, and became the main citadel during the 14th century for the Basarab rulers. The fortress changed hands numerous times and eventually was abandoned. During the 15th century, however, Vlad Tepes decided to repair and consolidate the structure to make it one of his main fortresses. Legend has it that around the 1450s, Vlad Tepes hosted a banquet for the boyars–the merchants and feudal lords. At the banquet, he impaled all of the older boyars, and then sent the younger ones up to Poienari to repair and build his fortress there. The fortress is in a wonderfully strategic spot, with a perfect view of the Arges valley. Standing on top of the towers, you can imagine the Turkish army approaching and understand why Vlad chose this spot for his defenses. It is said that when the Turkish army approached, Vlad’s wife threw herself off a tower into the river below, preferring death to imprisonment by the Turks. Vlad escaped through a secret passage north with the help of the local people in the nearby town of Arefu. It is said that these townsman can trace their lineage back to the time of Vlad III; supposedly their ancestors helped Vlad Tepes flee the Turks.\n\nI will say the walk back down to the car was much easier than the hike up (obviously). We ran into three other people on the ruins that day: a family of Americans who were making their way up the mountain as we came down. Otherwise we saw no one else except the ticket agent, a local Arefu man who opens and closes the gates to the fortress.\n\nOur hotel that night was in Curtea de Arges, just 15 kilometers south (we had passed through it earlier as we made our way to Poienari). It was a delightful little village. We stopped by the Curtea de Arges Monastery on our way to the hotel to see the beautifully ornamented building. We came back the following morning to view it on the inside as well.\n\nOur hotel was Casa Domneasca, a lovely and charming B&B not far from the monastery. We had a beautiful little balcony attached to our room where we watched the sunset at the end of the evening. We had dinner on the porch, and finally figured out the dishes that weren’t so creamy and rich! We had a lovely view of the mountains and really enjoyed the fresh mountain air.\n\nTravel Tip: I want to make sure I drive this point home since I was so disappointed to miss the opportunity: plan your trip during early June so that you can make sure to drive along the Transfagarasan Road! I’ve seen photos of some of the hairpin turns and it’s crazy. The drive is much longer than alternate routes, but it looks very scenic and you really get to see the mountains.\n\nDay 6 – The Heyday of Vlad and the End of Ceausescu\n\nThe next morning we made our way to Targoviste, where Vlad Tepes held court during his rule and where he also allegedly impaled several of his own boyars, as well as thousands of Turks who attacked his lands. The drive to get from Curtea de Arges to Targoviste should have only taken about an hour and a half. However, our GPS kept throwing us on a road that couldn’t cross a certain river or body of water, so we ended up having to make a fairly long detour almost back to Bucharest. Regardless, we made it to Targoviste and roamed the ruins and the lovely park next to the ruins of the court.\n\nThe main attractions of Targoviste include The Princely Court, a large area that was once the residence of the Wallachian princes. This area contains the ruins of the main castle dating from the 15th-17th century, as well as two well-preserved churches, one from the 15th century and the other from the 16th century. Also included are numerous medieval fortifications. Another important structure is the Chindiei Tower, located by the princely court, this tower was part of the fortifications that Vlad Tepes built in the 15th century and is one of the most notable landmarks in Targoviste.\n\nThe park next to the Princely Court features busts of all the Wallachian princes, including Vlad Tepes and his father. It made for a nice stroll after touring of the site.\n\nAs we finished our tour of Vlad Tepes’s history and life at the place where he most exercised his power, we transitioned our trip over to another brutal ruler, Nicolae Ceausescu. An important aspect of Targoviste is that in a former military headquarters, just a stone’s throw away from the princely court, Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu were arrested, tried and executed. After discovering that Targoviste was the site of this execution, Manfriend wanted to visit the Bucharest Ghencea cemetery to see the grave of the despot. The visit to the cemetery was somewhat anticlimactic and disappointing. We had heard that Nicolae was buried in a regular grave off to the corner of the cemetery, however in recent years his family requested that the body be exhumed and re-buried in a more suitable spot. So we were surprised to find a rather grand tomb dedicated to such a ruler in a fairly visible place at the center of the cemetery. It was disheartening to say the least."
