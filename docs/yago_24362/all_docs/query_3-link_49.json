Dracole wayda, cropping up 1488 on.\n\nThere are two other groups:\n\nThere is the group of icons that do not introduce the subject as Dracula but various historic figures, yet depict a similar man in similar clothing - and are from Dracula´s lifetime:\n\nAnd the group of much later pictures that expressly depict Dracula, match the second group´s looks and allegedly are based on earlier pictures:\n\nNote that the decorative designs on the hat top are present only in the first group. Both second and third group depict the hat top as single colour, black or dark red.\n\nThis is mainly a discussion forum, not a free resource . Perhaps start by contributing by posting a bit about Vlad.\n\nIt's perfectly fine to come here and ask questions (as long as it's not homework, and this doesn't appear to be). While we do object to people who come here and ask superficial questions that could be answered with a simple google search, usually for homework purposes, these do not look like those kinds of questions. The OP is after some quite specific information, and he's welcome to ask them. It's not information that a casual reader of history would necessarily know.\n\nYes ?\n\nI am an unpublished author looking to fill in the blanks in my otherwise completed story.

Does anyone know what her fate was?\n\nAFAIK the woman who received the monastic name Eupraxia hadn't been a legitimate wife of Vlad Dracul and wasn't the same with the wife of Vlad Dracul whose title was \"Cneajna\" and who was either the daughter or the sister of Iliaș of Moldavia (some think that the latter's name was Anastasia while others think that her name was Vasilisa Maria), the nun Eupraxia had only been his mistress.\n\nQuestion # 2:\n\nWhere in Wallachia and in which castle did Vlad Dracula seek refuge in after he was released by the Sultan in 1447/1448?\n\nAFAIK Vlad the Impaler didn't return to Wallachia until 1456, when he became ruler again.\n\nQuestion # 3:\n\nI have come across a website claiming that Vlad Dracula's diadem is patterned after astology/occult symbols.\n\nDo you believe that to be true?\n\nI doubt it.\n\nAFAIK the woman who received the monastic name \"Eupraxia\" was never a legitimate wife of Vlad Dracul and not the same with the wife of Vlad Dracul whose title was \"Cneajna\" and who was either the daughter or the sister of Iliaș of Moldavia (some think that her name was \"Anastasia\" while others think that her name was \"Vasilisa Maria\"), the nun Eupraxia had only been his mistress\n\nA couple of genealogical sites say Vasilisa was the daughter of Alexandru cel Bun and Anna Yurievna Gediminids Koryats, Princess of Podolia, and sister of Iliaş.\n\nAs You've mentioned, \"Chiajna\" is a title originally, not a name, roughly équivalent of \"princess\" (coming from the féminin of the Slavic \"Kniaz\" => \"kniagina\").\n\nAFAIK Vlad the Impaler didn't return to Wallachia until 1456, when he became ruler again.\n\nIf my memory doesn't fail me, he was in Transylvania, possibly in Bathory's entourage/court. I've heard hypothesis that he would had been in command of some Hungarian/Transylvanian units in battles against Ottomans.\n\nA couple of genealogical sites say Vasilisa was the daughter of Alexandru cel Bun and Anna Yurievna Gediminids Koryats, Princess of Podolia, and sister of Iliaş.\n\nAs You've mentioned, \"Chiajna\" is a title originally, not a name, roughly équivalent of \"princess\" (coming from the féminin of the Slavic \"Kniaz\" => \"kniagina\").\n\nYes, \"Cneajna\" is the feminine of \"Knyaz\". There are very few and interpretable sources concerning her, for some she was the daughter of Iliaș and sister of Roman II (according to Jan Długosz) while for others she was the sister of Iliaș (if she was indeed the mother of Mircea II, Vlad the Impaler and Radu the Handsome, she couldn't have been his daughter), for some her name was Anastasia while for others her name was Vasilisa Maria.\n\nIf my memory doesn't fail me, he was in Transylvania, possibly in Bathory's entourage/court. I've heard hypothesis that he would had been in command of some Hungarian/Transylvanian units in battles against Ottomans.\n\nHe was in Moldavia from 1449 until 1451 and then, from 1451 until 1456, he was in Transylvania.\n\nSure, I can post about Vlad. Judging by what I have read on the internet there seems to be many people who think he was evil. I thought about it, and my response is he was no more evil than the men who killed his father and tortured his brother to death. He was no more evil than the Turks and Arabs who invaded Europe and Africa and took slaves and concubines and made eunuchs and converted young European boys then sent them to fight other Europeans. If anything Vlad was a better person. He was fighting to save his country and his people. And by the way, it's been a long time since I have been in high school. Thanks to all who have offered their assistance. According to my notes Vlad returned home when he was 18 y.o. That would make it approximately 1448.\n\nI've made a brief search in my library, since I remembered to have a text about Dracula [by McNelly & Florescu].\n\nThe authors define Vlad's mother Cneajna a princess, from Musatin dynasty. Now, in the book they say that Eupraxia was a different woman, the lover of Dracula's father.\n\nShe was Caltuna. In fact she obtained the name Eupraxia when she entered a convent [this is what the authors sustain at page 29].\n\nBut I can find only this biographic note about the women of that family. The work is focused on Dracula.\n\nSure, I can post about Vlad. Judging by what I have read on the internet there seems to be many people who think he was evil.

That would make it approximately 1448.\n\nHeard a lot of people say the same about Mao and Stalin. Also this is the first time I found out Arabs invaded Transylvania?\n\nIn the book I've mentioned [\"In Search of Dracula\", 1994. The authors, Raymond T. McNelly and Radu Florescu, were professors c/o the Boston College] McNelly offers a translation of substantially contemporary Russian manuscript about Vlad.\n\nI'm making reference to MS 11/1088, written by monk Efrosin in 1490. In the work it's said that the work had copied from an other manuscript from 1486. The author of the previous one is unknown.\n\nMcNelly made the hypothesis that he was a Russian diplomat c/o the Hungarian court in 1480's: Fedor Kurystin.\n\nDracula was prisoner of the Hungarian and Efrosin adds the detail that the author of the first manuscript also met a son of him.\n\nAn interesting note of the professor at Boston is that the writer was more concerned about Vlad leaving the Orthodoxy than about his cruelties.\n\nHe found disturbing that Dracula accepted the \"darkness\" of the Roman Church.\n\nIn a few words, summarizing the way the author of the manuscript saw Vlad, we read about a \"cruel but just\" autocrat.\n\nThe beginning of the manuscript is remarkable [keep in mind that that author didn't like that Dracula had changed Christian Church].\n\n[McNelly's translation].\n\nThere lived in the Wallachian lands a Christian prince of the Greek faith who was called Dracula in the Wallachian language. which means devil in our language, for he was as cruelly clever as was his name and so was his life.\n\nto AlpinLuke:\n\nYou posted:\n\nI've made a brief search in my library, since I remembered to have a text about Dracula [by McNelly & Florescu].\n\nThe authors define Vlad's mother Cneajna a princess, from Musatin dynasty. Now, in the book they say that Eupraxia was a different woman, the lover of Dracula's father.\n\nShe was Caltuna. In fact she obtained the name Eupraxia when she entered a convent [this is what the authors sustain at page 29].\n\naccording to the notes I copy and pasted:\n\nAccording to scholarly theory, Vlad's wife was \"Cneajna\", [a daughter of Alexander I of Moldavia]. She was called Eupraxia, according to Florescu. Historian Matei Cazacu writes that she was his second wife. He does not identify Vlad's first wife.\n\nYou say Florescu identified Caltuna as Eupraxia, but what I have from the internet according to Florescu, Cneajna was Eupraxia.\n\nI did not record the source. If you are reading it from the book the error is elsewhere."
