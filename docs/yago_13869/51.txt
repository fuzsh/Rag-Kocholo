Pierre Andre Senizergues. I didn’t even know his last name wasn’t “Andre.” After playing third fiddle in the freestyle world in the 80’s he founded Etnies, among other things, and now he’s part of the great Freestyle Conspiracy Theory. The Los Angeles Times has a photo spread of his beach house in Newport Beach, California. Some parts of it are no different than any other rich guy’s nice house, but some aren’t. For instance, it looks like he’s working on acquiring every single bit of skate furniture out there, which was kind of a surprise. I figured maybe he’d be burnt out on that. There’s some interesting details lurking in these pictures. Check it out.
