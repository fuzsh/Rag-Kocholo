        "text": "Accommodating informal networks\n\nThe first emergent theme was that of a certain continuity between the myriad resources and personal strategies used to survive on the street or through housing instability and those developed during time spent at PRISM. Indeed, our analyses suggest that PRISM was not experienced as a categorical rupture from previous routine, allowing instead for a continued investment in some aspects of the informal networks built by each individual. As participants transitioned towards stable housing, their testimonies highlighted the importance of the balance achieved by PRISM between the maintenance of some of these personal patterns and a simplified access to formal resources as participants.\n\nWhen asked about the kinds of resources used prior to entering the PRISM program, it became clear that participants were not thinking only in terms of the “formal offer of services” available in the city. An overwhelming majority of our participants described crafting a custom assemblage out of both formal and informal resources. André (38) used a video game analogy to illustrate how he made decisions about navigating the streets. (All participant names have been changed.)\n\n“It’s like is I was playing Zelda or Link, right? So, I have a frame, you know, I can go click the frame and go for a walk […], I can go to the store, at the store there’s a computer, I’ll go sit in my corner, go to another corner, get down, go get my coffee, because I went—I went to the other store, I didn’t get my coffee there, because I don’t get a refill.” (André, 38 translated from French)\n\nAs such, other than shelters and community-based programs, places to stay for the night or rest during the day could include inexpensive hotels, parks, libraries and university campuses. Almost all participants identified fast-food restaurant as helpful resources, especially when they allowed one to rest for a few hours unbothered or even tolerated taking water or juice:\n\n“It was so helpful, for real, I never drank so much juice in my life! I was there, I would take some juice, no one said anything. […] It might sound stupid, but they would accommodate me, like, I knew a few McDonalds that never kicked me out”. (Frédéric, 26, translated from French.)\n\nSimilarly, while many participants were receiving government financial aid at intake, they could also rely on friends or family, panhandling, returning empty bottles and cans, and sometimes stealing. As such, each participant built his network based on what was useful and clearly available.\n\nWhen talking more specifically about their stay at PRISM, testimonies revealed that many participants preserved aspects of these informal networks. Frédéric (26) and Chi (55), for example, found housing through acquaintances, not through the counsellor on-site. Furthermore, many participants maintained routine habits: “We pick up bottles together, and… Well, yesterday we made five bucks each. Five bucks is five bucks” (Rémi, 65, translated from French). Outings for food or coffee at a fast-food restaurant also remained frequent.\n\nFurthermore, cooperation between clients was present and took different forms including trading objects, running errands in exchange for money, or even the occasional gift:\n\n“[other participant], he’s the one who gave me the shoes… and, euh… I gave him cigarettes often, you know… I had some money and I gave him cigarettes, so he gave me shoes and like… a shirt and everything. So we were kind of like friends.” (Frédéric, 26, translated from French.)\n\nAs such, group life could facilitate the preservation of informal networks. Even more importantly, this communal experience could enable participants to expand these networks through new interpersonal bonds: “I had a negative experience [with another client] but it became positive. And that, I’m proud of that. We understood each other. And now, he’s leaving this morning, and I have a heavy heart.” (Marcel, 64, translated from French.)\n\n“Breaking my isolation, that’s what I had to do. Breaking my isolation and making new friends, and… Since we’re in a group–there are eight of us, right–well, we don’t have a choice but to coexist, you know, we have to talk and everything.” (Stéphane, 47, translated from French.)\n\nParticipants spoke appreciatively of the program’s downtown location, which also facilitated the maintenance of routine habits:\n\n“I met new friends. Uhm… I like the food here, I like the food here, yeah, the food is good. Uhm… it’s downtown, you know, it’s near the metro, it’s easy to get around from here. Yeah, there’s… there’s a lot of good things about it, yeah.” (Marc, 51, original English quote)\n\nFor Rémi, this influenced his decision to stick with the program: “Well, now, I don’t want to leave as much, because I’m eating very well, here I can take the metro, to go to the post office [P.O. box] every day, as it is now I’m going three times a week” (Rémi, 65, translated from French).\n\nAnother participant spoke about expanding his activity network by participating in shelter life on-site: “Sometimes when I got bored, they let me work a little bit–I helped the kitchens one day, helped with inventory–that was fun too” (Christophe, 37, translated from French).\n\nThe flexibility of the PRISM program–and the resulting freedom to maintain existing networks—was contrasted by some participants to previous experience with mental healthcare in a hospital setting:\n\n“It’s not like a prison—I’ve never been to prison—but it’s… it’s isolation. It’s isolation, and… Yeah, that’s it. It’s like anything, you don’t want to feel too isolated because… because we need to have our means of expression, we need to have our freedom of movement, of spirit. But it’s a lot of isolation.” (Frédéric, 26, translated from French.)\n\nA space for recovery\n\nThe second emergent theme was related to what many participants referred to as the “break” offered by PRISM, which enabled them to focus on their recovery. Our results suggest that through the simultaneous removal of some of the pressures of homelessness and the opportunity for flexible mental healthcare, participants were able to take some time for themselves and become engaged and involved in the development of their treatment plan.\n\nSome participants arrived at the PRISM after years of chronic homelessness, others facing urgent housing needs for the first time. In either case, a majority of their resources had been directed towards meeting their basic needs of food and shelter. Frederic (26), who had spent the last few months using his old university locker as his only home base, emphasized how having his basic needs met was positive for him:\n\n“And I didn’t necessarily have to rush because I already kind of had what I wanted. I’m fed, I’m housed. So it’s kind of like I was continuing my life in a way, I don’t have my full-full-full freedom, but… yeah.” (Frédéric, 26, translated from French.)\n\nChi (55) spoke similarly about the importance of having basic needs met:\n\n“Security for my life because I don’t have to live outside. It’s very cold, the weather, and it’s very dangerous. And also here they have very good service, like you have breakfast, you have lunch, you have supper, and here even you have snack time, all kind of thing you need to eat you already have it. And you don’t have to spend your whole money.” (Chi, 55, original English quote.)\n\nMany participants shared a general sense of relief and security upon arriving at PRISM:\n\n“What I experienced a great deal of, what I find interesting is… I think this is an environment that is–for the 8 people who are at the PRISM, at least–it’s a safe environment. Especially with what I had been through when I got out of there [his last apartment].” (Pierre-André, 61, translated from French.)\n\nThe importance of this mental and physical “break” is best exemplified by participants’ views regarding their physical health: while many had noteworthy chronic physical ailments–diabetes, chronic pain, heart conditions, etc.–participants rarely identified these as priorities at intake, and fewer still had had much experience with physical health services. Nonetheless, there was a marked sense of relief concerning one’s physical health during exit interviews. Participants mentioned feeling generally better, attributing this to increase rest, regular meals and regular access to physical healthcare.\n\n“There were things that I didn’t understand about my body. I had some anemia, my iron was low, I had just been operated on a month before coming here. Now, it’s going well, physically it’s going well, and my morale is good.” (Normand, 42, translated from French.)\n\nFor many, the challenges of meeting basic needs while homeless had been heavily compounded by their mental illness. This was illustrated well by Rémi (65) and the voices he was hearing: “Ah well, me, that’s how I’m built. I have a voice talking to me, and I have to follow. If I don’t follow, it’s: Come on, come on, come on, come on!” (Rémi, 65, translated from French). During this “break,” participants who had been facing chronic homelessness described an opportunity to get better psychologically:\n\n“Well, for me, the main, big impact was to have… to be able to go from a state where–indeed, I look at that with some hindsight–I was truly manic, to being okay, you know. That’s what this gave–it was a moment of transition, you know, an important one.” (Pierre-André, 61, translated from French.)\n\nFurthermore, some found the physical and mental respite to be conducive more generally to introspection, about themselves and their future: “But the impact, the impact… is to redefine, to define, what am I living presently, is it coherent for me? And for what I have to come, within society” (Baptiste, 46, translated from French). “It’s peaceful, this environment. We didn’t have the stress of people asking these questions every week. So it was really a moment of introspection for me” (Frédéric, 26, translated from French).\n\nSimilarly, Corey talks about the benefit of this zone of “safety” to delve into difficult issues in his life: “There’s like, many different aspects to it. But it gives you an opportunity to safely face things that are terrifying and know that you’ve got support in a ton of directions, so…” (Corey, 27, original English quote).\n\nFurthermore, without the environmental pressures of survival, participants were granted the space necessary to consider the possibility of entering stable housing, which some had not seen as a viable option for a while: “It [my situation] got a lot better, because for me when I first got here I only thought about taking off, about leaving” (Rémi, 65, translated from French). Baptiste decided to settle into an apartment after more than 10 years of homelessness:\n\n“I was trying to find shortcuts to say… to fight change a little bit. But in the end, it’s going well. I quickly resolved myself to say: “I think this will be the right thing to do,” so, to sign a lease and everything, and then we will see what we see for the future. And, I haven’t had an apartment in a long time, so… And, after years and years, well, you can be sure that the reflex, it’s a reflex of restraint rather than a reflex of openness, so I went towards the reflex of openness, for private, personal possibilities…” (Baptiste, 46, translated from French.)\n\nAndré similarly commented on how this period allowed him to consider permanent housing:\n\n“It gave me the visualization to know if I was ready to go into an apartment or not. To… with my customs, my customs in a little closed room, you know, to have a bed and to see if I was made to live in an apartment or if I was made to live on the street.” (André, 38, translated from French.)\n\nNevertheless, not all participants saw their time at PRISM as a secure respite. Some, particularly those who were younger than the mean, felt out of place in the PRISM setting. For example, Hugo (19) was especially disturbed by the “people who were fighting outside [adjoining shelter] and screaming at each other” (translated from French). He mainly focused his critique on one client with whom he had difficulty getting along: “But, it wasn’t because of the educators–or, the counsellors or whatever–it was more because of an old bastard who got on my nerves” (translated from French). He eventually preferred leaving the site while maintaining meetings with the staff: “I left the shelter [PRISM dorm] because I had trouble sleeping here. And… a few weeks ago I left to live with my mom (Hugo, 19, translated from French). Indeed, the social environment remained a source of discomfort for some participants. Pierre-André, for example, highlighted the difficulty of connecting with people whose symptoms of mental illness were more apparent:\n\n“It’s that some of them are really, they’re… you talk to them and they are in their–we’re all in our story, that’s for sure. But at a certain point, you know…. It’s kind of quickly repetitive, the loop and spiral of what they are saying.” (Pierre-André, 61, translated from French.)\n\nFinally, what had been hailed as a “break” by some was experienced as “boring” by others, especially those with limited shelter experience:\n\n“Yeah, I appreciate the time I was able to take and stuff like that, but like… the other night I was, like, looking at this place and I was like, “Urgh. I just don’t want to go.” It’s fu…–it’s boring. It’s really boring. Like, the pillow is like a little sliver thing and you know, you’re in there with 8 guys and stuff like that… You really could go crazy. Then, at the same time… I am ambivalent, I guess, is a good word.” (Peter, 29, group 1, original English quote.)\n\nMultimodal approach at the PRISM (compared to unimodal approach in the hospital)\n\nThe third emergent theme relates to the wide array of expertise found at PRISM, where participants were able to address a variety of issues in their lives; not only concerning their medication and housing, but also the general quality of their mental health and everyday lives. This multimodal aspect of PRISM was compared by some participants to their experience within the hospital system, where the scope of action may be limited to treating symptoms of mental illness.\n\nParticipants were overwhelmingly ambivalent about their past experiences with mental health services, be it with inpatient or outpatient care. For example, a recurring sentiment was that of ultimately having benefitted from a psychiatric stay, while highlighting the inhospitable nature of the experience, and its emphasis on medication: “I don’t know where they came up with the idea of giving these things [medication] to people and putting them in like, a square room, is going to somehow… It just seems so lazy” (Peter, 29, original English quote). “Do you need that kind of medication? […] Or you need some other helpful “beside,” à côté? You always need some à côté” (Chi, 55, original English and French quote).\n\nParticipants described how PRISM differed from previous experiences. Concerning medication changes, some felt appreciative that the on-site psychiatrist listened to and respected their concerns and requests about medication: “Me, I always asked [the doctor] that it be the most, well, as little as possible, you know, as little medication as possible. He respected my requests, and tried to diminish the dose as he could, little by little” (Pierre-André, 61, translated from French). “When I say that I’m not sleeping enough, or sleeping too much, [the doctor] is there to help me dose the medication better. It’s about teamwork, you know (Stéphane, 47, translated from French).\n\nSome commented appreciatively on the talk therapy received through meetings with the psychiatrist, where they felt heard and understood without being judged: “It’s also a question of… listening, and really trying to understand and be empathetic, and trying to understand not just what [the person] says, but also how they feel, because our feelings also show a lot of information, you know” (Frédéric, 26, translated from French).\n\nParticipants appreciated the support received from the psychoeducator and the counsellor, as they were a near-constant presence that they could confide in if they felt the need.\n\n“I didn’t—well, I didn’t feel judged, that’s important, I think. I think they had a good understanding of what was going on—they understood better than me what was going on, I think, and that’s really… that’s kind of what I was looking for by coming here.” (Christophe, 37, translated from French.)\n\nAnother aspect of this multimodal approach is that participants felt that they were not just passive recipients of care, instead being actively involved in their recovery. The program had a flexible structure allowing for such freedoms, while demanding more responsibility from clients than most psychiatric hospital stays: “The difference is that over there I was closely monitored, so for example for healthcare, the nurses or doctors came to me. […] Here, I have to go towards [them]” (Daniel, 20, translated from French).\n\nParticipants expressed a similar appreciation of PRISM’s patient-centred social services as they did its mental health services. As participants arrived at the PRISM with a variety of different needs and experiences, the program’s flexible structure enabled staff to respond uniquely to specific needs including applying for social assistance, obtaining identification, registering for an employment program, preparing to start a new job, applying for citizenship, dealing with legal situations, paying debts, dealing with substance abuse, etc. Participants contrasted this with their previous experiences looking for help: “When you ask for something, the response, it comes quickly, and… it’s done. Really no problem” (Pierre-André, 61, translated from French). “Often, every time I had a problem or that something was tough, well, often there was someone to help me with that, to… undo the knots, kind of. You know, it was something I couldn’t do on my own” (Christophe, 37, translated from French). “Yeah, it was good to have, just, I don’t know, just a break. A break from having to do everything on my own, you know?” (Peter, 29, original English quote).\n\nAs such, participants were empowered to make choices concerning their recovery, as they knew they would have the support to face administrative hurdles that had previously stood in their way: “The entire team is there if there is a problem […] Me, I’m the quarterback!” (Stéphane, 47, translated from French)."
