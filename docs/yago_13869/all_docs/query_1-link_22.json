        "text": "Summary: Heather Summerhayes was six when her four-year-old sister Pam was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis and given only months to live. \"Sixtyfive roses\" was the way Pam pronounced the name of the disease that forever altered the lives of her siblings and parents, who in turn helped alter the community's response to the disease by founding the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. With the help of the CF Foundation, research, and new treatments, the fight to save Pam's life lasted for years, until her death at the age of twenty-six.\n\nThis beautifully written memoir offers a compassionate yet unflinching eyewitness account of the hope, pain, and courage of a family in crisis as it falls apart and puts itself together again and again, to emerge stronger and more loving. The heart of the story explores the relationship between the two sisters -- one devastatingly ill, the other healthy but burdened with guilt -- as they journey through childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. -- book jacket\n\nWhen Heather Summerhayes Cariou author of SIXTYFIVE ROSES asked me if I'd like to read her book, I was extremely flattered. Even though I have never had to face a loved one with a life-threatening illness, I still thought I could learn a great deal from a book like this. When I started reading this book last night, I thought it might not be an easy read. But within a few pages, I knew I just had to keep reading about Heather and Pam. This was an amazing story about two very strong women.\n\nAny person who has ever had to deal with the sickness or loss of a loved one would find this book extremely valuable and definitely should read it. While I have never faced anything even close to what the Summerhayes did, I still learned so much about the beauty of the human spirit from their story. I was blown away by how much this family had to deal with, yet their love for each other remained so strong. Despite all of the challenges that they faced, they never gave up -- they just kept on going.\n\nWhat I especially liked about the book was the author's honesty in telling her story. She freely admitted the difficulties the family had in coping with this horrific disease. She also openly discussed her resentment and anger towards her sister and her parents. I loved seeing how much Ms. Summerhayes Cariou changed by the time she set out to write this book. I was so happy to learn, that even though she misses her sister, she has found happiness and contentment in her life.\n\nWhile all of the people in the Summerhayes family were special in their own right, Pam was just an incredible person. Even though she only lived for 26 years, the wisdom and insight she acquired in that time were so valuable. Her faith in God and others, despite knowing that she was going to die, are truly an inspiration to me. There were so many wonderful things that Pam said through the pages of this book, but one of my favorites is:\n\n\"While we are here we must make the best of what we have and where we are. Soon my purpose will end, and I will leave the world bodily, but whatever I have given to anyone, that will remain.\"\n\nMs. Summerhayes Cariou has written a beautiful tribute to the memory of her sister and their friendship. While parts of this book were truly funny, I found myself crying on more than one occasion. This is such a bittersweet story about the strength of a dying woman and the sister who thought she wanted to die with her. I know this book will resonate with me for a very, very long time.\n\nIf you are considering reading SIXTYFIVE ROSES for your book club, the author is available for speaker-phone book club appearances and in-person appearances if you live near New York (or occasionally LA.) She also has a monthly contest where book clubs have the chance to win a set of SIXTYFIVE ROSES for all group members. Click here for more information.\n\n\"If we take the chance and opportunity of seeking out the beauty in the world about us, every moment of every day can be treasured. I have learned that no matter what misfortunes or joys one may be faced with -- life will surely go on...with love.\" - Pam Summerhayes\n\nSummary: An arresting portrait of the struggles that women faced for control of their own bodies, The Birth House is the story of Dora Rare—the first daughter in five generations of Rares.\n\nAs apprentice to the outspoken Acadian midwife Miss Babineau, Dora learns to assist the women of an isolated Nova Scotian village through infertility, difficult labors, breech births, unwanted pregnancies, and unfulfilling sex lives. During the turbulent World War I era, uncertainty and upheaval accompany the arrival of a brash new medical doctor and his promises of progress and fast, painless childbirth. In a clash between tradition and science, Dora finds herself fighting to protect the rights of women as well as the wisdom that has been put into her care. - Harper Collins\n\nI'm not exactly sure where I first learned about THE BIRTH HOUSE by Ami McKay, but I do know that the description of the novel caught my eye. I finally got around to reading it, and I'm really glad that I did. I thought this book was terrific! I read the entire book in less than 24 hours because I couldn't put it down -- I was hooked from the start.\n\nI should probably mention that I have read a few fictional accounts of midwives and enjoyed these books as well. I beginning to think I might just really be interested in the tradition of midwifery. I also enjoyed reading about all of the natural healing that the characters in the book practiced. At the end of the book. there are lists of herbs and cures for common illnesses that I found fascinating.\n\nI absolutely loved Dora and Miss Babineau because they were such strong, smart and brave female characters. They truly felt that they were put on this earth to help and support other women -- they didn't take money or even charge for their services. When the doctor came into their town and tried to make all women deliver their babies in a clinic, these women stood up for a woman's right to give birth how she chooses. I thought these characters, as well as some of Dora's friends, demonstrated how powerful women can be if they come together for a common cause.\n\nMs. McKay wrote this book after she learned that the house she purchased once served as a birthing house. It's obvious that she did a great deal of research on the subject matter of midwifes before she set out to write this book. I also like the time period in which the book takes place (during WWI) because it was such a huge time of change for women. She did an incredible job of incorporating current events such as the war, prohibition, disasters, influenza, and the fight of women to vote into the story.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the book occurs right after Dora attends the delivery of her first baby. She says that giving birth isn't the miracle (that's natural and supposed to happen). Rather she says, \"How a mother comes to love her child, her caring at all for this thing that's made her heavy, lopsided and slow, this thing that made her wish she were dead . . . that's the miracle.\" I found such wisdom about motherhood amazing in the seventeen year old!\n\nThere is a great website devoted to the book with lots of resources. You can read an excerpt of the book, learn more about the author, and even read her blog. In addition, there are some fun things to do like take a test to see if you're hysterical or have your tea leaves read! There is also a sneak preview of Ms. McKay's new book THE VIRGIN CURE.\n\nI think every all woman book club should consider reading THE BIRTH HOUSE in the very near future. There are wonderful discussion questions here to get your club talking (as if you'd need much help with this book.) There are so many issues to discuss in the book such as a woman's right over her own body, natural healing, infertility, motherhood, modern medicine versus traditional medicine, and various kinds of relationships (friendship, parental, romantic love, etc.) I highly recommend reading this book -- I loved it!\n\nSummary: “The day I returned to Templeton steeped in disgrace, the fifty-foot corpse of a monster surfaced in Lake Glimmerglass.”\n\nSo begins The Monsters of Templeton, a novel spanning two centuries: part a contemporary story of a girl’s search for her father, part historical novel, and part ghost story, this spellbinding novel is at its core a tale of how one town holds the secrets of a family.\n\nIn the wake of a wildly disastrous affair with her married archaeology professor, Willie Upton arrives on the doorstep of her ancestral home in Templeton, New York, where her hippie-turned-born-again-Baptist mom, Vi, still lives. Willie expects to be able to hide in the place that has been home to her family for generations, but the monster’s death changes the fabric of the quiet, picture-perfect town her ancestors founded. Even further, Willie learns that the story her mother had always told her about her father has all been a lie: he wasn’t the random man from a free-love commune that Vi had led her to imagine, but someone else entirely. Someone from this very town.\n\nAs Willie puts her archaeological skills to work digging for the truth about her lineage, she discovers that the secrets of her family run deep. Through letters, editorials, and journal entries, the dead rise up to tell their sides of the story as dark mysteries come to light, past and present blur, old stories are finally put to rest, and the shocking truth about more than one monster is revealed. - Hyperion\n\nAs many of you already know, I \"won\" THE MONSTERS OF TEMPLETON by Lauren Groff a few weeks ago from Girls Just Reading. I have been dying to read this book for a few months; and almost as soon as I received it in the mail (I had to finish the book I was already reading), I settled down on the couch and cracked it open. I read the first quarter of the book in one sitting and I couldn't put it down. I don't know what happened after that, but the middle part of the book was very slow for me. I did read the last 125 pages in one sitting and I was definitely caught up in the story, but I have to admit that I didn't quite love the book like I was hoping.\n\nHaving read so many wonderful reviews (especially Entertainment Magazine's and Stephen King's), I was under the impression that this might be the best book that I've read in quite awhile. I did enjoy it, and I'd even say that I really, really liked it. It's just that I think my expectations for the book were so high that I'm having a little bit of a let down. But even saying that, I thought that this book was very interesting and unique. I'm not even sure how to classify this book -- mystery, suspense, thriller, historical fiction, supernatural, etc. I have to admit that I've never read a book quite like this one!\n\nI do think that Ms. Groff's story-telling abilities were incredible and her writing style is definitely something special. It's very hard for me to believe that this is her first novel. I have a huge appreciation of the amount of research she conducted for this book, and I'm in awe of how she organized the entire novel with all of Willie's ancestors. I thought the genealogy charts and actual pictures were such a great touch to this novel. In addition, I thought Ms. Groff did an amazing job of writing in different voices and styles depending on who was telling the story in each chapter.\n\nI'm not sure that I entirely \"figured out\" all of the symbols in the book -- I think that's what might be bothering me. I read in an interview with Ms. Groff (and I'm paraphrasing) that each reader can interpret the book in their own way. I think I understand a lot of the symbols, but I guess I just want to know for sure! I always say that a good book should keep you thinking about it even after you've finished it -- I guess if I use that criteria, THE MONSTERS OF TEMPLETON was definitely a good book for me.\n\nI strongly recommend reading this book with your book club or just talking about it with some friends. There are so many dimesions to this book that make it a great book to share -- here are some discussion questions (either in html or pdf format) to get the conversation started. I have a feeling that this book will be a huge hit with book clubs, especially when it comes out in paperback."
