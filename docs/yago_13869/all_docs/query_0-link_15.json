        "text": "üöÄ In a recent episode of FP&A Today, Daniel Sousa-Lennox Mej√≠a, a data scientist at Microsoft with extensive experience in financial analysis, revealed how Microsoft's finance team, comprising around 5000 professionals, ventured into the world of machine learning for forecasting. The team introduced FINN (Microsoft Finance Time Series Forecasting Framework), a revolutionary AI tool that has taken financial forecasting to new heights. Using machine learning and AI finance tools like FINN, the Microsoft finance team has bid farewell to the days of cumbersome forecasting and Excel spreadsheet gymnastics. The impact has been remarkable. One striking example is the team's ability to predict Azure product revenue (Microsoft's cloud computing platform) with an astounding 99% accuracy! üéØ However, as Daniel Sousa-Lennox wisely points out, AI is not a silver bullet; its effectiveness depends on the quality of data. While not every forecast will reach 99% accuracy, the results are undeniably transformative for a $2 trillion company like Microsoft. FINN itself offers access to over 25 models, supporting forecasts on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis. This has revolutionized the approach to Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A). On average, using FINN, a forecast that previously took a week to complete can now be done in just one to one and a half hours, freeing up valuable time for finance professionals. In this podcast episode Sousa-Lennox sheds light on Microsoft's groundbreaking journey into AI-driven financial forecasting. Remember, innovation is the key to staying ahead, and AI is a game-changer that's redefining the world of finance. You can check out the episode here: https://okt.to/u3pG0Q What are your thoughts on using AI-driven financial forecasting?

How did GitHub respond? By integrating generative AI into its platform. So, what‚Äôs the outcome? According to Microsoft‚Äôs Satya Nadella in the FY24 Q4 earnings report: ‚ÄúGitHub Copilot is by far the most widely adopted AI-powered developer tool. Just over two years since its general availability, more than 77,000 organizations ‚Äì from BBVA, FedEx, and H&M, to Infosys and Paytm ‚Äì have adopted Copilot, up 180% year-over-year. Copilot is driving GitHub growth, and all up, GitHub‚Äôs annual revenue run rate is now $2 billion.‚Äù The takeaway from this is clear: businesses that harness AI, be it generative AI or otherwise, are positioning themselves for success. Those who don‚Äôt adapt risk joining the ranks of Kodak, Blockbuster, and Nokia in fading into obscurity. Embrace the future, or risk getting left behind. #ArtificialIntelligence #GenerativeAI #GitHubCopilot #TechInnovation #BusinessGrowth #FutureOfWork https://lnkd.in/eQDauUxQ\n\nWhat would you do with a ‚Ç¨60 million injection for your business? üí∞ Double the size of your team? üí∞ Accelerate your current plans 5 fold and expand your horizons much much further? üí∞ Build dedicated AI product teams to further innovate and shape the finance function of the future?
