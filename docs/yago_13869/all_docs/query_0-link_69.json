        "text": "[The film begins outside of a house on Cleveland street and we see Ralphie along with his friends Flick and Schwartz and his younger brother Randy.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: Ah, there it is. My house. And good old Cleveland Street. How could I ever forget it? And there I am, with that dumb round face and that stupid stocking cap. But no matter. Christmas was on its way. Lovely, glorious, beautiful Christmas around which the entire kid year revolved. Downtown Hohman was prepared for its yearly bacchanalia of peace on earth and good will to men. Higbees' corner window was traditionally a high-water mark of the pre-Christmas season. First nighters, packed earmuff to earmuff, jostled in wonderment before a golden tinkling display of mechanized, electronic joy. [Ralphie stands by a window and looks at a red ryder section.] Wow, there it is. The holy grail of Christmas gifts. The Red Ryder 200-shot range model air rifle. And there he is. Red Ryder himself. In his hand was the knurled stock of as coolly deadly-looking a piece of weaponry as ever I had laid eyes on. For weeks, I had been scheming to get my mitts on one of these fearsome blue-steel beauties. [Ralphie lays on his bed thinking.] My fevered brain seethed with the effort of trying to come up with the infinitely subtle devices necessary to implant the Red Ryder range model air rifle indelibly into my parents' subconscious.\n\n[From downstairs.] Ralphie! Randy! Down here in two minutes! And I mean two minutes! [They both go to their drawer.]\n\n[Ralphie cuts in front of Randy.] Come on, Ralphie. I got here first!\n\n[Starts hitting and kicking Ralphie.]\n\nCut it out. Tough!\n\nAdult Ralphie: [Ralphie enters his parents bedroom.] My mother, grabbing for her copy of Look magazine. [chuckles] would find herself cleverly trapped into reading a Red Ryder sales pitch. [Puts the magazine for the Red Ryder BB Gun in his mom's magazine and puts it on his dad's bed.]\n\nThey traded Bullfrog. I don't believe it.\n\nWhat's that?\n\nWell, for Christ's sake, the Sox traded Bullfrog... the only player they've got, for Shottenhoffer. \"Four Eyes\" Shottenhoffer, a utility infielder. Got a whole goddamned team of utility infielders.\n\nThat's nice. Ralphie, on the double!\n\n[Walks into the kitchen and hears his parents talking.] Did you hear about this guy who swallowed a yo-yo?\n\nSwallowed a yo-yo?\n\nOn a bet. Some clodhopper down in Griffith, Indiana.\n\nThey write the silliest things in the newspapers.\n\nWhat do you mean, silly? I mean that's real news. That's not like that politics slop. What is the name of the Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?\n\nVictor. His name is Victor.\n\nHow the hell did you know that?\n\nEverybody knows that. That's another one of your silly puzzles?\n\nYeah, it's another one of our silly puzzles. Could be worth $50,000.\n\nWhat kind is it this time?\n\nName the great characters in American literature.\n\nVictor? The Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?\n\nAdult Ralphie: Meanwhile, I struggled for exactly the right BB gun hint. It had to be firm, but subtle.\n\nFlick says he saw some grizzly bears near Pulaski's candy store. [Staring at Ralphie in surprise.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: They looked at me as if I had lobsters crawling out of my ears. I could tell that I was in imminent danger of over-playing my hand. Casually, I switched tactics.\n\nHey, Dad! I'll bet you'll never guess what I got you for Christmas.\n\nA new furnace.\n\n[Laughs] That's a good one, Dad. [Randy laughs,]\n\nAdult Ralphie: My old man was one of the most feared furnace-fighters. in northern Indiana.\n\nHurry up, you're going to be late for school.\n\nYeah. I'm running late already.\n\nAdult Ralphie: Round one was over. Parents, one. Kids, zip. I could feel the Christmas noose beginning to tighten. Maybe what happened next was inevitable.\n\nRalphie, what would you like for Christmas?\n\nAdult Ralphie: Horrified, I heard myself blurt it out.\n\nRalphie: I want an official Red Ryder carbine action 200-shot range model air rifle. [Realizes he made a mistake] Oooh!\n\nNo. Shoot your eye out.\n\nAdult Ralphie: Oh, no! It was the classic mother-BB gun block. \"You'll shoot your eye out.\" That deadly phrase uttered many times before by hundreds... of mothers was not surmountable... by any means known to kid-dom. But such was my mania, my desire for a Red Ryder carbine... that I immediately began to rebuild the dike.\n\n[Laughs] I was just kidding. Even though Flick is getting one. I'd just like some Tinkertoys.\n\nAdult Ralphie: I couldn't believe my own ears. Tinkertoys? She'd never buy it.\n\nBB guns are dangerous. I don't want anyone shooting his eye out. Randy, will you eat? There are starving people in China. [Randy groans and shoves the cereal in his mouth.]\n\n[Ralphie thinks to himself]\n\nAdult Ralphie: Mothers know nothing about creeping marauders... burrowing through the snow toward the kitchen... where only you, and you alone, stand between your tiny... huddled family and insensate evil.\n\n[Black Bart and his gang enter the yard of the Parker's home, and Ralphie's family yells for help. Ralphie comes in the kitchen, wearing cowboy clothing and carrying a Red Ryder Carbine Action 200 Shot Range Model Air Rifle.]\n\nMother: Save us, Ralphie! I just knew those bad guys would be coming for us in the end! Boo hoo hoo!\n\nRalphie: Don't worry, Dad. As long as I got OI' Blue... What've we got here, folks?\n\nFather: Well, we figure it's Black Bart, Ralphie.\n\nRalphie: Well, I just me and my trusty old Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot range model air rifle. Lucky, I've got a compass in the stock. Well, I think I better have a look here.\n\n[The guys get closer and Ralphie's BB gun appears at the window.]\n\nBart: Oh, no!\n\nAll: It's OI' Blue! Oh, no!\n\n[Ralphie spits.] Cheese it, boys! The jig is up!\n\n[He shoots the first guy. He groans. He shoots the second guy, he groans.]\n\nThere's another one! He's a dead-eye, ain't he?\n\n[He shoots the third guy, and he groans, and Black Bart looks at Ralphie and speaks.]\n\nBart: Okay, Ralphie! You win! This time, but, we'll be back!\n\n[Ralphie spits again.] Adios, Bart. But, if you do come back, you'll be pushing up daisies!\n\n[The guys Ralphie shot, lay on the ground dead each have x marks over their eyes.]\n\n[Like Paladin in Have Gun Will Travel Never Help The Devil] And don't you forget it! [Ralphie spits again and his parents celebrate with joy.]\n\nOld Man: [Happily] Well, son, you saved us!\n\nMom and Old Man: [With excitement] We were goners for sure! And you saved us!\n\nRandy: [Happily] Hallelujah!\n\nOldsmobile!\n\nA pile of junk! That goddamned Olds is froze up again!\n\nAdult Ralphie: Some men are Baptists, others Catholics. My father was an Oldsmobile man.\n\nThat son of a b*tch would freeze up in the middle of summer on the Equator!\n\nLittle pitchers...\n\nHold it! It's a clinker! That blasted, stupid furnace.\n\n[Walks down the stairs and falls the rest of the way down.]\n\nDadgummit!\n\nDamn skates!\n\nFor Christ's sake, open up the damper, will you?\n\nWho the hell turned it all the way down again?\n\nBlasted!\n\nAdult Ralphie: In the heat of battle, my father wove a tapestry of obscenity... that as far as we know is still hanging in space over Lake Michigan. Preparing to go to school was like getting ready... for extended deep-sea diving.\n\nRalphie: Come on, Mom, we're going to be late!\n\nJust wait, Ralph!\n\nAdult Ralphie: My kid brother looked like a tick about to pop.\n\n[Randy starts wailing] What?\n\nWhat is it?\n\nWhat is it?\n\nWhat is it?\n\n[Whining] I can't put my arms down!\n\nWell, put your arms down when you get to school. [Randy wails and continues outside while The Old Man is in the basement and laughs angrily fighting the furance.]\n\n[Ralphie meets up with Flick.] Hey, Flick! Wait up. Wait up!\n\nSo what are you doing?\n\n[Jokingly] What does it look like I'm doing? Picking goobers?\n\n[Schwartz comes outside to walk with Flick and Ralphie.] Hey, listen, smart ass. I asked my old man about sticking... your tongue to metal light poles in winter... and he says it will freeze right to the pole just like I told you.\n\nAw, Baloney! What would your old man know about anything?\n\nHe knows because he once saw a guy stick his tongue... to a railroad track on a bet and the fire department had to come... to get the guy's tongue off the track because he couldn't get it off.\n\n[Randy can't catch up.]\n\nCome on, guys, wait up!\n\nCome on, guys!\n\nCome on, guys, wait up! [Gets knocked down.] Hey, kid!\n\nI can't get up!\n\n[Starts rolling around.] I can't get up! Help! I can't get out! Help me!\n\nCome on, Flick, wait up for me.\n\nI can't get up!\n\nCome on.\n\nGet up. Sit up. Come on.\n\n[Randy whines.] You're okay. Come on, let's go.\n\nCome on, you're all right! [At school, the bell rings.]\n\n[Ralphie, Flick, and Schwartz along with their classmates, are at the teacher's desk, as they get fake hillbilly teeth.] Miss Shields!\n\nAll right, everyone... take your seats, please.\n\n[Writing on the board.] Good morning, class.\n\n[With fake teeth with a funny voice.] Good morning, Miss Shields!\n\n[She holds out her hand and the students give her the fake teeth.]\n\nOpen your books to Page 32.\n\nAnd as you'll remember, Silas Marner...\n\n[Outside, Flick Schwartz, Ralphie, and their classmates stand around a flagpole.] You're full of beans and so's your old man.\n\nSays who?\n\nSays me.\n\nOh, yeah? Yeah! Well, I double-dare you.\n\nAdult Ralphie: The exact exchange and nuance...of phrase in this ritual is very important.\n\nAre you kidding? Stick my tongue to that stupid pole? That's dumb.\n\nThat's 'cause you know it will stick!\n\nYou're full of it.\n\nOh yeah?\n\nYeah!\n\nWell, I double dog-dare you!\n\nAdult Ralphie: Now it was serious. A double dog-dare. What else was left but a \"triple-dare you\"? And finally, the coup de grace of all dares...the sinister triple dog-dare!\n\nI triple dog-dare you! [Flick's smile turns to shock. And Ralphie looks on shocked.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: Schwartz created a slight breach of etiquette...by skipping the triple-dare and going right for the throat.\n\nAll right, all right.\n\n(Hits Flick on the back.) Go on, smart ass, and do it!\n\nI'm going! I'm going!\n\nAdult Ralphie: Flick's spine stiffened, his lips curled in a defiant sneer. There was no going back now. [Sticks his tongue to the pole.]\n\nThis is noth.... [Tries to pull off his tongue but he can't and realizes Schwartz was right.] Stuck? Stuck! [Starts screaming.] Stuck! Stuck! [Continues to scream and his classmates stare in surprise.]\n\nJeez! It really works!\n\nLook at him!\n\n[Ralphie gets ready to walk inside.] Ralphie, come back! Come back! Don't leave me! Come back!\n\nBut the bell rang!\n\nWhat are we going to do?\n\nI don't know! The bell rang! [Ralphie shrugs and he and Schwartz walk into the school. Flick continues saying come back.]\n\nWhere's Flick? Has anyone seen Flick?\n\nAdult Ralphie: Flick? Flick who?\n\nHe was at recess, wasn't he? Ralphie, do you know where Flick is? [Ralphie shrugs.] I said has anyone seen Flick? [Esther Jane raises her hand.] Yes, Esther Jane? [She points to the window. Miss. Shields looks out the window and is shocked.] Oh, my God! [The students except Ralphie and Schwartz watch outside as the fire department enter the school.]\n\nHoly cow, it's the fire department! [Ralphie looks down.] Oh no. [A few seconds later the cops enter.]\n\nWow, it's the cops! [Ralphie puts his head down.] [They finally get Flick off the flagpole. And the students cheer.]\n\n[Miss Shields enters the classroom with Flick who has a bandage over his tongue.] Now, I know that some of you put Flick up to this. But, he has refused to say who. But those who did it know their blame. And I'm sure the guilt you feel... is far worse than any punishment you might receive. Now, don't you feel terrible? Don't you feel remorse for what you have done? That's all I'm going to say about poor Flick.\n\nAdult Ralphie: Adults love to say things like that. But kids know better. We knew darn well it was always better not to get caught.\n\nNow, boys and girls, I'm going to give you an assignment. I want you to write... a theme. [Students groan.] \"What I want for Christmas.\"\n\nAdult Ralphie: Ah ha! The clouds lifted.\n\nAnd I want it handed in tomorrow morning...\n\nAdult Ralphie: I saw a faint gleam of light at the other end of... the black cave of doom. I knew that when Miss Shields read my magnificent, eloquent theme... that she would sympathize with my plight... and everything would work out, somehow.\n\n[After school, a pair of boots is seen behind the fence. Ralphie, Flick, Schwartz, and Randy walk home, and talk about the flagpole incident.] Boy, did you see how it stuck?\n\nRalphie: Did it hurt, Flick?\n\nNo. I never felt a thing. It just caught me off-guard.\n\nYou sure were bawling.\n\nI never bawled!\n\nAw, Baloney.\n\n[They hear laughing, and turn around as Scut Farkus peeks his head out the fence.]\n\nRalphie: Scut Farkus!\n\nAdult Ralphie: Scut Farkus! What a rotten name. We were trapped. There he stood, between us and the alley. Scut Farkus, staring out at us with his yellow eyes. He had yellow eyes! So help me God, yellow eyes. [Scares them and they take off running. And suddenly Grover Dill appears and scares them.] Grover Dill, Farkus' crummy little toady. Mean. Rotten. His lips curled over his green teeth. Randy lay there like a slug. It was his only defense.\n\n[Scut Farkus scares them again this time they escape, and he grabs Schwartz and twists his arm.] [Like Uncle Tex in The Flintstones Baby Barney] Say \"uncle.\"\n\nUncle!\n\nUncle!\n\nUncle!\n\nLouder! [As Flick and Ralphie help Randy up.]\n\nUncle!\n\nUncle!\n\nUncle!\n\nLouder!\n\n[Screaming.] Uncle!\n\nAdult Ralphie: In our world, you were either a bully, a toady or one of the nameless rabble of victims.\n\nAll right. Who's next? [Roars and scares them causing them to run away.]\n\n[The boys are proud and punch each other. And Scut punches Grover Dill hard.] Ow! Man!\n\nAdult Ralphie: In the jungles of kid-dom, the mind switches gears rapidly. Weeks ago I had sent away for my Little Orphan Annie... secret society decoder pen. Oh, skunked again. No matter. Today I had serious work to do.\n\n\"What I want for Christmas.\" \"What I want is a Red Ryder BB gun with a compass in the stock... and this thing which tells time.\" Wow, that's great. \"I think that everybody should have a Red Ryder BB gun. \"They're very good for Christmas. \"I don't think that a football's a very good Christmas present.\"\n\nAdult Ralphie: Oh, rarely had the words poured from my penny pencil... with such feverish fluidity.\n\nFather: I've won! I've won!\n\nAh! The Bumpus hounds. [Hums Charge.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: Our hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses, had at least... 785 smelly hound dogs. And they ignored every other human being on earth. But, my old man.\n\nI won! I won!\n\nWhat?\n\nA major prize!\n\nI won!\n\nHey, look at that. Look at that. A Western Union telegram. Tonight, he's coming tonight. Tonight. Hot damn, tonight!\n\nWhat does this mean here?\n\nIt means it's coming tonight!\n\nI called Ernie McClosky at the freight depot.\n\nHe said the telegram was late, the prize was already there... he was going to send it on tonight.\n\nCome on. Have a chew, fellas, on me. It's my gift.\n\nYou know, maybe it'll be one of those Spanish adobe houses down in Coral...\n\nServes you right, you smelly buggers.\n\nOr it could be a bowling alley.\n\nA guy down in Terre Haute won a bowling alley.\n\nHow are they going to deliver a bowling alley here tonight?\n\nThey could send the deed, for cripesake. I mean...\n\nI didn't expect they were going to send the whole damn bowling alley.\n\nYeah, well. How about eating? I'm starving to death.\n\nGetting rich is hard work, kid. Come on.\n\nAdult Ralphie: Every family has a kid who won't eat. My kid brother had not eaten voluntarily in over three years.\n\nOh, Randy, don't play with your food, eat it!\n\nStarving people would be happy to have that.\n\nCan I have some more red cabbage?\n\nStop playing with your food, or I'll give you something to cry about.\n\nYou better stop fooling around with it and eat it or you'll be sorry.\n\nCan I please have some more?\n\nAdult Ralphie: My mother had not had a hot meal for herself in 15 years.\n\nMeatloaf, double beetloaf. I hate meatloaf.\n\nAll right. I'll get that kid to eat.\n\nWhere's my screwdriver and plumber's helper?\n\nI'll open up his mouth and I'll shove it in.\n\nAdult Ralphie: My mother was more subtle.\n\nHow do the little piggies go? [He snorts]\n\nThat's right. Oink, oink.\n\nNow, show me how the piggies eat. This is your trough.\n\nShow me how the piggies eat.\n\nBe a good boy. Show Mommy how the piggies eat.\n\nOh, my. [They laugh and Ralphie and the old man look on with disgusted expressions.]\n\n[Laughing happily] Mommy's little piggy. [The laughter stops. And suddenly a knock is heard.]\n\nIt's here.\n\nAre you Parker?\n\nAll right, sign here. [He does]\n\n[Anxiously excited] Yeah. Well, what is it?\n\n[Replies] I don't know.\n\nWhat's in it? [The delivery man shrugs like Ginger Grant in President Gilligan, Angel on the Island, and The Sweepstakes from Gilligan's Island.]\n\nHere. Bring it in.\n\nOkay, boys. Haul that on in here. Move your tails.\n\nBring it right on in. Right here. Bring it ahead. Straight ahead.\n\nThat's right.\n\nRight.\n\nHere, bring it right in, fellas. That's it. Here we go.\n\nA little more. Little more.\n\nThat's it.\n\nWatch the lady.\n\nThanks a lot, guys.\n\n[As they leave.] Merry Christmas.\n\nGet the crowbar and a hammer, Ralphie. Go on.\n\n[Mispronouncing] \"Fra-gi-ley.\"\n\nThat must be Italian.\n\n[Correcting him] I think that says \"fragile.\"\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nHere we go.\n\nThey did a job on this, you know?\n\nNo, here, Ralph, hold this.\n\nThere could be anything in there!\n\nJesus!\n\nMaybe they forgot.\n\nIt's in there. It's gotta be in there.\n\nWould you look at that?\n\nWhat?\n\nWould you look at that?\n\nWhat is it?\n\nIt's a leg!\n\nBut what is it?\n\nWell, it's a leg. You know, like in a statue.\n\nStatue?\n\nYeah, statue!\n\nYeah, statue!\n\nRalphie!\n\nAdult Ralphie: My mother was trying to insinuate herself between us and the statue.\n\nHoly smoke, would you...\n\nDo you know what this is? This is a lamp.\n\nAdult Ralphie: It was indeed a lamp.\n\nIsn't that great? What a great lamp!\n\nI don't know.\n\nHere, hold it. Hold it. Here, go on.\n\nAdult Ralphie: The old man's eyes boggled...overcome by art.\n\nI know just the place for it. Right in the middle of our front room window!\n\nJesus, God.\n\nHoney?\n\nNo. It's all right.\n\nLet's see...\n\nThis goes to the radio and this goes to the...\n\nWell, it's just one too many.\n\nWell, let's see.\n\nAdult Ralphie: The snap of a few sparks, a quick whiff of ozone... and the lamp blazed forth in unparalleled glory.\n\nLook at that! Will you look at that?\n\nIsn't that glorious?\n\nIt's indescribably beautiful. It reminds me of the Fourth of July! Turn off all the lights. I wanna see what it looks like from the street.\n\nI'll go get the dining room.\n\nCouldn't we talk this over?\n\nMove it a little bit to the right. A little that way.\n\nJust a little... More to the right.\n\nYeah. More. That's it. No, stop!\n\nRight there. That's wonderful.\n\nParker, what is that?\n\nDon't bother me now Swede. Can't you see I'm busy?\n\nYeah, but what is that?\n\nIt's a major award.\n\nA major award?\n\nShucks, I wouldn't have known that. It looks like a lamp.\n\nIt is a lamp, you nincompoop. But it's a major award. I won it.\n\nDamn, hell, you say you won it?\n\nYeah. Mind power, Swede, mind power.\n\nAdult Ralphie: The entire neighborhood was turned on.\n\nYou should see what it looks like from out here!\n\nAdult Ralphie: It could be seen up and down Cleveland Street. The symbol of the old man's victory.\n\nYeah, he won that. It's a major award.\n\n[To both Ralphie and Randy] Isn't it about time for somebody's favorite radio program?\n\nRalphie: [Happy] yeah!\n\n[Ralphie and Randy sit on the floor and get the radio ready]\n\nAdult Ralphie: Holy smokes, it was 6:45. Only one thing that could've dragged me away... [Ralphie turns the radio on] from the soft glow of electric sex gleaming in the window.\n\n[Ralphie turns up the volume] On the radio: “Who’s the little chatterbox? The one with pretty auburn locks? Who do you see? It’s little orphan Annie!”\n\nAdult Ralphie: [The song is heard from outside] Kids, it's Little Orphan Annie time. Brought to you by rich, chocolaty Ovaltine. I could still taste it.\n\nHey, you turned the light off!\n\n[Ralphie, Flick, Schwartz, and Randy run from Scut and Grover.]\n\nRandy: Come on you guys wait up!\n\n[The students and Ralphie turn in their themes]\n\nAdult Ralphie: I knew I was handing Miss Sheilds a master piece. Maybe Miss Shields, in her ecstasy, would excuse me from theme writing... for the rest of my natural life. [The fantasy begins, Miss. Shields grades her students' themes and gives them Fs.]\n\n\"F!\" You call this a paragraph? Margins! Margins! \"F\"!\n\nMy life's work down the drain. A semicolon, you dolt! A period.\n\n\"F\"! Oh, I should weep if I have to read one more \"F\"!\n\nRalphie Parker. Ha! [Looks at his theme, and clutches it to her chest.]\n\nOh! The theme I've been waiting for all my life. Listen to this sentence. \"A Red Ryder BB gun with a compass in the stock... \"and this thing which tells time.\" Poetry. [Close to tears of joy] Sheer poetry. Ralph, an \"A+.\" [Writes an A+ on his theme.] My Ralph! Oh, Ralphie, you've made me proud. [Starts writing A+ on the board along with Ralphie's name.]\n\n\"A+\"! [Students cheer and lift up Ralphie as Miss Shields continues to write an A+.] Ralph? Ralphie? Ralph! [The students giggle.]\n\nIs there something you want, Ralph?\n\nI'm just turning in my theme.\n\nWell, you can take your seat now. [The students continue to giggle as Ralphie sits down.]\n\nTake your seat. [The giggles continue.]\n\n[The kids run from Scut and Grover and Randy can’t catch up.]\n\nRandy: Come on, you guys. Wait up!\n\n[That evening, after dinner, the family goes to get a tree.] Get in the car. Get in the car.\n\n[Calling to the others] If we don't hurry we're going to miss all the good trees!\n\nAdult Ralphie: My mother was about to make another brilliant maneuver in the legendary battle of the lamp. The epic struggle which followed lives in the folklore of Cleveland Street... to this very day.\n\n[Turns off the lamp.] Don't want to waste electricity.\n\n[Mockingly.] \"Don't want to waste electricity.\"\n\nCome on, Ralphie. Get in the car.\n\nYou folks looking for a tree? We got 300 trees. This is the Christmas tree emporium of the entire Midwest. Now, you ain't gonna find no better tree than this here tree. This here tree is built to last. Ain't no needles coming off this here tree. Okay. Now here's a tree. This here is a tree.\n\nThat's a little skimpy in the front.\n\nWell, you just put it in the corner.\n\nHaven't you got a big tree?\n\nHell, this ain't no tree. Now here's a tree. This here is a tree.\n\nWait'll the dogs see that one.\n\nDon't you think it's a little large?\n\nListen, Christmas only comes once a year. Why not?\n\nHow much?\n\nI'll knock off $2... because I can see you're a man who knows his trees.\n\nThis isn't one of those trees that all the needles falls off, is it?\n\nNo, that's them balsams.\n\nAdult Ralphie: The old man loved bargaining as much as an Arab trader... and he was twice as shrewd.\n\nYou know, Dew Lock just bought one of those brand new... green plastic trees.\n\nDarn thing looks like it was made out of...green pipe cleaners. [They both laugh.]\n\nThis is a very nice tree.\n\nI'll throw in some rope and tie it to your car for you.\n\nYou got a deal.\n\nDeal.\n\nThe Parkers (except The Old Man who drives.): Jingle Bells, Jingle All the Way! Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh hey! Jingle Bells Jingle Bells, Jingle All the Way! Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh! [The three of them blow raspberries and Randy laughs.]\n\nDamn it. Blow out!\n\nNot again.\n\nFour minutes! Time me.\n\nAdult Ralphie: Actually, my old man loved it. He always saw himself in the pits at the Indianapolis Speedway... in the 500. My old man's spare tires were actually only tires... in the academic sense. They were round. They had once been made of rubber.\n\nRalphie, why don't you go help your father?\n\n[Excited] Really? Can I?\n\nYes.\n\nWatch the traffic, there.\n\nOkay.\n\nAdult Ralphie: It was the first time that it had been suggested that... I go help my father with anything.\n\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nRalphie: Mom says I should help.\n\nOkay, sit down here. Squat down. Yeah, that's it. Here. Hold this. No, not that way. Come on, rat trap, hold it like this.\n\nHow?\n\nLike this. I want to put the nuts in it. There we are. There's four of them. And we got it! There it is. That son of a gun. I'm gonna get that dirty... There we go.\n\nAdult Ralphie: Oh! For one brief moment, I saw all the bolts silhouetted against the lights of the traffic. And then they were gone.\n\nRalphie: [Slow motion] Oh, fudge!\n\nAdult Ralphie: [The Old Man is surprised] Only I didn't say \"fudge.\" I said the word. The big one. The queen mother of dirty words. The \"f, dash, dash, dash\" word.\n\nWhat did you say?\n\nThat's what I thought you said.\n\nGet in the car.\n\nGo on.\n\nAdult Ralphie: It was all over. I was dead. What would it be? The guillotine? Hanging? The chair? The rack? The Chinese water torture? Mere child's play compared to what surely awaited me.\n\nEverything go all right?\n\nEight minutes.\n\nDo you know what your son just said?\n\nNo. What?\n\nI'll tell you what he said. Randy! [Whispers the word in her ear.]\n\n[She is shocked and screams.] Ah! Ralphie!\n\n[At home, Ralphie sits on the toilet in the bathroom with soap in his mouth and is disgusted.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: Over the years, I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap. My personal preference is for Lux, but I found Palmolive had a nice piquant, after-dinner flavor. Heady, but with just a touch of mellow smoothness. Lifebuoy, on the other hand...\n\nRalphie: Yuck!\n\nYou ready to tell me?\n\n[Mumbles yes.]\n\nAll right. Where did you hear that word?\n\nAdult Ralphie: Now I had heard that word at least ten times a day from my old man. My father worked in profanity the way... other artists might work in oils or clay. It was his true medium. A master. But I chickened out. And I blurted out the first name that came to mind.\n\nSchwartz!\n\nOh, I see. [Mumbles and yells.]\n\n[Dials Mrs. Schwartz Schwartz's mom.] Hello, Mrs. Schwartz? Yes, I'm fine.\n\n[Ralphie watches her on the phone.] Mrs. Schwartz, do you know what Ralph just said?\n\nNo.\n\nHe said... [Whispers the word into the phone.]\n\n[Surprised.] No! Not that!\n\nYes, that.\n\nDo you know where he heard it?\n\nProbably from his father.\n\nNo! He heard it from your son!\n\n[Screaming hysterically.] What? What? Whaaaattttt! [Walks over to Schwartz and beats him up.]\n\n[As his mom beats him up.] Ah, oh no! What'd I do, Mom?\n\nWhy? I didn't do nothing! [Whines and bawls.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: Another shot of mysterious, inexorable, official justice.\n\n[Takes the soap out of Ralphie's mouth.] Rinse out and go to bed. Oh, am I glad you finished your homework this afternoon! I want you getting right into bed, and I don't want to see any lights on. You are being punished, so no comic book reading! I'll come in, and if any lights are on... And. [Angrily] Don't you give me that look! You're gonna get it! [Sees the soap and puts it into her own mouth.] Ew! [Spits.]\n\n[Ralphie lays in bed with tears on his cheeks silently weeping.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: Three blocks away, Schwartz was getting his. There has never been a kid who didn't believe vaguely but insistently, that he would be stricken blind... before he reached 21. And then they'd be sorry. [Ralphie's bottom lip goes out as the daydream begins.]\n\n[Ralphie goes to the door with the cane and knocks on the door.] Why, it's Ralph!\n\n[Happily] Well, come on in, Ralph. Where've you been?\n\nWhy, he's carrying a cane!\n\nWhat is it, Ralph? What happened?\n\nWhy, he's blind!\n\nBlind? Oh, my God!\n\nRalph, is it something we did?\n\nWhat brought you to this lonely state?\n\nRalph, please tell us no matter how it hurts. What did we do?\n\nLook, I can't.\n\nPlease, Ralph. I must know what we did. What brought you to this?\n\nIt.... It was.... Soap poisoning. [The Old Man and Mom break down and sob.]\n\nOh, how could we do it?\n\nWell, I'll manage to get along, somehow.\n\n[Like The Skipper in Gilligan's Island A Nose by Any Other Name] I'll never forgive myself.\n\nThanks, Mom. [She nods.]\n\n[Still sobbing.] I told you not to use Lifebuoy.\n\nI feel awful! [Ralphie smiles. And does the same in reality.]\n\n[Ralphie Flick Schwartz and Randy run from Scut and Grover.]\n\nRandy: Come on you guys wait up!\n\nThank you, Heather.\n\nMerry Christmas.\n\nMerry Christmas.\n\nThank you, Flick.\n\nMerry Christmas, Miss Shields. [Miss Shields sees a fruit basket.]\n\n[Ralphie enters with a fruit basket. Miss. Shields is surprised.] I just thought that you'd be getting tired of the same old stuff.\n\nAdult Ralphie: Yes, truly, a little bribe never hurts.\n\nWell, thank you very much, Ralph. [He smiles and winks.]\n\nMerry Christmas. [He nods.]\n\nHappy New Year. [He nods again.]\n\nYou can take your seat now, Ralph. [He walks back to his desk and winks at Miss. Shields.]\n\n[The kids run from Scut and Grover. And Ralphie runs to the mailbox.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: The weeks of drinking gallons of Ovaltine, in order to get... the Ovaltine inner seal to send off for my Little Orphan Annie... secret decoder pen, was about to pay off.\n\nI got it. \"Master Ralph Parker.\" My decoder pen! All right!\n\n\"Be it known to all that Ralph Parker is hereby appointed... a member of the Little Orphan Annie secret circle and... is entitled to all the honors and benefits occurring there too.\"\n\nAdult Ralphie: Signed, Little Orphan Annie. Countersigned, Pierre Andre! In ink! Honors and benefits. Already at the age of nine. [Pirates yelling on the radio is heard.] Come on. Let's get on with it. I don't need all that jazz about smugglers and pirates.\n\nListen tomorrow night for the concluding adventure of. The Black Pirate Ship. Now it's time... for Annie's secret message for you members of the secret circle. Remember, kids, only members of... Annie's secret circle can decode Annie's secret message. Remember, Annie is depending on you. Set your pins to B-2. Here is the message. 12. 11. 2...\n\nAdult Ralphie: I am in my first secret meeting.\n\n...25. 14. 11. 18. 16. 23...\n\nAdult Ralphie: Pierre was in great voice tonight. I could tell that tonight's message was really important.\n\n...3. 25. That's a message from Annie herself. Remember, don't tell anyone.\n\nAdult Ralphie: Ninety seconds later I'm in the only room in the house... where a boy of nine can sit in privacy and decode. Ah! \"B.\" I went to the next. \"E.\" The first word is \"be\"! \"S.\" It was coming easier now. \"U.\"\n\n[Randy calls from the outside.] Come on, Ralphie! I gotta go.\n\n[Calling to his mom.] I'll be right down, Ma.\n\n[To himself.] Gee whiz.\n\nAdult Ralphie: \"T. O.\" \"Be sure to.\" Be sure to what? What was Little Orphan Annie trying to say? Be sure to what?\n\n[Shouting from downstairs.] Ralphie! Randy has got to go! Will you please come out?\n\n[Shouting as he gets annoyed.] All right, Ma! I'll be right out!\n\nAdult Ralphie: I was getting closer now. The tension was terrible. What was it? The fate of the planet may hang in the balance.\n\n[Yelling from downstairs.] Ralphie! Randy's gotta go!\n\n[Shouting.] I'll be right out, for crying out loud!\n\nAdult Ralphie: Almost there! My fingers flew. My mind was a steel trap. Every pore vibrated. It was almost clear. Yes!\n\n[Sees the message.] \"Be sure to drink your ovaltine?\" \"Ovaltine?\" A crummy commercial? [Under his breath.] Son of a b***h!\n\n[Ralphie exits the bathroom as Randy enters the bathroom.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: I went out to face the world again. Wiser.\n\n[Lifts the pot and sees the food.] Red cabbage?\n\nI don't know, that's for tomorrow night. You love red cabbage, Ralphie.\n\nYou filthy system!\n\nI hate it!\n\nSchmucker! Smelly watt-buster!\n\nAdult Ralphie: What happened next was a family controversy for years. [Suddenly a loud crash is heard.]\n\nWhat was that? What happened? [Ralphie shrugs.] [Enters the living room and sees.] What happened? What broke?\n\n[Mrs. Parker is holding the broken leg lamp.] I don't know what happened. I was watering my plant and... I broke your lamp. [Walks over to collect the broken lamp.]\n\nDon't you touch that! You were always jealous of this lamp.\n\nJealous of a plastic leg? [Interrupts her.]\n\nJealous! Jealous because I won.\n\nThat's ridiculous! Jealous? Jealous of what? That is... the ugliest lamp I have ever seen in my entire life!\n\nAdult Ralphie: Now it was out.\n\nGet the glue.\n\nWe're out of glue.\n\n[Angrily Grimaces] You used up all the glue on purpose!\n\nAdult Ralphie: The old man stood quivering with fury... stammering as he tried to come up with a real crusher.\n\nAll he got out was: Not a finger! [Exits to find tape.]\n\n[The Old Man tries to fix the leg lamp and it ends up breaking. Mrs. Parker laughs to herself.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: With as much dignity as he could muster...the old man gathered up the sad remains...of his shattered major award. Later that night, alone in the backyard...he buried it next to the garage. Now I could never be sure...but I thought that I heard the sound of taps being played...gently. [Leaves to bury the leg lamp, as \"Taps\" is heard in the background.]\n\n[On the way to school, Ralphie, Flick, and Schwartz walk together and Schwartz tells him what he's getting his dad for Christmas.] Know what I'm getting my old man for Christmas?\n\nNo, What?\n\nA rose that squirts.\n\nPeople come to smell it, it squirts them.\n\nI'm getting my old man a Flit gun.\n\nA Flit gun? [Scut Farkus scares the boys and they scream.]\n\n[Grover Dill enters and stops the friends.] Stop right there!\n\nAdult Ralphie: Ordinarily, if Dill so much as said \"hi\" to you, you felt great... warm inside. But mostly he just hit you in the mouth.\n\n[Ralphie is shocked] Who me?\n\nYeah you! Get over here!\n\nRalphie: I can't now, Grover. I've gotta go see Miss Shields. [He and Schwartz run away.]\n\nHey, come here! Get over here!\n\nCome on, you! Hey, come here!\n\nYou! Come here!\n\nWho, me?\n\nNo, your Aunt Tilly.\n\nYeah, you. Get over here!\n\nAdult Ralphie: I left Flick to certain annihilation. But BB gun mania knows no loyalties.\n\nUncle! Uncle!\n\nAll right, class.\n\nI have your Christmas themes for you.\n\nI'm pleased.\n\nIn general, you did very well. [Flick comes in with a black eye.]\n\nHowever, I was disappointed in the margins.\n\nThis is it. [Opens his journal and sees....]\n\nAdult Ralphie: \"C+\"? No, it can't be.\n\nC+? [Imagines his teacher as The Wicked Witch of the West.]\n\nC+! [Laughs] C+! [Continues cackling.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: Oh, no! [Looks down and sees the note at the bottom and is shocked.] \"You'll shoot your eye out\"?\n\nOh, no!\n\nAdult Ralphie:My mother must have gotten to Miss Shields. There could be no other explanation.\n\n[Sees his mother as the jester. And they both chant.] You'll shoot your eye out! You'll shoot your eye out! [Laughs.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: Was there no end to this conspiracy of irrational prejudice... against Red Ryder and his peacemaker?\n\nThese multiplication questions were most missed in our last math test.\n\nWould you answer in unison, please?\n\nAdult Ralphie: I was surrounded by happier kids who were all going to get... what they wanted for Christmas.\n\n...fifty-six.\n\n[Ralphie walks outside after school, and is suddenly hit by a snowball.] [Scut and Grover laugh.] Hey, four-eyes!\n\nHow'd you like your snowball sandwich? [Continues laughing.]\n\nMaybe you'd like another one! [Scut approaches Ralphie.]\n\nListen, jerk.\n\nWhen I tell you to come, [Ralphie starts quivering.] You better come!\n\n[Mockingly] What? Are you going to cry now?\n\nCome on, cry baby, cry for me. Come on.\n\nCry! [Starts mocking Ralphie's crying.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: Deep in the recesses of my brain... a tiny red-hot little flame began to grow.\n\n[Ralphie has had enough and is getting angry, Scut continues laughing and mocking. Ralphie charges and starts slapping Farkus. Grover Dill is shocked.]\n\nGrover: Hey!\n\nAdult Ralphie: Something had happened. A fuse blew and I had gone out of my skull.\n\nGrover: [Trying to help his friend.] Hey, hey kid! [Ralphie shoves him.] I'm telling my dad!\n\nHey, Ralphie! Alright Ralphie!\n\nBeat him up! Beat him up!\n\n[Randy picks up Ralphie's glasses as Ralphie starts swearing.]\n\n[Listening to Ralphie.] Did you hear what he said?\n\n[Ralphie continues to swear and Schwartz and Flick are surprised]\n\nSchwartz: Holy smokes!\n\n[Ralphie continues swearing and punching Scut as his nose bleed.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: I have since heard of people under extreme duress speaking in strange tongues. I became conscious that a steady torrent of obscenities... And swearing of all kinds was pouring out of me as I screamed.\n\n[Randy brings their mom toward the fight, and she is shocked by what she sees.]\n\nFlick: Ralphie shhh! Your mother!\n\nRalphie! Ralphie! Ralphie! Ralphie! Ralphie! Ralphie Ralphie! Ralphie? [Ralphie sobs.] We're going home. Come on. [Takes Ralphie and Randy home.]\n\n[Scut sits up with a bloody nose and sniffles.]\n\nFlick: Uh oh!\n\n[Scut wipes the blood.]\n\nSchwartz: Let's go, man. Come on.\n\n[Ralphie and mom walk up the stairs into the bathroom.] Calm down. Come on in here, Ralph. Get in there.\n\n[Turning on the water in the sink.] Put your head down in here. Come on, get down in here. [Ralphie puts his head in the sink. And Mrs. Parker puts Ralphie's hat on the back of his neck.] Settle down. [Splashes water on Ralphie's face.]\n\nI want you to go in there and lie down in your room for a while. Ralphie, just settle down. [Removes Ralphie's wet hat.] [Hands a towel to Ralphie.] Here, dry off. All right, calm down. [Finishes drying his face.] All right. Now go lie down. [Ralphie exits the bathroom, and heads to his bedroom. Ralphie enters his bedroom and lays down on his bed.]\n\n[Ralphie sobs.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: The light was getting purple and soft outside. Almost time for my father to come home from work.\n\n[Mrs. Parker walks into the kitchen, and hears sobbing, she goes to the cupboard under the sink and opens the door.] Randy. Hi, what's the matter? What you crying for?\n\nRandy: [Crying] Daddy's going to kill Ralphie!\n\nNo, he's not.\n\nYes, he is, too!\n\nNo, he's not. I promise you Daddy is not going to kill Ralphie. Why don't you come on out of there? [Randy shakes his head no.] No? Would you like some milk? [Randy nods yes.] You would? [Gets up and pours Randy a glass of milk.] [Hands Randy the glass of milk.] Here you go.\n\nAll right?\n\nI'll see you later? Okay. Bye. [She shuts the door as Randy sobs.]\n\n[Ralphie wipes his tears, and thinks he's gonna be in trouble.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: I heard the car roar up the driveway, and a wave of terror broke over me. He'll know what I said, the awful things that I said.\n\nFather: Get out of here! Go on home, you mangy mutts. Get out of here, you rotten, filthy... Hey, Bumpus! Get over here and get your stinking dogs!\n\n[Ralphie looks out the window.] Hey, come on, what's for dinner? I'm starving to death.\n\n[Mrs. Parker opens the door under the sink, and motions for Randy to come out. Ralphie enters the kitchen.]\n\nWell, what happened today? [Sees Ralphie is not wearing his glasses.] Where's your glasses? [Waves her hand.] Did you lose your glasses again?\n\nUh, Ralphie? [Walks over to him.] [Hands his glasses over to him.] Remember, you left these on the radio again. Now try not to do that anymore.\n\n[Ralphie puts his glasses back on.] So what else happened today?\n\nNothing much. Ralphie had a fight.\n\nA fight? What kind of a fight?\n\nYou know how boys are. I gave him a talking to. I see that the Bears are playing Green Bay on Sunday.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nZudock's got tickets. I wish I had.\n\nHe'll freeze his keister off out there.\n\nAdult Ralphie: I slowly began to realize I was not about to be destroyed.\n\nThe Chicago Bears. The terror of the midway.\n\nAdult Ralphie: From then on, things were different between me and my mother.\n\nMore like the Chicago Chipmunks, maybe.\n\nBut Bears, never.\n\nAdult Ralphie: Strange. Even something as monumental as \"The Scut Farkus Affair\"... as it came to be known...was pushed out of my mind as I struggled for a way out... of the impenetrable BB gun web... in which my mother had me trapped.\n\nSanta! Yeah, I'll ask Santa.\n\nAdult Ralphie: Of course! Santa. The big man. The head honcho. The connection. My mother had slipped up this time.\n\nRandy: Mickey! Mickey!\n\nThe store's going to close soon and Santa will be gone.\n\nRalphie, Santa's not going anyplace. Just be still!\n\nMom, this is just the same old dumb parade as last year.\n\nRalphie, will you please calm down.\n\nMom--\n\nHush!\n\nShut up, Ralphie!\n\nThere he is!\n\nSanta!\n\nHave you been a good boy? Have you?\n\nCan we go now? Can we go?\n\nYes, we can go now.\n\nCome on, Ralphie.\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nCome on, Randy, hurry up.\n\nRalphie, look over there.\n\nSee, the line's not so long. Get in it.\n\nTake Randy's hand and hold on to him. We'll see you later, okay?\n\nStay together, you hear? And don't get lost. Come on.\n\nLet's go.\n\nYoung man.\n\nHey, kid.\n\nJust where do you think you're going?\n\nWe're going up to see Santa.\n\nThe line ends here. It begins there.\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nCome on, come up, boys and girls.\n\nHurry up.\n\nCome on.\n\nAdult Ralphie: The line waiting to see Santa stretched all the way back to Terre Haute! And I was at the end of it.\n\nI like Santa.\n\nAdult Ralphie: Let's face it. Most of us were scoffers. Moments before zero hour, it did not pay to take chances.\n\nThe chocolate snowman eats little boys.\n\nMy pretty...\n\nWhat a tasty little boy.\n\nDon't bother me. I'm thinking.\n\nI like The Wizard of Oz.\n\nRalphie: Yeah.\n\nI like the Tin Man.\n\nIf Higbee thinks I'm working one minute past 9:00, he can kiss my foot.\n\nCome on up on Santa's lap.\n\nThere's a wet one. And what's your name, little boy?\n\nBilly.\n\nCome on, Randy.\n\nAnd what do you want for Christmas, Billy? A toy truck?\n\nGet him off my lap.\n\nQuick, get me a towel.\n\nI hate the smell of tapioca.\n\nAttention shoppers! It is now 9:00 and our store is closing.\n\nAdult Ralphie: 9:00! Great Scott! The store is gonna close!\n\nSanta can't wait all night.\n\nCome on up on Santa's lap.\n\nGet moving, kid.\n\nQuit dragging your feet.\n\nGet him out of here.\n\nCome on, kid.\n\nCome on up.\n\nAnd what's your name, little boy?\n\nHey, kid, hurry up, the store's closing!\n\nListen, little boy, we got a lot of people waiting here, so get going!\n\nWhat do you want for Christmas, little boy?\n\nAdult Ralphie: My mind had gone blank. Frantically I tried to remember what it was I wanted. I was blowing it, blowing it.\n\nHow about a nice football?\n\nAdult Ralphie: Football. What's a football? Without conscious will, my voice squeaked out:\n\nFootball.\n\nOkay, get him out of here.\n\nAdult Ralphie: A football! Oh, no. What was I doing? Wake up, stupid, wake up!\n\nRalphie: I want an official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot...range model air rifle.\n\nYou'll shoot your eye out, kid.\n\nMerry Christmas.\n\nI'll see you in Oz, folks.\n\nWell, did you see Santa Claus?\n\nDid you tell him what you wanted for Christmas?\n\nDid he ask you if you'd been a good boy all year?\n\nNo.\n\nDon't worry, he knows.\n\nHe always knows.\n\nMerry Christmas.\n\nOkay, down you go.\n\nBye, Chris.\n\nThat's fine.\n\nNow, wait a minute. All right. Plug her in!\n\nIt is.\n\nFather: Well, the green string is out.\n\nMother: No, the green is on. It's the blue that's out.\n\nFather: Oh, don't tell me what color it is. I'm not color blind.\n\nMother: I'm not color blind, either.\n\nFather: There, see, I told you it was green. Hold it! Don't anybody move! Hold it right there! A fuse is out.\n\nAdult Ralphie: The old man could replace fuses quicker than a jackrabbit on a date. He bought them by the gross.\n\nOh, Ralph.\n\nMy, isn't that pretty?\n\nThat son of a gun.\n\nYeah. No. That star is crooked.\n\nThat star is perfectly straight.\n\nOh, you've got to be careful.\n\nI am.\n\nIt's just... Let me get it fixed. That's all right.\n\nPerfect.\n\nOh, goodness, look at the time. I hope Santa hasn't had to pass up this house...just because some boys weren't in bed when he came by.\n\nI thought I heard Santa's sleigh bells... a little while ago, going up the other side of the street.\n\nAll right, you two, upstairs.\n\nGo on the double, on the double.\n\nOkay, let's get them.\n\nRandy, come on! Get up, Randy!\n\n[Ralphie and Randy walk downstairs and Bing Crosby's music is heard]\n\nAdult Ralphie: Santa Claus had come!\n\nWow! A truck! That's mine! Wow, look over here! That's mine! What's in here? It's hard. Fire truck. Oh boy, that's mine! Hey!\n\nDoes this raise? [The mom and The Old Man walk down the stairs.]\n\nMerry Christmas.\n\nMerry Christmas, you two.\n\nRandy, no. Wait for Christmas to start, honey. [Sits on the couch.]\n\nI want to play Santa!\n\nWell, wait a minute, Randy.\n\nHe played Santa last year, didn't he?\n\nRalphie, you play Santa this time.\n\nCome on, Ralphie.\n\nWho should I start with?\n\nWell, give Randy a present.\n\nAnd, I think I see Aunt Clara's gift to you right over there. She always sends you such wonderful presents.\n\nGive me mine, Ralphie! Come on.\n\nAdult Ralphie: Christmas had come. Officially. We plunged into the cornucopia... quivering with desire and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice.\n\nDidn't I get a tie this year?\n\nA zeppelin!\n\nA can of Simonize.\n\nRalphie, what did Aunt Clara give you? Show everybody.\n\nI don't want to.\n\nRalphie, show everybody what Aunt Clara gave you.\n\nAdult Ralphie: Aunt Clara had for years labored under the delusion that... I was not only perpetually four years old, but also a girl.\n\nShe just always gives you the nicest things, Ralphie.\n\nOh, isn't that sweet?\n\nRalph, go upstairs and try it on you--\n\nI don't want to!\n\nGo upstairs right now and try on that present!\n\nShe went to all that trouble to make it! Now go on.\n\nWhile Ralphie is changing, I'm going to play Santa Claus.\n\n[Walks over to the tree and grabs a present.] Now, let me see what can I find.\n\nOh, I see something! Randy. [Hands him a gift.] This is for you, honey.\n\nAnd this is for Daddy.\n\nHere. [Drops a bowling ball on his lap.]\n\nFrom me to you.\n\n[High pitched voice.] Thanks a lot.\n\n[Normal voice.] I wonder what it could be?\n\nOnly one way to find out, isn't there?\n\nWell, it's a blue ball!\n\nIt's a bowling ball.\n\nThank you, darling.\n\nDo you like it?\n\nYes, very much. Very much.\n\nRalphie.\n\nWe're waiting.\n\nOh, come on, Mom.\n\nRight now! [Reluctantly walks down and shows his costume.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: Immediately my feet began to sweat as those two fluffy little bunnies, with the blue button eyes stared sappily up at me.\n\nCome down here so I can see you better.\n\nAdult Ralphie: I just hoped Flick would never spot them as the word of this humiliation could easily make life Warren G. Harding School a veritable hell.\n\n[Sees it and is delighted.] Isn't that cute?\n\nThat is the most precious thing I've ever seen in my life. [Randy laughs.]\n\n[Under his breath.] Shut up, Randy.\n\nHe looks like a deranged Easter bunny.\n\nHe does not!\n\nHe does, too.\n\nHe looks like a pink nightmare.\n\nAre you happy wearing that? [Shakes his head no.] Do you want to take it off? [Ralphie nods his head.] You tell the kid to take it off.\n\nYou'll only wear it when Aunt Clara visits. Go on and take it off.\n\nTake it off! [Ralphie runs upstairs to take off his bunny pajamas.]\n\n[Ralphie sits with his parents on the couch as Randy sleeps on the floor.] My God, will you look at that mess? Who's going to clean the papers up?\n\nNot me.\n\nRandy did it last year.\n\nWell, he can do it again.\n\nYou know, this wine is not bad. It's not good either, but...\n\n[Hands Ralphie the glass.] You want a sip? Yeah.\n\nNo, you don't.\n\nDid you have a nice Christmas?\n\nYeah, pretty nice.\n\nDid you get everything you wanted?\n\nWell, almost.\n\nAlmost?\n\nWell, that's life.\n\nWell, there's always next Christmas.\n\nThat's funny.\n\nWhat's that over there behind the desk?\n\nWhere?\n\nBehind the desk, against the wall over there.\n\nWhy don't you go check it out?\n\nWhat did we put over there, honey?\n\nSanta Claus probably put it.\n\nAdult Ralphie: Oh, it was beautiful. I could hardly wait to try it out.\n\nDo you know how to load it?\n\nThat's right.\n\nBe careful.\n\nDon't. They run all over.\n\nClose her up. Close it up.\n\nCan I try it out, Ma? Can I?\n\nSure.\n\nOkay.\n\nBut outside.\n\nI still say those things are dangerous.\n\nPut on your galoshes and your coat. It's cold out.\n\nI had one when I was eight years old.\n\nWhat if he hurts himself? [Ralphie runs past them.] Ralphie, your coat!\n\nDon't shoot any animals or birds!\n\nExcept the Bumpuses' dogs!\n\nBe careful, Ralphie!\n\nAdult Ralphie: Now it is well known throughout the Midwest that the old man... is a turkey junkie. A bona fide garley turkicanus freak. A few days before Christmas... his eyes would begin to gleam with a wild and ravenous light.\n\nRalphie: Okay, Black Bart, now you get yours. [Shoots the first bullet, as it ricochets back hits his cheek and knocks off his glasses.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: Oh, my God! I shot my eye out!\n\n[Hears echoes in his head of everyone warning him.]\n\n[From inside the kitchen.] Ralphie, you be careful of there don't shoot your eye out!\n\nAdult Ralphie: She hadn't seen! She didn't know! My eye's all right. The BB must've hit my glasses. My glasses! [Realizes he's not wearing his glasses.] Oh, no! Where are my glasses? Few things brought such swift and terrible retribution... on a kid as a pair of busted glasses!\n\n[The Old Man enters the kitchen to eat the turkey. And Mrs. Parker enters and catches him.]\n\nStop! [The Old Man runs away.]\n\n[Ralphie searches for his glasses and hears a crunching sound.] Oh, no!\n\nAdult Ralphie: Oh, no! Pulverized.\n\nRalphie: [Picks his glasses up.] Oh, no!\n\nAdult Ralphie: For a moment I thought, I'll fake it. They'll never know the lens is gone! Randomly, my mind evolved a spectacular plot. Let's see, an icicle! Falls off the garage and hits me in the eye! It would work. It had to work. Quickly, I whipped up some tears.\n\n[Hears Ralphie crying.] Ralphie?\n\n[Ralphie cries as Mrs. Parker opens the door.]\n\nWhat's the matter, honey? Oh, what happened? [He runs up the stairs to the door.]\n\n[Taking Ralphie's head into her hands as she looks at his injury.] What happened? What is it? Let me see that.\n\n[Sobbing] There was this icicle and it fell off the garage and it hit me.\n\nCome on out of the cold. What is it?\n\n[Hears Ralphie sob.] What? No, it's okay. Just read your funnies. It's all right.\n\n[As Ralphie and Mrs. Parker walk upstairs to the bathroom.] Randy? Wake up, Randy. [Randy is still sleeping on the floor.]\n\nOh, God.\n\n[Ralphie and Mrs. Parker walk into the bathroom.] It hit my cheek and it broke my glasses. [She takes a rag runs it under cold water squeezes the water out of it. And places it over the little bump.] And I tried to get out of the way, but I...\n\n[Lifts up the edge of the washcloth as Ralphie sobs a little.] There. Oh, see, it's just a little bump. Ralphie, You're lucky it didn't cut your eye. Those icicles have been known to kill people.\n\nOld man: [Walks into the kitchen, and hears Ralphie crying.] What's going on up there?\n\nNothing. We'll be right down. You stay away from that turkey! It's got an hour to cook. You'll get worms!\n\nRalphie: [Sadly] But what about my glasses?\n\nWell, you can wear the old ones with the crack in them... until we get you some new ones. Okay?\n\n[Looks at the camera and smiles.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: I had pulled it off!\n\n[Looks back at mom and continues pretending to be sad.] But I left my gun outside.\n\n[Putting the medicine on the washcloth.] When you get dressed you can go out and get your gun. Hold that on there. [Places it back on Ralphie's cheek and smiles.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: Life is like that. Sometimes, at the height of our reveries, when our joy is at its zenith... when all is most right with the world... the most unthinkable disasters descend upon us.\n\n[The dogs are knock over the table and Mrs. Parker and Ralphie hear it.] What?\n\nOh, the turkey! Oh, my God! You are sons of b*tches! Bumpuses! [Mrs. Parker, Ralphie and Randy enter in shock.]\n\n[As Mrs. Parker starts crying.]\n\nAdult Ralphie: The heavenly aroma still hung heavy in the house. But, it was gone. All gone. No turkey, no turkey sandwiches, no turkey salad, no turkey gravy, turkey hash, turkey a la king... or gallons of turkey soup. Gone. All gone.\n\n[Mrs. Parker covers her mouth and sobs. Ralphie hands her the washcloth. As she blows her nose.]\n\nFather: All right. Everybody, upstairs. Get dressed. We are going out to eat.\n\n[The waiters sing Deck the Halls in their Chinese voices.]\n\nNo! Not, \"ra ra ra ra ra.\" \"La la la la la.\" Sing like this: Deck The Halls with boughs of holly fa la la la la la la la la.\n\nTry again. [Singing in their chinese voices.]\n\nStop!\n\nSing something else.\n\n[They decide to sing Jingle Bells in their chinese voices.]\n\nNo!\n\nStop!\n\nKitchen. Bring food. For customers.\n\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\nIt's a beautiful duck.\n\nIt really is.\n\nBut you see...\n\nWhat?\n\nIt's smiling at me.\n\nOkay?\n\nBeautiful!\n\nAdult Ralphie: That Christmas would live in our memories... as the Christmas when we were introduced to Chinese turkey. All was right with the world.\n\nOh, honey, come over here. Look at this.\n\nIs that beautiful! [She sighs with joy, and The Old Man hands her a wine glass, and they put their arms around each other.]"
