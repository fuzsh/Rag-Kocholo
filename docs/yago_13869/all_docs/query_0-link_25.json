        "text": "On November 24, 2019, I accepted an offer for my dream job with a radio station, as a freelance writer and social media manager. This was my first time fully pursuing my dream of being self-employed, so I took a leap of faith and accepted the position, as a side hustle to my main job. I could work from home as well. Everything was going well on the dream job. I felt that the job was secure and it was paying twice the pay as my main job. I continued doing both jobs and on December 20, 2019 I went on vacation from my main job.\n\nFrom December 20th throughout the holiday season, I was on cloud nine, loving my new career. While on vacation from my main job, I had time to really think about what I wanted to do. I decided that I was sick of my regular “9 to 5” and I should pursue my dream full-time. My new dream job was a part of the iHeart Media family.\n\nOn January 6, 2020, when I returned from vacation to my main job, I submitted my letter of resignation, effective immediately. I was fully self-employed. Unfortunately, the next day, my dream job let me go, due to a massive and nationwide iHeart Media lay-off. Last hired, first fired. I didn’t know what I was going to do. Yesterday, I had two jobs and today I have NO job! Fortunately, I was eligible for Unemployment Compensation.\n\nSince I’m home and got free time, I decided that now that I am unemployed and have plenty of free time, this would be the best time to go on a vacation. What better place to go, to lift my spirits, than New Orleans, Mardi Gras, on Fat Tuesday! So that’s what I did…me and my homie. From February 23, 2020 thru Wednesday February 26, 2020 I had a ball. This time included Fat Tuesday, February 25th. I had a great time, but I found that the people and the city were too slow for me. I’m high spirited and swift-minded and I found the city to be too laid back for me. So, I won’t be retuning there.\n\nWhen I returned home, I learned of the Coronavirus and that it was spreading very fast in New Orleans. Luckily, I’d left just in time and didn’t really interact with many people, because I wasn’t feeling the city, as I stated already. All of my loved ones and friends reached out to me to make sure that I wasn’t sick. I wasn’t. Thank God!\n\nOn March 11, 2020 the Novel Coronavirus Disease, COVID-19, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. On March 13, 2020 a national emergency was declared in the United States concerning the COVID-19 Outbreak. The world has been shut down and everyone is locked down in their homes. WTF!!!\n\nNow back at home during this time off, and with me already being a published writer, I wanted to kick it up a notch and start my own online magazine. I have always wanted to do that, but never had the time to invest in starting it. NOW I HAD THE TIME! The world is on lockdown! I pivoted from being an author to being a publisher.\n\nThe purpose of my magazine would be to enlighten my readers with stories, people and events that are making POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WORLD, highlighting known and unknown individuals and events.\n\nSo, on April 1, 2020 I launched the first issue of my magazine, GO BANG! Magazine, (www.GoBangMagazine.com) with NO START UP MONEY and NO publishing EXPERIENCE. Having worked with historic and iconic media outlets such as The Chicago Defender Newspaper, N’Digo Magapaper and the Soul Train brand, I was fully groomed to start my own. All I had was a vision, passion and a dream! I would now be the CEO, Publisher, Senior Editor and Journalist, as well as the Promoter and Publicist.\n\nApril was just one month after COVID-19 was categorized as a pandemic. As I said, the world shut down, so the timing of my magazine couldn’t have been better. Everybody was at home and had nothing to do. Why not read GO BANG! Magazine?\n\nSeptember 2020 marked GO BANG! Magazine’s six-month anniversary. At this point, GO BANG! Magazine had been received overwhelmingly great across the planet, not just here in the United States. GO BANG! Magazine is global and includes readers in United Kingdom, China, Nigeria, Australia, Germany, Spain, France, Japan, Saint Lucia and United Arab Emirates. WOW, WOW & WOW!!!\n\nI’m told that the public loves the in-depth interviews and the people that I select to interview. Many of the interviewees have commented on how they love the way I conduct the interviews, which are via email, the questions asked, and how they are allowed to fully express themselves, with no restrictions.\n\nNovember 2020, I accepted a job with the Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership as a Lead Contact Tracer. I had always wanted to help rid the world of this deadly pandemic, and now I had the chance. This was a work-from-home position, so it wouldn’t interfere with publishing my magazine. My Contact Tracing duties include: leading 16 Contact Tracers in contacting individuals that may have been exposed to COVID-19 thru close contact with a COVID-19 infected individual and provide them with information and guidance to interrupt/reduce the ongoing transmission of the disease by obtaining symptom information, advising them to self-quarantine and to monitor their health, assisting exposed individuals in getting tested, connecting individuals to resources and support during self-quarantine and self-isolation. March 2022, I was promoted to Contact Tracing Supervisor.\n\nMarch 2021, I initiated accepting promotional ads and offering sponsorship packages to individuals and businesses. As of now, ads are my focus. In the near future, as the world opens back up, I will focus on GO BANG! Magazine sponsored events, and therefore my focus will be more on soliciting sponsorship packages.\n\nApril 1, 2022: Celebrating TWO YEARS of publication, GO BANG! Magazine has achieved what many other media outlets haven’t. April 1, 2022 marks the TWO YEAR Anniversary of GO BANG! Magazine! In those two years, GO BANG! Magazine has become the reliable source for in-depth interviews and an internationally global successful medium. The magazine has interviewed hundreds of celebrities and everyday individuals. It proudly boasts, having readers from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, China, Italy, Nigeria, Australia, Germany, Spain, France, Japan, Saint Lucia and several other countries.\n\nIn addition to that, GO BANG! Magazine is now offering reasonably priced monthly AD SPACE and seeking SPONSORSHIP opportunities for businesses and/or individuals interested in sponsoring upcoming events produced by the GO BANG! Magazine brand.\n\nIn addition to the magazine, I have also launched a newsletter which creates a database of my readers and followers. I have sister sites of the magazine on all social media platforms as well. With all of these platforms, it has given me an audience to promote and sell merchandise, as well as fundraise. I have created promotional facemasks, hats and shirts with the GO BANG! Magazine logo on it! The items have been received positively by the public and sales have been great!\n\nI am proud, amazed, thrilled and thankful for the first year of GO BANG! Magazine and I look forward to more years to come.\n\nWhat I have learned during this wonderful journey is that you must be creative, be persistent, trust yourself, have faith, hang in for the long-haul, be flexible and always be willing to learn more about your field of business.\n\nI had a DREAM…\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic gave me TIME…\n\nYOU gave me SUPPORT!\n\nGOD gave me the GIFT to……\n\nGO BANG!…\n\nI DID!\n\nThank you ALL for your past, present and future support!!!!\n\nPhoto & Stylist Credit: Stacy Jordan\n\nThe Corbett Music Group Presents JD Wesley!\n\nJ.D. Wesley was born John Wesley Wilson Jr., an extremely talented young man. At an early age his parents along with the community, noticed that his vocal ability was strong and like none other. From that moment onward, singing and music was the largest component of his life.\n\nOver the years, JD has evolved into a powerhouse performer. From top 40’s bands to off-Broadway productions and so much more. You name it and he’s done it! His networking has generated connections with major and independent labels such as The Corbett Music Group.\n\nHe is also a rising face in TV/Film industry. Making featured appearances in multiple TV shows and films over the last two years. With the recent release of his latest single, he is rapidly becoming known as the smooth vocalist from the “new social justice anthem”, “The Bell Tolls For You”!\n\nWhat’s next for the rising star, only time will tell. However, he has shown no signs of slowing down or stopping anytime soon!\n\nGO BANG! MAGAZINE: Where were you born and raised?\n\nJ.D. Wesley: I was born and reared in the great Palmetto state of South Carolina, specifically the PeeDee area or “the country” as my sisters and I would call it.\n\nGO BANG! MAGAZINE: I understand that your name, John David “JD” Wesley, has a special significance and meaning. Please explain the significance of your name to our readers.\n\nJ.D. Wesley: My full name is John Wesley Wilson Jr., as I was named after my father. My stage name John David Wesley aka J.D. Wesley, is a combination of my grandfather (David Wilson), my dad (John Sr.), and my name. Which represents three generations of my family’s bloodline.\n\nGO BANG! MAGAZINE: You have talent in music and in acting. What are some of the TV/Films that you were in and or groups or songs that our readers may know you from?\n\nJ.D. Wesley: Well, recently I had a feature on the show “Law & Order: Organized Crime” (S2 Ep.11). I didn’t have any lines, but I was the FBI agent that arrested the “most wanted” criminal on the run. Through the years, I have done features on shows like “New Amsterdam”, “POSE”, as well as a few movies that have not been released. I’ve done quite a few commercials for national and international campaigns and my biggest single to date is “Favored” from my project “Favored”, which was released in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic. I’m also a decade long member of the mid 90’s Classic R&B Group SOLO; whom were discovered by music industry giants Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis.\n\nGO BANG! MAGAZINE: How did you get started in the music industry and when did you know that you wanted to pursue it professionally?\n\nJ.D. Wesley: I got started in music many, many, many moons ago as a young child. My father is a pastor and my mother is one of the best singers around, the whole music scene was somewhat of a birthright. I lead my first song in church at the tender age of four and from there everyone saw the gift from God, supported with lots of talent. I continued my journey through the years up to the recording of my very first project at age 16. It was a compilation CD (because that’s how long ago it was) with a community choir I was once a part of and another local singer that had been blessed with the gift of voice. Although the project did not sell millions of copies worldwide, it was another glance into the vocal ability and styling of a great up and coming young artist. It was also the moment I solidified my decision to pursue a career in entertainment, specifically as a singer/artist.\n\nGO BANG! MAGAZINE: What is it about acting that attracted you to it and when did you decide to pursue it professionally?\n\nJ.D. Wesley: Acting has been a large part of my life almost as long as singing and music. My attraction to it as a young boy, was mostly me memorizing scenes and lines from movies like “Coming To America”, “The Color Purple”, “Ace Ventura” and so many others that I enjoyed. However, once I did my first big stage production in high-school, I realized that there was more to it than just memorizing lines and that I truly had a hidden talent for acting. From that point on, I took every opportunity available to sharpen those acting chops and get involved in other theater projects. In 2018, I decided that I should take my acting to the next level and pursue a career in TV/Film.\n\nGO BANG! MAGAZINE: Recently, you teamed up with Tyrone Corbett of The Corbett Music Group and soulfully performed his original song “The Bell Tolls for You.” Many have considered this song to be a new civil-rights anthem for our generation. Please describe to our readers what you thought about the song when you received it, how it felt to record it, and describe the video shoot, as well as how the public has welcomed it.\n\nJ.D. Wesley: When I initially received the song, the singer that sung the reference tracks had done a phenomenal job and I was very curious as to what Tyrone thought I could do better than him. It was a wonder, but I’m always up for a vocal challenge and I decided to at least record it and see where things go. Initially, I was thinking that the song was too big for me. However, after starting the studio session, I slowly began to feel the song in my spirit and in my soul and how much of an impact it could make globally. The timing could not have been more perfect, given the social status in this country and many others around the world.\n\nOnce we completed the recording and moved to the video shoot, I was completely sold on the possibilities of where this song will go. We filmed in multiple locations, including NJ and NYC, and each time a crowd gathered and the onlookers were either interested in what we were doing or emotionally attached to the lyrics of the song. Every single take, I did my best to vocally deliver the song with intensity and the deepest level of soul I had inside of me. I’m so glad I did, as it is being received around the world very positively and has touch so many hearts thus far.\n\nI can only imagine where the song will end up and how many more will be touched by the power of the very relevant lyrics and the strong imagery that the video adds to the message.\n\nGO BANG! MAGAZINE: “The Bell Tolls for You” has been warmly received by the public, especially the video which depicts all of those souls that we have lost during this modern-day struggle, as well as shows your powerful and soulful performance. In a little over two and a half months, the YouTube video has been viewed by nearly 50,000 people. It’s going viral! How has your participation in this song affected your life?\n\nJ.D. Wesley: Being a part of this song has changed my perception of everything and everyone. As a darker pigmented person of color, you are often led to believe that the struggle is all about slavery and what happened to our ancestors. However, the story is far broader than that and it includes a multitude of people with varying skin tones globally. This project has allowed me to look past what I believe to be true and see the actual truth of the matter. Which is there has been a struggle within humanity since the dawn of existence and if we humans cannot find a way to change for the better it will only get worse as we move forward.\n\n“The Bell Tolls for You” is that call to action! As the bell not only tolls for people with darker skin, but that same bell can be heard by every living person on this planet. Whether we are doing right or doing wrong, the bell tolls for us all at some point or another. That is proven by the nearly 50K views of the music video. Each viewer is communicating their attachment to the relevancy of the lyrics and how they view the world and where we currently stand.\n\nRight now, there is an uproar in Europe where the dominance of one nation has become the horror of another nation. There is not a better depiction of the “The Bell Tolls for You”!\n\nGO BANG! MAGAZINE: Recently, a lil GO BANG! bird whispered in my ear that JD Wesley is putting together a VIRTUAL CONCERT. Do tell our readers all about this exciting upcoming event.\n\nJ.D. Wesley: The virtual concert idea came into play simply because I’m noticing that my support base is growing and I now have people that follow me from around the world. Doing a virtual concert will allow me to reach all of them and also invite new followers to link up and join the movement. It will be a very subtle event that allows me to showcase my gifts and talents and all whom are interested to watch and enjoy from the comforts of their homes.\n\nGO BANG! MAGAZINE: There’s also talk going around that you are about to start your OWN company. Tell us about that NEW entrepreneurial venture and how our readers can help.\n\nJ.D. Wesley: I’m not going to say much about my entrepreneurial ventures at this moment, as we are still in the beginning stages and there is lots of work to be done. However, I have worked with so many production companies and businesses in the realm of entertainment and I’ve noticed there is a need for some changes. Often established businesses/companies will not change until a new company comes along doing what they do with a much better and/or more effective methodology. At this point, I’m still soliciting investors and laying the ground work for the soon to come debut.\n\nGO BANG! Magazine: In conclusion, please tell our readers what you are working on and what do you have planned for the future.\n\nJ.D. Wesley: At the moment, I’m still promoting “The Bell Tolls for You” on as many platforms as possible. There are also some new business ventures with other producers that I’m considering as far as radio promotion and marketing. Most importantly, Tyrone Corbett and I may begin working on a follow-up single very soon!\n\nWATCH “The Bell Tolls For You” powerful YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwiShOzKJ-o\n\nUNDERSTAND “The Bell Tolls For You” lyrics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb_2Eegv-P0&t=8s\n\nBUY “The Bell Tolls For You” on ALL music platforms: https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-bell-tolls-for-you/1598058724?i=1598058819&fbclid=IwAR1L2Ue2vNDqEzeBi_Q79FEetT3B8RE7k1wZAwhhgaZDISSAe5yWQw1UaCQ\n\nYou can follow J.D.
