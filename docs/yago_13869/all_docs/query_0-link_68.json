        "text": "I know all the Quattros can run on both frequencies, and I suspect that's true for the Multiplusses as well.\n\nIf you are using them as a charger only, they just adapt to the incoming AC frequency.\n\nIf you are using them as an inverter only, they make whatever frequency you program in.\n\nIf you are using them in pass-through or assist, they pass through the input frequency and match it with additional power from the inverter.\n\nSo, the only real issue with frequency is whether your downstream loads can tolerate it. The Victron gear doesn't care."
