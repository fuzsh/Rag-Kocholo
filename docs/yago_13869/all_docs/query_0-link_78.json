        "text": "�This world is made of love and peace!�\n\n~Vash the Stampede\n\n*Singing* �Total slaughter. Total slaughter. I won't leave a single man alive. Ladidadidi. Genocide. Ladidadivdud. An ocean of blood. Let's begin the killing time.�\n\n~Vash the Stampede\n\n�Everything, everything was so horribly dry, even people�s hearts. From far away, as I watched the people who lived there, I always found myself wondering how and why could they possibly keep on living. What motivation did they have that would get them up every day no matter what for the rest of their lives?�\n\n~Vash the Stampede\n\n�I am known as:\n\nValentinez Alkalinella Zihack Shushiraboheras Gombigovella Blue Stradavari Talentrent Pierre Andre Chartenhamos Varavinci Baldos George Deutzelkaiser III.� Don�t hesitate to call� ~Vash the Stampede\n\n�Ah-ha-ha-ha!� What are you talking about, Mr. Vash the Stampede?�� Millie Thompson\n\n�Waah!� I hate it when you call me by my full name!� ~Vash\n\n�(pardon the spelling; I made it up while listening to the quote 20 times)\n\n�Suicide? I strongly disapprove of suicide.�\n\n~Vash the Stampede\n\n�I am a hunter of peace chasing the mayfly known as love.�\n\n~Vash the Stampede\n\n�Everyone who touches me ends up dying.� ~Vash the Stampede\n\n�That very well may be, but there�s nothing you can do about it at this point. You�ve still got somewhere else you�ve got to go. Don�t you agree?� ~Nicholas D. Wolfwood\n\n�I agree. I�m not done yet. Whatever it takes, I have to face it.� Vash the Stampede\n\n�I can recognize the smell of gunpowder and grease instantly.�\n\n~Vash the Stampede\n\n�Dangerous toys are fun, but you could get hurt.�\n\n~Vash the Stampede\n\n�You�re na�ve.� Had I been so inclined, I could have killed you at least three times by now.� ~Dominique the Cyclops\n\n(A few lines here about spring cleaning and such)\n\n�I should slap you. Not to mention that during this conversation... I could have groped you at least five times!�\n\n~Vash the Stampede\n\n�Women are a marvel, aren�t they?� ~Nicholas D. Wolfwood\n\n�That�s for sure.� ~Vash the Stampede\n\n�Knives, you aren�t even human!� ~Vash\n\n�Damn straight I�m not! How dare you compare me to those imperfect things? How dare you? Never compare me to them. Your nothing but garbage.� I will kill you all. Only we will be left on this planat.� ~Knives\n\n�Well I�ll be. I�m actually surprised that you can smile like that.� ~ Nicholas D. Wolfwood\n\n�Huh? What do you mean?� Vash the Stampede\n\n�You had me kind of worried. I noticed you always smiled, seemed really friendly, but the way you smiled was so empty it hurt to watch you. You�re hurting like crazy on the inside, but, you grin and bear it.�\n\n~ Nicholas D. Wolfwood\n\n�You can get out of the worst predicaments imaginable just like they say, Vash the Stampede�\n\n~ Nicholas D. Wolfwood\n\n�That, my friend, is because it�s so full of mercy.�\n\n~Nicholas D. Woolfwood about his cross\n\n�Whenever I look at you, I'm reminded about everything I hate about myself. It hurts.�\n\n~Nicholas D. Wolfwood to Vash\n\n�Why doesn�t anything nice ever follow you?!� ~Meryl Stryfe\n\n�I know, it�s a real drag, isn�t it?� ~Vash the Stampede\n\n�But this much is certain: everyone who become involved with him has somehow regained an emotion which was once lost.�\n\n~Meryl Stryfe about Vash\n\n�Listen to me, Mr. Cliff.� I think you�re a nice man.� How can you believe that weird guy out there is Vash the Stampede, the legendary gunman?�� That droopy eyed, cocky, upside-down haired, women-chasing lunatic who�s nuts for donuts and gorges them like a starved hog in heat, you honestly think it�s him?!�\n\n~Meryl Stryfe\n\n�That�s cute!� Mr. Vash is being put in strangle holds by the children again.�\n\n~Millie Thompson\n\n�Every journey begins with a single step; we just have to have patience.�\n\n~Millie Thompson\n\n�No one ever has the right to take the life of another.�\n\n~Rem Savernen\n\n�Vash, take care of Knives!�\n\n~Rem Savernen\n\n�If you keep your vision clear you will always find the future.�\n\n~Rem Savernen\n\n*Singing* �So, on the first evening a pebble from somewhere out of nowhere drops upon the dreaming world.� So, on the second celestial evening, all the children of the pebble join hands and compose a waltz. So, on the third celestial evening, all the children of the waltz make waves upon the dreaming world.�\n\n~Rem Savernen\n\n�This confirms why I hate children. They whine, they get depressed, and they�ll only brush their teeth when they�re told because they�re too stupid to do otherwise. They completely lack any concept of free will!�\n\n~Zazi the Beast\n\n�But to think I could kill every man, woman, and child here in the blink of an eye if I wanted to. The power of death is intoxicating.�\n\n~Legato Bluesummers\n\n�It must be the way you look, Vash the Stampede.� Your very existence seems to cause me undue irritation.�\n\n~Legato Bluesummers\n\n�"
