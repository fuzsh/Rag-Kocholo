        "text": "(If I think of my grandparents now, after all this writing and reading and imagining and remembering, two couples are thrown into relief, their outlines like clay figures in the mud where so many others are failing to resist the ebb and flow of forgetting. Both couple are elderly and Vietnamese and live in an apartment outside Paris with their eldest daughter, Both couples have been together sixty years, through two wars, and many separations. Both speak to me in a mix of Vietnamese, French and, a smattering of English….)\n\nAnam is not an easy book to summarise or write about. It was my book group choice for August and proved to be a difficult one to unpack. It was not universally enjoyed or liked and those of us who did find it interesting, only did so with reservations and caveats.\n\nFirstly a little about André Dao as this was one of the reasons many of us were very keen to read the book. Dao is “co-founder of Behind the Wire, the award-winning oral history project documenting the stories of the adults and children who have been detained by the Australian government after seeking asylum in Australia (from his web page).” He was then awarded the 2021 Victorian Premier’s Literary Award for an Unpublished Manuscript for a book about his grandfather’s life.\n\nI don’t normally include blurbs in my posts, but (1) the blurb was another reason I got excited about the possibility of reading this book and (2) it is a far more concise explanation of what will follow in this post! (My underlining)\n\nMoving from 1930s Hanoi through a series of never-ending wars and displacements to Saigon, Paris, Melbourne and Cambridge, this is a novel about memory and inheritance, colonialism and belonging, home and exile.\n\nAnam blends fiction and essay, theory and everyday life, to imagine that which has been repressed, left out, and forgotten. The grandson turns over family and personal stories of place and home, legacy and expectation, ambition and sacrifice. As he sifts through letters, photographs, government documents and memories, he has his own family to think about: a partner and an infant daughter. Is there a way to remember the past that creates a future for them? Or does coming home always involve a certain amount of forgetting?\n\nThose of you who drop by regularly, know that I love stories about memory – what we choose to remember and choose to forget, what it says about us and the generational impact of these choices – how we revise our memories and stories with new insights and maturity. I’m fascinated by stories that blur fact and fiction, or more accurately stories that use imagination and creativity to fill in the spaces about what is known. Anam has all this in spades.\n\nSo why was it so difficult?\n\nIt’s density was the common refrain. Too many ideas jammed into one book. Perhaps Dao was concerned he only had once chance to write/publish a book and that this was it.\n\nDao first thought he would write a memoir/biography about his grandfather but realised he didn’t have enough documentation. Family oral history introduced too many “versions of a myth“…\n\nToo much stood between him and his grandfather: “barriers of language and culture and my own ignorance about Vietnam and Vietnamese history and the limits of my own ability to imagine what it would be like for him in that prison.\n\nDao gave up trying to craft “a single factual account” of history or to shape the narrative into a conventional structure. The decision to couch the story in fiction was a liberating one.\n\nABC Arts | Why Melbourne writer André Dao chose fiction, not memoir, to tell his family history | 10 June 2023\n\nThe novel’s three sections take their titles from Cambridge’s academic terms: Michaelmas, Lent and Easter. A young man with his wife and baby (clearly a version of himself and his real family) is studying a master’s in law at Cambridge University. Fragments of stories about asylum seekers detained by the Australian government at Manus Island are interspersed in his story about searching for his grandfather’s past. This was one of the threads that could have been a whole story all on it’s own, but got lost along the way.\n\nAs I was reading, the words ‘unpacking’ and ‘deconstruction’ kept popping into my mind (remember those words? Twenty years ago they were everywhere, especially in teaching pedagogy.) As someone who is prone to overthinking, I quickly recognised that in Dao I had found not only the master of overthinking but of ‘unpacking’ as well, or as he prefers, to “take seriously the life of the mind“.\n\nThankfully, his wife, Lauren calls him out by telling him it’s “just ego” or “a search for better fathers“. She asks him “why complicate the story with more detail?” The problem is he doesn’t take her good advice on board! For those of us who enjoyed the book more than the others, this was the main issue – too meandering, too repetitive and too fragmented. A couple also felt that he missed the point entirely by focusing on his grandfather’s story so heavily he missed the amazing story right under his nose – how his grandmother carried on by herself with their young children in a foreign country while he was incarcerated back in Vietnam.\n\nA lot of philophisers, poets and political theorists were referred to including Hannah Arendt, Jean-Paul Sartre, Jacques Derrida, Emmanuel Levinas, Vietnamese philosopher Trần Đức Thảo, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Simone Weil, Vietnamese poet Xuân Diệu and Australian author Alexis Wright. The list of names was overwhelming by the end, even for a lover of lists like me, but two influences struck me the most.\n\nThe Book of Daniel (1971) by E. L. Doctorow\n\nPhenomenology appears to be the common denominator between a number of the names above (which is the philosophical study describing the objective nature of experience as encountered and lived by individuals. It explores the meaning and significance of the lived experience as it appears to the individual.)\n\nHowever there was one phrase that every member of my book group latched onto as the key to this story – “Volo ut sis” – I want you to be.\n\nThe only injunction within I want you to be is: you must be. You must not not be. An injunction and a promise. I will not let you not be. Amo: volo ut sis. I love you: I want you to be.\n\nI hope that by writing Anam, it has helped Dao to be.\n\nFacts:\n\nWinner of the 2021 Victorian Premier’s Literary Award for an Unpublished Manuscript.\n\nIn 2015 selected as one of Melbourne Writers Festival’s 30 Best Writers under 30.\n\nCo-founder of Behind the Wire.\n\nDao’s paternal grandfather grew up in French-ruled Vietnam. He was a Catholic intellectual and a lawyer. In 1975 after the war with America, he was imprisoned without a charge or a trial for ten years by the Communist government. His wife and adult children emigrated to Paris. He eventually joined them in late 80’s.\n\nDao’s mother left Vietnam by boat to Malaysia becoming coming to Australia.\n\nDao’s father joined her in 1985, settling in Melbourne.\n\nAndré was born in 1988, followed by his brothers Pierre and Damien.\n\nAnam took Dao 12 years to complete.\n\nFavourite Quote:\n\nDerrida begins by asking whether we forgive someone for some trangression, or whether we forgive someone something they have done. Do we forgive the who or the what?\n\nFavourite Character: The grandmother who raises her children and works in an aged care home in Laon, France waiting, hoping that her husband might be released from jail one day.\n\nThere isn’t much difference between an old, dying Viet and an old, dying European. Their needs are the same, really. They smell the same.\n\nDao’s thoughts on Alexis Wright’s writing that I’d like to remember:\n\nIt’s not just a sense of place…Wright talks about writing in a way that makes all times equally important. For Wright, time and place are one thing. Country and time immemorial aren’t seperate concepts – Country is time immemorial, the beyond-memory root of everything. And time immemorial is Country, is the ongoing and never-ending relationship of responsibility; to belong to Country is not only to belong to a place….To belong to Country is also to belong to time immemorial, to epic story, and to the relationship of responsibility – it is as much a question of what one belongs to as where.\n\nFavourite or Forget: as is often the way, the more challenging books tend to stay with you.\n\nDespite it’s flawed structure and density of ideas, the ideas were interesting, and the concept was fascinating. Also, there was the revealing, fragmented but moving stream of consciousness-style chapter (31) where he gave each of his grandparents, aunts, uncles and father a voice in an attempt to let them express their lived experience, Volo ut sis.\n\nBook 13 of 20 Books of Summer Winter\n\nTitle: Anam Author: André Dao ISBN: 9781761046940 Imprint: Hamish Hamilton Published: 2 May 2023 Format: Trade Paperback Pages: 352 Origin: TBR Dates Read: 30 July - 9 August 2023"
