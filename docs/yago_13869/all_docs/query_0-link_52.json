        "text": "Well done him. Is he a well known sailor or out of the blue?\n\nOut of the blue. He's been sailing to the British Isles solo for many years but that's all. He's a philosophy teacher.\n\nI was pleased to see that M.Huglot used a Cap Horn servo pendulum wind vane on his Contessa 32. Its manufactured in Québec and is guaranteed for a circumnavigation. I have one on my boat, but I will probably never sail a \" longue route\" (hélas).\n\nThose Cape Horns. It will be just like your hot water tank warranty.\n\nThe day after you finish a circumnavigation it will break down.\n\nMore seriously that's a heck of a voyage. Not quite my style but good for him.\n\nI was pleased to see that M.Huglot used a Cap Horn servo pendulum wind vane on his Contessa 32.

Isn't there a lot of load for a single strut?\n\nExcellent interview with him. Although my french isn't all over this it seems as if he had quite the uneventful passage. 2 knockdowns, light winds at 50south, 1 torn spinnaker a few issues with the windvane rudder and not enough snacks...\n\nIf I may ask....what's the backing plate look like? Isn't there a lot of load for a single strut?\n\nIt extends inside the lazarette roughly 18\" and is heavily braced. It is rock solid. With a servo pendulum oar, most of the force on the blade is translated into athwartship rotation that produces the steering force for the ship's rudder. As the oar is rotated on axis a few degrees by the wind vane (yellow arrows in picture), the whole oar swings in the \"strut\" in an arc to port or starboard (red arrows) as a result of the motion of the boat through the water. There is little side-to-side load on the tube through the stern; its all rotational force. The oar also has a spring-loaded breakaway design, in case you hit a log or something. Its a slick design.\n\nExcellent interview with him. Although my french isn't all over this it seems as if he had quite the uneventful passage. 2 knockdowns, light winds at 50south, 1 torn spinnaker a few issues with the windvane rudder and not enough snacks...\n\nApparently the issue with the self steering was the oar breakaway design was sometimes separating when it shouldn't have. It uses a bungie cord 'spring' that determines the impact force required to release the oar. It sounds like the bungie loops needed adjustment or replacement. An annoyance at sea, but not a show-stopper.\n\nThe interview with André Huglot reminded me of reading Moitissier's The Long Way or watching Yves Gélina's film Around the World with Jean de Sud - a different breed these old-style circumnavigators who sail without daily Facebook posts and video uplinks. They enjoy a peace and solitude that modern round-the-world racers don't get (and maybe don't want). That said, Vendée Globe would not be the success it is without the rock star personalities, modern satellite comms and the instant gratification that near-daily video posts provides the fans. I can't imagine the Golden Globe being staged again for quite a while.\n\nJust 10 more days than VDH despite going further and a shorter boat.\n\nAnd no weather routing?\n\nBut seriously, I’m guessing his effort was quite a bit less pro/less well funded, without shore support per se, so all the more impressive.\n\nWhay do you mean he went “further”? Both went France-France, no?"
