On this day 41 years ago, the lifelong president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - Josip Broz Tito (1892-1980) died.

Tito was a leader in the fight against the occupier from 1941 to 1945. He was a longtime leader of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and commander of its armed forces from the end of World War II until his death in 1980. He was one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement, which united countries from several continents that did not belong to either of the two dominant blocs at the time, the Western and Eastern blocs - NATO and the Warsaw Pact.

Opinions about his role and work are conflicting - for some Tito is a symbol of social justice, a better and more secure life, a great foreign policy reputation, and for others - a dictator with enormous political power who reckoned with political dissidents.

Josip Broz Tito died on May 4, 1980 at the Clinical Center in Ljubljana. He was buried in Dedinje in Belgrade in the House of Flowers. More than 20 million people have visited his grave so far.
