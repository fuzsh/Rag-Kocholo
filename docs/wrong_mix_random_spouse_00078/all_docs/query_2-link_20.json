        "text": "Profession: President of Yugoslavia and Revolutionary\n\nBiography: Josip Broz - or Tito as he named himself - was the communist dictator of Yugoslavia from 1963 until his death in 1980. He spearheaded the conversion of Yugoslavia to communism, influenced by the Russian model, yet came to be the only communist leader in Europe to later successfully maintain some independence from Soviet Russia.\n\nTito served in the Austro-Hungarian army during WWI, was captured and spent time in a Russian POW camp where he was exposed to Bolshevik ideas. Returning home he joined the communist party, becoming its leader in 1937.\n\nDuring WWII he laid the foundations for a communist state, forced the king into exile and raising a military force to fight the Axis powers. With Allied support Tito led his Partisan forces against the Germans, famously forcing them back from Yugoslav borders.\n\nWhen the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was created in 1945 Tito became Prime Minister. In 1953 he became the first president of Yugoslavia and in 1963 president for life. From 1953 Tito successfully steered his nation on his own path, especially after the death of Joseph Stalin. He refused to join the East European Communist bloc and pursuing his own policies including nonalignment, alliances with countries not aligned in the East West conflict.\n\nBorn: May 7, 1892\n\nBirthplace: Kumrovec, Croatia-Slovenia, Kingdom of Austria-Hungary\n\nGeneration: Lost Generation\n\nStar Sign: Taurus"
