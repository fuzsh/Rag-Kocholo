At the recently concluded party congresses in the republics, many \"old partisans\" of doubtful competence were dropped from the party apparatus. The congress probably will not designate a successor to Tito- he will be 77 in May and Yugoslav politics will continue to be affected by this unknown, but it is not as important as it was only a few years ago. Tito, as a symbol, has been an important factor in keeping the various Yugoslav nationalities united, and there is no replacement for him in this capacity. Belgrade is engaged in a large-scale decentralization of authority to the republics, however, and it is hoped that this will afford the various national- ities an equal voice in Yugoslav affairs and make the absence of a strong central figure less important. Although decentralization appears to be the safest way of dealing with the succession problem, it has its hazards. New grants of power to the republics may whet their appetites and threaten the fragile unity of the federation.

Special Report THE TRANSFER OF POWER The stage has been set to make the ninth party congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) the final act in a major trans- formation of the party leadership and organiza- tion that began with the ouster of Tito's heir apparent, Alcksandar Rankovic, in July 1966. The election results at the various republic party congresses held between November and January make it clear that younger and more liberal offi- cials will replace most of the party's old guard functionaries. The republic congresses took a major step forward by bringing into the federal and republic decision-making process people who will vigor- ously carry out Yugoslavia's economic, social, and party reforms. Sixty-nine percent of the newly elected republic central committees are freshmen members and one third of them made their repu- tations in work other than party activity. Thus, a significant transfusion of new blood and ideas into the primary policy organ of the republic party organizations has taken place. The republic nominations to the national party organs, which the forthcoming Congress will formalize, makes this pattern complete. The most powerful LCY body, the presidium, is being expanded from 35 to over 50 members, but only 12 of the old members were renominated. The average age of the new presidium membership is about 45; the range is from 35 to 58. The in- dividual members are predominantly liberal or at the very least supporters of the liberal-minded majority on all important issues. The outgoing LCY hierarchy was elected at the last party congress in December 1964, when Rankovic was still in power, and it contains many conservatives who have only paid lip service to Tito's reform movement. Others, while not necessarily obstructive or incompetent, were little Approved For Release 2005/ftZRDP79-00927A006900060002-1 Approved For Release 2005/02i -(~ ~P79-00927AO06900060002-1 more than political hacks. Tito accomplished what may have been one of the most difficult tasks of his career in somehow convincing many of these men to step down. The student riots last June and the invasion of Czechoslovakia in August gave a sense of urgency to Tito's campaign to revitalize the leadership and probably accounts for its success. A serious attempt can now be made to align the style and role of the party with the promotion of a self-management system. An article in the 14 December issue of Borba, a major Belgrade daily, dramatizes the general acceptance of the transfer of power. The article, written by Svetozar Vukmanovic-Tempo, an outgoing member of _ the . LCY presidium and an unreconstructed party mandarin of long ten- ure, defended the rejuvenation of party cadres and disclosed. that \"more than half of all party leaderships in Yugoslavia, from the base to the top, will be replaced.\" Vukmanovic noted that the replacement of old cadres will produce \"cer- tain. shocks.\" He wrote, \"It is the hardest test of every revolutionary to realize the time when he must yield his place to new and more capable cadres.\" He added, significantly, \"If a revolu- tionary fails this test, then he might find himself in a conservative position, obstructing the very development of society he once fought for-and those who obstinately retain their leading posi- tions might even be removed as. counterrevolu- tionaries.\" Many prominent party veterans took: the hint. and announced before the republic party congresses their firm intention to. step aside.for those \"who have grown up in the self-manage- ment system.\" These \"retirements\" do not nec- essarily mean political death for these individuals, some of whom may be given important party work in various party commissions. Others, stripped of their party posts, may be assigned government positions in accord with Belgrade's policy of rotating state and party officials. Special Report TITO: NOVEMBER 1968 \"The older generation must, because of physiological and other processes, grad- ually give way to younger people... the younger generation should more and more assume the leading position in the League of Communists.\" --from a speech at Osijek, Croatia JOSIP BROZ TITO, 1968 Approved For Release 2005/02/?7E:tGtAP79-00927AO06900060002-1 Approved For Release 20051021 ]EC i I bP79-00927AO06900060002-1 The peaceful transfer of political power at the ninth party congress to a younger generation will provide Yugoslavia with an important prece- dent to cope with future leadership crises. Indeed, it may even be taken as a sign that when the time comes, Yugoslavia will find a tranquil solution to its most critical leadership problem, the selection of Tito's successor. THE SUCCESSION The ninth party congress might be Tito's last, and the nation is concerned because no other leader can command the loyalty of all elements of this complex society so much at odds with itself. Tito's death would be a serious loss under any circumstances, but it should not open a pe- riod of chaos as it might a few years ago. The trend toward decentralization of political and economic power in recent years has made this possibility less likely. Moreover, as the authority of the party's central administrative machinery decreases, there will be a simultaneous decrease in the need for strong central direction from the next party leader. YUGOSLAVIAN ECONOMIC REFORM The Self-Management System. The self-management system reduces the central government's role in the economy : by giving increased decision-making re- sponsibility to local commercial enter- prises. Freed from meeting centrally de- termined goals, enterprises have become profit-oriented and act on their own judg- ment of the \"market.\" Enterprise man- agers, in turn, are subject to policies laid down by a workers' council elected by all enterprise employees. This independent spirit has also spilled over into party, gov- ernment, and military affairs. Special Report Tito has been criticized by some Yugoslavs for not grooming a successor, but his apparent neglect may be deliberate. Tito's charisma and special place in Yugoslav history make it impos- sible for anyone to assume a similar role. The most likely outcome-and the one that offers the best prospect for an orderly succession-is the emergence of a collective leadership that appoints one of its members first among equals. This collective leadership is almost certain to come out of the party's presidium, which is em- powered to elect the president of the LCY. The twelve holdover nominees to the new presidium will probably form an \"inner circle,\" and there is a good chance that any new president of the LCY in the immediate future would be selected from among these men. As time passes, however, this group-with the exception of Edvard Kardelj and Krste Crvenkovski-will probably lose its vantage ground to the newcomers. Kardelj, 58, the oldest nominee to the new presidium, has been called the father of Yugo- slavia's self-management policy and will continue to be a dominant influence in the new leadership. Crvenkovski, at 47, is one of the youngest party veterans and is an outspoken proponent of Yugo- slavia's liberal reforms. Some members of the \"inner circle\" would not be popular candidates to head the party be- cause of their lukewarm support of the reform movement. Nationality and health-and in the case of Dabcevic-Kucar, her sex-would elminate others from the frontrunner position. In any case, as long as the trend toward diversification of power and rotation of officials continues, who- ever assumes Tito's mantle will not have his power. REPUBLIC AUTONOMY The process of decentralization of federal organs and prerogatives has gained momentum in Approved For Release 2005/02~ilL7C y PDP79-00927AO06900060002-1 Approved For Release 2005/Cl~BCRT1 DP79-00927AO06900060002-1 recent months. The State Security Services' com- mand and control, for example, is now a concern of both the federation and the republics. Eco- nomic reform measures continue to shift financial means, as well as much of the decision-making power in economic matters, from the federation to republics, provinces, communes, and enter- prises. The republics have even been given a role in the formulation of foreign policy. The recently concluded local party con- gresses provide evidence of the increased inde- pendence of the republics. In the past, these con- gresses followed after and simply rubber-stamped the decisions of the all-Yugoslav party congress. Delegates to the ninth party congress will reverse this tradition when they arrive in Belgrade with an obligation to promote the decisions taken at their local congresses. In addition, the republics for the first time adopted their own party stat- utes, which are supposed to reflect their own pecularities. The republics also retained their cen- tral committees and abolished their presidiums in direct contradiction to the party structural changes proposed by the LCY last July. Greater responsibility for national defense also has been transmitted to local authorities un- der a law passed by Yugoslavia's National As- sembly in February. This authorizes local and regional levels to organize and initiate armed re- sistance. The plan provides for the establishment of territorial, defense, civil defense, and work units-using most of the civilian population-to supplement the regular armed forces. In effect, the republics would be setting up the nucleus of their own permanent standing forces. In another step toward decentralization the Yugoslav National Assembly in late December approved a revision of the constitution, the sec- ond in two years, which will considerably strengthen the prerogatives of Yugoslavia's repub- lics and provinces by increasing the power of the Special Report Kardelj will have to overcome his reputation as a theoretician, as a formulator rather than an ex- ecutor of policy, before he would be selected as Tito's replacement. Crvenkovski has been the leader of the Mace- donian party since 1963, and his nationality might make him a compromise candidate to suc- ceed Tito in the midst of a traditional Serbo- Croatian rivalry. Yugoslavia's feud with Bulgaria over Macedonia, if it continues its bitter course, might also redound to his advantage.

Proposals originating in other federal legislative bodies must now receive approval from the Chamber of Nationalities be- fore they are enacted. Moreover, two of the fed- eral chambers have been abolished, and delegates to a newly created sociopolitical chamber will be elected directly and proportionally to the popula- tion of a commune whose particular interests they will represent. The trend toward more republic autonomy probably will be accelerated by the new leader- ship. Newly elected Slovenian party secretary Andrej Marinc recently observed that the overrid- ing postwar needs for unity and highly centralized authority no longer exist, and that it is now both possible and desirable that the primary locus of party responsibility and authority be that of the republic parties. PARTY ORGANIZATION AND MEMBERSHIP The new party statutes, which will receive their final approval at the ninth party congress, provide for major changes in party organization. The principal aim of the reorganization is to streamline the party's leading organs to allow for a more rapid, flexible, and effective party re- sponse to major issues and the implementation of party policies. The party congress will continue as the high- est party organ and will meet every five, rather than four, years to establish the general political line. A new body, the conference, will be created to act as the highest party forum between con- gresses. The conference, which will consist of approximately 300 delegates, is intended to make basic policy decisions and will meet at least once a year. Most of the delegates to the conference will be elected annually by communal party con- ferences, but one quarter of them will be per- manent delegates throughout the entire period between congresses. The central committee of the LCY, and pre- sumably its executive committee, will be abol- ished. Their role as the leading day-to-day party organ will be assumed by the presidium, which will be responsible for implementing current pol- icy within the framework of the directions of the congress and conference. The presidium can be convened by the president, members of the pre- sidium, or upon the request of one republic cen- tral committee. With the rejuvenation of the party leader- ship, there has been an influx of fresh blood in the party rank and file. According to a December issue of the Yugoslav official party journal, Kom- munist, over 100,000 new members joined in 1968, more than twice the number of annual newcomers admitted in recent times. It is esti- mated that 75 percent of the newcomers are under 25. Total party membership increased by only 11,000 between 1961-66 and this stagnation was accompanied by a consistent decrease in the percentage of younger members. Although the natural drive of every organiza- tion to perpetuate itself accounts for part of the current membership drive, there are other factors as well. New members were needed to compen- sate for the losses caused by the gradual but significant \"silent purge\" that followed Ranko- vic's ouster in 1966, and there was a need to maintain the tradition of increasing the party membership at each party congress. The crisis in Czechoslovakia provided still another reason and contributed to the success of the recruitment program. Faced with external threats, the party appealed for support and the population re- sponded with patriotic fervor. Finally, the leader- ship decided that one way to deal with dissenting youth is to incorporate them into the body poli- tic. Special Report -7 - Approved For Release 2005/ YZC 4 RRDP79-00927A006900060002-1 Approved For Release 2005/02A ,Q R'bP79-00927AO06900060002-1 NEW LEADERSHIP-OLD PROBLEMS The most serious internal problems facing the new leadership are the familiar ones of nation- ality conflicts and restless youth. Although the regime attempted to minimize them, there were student disorders in Belgrade last June and three Albanian minority demonstrations in Kosovo and Macedonia in the last quarter of 1968. Yugoslavia's underdeveloped republics and provinces are fertile soil for nationalist dissenters, and the party congress probably will recommend that the LCY take a firmer position on the eco- nomic integration of these areas. The first major hurdle of the new LCY leadership will be to convince the wealthier-but equally nationalist- republics that their destiny is linked to the well- being of their poorer neighbors. Tensions may be lessened by a recent revi- sion of the constitution that provides a parlia- mentary structure for settling intersectional rival- ries and disputes. The party, however, will have to solve the underlying political, economic, and so- cial causes of the nationality problem, and this will put a severe strain on its discipline and unity. Yugoslavia's youth consider most of the older generation of political leaders narrow- minded, doctrinaire, and hostile to new ideas. They believe that the country has paid its debt to its partisan heroes, whose numbers seem to grow as the years go on, and that they should be retired RISING LIGHTS IN THE PARTY MARKO NIKEZIC DIMCE BELOVSKI KIRO GLIGOROV Out of the mainstream of party life for some time, their sudden promotion to the presidium is probably designed to give these men the necessary profile to build a following within the party apparatus. Nikezic and Belovski have been numbers one and two in the Foreign Ministry, and are well known as pragmatic, liberal-minded officials who will continue the reform policies. Nikezic, whose mother is French, is Western oriented and finished a four-year tour as ambassador to the US in 1962. Gligorov, currently deputy premier, is a former federal secretary of finance who is considered by many as the architect of the Yugoslavia's economic reform.

A topical joke among the youth tells how six men from a village joined the partisans during World War II; four were killed and after the war eight returned. The invasion of Czechoslovakia last August distracted Yugoslavia's dissatisfied youth, at least temporarily, as nearly all Yugoslavs united around Tito and the party in the face of the potential threat from Moscow. The record number of young people that joined the party during this period has helped split the youth movement. Those who joined the party have found them- selves neutralized and at the same time alienated from those who refused to join. The decentraliza- tion of Yugoslavia's youth organizations has also contributed to the fragmentation of the youth movement. As a result, the kind of street action that erupted at Belgrade University last June is not likely to recur soon. For the present at least, Yugoslavia's younger generation is optimistic that the ninth party congress will produce a revitalized party leadership to lead the country forward. This era of good feeling could be short-lived if nothing is done to meet the student demands, particularly in the areas of employment opportunity and univer- sity reform. OUTLOOK The ninth party congress, which could be Tito's last hurrah, will take a major step forward Special Report in achieving his long-set goals. The party organiza- tion will be streamlined and equipped with a vigorous new leadership dedicated to establishing an efficient socialist market economy with the broadest possible measure of social equality and national unity. Direct participation of workers in the management of their own enterprises will be more firmly established within the framework and under the guidance of a dynamic Communist Party. The potential threat from Moscow, follow- ing the invasion of Czechoslovakia, has produced a degree of unity among Yugoslavia's various na- tionalists and has underscored the stake they have in each others' welfare. Nevertheless, the explo- sive nationality question will continue to provide a problem of internal stability and the issue will be the new regime's most serious challenge. The immediate danger of student unrest seems to have passed. Improved employment opportunities and university reform measures would further deflate the student movement, which is already fragment- ing. slavia. To deal with the succession problem, Tito and his new leadership are prepared to gamble that decentralization will not enflame the sep- aratist tendencies that now smolder in some Yugoslav republics. The new leadership that comes out of the ninth party congress is talented enough to have a major impact on the control of these events, and it is pragmatic enough to rec- ognize that its best interests lie in a unified Yu o- 25X1 Approved For Release 2005 / 171tRDP79-00927A006900060002-1 Approved For Release 2005/02/17 : CIA-RDP79-00927AO06900060002-1 Secret Secret Approved For Release 2005/02/17 : CIA-RDP79-00927AO06900060002-1"
