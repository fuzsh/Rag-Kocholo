        "text": "I hate to toot my own horn. But, it’s safe to say that I have a few books out there by now. I’ve had to field this question a lot recently: Where do I start?\n\nI began by writing historical fantasy and then alternative history. Most recently, I am writing what could be dubbed contemporary thrillers. So what does one choose as an entry point? At the time of writing this post, I’ve written four completed (two of each related) series of novels and am currently working the fifth, which I call The Russia Chronicles.\n\nMost-all of my novels have some kind of a historical bent, whether it is set in the nineteenth century or in the 2000s. I love creating my characters, and then setting them among real historical events and locations.\n\nSo, if you want to read some of this stuff, what’s the first thing to do?\n\nStep One Is Free:\n\nThis is admittedly a shamelessly honest plug. I’d recommend starting by signing up to my mailing list, if you haven’t already. There, you can get a sampling of free ebook novellas from all the series in all of genres that I write. So, Step One. There you have it.\n\nHowever, that may not be the end-all-and-be-all. After all, where exactly you start depends on what you like to read. So let’s have a look at what I write that might interest you most and the best places to dive in:\n\nHistorical Fantasy:\n\nI got my start here. My first trilogy, Keepers of the Stone is a clean YA fantasy set in South Asia, America and Europe during the late 1800s. Think of it as kind of a travelogue, but also with a demonic order and a magic gem. Book One: Outcast is free, in addition to the bonus content novella that you can get here.\n\nMy second trilogy, Voyages of Fortune, is a sequel to the first. It’s enjoyable in its own right and Book One: Hidden Truths is also free, though I’d honestly recommend starting from Keepers, the beginning of the entire seven book saga.\n\nAlternative History:\n\nI’ve always thought that this was a bit of a funny name for a genre. Isn’t all historical fiction – or fiction, in general – technically alternative?\n\nAt any rate, my alternative history books books do ask a ‘What If?’ question. They’re called Tito’s Lost Children and the sequel series, Europe’s Lost Children. There’s no fantasy world, but there is a fictional vendetta that led Josip Broz Tito, the Marshal of Yugoslavia, to name an untested teenager as his successor; she has to try to stop the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. No pressure, or anything. It’s my arrogant opinion, but they are my best writing so far.\n\nStart with book one in either series: Tito’s Lost Children: War One: Slovenia. Or, Europe’s Lost Children: Battling Brexit, which follows the adventures of Tito’s granddaughter and her friends. It even leads into an alternate future!\n\nAction-Adventure Historical Thrillers:\n\nI’m not sure that you could call something set in 2000s Moscow historical. But, at the time of writing, my latest project, The Russia Chronicles, is about an American teenager who has to throw his lot in with a bunch of Russian kids fleeing broken homes and trying to live on the streets. Fair warning: sometimes the way they talk will make your ears bleed. I consider it the darkest thing I’ve written yet. There’s some fun, too — Spoiler alert: by the end of the series they end up taking over Russia.\n\nBook One is called: The Streets of Moscow. The spinoff novella, Pagans’ Cult, will be offered via my mailing list (Even though it’s not out quite yet, you’ll get it free if you sign up, anyway, when it’s ready).\n\nSo, depending on what you like to read, I guess there are a number of adventures to pick from, and places to start. That would be my answer.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMy books are fiction; all of the main characters are fictional. However they were inspired by real events. My latest alternative history/historical fiction series, Europe’s Lost Children, takes Maršal Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia’s ‘shadow family’ into the almost-present day. They must try to bring Yugoslavia back together, while some real-life major European leaders (fictionally, of course) entrust my main character and her friends with the responsibility to run the European Union Covert Action Service – kind of like the EU’s ‘what if’ FBI.\n\nEurope’s Lost Children is set during real-life events; many of them occurred during my time living in Brussels, while doing a PhD in Political Science and EU Studies during the 2010s. Book Two: The Migrant Crisis is set during wave of migration, mostly from Syria and Iraq, that occurred during 2015-2016. In the book, our protagonists have a fictional role to play in causing it, and then trying to stop it, both with the best of intentions. Still, a lot of other stuff based on real modern history goes on, too. Let’s have a chapter by chapter look at the facts and the fiction below:\n\nOne: Threats on the Horizon, Part I: The Cabinet of the European Council’s president is very real, as is the third bailout package for Greece during the height of the Eurozone crisis. The parking lot under the Justus Lipisus building really was renovated to provide more meeting space.\n\nTwo: Brutalism: Brutalism is a real architectural style. Bosnian children of war rape really do face discrimination. The abandoned hotel near Foča was, in fact, the local ‘Crisis Command Center’ headquarters of the Bosnian Serb forces during the 1990s wars. Foča was the sight of one of the most infamous rape camps during the breakup of Yugoslavia.\n\nAnything about Brexit, ISIS, the Migrant Crisis all being connected by a bunch of angstful children of war rape is made up by me.\n\nThree: Threats on the Horizon, Part II: The Macedonian wiretapping scandal really did happen.\n\nFour: The Wiretapping Scandal: The ‘pet-project makeover’ of the capital that the Macedonian government had at the time, Skopje 2014, is historical. The EU really did broker an agreement between the Macedonian Government and the opposition, calling upon the then prime minister to step down. My characters’ involvement is, of course, fictional.\n\nAccusations have been made about the leading party in Macedonia at the time purchasing the kind of data manipulation software that Emilija mentions. The former prime minister really did try to blame the wiretapping on foreign spies.\n\nFive: An Anthem for Europe: I never name refugee violinist who plays ‘Ode to Joy,’ the EU’s anthem, on the Idomeni border crossing between Greece and Macedonia; he is depicted as colluding with one of my fictional antagonists out of desperation. However, a Syrian music student really did play the EU’s anthem on his violin at that border crossing during August 2015.\n\nSix: Empty Handed: Germany’s ‘open door’ policy on welcoming Syrian refugees happened. Elena’s role in inspiring it didn’t, because Elena doesn’t really exist. The migrant ‘bottleneck’ at Budapest East train station is historical.\n\nSeven: Fallout: Elena and Hristijan’s discussion of Polish and Hungarian politics is faithful. The pro-migrant demonstration in Sweden really did happen. The attempted terror attack on it is made up by me, though the border closures mentioned really did happen over general migrant and terror concerns.\n\nEight: The Valletta Conference: The conference on migration from Africa to Europe, held in Valletta, Malta, did occur in the venues mentioned in the book. To my knowledge, a snarky, no-nonsense twenty-something from the Balkans never really shouted all of the delegates down.\n\nNine: Sins of the Grandparents: The major Yugoslav public figures who Elena is descended from were real. Tito did, in fact, have a wolf-dog named Tiger during World War Two.\n\nTen: Compromised: The 2015 Paris terror attacks were, of course, real. The rest of the events in the chapter are fiction.\n\nEleven: The Puppetmasters: All happenings are thought up by me.\n\nTwelve: The Raid: The Abdsalam brother who wasn’t killed while perpetrating the Paris attacks was really captured via a police raid on a home in the Brussels neighborhood of Molenbeek in 2016. The police did actually figure out where he might be hiding out due to the family harboring him receiving larger than normal pizza deliveries. Anything about his discovery being secretly ordered by a bunch of Bosnian-Serb orphans is completely made up.\n\nThirteen: Fracture Points: The Brussels Airport/subway terror attacks happened. The video that Ayoub is in when captured was inspired by a real video of a Belgian-Arab kid who had been brought to Syria to fight.\n\nFourteen: The Sting: The neighboring towns of Karkamiş, in Turkey, and Jarabulus in Syria really were split up by the war. Everything else is fiction.\n\nFifteen: Stranded: All happenings are fictional, except for a discussion which mentions the actual Kurdish front lines at the time.\n\nSixteen: The Crossing: The train station square in front of Ismir, Turkey, is a staging area for migrants trying to cross the Aegean Sea to Greece. The crossing usually takes place in small, overcrowded dingys. There really are NGOs made of lifeguards, who rescue drowning migrants who can’t swim. Unfortunately, the ‘lifeguard’ who Ayoub and Elena meet, has much more nefarious, personal intentions.\n\nSeventeen: Carrying On: The Moria migrant ‘Hot Spot’ on the island of Lesbos still exists, and is apparently a crap-hole, especially if you are a migrant. The rest is fiction.\n\nEighteen: Full-Circle: The migrants in the Idomeni camp did try to break through the border with a train carriage in real life.\n\nNineteen: Breaking Out: Other than the reference to the President of Republika Srpska, everything is fiction. However, while writing this chapter — mostly a tragic state of relations between a mother (You’ll know the mom if you’ve read Tito’s Lost Children) and her unwanted daughter — I realized that I wasn’t writing a story about high EU politics, or migrant crises.\n\nEurope’s Lost Children a story about parents and their kids; it’s ultimately about the passing of legacy from generation to generation. That’s what takes center stage in Europe’s Lost Children Book Three: Orphans’ Plight.\n\nEurope’s Lost Children: The Migrant Crisis is available here.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nTito’s Lost Children is an alternative history series set during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. It asks the question: what if Maršal Tito, Yugoslavia’s strongman, had secretly named a totally untested successor? The main characters and plot are fictional. However, they are set amid the real historical events of the Yugoslav Wars, and the characters often encounter real historical figures. Below I take a battle-(chapter)-by-battle look at some of the real history behind War (book) Three: Bosnia and Herzegovina. You can find similar posts related to books one and two here and here.\n\nHopefully I won’t give away too many spoilers, but if you really mind them, consider yourself warned! Let’s get started.\n\nBattle One: The Return. During the more intense shellings of Sarajevo, the patients at the Sarajevo hospital had to be moved to the basement as the wards were too dangerous. The Serb forces took over the main power plant of Sarajevo, largely depriving the city of electricity. This included the water pumps, leaving the city without running water.\n\nBattle Two: A Meeting with the President. President Slobodan Milošević of Serbia is, of course, historical. His connection with Predrag is totally fictional. President Alija Izetbegović and General Divjak are also historical. The plan they hatch with Hristijan is made up my me. All of the locations are real places that have been as faithfully represented as possible, though I based the floor plan of Mojca’s apartment on the flat I rented during my first year living in Slovenia, which would have been built at about the same time. Mojca’s apartment in Sarajevo, however, has the bad luck to front on a road called the Vojvode Putnika – present day Zmaja od Bosne. This was the infamous Snipers’ Alley during the siege of Sarajevo.\n\nBattle Three: The Defenders of Srebrenica. Srebrenica was one of the four main Bosnian Muslim enclaves surrounded by Serb forces, during the war. The UN fact-finding mission to Srebrenica, led by General Morillon, is historical. So are most of the ensuing events related to it – minus Mojca getting a gun pointed at her. Nasir Orić, one of Srebrenica’s head defenders, is historical as well. It is generally true that some Mujaheddin forces did come to fight with the Bosnian ones. There were also fighting units of the BiH army that were Muslim in their orientation.\n\nThe prison in Belgrade is fictional.\n\nBattle Four: Under Siege. I must credit the descriptions of daily life under the siege of Sarajevo, and the ‘hacks’ that Jovana’s neighbors come up with as ways around shortages of basic items, as largely being informed by Barbara Demik’s Logavina Street: Life and Death in a Sarajevo Neighborhood.\n\nThe Vance-Owen peace plan that Predrag mentions is historical, as is the Bosnian Serbs rejection of it. Cave bars in the Belgrade neighborhood of Savamala are a thing. Shady money changers flourished in Belgrade during the war, due to rampant inflation. The White Eagles paramilitary really did exist. The mission Predrag sends them on is, of course, fictional.\n\nThe young couple that Hirstijan meets while on a ‘water run’ to the Sarajevsko brewery is heavily based on Boško Brkić and Admira Ismić, the ‘Romeo and Juliet’ of Sarajevo. I elected to leave the couple in the book unnamed.\n\nBeyond general things like the presence of the United Nations Protection Force, and signs that say ‘look out, sniper!’ all of the characters and events in Mojca’s ‘siege’ are fictional.\n\nBattle Five: Bastards’ Revenge. The resort of Sveti Stefan and the Villa Miločer are real places and you can go there. Slobodan Milošević and his wife, Mirjana Marković, really did have two children named Marko and Marija. Their presence at Sveti Stefan at the same time as some of the main characters, and the ensuing mayhem, is fictional.\n\nThe peace talks on the HMS Invincible, a British aircraft carrier, are historical. The treacherous dirt path going up Mount Igman was the only way to get in or out of Sarajevo and into to government held territory over-land for most of the war.\n\nBattle Six: Maršal Tito and his Mistress. Milovan Djilas and Davorjanka ‘Zdenka’ Paunović were real people. They were, respectively, a member of Tito’s inner Circle, and Tito’s mistress during World War II.\n\nThe Roman Well cistern in Belgrade and Njegoš’s tomb in Montenegro are real places (Indeed, the latter is where the author got the inspiration to write Tito’s Lost Children!). There really is a bunker built during the 1950s in Belgrade’s Kalemegdan Fortress. On a visit to Belgrade, I was told that there are rumors that another one that might have been built with access to the Roman Well. Anything about imprisoning Zdenka inside said rumored bunker and the ensuing vendetta is made up by me.\n\nBattle seven: Building Bridges. The iconic stone bridge in Mostar really did get blown up in November 1993. The Croat and Bosnian government forces did turn on each other even as they were both fighting the Serbs, until the Washington Agreement ended this conflict-within-a-conflict in February 1994. Part of the Croats’ and Bosnian Muslims’ common front line with the Serb forces really did run, more or less, along the Neretva River valley gorge. I may have exaggerated how precisely it did and/or how much of a no-man’s land it was for dramatic effect. The situation of the feuding Croat and Bosnian Muslims refugees that Mojca and Hristijan must escort up that river valley gorge on their way to Sarajevo, is based on the forced population flows between Serbs, Bosnian Muslims and Croats. The justifications given for the two groups enmity are based on the historical conflicts in the region. However, the feuding refugee group itself is fictional.\n\nBattle Eight: The Marketplace Racketeer. Food racketeering was rampant in Sarajevo during the siege. The mention of the siege and fall of Vukovar is historical.\n\nThe Palace of Yugoslavia – today’s Palace of Serbia — is very real. The Serb war summit that takes place there in the book is fictional. However, there is some evidence that the Serb leaders did premeditate ethnic cleansing in Bosnia to some extent.\n\nThe shell that fell on the Sarajevo Marketplace in February 1994 is historical, as are Bosnian Serb claims that the Bosnian government forces were, in fact, responsible. In real life, international investigations into where the shell was fired from proved inconclusive.\n\nBattle Nine: June Twenty-Eighth, 1994. The coup against President Milošević is completely fictional. However, the Topčider command bunker is very real. As mentioned above, the second bunker in Kalemegdan Fortress is rumored to exist. It is likely based on the one that has already been discovered there, and serves as the basis for Milošević’s bunker in the book.\n\nBattle Ten: Ostrog Monastery. The Ostrog monastery is real. Anything about Serb paramilitaries showing up and shooting at it is not.\n\nBattle Eleven: Flight. Ostrog Monastery getting shelled with artillery fire is just as fictional as paramilitaries shooting at it. Zlatko’s reference to “the camp at Foča” is a reference to one of the most infamous rape camps during the war.\n\nBattle Twelve: The Hunting Party. Having been on it, I can confirm that the road which winds along the Piva River is indeed treacherous. General Kurvić and anything he did to Mojca’s family is fictional. However, I very loosely based his position and war record on the real Drina Corps Chief of Staff of the Army of Republika Srpska. He was one of the first men to be tried for war crimes by the ICTY.\n\nI should note that the title of this chapter and the mention of the village of Čelebići is a shout-out to a movie also called The Hunting Party. It makes a good, funny watch, especially if you are, or grew up around, TV journalists and like dark humor. But, I digress…\n\nBattle Thirteen: Verdi Rewritten. The Kanli Kula amphitheater is a real place. Dobrica Ćosić was a Serb nationalist writer and president of Yugoslavia. Anything about him completely retooling an opera to make it a Serb propaganda version of the main characters’ adventures is, of course, totally fictional.\n\nBattle Fourteen: Scorched Earth. The October 1995 ceasefire is historical, as is the reference to the summer 1995 massacres at Srebrenica and Žepa. Milošević’s plans to use the ceasefire as a smoke screen to gear up for the full-on invasion of Bosnia and the massacre all of all non-Serbs is fictional. However, in real life, many Serb paramilitaries remained active during the ceasefire and the CIA did uncover evidence that Serbia was trying to secretly resupply the Bosnian Serb forces, despite Milošević’s dubious assurances to the contrary. General Mladić is historical.\n\nMilošević’s plans to become the next Maršal of a Serbanized Yugoslavia, after the fictional invasion, are also fiction. However, in real life he later did leave the office of President of Serbia to become the president of rump Federal Yugoslavia, which I suppose is the next closest thing. So, who knows? Maybe those were his plans?\n\nBattle Fifteen: Reunited. All events and characters are fictional.\n\nBattle Sixteen: Dayton. The Dayton peace talks, Richard Holbrooke and General Clark are, of course, historical, as are all the events that one of the characters participates in, including: napkin shuttle diplomacy, the PowerScene virtual maps machine gambit and the thirty-seven minute ‘peace agreement’. I based the dialogue on the descriptions of these events in Holbrooke’s memoir To End a War and The Death of Yugoslavia, one of the most authoritative accounts there is of the Yugoslav Wars. The Bosnian Foreign Minister is also historical.\n\nBattle Seventeen: Into the Deluge. The Rajska Dolina Hotel is a real place in the Jahornia ski resort near Pale. It served as the seat of the Republika Srpska’s parliament during the war. Dr. Karadžić is, of course, historical. Anything about an overly paranoid twenty-something sticking a gun in his face and ordering the entire Bosnian Serb leadership evacuated from the hotel is totally fictional.\n\nThe renewed siege of Sarajevo, as well as the post-Dayton Serb invasion and ethnic cleansing of government and Croat held Bosnia are fictional (See Battle Fourteen). During World War II, the First Proletarian Brigade really did retreat over Mount Igman.\n\nBattle Eighteen: Republic Day. The title of the chapter is a reference to November 29th, when the action in the chapter takes place. It’s the anniversary of when the partisan leadership declared that there would be a multi-ethnic Yugoslavia if they won World War II. It was one of the most important holidays in Yugoslavia.\n\nAll fighting, duels, attempted assassinations and other events are fictional.\n\nPeace. All events are fictional. However, the location where the final scene of Tito’s Lost Children takes place, overlooking Sarajevo, is very real. If you haven’t read book three yet, I’ll leave you to guess what happens here:\n\nTito’s Lost Children War Three: Bosnia and Herzegovina is available here.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWhen I got off my Air Montenegro flight in Podgorica during the summer of 2017, I still thought I that would go into academia. I was set to defend my PhD in Brussels, where I was living at the time, in only a few months. I had come to the Balkans for summer holiday.\n\nFate had other ideas. There were a lot of things on that trip that led to the moment when I saw, in indefinite terms, what became the Tito’s Lost Children trilogy laid out in front of me: walking the walls of Dubrovnik for the first time, heading to the town of Trebinje in Republika Srpska, standing in the courtyard of the Cetinje Monastery, gazing up at the cliff-perched Ostrog Monastery, standing on the beach before the resort island of Sveti Stefan….\n\nMore than any of the others, though, I’d have to say that the idea for the Tito’s Lost Children trilogy hit me like a ton of bricks while I was standing on the dais behind Saint-Poet-King Njegoš’s tomb. I remember walking up the covered concrete stairways toward the tomb on the summit of Mount Lovćen. Speaking with the tomb’s caretaker, him telling me how Njegoš and Slovene poet France Prešeren were both, in some way shape or form, advocates of Yugoslav unity. He spoke Serbo-Croat and I spoke in Slovene. Then I went into the tomb itself, with its large obsidian statue.\n\nFinally, I walked out onto the dais. All of Montenegro was spread out before me. It just clicked: What if Marshall Josip Broz Tito had named a successor, ordained to try and keep all of Yugoslavia’s nationalities together after his death? I saw the whole story in a flash: a young woman suddenly faced with an overwhelming undertaking and responsibility, her country-bumpkin, scrappy brother, their hard-fighting but mute sidekick, a hung-out army captain determined to win redemption in the eyes of his father. I had been coming to the region for years; it was like I’d never seen that the (very fictional) story was just sitting here, waiting for someone to tell it. I knew what I had to do.\n\nAt the time, a friend in Ljubljana was moving to a bigger flat. He had offered to connect me with has landlord. At first I declined, telling him that I planned in remain in Brussels at least for the time being. Shortly after my return from Montenegro, I decided that I would take the plunge. I contacted him again. By December the newly minted Dr. Anžur Clement had moved to Ljubljana. So, thanks to that friend for presenting the opportunity that brought me to Slovenia, the country of my ancestors where Tito’s Lost Children was penned.\n\nThanks as always to my mom, who is my first-line beta reader. She is first to tell me if a draft has gone off into left field. With Tito’s Lost Children she not only did that, but she also proved quite useful to bounce ideas off of, drawing on her years of experience as a journalist, editor and her memories of reporting on the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. Indeed, the character of Mojca would not have been as rich and complex if it weren’t for her suggestions early on. Thanks to my Dad as well. You both have been incredibly supportive throughout the whole process of my moving to Slovenia to pursue my writing career.\n\nFor Tito’s Lost Children, I was also fortunate enough to find a superb copy editor and proofreader, when my old one proved unavailable. She always makes sure that I spell the names of the towns right, when writing in English about a place where I understand the language results in a sort of cognitive dissonance. She was nice enough to be okay with it, when I accidentally sent her an earlier version of book one. She whipped the manuscript right back into shape.\n\nAdditionally, thanks to my friends here in Slovenia, who proved largely supportive when I told them that I wanted to write an adventure story set during the breakup of Yugoslavia, even though I grew up a continent away. In many cases you were willing to share your own personal stories and even offered a few corrections when I got a detail or two wrong. You’re input doubtlessly improved the text. And, to my PhD supervisors who, in addition to putting up with me during my PhD, made me a good enough researcher to pull off writing these books, if I do say so myself. And, to one of my best friends from high school, who created a monster: you know what you did.\n\nFinally, my most sincere thanks to my readers; especially those who have taken the time to not only read Tito’s Lost Children, but to have found this. I hope you had as much fun reading Tito’s Lost Children as I had writing it! Thanks for reading the stuff that comes out of my sometimes-crazy head. If you’d like to let me know what you thought, the best way is to leave a review here on Amazon.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI’ve said it more than once and I’ll say it again: Tito’s Lost Children is a work of fiction and all of the main characters are completely fictitious. However, many aspects of the books are inspired by real people, places and events. Let’s have a chapter by chapter look at some of the real history that War (book) Two: Croatia is based on.\n\nBattle One, The Cult of Personality: As I mentioned in an earlier post about the historical inspirations behind Book One: Slovenia, Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, is historical. He was accused, in some circles, of emulating Tito’s cult of personality in order to consolidate his power. The Carrington Plan is historical as well. The Cetinje monastery in Montenegro’s former capital is very real. The Serbian warlord Arkan and his Serbian Tigers paramilitary stayed there while they helped lay siege to Dubrovnik. Miroslava, his fictional bastard daughter, references this in the book.\n\nBattle Two, The Battle of the Barracks: The title makes reference to the fight that resulted from the Croatian police forces surrounding the Yugoslav People’s Army garrisoned in Croatia in their barracks. The JNA forces in Gospić tried to bust their way out, resulting in the destruction of most of the town. The character of Colonel Čavar is historical; it is true that the commander of the barracks was found dead after the JNA surrendered to the Croatian forces, though it is arguable whether he was killed by his own troops, or whether the Croatian forces killed him. The book gives its own answer to this, later on in battle four.\n\nBattle Three, Causalities of War: The specific photo-op that occurs with the wounded soldiers at the Zagreb train station is fictional. But, the scene was inspired by a Slovene friend’s memory of being at the train station in Zagreb at the time and seeing the wounded soldiers there. The siege of Vukovar and the fighting in East Slavonia, which occurs in the background for much of book two is historical. While we never go there in the books, Vukovar comes back in a big way in book three. Sorry, I can’t give away more without major spoilers.\n\nBattle Four, Daggers in the Back: The Yugoslav Air Force bombed the Croatian presidency building in real life. The plotline related to the Croatians rigging their own presidential palace to explode as a publicity stunt is fictional, but inspired by Serb accusations that the Croatians had really had done that, rather than admit to the bombing. The succession of Macedonia is historical. Anything about President Tudjman getting a gun stuck in his face by a really pissed off twenty-something is, of course, completely fictional.\n\nBattle Five, Island Lessons: Barren Island and the remains of the Yugoslav political prison on it really do exist, as does the resort island of Sveti Stefan. The family Predrag protects and their situation is completely fictional.\n\nBattle Six, On the Run: The state of the bridge between Rab island and the Croatian mainland is historically depicted, though in real life the road was mined. I took a bit of dramatic liberty with our heroes’ escape on the ferryboat. The ferry, too, would have been within range of Serb artery on the front lines.\n\nBattle Seven, The Hrvatska Dubica Massacre: The Hrvatska Dubica massacre is historical.\n\nBattle Eight, The Gypsy Way: Trebinje and the hills between it and Dubrovnik are very real. The National Opera of Niš is fictional, through I did loosely base the physical theater and its location off of the Sindjleć theater in that city. The siege of Dubrovnik and the positions of the Yugoslav forces are historical.\n\nBattle nine, The Cold Reality: Predrag’s description of the ruined house that he is staying in is consistent with what Serb paramilitaries often did to the homes of non-Serbs when they ethnically cleansed a village. Anything about deflecting bullets with electromagnetic knifes is totally fictional, though an engineer did tell me it could work.\n\nBattle ten, The Convoy of Peace: There really was a convoy of peace led to Dubrovnik by a ship called the Slavija One. In reality it was headed up by Stipe Mesić, the President of the by-then-defunct Federal Presidency. It was filled with journalists and dignitaries, many of whom spent their time in the ship’s bar and was stopped in the Mljet channel by the People’s Navy. Jovana’s actions in the book are based off of Mesić statements and actions during this stand-off, as is the captain’s attitude, except Mesić didn’t also have to deal with a drunk and misbehaving adoptive brother at the same time she was negotiating passage!\n\nBattle eleven, The Siege of Dubrovnik: Refugees from the surrounding villages did flee into besieged Dubrovnik as the JNA advanced from Montenegro. Not a single boat was left afloat in the harbor of Dubrivnik’s old town by the end of the siege. The specific shelling of Dubrovnik is fictional. As for that secret cache of experimental Yugoslav weaponry that Hristijan finds out about? Well, you’ll see…\n\nBattle twelve, Objekt 505: Objekt 505 — the Željava air force base — is historical; Serb forces really did blow it up. The television program that Mojca is watching at the beginning of the chapter is also historical. The reference that Duško makes to President Milošević of Serbia unseating the president of the SAO Krajina is based on real events, as well. The evidence that Jovana discovers of US-Yugoslav collaboration on the space program is fictional. Actually, I put it in as a shout-out to the mocumentary ‘Huston, we have a problem,’ which is worth a watch if you want to see another alternate history of the region.\n\nBattle thirteen, Roads to Sarajevo: The Bosnian Serbian Autonomous Oblasts mentioned in this chapter were the precursor to Republika Srpska, the Bosnian Serb entity that fought the Sarajevo government.\n\nBattle fourteen, Sarajevo, We Have a Problem: Warren Zimmermann was indeed the US ambassador to Yugoslavia and he did meet with Bosnian president Alija Izetbegović at the same time their ‘characters’ do in the book. Shortly after, Izetbegović declared Bosnian and Herzegovina independent, leading to theories that Izetbegović was encouraged to do so at the meeting. The reception held for Zimmermann at Sarajevo’s national library is made up by me. It is true, however, that at the war’s outset, President Izetbegović was reluctant to believe that there would, in fact, be a war. The Bosnian Presidency members Fikret Abdić and Biljana Plavšić are historical; so is the ethnic cleansing of Bijeljina by Arkan’s Serbian Tigers and Mirko’s White Eagles. The Banja Dvorovi spa complex is real. Civjetin Mijatović, another World War II hero with the partisans, is historical as well.\n\nBattle Fifteen, The Council of National Salvation: The Council of National Salvation really did happen, minus my fictional characters, of course, as did the Serb takeover of the police academy on Vrača hill. The woman Jovana sees get shot as part of the resulting demonstrations is implied to be the first causality of the siege of Sarajevo. The Sarajvsko Brewery was one of the only two major factories to remain in production throughout the siege of Sarajevo, the other being the Drina cigarette factory. The house the General Aksentović gets on Jekovac street is a real place.\n\nBattle sixteen, “I believe I Have Been Kidnapped.”: President Izetbegović really did get kidnapped by the JNA after landing at the Sarajevo Airport on 2 May 1992. His conversation with the anchor on the news has been represented faithfully. Zlatko’s plot for the kidnapping to be part of a take over of all of Bosnia is, of course, fictional; though some evidence may suggest that Fikret Abdić did attempt to take power and form a quisling regime with Serb support. He denies these allegations. Generals Kukanjac and MacKenzie are historical, as is the incident where the latter mistook Muslims for Serbs in Lukavica, while trying to rescue Izetbegović.\n\nBattle seventeen, A Question of Unity: The character of General Divjak is historical. The Bosnian forces really did try and stop the JNA when it attempted to leave the Sarajevo barracks. The voice that yelled “Talks tomorrow are out of the question” over General Divjak’s walkie-talkie has never been identified. So who knows, maybe it could have been Hristijan? The fight in the Sarajevsko Brewery’s basement is made up by me.\n\nBattle eighteen, Civil War: The measures taken at Sarajevo’s Koševo hospital during a shelling have been represented as faithfully as possible. The Serb forces did have a position on mount Trebević, where Predrag is observing the besieged city, about to go back to Belgrade. We will get to meet his father — President Milošević of Serbia himself — in War Three: Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI’ve written this as a sort of companion to Tito’s Lost Children War (book) One. One of the things I enjoy about writing these books is the idea that a story like this could have happened in the real world, in real places that you can go to. So, to give the book more of a grounding in real history, the identification of certain historical events and persons may prove helpful and interesting to readers.\n\nLet me start by saying that the books which comprise Tito’s Lost Children are novels. The main characters, Jovana, Hristijan, Mojca, Predrag and Zlatko are fictional, as are their actions and (mostly) those of the real historical figures they encounter. However they sometimes also encounter real events and people that were important to the breakup of Yugoslavia. I will point some of these references out by chapter (battle). Hopefully, it won’t give too many spoilers if you haven’t read the book, but if you really mind them consider yourself forewarned. Here goes:\n\nBattle One, Ohrid Trout: All of the news the characters mention happening in the background of their lives is historical. The village of Vevčani really exists and tried to declare independence as it’s own country after Macedonia became independent, because the inhabitants didn’t like the idea of being surrounded by ethnically Albanian villages.\n\nBattle Two, Government in Exile: The parliament of Kosovo really was shut down and subsequently met secretly in Kaçanik. Jusuf Zejnullahu did serve as the prime minister of its self-declared republic for a time during the early nineties. His actions in the book are, of course, fiction.\n\nBattle Three, The Partisan’s Granddaughter: General Popović was a real person and was considered a war hero in Yugoslavia. The First Proletarian Brigade was a real fighting force in the Second World War; it’s continued role in the books is fictional. So is the character of Mojca’s grandmother.\n\nBattle Four, The Brigade: The design of the 1974 Yugoslav constitution that created the Presidium has been presented as faithfully as possible, though Jovana’s role in Yugoslavia and the ‘secret’ amendment to that constitution are, of course, completely speculative.\n\nBattle Five, Our Lady of Medjugorje: Medjugorje is a real place, as are the things in it like Cross Mountain. Some of the people there who claim to have visions of the Virgin Mary, continue to have them on a regular basis.\n\nBattle Six, The Serbs of the Krajina: The Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina and the Log Revolution are historical, as are President Babić and Police Chief Martić. The rest of the characters are fictional. The JNA (Yugoslav People’s Army) did aid the Krajina Serbs, though in the story, the extent of the aid at that specific point in history may be exaggerated for purposes of simplicity.\n\nBattle Seven, The Croat of Knin: The declaration that Duško wants Jovana to give her support to is historical. The fighting and stealth techniques that Jure (and others) practice are completely made up by me, but the knives they use are real kinds of knives, as is Hristijan’s and the Serb Cutter.\n\nBattle Eight, Duško’s Gambit: The Pakrac Clash is historical and has been presented faithfully. While it is true that the Krajina Armed Forces did persecute Croats on its territory, the specific ‘tax’ Duško mentions is fictional.\n\nBattle Nine, Plitvice Lakes: The Serbs’ Meeting of Truth and the conflict that occurred at Plitvice Lakes are historical, as is Milošević’s/the JNA’s attempt to call a state of emergency in Yugoslavia. The Croatian combatant who dies so that Hristijan and Jovana can get away is implied to be the first person to die in the Yugoslav conflicts. The Veliki Slap is a real place, as is the waterfall that plays a role in the story on the way to it.\n\nBattle Ten, Yugoslav Youth Day: The House of Flowers is where Tito is buried and Kumrovec was where he was born. The existence of Yugoslav Youth Day and the Slet are historical. However, as the fictional mayor of Kumrovec states in the book, the specific ceremony and baton relay differs somewhat from how a ‘real’ one would have looked, while still being based on it. The Serb Volunteer Guard and Arkan are historical, though the daughter Predrag mentions is fictional.\n\nBattle Eleven, Bura: The Bura windstorm is really a concern in north west Croatia and costal Slovenia. The bunker Jovana hides in is a reference to the bunkers that the Albanian totalitarian dictator Hoxha ordered built all over his country. The place where Predrag likes to brood in Belgrade is real, though the specific statue is fictional (there’s a different statue there).\n\nBattle Twelve, Galeb, or the International Community : The Galeb was Maršal Tito’s personal yacht, and it’s location at the time has been faithfully presented. The Navy base’s Admiral is fictional. The arena in Pula is very real. President Poos is historical as well, though his visit to Yugoslavia at that time is fictional. The Metelkova barracks are a real place, which today (fun fact!) is no longer a military compound but Ljubljana’s main alternative culture hub. General Aksentović is fictional, as is his love of Šljivovica, though I very loosely based his character on one of the real top JNA commanders in Slovenia at the time (If you’re that interested in which one, they share the same initials).\n\nBattle Thirteen “Živi naj vsi narodi…”: Admiral Mamula and President Kučan are historical. Kučan’s speech at the Slovene independence ceremony has been faithfully depicted, though not in its entirety. It occurred in present-day Republic Square. The other the parts of the ceremony were fictionalized.\n\nBattle Fourteen, The Partisan and the Domobranka: The story of Prešeren and Julija is historical and the line Hristijan says to Antonija after almost falling in the river is a reference to one of Prešeren’s poems about Julija. While the characters of Antonija and Janez are, of course, made up, the conflict between the domobranci and the partisans during World War Two was very real. The domobranci were persecuted by the victorious partisans right after the war, and having family on the ‘losing’ side of the conflict is still considered something of a stigma in Slovenia today. The extent to which it causes problems for Antonija more than forty years later in the 1990’s may have been exaggerated for dramatic effect.\n\nBattle Fifteen, The Ten-Day War: In real life, Slovenia’s president and defense minister can’t agree on who gave the order to fire on the JNA. The helicopter that Mojca’s sees get shot down is historical as are the peace talks that she mentions Jovana is attending in Zagreb.\n\nBattle Sixteen, The Holmec Incident: The fighting at Holmec really did happen and the border crossing really did get torched.\n\nBattle Seventeen, Triglav: All the trivia that Jovana gives about Mt. Triglav and Aljaž Tower is true; it is said that you are not a ‘true’ Slovenian if you have not climbed Triglav once in your life. Anything related to ending the Ten-Day War from its summit, or the JNA trying to renege on the ceasefire by cutting the phone lines to Ljubljana is, of course, totally made up by me. The Brijuni Agreement formally ending the war, however, is real.\n\nBattle Eighteen, RAM: The RAM plan, as depicted in Tito’s Lost Children, is semi-real. It is known that something called RAM existed, but the content has never been revealed. While the specific contents of it in the book are speculative, it is however, known that the Serb leadership did premeditate much of the ethnic-cleansing, especially in Bosnia. The base Jovana is training on is fictional, though the Slovene Territorial Defense Force did have a training facility near Ljubljana. President Tudjman, who Janez mentions, is historical and we will meet a fictional personage of him in War Two: Croatia.\n\nTito’s Lost Children War One: Slovenia is available here.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
