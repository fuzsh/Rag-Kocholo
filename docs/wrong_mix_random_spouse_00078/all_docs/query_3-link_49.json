        "text": "While the research on history revisionism of the Communist era, as well as on the gradual dissolution of Josip Broz Tito’s personality cult along with Yugoslavia’s disintegration in the 1990s has flourished, most of the research assumes that Tito’s image changed in a singular, uniform, and consistent way, along with the new official nationalist agenda of the new post-Yugoslav states. However, the evolution of Tito’s personality cult following his death took place at three distinct levels: 1) the official politics of Communist memory revisionism, usually taking place at the national level (changes in official commemorations, official calendars of public holidays); 2) local government politics (e.g. street renaming, removal or installation of monuments) occurring at the city or municipal level; and 3) grassroots and vernacular memory-making, typically organized by civil society agents (e.g. opposing the appropriation of anti-fascist symbols for nationalist purposes). This chapter examines the ways in which different levels of society – the nation, local municipalities, and civil society – have differently appropriated, rejected, or adapted the ‘official’ dismantling of Tito’s personality cult after 1990. The data collected for this chapter points at the plurality of memory agents operating at different levels of society, with different ideological, political, and personal motivations, and demonstrates that the outcomes of memory-making activities are highly dependent on the local context within which the activities are embedded.\n\nStarting from the thesis that ''history is written by the winners”, ''mainstream'' history can be under¬stood as the revised and politically instrumentalized means of a certain nation's ''cultural'' memory, which some consider to be a ''history of selective memo¬ri¬zation and selective forgetfulness''. Most approaches in con¬temporary Croatian historiography which are focu¬sed on the historical periods of monarchist and socialist Yugoslavia use national-level themes as their starting point. A similar preoccupation is also present in those historiographical approaches which are focused on the problems of analyzing and understanding how collective memories are constructed. However, our aim here is to move from the ''big'' themes to a ''small'' (local) setting. In this context, Samobor, a small Croatian urban centre, is going to serve us as the basis for analyzing in which way two Yugoslav rulers – King Alexander Karađorđević and Marshal Josip Broz Tito – were perceived on the local level. By analyzing the relevant archival sources as well as contemporary periodicals, we seek to un¬der¬stand the ways in which local authorities and elites, from their position of social power and status, received the mentioned rulers during their visits, and in which ways did they honour and commemorate these high-profile guests. Through this analysis, we hope to gain a better understanding of the process of the creation of local social memory, the constitution of memorial and cul¬tural patterns, and their key cultural elements and me¬anings, which are often torn apart during periods of social and political upheaval, only to be reconstituted by recombining the same key cultural and social elements while simultaneously encompassing new actors. In other words, the focus of our analysis will be on tracing the collective memory of the population of Samobor to¬wards two ''great leaders''.
