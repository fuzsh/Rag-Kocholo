The museum complex comprises three buildings with a total surface of 5253 m², set in a 3.2 hectare park:\n\t\n\tMuseum \"May 25th\"\n\tHouse of Flowers\n\tOld Museum\n\t\n\tThe institution goes back to a centre that was established by Josip Broz Tito during his lifetime. Much like the presidential libraries in the United States, Tito's memorial centre was intended as a repository for preserving and making available the papers, records, collections and other historical materials relating to his life and work and the history of Yugoslavia.\n\t\n\tAfter his death on 4 May 1980, Josip Broz Tito was buried in the House of Flowers, set in the museum grounds. The museum has a collection of more than 200.000 items that illustrate the history of Yugoslavia throughout the 20th century, with the special accent on the life and work of Tito himself.\n\t\n\tIt also keeps an extensive collection of the gifts Tito received during his many visits with foreign dignitaries during his presidency. The exhibits further include works of many world-notable artists like Jan Griggier, Claude Joseph Vernet, Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller, including original prints of Los Caprichos by Francisco Goya, Gerbrand van den Eeckhout Giving the Tenth, and many others.\n\t\n\tFor almost a decade after the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the entire complex (the tomb and the museum) was closed to the public and the military guards were permanently removed. The complex is now again a major tourist attraction. Many people visit the place as a shrine to \"better times\", especially on 25 May (Josip Broz Tito's official birth date). The Government of Serbia has planned to merge the museum into the Museum of the History of Serbia. [Wikipedia.org]",
