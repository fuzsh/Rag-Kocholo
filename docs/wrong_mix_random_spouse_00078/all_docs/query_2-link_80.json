The book and film cover the collapse of the former Yugoslavia from three decades ago. Notable in its combination of never-before-seen archive footage interspersed with interviews of most of the main players in the conflict, including Slobodan Milošević, the leader of Serb nationalism, then President of Serbia, through the secession of Slovenia and Croatia, to the war in Bosnia. Film footage does not extend as far as the Kosovo crisis or the secession of Montenegro.
