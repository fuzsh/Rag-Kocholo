        "text": "John Rutledge, born in Charleston, South Carolina on September 17, 1739, is considered to be an American Founding Father. He served as one of the original associate justices of the Supreme Court and the second chief justice of the United States. Additionally, he served as the first president of South Carolina and later as its first governor after the Declaration of Independence was signed.\n\nRutledge went to London to study law, returning after three years to practice in the colonies. Oyez reports that his talent as a public speaker and the prestigious reputation of his family contributed to his early success as an attorney. The British governor appointed him as South Carolina’s attorney general, which added to Rutledge’s influence, both at home and with the British government. He was in favor of reconciliation with Britain up until the British Navy invaded and captured Charleston in 1780.\n\nInitially George Washington considered choosing Rutledge for the first Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, but passed him by for John Jay. Instead, he appointed him as senior associate justice, a role Rutledge began serving on this day in history.\n\nIn 1795, upon hearing word that John Jay was retiring, Rutledge wrote to Washington, offering himself for the position. Washington accepted, and Rutledge served as the interim Chief Justice, pending approval by the Senate. John Jay, meanwhile, was charged with writing a treaty that resolved new tension between the US and England. A copy of the treaty leaked to the papers, and many colonial leaders were outraged at its perceived submissive tone. Rutledge was asked to speak publicly about his opinions on this treaty, and he went so far as to say “dearly as [I] love Washington, [I] would rather see him dead than to see him sign the Treaty.”\n\nThis statement pretty much was the death knell for Rutledge’s approval by the Senate, and his appointment was not confirmed. Upon hearing news of the Senate’s rejection, Rutledge threw himself into the bay. His attempt at suicide failed when two slaves saw him drowning and saved him. He died in July of 1800 and was buried in the graveyard next to the place he gave the speech that ended his career.\n\nFiled under: legal | Tagged: History, SCOTUS | Leave a comment »\n\nThe US Constitution, ratified in 1788, included the Fugitive Slave Clause, which declared that enslaved people who fled to states where slavery was illegal would be returned to their owners.\n\nArticle IV, Section 2, Clause 3:\n\nNo Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.\n\nThe clause did not specify a means of enforcement however, so in 1793, the Fugitive Slave Act, signed by President George Washington (who owned more than 100 slaves) on this day in history, empowered slaveowners to seize runaway slaves, ordered state and federal authorities to help capture and return runaway slaves, and fined those who assisted runaway slaves. Moreover, states had no concurrent power to legislate on the subject. [See Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 41 U.S. 539, 612 (1842), declaring “The [Fugitive Slave] clause manifestly contemplates the existence of a positive, unqualified right on the part of the owner of the slave, which no state law or regulation can in any way qualify, regulate, control or restrain.”]\n\nSlaves continued to try to escape however (odd, since slave owners insisted they were “content”). In fact, when Martha Washington’s favorite seamstress, Ona Judge, ran away, Washington was furious. He contended she “was brought up and treated more like a child than a Servant” and believed she must have been “seduced and enticed away.” (She ran away just before they were about to make a “gift” of her to another family member – one known for cruelty to boot – something I doubt they would have done to a “daughter.”)\n\nIn a letter the President fumed:\n\n“. . . however well disposed I might be to a gradual abolition, or even to an entire emancipation of that description of People (if the latter was in itself practicable at this moment) it would neither be politic or just to reward unfaithfulness with a premature preference; and thereby discontent before hand the minds of all her fellow-servants who by their steady attachments are far more deserving than herself of favor.”\n\nAs the Library of Congress reports:\n\nEnslaved people ran away from bondage so often that slave owners placed some 200,000 ‘runaway slave’ ads in newspapers across the country in the decades before slavery ended following the Civil War.”\n\nSlavery as an institution in the United States finally ended with the ratification of the 13th Amendment on December 6, 1865.\n\nFiled under: legal | Tagged: Black History, George Washington, legal, Slavery | Leave a comment »\n\nOn this day in history, George Washington wrote to his friend the Marquis de Lafayette expressing his views on the merits of the new constitution. He first opines it is “a miracle” that delegates from all the states untied to form a system of national government. He reiterates his “Creed,” which is that the federal government not have more power than is “indispensably necessary” to perform the functions of a good government, and that these powers be distributed among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, lest in “be in danger of degenerating into a monarchy, an oligarchy, an aistocracy, or any other despotic or oppressive form. . . .”\n\nHe explains:\n\nI would not be understood my dear Marquis to speak of consequences which may be produced, in the revolution of ages, by corruption of morals, profligacy of manners, and listlessness for the preservation of the natural and unalienable rights of mankind; nor of the successful usurpations that may be established at such an unpropitious Juncture, upon the ruins of liberty, however providently guarded and secured, as these are contingencies against which no human prudence can iffectually provide. It will at least be a recommendation to the proposed Constitution that it is provided with more checks and barriers against the introduction of Tyranny, & those of a nature less liable to be surmounted, than any Government hitherto instituted among mortals, hath possessed.”\n\nYou can read the entire letter here.\n\nFiled under: legal | Tagged: George Washington, History | Leave a comment »\n\nJames Danforth Quayle, known as Dan, was born in Indiana on this day in history. According to the UVA Miller Center, both of Quayle’s parents were politically active conservatives who participated in Republican Party politics and instilled strong conservative values in their son. Quayle graduated from the Indiana University-Indianapolis Law School in 1974, and with his wife Marilyn, practiced law in Huntington, Indiana before his election to the US House of Representatives in 1976. In 1980, he was elected to the US Senate.\n\nIn 1988, vice president and Republican presidential nominee George H. W. Bush chose Quayle as his running mate.\n\nJules Witcover, in The American Vice Presidency, reports that “the senior George Bush’s choice of the youthful Quayle was widely regarded as a blatantly political one, based on providing some sex appeal and charisma to the bland Bush image rather than any experience or intellectual heft Quayle would bring to the Republican ticket.”\n\nThe Bush–Quayle ticket defeated the Democratic ticket of Michael Dukakis and Bentsen, and Quayle became vice president in January, 1989. During his tenure, Quayle chaired the National Space Council and the Council on Competitiveness, where, Witcover charges, “he could carry the conservative flag against troublesome environmental regulations.” For his work in helping to alter federal rules in ways more favorable to business, but less salubrious for the earth, he gained high marks from conservatives, along with sharp criticism from those interested in protecting labor and environmental rights.\n\nHe also undertook ceremonial duties abroad, making official visits to 47 countries.\n\nAs vice president, he developed a reputation for making gaffes, such as calling Pago Pago in American Samoa, “Pogo Pogo.” In discussing the United Negro Fund, which at that time had the slogan, “A mind is a terrible thing to waste,” Quayle made the unfortunate reformulation, “What a waste it is to lose one’s mind, or not to have a mind, is very wasteful. How true that is.” (You can see more of his notorious quotes here.)\n\nQuayle secured re-nomination for vice president in 1992, but Democrat Bill Clinton and his running mate Al Gore defeated the Bush–Quayle ticket. Quayle retired to private life after the defeat.\n\nBut Quayle made perhaps his most important contribution to the political fate of the Republic in 2021, when he was consulted by his fellow Indianan and Trump’s Vice President Mike Pence. Trump wanted Pence to help him overturn the 2020 election. Robert Costa and Bob Woodward, in their well-researched book, Peril about the end of the Trump Presidency, reported that Pence called Quayle in late December 2021 to ask if there was any way he could give Trump want he wanted.\n\nQuayle was adamant, according to the authors. “Mike, you have no flexibility on this. None. Zero. Forget it. Put it away,” he said.\n\nBut Pence pressed him, the authors wrote, asking if there were any grounds to pause the certification because of ongoing legal challenges. Quayle was unmoved, and Pence ultimately agreed, according to the book.\n\nFiled under: legal | Tagged: History | Leave a comment »\n\nHarvard’s first Black graduate, Richard T. Greener, went on to become the first Black professor at the University of South Carolina and dean of the Howard University School of Law.\n\nGreener was born in Philadephia on this day in history, moving with his family to Cambridge, Massachusetts at age nine. He dropped out of school at age 11 to help support the family, after his father went to seek fortune in the California Gold Rush and never returned.\n\nThe odd jobs he did in Cambridge enabled him to establish friendships with Harvard-connected elites, including Judge Thomas Russell, who made his personal library available to Greener. As a Harvard history reports, Greener also went on boating excursions along the Charles River with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.\n\nSeveral years later, Greener’s employer, a jeweler named Augustus Batchelder, funded his education at Ohio’s Oberlin Academy and later the prestigious Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, all to prepare him for admission to Harvard. Batchelder, the Harvard history of Greener reports, “was itching to see the educational experiment of a black student succeeding at Andover carried on to Harvard.”\n\nGreener was admitted to Harvard at age 21 in 1865. As the only Black at Harvard, he lived an isolated existence, later recalling that “white students spread rumors about him, including ‘that I had escaped from slavery with innumerable difficulties; that I came direct from the cotton field to college; that I was a scout in the Union army; the son of a Rebel general, etc.’”\n\nYet Greener persisted. He performed well academically and was involved in extracurricular activities. He won the Bowdoin Prize for a thesis on Irish land tenure. He graduated in 1870 with honors.\n\nHe began his professional career as a teacher and principal at the Institute for Colored Youth in Philadelphia (now the historically Black Cheyney University of Pennsylvania) and principal at Sumner High School in Washington, D.C. In 1873, he became the first Black professor and the youngest faculty member at South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina), where he taught metaphysics, Latin, Greek, and constitutional history.\n\n[The desegregation in South Carolina was only temporary, however, and when Union troops withdrew in 1877 the school closed, reopening in 1880 for whites only. The troop withdrawal was the result of the Compromise of 1877, an informal agreement by which Southern Democrats agreed not to block the election of Republican Rutherford Hayes as US President on the condition that Republicans withdraw all federal troops from the South, thus consolidating Democratic control over the region. This effectively brought an end to the Reconstruction Era and enabled Jim Crow laws to be put into place throughout the South.]\n\nGreener then turned to law, opening a practice in Washington, D.C., and teaching at Howard University’s law school, where he was appointed dean in 1879.\n\nThe MassMoments history site reports that Greener left Howard in 1881 to open a private law practice and soon became known for defending victims of injustice and discrimination.\n\nAs Harvard reports, in 1883, Greener engaged in public debate with Frederick Douglass over the future of Black leadership and politics. Greener was opposed to strategies that relied upon political parties and white allies, while Douglass urged young Black activists to work within the system. “The two men, both brilliant and passionate, became fierce opponents.”\n\nIn 1898, Greener became the first African American diplomat to represent the United States in a white majority country when he was appointed to a post in Russia, leaving his wife and children behind. He was also appointed to diplomatic positions in India and China. When he returned to the United States, Greener took up a quiet life, settling on the South Side of Chicago with relatives and working as an insurance agent, practicing law, and giving lectures. He died in 1922 at age 78.\n\nFiled under: legal | Tagged: Black History | Leave a comment »\n\nOn this day history, Lincoln, only 28, gave his first major political speech, entitled “The Perpetuation of Our Political Institutions.” In this address before the Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield, Lincoln said that the greatest threats to American democracy came from within.\n\nAs summarized by David S. Reynolds, Lincoln characterized these threats thusly:\n\nOne was what he called “mobocracy” — that is, uncontrolled mobs who willfully violated the law to make a political point.\n\nEspecially shameful, Lincoln said, were white mobs who went on racist rampages, destroying property and hurting people.\n\nIn the speech, he also targeted another potential danger: the assumption to the presidency of a demagogue who was interested solely in his own power, not in the sanctity of the Constitution.”\n\nLincoln could have been anticipating the January 6, 2021 insurrection, fueled by the increasingly violent tenor of the MAGA movement. He said:\n\nI hope I am over wary; but if I am not, there is, even now, something of ill-omen amongst us. I mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country; the growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions, in lieu of the sober judgement of Courts; and the worse than savage mobs, for the executive ministers of justice. This disposition is awfully fearful in any community; and that it now exists in ours, though grating to our feelings to admit, it would be a violation of truth, and an insult to our intelligence, to deny. Accounts of outrages committed by mobs, form the every-day news of the times. They have pervaded the country, from New England to Louisiana; — they are neither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former, nor the burning suns of the latter; — they are not the creature of climate — neither are they confined to the slaveholding, or the non-slaveholding States. Alike, they spring up among the pleasure hunting masters of Southern slaves, and the order loving citizens of the land of steady habits. Whatever then, their cause may be, it is common to the whole country.”\n\nYou can read the entire speech here.\n\nFiled under: legal, Lincoln | Tagged: History, Lincoln | Leave a comment »\n\nAbraham Joshua Heschel (1907-1972) was an American rabbi who was able to get out of Poland and move to New York City six weeks before the Nazis invaded; most of the rest of his family were killed in the Holocaust.\n\nHeschel became one of the leading Jewish theologians of the 20th century and a leader in the civil rights movement. As the Martin Luther King, Jr. Institute at Stanford University recounts:\n\nConsidered “one of the truly great men” of his day and a “great prophet” by Martin Luther King, Jr., Heschel articulated to many Jewish Americans and African Americans the notion that they had a responsibility for each other’s liberation and for the plight of all suffering fellow humans around the world (“Conversation with Martin Luther King,” Conservative Judaism 22, no. 3 (Spring 1968): 1-19, p. 2.)”\n\nHeschel first met Martin Luther King, Jr. on this day in history, when they were both speaking at the National Conference on Religion and Race in Chicago. Heschel maintained that Americans had the chance to find redemption through their efforts to combat racism: “Seen in the light of our religious tradition, the Negro problem is God’s gift to America, the test of our integrity, a magnificent spiritual opportunity.”\n\nHe exhorted:\n\nLet us dodge no issues. Let us yield no inch to bigotry, let us make no compromise with callousness.\n\nReligion and race. How can the two be uttered together? To act in the spirit of religion is to unite what lies apart, to remember that humanity as a whole is God’s beloved child. To act in the spirit of race is to sunder, to slash, to dismember the flesh of living humanity. Is this the way to honor a father: to torture his child? How can we hear the word “race” and feel no self reproach?\n\nFew of us seem to realize how insidious, how radical, how universal an evil racism is. Few of us realize that racism is man’s gravest threat to man, the maximum of hatred for a minimum of reason, the maximum of cruelty for a minimum of thinking.\n\nThe redeeming quality of man lies in his ability to sense his kinship with all men. Yet there is a deadly poison that inflames the eye, making us see the generality of race but not the uniqueness of the human face. Pigmentation is what counts. The Negro is a stranger to many souls. There are people in our country whose moral sensitivity suffers a blackout when confronted with the black man’s predicament.\n\nHow many disasters do we have to go through in order to realize that all of humanity has a stake in the liberty of one person; whenever one person is offended, we are all hurt. What begins as inequality of some inevitably ends as inequality of all.”\n\nThe entire speech is worth reading. You can access it here.\n\nFiled under: legal | Tagged: Civil Rights, History | Leave a comment »\n\nWhen Lincoln was elected US President on November 6, 1860, white Southern slave holders panicked. What if they had to give up slaves, so that they themselves might have to actually work in the fields, or pay actual wages for someone else to? What if their wives had to slave [sic] in the kitchen? Worst of all, what if they lost access to the ability to rape Black women with impunity whenever they wanted to?\n\nThe result was the secession of Southern states. South Carolina was the first to leave the Union, followed closely by Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas.\n\nIn January, 1861, delegates assembled in Montgomery to determine Alabama’s future in the United States. On January 7 they adopted a new state constitution which codified secession, transferred all federal property in Alabama to the new Confederate government, and forbade the emancipation of enslaved people.\n\nYou can read the text here. One might assess that in the section entitled “Slavery,” Section 2 is totally at odds with the entire idea of slavery. But in any event:\n\nSLAVERY\n\nSection 1. No slave in this State shall be emancipated by any act done to take effect in this State, or any other country.\n\nSection 2. The humane treatment of slaves shall be secured by law.\n\nSection 3. Laws may be enacted to prohibit the introduction into this State, of slaves who have committed high crimes in other States or territories, and to regulate or prevent the introduction of slaves into this State as merchandise.\n\nSection 4. In the prosecution of slaves for crimes, of a higher grade than petit larceny, the General Assembly shall have no power to deprive them of an impartial trial by a petit jury.\n\nSection 5. Any person who shall maliciously dismember or deprive a slave of life, shall suffer such punishment as would be inflicted in case the like offense had been committed on a free white person, and on the like proof, except in case of insurrection of such slave.\n\nThen, on this day in history, January 11, delegates adopted an ordinance that withdrew Alabama from the Union and invited the fourteen other slaveholding states to discuss forming a new southern confederacy.\n\nAccording to the ordinance, the election of Lincoln and his running mate, Hannibal Hamlin, was “a political wrong of so insulting and menacing a character as to justify the people of the state of Alabama in the adoption of prompt and decided measures for their future peace and security.”\n\nThe text of the Ordinance of Secession is here.\n\nFiled under: legal | Tagged: Alabama, Slavery | Leave a comment »"
