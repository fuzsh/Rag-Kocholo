        "text": "On July 13, 2024, former U.S. President Donald Trump was speaking near Butler, Pennsylvania, when Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old, fired eight rounds from an AR-15–style rifle at the rally.\n\nThe attack resulted in Trump sustaining injuries, while two audience members were also injured, and Corey Comperatore lost his life. Trump received medical attention for his injuries and later issued a statement expressing gratitude to his supporters and condemning the act.\n\nThis event recalls historical figures who survived assassination attempts, as highlighted by WatchMojo.com in their list of top 10 historical figures who survived the most assassination attempts. The following list is arranged in chronological order:\n\n1: Alexander II of Russia\n\nDuring his reign, Emperor Alexander II survived several assassination attempts due to his reforms, such as emancipating Russian serfs. Despite surviving multiple attempts, he was ultimately killed by a bomb from revolutionaries in 1881.\n\n2: Queen Victoria\n\nQueen Victoria faced around eight assassination attempts during her reign, often while traveling in horse-drawn carriages. Despite these numerous threats, she survived each attempt and ruled for over 63 years.\n\n3: Abraham Lincoln\n\nBefore his assassination by John Wilkes Booth in 1865, Abraham Lincoln survived at least five assassination plots. These included schemes ranging from knife attacks to poisoning, and shooting attempts.\n\n4: Josip Broz Tito\n\nJosip Broz Tito, the Yugoslavian leader, defied death many times, particularly during WWII. Post-war, his refusal to submit to Soviet control led to multiple assassination attempts by Joseph Stalin. Tito even sent a letter to Stalin, warning him to stop the attempts, which ceased after Stalin's death in 1953.\n\n5: Charles de Gaulle\n\nCharles de Gaulle, French President and WWII leader, survived numerous attempts on his life, particularly from the Organisation armée secrète (OAS). His survival of an attack in 1962 is one of the most famous incidents.\n\n6: Adolf Hitler\n\nAdolf Hitler survived numerous assassination attempts, the most notable being the 20 July plot in 1944. Despite the efforts of many, including his own countrymen, Hitler evaded death until his suicide in 1945.\n\n7: Yasser Arafat\n\nYasser Arafat, a leader with many enemies, faced numerous assassination attempts. His roles made him a target, yet he survived significant attempts on his life, including a bombing by Israeli fighter planes in 1985. Arafat claimed to have avoided assassins by never sleeping in the same place two consecutive nights.\n\n8: Zog I of Albania\n\nKing Zog I of Albania survived 55 assassination attempts during his rule. His resilience in the face of such frequent threats is notable in history.\n\n9: Pope John Paul II\n\nPope John Paul II survived several assassination attempts, including a critical shooting in 1981. Despite the severity of these attempts, he forgave his attackers and continued his papacy.\n\n10: Fidel Castro\n\nFidel Castro tops the list with an estimated 638 assassination attempts against him. The CIA tried numerous methods, but Castro survived each one, living to the age of 90."
