        "text": "Supporters of late Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito held small gatherings on May 4 to mark the 40th anniversary of his death.\n\nThe former strongman has a mixed legacy in the former Yugoslavia, where many see him as a brutal dictator who stifled dissent and jailed political opponents, while others see his rule as a period of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic prevented mass gatherings, but small groups paid tribute at sites in countries that emerged from Yugoslavia's bloody collapse.\n\nDozens of people donning face masks visited Tito's marble grave in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, far fewer than the hundreds who usually mark his death annually at the site.\n\nIn the Croatian village of Kumrovec, where Tito was born, a siren wailed at the exact time of his passing.\n\nSeveral dozen people joined a ceremony to lay flowers in front of a statue that stands outside his former family home in the village.\n\nIn the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, a group gathered at the same hour to sound a siren and hold a moment of silence before a statue of Tito.\n\nTito, who died at the age of 87, was both revered and feared as the leader of Yugoslavia, a country that unraveled without his unifying presence.\n\nBorn to Croatian and Slovene parents, he was admired for driving out Nazi German forces during World War II with his partisan fighters.\n\nHe later brought relative prosperity to Yugoslavia and successfully balanced it between the Soviet Union and the West during the Cold War.\n\nBut he also jailed political dissidents, enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, and was criticized for encouraging a personality cult.\n\nIn the years after his death, the centralized control Tito exercised devolved along ethnic lines, culminating with the violent conflicts that saw first Slovenia, then Croatia, and subsequently Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Kosovo break away to become their own states.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters and AFP\n\nNearly three dozen opposition lawmakers in Georgia said on July 22 that they have taken steps to challenge the recently passed controversial law on \"foreign agents\" that has jeopardized the country's aspirations to join the European Union.\n\nThe opposition lawmakers said they signed a lawsuit to challenge the legislation, a necessary step before it can be submitted to the Constitutional Court.\n\nThe \"foreign agent\" law, analogous to one passed a decade ago in Russia, was pushed through parliament by the ruling Georgian Dream party and adopted in May-June despite a presidential veto and weeks of protests.\n\nThe only opposition party represented in the parliament, Girchi, refused to join other opposition lawmakers in the move, saying the Constitutional Court is not independent and there is no sense to appeal the unpopular law with it.\n\nThe law's fierce critic, President Salome Zurabishvili, appealed the controversial legislation with the Constitutional Court on July 16.\n\nIn May, several nongovernmental organizations in Georgia also said they will challenge the law in question with the Constitutional Court and lodge a complaint at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).\n\nThe Georgian Dream-dominated parliament overrode Zurabishvili's veto with an 84-4 vote in the 150-seat parliament on May 28.\n\nOn June 4, the speaker of parliament, Georgian Dream member Shalva Papuashvili, signed the bill into law.\n\nOn June 24, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the European Union will downgrade political contacts with Georgia and consider freezing financial aid to the Tbilisi government after it pushed the law through.\n\n\"If the government does not change the course of action, Georgia will not progress on the European Union path,\" Borrell said.\n\nHe also said the EU would reconsider its support for Georgia through a military aid fund, the European Peace Facility.\n\nCritics say the legislation was introduced by Georgian Dream, founded by Russian-friendly Georgian tycoon Bidzina Ivanishvili, in order to cement the party's grip on power ahead of elections later this year seen as crucial for Georgia's Euro-Atlantic aspirations.\n\nThe law requires civil-society and media organizations that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from foreign sources to submit to oversight that could encompass sanctions for as-yet-undefined criminal offenses.\n\nBoth the United States and the European Union have warned Georgian Dream that ignoring criticism and cracking down violently on protesters will have negative consequences.\n\nGeorgia obtained the coveted EU candidate status in December, but it has yet to start actual accession talks, which could last for years.\n\nGeorgian Dream has insisted it remains committed to joining Western institutions and the law was only meant to increase transparency on NGO funding.\n\nBut Western governments and organizations have issued stark statements, warning the Georgian Dream government that the Tbilisi's EU path will be blocked if the law comes into force.\n\nWith reporting by Civil.ge, Apsny.ge, and Interpressnews.ge\n\nA Russian court has sentenced Alsu Kurmasheva, a veteran RFE/RL journalist who holds dual U.S.-Russian citizenship, to 6 1/2 years in prison on charges she, her employer, the U.S. government, and her supporters reject as politically motivated.\n\nThe court convicted Kurmasheva on a charge of spreading falsehoods about the Russian military.\n\nThe AP, which first reported the news, cited court records and officials as confirming the conviction was handed down on July 19 after the court held a secret trial in the city of Kazan.\n\nRFE/RL President and CEO Stephen Capus called the trial and conviction \"a mockery of justice,\" adding that \"the only just outcome is for Alsu to be immediately released from prison by her Russian captors.\"\n\n\"It's beyond time for this American citizen, our dear colleague, to be reunited with her loving family,\" Capus said in a statement.\n\nKurmasheva, 47, was arrested in Kazan in October and charged with failing to register as a \"foreign agent\" under a punitive Russian law that targets journalists, civil society activists, and others. She has also been charged with spreading falsehoods about the Russian military and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\nRFE/RL and the U.S. government say the charges are reprisals for her work as a journalist for the broadcaster in Prague.\n\nThe July 19 verdict came the same day that Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was found guilty of espionage charges -- which he, his employer, and the U.S. government have rejected as politically motivated -- by a court in the city of Yekaterinberg.\n\nA White House statement on July 19 said Gershkovich was targeted by the Russian government because he is a journalist and an American.\n\nUnlike Gershkovich and another American, Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16-year sentence also on espionage charges, Kurmasheva has not been designated by the U.S. government as \"wrongfully detained.\"\n\nSuch a designation ensures that the case is assigned to the office of the special envoy for hostage affairs in the U.S. State Department, raising the political profile of the prisoner's situation and allowing the U.S. administration to allocate more resources to securing their release.\n\nThe U.S. National Press Club -- a professional association of American journalists -- and 18 other media freedom groups called on President Joe Biden in an open letter on May 31 to press for the recognition of Kurmasheva as a \"wrongfully detained\" person.\n\n\"She meets all the criteria.

He supported our country during the most dramatic moment in history, assisted us in preventing Putin from occupying our country, and has continued to support us throughout this terrible war.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who is vying for reelection as the Republican Party's candidate, has repeatedly said that if he was elected president again, he would end the war Russia launched against Ukraine.\n\nTrump repeated the pledge on July 19 in a phone call with Zelenskiy that both men described as good.\n\nHarris has strengthened her international profile during her three years in office and represented the United States at Ukraine's peace summit in Switzerland last month.\n\nIn his statement, Zelenskiy voiced hope that Washington would remain at the helm of the Western allies' support for Ukraine's response to Russia's aggression and would not abandon Ukraine.\n\n\"The current situation in Ukraine and all of Europe is no less challenging, and we sincerely hope that America's continued strong leadership will prevent Russian evil from succeeding or making its aggression pay off,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nA large Russian oil refinery in southern Russia sustained damage after it was set on fire early on July 22, regional officials said, as the Defense Ministry in Moscow said that it repelled a large Ukrainian drone attack targeting several regions.\n\nSergei Boyko, the governor of Russia's southern Krasnodar region, said on Telegram that debris from a drone that had been shot down sparked a fire at the oil refinery in Tuapse, Russia's only oil-processing installation on the shore of the Black Sea, which belongs to the Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nBoyko said the fire was eventually contained and that there were no casualties. The extent of the damage was not immediately clear.\n\nUkraine, whose energy infrastructure has been decimated by relentless Russian missile and drone strikes, has increasingly targeted in recent months oil facilities inside Russia that work for the military.\n\nTuapse, one of Russia's oldest refineries, has been targeted by Ukrainian drones in the past, the most recent attack reportedly occurring in May.\n\nThe refinery has a daily processing capacity of 240,000 barrels and produces naphtha, fuel oil, vacuum gasoil, and high-sulphur diesel. It exports a large part of its production to countries such as Turkey and China.\n\nUkraine has not officially commented on the strike, but a source in the Ukrainian defense sector told AFP that drones linked to the Defense Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR) were behind the refinery attack.\n\nMeanwhile, the governor of Russia's southern Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a tractor driver was killed and his wife was wounded in a Ukrainian drone attack.\n\nThe claim could not be independently verified immediately.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said earlier that its air defenses on July 22 shot down 47 Ukrainian drones over five regions and off the Black Sea and Sea of Azov coasts.\n\nThe ministry said most of the drones were downed over the Rostov, Belgorod, Voronezh, Smolensk, and Krasnodar regions, while 17 were destroyed over the sea.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine's air force said its air defenses shot down 16 Russian drones in the south and east of the country.\n\nRegional officials also reported that 10 people were wounded by Russian shelling in Ukraine's southern region of Kherson and two women sustained injuries as a result of Russian bombardment in the northeastern region of Kharkiv.\n\nWASHINGTON -- With just over 100 days left before U.S. voters cast their ballots in a presidential election, U.S. President Joe Biden dropped his bid for reelection and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's nominee amid an erosion of support over concerns about his fitness to run because of his age.\n\nBiden had been under pressure for weeks since a horrendous performance at a debate with his rival, Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nThe 81-year-old appeared frail and confused at times during the June 27 debate, raising questions about his physical and mental state.\n\nThe president did not give a reason for withdrawing his candidacy, but he immediately endorsed Harris, to be the party’s candidate, which she vowed to \"earn and win\" as the August 19-21 Democratic National Convention approaches.\n\n\"I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as president for the remainder of my term,\" Biden, who is recovering at home in Delaware from COVID-19, said, adding he was acting in the \"best interest of my party and the country.\"\n\nMany Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, immediately backed Harris to become the Democratic Party's candidate, though it remained unclear whether she would face a challenge to top the election ticket.\n\nThe chair of the Democratic National Committee, Jaime Harrison, said the party would comment soon on the path forward for the nomination process after Biden became the first incumbent U.S. president to give up his party's nomination in more than five decades.\n\n\"The bottom line is that it's going to be very hard to dislodge her [Harris] from the top spot for all kinds of reasons,\" Matthew Dallek, historian and political science professor at George Washington University, told RFE/RL.\n\n\"She got Biden's endorsement. She can have access to the campaign infrastructure and the campaign dollars. She's been vice president for four years. There's not a whole lot of time. It would be very hard for the Democratic Party, I think, to replace the first African American woman vice president at the top of the ticket with a white man.\"\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:03:27 0:00\n\nAdding to the situation's urgency, Democrats say too much is at stake -- including democracy itself -- to lose the election.\n\nThroughout his nearly decade-long political career, Trump has praised authoritarian leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Tayyip Recep Erdogan, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\n\nDuring his term in office from 2017-2021, Trump undermined NATO unity, tilted the Supreme Court to the right of the political spectrum, and sought to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nBiden beat Trump in 2020, narrowly edging him out in the key swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.\n\nHowever, polls showed Trump, 78, expanding his lead over Biden, including in some of those key states, especially after the Republican nominee survived an assassination attempt during a campaign rally on July 13 in Pennsylvania.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:43 0:00\n\n\"Biden was really fighting two wars at the same time, one against Donald Trump and the Republican Party, and then one against his own party, the Democrats. I think that that was just too much to keep an election campaign going heading into a general election,\" Thomas Gift, associate professor of political science at University College London, told RFE/RL.\n\nRepublican leaders immediately attacked Harris over the Biden administration's policies, with some saying that if Biden was not fit enough to run for president, he should step down from the position, a move analysts said was unlikely to happen.\n\n\"There's been a lot of evidence, I think, that Biden is really diminished as a campaigner. But in terms of his ability to govern and to make decisions, and to make informed decisions, I don't think we've seen that,\" Dallek said.\n\nIf chosen as the Democratic candidate, Harris, a 59-year-old former prosecutor and California senator, would become the first black woman to run at the top of the election ticket for a major party in the country's history.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:04:44 0:00\n\nHarris oversaw several key issues in the administration, including immigration, voting rights, and reproductive rights. She also strengthened her international profile during her three years in office, making more than a dozen trips abroad and meeting about 150 leaders.\n\nHarris also represented the United States at Ukraine's peace summit in Switzerland last month.\n\nOther names commonly floated as potential contenders for the Democratic nomination have included governors Gavin Newsom of California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois.\n\nHarris shares a similar disapproval rating as Biden. However, experts say she is still not well-known to many Americans and can improve her image as she campaigns around the country.\n\nBiden's backing of Harris gives her a clear path to the nomination, likely avoiding an intraparty brawl, Gift says.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:04:36 0:00\n\n\"These last few weeks have been bad enough for Democrats. The last thing they needed was a really bruising convention. So I think that it made sense for Biden to go ahead and endorse Harris,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats also risk alienating black voters, a key part of their base, if they pass up on Harris, analysts say.\n\n\"He has done one of the most difficult things for any political leader, and has done so in the national interest,\" presidential historian Michael Beschloss said in a post on X.\n\nBiden's announcement means his political career of more than half a century will finally come to an end in January 2025 when his successor is inaugurated.\n\nIn 1972, at the age of 29, Biden won the Delaware Senate race. He held that seat for the next 36 years, serving as chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He ran for the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008, losing both times.\n\nObama, considered a novice in foreign affairs, tapped Biden to be his running mate in 2008. Biden served as vice president for the next eight years, overseeing White House policy on Ukraine and making several trips to Kyiv.\n\nLike most vice presidents, Biden wanted to run for the nation's top office in 2016 but was encouraged to make way for former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, something he is reportedly still bitter about. She was beaten by Trump in one of the biggest upsets in presidential history.\n\nIn his third bid for the presidency in 2020, Biden beat incumbent Trump in a close race, becoming the oldest person to hold the top office. He immediately sought to rebuild relations with European allies damaged under his predecessor.\n\nWith Biden bowing out before officially becoming his party's nominee, Trump, 78, is now officially the oldest presidential nominee in U.S. history.\n\nIn what is likely to be one of his enduring legacies as president, he was able to quickly unite those allies to support Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in military and financial aid when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022."
