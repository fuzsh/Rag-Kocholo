The rule is part of the agency’s ongoing efforts to implement the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. The final rule went into effect January 26, 2016.\n\nFor covered activities, other than those involving sprouts (which have additional requirements and earlier compliance dates):\n\nJanuary 26, 2018: Covered farms for which, on a rolling basis, the average annual monetary value of produce the farm sold during the previous 3-year period is more than $500,000.\n\nJanuary 28, 2019: Covered farms for which, on a rolling basis, the average annual monetary value of produce the farm sold during the previous 3-year period is more than $250,000 but not more than $500,000 (small businesses).\n\nJanuary 27, 2020: Covered farms for which, on a rolling basis, the average annual monetary value of produce the farm sold during the previous 3-year period is more than $25,000 but no more than $250,000 (very small businesses).\n\nCovered activities involving sprouts covered under Subpart M have separate compliance dates and are subject to all the requirements in the Produce Safety rule including specific requirements for sprout operations noted in Subpart M. The compliance dates for sprout operations are as follows:\n\nJanuary 26, 2017: Covered farms for which, on a rolling basis, the average annual monetary value of produce the farm sold during the previous 3-year period is more than $500,000.\n\nJanuary 26, 2018: Covered farms for which, on a rolling basis, the average annual monetary value of produce the farm sold during the previous 3-year period is more than $250,000 but not more than $500,000 (small businesses).\n\nJanuary 28, 2019: Covered farms for which, on a rolling basis, the average annual monetary value of produce the farm sold during the previous 3-year period is more than $25,000 but no more than $250,000 (very small businesses).\n\nFor harvest and post-harvest agricultural water requirements for non-sprout covered produce, the compliance dates are as follows:\n\nJanuary 26, 2022: Covered farms for which, on a rolling basis, the average annual monetary value of produce the farm sold during the previous 3-year period is more than $500,000.\n\nJanuary 26, 2023: Covered farms for which, on a rolling basis, the average annual monetary value of produce the farm sold during the previous 3-year period is more than $250,000 but not more than $500,000 (small businesses).\n\nJanuary 26, 2024: Covered farms for which, on a rolling basis, the average annual monetary value of produce the farm sold during the previous 3-year period is more than $25,000 but no more than $250,000 (very small businesses).\n\n(See the webpage, “Requirements for Harvest and Post-Harvest Agricultural Water in Subpart E for Covered Produce Other than Sprouts” for information related to end dates for FDA’s intended enforcement discretion for these requirements)\n\nFor pre-harvest agricultural water requirements for non-sprout covered produce, the compliance dates are as follows:\n\nApril 7, 2025: Covered farms for which, on a rolling basis, the average annual monetary value of produce the farm sold during the previous 3-year period is more than $500,000.\n\nApril 6, 2026: Covered farms for which, on a rolling basis, the average annual monetary value of produce the farm sold during the previous 3-year period is more than $250,000 but not more than $500,000 (small businesses).\n\nApril 5, 2027: Covered farms for which, on a rolling basis, the average annual monetary value of produce the farm sold during the previous 3-year period is more than $25,000 but no more than $250,000 (very small businesses).\n\nAdditional compliance dates for farms eligible for certain exemptions can be found on the FDA’s FSMA Compliance Dates web page.\n\nThe definition of “farm” and related terms were revised in the final Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food rule (PC Human Food), and the same definitions of those terms are used in this rule to establish produce safety standards. Operations whose only activities are within the farm definition are not required to register with FDA as food facilities and thus are not subject to the preventive controls regulations. However, on January 4, 2018, FDA announced its intention to initiate rulemaking that could change the way the requirements in both the PC Human Food and PC Animal Food rules apply to certain facilities that conduct activities similar to those that occur on farms. The FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for the requirements in the PC rules for these specific entities and activities until the completion of future rulemaking related to farm activities. For more information see: Enforcement Discretion for Certain FSMA Provisions fact sheet.\n\nFor operations that meet the farm definition, exemptions and modified requirements for the Produce Safety rule are explained in “Exemptions and Variances” and in the Coverage and Exemptions/Exclusions flowchart (PDF - 95KB).\n\n1. Agricultural Water\n\nSee Requirements for Harvest and Post-Harvest Agricultural Water in Subpart E\n\nSee FSMA Final Rule on Pre-harvest agricultural water requirements\n\n2. Biological Soil Amendments\n\nRaw Manure: The FDA is conducting a risk assessment and extensive research on the number of days needed between the applications of raw manure as a soil amendment and harvesting to minimize the risk of contamination. (A soil amendment is a material, including manure, that is intentionally added to the soil to improve its chemical or physical condition for growing plants or to improve its capacity to hold water.)\n\nAt this time, the FDA does not object to farmers complying with the USDA’s National Organic Program standards, which call for a 120-day interval between the application of raw manure for crops in contact with the soil and 90 days for crops not in contact with the soil. The agency considers adherence to these standards a prudent step toward minimizing the likelihood of contamination while its risk assessment and research is ongoing.\n\nThe final rule requires that untreated biological soil amendments of animal origin, such as raw manure, must be applied in a manner that does not contact covered produce during application and minimizes the potential for contact with covered produce after application.\n\nStabilized Compost: Microbial standards that set limits on detectable amounts of bacteria (including Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., fecal coliforms, and E. coli 0157:H7) have been established for processes used to treat biological soil amendments, including manure. The rule includes two examples of scientifically valid composting methods that meet those standards. Stabilized compost prepared using either of these methods must be applied in a manner that minimizes the potential for contact with produce during and after application.\n\nBiological Soil Amendments of Animal Origin (PDF - 132KB)\n\nSpanish Translation of Biological Soil Amendments of Animal Origin (en español, PDF - 169KB)\n\n3. Sprouts\n\nThe final rule includes new requirements to help prevent the contamination of sprouts, which have been frequently associated with foodborne illness outbreaks. Sprouts are especially vulnerable to dangerous microbes because of the warm, moist and nutrient-rich conditions needed to grow them.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2014, there were 43 outbreaks, 2,405 illnesses, and 171 hospitalizations, and 3 deaths associated with sprouts, including the first documented outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes associated with sprouts in the United States. Requirements specific to sprouts include, for example:\n\nTaking measures to prevent the introduction of dangerous microbes into or onto seeds or beans used for sprouting, in addition to treating seeds or beans that will be used for sprouting (or relying on prior treatment by the seed/bean grower, distributor, or supplier with appropriate documentation).\n\nTesting of spent sprout irrigation water from each production batch of sprouts, or in-process sprouts from each production batch, for certain pathogens. Sprouts cannot be allowed to enter commerce until it is ascertained that these required pathogen test results are negative.\n\nTesting the growing, harvesting, packing and holding environment for the presence of Listeria species or Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nTaking corrective actions if spent sprout irrigation water, sprouts, and/or an environmental sample tests positive.\n\nIn January 2017, FDA issued a draft guidance to help sprout operations comply with the applicable requirements in the Produce Safety rule.\n\nThe first compliance date for the largest sprout operations began on January 26, 2017.\n\n4. Domesticated and Wild Animals\n\nThe rule addresses concerns about the feasibility of compliance for farms that rely on grazing animals (such as livestock) or working animals for various purposes. It establishes the same standards for these animals as it does for intrusion by wild animals (such as deer or feral swine). Farmers are required to take all measures reasonably necessary to identify and not harvest produce that is likely to be contaminated.\n\nAt a minimum, this requires all covered farms to visually examine the growing area and all covered produce to be harvested, regardless of the harvest method used.\n\nIn addition, under certain circumstances the rule requires farms to do additional assessment during the growing season, and if significant evidence of potential contamination by animals is found, to take measures reasonably necessary to assist later during harvest. Such measures might include, for example, placing flags outlining the affected area.\n\nAlthough the final rule does not require establishing waiting periods between grazing and harvest, the FDA encourages farmers to voluntarily consider applying such intervals as appropriate for the farm’s commodities and practices. The agency will consider providing guidance on this practice in the future, as needed.\n\nFarms are not required to exclude animals from outdoor growing areas, destroy animal habitat, or clear borders around growing or drainage areas. Nothing in the rule should be interpreted as requiring or encouraging such actions.\n\n5. Worker Training and Health and Hygiene\n\nRequirements for health and hygiene include:\n\nTaking measures to prevent contamination of produce and food-contact surfaces by ill or infected persons, for example, instructing personnel to notify their supervisors if they may have a health condition that may result in contamination of covered produce or food contact surfaces.\n\nUsing hygienic practices when handling (contacting) covered produce or food-contact surfaces, for example, washing and drying hands thoroughly at certain times such as after using the toilet.\n\nTaking measures to prevent visitors from contaminating covered produce and/or food-contact surfaces, for example, by making toilet and hand-washing facilities accessible to visitors.\n\nFarm workers who handle covered produce and/or food-contact surfaces, and their supervisors, must be trained on certain topics, including the importance of health and hygiene.\n\nFarm workers who handle covered produce and/or food contact surfaces, and their supervisors, are also required to have a combination of training, education and experience necessary to perform their assigned responsibilities. This could include training (such as training provided on the job), in combination with education, or experience (e.g., work experience related to current assigned duties).\n\n6. Equipment, Tools and Buildings\n\nThe rule establishes standards related to equipment, tools and buildings to prevent these sources, and inadequate sanitation, from contaminating produce. This section of the rule covers, for example, greenhouses, germination chambers, and other such structures, as well as toilet and hand-washing facilities.\n\nRequired measures to prevent contamination of covered produce and food contact surfaces include, for example, appropriate storage, maintenance and cleaning of equipment and tools.\n\nThe rule does not apply to:\n\nProduce that is not a raw agricultural commodity (RAC). A raw agricultural commodity is any food in its raw or natural state.\n\nThe following produce commodities that FDA has identified as rarely consumed raw: asparagus; black beans, great Northern beans, kidney beans, lima beans, navy beans, and pinto beans; garden beets (roots and tops) and sugar beets; cashews; sour cherries; chickpeas; cocoa beans; coffee beans; collards; sweet corn; cranberries; dates; dill (seeds and weed); eggplants; figs; ginger; horseradish; hazelnuts; lentils; okra; peanuts; pecans; peppermint; potatoes; pumpkins; winter squash; sweet potatoes; and water chestnuts\n\nFood grains, including barley, dent- or flint-corn, sorghum, oats, rice, rye, wheat, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, and oilseeds (e.g. cotton seed, flax seed, rapeseed, soybean, and sunflower seed)\n\nProduce that is used for personal or on-farm consumption\n\nFarms that have an average annual value of produce sold during the previous three-year period of $25,000 or less\n\nThe rule provides an exemption for produce that receives commercial processing that adequately reduces the presence of microorganisms of public health significance, under certain conditions.\n\nThe rule also provides a qualified exemption and modified requirements for certain farms.\n\nTo be eligible for a qualified exemption, the farm must meet two requirements:\n\nThe farm must have food sales averaging less than $500,000 per year during the previous three years; and\n\nThe farm’s sales to qualified end-users must exceed sales to all others combined during the previous three years. A qualified end-user is either (a) the consumer of the food or (b) a restaurant or retail food establishment that is located in the same state or the same Indian reservation as the farm or not more than 275 miles away.\n\nA farm with the qualified exemption must still meet certain modified requirements, including disclosing the name and the complete business address of the farm where the produce was grown either on the label of the produce or at the point of purchase. These farms are also required to establish and keep certain documentation.\n\nA farm’s qualified exemption may be withdrawn as follows:\n\nIf there is an active investigation of an outbreak of foodborne illness that is directly linked to the farm, or\n\nIf FDA determines it is necessary to protect the public health and prevent or mitigate an outbreak based on conduct or conditions associated with the farm that are material to the safety of the farm’s produce that would be covered by the rule.\n\nBefore FDA issues an order to withdraw a qualified exemption, the agency:\n\nMay consider one or more other actions to protect public health, including a warning letter, recall, administrative detention, refusal of food offered for import, seizure and injunction.\n\nMust notify the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the farm, in writing, of the circumstances that may lead FDA to withdraw the exemption, provide an opportunity for response within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification, and consider actions taken by the farm to address the issues raised by the agency.\n\nA withdrawn exemption may be reinstated if (as applicable):\n\nThe FDA determines that the outbreak was not directly linked to the farm, and/or\n\nThe FDA determines that the problems with conduct or conditions material to the safety of the food produced or harvested at the farm have been adequately resolved, and continued withdrawal of the exemption is not necessary to protect public health or prevent or mitigate an outbreak of foodborne illness.\n\nThe rule also permits states, tribes, or foreign countries from which food is imported into the U.S. to submit a petition, along with supporting information, to FDA requesting a variance(s) from one or more of the requirements of this rule.\n\nThe rule enables a state, tribe, or country, if it concludes that meeting one or more of the rule’s requirements would be problematic in light of local growing conditions, to request variances to those requirements. The state, tribe, or foreign country must demonstrate that the requested variance is reasonably likely to ensure that the produce is not adulterated and provides the same level of public health protection as the corresponding requirement(s) in the rule.\n\nThe final rule makes it clear that federally recognized tribes may submit a variance petition.\n\nThe request for a variance must be submitted by a competent authority, meaning a person or organization that is the regulatory authority for food safety for the state, tribe, or foreign country.\n\nA foreign government does not need to have a systems recognition arrangement or equivalence agreement with the FDA to obtain a variance.\n\nThe variance request must include relevant and scientifically valid information specific to the produce or activity. Information could relate to crops, climate, soil, geography or environment, as well as the practices of that particular region.\n\nExamples of types of variances that may be granted include a variance from the agricultural water microbial quality criteria for water used during growing covered produce (other than sprouts) using a direct water application method, a variance from the microbial die-off rate used to determine the time interval between the last irrigation and harvest and/or the accompanying maximum time interval; and a variance from the approach or frequency for water testing for water uses subject to the rule’s microbial quality criteria.\n\nCompliance dates for modified requirements for farms eligible for a qualified exemption are:\n\nFor labeling requirement (if applicable): January 1, 2020\n\nFor retention of records supporting eligibility for a qualified exemption: Effective date of the final rule\n\nFor all other modified requirements:\n\nVery small businesses, four years after the effective date of the final rule\n\nSmall businesses, three years after the effective date of the final rule\n\nFor more information, see FSMA Compliance Dates.\n\nThe FDA has also released the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which places the Produce Safety rule in the context of its likely impact on the environment, including human health and socioeconomic effects. The Draft EIS was published in January 2015. The FDA considered public comments submitted in the two months that followed in drafting the Final EIS. The FDA considered the findings of the Final EIS in finalizing the produce rule.\n\nThe EIS evaluated actions that FDA proposed in the original and supplemental rules, as well as a number of alternative actions for each of the provisions identified as having the potential to result in significant environmental impacts. The provisions of the final rule represent FDA’s preferred alternatives, which are detailed in a Record of Decision (ROD). The ROD addresses how the EIS findings were incorporated into decisions about the final rule. The agency’s preferred alternatives are those that the FDA believes best fulfill the agency’s statutory mission and responsibility, giving consideration to economic, environmental, technical and other factors.\n\nA significant beneficial impact on public health is expected due to the anticipated decrease in the number of illnesses tied to produce contamination.\n\nAs in the Draft EIS, the Final EIS notes that any produce regulation that causes a farmer to use ground water instead of surface water could exacerbate existing groundwater shortages, although added flexibility in the water provisions make such a management decision unlikely.\n\nThe Final EIS also concludes that Native American farmers may be disproportionately affected by any increases in operating costs necessitated by the produce rule since their average income is 30 percent less than that of other farmers.\n\nRequired Training for Covered Farms (PDF - 175KB)\n\nSpanish Translation of Required Training for Covered Farms (en español, PDF - 151KB)\n\nThe FDA has established the Produce Safety Network to support the efforts of state regulators with implementing the Produce Safety rule and to support the efforts of farmers and other key stakeholders with complying with the Produce Safety rule. The network is comprised of produce safety experts from the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) and specialized investigators from the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA). Farmers, extension agents, state regulators, and other stakeholders that have questions about the rule should contact the network through their regional representative, which can be found in the Produce Safety Network Directory. See also Building the Produce Safety Network.\n\nThe FDA has developed and is developing several guidance documents on subjects that include:\n\nGeneral guidance on implementation and compliance.\n\nA Small Entity Compliance Guide that explains the actions a small or very small business must take to comply with the rule.\n\nA draft guidance for sprout operations\n\nThe FDA is also working with stakeholders to develop and provide training and technical assistance. The efforts underway include:\n\nThe FDA has established the FSMA Food Safety Technical Assistance Network, which serves as a central source of information to support industry understanding and implementation of FSMA.\n\nThe FDA is working with partners to develop training. These partners include:\n\nThe Produce Safety Alliance (PSA);\n\nThe Sprout Safety Alliance (SSA);\n\nThe National Institute of Food and Agriculture in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (to administer a grant program to provide food safety training, education and technical assistance to small and mid-size farms and small food processors, beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged farmers, and small produce merchant wholesalers); and\n\nCooperative agreement partners (to develop training programs for sustainable agriculture and tribal operations).\n\nThe Native American Tribal Center for Food Safety Outreach, Education, Training and Technical Assistance has been established by an agreement with the Indigenous Food and Agriculture Initiative (IFAI) at University of Arkansas School of Law.\n\nThe Local Food Safety Collaborative has been established with National Farmers Union Foundation with the Local Food Safety Collaborative (LFSC).\n\nFDA has entered into a cooperative agreement with National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) to help with the implementation of the produce safety regulations.\n\nThe establishment of the Produce International Partnership for Education and Outreach (PIP), a joint effort by the Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (JIFSAN) and Produce Safety Alliance (PSA) to share food safety training with the international community.\n\nAdditionally, the FDA has established the FSMA Collaborative Training Forum as a space for dialogue, information sharing, alignment, and collaboration on training efforts.\n\nAdditional Information on Raw Manure\n\nSupplier Evaluation Resources\n\nIndustry Resources on Third-Party Audit Standards and FSMA Supplier Verification Requirements\n\nAccredited Third-Party Certification Program Voluntary Audit Templates\n\nFSMA Inflation Adjusted Cut Offs\n\nRarely Consumed Raw Produce (PDF - 157KB)\n\nSpanish Translation of Rarely Consumed Raw Produce (en español, PDF - 155KB)\n\nDropped Covered Produce (PDF - 121KB)\n\nSpanish Translation of Cropped Covered Produce (en español, PDF - 135KB)\n\nDecision Tree for Test Methods Requirements of Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 in Spent Sprout Irrigation Water (or Sprouts) (PDF - 210KB)\n\nDecision Tree for Determining Coverage under Subpart M of the Produce Safety Rule (PDF - 400KB)"
