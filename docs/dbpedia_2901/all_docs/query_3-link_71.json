        "text": "Third Party Risk Management - May 2024\n\nIntroduction\n\nCommunity banks engage with third parties to compete in and respond to an evolving financial services landscape. Third-party relationships can offer community banks access to new technologies, risk-management tools, human capital, delivery channels, products, services, and markets. A community bank's reliance on third parties, however, reduces its direct operational control over activities1 and may introduce new risks or increase existing risks, including, but not limited to, operational, compliance, financial, and strategic risks.\n\nDue to the varied risks associated with third-party relationships, it is important for community banks to appropriately identify, assess, monitor, and control these risks as well as ensure that activities are performed in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.2 These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, those designed to protect consumers (such as fair lending laws and prohibitions against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices) and those addressing financial crimes (such as fraud and money laundering).\n\nEngaging a third party does not diminish or remove a bank's responsibility to operate in a safe and sound manner and to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including consumer protection laws and regulations, just as if the bank were to perform the service or activity itself. A community bank may engage an external party to conduct aspects of its third-party risk management. However, the bank cannot abrogate its responsibility to employ effective risk-management practices, including when using a third party to conduct third-party risk management on behalf of the bank.\n\nAbout This Guide\n\nIn June 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) (collectively, the agencies) issued the Interagency Guidance on Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management (TPRM Guidance).3 The TPRM Guidance includes sound risk-management principles for banking organizations to consider when developing and implementing risk-management practices for all stages in the life cycle of third-party relationships.\n\nThis guide is intended to assist community banks when developing and implementing their third-party risk-management practices. This guide is not a substitute for the TPRM Guidance.4 Rather, it is intended to be a resource for community banks to consider when managing the risk of third-party relationships. This guide is not a checklist and does not prescribe specific risk-management practices or establish any safe harbors for compliance with laws or regulations. While this guide is intended for use by community banks, other banks may find it useful. Some additional resources that can help support a bank's development and implementation of its risk-management program are listed in the appendix to this guide. The agencies underscore that supervisory guidance does not have the force and effect of law and does not impose any new requirements on banks.\n\nGuide Contents\n\nThe guide provides potential considerations, resources, and examples through each stage of the third-party risk-management life cycle and is organized under the following topics:\n\nRisk Management. Discussion on risk considerations.\n\nThird-Party Relationship Life Cycle. The five stages of the life cycle are explained.\n\nGovernance. Considerations for governance related to third-party risk.\n\nAppendix. Additional resources that can help support a bank's development and implementation of its third-party risk-management practices.\n\nExcerpts from the TPRM Guidance are also highlighted within boxes in each section.\n\nRisk Management\n\nNot all third-party relationships present the same level of risk, and therefore not all relationships require the same level of oversight. As part of sound risk management, community banks apply more rigorous risk-management practices throughout the third-party relationship life cycle for third parties that support higher-risk activities, including critical activities. A community bank may adjust and update its third-party risk-management practices commensurate with its size, complexity, and risk profile by periodically analyzing the risks associated with each third-party relationship. It is important to involve bank staff with the requisite knowledge and skills in each stage of the risk-management life cycle.\n\nThis guide includes considerations illustrating how a community bank may apply risk-management practices in different stages of the third-party relationship life cycle. An important initial step is identifying third-party relationships that support higher-risk activities, including critical activities. In determining whether an activity is higher risk, banks may assess various factors, such as if the third party has access to sensitive data (including customer data), processes transactions, or provides essential technology and business services.\n\nThird-Party Relationship Life Cycle\n\nEffective third-party risk management generally follows a continuous life cycle for third-party relationships. The five stages of the life cycle are set forth in figure 1, surrounded by the governance practices of Oversight and Accountability, Independent Reviews, and Documentation and Reporting.\n\nFor every stage, a community bank's level or type of oversight may vary, commensurate with its size, complexity, and risk profile as well as with the nature of the specific third-party relationship.\n\nPlanning\n\nCareful planning enables a community bank to consider potential risks in the proposed third-party relationship. In addition, risk assessments are an important component of managing third-party relationships and help a bank evaluate the extent of risk-management resources and practices for effective oversight of the proposed third-party relationship throughout the subsequent stages of the third-party relationship life cycle.\n\nPotential Considerations\n\nWhat are the underlying activities to be performed, and what are the bank and third party's prospective roles in the activities?\n\nWhat legal and compliance requirements will apply to the prospective third-party activities?\n\nWhat are the benefits of the relationship, and how would the relationship align with the bank's strategic plan?\n\nWhat risk-management and governance practices (including internal controls) will be necessary to manage and mitigate the potential risks?\n\nWhat are the financial implications of entering into and maintaining the business arrangement?\n\nWhat are the direct contractual costs and indirect costs to augment or alter bank staffing, processes, and technology?\n\nDo the expected benefits of the relationship exceed the potential costs and risks?\n\nHow will the bank integrate third-party technology with the bank's existing systems and infrastructure? What changes would need to be made to the bank's technology to ensure compatibility, and what would be the associated risks and costs? Does staff have the requisite skills to manage risks associated with integrating the third party's technology into the bank's environment (if not, how will the bank integrate the technology)?\n\nWhat physical and/or system access would the third party have to bank facilities, systems, and records, and what record-keeping processes would the bank require the third party to implement?\n\nWhat interaction will the third party have with customers, and how would customer complaints be handled?\n\nWhat are the information security implications, and how will the third party access, process, and protect customers' information?\n\nHas the bank considered how to exit the activity or transition the activity to an alternative third party or in-house?\n\nPotential Sources of Information\n\nThe bank's strategic plan to assess the proposed activity's alignment with the bank's risk appetite, policies, and business objectives.\n\nThe bank's budget or cost-benefit analysis to assess the financial considerations of the relationship.\n\nThe bank's human resources staff to assess whether management and staff have the expertise and capacity to manage the relationship.\n\nThe bank's internal policies, processes, and controls to assess the impact to the bank of entering into and managing the proposed relationship.\n\nThe bank's inventory of existing third-party relationships to assess whether an existing relationship could support the new activity.\n\nThe bank's technology infrastructure and staff to assess how readily it could integrate with a third party to support the new activity.\n\nThe perspectives of the bank's subject matter experts, including those in information technology, legal, and compliance risk.\n\nBoard policies, including risk limits, to assess alignment with the proposed third-party relationship.\n\nDue Diligence and Third-Party Selection\n\nDue diligence is the process by which a community bank assesses, before entering into a third-party relationship, a particular third party's ability to perform the activity as expected, adhere to the community bank's policies, comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and conduct the activity in a safe and sound manner. Effective due diligence assists with the selection of capable and reliable third parties to perform activities for, through, or on behalf of the community bank. If the bank cannot obtain desired due diligence information from the third party, the bank may consider alternative information, controls, or monitoring.\n\nPotential Considerations\n\nHas the third party demonstrated financial and operational capability to meet its obligations to the bank? If no, what alternative information is available?\n\nWhat resources and expertise are available at the third party to support the activity?\n\nWhat third-party policies, processes, and internal controls support performance of the service in alignment with the bank's expectations and standards?\n\nHas the third party demonstrated an ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) as well as fair lending and consumer protection laws and regulations (as applicable)?\n\nIs the third party's information security program consistent with the bank's program and expectations related to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information?\n\nDoes the third party demonstrate the ability to effectively operate through and recover from both internal and external operational incidents or disruptions?\n\nHow has the third party performed in the past during periods of economic or financial stress?\n\nDoes the third party rely on subcontractors, and could that reliance pose additional or heightened risk to the bank?\n\nDoes the third party use technologies that could introduce additional risk?\n\nDoes the third party have a robust consumer complaint program? Does it have a history of prompt and satisfactory resolution of consumer complaints?\n\nIs the third party involved in ongoing litigation or other public matters of concern?\n\nCan the third party demonstrate that it has successfully provided the prospective services for other banks or similar clients?\n\nPotential Sources of Information\n\nThe third party's audited financial statements and other financial information to assess the third party's financial condition.\n\nThe third party's licenses and any other legal authority necessary to perform the activity.\n\nThe third party's relevant policies and procedures, including those related to AML/CFT, to assess the effectiveness of its risk-management practices, control environment, and alignment with the bank's expectations and standards and with applicable legal requirements.\n\nIndependent reviews of the effectiveness of those policies and procedures, including AML/CFT.\n\nThe third party's strategic plan or other disclosures to assess whether the business strategy and its agreements with other entities pose new or increased risks.\n\nThe third party's staffing levels and qualifications to assess whether the third party's resources can fulfill its obligations to the bank, including those of principals and other key personnel related to the activity.\n\nThe third party's training program to assess if its employees understand their duties and responsibilities, are knowledgeable about applicable laws and regulations, and have requisite certifications and licenses.\n\nThe volume and nature of consumer complaints against the third party.\n\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list (\"SDN List\") and all other sanctions lists to ensure the third party and its employees, contractors, or grantees are not sanctioned by the U.S. government.\n\nSystem and Organization Controls (SOC) reports, independent assessments, and industry certifications to assess the third party's operational risk management and internal controls.\n\nAudit reports to assess the third party's risk management and internal controls.\n\nReferences and feedback from peer institutions or clients that are currently using the third party's service.\n\nThe third party's current insurance coverage to determine if sufficient for the activity.\n\nDisclosures and information in the media or in any of the third party's publications, including its website, to assess potential risks to the bank.\n\nInternet searches of the third party's company name to determine whether it has been partnered with institutions subject to consent orders related to third-party transactions or conducts business with companies that misrepresent deposit insurance coverage.\n\nContract Negotiation\n\nBefore entering a contractual relationship with a third party, a community bank typically considers contract provisions that meet its business objectives, regulatory obligations, and risk-management policies and procedures. The community bank typically negotiates contract provisions that facilitate effective risk management and oversight, including terms that specify the expectations and obligations of both the community bank and the third party. When a community bank has limited negotiating power, it is important for bank management to understand any resulting limitations and consequent risks. Possible actions that bank management might take in such circumstances include determining whether the contract can still meet the community bank's needs, whether the contract would result in increased risk to the community bank, and whether residual risks are acceptable.\n\nPotential Considerations\n\nTo what extent does the contract specify the parties' responsibilities and cover all aspects of the relationship (including costs, reimbursements, and other liabilities)?\n\nWhat provisions does the bank need to include regarding termination events (for example, default or force majeure), continuity planning, and associated costs and fees?\n\nWhat are the governance and escalation protocols regarding the third party's performance and security measures or benchmarks?\n\nTo what extent does the contract enable the bank to obtain timely information it needs to perform adequate ongoing monitoring, demonstrate compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and respond to regulatory requests? For example, will the bank have access to application and loan data, account opening and customer information, audit reports, suspicious activity monitoring information, and reports to identify safety and soundness and consumer compliance issues?\n\nWhat arrangements will be negotiated for sharing and using information, technology, and intellectual property?\n\nDoes the contract specify limitations on the third party's use and retention of data (including customer data) related to the activity, including its disclosure, storage, delivery to the bank, and destruction?\n\nDoes the contract appropriately address the bank's right to access its data at the third party and the process by which the bank will access its records and data (including customer data)?\n\nWhen and how will the third party notify the bank of a disruption, including degradation or interruptions in delivery, and how will the third party assist the bank with continuation of the activity?\n\nWhen and how will the third party notify the bank of strategic changes, such as mergers and acquisitions and leadership changes?\n\nWhat continuity plans, processes, and controls will the third party maintain to ensure contract adherence, including recovery time and recovery point objectives?\n\nFor higher-risk activities, including critical activities, what are likely scenarios for breach of contract, and has the bank considered the potential exposure and cost?\n\nPotential Sources of Information\n\nThe bank's risk assessment and due diligence findings to determine the provisions to include in the contract.\n\nThe third party's proposed service level agreements to set applicable performance and security metrics.\n\nAssessments from business units regarding their business needs and customer service objectives to determine performance and security measures to include in the contract.\n\nContract provisions outlining the bank's access to the third party's audit, testing, and self-assessment reports for ongoing monitoring.\n\nLegal, compliance, and other stakeholders' perspectives to advise bank management on the contract provisions to appropriately protect the bank's interests.\n\nOngoing Monitoring\n\nA community bank's ongoing monitoring of the third party's performance enables bank management to determine if the third party is performing as required for the duration of the contract. The bank may also use information from ongoing monitoring to adapt and refine its risk-management practices.\n\nPotential Considerations\n\nIs the third party performing its obligations under the contract?\n\nHas the third party's financial condition changed, including declining revenues or increasing debt obligations?\n\nHas the third party complied with applicable laws, regulations, and service level agreements?\n\nDo audit and test results indicate the third party is managing risks and meeting contractual obligations and regulatory requirements effectively?\n\nIs the third party demonstrating an ability to maintain its systems within the bank's availability requirements (e.g., latency, bandwidth, and uptime)?\n\nIs the third party demonstrating reliability throughout its relationship with the bank?\n\nHow do the third party's business continuity and disaster recovery plans and practices demonstrate its capability to respond and recover from service disruptions?\n\nHas the third party maintained the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of customer data (where applicable) and the bank's systems, information, and data?\n\nDo reports from the third party align with the bank's internal reports and observations?\n\nHas the third party's performance changed due to mergers, acquisitions, or divestitures?\n\nHas the bank's reliance on the third party to conduct bank activities changed over the life of the relationship?\n\nFor third parties that interact with customers or access customer data, has the third party responded appropriately to the bank's requests for its records and information?\n\nHave there been changes in the third party's strategy, corporate culture, leadership, or risk exposure? If so, what is the impact on the relationship with the bank?\n\nPotential Sources of Information\n\nService level agreements and standards to assess the third party's performance and to confirm that existing provisions continue to address risks and the bank's expectations.\n\nAudited and other financial reports to confirm the third party's financial condition remains sound and in compliance with contractual requirements.\n\nAudits and reports to confirm the third party's compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nInternal reports to review changes in the bank's risk assessment and supporting risk-management processes.\n\nThe bank and third party's contingency testing results to evaluate the ability to respond to and recover from service disruptions or degradations.\n\nReview and testing of control effectiveness to assess whether the third party's control environment remains sound, including SOC reports and self-assessments to industry standards.\n\nInformation security testing results to assess the third party's ability to maintain the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of customer data (where applicable) and the bank's systems, information, and data.\n\nCustomer complaints to assess the volume and subject matter of complaints and the timeliness and appropriateness of the third party's response to them.\n\nCommunication with the third party to assess changes in key processes.\n\nThe third party's staffing and succession plans and organizational charts to assess changes in the third party's key personnel involved in the activity and to determine whether key personnel have assumed responsibilities that may detract from their ability to perform under the third party's agreement with the bank (e.g., affiliation with other entities).\n\nTraining materials provided to the third party and bank staff for continued education.\n\nPublic filings, news articles, social media, and customer feedback about experiences with the third party.\n\nTermination\n\nA community bank may choose to end its relationship with a third party for a variety of reasons. A bank typically considers the impact of a potential termination during the planning stage of the life cycle. This consideration may help to mitigate costs and disruptions caused by termination, particularly for higher-risk activities, including critical activities.\n\nPotential Considerations\n\nHow will the termination affect the bank's operations and its compliance with applicable laws and regulations? Will any higher-risk activities, including critical activities, be affected?\n\nWhat are the financial implications of terminating the relationship?\n\nWhat alternative third parties are available to which the bank can transition, or can the bank perform the activity in-house?\n\nHow ready are bank staff, systems, and control environments to move the outsourced activity in-house, if needed?\n\nHow will the bank and the third party handle intellectual property?\n\nWhat access to bank systems or information has the third party been granted? How and when will this access be removed?\n\nIf the third party has access to bank or customer data, when and how will the bank confirm that the data has been returned or destroyed?\n\nWill the bank have access to data to meet its AML/CFT requirements and other recordkeeping obligations?\n\nHow will the bank manage risks associated with the termination or migration, including the impact on customers?\n\nWhat additional controls and processes will the bank put in place during the transition?\n\nPotential Sources of Information\n\nThe bank's contract with the third party, to verify how parties may exit the relationship and the conditions under which fees or penalties will be imposed for early termination.\n\nThe bank's budget to assess the impact of costs and fees associated with termination.\n\nAny outlines of steps or resources that the bank had previously developed to support its exit from the activity or to transition the activity to an alternative third party or in-house.\n\nInventory of the bank or customers' data at the third party to support risk management associated with data retention and destruction, information system connections and access control, or other control concerns.\n\nAssessments of the bank's systems, processes, and human resources to determine whether the bank has the capability, resources, and time to transition the activity to another third party or bring the activity in-house with limited disruption to the bank's operations.\n\nThe bank's third-party inventory to assess existing relationships with other third parties to transition the activity to them, if appropriate.\n\nThe bank's considerations for transitioning customer accounts with limited disruption to customers and the bank's operations.\n\nGovernance\n\nCommunity banks typically consider the following governance practices throughout the third-party relationship life cycle: oversight and accountability, independent reviews, and documentation and reporting.\n\nPotential Considerations\n\nHow do the bank's policies and procedures promote effective third-party risk-management governance?\n\nHow do documentation and reporting enable the bank's board of directors to consistently oversee third-party risk management?\n\nHow does the bank's board of directors hold management accountable for third-party risk management?\n\nDo the bank's governance structure and internal control environment effectively promote compliance with bank policies and procedures and applicable laws and regulations?\n\nHas the bank accurately assessed the resources required (including level and expertise of staffing) to manage third-party risks?\n\nDoes the bank effectively document and maintain a current inventory of all third-party relationships that clearly identifies those relationships associated with higher-risk activities, including critical activities?\n\nHas the bank effectively evaluated the accuracy and timeliness of risk and performance reporting?\n\nHas the bank effectively conducted periodic independent reviews of the bank's third-party risk management?\n\nWhen and how does the bank's management inform its board of directors about third-party risks?\n\nPotential Sources of Information\n\nThe bank's strategic plan to verify that the bank's third-party risk-management practices are aligned with its strategic objectives.\n\nApplicable policies and procedures to assess whether they address risks posed by third-party relationships.\n\nThe bank's contingency testing plans to understand how the bank maintains operations during disruptions.\n\nAudit reports to assess the bank's risk management and pertinent internal controls.\n\nThe bank management's periodic reporting to the board of directors on third parties that support higher-risk activities, including critical activities.\n\nDocumentation of the bank's actions to remedy material third-party issues, including performance deterioration.\n\nOther internal reports regarding the bank's third-party relationships.\n\nAppendix\n\nGovernment Resources for Community Banking Organizations' ThirdâParty Risk Management\n\nThese resources are not all inclusive, and other sources of information may be available, particularly on specific topics.\n\nInteragency Guidance on Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management, 88 Fed.
