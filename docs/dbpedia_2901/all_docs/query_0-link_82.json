        "text": "Genetic testing looks for specific inherited changes (sometimes called mutations or pathogenic variants) in a person’s genes that may increase the risk of diseases such as cancer. About 5%–10% of all cancers are thought to be caused by harmful genetic changes that are inherited from a parent.\n\nCancer can sometimes appear to run in families even if there is not an inherited harmful genetic change in the family. For example, a shared environment or behavior, such as tobacco use, can cause similar cancers to develop among family members. However, certain patterns that are seen in members of a family—such as the types of cancer that develop, other non-cancer conditions that are seen, and the ages at which cancer typically develops—may suggest the presence of an inherited harmful genetic change that is increasing the risk for cancer.\n\nMany genes in which harmful genetic changes increase the risk for cancer have been identified. Having an inherited harmful genetic change in one of these genes is sometimes referred to as having a hereditary cancer syndrome. Genetic testing of the blood or saliva can be used to identify whether someone has an inherited harmful genetic change in one of these genes.\n\nGenetic testing for inherited cancer risk is different from genetic testing of tumors, which is sometimes used to guide treatment. Tumor genetic testing, which may also be referred to as tumor DNA sequencing, somatic testing, or biomarker testing, looks for genetic changes that occurred during someone’s lifetime. It can sometimes detect inherited changes as well, but it does not replace testing for inherited cancer risk. Genetic testing of tumor cells is addressed in the Biomarker Testing for Cancer Treatment page.\n\nGenetic testing can give several possible results: positive, negative, true negative, uninformative negative, or variant of uncertain significance (VUS).\n\nPositive result. A positive test result means that the laboratory found a genetic change that is associated with an increased cancer risk. Such harmful genetic changes are called pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. A positive result may:\n\nConfirm, for a person who has cancer, that the cancer was likely due to an inherited genetic change and potentially help guide treatment choices\n\nIndicate an increased risk of developing certain cancer(s) in the future and guide future management to lower that risk, including:\n\nBeing checked at a younger age or more often for signs of cancer\n\nTaking medications or having surgery to reduce cancer risk\n\nChanging personal behaviors (like quitting smoking, getting more exercise, and eating a healthier diet) to reduce the risk of certain cancers\n\nGetting help to guide decisions about fertility and pregnancy\n\nProvide important information that can help other family members make decisions about their own health care, such as whether to have genetic testing to see if they have also inherited the harmful genetic change\n\nNegative result. A negative test result means that the laboratory did not find any harmful genetic changes in the genes tested with currently available technology. This result is most useful when a specific disease-causing variant is known to be present in a family. In such a case, a negative result can show that the tested family member has not inherited the variant that is present in their family. Such a test result is called a true negative. A true negative result does not mean that there is no cancer risk, but rather that the risk is probably the same as that of someone in the general population.\n\nWhen a person has a strong family history of cancer but the family has not been found to have any harmful genetic changes known to be associated with that cancer, a negative test result is classified as an uninformative negative. The family may still have an undetected variant leading to increased cancer risk. With more research and technology advances, it is possible additional genetic testing in the future may identify a harmful genetic change.\n\nIn the case of a negative test result, it is important that the person’s doctors and genetic counselors ensure that the person is receiving appropriate medical follow up based on their personal and family history and any other risk factors they may have. Even when the genetic testing is negative, some individuals may still benefit from more frequent checkups—particularly in the case of an uninformative negative.\n\nVariant of uncertain significance. A variant of uncertain significance (VUS) is a genetic change for which there is not enough data available to know whether it increases the cancer risk or not. A VUS may be reclassified in the future as researchers learn more about these genetic changes. Most often, a VUS is reclassified as being benign (does not increase cancer risk), so this result is typically not considered in making health care decisions.\n\nSometimes a VUS may eventually be found to be associated with increased risks for cancer. Therefore, it is important for a person with a VUS result to keep in touch with the provider who performed the testing to ensure that they will be informed of any new information on the variant.\n\nMedical test results are normally included in a person’s medical records, particularly if a doctor or other health care provider has ordered the test or has been consulted about the test results. Therefore, people considering genetic testing must understand that their results may become known to others with legitimate, legal access to their medical records.\n\nGenerally, a person’s genetic results and information in their medical record is covered by the Privacy Rule of the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. The HIPAA Privacy Rule requires that health care providers and others with medical record access protect a person’s identifiable health information by setting limits on the uses and disclosure of this information. It also empowers people to control certain uses and sharing of their health-related information; usually this means that a person must first grant permission if a person or organization not involved in their medical care wants to access to their medical records. Many states also have laws to protect patient privacy and limit the release of genetic and other health information.\n\nAdditionally, even if genetic test results are accessed or known, legal protections are in place to prevent genetic discrimination; this could occur if health insurance companies or employers were to treat people differently because they have a gene change that increases their risk of a disease such as cancer, or because they have a strong family history of a disease such as cancer.\n\nThe Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which became law in 2008, prohibits discrimination based on genetic information in determining health insurance eligibility or rates and suitability for employment. However, GINA does not cover members of the military and it does not apply to life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. Some states have additional genetic nondiscrimination legislation that addresses the possibility of discrimination in those contexts.\n\nThe National Human Genome Research Institute’s Genetic Discrimination page includes links to more information about GINA, HIPAA, and other legislation related to genetic discrimination in insurance or employment.\n\nAn increasing number of companies offer at-home genetic testing, in contrast to genetic testing that a health care provider orders in a clinical setting. People collect a saliva sample or a mouth swab themselves and submit the sample through the mail. Companies report test results in different ways, but most deliver results on a secure website or send a report by mail.\n\nThere are two broad categories of at-home testing: direct-to-consumer testing, and consumer-directed genetic testing (sometimes referred to as patient-initiated, direct access, or provider-mediated genetic testing).\n\nDirect-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests. These are genetic tests that customers can order themselves without a doctor’s order. People often use DTC tests to explore ancestry, to learn about personal traits such as an aversion to cilantro, and to get health information (such as predicting disease risk). However, these tests do not give complete genetic health information, and in most cases the information that they do give is not intended for use in making health decisions (that is, it is not clinically actionable).\n\nDTC genetic tests that are specifically for variants that confer a high cancer risk and are clinically actionable must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can be marketed. As of January 2024, the only FDA-approved DTC genetic test for inherited cancer risk tests for three different BRCA gene variants that are common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. However, there are hundreds of BRCA gene variants that could increase cancer risk in a person and family, so a negative BRCA result on a DTC test is not informative in most people. About 80% of cancer-causing BRCA variants are missed by this approach.\n\nMany DTC tests advertise that they can give a variety of interesting health results or that they will provide an individual’s raw genetic data that can be used to assess many different kinds of genomic variants. However, concerns have been raised about the claims made and practices used by some of these companies, and online tools that can be used to analyze and interpret raw data are prone to inaccuracies.\n\nConsumer-directed genetic testing. These tests are initiated by a consumer but ultimately ordered by a doctor—either someone’s own doctor, or a doctor that the testing company identifies. Doctors identified by a testing company may have an incentive to order the company’s brand of testing, whether or not it is the best test for the patient. These doctors do not meet with patients and may not have all the information necessary to provide guidance in the best testing options for a patient.\n\nAlthough the tests used in consumer-directed testing are similar to those ordered by one’s own provider in a clinical setting, people considering consumer-directed testing should be aware that the tests ordered may look at more genes than is clinically necessary, increasing the potential for unexpected and anxiety-provoking positive results and findings of variants of uncertain significance. Most companies that provide consumer-directed genetic testing do offer genetic counseling; however, if someone does not opt for counseling, they may not have an opportunity to go over their results with a health care professional. Without guidance about what genetic testing is most appropriate for them given their personal and family history or about the implications of their results, people taking at-home genetic tests may experience unneeded anxiety or false reassurance or may make important decisions about medical treatment or care based on incomplete information.\n\nDTC and consumer-initiated genetic testing both come with an increased risk of misinterpreting information. For example, a person may have a negative genetic testing result and not understand that they are still at increased risk of disease and qualify for increased surveillance based on their family history. Some insurance companies may only pay for a certain amount or type of genetic testing, so if individuals use insurance to pay for DTC testing they may find out that follow-up testing ordered by their doctor is not covered.\n\nThe privacy of at-home genetic test results is dependent on individual company policies. Companies’ disclosure policies are not always provided, or they may be difficult to find and understand. In addition, companies that provide at-home testing may not be subject to the federal and state privacy laws and regulations that protect genetic and other health information (e.g., the HIPAA Privacy Rule). People considering at-home consumer-based genetic testing should make sure that they understand a company’s privacy policy and terms of use before sending a sample.\n\nThe FDA has a page about DTC tests with information about how these tests are regulated. In 2024, the FDA indicated that it will start regulating lab-developed tests, which include many of the tests used in consumer-directed genetic testing.\n\nMedlinePlus, a consumer health website from the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, has information about DTC genetic testing."
