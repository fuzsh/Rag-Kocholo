They have processes to reach out to connect the person with the help they need.\n\nWhat is suicide?\n\nSuicide is a major public health concern. In 2021, suicide was the 11th leading cause of death overall in the United States, claiming the lives of over 48,100 people. Suicide is complicated and tragic, but it is often preventable. Knowing the warning signs for suicide and how to get help can help save lives.\n\nSuicide is when people harm themselves with the intent of ending their life, and they die as a result.\n\nA suicide attempt is when people harm themselves with the intent of ending their life, but they do not die.\n\nAvoid using terms such as “committing suicide,” “successful suicide,” or “failed suicide” when referring to suicide and suicide attempts, as these terms often carry negative meanings.\n\nWhat are the warning signs of suicide?\n\nWarning signs that someone may be at immediate risk for attempting suicide include:\n\nTalking about wanting to die or wanting to kill themselves\n\nTalking about feeling empty or hopeless or having no reason to live\n\nTalking about feeling trapped or feeling that there are no solutions\n\nFeeling unbearable emotional or physical pain\n\nTalking about being a burden to others\n\nWithdrawing from family and friends\n\nGiving away important possessions\n\nSaying goodbye to friends and family\n\nPutting affairs in order, such as making a will\n\nTaking great risks that could lead to death, such as driving extremely fast\n\nTalking or thinking about death often\n\nOther serious warning signs that someone may be at risk for attempting suicide include:\n\nDisplaying extreme mood swings, suddenly changing from very sad to very calm or happy\n\nMaking a plan or looking for ways to kill themselves, such as searching for lethal methods online, stockpiling pills, or buying a gun\n\nTalking about feeling great guilt or shame\n\nUsing alcohol or drugs more often\n\nActing anxious or agitated\n\nChanging eating or sleeping habits\n\nShowing rage or talking about seeking revenge\n\nSuicide is not a normal response to stress. Suicidal thoughts or actions are a sign of extreme distress and should not be ignored. If these warning signs apply to you or someone you know, get help as soon as possible, particularly if the behavior is new or has increased recently.\n\nLearn about actions you can take to help someone having thoughts of suicide.\n\nWhat are the risk factors for suicide?\n\nPeople of all genders, ages, and ethnicities can be at risk. Suicidal behavior is complex, and there is no single cause. The main risk factors for suicide are:\n\nDepression, other mental disorders, or substance use disorder\n\nChronic pain\n\nPersonal history of suicide attempts\n\nFamily history of a mental disorder or substance use\n\nFamily history of suicide\n\nExposure to family violence, including physical or sexual abuse\n\nPresence of guns or other firearms in the home\n\nHaving recently been released from prison or jail\n\nDirect or indirect exposure to others' suicidal behavior—such as that of family members, peers, or celebrities—can increase risk for people with suicidal thoughts.\n\nMost people who have risk factors will not attempt suicide, and it is difficult to tell who will act on suicidal thoughts. Although risk factors for suicide are important to keep in mind, someone who is actively showing warning signs of suicide may be at higher risk for danger and in need immediate attention.\n\nStressful life events (such as the loss of a loved one, legal troubles, or financial difficulties) and interpersonal stressors (such as shame, harassment, bullying, discrimination, or relationship troubles) may contribute to suicide risk, especially when they occur along with suicide risk factors.\n\nFamily and friends are often the first to recognize the warning signs of suicide, and they can take the first step toward helping a loved one find mental health treatment. See NIMH’s page with resources for finding help for mental illnesses if you're not sure where to start.\n\nIdentifying people at risk for suicide\n\nUniversal screening: Research has shown that a three-question screening tool helps emergency room personnel identify adults at risk for suicide . Researchers found that screening all patients—regardless of the reason for their emergency room visit—doubled the number of patients identified as being at risk for suicide. The researchers estimated that suicide-risk screening tools could identify more than three million additional adults at risk for suicide each year.\n\nPredicting suicide risk using electronic health records: Researchers from NIMH partnered with the VA and others to develop computer programs that could help identify increased suicide risk among veterans receiving VA health care . Other healthcare systems are also beginning to use data from electronic health records to help identify people with suicide risk.\n\nWhat treatments and therapies are available for people at risk for suicide?\n\nEffective, evidence-based interventions are available to help people who are at risk for suicide.\n\nBrief interventions\n\nSafety planning: Personalized safety planning has been shown to help reduce suicidal thoughts and actions. Patients work with a health care provider to develop a plan that describes ways to limit access to lethal means such as firearms, pills, or poisons. The plan also lists coping strategies and people and resources that can help in a crisis.\n\nFollow-up phone calls: Research has shown that when at-risk patients receive supportive phone calls that include risk monitoring and they are encouraged to engage in treatment and safe behaviors, their suicide risk goes down .\n\nPsychotherapies\n\nMultiple types of psychosocial interventions have been found to help individuals who have attempted suicide (see below). These types of interventions may prevent someone from making another attempt.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help people learn new ways of dealing with stressful experiences. CBT helps individuals recognize their thought patterns and consider alternative actions when thoughts of suicide arise .\n\nDialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has been shown to reduce suicidal behavior in adolescents. DBT has also been shown to reduce the risk of suicide attempts in adults with borderline personality disorder , a mental illness characterized by an ongoing pattern of varying moods, self-image, and behavior that often results in impulsive actions and problems in relationships. A therapist trained in DBT can help a person recognize when their feelings or actions become overwhelming and teach the person skills that can help them cope more effectively with upsetting situations.\n\nMedication\n\nSome individuals at risk for suicide might benefit from medication. People can work with their health care providers to find the best medication or medication combination, as well as the right dose. Many people at risk for suicide often have a mental illness or substance use problems and may benefit from medication along with psychosocial intervention.\n\nClozapine is an antipsychotic medication used primarily to treat individuals with schizophrenia. To date, it is the only medication with a specific U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indication for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.\n\nIf you are prescribed a medication, be sure you:\n\nTalk with a health care provider to make sure you understand the risks and benefits of the medications you're taking.\n\nDo not stop taking a medication without talking to your health care provider first. Suddenly stopping a medication may lead to worsening of symptoms. Other uncomfortable or potentially dangerous withdrawal effects also are possible.\n\nReport any concerns about side effects to a health care provider right away. They can help determine whether you need a change in the dose or a different medication.\n\nReport serious side effects to the FDA MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online or by phone at 1-800-332-1088. You or your health care provider may send a report.\n\nTo find the latest information about medications, talk to a health care provider and visit the FDA website .\n\nCollaborative care\n\nCollaborative care is a team-based approach to mental health care. A behavioral health care manager will work with the person, their primary health care provider, and mental health specialists to develop a treatment plan. Collaborative care has been shown to be an effective way to treat depression and reduce suicidal thoughts.\n\nHow can I find help for mental health concerns?\n\nIf you’re not sure where to get help, a health care provider can refer you to a licensed mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist. Find tips to help prepare for and get the most out of your visit and information about getting help.\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has an online treatment locator to help you find mental health services in your area.\n\nWhere can I learn about NIMH research on suicide?\n\nNIMH supports promising research that is likely to have an impact on reducing suicide in the United States. Research is helping improve our ability to identify people at risk for suicide and develop and improve effective treatments. NIMH researchers continue to study suicide and how to best implement suicide prevention and intervention programs in different contexts, including in health care, community, school, and justice system settings.\n\nLearn more about NIMH research priorities and recent research on suicide prevention.\n\nLatest news\n\nIncreases Found in Preteen Suicide Rate\n\n• Media Advisory\n\nResearchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that rates of preteen suicide (ages 8-12) have been increasing by approximately 8% annually since 2008.\n\nContinue reading\n\nSaving Lives Through the Science of Suicide Prevention\n\n• Feature Story\n\nEvidence-based efforts to improve suicide risk screening, assessment, and intervention are helping to save lives, thanks to research supported by NIMH.\n\nContinue reading\n\nEmergency Department Intervention Reduces Adult Suicide Risk\n\n• Research Highlight\n\nEvidence-based practices for suicide prevention effectively reduced suicidal behaviors among adults seen for care in emergency departments.\n\nContinue reading\n\nMore\n\nWhere can I learn more about suicide prevention?\n\nFree brochures and shareable resources\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Suicide: This brochure provides information about suicide including risk factors, symptoms and warning signs, treatment options and therapies, how to find help for yourself or others, and research about suicide and suicide prevention.\n\nWarning Signs of Suicide: This NIMH infographic presents behaviors and feelings that may be warnings signs that someone is thinking about suicide.\n\n5 Action Steps to Help Someone Having Thoughts of Suicide: This fact sheet presents five steps for helping someone having thoughts of suicide: Ask, Be There, Help Keep Them Safe, Help Them Connect, and Follow Up.\n\nDigital Shareables on Suicide Prevention: These digital resources from NIMH, including graphics and messages, can be used to spread the word about suicide prevention and help promote awareness and education in your community.\n\nFederal resources\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released the 2024 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention , a 10-year comprehensive approach to suicide prevention that provides recommendations for addressing gaps in the field.
