        "text": "Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is a strategic discipline that seeks to deliberately and proactively understand the full spectrum of risks including opportunities across all organizational silos, and integrates them into an enterprise-wide, strategically aligned, and interrelated risk portfolio.\n\nRisk management is a continuous process performed by staff at all levels of an organization, designed to proactively identify and manage risks to help promote the achievement of program and project objectives. Risk management activities involve identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring, and reporting on risks and associated controls. These activities form a continuous cycle that is embedded in all the ICO’s practices and business processes.\n\nERM and Risk management practices improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations. They are designed to contribute to management decision-making, alleviate potential risks, be forward-thinking, and identify previously unknown opportunities.\n\nThis policy is issued under the authority of the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) of 1982 and OMB’s Circular A-123.\n\nFederal leaders and managers are responsible for establishing goals and objectives, ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and managing both expected and unanticipated risk events. Risk management practices must be considered when designing internal controls and assessing their effectiveness.\n\nThe RM Program divides NIH into 38 designated units (NIH access only) for purposes of identifying and reporting on risks. Each designated unit has a Risk Management Officer and Risk Management Champion. The NIH Director, NIH Principal Deputy Director, NIH Deputy Director for Management, ICO Directors, OMA, Risk Management Officers, Risk Management Champions, and Risk Managers are required to carry out specific responsibilities for implementing and maintaining risk management programs, and reinforcing a culture of risk management and accountability, as set out in Section E of this policy.\n\nEffective ERM cannot be performed in isolation, therefore NIH employs a holistic approach whereby it integrates risk management and ERM practices into NIH’s daily operations, as well as strategic planning, budgeting, and performance management across all programs and activities. The NIH Risk Management Guidebook for ICOs supports this policy by describing the NIH RM Program Methodology and processes associated with each required activity outlined below.\n\nExecute all phases of NIH’s Risk Management Methodology:\n\nPhase #1 – Strategic Goals:\n\nICOs will review available mission-related strategic plan(s) and understand the associated goals and objectives\n\nICOs will consider the parameters of operating constraints when planning their risk management activities\n\nPhase #2 - Identify and Score:\n\nICOs will identify and score risks that have the potential to impact the achievement of the ICO’s mission, strategic goals, and objectives\n\nICOs will enter risks into the NIH central risk management data repository and will designate enterprise risks according to the requirements set forth in the NIH Risk Management Guidebook for ICOs\n\nPhase #3 - Assess:\n\nICOs will participate in, and support NIH-wide assessments or special reviews conducted by OMA, as set forth in Section G of this policy\n\nICOs will conduct internal ICO assessments to adequately manage their internal risks\n\nICOs will notify OMA immediately upon a determination of a potential material weakness as defined within OMB Circular A-123. OMA will then notify the NIH Chief Financial Officer of the potential material weakness because of their responsibilities pertaining to the agency’s annual Statement of Assurance\n\nPhase #4 – Manage:\n\nICOs will develop and document appropriate risk responses including action plans, as needed, for their enterprise risks according to the requirements and standards of quality set forth in Appendix A of the NIH Risk Management Guidebook\n\nPhase #5 – Monitor:\n\nICOs will routinely monitor their risk environment, identify, and score new risks, review existing risks for continued applicability, and rescore risks based on current circumstances\n\nICOs will monitor the status of risk responses\n\nICOs will monitor the effectiveness of internal controls as a normal course of business. Reviews, reconciliations, or comparisons of data should be included as part of the regularly assigned duties of personnel. In addition, ICOs should integrate periodic internal ICO assessments as part of management’s continuous monitoring of internal controls\n\nPhase #6 – Report:\n\nICOs will provide OMA with an annual risk inventory update in the NIH central risk management data repository\n\nIndividuals or ICOs designated as owners of NIH ERM risks will provide OMA with periodic status updates when requested\n\nICOs will provide OMA with a supporting annual FMFIA Statement of Assurance, as set out in Section F of this policy\n\nNIH will use ERM and risk management data and other relevant information as an integral part of the decision-making process at all levels within the organization and maintain documentation that supports the rationale for management decisions involving risks that have the potential to significantly impact the achievement of mission, strategic goals, and objectives.\n\nICOs will ensure that employees who are assigned risk management program roles understand their responsibilities and can execute RM Program requirements.\n\nThe Federal Manager’s Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) and OMB Circular A-123 require every Department-level agency to provide assurances on internal control effectiveness in its Agency Financial Report or the Performance and Accountability Report. NIH submits summary information to the Department of Health and Human Services about the effectiveness of NIH’s internal controls.\n\nThe objectives of FMFIA are to ensure:\n\nEffective and efficient operations\n\nCompliance with applicable laws and regulations\n\nReliable financial reporting\n\nOMB Circular A-123 requires NIH to continually monitor, assess, and improve the effectiveness of internal controls. As such, ICOs must provide an annual assurance statement to the NIH Director on the state of their internal controls.\n\nICOs will:\n\nProvide OMA with an annual Statement of Assurance signed by the ICO Director and enter supporting data for the current fiscal year into the NIH central risk management data repository\n\nMaintain documentation supporting their annual Statement of Assurance\n\nConduct internal control reviews within their organization to ensure internal controls are operating effectively and efficiently\n\nIf deficiencies are identified, manage and facilitate remediation efforts including the development, documentation, implementation, monitoring, and reporting of Corrective Action Plans, in accordance with the HHS Corrective Action Planning: Remediation and Risk Acceptance policy requirements\n\nProvide information and documentation to support the Office of Financial Management and the Office of the Chief Information Officer efforts to review internal controls over reporting"
