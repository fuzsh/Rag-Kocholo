Numeric total for flood social impact score corrected from 1.5–3.0 to 2.5–5.0.\n\nRationale for the revision: Internal review revealed required edits.\n\nPurpose of the National Risk Profile\n\nThe National Risk Profile (NRP) is a federal government initiative. The NRP was developed with provincial, territorial, and expert stakeholder input. It reflects information and findings compiled by the Government of Canada. The final report was drafted by the Government of Canada.\n\nThe NRP is Canada's first strategic, national-level risk assessment. This report is based on input and evidence from whole-of-society stakeholders across Canada, and provides a foundation for understanding disaster risk from the three costliest hazards facing Canadians: earthquakes, wildland fire, and floods. It aims to broaden public awareness of disaster risk, identify gaps in the Canadian emergency management system at a national level and provide evidence to support existing federal risk assessment and climate change adaptation efforts. This evidence base can help reduce disaster risk and increase resilience for everyone in Canada.\n\nGiven the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this report also contains a chapter on pandemics. However, it is important to note that this report does not analyze pandemics as a distinct hazard. Pandemics are examined as a contextual factor that affect disaster risk and response. Observations and lessons learned thus far for emergency management from the COVID-19 pandemic are also presented. However, it does not serve as a review or assessment of the Government's response to the pandemic as this remains a continuous event for which the response is ongoing.\n\nThe NRP is not a policy document nor does it include any proposed funding towards any of the gaps and issues identified. Rather, it presents all levels of government, stakeholders and the general public with national evidence on Canada's disaster risk and gaps in the emergency management system.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis report would not have been possible without the support and commitment from whole-of-society partners including federal departments and agencies, provinces and territories, municipalities, Indigenous organizations and communities, as well as the academic, private, volunteer, and non-governmental sectors from across different communities living within Canada. These participants supported risk and capability assessments in order to create a pan-Canadian picture of the hazard risks facing Canadians and core capabilities across all sectors of society. Their input and collaboration on various risk impact categories and on baseline and target capability assessments provides a critical foundation for this body of work.\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the input from Indigenous communities and individuals whose perspectives on these topics help to shape the findings, and thank Cambium Indigenous Professional Services for their assistance in this engagement.\n\nAdditionally, we would like to thank key members and the co-chair of the National Adaptation Strategy's Disaster Resilience and Security Advisory Table for their invaluable contributions to this report.\n\n1 Executive Summary\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\nAs the frequency and intensity of natural hazards across Canada increases, the importance of promoting and building resilience becomes evident. By taking a systematic, evidence-based, all-hazards approach to emergency management, this first public report of the National Risk Profile (NRP) seeks to lay a foundation for understanding disaster risk in three key areas: earthquakes, wildland fires, and floods.\n\nGiven the increasing impacts and challenges associated with climate change, capturing a national picture of disaster risk requires coordination and a common approach to integrate information across all sectors of society. Therefore, this report is based on input and evidence from whole-of-society stakeholders across Canada, and identifies current disaster risks and capability gaps in today's national emergency management system. This knowledge can help identify the interventions to reduce these risks for everyone in Canada, including addressing the disproportionate impacts of disasters on vulnerable populations.\n\nTo capture the full range of experiences, federal departments and agencies, provinces and territories, municipalities, Indigenous organizations and communities, as well as the academic, private, volunteer, and non-governmental sectors, from across different Canadian communities took part in the NRP research process. This report also includes summary targeted findings and considerations regarding Indigenous communities and emergency management, derived from an externally-facilitated engagement process led by Cambium Indigenous Professional Services. Coupled with existing knowledge and initiatives being undertaken across the federal government, this report is the first in Canada to provide a national overview of disaster risk and capabilities. By doing so, this report adopts a forward looking, all-hazards approach to inform future emergency management capabilities and build national resilience.\n\nThe report starts with an outline of how emergency management is structured in Canada, across various orders of government. Responsibility also lies with individuals who need to take steps to prepare for these disasters. Emergency management activities are governed by various legislation, plans and frameworks, which inform the approaches and responses in this space. Given the disproportionate impacts of disasters on their communities, emergency management can differ for Indigenous peoples. This results in different types of programming to respond to their unique needs.\n\nAs recent events like Hurricane Fiona and others demonstrate, building national resilience to these events is vital. In addition to the growing frequency and impacts of these events, recent data indicates that Canadians, on average, lack disaster risk awareness and knowledge, which may hinder their ability to prepare well for emergencies.\n\nGiven this reality, this public report serves as a communication tool for increasing disaster risk awareness, preparedness, readiness and response. This is a new endeavor for Canada, and supports international commitments under the United Nations Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and work already being undertaken by like-minded countries in developing similar risk assessments. This report is a key deliverable under Canada's Emergency Management Strategy and supports whole-of-society collaboration and governance to uphold disaster resilience.\n\nThe report then looks at why Canadians need to know about disaster risk. Findings in this report demonstrate the wide-reaching impacts of disasters, from heavy financial burdens for governments and individuals alike, to long-lasting psychosocial effects and more intangible losses, such as harm to priceless cultural heritage. Many disasters cause business disruption and closures, impacts to transportation networks, and/or damage to infrastructure. The data in this report clearly demonstrates that the costs of disasters, whether economic or social, government or individual, will continue to rise for both the public and private sectors. The increasing impacts of climate change, Canada's changing demographics, and other risk drivers are also given attention.\n\nAlthough these are major, growing challenges, the report speaks to how investments in adaptation have proven benefits to help mitigate and reduce the costs due to a warmer climate. Disaster mitigation and climate change adaptation projects have a proven return on investment.\n\nThe NRP is one piece in a series of federal initiatives that advance disaster risk reduction. These include various efforts to support climate change adaptation at the national level, as well as system wide changes that support improvements to emergency management approaches and response. The evidence gathered through the NRP is a foundational piece supporting these initiatives. It is a tool that will help integrate climate change adaptation into emergency management and inform decisions and investments that support overall national resilience.\n\nIn order to develop a robust evidence base, the NRP uses proven methods and follows a rigorous research process. Whole-of-society stakeholders with expertise in disaster risk reduction, emergency management and climate change adaptation, were engaged in risk and capability assessments. These assessments provide a picture of the disaster risks facing Canada and the existing capabilities in our emergency management system to address them. This knowledge can help identify interventions to reduce these risks for everyone in Canada.\n\nThis first report focuses on earthquakes, floods and wildland fires given that they are the costliest hazards for Canada. Representative scenarios were developed for each hazard and were assessed by stakeholders to improve our understanding of potential impacts, as well as the emergency management capabilities available to prepare for, respond to, and recover from these events. Stakeholders also looked at how disaster management activities are influenced by public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the risk and capability assessments helped inform how we can further our resilience to these events, as well as refine our methodology for the future as we learn from this initial round of assessments.\n\n1.2 Key Findings\n\nEach chapter in this report provides a focused analysis on the three areas noted above. Overall, the structure of each chapter includes an overview of the hazard itself, costs and losses due to the hazard, a look at who is at risk, and initial findings from national stakeholders on the impacts these events would have for people, the economy, the environment, the government, as well as potential social impacts (e.g., reduced social cohesion). The evidence also assesses the ability of Canadian communities and authorities to prepare for these events, adapt to changing risk environments, and recover from disruptions.\n\nIn addition to the hazard-specific findings outlined in each chapter, impacts for how particular groups of people experience these disasters, including for those populations at higher risk, have been considered. For example, many Indigenous communities face increasing risks to climate change related hazards because of a variety of factors, including community size, socio-economic conditions, limited access to emergency management resources, and infrastructure gaps. Further, children, the elderly, persons living with disability and those with preexisting medical conditions, among others, have heightened risks of experiencing the negative physical and psychosocial impacts of the disasters examined here. Given these impacts, this report highlights the importance of specialized approaches to emergency management to ensure that no Canadian is left behind.\n\nThe key findings of the report are summarized below:\n\n1.2.1 Earthquakes\n\n1. While the majority of earthquakes in Canada are minor and cannot be felt, a major earthquake would be very costly.\n\nData indicates, for example, that a severe earthquake in British Columbia—9.0-magnitude—could result in $75 billion in losses and a similarly probable event in the Quebec City-Montreal-Ottawa corridor could result in $61 billion in losses.\n\n2. Stakeholders identified hazard monitoring, early warning and the incorporation of Indigenous knowledge as gaps in the Canadian emergency management system related to addressing earthquakes.\n\nThese areas with gaps were identified based on a systematic assessment of the capabilities on the Canadian Core Capabilities ListFootnote 1.\n\n3. Better information on earthquake risk, and greater access to information on how to prepare for earthquakes, are required.\n\nVarious initiatives are underway across the federal government to reduce earthquake risk including actions on mitigation, community planning, and providing a better picture of what a future earthquake would look like.\n\n1.2.2 Wildland Fires\n\n4. The impacts of climate change are causing longer and more intense fire seasons, with costs to the economy in the billions.\n\nEfforts are being made to improve Canadians' awareness on how to face wildland fires in their communities, and to help build more resilient infrastructure that can stand up to the effects of wildland fire.\n\n5. There remain gaps in public awareness of wildland fires as well as in our ability to respond to wildland fires at the national level.\n\nThere is also inadequate inclusion of Indigenous knowledge in wildland fire management and response.\n\n6. Work is being undertaken to help identify the landscapes and communities that are at greatest fire risk, and which mitigation investments would be most effective.\n\nThis includes an improved understanding of fire processes and the development of operational tools to help make informed decisions on wildland fire risk.\n\n1.2.3 Floods\n\n7. Flooding is Canada's most costly and frequent hazard, causing economic, social and environmental burdens for the whole of society.\n\nClimate change is likely to increase the frequency and severity of flooding in many areas of Canada, which will further exacerbate its impacts.\n\n8. There are gaps in coordination to address flood risk across orders of government, a patchwork of flood data and information available to help mitigate flood risk, and again, low levels of awareness amongst Canadians.\n\nA significant proportion of the population is exposed to flooding, and greater information on flood risk, including forecasts and alerts, will help all levels of government mitigate the effects of flooding.\n\n1.2.4 Looking at emergency management through a \"pandemics lens”\n\nGiven the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadians and the Canadian emergency management system, the pandemics lens chapter focuses on how pandemics and public health emergencies interact with, and affect, other hazards and disasters. It does not provide analysis of pandemics as a distinct hazard, but rather shares “pandemic lens” considerations that emerged from the risk assessments for earthquakes, wildland fires and floods as well as a summary of observations and considerations for future pandemics.\n\n9. The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on deeply entrenched health, social and economic inequities that exist in Canada, specifically for populations already experiencing poorer health outcomes.\n\nThese vulnerable populations face pandemics at a greater risk of illness and death and many carry a greater burden of public health measures.\n\n10. Decreased operational capacity during a pandemic has significant impacts on emergency response.\n\nFor example, hospital capacity issues are magnified when a disaster happens during a pandemic (concurrent events), and evacuations after a disaster pose challenges for limiting pandemic exposure and spread.\n\n11. Partnerships amongst all levels of government, and attention to equitable measures to support resilience across Canada, will be key.\n\nThe NRP contributes to the growing evidence base on the impacts of pandemics on Canadians as it relates to emergency management. As our knowledge of pandemics evolves, so too will our policies, practices, and approaches across all response areas, for all hazards.\n\n1.2.5 Cross-cutting findings\n\nThe cross-cutting findings of this report highlight emergency management gaps that were identified across the risk assessments for earthquakes, wildland fires and floods. They fall under three broad categories: emergency management governance and coordination, disaster recovery and resilience, and empowering Canadians to be prepared for disasters.\n\n12. Emergency management governance and coordination:\n\nTo ensure the resilience of Canadian society to disasters and the impacts of climate change, emergency management and disaster risk reduction activities must be coordinated, proactive and efficient. There remain alignment gaps between different jurisdictions in terms of emergency management approaches and programming. There is also room to further integrate climate change adaptation into emergency management as well as address information sharing gaps between the health and emergency management systems.\n\n13. Disaster recovery and resilience:\n\nWe know that disasters and climate change are having significant mental health impacts for Canadians, but there is a need for better data on these broad psychosocial consequences. Low levels of insurance uptake in high-risk earthquake and flood areas as well as inadequate risk reduction measures—such as retrofit programs and natural infrastructure solutions—were also identified as important gaps.\n\n14. Empowering Canadians to be prepared for disasters:\n\nThere is a need to raise awareness of disaster risk among Canadians to create a culture of disaster preparedness. Specific areas where gaps exist include: access to information on risks from particular hazards and how to prepare for them, robust community disaster response capabilities and the integration of Indigenous knowledge in emergency management activities.\n\n1.3 Looking Ahead\n\nThis report is a first step towards understanding disaster risk in Canada from a national perspective that builds upon existing knowledge and stakeholder expertise. This report does not propose policy solutions, but will serve as an evolving, foundational evidence base and tool to increase national disaster risk awareness and support a whole-of-society approach to emergency management. In the future, the NRP will expand to consider other disaster risks, including a focus on human-induced hazards that could significantly impact Canada's national security and economic prosperity, such as acts of terrorism or cyber-attacks.\n\nThe evidence base supporting the NRP will continue to grow and evolve this year and into the future, with the goal of providing more national-level analysis and information on gaps and challenges in the Canadian emergency management system, so that effective decision-making can be supported with strong evidence. As new data is gathered and findings developed, the NRP methodology will be refined and improved to capture the impacts of a broader range of disasters and to further improve understanding of the capabilities to prevent, mitigate, respond to, and recover from these events.\n\n2. Background and Purpose\n\n2.1 What is emergency management and why do we need it?\n\nEmergencies and disasters have wide-ranging impacts on the lives and livelihoods of Canadians. This section provides an overview of emergency management in Canada and the role of the National Risk Profile (NRP) in protecting Canadians and building national resilience. The findings of the NRP provide a picture of the risks facing Canada and shed light on how the current emergency management system is able to reduce and cope with disaster risks. In the long term, this evidence base may help inform whole of society actions to support effective decision-making and investments for ensuring a safer, more resilient Canada.\n\nWhen a hazardFootnote 2 affects Canadians to the extent that the impact exceeds or overwhelms a community's ability to cope, and may cause serious harm to safety, health, property or the environment, the event becomes known as a disaster. Emergency management is how we manage, mitigate, prepare, respond to, and recover from emergencies and disasters.\n\nCanada borders three oceans, stretches across six time zones, and consists of an array of meteorologically influencing mountains, plains, forests, and tundra. Severe weather and geological events that can lead to a disaster are a constant reality for Canadians because Canada experiences diverse weather across a range of natural environments in a massive and seismically active landscape. The natural and built environments experience weather that ranges from Arctic to moderate, from seemingly endless rains to drought, from frigid cold to deadly heat waves.\n\nCanada has been impacted by a wide range of disasters over the course of its history, most of which have been induced by natural hazards. Over the last 25 years, there has been a significant increase in the number of these disasters dating back to an influx of events in the mid-1990s. (e.g., the 1996 Saguenay River flood, the 1997 Red River flood, and the 1998 Ice Storm in Eastern Canada). Furthermore, we have also seen a notable increase in the scale of disasters over the last ten years, such as the 2011 Slave Lake wildland fire, the 2013 Toronto and Calgary pluvial floods, the 2016 Fort McMurray wildland fire and the respective 2017 and 2021 British Columbia wildland fire events, floods and landslides. ReportingFootnote 3 by the Insurance Bureau of Canada shows how various disasters across Canada in 2022 made it the third highest year for uninsured losses in Canadian history ($3.12 billion) including topping total insured losses for 2021 ($2.48 billion).Footnote 4 Many of these events disproportionately impact groups such as Indigenous peoples, women, children, 2SLGBTQIA+Footnote 5, the elderly and persons with a disability, amongst others. Climate change is one of several key risk drivers attributed to the increasing frequency and severity of disasters.Footnote 6\n\nCanada is also at risk of experiencing other types of hazards. The COVID-19 pandemic is a poignant example of how biological hazards can have devastating consequences.\n\n2.2 Who is responsible for emergency management?\n\nSince 2007, federal, provincial and territorial collaboration in emergency management has been guided by the Emergency Management Framework for CanadaFootnote 7 which aims to guide and strengthen the way governments and partners assess risks and work together to prevent, mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk to Canadians.\n\nLocal authorities and individual citizens have a responsibility to be prepared for disasters, and contribute to their community's ability to respond to an emergency. Since disasters most often occur on a local scale, the first response to an emergency is almost always conducted by local or provincial and territorial authorities. Every province has its own unique emergency management structure, including how to engage federal support in the event of an emergency. Many serious situations are dealt with by local or provincial authorities in accordance with provincial emergency management or other relevant legislation and policies. Should provincial, territorial or Indigenous governments require resources beyond their capacity to cope in an emergency or disaster, they may request assistance from the federal government.\n\nAt the federal level, the Emergency Management ActFootnote 8 provides that the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness is generally responsible for exercising leadership relating to emergency management in Canada by coordinating, among federal government institutions, and in cooperation with the provinces and other entities, emergency management activities. Under the Emergency Management Act, all federal Ministers have responsibilities for emergency management activities related to risks within or related to their areas of responsibility. Consistent with its special relationship with Indigenous peoples, the federal government works in partnership with Indigenous peoples and leadership to provide emergency management on reserve and to Indigenous peoples, in coordination with the provinces and territories.Footnote 9\n\nThe 2011 Federal Emergency Response PlanFootnote 10 is the all-hazards plan for a coordinated federal response to emergencies. In most cases, federal government institutions manage emergencies with event-specific or departmental plans. While federal government institutions may implement these plans during an emergency, they must also implement the processes outlined in the Federal Emergency Response Plan in order to coordinate with the federal government's emergency response.\n\nBuilding on past international efforts, an important milestone in aligning the concepts of emergency management and disaster risk reduction came in 2015, when Canada joined 187 countries at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in adopting the UN Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk ReductionFootnote 11 (2015-2030). The UN Sendai Framework is a non-binding international agreement that establishes international priorities for disaster risk reduction, and further creates direct linkages with UN climate change and sustainable development efforts. As a signatory to the Sendai Framework, the Government of Canada has committed to improving our resilience strategies, preparedness efforts, early warning systems and cooperation to reduce disaster risks.\n\n2.3 The Emergency Management Strategy for Canada: Toward a Resilient 2030\n\nIn January 2019, the Emergency Management Strategy for Canada: Toward a Resilient 2030Footnote 15 was endorsed by federal, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for emergency management and on March 17, 2022, the 2021-22 Federal, Provincial, and Territorial Emergency Management Strategy Interim Action PlanFootnote 16 was released to guide this work.Footnote 17 The Emergency Management Strategy helps fulfill the Government of Canada's commitment under the UN Sendai FrameworkFootnote 18 for a pan-Canadian disaster risk reduction strategy and aligns with the UN Sendai Framework's 2030 timeline.\n\nThe Emergency Management Strategy builds on previous federal, provincial and territorial government efforts by establishing priorities to strengthen the resilience of Canadian society by 2030. It establishes five priority areas of activity:\n\nEnhance whole-of-society collaboration and governance to strengthen resilience;\n\nImprove understanding of disaster risks in all sectors of society;\n\nIncrease focus on whole-of-society disaster prevention and mitigation activities;\n\nEnhance disaster response capacity and coordination and foster the development of new capabilities; and,\n\nStrengthen recovery efforts by building back better to minimize the impacts of future disasters.\n\nOne of the key elements in the UN Sendai Framework is the importance of adopting a whole-of-society approach, which seeks to leverage existing knowledge, experience and capabilities within emergency management partners in order to strengthen the resilience of all.\n\n2.3.1 Emergency management framework for Indigenous peoples and communities\n\nIndigenous communities are among those most at risk of experiencing and being disproportionately impacted by emergencies. This is often due to legacies of colonialism and forced displacement, their remote and coastal locations and limited access to emergency services and resources for implementing disaster risk reduction and emergency management among other considerations. These realities contribute to, and are also compounded by, low socio-economic outcomes and housing and infrastructure deficits. Further, many Indigenous communities are among the most vulnerable to climate change driven disasters as well as slow onset climate impacts due to close cultural and traditional ties to the land and natural ecosystems.\n\nEmergency management responsibilities can differ for Indigenous peoples and communities. First Nation communities on reserve can access emergency management support through Indigenous Services Canada. Métis and Inuit have different historic and contemporary experiences and relationships with the Crown, which is why federal distinctions-based emergency management programs apply differently than for on-reserve First Nation communities.\n\nIn northern regions and territories where a large proportion of Inuit, First Nations and Métis peoples and communities reside, and where there are many modern treaties or self-governing agreements, the degree and types of responsibility for emergency management may vary between the territorial government, the local authorities (including Indigenous governments and organizations)and the federal government. The territorial governments are responsible for coordinating regional and territorial level emergency response and providing a coordination role with local emergency management authorities.\n\nFor on-reserve First Nation communities, emergency management is handled through cooperation between First Nations communities and their leadership, federal, provincial and territorial governments and non-governmental organizations. Where self-governing agreements are in place, these present a further consideration and determination of emergency management responsibilities.\n\nWhere Indigenous peoples live off-reserve or are members of landless bands south of the 60th parallel (non-territorial responsibility),Footnote 19 emergency management and flood risk management is generally determined by the provinces and municipal authorities, sometimes in consultation with Indigenous organizations and/or Indigenous community leadership. Some programming may be accessible to status individuals for evacuation and recovery.Footnote 20 Historically, federal emergency management programming has been limited, and new investments tend to address socio-economic discrepancies.\n\nIndigenous knowledge plays an essential role in disaster risk reduction and recovery for Indigenous communities. Indigenous peoples have shared and unique histories and contexts that impact how they conduct emergency management, based on distinction (First Nation, Métis, and Inuit) as well as by community and by other demographic factors (e.g., gender, region, etc.).\n\nFurther, diverging understandings of risk and impact and data gaps can affect emergency management planning, coordination and collaboration, and thereby present a risk in emergency management for Indigenous communities. Addressing these areas for action presents an opportunity for advancing Reconciliation.Footnote 21 Emergency management presents a vital area for building and strengthening federal relationships with Indigenous emergency management partners, and a means of mitigating some of the risks caused by current socio-economic disparities. The systemic exclusion of Indigenous knowledge and perspectives and approaches to emergency management may be addressed as Indigenous partners, the Government of Canada, provinces and territories, municipalities, academia and other emergency management sector partners work together towards reducing disaster risks and improving emergency management capabilities in Canada.\n\nIndigenous participation has been an important aspect of developing the NRP, and careful note has been made to examine considerations for Indigenous peoples through distinctions-based and gender-based analysis plus approaches that add methodological rigour to assessments of systemic inequalities.Footnote 22 Footnote 23\n\nThis report will highlight key summary information and findings based on historic information and examples as they relate to contemporary realities of Indigenous experiences, risks and impacts of disasters. The report acknowledges that there is limited open-source data on emergency management and disaster risk reduction efforts for Inuit and Métis populations and accordingly includes high level conclusions from targeted engagement sessions with Inuit and Metis individuals and organizations. Efforts were made to integrate these considerations for the purposes of this first public report. As such, this represents a first attempt to integrate these considerations, and as the NRP evolves, further efforts to incorporate more detailed findings on these experiences will be added.\n\n2.4 The National Risk Profile: A tool to implement the Emergency Management Strategy\n\nApproved and funded under Budget 2019 as part of the federal implementation of Canada's Emergency Management Strategy, the NRP directly supports its first two priority areas: Enhance whole-of-society collaboration and governance to strengthen resilience and Improve understanding of disaster risks in all sectors of society.\n\nThe NRP is a strategic and coordinated national assessment of the existing measures that support disaster risk reduction and associated emergency management capabilities. It integrates both scientific evidence and input from stakeholders nationwide, across a number of sectors. The findings of the NRP provide a picture of the risks facing Canada and shed light on how the current emergency management system is able to reduce and cope with disaster risks. The NRP also provides evidence to support national-level decision-making and investments with the goal of reducing, preparing for, and responding to disasters, which can help support a whole of society approach.\n\nAs previously noted, Indigenous participation has been an important aspect of developing the NRP. In order to increase understanding of the unique and amplified risks faced by these populations, careful consideration has been given to examining the contexts of First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples and communities throughout Canada, including on- and off-reserve, and in urban and rural settings.\n\nThe NRP will be implemented in stages, as hazards and threats are assessed over time. This first report provides an overall picture of the risks that Canada faces with a focus on three of the most concerning and costly hazards—earthquakes, wildland fires, and floods—and the capabilities for managing the associated risks. The NRP risk and capability assessments for this report also considered emergency management for these hazards in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n2.5 Why do Canadians need to know about disaster risk?\n\nDisasters can cause significant health, infrastructure, environmental and social damage, with greater impacts on vulnerable populations. In the face of more frequent and dangerous disasters, we cannot protect ourselves if we do not understand the risks. Successful preparation for and response to emergencies requires that we all play a role in managing these risks. Additionally, there are a series of risk drivers on the disaster risk landscape, including climate change, which must inform Canada's approach to emergency management and whose impacts must be clearly understood.\n\nThe Canadian Disaster DatabaseFootnote 24 contains information on more than 200 disasters that took place between 2008 and 2020, which cost hundreds of billions of dollars in damages and displaced hundreds of thousands of Canadians.Footnote 25 As this report will demonstrate, these costs are only increasing, only proving that disaster awareness is an imperative for all Canadians.\n\n2.6 Risk perception, awareness and disaster preparedness\n\nRisk perception is a judgement and/or interpretation of risk, based on a combination of personal, social and cultural contexts, the chance of negative events occurring, and their likely consequences. Among the Canadian public, there are notable gaps in disaster risk awareness and knowledge that is necessary for emergency preparedness and reducing risk.\n\nA 2021 survey of public opinionFootnote 26 related to emergency preparedness conducted by IPSOS on behalf of the federal government, found that most Canadians (74%) believe they live in a low- (53%) or moderate-risk (22%) area.Footnote 27 Two in ten (21%) are unaware of the specific level of risk or have never thought about it, while only 4% of Canadians believe they live in an area that is at high risk.Footnote 28 Further, most Canadians are unconcerned (29%) or unaware (47%) of specific risks of weather-related emergencies and natural hazards.Footnote 29\n\nThe survey also found that nearly all Canadians have at least some emergency safety items in their home, but very few (27%) report taking most or all of the necessary specific measures mentioned in the survey to protect their home.Footnote 30 In addition, one in ten Canadians (11%) have taken steps to reduce the risk of their home being affected by a weather-related emergency or disaster such as a flood, wildland fire, tornado, hurricane, ice storm, blizzard, or extreme cold event.Footnote 31\n\nCanadians' experiences with COVID-19 appear to have had some effects on the way they prepare for disasters: half of the survey respondents said the experience of COVID-19 has affected the way they prepare for emergencies, including storing additional food and essential items and putting money aside for unexpected expenses.Footnote 32\n\n2.7 An evolving disaster risk environment: risk drivers\n\nRisk drivers are processes or conditions that increase the magnitude of disaster risk by increasing the level of likelihood, exposure and vulnerability, or by reducing capacity for management.\n\nClimate change and increased population density in urban areas, as well as changing demographics (e.g., aging populations), are among the key risk drivers influencing the extent of disaster risk for Canadians, and their impacts are projected to increase.Footnote 33 Footnote 34 As Canada implements the Emergency Management Strategy to enhance our collective resilience to disasters by 2030, the NRP recognizes that these risk factors are essential for understanding the totality of disaster risks and designing appropriate interventions.\n\n2.7.1 Changing climate\n\nCanada's changing climate is causing deep and lasting impacts on our society, economy and environment.Footnote 35 Due to the range of weather types and land masses in Canada, our economy is highly climate‑sensitive, making climate change a macroeconomic risk that threatens to significantly undermine future prosperity in Canada, and an affordability risk for Canadian households.Footnote 36\n\nThe 2019 Canada's Changing Climate ReportFootnote 37 shows that Canada's climate is warming at twice the global average rate and even faster in northern regions, putting the population, economy and environment at a higher risk of natural hazards leading to disasters. Climate change also increases the intensity of climate extremes—acute natural hazard events that are responsible for many of the disasters in Canada. The Insurance Institute of Canada's New Climate Risks ReportFootnote 38 explores risks and solutions and indicates that the average annual severe weather claims paid by insurers in Canada is expected to double over the next 10 years, increasing from $2.1 billion to $5 billion annually.Footnote 39\n\nGiven the relationship between climate change impacts and disaster risk, the concepts of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation have significant overlap, but are also distinct. Figure 1 shows key terminology, interrelations and differences between these concepts.\n\nFigure 1: Disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation Disaster risk reduction Overlap between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation Climate change adaptation\n\nGeographical Hazards\n\nEarthquakes, tsunamis, landslides, and volcanic eruptions\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nBased primarily on historical data\n\nLong History\n\nOver 1000 years\n\nClimatic Hazards\n\nStorms, floods, landslides, temperature extremes, droughts, fires, etc.\n\nImpacts\n\nDeaths and injuries, population shifts, loss of resources, security and access to shelters, etc.\n\nClear political commitments\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework\n\nScope for coherence\n\nIn disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation, towards resilience\n\nNeed for an inclusive approach\n\n“All-of-states and all-of-society” approaches\n\nSlow onset events\n\nSea-level rise, desertification, etc.\n\nNon-disaster aspects of climate change adaption\n\n(including positive benefits from climate change)\n\nRisk assessment\n\nClimate risk models and projections\n\nEmerging topic\n\nSince 1985\n\nSource: Adapted from information derived from Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (2020), Common Ground Between the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework: Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction, OECD Publishing, Paris.\n\nClimate change also impacts physical and mental health and public health more broadly, which can deepen inequities and lead to impacts on socioeconomic drivers of health outcomes.Footnote 40 Food security is also impacted, due to a range of factors such as the implications of changing weather patterns and extreme weather on agriculture.Footnote 41 Climate change is also projected to increase the frequency and severity of infectious diseases in Canada, leading to increased disaster risks associated with pandemics.Footnote 42\n\nIn light of the worsening health impacts from climate change, in October 2022, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer released the annual report on the state of public health in Canada, Mobilizing Public Health Action on Climate Change in Canada.Footnote 43 The report offers tangible actions to ensure public health systems are prepared to respond to health-related climate impacts.\n\n2.7.2 Increasing population density\n\nCanada's increasing urban density has contributed to communities sprawling outward (urban sprawl). Many of Canada's major urban centers, or census metropolitan areas, are located near or within hazardous zones such as flood plains, coasts and seismic fault lines. Population growth and distribution, especially increased population density and urbanization, increases vulnerability to disasters. When a disaster strikes densely populated areas, it causes more damage and affects a greater number of people, particularly due to growing interdependence among various forms of critical infrastructure.\n\n2.7.3 Projected evolving demographics\n\nSocial, economic, environmental and cultural circumstances influence individual and group vulnerabilities to disasters and climate change. Examples of factors influencing vulnerability include household income, remoteness, access to essential emergency services, food security and age. Combined, these factors affect disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation capacities and capabilities. In Canada, the some of the most vulnerable populations to natural hazards include coastal, small, rural, remote and Indigenous.Footnote 47 Persons belonging to these communities may also be a part of groups previously identified in sub-section 2.1 as more vulnerable to the disaster risk and impacts (e.g., women, elderly, etc.).\n\n2.8 Economic impacts of disasters\n\nSince emergency management is a shared responsibility, the direct and indirect economic cost of disasters is assumed by all levels of government, the private sector, and by citizens. Notable federal programs that support disaster assistance include the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements and the Emergency Management Assistance Program.Footnote 48 These exist alongside provincial recovery programming and instruments provided by the private sector.\n\nGiven the interconnectivity of our infrastructure and social systems, Canadians bear many direct and indirect disaster-related costs. Some of the many cascading impacts of disasters include supply chain interruptions and associated impacts on food and water security, lasting impacts on business continuity and deepening of inequities, and disproportionate impacts on those vulnerable populations.\n\nFurther, worsening climate change impacts result in increasing disaster costs. The Canadian Climate Institute's report on reducing the costs of climate impactsFootnote 49 in Canada projects that these costs will have severe impacts: drastically reducing national economic growth, decreasing affordability and limiting prosperity opportunities for Canadians. For example, extreme weather in B.C. in November 2021 resulted in not a single rail or road route open between Vancouver and the B.C. Interior — isolating Canada's biggest port for more than a week and interrupting national supply chains already struggling under the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.Footnote 50 Footnote 51\n\nIn a 2020 report, the Canadian Climate Institute highlights that insured losses for catastrophic weather events have tripled, totaling more than $18 billion between 2010 and 2019.Footnote 52 In a 2022 report they projected that in 2025, Canada will experience $25 billion in losses relative to a stable-climate scenario, which is equal to 50% of projected 2025 GDP growth. It is projected that household incomes could decrease by 18% as a result.Footnote 53\n\n2.8.1 Federal expenditures under the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements and the Emergency Management Assistance Program\n\nIn the event of a large-scale disaster where costs exceed what a province or territory could reasonably be expected to bear on its own, the Government of Canada may provide, upon request, financial assistance through the Disaster Financial Assistance ArrangementsFootnote 54.\n\nProvincial and territorial governments design, develop and deliver disaster financial assistance, deciding the amounts and types of assistance provided to those that have experienced losses. Effective January 1, 2022, a province or territory may request Government of Canada disaster financial assistance when eligible expenditures exceed $3.38 per capita. Eligible expenses under the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements include, but are not limited to: rescue operations, restoring public works and infrastructure to their pre-disaster conditions, as well as replacing or repairing basic, uninsurable essential property of individuals, small businesses, and farmsteads. The percentage of eligible costs reimbursed to provinces and territories by the Government of Canada is determined by the cost-sharing formula clearly outlined in the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements, and is up to 90% of eligible expenditures.\n\nIn partnership with First Nations communities, provinces and territories and non-governmental organizations, the Emergency Management Assistance ProgramFootnote 55 helps First Nation communities on reserve to access assistance services. These funds help First Nation communities build resiliency, prepare for, and respond appropriately to natural hazards and health emergencies. The federal government, through Indigenous Services Canada, works closely with First Nations and partners to bolster emergency preparedness and administer the Emergency Management Assistance Program as the primary source of federal funding to reimburse on-reserve emergency management activities, including flood mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.\n\nTo be eligible for funding under the Emergency Management Assistance Program, the emergency event must have impacted, or the proposed project must directly support, First Nations located on:\n\nA reserve, as defined in s. 2 (1) of the Indian Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-5\n\nLands set aside in Yukon as per Cabinet Directive (Circular No. 27) entitled Procedure for Reserving Land in the Yukon and Northwest Territories (1955)\n\nLands formerly defined as a reserve or lands set aside which now form part of modern treaty settlement lands\n\nOff-reserve Indigenous communities are supported in their emergency management activities by provinces and territories, and may therefore be eligible for support via the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements.\n\nThe Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements and Emergency Management Assistance Program have seen a significant increase in response and recovery costs since their inception. Since the launch of the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements program in 1970, it has contributed more than $7.9 billion to provinces and territories; over 63% of which was paid out in the last 10 years.There has been a steady increase in reimbursements from the Emergency Management Assistance Program to First Nations communities over the last three decades due to increases in disaster frequency and severity.\n\n2.8.2 Disaster insurance losses\n\nInsurance losses have increased steadily since 1983, and most notably in the last decade. From 1983 to 2019, insured losses from catastrophic disasters totaled roughly $26.8 billion, not adjusted for inflation.Footnote 56 The new normal for yearly insured catastrophic losses in Canada is $2 billion, most of it due to water-related damage. Compare this to the period between 1983 and 2008, when Canadian insurers averaged only $422 million a year in severe weather-related losses. In 2021 alone, insured losses from catastrophic weather events in Canada, amounted to $2.1 billion.Footnote 57\n\nIn recent years, flooding has caused approximately $1.5 billion in household, property and infrastructure damages annually (~$700 million in insured losses and $800 million in uninsured losses), with residential property owners bearing approximately 75% of uninsured losses each year. A recent report by Canada's Task Force on Flood Insurance and Relocation for Adapting to Rising Flood RiskFootnote 58 estimated the cost associated with residential flooding in Canada to be $2.9 billion per year.Footnote 59\n\nIn terms of wildland fires, six events have been recorded by the Insurance Bureau of Canada, representing just under one fifth of all losses. This also includes the 2016 Fort McMurray wildland fire, which is the single most expensive insurance loss in Canadian history, and which caused losses of approximately $3.75 billion insured losses and over $7 billion of direct and indirect losses.Footnote 60\n\nWhile no earthquake has met the Insurance Bureau of Canada's threshold for catastrophic losses to date, the 2013 and Versik (formally known as AIR Worldwide) studyFootnote 61 commissioned by the Insurance Bureau of Canada estimates that a 1-in-500 year (0.2% annual enrollment period)Footnote 62 earthquake in British Columbia at a 9.0-magnitude would result in $75 billion in direct and indirect economic losses (only $20 billion of which is insured), while a smaller but comparable scenario in Eastern Canada (7.1-magnitude) could potentially cost $61 billion.\n\n2.8.3 Indirect and intangible losses\n\nDisaster risks can incur a range of indirect losses that are not easily captured using monetary measures. For example, destroyed or damaged property and infrastructure (both human-made and natural) can disrupt the livelihoods and well-being of individuals and businesses who depend on such infrastructure (e.g., tourism, agriculture workers, hunters, and transportation networks).\n\nDisasters can also cause losses that are more difficult or impossible to measure, such as human lives, injuries or damage to priceless cultural heritage; these are known as intangible losses.Footnote 63 These kinds of losses are borne disproportionately by vulnerable and Indigenous populations. Disasters can also be cascading beyond the direct areas of impact and have an impact on supply chains, food security, and negative impacts to mental health.\n\nSome studies in Canada have begun to quantify indirect and intangible losses as a result of disasters. For example, in 2020, Health Canada published a health impact analysis of air pollution from wildland fire smoke in Canada (for the years 2013 – 2018), which estimated there would be 54-240 premature deaths per year caused by short-term exposure and 570-2500 premature deaths per year due to long-term exposure, as well as many cardiorespiratory morbidity outcomes.Footnote 64 For the years considered in the analysis, the estimated costs associated with acute health impacts of wildland fire smoke ranged between $410 million to $1.8 billion per year, and the chronic health impacts were estimated to cost between $4.3 to $19 billion per year.\n\nThe indirect and cascading impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic illustrate the complexity and interconnectivity of pandemic disaster risk and impacts. Statistic Canada's COVID-19 in Canada: A Two-year Update on Social and Economic ImpactsFootnote 65 highlights some key examples of persisting financial uncertainty for business and labour market challenges including adjustments to a post-pandemic world, mental health decline and disruptions to non-COVID related healthcare.Footnote 66\n\n2.8.4 Future costs and benefits of disaster risk reduction efforts and climate change adaptation\n\nIt is expected that costs of responding to disasters, in addition to managing climate change impacts, will continue to rise for all sectors, with broad impacts on the economy and for Canadians. There are a variety of reports which have begun to assess, project and analyze these costs. Findings may vary due to the scope and methodology of these reports, but as this section notes, there are clear challenges ahead.\n\nA November 2022 report by the Office of the Parliamentary Budget officer, indicates that the 0.9-degree Celsius average increase in surface temperature and 2.5 per cent increase in average precipitation observed for Canada over 1981 to 2021 (relative to 1961-1990 reference levels), have lowered the level of Canadian real GDP in 2021 by 0.8 per cent (or $20 billion in 2021 dollars).Footnote 67 Further, studies suggests that overall direct economic losses could total $15.3 billion per year by 2030, or $111.1 billion from 2020 to 2030, and that total direct and indirect economic losses could cost between $21 and $43 billion annually by 2050.Footnote 68 Footnote 69 Footnote 70 The extent to which these projections will prove true will depend on the effectiveness of future and ongoing mitigation, and adaptation activities.\n\nBeyond direct and indirect economic losses, adapting to Canada's changing disaster environment will have significant and ongoing costs. Further, the impacts of climate change are likely to have an impact on a broad range of regions or sectors of the economy.Footnote 71 The world's warming climate will accelerate climate- and weather-related damage to some of the Canada's most important infrastructure. As sea levels rise and rainfall increases, flood damage to homes and buildings could increase fivefold in the next few decades and by a factor of ten by the end of the century, with costs as high as $13.6 billion annually.Footnote 72 Early investment in adaptation can substantially reduce the impacts and costs to infrastructure of a hotter and changing climate. A February 2020 report by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and the Insurance Bureau of Canada estimated that Canada's public and private sectors must invest an average of $5.3 billion annually to build climate change resilience into infrastructure in order to minimize loss and damage.Footnote 73 The Canadian Climate Institute's report also emphasized that proactive investments in climate change adaptation, along with global emissions reductions, can reduce costs by a factor of four.Footnote 74\n\nThe Canadian Climate Institute also notes that climate damages impair investments in future productivity because climate change impacts will affect all regions and most economic sectors (e.g., transportation, manufacturing), to varying degrees, across all future climate scenarios.Footnote 75\n\nAlthough these impacts are challenging it is important to note that studies have demonstrated that disaster mitigation and climate change adaptation projects and activities can have a return on investment between $4.6 and $10 for every dollar spent, with higher returns for non-structural measures (e.g., risk assessment, hazard analysis, mitigation planning) compared to structural measures (e.g., dykes, seawalls, dams, fire breaks, critical infrastructure).Footnote 76\n\nIt is also important to note that in addition to post-disaster assistance, the Government of Canada is reducing the risk and the impact of disasters through pro-active investments in prevention and mitigation. Since 2018, $3.86 billion(rounded) has been allocated to the Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund —a program that supports community infrastructure projects aimed at preparing for, withstanding and recovering from disasters. This funding will help protect Canadians from climate change driven hazards such as floods and wildland fire.\n\nInternational research on investment rates and climate change adaptation measures in the US, UK and the EU suggests that national governments investing 0.66-1.25% of GDP, in adaptation measures, will minimize the worst impacts of extreme weather events.Footnote 82 For Canada, this would represent investments of $13.5-$25.6 billion per year,Footnote 83 with potential returns on investment of $62.1-$256 billion.Footnote 84 Canadian-specific research indicates that proactive climate change adaptation investments can yield returns of up to $15 per $1 invested.Footnote 85\n\nBeyond response and recovery efforts, it is important to ensure that regions experiencing infrastructure deficits are properly prepared for emergency events. Strengthening these areas can minimize the effects that emergency events will have on the lives of the people in these communities.\n\nIncreased infrastructure adaptation (e.g., infrastructure that is designed, located, and built to be resilient in the changing climate and extreme weather) can help mitigate possible future losses, especially in areas already experiencing infrastructure deficits and significant climate change impacts, such as in northern Canada.Footnote 86 Accordingly, permafrost thaw is more likely to occur in the north, where there is limited infrastructure and mobility options (e.g., many regions may be fly-in only); therefore, reducing the impacts and costs of permafrost thaw on airports in the north is an important measure to mitigate damage costs and meet regular and emergency mobility needs in these regions.Footnote 87 Through incremental adaptations, the annual net costs of airport infrastructure damage in some northern regions could be reduced by 74 to 88% on average.Footnote 88 Footnote 89\n\n2.8.5 Other federal initiatives advancing disaster risk reduction\n\nIn the coming decades, climate change will bring more frequent, intense and diverse extremes weather events, while the cost of direct, indirect and slow-onset impacts will continue to accumulate. Acting now to adapt to climate change can help ensure the wellbeing of all people in Canada.\n\nAdvancing climate change adaptation, has become an essential part of Canadian disaster risk reduction efforts. Adaptation in the disaster risk reduction context is about being better prepared to respond to and recover from climate change-related events, reducing the impacts on Canadians and communities. The evidence and stakeholder input gathered though the NRP advances the integration of climate change adaptation into emergency management, and will be used to inform decision-making and strategic investments for disaster risk reduction and resilience.\n\nNational Adaptation Strategy\n\nIn response to the Government of Canada's December 2020 commitment, the National Adaptation Strategy (NAS) was launched on November 24, 2022. The NAS was developed with provincial, territorial and local governments, Indigenous peoples, other key partners, and the public, and provides a roadmap for whole-of-society action on adaptation that will help prepare communities for the impacts of climate change. It includes goals and targets across five key themes: disaster resilience, health and wellbeing, nature and biodiversity, infrastructure, and economy and workers.\n\nAs climate change is now a prominent risk driver in Canada, ensuring that the NRP evidence base supports the NAS will enable better emergency management by advancing a culture of emergency preparedness, data on disaster risk (e.g., flood mapping), and capabilities to improve climate resilience and adaptation in the long term. The NAS includes near-term targets to help improve Canada's resilience to climate-related disasters. These include eliminating mortality, reducing morbidity, displacement, and damage from wildland fire, and protecting households in high-risk flood zones and those subject to flooding from extreme precipitation.\n\nEvidence and stakeholder input gathered though the NRP helps to integrate climate change adaptation into emergency management, which is a key goal of the NAS, and will also inform decision-making and strategic investments for disaster risk reduction and resilience. This integration will improve efficiency across the emergency management system, leverage and align our collective emergency management and climate change adaptation expertise, better prepare communities for emergencies and climate related disasters, and help support greater mechanisms for a timely response and recovery. Important areas of alignment include building resilience to high-profile hazards in Canada, such as floods, wildland fires, and heat events.\n\nClimate change adaptation programming in northern and First Nations communities\n\nFor on-reserve First Nation communities, the federal government works in partnership with local governments, provincial and territorial governments and non-government organizations to help communities access emergency assistance services including mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery.\n\nThe First Nation AdaptFootnote 90 and Climate Change Preparedness in the NorthFootnote 91 programs provide funding to help these communities assess and respond to the impacts of climate change on community infrastructure and disaster risk reduction, including flood mapping. Under both programs, funding for flood mapping is available.\n\nOverall system-wide transformation\n\nEfforts are being made across the Government of Canada to guide a seriesof phased, system-wide actions to build resilience across all hazards for future emergencies. This approach seeks to work more closely with whole-of-society partners (provinces, territories, Indigenous communities,Footnote 92 municipalities, academia, voluntary and private sectors, and civil society) in order to advance proactive prevention and mitigation efforts, and to ensure that robust response and recovery capabilities are developed and implemented, based on leading evidence and scientific information.\n\nThe emergency management system in Canada plays a key role in climate change adaptation. Through this system-wide transformative work, the federal government will call for bold, concrete action to advance collaboration on climate-related challenges and emerging incidents and hazards.\n\nThe NRP is identified as necessary for successfully transforming Canada's emergency management system in the short-term. It accomplishes this by providing a means to address known gaps in national disaster readiness (e.g., addressing uneven emergency management capabilities and capacities across the country), and disaster risk reduction (e.g., improving understanding of disaster risks at the national level).\n\nFurther, the NRP enhances our knowledge and communication capacity on disaster risks, thereby informing strategic investments in disaster risk reduction activities and capability development.\n\n3. NRP process: building the evidence base\n\nCreating a national picture of disaster risk requires coordination and a common approach to integrate information across all sectors of society, as expertise on disaster risk is spread across multiple jurisdictions, academia, NGOs, organizations, corporations and sectors.\n\nIn order to capture a national perspective, whole-of-society stakeholders from across Canada, were invited to participate in risk and capability assessments relevant to their expertise with a focus on understanding national representative risks and gaps within our emergency management system. Risk and capability assessments provide a forward-looking picture of the disaster risks facing Canada and the existing capabilities in our emergency management system to address them. This knowledge is foundational to identifying appropriate interventions to reduce these risks to everyone in Canada, including addressing the disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations.\n\nTo capture the full range of experiences, stakeholders included federal departments and agencies, provinces and territories, municipalities, Indigenous organizations and communities, as well as the academic, private, volunteer, and non-governmental sectors, selected from across different communities living within Canada.\n\nThe first round of National Risk Profile (NRP) risk and capability assessments targeted earthquakes, wildland fires, and floods because they were identified as the three costliest hazards that Canadians face, based on average annualized lossFootnote 93 at the time of assessment. Pandemic risk did not receive the same level of attention as the three natural disasters. It was added to the NRP cycle as a later consideration to account for the extraordinary impacts that COVID-19 had on all aspects of society. As a result, the pandemic chapter only provides pandemic lens considerations as they relate to earthquakes, wildland fires, and floods and an executive summary of systemic observations and potential considerations for future pandemics.\n\nFor earthquakes, wildland fires, and floods, representative scenarios were developed for each hazard (e.g., Gatineau earthquake) — drawing on probabilistic modelling and historical data — and assessed by stakeholders to improve our understanding of potential impacts, as well as the emergency management capabilities available to prepare for, respond to, and recover from hazard events.\n\nThis report combines the results of this assessment with the results of probabilistic modelling by the Government of Canada, and external scientific findings, to provide a comprehensive picture of risk and capabilities.\n\nAdditional details on the process undertaken for these risk and capability assessments are attached as annexes to this report: Scenario Development; Risk Assessment Methodology; Capability Assessment Methodology.\n\n3.1 Assessment of risksFootnote 94\n\nFrom March to April 2021, 12 four-hour virtual risk assessment sessions were conducted with a total of 294 attendees across Canada, from a variety of sectors. Participants were asked to assess each scenario according to five impact categories: people, economy, environment, social function, and government.\n\nAdditionally, participants were asked to consider:\n\nthe \"Future Lens,\" which looks at the impacts of climate change, changing demographics, and increasing population density on hazard risks by 2050;\n\na “pandemic lens,” which examines how disaster management activities are influenced by public health emergencies;\n\nGender-based analysis plus dimensions, including socio-economic vulnerabilities, to more accurately capture the range of factors which contribute to disaster risk; and\n\nPotential critical infrastructure impacts, including which sectors would be impacted in a hazard scenario, and the additional cascading impacts that will result from interruptions to critical services.\n\n3.1.1 Indigenous engagement\n\nAs part of a federally-led representative engagement and consultation process, First Nations, Métis, and Inuit representatives and organizations were invited to participate in the risk assessment sessions. In addition, Indigenous consultants facilitated engagement sessions with Indigenous experts and stakeholders to gather and report on the views and considerations of relevant community risk exposure to floods, wildland fire, and earthquakes, notably with Métis and Inuit communities for whom there was limited open-source data with regard to emergency management.\n\n3.2 Assessment of capabilities\n\nA capability refers to the ability to provide equipment, suitable human and other resources to effectively deal with, or help address an emergency situation or a disaster.\n\nCapability assessments support capability-based planning - an evidence-informed process for reducing risk and building resilience (see Annex D: Capability Assessment Methodology, for details).\n\nStakeholders evaluated select capabilities (e.g., hazard monitoring and early warning) from the Canadian Core Capability List,Footnote 95 in relation to each hazard scenario. To assess Canada's current capability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disaster events, select stakeholders participated in a survey to assess capabilities to:\n\nidentify baseline levels of capability across Canada;\n\nestablish targeted levels of capability;\n\ndetermine existing gaps between the baseline and target capability; and\n\nidentify opportunities to build capacity and resilience across all hazards. (See Annex D: Capability Assessment Methodology)\n\nCapabilities were assessed on a five-point scale:\n\nCritical shortfall:\n\nSeveral elements of this capability are not sufficient and will jeopardize successful delivery of this capability;\n\nSerious shortfall:\n\nOne element of this capability is not sufficient and will likely jeopardize successful delivery of this capability;\n\nMinor shortfall:\n\nAdditional risk may be realized if interventions are not made to improve one or more of the elements of this capability;\n\nAdequate:\n\nTaken together, the elements of this capability are near optimal; and\n\nStrong:\n\nThis capability is very robust. Reallocation to other capabilities may be considered, given surplus strength, as necessary.\n\nUsing the current state of the capability as a baseline, stakeholders provided input on what level of capability was required to reduce risk to an acceptable level. The gap between the baseline assessment and the desired future state (target) provides insight on where action is required to address capacity and competence gaps in Canada's readiness levels to respond to disaster risk.\n\nThe risk and capability assessment data collected, provides high-level conclusions that can inform resilience and risk reduction activities. Input was also received on how to refine data collection and assessment to improve NRP best practices for future reports.\n\n3.3 Data limitations\n\nThis first public report of the NRP reflects the findings of the first round of national risk and capability assessments. Best efforts were made to engage with national stakeholders with emergency management and disaster risk reduction expertise across the country, but in some areas there were gaps in terms of the number and breadth of participants who could engage fully in this process. Therefore, although a robust methodology was used to develop this report, it may not be prudent to view its findings as completely definitive as data collection for this round was not fully comprehensive. Moving forward, work will continue to ensure that the NRP's whole of society engagement expands with greater, more representative input from stakeholders with relevant lived experience and expertise who are best placed to provide insight on the broad range of disaster risks and impacts for communities across Canada. These efforts are already well underway for future rounds.\n\nAs this report is based on the first NRP research process, there are limitations in data availability. Efforts to strengthen sampling and familiarity with content are ongoing as the NRP methodology is refined. The NRP risk assessment results reflect significant contributions from representative engagements with a wide range of emergency management experts, community members and stakeholders from across Canada. Participants were referred by the federal interdepartmental committee that is providing strategic leadership and guidance on NRP research and report development, as well as provincial and territorial partners, and through direct engagement. In order to provide a quality environment for data collection, the project committed to anonymizing data and input based on the individual's professional role. All stakeholders participated on a voluntary basis and the data collected is based on their varied individual expertise and experiences.\n\nThe results of this report are based on the assessment of representative hazard scenarios. These findings are intended to illustrate a broad range of disaster risks and impacts and increase our understanding of the capabilities needed to prevent, mitigate, respond to, and recover from these events. The data presented is a complement to, but not a substitute for, probabilistic hazard modelling. Lessons learned on data limitations will be addressed in the development of future NRP reports.\n\nThe following chapters provide a detailed overview of earthquakes, wildland fires, and floods. Given the varying levels of knowledge and evidence for each of the hazards, the chapters differ in terms of structure and information presented.\n\n4. Hazard: Earthquakes\n\nAn earthquake occurs when the Earth's crust slips suddenly along faults or fault planes and releases massive amounts of energy in the form of seismic waves. These waves cause the ground to shake and can be felt up to hundreds of kilometers away from the earthquake origin. Much of the damage caused by earthquakes results directly from these seismic waves, but secondary impacts can also include tsunamis, landslides, fires,Footnote 96 and liquefaction (weakening of the ground surface). Globally, earthquakes account for approximately one fifth (20%) of natural hazard-induced disasters and have an average annual death toll of over 25,000.\n\nEarthquakes are measured on a magnitude scale, which reflects the amount of energy released in a seismic event. The severity of an earthquake depends on the magnitude, location, ground conditions, construction standards, and other factors in the affected area. Devastating events such as those in Japan (magnitude 9.0 in 2011), New Zealand (magnitudes 7.1 and 6.2 in 2010 and 2011 respectively), and Northridge, USA (magnitude 6.7 in 1994) help us understand the potential impacts of an earthquake occurring in Canada.\n\n4.1 Understanding earthquakes in Canada\n\nOur knowledge of earthquakes has advanced immensely over the past few decades as a result of sustained investment in hazard research and monitoring. While it is not possible to predict earthquakes, probability estimates are used to better understand the seismic hazard in various regions.\n\nHistorically, the west coast of Canada has experienced magnitude 9 earthquakes and associated tsunamis. The Yukon and Northwest Territories, Arctic islands, and Canada's east coast have also experienced events of considerable magnitude.\n\nThe most active region in eastern Canada is the Charlevoix Seismic Zone, located in north-eastern Quebec. Due to the geology of this region, ground shaking from even moderate earthquakes can have widespread effects. Over the past 350 years, at least five earthquakes greater than magnitude 6.0 have occurred in this region.Footnote 97 Expected losses from a 1-in-500 year earthquake in the Charlevoix Seismic Zone or on Canada's West Coast would be higher than any natural hazard the country has experienced.Footnote 98 Footnote 99\n\nThe Western Quebec Seismic Zone constitutes a vast territory that encloses the Ottawa Valley from Montreal to Timiskaming, as well as the Laurentians and the Eastern Ontario. The Western Quebec Zone was the site of at least three significant earthquakes in the past, all of which were a magnitude of 5 or higher.\n\nIndirect impacts of earthquakes reach far beyond the strongly-shaken area, potentially across the country and internationally, which underscores the value of a whole-of-society approach to risk management to help manage these indirect impacts.\n\n4.1.1 Earthquake risk management\n\nEarthquake risk is managed at all orders of government through policy, mitigation, and risk transfer strategies. At the federal level, related activities include: emergency management, earthquake monitoring and alerting, research and risk assessment, regulation of development and the built environment, and critical infrastructure resilience considerations (retrofitting government buildings, seismic upgrades to major bridges), intergovernmental mutual aid arrangements, and financial services supervision.\n\n4.2 Earthquake exposure and likelihood – who and what is at risk?\n\nThere are several factors that impact earthquake risk across Canada. The infrequent nature of earthquake events and the broad lack of public risk awareness, particularly in Ontario and Quebec, have led to low levels of general preparedness. For example, many people may not know what to do during an earthquake (“drop, cover, and hold on”).Footnote 101\n\nMost at-risk Canadians are uninsured or under-insured for earthquakes. This is most pronounced in Quebec, where fewer than 5% of households have earthquake insurance. In British Columbia, this figure is between 40% to 70% of residential properties. Although the number of households with residential property insurance is relatively high in British Columbia, the terms and deductibles of these insurance policies may limit effective coverage.\n\nThe Insurance Bureau of Canada notes that earthquake insurance is usually available to be purchased as an add-on to a home insurance policy, and the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements does not cover losses for which insurance is available at a reasonable cost. Earthquake insurance is subject to a higher deductible than coverage for other perils and may not cover all damages resulting from an earthquake event (e.g., Tsunami related damage or land damage as a result of landslides or liquefaction).Footnote 102\n\nFurthermore, there are many older and/or historical buildings that were constructed before seismic provisions were introduced into the building code, including in downtown cores, Indigenous communities, and residential zones. Current building codes in Canada typically include requirements only for life safety. This means that they are built to allow for safe evacuation, but not for safe use thereafter without substantial and costly repairs (with the exception of some critical infrastructure, such as hospitals).\n\n4.2.1 Possible losses\n\nA report by the Insurance Bureau of Canada and Versik (formally known as AIR Worldwide) estimates that a severe earthquake in British Columbia — 9.0-magnitude — could result in $75 billion in losses and a similarly probable event in the Quebec City-Montreal-Ottawa corridor could result in $61 billion in losses.Footnote 103\n\nIn addition to economic losses, a major earthquake event could cause widespread and long-term social and economic disruption in the affected region and beyond. When looking at losses, it is also important to note that earthquakes are sometimes followed by major fires, whose damage can greatly exceed the damage due to shaking. A report prepared for the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR) noted that fire losses may result in up to $10 billion, which would be fully insured, in addition to the partially insured losses from ground shaking.Footnote 104\n\n4.3 Understanding differential impacts of earthquakes – who is most vulnerable?\n\nAnyone living or working in a structure that was constructed in an earthquake-prone region before seismic provisions were included in local building codes is at greater risk.Footnote 105 Children, seniors, and those with mobility, sensory, and cognitive disabilities are particularly vulnerable. Low-income households are less likely to be able to recover losses that result from earthquake events. Rural and remote communities that have minimal access to transportation infrastructure will face challenges with evacuation planning and access to resources for response and recovery. This is also relevant for Indigenous communities, and on reserve lands, where there may be limited resources and funding for emergency management.\n\n4.3.1 Risk for Indigenous peoples and remote communities\n\nMuch of the infrastructure in some Indigenous communities and on reserve lands is aging and there is no detailed analysis of Indigenous community infrastructure to identify what seismic upgrades might be needed.Footnote 106 This infrastructure gap leads to greater risk posed by earthquakes, as limited and aging infrastructure is less able to withstand earthquake impacts, and not easily repaired following an incident.\n\nRemote and isolated areas may be subject to damaging ground shaking, tsunami inundation, landslides, and liquefaction, as well as fires or critical infrastructure failures. Indigenous participants in the NRP assessment processFootnote 107 noted that due to capacity limitations, building codes are not consistently applied across Indigenous communities, leading to additional vulnerability in built infrastructure. Assessment sessions for the NRP with some Indigenous experts, organizations and stakeholders also revealed that infrastructure failures or compromised, limited and single-road access could make it difficult to access basic needs (e.g., potable water) and the provision of essential goods and services.Footnote 108\n\nParticipants also noted that earthquake impacts to the environment, including land and wildlife, can significantly affect cultural practices, community wellness, and the fulfillment of basic needs such as harvesting and hunting. In some cases, cultural sites that are land-based may be entirely lost.\n\n4.4 Understanding risk drivers – how is earthquake risk changing?\n\nPhysical and social vulnerabilities represent the most prominent drivers of earthquake risk in Canada. Earthquake risk is changing as a result of the demographic shift towards an aging population, increasing urban population density, the accumulation of assets in earthquake-prone areas, and an increased dependence on power, water, and telecommunications utilities. Other considerations driving earthquake risk in Canada include variances in public awareness of seismic risk. Recent evidence suggests that climate change is having an impact on seismic risk. This has been seen both through increases in earthquake rates in areas where ice sheets in the Arctic are thinning quickly, as well as through degradation of permafrost, resulting in soils that are more vulnerable to strong shaking and failure during shaking.\n\n4.5 NRP earthquake risk assessmentsFootnote 109\n\nDrawing on expert knowledge and available data (including insights gained from probabilistic modelling results), seismologists from Natural Resources Canada developed four earthquake scenarios used for risk assessment. For each scenario, a narrative was constructed describing the magnitude and location of the earthquake. The severity and scope of each event was selected to match the associated average annual loss value. Each earthquake scenario notes strong and damaging shaking that triggers several different impacts such as landslides, infrastructure and highway damage, power outages, port closures, and tsunamis.\n\nNRP risk assessment participants assessed the consequences of these earthquake scenarios across five impact categories: people, economy, environment, government, and social. The results of this assessment are summarized below. Additional information — drawn from the broader literature on earthquakes — has also been incorporated.\n\nThe complete risk assessment results can be found in Figure 3: NRP earthquake risk results.\n\nFigure 3: NRP risk assessment scorecard: earthquakes\n\nTotal average risk = Likelihood x Average consequence\n\nTotal average risk rating range: 6.0–9.6Footnote 110\n\nTotal average future trend: Significant increasing\n\nTotal average confidence: Medium\n\nTable 3a: Likelihood assessment — present day Scenario size descriptorFootnote 111 Scenario size ($M) Likelihood Minor (2) 100 (Yukon) Very low Moderate (3) 1,000 (Galiano) Moderate Major (4) 10,000 (Ottawa-Gatineau) Low Catastrophic (5) 100,000 (Cascadia) Low Average likelihood Low\n\nTable 3b: likelihood assessment — future lens Risk drivers Future trend Average score Explanation Climate Change Moderate increasing 3.9 Both densification including the accumulation of assets and changing demographics due to an aging population increase risk within earthquake-prone areas.

Population density Significant increasing 4.0 Both densification including the accumulation of assets and changing demographics due to an aging population increase risk within earthquake-prone areas. Climate change increases the conditions for secondary impacts such as landslides and liquefaction. Demographics Moderate increasing 3.9 Both densification including the accumulation of assets and changing demographics due to an aging population increase risk within earthquake-prone areas. Climate change increases the conditions for secondary impacts such as landslides and liquefaction.\n\n4.5.1 Findings: people impact category\n\nThe earthquake scenarios were in the range of major to catastrophic on the people consequence rating scale (Annex C: Risk Assessment Methodology).\n\nHuman life, physical health, and mental well-being are significantly impacted by earthquake events. Injuries sustained during earthquakes are primarily movement and fall-related: often caused by running out of a building or attempting to move to safety or from objects falling from shelves or ceilings.\n\nIn the aftermath of an earthquake, emergency services, including hospitalizations are likely to exceed capacity, overwhelming the health care system.Footnote 115 Non-fatal injuries often exceed fatalities by orders of magnitude and are driven mostly by non-structural damage (e.g., overturned furnishings and broken glass). Large earthquake disasters also lead to traumatic experiences that increase mental health risk and reduce psychosocial well-being. Limitations on the ability to react, such as mobility difficulties or limited earthquake preparedness knowledge, may increase the risk for some individuals such as seniors, newcomers, or visitors.\n\nLoss of life often occurs during a building collapse or critical infrastructure failure (e.g., dams, power lines, bridges, roadways, etc.) or due to inundation after an earthquake. In these situations, debris and rubble can hamper first responders' ability to provide aid. As noted earlier, older buildings, particularly those with unreinforced masonry and those in residential areas, often do not conform to building codes and pose a greater risk of collapse. Damage to buildings' energy and gas lines can also cause fires (e.g., the 1906 San Francisco earthquake resulted in a fire that destroyed 28,000 buildings and over 3,000 fatalities).Footnote 116\n\nThere are also a number of indirect impacts related to earthquakes, including loss of access to food, potable water, medication, and services. Remote communities may find themselves cut off from critical supplies and services and single-road-access or fly-in communities face evacuation and recovery challenges. Water may be tainted when remote communities' local resources such as groundwater systems are damaged or exposed to leaks, posing health impacts. This is also a concern for Indigenous communities. Reserves are often located in rural and remote regions, where connection to medical services and critical infrastructure may be impeded.\n\n4.5.2 Findings: economy impact category\n\nThe four earthquake scenarios were developed where direct and indirect economic loss was assessed at $100 million, $1,000 million, $10 billion, and $100 billion (See Figure 3).\n\nThis places the scenarios in the range of minor to catastrophic on the economy consequence rating scale (Annex C: Risk Assessment Methodology).\n\nLarge earthquake events differ from most other hazards due to their widespread and long-term impacts, and their potential to cause extensive social and economic disruption in the affected region and beyond. The disruption caused can include impacts on supply chains, employment, and loss of critical services such as power, water, and telecommunications.\n\nRemoval of earthquake debris and repair services (notably for older and pre-code building structures) result in significant costs, as does liquefaction and surface flooding which damage roads. While this can happen anywhere, this risk is particularly strong in lower mainland British Columbia due to soil type and in northern communities where buildings constructed on permafrost are at high risk of sinking if the permafrost is damaged due to earthquakes or climate change, posing significant remediation costs.\n\nIndirect costs have a significant impact on total disaster loss. They are often more uncertain than property repair costs and can be more difficult to estimate as there are challenges with evaluating the opportunity costs associated with productivity loss. For instance, tourism-dependent industries in seismically active areas often suffer significant interruption following an event. Further, there are delays in production as it takes time to rebuild and recover from damage to historical buildings, natural landscapes, and industry operations (where relevant). Both regional and domestic trade disruptions are expected when earthquakes impact transportation corridors, bridges, and major economic centers. These disruptions cause supply chain issues, could lead to food shortages and associated revenue losses.\n\nEarthquake insurance is not included in standard home insurance policies. An Insurance Bureau of Canada study found that 55% of people living in British Columbia are uninsured whereas up to 96% of people living in Quebec do not have earthquake coverage.\n\n4.5.3 Findings: environment impact category\n\nThe earthquake scenarios were in the range of moderate to catastrophic on the environment consequence Rating Scale (Annex C: Risk Assessment Methodology).\n\nEarthquakes have significant impacts on the natural environment and structural and non-structural componentssuffer greater damage, generating higher carbon costs when rebuilding.Footnote 117 Damaged buildings can create significant amounts of debris and dust clouds, which impact air quality. Asbestos, released from older buildings, may impact human health and safety. These effects can be exacerbated when fires are triggered by seismic activity. Response and rebuilding activities, including transportation of materials, may increase greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nEnvironmental spills resulting from damage to infrastructure in residential and industrial zones, as well as resource extraction sites, can expose damaging materials (chemicals, raw materials, wastewater, and oil) that may in turn negatively impact water supplies, water quality, ecosystems, and nearby communities. Damage to permafrost can lead to increased release of methane gasses, potentially impacting northern communities and disrupting ecosystems. Land deformations and landslides triggered by earthquakes may also negatively impact migrating animals and fish habitats. Finally, soil erosion is often accelerated by earthquakes, changing coastlines, and ecosystems.\n\n4.5.4 Findings: government impact category\n\nThe earthquake scenarios were in the range of moderate to major on the government consequence rating scale (Annex C: Risk Assessment Methodology).\n\nAll orders of governments play a critical role in prevention efforts that aim to mitigate risk, reduce impacts, and build capacity and resilience. Investments in mitigation measures such as better land-use planning, improved flood and fire infrastructure, and retrofitting public buildings and assets, can reduce the damage caused by an earthquake. Other government investments, such as early warning systems, provide advance notice and allow people to act quickly in seeking shelter.\n\nCanadians look to governments to provide leadership and support during and after disasters. Given the federal government's role in supporting economic recoveries through employment insurance and other discretionary measures, the federal fiscal balance could be impacted by earthquake risks. Depending on the broader economic effects of the earthquake, the fiscal balance could also be impacted by change in tax revenue, exchange rates, and inflation. Particularly, governments in remote and Indigenous communities have limited ability to provide post-event support straining their ability to meet expectations.\n\n4.5.5 Findings: social impact category\n\nThe earthquake scenarios were in the range of moderate to catastrophic on the social consequence rating scale (Annex C: Risk Assessment Methodology).\n\nDisplacement has far-reaching impacts on communities disrupting livelihoods, social connections, sense of place, and items of historical and cultural significance. School disruptions negatively impact children and youth, and caregivers are required to take on additional responsibilities to support minors. Vulnerable groups may find it challenging to cope, especially where job losses occur and impact earning potential. During evacuation, pets that are left behind need to be housed, cared for, and reunited with their owners. Research indicates that domestic violence often increases in the aftermath of a traumatic event. Historic and cultural loss may impact social cohesion within a community.\n\n4.6 Earthquake capability assessments\n\nThe goal of effective earthquake preparedness is to build resilience and reduce financial, social, and physical vulnerabilities associated with possible earthquake events. The development of the NRP is an important mechanism for consolidating capability assessments focused on representative engagement. Targeted capability assessment seeks to better understand the ability of Canadian communities and jurisdictions to prepare for earthquakes, adapt to changing risk environments, and recover from disruptions.\n\nIn 2021-22, NRP capability assessment participants were engaged to:\n\nIdentify baseline levels of capability across Canada;\n\nEstablish targeted levels of capability;\n\nDetermine existing gaps between the baseline and target capability; and\n\nIdentify opportunities across disaster hazards to build capacity and resilience.Footnote 118\n\nThirty-four capabilities, out of thirty-eight, from the Canadian Core Capabilities List (CCCL) were assessed by NRP capability assessment participants in relation to the earthquake scenarios. Ten of these were assessed as having minor shortfalls, twenty-two as having serious shortfalls, and two capabilities were assessed as having a critical shortfall. Additionally, twenty-three of the thirty-four capabilities were assessed as having a significant gap — between the current and desired state — 1.5 or higher (on a scale of 1 to 5). Fifteen of these had gaps of 2 or more.\n\nThe complete capability assessment results are below in Figure 4.\n\nTable 4a: Earthquake: Priority area 1: Enhance whole-of-society collaboration and governance to strengthen resilience Core capability ConfidenceFootnote 119 Baseline Target Gap\n\nCCCL 1: Whole-of-Society Interoperability\n\nLow\n\n3.1\n\n4.7\n\n1.6\n\nCCCL 2: Whole-of-Society Governance\n\nLow\n\n2.9\n\n4.3\n\n1.4\n\nCCCL 3: Whole-of-Society Collaboration\n\nMedium\n\n3.5\n\n5\n\n1.5\n\nCCCL 4: Indigenous Collaboration\n\nMedium\n\n1.8\n\n4.9\n\n3.1\n\nTable 4b: Earthquake: Priority area 2: Improve understanding of disaster risks in all sectors of society Core capability Confidence Baseline Target Gap\n\nCCCL 5: Risk Assessments\n\nLow\n\n3.3\n\n4.4\n\n1.1\n\nCCCL 6: Intelligence Information SharingFootnote 120\n\nMedium\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n1.0\n\nCCCL 7: Hazard Monitoring and Early Warning\n\nLow\n\n2.5\n\n4.8\n\n2.3\n\nCCCL 8: Public Information and Awareness\n\nLow\n\n3.1\n\n4.4\n\n1.3\n\nTable 4c: Earthquake: Priority Area 3: Increase focus on whole-of-society disaster prevention and mitigation activities Core capability Confidence Baseline Target Gap\n\nCCCL 9: Critical Infrastructure Resilience\n\nLow\n\n2.7\n\n4.8\n\n2.1\n\nCCCL 10: Property Resilience\n\nLow\n\n2.6\n\n4.6\n\n2.0\n\nCCCL 11: Public Infrastructure Resilience\n\nLow\n\n2.8\n\n4.5\n\n1.7\n\nCCCL 12: Emergency Planning\n\nMedium\n\n3.6\n\n4.8\n\n1.2\n\nCCCL 14: Structural Risk Reduction Measures\n\nLow\n\n2.8\n\n4.5\n\n1.7\n\nCCCL 15: Non-Structural Risk Reduction Measures\n\nLow\n\n2.6\n\n4.5\n\n1.9\n\nCCCL 16: Environmental Risk Reduction\n\nLow\n\n2.7\n\n4.3\n\n1.6\n\nTable 4d: Earthquake: Priority Area 4: Enhance disaster response capacity and coordination and foster the development of new capabilities Core capability Confidence Baseline Target Gap\n\nCCCL 17: Emergency Public Alerting\n\nLow\n\n3.2\n\n4.6\n\n1.4\n\nCCCL 18: Emergency Evacuation and Transportation\n\nLow\n\n2.6\n\n4.4\n\n1.8\n\nCCCL 20: Specialized Response - Search and Rescue\n\nLow\n\n2.8\n\n4.4\n\n1.6\n\nCCCL 21: Specialized Response Hazmat / CBRNEFootnote 121\n\nHigh\n\n1.0\n\n3.0\n\n2.0\n\nCCCL 24: Public Health / Medical Services\n\nLow\n\n2.5\n\n4.6\n\n2.1\n\nCCCL 25: Operational Coordination\n\nMedium\n\n2.9\n\n4.3\n\n1.4\n\nCCCL 26: Operational CommunicationsFootnote 121\n\nHigh\n\n2.0\n\n5.0\n\n3.0\n\nCCCL 27: Emergency Legal and Financial AdviceFootnote 121\n\nLow\n\n2.0\n\n5.0\n\n3.0\n\nCCCL 28: Emergency Logistics\n\nMedium\n\n2.4\n\n4.7\n\n2.3\n\nCCCL 29: Emergency Social Services\n\nLow\n\n2.9\n\n4.3\n\n1.4\n\nCCCL 30: Fatality Management ServiceFootnote 121\n\nLow\n\n2.0\n\n5.0\n\n3.0\n\nCCCL 31: Training and Education\n\nMedium\n\n3.0\n\n4.3\n\n1.3\n\nCCCL 32: Exercising\n\nMedium\n\n3.3\n\n4.3\n\n1.0\n\nCCCL 33: Critical Infrastructure Restoration\n\nLow\n\n2.2\n\n4.4\n\n2.2\n\nTable 4e: Earthquake: Priority Area 5: Strengthen recovery efforts by building back better to minimize the impacts of future disasters Core capability Confidence Baseline Target Gap\n\nCCCL 34: Psychosocial Health\n\nLow\n\n2.3\n\n4.8\n\n2.5\n\nCCCL 35: Environmental Restoration\n\nLow\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n0.5\n\nCCCL 36: Cultural RestorationFootnote 122\n\nLow\n\n2.5\n\n4.5\n\n2.0\n\nCCCL 37: Economic Recovery\n\nLow\n\n2.5\n\n4.6\n\n2.1\n\nCCCL 38: Property Recovery\n\nLow\n\n2.6\n\n4.7\n\n2.1\n\n4.6.1 Gaps in earthquake resilience\n\nThree key gaps in Canada's resilience to earthquake risk were identified in relation to the following Canada's Emergency Management Strategy priority areas:\n\nPriority 1: Enhance whole-of-society collaboration and governance to strengthen resilience\n\nA lack of standardized, national systems for identifying, prioritizing and retrofitting buildings at risk from structural damage from earthquakes to reduce potential losses (mitigation of pre-event structural risk).\n\nPriority 2: Improve understanding of disaster risks in all sectors of society\n\nDue to the low frequency of earthquake events, awareness of catastrophic earthquake risk and associated preparation activity is low, with many underinsured and uninsured Canadians living in at-risk zones.\n\nKnowledge and data on earthquake hazard risk, while accessible, is not well understood across Canada as well as necessary actions to take during an earthquake. (i.e., drop, cover, and hold on).\n\nPriority 3: Increase focus on whole-of-society disaster prevention and mitigation activities\n\nEarthquake insurance is not included in standard home insurance policies.\n\nThere are gaps in established procedure for response logistics, business continuity, and communication following an event — partially due to the low frequency of catastrophic earthquakes — planning and preparedness is not at the baseline/desired threshold.\n\n4.7 Moving forward\n\nOur understanding of earthquake hazards is rapidly evolving and improving as more data becomes available and we learn from events in Canada and around the world.\n\nFor example, there are still significant uncertainties around the potential size and frequency of earthquakes, with few identified active faults in Canada. As such, continued seismic hazard research will contribute to an improved understanding of earthquake risk in support of risk reduction decisions. To that end, Natural Resources Canada is conducting research to fill these gaps by mapping and studying current and past seismic activity to understand what the future may bring, and continues to seek opportunities as technology advances to improve monitoring of earthquakes, particularly in regions where current network coverage is weak such as remote Arctic areas.\n\nIn addition to this research, starting in 2019, the Government of Canada invested $5.95 million over five years to develop a National Earthquake Risk Assessment Framework as part of the NRP.
