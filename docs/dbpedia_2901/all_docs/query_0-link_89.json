        "text": "Recommendations\n\nThis clinical practice guideline includes 12 recommendations for clinicians who are prescribing opioids for outpatients aged ≥18 years with acute (duration of <1 month), subacute (duration of 1–3 months), or chronic (duration of >3 months) pain, excluding pain management related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care (Box 3). The recommendations are not intended to be implemented as absolute limits of policy or practice across populations by organizations, health care systems, or government entities. In accordance with the ACIP adapted GRADE method, CDC based the recommendations on consideration of clinical evidence, contextual evidence (e.g., benefits and harms, values and preferences, and resource allocation), and expert opinion. Expert input is reflected within the recommendation rationales. For each recommendation statement, CDC notes the recommendation category (A or B) and the type of evidence (1, 2, 3, or 4) supporting the statement (Box 3).\n\nCategory A recommendations indicate that most patients should receive the recommended course of action; category B recommendations indicate that different choices will be appropriate for different patients, requiring clinicians to help patients arrive at a decision consistent with patient values and preferences and specific clinical situations. Consistent with the ACIP (106,116) and GRADE method (103), category A recommendations were made, even with type 3 and 4 evidence, when there was broad agreement that the advantages of a clinical action greatly outweighed the disadvantages. Category B recommendations were made when there was broad agreement that the advantages and disadvantages of a clinical action were more balanced, but advantages were significant enough to warrant a recommendation. Recommendations were associated with a range of evidence types, from type 1 to type 4.\n\nIn summary, the categorization of recommendations was based on the following assessment:\n\nA number of nonpharmacologic treatments and nonopioid medications are associated with improvements in pain, function, or both that are reportedly comparable to improvements associated with opioid use (7–11).\n\nEvidence exists that multiple noninvasive nonpharmacologic interventions improve chronic pain and function, with small to moderate effects in specific pain conditions, and are not associated with serious harms. Compared with medication treatment, for which benefits are anticipated while patients are taking the medication but are not usually expected to persist after patients stop taking the medication, multiple noninvasive nonpharmacologic interventions are associated with improvements in pain, function, or both that are sustained after completion of treatment (9).\n\nNonopioid drugs, including serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants, pregabalin or gabapentin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are associated with small to moderate improvements in chronic pain and function. Drug class–specific adverse events include serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or renal effects with NSAIDs and sedation with anticonvulsants (8).\n\nOpioid therapy is associated with similar or decreased effectiveness for pain and function versus NSAIDs across multiple common acute pain conditions (10). Opioid therapy is associated with small improvements in short-term (duration of 1 to <6 months) pain and function compared with placebo, with increased short-term harms compared with placebo, and with evidence of attenuated pain reduction over time (between 3 and 6 months versus between 1 and 3 months) (10). Evidence exists from observational studies of an association between opioid use for acute pain and long-term opioid use (10). Evidence on long-term effectiveness of opioids remains very limited (7); a long-term (12 months) randomized trial of stepped therapy for chronic musculoskeletal pain found no difference in function and higher pain intensity after starting with opioid therapy compared with starting with nonopioid therapy (74). Evidence exists of increased risk for serious harms (including opioid use disorder and overdose) with long-term opioid therapy that appears to rise with increase in opioid dosage, without a clear threshold below which there is no risk (7).\n\nNo validated, reliable way exists to predict which patients will experience serious harm from opioid therapy and which patients will benefit from opioid therapy (7).\n\nDiscontinuing opioids after extended periods of continuous opioid use can be challenging for clinicians and patients. Tapering or discontinuing opioids in patients who have taken them long term can be associated with clinically significant risks (68), particularly if opioids are tapered rapidly or patients do not receive effective support.\n\nPatients, caregivers, and clinicians responded to CDC with invited input about their experiences and perspectives related to pain and pain management options. Themes included strained patient-clinician relationships and the need for patients and clinicians to make shared decisions, the effects of misapplication of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline, inconsistent access to effective pain management solutions, and achieving reduced prescription opioid use through diverse approaches.\n\nMembers of the public responded to CDC with invited comments. Themes included experiences with pain or experiences in the aftermath of the overdose of a friend, family member, or significant other; barriers and access to pain care and to evidence-based treatment; concerns about the level of specificity of recommendations; and overall communication and implementation of the clinical practice guideline.\n\nEach of the 12 recommendation statements is followed by considerations for implementation and a rationale for the recommendation. The implementation considerations offer practical insights, context, and specific examples meant to further inform clinician-patient decision-making for the respective recommendation and are not meant to be rigidly or inflexibly followed.\n\nThe recommendations are grouped into four areas:\n\nDetermining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain\n\nSelecting opioids and determining dosages\n\nDeciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up\n\nAssessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use\n\nIn addition, these five guiding principles should broadly inform implementation across recommendations (Box 4):\n\nAcute, subacute, and chronic pain needs to be appropriately assessed and treated independent of whether opioids are part of a treatment regimen.\n\nRecommendations are voluntary and are intended to support, not supplant, individualized, person-centered care. Flexibility to meet the care needs and the clinical circumstances of a specific patient is paramount.\n\nA multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management attending to the physical health, behavioral health, long-term services and supports, and expected health outcomes and well-being of each person is critical.\n\nSpecial attention should be given to avoid misapplying this clinical practice guideline beyond its intended use or implementing policies purportedly derived from it that might lead to unintended and potentially harmful consequences for patients.\n\nClinicians, practices, health systems, and payers should vigilantly attend to health inequities; provide culturally and linguistically appropriate communication (117), including communication that is accessible to persons with disabilities; and ensure access to an appropriate, affordable, diversified, coordinated, and effective nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic pain management regimen for all persons.\n\nDetermining Whether or Not to Initiate Opioids for Pain\n\nAll patients with pain should receive treatment that provides the greatest benefits relative to risks. (See Recommendation 1 for determining whether or not to initiate opioids for acute pain [i.e., pain lasting <1 month] and Recommendation 2 for determining whether or not to initiate opioids for subacute pain [i.e., pain lasting 1–3 months] or chronic pain [i.e., pain lasting >3 months].)\n\nRecommendation 1\n\nNonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common types of acute pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider opioid therapy for acute pain if benefits are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Before prescribing opioid therapy for acute pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 3).\n\nImplementation Considerations\n\nNonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common acute pain conditions, including low back pain, neck pain, pain related to other musculoskeletal injuries (e.g., sprains, strains, tendonitis, and bursitis), pain related to minor surgeries typically associated with minimal tissue injury and mild postoperative pain (e.g., simple dental extraction), dental pain, kidney stone pain, and headaches including episodic migraine.\n\nClinicians should maximize use of nonopioid pharmacologic (e.g., topical or oral NSAIDs, acetaminophen) and nonpharmacologic (e.g., ice, heat, elevation, rest, immobilization, or exercise) therapies as appropriate for the specific condition.\n\nOpioid therapy has an important role for acute pain related to severe traumatic injuries (including crush injuries and burns), invasive surgeries typically associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain, and other severe acute pain when NSAIDs and other therapies are contraindicated or likely to be ineffective.\n\nWhen diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant the use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioids (see Recommendation 3) at the lowest effective dose (see Recommendation 4) and for no longer than the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (see Recommendation 6).\n\nClinicians should prescribe and advise opioid use only as needed (e.g., hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg, one tablet not more frequently than every 4 hours as needed for moderate to severe pain) rather than on a scheduled basis (e.g., one tablet every 4 hours) and encourage and recommend an opioid taper if opioids are taken around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).\n\nIf patients already receiving opioids long term require additional medication for acute pain, nonopioid medications should be used when possible and, if additional opioids are required (e.g., for superimposed severe acute pain), they should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient’s baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).\n\nClinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients meaningfully in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy.\n\nSupporting Rationale\n\nEvaluation of the patient is critical to appropriate management. Evaluation can identify reversible causes of pain and underlying etiologies with potentially serious sequelae that require urgent action. To guide patient-specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish or confirm the diagnosis. Diagnosis can help identify interventions to reverse, ameliorate, or prevent worsening of pain and improve function (e.g., surgical intervention to repair structure and function after certain traumatic injuries, bracing to prevent recurrence of acute ankle sprain, fracture immobilization, ice or elevation to reduce swelling, and early mobilization to maintain function) (118).\n\nNoninvasive Nonpharmacologic Approaches to Acute Pain\n\nNoninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches to acute pain have the potential to improve pain and function without risk for serious harms (10). Clinical evidence reviews found that some nonpharmacologic treatments were likely effective for acute pain, such as heat therapy for acute low back pain; several others might be effective for specific acute pain conditions, such as spinal manipulation for acute back pain with radiculopathy, a cervical collar or exercise for acute neck pain with radiculopathy, acupressure for acute musculoskeletal pain, massage for postoperative pain (10), and remote electrical neuromodulation for acute pain related to episodic migraine (11).\n\nThe American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends nonpharmacologic treatment with superficial heat, massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation as a cornerstone of treatment for acute low back pain (119). ACP and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) suggest acupressure to improve pain and function and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation to reduce pain in patients with acute musculoskeletal injuries (120).\n\nDespite evidence supporting their use, noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies are not always or fully covered by insurance (43), and access and cost can be barriers, particularly for persons who are uninsured, have limited income, have transportation challenges, or live in rural areas where treatments are not available (121). Experts from OWG expressed concern about limited access to nonopioid pain management modalities, in part because of lack of availability or lack of coverage by payers, and emphasized improving access to nonopioid pain management modalities as a priority. Health insurers and health systems can contribute to improved pain management and reduced medication use by increasing access to noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies with evidence of effectiveness (9,43). Noninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches should be used as appropriate to alleviate acute pain, including ice and elevation to reduce swelling and discomfort from musculoskeletal injuries, heat to alleviate low back pain, and other modalities depending on the cause of the acute pain.\n\nNonopioid Medications for Acute Pain\n\nMany acute pain conditions often can be managed most effectively with nonopioid medications (10,122). A systematic review found that for musculoskeletal injuries such as sprains, whiplash, and muscle strains, topical NSAIDs provided the greatest benefit-harm ratio, followed by oral NSAIDs or acetaminophen with or without diclofenac (122). NSAIDs have been found to be more effective than opioids for surgical dental pain and kidney stone pain and similarly effective to opioids for low back pain (10). Evidence is limited on comparative effectiveness of therapies for acute neuropathic pain, neck pain, and postoperative pain (10). For episodic migraine, triptans, NSAIDs, antiemetics, dihydroergotamine, calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists (gepants), and lasmiditan are associated with improved pain and function with usually mild and transient adverse events (11).\n\nACP recommends NSAIDs or skeletal muscle relaxants if pharmacologic treatment is desired to treat low back pain (119). For acute musculoskeletal injuries other than low back pain, ACP and AAFP recommend topical NSAIDs with or without menthol gel as first-line therapy and suggest oral NSAIDs to relieve pain or improve function or oral acetaminophen to reduce pain (120). The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends NSAIDs as first-line treatment for acute dental pain management (123). For acute kidney stone pain, NSAIDs are at least as effective as opioids (124–127), can decrease the ureteral smooth muscle tone and ureteral spasm (128) causing kidney stone pain, and are preferred for kidney stone pain if not contraindicated. Triptans, NSAIDs, combined triptans with NSAIDs, antiemetics, dihydroergotamine, and acetaminophen are established acute treatments for migraine (11). Lasmiditan, an 5-HT1F receptor agonist, and ubrogepant, a gepant, were approved by FDA in 2019 for the treatment of migraine (129); another gepant, rimegepant, was approved in 2020. Lasmiditan and the gepants were more effective than placebo in providing pain relief at 2 hours, 1 day, and 1 week (11). Adverse events related to these newer medications require further study; however, their mechanisms of action are believed to be nonvasoconstrictive (130) and potentially carry lower risks than vasoactive medications in patients with cardiovascular risk factors (11).\n\nWhen not contraindicated, NSAIDs should be used for low back pain, painful musculoskeletal injuries (including minor pain related to fractures), dental pain, postoperative pain, and kidney stone pain; triptans, NSAIDs, or their combinations should be used along with antiemetics as needed for acute pain related to episodic migraine. NSAID use has been associated with serious gastrointestinal events and major coronary events (8), particularly in patients with cardiovascular or gastrointestinal comorbidities, and clinicians should weigh risks and benefits of use, dose, and duration of NSAIDs when treating older adults as well as patients with hypertension, renal insufficiency, heart failure, or those with risk for peptic ulcer disease or cardiovascular disease. Vasoactive effects of triptans and ergot alkaloids might preclude their use in patients with migraine who also have cardiovascular risk factors (11,131,132). Clinicians should review FDA-approved labeling, including boxed warnings, before initiating treatment with any pharmacologic therapy.\n\nPain Management for Pregnant and Postpartum Persons\n\nFor pain management in the postpartum period, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends stepwise, multimodal, shared decision-making, incorporating pharmacologic treatments that might include opioids. After vaginal delivery, ACOG recommends acetaminophen or NSAIDs, and if needed, adding an opioid. After cesarean delivery, ACOG recommends standard oral and parenteral medications such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs, or low-dose, low-potency, short-acting opioids with duration of opioid use limited to the shortest reasonable course expected for treating acute pain (133). ACOG recommends counseling persons who are prescribed opioids about the risk for central nervous system depression in the postpartum person and in the breastfed infant (133), noting that if a codeine-containing medication is selected, duration of therapy and neonatal signs of toxicity should be reviewed with patients and their families (133).\n\nOpioid Medication for Acute Pain\n\nA systematic review found that for musculoskeletal injuries such as sprains, whiplash, and muscle strains, no opioid provided better benefit than NSAIDs, and opioid use caused the most harms (122). The evidence review (10) found that opioids might not be more effective than nonopioid therapies for some acute pain conditions (134–138), and use of opioids might negatively affect recovery and function (139,140). The review found that opioids were probably less effective than NSAIDs for surgical dental pain and kidney stone pain, less effective than acetaminophen for kidney stone pain, and similarly effective as NSAIDs for low back pain (10). For postoperative pain, effects of opioids on pain intensity were inconsistent, and opioids were associated with increased likelihood of repeat or rescue analgesic use (10). Evidence was insufficient for opioids in treatment of episodic migraine (11). Compared with NSAIDs or acetaminophen, opioids were associated with increased risk for short-term adverse events, including any adverse event, nausea, dizziness, and somnolence (10). Observational studies found that opioid use for acute low back pain or postoperative pain was associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use (10). Proportions of adults with new long-term opioid use at follow-up after initiation for short-term use for postoperative pain have ranged from <1% to 13% (141–146). Odds of long-term opioid use at follow-up after initiation for short-term use for acute pain might be greater with higher dosage and longer initial duration of exposure. For example, one study found that, compared with no early opioid use for acute low back pain, the adjusted odds ratio was 2.08 (95% CI: 1.55–2.78) for an early prescription totaling 1–140 MME and increased to 6.14 (95% CI: 4.92–7.66) for an early prescription totaling ≥450 MME (140). In episodic migraine, opioids as well as butalbital-containing medications were associated with a twofold higher risk for development of medication overuse headache compared with simple analgesics and triptans (11,147). Serious adverse events were uncommon for opioids and other medications; however, studies were not designed to assess risk for overdose, opioid use disorder, or long-term harms (10).\n\nFor acute low back pain, ACP found insufficient evidence for effectiveness of opioids and recommends nonopioid medications (see Nonopioid Medications for Acute Pain) if choosing pharmacologic treatment (119). ACP and AAFP suggest against treating patients with acute pain from musculoskeletal injuries with opioids, including tramadol (120). ADA recommends NSAIDs as the first-line therapy for acute pain management (see Nonopioid Medications for Acute Pain) (123). Multiple guidelines that address prescribing for postoperative pain include both nonopioid and opioid treatment options and have emphasized multimodal analgesia, incorporating around-the-clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies and noting that systemic opioids often are needed postoperatively but are not required in all patients (148–151). The American Headache Society recommends against prescribing opioid or butalbital-containing medications as first-line treatment for recurrent headache disorders (152), and the American Academy of Neurology also recommends against use of both of these classes of medications for treatment of migraine, except as a last resort (153).\n\nBecause of equivalent or lesser effectiveness for pain relief compared with NSAIDs and risks for long-term opioid use after using opioids for acute pain, opioids are not recommended as first-line therapy for many common acute pain conditions, including low back pain, neck pain, pain related to other musculoskeletal injuries (e.g., sprains, strains, tendonitis, and bursitis), pain related to minor surgeries typically associated with minimal tissue injury and only mild postoperative pain (e.g., simple dental extraction), dental pain, kidney stone pain, and headaches including episodic migraine. Opioid therapy has an important role for acute pain related to severe traumatic injuries (including crush injuries and burns), invasive surgeries typically associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain, and other severe acute pain when NSAIDs and other therapies are contraindicated or likely to be ineffective.\n\nWhen diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant the use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioids (see Recommendation 3) at the lowest effective dose (see Recommendation 4) and for no longer than the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (see Recommendation 6) to minimize unintentional initiation of long-term opioid use. Clinicians should maximize use of nonopioid pharmacologic (e.g., NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or both) and nonpharmacologic (e.g., ice, heat, elevation, rest, immobilization, or exercise) therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and continue these therapies as needed after opioids are discontinued. Clinicians should work with patients to prevent prolonged opioid use, prescribe and advise opioid use only as needed (e.g., hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg, one tablet not more frequently than every 4 hours as needed for moderate to severe pain) rather than on a scheduled basis (e.g., one tablet every 4 hours), and encourage and include an opioid taper if opioids will be taken around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6). Clinicians should consider concurrent medical conditions, including sleep apnea, pregnancy, renal or hepatic insufficiency, mental health conditions, and substance use disorders, in assessing risks of opioid therapy (see Recommendation 8); offer naloxone, particularly if the patient or a household member has risk factors for opioid overdose (see Recommendation 8); use particular caution when prescribing benzodiazepines or other sedating medications with opioid pain medication (see Recommendation 11); and check the prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) database to ensure a new opioid prescription will not contribute to cumulative opioid dosages or medication combinations that put the patient at risk for overdose (see Recommendation 9). If signs of opioid use disorder are present, clinicians should address concerns with the patient, offer or arrange medication treatment for patients who meet criteria for opioid use disorder, and use nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments as appropriate to manage the patient’s pain (see Recommendation 12 and the ASAM National Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder: 2020 Focused Update) (96).\n\nAlthough findings regarding risks for new long-term opioid use after use for acute pain (10) relate specifically to patients who were previously opioid naïve, risks also might be associated with dosage escalation (see Recommendation 4) if patients already treated with long-term opioids are prescribed additional opioid medication for new acute pain superimposed on chronic pain. Therefore, strategies that minimize opioid use should be implemented for both opioid-naïve and opioid-tolerant patients with acute pain when possible. If patients receiving long-term opioid therapy require additional medication for acute pain, nonopioid medications should be used when possible. If additional opioids are required (e.g., for superimposed severe acute pain), they should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient’s baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including an appropriate taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).\n\nPatient education and discussion before starting outpatient opioid therapy are critical so that patient preferences and values can be understood and used to inform clinical decisions. Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy. Essential elements for communication and discussion with patients before prescribing outpatient opioid therapy for acute pain include the following:\n\nAdvise patients that short-term opioid use can lead to unintended long-term opioid use and of the importance of working toward planned discontinuation of opioid use as soon as feasible, including a plan to appropriately taper opioids as pain resolves if opioids have been used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).\n\nReview communication mechanisms and protocols patients can use to tell clinicians of severe or uncontrolled pain and to arrange for timely reassessment and management.\n\nAdvise patients about serious adverse effects of opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory depression and development of a potentially serious opioid use disorder (see Recommendation 12) that can cause distress and inability to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.\n\nAdvise patients about common effects of opioids, such as constipation, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, tolerance, physical dependence, and withdrawal symptoms when stopping opioids. To prevent constipation associated with opioid use, advise patients to increase hydration and fiber intake and to maintain or increase physical activity as they are able. Prophylactic pharmacologic therapy (e.g., a stimulant laxative such as senna, with or without a stool softener) might be needed to ensure regular bowel movements if opioids are used for more than a few days. Stool softeners or fiber laxatives without another laxative should be avoided. To minimize withdrawal symptoms, clinicians should provide and discuss an opioid tapering plan when opioids will be used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6). Limiting opioid use to the minimum needed to manage pain (e.g., taking the opioid only when needed if needed less frequently than every 4 hours and the prescription is written for every 4 hours as needed for pain) can help limit development of tolerance and therefore withdrawal after opioids are discontinued.\n\nIf formulations are prescribed that combine opioids with acetaminophen, advise patients of the risks of taking additional over-the-counter products containing acetaminophen.\n\nTo help patients assess when a dose of opioids is needed, explain that the goal is to reduce pain to make it manageable rather than to eliminate pain.\n\nDiscuss effects that opioids might have on a person’s ability to safely operate a vehicle or other machinery, particularly when opioids are initiated or when other central nervous system depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines or alcohol) are used concurrently.\n\nDiscuss the potential for workplace toxicology testing programs to detect therapeutic opioid use.\n\nDiscuss increased risks for opioid use disorder, respiratory depression, and death at higher dosages, along with the importance of taking only the amount of opioids prescribed (i.e., not taking more opioids than prescribed or taking them more often).\n\nReview increased risks for respiratory depression when opioids are taken with benzodiazepines, other sedatives, alcohol, nonprescribed or illicit drugs (e.g., heroin), or other opioids (see Recommendations 8 and 11).\n\nDiscuss risks to household members and other persons if opioids are intentionally or unintentionally shared with others for whom they are not prescribed, including the possibility that others might experience overdose at the same or lower dosage than prescribed for the patient and that young children and pets are susceptible to unintentional ingestion. Discuss storage of opioids in a secure and preferably locked location, options for safe disposal of unused opioids (154), and the value of having naloxone available.\n\nDiscuss planned use of precautions to reduce risks, including naloxone for overdose reversal (see Recommendation 8) and clinician use of PDMP information (see Recommendation 9).\n\nRecommendation 2\n\nNonopioid therapies are preferred for subacute and chronic pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider initiating opioid therapy if expected benefits for pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Before starting opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy, should work with patients to establish treatment goals for pain and function, and should consider how opioid therapy will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 2).\n\nImplementation Considerations\n\nTo guide patient-specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish or confirm the diagnosis.\n\nClinicians should recommend appropriate noninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches to help manage chronic pain, such as exercise (e.g., aerobic, aquatic, or resistance exercises) or exercise therapy (a prominent modality in physical therapy) for back pain, fibromyalgia, and hip or knee osteoarthritis; weight loss for knee osteoarthritis; manual therapies for hip osteoarthritis; psychological therapy, spinal manipulation, low-level laser therapy, massage, mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain; mind-body practices (e.g., yoga, tai chi, or qigong), massage, and acupuncture for neck pain; cognitive behavioral therapy, myofascial release massage, mindfulness practices, tai chi, qigong, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia; and spinal manipulation for tension headache.\n\nLow-cost options to integrate exercise include walking in public spaces or use of public recreation facilities for group exercise. Physical therapy can be helpful, particularly for patients who have limited access to safe public spaces or public recreation facilities for exercise or whose pain has not improved with low-intensity physical exercise.\n\nHealth insurers and health systems can improve pain management and reduce medication use and associated risks by increasing reimbursement for and access to noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies with evidence for effectiveness.\n\nClinicians should review FDA-approved labeling, including boxed warnings, and weigh benefits and risks before initiating treatment with any pharmacologic therapy.\n\nWhen patients affected by osteoarthritis have an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic interventions such as exercise for arthritis pain, topical NSAIDs can be used in patients with pain in a single or few joints near the surface of the skin (e.g., knee). For patients with osteoarthritis pain in multiple joints or incompletely controlled with topical NSAIDs, duloxetine or systemic NSAIDs can be considered.\n\nNSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose and shortest duration needed and should be used with caution, particularly in older adults and in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, chronic renal failure, or previous gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nWhen patients with chronic low back pain have had an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic approaches such as exercise, clinicians can consider NSAIDs or duloxetine for patients without contraindications.\n\nTricyclic, tetracyclic, and SNRI antidepressants; selected anticonvulsants (e.g., pregabalin, gabapentin enacarbil, oxcarbazepine); and capsaicin and lidocaine patches can be considered for neuropathic pain. In older adults, decisions to use tricyclic antidepressants should be made judiciously on a case-by-case basis because of risks for confusion and falls.\n\nDuloxetine and pregabalin are FDA-approved for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and pregabalin and gabapentin are FDA-approved for treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.\n\nIn patients with fibromyalgia, tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) and SNRI antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine, milnacipran), NSAIDs (e.g., topical diclofenac), and specific anticonvulsants (i.e., pregabalin and gabapentin) are used to improve pain, function, and quality of life. Duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin are FDA-approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia. In older adults, decisions to use tricyclic antidepressants should be made judiciously on a case-by-case basis because of risks for confusion and falls.\n\nPatients with co-occurring pain and depression might be especially likely to benefit from antidepressant medication (see Recommendation 8).\n\nOpioids should not be considered first-line or routine therapy for subacute or chronic pain. This does not mean that patients should be required to sequentially fail nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or be required to use any specific treatment before proceeding to opioid therapy. Rather, expected benefits specific to the clinical context should be weighed against risks before initiating therapy. In some clinical contexts (e.g., serious illness in a patient with poor prognosis for return to previous level of function, contraindications to other therapies, and clinician and patient agreement that the overriding goal is patient comfort), opioids might be appropriate regardless of previous therapies used. In other situations (e.g., headache or fibromyalgia), expected benefits of initiating opioids are unlikely to outweigh risks regardless of previous nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies used.\n\nOpioid therapy should not be initiated without consideration by the clinician and patient of an exit strategy to be used if opioid therapy is unsuccessful.\n\nBefore opioid therapy is initiated for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should determine jointly with patients how functional benefit will be evaluated and establish specific, measurable treatment goals.\n\nFor patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for ≥30 days, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after informed discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach.\n\nClinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy. Clinicians should avoid rapid tapering or abrupt discontinuation of opioids (see Recommendation 5).\n\nPatient education and discussion before starting opioid therapy are critical so that patient preferences and values can be understood and used to inform clinical decisions.\n\nClinicians should review available low-cost options for pain management for all patients and particularly for patients who have low incomes, do not have health insurance, or have inadequate insurance.\n\nClinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy.\n\nSupporting Rationale\n\nTo guide patient-specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish or confirm the diagnosis (155). Detailed recommendations on diagnosis are provided in other guidelines (156–159). Evaluation should include a focused history, including history and characteristics of pain and potential contributing factors (e.g., function, work history and current work demands, psychosocial stressors, and sleep), and physical examination, with imaging or other diagnostic testing only if indicated (e.g., if severe or progressive neurologic deficits are present or if serious underlying conditions are suspected) (158,159). For complex pain syndromes, consultation with a pain specialist can be considered to assist with diagnosis and management.\n\nDiagnosis can help identify disease-specific interventions to reverse, ameliorate, or prevent worsening of pain and improve function (e.g., improving glucose control to prevent progression of diabetic neuropathy; immune-modulating agents for rheumatoid arthritis; physical or occupational therapy to address posture, muscle weakness, or repetitive occupational motions that contribute to musculoskeletal pain; or surgical intervention to relieve severe mechanical or compressive pain) (159). The underlying mechanism for most pain syndromes has traditionally been categorized as neuropathic (e.g., diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia) or nociceptive (e.g., osteoarthritis and muscular back pain). More recently, nociplastic pain has been suggested as a third, distinct category of pain with augmented central nervous system pain and sensory processing and altered pain modulation as experienced in conditions such as fibromyalgia (160). The diagnosis and pathophysiologic mechanism of pain have implications for symptomatic pain treatment with medication. For example, evidence is limited for improved pain or function, or evidence exists of worse outcomes, with long-term use of opioids for several chronic pain conditions for which opioids are commonly prescribed, such as osteoarthritis (161), nonspecific low back pain (119,162), headache (152), and fibromyalgia (163,164). For moderate to severe chronic back pain or hip or knee osteoarthritis pain, a nonopioid strategy starting with acetaminophen or NSAIDs results in improved pain intensity with fewer side effects compared with a strategy starting with opioids (74). Tricyclic antidepressants, SNRI antidepressants, selected anticonvulsants, or transdermal lidocaine are recommended for neuropathic pain syndromes (e.g., diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia) (156).\n\nReview of the patient’s history and context beyond the presenting pain syndrome is helpful in selection of pain treatments. In particular, medications should be used only after assessment and determination that expected benefits outweigh risks, considering patient-specific factors. For example, clinicians should consider fall risk when selecting and dosing potentially sedating medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioids) and should weigh benefits and risks of use, dosage, and duration of NSAIDs when treating older adults and patients with hypertension, renal insufficiency, heart failure, or those with risk for peptic ulcer disease or cardiovascular disease. NSAIDs are potentially inappropriate for use in older adults with chronic pain because of higher risk for adverse effects with prolonged use (165). Some guidelines recommend topical NSAIDs for localized osteoarthritis (e.g., knee osteoarthritis) over oral NSAIDs in patients aged ≥75 years to minimize systemic effects (166). (See Recommendation 8 for additional considerations for assessing risks of opioid therapy.)\n\nNoninvasive Nonpharmacologic Approaches to Subacute and Chronic Pain\n\nMany noninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches, including physical therapy, weight loss for knee osteoarthritis, and behavioral therapies (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction), can improve pain and function without risk for serious harms (9). High-quality evidence exists that exercise therapy (a prominent modality in physical therapy) for back pain, fibromyalgia, and hip or knee osteoarthritis reduces pain and improves function immediately after treatment and that the improvements are sustained for at least 2–6 months (9,167–170). Previous guidelines have recommended aerobic, aquatic, or resistance exercises for persons with chronic pain, including osteoarthritis of the knee or hip, back pain, and fibromyalgia (119,156,166,171). Other noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies that improve pain, function, or both for at least 1 month after delivery without apparent risk for serious harm include cognitive behavioral therapy for knee osteoarthritis; manual therapies for hip osteoarthritis; psychological therapy, spinal manipulation, low-level laser therapy, massage, mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain; mind-body practices (e.g., yoga, tai chi, and qigong), massage, and acupuncture for neck pain; cognitive behavioral therapy, myofascial release massage, mindfulness practices, tai chi, qigong, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia; and spinal manipulation for tension headache (9). For temporomandibular disorder pain, patient education and self-care can be effective, as can occlusal splints for some patients and biobehavioral therapy for prevention of disabling symptoms (172,173). Exercise, mind-body interventions, and behavioral treatments (including cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness practices) can encourage active patient participation in the care plan and help address the effects of pain in the patient’s life; these active therapies have somewhat more robust evidence for sustained improvements in pain and function than more passive treatments (e.g., massage), particularly at longer-term follow-up (9). In addition, physical activity can provide additional health benefits, such as preventing or reducing symptoms of depression (174). Active approaches that engage the patient should be used when possible, with a supplementary role for more passive approaches, to reduce pain and improve function.\n\nDespite their favorable benefit-to-risk profile, noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies are not always covered or fully covered by insurance (43). Access and cost can be barriers for patients, particularly persons who have low incomes, do not have health insurance or have inadequate insurance, have transportation challenges, or live in rural areas where services might not be available (121). Health insurers and health systems can improve pain management and reduce medication use and associated risks by increasing reimbursement for and access to noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies with evidence for effectiveness (9,43). In addition, for many patients, aspects of these approaches can be used even when access to specialty care is limited. For example, previous guidelines have strongly recommended aerobic, aquatic, or resistance exercises for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip (166) and maintenance of physical activity, including normal daily activities, for patients with low back pain (158). A randomized trial found no difference in reduced chronic low back pain intensity, frequency, or disability between patients assigned to relatively low-cost group aerobics and those assigned to individual physiotherapy or muscle reconditioning sessions (175). Low-cost options to integrate exercise include walking in public spaces or use of public recreation facilities for group exercise. Physical therapy can be helpful, particularly for patients who have limited access to safe public spaces or public recreation facilities for exercise or whose pain has not improved with low-intensity physical exercise. A randomized trial found a stepped exercise program, in which patients were initially offered an Internet-based exercise program and progressively advanced to biweekly coaching calls and then to in-person physical therapy if not improved at previous steps, successfully improved symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, with 35% of patients ultimately requiring in-person physical therapy (176). In addition, primary care clinicians can integrate elements of psychosocial therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy, which addresses psychosocial contributors to pain and improves function (177), by encouraging patients to take an active role in the care plan, supporting patients in engaging in activities such as exercise that are typically beneficial but that might initially be associated with fear of exacerbating pain (159), or providing education in relaxation techniques and coping strategies. In many locations, free or low-cost patient support, self-help, and educational community-based or employer-sponsored programs are available that can provide stress reduction and other mental health benefits. Clinicians should become familiar with such options within their communities so they can refer patients to low-cost services. Patients with higher levels of anxiety or fear related to pain or other clinically significant psychological distress can be referred for treatment with a mental health specialist (e.g., psychologist, psychiatrist, or clinical social worker).\n\nNonopioid Medications for Subacute and Chronic Pain\n\nSeveral nonopioid pharmacologic therapies (including acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and selected antidepressants and anticonvulsants) are used for painful symptoms in chronic pain conditions. Nonopioid pharmacologic therapies are associated with risks, particularly in older adults, pregnant patients, and patients with certain comorbidities such as cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, and liver disease. For example, NSAID use has been associated with serious gastrointestinal events and major coronary events (8). Increases in nonserious adverse events have been found with anticonvulsants pregabalin (blurred vision, cognitive effects, sedation, weight gain, dizziness, and peripheral edema) and gabapentin (blurred vision, cognitive effects, sedation, and weight gain), cannabis (nausea and dizziness), and SNRI antidepressants duloxetine (nausea and sedation) and milnacipran (nausea); dosage reductions reduced the risk for some adverse events with SNRI antidepressants (8). Clinicians should review FDA-approved labeling, including boxed warnings, before initiating treatment with any pharmacologic therapy.\n\nFor osteoarthritis, NSAIDs including topical NSAIDs and SNRI antidepressant duloxetine have small to moderate benefits for pain and function at short-term assessment (3–6 months), with intermediate-term (6–12 months) evidence for certain medications (celecoxib and duloxetine) and evidence that duloxetine is more effective in older (>65 years) than younger patients and in patients with knee osteoarthritis (8). Acetaminophen has limited evidence for effectiveness (8) and is no longer considered a first-line treatment for osteoarthritis (161). When patients have an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic interventions (e.g., exercise for arthritis pain), and if a single or a few joints near the surface of the skin (e.g., knee) are affected by osteoarthritis, use of topical NSAIDs is recommended (161). In patients with osteoarthritis pain in multiple joints or incompletely controlled pain with topical NSAIDs, systemic NSAIDs or duloxetine can be used. However, systemic NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dosage and shortest duration needed because risks might increase with longer use and at higher dosages (178).\n\nOral NSAIDs should be used with caution, particularly in older persons and in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, chronic renal failure, or previous gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with gastrointestinal comorbidities but without current or previous gastrointestinal bleeding, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors or NSAIDs with proton pump inhibitors can be used to minimize risk compared with risk with use of NSAIDs alone (161).\n\nModerate-quality evidence demonstrates small improvements in chronic low back pain with NSAIDs (119) and with duloxetine (8). When patients with low back pain have had an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic approaches such as exercise, clinicians can consider NSAIDs or duloxetine (119) for patients without contraindications.\n\nFor temporomandibular disorder pain that is not sufficiently improved with nonpharmacologic interventions, NSAIDs can be effective (179,180). Tricyclic, tetracyclic, and SNRI antidepressants; selected anticonvulsants; and capsaicin and lidocaine patches are recommended for neuropathic pain (156). However, evidence on topical lidocaine and capsaicin is limited (8). SNRI antidepressant duloxetine and anticonvulsants pregabalin, gabapentin, enacarbil, and oxcarbazepine are associated with small improvements in neuropathic pain (mainly diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia) (8). Duloxetine and pregabalin are FDA-approved for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, and pregabalin and gabapentin are FDA-approved for treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.\n\nIn patients with fibromyalgia, multiple medications are associated with small to moderate improvements in pain, function, and quality of life, including SNRI antidepressants (duloxetine and milnacipran), NSAIDs (topical diclofenac), and specific anticonvulsants (pregabalin and gabapentin) (8). Tricyclic and SNRI antidepressants also can relieve fibromyalgia symptoms. Duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin are FDA-approved for and are recommended for the treatment of fibromyalgia (156). Tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline often is used and recommended for patients with fibromyalgia (156), although evidence for its effectiveness is limited (8). Because patients with chronic pain might experience concurrent depression (181) and depression can exacerbate physical symptoms including pain (182), patients with co-occurring pain and depression might be especially likely to benefit from antidepressant medication (see Recommendation 8).\n\nTricyclic antidepressants are potentially inappropriate for older adults (aged ≥65 years) because of their anticholinergic effects (165). Evidence on effectiveness of cannabis for painful conditions is limited and inconsistent across studies, and some studies have reported adverse events such as dizziness, nausea, and sedation (8,183).\n\nOpioid Medication for Subacute and Chronic Pain\n\nClinical evidence reviews found insufficient evidence to determine long-term benefits of opioid therapy for chronic pain and found an increased risk for serious harms related to long-term opioid therapy that appears to be dose dependent (7). Compared with no opioid use, opioid use was associated with increased risk for opioid use disorder, overdose, all-cause deaths, fractures, falls, and myocardial infarction (7). Opioids also were associated with increased risk for discontinuation because of gastrointestinal adverse events, somnolence, dizziness, and pruritus (7). Compared with placebo, at short-term follow-up (1 to <6 months), opioids were associated with small mean improvements in pain intensity (mean difference: −0.79 on a 0–10 scale; 95% CI: −0.93 to −0.67; I2: 71%) and function (7). Some evidence indicates that improvement in pain is reduced with longer duration of opioid therapy, from a mean improvement of 1 on a 0–10 scale at 1–3 months to approximately 0.5 at 3–6 months (7). No placebo-controlled trial evaluated effectiveness of opioids at intermediate (6 to <12 months) or long-term (≥12 months) follow-up (7). Compared with nonopioid treatments at short-term follow-up, there were no differences in mean pain improvement (mean difference: −0.29 on a 0–10 scale; 95% CI: −0.61 to 0.03) or functional improvement. No trials were identified that compared opioids with nonopioid therapies at intermediate- or long-term follow-up, with the exception of one trial that found stepped therapy starting with opioids to be associated with higher pain intensity than stepped therapy starting with nonopioids (4.0 versus 3.5; mean difference: 0.5; 95% CI: 0–1.0) at 12 months (7,74).\n\nClinical evidence reviews identified an observational study (54) finding long-term (>90 days’ supply) opioid prescription to be associated with considerably increased risk for a new opioid use disorder diagnosis for all dosages of long-term (>90 days’ supply) opioids prescribed compared with no opioids prescribed, with adjusted odds ratios of 15, 29, and 122 at low (1–36 MME/day), medium (36–120 MME/day), and high (≥120 MME/day) opioid dosages, respectively. Compared with no opioid use, opioid use was associated with increased risk for opioid use disorder, overdose, all-cause deaths, fractures, falls, and myocardial infarction (7).\n\nMultiple experts from OWG stated that they appreciated this recommendation because of the importance of highlighting both pain and function, sharing realistic expectations with patients before initiating treatment, and paying attention to tapering and exit strategies. Although some experts reasoned the recommendation statement could state nonopioid therapies “may be preferred” or “may be effective” for chronic pain, others agreed with language that nonopioid therapies “are preferred” for chronic pain because opioid therapies are associated with small short-term benefits compared with placebo, comparable or reduced short-term benefits compared with nonopioid therapies, uncertain long-term benefits, and potential for serious harms.\n\nOpioids should not be considered first-line or routine therapy for subacute or chronic pain. Although evidence on long-term benefits of nonopioid therapies also is limited, these therapies also are associated with short-term benefits, no evidence exists for attenuated benefit over time or difficulty stopping therapy when benefits do not outweigh risks, and risks for serious harms are usually lower. This does not mean that patients should be required to sequentially fail nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or be required to use any specific treatment before proceeding to opioid therapy. Rather, expected benefits specific to the clinical context should be weighed against risks before initiating therapy. In some clinical contexts (e.g., serious illness in a patient with poor prognosis for return to previous level of function, contraindications to other therapies, and clinician and patient agreement that the overriding goal is patient comfort), opioids might be appropriate regardless of previous therapies used. In other situations (e.g., headache or fibromyalgia), expected benefits of initiating opioids are unlikely to outweigh risks regardless of previous nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies used.\n\nClinical evidence reviews found no instrument with high accuracy for predicting opioid-related harms, such as overdose or opioid use disorder (7). For clinicians, predicting whether benefits of opioids for chronic pain will outweigh risks of ongoing opioid treatment for individual patients can be challenging. Therefore, opioid therapy should only be initiated with consideration by the clinician and patient of an exit strategy that could be used if opioid therapy is unsuccessful in improving pain and pain-related function.\n\nBefore opioid therapy is initiated for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should determine with patients how functional benefit will be evaluated and establish treatment goals. Some patients have reported treatment goals are effective in increasing motivation and functioning (7). Goals ideally include improvement in function (including social, emotional, and physical dimensions), pain, and quality of life. Goals can be tailored to specific patient and clinical circumstances. For example, for some patients with diseases typically associated with progressive functional impairment or catastrophic injuries such as spinal cord trauma, reductions in pain without improvement in physical function might be more realistic. Clinicians can assess and then follow function, pain severity, and quality of life using tools such as the three-item PEG (Pain average, interference with Enjoyment of life, and interference with General activity) assessment scale (184) (see Recommendation 7). Clinically meaningful improvement has been defined as a 30% improvement in scores for both pain and function (185). Clinicians can ask patients about functional goals that have meaning for them (e.g., walking the dog or walking around the block, returning to part-time work, and attending family events or recreational activities), and then use these goals in assessing benefits of opioid therapy and weighing benefits against risks of continued opioid therapy for individual patients (see Recommendation 7).\n\nPatients with subacute pain might be at a particularly critical point, both for potential transition to chronic pain and potential transition to long-term opioid therapy. Clinicians should reevaluate patients with subacute pain and their treatment course, ensure that potentially reversible causes of ongoing pain are addressed, and optimize pain management as needed. For patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for ≥30 days, clinicians should ensure that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid prescribing simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after informed discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach.\n\nClinicians seeing new patients already using opioid medication should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy. Clinicians should avoid rapid tapering or abrupt discontinuation of opioids (see Recommendation 5). Although the clinical evidence reviews did not find studies evaluating the effectiveness of written agreements or treatment plans (7), clinicians and patients who clearly document a treatment plan including specific functional goals in advance of prescribing will clarify expectations about how opioids will be prescribed and monitored with an aim to improve patient safety, health, and well-being.\n\nPatient education and discussion before starting opioid therapy are critical so that patient preferences and values can be understood and used to inform clinical decisions. Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy. Many patients rank pain relief, nausea, vomiting, and constipation as important effects (7). The following elements are essential for communication and discussion with patients before starting opioid therapy:\n\nReview available low-cost options for pain management for all patients, and particularly for patients who have low incomes, do not have health insurance, or have inadequate insurance. Review considerations related to access to care because of the clinical oversight needed to initiate and continue opioid therapy and other treatments for pain.\n\nBe explicit and realistic about expected benefits of opioids, explaining that there is not robust evidence that opioids improve pain or function with long-term use and that complete elimination of pain is unlikely.\n\nEmphasize improvement in function as a primary goal and that function can improve even when pain is not eliminated.\n\nAdvise patients about serious adverse effects of opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory depression and development of a potentially serious opioid use disorder that can cause distress and inability to fulfill major obligations at work, school, or home.\n\nAdvise patients about common effects of opioids, such as constipation, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, tolerance, physical dependence, and withdrawal symptoms when stopping opioids. To prevent constipation associated with opioid use, advise patients to increase hydration and fiber intake and to maintain or increase physical activity. Prophylactic pharmacologic therapy (e.g., a stimulant laxative such as senna, with or without a stool softener) is usually needed to ensure regular bowel movements if opioids are taken regularly. Stool softeners or fiber laxatives without another laxative should be avoided.\n\nIf formulations are prescribed that combine opioids with acetaminophen, advise patients of the risks for taking additional over-the-counter products containing acetaminophen.\n\nDiscuss effects that opioids might have on ability to safely operate a vehicle or other machinery, particularly when opioids are initiated, when dosages are increased, or when other central nervous system depressants, such as benzodiazepines or alcohol, are used concurrently.\n\nDiscuss the potential for workplace toxicology testing programs to detect therapeutic opioid use.\n\nDiscuss increased risks for opioid use disorder, respiratory depression, and death at higher dosages, along with the importance of taking only the amount of opioids prescribed (i.e., not taking more opioids than prescribed or taking them more often).\n\nReview increased risks for respiratory depression when opioids are taken with benzodiazepines, other sedatives, alcohol, nonprescribed drugs such as heroin, or other opioids.\n\nDiscuss risks for household members and other persons if opioids are intentionally or unintentionally shared with others for whom they are not prescribed, including the possibility that others might experience overdose at the same or at lower dosage than prescribed for the patient and that young children are susceptible to unintentional ingestion. Discuss storage of opioids in a secure, preferably locked location and options for safe disposal of unused opioids (154).\n\nDiscuss the importance of periodic reassessment to ensure that opioids are helping to meet patient goals and, if opioids are not effective or are harmful, to allow opportunities for consideration of opioid tapering and dosage reduction or discontinuation and of additional nonpharmacologic or nonopioid pharmacologic treatment options.\n\nDiscuss expectations for clinician and patient responsibilities to mitigate risks of opioid therapy and planned use of precautions to reduce risks, including naloxone for overdose reversal (see Recommendation 8) and clinician use of PDMP information (see Recommendation 9) and toxicology screening (see Recommendation 10).\n\nConsider whether cognitive status might interfere with management of opioid therapy and, if so, determine whether a caregiver can responsibly comanage medication therapy. Discuss the importance of reassessing medication use over time with both the patient and caregiver, as appropriate.\n\nBecause of the possibility that benefits of opioid therapy might diminish or that risks might become more prominent over time, clinicians should elicit patients’ experiences and preferences and review expected benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients periodically (see Recommendation 7).\n\nInterventional Approaches to Subacute and Chronic Pain\n\nOffice-based interventional approaches, such as arthrocentesis and intra-articular glucocorticoid injection for pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis (186) or osteoarthritis (187) and subacromial corticosteroid injection for rotator cuff disease (188), can provide short-term improvement in pain and function to supplement or facilitate exercise, physical therapy, and other conservative approaches. Evidence is insufficient to determine the extent to which repeated glucocorticoid injection increases potential risks such as articular cartilage changes (in osteoarthritis) and sepsis (187).\n\nInterventional pain management specialists offer additional interventions that can alleviate pain as part of a comprehensive pain management approach (6) for patients with indications including back pain, persistent pain after spinal surgery, neuropathic pain, and complex regional pain syndrome. Certain more common procedures include epidural steroid injections (for lumbar radiculopathy with herniated disc), nerve ablation procedures (e.g., radiofrequency denervation for low back pain), and neurostimulation procedures (e.g., peripheral nerve stimulation and spinal cord stimulation). Descriptions of common interventional procedures are available (6). Level of evidence for effectiveness and risks varies by procedure, and additional research is needed to establish the clinical benefits as well as risks of specific interventional procedures for specific pain conditions (6,189) compared with risks of opioid pain medications and other pharmacologic therapies. Rare, serious adverse events have been reported with epidural injection (190). Interventional procedures should be performed by properly trained clinicians following meticulous infection control protocols. Clinicians can consult with a qualified pain management specialist who is well versed in benefits and risks of diagnostic and therapeutic options to determine potential appropriateness of specific interventional procedures for their patients’ indications and clinical circumstances.\n\nMultimodal Therapy for Subacute and Chronic Pain\n\nIntegrated pain management requires coordination of medical, psychological, and social aspects of health care and includes primary care, mental and behavioral health care, and specialist services when needed (191). Multimodal therapies and multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (e.g., combining psychological therapies with exercise) can reduce long-term pain and disability compared with usual care and compared with physical treatments (e.g., exercise) alone. Nonpharmacologic therapies also can provide synergistic benefits when nonopioid or opioid pain medications are used (6). When needed, medications should ideally be combined with nonpharmacologic therapy to provide greater benefits to patients in improving pain and function. Multimodal therapies are not always available or reimbursed by insurance and can be time consuming and costly for patients, and disparities in abilities to access multimodal care exist (6). Evidence exists that less-intensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation can be similarly effective to high-intensity multidisciplinary rehabilitation (9). Multimodal therapies should be considered for patients not responding to single-modality therapy, and combinations should be tailored depending on patient needs, cost, convenience, and other individual factors.\n\nDepending on patient comorbidities and benefit-to-risk ratios in individual patients, combinations of medications (e.g., two nonopioid medications with different mechanisms of action or a nonopioid with an opioid medication) also might be used. In some cases, medication combinations might provide complementary or synergistic benefits and facilitate lower dosing of individual medications, as has been demonstrated in trials of patients with neuropathic pain (7). However, this approach should be used with caution to avoid synergistic risks of medications. For example, combinations of medications that depress the central nervous system and cause sedation (see Recommendation 11), such as an opioid with gabapentin, have been associated with increased risk for overdose compared with either medication alone (7).\n\nSelecting Opioids and Determining Opioid Dosages\n\nRecommendation 3\n\nWhen starting opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioids instead of extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioids (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).\n\nImplementation Considerations\n\nClinicians should not treat acute pain with ER/LA opioids or initiate opioid treatment for subacute or chronic pain with ER/LA opioids, and clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA opioids for intermittent or as-needed use.\n\nER/LA opioids should be reserved for severe, continuous pain. FDA has noted that some ER/LA opioids should be considered only for patients who have received certain dosages of opioids of immediate-release opioids daily for at least 1 week.\n\nWhen changing to an ER/LA opioid for a patient previously receiving a different immediate-release opioid, clinicians should consult product labeling and reduce total daily dosage to account for incomplete opioid cross-tolerance.\n\nClinicians should use additional caution with ER/LA opioids and consider a longer dosing interval when prescribing to patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction because decreased clearance of medications among these patients can lead to accumulation of drugs to toxic levels and persistence in the body for longer durations.\n\nMethadone should not be the first choice for an ER/LA opioid. Only clinicians who are familiar with methadone’s unique risk profile and who are prepared to educate and closely monitor their patients, including assessing risk for QT prolongation and considering electrocardiographic monitoring, should consider prescribing methadone for pain.\n\nOnly clinicians who are familiar with the dosing and absorption properties of the ER/LA opioid transdermal fentanyl and are prepared to educate their patients about its use should consider prescribing it.\n\nSupporting Rationale\n\nER/LA opioids include methadone, transdermal fentanyl, and extended-release versions of opioids such as oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and morphine. Clinical evidence reviews found that effects of opioids on short-term pain and function were generally consistent across duration of action (short- or long-acting) and opioid type (opioid agonist, partial agonist, or mixed mechanism [with mixed opioid and nonopioid mechanisms of action] agent), although five trials directly comparing different types of opioids found a mixed mechanism agent associated with greater pain relief versus a pure opioid agonist, with fewer nonserious adverse events (7). A fair-quality study demonstrated a higher risk for overdose among patients treated with ER/LA opioids than among those treated with immediate-release opioids, especially within the first 2 weeks of therapy, with relative risk decreasing with longer duration of exposure (7,192). Clinical evidence reviews did not find evidence that continuous, time-scheduled use of ER/LA opioids is more effective or safer than intermittent use of immediate-release opioids or that time-scheduled use of ER/ LA opioids reduces risk for opioid use disorder (7).\n\nIn 2014, FDA modified the labeling for ER/LA opioid pain medications, noting serious risks and recommending that ER/LA opioids be reserved for management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment when alternative treatment options (e.g., nonopioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain and not used as as-needed pain relievers (49). FDA also noted that some ER/LA opioids are only appropriate for opioid-tolerant patients, defined as patients who have received certain dosages of opioids (e.g., 60 mg daily of oral morphine, 30 mg daily of oral oxycodone, or equianalgesic dosages of other opioids) for at least 1 week (193). Time-scheduled opioid use can be associated with greater total average daily opioid dosage compared with intermittent, as-needed opioid use (194). Technologies have been used to prevent manipulation intended to defeat extended-release properties of ER/LA opioids and to prevent opioid use by unintended routes of administration, such as intravenous injection of oral opioids. FDA guidance for industry on evaluation and labeling of these “abuse-deterrent” opioids (195) indicates that these technologies, although they are expected to make manipulation of opioids more difficult or reduce the potent effects of manipulation, do not prevent opioid misuse or overdose through oral intake (the most common route of opioid misuse) and can still be misused by nonoral routes. The “abuse-deterrent” label does not indicate that there is no risk for misuse or opioid use disorder. No studies were found in the clinical evidence reviews assessing the effectiveness of “abuse-deterrent” technologies as a risk mitigation strategy for deterring or preventing opioid misuse, opioid use disorder, or overdose (7). Experts from OWG agreed with the recommendation for clinicians to initiate opioid treatment with immediate-release opioids instead of with ER/LA opioids and said they appreciated discussion of the lack of evidence for “abuse-deterrent” formulations.\n\nIn comparing different ER/LA formulations, clinical evidence reviews found inconsistent results for overdose risk with methadone versus other ER/LA opioids used for chronic pain, with two cohort studies of Medicaid beneficiaries finding methadone associated with increased risk for overdose or all-cause deaths versus morphine and one cohort study of U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs patients finding methadone to be associated with decreased risk (7). Methadone has been associated with disproportionate numbers of overdose deaths relative to the frequency with which it is prescribed for pain (196). In addition, methadone is associated with cardiac arrhythmias along with QT prolongation on the electrocardiogram, and it has complicated pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, including a long and variable half-life and peak respiratory depressant effect occurring later and lasting longer than peak analgesic effect (197–199). In regard to other ER/LA opioid formulations, the absorption and pharmacodynamics of transdermal fentanyl are complex, with gradually increasing serum concentration during the first part of the 72-hour dosing interval, and variable absorption affected by factors such as external heat. In addition, the dosing of transdermal fentanyl is in mcg/hour, which is not typical for a drug used by outpatients and can be confusing. These complexities might increase the risk for fatal overdose when methadone or transdermal fentanyl is prescribed.\n\nClinicians should not treat acute pain with ER/LA opioids or initiate opioid treatment for subacute or chronic pain with ER/LA opioids, and clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA opioids for intermittent use. Because of the longer half-life and longer duration of effects (e.g., respiratory depression) of ER/LA opioids (e.g., methadone, fentanyl patches, or extended-release versions of oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, or morphine), clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA opioids for the treatment of acute pain. ER/LA opioids should be reserved for severe, continuous pain and should be considered only for patients who have received certain dosages of immediate-release opioids daily (e.g., 60 mg daily of oral morphine, 30 mg daily of oral oxycodone, or equianalgesic dosages of other opioids) for at least 1 week (193). When changing to an ER/LA opioid for a patient previously receiving a different immediate-release opioid, clinicians should consult product labeling and reduce total daily dosage to account for incomplete opioid cross-tolerance. Clinicians should use additional caution with ER/LA opioids and consider a longer dosing interval when prescribing to patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction because decreased clearance of medications among these patients can lead to accumulation of medications to toxic levels and persistence in the body for longer durations. Although in certain situations clinicians might need to prescribe immediate-release and ER/LA opioids together (e.g., when transitioning patients from ER/LA opioids to immediate-release opioids by temporarily using lower dosages of both, for temporary postoperative use of short-term opioids in a patient already receiving ER/LA opioids, or in patients with opioid use disorder treated and stabilized on methadone who need short-acting opioids for acute pain), clinicians should consider the potential for increased overdose risk and use caution when prescribing immediate-release opioids in combination with ER/LA opioids.\n\nWhen an ER/LA opioid is prescribed, using one with predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics is preferred to minimize unintentional overdose risk. In particular, unique characteristics of methadone and transdermal fentanyl make safe prescribing of these medications for pain especially challenging. Methadone should not be the first choice for an ER/LA opioid. Only clinicians who are familiar with methadone’s unique risk profile and who are prepared to educate and closely monitor their patients, including risk assessment for QT prolongation and consideration of electrocardiographic monitoring, should consider prescribing methadone for pain. A clinical practice guideline regarding methadone prescribing for pain has been published previously (200). Because dosing effects of transdermal fentanyl often are misunderstood by both clinicians and patients, only clinicians who are familiar with its dosing and absorption properties of and are prepared to educate their patients about its use should consider prescribing transdermal fentanyl.\n\nRecommendation 4\n\nWhen opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage. If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, should carefully evaluate individual benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage, and should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 3).\n\nImplementation Considerations\n\nThe recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).\n\nWhen opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.\n\nFor patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the severity of pain and other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8).\n\nThe lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table).\n\nIf opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage and should generally avoid dosage increases when possible.\n\nMany patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to ≥50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.\n\nAdditional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage on the basis of individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.\n\nSupporting Rationale\n\nBenefits of high-dose opioids for pain are not well established. Few trials evaluated opioid dosages of ≥90 MME/day (7). Opioid dosages of 50–90 MME/day were associated with a minimally greater (below the threshold for small) improvement in mean pain intensity compared with dosages of <50 MME/day (mean difference: −0.26; 95% CI: −0.57 to −0.02); there was no difference in mean improvement in function (7). Analyses of placebo-controlled trials also found some evidence of a plateauing effect at ≥50 mg MME/day (7). One trial of more liberal dose escalation compared with maintenance of current dosage found no difference in outcomes related to pain or function (7).\n\nAt the same time, risks for serious harms related to opioid therapy, including opioid misuse, overdose, and death, increase at higher opioid dosage, without a single point below which there is no risk (201). One cohort study from the clinical evidence reviews found higher dosages of opioids were associated with increased risk for all-cause deaths; one cohort study found modest associations between higher dose of long-term opioid and increased risk for falls and major trauma; one case-control study found opioid dosages of >20 MME/day were associated with increased odds of road trauma injury when the analysis was restricted to drivers, with no dose-dependent association at dosages of >20 MME/day; and cohort studies found association between higher opioid dose and risk for various endocrinological adverse events (7). Patients on higher doses reported reliance on opioids despite ambivalence about their benefits (7).\n\nFour observational studies identified in the clinical evidence reviews consistently found an association between higher doses of long-term opioids and risk for overdose or overdose death (7). Opioid dosages for chronic pain of 50 to <100 MME/day in observational studies have been associated with increased risks for opioid overdose by factors of 1.9–4.6 compared with dosages of 1 to <20 MME/day, and dosages of ≥100 MME/day were found to be associated with increased risks for overdose 2.0–8.9 times the risk at 1 to <20 MME/day, after adjusting for confounders on the basis of demographics, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and other factors (55,202,203). When opioids are prescribed for acute pain, similar associations have been found, with dosages of 50 to <100 MME/day associated with 4.73 times the risk for overdose and dosages of ≥100 MME/day associated with 6.64 times the risk, compared with dosages of 1 to <20 MME/day (55). The MME cut points in these studies (e.g., 20 MME, 50 MME, and 100 MME) were selected by the authors for research purposes, and whereas their findings are consistent with progressive increases in overdose risk being associated with increases in prescribed opioid dosages, they do not demonstrate a specific dosage threshold below which opioids are never associated with overdose. In a national sample of Veterans Health Administration patients with chronic pain who were prescribed opioids, mean prescribed daily opioid dosage among patients who died from opioid overdose was 98 MME (median: 60 MME), compared with mean prescribed daily opioid dosage of 48 MME (median: 25 MME) among patients not experiencing fatal overdose (204). A narrative review conducted by FDA staff concluded that, although there is not a single dosage threshold below which overdose risk is eliminated (201), the studies included in the review indicated an increasing risk for serious adverse health outcomes, including misuse, overdose, and death associated with increasing opioid dose. These studies examined dose-response risk for overdose for full agonist opioids and not for partial agonist opioids such as buprenorphine, which is unlikely to have the same continuous association between dosage and overdose risk because respiratory depressant effects of buprenorphine reach a plateau (205).\n\nMultiple experts from OWG expressed concern that including specific dosage thresholds in a main recommendation statement would emphasize them as authoritative absolutes and would lead to noncollaborative tapers or other potentially harmful consequences. Experts also noted the lack of a single standard formula for calculating MMEs (206). However, experts agreed there is a need for thresholds as benchmarks and suggested including them in the supporting text after the main recommendation statement. Experts also agreed with separating recommendations on dosage into a recommendation applying to patients starting opioids and patients already receiving opioids.\n\nWhen opioids are used for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should start opioids at the lowest possible effective dosage. For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed on the basis of the severity of pain and other clinical factors, such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8). The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). For example, a label for hydrocodone bitartrate (5 mg) and acetaminophen (300 mg) (207) states that the usual adult dosage is one or two tablets every 4–6 hours as needed for pain, and the total daily dosage should not exceed eight tablets. Clinicians should use additional caution when initiating opioids for patients aged ≥65 years and patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency because of a potentially smaller therapeutic window between safe dosages and dosages associated with respiratory depression and overdose (see Recommendation 8). Formulations with lower opioid doses (e.g., hydrocodone bitartrate 2.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg) are available and can facilitate dosing when additional caution is needed. Product labeling regarding tolerance includes guidance for patients already taking opioids. In addition to opioids, clinicians should consider cumulative dosages of other medications, such as acetaminophen, that are combined with opioids in many formulations and for which decreased clearance of medications might result in accumulation of medications to toxic levels.\n\nClinicians should generally avoid unnecessary dosage increases, use caution when increasing opioid dosages, and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount because overdose risk increases with increases in opioid dosage. Although evidence to recommend specific intervals for dosage titration is limited, rapid dosage increases put patients at greater risk for sedation, respiratory depression, and overdose. For opioid-naïve outpatients with acute pain treated with an opioid for a few days or less, dosage increases are usually unnecessary and should not be attempted without close monitoring because of the risks for respiratory depression. In the context of long-term opioid use, when dosage is increased, clinicians should reevaluate patients after increasing dosage for changes in pain, function, and risk for harm (see Recommendation 7).\n\nBefore increasing total opioid dosage to ≥50 MME/day, clinicians should pause, considering that dosage increases to >50 MME/day are unlikely to provide substantially improved pain control for most patients while overdose risk increases with dosage, and carefully reassess evidence of benefits and risks. If a patient’s opioid dosage for all sources of opioids combined reaches or exceeds 50 MME/day, clinicians should implement additional precautions, including increased frequency of follow-up (see Recommendation 7), and offer naloxone and overdose prevention education to both the patient and the patient’s household members (see Recommendation 8).\n\nAdditional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to increase dosage after an individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences.\n\nCertain states require clinicians to implement clinical protocols at specific dosage levels. For example, before increasing long-term opioid therapy dosage to >120 MME/day, clinicians in Washington state must obtain consultation from a pain specialist who agrees that the increase is indicated and appropriate (208). Clinicians should be aware of policies related to MME thresholds and associated clinical protocols established by their states.\n\nRecommendation 5\n\nFor patients already receiving opioid therapy, clinicians should carefully weigh benefits and risks and exercise care when changing opioid dosage. If benefits outweigh risks of continued opioid therapy, clinicians should work closely with patients to optimize nonopioid therapies while continuing opioid therapy. If benefits do not outweigh risks of continued opioid therapy, clinicians should optimize other therapies and work closely with patients to gradually taper to lower dosages or, if warranted based on the individual circumstances of the patient, appropriately taper and discontinue opioids. Unless there are indications of a life-threatening issue such as warning signs of impending overdose (e.g., confusion, sedation, or slurred speech), opioid therapy should not be discontinued abruptly, and clinicians should not rapidly reduce opioid dosages from higher dosages (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 4).\n\nImplementation Considerations\n\nClinicians should carefully weigh both the benefits and risks of continuing opioid medications and the benefits and risks of tapering opioids.\n\nIf benefits outweigh risks of continued opioid therapy, clinicians should work closely with patients to optimize nonopioid therapies while continuing opioid therapy.\n\nWhen benefits (including avoiding risks of tapering) do not outweigh risks of continued opioid therapy, clinicians should optimize other therapies and work closely with patients to gradually taper to a reduced opioid dosage or, if warranted based on the individual clinical circumstances of the patient, appropriately taper and discontinue opioid therapy.\n\nIn situations where benefits and risks of continuing opioids are considered to be close or unclear, shared decision-making with patients is particularly important.\n\nAt times, clinicians and patients might not be able to agree on whether or not tapering is necessary. When patients and clinicians are unable to arrive at a consensus on the assessment of benefits and risks, clinicians should acknowledge this discordance, express empathy, and seek to implement treatment changes in a patient-centered manner while avoiding patient abandonment.\n\nPatient agreement and interest in tapering is likely to be a key component of successful tapers.\n\nFor patients agreeing to taper to lower opioid dosages and for those remaining on higher opioid dosages, clinicians should establish goals with the patient for continued opioid therapy (see Recommendations 2 and 7) and maximize pain treatment with nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments as appropriate (see Recommendation 2).\n\nClinicians should collaborate with the patient on the tapering plan, including patients in decisions such as how quickly tapering will occur and when pauses in the taper might be warranted.\n\nClinicians should follow up frequently (at least monthly) with patients engaging in opioid tapering. Team members (e.g., nurses, pharmacists, and behavioral health professionals) can support the clinician and patient during the ongoing taper process through telephone contact, telehealth visits, or face-to-face visits.\n\nWhen opioids are reduced or discontinued, a taper slow enough to minimize symptoms and signs of opioid withdrawal (e.g., anxiety, insomnia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, mydriasis, tremor, tachycardia, or piloerection) should be used.\n\nLonger duration of previous opioid therapy might require a longer taper. For patients who have taken opioids long-term (e.g., for ≥1 year), tapers can be completed over several months to years depending on the opioid dosage and should be individualized based on patient goals and concerns.\n\nWhen patients have been taking opioids for longer durations (e.g., for ≥1 year), tapers of 10% per month or slower are likely to be better tolerated than more rapid tapers.\n\nFor patients struggling to tolerate a taper, clinicians should maximize nonopioid treatments for pain and should address behavioral distress.\n\nClinically significant opioid withdrawal symptoms can signal the need to further slow the taper rate.\n\nAt times, tapers might have to be paused and restarted again when the patient is ready and might have to be slowed as patients reach low dosages.\n\nBefore reversing a taper, clinicians should carefully assess and discuss with the patient the benefits and risks of increasing opioid dosage.\n\nGoals of the taper might vary (e.g., some patients might achieve discontinuation whereas others might attain a reduced dosage at which functional benefits outweigh risks). If the clinician has determined with the patient that the ultimate goal of tapering is discontinuing opioids, after the smallest available dose is reached the interval between doses can be extended and opioids can be stopped when taken less frequently than once a day.\n\nClinicians should access appropriate expertise if considering tapering opioids during pregnancy because of possible risks to the pregnant patient and the fetus if the patient goes into withdrawal.\n\nClinicians should advise patients of an increased risk for overdose on abrupt return to a previously prescribed higher dose because of loss of opioid tolerance, provide opioid overdose education, and offer naloxone.\n\nClinicians should remain alert to signs of and screen for anxiety, depression, and opioid misuse or opioid use disorder (see Recommendations 8 and 12) that might be revealed by an opioid taper and provide treatment or arrange for management of these comorbidities.\n\nClinicians should closely monitor patients who are unable to taper and who continue on high-dose or otherwise high-risk opioid regimens (e.g., opioids prescribed concurrently with benzodiazepines) and should work with patients to mitigate overdose risk (e.g., by providing overdose education and naloxone) (see Recommendation 8).\n\nClinicians can use periodic and strategic motivational questions and statements to encourage movement toward appropriate therapeutic changes and functional goals.\n\nClinicians have a responsibility to provide or arrange for coordinated management of patients’ pain and opioid-related problems, including opioid use disorder.\n\nPayers, health systems, and state medical boards should not use this clinical practice guideline to set rigid standards or performance incentives related to dose or duration of opioid therapy; should ensure that policies based on cautionary dosage thresholds do not result in rapid tapers or abrupt discontinuation of opioids; and should ensure that policies do not penalize clinicians for accepting new patients who are using prescribed opioids for chronic pain, including those receiving high dosages of opioids, or for refraining from rapidly tapering patients prescribed long-term opioid medications.\n\nAlthough Recommendation 5 specifically refers to patients using long-term opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain, many of the principles in these implementation considerations and supporting rationale, including communication with patients, pain management, behavioral support, and slower taper rates, also are relevant when discontinuing opioids in patients who have received them for shorter durations (see Recommendations 6 and 7).\n\nSupporting Rationale\n\nPatients receiving long-term, high-dosage opioid therapy for chronic pain are at increased risk for adverse events including overdose death (55,72,202,203,209). However, discontinuation of long-term, high-dosage opioid therapy has been "
