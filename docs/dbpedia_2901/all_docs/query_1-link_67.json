        "text": "(a) Ordering activities shall use the procedures of this subsection when ordering supplies and services that are listed in the schedules contracts at a fixed price for the performance of a specific task, where a statement of work is not required (e.g., installation, maintenance, and repair). For establishing BPAs and for orders under BPAs see 8.405-3.\n\n(b) Orders at or below the micro-purchase threshold. Ordering activities may place orders at, or below, the micro-purchase threshold with any Federal Supply Schedule contractor that can meet the agency’s needs. Although not required to solicit from a specific number of schedule contractors, ordering activities should attempt to distribute orders among contractors.\n\n(c) Orders exceeding the micro-purchase threshold but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. Ordering activities shall place orders with the schedule contractor that can provide the supply or service that represents the best value. Before placing an order, an ordering activity shall:\n\n(1) Consider reasonably available information about the supply or service offered under MAS contracts by surveying at least three schedule contractors through the GSA Advantage! on-line shopping service, by reviewing the catalogs or pricelists of at least three schedule contractors, or by requesting quotations from at least three schedule contractors (see 8.405-5 ); or\n\n(2) Document the circumstances for restricting consideration to fewer than three schedule contractors based on one of the reasons at 8.405-6 (a);\n\n(d) For proposed orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.\n\n(1) Each order shall be placed on a competitive basis in accordance with (d)(2) and (3) of this section, unless this requirement is waived on the basis of a justification that is prepared and approved in accordance with 8.405-6 .\n\n(2) The ordering activity contracting officer shall provide an RFQ that includes a description of the supplies to be delivered or the services to be performed and the basis upon which the selection will be made (see 8.405-1(f)).\n\n(3) The ordering activity contracting officer shall -\n\n(i) Post the RFQ on eBuy to afford all schedule contractors offering the required supplies or services under the appropriate multiple award schedule(s) an opportunity to submit a quote; or\n\n(ii) Provide the RFQ to as many schedule contractors as practicable, consistent with market research appropriate to the circumstances, to reasonably ensure that quotes will be received from at least three contractors that can fulfill the requirements. When fewer than three quotes are received from schedule contractors that can fulfill the requirement, the contracting officer shall prepare a written determination explaining that no additional contractors capable of fulfilling the requirement could be identified despite reasonable efforts to do so. The determination must clearly explain efforts made to obtain quotes from at least three schedule contractors.\n\n(4) The ordering activity contracting officer shall ensure that all quotes received are fairly considered and award is made in accordance with the basis for selection in the RFQ.\n\n(e) When an order contains brand-name specifications, the contracting officer shall post the RFQ on eBuy along with the justification or documentation, as required by 8.405-6. An RFQ is required when a purchase description specifies a brand-name.\n\n(f) In addition to price (see 8.404 (d) and 8.405-4), when determining best value, the ordering activity may consider, among other factors, the following:\n\n(1) Past performance.\n\n(2) Special features of the supply or service required for effective program performance.\n\n(3) Trade-in considerations.\n\n(4) Probable life of the item selected as compared with that of a comparable item.\n\n(5) Warranty considerations.\n\n(6) Maintenance availability.\n\n(7) Environmental and energy efficiency considerations.\n\n(8) Delivery terms.\n\n(g) Minimum documentation. The ordering activity shall document-\n\n(1) The schedule contracts considered, noting the contractor from which the supply or service was purchased;\n\n(2) A description of the supply or service purchased;\n\n(3) The amount paid;\n\n(4) When an order exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold, evidence of compliance with the ordering procedures at 8.405-1(d); and\n\n(5) The basis for the award decision.\n\n(a) General. Ordering activities shall use the procedures in this subsection when ordering services priced at hourly rates as established by the schedule contracts. The applicable services will be identified in the Federal Supply Schedule publications and the contractor’s pricelists. For establishing BPAs and for orders under BPAs see 8.405-3.\n\n(b) Statements of Work (SOWs). All Statements of Work shall include a description of work to be performed; location of work; period of performance; deliverable schedule; applicable performance standards; and any special requirements (e.g., security clearances, travel, special knowledge). To the maximum extent practicable, agency requirements shall be performance-based statements (see subpart 37.6).\n\n(c) Request for Quotation procedures. The ordering activity must provide the request for quotation (RFQ), which includes the statement of work and evaluation criteria (e.g., experience and past performance), to schedule contractors that offer services that will meet the agency’s needs. The RFQ may be posted to GSA’s electronic RFQ system, eBuy (see 8.402(d)).\n\n(1) Orders at, or below, the micro-purchase threshold. Ordering activities may place orders at, or below, the micro-purchase threshold with any Federal Supply Schedule contractor that can meet the agency’s needs. The ordering activity should attempt to distribute orders among contractors.\n\n(2) For orders exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.\n\n(i) The ordering activity shall develop a statement of work, in accordance with 8.405-2(b).\n\n(ii) The ordering activity shall provide the RFQ (including the statement of work and evaluation criteria) to at least three schedule contractors that offer services that will meet the agency’s needs or document the circumstances for restricting consideration to fewer than three schedule contractors based on one of the reasons at 8.405-6 (a).\n\n(iii) The ordering activity shall specify the type of order (i.e., firm-fixed-price, labor-hour) for the services identified in the statement of work. The contracting officer should establish firm-fixed-prices, as appropriate.\n\n(3) For proposed orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. In addition to meeting the requirements of 8.405-2(c)(2)(i) and (iii), the following procedures apply:\n\n(i) Each order shall be placed on a competitive basis in accordance with (c)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section, unless this requirement is waived on the basis of a justification that is prepared and approved in accordance with 8.405-6 .\n\n(ii) The ordering activity contracting officer shall provide an RFQ that includes a statement of work and the evaluation criteria.\n\n(iii) The ordering activity contracting officer shall-\n\n(A) Post the RFQ on eBuy to afford all schedule contractors offering the required services under the appropriate multiple-award schedule(s) an opportunity to submit a quote; or\n\n(B) Provide the RFQ to as many schedule contractors as practicable, consistent with market research appropriate to the circumstances, to reasonably ensure that quotes will be received from at least three contractors that can fulfill the requirements. When fewer than three quotes are received from schedule contractors that can fulfill the requirements, the contracting officer shall prepare a written determination to explain that no additional contractors capable of fulfilling the requirements could be identified despite reasonable efforts to do so. The determination must clearly explain efforts made to obtain quotes from at least three schedule contractors.\n\n(C) Ensure all quotes received are fairly considered and award is made in accordance with the evaluation criteria in the RFQ.\n\n(4) The ordering activity shall provide the RFQ (including the statement of work and the evaluation criteria) to any schedule contractor who requests a copy of it.\n\n(d) Evaluation. The ordering activity shall evaluate all responses received using the evaluation criteria provided to the schedule contractors. The ordering activity is responsible for considering the level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to perform a specific task being ordered, and for determining that the total price is reasonable. Place the order with the schedule contractor that represents the best value (see 8.404(d) and 8.405-4). After award, ordering activities should provide timely notification to unsuccessful offerors. If an unsuccessful offeror requests information on an award that was based on factors other than price alone, a brief explanation of the basis for the award decision shall be provided.\n\n(e) Use of time-and-materials and labor-hour orders for services. When placing a time-and-materials or labor-hour order for services, see 8.404(h).\n\n(f) Minimum documentation. The ordering activity shall document-\n\n(1) The schedule contracts considered, noting the contractor from which the service was purchased;\n\n(2) A description of the service purchased;\n\n(3) The amount paid;\n\n(4) The evaluation methodology used in selecting the contractor to receive the order;\n\n(5) The rationale for any tradeoffs in making the selection;\n\n(6) The price reasonableness determination required by paragraph (d) of this subsection;\n\n(7) The rationale for using other than-\n\n(i) A firm-fixed price order; or\n\n(ii) A performance-based order; and\n\n(8) When an order exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold, evidence of compliance with the ordering procedures at 8.405-2(c).\n\n(a) Establishment.\n\n(1) Ordering activities may establish BPAs under any schedule contract to fill repetitive needs for supplies or services. Ordering activities shall establish the BPA with the schedule contractor(s) that can provide the supply or service that represents the best value.\n\n(2) In addition to price (see 8.404(d) and 8.405-4), when determining best value, the ordering activity may consider, among other factors, the following:\n\n(i) Past performance.\n\n(ii) Special features of the supply or service required for effective program performance.\n\n(iii) Trade-in considerations.\n\n(iv) Probable life of the item selected as compared with that of a comparable item.\n\n(v) Warranty considerations.\n\n(vi) Maintenance availability.\n\n(vii) Environmental and energy efficiency considerations.\n\n(viii) Delivery terms.\n\n(3)\n\n(i) The ordering activity contracting officer shall, to the maximum extent practicable, give preference to establishing multiple-award BPAs, rather than establishing a single-award BPA.\n\n(ii) No single-award BPA with an estimated value exceeding $100 million (including any options), may be awarded unless the head of the agency determines in writing that-\n\n(A) The orders expected under the BPA are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work;\n\n(B) The BPA provides only for firm-fixed priced orders for-\n\n(1) Products with unit prices established in the BPA; or\n\n(2) Services with prices established in the BPA for specific tasks to be performed;\n\n(C) Only one source is qualified and capable of performing the work at a reasonable price to the Government; or\n\n(D) It is necessary in the public interest to award the BPA to a single source for exceptional circumstances.\n\n(iii) The requirement for a determination for a single-award BPA greater than $100 million is in addition to any applicable requirement for a limited-source justification at 8.405-6. However, the two documents may be combined into one document.\n\n(iv) In determining how many multiple-award BPAs to establish or that a single-award BPA is appropriate, the contracting officer should consider the following factors and document the decision in the acquisition plan or BPA file:\n\n(A) The scope and complexity of the requirement(s);\n\n(B) The benefits of on-going competition and the need to periodically compare multiple technical approaches or prices;\n\n(C) The administrative costs of BPAs; and\n\n(D) The technical qualifications of the schedule contractor(s).\n\n(4) BPAs shall address the frequency of ordering, invoicing, discounts, requirements (e.g., estimated quantities, work to be performed), delivery locations, and time.\n\n(5) When establishing multiple-award BPAs, the ordering activity shall specify the procedures for placing orders under the BPAs in accordance with 8.405-3(c)(2).\n\n(6) Establishment of a multi-agency BPA against a Federal Supply Schedule contract is permitted if the multi-agency BPA identifies the participating agencies and their estimated requirements at the time the BPA is established.\n\n(7) Minimum documentation. The ordering activity contracting officer shall include in the BPA file documentation the-\n\n(i) Schedule contracts considered, noting the contractor to which the BPA was awarded;\n\n(ii) Description of the supply or service purchased;\n\n(iii) Price;\n\n(iv) Required justification for a limited-source BPA (see 8.405-6), if applicable;\n\n(v) Determination for a single-award BPA exceeding $100 million, if applicable (see (a)(3)(ii)) of this section);\n\n(vi) Documentation supporting the decision to establish multiple-award BPAs or a single-award BPA (see (a)(3)(iv));\n\n(vii) Evidence of compliance with paragraph (b) of this section, for competitively awarded BPAs, if applicable; and\n\n(viii) Basis for the award decision. This should include the evaluation methodology used in selecting the contractor, the rationale for any tradeoffs in making the selection, and a price reasonableness determination for services requiring a statement of work.\n\n(b) Competitive procedures for establishing a BPA. This paragraph applies to the establishment of a BPA, in addition to applicable instructions in paragraph (a).\n\n(1) For supplies, and for services not requiring a statement of work. The procedures of this paragraph apply when establishing a BPA for supplies and services that are listed in the schedule contract at a fixed price for the performance of a specific task, where a statement of work is not required (e.g., installation, maintenance, and repair).\n\n(i) If the estimated value of the BPA does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.\n\n(A) The ordering activity shall:\n\n(1) Consider reasonably available information about the supply or service offered under MAS contracts by surveying at least three schedule contractors through the GSA Advantage! on-line shopping service, by reviewing the catalogs or pricelists of at least three schedule contractors, or by requesting quotations from at least three schedule contractors (see 8.405-5); or\n\n(2) Document the circumstances for restricting consideration to fewer than three schedule contractors based on one of the reasons at 8.405-6(a).\n\n(B) The ordering activity shall establish the BPA with the schedule contractor(s) that can provide the best value.\n\n(ii) If the estimated value of the BPA exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. The ordering activity contracting officer:\n\n(A) Shall provide an RFQ that includes a description of the supplies to be delivered or the services to be performed and the basis upon which the selection will be made.\n\n(B) (1) Shall post the RFQ on eBuy to afford all schedule contractors offering the required supplies or services under the appropriate multiple award schedule(s) an opportunity to submit a quote; or\n\n(2) Shall provide the RFQ to as many schedule contractors as practicable, consistent with market research appropriate to the circumstances, to reasonably ensure that quotes will be received from at least three contractors that can fulfill the requirements. When fewer than three quotes are received from schedule contractors that can fulfill the requirements, the contracting officer shall prepare a written determination explaining that no additional contractors capable of fulfilling the requirements could be identified despite reasonable efforts to do so. The determination must clearly explain efforts made to obtain quotes from at least three schedule contractors.\n\n(C) Shall ensure all quotes received are fairly considered and award is made in accordance with the basis for selection in the RFQ. After seeking price reductions (see 8.405-4), establish the BPA with the schedule contractor(s) that provides the best value.\n\n(D) The BPA must be established in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, unless the requirement is waived on the basis of a justification that is prepared and approved in accordance with 8.405-6.\n\n(2) For services requiring a statement of work. This applies when establishing a BPA that requires services priced at hourly rates, as provided by the schedule contract. The applicable services will be identified in the Federal Supply Schedule publications and the contractor’s pricelists.\n\n(i) Statements of Work (SOWs). The ordering activity shall develop a statement of work. All Statements of Work shall include a description of work to be performed; location of work; period of performance; deliverable schedule; applicable performance standards; and any special requirements (e.g., security clearances, travel, and special knowledge). To the maximum extent practicable, agency requirements shall be performance-based statements (see subpart 37.6).\n\n(ii) Type-of-order preference. The ordering activity shall specify the order type (i.e., firm-fixed price, time-and-materials, or labor-hour) for the services identified in the statement of work. The contracting officer should establish firm-fixed priced orders to the maximum extent practicable. For time-and-materials and labor-hour orders, the contracting officer shall follow the procedures at 8.404(h).\n\n(iii) Request for quotation procedures. The ordering activity must provide a RFQ, which includes the statement of work and evaluation criteria (e.g., experience and past performance), to schedule contractors that offer services that will meet the agency’s needs. The RFQ may be posted to GSA’s electronic RFQ system, e-Buy (see 8.402(d)).\n\n(iv) If the estimated value of the BPA does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The ordering activity shall provide the RFQ (including the statement of work and evaluation criteria) to at least three schedule contractors that offer services that will meet the agency’s needs.\n\n(v) If estimated value of the BPA exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. The ordering activity contracting officer-\n\n(A) Shall post the RFQ on eBuy to afford all schedule contractors offering the required supplies or services under the appropriate multiple-award schedule an opportunity to submit a quote; or\n\n(B) Shall provide the RFQ, which includes the statement of work and evaluation criteria, to as many schedule contractors as practicable, consistent with market research appropriate to the circumstances, to reasonably ensure that quotes will be received from at least three contractors that can fulfill the requirements. When fewer than three quotes are received from schedule contractors that can fulfill the requirements, the contracting officer shall document the file. The contracting officer shall prepare a written determination explaining that no additional contractors capable of fulfilling the requirements could be identified despite reasonable efforts to do so. The determination must clearly explain efforts made to obtain quotes from at least three schedule contractors.\n\n(vi) The ordering activity contracting officer shall ensure all quotes received are fairly considered and award is made in accordance with the basis for selection in the RFQ. The ordering activity is responsible for considering the level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to perform, and for determining that the proposed price is reasonable.\n\n(vii) The BPA must be established in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv) or (v), and with paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section, unless the requirement is waived on the basis of a justification that is prepared and approved in accordance with 8.405-6.\n\n(viii) The ordering activity contracting officer shall establish the BPA with the schedule contractor(s) that represents the best value (see 8.404(d) and 8.405-4).\n\n(3) After award, ordering activities should provide timely notification to unsuccessful offerors. If an unsuccessful offeror requests information on an award that was based on factors other than price alone, a brief explanation of the basis for the award decision shall be provided.\n\n(c) Ordering from BPAs. The procedures in this paragraph (c) are not required for BPAs established on or before May 16, 2011. However, ordering activities are encouraged to use the procedures for such BPAs.\n\n(1) Single-award BPA. If the ordering activity establishes a single-award BPA, authorized users may place the order directly under the established BPA when the need for the supply or service arises.\n\n(2) Multiple-award BPAs.\n\n(i) Orders at or below the micro-purchase threshold. The ordering activity may place orders at or below the micro-purchase threshold with any BPA holder that can meet the agency needs. The ordering activity should attempt to distribute any such orders among the BPA holders.\n\n(ii) Orders exceeding the micro-purchase threshold but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.\n\n(A) The ordering activity must provide each multiple-award BPA holder a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold unless one of the exceptions at 8.405-6(a)(1)(i) applies.\n\n(B) The ordering activity need not contact each of the multiple-award BPA holders before placing an order if information is available to ensure that each BPA holder is provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each order.\n\n(C) The ordering activity contracting officer shall document the circumstances when restricting consideration to less than all multiple-award BPA holders offering the required supplies and services.\n\n(iii) Orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.\n\n(A) The ordering activity shall place an order in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(A)(1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph, unless the requirement is waived on the basis of a justification that is prepared and approved in accordance with 8.405-6. The ordering activity shall-\n\n(1) Provide an RFQ to all BPA holders offering the required supplies or services under the multiple-award BPAs, to include a description of the supplies to be delivered or the services to be performed and the basis upon which the selection will be made;\n\n(2) Afford all BPA holders responding to the RFQ an opportunity to submit a quote; and\n\n(3) Fairly consider all responses received and make award in accordance with the selection procedures.\n\n(B) The ordering activity shall document evidence of compliance with these procedures and the basis for the award decision.\n\n(3) BPAs for hourly-rate services. If the BPA is for hourly-rate services, the ordering activity shall develop a statement of work for each order covered by the BPA. Ordering activities should place these orders on a firm-fixed price basis to the maximum extent practicable. For time-and-materials and labor-hour orders, the contracting officer shall follow the procedures at 8.404(h). All orders under the BPA shall specify a price for the performance of the tasks identified in the statement of work. The ordering activity is responsible for considering the level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to perform a specific task being ordered, and for determining that the total price is reasonable through appropriate analysis techniques, and documenting the file accordingly.\n\n(d) Duration of BPAs.\n\n(1) Multiple-award BPAs generally should not exceed five years in length, but may do so to meet program requirements.\n\n(2) A single-award BPA shall not exceed one year. It may have up to four one-year options. See paragraph (e) of this section for requirements associated with option exercise.\n\n(3) Contractors may be awarded BPAs that extend beyond the current term of their GSA Schedule contract, so long as there are option periods in their GSA Schedule contract that, if exercised, will cover the BPA’s period of performance.\n\n(e) Review of BPAs.\n\n(1) The ordering activity contracting officer shall review the BPA and determine in writing, at least once a year (e.g., at option exercise), whether-\n\n(i) The schedule contract, upon which the BPA was established, is still in effect;\n\n(ii) The BPA still represents the best value (see 8.404(d)); and\n\n(iii) Estimated quantities/amounts have been exceeded and additional price reductions can be obtained.\n\n(2) The determination shall be included in the BPA file documentation.\n\nOrders placed or BPAs established under Federal Supply Schedules are exempt from the requirements in part 6. However, an ordering activity must justify its action when restricting consideration in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section—\n\n(a) Orders or BPAs exceeding the micro-purchase threshold based on a limited sources justification.\n\n(1) Circumstances justifying limiting the source.\n\n(i) For a proposed order or BPA with an estimated value exceeding the micro-purchase threshold not placed or established in accordance with the procedures in, 8.405-2, or 8.405-3, the only circumstances that may justify the action are–\n\n(A) An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays;\n\n(B) Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; or\n\n(C) In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order or BPA must not have been previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures.\n\n(ii) See 8.405-6(c) for the content of the justification for an order or BPA exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.\n\n(2) Posting.\n\n(i) Within 14 days after placing an order or establishing a BPA exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold that is supported by a limited-sources justification permitted under any of the circumstances under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the ordering activity shall–\n\n(A) Publish a notice in accordance with 5.301; and\n\n(B) Post the justification-\n\n(1) At the GPE https://www.sam.gov;\n\n(2) On the Web site of the ordering activity agency, which may provide access to the justification by linking to the GPE; and\n\n(3) For a minimum of 30 days.\n\n(ii) In the case of an order or BPA permitted under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section, the justification shall be posted within 30 days after award.\n\n(iii) Contracting officers shall carefully screen all justifications for contractor proprietary data and remove all such data, and such references and citations as are necessary to protect the proprietary data, before making the justifications available for public inspection. Contracting officers shall also be guided by the exemptions to disclosure of information contained in the Freedom of Information Act ( 5 U.S.C. 552) and the prohibitions against disclosure in 24.202 in determining whether other data should be removed. Although the submitter notice process set out in Executive Order 12600 \"Predisclosure Notification Procedures for Confidential Commercial Information\" does not apply, if the justification appears to contain proprietary data, the contracting officer should provide the contractor that submitted the information an opportunity to review the justification for proprietary data before making the justification available for public inspection, redacted as necessary. This process must not prevent or delay the posting of the justification in accordance with the timeframes required in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.\n\n(iv) This posting requirement does not apply when disclosure would compromise the national security (e.g., would result in disclosure of classified information) or create other security risks.\n\n(b) Items peculiar to one manufacturer. An item peculiar to one manufacturer can be a particular brand name, product, or a feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer. A brand name item, whether available on one or more schedule contracts, is an item peculiar to one manufacturer.\n\n(1) Brand name specifications shall not be used unless the particular brand name, product, or feature is essential to the Government’s requirements, and market research indicates other companies’ similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency’s needs.\n\n(2) Documentation.\n\n(i) For proposed orders or BPAs with an estimated value exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the ordering activity contracting officer shall document the basis for restricting consideration to an item peculiar to one manufacturer.\n\n(ii) For proposed orders or BPAs with an estimated value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, see paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(iii) The documentation or justification must be completed and approved at the time the requirement for a brand-name item is determined. In addition, the justification for a brand-name item is required at the order level when a justification for the brand-name item was not completed for the BPA or does not adequately cover the requirements in the order.\n\n(3) Posting.\n\n(i) The ordering activity shall post the following information along with the Request for Quotation (RFQ) to eBuy ( https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov):\n\n(A) For proposed orders or BPAs with an estimated value exceeding $25,000, but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the documentation required by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.\n\n(B) For proposed orders or BPAs with an estimated value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the justification required by paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(C) The documentation in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this sectionand the justification in paragraph (c) of this section is subject to the screening requirement in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.\n\n(ii) The posting requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section does not apply when-\n\n(A) Disclosure would compromise the national security (e.g., would result in disclosure of classified information) or create other security risks. The fact that access to classified matter may be necessary to submit a proposal or perform the contract does not, in itself, justify use of this exception;\n\n(B) The nature of the file (e.g., size, format) does not make it cost-effective or practicable for contracting officers to provide access through eBuy;; or\n\n(C) The agency’s senior procurement executive makes a written determination that access through eBuy is not in the Government’s interest.\n\n(4) When applicable, the documentation and posting requirements in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section apply only to the portion of the order or BPA that requires a brand-name item. If the justification and approval is to cover only the portion of the acquisition which is brand-name, then it should so state; the approval level requirements will then only apply to that portion.\n\n(c) An order or BPA with an estimated value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.\n\n(1) For a proposed order or BPA exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the requiring activity shall assist the ordering activity contracting officer in the preparation of the justification. The justification shall cite that the acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program (see 8.401).\n\n(2) At a minimum, each justification shall include the following information:\n\n(i) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a \"Limited-Sources Justification.\"\n\n(ii) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.\n\n(iii) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs (including the estimated value).\n\n(iv) The authority and supporting rationale (see 8.405-6(a)(1)(i) and (b)(1)) and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service.\n\n(v) A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with 8.404(d).\n\n(vi) A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.\n\n(vii) Any other facts supporting the justification.\n\n(viii) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made.\n\n(ix) The ordering activity contracting officer’s certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer’s knowledge and belief.\n\n(x) Evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government’s minimum needs or requirements or other rationale for limited sources) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.\n\n(xi) For justifications under 8.405-6(a)(1), a written determination by the approving official identifying the circumstance that applies.\n\n(d) Justification approvals.\n\n(1) For a proposed order or BPA with an estimated value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, but not exceeding $750,000, the ordering activity contracting officer’s certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the ordering activity contracting officer’s knowledge and belief will serve as approval, unless a higher approval level is established in accordance with agency procedures.\n\n(2) For a proposed order or BPA with an estimated value exceeding $750,000, but not exceeding $15 million, the justification must be approved by the advocate for competition of the activity placing the order, or by an official named in paragraph (d)(3) or (4) of this section. This authority is not delegable.\n\n(3) For a proposed order or BPA with an estimated value exceeding $15 million, but not exceeding $75 million (or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, not exceeding $100 million), the justification must be approved by-\n\n(i) The head of the procuring activity placing the order;\n\n(ii) A designee who-\n\n(A) If a member of the armed forces, is a general or flag officer; or\n\n(B) If a civilian, is serving in a position in a grade above GS-15 under the General Schedule (or in a comparable or higher position under another schedule); or\n\n(iii) An official named in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.\n\n(4) For a proposed order or BPA with an estimated value exceeding $75 million (or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, over $100 million), the justification must be approved by the senior procurement executive of the agency placing the order. This authority is not delegable, except in the case of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, acting as the senior procurement executive for the Department of Defense."
