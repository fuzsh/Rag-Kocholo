More broadly, the program advances the recognition and implementation of Indigenous rights recognized and affirmed by Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\n\nCentral to this process are interest-based discussions between First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities across Canada in partnership with provincial and territorial governments as applicable, and the federal government led by CIRNAC. These discussions seek to advance shared priorities through collaboratively developed mandates for Indigenous rights and self-determination agreements. Through these processes, the parties work to build a shared understanding of how rights are exercised in particular contexts, which in turn, support healthier, more sustainable and thriving communities.\n\nNegotiation of Rights-Based Agreements, Including Treaties, Self-Government Agreements and Other Constructive Arrangements\n\nDescription: This program supports Canada's commitment to the negotiation of rights-based agreements, including treaties, self-government agreements and other constructive arrangements, to reconcile Aboriginal rights, as recognized and affirmed under Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, with the sovereignty of the Crown.\n\nCanada negotiates treaties, self-government and other constructive arrangements to help co-create an enabling environment where Indigenous groups can exercise their right of self-determination and improve the political, social cultural and economic conditions within their communities.\n\nNote: Formerly record number INA CGI 0106.\n\nDocument types: Claim issues and negotiations, governmental approval processes, funding arrangements, government obligations, precedents, statistics related to rights-based agreements, studies related to rights-based agreements, committees, procedures and meetings (Federal Steering Committee on Section 35 Rights - Transactional stream and Policy and Coordination stream), policy positions, policy guidelines, policy research and advice, self government proposals, assessments and responses, negotiation reports, conferences, agreements, memoranda of understanding, and workshops.\n\nIncludes records related to program guidelines, claims and treaty agreements negotiation support funding proposals assessment and responses, funding arrangements, funding recipient reports.\n\nRecord number: CIRNAC TAG 016\n\nTreaty commissions and treaty tables\n\nDescription: Includes records related to the activities of treaty commissions and treaty discussion tables.
