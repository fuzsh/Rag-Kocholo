Wipers are entry-level workers, who clean, paint the engine room and its equipment, and assist in maintenance and repairs. The following are ratings in the engine department:\n\nWiper means an “entry-level” unlicensed member of the engine department.\n\nQMED (Fireman/Watertender, Oiler, Junior Engineer, Electrician/Refrigerating, Pumpman/Machinist) means qualified member of the engine department that may work as a watchstander and/or day worker.\n\nThe Coast Guard no longer issues original endorsements for Deck Engineer, Deck/Engine Mechanic, or Engineman, or individual endorsements for Refrigerating Engineer, Machinist, Electrician, and Pumpman. However, a mariner who holds any of these endorsements may continue to renew them as long as he or she is otherwise qualified.\n\nDuplication, Renewal, STCW Renewal, and Entry Level\n\nClick on the collapsible panel below to open and close it.\n\nRenewal\n\nA credential may be renewed at any time during its validity and for one year after expiration. NOTE: Whenever an applicant applied for \"renewal\" of an endorsement as deck officer, engineer officer, or qualified rating more than 12 months after expiration, instead of meeting the requirements of 46 CFR 10.227 (d) (8), the applicant must demonstrate continued professional knowledge by completing a course or by passing the complete examination.\n\nDuplicate\n\nUpon request and without examination, a mariner may be issued a duplicate credential after submitting an application with an affidavit describing the circumstances of the loss. The duplicate issued will have the same wording, authority, and expiration date as the lost credential.\n\nRe-instatement\n\nAn applicant must apply as an original MMC if the MMC sought is the first credential issued to the applicant after their previous credential has expired beyond the grace period (one year past the expiration date of MMC) and they do not hold a Document of Continuity."
