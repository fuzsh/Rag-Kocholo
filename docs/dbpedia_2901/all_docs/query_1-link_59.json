        "text": "Regulatory Status\n\nThe cane toad (also known as the bufo, giant or marine toad) is a large, nonnative amphibian that has been introduced into Florida. Cane toads are considered an invasive species and are poisonous to most animals that try to bite or consume them. Cane toads are not protected in Florida except by anti-cruelty law and can be removed from private property and humanely killed year-round with landowner permission. Captured cane toads may not be relocated and released.\n\nCaptive-held cane toads are regulated as Class III wildlife in the State of Florida. A permit is not required to possess cane toads as personal pets. However, a License to Possess Class III Wildlife for Exhibition or Public Sale must be obtained to possess these amphibians for commercial use and a Captive Wildlife Importation Permit is required to import this species into the state.\n\nDescription\n\nCane toads are reddish-brown to grayish-brown with a light-yellow or beige belly and can be uniform in color or have darker markings around the body. They have enlarged glands behind the eyes, which angle downward onto the shoulders. The glands secrete a potent milky-white toxin (bufotoxin) as defense against predators including domestic pets.\n\nCane toads generally range in size from 6 to 9 inches in length. They can be confused with the native southern toad, however, adult cane toads are much larger than adult southern toads which only grow to a maximum of approximately 3 to 4 inches.\n\nCane toads do not have ridges across the head, as seen in the southern toad.\n\nIn Florida, cane toads are found in urban, suburban and agricultural areas. Cane toads are commonly found in yards, around buildings or near canals and ponds. Cane toads breed year-round in standing water, streams, canals and ditches.\n\nPotential Impacts\n\nThe skin-gland secretions of cane toads (called bufotoxin) are highly toxic and can sicken or even kill animals that bite or feed on them, including native animals and domestic pets. The skin secretions may irritate the skin or burn the eyes of people who handle them. Cane toad eggs also contain bufotoxin and can harm or kill native animals that consume them. Cane toads also potentially compete with native frogs and toads for food and breeding areas.\n\nTo safely remove cane toads, wear eye and skin protection, and wear latex, rubber, or nitrile gloves if handling. Captured cane toads may not be relocated and released. Homeowners that need assistance removing cane toads from their property can hire a wildlife trapper. It is also very important to make sure that you have properly identified the animal as a cane toad and not a native southern toad, which is a beneficial part of the Florida ecosystem.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I remove cane toads from my property?\n\nYes. Cane toads are not protected in Florida except by anti-cruelty law and can be removed and humanely killed on private property year-round with landowner permission. To safely remove cane toads, wear eye and skin protection, and wear latex, rubber, or nitrile gloves if handling. Captured cane toads may not be relocated and released. Homeowners that need assistance removing cane toads from their property can hire a wildlife trapper. It is also very important to make sure that you have properly identified the animal as a cane toad and not a native southern toad, which is a beneficial part of the Florida ecosystem. Adult cane toads range in size from 6-9 inches long, while southern toads only grow to 3-4 inches long. Southern toads will have well defined cranial crests which look like ridges or horns above their eyes and a small, oval shaped gland visible behind their eyes. Cane toads do not have crests above their eyes and possess a larger, triangular shaped gland behind their eye. You can learn more about how to properly identify cane toads on this video from UF: Cane Toads - How to Identify This Invasive Pest - YouTube.\n\nThis video from the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences goes over some methods to humanely capture and kill cane toads.\n\nWhat should I do if my pet bites or swallows a cane toad?\n\nIf your pet bites or swallows a cane toad, they can become sick and die in as little as 15 minutes without proper treatment. Cane toads release a milky toxin that can stick in a pet’s mouth. Symptoms may include frantic or disoriented behavior, brick red gums, seizures, and foaming at the mouth. If you see these symptoms, follow these steps:\n\nWash toxins forward out of mouth using a hose for ten minutes being careful not to direct water down the throat.\n\nWipe gums/tongue with dish towel to remove toxins.\n\nGet your pet to the vet!\n\nThis instructional video from the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences outlines these steps.\n\nWhat can I do to keep cane toads off my property?\n\nRemove places where cane toads or their prey can hide or seek shelter:\n\nCut your grass regularly and keep it short\n\nFill in any holes around structures\n\nTrim the underside of shrubs\n\nKeep branches or riprap off the ground\n\nClear away brush piles\n\nRemove clutter\n\nRemove food that can attract cane toads and their prey:\n\nFeed pets indoors when possible\n\nBring outdoor pet food and water bowls indoors at night\n\nClean up any food scraps from pet bowls or outside tables and grills\n\nWhat should I do if I come into contact with a cane toad?\n\nThoroughly wash your hands after coming into contact with a cane toad, as you would after touching any wild animal.\n\nAlways wear latex, rubber or nitrile gloves to safely handle cane toads.\n\nWhat if I have a pet cane toad I can no longer care for?\n\nEscaped or released pets remain a primary source of introduced species in Florida, and it is illegal to introduce nonnative species into the state. Pet owners who can no longer keep their exotic pets, including cane toads, can find a new home for them through the FWC’s Exotic Pet Amnesty Program. This program helps reduce the number of nonnative species being released into the wild and fosters responsible pet ownership by giving pet owners a responsible and ecologically sound alternative to releasing an exotic animal. Note: The FWC does not rehome wild-caught nonnative wildlife."
