        "text": "There are 574 ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse federally recognized Indian Tribes in the United States. These Tribal Nations are distinct political entities whose inherent sovereignty predates the United States and is reflected in their government-to-government relationship with the U.S. government. The United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support Tribal Nations and their citizens through treaties, statutes, and historical relations with Tribal Nations. The 2022-2027 Strategic Plan addresses the federal government’s responsibilities to Tribal Nations and their citizens.\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights reported that—due to a variety of reasons such as historical discriminatory policies, insufficient resources, and inefficient federal program delivery—American Indians and Alaska Natives continue to rank near the bottom of all Americans in terms of health, education, and employment.\n\nSeveral federal agencies provide direct services or funding to federally recognized Tribal Nations and their citizens—including the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), and the Indian Health Service (IHS). However, they face a number of challenges to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of their tribal programs. Improving federal management of programs that serve Tribal Nations and their citizens is on the High Risk List.\n\nFor instance:\n\nIHS has faced numerous challenges in administering health care services to American Indians and Alaska Natives. For example, recent cases of provider misconduct, including sexual abuse and physical assault, have raised questions about the agency’s ability to protect patients from harm.\n\nBIE-funded schools are required to provide services for eligible students with disabilities, such as learning disabilities or health impairments. Each of these students has an individualized education plan outlining the type, frequency, and duration of services the school is legally required to provide—e.g., physical therapy. Schools must log when and for how long the services in each plan are provided to students. However, schools didn’t provide or didn’t log almost 40% of students’ planned service time. Strengthening oversight and support activities can help BIE address the unique needs of students with disabilities.\n\nFederal agencies are required by law to provide a variety of programs and services to Tribal Nations and their citizens. The Office of Management and Budget publishes an annual report on federal funding for programs that benefit Native Americans but has not developed a formal process to regularly solicit and assess feedback from federal agencies and tribal stakeholders. Additionally, some agencies do not have a formal process for incorporating tribal input and needs into their budgets.\n\nMore than 70 out of over 200 Alaska Native villages face significant threats from erosion, flooding, or thawing permafrost—and climate change is expected to exacerbate these threats. Federal agencies have worked to repair damaged infrastructure in Alaska Native villages and build their resilience to environmental threats. However, federal assistance would be more effective if there was interagency and intergovernmental coordination among federal agencies and state and tribal governments to address these threats.\n\nErosion and thawing permafrost undermine the land beneath homes in Newtok, Alaska"
