        "text": "Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis executive summary reviews the topics covered in this PDQ summary on cancer genetics risk assessment and genetic counseling, with hyperlinks to detailed sections below that describe the evidence on each topic.\n\nIdentification of Individuals for Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling\n\nIndividuals are considered to be candidates for cancer risk assessment if they have a personal and/or family history (on the maternal or paternal side) or clinical characteristics with features suggestive of hereditary cancer. These features vary by type of cancer and specific hereditary syndrome. Criteria have been published to help identify individuals who may benefit from genetic counseling. It is important that individuals who are candidates for genetic testing undergo genetic education and counseling before testing to facilitate informed decision-making and adaptation to the risk or condition. Genetic education and counseling allow individuals to understand the risks, benefits, and limitations of genetic testing. This also allows individuals to consider possible medical uncertainties, cancer diagnoses, and/or medical management plans that accompany certain genetic test results.\n\nComponents of Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling\n\nComprehensive cancer risk assessment and counseling is a consultative service that includes clinical assessment, genetic testing when appropriate, and risk management recommendations delivered in the context of one or more genetic counseling sessions. Pretest genetic counseling is an important part of the risk assessment process and helps patients understand their genetic testing options and potential outcomes. Posttest genetic counseling helps patients understand their test results, including the medical implications for themselves and their relatives.\n\nThe recommended provision of cancer risk assessment services optimally involves care providers from multiple disciplines, including a genetic counselor; a genetics advanced practice nurse; a medical geneticist or a physician, such as an oncologist, surgeon, or internist; and potential referrals to other specialists, such as mental health professionals, endocrinologists, and reproductive specialists.\n\nTraditionally, genetic counseling services have been delivered using individualized, in-person appointments. However, other methodologies are being increasingly utilized, including group sessions, telephone counseling, and telemedicine by videoconferencing.\n\nGenetic Testing Considerations\n\nThere are many factors that can influence an individual’s decision to undergo genetic testing and which type of test to use, including the presence of a known pathogenic variant in the family, patterns of cancer in the family, insurance coverage, family planning considerations, and the psychological impact of a test result. Previously, most germline genetic testing was offered for a single gene at a time; however, recent technological advances have resulted in the widespread availability of multigene (panel) testing, which can simultaneously test for pathogenic variants in many genes at once, often at costs comparable to single-gene testing. Research has examined the use and outcomes of multigene testing.\n\nSome health-related cancer genetic tests are also offered as direct-to-consumer (DTC) tests. While these tests may promote access and patient autonomy, the process may not include genetic counseling or interpretation of the results by a genetics professional. In addition, these tests may be incomplete or require confirmation with a second DNA sample sent to another clinical laboratory.\n\nCascade genetic testing can be effective in identifying carriers of a pathogenic variant prior to cancer presentation which provides opportunities for cancer prevention, early detection, risk reduction, and ultimately improved health outcomes.\n\nVarious cancer genetic service delivery approaches are being used to facilitate greater access to genetic counseling and testing. These approaches have been utilized to streamline the process by which high-risk or affected individuals are identified and referred to specialty genetic services for additional evaluation. These service delivery models vary in the processes by which patients receive genetic education, counseling, and testing.\n\nEthical, Legal, and Social Implications\n\nHaving an understanding of the ethical, legal, and social implications regarding cancer genetic testing may influence the clinician’s response to the complex questions and issues that may arise during the process of risk assessment and counseling. There are several ethical and legal considerations that factor into decisions about what responsibility, if any, providers have to directly inform at-risk relatives about hereditary cancer risks. This section addresses duty to warn, including legal frameworks and available guidance from professional societies. Consultation with an ethicist, ethics committee, legal counsel, privacy officer, and when applicable, an institutional review board, may be warranted in certain disclosure situations.\n\nEmployment and insurance discrimination are common concerns for individuals considering genetic testing. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), a Federal law passed in 2008, protects against health insurance and employment discrimination on the basis of genetics information for most people; however, it does not apply to members of the military or to long-term care, disability, and life insurance provisions.\n\nIntroduction\n\n[Note: Many of the medical and scientific terms used in this summary are found in the NCI Dictionary of Genetics Terms. When a linked term is clicked, the definition will appear in a separate window.]\n\n[Note: A concerted effort is being made within the genetics community to shift terminology used to describe genetic variation. The shift is to use the term “variant” rather than the term “mutation” to describe a difference that exists between the person or group being studied and the reference sequence, particularly for differences that exist in the germline. Variants can then be further classified as benign (harmless), likely benign, of uncertain significance, likely pathogenic, or pathogenic (disease causing). Throughout this summary, we will use the term pathogenic variant to describe a disease-causing mutation. For more information about variant classification, see Cancer Genetics Overview.]\n\nThis summary describes current approaches of assessing and counseling people about their chances of having an inherited susceptibility to cancer. Genetic counseling is defined by the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) as helping people understand and adapt to the medical, psychological, and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease. Practice resources from NSGC are available to help providers determine hereditary cancer risk and understand guidelines for clinical management of this risk.[1,2]\n\nIndividuals are considered to be candidates for cancer risk assessment if they have personal and/or family histories (in maternal or paternal lineages) with features suggestive of hereditary cancer. These features vary by type of cancer and specific hereditary syndrome. Practice resources have been published to help clinicians identify individuals who may benefit from a genetics evaluation and/or genetic counseling. Organizations like the National Comprehensive Cancer Network frequently update related genetic counseling and genetic testing guidelines.[3-6] The PDQ cancer genetics information summaries on breast, ovarian, endometrial, colorectal, prostate, kidney, and skin cancers and endocrine and neuroendocrine neoplasias describe the clinical features of hereditary syndromes associated with these conditions.\n\nThe following are features that suggest hereditary cancer:[7-11]\n\nUnusually early age of cancer onset (e.g., premenopausal breast cancer).\n\nMultiple primary cancers in a single individual (e.g., colorectal and endometrial cancer).\n\nBilateral cancer in paired organs or multifocal disease (e.g., bilateral breast cancer or multifocal renal cancer).\n\nClustering of the same type of cancer in close relatives (e.g., mother, daughter, and sisters with breast cancer).\n\nCancers occurring in multiple generations of a family (i.e., autosomal dominant inheritance).\n\nOccurrence of rare tumors (e.g., retinoblastoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, granulosa cell tumor of the ovary, ocular melanoma, or duodenal cancer).\n\nOccurrence of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.\n\nUnusual presentation of cancer (e.g., male breast cancer).\n\nUncommon tumor histology (e.g., medullary thyroid carcinoma).\n\nRare cancers associated with birth defects (e.g., Wilms tumor and genitourinary abnormalities).\n\nGeographic or ethnic populations known to be at high risk of hereditary cancers. Genetic testing candidates may be identified based solely on ethnicity when a strong founder effect is present in a given population (e.g., Ashkenazi heritage and BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variants).\n\nAs part of the process of genetic education and counseling, genetic testing may be considered when the following factors are present:[12-14]\n\nAn individual's personal history (including ethnicity) and/or family history are suspicious for a genetic predisposition to cancer.\n\nThe genetic test has sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be interpreted.\n\nThe test will impact the individual's diagnosis, cancer management or cancer risk management, and/or help clarify risk in family members.\n\nIt is important that genetic testing candidates undergo genetic education and counseling prior to testing. This process allows greater understanding of disease risk and helps facilitate informed decision making.[3,4,10-14] Genetic education and counseling allow individuals to understand the risks, benefits, and limitations of genetic testing. This also allows individuals to consider possible medical uncertainties, cancer diagnoses, and/or medical management plans that accompany certain genetic test results.\n\nReferences\n\nBerliner JL, Cummings SA, Boldt Burnett B, et al.: Risk assessment and genetic counseling for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes-Practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.

[PUBMED Abstract]\n\nIdentification of Candidates for Referral to Genetic Counseling\n\nAfter an individual’s personal and family cancer histories have been collected, several factors could warrant referral to a genetics professional for evaluation of hereditary cancer syndromes. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) have published a comprehensive set of personal and family history criteria to guide the identification of at-risk individuals and appropriate referral for cancer genetic risk consultation.[1] These practice guidelines address tumor types, other potential features, and related criteria that would prompt a genetics referral. ACMG and NSGC state that the guidelines are intended to maximize appropriate referral of at-risk individuals for cancer genetics consultations, but they are not meant to provide genetic testing or treatment recommendations. Furthermore, ACMG and NSGC acknowledge other sources that provide updated and evolving genetic testing criteria (e.g., the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]) and the increasing role of nongenetics professionals in facilitating genetic testing, especially to guide cancer treatment.[2] For more information, see the Cancer Genetics Service Delivery section.\n\nTools to Identify Candidates for Genetic Counseling and Genetic Testing\n\nAll major societies recommend genetic services for patients at a moderate or high risk of having a hereditary cancer syndrome. In addition to published guidelines available through professional organizations,[2-5] there are also red flag cards, paper-based checklists, chatbots, and patient-directed online referral tools to identify patients who are candidates for genetic counseling and genetic testing. There are a number of commercially available tools (not addressed in this summary) that also offer risk assessment and/or facilitate genetic evaluation. These brief and simple screening tools may be administered to patients in a provider's waiting room or online prior to a visit. Some tools are publicly available and can be accessed directly by patients. For a list of some of these tools, see the table on Risk Assessment Information and the table on Online Pathogenic Variant Prediction Programs in Cancer Genetics Overview.\n\nMany of these tools assess common features suggestive of hereditary cancer, but there are limitations. For example, there is variability in the tools' abilities to flag at-risk individuals based on extensive criteria, as outlined by current professional society guidelines (e.g., NCCN). Hence, some people who are candidates for genetic counseling and genetic testing will be missed by these tools. This includes individuals who may be considered low-risk based on these screening tools. Because of the potential clinical utility of genetic testing, clinical judgement may still be needed to determine the appropriateness of genetic counseling and testing in these individuals. Thus, clinical review of information on screening forms is still warranted.\n\nAdditional tools are available to assess the risk of harboring a specific pathogenic variant in a cancer susceptibility gene. For more information, see the Models for Prediction of Breast and Gynecologic Cancer Risk section in Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers and the Clinical risk assessment models that predict the likelihood of an MMR gene pathogenic variant section in Genetics of Colorectal Cancer.\n\nReferences\n\nHampel H, Bennett RL, Buchanan A, et al.: A practice guideline from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the National Society of Genetic Counselors: referral indications for cancer predisposition assessment.

Pretest genetic counseling is an important part of the risk assessment process and helps patients understand their genetic testing options and potential outcomes. Posttest genetic counseling helps patients understand their test results, including the medical implications for themselves and their relatives.\n\nThe following professional organizations emphasize the importance of genetic counseling in the cancer risk assessment and genetic testing process:\n\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.[1,2]\n\nAmerican College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.[3]\n\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology.[4]\n\nInternational Society of Nurses in Genetics.[5,6]\n\nNational Society of Genetic Counselors.[7,8]\n\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network.[9,10]\n\nOncology Nursing Society.[11]\n\nSociety of Gynecologic Oncologists.[12,13]\n\nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force.[14]\n\nFor a list of organizations that have published clinical practices guidelines related to genetic counseling, risk assessment, genetic testing, and/or management for hereditary breast and gynecologic cancers, see the Indications for hereditary breast and gynecologic cancers genetic testing section in Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers.\n\nGenetic counseling informs the consultand about potential cancer risks and the benefits and limitations of genetic testing and offers an opportunity to consider the potential medical, psychological, familial, and social implications of genetic information.[7,15] Descriptions of genetic counseling and the specialized practice of cancer risk assessment counseling are detailed below.\n\nGenetic Counseling\n\nGenetic counseling has been defined by the National Society of Genetic Counselors as the process of helping people understand and adapt to the medical, psychological, and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease, including the following:[7]\n\nHow inherited diseases and conditions might affect them or their families.\n\nHow family and medical histories may impact the chance of disease occurrence or recurrence.\n\nWhich genetic tests may or may not be right for them, and what those tests may or may not tell.\n\nHow to make the most informed choices about health care conditions and risk.\n\nCentral to the philosophy and practice of genetic counseling are the principles of voluntary utilization of services, informed decision making, attention to psychosocial and affective dimensions of coping with genetic risk, and protection of patient confidentiality and privacy. This is facilitated through a combination of rapport building and information gathering; establishing or verifying diagnoses; risk assessment and calculation of quantitative occurrence/recurrence risks; education and informed consent processes; psychosocial assessment, support, and counseling appropriate to a family’s culture and ethnicity; and other relevant background characteristics.[16] The psychosocial assessment is especially important in the genetic counseling process because individuals most vulnerable to adverse effects of genetic information may include those who have had difficulty dealing with stressful life events in the past.[17] Variables that may influence psychosocial adjustment to genetic information include individual and familial factors; cultural factors; and health system factors such as the type of test, disease status, and risk information. Findings from a psychosocial assessment can be used to help guide the direction of the counseling session.[18] An important objective of genetic counseling is to provide an opportunity for shared decision making when the medical benefits of one course of action are not demonstrated to be superior to another. The relationship between the availability of effective medical treatment for carriers of pathogenic variants and the clinical validity of a given test affects the degree to which personal choice or physician recommendation is supported in counseling at-risk individuals.[19] Uptake of genetic counseling services among those referred varies based on the cancer syndrome and the clinical setting. Efforts to decrease barriers to service utilization are ongoing (e.g., the use of a patient navigator or an oncology clinic–based genetic counselor may increase utilization of these services).[20-22] Readers interested in the nature and history of genetic counseling are referred to a number of comprehensive reviews.[23-28]\n\nPretest Genetic Education and Counseling Outcomes\n\nCancer risk assessment counseling has emerged as a specialized practice that requires knowledge of genetics, oncology, and individual and family counseling skills that may be provided by health care providers with this interdisciplinary training.[29] Some centers providing cancer risk assessment services involve a multidisciplinary team, which may include a genetic counselor; a genetics advanced practice nurse; a medical geneticist or a physician, such as an oncologist, surgeon, or internist; and a mental health professional.\n\nReferences\n\nHampel H, Bennett RL, Buchanan A, et al.: A practice guideline from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the National Society of Genetic Counselors: referral indications for cancer predisposition assessment.

[PUBMED Abstract]\n\nComponents of the Risk Assessment Process\n\nThis section provides an overview of critical elements in the cancer risk assessment process.\n\nA number of professional guidelines on the elements of cancer genetics risk assessment and counseling are available.[1-5] Except where noted, the discussion below is based on these guidelines.\n\nThe cancer risk assessment and genetic counseling process consists of one or more consultative sessions and generally includes the following:\n\nA detailed, multifaceted assessment including medical, psychosocial, and family history.\n\nA determination of the risk of cancer and/or indication for genetic testing based on evidence of an inherited cancer syndrome.\n\nEducation and counseling about familial/hereditary cancer risks.\n\nIf appropriate, review of genetic testing options as well as potential limitations, risks, and benefits of testing.\n\nEstablishment of a cancer risk management plan.\n\nDiscussion of follow-up plans, provision of referrals, educational materials, etc.\n\nAssessment\n\nAt the outset of the initial counseling session, eliciting and addressing the consultand's perceptions and concerns about cancer and his or her expectations of the risk assessment process helps to engage the consultand in the session. This also helps inform the provider about practical or psychosocial issues and guides the focus of counseling and strategies for risk assessment.\n\nPsychosocial assessment\n\nThe genetic counseling process that takes place as part of a cancer risk assessment can identify factors that contribute to the consultand's perception of cancer risk and motivations to seek cancer risk assessment and genetic testing. It can also identify potential psychological issues that may need to be addressed during or after the session, particularly after genetic testing. Information collected before and/or during the session may include the following:\n\nMotivations for seeking cancer risk assessment.\n\nBeliefs about the causes of cancer.\n\nExperiences with cancer and feelings, perceptions, concerns, or fears related to those experiences.\n\nThe influence of cancer experiences and perceptions on health behaviors and cancer screening practices.\n\nCultural, religious, and socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nGeneral psychological history, such as a history of depression/anxiety, medication use, and ongoing treatments for psychiatric illnesses.\n\nCoping mechanisms.\n\nSupport systems.\n\nCognitive deficits in the consultand, which may limit his/her understanding of the genetic information provided and/or hinder his/her ability to give informed consent.\n\nPatterns of communication within the family, including cohesion/closeness of family members (or lack thereof), and the family beliefs/values that affect health behaviors. Ethnic and cultural factors may also play an important role in guiding behavior in some families.\n\nThe health of family members (i.e., new diagnoses of cancer or deaths from cancer) and their relationship statuses (i.e., divorced, married, grieving) may inform the provider about the timing of the individual’s participation in genetic counseling or testing. These factors may also reveal possible contraindications for genetic testing at the time of the patient’s genetic counseling session.\n\nEither alone or in consultation with a mental health provider, health care providers offering cancer risk counseling attempt to assess whether there are factors suggesting risk of adverse psychological outcomes after disclosure of risk and/or genetic status.\n\nRisk perception\n\nPerceived risk can play an important role in an individual’s decision to participate in counseling,[6] despite the fact that perceived risk often varies substantially from statistical risk estimates.[7-9]\n\nClinical Evaluation\n\nPersonal health history\n\nConsideration of the consultand's personal health history is essential in cancer risk assessment, regardless of whether the individual has a personal history of cancer. Important information to obtain about the consultand's health history includes the following:[2,3]\n\nCurrent age.\n\nRace, ancestry, and ethnicity.\n\nHistory of benign or precancerous tumors or polyps, surgeries, biopsies, major illnesses, medications, and reproductive history (for women, this includes age at menarche, parity, age at first live birth, age at menopause, and history of exogenous hormone use).\n\nScreening practices and date of last screening exams, including imaging and/or physical examinations.\n\nEnvironmental exposures.\n\nPast and current alcohol intake and tobacco use.\n\nDiet, exercise, and complementary and alternative medicine practices may also be assessed.\n\nFor consultands with a history of cancer, additional information collected includes the following:\n\nSite/type of primary malignancy and any metastasis or recurrence.\n\nAge at diagnosis.\n\nPathology findings/staging.\n\nPrior germline genetic testing results.\n\nPrior tumor testing results (including genomic profiling).[10,11] For more information on the implications of tumor testing, see the Clinical Sequencing section in Cancer Genetics Overview.\n\nTreatment (e.g., surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy), including whether genetic risk assessment may affect treatment.\n\nBilaterality of disease, if applicable.\n\nCurrent surveillance plan.\n\nCarcinogenic exposures (e.g., alcohol and tobacco use, sun exposure, radiation exposure, asbestos exposure) or other known cancer site-specific risk factors.\n\nHow the cancer was detected (e.g., self-exam, screening test, presenting symptoms) may also be assessed.\n\nPhysical examination\n\nIn some cases, a physical exam is conducted by a qualified medical professional to determine whether the individual has physical findings suggestive of a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome or to rule out evidence of an existing malignancy. For example, a medical professional may look for the sebaceous adenomas seen in Muir-Torre syndrome, measure the head circumference or perform a skin exam to rule out benign cutaneous features associated with Cowden syndrome, or perform a clinical breast and axillary lymph node exam on a woman undergoing a breast cancer risk assessment.\n\nFamily history\n\nDocumenting the family history\n\nThe family history is an essential tool for cancer risk assessment. Family history may be collected before or during a clinical encounter via an interview with a clinician. Self-administered family history collection tools are an alternative and may improve efficiency. A meta-analysis of 28 studies investigating 27 electronic family history tools reported that patients found these tools acceptable and efficient (average completion time, 31 minutes). This meta-analysis also showed that these tools had high completion rates (average completion rate, 86%) and were more comprehensive when compared with paper-based surveys and clinician interviews.[12] In these studies, family history collection occurred in one of two ways: 1) online before visits, or 2) in clinic via kiosks or electronic tablets. However, it was challenging to integrate tool-collected information into electronic medical records, and functionality was also an issue. Collecting family history from multiple relatives in a single family has been shown to increase the number of family members reported to have cancer, compared with family history information provided by a single family member.[13]\n\nDetails of the family health history are best summarized in the form of a family tree, or pedigree. The pedigree, a standardized graphic representation of family relationships, facilitates identification of patterns of disease transmission, recognition of the clinical characteristics associated with specific hereditary cancer syndromes, and determination of the best strategies and tools for risk assessment.[14,15]\n\nCurrent standards of pedigree nomenclature have been published by the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) and adopted by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. See these referenced works for detailed explanations, discussion, and examples of pedigree symbols.[10,16]\n\nDocumentation of a comprehensive family cancer history typically includes the following:\n\nA three-generation pedigree consisting of a minimum of first- and second-degree relatives on both the maternal and paternal sides of the family. Information on multiple generations helps to demonstrate inheritance patterns. Hereditary cancer can be inherited from either the maternal or the paternal side of the family, even in sex-limited (e.g., prostate cancer) and sex-influenced (e.g., breast cancer) phenotypes.[17]\n\nRace, ancestry, and ethnicity of all grandparents. This may influence decisions about genetic testing because specific pathogenic variants in some genes are known to occur with increased frequency in some populations (founder effect).[17]\n\nInformation about seemingly unrelated conditions, such as birth defects, atypical skin bumps, or other nonmalignant conditions of children and adults that may aid in the diagnosis of a cancer susceptibility syndrome.\n\nNotation of adoption, nonpaternity (the biologic father should be included in the pedigree), consanguinity, and use of assisted reproductive technology (e.g., donor egg or sperm).\n\nDistinguish gender from sex in the pedigree when they are discordant.[16]\n\nA three-generation family history includes the following:\n\nFirst-degree relatives (e.g., children, brothers and sisters, and parents).\n\nSecond-degree relatives (e.g., grandparents, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews, grandchildren, and half-siblings).\n\nThird-degree relatives (e.g., first cousins, great aunts, and great uncles).\n\nAdditional distant relatives are included if information is available, especially when there are known cancer histories among them.\n\nFor any relative with cancer, collect the following information:[18]\n\nPrimary site of each cancer. Obtaining medical documentation of key cancers (e.g., pathology reports, clinical documents, and death certificates) is especially relevant to risk assessment and/or management recommendations.\n\nAge at diagnosis for each primary cancer.\n\nWhere the relative was diagnosed and/or treated.\n\nHistory of surgery or treatments that may have reduced the risk of cancer. For example, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in a premenopausal woman significantly reduces the risk of ovarian and breast cancers. This may mask underlying hereditary predisposition to these cancers.\n\nCurrent age (if living).\n\nAge at death and cause of death (if deceased).\n\nCarcinogenic exposures (e.g., alcohol and tobacco use, sun exposure, radiation exposure, asbestos exposure) or other known cancer site-specific risk factors.\n\nPrior germline genetic testing results.\n\nOther significant health problems.\n\nFor more information, see the Accuracy of the family history section.\n\nFor relatives not affected with cancer, collect the following information:\n\nCurrent age or age at death.\n\nCause of death (if deceased).\n\nHistory of any surgeries or treatments that may have reduced the risk of cancer.\n\nCancer screening practices.\n\nAny nonmalignant features associated with the syndrome in question.\n\nCarcinogenic exposures (e.g., alcohol and tobacco use, sun exposure, radiation exposure, asbestos exposure) or other known cancer site-specific risk factors.\n\nPrior germline genetic testing results.\n\nPrior tumor testing results (including genomic profiling).\n\nOther significant health problems.\n\nAccuracy of the family history\n\nThe accuracy of the family history has a direct bearing on determining the differential diagnoses, selecting appropriate testing, interpreting results of the genetic tests, refining individual cancer risk estimates, and outlining screening and risk reduction recommendations. People often have incomplete or inaccurate information about the cancer history in their families.[15,18-25] In a nationally representative sample of 3,504 adults from the United States, only 31% of participants stated that they knew the cancers in their relatives very well.[26] Accuracy of family history reporting varied by cancer site and a relative's degree of relatedness to the patient.[23,27,28] Reporting of cancer family histories was the most accurate for breast cancer cases [23,28,29] and less accurate for gynecologic [23,28] and colon cancer cases.[23]\n\nSelf-reported family histories may contain errors, and in rare instances, they can be fictitious.[21,28,30] Obtaining a pathology report is the most reliable way to document a cancer's histology. Verification of cancers in a family history can also be achieved via other medical records, tumor registries, and/or death certificates. Patient education has been shown to improve the completeness of family history collection and may lead to more-accurate risk stratification, referrals for genetic counseling, and changes to management recommendations.[31] Confirming the primary site of cancers in the family that will affect the calculation of hereditary predisposition probabilities and/or estimation of empiric cancer risks may be important, especially if decisions about treatments such as risk-reducing surgery will be based on this family history.[21,30]\n\nDetermining Cancer Risk\n\nAnalysis of the family history\n\nBecause a family history of cancer is one of the important predictors of cancer risk, analysis of the pedigree constitutes an important aspect of risk assessment. This analysis might be thought of as a series of the following questions:\n\nWhat evidence suggests that a cancer susceptibility syndrome is present in this family?\n\nHereditary cancer syndromes are found by analyzing both pedigrees and physical findings. The index of suspicion is raised by the following:[17]\n\nMultiple cancers in close relatives, particularly in multiple generations.\n\nEarly age of cancer onset (younger than age 40 to 50 y for adult-onset cancers).\n\nMultiple primary cancers in a single individual.\n\nBilateral cancers.\n\nRecognition of the known association between etiologically related cancers in the family (e.g., breast and ovarian cancers; colon and endometrial cancers).\n\nPresence of congenital anomalies or precursor lesions that are known to be associated with increased cancer risk (e.g., presence of atypical nevi and risk of malignant melanoma).\n\nRecognizable mendelian inheritance pattern.\n\nSpecific tumor types or pathologies associated with germline pathogenic variants in cancer susceptibility genes, regardless of family history (e.g., ovarian cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, sex cord tumors in ovarian cancer). For more information on these tumor types, see Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers and Genetics of Endocrine and Neuroendocrine Neoplasias.\n\nAbnormal results from colon or endometrial tumor testing with microsatellite instability or immunohistochemistry, suggestive of Lynch syndrome. For more information, see the Genetics of Lynch syndrome section in Genetics of Colorectal Cancer.\n\nSomatic mutations identified from tumor genomic profiling that may be present in the germline.\n\nClinical characteristics associated with different cancer genetic syndromes are summarized in the following comprehensive set of personal and family history criteria published by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC).[32] These practice guidelines address tumor types, other potential features, and related criteria that would prompt a genetics referral. ACMG and NSGC state that the guidelines are intended to maximize appropriate referral of at-risk individuals for cancer genetics consultations, but they are not meant to provide genetic testing or treatment recommendations. However, these organizations also note the importance of consulting other guidelines that are more frequently updated, like the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.[33]\n\nIf a syndrome is suspected, what are the differential diagnoses?\n\nThe most common indications for genetic counseling/testing are suspected hereditary breast cancer or hereditary colon cancer syndromes.\n\nFor hereditary breast cancer, genetic counseling and testing criteria are broad.[10,32] Multigene panel testing has revealed that pathogenic variants in several other high- and moderate-penetrance genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2 contribute to this phenotype, such as PALB2, CHEK2, and ATM.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for hereditary colon cancer syndromes are based on several factors, including the following: number of colorectal polyps, type of colorectal polyps, histopathology of gastrointestinal malignancies, and histopathology of other malignancies.[34,35] However, in the absence of polyposis and rare pathologies, Lynch syndrome is often on the differential diagnosis list. Furthermore, Lynch syndrome may be on the differential diagnosis list when there are cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer in the family that are not consistent with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.[36,37] For more information, see the Lynch syndrome section in Genetics of Colorectal Cancer.\n\nDiagnostic and testing criteria exist for several rare syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome,[38] Cowden syndrome,[39,40] multiple endocrine neoplasias,[41] and familial adenomatous polyposis.[10,34] In some cases, pathognomonic features are indicators for rare cancer syndromes.[39,40]\n\nBased on these considerations, genetic testing options include targeted testing for pathogenic variants in one or several genes or testing with a large gene panel.\n\nWhat factors can make the family history difficult to interpret?\n\nOther factors may complicate recognition of basic inheritance patterns or represent different types of disease etiology.[42-44]\n\nCommon examples of factors that complicate family history structure include the following:\n\nSmall family size.\n\nIncomplete information due to a lack of family history knowledge (e.g., due to adoption or lack of information about cancers in relatives).\n\nGender imbalance (e.g., few women in a family suspected of hereditary breast cancer).\n\nDeaths at particularly early ages.\n\nRemoval of the at-risk organ, either for risk reduction or as a result of a medical condition (e.g., hysterectomy due to history of uterine fibroids or endometriosis may hamper the identification of Lynch syndrome).\n\nMisattributed parentage.\n\nConsanguinity.\n\nGenetic factors that may affect family history interpretation include:\n\nWhat is the most likely mode of inheritance for a hereditary cancer syndrome?\n\nThe mode of inheritance refers to the way that genetic traits are transmitted in a family.\n\nMost modes of inheritance are established when the patient is given a clinical diagnosis and when a compatible, but not necessarily conclusive, inheritance pattern is seen on a pedigree.[45] Most recognized hereditary cancer syndromes are inherited in an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive fashion. Clues to recognizing these patterns within a pedigree are described below.\n\nAutosomal dominant\n\nAutosomal dominant inheritance refers to disorders that are expressed in heterozygotes (i.e., the affected person has one copy of a pathogenic variant and one normal copy of the gene). All of the major hereditary breast/gynecological and colorectal cancer syndromes are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion; these syndromes include the following: BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated hereditary breast and gynecologic cancers, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome, Lynch syndrome. Autosomal dominant inheritance is characterized by the following factors:\n\nVertical occurrence (i.e., syndrome-associated cancers are seen in successive generations).\n\nSyndrome-associated cancers are seen only on one side of the family (i.e., unipaternal or unimaternal).\n\nMales and females may inherit and transmit the disorder to offspring.\n\nMale-to-male transmission may be seen.\n\nOffspring have a 50% chance of inheriting a pathogenic variant and a 50% chance of inheriting a normal copy of the gene.\n\nThe condition may appear to skip a generation due to several factors: incomplete penetrance, early death, delayed age of disease onset, or a small number of affected males/females when the at-risk organ is gender-specific (e.g., prostate and ovary).\n\nIt is possible for an individual to have a de novo (new) pathogenic variant. This person would be the first affected member of his or her family, but he/she could transmit this pathogenic variant to his/her offspring in an autosomal dominant fashion.\n\nIt is possible for an individual to have pathogenic variants in more than one gene associated with known autosomal dominant inherited cancer predisposition syndromes. In families with phenotypes suggestive of more than one type of hereditary cancer syndrome, identifying multiple pathogenic variants helps better explain complex personal and/or family histories of cancer. This can help determine the appropriate testing strategy for family members.[46]\n\nAutosomal recessive\n\nIn autosomal recessive inheritance, an affected person must be homozygous (i.e., an individual has two pathogenic variants and inherited one pathogenic variant from each parent). Well-defined cancer susceptibility syndromes with autosomal recessive inheritance patterns include the following: Bloom syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia, MUTYH-associated polyposis, and Fanconi anemia. Autosomal recessive inheritance is characterized by the following:\n\nHorizontal occurrence (i.e., syndrome-associated cancers are only seen in one generation; affected siblings are seen in the absence of affected parents). This is generally not seen in successive generations.\n\nPathogenic variants are inherited from both sides of the family (i.e., biparental inheritance).\n\nParents are heterozygous carriers; each parent carries one pathogenic variant and one functional copy of the gene.\n\nParents usually do not express the features associated with the pathogenic variant that they carry; in some cases, parents may show a mild version of some features.\n\nWhen two parents are heterozygous, there is a 25% risk for future offspring to be affected (homozygous).\n\nComplex inheritance\n\nMost cancers, and most familial cancers, appear to have a complex etiology. Within clinical settings, negative or uninformative genetic testing results are common. Multiple factors may contribute to the development of the observed cancer(s); these factors may be difficult to pinpoint.\n\nComplex or multifactorial disease inheritance is used to describe conditions caused by genetic and environmental factors. In contrast to mendelian diseases, where carrying one pathogenic variant is associated with a high likelihood for developing the disease, complex/multifactorial diseases are caused by the interaction of genes and environmental factors. Therefore, a single genetic locus is not responsible for the condition. In most cases, the combined effects of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors determine a person’s likelihood of being affected with a condition, such as cancer.\n\nClustering of cancer among relatives is common. However, determining the underlying causes of this is difficult when there is not a clear pattern of cancer in the family. Individuals with common malignancies, like lung cancer, can have many relatives with cancer. These familial aggregations are thought to be caused by a combination of the following: exposures to known carcinogens (such as tobacco smoke), pathogenic variants in high-penetrance cancer risk genes, and alterations in low-penetrance genes that affect the metabolism of carcinogens.[47]\n\nThe general practitioner is likely to encounter some families with strong genetic predispositions to cancer. Recognizing an individual's cancer susceptibility may have dramatic consequences for his/her health and management. Although some high-risk pathogenic variants in major cancer susceptibility genes are consistent with recognizable mendelian inheritance patterns, these syndromes are rare.\n\nWhat is a family member's risk of developing cancer if an inherited susceptibility exists?\n\nThese probabilities vary by syndrome, family, gene, and pathogenic variant. Different pathogenic variants in the same gene can confer varying cancer risks, or the same pathogenic variant can be associated with different clinical manifestations in separate families. Many of these scenarios can be attributed to penetrance and expressivity. For more information, see the Penetrance of Inherited Susceptibility to Hereditary Breast and/or Gynecologic Cancers section in Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers.\n\nIf a recognizable hereditary cancer syndrome is not found, what is an individual's cancer risk based on other epidemiological risk factors?\n\nA positive family history may provide information about cancer risk, even when a hereditary cancer syndrome is not found. For example, the risk of having a single relative affected with breast or colorectal cancer can be estimated from epidemiologic data and family studies. For more information, see Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers and Genetics of Colorectal Cancer.\n\nMethods of quantifying cancer risk\n\nThe overarching goal of cancer risk assessment is to individualize cancer risk management recommendations based on personalized risk. Methods to calculate risk utilize health history information and risk factor and family history data often in combination with emerging biologic and genetic/genomic evidence to establish predictions.[48] Multiple methodologies are used to calculate risk, including statistical models, prevalence data from specific populations, penetrance data when a documented pathogenic variant has been identified in a family, mendelian inheritance, and Bayesian analysis. All models have distinct capabilities, weaknesses, and limitations based on the methodology, sample size, and/or population used to create the model. Methods to individually quantify risk encompass two primary areas: the probability of harboring a pathogenic variant in a cancer susceptibility gene and the risk of developing a specific form of cancer.[48]\n\nRisk of harboring a pathogenic variant in a cancer susceptibility gene\n\nThe decision to offer genetic testing for cancer susceptibility is complex and can be aided in part by objectively assessing an individual's and/or family's probability of harboring a pathogenic variant.[49] Predicting the probability of harboring a pathogenic variant in a cancer susceptibility gene can be done using several strategies, including empiric data, statistical models, population prevalence data, Mendel’s laws, Bayesian analysis, and specific health information, such as tumor-specific features.[49,50] All of these methods are gene specific or cancer-syndrome specific and are employed only after a thorough assessment has been completed and genetic differential diagnoses have been established.\n\nIf a gene or hereditary cancer syndrome is suspected, syndrome-specific models can be used to determine if genetic testing is warranted. Models and prevalence data are most effective when they are applied to the populations that are best suited for their use. For instance, a model or prevalence data derived from a population study of individuals older than 35 years may not accurately be applied in a population aged 35 years and younger. Care must be taken when interpreting the data obtained from various risk models because they differ with regard to what is actually being estimated. Some models estimate the risk of a pathogenic variant being present in the family; others estimate the risk of a pathogenic variant being present in the individual being counseled. Some models estimate the risk of specific cancers developing in an individual, while others estimate more than one of the data above. Other important considerations include critical family constructs, which can significantly impact model reliability, such as small family size or male-dominated families when the cancer risks are predominantly female in origin, adoption, and early deaths from other causes.[42,50] In addition, most models provide gene and/or syndrome-specific probabilities but do not account for the possibility that the personal and/or family history of cancer may be conferred by an as-yet-unidentified cancer susceptibility gene.[43] In the absence of a documented pathogenic variant in the family, critical assessment of the personal and family history is essential in determining the usefulness and limitations of probability estimates used to aid in the decisions regarding indications for genetic testing.[43,49,50]\n\nFor more information on syndrome-specific models, see the following PDQ summaries:\n\nWhen a pathogenic variant has been identified in a family and a test report documents that finding, prior probabilities can be ascertained with a greater degree of reliability. In this setting, probabilities can be calculated based on the pattern of inheritance associated with the gene in which the pathogenic variant has been identified. In addition, critical to the application of mendelian inheritance is the consideration of integrating Bayes Theorem, which incorporates other variables, such as current age, into the calculation for a more accurate posterior probability.[51,52] This is especially useful in individuals who have lived to be older than the age at which cancer is likely to develop based on the pathogenic variant identified in their family and therefore have a lower likelihood of harboring the family pathogenic variant when compared with the probability based on their relationship to the carrier in the family.\n\nEven in the case of a documented pathogenic variant on one side of the family, careful assessment and evaluation of the individual’s personal and family history of cancer is essential to rule out cancer risk or suspicion of a cancer susceptibility gene pathogenic variant on the other side of the family (maternal or paternal, as applicable).[53] Segregation of more than one pathogenic variant in a family is possible (e.g., in circumstances in which a cancer syndrome has founder pathogenic variants associated with families of particular ancestral origin).\n\nRisk of developing cancer\n\nUnlike pathogenic variant probability models that predict the likelihood that a given personal and/or family history of cancer could be associated with a pathogenic variant in a specific gene(s), other methods and models can be used to estimate the risk of developing cancer over time. Similar to pathogenic variant probability assessments, cancer risk calculations are also complex and necessitate a detailed health history and family history. In the presence of a documented pathogenic variant, cancer risk estimates can be derived from peer-reviewed penetrance data. Penetrance data are constantly being refined and many genetic variants have variable penetrance because other variables may impact the absolute risk of cancer in any given patient. Modifiers of cancer risk in carriers of pathogenic variants include the variant's effect on the function of the gene/protein (e.g., variant type and position), the contributions of modifier genes, and personal and environmental factors (e.g., the impact of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy performed for other indications in a woman who harbors a BRCA pathogenic variant).[54] When there is evidence of an inherited susceptibility to cancer but genetic testing has not been performed, analysis of the pedigree can be used to estimate cancer risk. This type of calculation uses the probability the individual harbors a genetic variant and variant-specific penetrance data to calculate cancer risk.[51]\n\nIn the absence of evidence of a hereditary cancer syndrome, several methods can be utilized to estimate cancer risk. Relative risk data from studies of specific risk factors provide ratios of observed versus expected cancers associated with a given risk factor. However, utilizing relative risk data for individualized risk assessment can have significant limitations: relative risk calculations will differ based on the type of control group and other study-associated biases, and comparability across studies can vary widely.[52] In addition, relative risks are lifetime ratios and do not provide age-specific calculations, nor can the relative risk be multiplied by population risk to provide an individual's risk estimate.[52,55]\n\nIn spite of these limitations, disease-specific cumulative risk estimates are most often employed in clinical settings. These estimates usually provide risk for a given time interval and can be anchored to cumulative risks of other health conditions in a given population (e.g., the 5-year risk by the Gail model).[52,55] Cumulative risk models have limitations that may underestimate or overestimate risk. For example, the Gail model excludes paternal family histories of breast cancer.[50] Furthermore, many of these models were constructed from data derived from predominantly white populations and may have limited validity when used to estimate risk in other ethnicities.[56]\n\nCumulative risk estimates are best used when evidence of other underlying significant risk factors have been ruled out. Careful evaluation of an individual's personal health and family history can identify other confounding risk factors that may outweigh a risk estimate derived from a cumulative risk model. For example, a woman with a prior biopsy showing lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) whose mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 65 years has a greater lifetime risk from her history of LCIS than her cumulative lifetime risk of breast cancer based on one first-degree relative.[57,58] In this circumstance, recommendations for cancer risk management would be based on the risk associated with her LCIS. Unfortunately, there is no reliable method for combining all of an individual's relevant risk factors for an accurate absolute cancer risk estimate, nor are individual risk factors additive.\n\nIn summary, careful ascertainment and review of personal health and cancer family history are essential adjuncts to the use of prior probability models and cancer risk assessment models to assure that critical elements influencing risk calculations are considered.[49] Influencing factors include the following:\n\nDifferential diagnosis that is consistent with the personal and cancer family history.\n\nConsideration of factors that influence how informative the family history may be.\n\nPopulation that is best suited for the use of the model.\n\nTumor-specific features that may be suspicious for an inherited predisposition or modify individual cancer risk predictions.\n\nModel-specific limitations that can overestimate or underestimate calculations.[43]\n\nA number of investigators are developing health care provider decision support tools such as the Genetic Risk Assessment on the Internet with Decision Support (GRAIDS),[59] but at this time, clinical judgment remains a key component of any prior probability or absolute cancer risk estimation.[49]\n\nReferences\n\nRobson ME, Bradbury AR, Arun B, et al.: American Society of Clinical Oncology Policy Statement Update: Genetic and Genomic Testing for Cancer Susceptibility.

[PUBMED Abstract]\n\nThe Option of Genetic Testing\n\nFactors to Consider When Offering Testing\n\nIndications for testing\n\nExperts recommend offering genetic testing when a risk assessment suggests the presence of an inherited cancer syndrome for which specific genes have been identified. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Policy Statement on Genetic Testing for Cancer Susceptibility proposes that genetic testing be offered when the following conditions apply:[1,2]\n\nAn individual has a personal or family history suggestive of a genetic cancer susceptibility syndrome.\n\nThe results of the test can be interpreted.\n\nTesting will influence medical management.\n\nCharacteristics used in making this determination are discussed in the PDQ summaries on the genetics of specific cancers. Even when individual and family history characteristics indicate a possible inherited cancer syndrome, individuals may elect not to proceed with testing after discussion of potential risks, benefits, and limitations, as discussed below. Conversely, individuals whose pedigrees are incomplete or uninformative due to very small family size, early deaths, or incomplete data on key family members may elect to pursue genetic testing in an attempt to better define their risk status. In these situations, it is particularly important that the pretest counseling fully explore the limitations of the testing process.\n\nASCO's 2010 and 2015 policy statements addressed testing for low- to moderate-penetrance genes and direct-to-consumer testing.[1,2]\n\nASCO’s position is that when a test, regardless of clinical utility, is ordered by a health care professional, the provider is responsible for organizing follow-up care based on the findings. For tests that are ordered by the consumer without health care professional involvement, management decisions are based on the evidence for clinical utility. For tests with accepted clinical utility, follow-up care can be guided by the evidence for cancer risk associated with the genetic test finding. However, in tests ordered by the consumer that have uncertain clinical utility, ASCO recommends that follow-up care consist of education regarding the lack of evidence regarding the test's clinical utility and that cancer risk management decisions be guided by established cancer risk factors.[1,2]\n\nIn 2015, ASCO updated its policy to address the challenges of new technologies in cancer genetics, including multigene (panel) testing for cancer genetic susceptibility, as well as incidental germline findings from somatic mutation profiling.[2] ASCO's statement supports informing patients about medically relevant germline findings discovered during somatic mutation profiling.[2]\n\nGenetic education and counseling approaches (including the interpretation of genetic test results) will vary if genetic testing has already been attempted (for more information, see Figure 1). In general, there are two primary circumstances in which genetic testing is performed:\n\nFamilies with evidence of an inherited susceptibility that have not had any genetic testing or in which genetic testing has not identified a pathogenic variant.\n\nFamilies with a documented pathogenic variant.\n\nValue of testing an affected family member first\n\nGenetic susceptibility testing generally yields the most useful information when a living family member with the cancer of concern is tested before other family members; this can help determine if his/her cancer has a genetic origin. If testing is deferred while follow-up with an affected relative is pending, consider providing interim cancer risk management guidelines to the unaffected proband.[3] Possible genetic testing outcomes include the following (for more information, see Figure 1):\n\nPathogenic variant detected.\n\nNo variant detected.\n\nVariant of uncertain significance (VUS) detected.\n\nIf a documented pathogenic variant (associated with cancer risk) is identified, risks are based on penetrance data for pathogenic variants of that specific gene. In addition, other family members may be tested for the presence or absence of this specific pathogenic variant. If no variant is found in an affected family member, testing is considered uninformative and thus there is no basis for testing unaffected relatives. Failure of the laboratory to detect a pathogenic variant in an affected family member does not rule out an inherited basis for the cancer in that family. Reasons why testing could be uninformative include the following:\n\nThe cancer in the family may be associated with a cancer susceptibility gene other than the gene that was tested.\n\nThe cancer in the family may be associated with a pathogenic variant, but the cancer in the specific family member who underwent testing is not associated with that variant. This can occur especially with cancers that are common in the general population, such as breast cancer or prostate cancer. The family member who is affected with the disease but is not a carrier of the pathogenic variant associated with the inherited predisposition to cancer in the family is considered a phenocopy.\n\nIdentifying a genetic variant may not be possible given the limited sensitivity of the laboratory techniques used to detect genetic variants. There may be additional testing available to detect certain types of variants that would have been missed by the initial genetic test.\n\nThe function of the gene could be altered by a pathogenic variant in a different gene.\n\nLastly, testing may reveal a VUS. This result means that a genetic variant has been found; however, the extent that this variant increases cancer risk, or whether it is associated with the history of cancer in the family, is uncertain. In this circumstance, some clues as to the significance of the variant can be derived from the following:\n\nThe location of the variant in relation to regions and function of a gene.\n\nThe specific change; since many variants are missense variants, not all amino acid substitutions are as significant.\n\nWhether the variant has been documented in the presence of a documented pathogenic variant.\n\nWhether the variant is associated with the branch in the family with the cancer and/or whether the variant tracks with the cancers in the family.\n\nUnfortunately, even with this information, there is often insufficient evidence to document the significance of a specific variant, and further clarifying research is required.\n\nIf there is no close, living, affected relative to undergo testing, or the living affected relative declines testing, other options may be discussed with the patient and the testing laboratory. In rare instances, if proper authorization is secured from the family, testing the stored tissue of a deceased relative may be considered. However, genetic tests done on stored tissue are technically difficult and may not yield a definitive result. Therefore, testing an unaffected person without prior testing of an affected family member may be performed. In these instances, counseling includes discussing that a negative test result does not rule out the presence of a cancer susceptibility gene in the family or in the patient and may be uninformative.\n\nTesting in families with a documented pathogenic variant\n\nGenetic testing for a documented familial pathogenic variant can be informative and will yield one of the following results (for more information, see Figure 1):\n\nPositive for the familial pathogenic variant.\n\nNegative for the familial pathogenic variant.\n\nIf the familial pathogenic variant is detected in a family member, their cancer risks are based on penetrance data for pathogenic variants in that specific gene. If the documented pathogenic variant is not found in a family member, the risk of cancer in that individual is equivalent to cancer risk in the general population. However, other risk factors and family history from the side of the family not associated with the documented pathogenic variant may increase the cancer risk above the general population levels.\n\nIn summary, genetic education and counseling includes identifying the most informative person in the family to test, which may be an affected family member rather than the individual seeking genetic services. In addition, counseling includes a discussion of the limitations of the test, all possible test outcomes, and the consequences of identifying a VUS.[4]\n\nInsurance coverage\n\nInsurance coverage varies for cancer susceptibility testing, including multigene (panel) testing. In general, most individuals who meet specific criteria (e.g., National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] guidelines for BRCA1/BRCA2 or Lynch syndrome testing) are able to obtain insurance coverage for multigene testing.[5] Of note, some insurance companies have contracts with specific laboratories through which testing must be ordered.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that private insurers cover—with no out-of-pocket costs to the insured—genetic counseling and BRCA1/BRCA2 testing for unaffected women meeting United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines.[6,7] Importantly, under ACA guidelines, women with a prior cancer diagnosis are not covered. The ACA does not stipulate that follow-up care based on genetic test results be covered (e.g., risk-reducing surgeries). However, some insurance companies require that pretest genetic counseling be performed by a credentialed genetics provider before testing is authorized. Before testing is ordered, it is important to verify costs and insurance coverage, including for Medicaid and Medicare patients. Medicare does not cover genetic testing if the patient has not had a cancer diagnosis associated with the pathogenic variants for which testing is ordered. In addition, unaffected individuals with Medicare are not covered for testing, even if they are tested for only a known familial pathogenic variant. Further, Medicare does not cover genetic counseling as a separately billable service.[8] For individuals without insurance coverage and the underinsured, some laboratories offer low-cost options or have financial assistance programs.\n\nGenetic testing and assisted reproductive technology\n\nThere is a risk of carriers passing on cancer-associated pathogenic variants to offspring. When an individual tests positive for one pathogenic variant in a cancer susceptibility gene, counseling about reproductive implications addresses not only the risks associated with autosomal dominant inheritance but also the potential risks of having a child with two pathogenic variants in the same gene (biallelic) that could result in a severe condition.\n\nAssisted reproductive technology can be used for preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) and for prenatal cancer predisposition genetic testing using chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis.[9-11] For individuals with autosomal dominant cancer syndromes (e.g., those associated with APC, BRCA1/BRCA2, PTEN, or TP53 pathogenic variants), reproductive options exist for prenatal testing and PGT to detect offspring with one copy of the pathogenic variant (heterozygotes).\n\nIn some cases (e.g., carriers of germline pathogenic variants in ATM, BLM), assessing an individual’s partner's risk for carrying a pathogenic variant associated with a dominant or recessive syndrome (i.e., his or her personal and family history and ethnicity) is indicated. In the unlikely event that both parents are heterozygous for specific pathogenic variants, there is a 25% risk that a child will be homozygous and could have a severe phenotype. In light of this information, couples may consider PGT or prenatal testing.\n\nA proposed analytic framework for counseling carriers about reproduction options includes consideration of the following issues:[10]\n\nDoes the cancer syndrome include childhood malignancies or significant morbidity or mortality at an early age?\n\nWhat is the penetrance associated with the genetic variant?\n\nHow severe is the syndrome phenotype?\n\nAre there interventions available that decrease the pathogenic variant-associated cancer risk or are proven to detect cancer early when it is in a treatable form?\n\nIs there evidence of a different phenotype if an individual is a heterozygous or homozygous carrier?[12,13]\n\nIn a study of 320 patients with different hereditary cancer syndromes, most were unaware of PGT; however, the majority expressed interest in learning more about the availability of PGT.[14] Patients also preferred having a discussion about PGT with their genetic counselor or primary physician. Disease-specific factors (e.g., severity of the hereditary condition, quality of life, and medical interventions) and individual factors (e.g., gender, childbearing status, and religious beliefs) affected patient attitudes about PGT.\n\nDetermining the Test to Be Used\n\nGenetic testing is highly specialized. There are also multiple molecular testing methods available, each with its own indications, costs, strengths, and weaknesses. Depending on the method employed and the extent of the analysis, different tests for the same gene will have varying levels of sensitivity and specificity. Even assuming high analytic validity, genetic heterogeneity makes test selection challenging. A number of different genetic syndromes may underlie the development of a particular cancer type. For example, hereditary colorectal cancer may be due to familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Lynch syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, juvenile polyposis syndrome, or other syndromes. Each of these has a different genetic basis. In addition, different genes may be responsible for the same condition (e.g., Lynch syndrome can be caused by pathogenic variants in one of several mismatch repair [MMR] genes).\n\nIn some genes, the same pathogenic variant has been found in multiple, apparently unrelated families. This observation is consistent with a founder effect, wherein a pathogenic variant identified in a contemporary population can be traced back to a small group of founders isolated by geographic, cultural, or other factors. For example, two specific BRCA1 pathogenic variants (68_69delAG and 5266dup, also known in the literature as 185delAG and 5382insC) and one BRCA2 pathogenic variant (5946delT, also known as 6174delT) have been reported to be common in Ashkenazi Jews. Other genes also have reported founder pathogenic variants. The presence of founder pathogenic variants has practical implications for genetic testing. Many laboratories offer directed testing specifically for ethnic-specific alleles. This greatly simplifies the technical aspects of the test but is not without limitations. For example, approximately 15% of BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants that occur among Ashkenazim are nonfounder pathogenic variants.[15] Also, for genes in which large genome rearrangements are common in the founder population, ordering additional testing using different techniques may be needed.\n\nAllelic heterogeneity (i.e., different variants within the same gene) can confer different risks or be associated with a different phenotype. For example, though the general rule is that adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) pathogenic variants are associated with hundreds or thousands of colonic polyps and colon cancer of the classical FAP syndrome, some APC pathogenic variants cause a milder clinical picture, with fewer polyps and lower colorectal cancer risk.[16,17] In addition, other disorders may be part of the FAP spectrum. Pathogenic variants in a certain portion of the APC gene also predispose to retinal changes, for example, when pathogenic variants in a different region of APC predispose to desmoid tumors.\n\nSince hereditary cancer syndromes can have varying presentations and overlapping phenotypes, selecting the appropriate genetic test may require knowledge on the following topics:\n\nGenetic syndromes.\n\nDiagnostic methods used for identifying pathogenic variants.\n\nCorrelations between clinical and molecular test findings.\n\nInformation regarding rapidly changing genetic testing options.\n\nSee the following PDQ summaries for more information:\n\nMultigene (panel) testing\n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) and the removal of most patent barriers to diagnostic DNA sequencing [18] have resulted in the availability of multigene testing, which can simultaneously test more than 50 genes for pathogenic variants, often at costs comparable to single-gene testing. These multigene panels can include genes with pathogenic variants that are associated with high risks of cancer and genes that confer moderate and uncertain risks. The multigene panels can be limited to specific cancer types (e.g., breast, ovarian, colon) or can include many cancer types. This type of testing has both advantages and disadvantages, and much of the information presented in this section is not based on empirical data but rather on commentaries.\n\nGenetic education and counseling for multigene testing\n\nASCO has stressed the importance of genetic counseling to ensure patients are adequately informed about the implications of this type of testing and recommends that tests be ordered by cancer genetic professionals.[2,19] Yet, the use of multigene testing requires modification of traditional approaches to genetic counseling.[20,21] Optimal evidence-based counseling strategies have not yet been established. Unlike in-person, single-gene pretest genetic counseling models, these approaches have not been examined for outcomes of counseling such as comprehension, satisfaction, psychosocial outcomes, and testing uptake. Table 1 summarizes recommendations from ASCO on elements of pretest genetic counseling and informed consent for germline cancer genetic testing.[2]\n\nTable 1.

Several of the studies are collaborations between the two. There are several important caveats about the research that has been conducted so far with regard to multigene testing:\n\nThe studies differ in their aims, approaches, ascertainment of subjects, and panels used.\n\nLaboratory- and clinic-based studies likely differ with regard to their sampling frames (the population a study draws from and its characteristics). For example, some studies may include testing by a wide variety of health care professionals, some of whom may not be as experienced in triaging, testing, and advising high-risk patients.[22]\n\nTesting methodologies also differ among laboratories regarding exon/intron coverage, read depth, Sanger sequencing confirmation, and variant interpretation.[23]\n\nThe genes to be tested as part of a multigene panel are constantly changing. In some studies, the composition of multigene panels changed during the course of the study, usually to include more genes.[24]\n\nSome patient populations included a mix of patients already tested by traditional single-gene methods and those undergoing testing for the first time, making it difficult to establish true diagnostic yield.[25,26]\n\nIn the studies that replicated previous BRCA testing with a panel, the analytic validity of the NGS multigene panel tests is equivalent to the former single-gene tests, with almost 100% concordance in patients who had both single-gene BRCA testing and multigene testing.[25,26]\n\nIn high-risk individuals who meet criteria for hereditary cancer genetic testing but in whom no pathogenic variant was identified from single-gene testing, panel testing may identify other clinically actionable variants.[27,28] For example, the additional yield of multigene testing in individuals in whom a BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variant was not detected currently seems to be approximately 4%.[26,29,30] The most common non-BRCA pathogenic variants found are in CHEK2, ATM, and PALB2.[26,29-31] In some cases, the identification of pathogenic variants from panel testing resulted in additional recommendations for screening and risk reduction beyond what would have been indicated based on family history alone.[30,32-34]\n\nSelected reports from 2014 to 2018, which included 1,000 to 10,000 tested individuals, showed variation in pathogenic variant and VUS rates.[23,24,26,30,35-38] Pathogenic variant rates ranged from 7% to 14%; VUS rates ranged from 19% to 41% and increased with the number of genes included on the panel, but decreased in the later studies, likely because of larger data pools and refinements in variant interpretation. Additionally, VUS rates were higher in non-White individuals, likely because of the limited availability of test result data needed for accurate determination of risk.[38]\n\nA large study published by a commercial laboratory included more than 252,000 individuals who were tested with a 25-gene panel between 2013 and 2016.[39] The study population did not have prior cancer genetic testing, 97% were female, and 93% met NCCN criteria for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) or Lynch syndrome testing.
