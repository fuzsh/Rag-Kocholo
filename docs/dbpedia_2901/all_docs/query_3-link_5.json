        "text": "This section consists of language from OMB guidance that further demarcates, expands upon, or clarifies IT authorities assigned to agencies. This language directly or indirectly tasks the CIO with duties or responsibilities pertaining to IT leadership and accountability. See sections on OMB Memoranda and OMB Circulars for more information about these forms of OMB guidance. See sections on Office of Inspector General (OIG) and Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review how compliance with policies is measured.\n\nGovernance\n\nIn support of agency missions and business needs, and in coordination with program managers, agencies shall:\n\nDefine, implement, and maintain processes, standards, and policies applied to all information resources at the agency, in accordance with OMB guidance;\n\nRequire that the CIO, in coordination with appropriate governance boards, defines processes and policies in sufficient detail to address information resources appropriately. At a minimum, these processes and policies shall require that:\n\nInvestments and projects in development are evaluated to determine the applicability of agile development;\n\nOpen data standards are used to the maximum extent possible when implementing IT systems;\n\nAppropriate measurements are used to evaluate the cost, schedule, and overall performance variances of IT projects across the portfolio leveraging processes such as IT investment management, enterprise architecture, and other agency IT or performance management processes; (Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994.)\n\nThere are agency-wide policies and procedures for conducting IT investment reviews, operational analyses, or other applicable performance reviews to evaluate IT resources, including projects in development and ongoing activities;\n\nData and information needs are met through agency-wide data governance policies that clearly establish the roles, responsibilities, and processes by which agency personnel manage information as an asset and the relationships among technology, data, agency programs, strategies, legal and regulatory requirements, and business objectives; and\n\nUnsupported information systems and system components are phased out as rapidly as possible, and planning and budgeting activities for all IT systems and services incorporate migration planning and resourcing to accomplish this requirement;\n\nEnsure that the CIO is a member of governance boards that inform decisions regarding IT resources to provide for early matching of appropriate information resources with program objectives. The CIO may designate, in consultation with other senior agency officials, other agency officials to act as their representative to fulfill aspects of this responsibility so long as the CIO retains accountability;\n\nRequire that information security and privacy be fully integrated into the system development process;\n\nConduct TechStat reviews, led by the CIO, or use other applicable performance measurements to evaluate the use of agency information resources. The CIO may recommend to the agency head the modification, pause, or termination of any acquisition, investment, or activity that includes a significant IT component based on the CIO’s evaluation, within the terms of the relevant contracts and applicable regulations;\n\nEstablish and maintain a process for the CIO to regularly engage with program managers to evaluate IT resources supporting each agency strategic objective. It shall be the CIO and program managers’ shared responsibility to ensure that legacy and ongoing IT investments are appropriately delivering customer value and meeting the business objectives of the agency and the programs that support the agency; and\n\nMeasure performance in accordance with the GPRA Modernization Act and OMB Circular A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget. (OMB Circular A-130. Managing Information as a Strategic Resource. Policy. July 2016.)\n\nRisk Management\n\nCOVID-19 and Mission Delivery\n\nIn response to the national emergency for COVID-19, agencies are directed to use the breadth of available technology capabilities to fulfill service gaps and deliver mission outcomes. The [Harnessing Technology to Support Mission Continuity] “frequently asked questions” are intended to provide additional guidance and further assist the IT workforce as it addresses impacts due to COVID-19. Additional technology related questions should be directed to the Office of the Federal CIO at OFCIO@omb.eop.gov. OMB will continue to provide updates and additional information as needed to support the resiliency of agency missions. (OMB M-20-19. Harnessing Technology to Support Mission Continuity. March 2020.)\n\nProgram Management\n\nProgram Management Improvement Accountability Act (PMIAA) Implementing Strategy 1 - Coordinated Governance: Overview of Organizational Changes\n\nThe PMIAA [established] a new governance structure and function at agencies for advancing the practice of [program/project management (P/PM)] across the Federal Government. This section provides guidance to agencies by describing how agency COOs should integrate P/PM as a component of the agencies’ broader management capabilities, providing the role and responsibilities of the PMIO, and defining the functions and composition of the PMPC.\n\nRoles and Functions of the Program Management Improvement Officer (PMIO)\n\nImprovements in program management should lead to improved program performance and effectiveness that advance progress towards the achievement of agency strategic goals and objectives. In order to enhance and coordinate the practice and application of program management at agencies, PMIOs will: (OMB M-18-19. Improving the Management of Federal Programs and Projects through Implementing the Program Management Improvement Accountability Act (PMIAA). Appendix 2. June 2018.)\n\nCollaborate with and support CIOs to ensure IT programs and projects have trained and qualified program and project managers with the appropriate qualifications per the approved Federal IT PM Guidance Matrix and to enforce FITARA, OMB Memorandum M-04-19, and OMB Memorandum M-10-27 policy for IT programs.\n\nImplementing Acquisition Portfolio Reviews: Acquisition Program Management\n\nSeveral laws, regulations, and policies have provided direction for acquisition program management, including provisions in the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), the Clinger-Cohen Act, OMB’s Capital Programming Guide, and Part 34 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Agencies have developed detailed policies and procedures to implement these requirements, but too often, this guidance has not been reflected adequately in agency governance structures and protocols.\n\nIdentifying IT Programs vs. Non-IT Programs\n\nReviews of major acquisitions supporting IT programs shall build on portfolio reviews conducted pursuant to FITARA, 44 U.S.C. § 11319. Programs shall be considered IT programs if the investment scope is primarily information technology as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1. Programs with embedded systems or small IT components shall be considered non-IT, but collaboration with CIOs is expected for any significant components of the investment that involve IT. (Ibid, Appendix 5.)\n\nPortfolio Management\n\nData Management"
