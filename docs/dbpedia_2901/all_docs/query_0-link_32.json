        "text": "An address is the place where a person is living right now. It can be identified by such things as a street number, street name, apartment number, city, town, province/state and country.\n\nFor example: A student from Mexico studying in Canada should enter the address where he or she is living in Canada.\n\nA document becomes an affidavit when a person signs the document, in the presence of an authorized person, after taking an oath that what the document says is true and accurate.\n\nAn affidavit is often used in order to verify that a translation of a document accurately reflects what is stated in the original language of the document.\n\nAn individual who has received a decision from IRCC, and who thinks that an error was made in that decision, can generally apply to the Federal Court of Canada and ask that the Court review the decision. Making an application to the Court for a review of the decision is called an Application for Leave and Judicial Review. A review means that the Court will read the decision and decide whether an error was made or not. If the Court decides that IRCC made an error, it will usually mean that IRCC has to make a new decision.\n\nFor more information on this process, see Apply to the Federal Court of Canada for judicial review.\n\nA photocopy of an original document. It must be readable and certified as a true copy of the original by an authorized person. The person compares the documents and marks on the photocopy:\n\ntheir name and signature\n\ntheir position or title\n\nthe name of the original document\n\nthe date they certified the document\n\nthe phrase “I certify that this is a true copy of the original document.”\n\nIn Canada, examples of authorized persons who can certify the copies of your original documents include:\n\nnotary public\n\ncommissioner of oaths, or\n\ncommissioner of taking affidavits\n\nCheck with your provincial or territorial authorities to be sure who can certify your documents.\n\nOutside Canada, each country has different authorities to certify documents. A notary public may be able to certify your documents, but you should check with your local authorities to be sure.\n\nYou and your family members cannot certify copies of your documents. In this case, family member means your:\n\nparent\n\nguardian\n\nsibling\n\nspouse\n\ncommon-law partner\n\nconjugal partner\n\ngrandparent\n\nchild\n\naunt\n\nuncle\n\nniece\n\nnephew\n\nfirst cousin\n\nA certified translator is a member in good standing of a professional translation association in Canada or abroad. Their certification must be confirmed by a seal or stamp that shows the translator’s membership number.\n\nAll stamps and seals that are not in English or French must also be translated.\n\nAny family member, representative or consultant of the applicant who may be a lawyer, notary or translator is not permitted to translate documents.\n\nNote: A translator in the process of receiving their certification or accreditation is not considered a certified translator for IRCC’s purposes.\n\nSee Certified English or French translations\n\nThis term refers to an application process that allows a person who has committed or been convicted of a crime outside Canada to enter or stay in Canada. “Rehabilitation”, in this context, under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, means that the person is no longer considered inadmissible to Canada for a particular criminal offence.\n\nA person can apply for rehabilitation if at least five years have passed since the act was committed and all criminal sentences have been completed. In order to be approved for rehabilitation the applicant must show that they lead a stable life and are not likely to commit more crimes.\n\nSee Criminal inadmissibility, Deemed rehabilitation, Record suspension, Rehabilitation.\n\nA child who is under the maximum age and is not married or in a common law relationship. Generally, to qualify as dependants, children must\n\nbe under 22 years old\n\nnot have a spouse or common-law partner\n\nNote: a child’s age is usually “locked in” when we get a complete application.\n\nUse our online tool to check if your child qualifies as a dependant.\n\nException: Children who are at the age limit or older can qualify as “over-age” dependants if they\n\nhave depended on their parents for financial support since before they reached the age limit and\n\ncan’t financially support themselves due to a mental or physical condition\n\nPrevious age limits:\n\nThe age limit has changed in recent years. If your application has been in process for a while, one of the older definitions of dependent child may apply. Generally, we use the rules in place when we get your complete application. Previous age limits for a dependent child:\n\nFrom August 1, 2014 to October 23, 2017: under 19 years old\n\nOn or before July 31, 2014: under 22 years old\n\nNote: The rules for over-age dependants are different for applications that were submitted on or before July 31, 2014.\n\nThere are different types of dependent children. On your immigration application forms, you must select which type your dependent child is.\n\nYou can use our online tool to check which type of dependant your child is.\n\nType A\n\nThe dependant is under the age of 22 and single (not married and not in a common-law relationship).\n\nType B\n\nThis dependant type only applies if your child’s age was locked in before August 1, 2014.\n\nThe dependant has been continuously enrolled in, and in attendance, as a full‑time student at a post-secondary institution accredited by the relevant government authority and has depended substantially on the financial support of a parent either:\n\nsince before the age of 22, or\n\nsince marrying or entering into a common-law relationship (if it happened before the age of 22)\n\nType C\n\nThe dependant is 22 years of age or older, has depended substantially on the financial support of a parent since before the age of 22, and is unable to provide for himself or herself because of a medical condition.\n\nDependant types used on applications submitted between August 1, 2014, and October 23, 2017\n\nType 1\n\nThe dependant is under the age of 19 and single (not married and not in a common-law relationship).\n\nType 2\n\nThe dependant is 19 years of age or older, has been financially dependent on a parent since before the age of 19 due to a physical or mental condition.\n\nA school in Canada that a student must be accepted at before they can qualify for a study permit (as of June 1, 2014). Consult the designated learning institutions list (DLI) for schools at the post-secondary level.\n\nAll primary and secondary schools in Canada are automatically designated. They do not appear on the list. Applicants for primary and secondary schools do not need a DLI number on their application form.\n\nSee Secondary school.\n\nPeople who would not normally be eligible to become permanent residents of Canada may be able to apply on humanitarian and compassionate (H & C) grounds.\n\n(H & C) grounds apply to people with exceptional cases. Factors that are looked at include:\n\nhow settled the person is in Canada,\n\ngeneral family ties to Canada,\n\nthe best interests of any children involved, and\n\nthe degree of hardship that the applicant would experience if the request is not granted and they must leave Canada in order to apply for permanent residence.\n\n(H & C) decision makers will not look at the risk factors that are looked at in an in-Canada refugee protection claim or a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA). These factors which are outside the scope of an (H & C) application include persecution, danger of torture or risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n\nA Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) is a document that an employer in Canada must usually get before hiring a foreign worker.\n\nA positive LMIA will show that there is a need for a foreign worker to fill the job and that no Canadian worker can do the job. A positive LMIA is sometimes called a Confirmation letter.\n\nIf you need an LMIA, your employer must send an application to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC).\n\nA letter from a person in Canada on behalf of a friend or family member who wants to visit. This may be helpful if the visitor is from a country where visas are required to travel to and enter Canada.\n\nThe letter should explain how they plan to help the visitor and whether they have the financial means to support the person during a longer visit.\n\nWhen a person makes false statements, submits false information, submits false or altered documents, or withholds information relevant to their application to IRCC. This is a crime. Documents can include:\n\nPassports and travel documents;\n\nVisas;\n\nDiplomas, degrees, and apprenticeship or trade papers;\n\nBirth, marriage, final divorce, annulment, separation or death certificates;\n\nPolice certificates.\n\nLying on an application or in an interview with an IRCC officer is also an offence under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and the Citizenship Act.\n\nMisrepresentation bars a person from being granted Canadian citizenship for a period of 5 years.\n\nIf misrepresentation is found to have occurred after someone becomes a citizen, this can result in the revocation of their citizenship and this individual must wait ten years before they can be granted citizenship again.\n\nFor applicants who apply on or after October 11, 2017, this is the amount of time a permanent resident must be physically present in Canada to be eligible for a grant of Canadian citizenship.\n\nApplicants who apply under subsection 5(1) must be physically present in Canada for at least 1,095 days in the five years immediately before the date of application. This includes time as a:\n\npermanent resident (PR)\n\ntemporary resident (lawfully authorized to remain in Canada)\n\nprotected person\n\nThese requirements do not apply to children under 18 years old who apply under subsection 5(2).\n\nExceptions apply for certain Crown servants and certain family members of Crown servants.\n\nAn institution that provides an education to students who have completed elementary school. These schools usually include grades 9 through 12 (although, in some areas, they start with grade 7). In the province of Quebec, secondary grades are called grades 1 through 5.\n\nApplicants for primary and secondary schools do not need a designated learning institution (DLI) number on their application form.\n\nA service provider organization (SPO) is an agency that provides services for newcomers to Canada.\n\nService provider organizations offer programs that can give newcomers resources and training to live and work in Canada. Their programs can help refugees who often have a difficult time with day-to-day tasks like finding an apartment, taking public transportation, or making a doctor’s appointment.\n\nThese organizations can also help refugees complete forms, get permanent resident cards, health insurance, social insurance numbers, etc. They also offer interpretation and translation services to help with such special needs as giving medical backgrounds to doctors.\n\nVisit IRCC’s website for more information on the many services provided by SPOs.\n\nYour surname is your family name. When filling out applications, type your surname as it appears on your passport, travel or identity document or any letters you got from the visa office or case processing centre where you sent your application (even if the name is misspelled). Do not use initials.\n\nIf you do not have a surname on your passport, travel or identity document, enter all your given name(s) in the surname field and leave the given name field blank.\n\nTaxation years are the same as calendar years (January 1 to December 31). To be eligible for an adult grant of citizenship, you must have met your personal income tax filing obligations in 3 taxation years that are fully or partially within the 5 years immediately before the date you apply.\n\nExample:\n\nYou apply for an adult grant of citizenship on June 1, 2019. The taxation years that fall fully or partially within the 5 years immediately before the date of application are 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. 2019 cannot be used, as you would not yet have filed taxes for 2019.\n\nThis program allows employers to hire foreign workers to fill short-term labour and skill shortages when no Canadians are available to do the job. A Labour Market Impact Assessment is needed to hire through this program.\n\nForeign workers hired as part of this program are referred to as temporary foreign workers. They may get a work permit only after a Labour Market Impact Assessment has concluded that no Canadians are available to do the job.\n\nSee Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA).\n\nAn official counterfoil document issued by a visa office abroad that is placed in a person’s passport to show that he or she has met the requirements for admission to Canada as a temporary resident (a visitor, student or worker). A counterfoil is a specially designed sticker on which missions abroad print visa information.\n\nInformally known as a visitor or tourist visa, the TRV may be issued for single or multiple entries to Canada.\n\nSee Multiple-entry visa, Single-entry visa, Visitor visa.\n\nAn official counterfoil document issued by a visa office abroad that is placed in a person’s passport to show that he or she has met the requirements for admission to Canada as a temporary resident (a visitor, student or worker). A counterfoil is a specially designed sticker on which missions abroad print visa information.\n\nCanadian visas include:\n\ntemporary resident visas (sometimes called visitor visas) and\n\npermanent resident visas.\n\nAt missions abroad, controlled documents are comprised of counterfoils and seals, which are issued together as a visa. Counterfoils are the documents on which missions print visa information. Seals are documents that are affixed over counterfoils when they are placed in an applicant’s passport to prevent tampering.\n\nVisa application centres (VACs) help you submit temporary residence applications to a visa office for a fee. They can serve you in your preferred language and provide services to areas without easy access to a visa office.\n\nVACs receive applications, check that they are complete and send them to the correct visa office for processing. They don’t represent the Government of Canada and don’t make decisions on your application.\n\nThey don’t offer advice about the programs you should apply to, how to answer questions on your application or any other immigration topic.\n\nVisiting student: Students at a foreign institution (home institution) who attend a post-secondary Canadian institution (host institution) for a determined period (not a full degree or program) with the intent of transferring the credits earned at the host institution back to their home institution. Visiting students pay fees to the host institution.\n\nExchange student: Similar to a visiting student as they attend a host institution in Canada. Exchange students do not pay tuition fees to their host institution as these fees are covered by an exchange agreement between the host and home institutions."
