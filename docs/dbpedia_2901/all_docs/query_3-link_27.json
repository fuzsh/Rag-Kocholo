        "text": "Our History\n\nFounding of the OCC and the National Banking System\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln recognized that the United States' fragmented banking and monetary system needed tighter structure and order. On February 25, 1863, President Lincoln signed the National Currency Act into law, creating the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and charging it with responsibility for organizing and administering a system of nationally chartered banks and a uniform national currency.\n\nHugh McCulloch: The OCC's First Comptroller\n\nPresident of the Bank of Indiana, Hugh McCulloch had come to Washington to fight against the national banking legislation that had been signed by President Lincoln in February 1863. Ironically, he ultimately became its champion and proved to be an industrious, able administrator as the first Comptroller of the Currency. He went on to serve two terms as Secretary of the Treasury."
