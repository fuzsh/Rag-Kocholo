Once we received training for CGM and insulin pumps, life became more accessible. One positive point is that we've changed our lifestyle habits, such as having a healthier diet.\n\nPitso Molemane (South Africa)\n\nI consider myself \"a living testament\" to a long life with diabetes. I fight the condition daily with a healthy diet, treatment and exercise. I will not let it control my life.\n\nRuslan Zakiyev (Kazakhstan)\n\nBoth my sons live with type 1 diabetes. My story shows that much of what we think we are inventing for our children has, in fact, already been done in other countries. This sharing of experiences has empowered me and others in our journey."
