The central task of BfR is the scientific risk assessment and its communication of food, feed, substances, and products as the basis for the consumer protection activities of the federal government. The BfR also performs the role of the German Centre for the Protection of Laboratory Animals (Bf3R) and coordinates activities with the goal of reducing animal experiments to the necessary minimum and providing the best possible protection for laboratory animals."
