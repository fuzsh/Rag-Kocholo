        "text": "We envision a future where equity-minded educational professionals lead lasting and positive change for the learning and benefit of everyone.\n\nThe Carnegie Project on the Education Doctorate (CPED) transforms the advanced preparation of educational professionals to lead through scholarly practice for the improvement of individuals and communities.\n\nHistory\n\nWith the support of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (CFAT) under the leadership of then President Dr. Lee Shulman and the backing of the Council for Academic Deans of Research Education Institutions (CADREI), The Carnegie Project on the Education Doctorate (CPED) began in 2007. With 25 member institutions and a small pot of funds from the Carnegie Foundation, CPED created an ambitious goal to redesign doctoral preparation for professional practitioners. Today, CPED is an active international network with over 135 member institutions.\n\nMembership\n\nBroad and diverse membership is central to CPED’s success. Annually, CPED invites schools and colleges of education from around the world to join its 135+ member institutions in the work of transforming the EdD into the professional practice doctorate in education. Through professional development opportunities and a wide range of resources, CPED member institutions and their faculty learn to redesign their EdD programs to better serve practitioners. Benefits of membership include a professional development network that supports schools and colleges of education in EdD program design, annual Convenings, virtual events, resources to access national data, opportunities for collaboration and publication.\n\nExplore Membership\n\nThe Framework©\n\nThrough a collaborative, authentic process, members of CPED developed a Framework for EdD program design that supports creating quality, rigorous practitioner preparation while honoring the local context of each member institution. The three-part Framework for EdD redesign includes a new definition of EdD, a set of guiding principles for program development, and a set of design concepts that serve as program building blocks. CPED members are often at different phases in the process; as they engage in the consortium, they utilize the Framework© to design/redesign, evaluate, and improve their programs.\n\nSee the Framework®\n\nJOIN US FOR THE 2024 CPED CONVENING!\n\nOctober 14-17, 2024\n\nHosted by the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa in Honolulu, HI\n\nThe signature activity of CPED is our annual convening. Take the time to engage with your fellow member institutions in a variety of formats through idea-centered Exchanges.\n\nRegistration, hotel, and exchange information are available HERE.\n\nTHE COMING OF AGE OF THE EDUCATION DOCTORATE SERIES\n\nThe mission of The Coming of Age of the Education Doctorate series is to present volumes of research and work focused on the redesign of the Education Doctorate (EdD) and the past 16+ years that faculty and schools of education around the US and the world have made to professionalize this degree for the advanced preparation of educational practitioners. Specifically, this series will highlight efforts to enhance and enrich the purpose, curriculum, and milestone experiences in the EdD in addition to highlighting the work of those who have graduated from redesigned EdD programs.
