        "text": "In 2021, through grassroots advocacy, the Morgan Junction community expressed overwhelming public support for adding an All-Wheels Recreation Area to the Morgan Junction Park Addition. The Morgan Junction All-Wheels Association is an all-volunteer group of community members who are working in harmony to assist Seattle Parks with the integration of a free, public all-wheels terrain at Morgan Junction Park.\n\nOur team recently received a Seattle Department of Neighborhoods Neighborhood Matching Fund grant to carry out a feasibility study for the all-wheels area, and are working hard to ensure that the project is inclusive of all stakeholders, and that the design is driven by public input and engagement."
