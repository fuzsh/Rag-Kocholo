Check out some of our favorites here.\n\nView all Projects\n\nPROCESS\n\nOur students lead every step of the process. From conducting interviews and leading the design process, to running power tools and pouring concrete, they bring ideas from concept to completion.\n\nBUILD\n\nLearn to make a house. Learn physics. Work with a team to build projects that will be part of the community for years.\n\nBRIGHTER TOMORROW\n\nREVOLUTION\n\nWhat does it mean to change the world? The change happens in people's minds, but also in the physical world. We want to make our world liveable, inclusive, and healthy for the people who live in it. That means we have to take ownership of our spaces, our tools, and our way of thinking.\n\nTEACH\n\nWe believe that collaboration leads to the best results, both for each builder and for the project as a whole. That's why we pair people of different ability levels to ensure everyone benefits.\n\nGROW\n\nThe skills learned at Sawhorse are useful, both on the job site and off. Collaborative work, design thinking, and community engagement are crucial tools in an office, a classroom, and in the world."
