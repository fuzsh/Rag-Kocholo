        "text": "Summary\n\nThis publication is comprised of four parts.\n\nThis guide is designed to help funders and those who implement programs realize their ambitious social change efforts. It explores theory of change models, processes and products as well as key theory of change concepts, benefits and limitations.\n\nWhat Is a Theory of Change Model?\n\nA theory of change is both a conceptual model and a concrete product that reflects the model. A fundamental component of any large-scale social change effort, theory of change can help teams strengthen strategies and maximize results by charting out the work ahead, what success looks like and how to get there.\n\nDeveloping a theory of change model involves making explicit collective assumptions about how a change will unfold. This work can help the funders and leaders of a social change effort clearly articulate their objectives, discuss equity considerations, define roles of decision-making authority and enable useful measurement and learning.\n\nWhy a Theory of Change Is Important\n\nA theory of change serves as a good basis for measurement, experimentation and learning. It can help teams test assumptions related to adapting and implementing strategies and clarify complicated pathways to change. For approaches that are complex — where the operating environment is fluid and unpredictable and may influence a strategy or its implementation in an unknown way — a theory of change is an especially important tool. It serves as a compass, illuminating the desired goals, informing adaptations and identifying opportunities for meaningful measurement.\n\nAbout The Guide\n\nThe Annie E. Casey Foundation first commissioned ORS Impact to develop a practical theory of change guide in 2004. Since then — in recognition of how this work has changed over the years — the Foundation commissioned an updated guide. This new resource reflects how theory of change thinking has evolved by:\n\nexplicitly identifying how a theory of change can and should advance equity and engage community members in meaningful ways; and\n\nproviding detailed explanations about what it takes to develop inclusive theories of change and use them to advance powerful, sustained results.\n\nThe guide is organized into four parts.\n\nPart one, covered in this entry, introduces theory of change work including its benefits, considerations and limitations.\n\nPart two delivers step-by-step guidance — including considerations, exercises and examples — to aid program leaders in articulating and documenting a useful, equitable theory of change.\n\nPart three offers fillable theory of change templates that can help teams record their theory of change components, assumptions and audiences.\n\nPart four offers examples of theory of change models."
