        "text": "Medical Science Overview\n\nMedical Science Directors: Emily Moorefield, PhD and Evan Raff, MD\n\nThere are nine individual Medical Science courses distributed throughout the three semesters of the Foundation Phase. They include: The Patient, Molecules to Cells, Circulation, Homeostasis, Body regulation, Reproductive and Genitourinary Health, Neurons to Networks, Life Stages, and Integrated Systems.\n\nView Medical Science Course Descriptions\n\nPatient Centered Care (PCC) Overview\n\nCourse Directors: Tommy Koonce, MD and Christopher Klipstein, MD\n\nThis course develops basic clinical skills and reasoning essential to the practice of medicine through clinical experiences, longitudinal contact with medical professionals, and intentional integration with the concepts the Medical Science and Social and Health Systems courses. PCC is designed to enable the student to learn the core clinical skills—History-Taking, Physical Examination, Communication, Clinical Reasoning, Patient-Centered Care, and Professionalism— necessary for future patient care. The Patient Centered Care course is based primarily on weekly small group sessions where students learn clinical skills. In addition to these small group sessions, students will participate in Clinical Skills Encounters (CSEs) with standardized patients in the school’s Simulation, Experiential Learning, and Training (SET) Center.This course meets once a week for three hours each semester of the Foundation Phase.\n\nSocial and Health Systems (SHS) Overview\n\nCourse Directors: Raúl Necochea, PhD and Barry Saunders, MD\n\nThis course explores the socio-cultural, political, legal, and ethical dimensions of medical care through research, small-group discussion, and intentional integration with concepts from the Medical Science and Patient Centered Care courses. It also provides a structure for students to reflect on, develop, and track professional goals through faculty mentorships. The core of this course is the directed discussion that takes place in seminar groups. Course faculty members come from clinical, social science, and humanities backgrounds, bringing significant experience in interdisciplinary research and teaching to the seminar sessions. This course meets once a week for two hours each semester of the Foundation Phase."
