        "text": "Agile has become a foundational concept now in software development and it would be fair to say no industry or organization would be untouched with one or more concepts in their business operations.\n\nThe path towards agile adoption and maturity, although very exciting, is also quite challenging. This is driven by the diversity of context and dynamism around the IT organizations. One of the major contributors to this dynamism is the IT attrition which has been increasing continuously in previous years and further expected to rise3.\n\nIf we study the Agile Manifesto, two of the four values:\n\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\n\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\n\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\n\nResponding to change over following a plan\n\n...and 5 of the 12 principles are related to people only, which emphasizes the importance of people and interactions in agile software development:\n\nOur highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\n\nWelcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.\n\nDeliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.\n\nBusiness people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.\n\nBuild projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.\n\nThe most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.\n\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress.\n\nAgile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\n\nContinuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.\n\nSimplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.\n\nThe best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\n\nAt regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly\n\nIn view of the above points, it may not be an exaggeration to say that one of the major contributors to an agile project's success or failure are people in some way or the other.\n\nWhen it comes to people and self-organized high-performing teams, mutual trust comes in mind as the foundational and one of the most critical factors. With the level of dynamism around people as mentioned above, this becomes even more important. It may not solve all problems in agile software development, but if focused on well it can substantially reduce the problems and significantly improve the chances of project success.\n\nThis article focuses on mutual trust in the context of agile software development, the 7 principles, and related steps on how this can be achieved towards building self-organizing and high-performing teams.\n\nMutual Trust\n\nDefinition\n\nTrust is confidence in the honesty or integrity of a person or thing, delivering what you promise and being loyal to those around you. An example of trust is the belief that someone is being truthful. Trust is important between each and every individual and every society in the world.\n\nMutual trust is a shared belief that you can depend on each other to achieve a common purpose.\n\nWhy Is It Important?\n\nHelps in building positive organizational culture. Mutual trust is the building block of any organizational culture. If you trust the people you work with, you can be open and honest in your thoughts and actions, and you don't have to waste time and energy overthinking and worrying about what to share and not share. With low trust, even the slightest problem can become a conflict scenario, with high trust even a big issue can get resolved without even being noticed.\n\nEmployee engagement and overall satisfaction of employees increase. When you trust your colleagues, you form a powerful bond that helps you to be more engaged and satisfied, and also brings in a sense of belongingness to the team and the organization.\n\nTeam productivity goes up. If you trust the people you work with, there is a strong focus on accomplishing the team goal with a drive to collaborate and support each other leading to better outcomes.\n\nHelps in building a safe environment. Studies have shown that teams that are not afraid of failure and feel safe are more likely to drive innovation, have productive retrospectives that result in improvements, and solve their own issues.\n\nSelf-Organization and Mutual Trust\n\nSelf-organization is about the teams deciding by themselves how to execute the tasks, manage processes, and monitor progress. Self-organizing teams design their own activities that culminate in final project deliveries.\n\nAn environment of Mutual Trust is a prerequisite for a self-organizing team. Without trust, self-organization cannot be achieved.\n\nHigh Performance and Mutual Trust\n\nHigh performance in an agile context is driven by overall team performance rather than individual performance. The belief is that the overall team performance is greater than the sum of the individual performances.\n\nThis is understandable, as the style of management shifts from “command and control” to “servant leadership,” giving much more control to the team. Unless the team performance is focused upon, high performance cannot be achieved for the team.\n\nAn environment of mutual trust goes a long way in laying down the foundation for high-performing teams. Without trust, a team's high performance cannot be achieved. Even if it is achieved, it cannot be sustained for the long term.\n\nBuilding Mutual Trust\n\nNow let’s take a deeper look at what the core principles that create trust are. The following principles address all interactions within an agile team and with stakeholders. The principles described below might seem to be unrelated and disjointed, but they all try to drive towards a common goal of building an environment of mutual trust.\n\nThe initiative should start with leadership and the same to be fostered as culture in teams. The principles are written w.r.t. individuals and their interactions. All individual interactions should keep in mind these concepts towards building an environment of mutual trust.\n\nThe application of these principles would not be a one-step quick short-term process but a continuous long-term effort from leadership till the environment is successfully built. Once built it has to be maintained with continuous efforts in training and mentoring the teams.\n\nThe 7 Key Principles\n\n1. Making Yourself Vulnerable\n\nIt’s important that you are approachable. A simple technique is to make yourself vulnerable.\n\nIf you are seen as a person that is perfect it would be difficult for people to connect with you.\n\nVulnerability is the driving force of connection. It’s brave. It’s tender. It’s impossible to connect without it.\n\nA few examples of how you can make yourself vulnerable are as follows:\n\nSharing with someone something personal about yourself that you would normally hold back\n\nSharing past failures or mistakes that you have made which people may not be aware about\n\n2. Active Listening\n\nTo actively listen, you need to fully concentrate, understand, respond, and then remember what is being said.\n\nEncourage others to talk about themselves, Become genuinely interested in other people and demonstrate that you really give importance to the other person rather than yourself.\n\nMutual trust is about the other person—not you. This is another way that trust will come automatically.\n\nA few techniques for practicing active listening are as follows:\n\nBe fully present in the conversation maintaining good eye contact\n\nPay attention to non-verbal cues in addition to understanding the topic discussed\n\nListen more, be patient, and reflect on what you hear\n\nRestate, validate and ask questions to drive the conversation\n\n3. Culture of Learning\n\nLearning never stops, and there is a lot you can learn from everyone.\n\nYou may feel you may know more than the other person in a particular area, but there would be a long list of areas where you can learn from the other person.\n\nThe moment you have a feeling that you do not have anything to learn from the other person, mutual trust will cease to exist.\n\nBelow are some techniques by which a culture of learning can be created and developed in an organization:\n\nMake learning a habit for anyone and everyone in the organization by making it easy and rewarding\n\nEstablish a drive that is supported by the organizational goals to share best practices and learnings within the organization\n\n4. Open Communication\n\nTruth is not the same as trust. Truth is a fact; trust is a feeling.\n\nPeople need truth to build trust. Openness is critical for, “Without openness, trust is blind.”\n\nThere are certain things you cannot share and other things you can share.\n\nBe transparent about sharing what you can, and give reasons for not sharing what you cannot.\n\nBelow are several techniques to support open communication:\n\nStructured and mandated communication channels across the organization, such as one-on-one meetings, skip-level meetings, leadership meetings, town halls, email communications, newsletters, etc.\n\nRegular and anonymous employee surveys\n\n360 degree reviews\n\nThird party/independent exit interviews\n\nInformal gatherings and team parties\n\nEnvironments supporting anyone talking to anyone without restrictions\n\nMechanisms to address employee grievances\n\n5. Actions Speak Louder Than Words\n\nTalk is educational and edifying, but actions are evidence. Provide iconic tangible evidence for what you are claiming can be trusted. Try taking actions and let them speak for themselves. The impact of one small action is much more than a thousand words. Do not promise anything that you cannot do or do not intend to do, and also do not miss anything that you already promised. Follow the principle of “under-promise and over deliver.”\n\nThe following are some ways in which this principle can be established:\n\nAll meetings and discussions should have a clear agenda, tracking what items were met/not met\n\nPerformance management systems should have quantifiable goals\n\nMature issue resolution/grievance redressal mechanism with tracking of issues till closure\n\n6. Appreciation in Public, Feedback in Private\n\nWe all have a high number of strengths and we all do a lot of great things every day.\n\nFinding strengths in others and opportunities for appreciation can do wonders in building trust.\n\nAlthough it is fine to give constructive feedback to persons/teams, care should be taken to do it in private, making sure the recipient is willing and in the right state of mind to receive it. It’s ok to not give any feedback if the environment is not conducive.\n\nCriticism and/or gossiping in absentia is the biggest trust killer.\n\nThis principle can be implemented using the following techniques:\n\nAn environment of mutual appreciation or a peer reward program\n\nRewards and recognition framework\n\nMature performance management framework\n\n7.
