        "text": "Media Contact: Sophia Fahleson | Digital Communications Specialist | 405-744-7063 | sophia.fahleson@okstate.edu\n\nShane Robinson stepped into his new role as head of the Oklahoma State University Department of Agricultural Education, Communications and Leadership on June 1.\n\nRobinson, a Hollis, Oklahoma, native, grew up in a household of teachers, allowing him to discover a passion for teaching and mentoring. As a youth livestock exhibitor, he found a love for agriculture, which led him to a career path that combined both passions.\n\n“I learned early on that both agriculture and people matter, and they matter significantly,” Robinson said. “We should care deeply about both.”\n\nRobinson received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in agricultural studies from the Ferguson College of Agriculture and earned a doctorate in agricultural education from the University of Missouri. An OSU faculty member since 2007, he has taught courses in agricultural education and graduate studies.\n\nIn addition to his teaching appointment, Robinson served as associate director for the Institute for Teaching and Learning Excellence. He has also sat on several graduate student research committees, chairing many award-winning dissertations and theses.\n\nIn his new role, Robinson will create connectedness among students and faculty.\n\n“My goal is to synergize our team around a shared vision of improving the impact of our scholarship for our students, citizens and world,” he said. “Such vision requires a persistent pursuit of excellence, and it requires us to work together and use each other’s unique talents and strengths.”\n\nRobinson said meeting this goal begins with ensuring faculty members teach students quality and meaningful material.\n\n“Quality teachings lay the foundation of learning by moving through content methodically to ensure students are grasping the ideas and concepts needed to be successful,” Robinson said. “Once students begin to develop a deeper understanding of the content, the role of the teacher is to allow students to take ownership of their learning by applying the content to their lives.”\n\nRobinson recognizes the growing need for social scientists in the agricultural industry, and he hopes to prepare agricultural education, communications and leadership students to work through difficult problems.\n\n“The problems facing Americans, as it relates to agriculture, are deep and intense,” Robinson said. “Feeding growing populations and having an abundance of clean, safe drinking water are important issues that are going to need social scientists, like those in our department, to work with technical scientists to solve.”\n\nRobinson said the impact of the department extends beyond campus and into Oklahoma communities.\n\n“The land-grant mission allows us to extend our reach outside the walls of our classrooms and help our stakeholders in all 77 Oklahoma counties.” Robinson said.\n\nWith the new Agricultural Hall construction nearing completion, Robinson said he looks forward to the future of the agricultural education, communications and leadership department, and leading the charge as department head.\n\n“We are poised to make a significant impact on the way agriculture is perceived through our teaching, communication networks and leadership avenues,” Robinson said. “I will work relentlessly to help our department’s students and faculty reach their optimal capacity.”"
