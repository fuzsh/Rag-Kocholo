        "text": "Be honest, how hard do you work for people who don’t respect you? A few of you may work harder trying to earn their respect. Most of us, however, decide to conserve our energy for those who appreciate the work we are doing. It’s human nature to do more for those who like us and believe in us.\n\nLoyalty and trust come from mutual respect and are the foundations on which all winning team relationships are built. Teams that have loyalty and trust will go above-and-beyond for each other and achieve extreme performance. My adventure racing team wouldn’t have become world champions if we didn’t trust each other. If you want to build loyalty and trust you need to build mutual respect, which can be done in five ways.\n\nRemember the Aluminum Can Theory\n\nThe Aluminium Can Theory is an entertaining concept created by Alan Brunacini, one of the most inspiring and engaging Fire Chiefs in history (and one of my personal heroes). He said, “When you have a disagreement with someone on your crew and you’re compelled to go right to the one terrible comment that you know will take them to their knees. Remember that comment is an aluminum can—it’s going to stay in the environment forever.”\n\nWorld Class Teams never let those aluminum cans come between teammates. They consistently avoid gossip, criticism, and backstabbing, as those behaviors will destroy a hard-won trust. Conversely, there are Positive Aluminium Cans (i.e., telling a teammate how impactful, amazing, or talented they are and why), and great teammates will share them in abundance.\n\nMentor unselfishly\n\nWhen I worked in pharmaceutical sales, the top salesperson was always sharing his sales tips. Month after month, he would email us his secrets and insights and still remained on top. I wondered how he could stay on top by helping everyone else? So one day I asked him. He said every time he sent out his tips, he would get a dozen or more tips in reply from other salespeople that would help him improve.\n\nExtreme performance teammates understand the power of sharing knowledge. They are consistently bringing one another up to speed on best practices, the latest techniques, and new discoveries. Everyone gets better…together. Always be wary of “teammates” who derive their power by knowing things that others don’t know.\n\nAct like a team always and the feelings will follow\n\nLet’s face it—it’s easy being teammates when things are going well and we’re all rested. But things don’t always go well. And we’re not always going to feel all fluffy and like a purple dinosaur about each other (I love you, you love me).\n\nExtreme performance for teams is about always acting like a great leader or great teammate, regardless of how things are going. If you keep treating your teammates with respect even when things aren’t going well between you, then you can keep performing like a team. Bottom line: acting like a team is more important than feeling like a team. The positive feelings will always come back when our actions inspire them.\n\nBelieve in teammates beyond reason\n\nWhen I was adventure racing in Ecuador, I had to climb the ice-covered, 19,700 foot Cotopaxi volcano. Even though I was a seasoned athlete, I hadn’t adjusted to the high altitudes and I was the newest and most inexperienced member of the team. But because my team believed in me, it gave me the power, physically and mentally to get to the top of that ice-covered volcano.\n\nWhat happens when someone believes in us? It makes us want to rise to the occasion and prove them right. And if someone doesn’t believe in us? We tend to fall to whatever level they see us at. Belief in someone is a powerful force and a gift great teammates give to one another every day.\n\nGive respect as a gift—not as a grade\n\nYou will get more from your team if you give them respect for their intelligence and abilities from the start. I learned this the hard way when I was a rookie firefighter. In my first week out of the fire academy, I was placed with a crusty, veteran firefighter. In the very first drill, l I made a rookie mistake. I turned the hose toggle left instead of right and got myself soaked and bruised in front of him and our crew.\n\nHowever, he didn’t mock or degrade me. Instead, he told me he knew I had learned the lesson in the best possible way and that I’d never forget it now—versus “showing me.” I ended up working with him for the next seven years until he retired.\n\nWhen respect is given as a gift and not withheld as a grade, teammates feel valued, worthy, engaged, free to learn, and have increased ownership of outcomes. Respect is also the super glue that bonds teammates together in times of great challenge and change."
