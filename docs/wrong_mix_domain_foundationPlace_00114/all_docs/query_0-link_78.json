        "text": "The ocean is more than what you can see on the horizon. Beneath the surface lies our planet’s most complex ecosystems, full of life and potential for exploration and learning, where each inhabitant has a role to play in building a thriving environment.\n\nDuring the 2024-2025 FIRST season, FIRST®DIVE presented by Qualcomm, teams will use their STEM and collaboration skills to explore life beneath the surface of the ocean. Along the way, we’ll uncover the potential in each of us to strengthen our community and innovate for a better world with healthy oceans. Join us as we explore the future.\n\nGracious Professionalism\n\nGracious Professionalism is part of the ethos of FIRST. It’s a way of doing things that encourages highquality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community. It is part of pursuing a meaningful life. One can add to society and enjoy the satisfaction of knowing one has acted with integrity and sensitivity.\n\nCoopertition\n\nCoopertition is displaying unqualified kindness and respect in the face of fierce competition. It is founded on the concept and a philosophy that teams can and should help and cooperate with each other even as they compete. Coopertition means competing always, but assisting and enabling others when you can."
