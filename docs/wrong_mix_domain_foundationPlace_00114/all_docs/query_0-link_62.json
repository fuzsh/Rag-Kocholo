        "text": "Overview\n\nNational-scale societal challenges cannot be solved by a single discipline. Instead, these challenges require convergence: the merging of innovative ideas, approaches, and technologies from a wide and diverse range of sectors and expertise.\n\nLaunched in 2019, the NSF Convergence Accelerator builds upon basic research and discovery to accelerate solutions toward societal impact. The program funds teams to solve societal challenges through convergence research and innovation. To enhance its impact, the Accelerator also places teams together in cohorts, synergizing their work through facilitated collaboration.\n\nWhile the overarching goal of the program is to enable long-lasting societal impact, results for each solution and the way a solution transitions to societal impact will vary. Examples include:\n\nIntegration of a solution into existing systems.\n\nProduction of open-source tools and knowledge products.\n\nExpansion of a solution into new markets.\n\nFollow-on funding and investment.\n\nSubmit an idea during the ideation process: Each year the program releases a Dear Colleague Letter, Request for Information, DCL/RFI, to gather ideas from the community at large. Promising ideas are selected by the Convergence Accelerator and further explored in funded workshops, described below.\n\nFurther an idea through a workshop: NSF funds workshops on promising ideas submitted during the ideation process. Workshops are held to further develop an idea, incorporating convergence research and various disciplines and expertise. NSF promotes the workshops to allow researchers and innovators to engage in workshop dialogues. If an idea that you submitted during the ideation process is chosen by NSF, the program may ask you to lead the development of a workshop on that topic.\n\nForm a team and apply to a convergence research solicitation: Each year the program releases a solicitation funding opportunity featuring several convergent research topics selected from the program’s ideation process. Researchers and innovators are encouraged to apply. The submitted project team must represent a mix of disciplines, expertise and organizations from academia, industry, nonprofits, government, and other communities of practice and sectors.\n\nContribute to a currently funded solution: Cross-cutting partnerships are vital to the Convergence Accelerator and the funded teams. Partners provide expertise, represent end users, provide resources, services and infrastructure, or support a transition or educational pathway. View currently funded teams at the Convergence Accelerator’s portfolio page or reach out to a program director to learn more.\n\nBe a reviewer: Provide your expertise to assist NSF in funding the best research ideas and solutions. If you are interested in serving as a reviewer for future proposals or site visits, please fill out the Convergence Accelerator reviewer form."
