This helps to keep the material and ideas “front of mind” for attendees whilst giving some space for reflection (and normal work activities).\n\nThe workshops are delivered by authorized Team Topologies Learning Partners (TTLPs).\n\nA common language for organizational design\n\nThe Getting Started with Team Topologies workshop is intended to educate leaders, managers and other staff members about how to begin using the Team Topologies principles and practices in a specific organization. Using carefully curated exercises, this workshop aims to help participants to learn via hands-on practice enabling them to easily articulate and engage with their peers using the common language of organizational design that Team Topologies surfaces and leads to higher quality conversations about team interactions."
