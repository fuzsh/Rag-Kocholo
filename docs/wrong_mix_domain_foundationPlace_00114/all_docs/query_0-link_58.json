Mutant Optics will be on display from July 2024 to February 2025.\n\nThe Henry is also debuting LOVERULES, which brings together nearly 100 works by well-known artist and activist Hank Willis Thomas. Through photography, print, sculpture, neon, and mixed media, LOVERULES explores the impact of corporate branding; the construction of gender, race, and race relations; stereotypes and exploitation; and the struggle for liberty and equality. In his art, Thomas invites us to see and challenge systems of inequality and to explore important contemporary questions: What is the role of art for civic life? How does visual culture create narratives that shape our notion of who counts in society? LOVERULES will travel to other museum venues in the U.S. after its debut at the Henry Art Gallery – located on the University of Washington’s beautiful campus.
