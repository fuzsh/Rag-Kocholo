In June 2022, environmental leaders from around the world met to take stock of where we've been and where we are heading, with the goal of galvanizing momentum for the UN Decade of Action for achieving the SDGs.\n\nThese conferences are major milestones in sustainable development governance. But their real test comes from the work that happens every day, from individuals and local communities to international organizations and beyond.\n\nAt IISD, we are honoured to be part of the community working towards a world where people and the planet thrive."
