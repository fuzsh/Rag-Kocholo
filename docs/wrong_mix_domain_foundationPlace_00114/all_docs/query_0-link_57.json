        "text": "In Mock Trial, teens across the State receive a case in October and work as a team to become witnesses and attorneys. Students compete throughout the winter and early spring in District Tournaments with the goal of making it to the State Championship in the spring. Throughout Mock Trial, students will gain public speaking skills and critical thinking experience in addition to working closely with their peers as a team.\n\nOur mock trial program can be hosted in a classroom for civics credits, as an after-school club, in a community center, or in a local Y or youth group program. If you want more information about participating and registering as a YMCA Mock Trial team, please contact Gaby Diamond.\n\nThe State Competition will be held on March 22-24, 2024.\n\nCoach Resources"
