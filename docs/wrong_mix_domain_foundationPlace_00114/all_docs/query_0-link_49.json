        "text": "A Launchpad for New Business Ideas\n\nThe Innovation & Entrepreneurship Center's Business Plan Competition was started in 1998 by Professor Emerita Dr. Harriet Stephenson, a Seattle University faculty member who began teaching in 1967. When asked what the impetus was in starting it, she said, \"Building credibility. We wanted to be part of the leadership pack in developing entrepreneurship programs on the West Coast.\"\n\nThe Harriet Stephenson Business Plan Competition (HSBPC) is designed to help students and alumni in launching new business ventures, including for-profit businesses, not-for-profit businesses, corporate entrepreneurship, and social enterprise. Participants enhance their Seattle University learning experience, gain feedback on ideas, develop networks, and expose their ideas to potential investors.\n\nThe competition has become a testing ground for a wide range of Seattle University business ideas, from automated sunscreen dispensers to a nonprofit school for children with autism. It has given away over $400,000 in prize money and started numerous former contestants on their first entrepreneurial journeys.\n\nTeams led by Seattle University students and alumni advance through three rounds of judging and feedback to see who will take home the $20,000 Grand Prize.\n\nThe HSBPC is a public event and draws hundreds of investors, advisors, business leaders, community members, students, alumni, and faculty as audience members.\n\nCash Prizes\n\nThe Innovation & Entrepreneurship Center is grateful for the continued support of our generous prize sponsors who make this competition possible.\n\nGrand Prize: $20,000\n\nThe Herbert B. Jones Foundation and The Madeline Haydon Award for Entrepreneurship\n\n2nd Place Prize: $10,000\n\nJohn Meisenbach and The Madeline Haydon Award for Entrepreneurship\n\n3rd Place Prize: $3,000\n\nIn Memory of Don Leuthold and Friends of the IEC\n\n4th Place Prize: $2,000\n\nLindsey McGrew, '19 MBA\n\nJohn Castle Award for Grit & Resilience: $2,000\n\nJohn Castle Family and Ro Health\n\nSocial Innovation Award: $,1000\n\nElaine Baylor and Friends of the IEC\n\nPitch Judge Award: $500\n\nKurt Wedgwood\n\nTradeshow Judge Award: $250\n\nFriends of the IEC\n\nSemi-Finals Audience Choice Award: $250\n\nFriends of the IEC\n\nConfidentiality\n\nThe Seattle University Business Plan Competition considers all submitted business plans as confidential and treats all team matters accordingly. But due to the nature of the event, we cannot guarantee complete confidentiality for proprietary matters.\n\nSeattle University, the Innovation & Entrepreneurship Center, the Albers School of Business and Economics, and the organizers of the competition are not responsible for any proprietary information and/or intellectual property included in a submitted business plan.\n\nUltimately, protection of sensitive materials such as intellectual property, copyright, or patent confidentiality is the sole responsibility of the individual or team participating in the competition. Non-Disclosure Agreements will not be signed by judges, mentors, or any SU staff associated with the business plan competition."
