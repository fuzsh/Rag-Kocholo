        "text": "As senior program officer at GTCF, I support community projects and partnerships to cultivate meaningful and sustainable collaborations in Pierce County. I specifically work supporting community and civic engagement.\n\nI joined the GTCF team in August 2018. Prior to that I worked for a college access non-profit in Tacoma and have held various positions in higher education and social work through the years. Born and raised in Portland, Oregon I moved to Tacoma to attend the University of Puget Sound. I studied Sociology and Spanish, while playing on the women’s DIII soccer team. After I graduated, I joined the Peace Corps working in community health service in rural Guatemala. I obtained my Masters in Educational Leadership in 2015.\n\nI have always been drawn to helping others find their own voice, and I’m excited about the opportunity to collaborate with the people and organizations that make up Pierce County. When I am not at work, I love adventuring in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nI am often out in the community visiting organizations or at events and would love to hear how people are making an impact in our community. Please do not hesitate to reach out, I look forward to meeting you."
