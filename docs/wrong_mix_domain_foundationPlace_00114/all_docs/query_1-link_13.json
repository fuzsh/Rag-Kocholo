        "text": "The Five Behaviors® profile system is based on The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni.\n\nThe five behaviors Lencioni identified will result—if each is maximized—in a team that operates as efficiently and effectively as possible. The characteristics of a cohesive team are Trust, Conflict, Commitment, Accountability, and Results. Each behavior in the model builds upon the previous and supports the others. The team profile and facilitated program lets team members know how they and the team are doing, and how they can become more cohesive.\n\nThe five behaviors that make a team cohesive are rarely mastered. As things change (members, leaders, goals, etc.) the team will move through the different behaviors. Often, change will require the team to start over having to rebuild trust, thus working through each behavior again.\n\nMany teams have read about Lencioni's model. The Five Behaviors assessments help teams apply that model to their specific team or teams. A cohesive team not only accomplishes more for the organization, but is more fun to be a part of. The work to build the most cohesive team possible is well worth the effort.\n\nDownload The Five Behaviors® brochure."
