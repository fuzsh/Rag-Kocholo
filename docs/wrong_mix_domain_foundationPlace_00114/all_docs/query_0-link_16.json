        "text": "Ethan Stowell Restaurants started with the launch of Union in downtown Seattle in 2003, which quickly garnered praise for its simple and elegant menu. Additional properties followed, including the pasta-focused Tavol√†ta, delicately-plated How to Cook a Wolf, and neighborhood pizza joint Ballard Pizza Company. Over time, ESR properties became known for their dedication to unfussy sophistication and comfortable dining, with a steady supply of accolades from regional and national organizations. Today, ESR covers 12 unique concepts and over 20 locations, along with corporate partnerships with Seattle Mariners Baseball and other brands, while continuing to give back to the neighborhoods that host us.\n\n\"We believe that the world is a better place when we gather around a table.\"\n\nAt our heart, we are here to serve our communities with food for the body and human connection for the soul. Ethan Stowell Restaurants will always strive to set a place at the table for everyone. In service to our guests and our team - we aim to create shared environments and experiences that turn neighbors into friends and neighborhoods into communities.\n\n\"At ESR, we are led by our values as we grow our operations, strengthen our teams, and elevate our team members. We strive to advance the culture and foundation of the restaurant industry through thoughtful and strategic leadership, a growth mindset, sustained performance, open doors, and opportunities for all. What we create today serves our teams and community of tomorrow.\"\n\nOurs is the everyday work of providing hospitality, embracing fun, and continuously improving the lives of those around us. We create future growth through commitment to our individuals and we create community through service to the neighborhoods which we call home."
