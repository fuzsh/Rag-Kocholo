        "text": "Leaders at every level make a significant impact on every metric in your business: employee productivity and engagement, customer satisfaction and loyalty, innovation, and financial performance. Leaders are the “Difference-Makers” in your business.\n\nFrom new and emerging leaders to those in the executive suites, the role of a leader has always been tough – and today’s realities make it even tougher. People skills typically account for 80 percent of success in this role. Yet many people are promoted into leadership because of their technical capabilities, without mastering the skills of managing and motivating others. Without these basic skills, leaders at every level can struggle with leading teams in today’s workplace.\n\nThe 6 Critical Practices for Leading a Team™ is a special collection of relevant, practical resources that provide leaders with the mindsets, skillsets and toolsets needed to excel in their critical roles of leading others effectively.\n\nOverview\n\nThis solution equips leaders at every level with the essential skills and tools to get work done with and through other people. The program is ideal for leaders who are transitioning from their previous role as an individual contributor, as well as seasoned leaders looking for practical, relevant guidance for effectively leading and managing their teams.\n\nThe Research and the Solution\n\nFranklinCovey has significantly invested in research to better understand what organizations and businesses need from their leaders today and in the future. We discovered three common challenges:\n\nNew leaders need to learn the basics of managing and leading others.\n\nEmerging leaders need to upscale their knowledge and people skills.\n\nEvery leader can benefit from gaining mastery of the foundational skills of leadership.\n\nThe 6 Critical Practices fast-tracks the impact of every leader, equipping them with the skills and tools that every leader needs (but few receive). Level set skills across your organization so that all leaders use a consistent approach to managing and motivating others.\n\nProduct Includes\n\nParticipant materials include:\n\nParticipant guide\n\nPractice cards\n\nAn opt-in, email-driven, digital-learning track over a 12-week period\n\nFacilitator materials include:\n\nVirtual certification\n\nFacilitator guide\n\nPowerPoint® with embedded videos"
