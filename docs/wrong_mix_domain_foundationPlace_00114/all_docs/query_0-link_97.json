        "text": "What does transformative care look and feel like? For children and families, it means starting and ending their journey with ease so they can focus on the care, not the process; providing time and space to take a breath and decompress when they walk through the front door; and having access to the right amenities, in the right locations, without being overwhelmed with information. For care teams and staff, it means optimizing the work environment so they can focus on what’s important—patient care—while having dedicated amenities and respite spaces nearby.\n\nAs the new front door to Seattle Children’s, that’s exactly what Building Care is designed for. The eight-story diagnostic and treatment facility is the second phase of a 1 million square-foot campus expansion. It connects physically and programmatically to phase one, The Friends of Costco Building, an inpatient bed tower. A future third phase will bookend Building Care with another bed tower.\n\nThe project earned a 2023 AIA/AAH Healthcare Design Award and 2023 AIA Seattle Honor Award for its memorable and cutting-edge design, which will serve Seattle Children's patients far into the future.\n\nNew histology and pathology labs are located near the ORs to support Seattle Children’s most complicated surgical cases. The design facilitates conversation between the surgeon and pathologist in real time, allowing faster processing of specimens and reducing the time a patient is sedated in the OR.\n\nOn the tail end of a surgery or procedure, redesigning the way sterile instrumentation is managed has reduced the processing time from 24 hours to less than 10—saving staff time, improving quality, and making surgery scheduling more efficient.\n\nThe new Cancer and Blood Disorder Clinic (CBDC) establishes an on-campus partnership with Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Previously, oncology patients had to travel between campuses for different types of care. Now care comes directly to the patient from start to finish. Universal rooms allow a multidisciplinary team of providers and staff to work side by side during consult visits, blood draws, infusions, and follow-up tests, all in one space. Scheduling is more efficient, so patients can spend less time at the hospital.\n\nA Story of Giving\n\nThe interior design of Building Care brings the forest floor to the heart of the city. Inspired by its location in the Forest zone—one of four wayfinding zones within the hospital—the use of wood and other forest-friendly elements instills a sense of warmth and wonder. These details reveal themselves as families move through the building, from tiny paw prints embedded in the terrazzo floors to large-scale wall murals in waiting areas and corridors. Integrated wayfinding elements break down the scale of the building to make it easier to navigate."
