        "text": "Learning and development (L&D) is a systematic process to enhance employees’ skills, knowledge, and competency, resulting in better work performance.\n\nL&D is a core HR function and a significant part of an organization’s overall people development strategy. It plays a key role in attracting and retaining talent, enriching company culture, and engaging employees.\n\nWhat is the difference between learning and development?\n\nBoth learning and development are essential in helping employees grow and succeed, but they have distinct purposes.\n\nLearning in the workplace is concerned with the acquisition of knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitudes that lead to improved job performance. The process of learning takes place through various activities, such as seminars, conferences, hands-on experimentation, and reading articles or books.\n\nDevelopment is the broadening and deepening of knowledge in line with one’s individual long-term professional goals. It aims to grow job-related abilities to expand one’s potential for new opportunities in the future.\n\nActivities that encourage development include leadership training, mentoring, coaching, job shadowing, and stretch assignments. Development is typically something an employee chooses to do rather than being required to.\n\nWhat is the difference between learning and training?\n\nWhile the terms “learning” and “training” are often used interchangeably, in the world of L&D, they are two separate approaches.\n\nLearning is the process of absorbing and retaining information that takes place over time. It expands one’s viewpoint and knowledge base for immediate application, as well as preparation for future endeavors.\n\nTraining is an instruction event for a specific skill or task that employees need to learn for a work scenario. It can take place on-site, off-site, or online and is typically aimed at groups of employees. For example, employee training can include teaching teams about a new product, how to respond to customer inquiries more efficiently, or how to use work equipment safely.\n\nLet’s summarize the common terms associated with learning and development.\n\nThe leadership of most organizations understands the value of expanding employees’ skills and knowledge and chooses to invest in an L&D program. This investment pays off in many ways, including the following:\n\nAttracting and retaining employees: People want to work for organizations where they can lean into their present and future interests. They have come to expect employers to offer career-enhancing growth and development. According to a Gallup survey, 65% of workers evaluate job opportunities based on the availability of employer-provided upskilling.\n\nIn addition, a TalentLMS survey showed that 76% of employees are more likely to stay with a company that provides ongoing learning and development opportunities.\n\nBoosting employee experience and engagement: Employees gain confidence in their performance and feel inspired to take more initiative and pursue their career aspirations. This translates to higher morale, job satisfaction, and engagement.\n\nPromoting DEIB: An inclusive and equitable work environment where employees of all backgrounds have access to growth opportunities is at the forefront of most organization’s cultural aspirations. Actively integrating DEIB into L&D strategies promotes a sense of belonging and contributes to an engaged, innovative workforce.\n\nBridging skills gaps: Organizations must keep pace with technological advancements and frequent shifts in business concepts. This means equipping employees to face new challenges. Reskilling and upskilling individuals for specialized technical roles and developing their soft skills prepares the workforce to adapt, foster innovation, and meet the organization’s future labor needs.\n\nEmpowering future leaders: Providing learning and development opportunities results in well-trained and educated employees who can take on new responsibilities and leadership roles. Many organizations create their own management training programs that offer employees a tangible prospect for making their career aspirations a reality.\n\nFor example, the American retail membership warehouse chain Sam’s Club has a five-week learning program called Manager Quality (MQ). Its content brings customized career development to all levels of associates. It begins with a week of values-based decision-making to develop the attributes of the company’s leadership expectations. MQ’s framework has four pillars that teach foundational concepts that apply to all Sam Club roles.\n\nEnhanced reputation as an employer: With so many people looking for growth opportunities in their jobs, fulfilling their desires for expanding career opportunities is a must for improving your employer brand. Employers that offer robust L&D have an advantage over others in the competition for top talent.\n\nMultinational fast food restaurant chain McDonald’s offers L&D benefits to attract and retain workers in an industry plagued by a labor shortage. Even part-time workers are eligible for tuition assistance after 90 days of employment. McDonald’s Archways to Opportunity program has a variety of channels for employee growth and learning. This includes a career development app that provides on-demand, personalized professional guidance and learning that employees can access from anywhere.\n\nThere is no single learning method or technique that works for every individual or every organization. People have varied learning styles, and organizations have different learning objectives.\n\nThe 70/20/10 model is a well-known approach to organizational learning. It breaks down the main ways in which learning happens:\n\n70% of learning comes from informal, work-based learning. This takes place during new tasks, challenging assignments, and through supervisor feedback and ‘water-cooler’ conversations with peers\n\n20% of learning comes from developmental relationships. Employees experience social learning through interactions with peers and mentors\n\n10% of learning comes from traditional coursework and training in a formal, educational setting.\n\nWhile this ratio may work for certain businesses and functions, it is not a one-size-fits-all approach. For example, in some cases, all workplace learning occurs without formal learning.\n\nIn other cases, years of formal learning and job training are required to join a specialist profession. For these kinds of jobs, formal learning will play a much more prominent role.\n\nFortunately, there is a vast array of L&D delivery methods that organizations can select from, combine, and tailor to their specific business and employee needs.\n\nHere’s a brief look at some of the most common learning and development methods:\n\nFormal learning in a classroom setting: This method is goal-oriented and instructor-led with limited learner interaction. It is typically a group situation and can take place in person or online. Examples include lectures, classes, and seminars.\n\nInformal learning: Informal learning is organic, unstructured, and more self-directed. It takes place on the job through tasks, feedback, co-worker interactions, and through individual study. Examples include conversations, online forums, and reading books or doing research.\n\nExperiential learning: This trial-and-error approach allows people to try doing something, observe the results, and then gain understanding from the experience. Examples include apprenticeships, internships, virtual or real-world simulation exercises, and scenario-based role-playing.\n\nCoaching: Coaching is a workplace relationship that focuses on empowering employees to grow and achieve their goals. The coach and coachee meet regularly for open dialogue, with the coach providing feedback, direction, and support. There are several types of workplace coaching, such as:\n\nPerformance coaching to inspire employees to realize their full potential by honing their current abilities and learning new skills.\n\nPolice Now, an independent charitable social enterprise that recruits police officers in England and Wales, has a very hands-on approach to performance coaching. Its year-long Frontline Leadership Programme includes one-on-one coaching to guide participants through each training module and work through any knowledge or skills gaps.\n\nPeer coaching is where two or more colleagues team up to share ideas, learn from one another, build skills, or collaborate to solve work problems.\n\nAI-based coaching leverages artificial intelligence to provide coaches with insight, augment coaching efforts, or exclusively do the coaching.\n\nEstablishing a coaching culture builds trust and connection with employees and empowers them to improve themselves and their performance to impact the company’s success.\n\nMentoring: Mentoring is a collaborative relationship that connects employees with someone they can learn from to grow professionally. Mentors act as role models to the mentee. They listen, answer questions, and offer guidance. Examples of workplace mentoring include:\n\nMentorship programs that are sponsored by the organization provide structure and resources for mentoring relationships.\n\nPeer mentoring takes place between two co-workers who are at the same or similar level in the organization but have different degrees of experience. The more experienced one shares their knowledge and offers encouragement to the less experienced one.\n\nReverse mentoring is when junior employees share their knowledge and expertise with their superiors to help them overcome a shortfall in a particular area, such as digital skills.\n\nMicro-mentoring occurs in one-time or temporary settings and is focused on short-term objectives for a specific project, topic, or skill.\n\nJob shadowing lets employees observe a more experienced colleague as they perform their duties. Implementing a job shadowing program is a way to offer employees exposure to other roles and new career opportunities.\n\nSkill building: Skill building involves helping employees acquire new skills. The purpose is to fill the organization’s skills gaps so it can achieve business goals and remain competitive. Examples of skill-building activities include new product training, customer service role-playing, and problem-solving games.\n\nTargeted training: Targeted training is another method for closing skills gaps. It combines formal and informal learning to meet individual learning needs. By pinpointing the most needed skills, organizations can distribute training resources efficiently. Just about any method can be used for this type of learning.\n\nCross-training: Cross-training entails teaching an employee how to handle another employee’s role. When employees are cross-trained, they expand their skill set and understanding of the company’s operations. They can also cover for absent employees and pitch in when extra help is needed to distribute the workload.\n\nRemote training: Remote training takes place online and is for employees who are not working from the same location. It can be held either at a set time with employees participating from different places (synchronously) or accessed on demand (asynchronously). Examples include webinars, online courses, and pre-recorded video lessons.\n\nNew employee training: New employee training is the part of the onboarding process that teaches new hires how to do and be productive in their jobs. It’s customized to each role and can involve areas of instruction such as customer service techniques, how to use software, or how to operate equipment.\n\nLearning and development programs take place throughout the entire employee life cycle. Here are some examples of L&D programs in the workplace:\n\nOrientation and onboarding: The job orientation and onboarding journey helps all new employees settle into their new organization and role, often equipping them with specific knowledge, training, and equipment to do their job.\n\nTechnical skills development: Certain roles require technical skills, which can be improved through training and education. For example, software engineers might receive training on specific software applications or take a course to improve their coding abilities. As technology rapidly evolves, keeping technical skills updated requires regular training.\n\nSoft skills development: Soft skills are personality traits, behaviors, and interpersonal skills people use to interact with others at work and are essential for cooperation and harmony between peers. While they are less tangible than hard skills, they can still be developed. A LinkedIn survey reported that 92% of talent professionals believe soft skills are equally or more important than hard skills when it comes to hiring the right person for a role.\n\nProduct and services training: Customer and client-facing roles require strong knowledge of the product or service offering. As products and services are updated and new lines are rolled out over time, regular training helps ensure that everyone has a good grasp of the unique selling proposition (USP) and benefits and can communicate these to the customer.\n\nSafety training: Health and safety training is not only essential for keeping your employees safe and healthy at work, but sometimes it’s also required by law (these laws differ depending on the location in question). Some roles – such as an administrative office position – require basic safety training, while others – such as a builder using complex and dangerous machinery on-site – require more specific learning programs.\n\nLearning and development requirements vary by organization, but a comprehensive strategy is the foundation for any successful L&D program. The steps listed below will guide you through creating a solid learning and development strategy for your organization:\n\n1. Align your L&D strategy with the business strategy\n\nTo understand the organization’s L&D needs, you need to know where the business is headed. Before you build your L&D strategy, consider the following factors:\n\nThe skills your employees have and which skills are crucial to supporting business priorities\n\nWhat your business has to offer and its competitive advantage\n\nWhat your customers need and how those needs may evolve\n\nShifts that may affect the organization, such as technological developments, economic uncertainty, competition, and business growth or decline\n\nWhether the organization is agile and prepared to adapt to known and unforeseen changes.\n\n2. Collaborate with business leaders\n\nInvolve stakeholders directly in shaping the L&D strategy to ensure it meets the unique needs of different departments. Start by conducting surveys to gather a broad overview of the learning requirements across the organization.\n\nThen, deepen your understanding through one-on-one meetings, where you can gather detailed feedback and build support for the L&D initiatives. Create collaborative input opportunities where department heads and senior management can actively contribute to and endorse the L&D plans and model them throughout the company.\n\n3. Assess employee capabilities and identify skills gaps\n\nStart by determining the essential competencies required for each role to support the company’s business goals.\n\nOnce you know what you need, you can conduct a skills audit to ascertain the competencies and knowledge already in play throughout the organization. Follow that with a skills gap analysis to discover potential skills shortages and employee growth opportunities.\n\nWith this information, you’ll be able to see what the L&D priorities need to be.\n\n4. Design learning journeys\n\nDesigning learning journeys is a key strategy in enabling continuous learning within an organization. These journeys help individuals acquire the necessary skills and knowledge for their specific job functions.\n\nFor each role, determine the capabilities required to perform the duties and which learning methods would be feasible and effective for training and development.\n\nFocus groups can help you design the journeys and choose the learning methods. Questions to ask participants include:\n\nWhat tools must you be capable of using for your job?\n\nWhat helps you be the most productive?\n\nWhich learning experiences work best for you?\n\nHow could your learning experience be improved?\n\n5. Plan the implementation of L&D initiatives\n\nImplementing L&D initiatives happens in several stages. Here are some procedures to use as a guide:\n\nArticulate the purpose of the initiative\n\nPerform a SWOT analysis to determine which learning program is best\n\nEstablish a well-defined budget that includes all costs associated with running the program\n\nProvide detailed information on the program’s benefits and ROI. Describe how they align with business goals and objectives\n\nConduct a trial run with pilot classes to discover any weaknesses and make adjustments.\n\n6. Track performance\n\nTracking certain data can help justify L&D projects by showing that they engage employees. You can use these three metrics to analyze how effective your L&D programs are:\n\nTraining completion rate: How many employees enrolled in and then completed the training.\n\nAssessment pass rate: The number of employees who passed the training.\n\nTraining dropout rate: The percentage of employees who did not complete the training.\n\n7. Analyze effectiveness and make adjustments\n\nYou can go beyond the L&D metrics to assess the training programs’ impact by evaluating them on a larger scale. Collecting learners’ feedback post-training is essential. Be sure to survey them on their overall satisfaction and what they liked and didn’t like.\n\nThe following outcomes can help you analyze the effectiveness and identify where changes need to be made:\n\nDid the learning strategies reinforce the organization’s priorities and goals?\n\nWere skills gaps addressed to improve employee performance?\n\nHas employee engagement, morale, and retention improved?\n\nAre business processes more efficient?\n\nIs the company culture healthier?\n\nWere L&D budgets and resources distributed effectively?\n\nCertain employee training metrics can help you evaluate training effectiveness, which is the degree to which training programs meet their intended objectives, enhancing the knowledge, skills, and performance of participants.\n\nSome example metrics include, for instance, training ROI, training cost per employee, training experience net promoter score, and assessment scores and pass rates.\n\nEvaluating a training program’s impact on business performance requires more strategic metrics. L&D key performance indicators (KPIs) can quantify that the company is experiencing greater productivity and achieving crucial business objectives.\n\nLearning and development KPIs to consider for this purpose are:\n\nEmployee productivity rate: The value that employees generate within a specific period – (Total output ÷ Total input)\n\nRevenue growth: The increase in revenue over a set timeframe – (Current period revenue – Previous period revenue) ÷ Previous revenue\n\nNet profit margin: The percentage of revenue that is profit – ((Operating income – Expenses – Interest – Taxes) / Revenue) x 100\n\nBy linking KPI improvements to the timing of certain employee learning and development programs, you can substantiate the investment the organization made. This makes it easier to gain stakeholder buy-in for continuing your L&D programs and launching new ones.\n\nHow to measure ROI in learning and development\n\nL&D professionals must know how to explain the value that their initiatives bring to the organization. By measuring training ROI, you can tangibly demonstrate how the company benefits from offering training.\n\nThis metric is not about how satisfied employees are with a particular training. Instead, it shows what impact training efforts have on the organization overall. Keep in mind that you won’t be able to make a correlation between every training experience and ROI. Often, only the ones with the most direct impact (about 5% of all programs) should be considered for calculating training ROI.\n\nHere is an overview of three commonly used methods for measuring training ROI:\n\n1. Kirkpatrick model of training evaluation\n\nThis model is based on four levels of training evaluation:\n\nLevel 1: Reaction – Understand the learners’ reactions, responses, and level of satisfaction through surveys that provide the following data:\n\nParticipation rates\n\nCompletion rates\n\nNet promoter score\n\nLevel 2: Learning – Ascertain the improvements made to employees’ knowledge and skills through:\n\nPre- and post-training assessments\n\nPerformance review data\n\nPeer reviews\n\nLevel 3: Behavior – Assess any behavioral changes in the workforce by measuring employees’:\n\nMorale\n\nMotivation\n\nEngagement\n\nLevel 4: Impact – Measure how the training impacts business through increased KPIs such as:\n\nSales\n\nProductivity\n\nCustomer satisfaction\n\nEmployee retention\n\nWork quality\n\n2. Phillips model of training evaluation\n\nThis method expands Kirkpatrick’s model into five levels of training evaluation:\n\nLevel 1: Reaction – Understand learners’ experience via learner reviews and surveys, AI technology, etc.\n\nLevel 2: Learning – Measure how well the learning objectives have been met by determining whether learners have acquired the targeted skills and knowledge. Attendance and learner attentiveness are also factored in.\n\nLevel 3: Application – Gather qualitative data that provides insight from learners about how they’ve applied the acquired skills.\n\nLevel 4: Impact – Determine the positive impact of the training on the organization while considering any barriers that might have hindered it.\n\nLevel 5: Return on investment – Make the link between the training and improved business results using calculations such as a cost-benefit analysis.\n\n3. Impact study\n\nThis method is a four-step process for conducting an impact study to understand business changes occurring from a training program’s influence. For example, increased sales or market share or improved customer feedback results:\n\nEvaluation planning – Determine the indicators to measure impact, such as certain types of sales data. Also, determine which training data to collect, such as cost and participation rates.\n\nData collection – Collect data from a variety of sources with specified parameters that include both pre- and post-training statistics.\n\nData analysis – Translate the data into a monetary value through the ROI formula: Net return on investment ÷ Cost of investment ​×100%​ = ROI\n\nReporting – Finalize the impact study by creating a report that explains the key findings with qualitative and quantitative data.\n\nCorporate learning and development terminology will evolve. If you’re working in L&D, it’s essential to stay up on the language associated with it. We’ve compiled a list of relevant terms and brief explanations as follows:\n\nADDIE model: The ADDIE model is a framework for designing effective learning adaptable to many training environments. The five stages of this instructional design model are carried out in the following order:\n\nAnalyze: Identify the problem to be solved\n\nDesign: Create an outline and prototype/storyboard for the learning intervention\n\nDevelop: Use the prototype/storyboard to create the training\n\nImplement: Deliver the training\n\nEvaluate: Assess the initial training program using observations and data from post-training assessments.\n\nEmployee development plan: An employee development plan is a strategy for developing an individual’s knowledge and skills to equip them for current and future roles. The plan incorporates the needs of both the employee and the organization.\n\nLeadership development plan: A leadership development plan is a personalized, long-term strategy for helping an individual acquire the leadership competencies they must have to become a manager or leader in the organization.\n\nLearning agility: Learning agility is a mindset of being open to learning and accepting new concepts and strategies for better adaptation to change. It has been described as “the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn.”\n\nOrganizational learning: Organizational learning is the process of promoting and facilitating learning within an organization to help it thrive through improving productivity, profitability, and competitive advantage. It’s focused on knowledge creation, knowledge retention, and knowledge transfer.\n\nProfessional development plan: A professional development plan is an action plan for an individual to progress in their career. It involves setting the goals they want to achieve and identifying which skills and experience they have, which they should gain, and the steps to get them where they want to be. This differs from an employee development plan because it is focused primarily on the individual’s goals and not necessarily the organization’s.\n\nReskilling: Reskilling is the process of acquiringk new skills or training in a different field or discipline to adapt to changing job requirements or to transition into a new role. It’s a proactive approach to workforce planning and meeting future skills needs.\n\nSkills gap analysis: A skills gap analysis is a tool for assessing the disparity between a workforce’s existing capabilities and what the organization currently needs and will require in the future. The results of the analysis are used to design appropriate learning interventions.\n\nTalent development: Talent development is about amplifying employees’ existing skills and identifying new competencies and opportunities for them. The goal is to help employees grow so they can better serve the organization’s effort to achieve business goals.\n\nTraining evaluation: Training evaluation is the process of analyzing the effects and effectiveness of a training program. It entails assessing whether the program meets its objectives, as well as collecting feedback to gain insight for making improvements.\n\nTraining needs analysis: A training needs analysis identifies the variance between the desired knowledge, skills, and abilities and what the workforce actually possesses. It pinpoints what kind of training is needed and which employees need it. This tool is used when a lack of skills appears to be the cause of a business problem.\n\nUpskilling: Upskilling is an intentional process of enhancing and expanding employees’ skills to improve performance in their current role, enable them to progress within the organization, and adapt to evolving workplace demands. It supports the organization’s ability to adapt to upcoming changes.\n\nThe one safe prediction for the current business climate is that change will be ongoing. Many organizations are putting more emphasis on learning and development to keep their employees equipped to adapt and thrive in this environment.\n\nLinkedIn Learning’s Workplace Learning Report found that 72% of L&D leaders say that their function has become a more strategic role in their organization.\n\nSome companies outsource L&D responsibilities, but many larger organizations have in-house L&D teams.\n\nWhen it comes to jobs in L&D, a variety of positions exist, and their duties and responsibilities differ across industries and organizations. Let’s take a general look at what three of the most common L&D roles entail.\n\nLearning and development specialist\n\nLearning and development specialists plan and administer employee learning programs. They may be responsible for the full scope of training an organization offers or specialize in teaching certain skills.\n\nL&D specialist duties may include:\n\nCoordinating with different departments to identify training needs\n\nAssembling data and producing reports on training status and needs\n\nDesigning training content and participant materials\n\nConducting training sessions and workshops while creating a learning-conducive environment.\n\nThe key qualifications for L&D specialists include excellent written and verbal communication skills, sound organizational skills, project management experience, and proficiency in elearning and learning management systems.\n\nLearning and development specialists’ salaries differ depending on their level of experience and education, as well as the size of the company. Glassdoor shows a total pay range of $59,000-$89,000 US. Payscale lists the average US salary for a learning and development specialist at approximately $66,800.\n\nThose seeking an L&D specialist position might be asked the following questions in an interview:\n\nHow do you make sure training and participant materials are relevant and beneficial?\n\nTell me about a time when you had to create a training program for a subject you were unfamiliar with.\n\nExplain your process for measuring the success and impact of a training program.\n\nLearning and development manager\n\nA learning and development manager oversees an organization’s employee training and professional development program. The goal is to encourage and grow people’s abilities, so they develop into top talent who can fulfill the organization’s business needs.\n\nExamples of L&D manager duties are:\n\nCreating learning strategies and programs in line with organizational objectives\n\nAssessing learning and development plans and making improvements\n\nManaging the L&D budget and negotiating contracts with external training providers\n\nHiring and managing L&D staff.\n\nThe skills and experience L&D managers generally need include previous experience in HR, or a degree in education, HR, business, psychology, or related field, strong written and verbal communication skills, and proficiency in learning theories and training techniques and platforms.\n\nAccording to Glassdoor, the base pay range for learning and development managers in the US is $75,000-$116,000. Salary.com lists it at between $88,408 and $112,255.\n\nHere are a few interview questions learning and development manager candidates should be prepared for:\n\nTell me about a successful training strategy you implemented and why it was effective.\n\nHow do you stay on top of the latest research and trends in L&D?\n\nWhat is your background and experience in creating training materials?\n\nExplain your management style and how you motivate staff.\n\nTraining specialist\n\nTraining specialists identify an organization’s training and development needs and then design, modify, and evaluate L&D initiatives. They may supervise training staff or facilitate the training themselves.\n\nTraining specialist responsibilities involve:\n\nIdentifying training needs by conducting skills gap analyses and collaborating with stakeholders\n\nBuilding training programs and determining the standards and benchmarks for evaluating them\n\nPreparing teaching plans and instructional materials\n\nEnsuring training efforts align with organizational goals.\n\nTraining specialists are often required to have previous experience in HR, a Bachelor’s degree in a related field, and knowledge of learning theories, training techniques, talent management, instructional design, digital tools, and project management. Excellent communication and presentation skills are also necessary.\n\nAccording to PayScale, the average base pay for a training specialist in the US is $59,980. Salary.com puts the typical US range at $52,563-$65,658.\n\nA candidate for a training specialist role might encounter the following interview questions:\n\nExplain how your background and related experience equip you to succeed as a training specialist\n\nDescribe how you would plan an effective soft skill training on critical thinking\n\nWhat type of employee L&D do you think should be outsourced?\n\nWorking in L&D requires a strategic mindset, the business acumen to connect learning directly to organizational objectives, and some specialized knowledge. L&D professionals need diverse abilities to ensure that L&D efforts flourish and benefit the organization.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at some of the key skills L&D professionals should have:\n\nInstructional design: A defined process driven by learning theories and models for constructing efficient, effective learning experiences. It helps L&D professionals systematically identify the learning objectives and strategies and create presentations, instructional materials, assessments, and interactions that enhance learner engagement.\n\nThree widely used instructional design models are the ADDIE model, Bloom’s Taxonomy model, and Merrill’s Principles of Instruction.\n\nFacilitation skills: The definition of the word facilitate is “to make (something) easier.” Facilitation skills in L&D pertain to successfully guiding learners through a training program and achieving the intended outcomes. A good facilitator will incorporate tools, activities, and discussions that present the material in a comprehensible and engaging manner.\n\nAdult learning: Adult learning theory acknowledges that adults do not learn in the same way that children do. Adults prefer to be informed of why they need to learn a new concept to start with. They also absorb information better with less instruction and more hands-on experience. L&D professionals understand adult learning techniques and use the appropriate methods for strengthening training outcomes.\n\nLMS experience: Learning management systems (LMS) are digital platforms that automate the administration, delivery, tracking, and reporting of corporate learning and development. Due to their efficiency, most organizations use some type of LMS. L&D professionals must be comfortable operating LMS software and understand how to make the best use of it.\n\nProject management: Project management is about overseeing the process of delivering something of value. Administering L&D is the same idea. L&D professionals must be able to collaborate and communicate with multiple stakeholders, organize documentation and materials through various drafts, and problem-solve complex challenges to keep projects on track.\n\nOrganizations must continually adapt their learning and development programs with forward-thinking initiatives to suit the evolving world of work. A recent LinkedIn Workplace Learning Report discovered that over the last six years, required skill sets have been revised by 25%. This trend is expected to expand, with the percentage doubling by 2027.\n\nBy embracing the current trends in their L&D strategies, organizations can maintain a competent staff and stay competitive. Some of the new aspects L&D is leaning toward are explained below.\n\n1. Microlearning\n\nMicrolearning is a set of ‘bite-sized’ amounts of information for learners. Each is under 20 minutes and focuses on a single topic. It’s often delivered through apps, videos, infographics, or games and contains an interactive section, such as a quiz.\n\nPeople have become accustomed to absorbing knowledge through the immediate access they have to information on their mobile devices. Microlearning appeals to this form of learning by condensing targeted information that makes its point quickly.\n\n2. AI and personalization of the learning experience\n\nThe L&D profession is well aware that the one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t apply to training. Personalized learning takes into consideration learners’ interests, needs, and abilities and provides experiences that increase engagement and knowledge retention.\n\nDigital training methods such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), simulation, and gamification can optimize learning for certain jobs and employees. A PwC study revealed that a VR learning environment made learners feel 3.75 times more emotionally connected to the training content than if they were in a classroom setting.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is another tool for personalizing employee learning that can be used in the following ways:\n\nAlgorithms that generate personalized learning paths by analyzing employees’ learning history, performance, and preferences.\n\nLearning systems that offer support or more challenging material according to each learner’s needs.\n\nData analysis that predicts which learners may struggle and can recommend interventions.\n\nBy fostering success for employees on an individual basis, L&D programs can better achieve learning objectives that benefit the organization overall.\n\n3. Soft skills training\n\nSoft skills are behaviors and personality traits that can be applied to any role and help people relate to and work well with others. They differ from hard skills, which are more technical and tend to be job-related.\n\nMany attributes are considered soft skills, but the more commonly sought-after ones are self-direction, communication, problem-solving, flexibility, creativity, and integrity.\n\nIn the book The Hard Truth About Soft Skills—Workplace Lessons Smart People Wish They’d Learned Sooner, the author writes, “Whether young or old, experienced or inexperienced, what struck me most about their stories of missed opportunities and derailed careers was this: Their problems rarely stemmed from a shortfall in technical or professional expertise, but rather from a shortcoming in the soft skills arena with their personal, social, communication, self-management behaviors.”\n\nBusinesses recognize the value of soft skills in the workplace, and the demand for them will continue to rise. L&D strategies should incorporate soft skills learning, such as communication and resilience training.\n\n4. Building a culture of continuous learning\n\nWorkers today crave learning opportunities for growing in their professional and personal lives and look for a work environment that fosters this. A Ceridian Pulse of Talent report that surveyed 2,000 full-time workers in North America showed that 86% of respondents say employer-provided learning opportunities are important to job satisfaction.\n\nL&D should take advantage of this employee expectation and be central in building a culture of continuous learning. Coordinated efforts that bring fresh and innovative educational opportunities that empower employees to learn and grow will earn their appreciation and support. When employees see the value in and look forward to training, it feeds a learning culture within the organization.\n\nA significant influence on company culture happens when a concept is adopted at the top of the organization. One learning and development strategy example for this is how ride-hailing, food delivery, and freight transport services company Uber found a way to have executives model a learning philosophy.\n\nLeaders were put in five-person “coaching pods” to discuss the new strategies and behaviors they had been taught and were applying in their day-to-day activities. With a 94% satisfaction rate from the 2,000 participants across 16 countries, Uber’s leaders grasped the value of learning from each other during this program.\n\nAs they became better managers and coaches, they were also fostering a learning culture throughout the organization.\n\n5. Generative AI and digital skills development\n\nThe rapidly expanding availability of digital tools and generative AI, such as ChatGPT, has many implications in the workplace. These emerging technologies have the potential to augment productivity and completely change how work is done in the future.\n\nFor instance, GitHub offers an AI tool for software development called Co-pilot. Its research asserts that Co-pilot can help developers code 55% faster to dramatically speed up the software development process.\n\nEmployees will need a foundational understanding of how to operate new tools properly and take advantage of everything they have to offer. Therefore, L&D programs must stay on top of digital skills development and incorporate training on how to use AI ethically and effectively. Generative AI can even make it easier to design the training because of its ability to gather and summarize information at record speed.\n\nIf you want to advance your career in learning and development, obtaining an L&D certification is an advantageous step to take. As well as increasing your L&D knowledge, earning this credential demonstrates your dedication to professional growth and commitment to a career in the industry.\n\nAIHR’s accredited Learning and Development Certificate Program will teach you how to identify skills gaps, create an L&D strategy, use data analysis to assess L&D programs, and many other critical skills.\n\nYou’ll receive 23.5 hours of self-paced learning distributed over 11 modules and five different hands-on projects, including competency assessments. Enrolling in this course also gives you access to AIHR’s extensive resource library and live events, as well as a worldwide community of industry peers with whom you can interact and network."
