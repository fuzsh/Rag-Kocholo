Ethan Stowell Restaurants started with the launch of Union in downtown Seattle in 2003, which quickly garnered praise for its simple and elegant menu. Additional properties followed, including the pasta-focused Tavol√†ta, delicately-plated How to Cook a Wolf, and neighborhood pizza joint Ballard Pizza Company. Over time, ESR properties became known for their dedication to unfussy sophistication and comfortable dining, with a steady supply of accolades from regional and national organizations. Today, ESR covers 12 unique concepts and over 20 locations, along with corporate partnerships with Seattle Mariners Baseball and other brands, while continuing to give back to the neighborhoods that host us.

"We believe that the world is a better place when we gather around a table."
