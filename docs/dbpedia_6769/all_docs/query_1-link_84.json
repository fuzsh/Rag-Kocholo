        "text": "CARSON – Ever wonder what happened to the cute little boy who played Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf’s son in that 2004 Genworth Financial commercial co-starring Taylor Dent?\n\nWell, Connor Hance, who turned 13 in November and lives just 8 miles away in Torrance, has put the acting and commercials on hiatus and has been making some noise on the junior tennis circuit of late, especially on Wednesday when he upset top-seeded Ruadhan De Bruges of Australia, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, in the third round of the boys 16s at the eighth annual USTA International Spring Championships at Home Depot Center.\n\n“I started to play more aggressive and drive the ball more,” said Hance, of what he changed after dropping the first set. “And I started getting my first serve in. That was the difference.”\n\nBoth Hance’s parents are teaching professionals at the South Bay Tennis Center in Torrance. His father Ken and mother Courtney were both on hand to watch him record the shocking win.\n\n“I just kept saying to myself please keep the ball in play because I knew his opponent was tiring,” Courtney said. “And he did and it worked out for him. It’s pretty exciting.”\n\nHance, who won the 2011 USTA Clay Court Nationals in the 12s, will next face No. 10 seed Logan Smith of Carlsbad in today’s quarterfinals. Connor’s sister Kenadi (Peninsula High) is a top-ranked 14s player who lost in the 16s on Tuesday.\n\nDuring his match, she said he gave up acting and really started focusing on his tennis several years ago when he lost out on the role of actor Steve Carell’s son in the 2007 feature film “Evan Almighty,” only because he didn’t look anything like Carell.\n\nAnother 13-year-old who was turning heads but in the girls 18s on Wednesday was Tornado Ali Black, who was given a wild card into the tournament and is currently ranked No. 141 in the ITF world rankings.\n\nBlack, who has a younger sister named Hurricane who is a top-ranked 12s player, is from Englewood, Colo., and won the Eddie Herr 16s back in December. She has already signed a pro contract with Octagon and is being coached by USTA coach Freddie Rodriguez who was on site to watch her upset No. 13 seeded Kelsey Laurente of Miramar, Fla., 6-3, 6-1 in the second round.\n\nDefending 18s champion Samantha Crawford, the No. 5 seed, was beaten in straight sets by Makenzie Craft of Frisco, Texas 7-6 (4), 6-3."
