        "text": "City in Los Angeles County, California, United States\n\nCity in California, United States\n\nTorrance is a coastal city in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, located in southwest Los Angeles County, California, United States. The city is part of what is known as the South Bay region of the metropolitan area. A small section of the city, 1.5 miles (2.4 km), abuts the Pacific Ocean. Torrance has a moderate year-round climate with average rainfall of 12 inches (300 mm) per year.[8] Torrance was incorporated in 1921, and at the 2020 census had a population of 147,067 residents.[6] Torrance has a beachfront and has 30 parks located around the city.[8] It is also the birthplace of the American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO).\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nPre-colonial era\n\n[edit]\n\nFor thousands of years, the area of Torrance was occupied by the Tongva Native Americans. The land that is now part of the City of Torrance and much of the modern South Bay was part of the extensive marshlands.\n\nSpanish and Mexican eras\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1784, the Spanish Crown deeded Rancho San Pedro (including present-day Torrance), a tract of over 75,000 acres (300 km2) in the province of Las Californias of New Spain, to soldier Juan José Domínguez.[9][10] It was later divided in 1846, with Governor Pío Pico granting Rancho de los Palos Verdes to José Loreto and Juan Capistrano Sepulveda in the Alta California territory of independent Mexico.[11][12]\n\nModern Era\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early 1900s, real estate developer Jared Sidney Torrance and other investors saw the value of creating a mixed industrial–residential community south of Los Angeles. They purchased part of an old Spanish land grant and hired landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. to design a planned community.[13] The resulting town was founded in October 1912 and named after Torrance. The city of Torrance was formally incorporated in May 1921, the townsite initially being bounded by Western Avenue on the east, Del Amo Boulevard on the north, Crenshaw Boulevard on the west, and on the south by Plaza del Amo east of where it meets Carson Street, and by Carson Street west of where it meets Plaza del Amo.[14]\n\nThe first residential avenue created in Torrance was Gramercy and the second avenue was Andreo. Many of the houses on these avenues reached the centennial mark in 2012. Both avenues are located in the area referred to as Old Torrance. This section of Torrance is under review to be classified as a historical district.[15] Some of the early civic and residential buildings were designed by the renowned and innovative Southern California architect Irving Gill, in his distinctive combining of Mission Revival and early Modernist architecture.[16]\n\nHistoric Olmstead District\n\n[edit]\n\nTorrance was planned as a new prototype of a balanced industrial city based on the principles of the Garden City Movement. The original tract developed by the Olmstead Brothers consists of 109 city blocks divided into three sub-districts: residential, commercial, and industrial. The plan is most notable for its axial landscaped downtown commercial neighborhood aligned to have a view of Mount San Antonio in the San Gabriel Mountains. The Olmsted Tract includes a number of buildings designed by the noted Southern California Architect Irving Gill, including the original train depot.[17]\n\nThe footprint of the downtown neighborhood, now called Old Torrance, was designed on a diagonal to allow the trade breezes coming from the Pacific Ocean to keep the air clean from industrial pollution for the residential and commercial neighborhoods. The industrial sections of the city were placed on the eastern side of the original tract.\n\nPublic transportation played a key role in the founding of Torrance. The Pacific Electric Red Car connected downtown Los Angeles to the new development of downtown Torrance. Designed in 1912 by Irving Gill, the terminus depot of the Red Car line was designed in a Spanish revival style popularized during this era.[18] In May 1913, the Pacific Electric Railroad Bridge was built. Often called the \"El Prado Bridge\", it further expanded the industrial heart of the South Bay. The concrete double-tracked arch bridge was the Pacific Electric Railway's first interurban line that connected north–south to San Pedro via the Gardena Line.[19] The bridge was used for transporting freight and commuting workers to Torrance factories. The Red Car line connected under the bridge as it connected to the train depot located on Cabrillo Avenue. The bridge no longer carries any rail cars, with Pacific Electric closing the Red Car line to Torrance in the 1940s. The bridge became the city of Torrance's second entry in the National Register of Historic Places on July 13, 1989, and is used as a logo for the city's new wayfinding signage and city materials.[20]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nTorrance is a coastal community in southwestern Los Angeles County sharing the climate and geographical features common to the Greater Los Angeles area. Its boundaries are: Redondo Beach Boulevard and the cities of Lawndale and Gardena to the north; Western Avenue and the Harbor Gateway neighborhood of Los Angeles to the east; the Palos Verdes Hills with the cities of Lomita, Rolling Hills Estates and Palos Verdes Estates on the south; and the Pacific Ocean and the city of Redondo Beach to the west.\n\nThe western portion of Torrance is in ZIP Code 90277 which is a city of Redondo Beach postal address.[21] It is about 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Downtown Los Angeles.[22]\n\nTorrance Beach lies between Redondo Beach and Malaga Cove on Santa Monica Bay.[23] The southernmost stretch of Torrance Beach, on a cove at the northern end of the Palos Verdes peninsula, is known to locals as Rat Beach (Right After Torrance).\n\nAn urban wetland, the Madrona Marsh is a nature preserve on land once set for oil production and saved from development, with restoration projects enhancing the vital habitat for birds, wildlife, and native plants.[24][25]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nTorrance has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csb), bordering with a semi-arid climate (Bsk). The rainy season is November through March, as shown in the adjacent table.[26] Summers tend to be warm and humid due to Torrance's proximity to the coast.[27]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 19307,271—19409,95036.8%195022,241123.5%1960100,991354.1%1970134,96833.6%1980129,881−3.8%1990133,1072.5%2000137,9463.6%2010145,4385.4%2020147,0671.1%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nTorrance city, California – Racial and ethnic composition\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

The population density was 6,715.7 inhabitants per square mile (2,592.9/km2). There were 55,967 housing units at an average density of 2,724.7 units per square mile (1,052.0 units/km2).

About 4.7% of families and 5.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.7% of those under age 18 and 7.4% of those age 65 or over.\n\nJapanese Americans\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2014, Torrance had the second-largest concentration of people of Japanese ancestry of any U.S. city, after Honolulu. The city has offices of numerous Japanese companies, including those in the automotive industry.[22] Because of this, many Japanese restaurants and other cultural offerings are in the city, and Willy Blackmore of L.A. Weekly wrote that Torrance was \"essentially Japan's 48th prefecture\".[39] A Mitsuwa supermarket, Japanese schools, and Japanese banks serve the community.[22]\n\nIn the pre-World War II period, the South Bay region was one of the few areas that allowed non-U.S. citizens to acquire property, so a Japanese presence came. According to John Kaji, a Torrance resident quoted in Public Radio International who was the son of Toyota's first American-based accountant, the Japanese corporate presence in Torrance, beginning with Toyota, attracted many ethnic Japanese. Toyota moved its operations to its Torrance campus in 1982 because of its proximity to the Port of Long Beach and Los Angeles International Airport, and many other Japanese companies followed suit. In 2014, Toyota announced it was moving its U.S. headquarters to Plano, Texas.[22]\n\nKorean Americans\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 1992 , about 60% of the Korean population in the South Bay region lived in Torrance and Gardena.[40] In 1990, 5,888 ethnic Koreans lived in Torrance, a 256% increase from the 1980 figure of 1,652.[40]\n\nHomelessness\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2022, Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority's Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count counted 306 homeless individuals in Torrance.[41]\n\nHomeless populationYearPop.±%2016 107— 2017 145+35.5%2018 187+29.0%2019 226+20.9%2020 332+46.9%2022 306−7.8%Source: Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count\n\nLos Angeles Homeless Services Authority\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nTorrance is home to the U.S. headquarters of Japanese automaker American Honda Motor Company and its luxury vehicle division, Acura. Robinson Helicopters are designed and built in Torrance as are Honeywell's Garrett turbochargers, used on automobile engines worldwide. Alcoa Fastening Systems (now known as Arconic) is headquartered in Torrance, producing aerospace fasteners. Pacific Sales, Pelican Products, Virco, and Rapiscan Systems are among the other companies based in Torrance.\n\nAccording to the city's 2021 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report,[42] the city's top 10 employers (by number of employees) are:\n\nNo. Employer Number of employees 1 Torrance Memorial Health System 3,675 2 Torrance Unified School District 2,581 3 Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center 2,345 4 City of Torrance 1,450 5 Yoshinoya America Inc. 1,300 6 American Honda Motor Co Inc. 1,130 7 Robinson Helicopter Company 937 8 Honeywell Aerospace 730 9 Moog Aircraft Group 710 10 Walmart 686\n\nThe Del Amo Fashion Center, at 2.5 million square feet (230,000 m2), is one of the five largest malls in the United States by gross leasable area. The current mall was created when Del Amo Center, built in 1958, merged with Del Amo Fashion Square, built in 1972. Once located on opposite sides of Carson Street, an expansion of the mall spanning Carson Street joined the two centers by 1982, making it the largest mall in the world at the time. In 2005, the east end of the original mall north of Carson Street was demolished to make way for a new open-air shopping center, opened in mid-September 2006. This was followed in 2015 by the opening of an expanded northern Fashion Wing, with Nordstrom as the mall anchor and supplemented by luxury retailers such as Kate Spade, Hugo Boss, Uniqlo, Michael Kors, and Ben Bridge.[43] The Old Towne Mall was an entertainment-themed mall operating in the 1970s.\n\nAs a major oil-producing region, Torrance was once dotted with thousands of oil wells and oil derricks. Though the oil wells are not as common as they once were, the Torrance oil refinery owned by PBF Energy in the north end of the city is responsible for much of Southern California's gasoline supply.[44] Torrance was an important hub and shop site of the Pacific Electric Railway.[45]\n\nTorrance has a general aviation airport, originally named simply \"Torrance Airport\" and since renamed Zamperini Field after local track star, World War II hero and Torrance High graduate Louis Zamperini. The airport handles approximately 175,000 annual take-offs and landings (473 per day),[46] down from the 1974 record of 428,000 operations. Airport noise abatement is a major local issue.\n\nTorrance is also home to the main bakery facility for King's Hawaiian, the dominant brand of Hawaiian bread in North America.[47] Younger Optics, Torrance's 10th-largest employer, created the first seamless or \"invisible\" bifocal.[48]\n\nThe headquarters of Mitsuwa Marketplace[49] and Nijiya Market[50] are both located in Torrance.\n\nOperations of foreign companies\n\n[edit]\n\nAll Nippon Airways operates its United States headquarters, a customer relations and services office, in Torrance.[51]\n\nThe Toyota Motor Company of Japan established a U.S. headquarters on October 31, 1957, at a former Rambler dealership in Hollywood. Toyota sold 287 Toyopet Crowns and one Land Cruiser during the company's first year of U.S. operation.[52] It moved Toyota Motor Sales USA operations to Torrance in 1982, because of easy access to port facilities and the LAX airport. In 2013, it sold 2.2 million vehicles in the U.S. In 2014, it announced it would move 3,000 of its white-collar employees to Plano, Texas to be closer to its American factories. Numerous other Japanese firms followed Toyota to Los Angeles, because of its location and its reputation as the national trend-setter.[53]\n\nThe Los Angeles South Bay area, as of 2014, has the largest concentration of Japanese companies in the United States.[22]\n\nArts and culture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Armed Forces Day Parade in Torrance, which was first produced in 1960, is the longest-running military parade sponsored by a city. It is held annually on Armed Forces Day, and runs down Torrance Boulevard. The parade features military vehicles, school bands, and prominent community members.[54]\n\nThe Torrance Cultural Arts Center hosts cultural events year-round. In partnership with the City of Torrance, the Torrance Cultural Arts Foundation (TOCA) provides diverse cultural, educational and entertainment experiences. Additional performances are provided by the Torrance Performing Arts Consortium, including The Aerospace Players, Torrance Art Museum, Los Cancioneros Master Chorale, South Bay Ballet, South Bay Conservatory, and The Torrance Symphony.\n\nIn the 2010 Rose Parade, City of Torrance's entry won the top Lathrop K. Leishman trophy for its Garden of Dreams float, judged as the \"Most Beautiful Non-Commercial\" float.
