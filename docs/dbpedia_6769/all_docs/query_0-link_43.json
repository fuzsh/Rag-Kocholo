        "text": "This Progress Report…is later than usual. But this year…is unusual. With a pandemic affecting every major studio, network, and workspace in the USA and beyond, the dust is only now settling when it comes to what new shows will premiere this season.\n\nTo that end, Couch Potatoes Unite! delayed all of our annual Progress Reports to make sure we are understanding the TV landscape in such a way that we would be able to effectively communicate it to you, gentle reader and listener. We think we’re almost there. There is quite a lot still unsorted, but the main five networks are trying to resume their traditional rhythms, and some of the other content outlets are attempting to follow suit.\n\nThus, we now present Progress Report 3 of 2021, the first progress report for the new pilots of the 2021-2022 season! At this point, the primary TV viewing season is over (we think, who knows what is being defined as the “TV season” now), and the calendar has struck the month of October…the fall TV season, such as it is in these pandemic-influenced times, is upon us! Thus, it’s time to shop for new pilots! Since up-fronts were held in May, new TV offerings by networks and some cable outlets (as well as streaming networks) have been announced. It’s time to examine them closely and choose which will be added to the extremely extended lineup covered by this blog!\n\nThanks to TVLine and Metacritic for helping a girl out.\n\n*Note: with the expansion of CPU!, these initial thoughts are based upon the CPU! Chief’s assessments. As with previous seasons, a growing number of CPU! members may find shows initially passed by the CPU! Chief and choose to review them. CPU! readers will be informed if the show’s status changes regarding coverage as the season progresses through the handy CPU! Progress Reports, and all written reviews will be published!\n\n**Second Note: If you haven’t already figured it out, we measure the TV year from June 1st to May 31st.\n\n4400, The CW\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Oct. 25\n\nTIME SLOT: Mondays at 9/8c\n\nWHO: Joseph David-Jones (Arrow), Brittany Adebumola (Grand Army), Jaye Ladymore (Chicago P.D.), AMARR (American Housewife), Cory Jeacoma (Power Book II: Ghost), Derrick A. King (Call Your Mother), Khaliah Johnson, TL Thompson, Ireon Roach, Autumn Best\n\nWHAT: Based on the original USA Network drama, the new take follows 4400 overlooked, undervalued, or otherwise marginalized people who vanished without a trace over the last hundred years are all returned in an instant, having not aged a day and with no memory of what happened to them. As the government races to analyze the potential threat and contain the story, the 4400 themselves must grapple with the fact that they’ve been returned with a few… upgrades, and the increasing likelihood that they were all brought back now for a specific reason.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. Welcome to the 2021-2022 CPU! network pilot review, always full of snark and real talk about upcoming TV from your friendly neighborhood TV podcast, whose business is otherwise unaffected by global pandemics, because TV is an indoor, mask-less activity! Unite with us (and wear a mask/get vaccinated/stay socially distant because this thing ain’t over yet)!\n\nWe start off with a Pick Up because the original 4400 has been mentioned to us every so often as a podcast coverage topic (not necessarily accompanied by volunteers…unless you, gentle reader, would like to be the first), so it seems like this reboot would lend itself well to a “Looking Back to Look Forward” series for both the original and new versions. Plus, adding the twist that the “4400” affected by what is likely extraterrestrial goings-on are from underrepresented and marginalized communities gives the original premise a decidedly spooky and socially relevant context veering into alterna-history places, while also freshening up the premise somewhat to keep it from feeling totally recycled in this era of far too many reboots. Also, the CW airs the kind of stuff that our Couch Potatoes tend to like. So, that’s just a few of the 4400 reasons why we’re aiming to pick up 4400.\n\n__\n\nABBOTT ELEMENTARY, ABC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Quinta Brunson (A Black Lady Sketch Show), Tyler James Williams (Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders, Everybody Hates Chris), Chris Perfetti (In the Dark), Lisa Ann Walter (Emeril), Sheryl Lee Ralph (Ray Donovan, Instant Mom), Janelle James\n\nWHAT: In this workplace comedy, a group of dedicated, passionate teachers — and a slightly tone-deaf principal — are brought together in a Philadelphia public school where, despite the odds stacked against them, they are determined to help their students succeed in life. Though these incredible public servants may be outnumbered and underfunded, they love what they do — even if they don’t love the school district’s less-than-stellar attitude toward educating children.\n\nTeaser trailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. A few chuckles could be had in this sitcom/one camera comedy, and it certainly covers some relevant subject matter. Plus, ABC might be searching for more programming that falls within the same category as black-ish, which is about to air its final season. Still, as winning as Quinta Brunson seems to be in this trailer, the jokes are not exactly inspired, and there will probably be a few “kids say the darndest things” type shenanigans. There seems to be some pro-family viewing possibilities, but will it appeal to our Couch Potatoes? Right now, the bets are no. So, to get this bit of annual flavor out of the way, if buzz and steam and starvation for new network sitcoms in these, our COVID times – or your more direct contact with us via comment on any post, a visit to our guestbook or our social media, or an email to couchpotatoesunitepodcast@gmail.com – convince us to change our minds, which is very easy to do with the right amount of minimal persuasion, we most certainly will go back to school and do the thing.\n\n__\n\nAGT: EXTREME, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Judge Simon Cowell\n\nWHAT: Showcases the most outrageous and jaw-dropping daredevil acts. Each week, extreme contestants will go head-to-head in the most wild, wacky and craziest stunts to vie for the ultimate title.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. We don’t cover reality/game show competitions like your Voices and your American Idols and your America Having Talents-type goings-on – no matter what kind of withering gaze Simon Cowell might throw our way.\n\n__\n\nALL AMERICAN: HOMECOMING, The CW\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Geffri Maya (All American), Peyton Alex Smith (Legacies), Cory Hardrict (S.W.A.T., The Oath), Kelly Jenrette (Manhunt, Grandfathered), Sylvester Powell (Five Points), Camille Hyde (Katy Keene), Netta Walker\n\nWHAT: The spinoff follows a young tennis hopeful from Beverly Hills and an elite baseball player from Chicago as they contend with the high stakes of college sports, while also navigating the highs, lows and sexiness of unsupervised early adulthood at a prestigious Historically Black College.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. The original All American is still on our “Pass” list. No one has requested it for viewing or podcast dissection. Until that changes, we will also pass on relevant spin-offs. Feel free to comment or message with persuasion oriented toward changing our minds.\n\n__\n\nALTER EGO, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Sept. 22\n\nTIME SLOT: Wednesdays at 9/8c\n\nWHO: Judges Alanis Morissette, Nick Lachey, Grimes and will.i.am, plus host Rocsi Diaz\n\nWHAT: A singing competition where lost dreams and second chances are reignited when singers from all walks of life become the stars they’ve always wanted to be. However, these contestants won’t perform as themselves. Rather, they’ll be given the chance to show how they’ve always wanted to be seen, creating their dream avatar alter ego to reinvent themselves and perform like never before.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. We still don’t cover reality/game show competitions on the podcast or blog. Even if we like the judges here (and their music, more or less).\n\n__\n\nAMERICAN AUTO, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Ana Gasteyer (Suburgatory), Harriet Dyer (The InBetween), X Mayo (The Daily Show), Jon Barinholtz (Superstore), Humphrey Ker (Mythic Quest), Michael B. Washington (Ratched), Tye White (Greenleaf)\n\nWHAT: A single-camera workplace comedy set at the headquarters of a major American automotive company in Detroit, where a floundering group of executives try to rediscover the company identity amidst a rapidly changing industry.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Very Hesitantly Pick Up. Honestly, the only reason this reviewer is suggesting the potential of CPU! perusal here comes down to two of the most hesitant reasons: Ana Gasteyer, whose claim to fame is Saturday Night Live, really, but who is a very funny lady, and the fact that this comedy is set in Detroit, which is 2 hours away from our home base in Grand Rapids, Michigan. If we see a trailer, as one is not currently available, to help us review more profoundly the possibility of whether or not this comedy revs our American Auto-type engines, we might reconsider, but this is the minimal of the benefit of the doubt that we can afford based upon home-state pride and, you know, Ana Gasteyer. You go, Ana Gasteyer.\n\n__\n\nAMERICAN SONG CONTEST, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHAT: Based on the worldwide phenomenon Eurovision Song Contest, the U.S. version will feature live original musical performances, representing all 50 states, five U.S. territories and our nation’s capital, competing to win the country’s vote for the Best Original Song. An incredible solo artist, duo, DJ or a band will represent each location and will perform a new, original song, celebrating the different styles and genres across America. The live competition consists of three rounds as the acts compete in a series of Qualifying Rounds, followed by the Semi Finals and the ultimate Grand Final, where one state or territory will emerge victorious.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. What a mass quantity of reality/game show competitions being introduced this year, particularly on NBC. Et tu, Peacock?\n\n__\n\nTHE BIG LEAP, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Sept. 20\n\nTIME SLOT: Mondays at 9/8c\n\nWHO: Scott Foley (Scandal, Whiskey Cavalier), Piper Perabo (Covert Affairs), Teri Polo (The Fosters), Mallory Jansen (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), Kevin Daniels (Council of Dads), Ser’Darius Blain (Charmed), Ray Cham (Five Points), Jon Rudnitsky (Catch-22), Simone Recasner\n\nWHAT: A group of diverse underdogs from all different walks of life compete to be part of a competition reality series that is putting on a modern, hip remake of Swan Lake. What they lack in the traditional dancer body type, they make up for with their edge, wit and desire to reimagine an iconic story to fit their own mold.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. If we’re going to pick up one show set in Detroit, we might as well pick ’em all up. More to the point, however, this show has many more of the ingredients that convincingly appeal to our Couch Potatoes – an underdog story, some snappy social commentary, theater and dancing (!), and an appeal to our larger world. Having a trailer is helpful when making these sorts of observations, you know. Plus, Scott Foley is somewhat underrated, quite possibly ever since his Felicity days. Maybe this new series will be one that sticks. Note: this show has already premiered at the time of publication of this Fall Preview, so if you have any snap judgments, let us know by commenting below!\n\n__\n\nTHE CLEANING LADY, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Élodie Yung (Marvel’s Daredevil, The Defenders), Adan Canto (Designated Survivor), Oliver Hudson (Rules of Engagement), Martha Millan (The OA, As the World Turns), Sebastien LaSalle & Valentino LaSalle\n\nWHAT: Based on the Argentine series La Chica que Limpia, this darkly aspirational character drama follows a whip-smart doctor who comes to the U.S. for a medical treatment to save her ailing son. But when the system fails and pushes her into hiding, she refuses to be beaten down and marginalized. Instead, she becomes a cleaning lady for the mob and starts playing the game by her own rules.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Well, this Americanized retooling of an Argentine thriller bears the hallmarks of potential, drawing upon a premise that has not been overly done on any US TV series, much less on network TV. There are two problems here, however. One is that the trailer suggests something soapy and sexy but without much substance. One is that the featured player is Elodie Yung, otherwise known as Elektra in Marvel’s Daredevil and the related Netflix Marvel properties. For our Marvel’s Defenders Series panel, and primarily for the Chief Couch Potato (aka me), who moderated the panel, Yung was a bit of a weak spot performance-wise in an otherwise exemplary adaptation of a beloved comic property. Elektra is not really a sympathetic character; however, Yung did not really bring nuance to the lack of sympathy owed to Matt Murdock’s toxic love interest. She feels about as convincing in this role as she did in that one. She might be able to pull off some more sweet fight choreography if the eponymous cleaning lady is able to throw down at a mob-sponsored hoedown, but the emotional character development is the stretch we’re reaching for here, and, granted, a trailer is but two minutes, but we have a dossier of less convincing dimensionality for a less dimensional character (seemingly). If buzz or steam convince us to take another look, we’ll be more than cheerful to scrub the floor of this initial hot take, but for right now, call housekeeping and take this one to the corner. Sorry, Ms. Yung.\n\n__\n\nCSI: VEGAS, CBS\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Oct. 6\n\nTIME SLOT: Wednesdays at 10/9c\n\nWHO: Original CSI stars William Petersen, Jorja Fox and Wallace Langham, plus Paul Guilfoyle, who will guest-star. New cast includes Matt Lauria (Friday Night Lights, Kingdom), Paula Newsome (Chicago Med, Barry), Mel Rodriguez (The Last Man on Earth) and Mandeep Dhillon (After Life).\n\nWHAT: The series opens a brand new chapter in Las Vegas, the city where it all began. Facing an existential threat that could bring down the entire Crime Lab and release thousands of convicted killers back onto the neon-lit streets of Vegas, a brilliant new team of investigators led by Maxine Roby (Newsome) must enlist the help of old friends, Gil Grissom (Petersen), Sara Sidle (Fox) and David Hodges (Langham). This combined force will deploy the latest forensic techniques to do what they do best —follow the evidence — in order to preserve and serve justice in Sin City.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. We are not currently covering any entry in the CSI franchise and have no percolating requests to do so. If we start to receive some indication that people want to hear our opinions about any of the CSIs, we will probably start with the original show and work our way out from there. For now, CSI: Vegas will just have to stay in Vegas.\n\n__\n\nCOME DANCE WITH ME, CBS\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Host Philip Lawrence with judges Jenna Dewan, Tricia Miranda and Dexter Mayfield\n\nWHAT: Young dancers from across the country invite one inspirational, untrained family member or other adult who has supported their dance dreams, to become their dance partner for a chance to strut their stuff for a grand prize.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. It’s a dance/reality competition. We don’t cover those on our podcast, but we do like to keep you informed, gentle listener. For the pilot season, anyway.\n\n__\n\nDOMINO MASTERS, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Host Eric Stonestreet\n\nWHAT: The competition series features teams of domino enthusiasts facing off in an unbelievable domino toppling and chain reaction tournament.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Hey – isn’t that the guy from Modern Family? This is a game show. With dominoes. We don’t cover those on our podcast, either. With or without dominoes. Tell us how the topples go.\n\n__\n\nDON’T FORGET THE LYRICS!, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Host Niecy Nash\n\nWHAT: The game show returns to challenge contestants’ musical memory, as they get one song closer to winning $1 million if they don’t forget the lyrics. Contestants will choose songs from different genres, decades and musical artists. Then they’ll take center stage to sing alongside the studio band as the lyrics are projected on screen – but suddenly the music will stop, and the words will disappear.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Another game show, another pass. Though, music is nice.\n\n__\n\nTHE ENDGAME, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Morena Baccarin (Gotham), Ryan Michelle Bathe (All Rise), Costa Ronin (The Americans), Noah Bean (Nikita), Kamal Bolden (Rosewood), Jordan Johnson-Hinds (Nurses), Mark D. Espinoza (Major Crimes)\n\nWHAT: A pulse-pounding, high-stakes thriller about Elena Federova (Baccarin), a very recently captured international arms dealer and brilliant criminal mastermind who even in captivity orchestrates a number of coordinated bank heists, and Val Turner (Bathe), the principled, relentless and socially outcast FBI agent who will stop at nothing to foil her ambitious plan.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. A trailer would be so helpful, but as this series is a midseason entry, we want what we can’t have. The reason we are giving this a hesitant shot: Morena Baccarin. She has nerd cred for days with our resident Couch Potatoes, and her portraying some kind of antihero/criminal mastermind orchestrating crimes from prison seems like an interesting premise to play off Morena’s trademark sense of dramatic delivery. The endgame of The Endgame could fall flat, but Morena induces the slowly rising thumbs-up. Let’s see what the future holds here.\n\n__\n\nFBI: INTERNATIONAL, CBS\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Sept. 21 at 10/9c (special time)\n\nTIME SLOT: Tuesdays at 9/8c\n\nWHO: Luke Kleintank (The Man in the High Castle, Bones), Heida Reed (Poldark), Vinessa Vidotto (Lucifer), Christiane Paul (Counterpart), Carter Redwood (The Long Road Home)\n\nWHAT: Debuting in a crossover episode of FBI and FBI: Most Wanted next season, the offshoot follows the FBI’s International Fly Team as they travel the world with the mission of tracking and neutralizing threats against American citizens wherever they may be. Not allowed to carry guns, the Fly Team relies on intelligence, quick thinking and pure brawn as they put their lives on the line to protect the U.S. and its people.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Like the CSI franchise, we have no one clamoring for our opinions about the now apparent FBI franchise. Until someone wants to discuss or wants us to discuss the flagship show, we’re going to have to remand this back to Quantico. Unless Fox Mulder or Dana Scully appear in it. Then we can talk about the FBI, International and otherwise.\n\n__\n\nGHOSTS, CBS\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Oct. 7\n\nTIME SLOT: Thursdays at 9/8c\n\nWHO: Rose McIver (iZombie), Utkarsh Ambudkar (Brockmire, The Mindy Project), Brandon Scott Jones (The Good Place)\n\nWHAT: In the single-camera comedy, a struggling young couple’s dreams come true when they inherit a beautiful country house, only to find it’s both falling apart and inhabited by many of the deceased previous residents.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. Maybe it’s because we’re completing our Fall Preview reviews late and during spooky season, but this trailer and the premise for this sitcom are both fresh and funny. The comedy comes from a group of spirits haunting a house that the couple, part of whom is played by the erstwhile Liv from CPU! favorite iZombie, Rose McIver, wants to turn into a bed and breakfast. The problem is, the place is haunted by some decidedly sassy spirits, who all seem to team up to render the living couple’s nightmares some of the living dead, only Rose’s character hits her head, spends time in a coma, and begins to commune with the deceased occupants of the property. It’s a premise that takes a bit from a few genres, mixes the bits up in a blender, and pairs the resulting goo with some snappy joke-telling. I see a lot of appeal for our CP’s and for those who listen to them, so possessing these ghosts on our watchlist we shall.\n\n__\n\nGRAND CREW, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Nicole Byer (Nailed It!), Echo Kellum (Arrow), Aaron Jennings (Pure Genius), Carl Tart (Bajillion Dollar Propertie$), Justin Cunningham (When They See Us)\n\nWHAT: A group of Black friends unpack the ups and downs of life and love at a wine bar.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Wine bars are appealing, and this friendship-based comedy might have some grand (crew) potential, but we need a trailer to do a full evaluation. If you see one, let us know, though Mr. Terrific from Arrow, i.e. Echo Kellum, is a welcome face that we love at CPU!\n\n__\n\nGOOD SAM, CBS\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Sophia Bush (Chicago P.D.), Jason Isaacs (The OA, Star Trek: Discovery), Michael Stahl-David (Narcos, The Deuce), Skye P. Marshall (Black Lightning), Edwin Hodge (Mayans M.C., Chicago Fire), Davi Santos (Tell Me a Story), Omar Maskati (Unbelievable), Wendy Crewson (Saving Hope)\n\nWHAT: A talented yet stifled surgeon embraces her leadership role after her renowned and pompous boss falls into a coma. When he awakens and wants to resume surgery, however, it falls to her to supervise this overbearing blowhard who never acknowledged her talents — and also happens to be her father.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. So many medical dramas pockmark the TV landscape, and they are hit or miss with our resident sofa-occupying taters. The trailer for this medical drama does not offer much in terms of new and different, except maybe Lucius Malfoy from the Harry Potter films sporting an American accent. This is really a family/father-daughter drama set in a hospital, and while that sort of dynamic is bound to appeal to some, this reviewer is not convinced that this will be a good entry for our Good Sam(antha) or any of our other panelists. Of course, please feel free to request it for podcast coverage if you see potential that we do not. We can change (and have changed) our minds.\n\n__\n\nHOME SWEET HOME, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Oct. 15\n\nTIME SLOT: Fridays at 8/7c\n\nWHAT: Executive-produced by Ava DuVernay, the unscripted series follows two families who lead very different lives for a life-changing experience. It explores what it’s like to walk a mile in another person’s shoes by challenging racial, religious, economic, geographic, gender and identity assumptions as participants exchange homes for a week and experience the life of someone unlike them.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. This is an unscripted home-swap show. We cover scripted shows on the CPU! podcast. Someday, when our reality arm gets up and running… if you would like to be a producer for that arm, contact the Chief CP!\n\n__\n\nKRAPOPOLIS, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2022\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: The voices of Hannah Waddingham (Ted Lasso), Richard Ayoade (The IT Crowd), Matt Berry (What We Do in the Shadows), Pam Murphy (Mapleworth Murders), Duncan Trussell (The Midnight Gospel)\n\nWHAT: Created by Dan Harmon (Rick and Morty), the animated comedy is set in mythical ancient Greece and is centered on a flawed family of humans, gods and monsters that tries to run one of the world’s first cities without killing each other.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. Fox’s newest primetime animation entry brings in a new creation of Rick and Morty‘s Dan Harmon, and while a teaser would be particularly helpful, we know that Mr. Harmon doesn’t produce c(k)rap. We have a few requests to cover R&M, but a cartoon set in mythical ancient Greece that has not been Disney-fied, and that could be satirical even as its animation is about the ancients, has some serious potential. How much potential remains to be seen – so seeing the season itself will probably be most informative in that regard. Thus, a hesitant pick up but one all the same.\n\n__\n\nLA BREA, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Sept. 28\n\nTIME SLOT: Tuesdays at 9/8c\n\nWHO: Natalie Zea (The Detour), Eoin Macken (The Night Shift), Jon Seda (Chicago P.D.), Nicholas Gonzalez (The Good Doctor), Veronica St. Clair (13 Reasons Why), Jack Martin (All Rise), Rohan Mirchandaney (Hotel Mumbai), Chiké Okonkwo (Being Mary Jane), Josh McKenzie (Filthy Rich), Chloe De Los Santos (Tidelands), Zyra Gorecki, Lily Santiago\n\nWHAT: When a massive sinkhole mysteriously opens in Los Angeles, it tears a family in half, separating mother and son from father and daughter. When part of the family find themselves in an unexplainable primeval world, alongside a disparate group of strangers, they must work to survive and uncover the mystery of where they are and if there is a way back home.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. Though this show is on NBC, who does not do right by its genre entries often, this Land of the Lost meets Neverending Story mystery/sci-fi/fantasy vehicle feels like it would have likely appeal for our United Couch Potatoes, and there are some cool, cinematic visual effects that certainly present intrigue in this trailer. Will this fictional, primeval world entice for the long haul? We’ll have to visit La Brea ourselves to fully see.\n\n__\n\nLA FIRE AND RESCUE, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHAT: The docuseries chronicles the Los Angeles County Fire Department. “From helicopter mountain rescues, lifeguard beach SOS, fireboats, hazmat units, to California’s raging wildfires… they do it all,” read the official synopsis. ‘These firefighters are true everyday heroes and their compelling stories will be told alongside the heart-pounding action of unpredictable and dangerous circumstances as they face the front lines of life and death.”\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. This is a docuseries. As in actual reality, not even stylized reality, like The Voice or similar. We talk about the long-form storytelling of the small screen. As in, we like to escape reality. Though we support all of our first responders, we prefer not to watch or talk about them (for now).\n\n__\n\nLEGENDS OF THE HIDDEN TEMPLE, The CW\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Oct. 10\n\nTIME SLOT: Sundays at 8/7c\n\nWHO: Host Cristela Alonzo, Dee Bradley Baker returning as the voice of Olmec\n\nWHAT: A reimagining of the Nickelodeon game show, now featuring adults as contestants. The new take will bring back fan-favorite elements, including the Moat Crossings, the Steps of Knowledge and the Temple Run. The team names — Purple Parrots, Blue Barracudas, Orange Iguanas, Red Jaguars, Silver Snakes and Green Monkeys — will also remain unchanged. This revamped Hidden Temple promises “tougher challenges” and “much bigger prizes” as each episode pits five teams against one other to enter Olmec’s Temple, discover a treasure and return it to its rightful place — all while avoiding the infamous Temple Guards.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Though it’s a fun, adult remake of a fun game show once produced on Nickelodeon, it’s still a game show. Tell Olmec we said hello.\n\n__\n\nMAGGIE, ABC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Rebecca Rittenhouse (The Mindy Project), Nichole Sakura (Superstore), Angelique Cabral (Life in Pieces), Chloe Bridges (The Carrie Diaries), Kerri Kenney (Reno 911), David Del Rio (The Baker and the Beauty), Chris Elliott (Schitt’s Creek), Ray Ford (Grey’s Anatomy), Leonardo Nam (Westworld)\n\nWHAT: Follows a young woman trying to cope with life as a psychic. Maggie regularly sees the fate of her friends, parents, clients, and random strangers on the street, but when she suddenly sees a glimpse of her own future, Maggie is forced to start living in her own present. Based on the short film of the same name by Tim Curcio.\n\nTeaser trailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. While placing a psychic at the center of this romantic comedy makes for an interesting premise, the teaser did not present enough establishing information to bear witness to any potential chemistry between the characters comprising the main couple. Also, as this comedy is based upon a short film, the question becomes whether or not this premise, clairvoyant though it might be, can sustain over several episodes, much less several seasons of episodes. If we hear or see buzz or steam suggesting the contrary, we’ll be happy to look into our crystal balls or do a bit of palmistry to walk back our initial snap judgment, but for now, there is too little to go on to make the future of this series seem like a bright one.\n\n__\n\nMONARCH, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Jan. 30 (after the NFC Championship) and continuing Feb. 1\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Susan Sarandon (Feud), Anna Friel (Pushing Daisies), Trace Adkins, Josh Sasse (Galavant), Beth Ditto, Meagan Holder, Inigo Pascual, Martha Higareda, Emma Milani\n\nWHAT: A Texas-sized, multigenerational musical drama about America’s first family of country music. The Romans are headed by the insanely talented, but tough as nails Queen of Country Music Dottie Cantrell Roman (Sarandon). Along with her beloved husband, Albie, Dottie has created a country music dynasty. But even though the Roman name is synonymous with authenticity, the very foundation of their success is a lie. And when their reign as country royalty is put in jeopardy, heir to the crown Nicolette “Nicky” Roman (Friel) will stop at nothing to protect her family’s legacy, while ensuring her own quest for stardom.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. This is a tough pass because Susan Sarandon is worth her weight in Oscar gold, but does this not seem like a slightly repurposed Nashville with a bigger star than Connie Britton at its forefront – and with a little Dallas thrown into the mix, given the size of the family and potential location? Convince us to give it a look when a trailer comes around, and maybe we’ll be singing some lowdown country confessional walking back our initial pass, but the echoes of other TV shows gone by reverberate a bit too closely to the premise of this series, which, for now, leaves our preview snap judgment reigning supreme.\n\n__\n\nNAOMI, The CW\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Kaci Walfall (Army Wives), Barry Watson (7th Heaven), Alexander Wraith (Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), Cranston Johnson (Hap and Leonard), Mouzam Makkar (The Fix, Champions), Mary-Charles Jones (Kevin Can Wait), Aidan Gemme (Broadway’s Finding Neverland), Daniel Puig, Camila Moreno, Will Meyers\n\nWHAT: Based on DC Comics characters, the drama follows a teen girl’s journey from her small northwestern town to the heights of the multiverse. When a supernatural event shakes her hometown to the core, Naomi sets out to uncover its origins, and what she discovers will challenge everything we believe about our heroes.\n\nTeaser trailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Very Hesitantly Pick Up. The teaser offers little on which to base much of an assessment, particularly since the lead actress does not even get much chance to act; however, it is set in the DC Universe, and the premise description presents a small amount of intrigue, even as going into watching this new DC-based entry inspires a large amount of hesitation. We love our superheroes around here, though, so we’ll give Naomi a go.\n\n__\n\nNCIS: HAWAI’I, CBS\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Sept. 20\n\nTIME SLOT: Mondays at 10/9c\n\nWHO: Vanessa Lachey (BH90210, Call Me Kat), Yasmine Al-Bustami (The Originals), Jason Antoon (Claws), Noah Mills (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, The Brave), Tori Anderson (No Tomorrow), Alex Tarrant (800 Words, New Zealand’s Vegas)\n\nWHAT: The franchise expands to the Aloha State, where the first female Special Agent in Charge of NCIS Pearl Harbor, Jane Tennant (Lachey), has thrived and risen through the ranks by equal parts confidence and strategy in a system that has pushed back on her every step of the way. Together with her unwavering team of specialists, they balance duty to family and country while investigating high-stakes crimes involving military personnel, national security and the mysteries of the sun-drenched island paradise itself.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Like the CSI and FBI franchises, we have no one clamoring for our opinions about the NCIS franchise. Until someone wants to discuss or wants us to discuss the flagship show, this one goes on the pass pile along with the other procedural spinoff series.\n\n__\n\nNEXT LEVEL CHEF, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Mentors Gordon Ramsey, Nyesha Arrington, Gino D’Acampo\n\nWHAT: Aspiring chefs compete in cooking challenges on each level of a three-story tower for the $250,000 grand prize.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. If it’s hosted by Gordon Ramsey, it’s probably ineligible for Couch Potatoes Unite! type podcast discussions. I wonder if he’ll still yell at the contestants?\n\n__\n\nNIGHT COURT, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Melissa Rauch (The Big Bang Theory), John Larroquette (the original Night Court, The Good Fight)\n\nWHAT: Unapologetically optimistic judge Abby Stone (Rauch), the daughter of the late Harry Stone, follows in her father’s footsteps as she presides over the night shift of a Manhattan arraignment court and tries to bring order to its crew of oddballs and cynics, most notably former night court prosecutor Dan Fielding (Larroquette).\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Very Hesitantly Pick Up. The original Night Court was enjoyable situation comedy comfort-TV from the 80s sitcom heyday, and we’re game to give this revival/reboot a teensy peek based upon the parent series’ strength of comedy and entertainment. Our hesitation, however, comes from the fact that most of the actors who comprised the cast have aged away from their decades-old roles or have passed away, including the inimitable Harry Anderson, the late actor who played the late, magic trick-performing Judge Harry Stone, the apparent father of the judge at the heart of this remake. Can only Dan Fielding as the character connective tissue to the original be enough to make this sitcom sequel as funny as its predecessor? We’re skeptical, but we’re nostalgic, and we like to Look Back to Look Forward around here. If the night court is in session, we’ll let the bailiff call us into the whole affair but only because it’s all at night.\n\n__\n\nORDINARY JOE, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Sept. 20\n\nTIME SLOT: Mondays at 10/9c\n\nWHO: James Wolk (Watchmen, Zoo), Natalie Martinez (Under the Dome), Charlie Barnett (Arrow, Russian Doll), Elizabeth Lail (YOU)\n\nWHAT: Explores the three parallel lives of the show’s main character after he makes a pivotal choice at a crossroads in his life. The series asks the question of how different life might look if you made your decision based on love, loyalty, or passion.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Very Hesitantly Pick Up. The hesitation for this pick up rests with the fact that the show demands viewer identification with the main character three times over in a sort of This Is Us meets It’s a Wonderful Life telltale of three possible life trajectories. This could either be original and enticing, if all three of the trajectories are compelling, or could fall flat if neither the life at the center of the story nor his parallel lives offer a solid and universal enough connection to viewer to sustain over a season or more of this story. Points are awarded for originality, though, and the thought of the so-called Joe at the heart of the tale being able to “see” each of these life trajectories is intriguing – is it real, and what does it mean? This show has aired a few episodes at the time of publication; tell us what you think in the comments below!\n\n__\n\nOUR KIND OF PEOPLE, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Sept. 21\n\nTIME SLOT: Tuesdays at 9/8c\n\nWHO: Yaya DaCosta (Chicago Med), Morris Chestnut (The Resident), Joe Morton (God Friended Me, Scandal), Rhyon Nicole Brown (Empire), Lance Gross (House of Payne, Star), Kyle Bary (Ginny & Georgia), Nadine Ellis (Greenhouse Academy), Alana Bright, recurring player Debbi Morgan (Power, All My Children)\n\nWHAT: Executive-produced by Lee Daniels (Empire), the drama takes place in the aspirational world of Oak Bluffs on Martha’s Vineyard, a historical stronghold where the rich and powerful Black elite have come to play for over 50 years. Strong-willed single mom Angela Vaughn sets out to reclaim her family’s name and make an impact with her revolutionary haircare line that highlights the innate, natural beauty of Black women. But she soon discovers a dark secret about her mother’s past that will turn her world upside-down and shake up this community forever.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. The cast is fabulous. Hey hey, Morris Chestnut! The story, however, derivatively resonates from Empire meets Revenge or Dynasty. This show will find an audience, this reviewer suspects, but how much of one will be the podcasting kind of people? If the show gets requested for podcast coverage, we’ll readily put it on the list, but right now, this sudsy soap might be too like others that have come before to entice many of our discerning television viewers – at least for now.\n\n__\n\nPIVOTING, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Eliza Coupe (Happy Endings), Ginnifer Goodwin (Why Women Kill, Once Upon a Time), Maggie Q (Designated Survivor), Tommy Dewey (Casual, The Mindy Project), JT Neal (Bless This Mess), Marcello Julian Reyes (Modern Family)\n\nWHAT: The single-camera comedy follows three women after the death of their childhood best friend. Faced with the reality that life is short, in desperate attempts to find happiness, they make a series of impulsive, ill-advised and self-indulgent decisions, strengthening their bond and proving it’s never too late to screw up your life.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Hm. This appears to be a wish fulfillment comedy, and while there is quite a trio of compelling actresses at the heart of this sitcom, the premise feels like it’s going to win some or lose some just by riding its foundations. In other words, this comedy will be funniest to people who have made similar choices and have learned to laugh at themselves and their circumstances and will be least funny to those who have made similar choices and don’t see the joke in their own lives. All other viewers will likely fall somewhere in between. The trailer also offers what feels like a stunted sampling of the best this sitcom has to offer, so if this is viewed and seen as funnier than the two minutes produced here, let us know. We can certainly be convinced to pivot ourselves (even if doing so reminds us of a large white couch in a decidedly narrow stairwell).\n\n__\n\nPROMISED LAND, ABC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: TBA\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: John Ortiz (Rake), Bellamy Young (Prodigal Son, Scandal), Cecilia Suárez (La casa de las flores), Augusto Aguilera (Made for Love), Christina Ochoa (A Million Little Things), Mariel Molino (Papis muy padres), Tonatiuh (Vida), Katya Martín (The Affair) as Juana, Andres Velez, Rolando Chusan\n\nWHAT: An epic, generation-spanning drama about two Latino families vying for wealth and power in California’s Sonoma Valley.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. It seems dramas featuring big, wealthy, powerful families – a la Dallas and Dynasty – are the genre du jour this season. Like Monarch and Our Kind of People, we are going to jump into the passing lane and find a different promised land, especially without a trailer available by which to evaluate the goods. If we’re not watching one of these ilk, we feel compelled to pass on all of them – at least, until someone recommends that we do otherwise, of course.\n\n__\n\nQUEENS, ABC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Oct. 19\n\nTIME SLOT: Tuesdays at 10/9c\n\nWHO: Eve (Eve), Brandy (Moesha), Naturi Naughton (Power), Nadine Velazquez (My Name Is Earl), Pepi Sonuga (Famous in Love), Taylor Selé (P-Valley)\n\nWHAT: In the drama, estranged and out-of-touch, four women in their 40s reunite for a chance to recapture their fame and regain the swagger they had as the Nasty Bitches, their ’90s group that made them legends in the hip-hop world.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. While the drama of a reuniting 90s girl hip-hop group could get old fast if not handled well, there is something super enticing about pairing a less-sassy Eve with a sassier Brandy and seeing how the 90s nostalgia provides ample incidental underscoring for something that could just be fun and entertainment to watch. On the other hand, it could also be a little too “mad corny” as Brandy’s character opines in the trailer, so the hesitation in this evaluation emerges. Still, there are more than a few queens in this stellar cast with the promise of potential musical fun, so it’s worth a cautious look-see at least.\n\n__\n\nSMALLWOOD, CBS\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Pete Holmes (Crashing), Katie Lowes (Scandal), Chi McBride (Hawaii Five-O)\n\nWHAT: After being laid off from the assembly line at the GM factory, a seemingly ordinary man makes the extraordinary decision to provide for his family by following his dream of becoming a professional bowler. Based on professional bowler Tom Smallwood’s life.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. It’s a human interest story about a factory-worker turned professional bowler, but, beyond that, the tone is confusing. Is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Is it a comedy-drama? Also, the acting in this trailer is not the best, and it features canned laughter punctuating certain moments of this mundanely executed two minutes. This was, frankly, a boring preview, and there is nothing strong in what we see to entice us to go deeper. If you think that we’re being small about Smallwood, drop us a line, but we do not expect a long life for this series based upon this preliminary review.\n\n__\n\nTHAT’S MY JAM, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Host Jimmy Fallon\n\nWHAT: An hourlong music and comedy variety event series that draws its creative DNA from The Tonight Show games such as “Wheel of Musical Impressions,” “Roots Name That Song” and “Slay It Don’t Spray It.” In each episode, two teams of two celebrities compete for charity in a series of music and dance-based games, performative segments and play-along trivia.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. We also don’t cover variety shows or shows featuring celebrity competition (see also: The Masked Singer). That isn’t to say we won’t be watching. We just won’t be talking about the fact that we’re watching. Though Daniel Radcliffe should get himself a slot on this show. His rendition of “Alphabet Rap” was pretty dope.\n\nThis was delayed from the 2020-2021 TV season, and our initial review was written in fall 2020.\n\n__\n\nTHE THING ABOUT PAM, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Renee Zellweger (What/If), Josh Duhamel (Las Vegas), Judy Greer (Kidding), Katy Mixon (American Housewife)\n\nWHAT: The six-episode limited drama is based on the 2011 murder of Betsy Faria that resulted in her husband Russ’ conviction, but he insisted he did not kill her. His conviction was later overturned. This brutal crime set off a chain of events that would expose a diabolical scheme deeply involving Pam Hupp (Zellweger).\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. As much as we love Renee Zellweger around here (and Josh Duhamel and Judy Greer and Katy Mixon), this limited true-crime drama series does not seem to hold much in the way of storytelling new and different from the podcast(s) and journalism covering this same story. The thing about this show is, if this series is requested for podcast coverage, we will reconsider, but true crime is not one of the requested genres currently being discussed.\n\n__\n\nTOM SWIFT, The CW\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Tian Richards (Being Mary Jane), the voice of LeVar Burton (Star Trek: The Next Generation)\n\nWHAT: The Nancy Drew spinoff follows the serialized adventures of its titular Black, gay, billionaire inventor who is thrust into a world of sci-fi conspiracy and unexplained phenomena after the shocking disappearance of his father. Tom takes to the road on a quest to unravel the truth, leaving behind the comforts of his usual moneyed lifestyle, all while fighting to stay one step ahead of an Illuminati-scale group hell-bent on stopping him. Tom’s missions will require his genius and flair for innovation guided by love, romance, friendship and the mysteries of the universe yet-unsolved.\n\nTeaser trailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass For Now. Nancy Drew has been requested for podcast coverage and is on our long list of requested discussions waiting to be produced. Since this show is a spin-off of that venerable adaptation, we prefer to start by visiting the parent show before perusing the content surrounding Tom Swift. You don’t have to take our word for it, though (that one’s for you, LeVar).\n\n__\n\nWELCOME TO FLATCH, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Chelsea Holmes, Sam Straley (The Kids Are Alright), Seann William Scott (Lethal Weapon), Aya Cash (You’re the Worst), Taylor Ortega (Kim Possible movie), Krystal Smith, Justin Linville\n\nWHAT: In this half-hour mockumentary inspired by the BBC format, a documentary crew goes to a small town to study young adults and their current concerns. Their focus is the daily lives of cousins Kelly (Holmes) and Shrub Mallet (Straley) and their idiosyncratic surroundings. We follow the cousins as they pursue their dreams, confront challenges, and fight each other for frozen pizza. These two don’t have much, but they do have each other.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. With the creators and producers (and their sensibilities) of The Office behind this mockumentary-driven slice of small town, Midwestern life – a vantage point to which may of our resident Couch Potatoes can most likely relate – the potential for sincere comedy, so long as it stays above the line of too much judgment and/or criticism, is rife in this new series. We probably can all think of a place like Flatch. The question is, can we laugh at that notion over the course of multiple episodes (and/or seasons of episodes). The trailer leaves us thinking that it’s worth a trip to Flatch to find out.\n\n__\n\nTHE WHEEL, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Host Michael McIntyre\n\nWHAT: Based on the BBC game show, the series will put viewers into a spin each week as celebrity guests attempt to help contestants win big, with a 42-foot-wide spinning wheel.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. If it’s not a drama about a big, multi-generational, multi-geographical family with a heaping dose of entitlement seeping through the camera lens, it’s a game show this season. We’ll be spinning right round this wheel as a result, thanks.\n\n__\n\nWOMEN OF THE MOVEMENT, ABC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Adrienne Warren, Tonya Pinkins, Cedric Joe, Ray Fisher, Glynn Turman, Chris Coy, Carter Jenkins, Julia McDermott\n\nWHAT: The limited series tells the story of Mamie Till-Mobley, who in 1955 risks her life to find justice after her son Emmett is brutally murdered in the Jim Crow South. Unwilling to let Emmett’s murder disappear from the headlines, Mamie chooses to bear her pain on the world stage, emerging as an activist for justice and igniting the Civil Rights movement as we know it today.\n\nTeaser trailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. It’s a limited engagement dramatization of the Emmett Till story. If you don’t know this tragic piece of history, and you are looking to understand more about the history of civil rights and the movement in this country, you should watch it simply for the educational value. Will Smith is among the show’s laudable production team.\n\n__\n\nTHE WONDER YEARS, ABC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Sept. 22\n\nTIME SLOT: Wednesdays at 8:30/7:30c\n\nWHO: Elisha “EJ” Williams, Dulé Hill (Suits, Psych), Saycon Sengbloh (In the Dark), Laura Kariuki (Black Lightning), Milan Ray, Julian Lerner, Amari O’Neil, narrator Don Cheadle\n\nWHAT: The reboot is a coming of age story set in the late 1960s that takes a nostalgic look at a black middle-class family in Montgomery, Alabama through the point-of-view of imaginative 12 year-old Dean. With the wisdom of his adult years, Dean’s hopeful and humorous recollections show how his family found their “wonder years” in a turbulent time.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. Like the classic series starring Fred Savage and featuring narrator Daniel Stern, this version of The Wonder Years hearkens back to life in the late 1960s. The difference here is that this story shifts the narrative to the black/African-American perspective in the American South during that period, rather than focusing upon a white family from Anywhere, USA. The reviews of the new show have been somewhat middling; we hope that the series is just taking some time to find its footing. There is potential for a Looking Back to Look Forward CPU! compare and contrast exercise here. We hope that this series survives long enough to make it worthwhile.\n\n__\n\nThe following is a link to all premiere dates for shows covered beyond the main networks:\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/feature/tv-premiere-dates\n\nNon-Broadcast Network Pick-Ups\n\nWe Are Lady Parts (Peacock): It’s been requested for podcast coverage by resident Couch Potatoes (CP’s).

Together they form an unlikely bond and begin a journey that will change both of their lives.\n\nTeaser trailer available at TVLine.com or at CBS’ YouTube Channel.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Welcome to the 2020-2021 CPU! network pilot review, always full of snark and real talk about upcoming TV from your friendly neighborhood TV podcast, whose business is otherwise unaffected by global pandemics, as we’re too afraid to leave our houses and, therefore, spend an even more inordinate time watching TV! Unite with us (and wear a mask)!\n\nWe start off with a pass because, as earnestly as we support humanity’s giving natures and organ donation when needed, the subject and the slapstick cut of this teaser trailer render us feeling like the topic and the tone of this series don’t quite match, despite a fairly fresh premise to start this situation comedy off reasonably right. Another way of looking at this snap judgment comes down to the idea that if this the best thirty seconds the Eye can provide to sell this sitcom, the humor falls flat quickly, even if spontaneous organ donation is intended to elicit at least a few smiles. We want to “b” into it, positively, but we’re not quite there.\n\nAnd to get this bit of annual flavor out of the way, if buzz and steam and starvation for new network sitcoms in these, our COVID times – or your more direct contact with us via comment on any post, a visit to our guestbook or our social media, or an email to couchpotatoesunitepodcast@gmail.com – convince us to change our minds, which is very easy to do with the right amount of minimal persuasion, we most certainly will! I’m positive!\n\n__\n\nBIG SKY, ABC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Fall 2020\n\nTIME SLOT: Tuesdays at 10/9c\n\nWHO: Kylie Bunbury (Pitch), Katheryn Winnick (Vikings), Ryan Phillippe (Shooter), Brian Geraghty (Chicago P.D.), John Carroll Lynch (American Horror Story), Dedee Pfeiffer (Cybill), Natalie Alyn Lind (The Gifted), Jade Pettyjohn (Little Fires Everywhere), Jesse James Keitel\n\nWHAT: In this procedural thriller, private detective Cassie Dewell (Bunbury) partners with ex-cop Jenny Hoyt (Winnick) on a search for two sisters who have been kidnapped by a truck driver on a remote highway in Montana, but when they discover that these are not the only girls who have disappeared in the area, they must race against the clock to stop the killer before another woman is taken.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Without a trailer to help steer us toward this procedural thriller, I am afraid that we’ll have to steer away. Procedural TV is a genre not typically requested by our resident Couch Potatoes unless the procedural overlay is set off by a gimmick or a quirk that renders it somewhat different from the typical fare. Various vehicles featuring murder and detective work have come and gone in recent seasons; some have been canceled quickly, and though the lead actress is named Kylie (which this Kylie can get behind), we don’t have enough information about either this series premise or its cast to feel motivated to add it to our already as-large-as-the-sky lists of recommended TV. Big facts.\n\n__\n\nCALL ME KAT, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Mayim Bialik (The Big Bang Theory), Swoosie Kurtz (Mike & Molly), Cheyenne Jackson (American Horror Story), Kyla Pratt (One on One) and Leslie Jordan (Will & Grace). Bialik and Jim Parsons serve as EPs.\n\nWHAT: Based on the BBC sitcom Miranda, the multi-cam follows a 39-year-old woman (Bialik) who struggles every day against society (and her mother) to prove that you can not have everything you want and still be happy. That’s why she spent the money her parents set aside for her wedding to open a cat café in Louisville.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. The hesitancy comes from the lack of a trailer, but there are three reasons why we are motivated to give this one a look-see: it’s based on an established British comedy, so if it can be Americanized in a way that lands with the audiences on this side of the pond, we’re all for giving it a nod; it features Mayim Bialik, a Big Bang Blossom if there ever was one; and who doesn’t want to see a comedy about an owner of a cat cafe? Imagine all the feline hi-jinks! On the other hand, this sitcom could be incredibly stupid, but with Mayim and Jim Parsons, both capable of intelligence and warmth when it comes to comedy, at the helm, we’re thinking this one at least deserves a chance, though you can call me “krazy” if you want.\n\n__\n\nCALL YOUR MOTHER, ABC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Kyra Sedgwick (The Closer), Rachel Sennott (High Maintenance), Joey Bragg (Liv and Maddie), Emma Caymares (Fosse/Verdon), Austin Crute (Daybreak), Patrick Brammall (Evil, No Activity)\n\nWHAT: In this multi-cam, an “empty nester” mom wonders how she ended up alone while her children live their best lives thousands of miles away. She decides her place is with her family and as she re-inserts herself into their lives, her kids realize they might actually need her more than they thought.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. I am sure that Kyra Sedgwick will play a wonderful helicopter mom, but without a trailer or teaser to help seal the deal (likely a scarcity in these COVID circumstances), this new sitcom feels as by rote as most. If buzz or steam picks up when this premieres mid-season, if the TV production schedule remotely stays on track, we could be convinced to reassess, but in the meantime, we’ll just call our mothers.\n\n__\n\nCLARICE, CBS\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Rebecca Breeds (The Originals), Kal Penn (Designated Survivor, House), Michael Cudlitz (The Walking Dead, Southland), Nick Sandow (Orange Is the New Black), Lucca De Oliveira (The Punisher), Devyn A. Tyler (Out of Blue)\n\nWHAT: A deep dive into the untold personal story of brilliant and vulnerable FBI Agent Clarice Starling as she returns to the field in 1993, six months after the events of The Silence of the Lambs.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. Hesitancy, again, derives from a lack of sneak peek, but we have a few super-fans of the The Silence of the Lambs franchise that hang out on our united couch Around the Water Cooler, including of the erstwhile Hannibal. Plus, it will be interesting to see if Rebecca Breeds can evoke memories of the incomparable Jodie Foster, and if Clarice Starling’s back story can be as compelling as Hannibal Lecter’s. Also, the morbid curiosity of seeing how far the makers of this series can plumb the depths of this mythology comes to play here as well. All in all, we feel motivated to say, “Hello, Clarice.”\n\n__\n\nDEBRIS, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Jonathan Tucker (Kingdom), Riann Steele (NCIS: New Orleans), Norbert Leo Butz (Fosse/Verdon, Bloodline)\n\nWHAT: Two agents from two different continents, and two different mindsets, must work together to investigate when wreckage from a destroyed alien spacecraft has mysterious effects on humankind.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. This time, there is less hesitancy because aliens, wreckage, mysterious effects, and a global scope, even if the premise is admittedly thin without further trailer evaluation to guide us. We love our science fiction around here, though, and while a trailer would be helpful, sometimes, you just have to go with what works, even if it could all implode in the end and litter our TV-loving hearts with debris from what was once our trust.\n\n__\n\nTHE EQUALIZER, CBS\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Fall 2020\n\nTIME SLOT: Sundays at 8/7c\n\nWHO: Queen Latifah (Star), Lorraine Toussaint (Orange Is the New Black), Chris Noth (Law & Order, Sex and the City), Liza Lapira (9JKL), Tory Kittles (Colony), Laya DeLeon Hayes (Raven’s Home)\n\nWHAT: The re-imagining of the classic series follows an enigmatic woman with a mysterious background who uses her extensive skills to help those with nowhere else to turn.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. Color me dubiously intrigued. Yours truly, the Chief CP, never watched the original Equalizer but not for lack of wanting. Plus, Queen Latifah is always fun to watch; she is a capable actress who can convincingly provide comedy, drama, a catchy tune, or a few slick bars of the rap that started her career. This is an experiment that could pay off in dividends…or, it could not work spectacularly, since the show is a remake of one with a potentially different tone. I’d say the odds of the potential for success and viewer enjoyment are approximately equalized… I’ll see myself out.\n\n__\n\nFILTHY RICH, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Sept. 21\n\nTIME SLOT: Mondays at 9/8c\n\nWHO: Kim Cattrall (Sex and the City), Gerald McRaney (This Is Us), Aubrey Dollar (Battle Creek), Corey Cott (The Good Fight), Mark L. Young (The Comeback), Aaron Lazar (Quantico)\n\nWHAT: When the patriarch of a mega-rich Southern family (famed for creating a wildly successful Christian television network) dies in a plane crash, his wife and family are stunned to learn that he fathered three illegitimate children, all of whom are written into his will.\n\nTrailer available at Fox’s YouTube Channel.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. In the grand tradition of fare like Dallas and Dynasty (the original, to be sure), Fox offers this new sudsy soap with rich people at the forefront mixed with all the scandal and guilty-pleasure inducing backdrop of televangelism and the antebellum lilts of the South, including the requisite homage to Gone with the Wind. Hilariously, the show is created/produced by the makers of Empire and The Help, so there is a small iota of curiosity to entice here. Plus, the presence of an older but no less fabulous Kim Cattrall, the erstwhile Samantha that oozed Sex in her City, leads this pack. Still, the premise sounds very similar to Fox’s Almost Family, also being introduced this season (see above), with the soap angle to propel it forward into Desperate Housewives and the aforementioned Dallas/Dynasty territories, and so it seems like Fox is throwing the idea of illegitimate children around every chance it can get. We passed on the other one and feel it only fair to pass on this one also, but if you think we need to cover more suds and find this candidate suitable to that purpose, drop us a line.\n\nThis was delayed from the 2019-2020 TV season, and our initial review was written in fall 2019.\n\n__\n\nTHE GREAT NORTH, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: The voices of Nick Offerman, Jenny Slate, Megan Mullally, Paul Rust, Aparna Nancherla, Will Forte, Dulcé Sloan\n\nWHAT: The animated comedy follows the Alaskan adventures of the Tobin family, as single dad Beef does his best to keep his weird bunch of kids close, especially as the artistic dreams of his only daughter, Judy, lead her away from the family fishing boat and into the glamorous world of the local mall.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. Fox is also going hog-wild this year with upping its animation game. Still, this animated entry shows more possibility than other new selections, even without a trailer to more fully and thoroughly evaluate it. First, the voice cast contains one of the funniest married couples on the planet in Nick Offerman and Megan Mullaly, who people might know from shows like Parks & Recreation and Will & Grace, respectively. On top of that, the setting is Alaska, and the premise feels a bit more original and fresh, even as it could also be the cartoon version of Northern Exposure. All of the above is enough to warrant a tiny look-see but no promises from the not-so-great north.\n\nThis was delayed from the 2019-2020 TV season, and our initial review was written in fall 2019.\n\n__\n\nHOUSEBROKEN, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: The voices of Lisa Kudrow, Clea Duvall, Nat Faxon, Sharon Horgan, Will Forte, Tony Hale, Jason Mantzoukas, Sam Richardson, Bresha Webb, Greta Lee\n\nWHAT: The animated comedy explores human dysfunction and neurosis through a group of neighborhood animals who live in the suburbs.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. Fox can’t help itself when producing all of its adult animation; I think the network is more addicted to it than the viewing public, or maybe they are beginning to shop around for the next The Simpsons, since we all know that the clock eventually has to run out for our yellow, Springfield-bound family at some point. Still, in a world besieged by a global pandemic that requires social distancing, animation might become a booming industry in this current TV landscape, since drawing/animating and voice acting can be done in a fairly isolated manner. Either way, the only hesitancy here comes from the fact that it’s a show about anthropomorphic animals being neurotic. Yet, the voice cast listed is stellar; I feel confident that the erstwhile Phoebe from Friends, Madame Kudrow herself, could achieve peak-level neurosis, whatever animal she ends up voicing. Also, several of our resident Couch Potatoes, your Chief among them, follow the Friends when we can. Two thumbs partway up in careful anticipation!\n\n__\n\nTHE KENAN SHOW, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Kenan Thompson (Saturday Night Live), Andy Garcia (Ocean’s Eleven), Punam Patel (Special)\n\nWHAT: The single-camera comedy follows a newly widowed dad determined to be everything for his kids while begrudgingly letting his persistent father-in-law become more involved in their lives.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. While it is about time that Kenan Thompson returns to scripted TV from his long tenure as sketch comedian on Saturday Night Live, and while he is more than deserving of an eponymous comedy, we are not sure that this is the eponymous comedy that is going to keep his career going, unless his biggest fans are the generators of decent ratings to keep this sitcom afloat. This thin premise rings bells echoing My Wife & Kids, or, depending upon Kenan’s delivery, The Bernie Mac Show, but with a Xennial approach to the parental side of this equation. No trailer makes the selling difficult, but if you’re a Kenan Thompson fan and want us to reconsider, send us the messages.\n\nThis was delayed from the 2019-2020 TV season, and our initial review was written in fall 2019.\n\n__\n\nKUNG FU, The CW\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Olivia Liang (Legacies), Jon Prasida (Hiding), Shannon Dang (Sorry for Your Loss), Eddie Liu (Silicon Valley), Tzi Ma (Wu Assassins, The Man In the High Castle), Kheng Hua Tan (Marco Polo), Gavin Stenhouse (9-1-1, Allegiance), Gwendoline Yeo (American Crime)\n\nWHAT: A quarter-life crisis causes a young Chinese-American woman to drop out of college and go on a life-changing journey to an isolated monastery in China. But when she returns to find her hometown overrun with crime and corruption, she uses her martial arts skills and Shaolin values to protect her community and bring criminals to justice… all while searching for the assassin who killed her Shaolin mentor and is now targeting her. Inspired by the original series created by Ed Spielman.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Very Hesitantly Pick Up. The uniqueness and originality of bringing martial arts and associated cultural principles to the small screen inspires this hesitant pick-up, even though a few properties of similar ilk have been popping up here and there on streamers in recent years. This new drama could be riveting, or it could be hokey, but the question, I think, that we really have to seek an answer for here is how many of our Couch Potatoes, Couch Potatoes adjacent, and Couch Potatoes Unite! listeners need a martial arts show in their lives? It is a serialized drama, so the success will probably ride upon how well the cast and the production team can execute everything (as it usually does). A trailer would be helpful, but a slightly fresh twist on an old premise certainly appeals.\n\n__\n\nLAW & ORDER: ORGANIZED CRIME, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Fall 2020\n\nTIME SLOT: Thursdays at 10/9c\n\nWHO: Christopher Meloni (Law & Order: SVU)\n\nWHAT: Elliot Stabler returns to the NYPD to battle organized crime after a devastating personal loss. However, the city and police department have changed dramatically in the decade he’s been away, and he must adapt to a criminal justice system in the midst of its own moment of reckoning. Throughout the series, we will follow Stabler’s journey to find absolution and rebuild his life, while leading a new elite task force that is taking apart the city’s most powerful criminal syndicates one by one.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass For Now. The Law & Order franchise has been suggested for podcast dissection via the CPU! request line, so the return of Elliott Stabler (even this non-procedural loving, non-Law & Order watching viewer knows who he is!) only inspires us to wonder just how many spin-offs our potential L&O panel would want to cover. Given the popularity of SVU, I am guessing all of them. Still, this panel is deep in the planning stages and will require a moderator team. If you want us to get to it faster – or to be a moderator – drop us a line!\n\n__\n\nMR. MAYOR, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Ted Danson (The Good Place), Bobby Moynihan (SNL), Holly Hunter (Top of the Lake, Saving Grace)\n\nWHAT: A single-cam comedy centering around a wealthy businessman (Danson) who runs for mayor of Los Angeles for all the wrong reasons. Once he wins, he has to figure out what he stands for, gain the respect of his staff, and connect with his teenage daughter — all while controlling the coyote population.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. Look. Ted Danson has at least earned a “check it out” sort of watch for his string of good TV, including Cheers and, most recently, The Good Place. And, frankly, I really need more information about these coyotes. A trailer would be so helpful here, but the coyote factor intrigues just about as much as the presence of the erstwhile Sam Malone aka Michael Goodman. This premise could very well flop faster than a fish out of its bowl, but a coyote out of its natural habitat and a smooth-talking Mr. Danson? Keeping an open mind seems wise.\n\n__\n\nNEXT, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Oct. 6\n\nTIME SLOT: Tuesdays at 9/8c\n\nWHO: John Slattery (Mad Men), Eve Harlow (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), Michael Mosley (Sirens), Jason Butler Harner (Ozark), Elizabeth Cappuccino (Jessica Jones), Fernanda Andrade, Aaron Moten, Gerardo Celasco, Evan Whitten\n\nWHAT: A Silicon Valley pioneer discovers that one of his own creations — a powerful A.I. — might spell global catastrophe, and teams up with a cybercrime agent to fight a villain unlike anything we’ve ever seen — one whose greatest weapon against us is ourselves.\n\nTrailer available at the Fox’s YouTube Channel.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. Oh sure, science fiction revolving around sentient artificial intelligence has been done before and has been arguably done to death. From The Terminator to Person of Interest, from 2001: A Space Odyssey (and its sequel, 2010) to Westworld, the world will never want for the fear that robots will someday turn against us, as humans attempt to play God by creating them in the first place. What makes this upcoming series potentially compelling TV is that, first, it is being billed as an event (read: limited) series, giving it a theoretically tight number of episodes within which to tell its story. Second, the culprit AI is a clear homage to Amazon’s Alexa product, which should add an element of real-world suspension of disbelief to this science fiction sub-genre. Plus, John Slattery is always a fun guy to watch on the small screen. Amazon’s already taking over the world – why shouldn’t its calming AI Alexa, named Iliza in this series, do the same and then turn on us all? What would happen if it did? Nothing good can come of this, that’s what we know from stories like it, but the premise and devices used here definitely intrigue the mind around this oft-employed story concept, so much so that we want to know what’s neXt.\n\nThis was delayed from the 2019-2020 TV season, and our initial review was written in fall 2019.\n\n__\n\nTHE REPUBLIC OF SARAH, The CW\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Stella Baker (Tell Me Your Secrets), Luke Mitchell (Blindspot), Megan Follows (Reign), Izabella Alvarez (Westworld), Nia Holloway (Hawaii Five-0), Hope Lauren (Awkward, Supergirl), Landry Bender (Fuller House, Looking for Alaska), Ian Duff (New Amsterdam), Forrest Goodluck (The Miseducation of Cameron Post)\n\nWHAT: Faced with the destruction of her town at the hands of a greedy mining company, rebellious high school teacher Sarah Cooper utilizes an obscure cartographical loophole to declare independence. Now Sarah must lead a young group of misfits as they attempt to start their own country from scratch.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. This reviewer needs a trailer for this one. Though the CW motivates many of our Couch Potatoes’ personal TV-watching choices with the network’s attempts at giving all types of fare a chance, this premise feels a bit hollow and possibly precariously played for farce or pedantically played for social commentary. Without a way to further vet the concept visually, and with a cast that doesn’t, by itself, excite, we are going to leave this one aside, regardless of whatever republic for which it stands. As always, if buzz or steam generates around this new drama (is it a drama?), we will reconsider our position, but for now, we pledge allegiance to other TV.\n\n__\n\nSMALL FORTUNE, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Host Lil Rel Howery\n\nWHAT: Based on the U.K. format, the unscripted series features teams of three friends who compete in the tiniest of challenges for a chance to win big money. From a shrunk down Oval Office (“The Waste Wing”) to a mini Arc de Triomphe (“Arc de Wee-Omph”), each team must prove their skills on playing fields that have been squeezed down to the size of a dollhouse. Challenges will require considerable dexterity and intense focus because with games this small, there’s no room for error as the slightest miscalculation or tremble may result in elimination.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. CPU! does not cover game shows in any of our formats, but as this show is new this year, we’ll keep an eye on it for the duration of the season. I would guess our coverage ranks as far less than even a small fortune, but we like scripted TV better here at CPU!\n\n__\n\nSUPERMAN & LOIS, The CW\n\nPREMIERE DATE: January 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: Tuesdays at 9/8c\n\nWHO: Tyler Hoechlin (Supergirl), Elizabeth Tulloch (Supergirl), Dylan Walsh (Nip/Tuck), Emmanuelle Chriqui (The Passage, Entourage), Erik Valdez (General Hospital), Jordan Elsass (Little Fires Everywhere), Alexander Garfin, Wolé Parks (All American, The Vampire Diaries), Inde Navarrette (13 Reasons Why)\n\nWHAT: The Arrowverse spin-off follows the world’d most famous superhero and comic books’ most famous journalist as they deal with all the stress, pressures and complexities that come with being working parents in today’s society.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Enthusiastically Pick Up. As an Arrowverse spin-off, this is an automatic Pick Up for our CPU! “DCTU Series” panel. Considering that our panel has expressed consistent excitement and appreciation, as well as glowing praise, for each appearance of Tyler Hoechlin and Elizabeth Tulloch in recent Arrowverse mid-season crossovers, I would say that this latest incarnation in the “Superman” annals will probably be at least somewhat popular with our panel of DC enthusiasts, with or without an available trailer. To this we say, up, up, and away!\n\n__\n\nSUPERMARKET SWEEP, ABC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Oct. 18\n\nTIME SLOT: Sundays at 8/7c\n\nWHO: Host Leslie Jones (SNL)\n\nWHAT: The competition show revival follows three teams of two as they battle it out using their grocery shopping skills and knowledge of merchandise to win big cash prizes.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. See the above note about game shows and new TV. (We don’t cover them, except their renewal/cancellation prospects in their first year. Oh wait, I gave it away. Rats).\n\n__\n\nTHAT’S MY JAM, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHAT: Inspired by the musical segments on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the hourlong competition series will be infused with Fallon’s one-of-a-kind comedic style, feel-good energy, and a carousel of his classic and brand-new music-based games, featuring a new group of celebrities each week.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. We also don’t cover variety shows or shows featuring celebrity competition (see also: The Masked Singer). That isn’t to say we won’t be watching. We just won’t be talking about the fact that we’re watching. Though Daniel Radcliffe should get himself a slot on this show. His rendition of “Alphabet Rap” was pretty dope.\n\n__\n\nTRUE STORY, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Hosts Ed Helms (The Office) and Randall Park (Fresh Off the Boat)\n\nWHAT: In the hybrid alternative-scripted series, based on the Australian hit, everyday Americans sit down with Helms and Park to share their most extraordinary and unbelievably true stories for the first time. As the stories unfold, events are humorously brought to life by a star-studded cast of comedians and actors in heightened, dramatized re-enactments of cinematic proportions.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. What is “alternative-scripted?” This sounds like an experiment requiring a review by our resident TV lovers and Couch Potatoes, but I am not sure how we would make it work on our podcast. Change my mind, though, if you disagree. I think it’s got potential, but it also sounds like Whose Line Is It Anyway? crossed with This Is Your Life, so I am on the struggle bus. If you think we should assemble a panel to podcast about it, contact us!\n\n__\n\nWALKER, The CW\n\nPREMIERE DATE: January 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: Thursdays at 8/7c\n\nWHO: Jared Padalecki (Supernatural), Lindsey Morgan (The 100), Keegan Allen (Pretty Little Liars), Mitch Pileggi (Supernatural, The X-Files), Molly Hagan (iZombie, Jane the Virgin), Coby Bell (The Gifted), Jeff Pierre (Once Upon a Time, Beyond)\n\nWHAT: The Walker, Texas Ranger reboot follows Cordell Walker (Padalecki), a widower and father of two with his own moral code, who returns to Austin after being undercover for two years, only to discover there’s harder work to be done at home. He’ll attempt to reconnect with his children, navigate clashes with his family, and find unexpected common ground with his new partner (one of the first women in Texas Rangers history), while growing increasingly suspicious about the circumstances surrounding his wife’s death.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Very Hesitantly Pick Up. I am not sure how many of our viewers and listeners, i.e. our resident Couch Potatoes and Couch Potatoes-adjacent, watched the original Walker, Texas Ranger, starring Chuck Norris. If you did, please comment below. The Chief Couch Potato and author of these annual progress reports never did; westerns aren’t quite in the wheelhouse, and I was never a fan of Master Norris beyond a bemused appreciation of his existence. Yet, Jared Padalecki is/was Sam Winchester, and he’s earned the trust of at least six of us for 15 years. I think it’s worth seeing what he does with the role – he could just elevate it. Or, he could make Chuck Norris cry. Wait, does Chuck Norris cry? Let’s just hope it doesn’t come to tears, or we’ll walk(er) right out the door.\n\nWhat? No? That doesn’t work either? I’ll see myself out again.\n\n__\n\nWEAKEST LINK, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Sept. 28\n\nTIME SLOT: Mondays at 10/9c\n\nWHO: Host Jane Lynch\n\nWHAT: The reboot “will deliver the fast-paced and quick-witted pillars of the original British format created by the BBC with a few modern twists,” per the network. “The hybrid game show sees contestants answer general knowledge questions to bank prize money across multiple rounds. At the end of each round, the contestants vote out who they perceive to be the Weakest Link remaining.”\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. This reboot is the weakest link. Goodbye.\n\n(Look, we love Jane Lynch as much as the next person, but she can’t possibly be nearly as withering as Anne Robinson without sounding like Sue Sylvester. Also, it’s another game show….which is probably the en vogue way to fill empty airing slots when TV production has been shut down for months by a pandemic. You know I’m right.)\n\n__\n\nYOUNG ROCK, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Dwayne Johnson\n\nWHAT: The single-cam comedy chronicles the formative childhood years of Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. The audience for this show is going to have to *really* love the Rock. The Rock is fine. The Rock is nice. The Rock is the voice of Maui in Moana. Do we need a sitcom about his life story? Without a trailer, I’m thinking that the answer is no, but if you think we’re not giving due deference to Mr. Johnson, ring that bell (or, just send us an email, or comment down below).\n\n__\n\nThe following is a link to all premiere dates for shows covered beyond the main networks:\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/feature/tv-premiere-dates\n\nNon-Broadcast Network Pick-Ups\n\nCrossing Swords (Hulu): It’s an animated spoof of “Game of Thrones.” It’s not very well reviewed, but maybe we need the catharsis. Plus, Hulu already renewed it for a second season, so something must be right about it. (Released June 12, 2020)\n\nThe latest stop-motion-animated comedy from the team behind Robot Chicken is a spoof of Game of Thrones (and similar projects) featuring the voices of Nicholas Hoult, Seth Green, Tony Hale, Luke Evans, Adam Pally, and Wendi McClendon-Covey.\n\nLove, Victor (Hulu): It has already been requested for the podcast and may feature as part of a future Pride month series, especially since it was already renewed for a second season. (Released June 17, 2020)\n\nOriginally developed for Disney+ before moving to the more adult-oriented Hulu, this 10-episode spin-off from the 2018 feature film Love, Simon (itself an adaptation of a YA novel by Becky Albertalli) centers on a new character, Victor (Michael Cimino), a gay teen who is adjusting to life in a new city and at a new high school. The film’s star (and titular Simon), Nick Robinson, will narrate the series, and the cast also includes Sophia Bush, James Martinez, and Ana Ortiz.\n\nPerry Mason (HBO): This reboot is critically acclaimed, and though initially billed as a miniseries, it has been renewed for a second season. (Premiered June 21, 2020)\n\nMatthew Rhys (The Americans) stars as the titular criminal defense attorney in this remake of the classic TV drama that aired in various forms, most famously as an Emmy-winning series on CBS from 1957-66 (with Raymond Burr in the title role). HBO’s version is also based on the Los Angeles-set novels and stories by author Erle Stanley Gardner, though the time period is now 1931, when Mason is trying to eke out a living as a private investigator and gets drawn into a case involving a child kidnapping. John Lithgow, Tatiana Maslany, Shea Whigham, Stephen Root, Nate Corddry, Lili Taylor, Robert Patrick, and Juliet Rylance also star.\n\nBrave New World (Peacock): Though the reviews are mixed, why not take a look at a small screen adaptation of a dystopian novel to match our real-life dystopia? The book is a must-read (along with “1984”). (Released July 15, 2020)\n\nAfter a lengthy journey to the small screen that saw the property change networks twice (it was previously intended for Syfy and then USA), this series adaptation of Aldous Huxley’s classic 1932 novel set in a theoretically utopian (but in actuality more dystopian) future London is the highest-profile original show available on the public launch day for Comcast’s new streaming service. (As with other Peacock originals, you’ll need to be a “Premium” member to watch it, though Comcast and Cox cable subscribers will get a free premium subscription.) Harry Lloyd, Jessica Brown Findlay, and Alden Ehrenreich head a cast that also includes Demi Moore, Kylie Bunbury, and Hannah John-Kamen. The adaptation, a co-production with the UK’s Sky, comes from David Wiener, who previously wrote for Homecoming and The Killing.\n\nCursed (Netflix): It’s already been requested for the podcast, and, really, who doesn’t love an alternative take on the Arthurian legend? Though it will be probably be canceled after 2 seasons (who gets that joke?). (Released July 17, 2020)\n\nKatherine Langford stars in a gritty take on the Arthurian legend told from the perspective of Nimue, the Lady of the Lake.\n\nMuppets Now (Disney+): Muppets. Like you have to ask. (Premiered July 31, 2020)\n\nThe first new Muppets title for Disney’s streaming service is a six-episode, short-form “unscripted” series featuring classic Muppets characters. Non-Muppet guest stars include Aubrey Plaza, RuPaul, Linda Cardellini, and Seth Rogen (who, admittedly, might be part Muppet).\n\nStar Trek: Lower Decks (CBS All Access): This is an automatic pick-up for our “Star Trek 50+ Series,” but the critics have not been kind to it, even though CBS has already ordered production on a second season. (Premiered August 6, 2020)\n\nCBS All Access expands its growing Star Trek universe with the first animated series in the franchise in 46 years. Lower Decks comes from Rick and Morty writer Mike McMahan (who also co-created Hulu’s just-debuted Solar Opposites) and centers on a group of low-ranking crew members aboard one of Starfleet’s least-important ships, the U.S.S. Cerritos. (It’s a comedy, in case you were wondering.) The voice cast includes Noel Wells, Jerry O’Connell, Tawny Newsome, Eugene Cordero, Dawnn Lewis, and Jack Quaid. A second season has already been ordered.\n\nLovecraft Country (HBO): This has also been quickly requested for the podcast. With Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams at the helm, and a combination of social commentary as well as historical commentary about notorious racist HP Lovecraft (who also wrote about lovable monsters like Cthulu), this is being described as a must-watch and a must-discuss. (Premiered August 16, 2020)\n\nProducers Jordan Peele and J.J. Abrams join forces for a series adaptation of Matt Ruff’s novel of the same name, an allegorical horror tale set in segregated 1950s America where three Black Americans on a road trip to find a missing person must overcome both human racists and Lovecraftian supernatural forces. Jonathan Majors, Jurnee Smollett, Aunjanue Ellis, Jada Harris, Courtney B. Vance, and Michael Kenneth Williams head the cast.\n\nRaised by Wolves (HBO Max): Science fiction with contributions by Ridley Scott! The “Alien” man himself! (Releases September 3, 2020)\n\nOriginally developed for TNT, this HBO Max original sci-fi series marks the American TV directorial debut for Ridley Scott. He directs the first two episodes of a 10-episode season set on a mysterious planet where androids are tasked with raising human children in a colony that is being torn apart by religious differences. The series comes from screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski (Prisoners) and stars Travis Fimmel (Vikings), Amanda Collin, and Abubakar Salim.\n\nAway (Netflix): Science fiction dreaming of trips to Mars. (Releases September 4, 2020)\n\nJason Katims (Friday Night Lights), Matt Reeves (Felicity), and Andrew Hinderaker (Penny Dreadful) combine for a 10-episode Netflix drama series depicting the first manned mission to Mars, based loosely on a recent Esquire story by Chris Jones. Hilary Swank heads the cast as the astronaut in charge of the year-long international mission, while Josh Charles plays her husband (and NASA engineer) left behind on Earth to care for their teenage daughter. Ed Zwick directs the pilot.\n\nNoughts + Crosses (Peacock): Alternative history stories are popular around here, and the timely social commentary could be ham-fisted, but it could also be a jolt when and where a jolt is needed. (Premieres September 4, 2020)\n\nAmerican premiere of the BBC-produced YA series based on Malorie Blackman’s novel set in the present day of an alternate world where Africa colonized Europe and enslaved its white citizens.\n\nPower Book II: Ghost (Starz): The original “Power” series has been on the request list for sometime, so the possibility of making this a podcast discussion series for CPU! is powerfully high. (Premieres September 6, 2020)\n\nThe first of four planned spinoffs from the recently concluded Starz original series Power stars Mary J. Blige, Method Man, Sherri Saurn, Shane Johnson, Naturi Naughton, and Michael Rainey Jr, and picks up the action just days after the events of the Power finale. Subsequent episodes will air Sundays at 8p.\n\nWoke (Hulu): Lamorne Morris meets a hybrid animated/live action vehicle addressing some timely social commentary; we imagine some of the Winston magic will seep into the proceedings. (Releases September 9, 2020)\n\nLamorne Morris (New Girl) stars in this timely comedy about a Black cartoonist living in San Francisco who has an encounter with cops that changes his life. The semi-autobiographical series from real-life cartoonist Keith Knight (The K Chronicles) mixes some animated sequences with live action. All eight episodes stream today.\n\nJulie and the Phantoms (Netflix): It’s musical and carries with it, at least if the premise synopsis is read right, a slight satricial bend – it could also be Netflix’s answer to “Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist,” but we’ll never know until we try. (Premieres September 10, 2020)\n\nHigh School Musical director Kenny Ortega returns with a new musical series for Netflix about a high school singer who rekindles her love of music after being approached by the ghosts of three dead ’90s pop stars. It’s based on a Brazilian series.\n\nThe Third Day (HBO, Miniseries): The plot premise is confusing yet intriguing and original; plus, there is a fine cast in this British import. Everything kind of makes you want to watch it, including imagining a trailer in your head for this sort of story. (Premieres September 14, 2020)\n\nRescheduled from May 2020. Co-produced by the UK’s Sky, this six-part limited series is divided into two sections: “Summer” and “Winter.” The former tells the story of Sam (Jude Law), who finds himself drawn to a mysterious and isolated island off the British coast whose inhabitants are determined to preserve their traditions “at any cost,” while the latter centers on Helen (Naomie Harris), whose arrival on the same island throws its future into question. Emily Watson, Katherine Waterston, and Paddy Considine also star.\n\nRatched (Netflix): This unlikely “One F"
