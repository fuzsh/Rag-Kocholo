        "text": "It’s that time of year! Call it CPU!’s Holiday Present to you! Or a New Year present! Time to check in on the progress of shows and see which shows are surviving this season and beyond on the major networks and what news shows have been announced for the second half of this strange, pandemically-infused season. Is your show on the list? Did it survive cancellation? Are you keeping your eye out for some good new small screen entertainment? Read below.\n\nThanks to TVLine, Metacritic, and other sources for helping a girl out. Note: this is a compilation of internet research from TV pundits and watchdogs. The information is as accurate as the internet can provide as of the date of this publication.\n\n*Note: with the expansion of CPU!, these initial thoughts are based upon the CPU! Chief’s assessments. As with previous seasons, a growing number of CPU! members may find shows initially passed by the CPU! Chief and choose to review them. CPU! readers will be informed if the show’s status changes regarding coverage as the season progresses through the handy CPU! Progress Reports, and all written reviews will be published!\n\n**Second Note: If you haven’t already figured it out, we measure the TV year from June 1st to May 31st.\n\nB POSITIVE, CBS\n\nTIME SLOT: Thursdays at 8:30/7:30c\n\nWHO: Thomas Middleditch (Silicon Valley), Annaleigh Ashford (Masters of Sex), Sara Rue (Impastor), Kether Donohue (You’re the Worst), Kamryn Kunody\n\nWHAT: A multi-cam comedy about a therapist and newly divorced dad who is faced with finding a kidney donor when he runs into a rough-around-the-edges woman from his past who volunteers her own. Together they form an unlikely bond and begin a journey that will change both of their lives.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Welcome to the 2020-2021 CPU! network pilot review, always full of snark and real talk about upcoming TV from your friendly neighborhood TV podcast, whose business is otherwise unaffected by global pandemics, as we’re too afraid to leave our houses and, therefore, spend an even more inordinate time watching TV! Unite with us (and wear a mask)!\n\nWe start off with a pass because, as earnestly as we support humanity’s giving natures and organ donation when needed, the subject and the slapstick cut of this teaser trailer render us feeling like the topic and the tone of this series don’t quite match, despite a fairly fresh premise to start this situation comedy off reasonably right. Another way of looking at this snap judgment comes down to the idea that if this the best thirty seconds the Eye can provide to sell this sitcom, the humor falls flat quickly, even if spontaneous organ donation is intended to elicit at least a few smiles. We want to “b” into it, positively, but we’re not quite there.\n\nAnd to get this bit of annual flavor out of the way, if buzz and steam and starvation for new network sitcoms in these, our COVID times – or your more direct contact with us via comment on any post, a visit to our guestbook or our social media, or an email to couchpotatoesunitepodcast@gmail.com – convince us to change our minds, which is very easy to do with the right amount of minimal persuasion, we most certainly will! I’m positive!\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Five of eighteen ordered episodes have aired as of the publication of this post, but the pundits, including our favorite TVLine, think renewal possibilities are a safe bet. On December 21, 2020, CBS ordered five additional episodes, elevating the Season 1 episode total to 18. No announcement regarding renewal or cancellation has yet been made.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Early reviews and reception from critics are (B?) positive. Plus, it was CBS’ only new comedy entry during this, our era of COVID, which might be bolstering its survival chances somewhat. Unfortunately, no one is talking to us about it yet, so we’ll stay pretty positive that passing is our best option. We have to prioritize the sheer volume of television entertainment somehow!\n\n__\n\nBIG SKY, ABC\n\nTIME SLOT: Tuesdays at 10/9c\n\nWHO: Kylie Bunbury (Pitch), Katheryn Winnick (Vikings), Ryan Phillippe (Shooter), Brian Geraghty (Chicago P.D.), John Carroll Lynch (American Horror Story), Dedee Pfeiffer (Cybill), Natalie Alyn Lind (The Gifted), Jade Pettyjohn (Little Fires Everywhere), Jesse James Keitel\n\nWHAT: In this procedural thriller, private detective Cassie Dewell (Bunbury) partners with ex-cop Jenny Hoyt (Winnick) on a search for two sisters who have been kidnapped by a truck driver on a remote highway in Montana, but when they discover that these are not the only girls who have disappeared in the area, they must race against the clock to stop the killer before another woman is taken.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Without a trailer to help steer us toward this procedural thriller, I am afraid that we’ll have to steer away. Procedural TV is a genre not typically requested by our resident Couch Potatoes unless the procedural overlay is set off by a gimmick or a quirk that renders it somewhat different from the typical fare. Various vehicles featuring murder and detective work have come and gone in recent seasons; some have been canceled quickly, and though the lead actress is named Kylie (which this Kylie can get behind), we don’t have enough information about either this series premise or its cast to feel motivated to add it to our already as-large-as-the-sky lists of recommended TV. Big facts.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Five of sixteen ordered episodes have aired as of the publication of this post. The pundits also see this series’ renewal chances as being a safe bet or likely. On December 7, 2020, ABC ordered six additional episodes to reach the sixteen-episode total. No announcement regarding renewal or cancellation has yet been made.\n\nCPU! STATUS: The trailer was reviewed and is available by searching YouTube; this series is a procedural but with an overarching dramatic through-line. The creator and cast pedigree are certainly there, and the ratings seem to fare better than average, but I wonder how much the influence of COVID on the TV landscape – and the boom in the streaming industry – are affecting traditional perceptions of network TV? After viewing this trailer, your friendly neighborhood Chief Couch Potato was not any more motivated to watch this seemingly run-of-the-mill crime-solving thriller than I was after I read a mere textual premise. Also, no one is talking about it in CPU!’s increasingly widespread circles of Couch Potatoes and Couch Potatoes Adjacent, and this, of all times, is the time for hunkering in and watching things. The premise is not pie in the big sky, but this particular Alphabet entry feeling new and different from other ilk in its genre seems like a pretty tall order; or, perhaps, the trailer was not well cut (of course, usually, that means there’s not a lot from which to cut). Anyway, we remain in the passing line on the TV highway until we hear requests, same as it ever was, same as it ever was.\n\n__\n\nCALL ME KAT, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: January 3, 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: Sundays at 8/7c\n\nWHO: Mayim Bialik (The Big Bang Theory), Swoosie Kurtz (Mike & Molly), Cheyenne Jackson (American Horror Story), Kyla Pratt (One on One) and Leslie Jordan (Will & Grace). Bialik and Jim Parsons serve as EPs.\n\nWHAT: Based on the BBC sitcom Miranda, the multi-cam follows a 39-year-old woman (Bialik) who struggles every day against society (and her mother) to prove that you can not have everything you want and still be happy. That’s why she spent the money her parents set aside for her wedding to open a cat café in Louisville.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. The hesitancy comes from the lack of a trailer, but there are three reasons why we are motivated to give this one a look-see: it’s based on an established British comedy, so if it can be Americanized in a way that lands with the audiences on this side of the pond, we’re all for giving it a nod; it features Mayim Bialik, a Big Bang Blossom if there ever was one; and who doesn’t want to see a comedy about an owner of a cat cafe? Imagine all the feline hi-jinks! On the other hand, this sitcom could be incredibly stupid, but with Mayim and Jim Parsons, both capable of intelligence and warmth when it comes to comedy, at the helm, we’re thinking this one at least deserves a chance, though you can call me “krazy” if you want.\n\nPANDEMIC EDIT: The trailer has been reviewed. The premise is a little shaky, but the cast is the reason to watch this one, and by cast, I mean those supporting Ms. Bialik. As much as Mayim will bring the sass and apparently a few songs via a karaoke set-up (because why not?), those to watch include Swoosie Kurtz and Leslie Jordan doing what they do best. We are still evaluating Cheyenne Jackson beyond his appearances on American Horror Story and so will need to tune in to get the full sense of the coalescing of this particularly cat-crazy ensemble – but we do not regret our Pick Up decision (yet).\n\n__\n\nCALL YOUR MOTHER, ABC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: January 13, 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: Wednesdays, 9:30/8:30c\n\nWHO: Kyra Sedgwick (The Closer), Rachel Sennott (High Maintenance), Joey Bragg (Liv and Maddie), Emma Caymares (Fosse/Verdon), Austin Crute (Daybreak), Patrick Brammall (Evil, No Activity)\n\nWHAT: In this multi-cam, an “empty nester” mom wonders how she ended up alone while her children live their best lives thousands of miles away. She decides her place is with her family and as she re-inserts herself into their lives, her kids realize they might actually need her more than they thought.\n\nTeaser trailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. I am sure that Kyra Sedgwick will play a wonderful helicopter mom, but without a trailer or teaser to help seal the deal (likely a scarcity in these COVID circumstances), this new sitcom feels as by rote as most. If buzz or steam picks up when this premieres mid-season, if the TV production schedule remotely stays on track, we could be convinced to reassess, but in the meantime, we’ll just call our mothers.\n\nPANDEMIC EDIT: The trailer has been reviewed – and it plays like it reads: as by rote as more than most. Kyra Sedgwick seems potentially winning, but thirty seconds of teasing promotional clips left this CP comfortable with our initial pass. In the end, Kyra’s fans might be most readily drawn into this empty nest sitcom; otherwise, it’s just another family comedy to add to the Alphabet’s already packed schedule full of them.\n\n__\n\nCLARICE, CBS\n\nPREMIERE DATE: February 11, 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: Thursdays at 10/9c\n\nWHO: Rebecca Breeds (The Originals), Kal Penn (Designated Survivor, House), Michael Cudlitz (The Walking Dead, Southland), Nick Sandow (Orange Is the New Black), Lucca De Oliveira (The Punisher), Devyn A. Tyler (Out of Blue)\n\nWHAT: A deep dive into the untold personal story of brilliant and vulnerable FBI Agent Clarice Starling as she returns to the field in 1993, six months after the events of The Silence of the Lambs.\n\nTeaser trailer available at CBS’ YouTube channel.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. Hesitancy, again, derives from a lack of sneak peek, but we have a few super-fans of the The Silence of the Lambs franchise that hang out on our united couch Around the Water Cooler, including of the erstwhile Hannibal. Plus, it will be interesting to see if Rebecca Breeds can evoke memories of the incomparable Jodie Foster, and if Clarice Starling’s back story can be as compelling as Hannibal Lecter’s. Also, the morbid curiosity of seeing how far the makers of this series can plumb the depths of this mythology comes to play here as well. All in all, we feel motivated to say, “Hello, Clarice.”\n\nPANDEMIC EDIT: The trailer has been reviewed – there wasn’t much in the vague teaser to clarify our feelings of hesitancy about Clarice. In fact, it only served to validate our initial hesitancy, but this drama shall remain a Pick Up. After all, we might do a Silence of the Lambs TV Series focused group of podcast episodes, including coverage of Hannibal. We’re always thinking around here! No fava beans or chianti of which to speak, either.\n\n__\n\nDEBRIS, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Jonathan Tucker (Kingdom), Riann Steele (NCIS: New Orleans), Norbert Leo Butz (Fosse/Verdon, Bloodline)\n\nWHAT: Two agents from two different continents, and two different mindsets, must work together to investigate when wreckage from a destroyed alien spacecraft has mysterious effects on humankind.\n\nTrailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. This time, there is less hesitancy because aliens, wreckage, mysterious effects, and a global scope, even if the premise is admittedly thin without further trailer evaluation to guide us. We love our science fiction around here, though, and while a trailer would be helpful, sometimes, you just have to go with what works, even if it could all implode in the end and litter our TV-loving hearts with debris from what was once our trust.\n\nPANDEMIC EDIT: The trailer has been reviewed – and it was very intriguing in all of the glorious science fiction senses that tend to titillate our TV watching tubers. From the trailer, the premise strikes this viewer as both familiar and different, so of course we’ll have to check it out to see which quality this new series displays more. I really should learn to trust my snap judgments, eh?\n\n__\n\nTHE EQUALIZER, CBS\n\nPREMIERE DATE: February 7, 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: Sundays at 8/7c\n\nWHO: Queen Latifah (Star), Lorraine Toussaint (Orange Is the New Black), Chris Noth (Law & Order, Sex and the City), Liza Lapira (9JKL), Tory Kittles (Colony), Laya DeLeon Hayes (Raven’s Home)\n\nWHAT: The re-imagining of the classic series follows an enigmatic woman with a mysterious background who uses her extensive skills to help those with nowhere else to turn.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. Color me dubiously intrigued. Yours truly, the Chief CP, never watched the original Equalizer but not for lack of wanting. Plus, Queen Latifah is always fun to watch; she is a capable actress who can convincingly provide comedy, drama, a catchy tune, or a few slick bars of the rap that started her career. This is an experiment that could pay off in dividends…or, it could not work spectacularly, since the show is a remake of one with a potentially different tone. I’d say the odds of the potential for success and viewer enjoyment are approximately equalized… I’ll see myself out.\n\n__\n\nFILTHY RICH, Fox\n\nWHO: Kim Cattrall (Sex and the City), Gerald McRaney (This Is Us), Aubrey Dollar (Battle Creek), Corey Cott (The Good Fight), Mark L. Young (The Comeback), Aaron Lazar (Quantico)\n\nWHAT: When the patriarch of a mega-rich Southern family (famed for creating a wildly successful Christian television network) dies in a plane crash, his wife and family are stunned to learn that he fathered three illegitimate children, all of whom are written into his will.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. In the grand tradition of fare like Dallas and Dynasty (the original, to be sure), Fox offers this new sudsy soap with rich people at the forefront mixed with all the scandal and guilty-pleasure inducing backdrop of televangelism and the antebellum lilts of the South, including the requisite homage to Gone with the Wind. Hilariously, the show is created/produced by the makers of Empire and The Help, so there is a small iota of curiosity to entice here. Plus, the presence of an older but no less fabulous Kim Cattrall, the erstwhile Samantha that oozed Sex in her City, leads this pack. Still, the premise sounds very similar to Fox’s Almost Family, also being introduced this season (see above), with the soap angle to propel it forward into Desperate Housewives and the aforementioned Dallas/Dynasty territories, and so it seems like Fox is throwing the idea of illegitimate children around every chance it can get. We passed on the other one and feel it only fair to pass on this one also, but if you think we need to cover more suds and find this candidate suitable to that purpose, drop us a line.\n\nThis was delayed from the 2019-2020 TV season, and our initial review was written in fall 2019.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially canceled! On October 30, 2020, Fox canceled this delayed drama citing rising production costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The series finale aired on November 30, 2020, after a total of 10 episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Clearly, this production seemed somewhat doomed from the start, but adding together the individual variables of slightly above average critical reviews, declining ratings over its short run, not to mention a sizable cast with an oft-played premise, there is little wonder that this show did not survive after everything that appeared to plague its path to airing. Plus, CPU! remains uninterested; not even those with the filthiest, guiltiest penchants for this kind of TV mentioned this series once. We can’t say that’s very rich.\n\n__\n\nTHE GREAT NORTH, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: February 14, 2021, with special preview scheduled for January 3, 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: Sundays at 8:30/7:30c\n\nWHO: The voices of Nick Offerman, Jenny Slate, Megan Mullally, Paul Rust, Aparna Nancherla, Will Forte, Dulcé Sloan\n\nWHAT: The animated comedy follows the Alaskan adventures of the Tobin family, as single dad Beef does his best to keep his weird bunch of kids close, especially as the artistic dreams of his only daughter, Judy, lead her away from the family fishing boat and into the glamorous world of the local mall.\n\nTeaser trailer available at Fox’s YouTube Channel.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. Fox is also going hog-wild this year with upping its animation game. Still, this animated entry shows more possibility than other new selections, even without a trailer to more fully and thoroughly evaluate it. First, the voice cast contains one of the funniest married couples on the planet in Nick Offerman and Megan Mullaly, who people might know from shows like Parks & Recreation and Will & Grace, respectively. On top of that, the setting is Alaska, and the premise feels a bit more original and fresh, even as it could also be the cartoon version of Northern Exposure. All of the above is enough to warrant a tiny look-see but no promises from the not-so-great north.\n\nThis was delayed from the 2019-2020 TV season, and our initial review was written in fall 2019.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! Ahead of its premiere, on June 22, 2020, Fox renewed this animated sitcom for a second season. There is no widely publicized word regarding how many episodes have been ordered for either season.\n\nCPU! STATUS: The teaser trailer has been reviewed, but the thirty available seconds were inconclusive. Still, I think it’s a safe bet to say that fans of Bob’s Burgers will probably find something to like about this one. And the stellar voice cast is really why we’re enticed to give The Great North a gander more than a goose, eh?\n\n__\n\nHOUSEBROKEN, Fox\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: The voices of Lisa Kudrow, Clea Duvall, Nat Faxon, Sharon Horgan, Will Forte, Tony Hale, Jason Mantzoukas, Sam Richardson, Bresha Webb, Greta Lee\n\nWHAT: The animated comedy explores human dysfunction and neurosis through a group of neighborhood animals who live in the suburbs.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. Fox can’t help itself when producing all of its adult animation; I think the network is more addicted to it than the viewing public, or maybe they are beginning to shop around for the next The Simpsons, since we all know that the clock eventually has to run out for our yellow, Springfield-bound family at some point. Still, in a world besieged by a global pandemic that requires social distancing, animation might become a booming industry in this current TV landscape, since drawing/animating and voice acting can be done in a fairly isolated manner. Either way, the only hesitancy here comes from the fact that it’s a show about anthropomorphic animals being neurotic. Yet, the voice cast listed is stellar; I feel confident that the erstwhile Phoebe from Friends, Madame Kudrow herself, could achieve peak-level neurosis, whatever animal she ends up voicing. Also, several of our resident Couch Potatoes, your Chief among them, follow the Friends when we can. Two thumbs partway up in careful anticipation!\n\n__\n\nTHE KENAN SHOW, KENAN, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Kenan Thompson (Saturday Night Live), Andy Garcia (Ocean’s Eleven), Punam Patel (Special)\n\nWHAT: The single-camera comedy follows a newly widowed dad determined to be everything for his kids while begrudgingly letting his persistent father-in-law become more involved in their lives.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. While it is about time that Kenan Thompson returns to scripted TV from his long tenure as sketch comedian on Saturday Night Live, and while he is more than deserving of an eponymous comedy, we are not sure that this is the eponymous comedy that is going to keep his career going, unless his biggest fans are the generators of decent ratings to keep this sitcom afloat. This thin premise rings bells echoing My Wife & Kids, or, depending upon Kenan’s delivery, The Bernie Mac Show, but with a Xennial approach to the parental side of this equation. No trailer makes the selling difficult, but if you’re a Kenan Thompson fan and want us to reconsider, send us the messages.\n\nThis was delayed from the 2019-2020 TV season, and our initial review was written in fall 2019.\n\n__\n\nKUNG FU, The CW\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Olivia Liang (Legacies), Jon Prasida (Hiding), Shannon Dang (Sorry for Your Loss), Eddie Liu (Silicon Valley), Tzi Ma (Wu Assassins, The Man In the High Castle), Kheng Hua Tan (Marco Polo), Gavin Stenhouse (9-1-1, Allegiance), Gwendoline Yeo (American Crime)\n\nWHAT: A quarter-life crisis causes a young Chinese-American woman to drop out of college and go on a life-changing journey to an isolated monastery in China. But when she returns to find her hometown overrun with crime and corruption, she uses her martial arts skills and Shaolin values to protect her community and bring criminals to justice… all while searching for the assassin who killed her Shaolin mentor and is now targeting her. Inspired by the original series created by Ed Spielman.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Very Hesitantly Pick Up. The uniqueness and originality of bringing martial arts and associated cultural principles to the small screen inspires this hesitant pick-up, even though a few properties of similar ilk have been popping up here and there on streamers in recent years. This new drama could be riveting, or it could be hokey, but the question, I think, that we really have to seek an answer for here is how many of our Couch Potatoes, Couch Potatoes adjacent, and Couch Potatoes Unite! listeners need a martial arts show in their lives? It is a serialized drama, so the success will probably ride upon how well the cast and the production team can execute everything (as it usually does). A trailer would be helpful, but a slightly fresh twist on an old premise certainly appeals.\n\n__\n\nLAW & ORDER: ORGANIZED CRIME, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: Thursdays at 10/9c\n\nWHO: Christopher Meloni (Law & Order: SVU)\n\nWHAT: Elliot Stabler returns to the NYPD to battle organized crime after a devastating personal loss. However, the city and police department have changed dramatically in the decade he’s been away, and he must adapt to a criminal justice system in the midst of its own moment of reckoning. Throughout the series, we will follow Stabler’s journey to find absolution and rebuild his life, while leading a new elite task force that is taking apart the city’s most powerful criminal syndicates one by one.\n\nTeaser trailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass For Now. The Law & Order franchise has been suggested for podcast dissection via the CPU! request line, so the return of Elliott Stabler (even this non-procedural loving, non-Law & Order watching viewer knows who he is!) only inspires us to wonder just how many spin-offs our potential L&O panel would want to cover. Given the popularity of SVU, I am guessing all of them. Still, this panel is deep in the planning stages and will require a moderator team. If you want us to get to it faster – or to be a moderator – drop us a line!\n\n__\n\nMR. MAYOR, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: January 7, 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: Thursdays, 8/7c\n\nWHO: Ted Danson (The Good Place), Bobby Moynihan (SNL), Holly Hunter (Top of the Lake, Saving Grace)\n\nWHAT: A single-cam comedy centering around a wealthy businessman (Danson) who runs for mayor of Los Angeles for all the wrong reasons. Once he wins, he has to figure out what he stands for, gain the respect of his staff, and connect with his teenage daughter — all while controlling the coyote population.\n\nTrailer available at NBC’s YouTube Channel.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. Look. Ted Danson has at least earned a “check it out” sort of watch for his string of good TV, including Cheers and, most recently, The Good Place. And, frankly, I really need more information about these coyotes. A trailer would be so helpful here, but the coyote factor intrigues just about as much as the presence of the erstwhile Sam Malone aka Michael Goodman. This premise could very well flop faster than a fish out of its bowl, but a coyote out of its natural habitat and a smooth-talking Mr. Danson? Keeping an open mind seems wise.\n\nPANDEMIC EDIT: The trailer has been reviewed. The trailer produces much less hesitancy, owing to the presence of Vella Lovell from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Ted Danson doing his best Ted Danson (somewhere between Sam Malone and Michael the Ex-Demon), and Holly Hunter playing someone seemingly unhinged and totally hilarious with some great potential chemistry with Mr. Mayor Danson. Paired with Tina Fey and Robert Carlock’s eye for quick and zany wit (see also: 30 Rock, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt), and this CP is more excitedly veering toward a solid Pick Up rather than a Hesitant(ly) Pick Up. Like LeVar Burton says, though, you don’t have to take my word for that, Mr. Mayor. Watch the trailer; see for yourself!\n\n__\n\nNEXT, Fox\n\nWHO: John Slattery (Mad Men), Eve Harlow (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), Michael Mosley (Sirens), Jason Butler Harner (Ozark), Elizabeth Cappuccino (Jessica Jones), Fernanda Andrade, Aaron Moten, Gerardo Celasco, Evan Whitten\n\nWHAT: A Silicon Valley pioneer discovers that one of his own creations — a powerful A.I. — might spell global catastrophe, and teams up with a cybercrime agent to fight a villain unlike anything we’ve ever seen — one whose greatest weapon against us is ourselves.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. Oh sure, science fiction revolving around sentient artificial intelligence has been done before and has been arguably done to death. From The Terminator to Person of Interest, from 2001: A Space Odyssey (and its sequel, 2010) to Westworld, the world will never want for the fear that robots will someday turn against us, as humans attempt to play God by creating them in the first place. What makes this upcoming series potentially compelling TV is that, first, it is being billed as an event (read: limited) series, giving it a theoretically tight number of episodes within which to tell its story. Second, the culprit AI is a clear homage to Amazon’s Alexa product, which should add an element of real-world suspension of disbelief to this science fiction sub-genre. Plus, John Slattery is always a fun guy to watch on the small screen. Amazon’s already taking over the world – why shouldn’t its calming AI Alexa, named Iliza in this series, do the same and then turn on us all? What would happen if it did? Nothing good can come of this, that’s what we know from stories like it, but the premise and devices used here definitely intrigue the mind around this oft-employed story concept, so much so that we want to know what’s neXt.\n\nThis was delayed from the 2019-2020 TV season, and our initial review was written in fall 2019.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially canceled! On October 30, 2020, Fox canceled this delayed drama citing rising production costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The series finale aired on December 22, 2020, after a total of 10 episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Critical reception was above average for this one and done series, but it never found an audience. It’s too bad, really, but this CP can’t help but wonder if being cooped up at home for months on end due to a global pandemic, where technology is getting smarter and better, and where one would hope it wouldn’t turn on the people operating it, probably influenced non-interest in this series; after all, sometimes timing is everything in the TV biz. Hoping that it did not end on a cliffhanger, I think CPU! will still take a look someday, if not anytime soon. If you want us to take a look at it faster and voice some feelings, email us at couchpotatoesunitepodcast@gmailcom or get at us on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. It’s the “NEXT” logical course of action, naturally.\n\n__\n\nTHE REPUBLIC OF SARAH, The CW\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Midseason 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Stella Baker (Tell Me Your Secrets), Luke Mitchell (Blindspot), Megan Follows (Reign), Izabella Alvarez (Westworld), Nia Holloway (Hawaii Five-0), Hope Lauren (Awkward, Supergirl), Landry Bender (Fuller House, Looking for Alaska), Ian Duff (New Amsterdam), Forrest Goodluck (The Miseducation of Cameron Post)\n\nWHAT: Faced with the destruction of her town at the hands of a greedy mining company, rebellious high school teacher Sarah Cooper utilizes an obscure cartographical loophole to declare independence. Now Sarah must lead a young group of misfits as they attempt to start their own country from scratch.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. This reviewer needs a trailer for this one. Though the CW motivates many of our Couch Potatoes’ personal TV-watching choices with the network’s attempts at giving all types of fare a chance, this premise feels a bit hollow and possibly precariously played for farce or pedantically played for social commentary. Without a way to further vet the concept visually, and with a cast that doesn’t, by itself, excite, we are going to leave this one aside, regardless of whatever republic for which it stands. As always, if buzz or steam generates around this new drama (is it a drama?), we will reconsider our position, but for now, we pledge allegiance to other TV.\n\n__\n\nSMALL FORTUNE, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Host Lil Rel Howery\n\nWHAT: Based on the U.K. format, the unscripted series features teams of three friends who compete in the tiniest of challenges for a chance to win big money. From a shrunk down Oval Office (“The Waste Wing”) to a mini Arc de Triomphe (“Arc de Wee-Omph”), each team must prove their skills on playing fields that have been squeezed down to the size of a dollhouse. Challenges will require considerable dexterity and intense focus because with games this small, there’s no room for error as the slightest miscalculation or tremble may result in elimination.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. CPU! does not cover game shows in any of our formats, but as this show is new this year, we’ll keep an eye on it for the duration of the season. I would guess our coverage ranks as far less than even a small fortune, but we like scripted TV better here at CPU!\n\n__\n\nSUPERMAN & LOIS, The CW\n\nPREMIERE DATE: February 23, 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: Tuesdays at 9/8c\n\nWHO: Tyler Hoechlin (Supergirl), Elizabeth Tulloch (Supergirl), Dylan Walsh (Nip/Tuck), Emmanuelle Chriqui (The Passage, Entourage), Erik Valdez (General Hospital), Jordan Elsass (Little Fires Everywhere), Alexander Garfin, Wolé Parks (All American, The Vampire Diaries), Inde Navarrette (13 Reasons Why)\n\nWHAT: The Arrowverse spin-off follows the world’d most famous superhero and comic books’ most famous journalist as they deal with all the stress, pressures and complexities that come with being working parents in today’s society.\n\nTeaser trailer available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Enthusiastically Pick Up. As an Arrowverse spin-off, this is an automatic Pick Up for our CPU! “DCTU Series” panel. Considering that our panel has expressed consistent excitement and appreciation, as well as glowing praise, for each appearance of Tyler Hoechlin and Elizabeth Tulloch in recent Arrowverse mid-season crossovers, I would say that this latest incarnation in the “Superman” annals will probably be at least somewhat popular with our panel of DC enthusiasts, with or without an available trailer. To this we say, up, up, and away!\n\nPANDEMIC EDIT: The trailer has been reviewed. IT CHANGES NOTHING! MORE ENTHUSIASM!\n\n__\n\nSUPERMARKET SWEEP, ABC\n\nTIME SLOT: Sundays at 8/7c\n\nWHO: Host Leslie Jones (SNL)\n\nWHAT: The competition show revival follows three teams of two as they battle it out using their grocery shopping skills and knowledge of merchandise to win big cash prizes.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. See the above note about game shows and new TV. (We don’t cover them, except their renewal/cancellation prospects in their first year. Oh wait, I gave it away. Rats).\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Eight episodes have aired as of the publication of this post.

We also don’t cover variety shows or shows featuring celebrity competition (see also: The Masked Singer). That isn’t to say we won’t be watching. We just won’t be talking about the fact that we’re watching. Though Daniel Radcliffe should get himself a slot on this show. His rendition of “Alphabet Rap” was pretty dope.\n\n__\n\nTRUE STORY, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Hosts Ed Helms (The Office) and Randall Park (Fresh Off the Boat)\n\nWHAT: In the hybrid alternative-scripted series, based on the Australian hit, everyday Americans sit down with Helms and Park to share their most extraordinary and unbelievably true stories for the first time. As the stories unfold, events are humorously brought to life by a star-studded cast of comedians and actors in heightened, dramatized re-enactments of cinematic proportions.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. What is “alternative-scripted?” This sounds like an experiment requiring a review by our resident TV lovers and Couch Potatoes, but I am not sure how we would make it work on our podcast. Change my mind, though, if you disagree. I think it’s got potential, but it also sounds like Whose Line Is It Anyway? crossed with This Is Your Life, so I am on the struggle bus. If you think we should assemble a panel to podcast about it, contact us!\n\n__\n\nWALKER, The CW\n\nPREMIERE DATE: January 21, 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: Thursdays at 8/7c\n\nWHO: Jared Padalecki (Supernatural), Lindsey Morgan (The 100), Keegan Allen (Pretty Little Liars), Mitch Pileggi (Supernatural, The X-Files), Molly Hagan (iZombie, Jane the Virgin), Coby Bell (The Gifted), Jeff Pierre (Once Upon a Time, Beyond)\n\nWHAT: The Walker, Texas Ranger reboot follows Cordell Walker (Padalecki), a widower and father of two with his own moral code, who returns to Austin after being undercover for two years, only to discover there’s harder work to be done at home. He’ll attempt to reconnect with his children, navigate clashes with his family, and find unexpected common ground with his new partner (one of the first women in Texas Rangers history), while growing increasingly suspicious about the circumstances surrounding his wife’s death.\n\nTeaser available here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Very Hesitantly Pick Up. I am not sure how many of our viewers and listeners, i.e. our resident Couch Potatoes and Couch Potatoes-adjacent, watched the original Walker, Texas Ranger, starring Chuck Norris. If you did, please comment below. The Chief Couch Potato and author of these annual progress reports never did; westerns aren’t quite in the wheelhouse, and I was never a fan of Master Norris beyond a bemused appreciation of his existence. Yet, Jared Padalecki is/was Sam Winchester, and he’s earned the trust of at least six of us for 15 years. I think it’s worth seeing what he does with the role – he could just elevate it. Or, he could make Chuck Norris cry. Wait, does Chuck Norris cry? Let’s just hope it doesn’t come to tears, or we’ll walk(er) right out the door.\n\nWhat? No? That doesn’t work either? I’ll see myself out again.\n\nPANDEMIC EDIT: The teaser has been reviewed. Meh. It does not provide much in the way of any kind of information that could not be gleaned from a simple knowledge of anything having to do with “Walker” and “Texas Ranger.” Still, JarPad is in it, and after years of stellar reliability on Supernatural and Gilmore Girls, he deserves at least one watch for fair chance’s and judgment’s sake (and in this CP’s opinion, he’s far more easy on the eyes than Chuck Norris, but to each their own).\n\n__\n\nWEAKEST LINK, NBC\n\nTIME SLOT: Mondays at 10/9c\n\nWHO: Host Jane Lynch\n\nWHAT: The reboot “will deliver the fast-paced and quick-witted pillars of the original British format created by the BBC with a few modern twists,” per the network. “The hybrid game show sees contestants answer general knowledge questions to bank prize money across multiple rounds. At the end of each round, the contestants vote out who they perceive to be the Weakest Link remaining.”\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. This reboot is the weakest link. Goodbye.\n\n(Look, we love Jane Lynch as much as the next person, but she can’t possibly be nearly as withering as Anne Robinson without sounding like Sue Sylvester. Also, it’s another game show….which is probably the en vogue way to fill empty airing slots when TV production has been shut down for months by a pandemic. You know I’m right.)\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Ten episodes have aired as of the publication of this post. There is no widely publicized word regarding how many episodes have been ordered nor has an announcement yet been made regarding renewal or cancellation.\n\nCPU! STATUS: It’s still the weakest link (and a game show). Goodbye.\n\n__\n\nYOUNG ROCK, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: TBA\n\nWHO: Dwayne Johnson\n\nWHAT: The single-cam comedy chronicles the formative childhood years of Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. The audience for this show is going to have to *really* love the Rock. The Rock is fine. The Rock is nice. The Rock is the voice of Maui in Moana. Do we need a sitcom about his life story? Without a trailer, I’m thinking that the answer is no, but if you think we’re not giving due deference to Mr. Johnson, ring that bell (or, just send us an email, or comment down below).\n\n__\n\nCONNECTING, NBC\n\nWHO: Parvesh Cheena, Keith Powell\n\nWHAT: Set against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the series follows the lives of a group of friends who try to stay connected via videotelephony as they navigate through the various nuances of life in a lockdown.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. This “COVID era” series was announced late and canceled too quickly to be enticing; plus, Toofer from 30 Rock is the only familiar presence, as delightful a presence as he might be. It’s not even worth the look, given how quickly NBC tossed it from the main network lineup to its streaming outlets.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially canceled! In November 2020, NBC canceled this new entry and burned off remaining episodes on Peacock and the NBC streaming apps. The series finale aired on November 16, 2020, after a total of eight episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: The reviews were generally favorable, but the audience was decidedly anemic, and it’s fairly obvious why. In a pandemic-driven quarantine/isolation/shutdown/slowed world order due to a contagious virus, people want to go to there, i.e. TV, for escape, not to watch a Zoom or equivalent conversation play out on their television screens. THAT’S WHAT WE’RE DOING RIGHT NOW EVERYDAY – those who work in offices, education, and similar, anyway. Too soon, Peacock Party, too soon.\n\n__\n\nTRICKSTER, CW\n\nPREMIERE DATE: January 12, 2021\n\nTIME SLOT: Tuesdays at 9/8c\n\nWHO: Joel Oulette\n\nWHAT: A Canadian series adaptation of Eden Robinson’s supernatural novel Son of a Trickster.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. A preview of a trailer shows a somewhat solid supernatural premise situated within Canadian indigenous cultures. The series is short and is being given American network treatment in a time of COVID, so we’re always happy to dip into horror/fantasy waters, even if it’s just a test.\n\n__\n\nThe following is a link to all premiere dates for shows covered beyond the main networks:\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/feature/tv-premiere-dates\n\nNon-Broadcast Network Pick-Ups\n\nCrossing Swords (Hulu): It’s an animated spoof of “Game of Thrones.” It’s not very well reviewed, but maybe we need the catharsis. Plus, Hulu already renewed it for a second season, so something must be right about it. (Released June 12, 2020)\n\nThe latest stop-motion-animated comedy from the team behind Robot Chicken is a spoof of Game of Thrones (and similar projects) featuring the voices of Nicholas Hoult, Seth Green, Tony Hale, Luke Evans, Adam Pally, and Wendi McClendon-Covey.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! Hulu renewed this animated spoof on June 18, 2020. The Season 1 finale was released on December 21, 2020, with a total of ten episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Not yet viewed.\n\n__\n\nLove, Victor (Hulu): It has already been requested for the podcast and may feature as part of a future Pride month series, especially since it was already renewed for a second season. (Released June 17, 2020)\n\nOriginally developed for Disney+ before moving to the more adult-oriented Hulu, this 10-episode spin-off from the 2018 feature film Love, Simon (itself an adaptation of a YA novel by Becky Albertalli) centers on a new character, Victor (Michael Cimino), a gay teen who is adjusting to life in a new city and at a new high school. The film’s star (and titular Simon), Nick Robinson, will narrate the series, and the cast also includes Sophia Bush, James Martinez, and Ana Ortiz.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2!

(Premiered June 21, 2020)\n\nMatthew Rhys (The Americans) stars as the titular criminal defense attorney in this remake of the classic TV drama that aired in various forms, most famously as an Emmy-winning series on CBS from 1957-66 (with Raymond Burr in the title role). HBO’s version is also based on the Los Angeles-set novels and stories by author Erle Stanley Gardner, though the time period is now 1931, when Mason is trying to eke out a living as a private investigator and gets drawn into a case involving a child kidnapping. John Lithgow, Tatiana Maslany, Shea Whigham, Stephen Root, Nate Corddry, Lili Taylor, Robert Patrick, and Juliet Rylance also star.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2!

The book is a must-read (along with “1984”). (Released July 15, 2020)\n\nAfter a lengthy journey to the small screen that saw the property change networks twice (it was previously intended for Syfy and then USA), this series adaptation of Aldous Huxley’s classic 1932 novel set in a theoretically utopian (but in actuality more dystopian) future London is the highest-profile original show available on the public launch day for Comcast’s new streaming service. (As with other Peacock originals, you’ll need to be a “Premium” member to watch it, though Comcast and Cox cable subscribers will get a free premium subscription.) Harry Lloyd, Jessica Brown Findlay, and Alden Ehrenreich head a cast that also includes Demi Moore, Kylie Bunbury, and Hannah John-Kamen. The adaptation, a co-production with the UK’s Sky, comes from David Wiener, who previously wrote for Homecoming and The Killing.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially canceled! NBC canceled this adaptation in October 2020. The entire series was released on July 15, 2020, with a total of nine episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Critical reception was middling to below average for this one and done series; audience reception is difficult to gauge, since it appeared on Peacock. I believe that this series suffered from the same general barriers as Fox’s NEXT: the globe is already cooped up at home for months on end due to a global pandemic, where technology is getting smarter and better, and where everything feels modestly apocalyptic and somewhat totalitarian in a socio-political context. The book is important, however, despite some of its problematic contextual themes arising from the time period in which it was written; hoping that it did not end on a cliffhanger, and knowing the end of the novel, I think CPU! will still take a look someday, if not anytime soon.

Non-Muppet guest stars include Aubrey Plaza, RuPaul, Linda Cardellini, and Seth Rogen (who, admittedly, might be part Muppet).\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: The Season 1 finale aired on September 4, 2020, with a total of six episodes.

(Premiered August 6, 2020)\n\nCBS All Access expands its growing Star Trek universe with the first animated series in the franchise in 46 years. Lower Decks comes from Rick and Morty writer Mike McMahan (who also co-created Hulu’s just-debuted Solar Opposites) and centers on a group of low-ranking crew members aboard one of Starfleet’s least-important ships, the U.S.S. Cerritos. (It’s a comedy, in case you were wondering.) The voice cast includes Noel Wells, Jerry O’Connell, Tawny Newsome, Eugene Cordero, Dawnn Lewis, and Jack Quaid.

With Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams at the helm, and a combination of social commentary as well as historical commentary about notorious racist HP Lovecraft (who also wrote about lovable monsters like Cthulu), this is being described as a must-watch and a must-discuss. (Premiered August 16, 2020)\n\nProducers Jordan Peele and J.J.

Co-produced by the UK’s Sky, this six-part limited series is divided into two sections: “Summer” and “Winter.” The former tells the story of Sam (Jude Law), who finds himself drawn to a mysterious and isolated island off the British coast whose inhabitants are determined to preserve their traditions “at any cost,” while the latter centers on Helen (Naomie Harris), whose arrival on the same island throws its future into question. Emily Watson, Katherine Waterston, and Paddy Considine also star.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: The series finale aired on October 19, 2020, with a total of six episodes and one intervening special.

Plus, it’s already been renewed for a second season… (Releases September 18, 2020)\n\nAlready renewed for a second season, the latest Netflix series from Ryan Murphy serves as a prequel to the 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (and Ken Kesey’s novel), with Sarah Paulson starring as a younger version of the character Nurse Mildred Ratched (a role originated by Oscar-winner Louise Fletcher in the movie). The creepy 1947-set drama also stars Cynthia Nixon, Judy Davis, Sharon Stone, Corey Stoll, Finn Wittrock, and Vincent D’Onofrio.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2!

I’m guessing it’s a Utopian choice. (Releases September 25, 2020)\n\nThis long-gestating conspiracy thriller—an adaptation of a 2013 UK series that was first developed for HBO as a David Fincher project beginning in 2014, only for the network and the director to drop out over budget concerns—comes from author Gillian Flynn (Gone Girl), who also serves as showrunner. The story revolves around a group of obsessive comic book fans who find themselves targeted by a shadowy government organization after they gain possession of an underground graphic novel that depicts a conspiracy that may not be entirely fictional. John Cusack, Sasha Lane, Rainn Wilson, Dan Byrd, Desmin Borges, and Jessica Rothe star.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially canceled! Amazon canceled this complex thriller in November 2020. Season 1 was released on September 25, 2020, with a total of eight episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Critical reception ran in the middle to below average for this one and done series; audience reception is difficult to gauge, since it appeared on Amazon Prime. The consensus of opinion noted the violence and the timing of dealing with governmental conspiracy in an era where the effectiveness of operating governments is seriously in question, in the USA and beyond. Still, some of our resident Couch Potatoes mentioned this one positively (while also referring to the ample gore), so, though in no hurry to do so, I think CPU! will still take a look someday, if not anytime soon.

Richard Dormer, Lara Rossi, Wendell Pierce, and Matt Berry are among the stars. Various versions of the series have been in and out of production for most of the past decade, and fans of the books have been discouraged by the BBC’s early marketing attempts (which suggested to some that the series will deviate in both tone and content from Pratchett’s work).\n\n__\n\nWandaVision (Disney+): This long anticipated first of the MCU television train on Disney+ has been on the CPU! watch list for a bit; plus, we have a few resident podcasters already salivating over the whole schedule – if you want to be on any Disney+ MCU panels (or Star Wars panels), speak quickly! (Premieres January 15, 2021)\n\nDisney+’s first (of many) series set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the massively budgeted WandaVision is also the most unusual Marvel series to date. Centering on the characters of Wanda/Scarlet Witch and Vision (played by Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany, reprising their big-screen roles), the six-episode series takes a self-aware approach by cycling the pair through different decades of the recent past, forcing them to adapt to a variety of classic TV tropes along the way. (Today’s 1950s-set opener, for example, was filmed in black-and-white with vintage equipment and utilizes a live studio audience to emulate the feel of an early sitcom, while a future episode will embrace the mockumentary style of The Office.)

Time to check in on the progress of shows and see which shows are surviving this season and beyond on the major networks. Is your show on the list? Did it survive cancellation? Read below.\n\nThanks to TVLine and other sources for helping a girl out.\n\n*Note: with the expansion of CPU!, these initial thoughts are based upon the CPU! Chief’s assessments. As with last season, a growing number of CPU! members may find shows initially passed by the CPU! Chief and choose to review them. CPU! readers will be informed if the show’s status changes regarding coverage as the season progresses through the handy CPU! Progress Reports, and all written reviews will be published!\n\nAlso, in another noteworthy TV year, the networks have proven slow to cancel, while the streamers, particularly Netflix, have been quite merciless with some of the cuts. Let’s see how it all shakes out in the wash.\n\nA MILLION LITTLE THINGS, ABC\n\nWHEN: Wednesdays at 10/9c\n\nWHO: James Roday (Psych), David Giuntoli (Grimm), Romany Malco (Weeds), Ron Livingston (Sex and the City), Christina Moses (The Originals), Christina Ochoa (Valor, Blood Drive), Allison Miller (Incorporated, Go On), Stephanie Szostak (Satisfaction), Lizzy Greene (Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn), Grace Park (Hawaii Five-0)\n\nWHAT: They say friendship isn’t one big thing, it’s a million little things; and that’s true for a group of friends from Boston who bonded under unexpected circumstances. Some have achieved success, others are struggling in their careers and relationships, but all of them feel stuck in life. After one of them dies unexpectedly, it’s just the wake-up call the others need to finally start living. Along the way they discover that friends may be the one thing to save them from themselves.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. Welcome to the 2018-2019 CPU! network pilot review! We start off on a strong note, with a pick up for this drama from ABC, but also with a guilty admission by your Chief CP (author of these annual reviews). Honestly, I’m personally most interested in David Giuntoli and everything about him – outside of a Grimm context, that is – more than I am interested in the basic premise of this plot. I think this is the Alphabet’s attempt at an answer to ratings juggernaut and NBC success This Is Us; on the other hand, the cast seems strong. Watching these two minutes also inspires some The Big Chill nostalgia with a modern, Millennial set of characters at the forefront, dealing with the evolution and metamorphosis of friendships into adulthood. That idea, punctuated by the suicide that starts the series off, connects strongly with this viewer, and I can see some of our other Couch Potatoes also finding some interest in and connection to it. The trailer left me feeling hopeful for the series, at any rate, so let’s give this one a try, our first pick up for the year. Hooray for good signs and strong starts!\n\nSTATUS: On October 26, 2018, the network ordered a full season of 17 episodes, of which 10 have aired as of the publication date of this post. The pundits think renewal is a “safe bet” or “very likely” as a result of this show of support and modestly decent ratings.\n\nCPU! STATUS: The podcast has received at least one request for coverage of this program, so this pick up is definite and permanent. Not yet viewed.\n\n—\n\nABBY’S, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: Spring 2019\n\nWHO: Natalie Morales (Parks and Recreation), Neil Flynn (The Middle), Nelson Franklin (Veep), Jessica Chaffin (Search Party), Leonard Ouzts (Master of None), Kimia Behpoornia (Modern Family, Adam Ruins Everything)\n\nWHAT: Set in the best bar in San Diego, home to good prices, great company and, of course, Abby. This unlicensed, makeshift bar nestled in her backyard is the opposite of everything annoying about today’s party scene. As the oddball cast of regulars will tell you, hanging out at Abby’s is a coveted honor. But once you’re in, you’re family.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. Without a trailer, this viewer is reluctant to get enthusiastically on board, but two things convinced me to take a look: it’s produced by Michael Schur – creator of The Good Place and Mose Schrute on The Office – and it’s filmed entirely outside. Though it feels very Cheers-esque, with a female barkeep knowing everyone’s name, early upfront reviews seemed hopeful, so it’s worth a look. A quick one, anyway.\n\n—\n\nTHE ALEC BALDWIN SHOW, ABC\n\nWHEN: Sundays at 10/9c\n\nWHAT: The one-hour talker will showcase Baldwin’s in-depth conversations with compelling personalities.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. The CPU! podcast does not talk about talk shows. How do you feel about Alec Baldwin at the helm of a prime time talk show?\n\nSTATUS: In March 2018, the network ordered nine episodes, of which eight have aired as of the publication date of this post. The pundits believe renewal is a “long shot” or “very unlikely,” particularly given some legal troubles that titular talker Alec Baldwin has faced in recent months.\n\nCPU! STATUS: It’s still a talk show, right? We’ll cover it for this season in this Progress Report format only, however.\n\n—\n\nALL AMERICAN, The CW\n\nWHEN: Wednesdays at 9/8c\n\nWHO: Daniel Ezra (The Missing), Taye Diggs (Private Practice), Cody Christian (Teen Wolf), Samantha Logan (13 Reasons Why), Monet Mazur (Castle), Karimah Westbrook (Shameless, Aquarius), Michael Evans Behling\n\nWHAT: When a rising high school football player from South L.A. is recruited to play for Beverly Hills High, the wins, losses and struggles of two families from vastly different worlds — Crenshaw and Beverly Hills — begin to collide. Inspired by the life of pro football player Spencer Paysinger.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Despite the presence of always gorgeous Taye Diggs, this sports-ball drama feels incredibly trope-y, including hashed and rehashed concepts of several TV and film properties past: poor, urban kid of color finding himself in a rich, largely white district; the story about a kid who has nothing but talent, heart, and a bit of luck with the offer to test his prowess on a suburban high school football team; and so on. The trailer does not “wow” in its presentation of these recycled story concepts, and none of the actors apart from Diggs inspire confidence that this property will offer stellar production value beyond the typical good looks of a made-for-the-CW cast. Plus, our current roster of Couch Potatoes has currently and definitely shied away from TV about sports. Seriously, way more nerd types and way less jock types populate our own ever-growing cast. If you want to change that, though, please drop us a line.\n\nSTATUS: The network, in a cautious fashion, ordered a full season of 16 episodes, of which 8 have aired as of the publication date of this post. The pundits give 50/50 odds to the possibility of renewal.\n\nCPU! STATUS: We have heard zero buzz about this loosely-biographical sports-ball program. Are you buzzing in an “All-American” way – or is it just Taye Diggs’ abs? Let us know. For now, we stay in the passing lane.\n\n—\n\nCHARMED, The CW\n\nWHEN: Sundays at 9/8c\n\nWHO: Sarah Jeffery (Shades of Blue), Melonie Diaz (The Breaks), Madeleine Mantock (The Tomorrow People), Rupert Evans (Man in the High Castle), Ser’Darius Blain (Survivor’s Remorse, Jane by Design), Charlie Gillespie (Degrassi: Next Class), Ellen Tamaki\n\nWHAT: After the tragic death of their mother, three sisters in a college town are stunned to discover they are witches. Soon this powerful threesome must stand together to fight the everyday and supernatural battles that all modern witches must face: from vanquishing powerful demons to toppling the patriarchy.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Very Hesitantly Pick Up. Networks: “What do we want?” Answering themselves: “More reboots!” “When do we want them?” “Now! Because we literally have no other ideas!” Charmed, the original starring Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano, and later Rose McGowan, was a WB staple for eight seasons, now airs frequently in syndication, and enjoys a healthy streaming afterlife. Charmed has already been requested as a possible “Looking Back” candidate for the podcast because its loyal fan base endures to this day. Charmed was a show that this viewer watched voraciously and enthusiastically in its original run. It was a bit cheesy at times and occasionally suffered from the mismatch of acting talent among the women playing the Halliwell/Matthews sisters, but it was reliable, interesting, and sort of kooky in an entertaining way for a long time. Like all the other major networks and some streaming outlets, WB offspring The CW could not wait to look into past properties for its own go at a rebooted show from an earlier success, so here, we have Charmed Redux with a new set of sisters exercising a new era of The Power of Three. I can’t help feeling that this reboot is near blasphemy at its core, given that the original was pretty well loved and still enjoys a loyal, continuing fan devotion. Plus, the actresses playing the sisters are nowhere near equal to the four who played the Halliwells/Matthews, even if the original four could not be described as amazing performers themselves. This reboot also seems to be an even darker take, with mom’s death being characterized as outright murder from the jump. Still, sheer morbid curiosity, a love of fantasy (and supernatural fantasy to boot), and a “can’t look away” feeling propel me to say that CPU! has little choice but to pick this up. Though you better bet that this will be a “Look Back to Look Forward” setup, and that the two versions of the series will be hotly compared and contrasted by feisty and spicy Couch Potatoes. Mark my words, gentle reader: the Power of Three may not set you free.\n\nSTATUS: On November 8, 2018, the network ordered a full season of 22 episodes, of which 9 have aired as of the publication date of this post. The pundits think renewal chances hover at 50 percent, however.\n\nCPU! STATUS: The podcast has received requests from Viewers Like You as well as some of our resident panelists to cover Charmed in a “Look Back to Look Forward” series, as I expected would likely happen. Expect a CPU! trademark look at Charmed and its varied and sorted history in the spring or summer of 2019. Otherwise, not yet viewed.\n\n—\n\nTHE CODE, CBS\n\nPREMIERE DATE: TBA\n\nWHEN: Midseason\n\nWHO: Anna Wood (Falling Water, Reckless), Ato Essandoh (Chicago Med), Phillipa Soo (Broadway’sHamilton), Raffi Barsoumian (The Vampire Diaries)\n\nWHAT: The military’s brightest minds take on our country’s toughest challenges, inside the courtroom and out, where each attorney is trained as a prosecutor, a defense lawyer, an investigator — and a Marine.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. There is no trailer, and there is scant information available for this drama, which, mind you, is a military drama and a seeming holdover from the rash of military dramas that debuted last season on the networks, most of which were ultimately canceled. Plus, Mira Sorvino was attached to this program as its lead for awhile before leaving the role, which is not typically a great sign, and there is very little to be excited about when reviewing the cast list or plot synopsis, so we’ll leave this code non-cracked this season.\n\n—\n\nTHE CONNERS, ABC\n\nWHEN: Tuesdays at 8/7c\n\nWHO: John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, Sara Gilbert, Lecy Goranson, Michael Fishman\n\nWHAT: In the Roseanne spinoff, the Conners are forced to face the daily struggles of life in Lanford in a way they never have before after a sudden turn of events. The iconic family — Dan, Jackie, Darlene, Becky and D.J. — grapples with parenthood, dating, an unexpected pregnancy, financial pressures, aging and in-laws in working-class America. Through it all, the fights, the coupon cutting, the hand-me-downs, the breakdowns — with love, humor and perseverance, the family prevails.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Very Hesitantly Pick Up. Last season, CPU! picked up the Roseanne revival based on the fact that several of our Couch Potatoes, the Chief among them, enjoyed the original series, more or less, and were curious to see how this particular family would weather the reboot/revival treatment. Though many of us have not yet watched, the ratings seemed to speak for themselves – but then so did Roseanne Barr via her Twitter account. All politics aside, Roseanne has always been an “x” factor, erratic and sometimes harmful to the public in how she has chosen to wield her influence, but no one can deny that Roseanne would not have been what it was without her. Now, in a move that sounds, smells, and tastes a bit like “cash grab,” notwithstanding the advocacy for the jobs of those that would otherwise not have had them without Roseanne’s poor life choices (and prejudicial views) mucking up the works, the Alphabet is moving forward with what would ultimately be a spin-off, sans the titular matriarch. On the one hand, it could be compelling: the rest of the cast are no slouches, especially Laurie Metcalf, and the character of Darlene, particularly, has always served as an interesting focal point for the show. On the other hand, if the writers don’t hit this one out of the park straight from the dugout, it will not survive all of this melee and ado and will become a truly unfortunate, if not tragic footnote in entertainment history. The real question is: would this footnote be any more unfortunate or tragic than the original ending, including Dan’s purported death following the family winning the lottery? CPU! is willing to bet probably not, and we believe the network sees this whole game playing out the same way, so, in the end, we’re left asking “why not?” Again, it could also be sheer morbid curiosity. Time, and the rest of the Conners, will tell.\n\nSTATUS: The network ordered a season of 11 episodes, of which 8 have aired as of the publication date of this post. The pundits think renewal is a “sure thing” or “all but guaranteed,” as it was widely reported that ABC has entered into renewal negotiations with the show’s producers as of October 2018, and as the spin-off/sequel enjoys the network’s second highest ratings after Grey’s Anatomy.\n\nCPU! STATUS: The interest in the various iterations of Roseanne and her family has been mild, but there is interest. CPU! will cover all iterations at some point, though it may be later rather than sooner. Otherwise, not yet viewed.\n\n—\n\nTHE COOL KIDS, Fox\n\nWHEN: Fridays at 8:30/7:30c\n\nWHO: Vicki Lawrence (Great News, Mama’s Family), David Alan Grier (The Carmichael Show), Leslie Jordan (Will & Grace), Martin Mull (Roseanne)\n\nWHAT: Three guy friends in a retirement community are the top dogs until they’re blown out of the water by the newest member of the community, a female rebel whose ready to challenge their place.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Very Hesitantly Pick Up. To cut to the chase, if it wasn’t for this cast, I am not willing to bet that either this viewer or fellow potential panelists would find this sitcom premise potentially amusing. Most of us are not in the target audience, and there are some very flat moments in this trailer that should have offered more and better laughs with the players in this cast. But, holy wow, look at this cast! Vicki Lawrence! Leslie Jordan! David Alan Grier! And the erstwhile Colonel Mustard himself, Martin Mull! They’re charming, they’re funny, they’re veterans – but do they have chemistry, and can a sitcom about residents of a retirement community be potentially appealing to the average and/or typical listeners of podcasts? The conundrum we face here is why we are so hesitant to be as totally cool as these alleged kids.\n\nSTATUS: On October 19, 2018, the network ordered a full season of 22 episodes, of which 9 have aired as of the publication date of this post. The pundits think there is a “safe bet” that the show will be renewed.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Not yet viewed.\n\n—\n\nDANCING WITH THE STARS: JUNIORS, ABC\n\nWHAT: The offshoot will pair celebrity kids with professional junior ballroom dancers to perform choreographed routines, which will be judged by a panel that will include renowned ballroom experts.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. CPU! does not dance along with reality competition shows on our podcast, at least for now. But, this one’s new this year, so we list it. Godspeed, DWTS fans!\n\nSTATUS: The Season 1 finale aired on December 9, 2018, after a total of 9 episodes. There is no word yet as to whether this DTWS offshoot will be renewed, but the pundits say “long shot” or “very unlikely.”\n\nCPU! STATUS: It’s still a reality competition show, right? Still, we’ll track it for its first year. It’s what we do. (Also, how many reality game shows do we really need?)\n\n—\n\nTHE ENEMY WITHIN, NBC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: February 25, 2019\n\nWHO: Jennifer Carpenter (Dexter), Morris Chestnut (Rosewood), Raza Jaffrey (Code Black), Kelli Garner (Pan Am)\n\nWHAT: In spy-hunting thriller, Erica Shepherd is a brilliant former CIA operative, now known as the most notorious traitor in American history serving life in a Supermax prison. Against every fiber of his being but with nowhere else to turn, FBI Agent Will Keaton enlists Shepherd to help track down a fiercely dangerous and elusive criminal she knows all too well.\n\nWatch trailer here.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Despite the presence of gorgeous Morris Chestnut, and even with a trailer, this particular mid-season thriller feels very hackneyed in terms of its premise, all around, and the snapshot of performances seen here falls sadly flat. Some early reviews compare this show to Homeland or The Blacklist: Espionage, neither of which resemble current CPU! discussion subjects or ones requested by our panelists and potential panelists. Really, it’s a show that I can see several of us wanting to like – because we’ve liked something like it before – but not being able to go the distance because it will not be as good as similar properties from which it is heavily borrowing its influence and tone. If buzz or steam picks up around this mid-season entry, we’ll be open to reviewing our high standards, but for now, we pass.\n\n—\n\nFAM, CBS\n\nPREMIERE DATE: January 10, 2019\n\nWHO: Nina Dobrev (The Vampire Diaries), Odessa Adlon (Nashville), Tone Bell (Disjointed), Brian Stokes Mitchell (Mr. Robot), Sheryl Lee Ralph (One Mississippi, Instant Mom)\n\nWHAT: A woman’s dreams of an upstanding life with her new fiancé and his upstanding family are dashed when her younger train wreck half-sister comes to live with her to escape their train wreck of a father.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. There is no trailer for this show and very little information to go on to determine whether or not this program is worth a watch; not even TV pundits with connections have been given a glimpse, but then again, it’s CBS, and they’ve become kind of idiosyncratic as far as the major networks go – and not in a good way. A few of us at CPU! just spent the last few seasons of The Vampire Diaries NOT watching Nina Dobrev, so she certainly would not be the primary draw here, but as the situational premise of this situation comedy is pretty thin, I am not convinced that it would be enticing to most of the potatoes I know. If they start talking about it positively, though, we can always rethink the logic.\n\n—\n\nFBI, CBS\n\nWHEN: Tuesdays at 9/8c\n\nWHO: Missy Peregrym (Rookie Blue), Jeremy Sisto (Law & Order), Zeeko Zaki (Valor, 24: Legacy), Ebonée Noel (Still Star-Crossed), Sela Ward (CSI: NY)\n\nWHAT: The Dick Wolf-produced drama explores the inner workings of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Despite a decently packaged trailer and a potentially unusual and compelling turn by Missy Peregrym in the lead role, if Dick Wolf has his stamp on this, it will likely be a crime-of-the-week, neatly wrapped up in an episode (or two) procedural show, this time exploring the inner workings of one of the federal law enforcement agencies. We are not covering procedural TV (much) here at CPU!, and when we do, we’ll have to recruit a reviewer or moderator to do it because this Chief CP likely won’t be watching, at least not without an interesting gimmick to make it seem different from others of its genre. I can’t imagine this to be something entirely different than Law & Order and its franchise of shows, even if this series is, also, not entirely the same. CPU! will pass for now.\n\nSTATUS: On October 11, 2018, the network ordered a full season of an unknown number of episodes, though it will be greater than the initial order of 13 episodes, of which 10 have aired as of the publication date of this post. The pundits think there is a “safe bet” or a “very likely” chance of renewal.\n\nCPU! STATUS: The talk lines are silent. Maybe our podcaster roster and/or listeners don’t want to be wiretapped? Bad joke. Procedural TV does not fare well in our corner currently. If you want to change that, drop us a line.\n\n—\n\nTHE FIX, ABC\n\nPREMIERE DATE: March 18, 2019\n\nWHO: Robin Tunney (The Mentalist), Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Ten Days in the Valley, Lost), Mouzam Makkar (The Exorcist), Breckin Meyer (Franklin & Bash), Merrin Dungey (Big Little Lies, The Resident), Scott Cohen (Gilmore Girls), Marc Blucas (Underground, Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Adam Rayner (Tyrant), Alex Saxon (The Fosters)\n\nWHAT: Follows an L.A. district attorney who suffers a devastating defeat when prosecuting an A-list actor for double murder. With her high-profile career derailed, she flees for a quieter life in Washington. Eight years later when this same celebrity is under suspicion for another murder, Maya Travis is lured back to the DA’s office for another chance at justice.\n\nTrailer available at ABC’s YouTube channel.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Though this cast is teeming with familiar faces from large and small screen (was that Robin Givens in the trailer?), this show seems (un)remarkably like a ro"
