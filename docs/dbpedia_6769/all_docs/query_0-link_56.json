In 1784 the Spanish land grant for Rancho San Pedro, in the upper Las Californias Province of New Spain and encompassing present day Torrance, was issued to Juan Jose Dominguez by King Carlos III—the Spanish Empire.[3][4] It was later divided in 1846 with Governor Pío Pico granting Rancho de los Palos Verdes to José Loreto and Juan Capistrano Sepulveda, in the Alta California territory of independent Mexico.[5][6]\n\nIn the early 1900s, real estate developer Jared Sidney Torrance and other investors saw the value of creating a mixed industrial-residential community south of Los Angeles. They purchased part of an old Spanish land grant and hired landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. to design a new planned community.[7] The resulting town was founded in October 1912 and named after Torrance. The city of Torrance was formally incorporated in May 1921.[8] The first residential avenue created in Torrance was Gramercy and the second avenue was Andreo. Many of the house on these avenues turn 100 years of age in 2012. Both avenues are located in the area referred to as Old Town Torrance. This section of Torrance is under review to be classified as a historical district.[9] Some of the early civic and residential buildings were designed by the renowned and innovative Southern California architect Irving Gill, in his distinctive combining of Mission Revival and early Modernist architecture.[10]\n\nHistorically the El Nido neighborhood was home to many European immigrants, such as originally Dutch, German, Greek, Italian and Portuguese people; soon joined by Mexican-American and Hispanic and Latino immigrants; employed in the growing early 20th century agriculture, petroleum, and manufacturing industries, such as the fish canneries.[citation needed]\n\nRapid new growth in Torrance began after World War II as wartime industries transformed into Post-war Aerospace manufacturers and related technology industries. Large housing developments were built in the 1950s and 1960s to accommodate the new population. Torrance moved on after the closure of some aerospace development and oil refinery plants in the 1990s statewide recession.[citation needed]\n\nTorrance survived the deindustrialization, regional economic slowdowns and national recessions in the 1970s to 2000s. Large-scale Asian immigration in the past couple of decades has transformed Torrance into a diverse and multicultural city.\n\nGeography\n\nTorrance is located at (33.834815, −118.341330).[11]. The United States Census Bureau boundaries show the city has a total area of 20.5 square miles (53 km2), virtually all land.\n\nDescription\n\nTorrance is a coastal community in southwestern Los Angeles County, as seen on the map above, sharing the climate and geographical features common to the Greater Los Angeles area. Its boundaries are: Redondo Beach Boulevard and the cities of Lawndale and Gardena to the north; Western Avenue and the Harbor Gateway neighborhood of Los Angeles to the east; the Palos Verdes Hills with the cities of Lomita, Rolling Hills Estates and Palos Verdes Estates on the south; and the Pacific Ocean and city of Redondo Beach to the west.[12]\n\nTorrance Beach lies between Redondo Beach and Malaga Cove on the Santa Monica Bay.[13] The region shared by Torrance and Redondo Beaches are often called \"RAT Beach\" (short for \"Right After Torrance\" Beach or \"Redondo and Torrance Beach\").[12]\n\nOne of the country's few urban wetlands, the Madrona Marsh, is found in Torrance to explore. It is a nature preserve, on land once set for oil production and saved development, with restoration projects enhancing the vital habitat for birds, wildlife, and native plants.[14][15] A Nature center provides activities, information, and classes for school children and visitors of all ages.[16]\n\nResidents of an unincorporated area to the east of Harbor Gateway abutting the city of Carson are allowed to use \"Torrance\" in their addresses by the USPS.\n\nTorrance Attractions\n\nThe Del Amo Fashion Center, at 2.5 million square feet (232,000 m²), is one of the largest malls in the United States. Estimates vary between the second largest (after the Mall of America) and the fourth largest, depending on the measurements used. The current mall was created when Del Amo Center, built in 1958, merged with Del Amo Fashion Square, built in 1970. Once located on opposite sides of Carson Street, a gigantic expansion of the mall spanning Carson Street joined the two centers by 1982, making it the longest mall in the world at the time. In 2005, the east end of the original mall north of Carson Street was demolished to make way for a new open-air shopping center, opened in mid-September, 2006. The new center features upscale clothiers Anthropologie, Coach, H&M and Urban Outfitters as well as the restaurant P.F. Chang's. The housewares retail giant Crate & Barrel opened in what was once a section of the mall parking lot in Spring 2007. Torrance also borders the South Bay Galleria, which resides in Redondo Beach.\n\nThe Armed Forces Day Parade in Torrance, which was first produced in 1960, is the longest running military parade sponsored by a city. It is held annually on Armed Forces Day, and runs down Torrance Boulevard. The parade features military vehicles, school bands, and prominent community members.[17]\n\nThe Torrance Cultural Arts Center hosts cultural events year-round.

It is one of twelve county-operated Smart Gardening Centers around the region.[22][23][24] Columbia Park additionally serves as home to the Home Garden Learning Center, and is a backyard composting demonstration center provided by Los Angeles County.[25][26][27]\n\nLiving Tribute Trees park program: The Torrance Parks Living Dedication Tree Program is coordinated and by the City, so that families, individuals, and groups can sponsor the planting of a new tree in the park to honor a person or commemorate an event with a living tribute Tree Dedication.[28]\n\nTorrance Beach Park and Rat beach (Rat = Redondo and Torrance beach, or 'Right after Torrance' beach), on the southern coast of the Santa Monica Bay.[12] The Strand, a paved bicycle path that runs mostly along the Pacific Ocean shoreline in Los Angeles County, ends here.\n\nClimate\n\nTorrance has a Mediterranean climate or Dry-Summer Subtropical (Köppen climate classification Csb on the coast).\n\nThe period of November through March is somewhat rainy, as shown in the table to left.[29]\n\nThe Los Angeles area is also subject to the phenomenon typical of a microclimate. As such, the temperatures can vary as much as 18°F (10°C) between inland areas and the coast, with a temperature gradient of over one degree per mile (1.6 km) from the coast inland.
