        "text": "There are hundreds of talent agencies in Los Angeles. Yes, hundreds. LA being the capital of the entertainment business with hundreds of thousands of creatives (actors, writers, directors, artists, etc.) living and working here, everybody wants a piece of the pie. This can be a good or a bad thing for all of us actors living in Tinseltown. It’s good, because you have a lot to choose from. And it’s bad, because there’s a lot more work to do in terms of research and choosing the right agency that can potentially take you on.\n\nNormally, you would have to put together a huge list of all LA-based talent agencies – which is what I had to do for myself – then go through that list and pick which firms represent actors, because many of the LA agencies work exclusively with writers only, or hosts, or entertainers, new media talent (YouTube, Instagram, Twitch), and so on.\n\nThe below list of top acting agencies in Los Angeles solves this problem. Originally, I’ve intended to put this list together just for myself so that I can effectively do 2-3 rounds of mailing submissions and follow-ups, and then stay in touch with talent agencies using social media, emails, phones, and tracking their sites. Once I got a lot of it down, I realized that this may be a helpful resource for many other aspiring actor in Los Angeles.\n\nSo, I’ve done some more research into this to make sure the information is accurate, expand the number of acting agencies, and “dress it up.” Now the list has most of the best agencies in Los Angeles, ranked by how powerful they are in the industry, and all of which are looking to represent actors and new media entertainers.\n\nI’ve also included all the essential details for every agency which you may find useful if you’re doing more than one round of submissions and staying proactive with your search of representation. You will need this information not only for your research process, but also for getting in touch with acting agents and making connections, mailing your materials, whether by email or snail mail (I’ve indicated whenever that was possible on which method you should use), and any other creative ways you can find.\n\n“If I had three hours to chop down a tree, I’d spend the first hour sharpening the axe.” – Abraham Lincoln\n\nHow to Use This List Most Effectively\n\nThe first thing you need to pay attention to is how big and powerful a talent agency is. This list has been ordered from the largest talent agencies in Los Angeles all the way through mid-sized firms and into boutique agencies. Keep in mind that even though the best efforts have been made to keep these numbers as accurate as possible, the Hollywood industry changes on a weekly basis with agencies signing new clients and new deals, so just like a stock market, it will continue to fluctuate constantly.\n\nAnother important point to make is that there is no official or scientific approach to ranking LA acting agencies past the number 30 or so. This is somewhat arbitrary and based mostly on the agency’s client list and specific names, how many agents they have and how experienced those acting agents are, how well-connected the agency is within the Los Angeles industry, and more. The further down the list you go, the harder this ranking becomes since those agencies are far less known, which means toward the end of the list, most boutique agencies are almost all on the same or similar level in terms of how much power they have.\n\nWith that being said, this list of agencies for aspiring actors has more to offer than simply ranking all LA talent firms by how powerful and known they are. It took many weeks of research, analysis and me putting it together for this list to become the most comprehensive and helpful resource for new actors with no agents, so I recommend you take a full advantage of it.\n\nLet’s go through all the details provided for each talent agency, and what you can do with that information. As you scroll down to any agency on the list, what you’ll see is the following:\n\nAddress – this is agency’s location and their mailing address which you use to send them your materials, drop-off your material in person or come for a meeting if invited (you can even drop-by to talk to someone at the agency, but this rarely results in anything substantial for actors).\n\nPhone – talent agency’s primary phone number which you can use if you have a good reason, but do not call about getting signed and submissions unless specifically stated that you should.\n\nEmail – if email is included, that means you can contact the agency over email with any questions, but only submit your materials over email if specifically indicated to do so.\n\nWebsite – acting agency’s website will sometimes provide additional information for the actor to learn more about the firm. I recommend that if the agency has an “About” page, or any other details about themselves, you read and study everything to better understand who you may potentially work with. Some also have names of agents, more email addresses and other details that may not have been included in the details on this list since they can update the site at any time.\n\nSocial Media – most important ones are Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. If an agency has active social media page(s), that’s a good sign for actors. Start by following them, see what they post and learn more about the firm. Occasionally, it may result in a contact through natural conversations; however, note that 99% of agents in LA will not meet with an actor who submits themselves over social media (consider this approach to be frowned upon). It’s just good to have their pages for other reasons which I mention below.\n\nAgents – this is simply a number of acting agents the firm has on staff, which gives you an idea of how big they are. The number also shows you the agent-to-clients ratio, which tells you how much attention you may get from this agency should you get signed. For example, if an agency has only 1 employee on staff who also runs the agency itself, and over 100 clients, you may not be the most important on their roster, if get any attention at all.\n\nRepresented Clients – this is the number of creatives they have as clients. Again, it shows how big the firm is; however, a huge number of clients doesn’t always mean that it’s a good thing, and that’s for two reasons. First, use the previously mentioned agent-to-client ratio to see how likely you are to get a sufficient amount of attention from the agency. Second, it’s not all about the number of clients but rather who those clients are – one name can bring more business to them than 50 creatives combined.\n\nRepresents Ages – this figure will let you know whether this talent firm even has a department for you. Even though ages are mentioned in numbers, it mostly breaks down into categories like these: kids, youth, adults (roughly). Simply look at the number to learn if it’s worth submitting.\n\nSubmission Policy – this is a very important detail because it tells you specifically what to do and what not to do. Some agencies will accept any type of submissions, while some want them only over email or through regular mail, and others will not accept mailings but will accept invitations to showcases, and so on. Pay attention to this policy and try to stick to it the best you can.Quick side note: A lot of firms do not disclose their submission policy so actors often have to go by industry standards in those cases (you’ll notice the pattern as you scroll through the list). Most agencies will not want unsolicited mailings, but many actors still go ahead and submit them anyway. I cannot advise one way or the other, so it’s up to you how you’d like to proceed in this case. There are pretty much no cons to submitting to all the agencies using regular mail (not email, which is far less effective) other than your time and money potentially wasted.\n\nSubmit to Agent(s) – in here you can find names of talent agents you should address. You should always submit to a specific agent rather than the agency itself. Some firms will have just one or two names, while bigger ones will have ten and more. There really is no way to tell which agent is best to submit to, so all you can do is research their name further (starting simply with Google and checking their LinkedIn profile as well) and making a decision that way. If you cannot find any help in deciding, then pick one name and submit to that agent with a cover letter.\n\nDescription – this is just a general description of the actor agency, with some additional information that’s not as vital but may still be helpful. Wherever that was possible, I’ve included their history, how they got established, who the agency is run by, and any controversial stuff about them. I’ve covered their clientele, what known names they are representing, how you can submit to this agency, what you should expect from them, and more. It’s just a few paragraphs, so it definitely wouldn’t hurt to read it and know a little more about a firm you’re applying to.\n\nUsing all the above information, you can make your submission process a lot more effective and get better results. You’ll know exactly if the agency is a good fit for you, and how to approach them, and whom to contact. You can also use their email, phone and/or social media contacts to follow agency’s updates and/or follow-up on submissions (which I strongly recommend that you do) about two weeks after you’ve sent them all the material. Stay proactive and it will pay off, but don’t become a memorable nuisance.\n\nWith regards to social media, it’s very helpful to know agency’s (or, better yet, specific agents’) Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn pages. Other than the reasons I’ve mentioned above, you can also use these to understand whether you have any common connections with a potential talent agent – a very valuable opener when trying to submit to them, or even better, have someone you may know refer you to that acting agency or agent (this is the gold standard of approaching agents). Again, make sure not to submit yourself to agencies through social media.\n\nBelow I’ve provided some quick tips and guidelines on how to submit to agents in Hollywood or anywhere else in the US, advice on how to write a cover letter for an agent, and what not to do when submitting as an actor. I recommend you read through this information before delving into the list of talent firms. Try to optimize the approach you take the best you can so as to reap the benefits as soon as possible.\n\nMass Mailings vs Targeted Agencies\n\nThis list has been created to make it easier for you to email or mail your material to a large number of agencies almost at once in hopes to get a meeting with them. Many would advise that mass mailings don’t work as well as mailing to a targeted list of about 20-30 agents, and that’s true.\n\nHowever, here’s my take on this: it all comes down to how much you can afford.\n\nYou can target 20-30 agencies and stop there. But if money is not an obstacle for you, then what harm is there in mailing 60, 90, and even all 150 talent agencies in LA? There is none. The worst thing that can happen is that your submission is going to end up in a trash bin. There’s no actual blacklist.\n\nYou can even go through the whole list and structure it in your own way. Pick 20-30 agencies that you think are most likely to be interested in you, and put those first on the list. Then, pick another 20-30 and put those below the first batch. Repeat the process until you have all 150 in order. Once that’s done, go in order of importance and start mailing – send as many submission as you can afford, preferrably all of them in a short span of time.\n\nHow to Submit to Talent Agents\n\nIf you’d ask any Los Angeles based talent agent today on how should actors begin the process of getting an agent, they would all tell you that the very first thing you must do is research the industry and find talent agencies that may potentially accept you (“that are a good fit for you,” is what actors will typically hear).\n\nBut just because one agency won’t give you a meeting does not mean that another firm wouldn’t be interested. Fortunately, this job has already been done for you – you’ve got the agencies list, and the time-consuming part of the “research” process is out of the way.\n\nBut you still have plenty of work to do. You need to scroll through this list, and pick talent agencies that you would like to submit to and then do a round of mailings through email or using regular mail (maybe both, depending on your strategy).\n\nThe list has been broken down into several different categories – from “best” (meaning biggest and most powerful) talent agencies to smaller ones (boutique agencies with a smaller power rank). As you probably already know, for any new actor in LA, it will be much more difficult to get any meeting with one of those celebrity or powerhouse agencies, while boutique LA agencies are hungrier for new actors, even if you have little experience.\n\nI can already hear you wondering: “Should I even try to submit to any of the large agencies like WME, CAA, ICM or any agency from a top 20-30 part of the list?” The answer is: yes, you most certainly can. Again, it all comes down to how much time and money you can afford to waste on this.\n\nHow likely are you to get invited into a meeting with a CAA as someone with no substantial work on your resume? Not very likely (but not impossible, either). The only con of doing that is that you will have to spend more money on creating your mailing packages. However, if you’re not behind on your rent and have a dollar to spare, it doesn’t hurt to try your luck. Even though it’s unlikely, other actors have gotten meetings using cold submissions before.\n\nWhat to Submit to Acting Agents?\n\nThe submission package that you send to the agency using regular snail mail is pretty simple and straightforward. All you need to have in the envelope are the following items:\n\nResume\n\nHeadshot\n\nCover letter\n\nThis’s it – the whole package should contain three pieces of paper total. You don’t have to add any extras like actor postcards, additional list of your credits or skills, personal statement essays, or coupons to Starbucks. Save that investment for later, because those coupons will come in handy.\n\nResume. If you’re new to the industry, put whatever you have in terms of credits and training on your resume. If you’ve been around for a little while, pick the most important credits and use those. Try to keep the resume as succinct as possible to minimize the workload for the agent; they’ll love you for it.\n\nRelevant: More advice on acting resumes\n\nHeadshot. I would highly recommend to invest in a really good set of headshots. Not only does an experienced photographer knows how to sell your specific look, but the agent will also see that you’re not an amateur and understand the importance of investing into your career. These things matter.\n\nRelevant: More advice on headshots\n\nCover letter. This is the least important piece in the package, yet it must be included anyway. Even though many agents have said they don’t read cover letters, some still do. Not including one shows a level of unprofessionalism and, frankly, laziness. See tips below on how to write a cover letter.\n\nHow to Write a Cover Letter\n\nThese are just some quick tips for your cover letter that you should include alongside your headshot and resume. Even though it may not be read, you should still put the effort in case someone does read it.\n\nAddress the agent by name. This is very important – do not address the agency; don’t use “sir” or “madam” in your cover letter either. You should have a name of a specific agent working at the firm and use that instead. Names of the agents are included under every agency in this list.\n\nKeep it very short. Forget the standard cover letters you’d send for a regular job interview. Do not write more than 2-3 (!) sentences. Talent agents get hundreds of submissions every week, so they don’t have the time to read it. Put only the most important things in your cover letter.\n\nDo not mention your credits. Anything that’s already on your resume does not need to be mentioned, unless it’s of really substantial value (see below). Other than that, you don’t have to repeat that you’ve worked on this show or that play because the agent will see it on the resume.\n\nDo not describe your looks. Same as above, your headshot will tell/show the agent everything he or she needs to know. Don’t waste characters on describing how you look, and never – I repeat, never – compare yourself to any well-known actors (it’s a pet peeve of most agents).\n\nBe succinct. You need to keep it short, so pick only the essential things to mention: any awards you’ve won, your most important progress as an actor, a reputable drama school you’ve studied at, any relationships you have with a big-name casting directors/directors/producers, etc.\n\nUse your personality. It’s okay to be yourself. This is not your usual cover letter, remember? You’re an actor, so avoid sounding like a corporate drone and add a touch of who you are. Finding an original way of saying “hello” may raise the chance of your cover letter being read.\n\nMention the referral. If you’re submitting to an agent through a referral, remind them of that in the very first sentence. An agent will always pay attention to someone who’s been referring an actor (you) to him or her, and it’s the best way to get a meeting with a talent agent in LA.\n\nSpell check! There’s nothing worse than a cover letter demonstrating the actor’s failure at grammar and syntax. Make sure you check your cover letter many times for any errors.\n\nThese are just very simple, common sense type of things that all of us sometimes miss. I would strongly advise you to stick to every one of these industry standard “rules” when writing your cover letter.\n\nNow, with all of that out of the way, it’s time to start referring to the list and send those submissions.\n\nTop 10 Celebrity Agencies\n\n1. Creative Artists Agency (CAA)\n\nAddress: 2000 Avenue of the Stars # 100, Los Angeles, CA 90067\n\nPhone: (424) 288-2000\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nWebsite: https://www.caa.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/caaspeakers\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Creative-Artists-Agency-153306451349620/\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/creative-artists-agency\n\nAgents: 334\n\nRepresented Clients: 3,701\n\nRepresents Ages: 18-64\n\nSubmission Policy: Industry referral only. No unsolicited submissions. No calls. No drop-offs.\n\nSubmit to Agent(s): Richard Lovett, Rob Light, Kevin Huvane, Bryan Lourd, David O’Connor, Steven Lafferty, Michael Mand, Beth McClinton\n\nOne of the most prestigious talent agencies in Los Angeles, more commonly referred to as CAA, has a roster full of the highest-profile actors and a proven track record of winning its clients significant paychecks, CAA is the upmost tier for actors seeking a big break in LA.\n\nThe agency got its start in 1975, when five agents joined together in Century City. They were without significant funding, and relied on folding tables and chairs to win their first clients. Within its first week, CAA sold three packages, one of which was The Jackson 5ive. The agency grew quickly, earning around $90 million in booking each year by the end of the 1980s.\n\nAs changes occurred and CAA grew even greater in influence and revenue, its celebrity clientele expanded too. The agency came to represent nearly 1,500 of the top actors in Hollywood with approximately $150 million in revenue each year by the late 1990s. It’s unlikely that CAA will leave its position as one of top talent agencies in Los Angeles anytime soon. CAA doesn’t simply help its stars secure bookings; the agency offers career assistance and financial specialists to cover any need.\n\nToday, CAA has many different divisions in addition to the common film and television acting. That, and unique divisions such as CAA Marketing, which works with brands and corporations. Also CAA Sports, which features agents who solely represent athletes. That sets it apart from many other agencies. CAA is more than a top Los Angeles talent agency — it sits with the best around the world.\n\n2. William Morris Endeavor (WME)\n\nAddress: 9601 Wilshire Blvd 3rd Fl Beverly Hills, CA 90210\n\nPhone: (310) 285-9000 / (310) 859-4085 / (310) 248-2000\n\nEmail: See website for every agent’s email address\n\nWebsite: https://www.wmeentertainment.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/wme\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wmeentertainment/\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/william-morris-endeavor\n\nAgents: 305\n\nRepresented Clients: 4,613\n\nRepresents Ages: 18+\n\nSubmission Policy: Industry referral only. No unsolicited submissions. No calls. No drop-offs.\n\nSubmit to Agent(s): Jason Lublin, Carole Katz, Christian Muirhead, Patrick Whitesell, Brandt Joel, Andrew Dunlap\n\nThe product of a merger between William Morris Agency and Endeavor, WME is not only a top acting agency in LA but also the largest talent agency in the international market. With talent that includes the Rolling Stones, John Travolta, and Clint Eastwood, it’s a sure bet that WME will get you where you wish to go.\n\nOriginally, William Morris Agency and The Endeavor Talent Agency worked separately within the same city, though WMA had a storied, 100-year history of representing talent. While WMA had over a century worth of experience and expertise, Endeavor grew quickly and became one of the fastest-growing agencies just before the two companies joined forces.\n\nWhen the two entities merged in April of 2009, they became a celebrity agency in Hollywood. Today, their combined efforts as WME represent talent in every arena: movies, TV, music, theatre, digital and publishing, and even the NFL. It occupies a solid first position on my list of top talent agencies in Los Angeles. WME is also strong internationally which gives it a slight advantage over CAA (listed below).\n\n3. ICM Partners\n\nAddress: 10250 Constellation Blvd, 9th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90067\n\nPhone: +1 310 550 4000\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nWebsite: https://www.icmpartners.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/icmpartners\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ICMPartners/\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/icm-partners\n\nAgents: 164\n\nRepresented Clients: 2303\n\nRepresents Ages: 2+\n\nSubmission Policy: Industry referral only. No unsolicited submissions. No calls. No drop-offs.\n\nSubmit to Agent(s): Chris Silbermann, Jessica Lacy, Robert Gibbs, Dennis Ashley, Erik Horine, Dan Norton, Pete Stone, Doug Johnson, Sean Freidin, Hilary Baum McQuaide\n\nSimilarly steeped in Hollywood’s acting history, International Creative Management is known for representing talented comedians and stars of both film and TV. It’s been one of the top talent agencies in Los Angeles for a while. Although it may be better known for foreign films rather than U.S. blockbusters, it’s a firm in competition with CAA and WME for the best of the best.\n\nICM represents clients not only in Los Angeles, but also in Europe and on the eastern coast of the United States. Founded in 1975 when Creative Management Associates and International Famous Agency merged into one single agency, ICM has grown immensely.\n\nJust recently, in 2012, the agency gained a new name and a new partnership. It’s been one of the top talent agencies in Los Angeles for years, however. Whether it’s acting, or live performance, or literary publishing, or branded entertainment is what you’re after, ICM deals with these divisions and more.\n\n4. United Talent Agency (UTA)\n\nAddress: 9336 Civic Center Drive Beverly Hills, CA 90210\n\nPhone: (310) 273-6700\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nWebsite: https://www.unitedtalent.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/UTAFoundation\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/United-Talent-Agency-298558573656239/\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/united-talent-agency\n\nAgents: 192\n\nRepresented Clients: 3,674\n\nRepresents Ages: 18+\n\nSubmission Policy: Industry referral only. No unsolicited submissions. No calls. No drop-offs.\n\nSubmit to Agent(s): Jeremy Zimmer, James Berkus, Peter Benedek, David Kramer, Tracey Jacobs, Jay Sures, Josh Hornstock\n\nOne of Hollywood’s long-lasting and reputable talent agencies, United Talent Agency represents both actors and filmmakers who seek to break onto the competitive entertainment scene. Another household name, UTA has been one of top talent agencies in Los Angeles for quite some time.\n\nIf you’re a director, actor, or even producer, you should keep your eye on UTA. As one of the largest agencies not just in LA but the world, UTA hosts over 200 agents who represent talent that ranges from movies and TV to below the line talent and video games. When it first began, UTA formed as the result of a merger between the Bauer-Benedek and Leading Artists Agencies. It appears that mergers are a trend among agencies in Hollywood.\n\nOnce under the name of a single company, UTA took off and garnered immense success as its first packages included The Simpsons and The Wonder Years. They also got successful with talents like Joel and Ethan Coen, Larry David, and Mike Myers. Over the years, UTA has grown into a huge creatives powerhouse agency for talent internationally and at home here in LA.\n\n5. Paradigm Talent Agency\n\nAddress: 9336 Civic Center Drive Beverly Hills, CA 90210\n\nPhone: (310) 273-6700\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nWebsite: https://www.paradigmagency.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/musicparadigm\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/musicparadigm/\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/paradigm-talent-agency\n\nAgents: 123\n\nRepresented Clients: 2,180\n\nRepresents Ages: 18+\n\nSubmission Policy: Industry referral only. No unsolicited submissions. No calls. No drop-offs.\n\nSubmit to Agent(s): Sam Gores, Todd Quinn, Scott Buckland, Joel Rudnick, Craig Wagner, Lawrence Antoine, Erwin More, Alisa Adler\n\nHeadquartered in the famous, fancy and wealthy Beverly Hills, Paradigm is a top talent agency known for fostering the careers of independent film stars. If starting your career off in a Sundance-based film sounds enticing, one day Paradigm may be the top talent agency for you.\n\nWith offices scattered throughout the United States, Paradigm hosts more than 150 different agents who each represent a great variety of talent. They have their toes dipped in movies, television, music and live performance, comedy, endorsements, and many more divisions.\n\nIn recent years, the agency has expanded significantly into the Electronic Dance Music (EDM) arena by joining forces with the EDM talent agency AM Only. Now they represent stars like Skrillex and David Guetta, further establishing it as one of the top talent agencies in Los Angeles.\n\nJust two years ago, Paradigm grew its representation and influence within the music industry even more when it acquired half of the U.K.’s Coda Music Agency. Today, Paradigm is one of the most varied and versatile agencies in both Los Angeles and the nation.\n\n6. The Gersh Agency\n\nAddress: 9465 Wilshire Blvd # 600 6th Fl Beverly Hills, CA 90212\n\nPhone: (310) 274-6611\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nWebsite: https://www.gershagency.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/thegershagency\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gershproduction/\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-gersh-agency\n\nAgents: 99\n\nRepresented Clients: 2,364\n\nRepresents Ages: 13-64\n\nSubmission Policy: Industry referral only. No unsolicited submissions. No calls. No drop-offs.\n\nSubmit to Agent(s): Bob Gersh, David Gersh, Leslie Siebert, Marie Perry, Rick Greenstein, David DeCamillo, Ken Kaplan\n\nKnown throughout Hollywood and Los Angeles as TGA and Gersh, The Gersh Agency is a family affair. Supremely successful and featuring a host of famous talent, it’s an agency know for taking young actors and turning them into professional actors.\n\nCreated by Phil Gersh in 1949, Gersh has grown since its first years in the world of literary and talent representation. Today, the agency boasts more than 100 employees, 60 agents, and an office on each coast, making it yet another strong competitor among all other top talent agencies in Los Angeles.\n\nGersh is a top talent agency that is strong enough to be considered one of the powerhouses in LA. However, just because the top five spots have already been taken, I had to place it down here. Generally, they’re known as one of the most desired for talent agencies in LA to be represented by, and their roster of clients is no less impressive than those top five listed above.\n\n7.

No unsolicited submissions. No calls. No drop offs.\n\nSubmit to Agent(s): Jayme Yarow, Scott Harris, Nevin Dolcefino, Jonathan Coronel, Debbie Haeusler, Marcia Hurwitz, Jonathan Howard, Lucas Kosoglad, Josiah Akinyele\n\nIf you’re on the younger side of the Los Angeles’ showbiz talent pool, you’ll want to court the attention of Innovative Artists. This eighth one of the best talent agencies in Los Angeles, which represents Lilla Crawford and G. Hannelius, is known for scooping up young talent before they break onto the scene.\n\nInnovative Artists describes itself as an agency with a distinctive niche, one that offers its talent very personalized representation and service. With 25 years in the entertainment industry under its belt, Innovative Artists has become known for one quality in particular: excellent service for those it represents. I’ve heard actors say good things about it too.\n\nAccording to their own site, clients come first at this agency (one should hope so), and the agents themselves build strong relationships with those they represent. So even though while their client list may not look as impressive as those agencies listed above, this agency is just as strong any other I’ve mentioned in my second tier part of the list.\n\nFinally, remember that an agency like this who has leverage in Hollywood but isn’t as big may be the best deal. That’s because they will be able to focus on you more rather than spread their attention across many different clients who may be “more important.”\n\n9.

No drop offs.\n\nSubmit to Agent(s): Miles Lozano, Harry Abrams, Neal Altman, Robert Attermann, Marni Rosenzweig, Jeremy Apody, Pamela Fisher, Sharon Paz, Justin Baxter, Ashley Partington\n\nA Hollywood and Los Angeles staple since its inception in 1977, Abrams Artist Agency represents actors in every realm of the entertainment industry. They’re good for theater, animated film and television, TV, radio, commercials, and even event hosting.\n\nIt’s a top talent agency that’s enjoyed a fantastic reputation since its creation. Over its decades working in the entertainment industry, Abrams Artists Agency has made its name by becoming one of the most diversified in both Los Angeles and New York.\n\nWith so many different divisions, including a literary division and a currently growing and increasingly popular youth division of actors and performers, there’s truly a niche for any actor within Abrams, provided you’ve built a solid body of work or have a very marketable look. You’ll benefit from being a client of theirs the most if you also want to pursue voice over jobs as well as written works, but signing with them is just as difficult.\n\n10.

Accepts postcards and invitations. Interviews by appointment only. No calls. No drop-offs.\n\nSubmit to Agent(s): Don Buchwald, Richard Basch, Ricki Olshan, Robyn Stecher, Stephen Fisher, Kevin McEleney, Joanne Nici\n\nLast one on our list of top talent agencies Los Angeles but by no means least is Don Buchwald and Associates group, otherwise known as DBA. Back in 1977 when Don Buchwald, the agent, has left a commercial talent agency called Atlas Talent Agency, he formed his own in New York City with five other partners.\n\nIn 2010, they have finally opened an office in West Hollywood and now continue to grow in size very rapidly. Their biggest office remains in NYC where they own a building with six floors, all fully staffed. Even though their original niche was commercials, they are now a very strong theatrical agency representing some of the biggest stars in Hollywood.\n\nWith DBA’s constant signing of bigger names, this agency is quickly climbing up the ranks, and will likely be a lot higher in my 2017’s top talent agencies in Los Angeles list update. I’ve seen and heard actors and filmmakers discuss the agency far more often in 2016 than it was back in 2013. So if you get an offer from these guys, do not shy away (does this beg a “duh”?)\n\nTop 10 Powerhouse Talent Agencies\n\n11.

The agency represents mainly actors in film, TV, and commercial projects, but does also represent comedians.\n\nAlthough the agency is very small, with only 6 members of staff employed, its clientele goes to show that this agency is a good option for actors seeking agencies who are already well established.\n\nWhen initiating contact with this agency, actors need to consider several things. First of all, the agency does not have a website, so they can be reached by either phone or email (via Michael Greene, the owner). A second point is that the agency accepts only submissions by industry referral.\n\n12.

The agency represents mostly actors for film, television, theatre and voice over work. Even though the agency may seem a little obscure due to a lack of online presence, SMS may not be the best choice for actors new to the industry.\n\nThis talent agency is fairly secretive and does not disclose a lot of information about themselves, but people from the inside had positive things to say about SMS. At the time of this writing, the agency has fourteen theatrical agents working with about 26-29 clients, majority of whom are film and television actors with several actors working in voice overs.\n\nStone Manners Salners Agency has multiple agents who are relatively well-known behind the scene of the industry, with some of the names including Nicole Cataldo (LA, talent), Scott Manners (LA, talent and partner), Regan Frisby (LA, talent) and Ben Sands (NY, talent). Even though the agency is quite small compared to others close to its ranking position, SMS continues to gain momentum in star power rankings, which is what catapulted this agency to be fairly high on a list.\n\n14.

Although the agency naturally represents adults, it also has a specific division directed to representation of young actors.\n\nAlthough the first steps to forming the agency were taken already back in the early 1970’s, the company celebrated its 10th year anniversary in 2015. Asides from being well-rooted into the entertainment industry, the agency also has a strong social media presence on sites like Facebook, and have a website.

They also represent only 33 clients at the time of this writing, but they’re rising quickly.\n\nThe agency is located in West LA. It represents actors working within film and television, aged between 13-64 years old. The firm does not accept drop offs, and wants all submissions sent by snail mail.\n\nOther than the information listed above, not much information is openly shared by The Corsa Agency or can be found online, since they’re still fairly new and small. The talent agency does publicly list their mailing address, but seem to have no website or even an email address.\n\n45.
