        "text": "A 52-year-old actor and screenwriter pleaded not guilty Thursday to a series of alleged sexual assaults in Los Angeles.\n\nGabriel Olds, a New York native and Yale University graduate, was arrested around 9:40 a.m. Wednesday near Norway Lane and Norman Place, just east of North Bundy Drive, in the Crestwood Hills area above Brentwood, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nOlds was charged by the District Attorney’s Office in July with three counts of forcible rape, one count of rape of an unconscious person, sodomy by use of force, assault with intent to rape and injuring a spouse, girlfriend or child’s parent, according to court records.\n\nThe alleged offenses occurred between January and September of 2013.\n\nOlds is due back in an Airport Branch courtroom Sept. 9. A date is scheduled to be set then for a hearing to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to allow the case against him to proceed to trial.\n\nAccording to the LAPD, on Jan. 19, 2023, a 41-year-old woman reported that she was raped at her home by Olds. Two additional alleged victims subsequently came forward and made similar complaints, contending they had “consensual dating encounters that descended into violent sexual assault,” police said.\n\n“Investigators have identified three women that Olds assaulted, as well as two additional women who reported lesser violent sexual conduct,” according to an LAPD statement. “Due to Olds’ travels as an actor, detectives believe there may be more victims nationwide that have yet to come forward.”\n\nOlds has appeared in TV shows such as “Six Feet Under,” “NCIS” and the movie “The Eyes of Tammy Faye.”\n\nAccording to police, the alleged victims reported that Olds used his status as an Ivy League alumnus, along with his success in the entertainment industry, to meet and coax women into dates. Several women claimed they met Olds through dating apps.\n\nEach victim alleged that Olds lured them into a false sense of security during their initial encounter, later turning violent and non-consensual, police said.\n\n“We heard the same story again and again,” LAPD Special Assault Sector Supervisor Detective Brent Hopkins said in a statement. “Mr. Olds started off charming but then used brutal violence to carry out these rapes. Some of these survivors suffered in silence for years before finding the strength to speak up. Now that he’s off the streets, we want to make sure everyone has a chance to be heard.”\n\nOlds was being held on $3.5 million bail.\n\nAnyone with information regarding the assaults or any additional victims choosing to come forward can contact Hopkins at 213-473-0417 or 39343@lapd.online. Calls during non-business hours or weekends should be directed to 877-527-3247. Tipsters who prefer to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at 800-222-8477 or visit lacrimestoppers.org."
