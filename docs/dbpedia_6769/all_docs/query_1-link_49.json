The average class size is 30. Class periods meet for 57 minutes daily. Students are expected to take a minimum of six classes and to enroll in A-G required courses. Zero period classes are offered permitting flexibility in starting and ending time of the school day and the option for some students to carry seven classes per semester. Two semesters comprise the academic year. A large number of students attend a summer school program to support or move ahead in their studies. There are 84 certificated faculty, the majority of whom have a masterâ€™s degree plus 4 counselors, and 1 dean. West High has been designated a California Distinguished School in 1984, 1994, 1999, 2005, 2013 and again in 2019. West High received the CA Exemplary Program in Arts Education School in 2019. West High was named California Gold Ribbon School in 2015. It received the Excellence in Education Award from the United States Department of Education in 1984 and was awarded the National designation of Blue Ribbon School in 1984.\n\nTorrance Community"
