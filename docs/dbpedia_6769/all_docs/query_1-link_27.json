For the latter performance, Malek won an Academy Award for best actor.\n\nFamily and education\n\nMalek is one of three children born to Nelly Malek, an accountant, and Said Malek, an insurance salesman. Both parents and an elder sister, Jasmine Malek, emigrated to the United States from Cairo. The family—which also includes Malek’s identical twin brother, Sami Malek—eventually settled in Los Angeles, California. It was while in high school that Rami Malek initially became interested in acting. He later studied drama at the University of Evansville in Indiana, from which he graduated in 2003.\n\nEarly career\n\nFor a time Malek lived in New York City, but he eventually moved back to California and settled in Los Angeles. There he held odd jobs while struggling to find acting work. His perseverance paid off when he landed a role in a 2004 episode of the critically acclaimed TV show Gilmore Girls. Two years later he made his film debut, playing Pharaoh Ahkmenrah in Night at the Museum, a comedy starring Ben Stiller. The film was a box-office hit, and Malek reprised the role in two sequels, Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009) and Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb (2014). In 2012 he joined the blockbuster Twilight series, cast as a vampire named Benjamin in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn–Part 2.\n\nMalek’s other notable credits from this period include a three-episode guest appearance (2010) on the popular TV series 24 and a prominent role as a U.S. soldier in the World War II miniseries The Pacific (2010). He also continued to appear on the big screen. His credits from 2012 include the sci-fi action drama Battleship and Paul Thomas Anderson’s acclaimed The Master; the latter centers on a WWII veteran (Joaquin Phoenix) and a charismatic guru (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Malek also had supporting roles in two Spike Lee films: Oldboy (2013), a revenge drama about a man kidnapped and locked in a windowless room for 20 years, and Da Sweet Blood of Jesus, a horror comedy about vampires. Both were inspired by earlier movies.\n\nStardom: Mr. Robot and Bohemian Rhapsody\n\nWhile Malek was gaining more attention, his career trajectory took a dramatic upward turn when he landed the starring role of Elliot Alderson in Mr. Robot. Malek’s character is an asocial cybersecurity engineer and hacker who joins a group determined to overthrow corporate America. The show debuted in 2015 and was a huge success. Malek earned particular praise for his complex portrayal of the brilliant, alienated Alderson, and in 2016 he won the Emmy Award for outstanding actor in a drama series. After four seasons Mr. Robot ended in 2019.\n\nDuring this time Malek continued to appear in other projects. For Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) he took on the challenge of portraying Freddie Mercury, the flamboyant yet enigmatic lead singer of the rock band Queen. To prepare for the role Malek took extensive vocal training and analyzed countless hours of stage footage. The result was an uncanny portrayal of Mercury. He not only replicated the singer’s physical mannerisms but also delved deep into the emotional and personal complexities of the legendary musician. Backed by Malek’s performance, Bohemian Rhapsody was a major box-office hit, grossing more than $900 million worldwide. Malek earned a Golden Globe Award, and with his Oscar win, he became first person of Arab descent to receive an Academy Award for best actor.\n\nLater credits: No Time to Die and Oppenheimer\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nMalek had another hit with No Time to Die (2021), an installment in the James Bond franchise. He played the villainous Lyutsifer Safin opposite Daniel Craig as the legendary spy. The film grossed more than $770 million in global ticket sales. In 2022 Malek had a supporting role in David O. Russell’s Amsterdam, a social satire that centers on a fascist conspiracy to overturn the U.S. government in the 1930s; it starred Margot Robbie and Christian Bale. Malek was then cast in Chrisopher Nolan’s acclaimed blockbuster Oppenheimer (2023), a biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), an American physicist who played an integral role in the development of the atomic bomb but later was accused of having ties to communism. Malek’s role was brief but pivotal: he portrayed David L. Hill, a physicist who came to Oppenheimer’s defense.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nMalek is well known for his dedication to charitable causes and advocacy for minority representation in Hollywood and beyond. As a first-generation American of Egyptian ancestry, he has ardently advocated for diversity in media and the arts. This was highlighted in his Oscar acceptance speech, in which he discussed his identity and the difficulties he confronted in Hollywood. Malek has also been involved in advocating for immigrants and refugees. Notably, in 2021 he became an ambassador for the International Rescue Committee.\n\nAugust Samie"
