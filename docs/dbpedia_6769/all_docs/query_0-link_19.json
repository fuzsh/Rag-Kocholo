        "text": "New Perspectives on Southern Ocean Frontal Variability\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChapman, Christopher\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe frontal structure of the Southern Ocean is investigated using a the Wavelet/Higher Order Statistics Enhancement (WHOSE) frontal detection method, introduced in Chapman (2014). This methodology is applied to 21 years of daily gridded sea-surface height (SSH) data to obtain daily maps of the locations of the fronts. By forming frontal occurrence frequency maps and then approximating these occurrence-maps by a superposition of simple functions, the time-mean locations of the fronts, as well as a measure of their capacity to meander, are obtained and related to the frontal locations found by previous studies. The spatial and temporal variability of the frontal structure is then considered. The number of fronts is found to be highly variable throughout the Southern Ocean, increasing (`splitting') downstream of large bathymetric features and decreasing (`merging') in regions where the fronts are tightly controlled by the underlying topography. In contrast, frontal meandering remains relatively constant. Contrary to many previous studies, little no southward migration of the fronts over the 1993-2014 time period is found, and there is only weak sensitivity to atmospheric forcing related to SAM or ENSO. Finally, the implications of splitting and merging for the flux of tracers will be discussed.\n\nClimatology and variability of SST frontal activity in Eastern Pacific Ocean over the past decade\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Y.; Yuan, Y.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nDistribution of sea surface temperature (SST) fronts are derived from high-resolution MODIS dataset in Eastern Pacific Ocean from 2003 to 2015. Daily distribution of frontal activities shows detailed feature and movement of front and the discontinuity of the track of front cause by cloud coverage. Monthly frontal probability is calculated to investigate corresponding climatology and variability. Frontal probability is generally higher along the coast and decreasing offshore. The frontal activity could extend few hundreds of kilometers near the major capes and central Pacific Ocean. SST gradient associated with front is changing over different latitude with stronger gradient near the mid-latitude and under major topographic effects near tropics. Corresponding results from empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) shows major variability of SST front is found in mid-latitude and central Pacific Ocean. The temporal variability captures a strong interannual and annual variability in those regions, while Intraannual variability are found more important at small scale near major capes and topographic features. The frontal variability is highly impacted by wind stress, upwelling, air-sea interaction, current, topography, eddy activity, El Nino along with other factors. And front plays an importance role in influencing the distribution of nutrients, the activity of fisheries and the development of ecosystems.\n\nShifting of phytoplankton community in the frontal regions of Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean using in situ and satellite data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMishra, Rajani Kanta; Jena, Babula; Anilkumar, Narayana Pillai; Sinha, Rupesh Kumar\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe phytoplankton pigment indices were used to characterize the spatial succession of the community composition in the frontal regions of the subtropical front (STF), sub-Antarctic front (SAF), and polar front (PF) in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean during austral summer 2013. Diagnostic indices revealed that the flagellates were dominant in STF (51%) and progressively declined toward SAF (39%) and PF (11%). Similarly, the prokaryotes were highest in STF (43%) and decreased to SAF (32%) and PF (28%). In contrast, the diatoms were gradually increased from STF (6%) to SAF (29%) and PF (61%). The variability of flagellates and diatoms from the STF to PF is attributed to the variability of photosynthetically available radiation, sea surface temperature, and sea surface wind speed. The in-situ pigment indices were then compared to the NASA Ocean Biogeochemical model that shows the similar patterns of frontal community distribution except their magnitude. Similarly, the satellite retrieved phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) was checked for its consistency after comparing with the in-situ observations and the result shows underestimation of satellite measured values. The result suggests that the conjunctive analysis of in-situ, satellite, and model archive is suitable to study the impact of climate variability on the structure of marine ecosystems.\n\nProduction of giant marine diatoms and their export at oceanic frontal zones: Implications for Si and C flux from stratified oceans\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKemp, A. E. S.; Pearce, R. B.; Grigorov, I.; Rance, J.; Lange, C. B.; Quilty, P.; Salter, I.\n\n2006-12-01\n\nFrom a synthesis of recent oceanic observations and paleo-data it is evident that certain species of giant diatoms including Rhizosolenia spp. Thalassiothrix spp. and Ethmodiscus rex may become concentrated at oceanic frontal zones and subsequently form episodes of mass flux to the sediment. Within the nutrient bearing waters advecting towards frontal boundaries, these species are generally not dominant, but they appear selectively segregated at fronts, and thus may dominate the export flux. Ancient Thalassiothrix diatom mat deposits in the eastern equatorial Pacific and beneath the Polar Front in the Southern Ocean record the highest open ocean sedimentation rates ever documented and represent vast sinks of silica and carbon. Several of the species involved are adapted to a stratified water column and may thrive in Deep Chlorophyll Maxima. Thus in oceanic regions and/or at times prone to enhanced surface water stratification (e.g., during meltwater pulses) they provide a mechanism for generating substantial biomass at depth and its subsequent export with concomitant implications for Si export and C drawdown. This ecology has important implications for ocean biogeochemical models suggesting that more than one diatom \"functional type\" should be used. In spite of the importance of these giant diatoms for biogeochemical cycling, their large size coupled with the constraints of conventional oceanographic survey schemes and techniques means that they are undersampled. An improved insight into these key species will be an important prerequisite for enhancing our understanding of marine biogeochemical cycling and for assessing the impacts of climate change on ocean export production.\n\nSouthern Ocean frontal structure and sea-ice formation rates revealed by elephant seals\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCharrassin, J.-B.; Hindell, M.; Rintoul, S. R.; Roquet, F.; Sokolov, S.; Biuw, M.; Costa, D.; Boehme, L.; Lovell, P.; Coleman, R.; Timmermann, R.; Meijers, A.; Meredith, M.; Park, Y.-H.; Bailleul, F.; Goebel, M.; Tremblay, Y.; Bost, C.-A.; McMahon, C. R.; Field, I. C.; Fedak, M. A.; Guinet, C.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nPolar regions are particularly sensitive to climate change, with the potential for significant feedbacks between ocean circulation, sea ice, and the ocean carbon cycle. However, the difficulty in obtaining in situ data means that our ability to detect and interpret change is very limited, especially in the Southern Ocean, where the ocean beneath the sea ice remains almost entirely unobserved and the rate of sea-ice formation is poorly known. Here, we show that southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) equipped with oceanographic sensors can measure ocean structure and water mass changes in regions and seasons rarely observed with traditional oceanographic platforms. In particular, seals provided a 30-fold increase in hydrographic profiles from the sea-ice zone, allowing the major fronts to be mapped south of 60Â°S and sea-ice formation rates to be inferred from changes in upper ocean salinity. Sea-ice production rates peaked in early winter (AprilâMay) during the rapid northward expansion of the pack ice and declined by a factor of 2 to 3 between May and August, in agreement with a three-dimensional coupled oceanâsea-ice model. By measuring the high-latitude ocean during winter, elephant seals fill a âblind spotâ in our sampling coverage, enabling the establishment of a truly global ocean-observing system.

A southward shift of 0.05Â°-0.55Â° latitude decade-1 in the annual mean ABFZ position accompanied by an intensification of + 0.05 to + 0.13 K/100-km decade-1 has occurred as ocean mixed layer temperatures have warmed (cooled) equatorward (poleward) of the front over the 1980-2014 period. These changes are captured in a 35-year model integration. The oceanic warming north of the ABFZ is associated with a weakening of vertical entrainment, reduced cooling associated with vertical diffusion, and a deepening of the mixed layer along the Angola coast. These changes coincide with a steady weakening of the onshore atmospheric flow as the zonal pressure gradient between the eastern equatorial Atlantic and the Congo Basin weakens. Oceanic cooling poleward of the ABFZ is primarily due to enhanced advection of cooler water from the south and east, increased cooling by vertical diffusion, and shoaling of the mixed layer depth. In the atmosphere, these changes are related to an intensification and poleward shift of the South Atlantic sub-tropical anticyclone as surface winds, hence the westward mixed layer ocean currents, intensify in the Benguela upwelling region along the Namibian coast. With a few caveats, these findings demonstrate that air/sea interactions play a prominent role in influencing the observed decadal variability of the ABFZ over the southeastern Atlantic since 1980.\n\nMesopelagic fish assemblages across oceanic fronts: A comparison of three frontal systems in the southern California Current Ecosystem\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNetburn, Amanda N.; Koslow, J. Anthony\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWith strong horizontal gradients in physical properties, oceanic frontal regions can lead to disproportionately high biological productivity. We examined cross-frontal changes in mesopelagic fish assemblages at three separate frontal systems in the southern California Current Ecosystem (CCE) as part of the CCE Long Term Ecological Research program: the A-Front sampled in October 2008, the C-Front in June/July 2011, and the E-Front in July/August 2012. We analyzed the differential effects of front-associated regions on density and species composition of adult migratory and non-migratory fishes and larvae, and the larval to adult ratio (as a possible index of a population growth potential) for migratory and non-migratory species. The fronts did not have a strong effect on densities of any subset of the mesopelagic fish assemblage. The species composition of the vertical migratory fishes (and their larvae) was typically altered across fronts, with different assemblages present on either side of each front. The migratory assemblages at the fronts themselves were indistinguishable from those at the more productive side of the frontal system. In contrast, the assemblage composition of the non-migratory fishes was indistinguishable between regions across all three of the fronts. The differences between the Northern and Southern assemblages at the A-Front were primarily based on biogeographic provinces, while the assemblages at the E-Front were largely distinguishable by their oceanic or coastal-upwelling zone associations. These results generally confirm those of previous studies on frontal systems in the California Current Ecosystem and elsewhere. The ratio of larvae to adults, a potential index of population growth potential, was altered across two of the fronts for migratory species, elevated on the colder side of the A-Front and the warmer side of the E-Front. This finding suggests that fronts may be regions of enhanced reproduction. The larvae to adult ratio was\n\nThe Stability of Outcropping Ocean Eddies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPaldor, N.; Cohen, Y.; Dvorkin, Y.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn the end of the last century numerous ship-borne observations and linear instability studies have addressed the long life span of meso-scale ocean eddies. These eddies are observed to persist in the ocean for periods of 2-3 years with little deformation. As eddy instabilities occur because Rossby waves in the surrounding (assumed motionless) ocean interact with various waves in the eddy itself, the stability was attributed to some eddy structure that hinders such wave-wave interactions. However, instabilities with growthrates of the order of the inertial period were found in various multilayer models including hypothesized structures and several observed eddy structures. A solution to the difference between instability theory and observed stability was ultimately suggested by relaxing the assumption of a motionless ocean that surrounds the eddy and prescribing the mean flow in the ocean such that it counterbalances the depth changes imposed by the eddy while maintaining a constant PV-ocean. This hypothesis was successfully applied to Gaussian eddies for mathematical simplicity. Yet, the Gaussian eddy has no surface front - thus avoiding instabilities that involve frontal waves - and it disagrees with observation that clearly show that most eddies have surface fronts. Here the constant PV ocean hypothesis is applied to two frontal eddies: constant PV-eddies and solidly rotating eddy. A complete account of the mean flow of the coupled eddy-ocean system is analyzed using a canonical formulation of the gradient balance. The phase speeds of waves in the eddy-ocean system are computed by a shooting method. Both eddies are found to be unstable in motionless ocean, yet in a constant PV-ocean no instabilities are found using the exact same numerical search. While many eddy structures can be hypothesized there are only a handful of physical mechanisms for instability and in these eddies the assumed constant PV-ocean negates many of these physical mechanisms for instability\n\nOverview of the Frontal Air-Sea Interaction Experiment (FASINEX) - A study of air-sea interaction in a region of strong oceanic gradients\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWeller, Robert A.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nFrom 1984 to 1986 the cooperative Frontal Air-Sea Interaction Experiment (FASINEX) was conducted in the subtropical convergence zone southwest of Bermuda. The overall objective of the experiment was to study air-sea interaction on 1- to 100-km horizontal scales in a region of the open ocean characterized by strong horizontal gradients in upper ocean and sea surface properties. Ocean fronts provided both large spatial gradients in sea surface temperature and strong jetlike flows in the upper ocean. The motivation for and detailed objectives of FASINEX are reviewed. Then the components of the field program are summarized. Finally, selected results are presented in order to provide an overview of the outcome of FASINEX.\n\nInfluence of frontal zones on the distribution of particulate matter and organic compounds in surface waters of the Atlantic and Southern Oceans\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNemirovskaya, I. A.; Lisitzin, A. P.; Kravchishina, M. D.; Redzhepova, Z. Yu.\n\n2015-10-01\n\nParticulate matter and organic compounds (chlorophyll, lipids, and hydrocarbons) were analyzed in surface waters along the routes of R/Vs Akademik Fedorov (cruise 32) and Akademik Treshnikov (cruise 2) in February-May of 2012 and 2014, respectively, in the course of the 57th and 59th Russian Antarctic expeditions. It was found that the frontal zones exert the primary influence on the concentrations of the mentioned components in the Southern Ocean and in the western part of the Atlantic Ocean. The supply of pollutants into the Eastern Atlantic Ocean on the shelf of the Iberian peninsula results in a pronounced increase in the concentrations of lipids and hydrocarbons causing local anthropogenic pollution zones.\n\nThe Structure of A Pacific Narrow Cold Frontal Rainband\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJorgensen, David P.; Pu, Zhaoxia; Persson, Ola; Tao, Wei-Kuo; Starr, David OC. (Technical Monitor)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nA NOAA P-3 instrumented aircraft observed an intense, fast-moving narrow cold frontal Farmhand as it approached the Pacific Northwest coast on 19 February 2001 during the Pacific Coastal Jets Experiment. Pseudo-dual-Doppler analyses performed on the airborne Doppler radar data while the frontal system was well offshore indicated that a narrow ribbon of very high radar reflectively convective cores characterized the Farmhand at low levels with echo tops to approximately 4-5 km. The NCFR exhibited gaps in its narrow ribbon of high reflectively, probably as a result of hydrodynamic instability all no its advancing cold pool leading edge. In contrast to some earlier studies of cold frontal rainbands, density current theory described well the motion of the overall front. The character of the updraft structure associated with the heavy rainfall at its leading edge varied across the gap region. The vertical shear of the cross-frontal low-level ambient flow exerted a strong influence on the updraft character, consistent with theoretical arguments developed for squall lines describing the balance of vorticity at the leading edge. In short regions south of the gaps the vertical wind shear was strongest with the updrafts and rain shafts more intense, narrower, and more erect or even downshear tilted. North of the gaps the wind shear weakened with less intense Dihedrals which tilted upshear with a broader band of rainfall. Simulations using a nonhydrostatic mesoscale nested grid model are used to investigate the gap regions, particularly the balance of cold pool induced to pre-frontal ambient shears at the leading edge. Observations confirm the model results that the updraft character depends on the balance of vorticity at the leading edge. Downshear-tilted updrafts imply that convection south of the gap regions would weaken with time relative to the frontal segments north of the gaps since inflow air would be affected by passage through the heavy rain region before ascent\n\nStructural connectivity of right frontal hyperactive areas scales with stuttering severity.\n\nPubMed\n\nNeef, Nicole E; Anwander, Alfred; BÃ¼tfering, Christoph; Schmidt-Samoa, Carsten; Friederici, Angela D; Paulus, Walter; Sommer, Martin\n\n2018-01-01\n\nA neuronal sign of persistent developmental stuttering is the magnified coactivation of right frontal brain regions during speech production. Whether and how stuttering severity relates to the connection strength of these hyperactive right frontal areas to other brain areas is an open question. Scrutinizing such brain-behaviour and structure-function relationships aims at disentangling suspected underlying neuronal mechanisms of stuttering. Here, we acquired diffusion-weighted and functional images from 31 adults who stutter and 34 matched control participants. Using a newly developed structural connectivity measure, we calculated voxel-wise correlations between connection strength and stuttering severity within tract volumes that originated from functionally hyperactive right frontal regions. Correlation analyses revealed that with increasing speech motor deficits the connection strength increased in the right frontal aslant tract, the right anterior thalamic radiation, and in U-shaped projections underneath the right precentral sulcus. In contrast, with decreasing speech motor deficits connection strength increased in the right uncinate fasciculus. Additional group comparisons of whole-brain white matter skeletons replicated the previously reported reduction of fractional anisotropy in the left and right superior longitudinal fasciculus as well as at the junction of right frontal aslant tract and right superior longitudinal fasciculus in adults who stutter compared to control participants. Overall, our investigation suggests that right fronto-temporal networks play a compensatory role as a fluency enhancing mechanism. In contrast, the increased connection strength within subcortical-cortical pathways may be implied in an overly active global response suppression mechanism in stuttering. Altogether, this combined functional MRI-diffusion tensor imaging study disentangles different networks involved in the neuronal underpinnings of the speech motor deficit in\n\nStructural optimization of large ocean-going structures\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHughes, O. F.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nOcean-going vehicles and platforms are among the largest structures in the world and are subjected to relatively harsh conditions of motions and loads. Some of them, such as semi-submersible platforms, are a relatively new type of structure and hence there is no formal, well evolved and established structural design code as there is for more traditional structures. More recently, efforts have also been made to develop a design method of this type for ships and other ocean structures. One of the many advantages of a rationally based design method is versatility; it can be used for structures that have widely differing purposes, measures of merit, shapes and sizes. The purpose is to describe a rationally based design method that has been developed within the field of ocean structures, in order that persons dealing with other types of structure can judge whether and to what extent its various features may be useful for those other types. Also, even though some features may not be applicable they might stimulate some useful ideas.\n\nCross-frontal cold jets near Iceland: In-water, satellite infrared, and Geosat altimeter data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nScott, John C.; McDowall, Anne L.\n\n1990-10-01\n\nThis paper reports detailed in-water observations and satellite infrared images which are approximately coincident with a single Geosat altimeter track across the Iceland-Faeroes Frontal Zone. The ARE thermistor chain covered the upper 300 m of the ocean along the track, and the first two of a long sequence of NOAA satellite infrared images were obtained, all within 24 hours of the Geosat overpass. The data are interpreted as showing cold cross-frontal jets related to the formation of cold eddies south of the main frontal boundary. Implications for the use of altimetry for ocean monitoring are considered.\n\nFrontal mucocele with intracranial extension causing frontal lobe syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeidmayer, Sara\n\n2015-06-01\n\nMucoceles are mucus-containing cysts that form in paranasal sinuses; although mucoceles themselves are benign, this case report highlights the extensive damage they can cause as their expansion may lead to bony erosion and extension of the mucocele into the orbit and cranium; it also presents a rarely reported instance of frontal sinus mucocele leading to frontal lobe syndrome. A thorough discussion and review of mucoceles is included. A 68-year-old white man presented with intermittent diplopia and a pressure sensation in the right eye. He had a history of chronic sinusitis and had had endoscopic sinus surgery 5 years prior. A maxillofacial computed tomography scan revealed a large right frontal sinus mucocele, which had caused erosion along the medial wall of the right orbit and the outer and inner tables of the right frontal sinus. The mucocele had protruded both into the right orbit and intracranially, causing mass effect on the frontal lobe, which led to frontal lobe syndrome. The patient was successfully treated with endoscopic right ethmoidectomy, radial frontal sinusotomy, marsupialization of the mucocele, and transcutaneous irrigation. Paranasal sinus mucoceles may expand and lead to bony erosion and can become very invasive in surrounding structures such as the orbit and cranium. This case not only exhibits a very rare presentation of frontal sinus mucocele with intracranial extension and frontal lobe mass effect causing a frontal lobe syndrome but also demonstrates many of the ocular and visual complications commonly associated with paranasal sinus mucoceles. Early identification and surgical intervention is vital for preventing and reducing morbidity associated with invasive mucoceles, and the patient must be followed regularly to monitor for recurrence.\n\nCharacterizing frontal eddies along the East Australian Current from HF radar observations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchaeffer, Amandine; Gramoulle, A.; Roughan, M.; Mantovanelli, A.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe East Australian Current (EAC) dominates the ocean circulation along south-eastern Australia, however, little is known about the submesoscale frontal instabilities associated with this western boundary current. One year of surface current measurements from HF radars, in conjunction with mooring and satellite observations, highlight the occurrence and propagation of meanders and frontal eddies along the inshore edge of the EAC. Eddies were systematically identified using the geometry of the high spatial resolution (Ë1.5 km) surface currents, and tracked every hour. Cyclonic eddies were observed irregularly, on average every 7 days, with inshore radius Ë10 km. Among various forms of structures, frontal eddies associated with EAC meanders were characterized by poleward advection speeds of Ë0.3-0.4 m/s, migrating as far as 500 km south, based on satellite imagery. Flow field kinematics show that cyclonic eddies have high Rossby numbers (0.6-1.9) and enhance particle dispersion. Patches of intensified surface divergence at the leading edge of the structures are expected to generate vertical uplift. This is confirmed by subsurface measurements showing temperature uplift of up to 55 m over 24 h and rough estimates of vertical velocities of 10s of meters per day. While frontal eddies propagate through the radar domain independently of local wind stress, upfront wind can influence their stalling and growth, and can also generate large cold core eddies through intense shear. Such coherent structures are a major mechanism for the transport and entrainment of nutrient rich coastal or deep waters, influencing physical and biological dynamics, and connectivity over large distances.\n\nStructural connectivity of right frontal hyperactive areas scales with stuttering severity\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNeef, Nicole E; BÃ¼tfering, Christoph; Schmidt-Samoa, Carsten; Friederici, Angela D; Paulus, Walter; Sommer, Martin\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAbstract A neuronal sign of persistent developmental stuttering is the magnified coactivation of right frontal brain regions during speech production.

Kenneth\n\n1985-01-01\n\nWe examined the spatial distributions of picoplankton, nanoplankton, and microplankton biomass and physiological state relative to the hydrography of the Southern Ocean along 90Â° W longitude and across the Drake Passage in the late austral winter. The eastern South Pacific Ocean showed some large-scale biogeographical differences and size class variability. Microbial ATP biomass was greatest in euphotic surface waters. The horizontal distributions of microbial biomass and physiological state (adenylate energy charge ratio) coincided with internal currents (fronts) of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. In the Drake Passage, the biological scales in the euphotic and aphotic zones were complex, and ATP, total adenylate, and adenylate energy charge ratio isopleths were compressed due to the extension of the sea ice from Antarctica and constriction of the Circumpolar Current through the narrow passage. The physiological state of microbial assemblages and biomass were much higher in the Drake Passage than in the eastern South Pacific Ocean. The temperature of Antarctic waters, not dissolved organic carbon, was the major variable controlling picoplankton growth. Estimates of picoplankton production based on ATP increments with time suggest that production under reduced predation pressure was 1 to 10 Î¼g of carbon per liter per day. Our results demonstrate the influence of large-scale hydrographic processes on the distribution and structure of microplankton, nanoplankton, and picoplankton across the Southern Ocean.

M.\n\n2016-07-01\n\nTo develop a model for the dynamics of seismogenerating structures in the frontal zone of the Kolyma-Omolon superterrane (Chersky seismotectonic zone), the following aspects are analyzed: structural-tectonic position, deep structure parameters, active faults, and fields of tectonic stresses as revealed from solutions of focal mechanisms of strong earthquakes and kinematic types of Late Cenozoic fold deformations and faults. It is found that a certain dynamic setting under transpressional conditions takes place and it was caused by the interaction between structures of the Eurasian, North American, and Okhotsk lithospheric plates within regional segments of the Chersky zone (Yana-Indigirka and Indigirka-Kolyma). These conditions are possible if the Kolyma-Omolon block located in the frontal zone of the North American Plate was an indenter. Due to this, some terranes of different geodynamic origin underwent horizontal shortening, under which particular blocks of segments were pushed out laterally along the orogenic belt, on a system of conjugated strike-slip faults of different directions and hierarchical series, in the northwest and southeast directions, respectively, to form the main seismogenerating reverse-fault and thrust structures with the maximum seismic potential ( M â¥ 6.5).\n\nFrontal lobe connectivity and cognitive impairment in pediatric frontal lobe epilepsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBraakman, Hilde M H; Vaessen, Maarten J; Jansen, Jacobus F A; Debeij-van Hall, Mariette H J A; de Louw, Anton; Hofman, Paul A M; Vles, Johan S H; Aldenkamp, Albert P; Backes, Walter H\n\n2013-03-01\n\nCognitive impairment is frequent in children with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), but its etiology is unknown. With functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we have explored the relationship between brain activation, functional connectivity, and cognitive functioning in a cohort of pediatric patients with FLE and healthy controls. Thirty-two children aged 8-13 years with FLE of unknown cause and 41 healthy age-matched controls underwent neuropsychological assessment and structural and functional brain MRI. We investigated to which extent brain regions activated in response to a working memory task and assessed functional connectivity between distant brain regions. Data of patients were compared to controls, and patients were grouped as cognitively impaired or unimpaired. Children with FLE showed a global decrease in functional brain connectivity compared to healthy controls, whereas brain activation patterns in children with FLE remained relatively intact. Children with FLE complicated by cognitive impairment typically showed a decrease in frontal lobe connectivity. This decreased frontal lobe connectivity comprised both connections within the frontal lobe as well as connections from the frontal lobe to the parietal lobe, temporal lobe, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. Decreased functional frontal lobe connectivity is associated with cognitive impairment in pediatric FLE. The importance of impairment of functional integrity within the frontal lobe network, as well as its connections to distant areas, provides new insights in the etiology of the broad-range cognitive impairments in children with FLE.

R.; Nilsson, C. S.; Mcdougall, T. J.; Coleman, R.; Rizos, C.; Penrose, J.; Hunter, J. R.; Lynch, M. J.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe objectives of this study are to analyze ocean dynamics in the western South Pacific and the adjacent Southern Ocean and the eastern Indian Ocean. Specifically, our objectives for these three regions are, for the South Pacific Ocean: (1) To estimate the volume transport of the east Australian Current (EAC) along the Australian coast and in the Tasman Front, and to estimate the time variability (on seasonal and interannual time scales) of this transport.

Pre-stack depth migration (PSDM) analysis was applied to the multichannel seismic reflection data to produce an accurate depth seismic profile together with a P wave velocity model along a line that crosses the JFAST site location. The seismic profile images the subduction zone at a regional scale. The frontal prism where the drill site is located corresponds to a typically seismically transparent (or chaotic) zone with several landward-dipping semi-continuous reflections. The boundary between the Cretaceous backstop and the frontal prism is marked by a prominent landward-dipping reflection. The P wave velocity model derived from the PSDM analysis shows low velocity in the frontal prism and velocity reversal across the backstop interface. The PSDM velocity model around the drill site is similar to the P wave velocity model calculated from the ocean bottom seismograph (OBS) data and agrees with the P wave velocities measured from the core experiments. The average Vp/ Vs in the hanging wall sediments around the drill site, as derived from OBS data, is significantly larger than that obtained from core sample measurements.\n\nFrontal lobe alterations in schizophrenia: a review.\n\nPubMed\n\nMubarik, Ateeq; Tohid, Hassaan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo highlight the changes in the frontal lobe of the human brain in people with schizophrenia. This was a qualitative review of the literature. Many schizophrenic patients exhibit functional, structural, and metabolic abnormalities in the frontal lobe. Some patients have few or no alterations, while some have more functional and structural changes than others. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows structural and functional changes in volume, gray matter, white matter, and functional activity in the frontal lobe, but the mechanisms underlying these changes are not yet fully understood. When schizophrenia is studied as an essential topic in the field of neuropsychiatry, neuroscientists find that the frontal lobe is the most commonly involved area of the human brain. A clear picture of how this lobe is affected in schizophrenia is still lacking. We therefore recommend that further research be conducted to improve understanding of the pathophysiology of this psychiatric dilemma.\n\nPhytoplankton community structure is influenced by seabird guano enrichment in the Southern Ocean\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShatova, O. A.; Wing, S. R.; Hoffmann, L. J.; Wing, L. C.; Gault-Ringold, M.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nPhytoplankton biomass, productivity and community structure are strongly influenced by differences in nutrient concentrations among oceanographic water masses. Changes in community composition, particularly in the distribution of cell sizes, can result in dramatic changes in the energetics of pelagic food webs and ecosystem function in terms of biogeochemical cycling and carbon sequestration. Here we examine responses of natural phytoplankton communities from four major water masses in the Southern Ocean to enrichment from seabird guano, a concentrated source of bioactive metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) and macronutrients (N, P), in a series of incubation experiments. Phytoplankton communities from sub-tropical water, modified sub-tropical water from the Snares Island wake, sub-Antarctic water and Antarctic water from the Ross Sea, each showed dramatic changes in community structure following additions of seabird guano. We observed particularly high growth of prymnesiophytes in response to the guano-derived nutrients within sub-Antarctic and sub-tropical frontal zones, resulting in communities dominated by larger cell sizes than in control incubations. Community changes within treatments enriched with guano were distinct, and in most cases more extensive, than those observed for treatments with additions of macronutrients (N, P) or iron (Fe) alone. These results provide the first empirical evidence that seabird guano enrichment can drive significant changes in the structure and composition of natural phytoplankton communities. Our findings have important implications for understanding the consequences of accumulation of bioactive metals and macronutrients within food webs and the role of seabirds as nutrient vectors within the Southern Ocean ecosystem.\n\nInhomogeneities in frontal cirrus clouds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNeis, Patrick; KrÃ¤mer, Martina; Hoor, Peter; Reutter, Philipp; Spichtinger, Peter\n\n2013-04-01\n\nFrontal cirrus clouds have a scientifically proven effect on the Earth's radiation budget and thereby an influence on the weather and climate change in regional scale. The formation processes and structures of frontal cirrus clouds are still not fully understood. For a close investigation of typical frontal cirrus clouds, we use in situ measurements from the CIRRUS-III campaign over Germany and Northern Europe in November 2006. Besides water vapour, cloud ice water content, ice particle size distributions, condensation nuclei, and reactive nitrogen were measured during 6 flights. In this work the data of the 24th November flight is used to detect and to analyze warm frontal cirrus clouds in the mid latitudes on small temporal and spatial scale. Further, these results are compared with large-scale meteorological analyses from ECMWF and satellite data. Combining these data, the formation and evolution of inhomogeneities in the cirrus cloud structure are investigated. One important result is a qualitative agreement between the occurrence of cirrus clouds and the 'sharpness' of the Tropopause Inversion Layer (TIL).\n\nThe frontal lobe and aggression\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSÃ©guin, Jean R.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFrontal lesions often lead to psychosocial problems. It is not surprising that frontal lobe dysfunctions have been proposed to underlie antisocial behaviour in individuals without apparent lesions. However, physical aggression and violence have never been systematically related to acquired lesions. Whereas, traditional neuropsychological testing identifies problems in cognitive and emotional information processing, recent brain-imaging studies have revealed both the frontal structural and functional underpinnings of antisocial behaviour. Careful characterization of antisocial behaviour subtypes seems to indicate that cognitive-neuropsychological function is systematically poor in physical aggression and hyperactivity. Recent refinements point to biological and genetic moderators of that association.

Given its proximity to the cranial vault and orbit, frontal sinus pathology can progress to involve these structures and lead to significant morbidity, or even mortality. Surgical management of the frontal sinus is technically challenging. Various open and endoscopic surgical techniques are available to the otolaryngologist. This article presents an overview of the major disease entities that affect the frontal sinus, with a special emphasis on treatment principles and surgical management. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

These regions have anomalous oceanic lithosphere: the upper mantle of the North Atlantic ocean is affected by the Iceland plume, while the Arctic ocean has some of the slowest spreading rates. Our specific goal is to constrain the density structure of the upper mantle in order to understand the links between the deep lithosphere dynamics, ocean spreading, ocean floor bathymetry, heat flow and structure of the oceanic lithosphere in the regions where classical models of evolution of the oceanic lithosphere may not be valid. The major focus is on the oceanic lithosphere, but the Arctic shelves with a sufficient data coverage are also included into the analysis. Out major interest is the density structure of the upper mantle, and the analysis is based on the interpretation of GOCE satellite gravity data. To separate gravity anomalies caused by subcrustal anomalous masses, the gravitational effect of water, crust and the deep mantle is removed from the observed gravity field. For bathymetry we use the global NOAA database ETOPO1. The crustal correction to gravity is based on two crustal models: (1) global model CRUST1.0 (Laske, 2013) and, for a comparison, (2) a regional seismic model EUNAseis (Artemieva and Thybo, 2013). The crustal density structure required for the crustal correction is constrained from Vp data. Previous studies have shown that a large range of density values corresponds to any Vp value. To overcome this problem and to reduce uncertainty associated with the velocity-density conversion, we account for regional tectonic variations in the Northern Atlantics as constrained by numerous published seismic profiles and potential-field models across the Norwegian off-shore crust (e.g. Breivik et al., 2005, 2007), and apply different Vp-density conversions for different parts of the region. We present preliminary results\n\n'Passive-roof' duplex geometry in the frontal structures of the Kirthar and Sulaiman mountain belts, Pakistan\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBanks, C. J.; Warburton, J.\n\nExploration for hydrocarbons over the past few years has greatly improved our understanding of the geometry of frontal mountain belt structures. In this study we introduce and discuss the concept of the 'Passive-roof duplex', using as the main example the Kirthar and Sulaiman Ranges in the Baluchistan Province of Pakistan. Structures similar to those described here have been recognized previously in other mountain belts, and they appear to exist as a common feature in many more frontal regions of mountain belts. Our example of a Passive-roof duplex which we describe from Pakistan is compared briefly with similar structures reported by others. The Passive-roof duplex is here defined as a duplex whose roof thrust has backthrust sense ( Passive-roof thrust) and whose roof sequence (those rocks lying above the roof thrust) remains relatively 'stationary' during foreland directed piggy-back style propagation of horses within the duplex.\n\nLexical Retrieval Constrained by Sound Structure: The Role of the Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSharp, David J.; Scott, Sophie K.; Cutler, Anne; Wise, Richard J.

As do surface waves, internal solitary waves may overturn and break, and the process is thought to provide a globally significant source of turbulent mixing and energy dissipation. Although commonly observed in geophysical fluids, the origins of internal solitary waves remain unclear. Here we report a rarely observed natural case of the birth of internal solitary waves from a frontally forced interfacial gravity current intruding into a two-layer and vertically sheared background environment. The results of the analysis carried out suggest that fronts may represent additional and unexpected sources of internal solitary waves in regions of lakes, oceans and atmospheres that are dynamically similar to the situation examined here in the Saguenay Fjord, Canada.\n\nGlobal Mapping of Oceanic and Continental Shelf Crustal Thickness and Ocean-Continent Transition Structure\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKusznir, Nick; Alvey, Andy; Roberts, Alan\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe 3D mapping of crustal thickness for continental shelves and oceanic crust, and the determination of ocean-continent transition (OCT) structure and continent-ocean boundary (COB) location, represents a substantial challenge. Geophysical inversion of satellite derived free-air gravity anomaly data incorporating a lithosphere thermal anomaly correction (Chappell & Kusznir, 2008) now provides a useful and reliable methodology for mapping crustal thickness in the marine domain. Using this we have produced the first comprehensive maps of global crustal thickness for oceanic and continental shelf regions. Maps of crustal thickness and continental lithosphere thinning factor from gravity inversion may be used to determine the distribution of oceanic lithosphere, micro-continents and oceanic plateaux including for the inaccessible polar regions (e.g. Arctic Ocean, Alvey et al.,2008). The gravity inversion method provides a prediction of continent-ocean boundary location which is independent of ocean magnetic anomaly and isochron interpretation. Using crustal thickness and continental lithosphere thinning factor maps with superimposed shaded-relief free-air gravity anomaly, we can improve the determination of pre-breakup rifted margin conjugacy and sea-floor spreading trajectory during ocean basin formation. By restoring crustal thickness & continental lithosphere thinning to their initial post-breakup configuration we show the geometry and segmentation of the rifted continental margins at their time of breakup, together with the location of highly-stretched failed breakup basins and rifted micro-continents. For detailed analysis to constrain OCT structure, margin type (i.e. magma poor, \"normal\" or magma rich) and COB location, a suite of quantitative analytical methods may be used which include: (i) Crustal cross-sections showing Moho depth and crustal basement thickness from gravity inversion. (ii) Residual depth anomaly (RDA) analysis which is used to investigate OCT\n\n[The treatment principles of frontal sinus tract after the frontal approach craniotomy].\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, Huanxin; Li, Haiyan; Liu, Gang\n\n2015-12-01\n\nTo investigate the causes, clinical manifestation and treatment principles of frontal sinus tract after the frontal approach craniotomy. The clinic data of 13 patients with frontal skin sinus tract after the frontal approach craniotomy were retrospectively analyzed. All of them were described in the clinical record to have undergone frontal sinus mucosa pushing down or shaving and bone wax filling in the frontal sinus during the surgery, of whom 3 cases had history of frontal abscess incision drainage. All patients were performed endoscopic frontal sinus surgery and forehead skin sinus tract excision and suture. All of the patients successfully recovered after one-stage operation, and the frontal skin sinus tract was healed. The frontal approach craniotomy with postoperative frontal sinus tract was related with the improper use of bone wax tamponade and sealing of frontal sinus. The treatment principles were to remove bone wax, remove inflammatory granulation tissue around the sinus tract, and to open frontal sinus and promote frontal sinus drainage.\n\nAbnormal structural connectivity between the basal ganglia, thalamus, and frontal cortex in patients with disorders of consciousness.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeng, Ling; Xie, Qiuyou; Zhao, Ling; Zhang, Ruibin; Ma, Qing; Wang, Junjing; Jiang, Wenjie; He, Yanbin; Chen, Yan; Li, Changhong; Ni, Xiaoxiao; Xu, Qin; Yu, Ronghao; Huang, Ruiwang\n\n2017-05-01\n\nConsciousness loss in patients with severe brain injuries is associated with reduced functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), fronto-parietal network, and thalamo-cortical network. However, it is still unclear if the brain white matter connectivity between the above mentioned networks is changed in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). In this study, we collected diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from 13Â patients and 17 healthy controls, constructed whole-brain white matter (WM) structural networks with probabilistic tractography. Afterward, we estimated and compared topological properties, and revealed an altered structural organization in the patients. We found a disturbance in the normal balance between segregation and integration in brain structural networks and detected significantly decreased nodal centralities primarily in the basal ganglia and thalamus in the patients. A network-based statistical analysis detected a subnetwork with uniformly significantly decreased structural connections between the basal ganglia, thalamus, and frontal cortex in the patients. Further analysis indicated that along the WM fiber tracts linking the basal ganglia, thalamus, and frontal cortex, the fractional anisotropy was decreased and the radial diffusivity was increased in the patients compared to the controls. Finally, using the receiver operating characteristic method, we found that the structural connections within the NBS-derived component that showed differences between the groups demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity (>90%). Our results suggested that major consciousness deficits in DOC patients may be related to the altered WM connections between the basal ganglia, thalamus, and frontal cortex.

The study target is Slipstream submarine landslide, one of the slope failures observed on the frontal ridges of the Northern Cascadia accretionary margin off Vancouver Island. The previous studies indicated a possible connection between this submarine landslide feature and gas hydrate, whose occurrence is indicated by a prominent bottom-simulating reflector (BSR), at a depth of ~265-275 m beneath the seafloor (mbsf). The OBS (Ocean Bottom Seismometer) data collected during SeaJade (Seafloor Earthquake Array - Japan Canada Cascadia Experiment) project were used to derive the subseafloor velocity structure for both P- and S-wave using travel times picked from refraction and reflection events. The P-wave velocity structure above the BSR showed anomalous high velocities of about 2.0 km/s at shallow depths of 100 mbsf, closely matching the estimated depth of the glide plane (100 Â± 10 m). Forward modelling of S-waves was carried out using the data from the OBS horizontal components. The S-wave velocities, interpreted in conjunction with the P-wave results, provide the key constraints on the gas hydrate distribution within the pores. The hydrate distribution in the pores is important for determining concentrations, and also for determining the frame strength which is critical for controlling slope stability of steep frontal ridges. The increase in S-wave velocity suggests that the hydrate is distributed as part of the load-bearing matrix to increase the rigidity of the sediment.\n\nCorrelational structure of 'frontal' tests and intelligence tests indicates two components with asymmetrical neurostructural correlates in old age.\n\nPubMed\n\nCox, Simon R; MacPherson, Sarah E; Ferguson, Karen J; Nissan, Jack; Royle, Natalie A; MacLullich, Alasdair M J; Wardlaw, Joanna M; Deary, Ian J\n\n2014-09-01\n\nBoth general fluid intelligence ( g f ) and performance on some 'frontal tests' of cognition decline with age. Both types of ability are at least partially dependent on the integrity of the frontal lobes, which also deteriorate with age. Overlap between these two methods of assessing complex cognition in older age remains unclear. Such overlap could be investigated using inter-test correlations alone, as in previous studies, but this would be enhanced by ascertaining whether frontal test performance and g f share neurobiological variance. To this end, we examined relationships between g f and 6 frontal tests (Tower, Self-Ordered Pointing, Simon, Moral Dilemmas, Reversal Learning and Faux Pas tests) in 90 healthy males, aged ~Â 73Â years. We interpreted their correlational structure using principal component analysis, and in relation to MRI-derived regional frontal lobe volumes (relative to maximal healthy brain size). g f correlated significantly and positively (.24Â â¤Â r Â â¤Â .53) with the majority of frontal test scores. Some frontal test scores also exhibited shared variance after controlling for g f . Principal component analysis of test scores identified units of g f -common and g f -independent variance. The former was associated with variance in the left dorsolateral (DL) and anterior cingulate (AC) regions, and the latter with variance in the right DL and AC regions. Thus, we identify two biologically-meaningful components of variance in complex cognitive performance in older age and suggest that age-related changes to DL and AC have the greatest cognitive impact.\n\nOcean plankton.

We analyzed 7.2 terabases of metagenomic data from 243 Tara Oceans samples from 68 locations in epipelagic and mesopelagic waters across the globe to generate an ocean microbial reference gene catalog with >40 million nonredundant, mostly novel sequences from viruses, prokaryotes, and picoeukaryotes. Using 139 prokaryote-enriched samples, containing >35,000 species, we show vertical stratification with epipelagic community composition mostly driven by temperature rather than other environmental factors or geography. We identify ocean microbial core functionality and reveal that >73% of its abundance is shared with the human gut microbiome despite the physicochemical differences between these two ecosystems.

Submesoscale frontal processes can drive large vertical velocities and enhance vertical tracer fluxes in the upper ocean. The associated high temporal and spatial variability poses a large challenge to observational approaches targeting these processes. In this study the role of submesoscale processes for the ventilation of the near-coastal oxygen minimum zone off Peru is investigated. We use satellite based sea surface temperature measurements and multiple high-resolution glider observations of temperature, salinity, oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence carried out in January and February 2013 off Peru near 14Â°S during active upwelling. Additionally, high-resolution regional ocean circulation model outputs (ROMS) outputs are analysed. At the beginning of our observational survey a previously upwelled, productive and highly oxygenated water body is found in the mixed layer. Subsequently, a cold filament forms and the waters are moved offshore. After the decay of the filament and the relaxation of the upwelling front, the oxygen enriched surface water is found in the previously less oxygenated thermocline suggesting the occurrence of frontal subduction. A numerical model simulation is used to analyse the evolution of Lagrangian numerical floats in several upwelling filaments, whose vertical structure and hydrographic properties agree well with the observations. The floats trajectories support our interpretation that the subduction of previously upwelled water occurs in filaments off Peru. We find that 40 - 60 % of the floats seeded in the newly upwelled water is subducted within a time period of 5 days. This hightlights the importance of this process in ventilating the oxycline off Peru.\n\nDevelopment, Testing and Operation of a Large Suspended Ocean Measurement Structure for Deep-Ocean Use\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1992-05-01\n\nand systems for developing , testing, and operating the system.

Recently, a condition in postmenopausal women characterized by progressive frontal hairline recession associated with scarring has been described. Our purpose was to study the clinical and histopathologic features and results of treatment in a group of women with the frontal variant of lichen planopilaris and to compare the immunohistochemical profile of scalp biopsy specimens from this subset with that found in the multifocal variant of lichen planopilaris. The clinical data as well as the histopathologic findings in 16 women with frontal fibrosing alopecia were collated. The immunohistochemical profile of six scalp biopsy specimens from the frontal hairline were compared with six specimens from women with multifocal lichen planopilaris. In addition to the progressive frontal fibrosing alopecia in all 16 women, total loss or a marked decrease of the eyebrows was observed in 13. No evidence of lichen planus was observed at other sites. In one patient multifocal areas of lichen planopilaris developed in the scalp. The frontal fibrosing alopecia was slowly progressive but has stabilized in five patients. Biopsy specimens from the frontal hairline showed histologic changes identical to lichen planopilaris. Immunophenotyping failed to reveal any significant differences between the frontal and multifocal variants. No effective treatments emerged although oral steroids and antimalarials may temporarily slow the course. Hormone replacement therapy did not appear to influence the course of the alopecia. Progressive frontal fibrosing alopecia is a clinically distinct variant of lichen planopilaris that affects in particular elderly women and frequently involves the eyebrows. The basis for this lichenoid tissue reaction targeting frontal scalp follicles and eyebrows is unknown.\n\nStudy on the frame body structure of micro-electric vehicle based on frontal crash safety\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLu, Yaoquan; Zhang, Sanchuan\n\n2017-08-01\n\nIn order to research the safety of skeleton type body of micro-electric vehicles in the frontal collision, the method of finite element modeling and simulation are used to analyze frame body that is fitted with the energy absorption structure, the simulation results show that On the basis of absorbing the most energy and the least of body acceleration, the absorbent structure parameters can be optimized, the optimized parameters are length 180 mm, wall thickness 3 mm and materials Q460.\n\nStructural characteristics around the frontal thrust along the Nankai Trough revealed by bathymetric and seismic reflection survey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYamashita, M.; Nakanishi, A.; Moore, G. F.; Kodaira, S.; Nakamura, Y.; Miura, S.; Kaneda, Y.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nGreat earthquakes with tsunamis with recurrence intervals of 100-200 years have occurred along the Nankai Trough near central Japan where the Shikoku Basin is subducting with thick sediments on the Philippine Sea plate. To predict the exact height of the tsunami on the coast region generated by these large ruptures, it is important to estimate the vertical deformation that occurs on the seaward end of the rupture area. Recent drilling results have also yielded evidence not only of splay faults that generate tsunamigenic rupture, but also new evidence of tsunamigenic rupture along the frontal thrust at the trench axis in the Nankai Trough. In order to understand the deformation around the frontal thrust at the trench axis, we conducted a dense high-resolution seismic reflection survey with 10-20 km spacing over 1500 km of line length during 2013 and 2014. Clear seismic reflection images of frontal thrusts in the accretionary prism and subducting Shikoku Basin, image deformation along the trench axis between off Muroto Cape and off Ashizuri Cape. The cumulative displacement along the frontal thrust and second thrust are measured from picked distinct reflectors in depth-converted profiles. The average value of cumulative displacement of the frontal thrust is more than 100 m within 2 km depth beneath the seafloor. The location of highest displacement of 300 m displacement agree with the seaward end of slip distribution of the 1946 Nankai event calculated by numerical simulations. We also evaluate the seaward structure for understanding the future rupture distribution. The protothrust zone (PTZ) consisting of many incipient thrusts is identifiable in the portion of trough-fill sediments seaward of the frontal thrust. In order to emphasize the characteristics of frontal thrust and PTZ, we construct the detailed relief image for focusing on the lineated slope of the PTZ at the trough axis. Although our surveys covered a part of Nankai seismogenic zone, it is important to\n\nPediatric frontal mucocele secondary to a bifid frontal sinus septum.\n\nPubMed\n\nPlikaitis, Christina M; Purzycki, Adam R; Couture, Daniel; David, Lisa R\n\n2010-09-01\n\nA mucocele is a mucus-containing sac lined with epithelium that arises within a sinus when its drainage is compromised. The frontal sinus is the most common location, with frontal mucocele development occurring when the nasofrontal duct becomes obstructed because of polyps, bone tumors, prior surgery, sinusitis, trauma, or anatomic variation. We report an unusual case of a sterile pediatric frontal mucocele presenting as a slowly enlarging forehead mass due to a bifid frontal sinus septum. A 9-year-old girl presented to the craniofacial clinic for evaluation of a right frontal mass that had been slowly growing over the past year. She was otherwise healthy and had no history of previous trauma or sinus infections. Computed tomography (CT) scan results revealed a localized frontal fluid collection with protrusion and thinning of the anterior frontal bone between 2 midline bony septii. Surgical cranialization of the frontal sinus was performed. The anatomy of her lesion seen both on CT scan and intraoperatively likely explains this unusual case presentation. Instead of the usual inciting event of an intact frontal sinus drainage system becoming blocked, this patient seemed to have a primary developmental lack of any drainage system that led to her mucocele. During formation of her frontal sinus, she developed a bifid septum within the midline that excluded a portion of her frontal sinus from the lateral nasofrontal ducts. With mucus-producing epithelium trapped within these bony confines, pressure began to mount with expansion and thinning of the bone both anteriorly and posteriorly. The lack of any infectious symptoms and sterile culture results may support that this space developed primarily and was never in continuity with the external drainage system. Only 4 other patients have been reported with asymptomatic forehead swelling as the only presenting symptom, with the age ranging from 33 to 79 years. This patient represents the first clinical report of a congenital\n\nCalcareous nannoplankton assemblages across the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition in the southwestern Indian Ocean, IODP Site U1475\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCares, Z.; Farr, C.

One of the main scientific objectives of this expedition was to determine the dynamics of the Indian-Atlantic Ocean Gateway circulation during Pliocene-Pleistocene climate changes in association with changing wind fields and migrating ocean fronts. The Indian-Atlantic Ocean Gateway contains a pronounced oceanic frontal system, the position of which has the potential to influence global climate on millennial scales. Owing to the physical differences between the frontal zones, this region has complex biogeochemistry, changes in phytoplankton distribution, and variations in primary productivity. Site U1475 was cored on the Agulhas Plateau in the Southwestern Indian Ocean and recovered a complete sequence of calcareous ooze spanning the last 7 Ma. Previous studies at this locality have shown latitudinal migrations of the frontal zones over the past 350 kyr that resulted in prominent millennial shifts in primary production, biological pump efficiency, and microfossil assemblages that coincide with Antarctic climate variability. Here we present initial results comprised of calcareous nannoplankton assemblages in order to test if similar latitudinal frontal migrations occurred during the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition (PPT; 2.7 Ma). The calcareous nannoplankton assemblage shows an abundance increase of taxa associated with cooler water and higher primary production across the PPT interval. In addition to a change in species abudance, the Shannon diversity index drops notably across the transition, which is typical of nannoplankton communities in more productive regions. These data suggest that a long-term change in sea surface temperature and nutrient availability took place across the PPT, potentially linked to the northward migration of\n\nRib Geometry Explains Variation in Dynamic Structural Response: Potential Implications for Frontal Impact Fracture Risk.\n\nPubMed\n\nMurach, Michelle M; Kang, Yun-Seok; Goldman, Samuel D; Schafman, Michelle A; Schlecht, Stephen H; Moorhouse, Kevin; Bolte, John H; Agnew, Amanda M\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe human thorax is commonly injured in motor vehicle crashes, and despite advancements in occupant safety rib fractures are highly prevalent. The objective of this study was to quantify the ability of gross and cross-sectional geometry, separately and in combination, to explain variation of human rib structural properties. One hundred and twenty-two whole mid-level ribs from 76 fresh post-mortem human subjects were tested in a dynamic frontal impact scenario. Structural properties (peak force and stiffness) were successfully predicted (pÂ <Â 0.001) by rib cross-sectional geometry obtained via direct histological imaging (total area, cortical area, and section modulus) and were improved further when utilizing a combination of cross-sectional and gross geometry (robusticity, whole bone strength index). Additionally, preliminary application of a novel, adaptive thresholding technique, allowed for total area and robusticity to be measured on a subsample of standard clinical CT scans with varied success. These results can be used to understand variation in individual rib response to frontal loading as well as identify important geometric parameters, which could ultimately improve injury criteria as well as the biofidelity of anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) and finite element (FE) models of the human thorax.\n\nRib Geometry Explains Variation in Dynamic Structural Response: Potential Implications for Frontal Impact Fracture Risk\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMurach, Michelle M.; Kang, Yun-Seok; Goldman, Samuel D.; Schafman, Michelle A.; Schlecht, Stephen H.; Moorhouse, Kevin; Bolte, John H.; Agnew, Amanda M.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe human thorax is commonly injured in motor vehicle crashes, and despite advancements in occupant safety rib fractures are highly prevalent.

We show that using a rheology that incorporates brittle weakening of the lithosphere generates a region of enhanced mantle upwelling and elevated temperatures along the transform; the warmest temperatures and thinnest lithosphere are predicted to be near the center of the transform. Previous studies predicted that the mantle beneath oceanic transform faults is anomalously cold relative to adjacent intraplate regions, with the thickest lithosphere located at the center of the transform. These earlier studies used simplified rheologic laws to simulate the behavior of the lithosphere and underlying asthenosphere. We show that the warmer thermal structure predicted by our calculations is directly attributed to the inclusion of a more realistic brittle rheology. This temperature structure is consistent with a wide range of observations from ridge-transform environments, including the depth of seismicity, geochemical anomalies along adjacent ridge segments, and the tendency for long transforms to break into small intratransform spreading centers during changes in plate motion. ?? 2007 Geological Society of America.\n\nFrontal headache induced by osteoma of frontal recess.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Kyung Soo\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe reported a case of osteoma involving the frontal recess, which presented as frontal headache and reviewed literatures.

However, whether and how IC can be improved with training and the underlying neuroplastic mechanisms remains largely unresolved. We used functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging to measure the effects of 2 weeks of training with a Go/NoGo task specifically designed to improve frontal top-down IC mechanisms. The training-induced behavioral improvements were accompanied by a decrease in neural activity to inhibition trials within the right pars opercularis and triangularis, and in the left pars orbitalis of the inferior frontal gyri. Analyses of changes in brain anatomy induced by the IC training revealed increases in grey matter volume in the right pars orbitalis and modulations of white matter microstructure in the right pars triangularis. The task-specificity of the effects of training was confirmed by an absence of change in neural activity to a control working memory task. Our combined anatomical and functional findings indicate that differential patterns of functional and structural plasticity between and within inferior frontal gyri enhanced the speed of top-down inhibition processes and in turn IC proficiency. The results suggest that training-based interventions might help overcoming the anatomic and functional deficits of inferior frontal gyri manifesting in inhibition-related clinical conditions. More generally, we demonstrate how multimodal neuroimaging investigations of training-induced neuroplasticity enable revealing novel anatomo-functional dissociations within frontal executive brain networks.

The importance of the Gulf Stream frontal system in the selection of high residence time (HRT) areas by the North Atlantic leatherback turtle is assessed here for the first time using state-of-the-art ocean reanalysis products. Ten adult females from the Eastern French Guianese rookery were satellite tracked during post-nesting migration to relate (1) their horizontal movements to physical gradients (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Height (SSH) and filaments) and biological variables (micronekton and chlorophyll a), and (2) their diving behaviour to vertical structures within the water column (mixed layer, thermocline, halocline and nutricline). All the turtles migrated northward towards the Gulf Stream north wall. Although their HRT areas were geographically remote (spread between 80-30 Â°W and 28-45 Â°N), all the turtles targeted similar habitats in terms of physical structures, i.e. strong gradients of SST, SSH and a deep mixed layer. This close association with the Gulf Stream frontal system highlights the first substantial synchronization ever observed in this species, as the HRTs were observed in close match with the autumn phytoplankton bloom. Turtles remained within the enriched mixed layer at depths of 38.5Â±7.9 m when diving in HRT areas, likely to have an easier access to their prey and maximize therefore the energy gain. These depths were shallow in comparison to those attained within the thermocline (82.4Â±5.6 m) while crossing the nutrient-poor subtropical gyre, probably to reach cooler temperatures and save energy during the transit. In a context of climate change, anticipating the evolution of such frontal\n\nOceanic lithosphere and asthenosphere - Thermal and mechanical structure\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchubert, G.; Yuen, D. A.; Froidevaux, C.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nA coupled thermomechanical subsolidus model of the oceanic lithosphere and asthenosphere is developed which includes vertical heat conduction, a temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, heat advection by a horizontal and vertical mass flow that depends on depth and age, contributions of viscous dissipation or shear heating, a linear or nonlinear deformation law relating shear stress and strain rate, as well as a temperature- and pressure-dependent viscosity. The model requires a constant horizontal velocity and temperature at the surface, but zero horizontal velocity and constant temperature at great depths. The depth- and age-dependent temperature, horizontal and vertical velocities, and viscosity structure of the lithosphere and asthenosphere are determined along with the age-dependent shear stress in those two zones. The ocean-floor topography, oceanic heat flow, and lithosphere thickness are deduced as functions of ocean-floor age; seismic velocity profiles which exhibit a marked low-velocity zone are constructed from the age-dependent geotherms and assumed values of the elastic parameters. It is found that simple boundary-layer cooling determines the thermal structure at young ages, while effects of viscous dissipation become more important at older ages.\n\nMind the movement: Frontal asymmetry stands for behavioral motivation, bilateral frontal activation for behavior.\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrigues, Johannes; MÃ¼ller, Mathias; MÃ¼hlberger, Andreas; Hewig, Johannes\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFrontal asymmetry has been investigated over the past 30 years, and several theories have been developed about its meaning. The original theory of Davidson and its diversification by Harmon-Jones & Allen allocated approach motivation to relative left frontal brain activity and withdrawal motivation to relative right frontal brain activity. Hewig and colleagues extended this theory by adding bilateral frontal activation representing a biological correlate of the behavioral activation system if actual behavior is shown. Wacker and colleagues formulated a theory related to the revised reinforcement sensitivity theory by Gray & McNaughton. Here, relative left frontal brain activation represents the revised behavioral activation system and behavior, while relative right frontal brain activation represents the revised behavioral inhibition system, representing the experience of conflict. These theories were investigated with a newly developed paradigm where participants were able to move around freely in a virtual T maze via joystick while having their EEG recorded. Analyzing the influence of frontal brain activation during this virtual reality task on observable behavior for 30 participants, we found more relative left frontal brain activation during approach behavior and more relative right brain activation for withdrawal behavior of any kind. Additionally, there was more bilateral frontal brain activation when participants were engaged in behavior compared to doing nothing. Hence, this study provides evidence for the idea that frontal asymmetry stands for behavioral approach or avoidance motivation, and bilateral frontal activation stands for behavior. Additionally, observable behavior is not only determined by frontal asymmetry, but also by relevant traits.

E.; Qin, Y.; Villanueva-Robles, F.; Hananto, N.; Leclerc, F.; Singh, S. C.; Tapponnier, P.; Sieh, K.; Wei, S.; Carton, H. D.; Permana, H.; Avianto, P.; Nugroho, A. B.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe joint EOS/IPG/LIPI 2015 MegaTera expedition collected high-resolution seismic reflection profiles and bathymetric data across the Sunda trench, updip of the Mw7.7, 2010 Mentawai tsunami-earthquake rupture patch. These data reveal rapid lateral variations in both the stratigraphic level of the frontal Sunda megathrust and the vergence of frontal ramp faults. The stratigraphic depth of the megathrust at the deformation front correlates with ramp-thrust vergence and with changes in the basal friction angle inferred by critical-taper wedge theory. Where ramp thrusts verge uniformly seaward and have an average dip of 30Â°, the megathrust decollement resides atop a high-amplitude reflector that marks the inferred top of pelagic sediments. Where ramp thrusts are bi-vergent (similar throw on both landward- and seaward-vergent faults) and have an average dip of 42Â°, the decollement is higher, within the incoming clastic sequence, above a seismically transparent unit inferred to represent distal fan muds. Where ramp thrusts are uniformly landward vergent, the decollement sits directly on top of the oceanic crust that forms the bathymetrically prominent, subducting Investigator Ridge. The two, separate regions of large tsunamigenic ground-surface uplift during the 2010 tsunami earthquake that have been inferred from joint inversions of seismic, GPS, and tsunami data (e.g. Yue et al., 2014; Satake et al., 2013) correspond to the areas of frontal bi-vergence in the MegaTera data. We propose that enhanced surface uplift and tsunamigenesis during this event occurred when rupture propagated onto areas where the decollement sits directly above the basal muds of the incoming clastic sequence. Thus we hypothesize that frontal bi-vergence may mark areas of enhanced tsunami hazard posed by small magnitude, shallow megathrust ruptures that propagate to the trench.

Molecular phylogenetic analyses group the animal together with the Acoelomorpha, forming the Xenacoelomorpha. This group has been suggested to be either a sister group to the Nephrozoa or a deuterostome, and therefore it may provide important insights into origins of bilaterian traits such as an anus, the nephron, feeding larvae and centralized nervous systems. However, only five Xenoturbella species have been reported and the evolutionary history of xenoturbellids and Xenacoelomorpha remains obscure. Here we describe a new Xenoturbella species from the western Pacific Ocean, and report a new xenoturbellid structure - the frontal pore. Non-destructive microCT was used to investigate the internal morphology of this soft-bodied animal. This revealed the presence of a frontal pore that is continuous with the ventral glandular network and which exhibits similarities with the frontal organ in acoelomorphs. Our results suggest that large size, oval mouth, frontal pore and ventral glandular network may be ancestral features for Xenoturbella. Further studies will clarify the evolutionary relationship of the frontal pore and ventral glandular network of xenoturbellids and the acoelomorph frontal organ. One of the habitats of the newly identified species is easily accessible from a marine station and so this species promises to be valuable for research on bilaterian and deuterostome evolution.\n\nAssessment of frontal lobe sagging after endoscopic endonasal transcribriform resection of anterior skull base tumors: is rigid structural reconstruction of the cranial base defect necessary?\n\nPubMed\n\nEloy, Jean Anderson; Shukla, Pratik A; Choudhry, Osamah J; Singh, Rahul; Liu, James K\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe endoscopic endonasal transcribriform approach (EETA) is a viable alternative option for resection of selected anterior skull base (ASB) tumors. However, this technique results in the creation of large cribriform defects. Some have reported the use of a rigid substitute for ASB reconstruction to prevent postoperative frontal lobe sagging. We evaluate the degree of frontal lobe sagging using our triple-layer technique [fascia lata, acellular dermal allograft, and pedicled nasoseptal flap (PNSF)] without the use of rigid structural reconstruction for large cribriform defects. Retrospective analysis. Nine patients underwent an EETA for resection of large ASB tumors from August 2010 to November 2011. The degree of frontal lobe displacement after EETA, defined as the ASB position, was calculated based on the most inferior position of the frontal lobe relative to the nasion-sellar line defined on preoperative and postoperative imaging. A positive value signified upward displacement, and a negative value represented inferior displacement of the frontal lobe. The average cribriform defect size was 9.3 cm(2) (range, 5.0-13.8 cm(2) ). The average distance of postoperative frontal lobe displacement was 0.2 mm (range, -3.9 to 2.9 mm) without any cases of significant brain sagging. The mean follow-up period was 10.1 months (range, 4-19 months). There were no postoperative CSF leaks. Rigid structural repair may not be necessary for ASB defect repair after endoscopic endonasal resection of the cribriform plate. Our technique for multilayer cranial base reconstruction appears to be satisfactory in preventing delayed frontal lobe sagging.

This occurs through strong surface baroclinicity maintained by cross frontal SST gradient and deep vertical atmospheric motion due to convection on the warm flank of the WBC. However the additional role of mesoscale oceanic structures (30-300km) has not yet been explored although they have a non-negligible influence on surface heat fluxes. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model, we investigate the potential role of these oceanic eddies in the case of an idealized atmospheric mid-latitude storm track forced by a mesoscale oceanic eddy field superposed with a large-scale SST gradient. Surface latent and sensible fluxes are shown to react with a non-linear response to the SST variations, providing additional heat and moisture supply at large scales. The atmospheric response is not restricted to the boundary layer but reaches the free troposphere, especially through increased water vapor vertical transport and latent heat release. This additional heating in presence of eddies is balanced by a shift of the storm-track and its poleward heat flux toward high latitudes, with amplitude depending on atmospheric configuration and eddies amplitude. We also explore how this displacement of perturbations changes the position and structure of the mid-latitude jet through eddy momentum fluxes.\n\nBeyond the sniffer: frontal sinuses in Carnivora.\n\nPubMed\n\nCurtis, Abigail A; Van Valkenburgh, Blaire\n\n2014-11-01\n\nParanasal sinuses are some of the most poorly understood features of mammalian cranial anatomy. They are highly variable in presence and form among species, but their function is not well understood. The best-supported explanations for the function of sinuses is that they opportunistically fill mechanically unnecessary space, but that in some cases, sinuses in combination with the configuration of the frontal bone may improve skull performance by increasing skull strength and dissipating stresses more evenly. We used CT technology to investigate patterns in frontal sinus size and shape disparity among three families of carnivores: Canidae, Felidae, and Hyaenidae. We provide some of the first quantitative data on sinus morphology for these three families, and employ a novel method to quantify the relationship between three-dimensional sinus shape and skull shape. As expected, frontal sinus size and shape were more strongly correlated with frontal bone size and shape than with the morphology of the skull as a whole. However, sinus morphology was also related to allometric differences among families that are linked to biomechanical function. Our results support the hypothesis that frontal sinuses most often opportunistically fill space that is mechanically unnecessary, and they can facilitate cranial shape changes that reduce stress during feeding. Moreover, we suggest that the ability to form frontal sinuses allows species to modify skull function without compromising the performance of more functionally constrained regions such as the nasal chamber (heat/water conservation, olfaction), and braincase (housing the brain and sensory structures).

The OSSs presumably differ from the formerly found skeletal structures (SS) (Phys. Lett. A 306 (2002) 175) only by the fact that OSS are filled in with the closely packed blocks of a smaller size, up to capillary sizes. It is suggested [1] the dust produced by the volcanic activity forms the SS of powerful clouds due to of atmospheric electricity. The fall-out of such SSs on the oceanic surface is a material source of OSS. It is suggested that an OSS block [1] in the form of vertically oriented floating cylinder may be a stimulator of waterspout (WS). The main body of the WS may be interpreted as a special type of atmospheric aerosol dusty plasma, and its column - as a long-lived filament, being formed in the process of electric breakdown between the cloud and oceanic surface. The charged water drops aerosol may behave similar to microdust and lift upward to the cloud by the electrostatic force. Suggested a capillary-electrostatic model of the WS permits to interpret many effects connected with the WS.\n\nUpper-Ocean Thermal Structure and the Western North Pacific Category 5 Typhoons.

G.; Cammarano, F.; Panning, M. P.; StÃ¤hler, S. C.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nEarth's habitability depends critically on its interior structure and dynamics. Global redox cycles rely on Earth's mantle for continued flux of reduced materials (e.g., Hayes and Waldbauer 2006). Similarly, the habitability of ocean worlds must be understood in terms of their interior structure and evolution (Zolotov and Shock 2004, Hand et al. 2009, Nimmo and Pappalardo 2016, Vance et al. 2016). Combined seismology, gravity, and magnetic investigations may be able to distinguish between a hot active interior and a cold dead one. To evaluate such investigations, we are developing detailed models of interior density, elastic and anelastic structure, and associated seismic sources and signatures, building on prior work (Cammarano et al. 2006). We will present self-consistent 1-D structural models for ocean world interiors that use available thermodynamic data for fluids, ices, and rocks. Cammarano, F., V. Lekic, M. Manga, M.
