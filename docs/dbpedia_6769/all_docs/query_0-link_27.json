        "text": "This article explores the many fantastic things to do in Torrance (Los Angeles County), California!\n\nHave you heard of Torrance?\n\nThis city, located in Los Angeles’ South Bay, is known for its cultural and ethnic diversity. As a consequence, it is an exciting place to explore (think beaches, eateries, and markets) when visiting Southern California.\n\nThis comprehensive guide will give you all the reasons to start planning a visit to Torrance.\n\nPlease note: This article contains affiliate links, meaning I may earn a commission if you make a purchase by clicking a link. Of course, this comes at no extra cost to you and helps me to keep offering solid information to readers.\n\nThings to Do in Torrance\n\nAs a city of more than 147,000 residents, believe me when I say Torrance has a plethora of attractions, facilities, and open spaces available to the public. What follows is my local perspective on the best things to do in Torrance.\n\nStroll Around Old Town\n\nIn the early 1900s, a real estate mogul called James Sydney Torrance took the chance to develop a community south of Los Angeles.\n\nHis investment paid off since the area incorporated as the City of Torrance in 1921 and grew in size through annexing different pieces of land.\n\nThe original planned community survives in what is known as Old Town. The quiet streets are sprinkled with businesses, residences, trees, parks, and monuments to local heroes.\n\nI visit the area mainly to eat. My husband and I love By Brazil, a churrasqueria known for its home cooking and flavorful meat, chicken, and pork cuts. We save money by taking advantage of the lunch special (about $20 per person).\n\nWe were beyond excited when Madre Oaxacan Restaurant opened in the area. We adore Oaxacan food and it is great to have tlayudas, mole negro, and tasajo close to home.\n\nFor breakfast, we go to Eat at Rudy’s. For pastries (and donuts, ahem), we go to the Torrance Bakery. We meet with friends at Red Car. For something different, I recommend visiting the Chado Tea Room. Try one of their blossoming teas.\n\nAfter lunch or dinner, stroll around the streets or pay a visit to Del Prado Park.\n\nJoin a Walking Tour\n\nEvery 4th Sunday of the month, the Torrance Historical Society offers a free tour of Old Town Torrance. The 90-minute tour will take you to several landmarks and expand your knowledge about the city.\n\nNote: The tour is offered from May to October. Confirm details a couple of days before the tour date.\n\nVisit a Popular Filming Location\n\nTV and movie fans will be interested in knowing that Torrance High School has been featured in several well-known productions.\n\nThe building gained notoriety for serving as the high school on the popular Beverly Hills, 90210 series. In addition, its facade and patio have been part of TV shows such as Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Medium and movies such as She’s All That and Bruce Almighty.\n\nEnter Bivalve Paradise at The Jolly Oyster Market\n\nWhen I told my husband, I was writing an article about things to do in Torrance, he told me not to forget about The Jolly Oyster. Then, he repeated the same thing 20 times.\n\nPer my husband’s mandate, I am suggesting you visit this market specializing in oysters, clams, and crab claws. They have a big local following and excellent reviews.\n\nActually, this brand started with a truck at the San Buenaventura State Beach (in Ventura, 70 miles north of Los Angeles). We used to stop when driving back from Santa Barbara. My husband was elated when they opened a market in our backyard.\n\nNote: They also serve oysters at Smorgasbord LA, an eating extravaganza taking place every Sunday in Downtown Los Angeles.\n\nGet in Touch with Nature at the Madrona Marsh Preserve\n\nThe Madrona Marsh showcases the marshland that used to cover the coastal plains of Southern California. Most of these areas were drained in order to develop living and business complexes. Therefore, this marsh is a rare example of how things used to be.\n\nThe place provides a habitat for birds, insects, frogs, reptiles, and small mammals. In addition, it is a stop for migrating birds.\n\nThe preserve is open to the public every day (except Monday) from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. An on-site nature center provides information about the creatures calling home the area and facilitates different types of activities (hikes, workshops, etc.)\n\nSpend the Day at the Beach\n\nA lot of people mention the beach cities of Los Angeles County (Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, and Redondo Beach) but they do not realize Torrance has 1.5 miles of beachfront.\n\nThe long stretch of sand between the Redondo Pier and the Palos Verdes Peninsula is shared between Redondo Beach and Torrance. The Torrance part starts south of Miramar Park (where Esplanade meets Paseo de la Playa).\n\nThis beach is less hectic than others in the South Bay so, it is a good place to spend the day without having to share your space with hundreds of people. In season, there is a cafe and beach rental shack on-site. The other nice thing is that the Riviera Village, an area with more than 20 restaurants, is located a couple of blocks away.\n\nAlso, keep in mind Torrance Beach is the terminus of the Marvin Braude Bike Trail. This 22-mile paved way starts at Will Rogers State Beach and continues through Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Marina del Rey, and other beach cities. Since you are on Torrance Beach, you can use the trail to bike to nearby beach cities. I love to ride along this trail!\n\nEnjoy a Bit of Japan at Mitsuwa Marketplace\n\nMitsuwa is a supermarket chain with one of the largest selections of imported Japanese goods in the United States. However, this place is more than a supermarket. They sell electronics cosmetics and pharmaceutical goods. And, we cannot forget to mention the food court serving everything from ramen to tempura.\n\nYou can spend a decent amount of time browsing the halls and taking advantage of the samples (usually during the weekends). If you feel hungry, you either can grab something at the prepared food section (the selection is mind-blowing) or pick a stall at the food court. I always take several things home to eat later.\n\nThe other cool thing is that Mitsuwa has different “fairs” featuring dishes from the different prefectures of Japan or a specific ingredient. This is a good opportunity to learn more about the culture of the country.\n\nNote: Seiwa, S-Mart, and Hmart are other grocery stores selling Asian goods.\n\nPhoto by Nandano\n\nStop by the Best Farmers Market Ever\n\nMany farmers’ markets in the Los Angeles area get tons of rave reviews. I am not sure if it is local pride but, in my opinion, they are not as good as Torrance Farmers Market.\n\nThis market is huge! They have products from 60 farms plus flowers, honey, baked goods, nuts, candy, fish, eggs, prepared food, an international food court, and live music. You have the opportunity to sample a lot of different things and try things you have never tried before. Come hungry because you will need space in your stomach to tackle all the offerings.\n\nThe market takes place every Tuesday and Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at Charles H. Wilson Park. Please support small businesses by buying from one or more vendors.\n\nHunt for an Antique Treasure\n\nIf you enjoy browsing for antiques and unique objects in a lively environment, then you have to stop by the Torrance Antique Street Faire.\n\nThis monthly event (4th Sunday) gathers 200 vendors and attracts thousands to Old Town Torrance. The fair has been going strong for 20 years and it is a South Bay favorite. Bring the entire family to this fun event. Admission and parking are free.\n\nIf you are not in town for the event, you can visit the fair’s store at 1317 Sartori Avenue (in Old Town).\n\nShop at the Roadium Open Air Market\n\nThe Roadium can be described as a swap meet or flea market (even though it is “officially” an open-air market). I am pretty sure you are familiar with the concept but, if not, this is a place where used objects are sold or exchanged. Offerings can be new or never used. The idea is to acquire a good at a lower price than usual.\n\nThe Roadium covers a big space and it is well organized. You can find cosmetics, perfumes, clothes, shoes, and bags as well as automotive, gardening, locksmithing, and hardware store items.\n\nThe market is opened daily but the biggest number of vendors set up stalls during the weekends. Admission is $1 – $2. Additional parking can be found at a lot, located at the intersection of Redondo Beach Boulevard and Crenshaw Boulevard. A free shuttle transports shoppers to the market’s entrance.\n\nVisit a Museum\n\nIf your preferences are along with the art, history, and culture subjects, it is possible to sharpen your knowledge of those areas by visiting one of the museums in the city of Torrance.\n\nYou have the following options:\n\nTorrance Art Museum – focuses on the contemporary art of Southern California. Admission is free.\n\nCalifornia Museum of Fine Art – museum and gallery showcasing works of global artists. Opened from Wednesday to Saturday (afternoons)\n\nTorrance Historical Society – offers local exhibits and archives. Open from Wednesday to Saturday (afternoons).\n\nWestern Museum of Flight – aviation museum located at Torrance’s Municipal Airport. Opened Tuesday to Sunday. Admission is $5.\n\nChen Art Gallery – houses one of the most important Chinese art collections in the United States. Opened Tuesday to Friday. Admission is free.\n\nGo Brewery Hopping\n\nTorrance is one of the leaders of the craft beer movement in Los Angeles. I am not sure if another city in the area has as many breweries as Torrance.\n\nThese breweries are usually located in an industrial zone and facilities are warehouse style. Most places are “bring your own food” (or snacks). Sometimes, a food truck makes a stop or a taquero is serving delicious morsels.\n\nI am not a beer drinker, so I cannot really tell you which place is better. You will need to find out for yourself. But, let me tell you that the places I am mentioning below are alive, thriving, and expanding. Therefore, they must be good.\n\nSmog City Brewing, Monkish Brewing, Cosmic Brewery, The Dudes’ Brewing, and The Strand Brewing are located very not that far from one another (less than a mile).\n\nNot far away, in Old Town Torrance, you have Red Car Restaurant & Brewery and Yorkshire Square Brewery. Absolution Brewing Company and Scholb Premium Ales are located west of the other breweries.\n\nStanding by itself, next to a 99 Cents store, you will find Hop Saint. The food here is phenomenal.\n\nRead More: Torrance Breweries\n\nGet Transported to Germany (Or Central Europe)\n\nIf you have visited Germany, Hungary, Austria, Czechia, and other countries in Central Europe, you wonder how you will survive without sausages, sauerkraut, and goulash once you get back home.\n\nWell, in my case, I almost cried with happiness when I entered the Alpine Village. The market sells about 30 types of sausages (some prepared on-site), potato dumplings, spaetzle, pickled items, and much more. They also have a bakery, cafe, and deli.\n\nThose looking for a more involved experience can visit the restaurant bratwurst, beef goulash, Weiner schnitzel, cold salads, hot dishes, and desserts. I cannot recommend this place enough!\n\nBring the Entire Family to Mulligan\n\nMulligan caters to families who enjoy go-carts, batting cages, miniature golf, rock walls, video games, and similar attractions. Most visitors buy an all-day pass and spend the entire day at the facilities.\n\nTo make the most of the pass, some families visit in the afternoon, go out to eat (or go home to rest a bit) and then return during the evening to do some more attractions.\n\nBefore paying full price for an all-day pass, check websites such as Groupon to score a discount.\n\nGet Moving at One of the City’s Parks\n\nLike any big city, Torrance has a wide array of open spaces designated for the public’s enjoyment. Several parks have running, volleyball, basketball, baseball, tennis, swimming, playground, and picnicking facilities.\n\nMy friends and I have celebrated so many events in the city’s parks. The best thing is that they can be visited all year round (thanks to the beautiful weather we have).\n\nI recommend the following:\n\nCharles H. Wilson Park (where the farmers market takes place)\n\nWilson Park\n\nColumbia Regional Park\n\nLos Arboles Rocketship Park\n\nLago Seco Park\n\nShopping in Torrance\n\nIt is very difficult to compete with Torrance in terms of shopping. The selection of shopping centers is huge!\n\nThe most notorious shopping complex is Del Amo Fashion Center (or Fashion Center Torrance). The centerpiece of the complex is a mall with 2,600,00 sq ft of retail space (that makes it one of the largest malls in the US). It has about 250 stores, a food court, restaurants, and a movie theater.\n\nBut, it is not only the mall. The actual structure is surrounded by even more stores and restaurants. For example, there is a nearby shopping center called Village del Amo.\n\nPhoto by Rjung2k\n\nIn addition, there are other centers such as Torrance Crossroads Shopping Center, Plaza Mayor Shopping Center, Torrance Promenade, and Torrance Towne Center.\n\nThings to Do Near Torrance\n\nUff, as you have noticed, there are so many places to go in. However, if you want are interested in visiting more places around the area, you will not go wrong by stopping by the following places:\n\nThings to Do in the South Bay\n\nThings to Do in Manhattan Beach\n\nThings to Do in El Segundo\n\nThings to Do in Hermosa Beach\n\nThings to Do in Redondo Beach\n\nPalos Verdes Peninsula Hikes, Coves and Views\n\nAbalone Cove Shoreline Park\n\nPortuguese Bend Reserve\n\nOf course, you can enjoy the many attractions of Los Angeles and Orange County while in Torrance.\n\nFind out how to spend one fun-filled day in Los Angeles\n\nGet inspiration by reading my Los Angeles Ultimate Bucket List\n\nVenice Beach Murals\n\n150+ Places to Go in Orange County\n\nOrange County Beach Towns\n\nTorrance Restaurants\n\nIn this section, I want to highlight some of my favorite restaurants in the city.\n\nKings Hawaiian\n\nWhen in Torrance, do not skip King’s Hawaiian, a restaurant, and bakery famous for its baked goods (above all, their sweet dinner rolls). They have so much stuff! I love their burgers, French toast, banana mac berry pie, Hawaiian paradise cake, and pineapple tres leches. It would be madness not to stop by!\n\nPhoto by Sam Howzit\n\nGen Korean BBQ House\n\nThis Korean BBQ place has a nice selection of meat, chicken, seafood, and vegetables. Everything tastes better when combined with their dipping sauces. Try to take advantage of their lunch specials. It is very difficult to get in in the evenings and weekends. Get ready to wait an hour or more if you visit those times/days.\n\nHoff’s Hut Restaurant & Bakery\n\nI have lost count of the numbers of parties, birthdays, and showers I have attended at Hoff’s Hut. This local favorite serves comfort food, steaks, ribs, and a killer breakfast (all day). You can end things with a pie, cake cheesecake or sundae.\n\nGiuliano’s\n\nNot sure if you are noticing a trend here but seems like I prefer places that serve great food and wonderful sweets under the same roof. Giuliano’s is not the exception.\n\nThis Italian restaurant and market have on the menu Roman-style pizzas, plates of pasta (I am crazy about the lasagna), cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches (the meatball for me, please!), salads and soups. They have a very nice bakery section too. I find the prices affordable compared to other places in the area.\n\nNew York Deli\n\nThis is the place to go for monstrous sandwiches! Locals know this and pack the place on evenings and weekends. My husband and I like to share a matzo ball soup. He orders the pastrami or corned beef sandwich. I like the turkey breast or brisket sandwiches. We usually take home half of our sandwiches. We get stuffed in here quickly.\n\nJJ Squared Bakery\n\nThis is the place to get Asian baked goods. To be honest, everything I have liked everything I have tried from here. Among my favorites are the Portuguese tarts, Danish almond, chicken pie, and almond brittle.\n\nBlue Salt Fish Grill\n\nI cannot talk about Torrance restaurants without mentioning the Blue Salt Fish Grill. They started with a restaurant in North Redondo and expanded to Torrance.\n\nThey specialized in made to order fish and prepared seafood dishes. I go for the grilled salmon with couscous and coleslaw. Their prices are fantastic given the quality and flavor of the food.\n\nIn-N-Out\n\nIf you have never been to California, or do not visit often, then you have to visit one of our icons. In-n-Out has been serving fresh burgers, fries, and shakes for 70 years. The hype has not died down. The place is as popular as ever.\n\nIf you want to order like a local, ask for your burger or fries (or both) animal style (this is not on the menu). They will add melted cheese, onions and spread to them. My friends also order burgers with three and four patties.\n\nPhoto by Punctuated\n\nTorrance Location\n\nTorrance is located 16 miles from the Los Angeles International Airport, 20 miles from Downtown Los Angeles, 20 miles from Santa Monica, and 18 miles from Venice Beach.\n\nAs you can see, Torrance has a centric location. It can be used as a base for day trips to popular attractions in Los Angeles. But, you will not be in the middle of the madness that Los Angeles can be.\n\nAlso, this is a place with easy access to the Pacific Coast Highway (CA-1 or Highway One). It can easily be added to any San Francisco to San Diego road trip.\n\nSightseeing Gear\n\nGet ready for a day of sightseeing by bringing the right gear. Here is a list of the items I pack to explore cities and towns in California.\n\nWalking Shoes – Comfortable walking shoes are a must. I recommend investing in a good pair. My go-to brands are Clarks, Tevas, and Sketchers.\n\nAnti-Theft Bag – Keep your belongings safe by keeping them in an anti-theft bag. The ones manufactured by Travelon have a 5-points security system including an RFID blocking pocket. >>Check out their crossbody bag here If you prefer a backpack, this one is a good option\n\nSweatshirt – A sweatshirt is a must to keep me warm during chilly mornings and nights. >Click to see this California appropriate option here\n\nSun Block – Do not leave the house (or the car) without applying sunblock. I repeat, always wear sunblock when outdoors. >Buy sunblock here\n\nLip Balm with Sunscreen – Protect your lips by applying a balm with sunscreen. >Get one of the best lip balms here\n\nWide Brim Hat – A wide brim hat is a great way to protect your scalp, face, and neck. The ones manufactured by FURTALK come with an anti-UV function. >Buy this amazing hat here\n\nHand Sanitizer – Do not forget to pack hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes.\n\nSunglasses – These are another must when it comes to protecting from the sun. A polarized, sporty pair works better outdoors. >Take a look at this wonderful pair\n\nWater Bottle – Do not forget to bring water! Keep yours cold by taking a beautiful Hydro Flask water bottle. >Check out the insane options here\n\nTHERMOS Tumblers – I have been a fan of the THERMOS brand since I received a tumbler as a gift. The tumblers keep drinks hot for hours. >>Buy THERMOS insulated tumblers here\n\nCamera – I have never gotten used to taking pictures exclusively with my phone. I prefer to use the Sony Alpha a6000. It is compact and takes gorgeous pictures. >Buy Sony Camera here\n\nTripod – A compact tripod to take your photos and videos to a different level. >>Check out this popular option here\n\nPortable Power Bank – It is a pain to keep phones charged on trips (more if you are taking pictures, posting on social media, and navigating). Having a power bank is a lifesaver. The Anker portable charger can charge a phone 5 times. >Buy this incredible power bank here\n\nFrequently Asked Question\n\nHere are some frequent questions I get with respect to what to do in Torrance.\n\nWhat are some free things to do in Torrance?\n\nThere are plenty of options when it comes to free things to do in Torrance. For example, you can check out the Old Town, stop by the Madrona Marsh, have a picnic at a park, spend a day at the beach and visit a museum for free.\n\nAlso, you can enjoy Torrance’s outstanding diverse vibe by stopping by the farmers market, antique faire, or local supermarkets.\n\nKeep in mind you may need to pay a fee to park at some attractions (like the beach).\n\nWhat are some Japanese things to do in Torrance?\n\nTorrance is associated with all things Japanese since the US headquarters of the big Japanese automotive companies are located (or were located) here (Toyota moved to Texas but Honda is still in Torrance).\n\nSo, Torrance is a great place to eat Japanese food. Favorites include Inaba (sushi), Ichimiann (soba and udon), Torihei, Kagura, Izakaya Hachi, King Shabu Shabu and Shin Sen Gumi (ramen).\n\nFoodies should also check Mitsuwa, Seiwa, S-Mart, Tokyo Central, Nijiya Market, and Hmart. These stores go beyond groceries. They offer prepared food, cosmetics, clothing, and other good.\n\nWhat are some outdoor things to do in Torrance?\n\nOutdoor activities include Old Town Torrance, the city beach and parks, the farmers market, the Roadium, and different events.\n\nKeep in mind many restaurants and breweries have outdoor patios.\n\nWhat are some things to do in Torrance at night?\n\nThere are plenty of places in Torrance offering a wide array of cocktails, beer, and wine. You can choose among places such as Torrance Tavern, Keegan’s Sports Lounge, High N Dry Cocktails, The Roadhouse Bar, and The Branch Office.\n\nYou can also head to nearby Hermosa Beach (to be specific, the Pier Plaza). Hermosa is the party city of the South Bay).\n\nWhat are some things to do in Gardena?\n\nGardena is adjacent to Torrance. A lot of times, you are driving around and you lose track if you are in Gardena or Torrance. So, it makes sense to include some things to do in this city.\n\nIn Gardena, you can have incredible Japanese food as well. I like to visit the shopping center located at the corner of Western Avenue and Redondo Beach Boulevard. There are plenty of Japanese restaurants to try plus Vietnamese, Thai, and poke restaurants as well. In addition, I like places as Boling Point, Honeymee and It’s Boba Time.\n\nThe Gardena Willows Wetland Preserve, Gardena Bowling Center, and Sky Zone Trampoline Park are fun places to visit as well.\n\nWhat other fun things to do in Torrance do you recommend?
