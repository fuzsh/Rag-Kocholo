        "text": "CANCELLATION: AJ Michalka will not be attending WasabiCon 2017\n\nUPDATE: Sometimes things don’t always work as planned… Due to an unforeseen professional commitment, AJ Michalka will not be able to attend WasabiCon 2017. We wish her the best, and hope she can join us at a future date.\n\nAJ Michalka, 25, has demonstrated her talent and versatility as a successful actress, musician, and songwriter. At her young age, Ms. Michalka carries a reputation as a tremendous actress, developing strong relationships with directors such as J.J. Abrams and Peter Jackson. In 2010 she starred opposite Diane Lane and John Malkovich in the Walt Disney Pictures feature film SECRETARIAT, based on the life story of Penny Chenery, owner of the racehorse Secretariat, who won the Triple Crown in 1973. She then went on to shoot the much anticipated J.J. Abrams film SUPER 8, released in 2011.\n\nMs. Michalka also co-starred in the Paramount Pictures feature film THE LOVELY BONES alongside Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz and Saoirse Ronan. The film, directed by Academy Award winner Peter Jackson, is an adaptation of the bestselling novel about a young girl who has been murdered and is watching over her family and friends from heaven.\n\nMs. Michalka began her acting career with several roles in television. She starred in the CBS series THE GUARDIAN for two seasons as well as the Fox series OLIVER BEENE. She also starred in the Disney Channel film COW BELLES, the Disney pilot HAVERSHAM HALL, and the MTV original movie, SUPER SWEET SIXTEEN: THE MOVIE. AJ recently guest starred on HBO’s SILICON VALLEY and can be seen as a series regular on THE GOLDBERGS for ABC.\n\nShe starred in the independent feature film ANGELS IN STARDUST and served as a co-producer on the film, which was taken to the Cannes Film Festival. She then starred in Lionsgateʼs GRACE UNPLUGGED, playing the eponymous Grace Trey opposite Kevin Pollak and James Denton.\n\nIn addition to singing and songwriting, Ms. Michalka is an accomplished musician, playing guitar, piano and percussion. As a member of Aly & AJ, she released two hit albums with Hollywood Records, helping Ms. Michalka and her sister Aly become platinum-selling recording artists at a very young age. In 2006, Aly & AJ were nominated for their first American Music Award. They have written all of the songs on their two hit records, and their holiday release ACOUSTIC HEARTS OF WINTER was one of the best-selling Christmas albums of 2006. Their hit single, POTENTIAL BREAKUP SONG, was noted in Time Magazine as one of the Top 10 Songs of the Year for 2007 and has been RIAA certified with sales of more than one million downloads. The music video for the single has scored over 62 million views on Youtube.\n\nThe duo contributed to the soundtracks for the films THE GAME PLAN, HERBIE FULLY LOADED, ICE PRINCESS, BANDSLAM, as well as writing the theme song for the CW television drama HELLCATS. Separately, Ms. Michalka recorded ITʼS WHO YOU ARE, the theme song for her film SECRETARIAT, also filming the accompanying music video. She recorded four songs for the GRACE UNPLUGGED soundtrack.\n\nShe recently starred in EXPECTING AMISH for Lifetime and recurs as the voice of “Stevonnie” in STEVEN UNIVERSE. One of her most incredible endeavors to date is the film she produced and stars in alongside her sister Aly, called WEEPAH WAY FOR NOW, which follows two 20-something sisters as they spend their last week before their next music tour wandering through the heart of Laurel Canyon. The film was released on June 17th on iTunes.\n\nAJ can currently be seen as ‘Lainey Lewis’ on ABC’s hit comedy, THE GOLDBERGS, opposite Jeff Garlin and Wendi McLendon-Covey.\n\nMs. Michalka currently resides in Los Angeles."
