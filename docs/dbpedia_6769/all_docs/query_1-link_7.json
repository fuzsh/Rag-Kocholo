        "text": "City in CaliforniaTemplate:SHORTDESC:City in California\n\nTorrance is a U.S. city in the South Bay (southwestern) region of Los Angeles County, California in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Torrance has 1.5 miles (2.4 km) of beaches on the Pacific Ocean. Torrance has a moderate year-round climate with warm temperatures, sea breezes, low humidity, and an average rainfall of 12.55 inches per year.[8]\n\nSince its incorporation in 1921, Torrance has grown to a 2013 estimated population of 147,000.[6] This residential and light high-tech industries city has 90,000 street trees and 30 city parks.[8] Known for its low crime rates, the city consistently ranks among the safest cities in Los Angeles County.[9] Torrance is the birthplace of the American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO). In addition, Torrance has the second-highest percentage of residents of Japanese ancestry in California (8.9%).[10]\n\nHistory[]\n\nTorrance was originally part of the Tongva Native American homeland for thousands of years. In 1784 the Spanish land grant for Rancho San Pedro, in the upper Las Californias Province of New Spain and encompassing present day Torrance, was issued to Juan Jose Dominguez by King Carlos III – the Spanish Empire.[11][12] It was later divided in 1846 with Governor Pío Pico granting Rancho de los Palos Verdes to José Loreto and Juan Capistrano Sepulveda, in the Alta California territory of independent Mexico.[13][14]\n\nIn the early 1900s, real estate developer Jared Sidney Torrance and other investors saw the value of creating a mixed industrial-residential community south of Los Angeles. They purchased part of an old Spanish land grant and hired landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. to design a planned community.[15] The resulting town was founded in October 1912 and named after Mr. Torrance. The city of Torrance was formally incorporated in May 1921, the townsite initially being bounded by Western Avenue on the east, Del Amo Boulevard on the north, Crenshaw Boulevard on the west, and on the south by Plaza Del Amo east of where it meets Carson Street, and by Carson Street west of where it meets Plaza Del Amo.[16] The first residential avenue created in Torrance was Gramercy and the second avenue was Andreo. Many of the houses on these avenues turned 100 years of age in 2012. Both avenues are located in the area referred to as Old Town Torrance. This section of Torrance is under review to be classified as a historical district.[17] Some of the early civic and residential buildings were designed by the renowned and innovative Southern California architect Irving Gill, in his distinctive combining of Mission Revival and early Modernist architecture.[18]\n\nGeography[]\n\nTorrance is a coastal community in southwestern Los Angeles County sharing the climate and geographical features common to the Greater Los Angeles area. Its boundaries are: Redondo Beach Boulevard and the cities of Lawndale and Gardena to the north; Western Avenue and the Harbor Gateway neighborhood of Los Angeles to the east; the Palos Verdes Hills with the cities of Lomita, Rolling Hills Estates and Palos Verdes Estates on the south; and the Pacific Ocean and city of Redondo Beach to the west.[19]\n\nIt is about 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Downtown Los Angeles.[20]\n\nTorrance Beach lies between Redondo Beach and Malaga Cove on Santa Monica Bay.[21] The southernmost stretch of Torrance Beach, on a cove at the northern end of the Palos Verdes peninsula, is known to locals as Rat Beach (Right After Torrance).\n\nAn urban wetlands, the Madrona Marsh, is a nature preserve on land once set for oil production and saved from development, with restoration projects enhancing the vital habitat for birds, wildlife, and native plants.[22][23] A Nature center provides activities, information, and classes for school children and visitors of all ages.[24]\n\nClimate[]\n\nTorrance has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csb), closely bordering a subtropical highland climate (Köppen: Cwb).\n\nThe rainy season is November through March, as shown in the adjacent table.[25]\n\nSummers tend to be warm and humid due to Torrance's proximity to the coast, making it the ideal weather for swimming. [26]\n\nThe Los Angeles area is also subject to the phenomenon typical of a microclimate. As such, the temperatures can vary as much as 18 °F (10 °C) between inland areas and the coast, with a temperature gradient of over 1 °F per mile (0.3 °C/km) from the coast inland. California has also a weather phenomenon called \"June Gloom or May Gray\", which sometimes brings overcast or foggy skies in the morning on the coast, followed by sunny skies by noon during late spring and early summer.\n\nDemographics[]\n\nHistorical populations Census Pop. %± 19307,271—19409,950 36.8%195022,241 123.5%1960100,991 354.1%1970134,968 33.6%1980129,881 −3.8%1990133,107 2.5%2000137,946 3.6%2010145,438 5.4%Est. 2016147,195[7] 1.2%U.S. Decennial Census[28]\n\n2010[]\n\nThe 2010 United States Census[29] reported that Torrance had a population of 145,438.

The city has headquarters of Japanese automakers and offices of other Japanese companies.[20] Because of this many Japanese restaurants and other Japanese cultural offerings are in the city, and Willy Blackmore of L.A. Weekly wrote that Torrance was \"essentially Japan's 48th prefecture\".[33] A Mitsuwa supermarket, Japanese schools, and Japanese banks serve the community.[20]\n\nIn the pre-World War II period the South Bay region was one of the few areas that allowed non-U.S. citizens to acquire property, so a Japanese presence came. According to John Kaji, a Torrance resident quoted in Public Radio International who was the son of Toyota's first American-based accountant, the Japanese corporate presence in Torrance, beginning with Toyota, attracted many ethnic Japanese. Toyota moved its operations to its Torrance campus in 1982 because of its proximity to the Port of Long Beach and Los Angeles International Airport, and it was followed by many other Japanese companies. In 2014 Toyota announced it was moving its U.S. headquarters to Plano, Texas.[20]\n\nKoreans[]\n\nSee also: History of the Korean Americans in Los Angeles\n\nAs of 1992 about 60% of the Korean population in the South Bay region lived in Torrance and Gardena.[34] In 1990, 5,888 ethnic Koreans lived in Torrance, a 256% increase from the 1980 figure of 1,652 ethnic Koreans.[35]\n\nEconomy[]\n\nTorrance is home to the U.S. headquarters of Japanese automaker American Honda Motor Company.

The current mall was created when Del Amo Center, built in 1958, merged with Del Amo Fashion Square, built in 1972. Once located on opposite sides of Carson Street, a gigantic expansion of the mall spanning Carson Street joined the two centers by 1982, making it the largest mall in the world at the time. In 2005, the east end of the original mall north of Carson Street was demolished to make way for a new open-air shopping center, opened in mid-September, 2006.

Though the oil wells are not as common as they once were, the Torrance Refinery Oil refinery owned by PBF Energy in the north end of the city is responsible for much of Southern California's gasoline supply. Torrance was also an important hub and shop site of the Pacific Electric Railway.[38]\n\nTorrance has a general aviation airport, originally named simply \"Torrance Airport\" and since renamed Zamperini Field after local track star, World War II hero and Torrance High graduate Louis Zamperini. The airport handles approximately 175,000 annual take-offs and landings (473 per day),[39] down from the 1974 record of 428,000 operations. Airport noise abatement is a major local issue. In 2007 the Western Museum of Flight moved to Zamperini Field.[citation needed]\n\nTorrance is also home to the main bakery facility for King's Hawaiian, the dominant brand of Hawaiian bread in North America.[40] Younger Optics, Torrance's 10th-largest employer, is credited[by whom?] with creating the first seamless or \"invisible\" bifocal, a precursor to all progressive lenses.\n\nThe headquarters of Mitsuwa Marketplace[41] and Nijiya Market[42] are located in Torrance,\n\nOperations of foreign companies[]\n\nAll Nippon Airways operates its United States headquarters, a customer relations and services office, in Torrance.[43]\n\nToyota opened its first overseas office in Hollywood in 1957, and sold 257 cars in the U.S.[when?] It moved Toyota Motor Sales USA operations to Torrance in 1982, because of easy access to port facilities and the LAX airport.
