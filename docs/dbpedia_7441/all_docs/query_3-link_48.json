        "text": "“Are we going to appall you with something confidential and disgusting? Let’s hope so.”\n\nSo begins the trailer for the movie Amadeus, which you can watch here.\n\nAmadeus tells the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s professional life from the point of view of his rival, composer Antonio Salieri. Salieri narrates a tale that takes you through the different beginnings each man had, and how they wound up at the same palace in competing positions. This film also addresses the question of whether or not Salieri murdered Mozart.\n\nThis film is absolutely wonderful. The acting is superb, the settings are elaborate, the costumes are beautiful, and the music is, of course, top-notch. The only drawback to this film is the lack of historical accuracy. However, while this may not be anyone’s biography, it is still one of the best movies I have ever seen.\n\nDid you know that F. Murray Abraham (Salieri) and Tom Hulce (Mozart) took lessons while filming so they could learn how to conduct and play the piano?\n\nAlso, the director chose relatively unknown actors (at the time) to play the roles because he wanted viewers to be able to think of the characters as actual people, not famous actors pretending to be characters.\n\nSetting: The second-half of 18th-century Vienna.\n\nWas this movie based on something? It was based on a play, also called Amadeus. The plots of both are very similar.\n\nWhat is this movie rated? R for brief nudity.\n\nIs there any objectionable content? Yes, including, but not limited to, sexual content, crude jokes, on-screen deaths, and some violence. There are also scenes involving Salieri questioning and rejecting his religion.\n\nCan children watch this? Not recommended for anyone younger than a teenager.\n\nWhat themes are found in the movie? Religious devotion, music, rivalries, and the line between madness and genius.\n\nWho would like this? Anyone who enjoys watching historical fiction, or who enjoys Mozart’s music. It is also great for people who love movies that have a lot of depth to them.\n\nRating: Five stars.\n\nThis movie is available as both a DVD and Blu-ray. And don’t forget to check out the soundtrack!"
