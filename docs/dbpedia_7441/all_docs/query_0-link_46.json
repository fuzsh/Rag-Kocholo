        "text": "Try to leap back into the 1980â€™s if you can. Thereâ€™s wood panelling everywhere. MTV has taken off. Video games can be played at home with gaudy joysticks (which eventually became better suited controllers). Computers with black screens and that deep green text were changing how businesses were run. Synths were played everywhere. Fashion was bright, to combat the greys, beiges and browns of home decor and technology. Then, there was the film scene, commonly skewered because of the allowance of franchises and Oscar bait formulas (which managed to succeed many times this decade). Thereâ€™s also the nostalgic side of things, considering the brand new PG-13 rating which allowed youths to venture forth and see some edgier material if permitted by their parents (as well as the many films that millennials grew up on that still get cherished to this day).\n\nHowever, letâ€™s not get too dark with the â€˜80s film scenes. I know that the â€˜80s gets a bad reputation, and I have decided that is simply not fair. If anything, the cinema of this decade is outstanding. If you have a problem with the â€˜80s, youâ€™re not looking in the right spots. I managed to find way more than one hundred candidates for my best-of list (I had to cut over one hundred honourable mentions, to be honest). You will find the ends of many illustrious careers, as well as the origins of budding new filmographies. Old movements will come to die here (like the New Hollywood wave), and new ideas will reign triumphant (the TV movie). Colour will explode off the screen, especially with the heavy focus on vibrant neons and other rich hues (maybe to make up for the end of Technicolor in the â€˜70s).\n\nWhy is it that film gets a bad reputation when it is attached to the â€˜80s? Have we learned to try and ignore a time in film history full of creative exploration that didnâ€™t only result in duds? Do we assume that the end of New Hollywood means the start of safe cinema once more? Did the film franchises leave sour tastes in our mouths? Itâ€™s unfortunate, because I was handed the biggest mixed bag I have received so far. If anything, itâ€™s a mixed bag that makes looking back feel worthwhile. What cult films have stuck with us? Which films of our youths did we identify with more as adults? How difficult was it to view these countless films (including the honourable mentions) without nostalgia goggles (or â€” the opposite â€” the expectation that cinemaâ€™s most unnecessarily ignored era would not deliver once more)? I have come to adore this era, and I hope that I can convince you to do the same. Either way, there is a lot to explore. Here are the best one hundred films of the 1980â€™s.\n\nDisclaimer: I havenâ€™t included documentaries, or any film that is considerably enough of a documentary (mockumentaries donâ€™t count). I havenâ€™t forgotten about films like Shoah or The Thin Blue Line. Iâ€™m keeping them in mind for later (wink wink).\n\nBe sure to check out my other Best 100 lists of every decade here.\n\n58. The Empire Strikes Back\n\nThe best Star Wars film to date has been spoiled for the entire world, and yet it is so good that it still doesnâ€™t even matter. Now, The Empire Strikes Back is a space western staple, with a reinvention of the open worlds and smushed saloons of the former genre; itâ€™s also just flat out the one Star Wars film we can all agree on, after A New Hope. Back then, this film was a fantastic sign that this new reality found with the original Star Wars was not a fluke. This beautiful franchise was meant to continue. I honestly believe that Star Wars started something new, but it was The Empire Strikes Back which completely capitalized on what this new idea (film franchises) could actually do. Now that this was released a long time ago (and somewhat in a galaxy far, far away), The Empire Strikes Back is easily the peak of George Lucasâ€™ brainchild (and, weirdly enough, he only wrote the story and helped produce this entry).\n\n13. Come and See\n\nElem Klimovâ€™s cult classic Come and See has seen a recent burst in popularity, originally because of the elusiveness of the film (it was nowhere to be found in good condition). It is sure to garner an even wider audience with the Criterion Collectionâ€™s recent release of the highly-coveted war horror. Never has a young performance matched that of Aleksei Kravchenko, who essentially quit the business (for the most part) after this cinematic nightmare. Most films don't come anywhere close to the desperation that Come and See discharges off of the screen. Come and See is a test of emotional strength within a film, and thatâ€™s before the soul shattering finale, where the traumatized lead has to ask himself if the loss of any life â€” even that of monsters â€” is morally just. I donâ€™t know if any film can be as emotionally destructive as Come and See even if they tried.\n\n10. Berlin Alexanderplatz\n\nDuring the seventies and eighties, a few auteurs were interested in the opportunities that television could serve as a cinematic tool. Ingmar Bergman. Krzysztof KieÅ›lowski. Then, there was Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who tip-toed between the idea of a miniseries and a film the most with Berlin Alexanderplatz. You get sucked into this story of redemption, as it carries on episode by episode. You see failures, and honest attempts that place us right back in an optimistic position. Then, the two hour epilogue begins, and it completely deviates away from everything we have previously known. Twenties Berlin now has The Velvet Underground playing. The locations we once knew are clad with lit candles. This realistic story is now a metaphor for hell, and Fassbinderâ€™s representation of the place of eternal suffering is possibly cinemaâ€™s most horrifying weâ€™ve ever seen. Thirteen hours (out of fifteen) lead up to two hours of comeuppance, and itâ€™s as disturbing as it is exquisite art.\n\n2. Wings of Desire\n\nWim Wenders seemed to be tired of the road film he kept resorting to (or at least he wanted to explore this style in a whole knew way). He still wanted to feature multiple locations, but there had to be less meandering or personal purpose to be served. So, his answer was Wings of Desire: the greatest film about angels ever created. Guardian angels watch over troubled mortals (and this is captured with some fluid, soaring camera pans and zooms). We visit the homes, workplaces, and commutes of many souls, including the fictitious and the real (Peter Falk and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds). One guardian angel falls in love with a circus performer, and wishes to lose his eternal life to become a mortal and experience life with her. Itâ€™s at this point that Wenders spins Wings of Desire from a multi faceted exploration into a blissful cinematic experience, and the film completely changes tone. Itâ€™s a turning point that youâ€™ll never forget, and it renders all of Wings of Desire as the revitalization of oneâ€™s spirit.\n\n1. Raging Bull\n\nMartin Scorsese was knocking on deathâ€™s door, dealing with addiction and the uphill battle of the film industry (despite some of his â€˜70s triumphs). Robert DeNiro begged Scorsese to adapt Raging Bull: a memoir by boxer Jake LaMotta. Scorsese scoffed, because he didnâ€™t do sports films. Nonetheless, he was hospital bound after surviving a near-fatal overdose, and he needed a career comeback after New York, New York bombed at the box office (it wasnâ€™t that bad, right?). So, Raging Bull was two missions for Scorsese. Firstly, it was his mean of deviating away from the conventionality and predictability of the sports genre. Secondly, he made this film as if it was going to be his very last; he wasnâ€™t sure how much longer he would keep going as a mortal being.\n\nRaging Bull was released in 1980, at the turn of the decade. It was shot in black and white to look time appropriate (a balance between the â€˜40s, â€˜50s and â€˜60s), and not like a product of its time. Despite all of this, it was immediately the greatest work of the â€˜80s, and has remained as such to this day (even though it bears nearly zero characteristics of the era). LaMotta is posed neither as a hero, a villain, or an antihero. Heâ€™s just a flawed, problematic human being, who destroyed everything he owned and pushed away everyone he loved because of his own demons. Scorsese likely found this a cathartic experience, as he tried to ensure that the same fates did not happen to himself. The highest point of the film is cinemaâ€™s greatest montage sequence: an amalgamation of colour home footage, and images of LaMotta reigning victorious. After this, LaMottaâ€™s entire life is killed by himself, turning this montage into a dream we long for again.\n\nTurning the boxing ring into a haven of cinematic metaphors separates Raging Bull from other sports films (thereâ€™s less than ten minutes of screen time in said ring). Instead, itâ€™s an exposÃ© for Scorsese to analyze the fragility of the human body and mind, particularly with LaMotta as the pugnacious subject. With every loved one of Scorseseâ€™s working overtime to ensure that his potential final film is his best (DeNiro, editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Paul Schrader, and more), the end result is a parting vision of an unreachable magnitude. Luckily Scorsese defeated his demons, and has kept releasing quality works as one of Americaâ€™s greatest auteurs to this day. Raging Bull will remain his greatest achievement: a brush with death turned into the ultimate appreciation of the cinematic art form. This metaphysical experience was made out of fear of tomorrow never happening at any second. Now, it is the greatest film of the 1980â€™s. Time is a saviour or a curse. Scorsese knew that as much as LaMotta did."
