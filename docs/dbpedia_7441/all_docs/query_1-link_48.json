        "text": "This movie is garbage. It's a travesty of a well-written English play.\n\nThe play starred the highly-literate Paul Scofield.\n\nBut the movie was done by a buffoon who couldn't speak the English language . He wanted to remove all the dialogue and do it in pantomime and 'opera buffo'.\n\nIt is an utter waste of time. Anyone who like this is probably a gibberish-speaking idiot. That its all.\n\nI love the movie, come to think of it, I need to find it on streaming!\n\nNot highly historically accurate, but it wasn't meant to be a biography of Mozart of Salieri. It's about life not being fair, always a worthy subject.\n\nIt's a shame Meg Tilly lost the role of the wife. Such bad luck. She was injured in a soccer game during rehearsals. If she had just shot one day of film the insurance company would have covered it and they could have waited for her to heal (she discusses this on her youtube channel.) I think she'd have been better than the woman they chose to replace her.\n\nForeman's casting was so odd. He seemed to want to pick people from odd backgrounds. Abraham best known for Fruit of the Loom commercials. Hulce for Animal House. And the three women he flew to Prague to replace Tilly (who was best known for Psycho 2) were all from horror films (Elizabeth Berridge, Diane Franklin) or Rebecca DeMornay from the teen comedy Risky Business.\n\nThere is a documentary where he is clearly working with a costumed Elizabeth McGovern on a screen test. I wonder why he didn't pick her. She had a classical theater background and had done well for him in Ragtime. She would have fit the role too.\n\nHistorically, the movie is not accurate with regard to anything but the costuming. But then, neither is the play on which it is based.\n\nIn Amadeus, Shaffer did not set out to write about Mozart or about Salieri; he merely used their characters to explore the conflict that seems to have obsessed him: man vs. god.\n\nThis conflict underlies other works of his, like Equus and Royal Hunt of the Sun as well. Knowing nothing biographical about him, I have always assumed that Shaffer was an author who had lost whatever faith he was brought up in, and never came to terms with that loss.\n\nI saw play in NYC with the original cast - Tim Curry as Mozart, Ian McKellan as Salieri and Jane Seymour as Constanza (her understudy performed the day I attended). What I remember is the critical acclaim the play had received and that it was already known that it was not historically accurate, but who cared because the script was terrific and the performances were incredible (and they really were).\n\nOh what an opening with the two men gossiping over and around a dying Salieri!\n\n[quote] Historically, the movie is not accurate with regard to anything but the costuming.\n\nWell, that’s not accurate. There are facts throughout the script of the movie that are historically correct, i.e., that Joseph II was the Emperor of Austria, that Mozart performed for the Pope, that the Marriage of Figaro was not a hit in Vienna, but was lauded in Prague. Schaffer took those facts and brilliantly wove a fiction through them about this purported rivalry. But, the movie is not to be mistaken for a history textbook retelling of Mozart’s life.\n\nI love the movie. The scene where Mozart meets the Emperor and rewrites Salieri’s “March of Welcome,” is pure gold.\n\nNot sure it was meant to be taken as historically accurate OP\n\nIt was an exploration of how our systems often reward mediocrity and punish genius and are the successful mediocrities ever aware that their success is undeserved?\n\nIt's a theme that's rarely explored in popular culture, because by definition popular culture is the enabler of successful mediocrity.\n\nThe theme does pop up every so often-- Netflix's brilliant Bojack Horseman was in many ways about that--the star of a hit 90s sitcom who knew the show that made him millions was shit.\n\nMeeting of Mozart and the Emperor's \"young sister Antoinette\" from R23 likely did happen, but maybe not exactly as described.\n\nWhat film got wrong is that Emperor Joseph II was Austrian and his still unmarried young sister was Maria Antonia. One supposes screenwriters and other suits felt audiences (especially American) would fail to make the connection between the young Austrian princess who became Queen of France and Navarre.\n\n[quote] What film got wrong is that Emperor Joseph II was Austrian and his still unmarried young sister was Maria Antonia. One supposes screenwriters and other suits felt audiences (especially American) would fail to make the connection between the young Austrian princess who became Queen of France and Navarre.\n\nHuh? There is no attempt to hide or ignore the fact the Emperor Joseph II was the Emperor of Austria and the older brother of France’s Queen, Marie Antoinette. She was married in 1770 at the age of 14, long before Joseph became the Emperor. At the time that Joseph meets Mozart in the film, obviously before the 1782 premiere of “The Abduction from the Seraglio, (which they discuss)” Marie had been the Queen of France for more than a decade. At that point Joseph refers to the meeting of Marie and Mozart when both were children. Then, at a later point in the movie, when talking about The Marriage of Figaro, Joseph references his displeasure with any libretto based on the Beaumarchais' play, because of the growing unrest in France and the effects on “my own sister” Marie. The people who didn’t understand the relationship of these European royal houses were simply unaware of the marriage.\n\nBut I fail to see what the filmmakers got wrong in this respect.\n\n[quote] Is it worth seeing?\n\nNo, it isn't.\n\nWe need to wait for the proper version made by an English-speaking cast and crew who know how to manage English words of more than three syllables.\n\nI can't help but think the reason this movie won so many awards back in 1984/85 is because it was so \"artsy\".\n\nIt was up against A Passage to India, The killing Fields, Places in the Heart, and A Soldier's Story for Best Picture.\n\nIt made people feel \"cultured\" to extol its greatness.\n\nI was told to watch it, years after it was released, and I was so pissed at the person after I found out it was not accurate.\n\n[quote]I can't help but think the reason this movie won so many awards back in 1984/85 is because it was so \"artsy\".\n\nThe Academy wanted to associate itself with a celestial genius who died young in poverty and never had the chance to make blockbuster soundtracks for Spielberg.\n\nGood and fascinating as 'Amadeus' play and film remain, it's of course Mozart's music which upstages everything, but validates the watching experience. A fair context for those excerpts of phenomenal beauty."
