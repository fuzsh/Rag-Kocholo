        "text": "The 1980s heralded a move away from the character-driven cinema of earlier decades and brought a renewed focus instead on high-concept blockbusters with the potential to hit colossal audiences. Opening with The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Indiana Jones (1981) and E.T. (1982), the ’80s were marked by ‘event’ films that drew unprecedented crowds and laid the foundations for the genre films of today. As Ronald Reagan became America’s first TV-star president, escapist films with high entertainment value became the main currency of Hollywood. A stark example of this period of de-politicized mainstream cinema comes from Die Hard (1988) director John McTiernan: he deliberately included the twist that the ‘terrorist’ villains are in fact simple bank robbers so that the film could be a purely entertaining blockbuster.\n\nThe 1980s was also the era that brought the rise of the film franchise. We see James Cameron take Ridley Scott’s claustrophobic horror film Alien (1979) and re-imagine it as a pulse-pounding action flick in Aliens (1986).\n\nMeanwhile, the controversy surrounding gore in films like Indiana Jones (1981) and Gremlins (1984) led to the creation of a new age rating: PG-13. As a device, this enabled popular cinema to explore dark, visually graphic material without sacrificing audience sizes.\n\nThis environment of high budgets and the perpetual pursuit of must-see cinematic experiences created a melting pot of innovation that yielded classics in the genres of horror (The Shining, Hellraiser), fantasy (The Princess Bride) and science-fiction (The Terminator, Predator). Similarly, Hollywood’s efforts to target the younger generation gave birth to the teen-comedy, as exemplified by Ferris Bueller’s Day Off (1986), Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), and The Breakfast Club (1985).\n\nBut despite the impact of these crowd-pleasing successes, the ‘80s still offered plenty of thoughtful works with theme and artistic symbolism at their heart. David Lynch’s Blue Velvet (1986) achieved cult success with its unnerving depiction of suburban America, and Platoon (1986) provided a visceral ground-level depiction of the Vietnam War regarded by many as the best work exploring this bleak episode in U.S. history.\n\nSo, whether you draw inspiration from the spiritual journey towards a meaningful existence in Tender Mercies (1983) or John Rambo’s first action outing in First Blood (1982), we hope that the screenplays in this compilation offer lessons you can incorporate into your own writing.\n\nTake a look at our Feature, TV Pilot & Short Film Fund Contests.\n\nArticle by Oliver Taylor"
