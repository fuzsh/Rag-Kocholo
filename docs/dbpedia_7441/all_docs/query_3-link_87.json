As Verstraten argues, filmmakers use music as narrative tool(153) that not only challenges the audience 's emotions but also carries the theme of the movie. In this scene the music is intradiegetic since Andy connects the public speaker system to the record player so that all of the prisoners can hear the music. In her book Music in American Crime Prevention and Punishment, Lily Hirsch explains that this scene “also highlights another utopia musical ascription related to the contested idea that music is a universal language” since all the prisoners are feeling connected, enjoying the music while hope is revived within their\n\nCasablanca Film Noir Analysis\n\n1687 Words | 7 Pages\n\nThose that believe Casablanca is not film noir usually perceive Film Noir as a genre. Noir is not a genre; Noir transcends genres and behaves more accurately as a style of cinema. As styles go, there can be variations of them as we see now with Post-Noir and Neo Noir, noir elements in a different time period of film technology which makes these films slightly different than the style of classic film noir.

One commonly recognized technique in Welles’ film is deep focus photography. Deep focus photography is used in films to allow everything in a shot to be in focus at once.
