        "text": "Lavish and flamboyant in every manner. F. Murray Abraham’s vile and sinister performance as the envious Salieri, a man with more desire to produce music than God gave him talent to create, is one for the ages.\n\nFull Review | Jun 8, 2023\n\nDecorated with a powdered-sugar sweetness and creamy lavishness unseen since the days of Josef von Sternberg, and performed by an eager to please, rootin'-tootin' American cast that would be comfortable in Oklahoma!, Amadeus is junk food par excellence.\n\nFull Review | Aug 8, 2022\n\nThe film makes too many claims to verisimilitude to allow for suspension of disbelief... But the excitement of absorption in what remains a riveting dramatic story, in the vitality of the images, are almost enough to override all the objections.\n\nFull Review | Jul 11, 2022\n\nThe subject of artistic creation is typically handled badly in the movies... [Amadeus] treats the subject of creativity in a fresh way.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Jul 11, 2022\n\nThis is Mozart as an eighteenth-century Bruce Springsteen, and yet (here is the genius of the movie) there is nothing cheap or unworthy about the approach.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Jul 11, 2022\n\nMr. Forman, who created a highly original film out of the virtually formless stage production of Hair, has preserved the fascinating heart of Mr. Shaffer's play, and made it available to millions who might never enter a legitimate theater. Well done.\n\nFull Review | Jul 11, 2022\n\nAmadeus is a smashing entertainment, a culture maven's orgy, and the best advertisement for classical music we've ever had. Go see it. Go hear it.\n\nFull Review | Jul 11, 2022\n\nSome of this exuberant, large-scale movie is charming and inventive, and some of it is pitifully trashy... The last third of Amadeus is a disaster.\n\nFull Review | Jul 11, 2022\n\nFor a full two hours, Amadeus is by and large a splendid film, lavish, exuberant, full of spectacle and vitality. But intoxicated by its own success, it unwisely chooses to go on and on, overstaying its welcome by a good half hour.\n\nFull Review | Jul 11, 2022\n\nWhat has happened in the long-awaited, much-acclaimed Miloš Forman film, with its script by Shaffer, is that the popularization has gone so broad and so far afield of its elevated subject as to make that subject seem ridiculous.\n\nFull Review | Jul 11, 2022\n\nPeter Shaffer's Amadeus is scrumptiously beautiful, sizzlingly alive and bristling with social comedy. His screenplay contains the most piercing account of deadly envy since Othello, and is a heartbreaking account of a good man's fall from grace.\n\nFull Review | Jul 11, 2022\n\nForman is greatly indebted to an excellent cast, especially to Tom Hulce as the hee-hawing Mozart and Jeffrey Jones' quietly hilarious portrayal of the emperor. My own personal Oscar, though, goes to F. Murray Abraham's Salieri.\n\nFull Review | Jul 11, 2022\n\nIt's a film that increases in suspense and tension as it progresses; but more importantly, it ripens in the imagination afterwards, which is exactly where so many films disintegrate. Music, in Amadeus, isn't the food of love but the food of thought.\n\nFull Review | Jul 11, 2022"
