        "text": "The biopic is a peculiar beast: the closer you look at the genre, the less it seems like a genre at all. Of course there’s an instantly recognisable formula to many of them – the Oscar-friendly hybrid of melodrama and history lesson which came to dominate middlebrow filmmaking in the 2000s and 2010s.\n\nBut what’s striking about this template is how little the best examples of the form have to do with it. Take The Theory of Everything, the 2014 Stephen Hawking film starring Eddie Redmayne, and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. While each tells the story of a great 20th century scientific thinker, only the former, with its heavily spotlit central performance, Wikipedian structure and inoffensively pretty aesthetic belongs in the same drawer as Trumbo, Bohemian Rhapsody, The Imitation Game and Invictus.\n\nNolan’s film, meanwhile, would splinter any drawer you tried to cram it in: part of what makes Oppenheimer so exhilarating is the extent to which everything it does feels indivisible from everything it’s about.\n\nHence the extremely varied list of films below. Truly great biopics can be made in any style going, from musical to western; they can slavishly cleave to the facts or capture their subject more impressionistically, with all the slants and ambiguities that film allows.\n\nTo select the best 40, I set just three ground rules. One: the films should be thought of first and foremost as accounts of an actual person’s life and work, so no veiled portrayals like The Master, or alternate histories like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Two: their chief focus should be one or two specific individuals, rather than broader historical moments (sorry, The Zone of Interest). And three: they should be dramatised, if only because factoring in documentaries would render the task impossible.\n\nI then immediately broke all of these repeatedly, though have chosen to see this as being testament to how hard the form is to pin down when at its best. So here are my 40 favourite films this probably-not-really-a-genre has to offer, spanning almost a century from a silent-era classic to, most recently, Nolan’s multi-Academy-Award-winning hit.\n\n40. Rocketman (2019)\n\nDexter Fletcher’s irrepressible jukebox musical follows Elton John from childhood to pop immortality, pulling no punches as it mines every hit for maximum biographical import. And Taron Egerton’s lead performance as the former Reginald Dwight might be the best modern example of the ‘immersive’ lead turn: while he looks and sounds the part, it’s Elton’s spirit that’s truly unmistakeable. Read our Rocketman review\n\n23. Vengeance is Mine (1979)\n\nIn 1963, the fraudster Akira Nishiguchi embarked on a killing spree that gripped Japan, as he evaded capture for more than two months. Shōhei Imamura’s transfixingly nasty adaptation of Nishiguchi’s life story unfolds like an investigation, starting with the arrest, then tracking back through the murders themselves to his childhood and early adult life, and finally to their unhappy aftermath. The killings are nihilistically pointless – random yet precise – with the great Ken Ogata (also the star of Mishima, just above) horribly plausible as the everyday nobody who carries them out with icy detachment.\n\n22. Star 80 (1983)\n\nBob Fosse’s final film, about the murder of Playboy model Dorothy Stratten by her husband Paul Snider, dismayed many critics on its release. No wonder: it’s a deeply creepy, prurient and discomfiting watch, but only because Fosse so successfully harnesses and weaponises the male desire on which Stratten’s career, and ultimately also demise, were fed. Mariel Hemingway is superb in the title role, but Eric Roberts gives the performance of his career as Snider, laying bare the part self-loathing, part self-gratifying pimp mentality that lies at the heart of the exploitation dynamic."
