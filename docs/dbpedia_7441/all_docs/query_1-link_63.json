        "text": "Paul Bettany is set to star opposite Will Sharpe in Sky‘s limited series about composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nThe WandaVision and A Very British Scandal star will portray renowned composer Antonio Salieri in Amadeus, with Sharpe (Giri/Haji, The White Lotus) playing Mozart, as we previously revealed.\n\nIt is a reimagining of Peter Shaffer’s award-winning stage play, and will expand and interrogate the mythic rivalry of the two composers. Hero of his own story but villain to history, Salieri’s envy turns vengeful as he uses any means necessary to thwart Mozart and protect his position in the establishment.\n\nGiri/Haji and The Lazarus Project scribe Joe Barton is writing the series, with Julian Farino directing. STV Studios-owned Two Cities Television is producing in association with Sky Studios. Megan Spanjian is executive producer for Sky Studios. Michael Jackson (Patrick Melrose) and Stephen Wright (Blue Lights) are EPs for Two Cities Television, with Farino (Giri/Haji) and Alice Seabright (Chloe, Sex Education) the directors. Barton, Sharpe and Farino also serve as exec producers.\n\nProduction is due to start in Hungary this Spring. NBCUniversal Global TV Distribution handles international sales of the series.\n\nBettany is known for the roles in shows such as Amazon Studios and the BBC’s drama A Very British Scandal and as ‘Vision’ in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Disney+ series WandaVision. On stage, he most recently starred in the Broadway production of Anthony McCarten’s drama The Collaboration as the iconic Andy Warhol.\n\n“I can’t wait to work with Julian Farino, Joe Barton, Sky and Sharpe who, for my money, is hands down the most exciting actor of his generation,” said Bettany.\n\nBettany is repped by UTA and Affirmative Entertainment."
