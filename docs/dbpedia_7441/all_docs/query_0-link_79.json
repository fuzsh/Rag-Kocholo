        "text": "The inaugural season of the Visalia Fox Theatre’s Way Back Wednesdays: Classic Flicks at the Fox series was so successful, managers of the historic downtown landmark decided to expand the nostalgic film offerings.\n\nThis season, in addition to the classic Way Back Wednesday series (titles have to be at least 30 years old), the Fox will screen some beloved films from the 1980s with a Throwback Thursday series.\n\nThe idea: Those poor, deprived millennials will get a chance to see some of the movies they’ve only seen on the small screen at the movie palace that is the Visalia Fox. Older audiences will get a chance to relive some of their younger movie-going memories.\n\nThis year’s offerings include such classic films as “The Grapes of Wrath” and “American Graffiti” and beloved 1980s film as “Die Hard” and “The Princess Bride.”\n\nAll films will start at 6:30 pm, tickets are $5. The first 200 guests will get a free small popcorn. Series tickets are $35 for each or $65 for both at the Visalia Fox Theatre box office\n\nThey’ll be some live pre-show organ performances, and the Fox is looking at different organizations they could partner with to introduce individual films.\n\nLast year, for example, a Catholic priest introduced “The Exorcist” with a discussion of the nature of evil and the Visalia Opera Company performed several Mozart opera compositions before a screening of “Amadeus.”\n\nLike last year, Choices, the weekend entertainment section of the Times-Delta Media Group, is a co-sponsor the series. Fox managers are looking for other sponsors for the series as well. If your business or group would like to sponsor either series or individual films, contact Visalia Fox co-executive director Erin Olm-Shipman at 625-1369.\n\nFinally, Choices has scored season passes to both series -- and we want to give away those passes to readers. To enter into a drawing for the passes, send an email to choices@visaliatimesdelta.com, with subject line Way Back Wednesday or Throwback Thursday, your name, phone number and city you live in. The contest is open to readers in the Times-Delta/Advance-Register circulation area.\n\nHere’s a look at this season’s lineup:\n\nWay Back Wednesdays: Classic Flicks at the Fox\n\nSept. 14: “Grapes of Wrath” – John Ford’s Oscar-winning adaptation of John Steinbeck’s novel about Great Depression migrants from Oklahoma struggling to scratch out a living in California. Much of the second half of the film is set in Tulare County.\n\nOct. 5: “Alien”— Ridley Scott’s iconic scare fest set in outer space is one of the scariest films of all time.\n\nNov. 2: “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” –Frank Capra’s classic film about political idealism gone awry will be screened right before the presidential election. Talk about perfect timing. Plus, you can never go wrong with Jimmy Stewart.\n\nDec. 14: “Going My Way” – The warm-hearted, Oscar-winning film about a young parish priest (Bing Crosby) and his relationship with an older priest (a wonderful Barry Fitzgerald). The movie features the iconic Crosby tune “Swinging on a Star.”\n\nJan. 18: “The Searchers” – Another John Ford film, this one stars John Wayne. It’s the best western ever made. And with all the shots of sweeping vistas, the classic movie is best seen on the big screen.\n\nFeb 1: “Roman Holiday” – This one is for lovers of romantic films. The luminous Audrey Hepburn, who won an Oscar for her performance, falls in love with newspaper reporter Gregory Peck. (See, there’s always hope for us ink-stained wretches!)\n\nMarch 22: “Citizen Kane” – Film scholars still point to Orson Welles thinly veiled biopic of William Randolph Hearst as the best film of all time. They are right. The ground-breaking movie is a vibrant, modern and pulsing with artistic energy as the day it was originally released. A towering achievement in cinema history.\n\nApril 12: “Gigi” – This Oscar-winning musical from Vincente Minnelli features iconic performances from Maurice Chevalier, Louis Jourdan, and Leslie Caron. Oh, and the now admittedly creepy classic song “Thank Heaven For Little Girls.”\n\nMay 3: “American Graffiti” –Before George Lucas made “Star Wars” he directed and wrote this nostalgic Oscar-nominated classic about growing up in Modesto. It’s a great movie and a fascinating portrait of what life was like in the 1960s Central Valley..\n\nThrowback Thursdays: 1980s Films at the Fox\n\nSept. 22: “The Breakfast Club” – No film says disaffected 1980s teenagers more than John Hughes’ comedy-drama about a group of students forced to attend a high school weekend detention session. The cast includes Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy.\n\nOct. 13: “Lost Boys” – If you grew up in the 1980s, this teen vampire film set in Santa Cruz was no doubt a big part of your childhood. Funny and scary, it made the two Coreys – Haim and Feldman – child stars. It also featured a very young Kiefer Sutherland as an evil teen vampire.\n\nNov. 17: “E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial” – Steven Spielberg’s timeless classic about a boy and an alien stands alongside “The Wizard of Oz” as a film that will never lose its magic.\n\nDec. 1: “Die Hard” – Bruce Willis battles Alan Rickman in this beloved action film that contains one of the most famous profanity-laced catch phrases in movie history. Plus, it’s set during Christmas.\n\nJan. 26: “Weird Science” – The second John Hughes film of the series. This one is a prime example of the, um, randy teenager movie. It’s about two geeks (Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith) who create a super model on their computer. Keep an eye out for very young future stars Bill Paxton and Robert Downey, Jr. in supporting roles.\n\nFeb 16: “The Princess Bride” – Rob Reiner’s fairy book story come to life. There are so many great moments in the film it’s hard to know where to begin. The cast, Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Chris Sarandon, Christopher Guest, Peter Falk and a young Fred Savage, is perfection.\n\nMarch 2: “Trading Places” – Eddie Murphy, Dan Aykroyd, and Jamie Lee Curtis make for a terrific team in this comedy that skewers Wall Street greed – which proves things haven’t changed much in the past 30 years.\n\nApril 6: “Who Framed Roger Rabbit?” – Robert Zemeckis’ groundbreaking live-action/animated film hybrid is a love song to Hollywood’s Golden Age of animation. It features a great performance by the late, great Bob Hoskins as a hard-boiled private eye,\n\nMay 25: “National Lampoon's Vacation” – What a great way to kick off the 2017 summer travel season. This comedy starring Chevy Chase about a family vacation from hell is laugh-out-funny.\n\nHow to attend\n\nVisalia Fox Theatre’s Way Back Wednesdays: Classic Flicks at the Fox and Throwback Thursday: 1980s Rewind films will start at 6:30 p.m., tickets are $5. The first 200 guests will get a free small popcorn. Series tickets are $35 for each or $65 for both, or $5 a film at the Visalia Fox Theatre box office.
