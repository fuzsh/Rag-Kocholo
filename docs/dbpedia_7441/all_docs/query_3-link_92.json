The concert will be conducted by Richard Kaufman, and features Ian Watson on fortepiano, who played on the original Amadeus film recording in 1984. Further, Handel and Haydn Society’s performance of AMADEUS LIVE is the only in the world performed by a period orchestra and chorus.\n\nPerformances will take place on November 10 and 11 (7:30pm) and November 12 (3pm) at Symphony Hall located at 301 Massachusetts Avenue in Boston.

Audiences will enjoy this spectacular marriage of sight, sound, and epic movie-making in a thrilling new way—with the film projected on a vast HD screen as the soundtrack is performed live by the H+H orchestra and chorus. According to USA Today, Amadeus is “about as close to perfection as movies get.”\n\n“We’re beyond thrilled for this unique opportunity to truly showcase the H+H orchestra and chorus – performing as only they do, on instruments true to the time the music was written, lending the performance authenticity and power,” said David Snead, President and CEO of the Handel and Haydn Society. “This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and we’re glad to offer it to Boston audiences this fall. And to top it off, H+H’s own fortepianist Ian Watson played on the original film soundtrack in 1984. Now, he will perform the music live, 33 years later.”\n\nAmadeus Live is an Avex Classics International Production. The Handel and Haydn Society presents this performance in conjunction with its media partners WCRB Classical Radio Boston, a service of WGBH; The Boston Globe; and Improper Bostonian.\n\nAbout Richard Kaufman, Conductor\n\nRichard Kaufman has devoted much of his musical life to conducting and supervising music for film and television productions, as well as performing film and classical music in concert halls and on recordings.

He has recorded over 120 titles for which he has won numerous awards, including the coveted Gramophone Award for Early Music and the prestigious Classical Brit Award in 2005 for his disc Renaissance. His CD IKON was nominated for a 2007 Grammy and his second recording of Handel’s Messiah on The Sixteen’s own label CORO won the prestigious MIDEM Classical Award 2009. In 2009, he received one of classical music’s highest accolades, the Classic FM Gramophone Awards Artist of the Year Award, and The Sixteen won the Baroque Vocal Award for Handel Coronation Anthems, a recording that also received a 2010 Grammy Award nomination as did Palestrina, Vol. 3 in 2014.

Based in Boston, H+H’s Orchestra and Chorus delight more than 50,000 listeners each year with a 10-concert subscription series at Symphony Hall and other leading venues in addition to a robust program of intimate events in museums, schools, and community centers. Under the leadership of Artistic Director Harry Christophers, the ensemble embraces historically informed performance bringing classical music to life with the same immediacy it had the day it was written. Through the Karen S. and George D. Levy Education Program, H+H also provides engaging, accessible, and broadly inclusive music education to more than 12,000 children each year through in-school music instruction and a Vocal Arts Program that includes six youth choruses.\n\nFounded in Boston in 1815, H+H is the oldest continuously-performing arts organization in the United States, and is unique among American ensembles for its longevity, capacity for reinvention, and distinguished history of premieres. H+H began as a choral society founded by middle-class Bostonians who aspired to improve the quality of singing in their growing American city. They named the organization after two composers—Handel and Haydn—to represent both the old music of the 18th century and what was then the new music of the 19th century. In the first decades of its existence, H+H gave the American premieres of Handel’s Messiah (1818), Haydn’s Creation (1819), Verdi’s Requiem (1878), and Bach’s St. Matthew Passion (1879). Between 2014 and 2016, H+H celebrated its Bicentennial with two seasons of special concerts and initiatives to mark 200 years of music making. Since its founding, H+H has given more than 2,000 performances before a total audience exceeding 2.8 million.\n\nIn addition to its subscription series, tours, and broadcast performances, H+H reaches a worldwide audience through ambitious recordings including Haydn Symphonies, the critically-acclaimed Haydn: The Creation, the best-selling Joy to the World: An American Christmas, and Handel Messiah, recorded live at Symphony Hall under Christophers’ direction."
