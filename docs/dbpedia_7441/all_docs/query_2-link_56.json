        "text": "Join us to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the critically acclaimed masterpiece, Amadeus! Winner of eight Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Screenplay, it remains one of the most beloved and decorated movies of all time.\n\nTickets include a live string duo performance before the screening and a delectable Capezzoli di Venere (Nipples of Venus)! Bookings essential for catering purposes!!\n\nNever intended to be historically accurate, Amadeus is a fantasy world, loosely based on facts and channeling Pushkin’s 1830 play, Mozart und Salieri, which explores the time-honoured feud between genius and mediocrity. In so doing, they crafted a work of art that has captivated us since it's release in 1984.\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart is a remarkably talented young Viennese composer who unwittingly finds a fierce rival in the disciplined and determined Antonio Salieri. Resenting Mozart for both his hedonistic lifestyle and his undeniable talent, the highly religious Salieri is gradually consumed by his jealousy and becomes obsessed with Mozart's downfall, leading to a devious scheme that has dire consequences for both men.\n\nCast: Tom Hulce, F. Murray Abraham, Elizabeth Berridge\n\nDirector: Milos Forman\n\n★★★★★ \"[A] grandiose masterpiece.\" GUARDIAN"
