        "text": "This was on sale a few weeks ago on iTunes and I purchased a digital copy of it. Sadly it lacks any special features whatsoever. I then ordered a used Blu Ray copy since I see it has a commentary track by Milo≈° Forman.\n\nThis was one of my all time favorite movies when I first saw it about 20 years ago. It's astonishing. When I was younger a 3 hour period piece about classical music and opera would have seemed like torture but every bit of it is riveting.\n\nMy daughter is very much interested in this time period and a musician herself so we watched it tonight as a family. It holds up-God it's so fantastic. Makes me wish Tom Hulce had a larger career. And of course, F. Murray Abraham is absolutely incredible in this as Salieri.\n\nView: https://youtu.be/r7kWQj9FCGY\n\nI only saw the film once, many many years ago. But that being said, it is the reason why I consider F. Murray Abraham to be such a legendary actor, although I don't actually remember any of this performance.\n\nFor some reason, I keep seeing clips of it show up in my YouTube recommendations. But it's been so long since I've seen it that I wouldn't remember any of the context, so I never watch them. But they keep showing up.\n\nI had a really awkward experience watching the director edition of this with my dad because I didn't expect the scene where Mozart's wife exposes herself to salieri. It left me feeling super icky and I never want to see that version again.\n\nAlso I've been searching for (the standard edition) on various streaming services for a few years now. Why isn't it out there?\n\nI had a really awkward experience watching the director edition of this with my dad because I didn't expect the scene where Mozart's wife exposes herself to salieri.

Why isn't it out there?\n\nSame here. I knew it was coming so I skipped that scene for my daughter. But it's really sad.\n\nI'm a sucker for any movie or documentary about genius, whatever subject. I find it endlessly fascinating.\n\nYeah, plus for me it comes with a degree of annoyance at my own lack of genius. Which is what makes this film in particular so great, haha."
