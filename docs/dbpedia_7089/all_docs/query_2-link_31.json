        "text": "As a British English speaker, I would call an ongoing drama with a new story about the same characters each week a series, and a self-contained drama in weekly parts, such as a dramatization of a novel, a serial. However, American sources such as IMDb call the latter type a mini-series, because it is in a limited number of episodes.\n\nAny continuing program (as opposed to movies or specials) on TV is called a \"series\". This includes game shows, reality shows, sitcoms, dramas, etc.\n\nA \"serial\" is a type of series, usually comedy or drama, where the episodes generally form part of an ongoing plot arc, rather than being mostly self-contained stories. In some cases the plot arc might only last for a season, in other cases there's a storyline that lasts through the entire run of the series.\n\nThe most common form of serial programs are \"soap operas\". But in recent years it has become more popular to make serialized dramas and comedies. \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Lost\" are some of the most well known examples of serialized dramas. On streaming services, serialized shows are popular because viewers can binge-watch them, making them like long movies.\n\nAmbitious_ph1lologist nailed it, his definition is absolutely correct. In terms of TV production, serials are actually older than series (The Forsyte Saga, 1967; Lost in Space and the like to the more recent Downton Abbey). Serials are almost always works of fiction, they consist of xy number of episodes, and each episode tells just one part of the plot, usually leaving viewers in suspense until the next episode. Mini series rarely have more than 2 or 3 parts. Series can be anything, from sitcoms, action/drama, docudrama, documentaries, music shows, entertainment... you name it. So TV series are everything, from popular sitcoms (Friends, The Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men), criminal drama (NYPD, Navy CSI, 911, Law and Order...), to documentary series and other shows (Property Brothers etc.) They're all categorized as series. The main difference is that with TV series, each episode is more or less a complete story, and screenplays are often created / contributed by a number of authors, while serials are usually based on works of literature - fiction, (for example on a novel by a single author). At least this is how TV industry (where I worked for nearly 40 years) categorizes TV shows."
