        "text": "Apple TV+ offers exclusive Apple original TV shows and movies in 4K HDR quality. You can watch across all of your screens and pick up where you left off on any device. Apple TV+ costs $9.99 per month. Here’s every Apple original television show and movie available now on Apple TV+, as well as the latest trailers …\n\nApple TV+ content is available exclusively through the Apple TV app. You can watch on your Apple TV set-top box, iPhone, or iPad as you might expect.\n\nBut you don’t need the latest Apple TV 4K to enjoy Apple TV+. The TV app is also available on other platforms like Amazon Fire TV, Roku, Sony PlayStation, Xbox, and even the web at tv.apple.com.\n\nApple TV+ offers original comedies, dramas, thrillers, documentaries, and kids shows.\n\nFor your $9.99/month subscription, you can watch all of Apple’s originals — as listed below. You can download to watch offline too. Apple is adding new content every single month.\n\nHow to watch the free Apple TV+ shows\n\nThe TV app is the exclusive destination for Apple TV+, but the TV app is a little confusing because it blends together purchasable TV shows and movies from the iTunes Store, which you can buy or rent, content from other apps like Amazon Prime and Disney+, and Apple TV Channels.\n\nThe Watch Now screen does not really distinguish between content that you own and can watch, and just Apple’s general recommendations.\n\nThe easiest way to get started with Apple TV+ is to open the Apple TV app on your device, and tap on the Originals tab. (On some platforms, this tab is simply labelled using the ‘tv+’ logo.)\n\nThis tab takes you to the Apple TV+ channel page. This shows you all of the Apple TV+ shows and movies available to watch, separated into categories like comedy, drama and family fun.\n\nBe aware, the web experience at tv.apple.com is a bit barebonds compared to the native TV app on devices, and it only shows Apple original content. For the best experience, use the TV app on a device like Apple TV 4K.\n\nWhat to watch on Apple TV+\n\nApple TV+ (Apple TV Plus, or as some erroneously call it Apple+ TV) is still in its infancy but has already seen breakout hits including comedy Ted Lasso and workplace sci-fi drama Severance.\n\nApple aims for premium quality across its drama, comedy, and documentary TV shows and movies so everything should reach a reasonable level of quality and hopefully be worth your time. In terms of personal recommendations, I suggest starting with Ted Lasso, For All Mankind, Severance, Trying, and the movie Finch.\n\nRead on to see all of the TV shows, movies and specials streaming now on Apple TV+ as well as trailers for upcoming releases.\n\nAll Apple TV+ TV shows and movies (updated August 14, 2024):\n\nJump to TV Shows\n\nJump to Movies\n\nJump to Sports\n\nJump to Shorts and Specials\n\nJump to Coming Soon\n\nLatest Trailers\n\nWatch season two of Pachinko on August 24.
