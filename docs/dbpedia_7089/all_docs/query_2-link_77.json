Now, the time-travel drama's second season is at hand, so we put together this guide on how and where to watch 'Plan B' (TV series) season 2.\n\nWritten by Kit Copson (Writer, Briefing Editor)\n\nReviewed by Aleksander Hougen (Co-Chief Editor)\n\nLast Updated: 2024-08-07T09:19:01+00:00\n\nAll our content is written fully by humans; we do not publish AI writing. Learn more here.\n\nKey Takeaways: Where to Watch Plan B TV Series\n\nSubscribe to a decent streaming VPN like ExpressVPN and download its app.\n\nOpen the VPN’s server list and connect to a Canadian server.\n\nOpen CBC Gem and start watching ‘Plan B.’\n\nWhat to know about Plan B:\n\nBackground: ‘Plan B’ (2023) — not to be confused with ‘Plan B’ the movie — is a Canadian TV series based on the original French language series (2017) of the same name.\n\nProduction: KOTV Productions is behind ‘Plan B’ while Red Arrow Studios International takes care of international distribution.\n\nPlot Summary: The series explores the concept of traveling back in time to change things for someone living with regret and whether this is truly the means to a “perfect life.”\n\nBest VPN for Streaming Plan B\n\nNot available in your country?\n\nStatus checked 2024/08/15:\n\nCanadian anthology series ‘Plan B’ was released in early 2023 to mixed reviews. While some weren’t impressed, others have described it as “original,” “intense” and “one of a kind.” If you’re game for the upcoming second season but are concerned about geoblocking getting in the way, you need this guide on where to watch ‘Plan B’ (TV series) season 2 from anywhere.\n\nThe series is available to stream online for free but if you’re not in Canada, you’ll need a plan B. This comes in the form of a reliable VPN with Canadian servers, like ExpressVPN. If you’re wondering what a VPN is and how you can use one for streaming, we’ll answer all your burning questions in this guide.\n\nPlan B TV Series: Seasons 1 & 2 Plot & Summary (No Spoilers)\n\n‘Plan B’ (2023) season one saw Phillip Grimmer travel back to the past to make some changes in the hopes of fixing his troubled relationship and career quandaries. A mysterious agency named Plan B makes this possible, but it soon becomes clear that time travel is far from the perfect solution we often imagine it to be.\n\nSeason two will focus on a different storyline, that of Mia Coleman, a police officer who dealt with a case that unexpectedly ended in tragedy. Going back in time proves beneficial for Mia’s career but also forces her to confront some difficult truths about herself.\n\n‘Plan B’ season two will be released on Sunday, Aug. 11, 2024 on CBC Gem. The episode will air at 8 p.m. ET on CBC and go online on CBC Gem at the same time. A time zone converter may be helpful if you live outside the Americas.\n\nWhere to Watch Plan B (2023 TV Series) Online Free?\n\nYou can watch ‘Plan B’ (2023) for free on CBC Gem, a Canadian free streaming platform. It’s available only in Canada but we’ve got some good news for fans overseas: You can still access CBC Gem and stream ‘Plan B’ as long as you’re using a secure and fast VPN service.\n\nIs Plan B (TV Show) on Netflix?\n\nNo, ‘Plan B’ isn’t on Netflix, but content agreements between streaming services change regularly. This means that even if a show or movie isn’t on Netflix at the moment, it may be in the future if Netflix acquires the rights to it. For now, ‘Plan B’ is only on CBC Gem.\n\nHow to Watch Plan B in USA and Other Countries Outside Canada\n\nIf you’re outside Canada feeling disappointed because you can’t access CBC Gem to watch your favorite drama series, there’s a quick and easy solution. Follow these steps to connect to a good streaming VPN (we’ll use ExpressVPN as an example) and watch ‘Plan B’ from wherever you are.\n\nIf you don’t already have one, you’ll be prompted to sign up for a free CBC Gem account. In addition, even if ‘Plan B’ isn’t on Netflix right now, as we mentioned above, this might change in the future.\n\nDownload the VPN to Your Device\n\nDownload the VPN from the website and open the file to install it.\n\nConnect to a Canadian Server\n\nLaunch the VPN app and navigate to the server list. Choose a Canadian server and click “connect.”\n\nStream ‘Plan B’\n\nOpen CBC Gem, sign in or create your account and start streaming.\n\nTop 5 VPNs for Streaming Plan B\n\n1\n\n: PayPal, Credit card, Bitcoin, PaymentWall\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n$6.66 / month(save 48%)(All Plans) 30-days money-back guarantee\n\n2\n\n: PayPal, Credit card, Google Pay, AmazonPay, ACH Transfer, Cash\n\n: 10\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n$3.09 / month(save 76%)(All Plans) 30-days money-back guarantee\n\n3\n\n: PayPal, Credit card, Google Pay, Amazon Pay\n\n: Unlimited\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n$2.19 / month(save 85%)(All Plans) 30-days money-back guarantee\n\n4\n\n: PayPal, Credit card, Bitcoin, cash\n\n: 10\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n$4.49 / month(save 55%)(All Plans) 30-days money-back guarantee\n\n5\n\n: PayPal, Credit card, Coinbase, SEPA, Discover\n\n: 10\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n$1.99 / month(save 81%)(All Plans) 30-days money-back guarantee\n\nExpressVPN: The Best VPN to Stream Plan B Online\n\nDownload\n\n89 Mbps\n\nVery Fast\n\nUpload\n\n9 Mbps\n\nVery Fast\n\nLatency\n\n7 ms\n\nVery Fast\n\nSource: Cloudwards VPN Speed Test.
