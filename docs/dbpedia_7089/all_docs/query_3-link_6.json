        "text": "Academic titles\n\nSee academic and administrative titles on the capitalization page for guidance.\n\nSee quote attribution and degree formatting for guidance on current students and alumni.\n\nEvents\n\nProper names of events should be capitalized. In limited cases, events may also be italicized as necessary by University Marketing.\n\nNote: Quotation marks may be used only when capitalization and italicization cannot fulfill the need for technical or aesthetic reasons.\n\nPublications\n\nTitles of books, journals, magazines, plays, newspapers, and freestanding publications\n\nTitles of books, journals, magazines, plays, newspapers, and freestanding publications are italicized when quoted in text or bibliography. Always preserve original spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, and punctuation.\n\nExamples\n\nDavid McCullough’s best selling biography, John Adams, was recently made into a television mini-series.\n\nShe receives most of her news from Time magazine and the New York Times.\n\nException\n\nAmpersands can be changed to and with editorial discretion.\n\nAdditional book rules\n\nBook series\n\nTitles of book series or editions are capitalized but not italicized.\n\nParts of a book\n\nWhen referring to parts of a book—preface, foreword, appendix, chapter, etc.—use lowercase.\n\nTitles of articles, chapters, poems, and shorter works\n\nTitles of articles, chapters, poems, and shorter works are set in roman type and enclosed with quotation marks. If quotation marks are used in the original titles, then single quotation marks must be substituted.\n\nAttribution formatting\n\nFor attribution, format as follows:\n\n#11 best town in the nation to go stargazing\n\n– BuzzFeed\n\nSee quote attribution and degree formatting for more information on attribution.\n\nMovies, television, and radio\n\nTitles of movies, television, and radio shows are italicized. A single episode is enclosed in quotation marks.\n\nFormal names of broadcast channels and networks are capitalized:\n\nThe Discovery Channel offers a variety of programs from health to the environment.\n\nShe often watches the Oxygen and Comedy Central channels.\n\nMusical works\n\nThe names of operas and musicals are italicized. Individual songs and arias are set in quotation marks:\n\nHandel’s Messiah includes the well-known “Hallelujah” chorus.\n\n“Oh, What a Beautiful Morning” is performed in the opening scene of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s musical, Oklahoma!\n\nAlbum/CD recording names are italicized. Individual songs are set in quotation marks.\n\nInstrumental music such as symphonies, quartets, rhapsodies, etc., that also include a number or key signature in the title should be capitalized but not italicized. Descriptive titles of the same work can be italicized.\n\nNote: The number (no.) or opus (op.) of the work should remain lowercase.\n\nBeethoven’s Symphony no. 3; or Third Symphony; or Eroica Symphony\n\nChopin’s Nocturne in E-flat Major\n\nEtude in G Minor, op. 33\n\nQuote attribution and degree formatting\n\nGeneral formatting\n\nMake sure to use an en dash (–) with a space after to introduce all testimonials and quote attribution lines. Quote attribution lines should always be italicized on a separate line below the quote. Always use an en dash (–) with spaces on both sides to differentiate between a degree name and an emphasis name.\n\nFollow these same general guidelines in running text but without an introductory en dash or italics. Limited exceptions may be made in small spaces where short copy is required, including removing emphasis and minor names when necessary.\n\nCurrent undergraduate student:\n\n“Quote.”\n\n– Firstname Lastname, DegreeName – EmphasisName major with a minor in MinorName\n\nCurrent graduate student or other:\n\n“Quote.”\n\n– Firstname Lastname, pursuing a master’s, doctorate, graduate certificate, or endorsement in Degree Name – Emphasis Name\n\nAlumni\n\n“Quote.”\n\n– Firstname Lastname, BS DegreeName, ’year\n\nFaculty/staff\n\n“Quote.”\n\n– Firstname Lastname, Title, Department, College\n\nTribal affiliations\n\nFaculty/staff\n\n“Quote.”\n\n– Firstname Lastname (Tribal Affiliations), Title, Department, College\n\nAlumni\n\n“Quote.”\n\n– Firstname Lastname (Tribal Affiliations), BS DegreeName, ’year\n\nor\n\n“Quote.”\n\n– Firstname Lastname (Tribal Affiliations), ’year\n\nBS DegreeName\n\nNotes and exceptions\n\nEnsure that you are using a proper curly apostrophe preceding graduation year.\n\nAlways use “Honors” before the degree name for current Honors students:\n\nMarie Curie, Honors Chemistry – American Chemical Society – Comprehensive – Certified by the American Chemical Society major\n\nFollow all normal capitalization style rules and consult the NAU catalog for degree names whenever possible. However, keep in mind that degree names change over time.\n\nTo avoid jargon, use “Undergraduate Certificate” and “Graduate Certificate” instead of GCERT or UCERT.\n\nAraceli Hermoso-Palacios, Postbaccalaureate Secondary Education Certification Undergraduate Certificate, ’18\n\nAttributions split across two lines should not use a comma at the end of the first line.\n\nWebsites\n\nTreat a reference website as you would an authoritative book or other source material: italicize.\n\nAlways omit the https://www; it’s unnecessary and clutters your text. Still, be sure to link to https addresses, not http, as they provide additional security for your users.\n\nFor more information on how to format a website, see the Addresses page.\n\nWorks of art"
