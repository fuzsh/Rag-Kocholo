        "text": "Originally intended for Polish television, Krzysztof Kieślowski’s (Three Colors trilogy) legendary Dekalog consists of ten one-hour films inspired by the Ten Commandments. Each film explores one or several moral or ethical issues faced by characters living in a stark apartment block in modern Poland. The series, Kieślowski’s most acclaimed work, won numerous international awards, though it was not widely released outside Europe until the late 1990s. The rerelease, championed by Janus Films, will feature the entire series looking better than it has since its initial release.\n\nDEKALOG: THREE (58 minutes)\n\nIt’s Christmas Eve and Ewa has plotted to pass the hours until morning with her former lover Janusz, a family man, by making him believe her husband has gone missing. During this night of recklessness and lies, the pair grapple with choices made when their affair was discovered three years ago, and with the value of their present lives."
