        "text": "01 of 20\n\nAll in the Family (1971–1979)\n\nDespite airing half a century ago, this Emmy-winning sitcom is more relevant the stronger the American political divide becomes. Archie Bunker (Carroll O'Connor) is a working-class man with strongly held \"traditional\" values who often gets into heated debates with his liberal son-in-law, Michael (Rob Reiner). Caught in the crosshairs are Archie's doting wife Edith (Jean Stapleton) and their daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers), as all four discuss some of the hot-button issues facing the country, from war to racism to equal rights. —Kevin Jacobsen\n\nWhere to watch All in the Family: Freevee\n\nCast: Carroll O'Connor, Jean Stapleton, Sally Struthers, Rob Reiner\n\n02 of 20\n\nBob Ross: The Joy of Painting (1983–1994)\n\nPainter Bob Ross' legacy has extended far beyond the reach of this long-running PBS series. The art instructor's calming presence, his love of \"happy little clouds,\" and his iconic perm are simply eternal. The Joy of Painting features Ross teaching how to paint an oil landscape, frequently giving a personal touch to each new object he crafts, making them come to life even further. The series is a great watch for budding painters as much as those who just need a peaceful vibe after a chaotic day. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Bob Ross: The Joy of Painting: Freevee\n\nCast: Bob Ross\n\n03 of 20\n\nCold Case Files (1999–2017)\n\nIt was the only show on A&E circa 1999 that could consistently provide sleepless nights, and not much has changed since. Cold Case Files remains a high watermark of the true-crime documentary format from before the genre became a minefield of cheesy recreations with little emotional resonance. The series consistently delivers mysteries and real-life horrors that true crime fans enjoy, but crucially, it never loses sight of the victims or exploits their suffering for morbid thrills. —Declan Gallagher\n\nWhere to watch Cold Case Files: Freevee\n\nCast: Bill Kurtis\n\n04 of 20\n\nDetectorists (2014–2017)\n\nThis gentle BBC dramedy about metal detectorists (Toby Jones and the program's creator, writer, and director, Mackenzie Crook) who search for treasure in north Essex is quiet, contemplative, and in its own way, often profound. It's also tremendously witty, laugh-out-loud funny, and features some of the best work that its two estimable stars have accomplished in their careers. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Detectorists: Freevee\n\nCast: Toby Jones, Mackenzie Crook\n\n05 of 20\n\nEverwood (2002–2006)\n\nA recently widowed man moves with his two kids to the idyllic small town of Everwood, Colo., in this underrated primetime soap. Treat Williams stars as Andy Brown, a Manhattan neurosurgeon looking for a new start as a single father with his 9-year-old daughter Delia (Vivien Cardone) and 15-year-old son Ephram (Gregory Smith), with whom he has a complicated relationship. Fitting right at home alongside fellow family dramas on the WB like Gilmore Girls and 7th Heaven, Everwood also offered breakthrough roles for future stars Emily VanCamp and Chris Pratt. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Everwood: Freevee\n\nCast: Treat Williams, Gregory Smith, Emily VanCamp, Debra Mooney, John Beasley, Vivien Cardone, Chris Pratt, Stephanie Niznik\n\n06 of 20\n\nEverybody Hates Chris (2005–2009)\n\nBefore his Golden Globe-winning role as Gregory Eddie on Abbott Elementary, the world was introduced to Tyler James Williams with this UPN-turned-CW sitcom. Based loosely on Chris Rock's life growing up in Brooklyn, Williams portrays a teenage Chris as he adjusts to a mostly-white junior high school. But the heart of the show is Chris' dysfunctional family, especially his hard-working father and strong-willed mother, creating a hilarious, relatable portrait of a family trying to get by in 1980s New York. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Everybody Hates Chris: Freevee\n\nCast: Tyler James Williams, Terry Crews, Tichina Arnold, Tequan Richmond, Imani Hakim, Vincent Martella\n\n07 of 20\n\nFringe (2008–2013)\n\nSome cases simply cannot be solved with hard logic, as explored in this criminally underrated sci-fi drama. In the series, the FBI creates a Fringe Division to handle unexplained phenomena, comprising of determined FBI agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), skeptical consultant Peter (Joshua Jackson), and his eccentric scientist father Walter (John Noble). What started as a case-of-the-week procedural with a sci-fi twist soon turned into a fascinating trip through parallel universes, with alternate timelines, doppelgängers, and more, while maintaining strong character dynamics between the core three, each flawed in their own way. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Fringe: Freevee\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Anna Torv, Joshua Jackson, John Noble, Lance Reddick, Kirk Acevedo, Blair Brown, Jasika Nicole, Mark Valley\n\n08 of 20\n\nThe Good Wife (2009–2016)\n\nAt a time when cable and streaming drew most of the attention when it came to quality TV, The Good Wife stood as proof that network television was still capable of greatness. The legal drama stars Julianna Margulies as a Chicago mother whose husband is jailed after a public scandal, leading to her returning to her career as a litigator. Surrounding Margulies, whose powerhouse performance won her two Emmys, is a stellar ensemble including Matt Czuchry, Archie Panjabi, Josh Charles, and Christine Baranski, the latter of whom earned her own Paramount+ spinoff, The Good Fight. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Good Wife: Freevee\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Julianna Margulies, Matt Czuchry, Archie Panjabi, Josh Charles, Christine Baranski, Alan Cumming, Graham Phillips, Makenzie Vega\n\n09 of 20\n\nHigh School (2022)\n\nBased on the memoir by indie music icons Tegan and Sara and adapted by Clea DuVall, High School stars sisters Railey and Seazynn Gilliland as the duo in their teenage years. A brilliant and textured evocation of '90s grunge culture, this Freevee original series examines the twins' coming of age in a highly specific yet somehow universal fashion. The tone is expertly executed, smartly mirroring the charm of the era's girl-power comedies, while the performers always find the truth behind each moment. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch High School: Freevee\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Railey Gilliland, Seazynn Gilliland, Cobie Smulders, Kyle Bornheimer\n\n10 of 20\n\nJury Duty (2023)\n\nJury Duty is the show that made Freevee (and its star, Ronald Gladden) a household name. This cringe mockumentary — think Nathan Fielder adjacent, but gentler — succeeds tremendously in hitting its admittedly broad target of the American justice system. As a juror, Gladden is the only participant who is unaware that the courtroom's scenario is entirely fictitious. Appearing as an insufferable version of himself is James Marsden, who is certainly having one of the most interesting careers in recent memory. (He's terrific here, which is evident by his 2023 Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.) Gladden's sparring with Marsden — the former begins the series as a preening fanboy before realizing the Sonic the Hedgehog star might be the most problematic member of the jury — is the show's crowning glory. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Jury Duty: Freevee\n\nCast: Ronald Gladden, James Marsden, Alan Barinholtz\n\n11 of 20\n\nManhattan (2014–2015)\n\nFor fans of Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, this period drama about the scientists behind the Manhattan Project is a compelling (if highly fictionalized) companion. Set in Los Alamos, N.M., the series is loosely inspired by real-life events but centers on fictional employees working under high-pressure conditions for the greater goal of developing the atomic bomb. Where Manhattan excels is in showing the cost of secrecy — which looms large over the series — and how the members of this isolated town grapple with their unique circumstances. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Manhattan: Freevee\n\nCast: John Benjamin Hickey, Olivia Williams, Ashley Zukerman, Rachel Brosnahan, Daniel Stern, Katja Herbers, Harry Lloyd, Alexia Fast, Christopher Denham, Michael Chernus\n\n12 of 20\n\nThe Middle (2009–2018)\n\nThis nine-season sitcom from the writers of Roseanne centers on a lower-middle-class family trying to get by in a small Indiana town. The Middle was lauded by critics for its realistic depiction of the everyday struggles of blue-collar families — not often seen on network TV — and for the performances by stars Patricia Heaton, Neil Flynn, Charlie McDermott, and Eden Sher, who won a Critics Choice award for her performance as the exuberant middle child, Sue Heck. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Middle: Freevee\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Patricia Heaton, Neil Flynn, Charlie McDermott, Eden Sher, Atticus Shaffer, Chris Kattan\n\n13 of 20\n\nNashville (2012–2018)\n\nThis soapy drama focuses on the careers and love lives of country music singers living in Nashville, Tenn. Connie Britton is Rayna Jaymes, a fading superstar who has conflict with rising country-pop star Juliette Barnes (Hayden Panettiere), who hopes to become the new queen of country music. Complicating matters is Deacon (Charles Esten), Rayna's former lover and current lead guitarist of his band, whom Juliette wants for her tour. The series also features a great soundtrack of original songs. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Nashville: Freevee\n\nCast: Connie Britton, Hayden Panettiere, Clare Bowen, Eric Close, Charles Esten, Jonathan Jackson, Sam Palladio, Robert Wisdom, Powers Boothe\n\n14 of 20\n\nPerson of Interest (2011–2016)\n\nThis prescient crime procedural examines the ethical implications of using state-of-the-art technology to predict future crimes. Jim Caviezel stars as a former soldier who teams up with a reclusive billionaire (Michael Emerson) who develops a surveillance machine that reveals social security numbers of those suspected of terrorist activity. The power of the machine creates further ramifications as rivals try to gain access to it. Not unlike another show on this list, Fringe, Person of Interest began with a simple twist on your average crime procedural but eventually blossomed into an inventive serialized thriller with a lot on its mind. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Person of Interest: Freevee\n\nCast: Jim Caviezel, Taraji P. Henson, Kevin Chapman, Michael Emerson, Amy Acker, Sarah Shahi\n\n15 of 20\n\nPrimo (2023)\n\nShea Serrano's warm-hearted, semi-autobiographical series is one of Freevee's sharpest original works, following teenager Rafa (Ignacio Diaz-Silverio) as he navigates his chaotic home life while dreaming of a successful future. The on-location filming in New Mexico gives the series a realistic heft that plays nicely against the more traditional (though well-devised) sitcom shenanigans. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Primo: Freevee\n\nCast: Ignacio Diaz-Silverio, Christina Vidal, Henri Esteve, Carlos Santos, Stakiah Lynn Washington\n\n16 of 20\n\nRaising Hope (2010–2014)\n\nA 23-year-old man living in a small town impregnates a serial killer and finds himself suddenly raising their baby daughter after the mother is sentenced to death. Not exactly a standard sitcom setup, but Raising Hope finds the dark humor in it, telling the story of the Chances, a working-class family that comes together to raise their newest member, and all the hijinks that come therein. The series, which aired for four seasons on Fox, was at its best when blending the wackiness of the Chance family's circumstances with the realism of everyday life for a lower-middle-class family just trying to find peace of mind. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Raising Hope: Freevee\n\nCast: Lucas Neff, Martha Plimpton, Garret Dillahunt, Shannon Woodward, Gregg Binkley, Cloris Leachman\n\n17 of 20\n\nSchitt's Creek (2015–2020)\n\nThis brilliant comedy concerns a wealthy family who goes bankrupt and is forced to move to the titular town, which they bought years ago as a joke. Industry legends Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy star as the mom and dad, while their sniping, preening adult children are Annie Murphy and Dan Levy (real-life son of Eugene).\n\nSchitt's Creek premiered on the little-known Pop TV network in 2015 before becoming a comfort viewing staple on streaming platforms. It's one of the most irreverent and consistently witty — not to mention surprising — series on television. Much of its indelible success comes from the stellar cast (who swept the Emmys in 2020) who carry the absurd comedy without missing the inherent pathos of the writing. If you've not watched it yet, six seasons of bliss await you. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Schitt's Creek: Freevee\n\nCast: Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Annie Murphy, Dan Levy, Chris Elliott\n\n18 of 20\n\nSpaced (1999–2001)\n\nThis delightful series stars co-creators Simon Pegg and Jessica Hynes as two new friends who decide to take the leap of moving in together. Edgar Wright directs while Nick Frost appears in a supporting role that echoes his and Pegg's relationship in the Wright-helmed Shaun of the Dead. In fact, there's a lot here that gestures broadly at both the director's forthcoming filmography and the careers of Pegg and Frost. It's also one of the funniest and most creative series the BBC has seen. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Spaced: Freevee\n\nCast: Simon Pegg, Jessica Hynes, Nick Frost, Mark Heap\n\n19 of 20\n\nThe Twilight Zone (1959–1964)\n\nThe prototypical anthology series, created and hosted by Rod Serling, is still one of the very best examples of the format. Its episodes are by turn funny, sad, and socially relevant, but also always horrifying. There are moments in the original Twilight Zone run that, without using any overt violence or gore, manage to be some of the most nightmarish and enduring images of all time (in black and white, no less). —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Twilight Zone: Freevee\n\nCast: Rod Serling\n\n20 of 20\n\nWeeds (2005–2012)\n\nThe breezy Showtime series Weeds is inarguably at its best during its first four (of eight) seasons. Even after the plots get a bit outlandish, the brilliant central performance of Mary-Louise Parker as a widow forced into dealing drugs to support her family remains unimpeachable. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Weeds: Freevee\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Mary-Louise Parker, Elizabeth Perkins, Justin Kirk, Andy Milder, Tonye Patano"
