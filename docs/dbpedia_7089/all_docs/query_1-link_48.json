        "text": "ALSO SEE: NASCAR Schedule 2024: Cup Series, Xfinity Series & Camping World Truck Series\n\nAll Times Eastern. PBS programming varies regionally.\n\nSaturday, March 30\n\nThe Ten Commandments\n\nABC, 7pm\n\nCatch a Classic!\n\nNearly every year since 1973, with a few exceptions, ABC has re-aired this gigantic 1956 Best Picture Oscar-nominated religious epic on or around Easter — even though it relates more to the Passover holiday, given that its story comes from the Old Testament book of Exodus about Moses’ (Charlton Heston) deliverance of the Israelites from slavery at the hands of Egyptian pharaoh Rameses II (Yul Brynner). That tradition continues this year, as the network airs director Cecil B. DeMille’s thrilling achievement the night before Easter. Already a very lengthy film in its original format, the TV broadcast somehow seems to keep getting longer each year thanks to commercials, so if you’re recording the movie this year, be aware that your DVR will get quite a workout — ABC has it scheduled in a four-hour-and-44-minute time slot! But with a moviegoing experience this grand, the time flies by. It’s easy to say “they don’t make ’em like that anymore” regarding such films, but in the case of The Ten Commandments, that is literally true — with its massive live crowd shots (of both people and animals) and spectacular set designs, the cost of creating a film like this in the manner in which it was produced would certainly be viewed as prohibitive by any studio today. From an era in which biblical epics were common in Hollywood, DeMille’s work is one of the few that remains so highly watched and beloved to this day. Along with Heston in his iconic role as Moses (and as the voice of God via the burning bush) and Brynner, the film is also star-studded with the likes of Anne Baxter, an oddly cast Edward G. Robinson, Yvonne De Carlo, Debra Paget, John Derek, Vincent Price, John Carradine and more. DeMille is at the height of his directorial powers here as he wrangles so much into a captivating, if melodramatic, presentation. Among the film’s other technical achievements are its Oscar-winning special effects, and it also boasts a grand musical score by Elmer Bernstein.\n\nNCAA Women’s Basketball Tournament: Sweet 16 Regional Semifinals\n\nABC & ESPN, beginning at 1pm Live\n\nThe NCAA Women’s Basketball Tournament Sweet 16 regional semifinal round concludes today with games on ABC and ESPN.\n\nMLB Baseball\n\nFS1 & FOX, beginning at 4pm Live\n\nOpening weekend of the MLB season continues with the Atlanta Braves at the Philadelphia Phillies on FS1, followed by regional action on FOX with either the N.Y.

In the process, she meets the florist’s son (Benjamin Hollingsworth), a minister at the local church, who helps transform her heart and her faith during the Easter season.\n\nSaturday Night Live: “Ramy Youssef/Travis Scott”\n\nNBC, 11:30pm Live; also livestreams on Peacock\n\nComedian/actor Ramy Youssef makes his SNL hosting debut tonight, joined by Travis Scott in his second appearance as musical guest.\n\nGet the latest from ReMIND Magazine!\n\nSunday, March 31\n\nEaster Classics\n\nTCM, beginning at 6:15am\n\nMOVIES!, beginning at 12pm\n\nCatch a Classic!\n\nHappy Easter! To help you celebrate, Turner Classic Movies and MOVIES! have lineups of films representing both themes of faith and general springtime happiness.\n\nTCM’s day begins earlier, with The Green Pastures (1936), which depicts various Bible stories as visualized by Black characters. Rex Ingram plays several roles to lead the cast, which also includes Oscar Polk and Eddie “Rochester” Anderson. After that is The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima (1952), billed as a fact-based look at the apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima reported in 1917 Portugal. After a break to re-air last night’s Noir Alley title (1954’s Pushover), the Easter celebration continues with Godspell (1973), which is based on the 1971 off-Broadway musical and enacts various parables from the Gospel of Matthew. Next, Max von Sydow portrays Jesus Christ in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), the religious epic also featuring Dorothy McGuire, Charlton Heston and Claude Rains among its large ensemble cast. Following that is another famous biblical epic: the Best Picture Oscar-nominated The Robe (1953), led by Best Actor nominee Richard Burton. Moving into primetime, the lineup features Easter Parade (1948), the beloved musical led by Judy Garland and Fred Astaire, accompanied by classic Irving Berlin tunes like “Easter Parade,” “Steppin’ Out With My Baby” and “We’re a Couple of Swells.” TCM’s Easter lineup concludes with another faith-based epic: King of Kings (1961), which tells the story of Jesus (portrayed by Jeffrey Hunter).\n\nMOVIES! celebrates the holiday with two epic religious miniseries. First is Jesus of Nazareth (1977), an eight-hour production that originally aired on NBC in the U.S. (MOVIES! is showing it in two four-hour parts.) Directed by Franco Zeffirelli, the British/Italian coproduction dramatizes the life of Christ (Robert Powell) by blending elements from all four Gospel accounts. The large ensemble cast also features Olivia Hussey as Mary, Anne Bancroft as Mary Magdalene, Emmy nominee James Farentino as Simon Peter and Michael York as John the Baptist, among many others. After that is the 1974 British miniseries Moses the Lawgiver, another British/Italian production featuring many of the writers, cast and crew who would later make Jesus of Nazareth. The six-part drama tells the story of Exodus, led by Burt Lancaster as Moses and Anthony Quayle as Aaron.\n\nInto the Wild Frontier: “Jim Beckwourth: The Long Ride”\n\nINSP, 6pm\n\nJim Beckwourth lives a life of adventure as a trapper, trader and adopted member of the Crow tribe.
