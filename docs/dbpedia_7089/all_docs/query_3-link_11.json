        "text": "Lightroom Version Number\n\n12.3\n\nOperating System\n\nmacOS 12 Monterey\n\nI have about 3000 photos from a trip my husband and I just took [Egypt] and I've been working on them a bit [nothing rigorous, mainly getting rid of terrible ones and straightening or cropping and some auto tone work] - I'd like to show them to him and he can help me figure out where we were [need to add titles in that case] -- I have the Catalog on my Mac mini [Monterey] and the actual images on an attached drive. I am thinking I can show them on the TV from my laptop easily = but not sure about what I need to take with me to the other room to show == catalog only? or the drive plus the catalog [I can move the Catalog to the laptop easily. What's the best way to get them on my laptop so I can show them to Mark and we can go on our journey again?\n\nOK thanks much -- will check out all these ideas but do I just export [save] the Catalog of images to the app or whatever == I don't need to have access also to the 80G which is the source of the images? I guess as long as the previews are all in the Catalog that's enough??\n\nThe source files do not contain any Lightroom adjustments you may have made. This includes cropping to a 16:9 aspect ratio (which I like to do when appropriate.) The SmartTV has a 16:9 aspect ratio and it is often desirable to fill the screen so that you maximize the size of the image when viewed and eliminate the black borders.\n\nSo export the adjusted Lightroom images to get the edited version that you want.\n\nFWIW, I use my 75” Smart TV as a revolving display of my curated photos or latest trip when ever we have guests.\n\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk\n\nOK thanks much -- will check out all these ideas but do I just export [save] the Catalog of images to the app or whatever == I don't need to have access also to the 80G which is the source of the images? I guess as long as the previews are all in the Catalog that's enough??\n\nWhich way to do it depends a lot on what you’d like to do with the photos at the TV.\n\nIf you only want to look at the photos on the TV from the laptop, it can be this simple:\n\nIn Lightroom Classic, select all of the photos you want to show. I usually put them all in a Collection and select that.\n\nChoose File > Export to create JPEG copies in one folder.\n\nMove or copy the folder of JPEG copies to the laptop. No need for catalog, originals, etc, just the JPEG copies.\n\nConnect the laptop to the TV using an HDMI cable. (If the laptop doesn't have an HDMI port, it will need a simple adapter that you can ask us about.\n\nOn current Macs and PCs, you can run a full screen slide show using nothing more than the software that comes with the computer. For example, on a Mac you can select all images in a folder on the Finder desktop, choose File > QuickLook (or press the spacebar), click the full screen mode button, and press left/right arrow keys to look at other images in the folder. (If you want to see the filenames so you can take notes on what info to enter later, use QuickLook in normal view, because the filenames aren’t visible in Full Screen mode.)\n\nIf you also want to update the photo information (titles, captions, etc.) on the laptop while you and your husband look at the photos on the TV, then the laptop also needs to have:\n\nLightroom Classic installed\n\nA catalog containing the photos (doesn’t have to be the original catalog, can be an exported catalog of just the travel photos)\n\nEither copies or Smart Previews of the originals. Normal previews might not work as well.\n\nThe catalog and the originals/Smart Previews can all be exported at once into a folder that you’d copy to the laptop, using File > Export as Catalog. After you finish entering the new information, import the laptop catalog changes into your main catalog on the Mac mini, to merge the updated info with their originals. This is the same workflow that many of us use for a travel catalog, so you can read the steps in this article: How do I use Lightroom Classic on my laptop when I go on vacation?\n\nI am surprised that nobody suggested casting. It is the easiest way to connect a smart TV to a computer. You don't need to physically connect your computer to your TV using a HDMI cable, or even bring to computer near the TV. It is all done through your WIFI. You need Chrome on your computer and it usually connects almost instantly. You will still have to prepare a slide show as described in the previous replies to cast from on your TV.\n\nPersonally, for photos, I prefer copying the JPEGs on a USB key and control the slide show with the TV remote rather than with the computer. I usually generates a LR slideshow, exporting it to JPEG (ALT + Export to PDF [which becomes EXPORT to JPEG when you press ALT key in Windows - sorry I don't know what it is on a MAC, - I never touch them]). I put a small text overly with some metadata -Title, date, etc. - to identify the photo and adjust on export the size of the JPEG to match the resolution of the TV (1920 x 1080 pixels for a HD TV, or 3840 x 2160 for a 4K TV) to reduce the size of the slide show and perhaps, I am not sure if it really matters , by reducing the time it takes the TV to render the file on the screen as it does not need to resize it."
