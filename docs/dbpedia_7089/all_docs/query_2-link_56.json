        "text": "From the biggest streaming services to the most reliable broadcast networks, there are so many shows vying for your time and attention every single week. Lucky for you, the Paste Editors and TV writers sort through the deluge of Peak TV “content” to make sure you’re watching the best the small screen has to offer. Between under-the-radar gems and the biggest, buzziest hits, we keep our finger on TV’s racing pulse so you don’t have to.\n\nThe rules for the Power Rankings are simple: any current series on TV qualifies, whether it’s a comedy, drama, news program, animated series, variety show, or sports event. It can be on a network, basic cable, premium channel, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, YouTube, or whatever you can stream on your smart TV, as long as a new episode was made available within the past week (ending Sunday)—or, in the case of shows released all at once, it has to have been released within the previous four weeks.\n\nBelow is what we’re enjoying right now. Happy viewing!\n\nBest TV Shows for the week of August 12th:\n\nHonorable Mention: Kite-Man: Hell Yeah! (Max), Sunny (Apple TV+), Futurama (Hulu)\n\n5. Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nNetwork: Paramount+\n\nLast Week: Not Eligible\n\nThis Week: This series is a seriously fun romp that captures the spirit of last year’s delightful film.\n\nA year ago this month, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters were made new all over again with the animated cinematic reboot, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. A hybrid melding of 2D and 3D techniques, Mutant Mayhem became a solid box office hit for Paramount and kicked into gear a sequel film and a bridging Paramount+ streaming series, Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which features the same voice cast from the film. The 12-episode season is broken into two arcs of six episodes, as brought to life by showrunners Chris Yost and Alan Wan.\n\nSet two months after the events of the movie, the brothers are integrating into high school life, doing simple things like attending their first Halloween party with April (Ayo Edebiri). But they’re still having adventures too, like the one Leo (Nicolas Cantu) is documenting into a comic book story for posterity’s sake. —Tara Bennett [Full Column]\n\n4. A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder\n\nNetwork: Netflix\n\nLast Week: 4\n\nThis Week: This short ‘n’ sweet teen drama-murder-mystery mashup is a fun binge for all ages.\n\nA Good Girl’s Guide to Murder is based on the young adult mystery novel of the same name—specifically, the UK edition of the book—and follows Pip Fitz-Amobi (Emma Myer) as she looks into the disappearance of Andie Bell (India Lillie Davies) and the subsequent suicide of her boyfriend, Sal Singh (Rahul Pattni) that occured 5 years before. Pip begins her investigation as a school project and things quickly spiral out from there as she starts digging into the past, attempting to disprove the assumption that Andie’s disappearance was a case of murder-suicide at the hands of Sal.\n\nIt is rare that a series is so casually well-rounded. Myers’ performance gives Pip a multitude of layers, from happy-go-lucky to afraid and massively out of her depth. Pip’s ensemble of friends are a believably active part of the story without overwhelming the center thread of Pip trying to find the truth. It is a perfectly-packaged, breezy adventure with a Wednesday alum as the lead, and even though there are two more books worth of material that the series can build off of, the ending of its inaugural season ties things off in a satisfying way. Closing the door on this type of mystery is difficult, but the strength of the writing leaves no stone unturned and no question unanswered—a testament to the rock-solid execution of this series, which undeniably stands as a summer mystery worth binging. —Kathryn Porter [Full Review]\n\n3. Mr. Throwback\n\nNetwork: Peacock\n\nLast Week: Not Eligible\n\nThis Week: The Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping vibe and the surprisingly endearing performance by Steph Curry make this show a delightful binge—and makes a great case for holding onto that Peacock subscription post-Olympics.\n\nMr. Throwback, Peacock’s newest mockumentary series, stars Adam Pally as Danny, a broke, divorced sports memorabilia store-owning father with a complicated relationship with basketball. While in middle school, he was the star of the team coached by his father, Mitch (Tracy Letts), until a scandal upended the rest of his life. Warming the bench for Danny was sixth-grade Steph Curry. In need of cash, Danny decides to visit Steph (who plays himself) after an NBA game. What ensues rekindles their friendship, but not without Danny having to sell a story that may or may not be true. At first glance, the premise of Mr. Throwback sounds a bit much—another poorly written athlete-centered drama at best, a glorified commercial at worst. But Pally and his co-creators—David Caspe, Matthew Libman, and Daniel Libman—give the show a self-awareness of the spectacle that plays to its benefit. While Mr. Throwback falls short of classics like The Office and Parks and Recreation, it is a warm, resonant, and funny show. —Will DiGravio [Full Review]\n\n2. Batman: Caped Crusader\n\nNetwork: Prime Video\n\nLast Week: 2\n\nThis Week: While it is undeniably unfortunate that this series was dropped all at once instead of weekly (as it feels just like those classic Saturday morning Batman stories we know and love), the latest take on the Dark Knight is a must-watch binge.\n\nPrime Video’s Batman: Caped Crusader follows Bruce Wayne (Hamish Linklater), aka Batman, as he conducts a one-man war against the criminals of Gotham City. As Wayne, he plays the role of the charming socialite, but when he’s Bats, his true self, he’s stoic, cerebral, and ruthless. His origin story—being orphaned and psychologically scarred by a mugging gone wrong—is the same as usual, but this telling does a particularly good job hinting at the unhealthy extremes of his obsession with cracking criminal skulls. While he’s not quite as openly unhinged as The Batman’s portrayal of the character (although that film’s director, Matt Reeves, serves as executive producer here), this take makes it clear that, despite his intellect and physical prowess, this is a person entirely shackled to the past. Although Caped Crusader doesn’t reinvent Batman, it successfully draws from several eras of everyone’s favorite poorly adjusted superhero. Its film noir aesthetics, varied villains, and slightly less fatalistic turns create a series that stays true to its roots while finding enough of its own identity to avoid feeling entirely derivative. This story needed a few more episodes to reach its full potential, but it has me eager to return to the dismal streets of Gotham. —Elijah Gonzalez [Full Review]\n\n1. Olympic Games Paris 2024\n\nNetwork: NBC (streaming on Peacock)\n\nLast Week: 1\n\nThis Week: We are so beyond sad to see the Olympics come to a close, but not without being introduced to our new favorite sport: Olympic Breaking.\n\nWatch on Peacock\n\nWe’re only treated to the sweat and fervor of the Summer Olympic Games every four years, and NBC has made it easier (and more fun!) than ever to stay tuned in on all the action. From watching athletes like Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky smash their own records with ease to watching as each country delivers their very best and brightest to the world stage in Paris, the 2024 Olympic Games are undeniably the TV event of the summer, and an incredible, uniting showcase worthy of dominating your airwaves for the entire duration. —Anna Govert"
