        "text": "This article will be updated as shows move on and off streaming services. An asterisk indicates a new addition to the list.\n\nIn some ways the world of streaming isn’t so different from how we watched television in the past. Increasingly, we contend with commercials, cable-like bundle packages, and live channels that seem to have everything except what we actually want to watch. Despite those gripes, though, there are still more TV shows available on demand than ever before, even if they are buried in endless scrolls and algorithmic feeds. It’s our job to help you find them. Whether you subscribe to Apple TV+, Netflix, Disney+, or some combination of them all, we have recommendations for the best TV shows to watch across streaming. You’ll find prestige and fringe favorites alike mixed into the 30 titles below. Watch something worth your time.\n\nJump to a streaming service:\n\nNetflix | Amazon Prime Video | Max | Hulu | Apple TV+ | Peacock | Disney+ | Paramount+\n\nNetflix\n\nBetter Call Saul\n\nYears: 2015-2022\n\nLength: 6 seasons, 63 episodes\n\nCreators: Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould\n\nIt shouldn’t have been so good. Prequel spin-offs that are as good as the original would make for a very small chapter in the book about the history of television. Saul Goodman broke the rules. With a stunning performance from Bob Odenkirk in the central role, the creators of this show used the origin story of a criminal attorney to unpack a story about the pull of being bad. If Breaking Bad was a show about a man willingly becoming evil, Better Call Saul was a show about a man trying so hard to take the righteous path, but falling victim to everything put in his way. This drama has some of the best writing and acting in the history of TV. It’s essential.\n\nBojack Horseman\n\nYears: 2014-2020\n\nLength: 6 seasons, 77 episodes\n\nCreator: Raphael Bob-Waksberg\n\nThere is a lot of solid adult animation on Netflix — don’t sleep on Big Mouth or its anime offerings, either — but the best of the medium is this ingenious examination of celebrity culture, depression, and failed attempts at connection. It just happens to feature talking animals. Will Arnett does fantastic voice work as the title character, the star of a ‘90s sitcom who is struggling to find his way back to the spotlight. Amy Sedaris, Alison Brie, Paul F. Tompkins, and Aaron Paul co-star in a show that felt at first like just another Hollywood satire, but became richer and more emotionally complex with each season.\n\nKey & Peele\n\nYears: 2012-2015\n\nLength: 5 seasons, 53 episodes\n\nCreators: Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele\n\nSketch comedy doesn’t get funnier than this massive Comedy Central hit that reunited a pair of Mad TV stars and let their genius run wild. Hitting hot button issues with fresh insight and hysterical precision, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele revealed themselves to be two of the best comedy writers in the business, leading to a Peabody Award, two Emmy Awards, and millions of fans. You can see their fingerprints on so much of what people find clever in the 2020s.\n\nOzark\n\nYears: 2017-2022\n\nLength: 4 seasons, 44 episodes\n\nCreators: Bill Dubuque, Mark Williams\n\nOne of Netflix’s biggest hits came to a close in 2022 with a critically acclaimed and Emmy-winning final season. Clearly inspired by Breaking Bad, this is a riveting thriller about an ordinary guy who ends up becoming a major player in the international drug trade. Jason Bateman does the best work of his career as Marty Byrde, who moves to the Ozarks with his family and becomes a major money launderer. Bateman, Laura Linney, and Julia Garner earned raves for their work in a show that works from beginning to bloody end.\n\nScavengers Reign\n\nYear: 2023\n\nLength: 1 season, 12 episodes\n\nCreators: Joseph Bennett, Charles Huettner\n\nIt’s another weird case of shifting streaming services with this acclaimed show that Max canceled but Netflix saved. We don’t get a lot of adult sci-fi in animated form, but this sharply rendered and character-driven show follows the survivors of a cargo ship who end up stranded on a distant planet, hunting for supplies and fighting for survival. Voice talent includes Sunita Mani, Wunmi Mosaku, and Alia Shawkat. Watch it so Netflix gives it more life.\n\nSquid Game\n\nYears: 2021-present\n\nLength: 1 season, 9 episodes\n\nCreator: Hwang Dong-hyuk\n\nThe most-viewed show in the history of Netflix rose to that pedestal for multiple reasons. The main one is the incredible accessibility of the concept — a game show with mortal stakes. Released during the pandemic, Squid Game tapped into a worldwide desperation. What would you do to change your fate? The story of a contest for a fortune also became one of Netflix’s biggest critical darlings, landing 14 Emmy nominations, with star Lee Jung-jae becoming the first Asian actor to win Best Actor for a non-English performance. Say what you will about Netflix, the success of this show helped stories from around the world find audiences in America.\n\nAmazon Prime Video\n\nThe Boys\n\nYears: 2019-present\n\nLength: 4 seasons, 32 episodes\n\nCreator: Eric Kripke\n\nOne of Prime’s biggest hits is this satire of superhero culture based on the graphic novel by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. The series stars Karl Urban as Billy Butcher, someone intent on bringing down the collection of the most famous superheroes in the world known as The Seven. The dark comedy asks the question: What if superheroes were sociopaths? The first season is a bit rocky, but ultimately satisfying, and the show only gets more interesting in subsequent seasons.\n\nThe Fall\n\nYears: 2013-2016\n\nLength: 3 seasons, 17 episodes\n\nCreator: Allan Cubitt\n\nGillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan star in this Irish crime drama as a detective and serial killer, respectively. That’s really all you need to know because the brilliance of this series is in how carefully and cleverly it unfolds. As of now, it’s only 17 episodes, so you can watch it all relatively quickly, and then keep hoping that creator Allan Cubitt fulfills his promise to return to this story eventually.\n\nFleabag\n\nYears: 2016-2019\n\nLength: 2 seasons, 12 episodes\n\nCreator: Phoebe Waller-Bridge\n\nArguably the best original series yet produced by Amazon, Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s comedy went from good to great in its masterful second season, one of the best things you can watch on any service or any network. PWB plays the title character, a modern woman looking for stability in a tumultuous life, but that makes Fleabag sound like just another generic comedy when it’s anything but. Just see for yourself.\n\nJury Duty\n\nYear: 2023\n\nLength: 1 season, 8 episodes\n\nCreators: Lee Eisenberg, Gene Stupnitsky\n\nSometimes it just takes a great idea. Two of the key voices behind The Office had one when they created this amazing smash hit that started life on Prime Video’s almost-unknown Freevee (which used to be IMDB TV before being integrated into Prime). Ronald Gladden is the only non-actor in this hoax show that sends the average guy to serve on an unforgettable jury. Ronald’s general kindness and agreeability are key to the show’s success, as is James Marsden’s willingness to poke fun at himself enough to earn his first Emmy nomination.\n\nMax\n\nDeadwood\n\nYears: 2004-2006\n\nLength: 3 seasons, 36 episodes\n\nCreator: David Milch\n\nOne of the best television shows of all time returned to HBO in 2019 over a decade after its cancellation in the form of Deadwood: The Movie. If you’re wondering why fans were so excited to revisit David Milch’s Western, now is the time for an education. This is one of the smartest, deepest shows in the history of television, a program that takes what we think we know about history and the Old West and uses it to tell human stories that resonate today. It’s also got arguably the best overall ensemble in TV history.\n\nFriends\n\nYears: 1994-2004\n\nLength: 10 seasons, 236 episodes\n\nCreators: David Crane, Marta Kauffman\n\nOne of the things that put Max on the map was gaining exclusive streaming rights to one of the biggest comedies of all time. A previous smash on Netflix, this is just a perfect show for streaming. It’s easy to zone out to the familiar comedic rhythms of Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Joey, Monica, and Phoebe. Some of the comedy is undeniably dated now, but it’s easy to still appreciate the chemistry of this incredible cast.\n\nThe Sopranos\n\nYears: 1999-2007\n\nLength: 6 seasons, 86 episodes\n\nCreator: David Chase\n\nOften cited as the best TV show of all time, David Chase’s award-winning masterpiece can truly be credited with altering the landscape forever. Who knew when Tony Soprano sat down to talk to his therapist about panic attacks that a cultural phenomenon would come from it? The first season of The Sopranos is a perfect season of television. Just watch it and try not to be hooked enough to watch it all. Maybe even twice.\n\nSuccession\n\nYears: 2018-2023\n\nLength: 4 seasons, 39 episodes\n\nCreator: Jesse Armstrong\n\nThe most acclaimed HBO show since the end of Game of Thrones, this drama only got more popular with each passing season, ending at the top of its game in 2023. Its final season became one of the most Emmy-nominated in history, as creator Jesse Armstrong concluded the story of the Roy family (at least for now) with a hysterical, moving run of episodes.\n\nThe Wire\n\nYears: 2002-2008\n\nLength: 5 seasons, 60 episodes\n\nCreator: David Simon\n\nTelevision doesn’t get more ambitious than David Simon’s five-season examination of life in a modern city. Using Baltimore as his template, Simon looks at every aspect of urban life, starting with what first seems like a simple-but-smart look at cops and criminals and expanding the canvas to include dock workers, educators, journalists, and politicians over the course of the series run. There’s a reason some people consider this the best show in the history of television.\n\nHulu\n\nAbbott Elementary\n\nYears: 2021-present\n\nLength: 4 seasons, 49 episodes\n\nCreator: Quinta Brunson\n\nThis is the show that proved that there’s still life in the network TV comedy. Hysterically funny and subtle in its social commentary, it’s the tale of a Philadelphia elementary school with a great staff but few resources. Shot like a mockumentary, it has incredibly sharp writing, but Abbott Elementary’s best asset is its ensemble, one of the best of its era of comedy television.\n\nThe Americans\n\nYears: 2013-2018\n\nLength: 6 seasons, 75 episodes\n\nCreator: Joe Weisberg\n\nArguably the best show of the 2010s, this FX drama stars Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys as Elizabeth and Philip Jennings, a seemingly average couple with two kids living in ‘80s suburbia. It turns out that they’re actually undercover Russian operatives, staying on step agent of the FBI agent (Noah Emmerich) who happens to be their neighbor. Smart, sexy, moving, and thrilling, this show really feels like nothing else on TV then or now. It’s such a daring, brilliantly written program, and time will be very kind to it.\n\nThe Bear\n\nYears: 2022-present\n\nLength: 3 seasons, 28 episodes\n\nCreator: Christopher Storer\n\nOne of the most acclaimed new shows of the last few years, The Bear is the story of a sandwich shop owner in the Windy City, and the pressures of life in the food business. Jeremy Allen White is spectacular in the lead role, but he’s ably supported by great turns from Ayo Edibiri and Ebon Moss-Bacharach. Expect them all to be Emmy players again. It’s third season wasn’t as big of a hit, but overall it’s both one of the funniest and most stress-inducing shows on TV.\n\nMoonlighting\n\nYears: 1985-1989\n\nLength: 5 seasons, 67 episodes\n\nCreator: Glenn Gordon Caron\n\nHeld up in music rights issues for decades, this ABC hit dramedy was finally made available to Hulu subscribers in October 2023. A show so far ahead of its time that it feels like creators are still catching up to it, Moonlighting made Bruce Willis a star as David Addison, half of a couple with Cybill Shepherd that solved crimes while defining the will-they-won’t-they dynamic of the era. It fell apart too soon, but there’s still so much to love over these five seasons. Start with a primer of the most essential episodes of Moonlighting.\n\nShōgun\n\nYear: 2024-present\n\nLength: 1 season, 10 episodes\n\nCreators: Rachel Kondo, Justin Marks\n\nForty-four years after the ratings-breaking mini-series of the same name, FX has returned to the world of Shōgun, based on the hit novel by James Clavell. This 10-episode series is a gorgeously rendered epic, the story of a British sailor named Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis) who lands on the Japanese shores at a time of great conflict, and completely changes history in the process. Co-starring Hiroyuki Sanada and Anna Sawai, this version if even better than the Richard Chamberlain original. It may have begun its life as a limited series, but it’s been renewed for another season.\n\nApple TV+\n\nFor All Mankind\n\nYear: 2019–present\n\nLength: 4 seasons, 40 episodes\n\nCreators: Ronald D. Moore, Matt Wolpert, Ben Nedivi\n\nOne of the geniuses behind the reboot of Battlestar Galactica collaborated on a very different kind of science fiction, a character-driven drama that imagines life in the United States in an alternate reality in which the Soviet Union landed on the moon before the United States. That’s just the setup for a show that has gone so many unexpected places since, incorporating figures from history like Neil Armstrong, Sally Ride, and even Wernher von Braun into a show that defies expectations. History is going to be very kind to this drama.\n\nSeverance\n\nYear: 2022–present\n\nLength: 1 season, 9 episodes\n\nCreator: Dan Erickson\n\nOne of the most acclaimed new shows of the 2020s, Severance takes a clever concept and runs full speed with it into unexpected places. Adam Scott stars as an employee at a company that uses a revolutionary process that literally divides the work-life dynamic in a new way. What if your work self and home self had different lives, memories, and concerns? Britt Lower, Patricia Arquette, and Christopher Walken co-star in this incredibly smart and witty sci-fi drama.\n\nPeacock\n\nColumbo\n\nYears: 1968-1978\n\nLength: 10 seasons, 69 episodes\n\nCreators: Richard Levinson, William Link\n\nMaybe it was the success of the Natasha Lyonne hit Poker Face, but there was a recent revival in the pop culture universe for the best trenchcoat-wearing crime solver of all time. Peter Falk plays the title character, an average guy with a brilliant mind for solving crimes. Its second life on streaming has guided new viewers to the simple charms of one of the best mystery shows of all time.\n\nThose About to Die\n\nYear: 2024-present\n\nLength: 1 season, 8 episodes\n\nCreator: Robert Rodat\n\nThe writer of Saving Private Ryan adapted this incredibly expensive – rumored north of $140 million — original series that includes direction by disaster master Roland Emmerich and a supporting role for the legendary Anthony Hopkins. With Gladiator 2 on the horizon, why not consider this as a sort of opening act to the kind of swords-and-sandals bloodshed that used to be such a big part of pop culture?\n\nThe Traitors\n\nYears: 2023-present\n\nLength: 2 seasons, 23 episodes\n\nCreators: Lee Gant, Christine Rose\n\nThe biggest new reality TV hit of 2023 so far is this gem of a competition show with a delightful hosting job by Alan Cumming. He guides a fascinating array of reality TV stars from shows like Below Deck, Survivor, and Big Brother through a game with a simple premise — three of them are traitors. Can the contestants figure out who’s stabbing them in the back before they all end up eliminated? It’s a smartly crafted show.\n\nYellowstone\n\nYears: 2018-present\n\nLength: 5 seasons, 47 episodes\n\nCreators: Taylor Sheridan, John Linson\n\nThis Kevin Costner Western slowly became one of the biggest shows on television. Starting life on the Paramount Network, it now airs original episodes on Paramount+, but the catalog of its first four seasons remains on Peacock — TV rights are weird. Yellowstone has grown to become a legitimate franchise with four spin-offs — 1883 and 1923 are over on Paramount+ and 6666 and 1944 are in development. They love their numbers.\n\nDisney+\n\nAndor\n\nYears: 2022–present\n\nLength: 1 season, 12 episodes\n\nCreator: Tony Gilroy\n\nIs this the best Star Wars TV series? It’s certainly the one that takes this world the most seriously, an incredibly smart origin story for Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), one of the characters from 2016’s Rogue One. It helps that the film’s co-writer, Tony Gilroy, is the creative force behind this captivating show, one that doesn’t talk down to its audience like so many of the Disney+ Star Wars shows have a bad habit of doing. It’s also remarkably well made, looking more like a short film every episode than an episode of television.\n\nX-Men ‘97\n\nYear: 2024-present\n\nLength: 1 season, 10 episodes\n\nCreator: Beau DeMayo\n\nThis show feels impossible. Not only does it reboot the mid-’90s hit X-Men: The Animated Series, it picks up right where that show ended in 1997, complete with most of the same voice cast in key roles. It’s like being transported back in time. And it’s much more than mere nostalgia, taking this chance to create one of the most thematically rich comic book shows on any streaming service.\n\nParamount+\n\nEvil\n\nYears: 2019-2024\n\nLength: 4 seasons, 47 episodes\n\nCreators: Robert King, Michelle King\n\nThe creators of The Good Fight launched a very different (but just as smart) series on CBS in 2019, but it moved to Paramount+ for its second season and got even better. Katja Herbers and Mike Colter star in a show that’s really about the modern definition of evil, and how it manifests in everything from social media to crypto currency. This became one of the smartest shows on TV, a modern X-Files riff that’s sexy, creepy, and brilliant.\n\nThe Star Trek franchise\n\nYears: Various\n\nLength: Various\n\nCreator: Gene Roddenberry\n\nParamount and Star Trek have been partners for generations, so it makes sense that the streaming service has weeks-worth of trips to the final frontier for fans to watch. There’s a wave of originals like Discovery, Prodigy, Lower Decks, Strange New Worlds, and Picard. But the real draw remains the classics, including The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise. You could watch nothing but Star Trek on Paramount+ and have little time to do anything else."
