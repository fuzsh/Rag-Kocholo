In the 2022 sequel Black Panther: Wakanda Forever she replaced Zuri (Forest Whitaker) as Wakanda’s Elder Statesman.\n\nShe was also highly celebrated for her appearances in Beyoncé’s Disney musical film based on The Lion King, in which she played Simba’s mother, Sarabi.\n\nHer most recent role was in Heart of the Hunter, released earlier this year, and she also appeared in TV series Soon Comes Night in February.\n\nChiume was given several awards, including an NTVA Avanti Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series for her role in Soul City in 2000.\n\nLater in 2009, she received a South African Film and Television Award (SAFTA) for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama for her role as Stella Moloi in the family drama Zone 14.\n\nShe was born in Welkom, in Free State province, to a Malawian father and a Zulu mother. She trained as a nurse but ended up as a teacher.\n\nIn 2022, she told the MacG Podcast that she would like for people to remember her the way they choose to.\n\n“I have impacted each and every person in a different way. Whatever way I have impacted you, remember me that way.”\n\nTributes have flooded in on social media with some of her fans describing her as a versatile actress who played a multitude of roles in the South African television industry.\n\n\"Her outstanding work will always be remembered,\" the South African government posted on X.\n\nShe leaves behind four children - two sons and two daughters."
