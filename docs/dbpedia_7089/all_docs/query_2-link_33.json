        "text": "Gone are the days when there were only a few networks to watch. Today, the options are virtually endless. Thanks to streaming services, viewers can find something to keep them entertained and glued to their TV screens and devices. The best part? The choices are becoming more diverse. Although still underrepresented, according to a recent report, during 2021-2022, \"actors of color reached their highest share of lead roles in broadcast,\" and women of color made \"significant gains as writers in broadcast shows.\"\n\nThat means, now more than ever, there are television shows that highlight the complexity, diversity and beauty of the Black community and feature Black actors, producers, writers and directors. Whether you’re in the mood for a mind-bending thriller, gut-busting comedy, serious drama or enlightening documentary, this round-up includes a variety of genres to choose from. No matter what you decide, each of these selections showcase Black creatives in front and behind the camera.\n\nWhile watching a good show is a great way to unwind and escape from life’s harsh realities, it’s also therapeutic and mentally beneficial. When people are able to see characters who look like them reflected on the screen, it can help them to feel seen, heard and accepted in the world we live in. And that is why diversity and representation across all genres is so important, especially for young people and those looking for validation.\n\nSo, sit back, grab your favorite snacks and get ready to be entertained from the comfort of your couch."
