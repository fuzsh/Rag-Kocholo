        "text": "This post is updated frequently as TV shows leave and enter Netflix. *New additions are indicated with an asterisk.\n\nNetflix forever changed the way people watch television, moving to full-season drops instead of a weekly format and creating the concept of binge viewing. With a mix of original programming and shows they’ve picked up from other networks, Netflix became the on-demand home for millions of subscribers. Alongside the best movies on Netflix, people consume its television offerings to the tune of billions of hours a year, whether they’re sampling their favorite old episodes of shows like Seinfeld or checking out original programs like Squid Game or Stranger Things. Distilling a massive catalog down to only 30 shows is tough, but these are the best the streaming giant has to offer, the ones that everyone with a Netflix subscription should watch first, regularly updated as shows leave the service and new ones take their place.\n\nThis Month’s Critic’s Pick\n\n*Lost\n\nYears: 2004-2010\n\nLength: 6 seasons, 121 episodes\n\nCreators: Jeffrey Lieber, J.J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof\n\nTalk about a game changer. Our current era of twisty TV doesn’t happen without this ABC masterpiece to build the foundation. The first season was a legitimate phenomenon, telling the story of a group of plane crash survivors who discover they have landed in a very unusual place. Brilliantly written and rivetingly directed, it holds up very well, even in the “lesser” seasons that turned fans on the show.\n\nDrama\n\nBaby Reindeer\n\nYear: 2024\n\nLength: 1 season, 7 episodes\n\nCreator: Richard Gadd\n\nThe biggest breakthrough series for Netflix since Squid Game, this seven-part comedy/drama/thriller came completely out of nowhere, becoming one of the streaming company’s most-watched shows largely through word of mouth. Richard Gadd plays a version of himself named Donny Dunn, a stand-up comedian who is nice to a bar-goer named Martha (Jessica Gunning), which leads to a case of severe stalking. Unpredictable and unsettling, Baby Reindeer became a hit by being like nothing else on Netflix.\n\nBand of Brothers\n\nYear: 2001\n\nLength: 1 season, 10 episodes\n\nCreators: Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg\n\nOne of the best limited TV series of all time, Band of Brothers was a momentous achievement, something that really doesn’t get the attention it deserves for shifting the TV landscape. This landmark in the medium was created by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, adapted from the WWII history book of the same name by Stephen E. Ambrose, and it’s quite simply one of the best things that ever aired on TV. Pay tribute to the brave men who fought in WWII in this deeply personal, moving blend of history and filmmaking. Note: Masters of the Air, produced by Hanks and Spielberg, premieres on Apple TV+ in January 2024, and should bring people back to the original.\n\nBeef\n\nYears: 2023-\n\nLength: 1 season, 10 episodes\n\nCreator: Lee Sung Jin\n\nOne of the best shows of 2023, and a multiple Emmy winner for Best Limited Series (even though it’s reportedly returning for a second season – the Emmys are weird), Beef is near the top of Netflix original programming all time. The writing is razor sharp in this tale of road rage gone wild, but it’s greatest asset is its pair of performers: the amazing Ali Wong and Steven Yeun. There’s a reason they’ve both won basically every award they were eligible to win.\n\nBetter Call Saul\n\nYears: 2015-2022\n\nLength: 6 seasons, 63 episodes\n\nCreators: Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould\n\nIt shouldn’t have been so good. Prequel spin-offs that are as good as the original would make for a very small chapter in the book about the history of television. Saul Goodman broke the rules. With a stunning performance from Bob Odenkirk in the central role, the creators of this show used the origin story of a criminal attorney to unpack a story about the pull of being bad. If Breaking Bad was a show about a man willingly becoming evil, Better Call Saul was a show about a man trying so hard to take the righteous path, but falling victim to everything put in his way. This drama has some of the best writing and acting in the history of TV. It’s essential.\n\nBreaking Bad\n\nYears: 2008-2013\n\nLength: 5 seasons, 62 episodes\n\nCreator: Vince Gilligan\n\nOn the Mount Rushmore of modern dramas for most people, this AMC hit stars Bryan Cranston as the legendary Walter White, a normal New Mexico science teacher who makes a radical decision when he’s diagnosed with stage-three lung cancer — he becomes the king of meth in the Southwest. A complex study of morality that allows its protagonist to, well, live up to the title, this show made Cranston a star (and the great Aaron Paul too) but it’s really the writing that made it so incredible. It’s also one of those great shows that didn’t overstay its welcome, wrapping up before it got stale.\n\n*Evil\n\nYears: 2021-2022\n\nLength: 2 seasons, 20 episodes (on Netflix)\n\nCreators: Robert & Michelle King\n\nIn early 2024, Paramount+ announced that they would be canceling Evil after its fourth season, granting the creators a four-episode fifth and final season to air immediately after its conclusion—Paramount+ is going out of business, basically. However, something interesting has happened to the first two seasons, which were shipped over to Netflix—they’ve been hits. Could one of the best shows of its era be resurrected on Netflix? Stay tuned.\n\nMindhunter\n\nYears: 2017-2019\n\nLength: 2 seasons, 19 episodes\n\nCreator: Joe Penhall\n\nJoe Penhall and David Fincher’s loose adaptation of the story of the man who invented profiling serial killers is a tense, riveting drama with some of the best performances and visual language to date in a Netflix series. The first season saw the creation of the Behavioral Science Unit and interviews with real serial killers based on actual conversations. The second got even richer, digging into the role doubt plays in the lives of men trying to stop pure evil. It’s only a shame that the budget for a planned third season got too high for Netflix. Maybe if enough of us watch it again, they’ll change their mind.\n\nOne Day\n\nYear: 2024\n\nLength: 1 season, 14 episodes\n\nCreator: Nicole Taylor\n\nAmbika Mod and Leo Woodall are as charming as can be in this Netflix hit, a rom-com that uses a structure that’s uniquely suited for streaming television—it certainly works better than the 2011 film of the same name, also based on the David Nicholls book. Mod and Woodall play a couple who the show checks in on every year over the course of their tumultuous and unpredictable relationship.\n\nOzark\n\nYears: 2017-2022\n\nLength: 4 seasons, 44 episodes\n\nCreators: Bill Dubuque, Mark Williams\n\nOne of Netflix’s biggest hits came to a close in 2022 with a critically acclaimed and Emmy-winning final season. Clearly inspired by Breaking Bad, this is a riveting thriller about an ordinary guy who ends up becoming a major player in the international drug trade. Jason Bateman does the best work of his career as Marty Byrde, who moves to the Ozarks with his family and becomes a major money launderer. Bateman, Laura Linney, and Julia Garner earned raves for their work in a show that works from beginning to bloody end.\n\nThe Queen’s Gambit\n\nYear: 2020\n\nLength: 1 season, 7 episodes\n\nCreator: Scott Frank\n\nOne of the best mini-series of the current decade, this one was there for people during the first year of the pandemic, turning chess into a new kind of dramatic phenomenon. Based on the book of the same name by Walter Tevis, it stars Anya Taylor-Joy as Beth Harmon, a chess prodigy who rises in the male-dominated world while also battling her own addictions. Taylor-Joy is spectacular but it’s the sharp writing here that makes it a TV checkmate.\n\nRipley\n\nYear: 2024\n\nLength: 1 season, 8 episodes\n\nCreator: Steven Zaillian\n\nThe first adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s infamous novel since Matt Damon and Jude Law cavorted around Italy stars the phenomenal Andrew Scott as the title character, Tom Ripley. This version hews a little closer to the source and also has the coldest, most clinical take so far, courtesy of Robert Elswit’s gorgeous black-and-white cinematography and Steven Zaillian’s ace direction. It’s one of the best Netflix originals ever.\n\nSix Feet Under\n\nYears: 2001-2005\n\nLength: 5 seasons, 63 episodes\n\nCreator: Alan Ball\n\nPeter Krause headlined this HBO drama from Alan Ball that incorporated issues of family and grief in ways that television hadn’t really done before. Sure, there had been family dramas on network TV for generations but none that explored the issues of how much family ties can bind with the adult flavor of what was often one of the best shows on TV. Ball & Co. couldn’t quite keep the quality level up for the entire run, but they did stick the landing with one of the best series finales of all time.\n\nSquid Game\n\nYears: 2021-present\n\nLength: 1 season, 9 episodes\n\nCreator: Hwang Dong-hyuk\n\nThe most-viewed show in the history of Netflix rose to that pedestal for multiple reasons. The main one is the incredible accessibility of the concept — a game show with mortal stakes. Released during the pandemic, Squid Game tapped into a worldwide desperation. What would you do to change your fate? The story of a contest for a fortune also became one of Netflix’s biggest critical darlings, landing 14 Emmy nominations, with star Lee Jung-jae becoming the first Asian actor to win Best Actor for a non-English performance. Say what you will about Netflix, the success of this show helped stories from around the world find audiences in America.\n\nUnbelievable\n\nYear: 2019\n\nLength: 1 season, 8 episodes\n\nCreators: Susannah Grant, Ayelet Waldman, Michael Chabon\n\nBased on the article “An Unbelievable Story of Rape,” this award-winning mini-series is one of the toughest watches on Netflix, but it’s also so dramatically rewarding. The show dramatizes a series of rapes in Washington and Colorado from 2008 to 2011, focusing on a survivor named Marie (Kaitlyn Dever) and the two detectives trying to solve the case, played brilliantly by Toni Collette and Merritt Wever. Sharply written and deeply moving, this is an essential piece of work.\n\nThe Walking Dead\n\nYears: 2010-2022\n\nLength: 11 seasons, 177 episodes\n\nCreator: Frank Darabont\n\nThe Walking Dead helped redefine appointment television just when ratings were starting to erode to streaming services and DVRs. The show became a massive hit because everyone had to watch it on Sunday night, largely so they wouldn’t hear spoilers about a major character death. It kind of lumbered to a conclusion in 2022, but the show is still producing spin-offs, including a new one in January 2024. It truly will never die.\n\nComedy\n\nArrested Development\n\nYears: 2003-2006, 2018-2019\n\nSeasons: 5\n\nCreator: Mitchell Hurwitz\n\nOne of the best comedies of all time had to get canceled to really find its audience. And then had to be rebooted to kind of lose it. Listen, everyone agrees that the two Netflix seasons of the story of the Bluth family are a bit underwhelming, but they have their moments. It’s just that they can’t touch the absolute brilliance of the three FOX seasons. Maybe just watch those and leave the rest to history.\n\nBojack Horseman\n\nYears: 2014-2020\n\nLength: 6 seasons, 77 episodes\n\nCreator: Raphael Bob-Waksberg\n\nThere is a lot of solid adult animation on Netflix — don’t miss Big Mouth or its anime offerings, either — but the best of the medium is this ingenious examination of celebrity culture, depression, and failed attempts at connection. It just happens to feature talking animals. Will Arnett does fantastic voice work as the title character, the star of a ‘90s sitcom who is struggling to find his way back to the spotlight. Amy Sedaris, Alison Brie, Paul F. Tompkins, and Aaron Paul co-star in a show that felt at first like just another Hollywood satire, but became richer and more emotionally complex with each season.\n\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine\n\nYears: 2013-2021\n\nLength: 8 seasons, 153 episodes\n\nCreators: Dan Goor, Michael Schur\n\nAccused of copaganda near the end of its run, this NBC/Fox show was always more progressive and cleverer than it got credit for with critics. Created by two of the geniuses behind Parks and Recreation, it gave Andy Samberg his best part, but he was only one player in a consistently hysterical ensemble, including Stephanie Beatriz, Terry Crews, Melissa Fumero, and an absolutely hysterical Andre Braugher, who gave one of the best comedy supporting performances of the 2010s. Watch it in his honor.\n\nChappelle’s Show\n\nYears: 2003-2006\n\nLength: 3 seasons, 28 episodes\n\nCreators: Dave Chappelle, Neal Brennan\n\nEveryone has an opinion on Dave Chappelle in the 2020s, but back in the 2000s, he wasn’t yet a household name when his sketch comedy show premiered on Comedy Central. Everything changed. In instant hit, Chappelle’s Show felt like the new wave of comedy unfolding before our eyes. It was what was going to replace your parents’ sketch comedy in shows like Saturday Night Live. And then Dave walked away from it. It holds up incredibly well, and it’s easy to see its influence on so many imitators since.\n\nThe Good Place\n\nYears: 2016-2020\n\nLength: 4 seasons, 53 episodes\n\nCreator: Michael Schur\n\nThe brilliant creator of Parks and Recreation moved on to one of the most ambitious comedies to ever air on network television with this follow-up. Honestly, it’s crazy it lasted four seasons. Kristen Bell plays Eleanor, a recently deceased woman who finds herself in Heaven … maybe. Eleanor meets Michael (Ted Danson), the man who runs the joint, and befriends memorable characters played by William Jackson Harper, Jameela Jamil and Manny Jacinto as they discover the truth behind where they are and what it means to be “good,” in this life or the next.\n\nI Think You Should Leave\n\nYears: 2019-present\n\nLength: 2 seasons, 12 episodes\n\nCreators: Tim Robinson, Zach Kanin\n\nIf you’re a fan of left-of-center humor like Mr. Show or the 12:55pm SNL sketches written by Kyle Mooney, you owe it to yourself to watch one of the most buzzed-about Netflix Originals that’s still producing new episodes, Tim Robinson and Zach Kanin’s totally bizarre comedy hit. How do you describe one of the weirdest comedy shows on Netflix? You really can’t. Just watch it. And then prepare yourself for the third season, which is coming soon.\n\nKey & Peele\n\nYears: 2012-2015\n\nLength: 5 seasons, 53 episodes\n\nCreators: Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele\n\nSketch comedy doesn’t get funnier than this massive Comedy Central hit that reunited a pair of Mad TV stars and let their genius run wild. Hitting hot button issues with fresh insight and hysterical precision, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele revealed themselves to be two of the best comedy writers in the business, leading to a Peabody Award, two Emmy Awards, and millions of fans. You can see their fingerprints on so much of what people find funny and clever in the 2020s.\n\nSeinfeld\n\nYears: 1989-1998\n\nLength: 9 seasons, 180 episodes\n\nCreators: Larry David, Jerry Seinfeld\n\nMaybe you’ve heard of it? One of the biggest comedies of all time became a hit again in the streaming era when Netflix paid a fortune to have exclusive streaming rights to the misadventures of Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer. Some of it plays a little more problematically now than it did three decades ago, but most of it is still razor-sharp and funnier than anything on TV right now.\n\nHorror, Sci-fi, and Fantasy\n\nBlack Mirror\n\nYears: 2011-present\n\nLength: 5 seasons, 22 episodes\n\nCreator: Charlie Brooker\n\nHas the world gotten too weird for Black Mirror? Creator Charlie Brooker implied as much not long ago, but has recently revealed that he’s working on a new season of this Twilight Zone–inspired gem. Released in 3-episode seasons in the U.K. originally (and a Christmas special after season two), Black Mirror shifted when it became a Netflix original in 2016, releasing 6-episode seasons in 2016 and 2017, an interactive film in 2018, and a 3-episode season in 2019. Standouts include “The Entire History of You,” “Be Right Back,” “San Junipero,” and “USS Callister.” Start there and you’ll end up watching them all.\n\nThe Haunting of Hill House\n\nYears: 2018\n\nLength: 1 season, 10 episodes\n\nCreator: Mike Flanagan\n\nThe director of Doctor Sleep has become the king of horror at Netflix, and it really started with this masterpiece, his best TV series to date. Flanagan distilled the influential source material here into something altogether new, terrifying, and heartbreaking. Most horror TV shows aren’t honestly scary, but Hill House is legit terrifying in the way it blends an old-fashioned ghost story with more human fears like addiction and suicide. It’s really going to stand the test of time.\n\nRussian Doll\n\nYears: 2019-present\n\nLength: 2 seasons, 15 episodes\n\nCreators: Natasha Lyonne, Leslye Headland, Amy Poehler\n\nOne of Netflix’s most critical darlings on the comedy scene was this sci-fi gem, a riff on Groundhog Day about a woman living the same day over and over again. More than just a straight comedy, this Natasha Lyonna vehicle uses its concept to comment on trauma, isolation, and general midlife ennui. In the first season, Lyonne’s character kept reliving her 36th birthday party until she met someone locked in a similar cycle. The second season was a bit less successful but arguably more ambitious.\n\nScavengers Reign\n\nYear: 2023\n\nLength: 1 season, 12 episodes\n\nCreators: Joseph Bennett, Charles Huettner\n\nIt’s another weird case of shifting streaming services with this acclaimed show that Max canceled but Netflix saved. We don’t get a lot of adult sci-fi in animated form, but this sharply rendered and character-driven show follows the survivors of a cargo ship who end up stranded on a distant planet, hunting for supplies and fighting for survival. Voice talent includes Sunita Mani, Wunmi Mosaku, and Alia Shawkat. Watch it so Netflix gives it more life.\n\nStranger Things\n\nYears: 2016-present\n\nLength: 4 seasons, 34 episodes\n\nCreator: The Duffer Brothers\n\nMore than just nostalgia farming, this ‘80s-inspired hit became a worldwide phenomenon through the power of its riveting storytelling. Sure, it’s easy to see the influences of King and Spielberg here, but characters like Hopper (David Harbour) and Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) have become icons in their own right. The fourth season was arguably a bit bloated, but the show is reportedly coming in for a landing with a fifth and final season. Make sure you’re caught up before that happens.\n\nSupernatural\n\nYears: 2005-2020\n\nLength: 15 seasons, 327 episodes\n\nCreator: Eric Kripke\n\nIsn’t it kind of appropriate that a show about ghost hunters wouldn’t die? Supernatural premiered way back when The CW was still The WB in 2005 and then just kept going for an amazing fifteen seasons before coming to an end. That’s a lot of spooky adventures for Sam and Dean Winchester, two of fantasy television’s most beloved characters.
