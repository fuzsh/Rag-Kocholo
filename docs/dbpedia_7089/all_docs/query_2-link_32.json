        "text": "Release date: TBC on Netflix\n\nGuy Ritchie's hugely popular crime drama, The Gentlemen, will be back for a second series, Netflix has confirmed.\n\nWith an all-star cast, including Theo James, Kaya Scodelario, Ray Winstone, Vinnie Jones and Joely Richardson, the first series follows Eddie (Theo James), who not only inherits the Duke of Halstead title following his father's death but the illegal weed farm secretly growing on his family estate.\n\nDespite his reluctance to work with the gangsters behind it, Susie (Kaya Scodelario) and her mobster dad Bobby Glass (Ray Winstone), Eddie soon becomes embroiled in the criminal underworld.\n\nWith James, Scodelario, and Daniel Ings — who plays Eddie’s brother, Freddy — all confirmed to rejoin for season two, the second series will follow Eddie as he takes on his new role as co-owner of the operation.\n\nWe can't wait for this, although filming is not set to start until next year, so we have a while to wait.\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nSuits fans, rejoice, because a reboot is officially in the works. Filming for the new spin-off, Suits: LA, has now kicked off, according to reports by Variety.\n\nThe legal drama will follow Ted Black, a former federal prosecutor who moves from New York to Los Angeles to work with the city's elite at Black Lane Law, an entertainment and criminal firm.\n\nWe can't wait for the courtroom drama to unfold...\n\nRelease date: TBC in 2025 on HBO\n\nFans have gone wild as HBO has finally unveiled the first teaser trailer for season three of its hugely popular series, The White Lotus, and it looks like we're in for more sun-soaked, five-star drama with a new cohort of VIP hotel guests – this time in Thailand.\n\n\"New luxuries await you in Thailand,\" the network wrote alongside the clip, which includes footage of a boat racing across the ocean, a luxurious hotel pool and a Thai boxing fight. \"What happens in Thailand stays in Thailand,\" says one of the S3 characters on the voiceover.\n\nWe also get a first look some of the new cast, including Parker Posey, Jason Isaacs and Patrick Schwarzenegger, as well as returning S1 star Natasha Rothwell, who is the only recurring character linking this series to previous ones.\n\nTo say we can't wait for this is a serious understatement.\n\nRelease date: TBC on Channel 4\n\nChannel 4 has announced a new four-part TV adaptation of Louise Kennedy's acclaimed novel Trespasses, a forbidden love story set against the backdrop of the Troubles.\n\nIt will star Sex Education's Gillian Anderson – who will also executive produce – as well as Lola Petticrew (Bloodlands) and Tom Cullen (The Gold).\n\nThe Channel 4 synopsis reads: \"1975, in a town outside Belfast. Whilst working one night behind the bar of her family pub, serving a mixed crowd including the locally stationed soldiers, Catholic schoolteacher Cushla (Lola Petticrew) meets Michael (Cullen), an older Protestant married man, who often defends IRA suspects and is friends with cultured bohemians who enrage and intrigue Cushla. Worlds apart, Cushla knows a relationship like this spells all kinds of trouble, but they are irresistibly drawn to one another.\n\n\"In a place where loose lips cost lives and danger lurks in the shadows, amidst the fear and paranoia, this illicit affair between Cushla and Michael ignites and burns bright...\"\n\nSpeaking about her role as Cushla's mother, Gina, Gillian Anderson said in a release: \"I fell in love with Louise’s stunning book when I read it in proof. I was immediately drawn to the tragi-comic creation that is Gina and couldn’t resist when Louise asked me to play her.\"\n\nWe can't wait for this.\n\nRelease date: TBC on Netflix\n\nDear readers, we have some exciting news. Netlix and Shondaland have just confirmed which Bridgerton sibling will be leading series four of the hit period romance and – you, guessed it, Luke Thompson's Benedict is set to be our next hero.\n\nAnnouncing the news in a release, Netflix gave us a taster of what to expect from Bridgerton season four, saying: \"The fourth season of Bridgerton turns its focus to bohemian second son Benedict (Luke Thompson).\n\n\"Despite his elder and younger brothers both being happily married, Benedict is loath to settle down – until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother's masquerade ball.\"\n\nWe cannot wait for this...\n\nRelease date: 19 July on Apple TV\n\nNatalie Portman stars in this new drama series, based on the novel of the same name by Laura Lippman. Set in 1966, Portman plays Maddie Schwartz, who swaps life as a housewife to become an investigative reporter in downtown Baltimore.\n\nApple TV says: \"When the disappearance of a young girl grips the city of Baltimore on Thanksgiving 1966, the lives of two women converge on a fatal collision course. Maddie Schwartz (Natalie Portman) is a Jewish housewife seeking to shed a secret past and reinvent herself as an investigative journalist, and Cleo Sherwood (Moses Ingram) is a mother navigating the political underbelly of Black Baltimore while struggling to provide for her family. Their disparate lives seem parallel at first, but when Maddie becomes fixated on Cleo’s mystifying death, a chasm opens that puts everyone around them in danger. From visionary director Alma Har’el, Lady in the Lake emerges as a feverish noir thriller and an unexpected tale of the price women pay for their dreams.\"\n\nRelease date: Part 1: 15 August; Part 2: 12 September, Netflix\n\nThe first images from Emily in Paris season 4 have finally been shared by Netflix, and we can't wait for the series to drop later this summer...\n\nPart one of the long-awaited fourth season will be released on 15 August, so we don't have too long to wait – and once again the show is set to be perfect holiday binge-watching material.\n\nNetflix says: \"After the dramatic events of Camille and Gabriel’s misbegotten wedding, Emily is reeling: She has strong feelings for two men, but now Gabriel’s expecting a baby with his ex, and Alfie’s worst fears about her and Gabriel have been confirmed.\"At work, Sylvie is forced to confront a thorny dilemma from her past for the sake of her marriage, and the Agence Grateau team navigates personnel shakeups. Mindy and the band prepare for Eurovision, but when funds run dry, they’re forced to get thrifty.\"Emily and Gabriel’s chemistry is undeniable as they work together towards a Michelin star, but two big secrets threaten to undo everything they’ve dreamed of.\"\n\nRelease date: 5 September 2024 on Netflix\n\nOoh this one sounds like a good'un. Nicole Kidman takes the lead in this new six-part whodunnit with stateside Saltburn vibes that we can't wait to binge.\n\nWatch the trailer\n\nNetflix says: 'Amelia Sacks (Eve Hewson) is about to marry into one of the wealthiest families on Nantucket. Her disapproving future mother-in-law, famous novelist Greer Garrison Winbury (Kidman), has spared no expense in planning what promises to be the premiere wedding of the season — until a body turns up on the beach. As secrets come to light, the stage is set for a real-life investigation that feels plucked from the pages of one of Greer’s novels. Suddenly, everyone is a suspect.'\n\nRelease date: 30 April on Hulu, UK release date TBC\n\nThis six-part thriller from Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight arrived on Hulu in April, with a UK release date yet to be confirmed. It stars Elisabeth Moss who plays Imogen Salter, a veteran MI6 agent, alongside actress Yumna Marwan.\n\nFX says: \"The Veil is an international spy thriller that explores the surprising and fraught relationship between two women who play a deadly game of truth and lies on the road from Istanbul to Paris and London. One woman has a secret, the other a mission to reveal it before thousands of lives are lost. In the shadows, mission controllers at the CIA and French DGSE must put differences aside and work together to avert potential disaster.\"\n\nRelease date: TBC on Disney +\n\nJilly Cooper fans, rejoice because Disney + has just unveiled the debut teaser trailer for its highly anticipated adaptation of her iconic 'Rutshire Chronicles' novel, Rivals, as well as some more first look images of the cast.\n\nWATCH THE TRAILER\n\nThe eight-part series – starring David Tennant, Luke Pasqualino, Danny Dyer, Emily Atack, Poldark's Aidan Turner, and Alex Hassell (The Tragedy of Macbeth, The Boys) as notorious playboy politician and former Olympian Rupert Campbell-Black – promises to be everything you'd expect. It's \"packed full of romantic entanglements, dastardly deals, sex and wit\", according to Disney + and, no, we can't wait either.\n\n\"Set against the backdrop of the drama, excess, and shocking antics of the power-grabbing social elite of 1980s England, Rivals delves headfirst into the ruthless world of independent television in 1986,\" says the release.\n\nSign us up. And we might just have to in the meantime...\n\nRelease date: TBC on Netflix\n\nDescribed by Netflix as 'witty, epic and fast-paced...Agatha Christie for a whole new generation', we're very excited for new series The Seven Dials Mystery to hit the streaming service. Rising star Mia McKenna-Bruce leads the starry cast, playing determined young detective 'Bundle' alongside Helena Bonham Carter and Martin Freeman. But what's really piqued our interest is that it's penned by Chris Chibnall, who wrote hit ITV crime drama Broadchurch, which we loved.\n\nThe plot? Here's what Netflix has to say: 'England. 1925. At a lavish country house party, a practical joke appears to have gone horribly, murderously wrong. It will be up to the unlikeliest of sleuths – the fizzingly inquisitive Lady Eileen ‘Bundle’ Brent – to unravel a chilling plot that will change her life, cracking wide open the country house mystery.'\n\nFilming begins the summer...\n\nRelease date: TBC in 2025 on Amazon Prime Video\n\nExciting news for fans of '00s hit Legally Blonde.
