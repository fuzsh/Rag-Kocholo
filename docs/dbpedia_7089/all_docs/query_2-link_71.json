        "text": "10 years after the first film, the John Wick franchise seems to have no intention of stopping. Despite the results of the miniseries and prequel series ‘The Continental: The World of John Wick’, a series is already in the works to continue the story of the four films we saw in theaters.\n\nAccording to a report from Deadline, a new series inspired by the world of John Wick is currently in development at Lionsgate Television. No streaming service or network is attached to the project at this time, but details such as the title and logline have been revealed. For now, the series will be called ‘John Wick: Under the High Table’ and will take place immediately after the events of ‘John Wick: Chapter 4′, which will be released in 2023. As for the logline, it reads: “John Wick has left the world of the High Table in a tenuous position and a collection of new characters will look to make a name for themselves while some of the franchise stalwart characters remain committed to the old-world order. The series will combine new and old and thrust the Wick universe into a new age.”\n\nThe series will be executive produced by Keanu Reeves, Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee, along with Chad Stahelski, who will also direct the pilot. Robert Levine will serve as writer, showrunner and executive producer. Lionsgate Television will produce.\n\nThe John Wick universe continues to grow\n\nDespite the announcement of this new series, we still have John Wick for a while. The end of ‘John Wick 4′ took many by surprise, but it is even more surprising to learn that a fifth installment is in the works. On the other hand, and despite its delays, the spin-off film, ‘John Wick Presents: Ballerina’ with Ana de Armas, already has a release date and will be released in 2025."
