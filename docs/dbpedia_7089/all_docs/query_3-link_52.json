        "text": "Edit: After the Season 2 finale, I think I understand a lot better where Martin is coming from, and have written about it here.\n\nThere has been much speculation as to George R.R. Martin’s thoughts on House Of The Dragon’s second season, which has been strangely controversial in its last few episodes. I say “strangely” because the complaints I’ve seen are just so odd given what the show has been like up to this point.\n\nLots of criticism of the second half of the second season seems to revolve around its pacing. The show is too slow, many argue. Daemon has spent too much time at Harrenhal having visions. Alicent has been sidelined and now she’s just off camping rather than having any part in the main story. But it’s always been slow! This has never been a fast-paced series.\n\nMany complaints also revolve around changes from Martin’s book, Fire & Blood, though as even the author has pointed out in the past, changes were bound to happen for several reasons including but not limited to:\n\nThe fact that the book itself has multiple accounts of what truly happened during not just the Dance of Dragons but the entire first half of the Targaryen dynasty. That’s the entire gimmick of the book, which is related as though it were a history with multiple sources and a sense of unreliability rather than as a narrative like A Song of Ice and Fire.\n\nThe nature of the book is such that it moves from one event to the next at wildly different speeds, often leaping through sections of time to get to the good stuff, not including dialogue in the same way as Game Of Thrones and its sequels, etc. This means a lot of filling in the blanks is required, and many were filled in in Season 1 with its time-jumps while others were not, because of budget and time constraints—all things Martin has discussed on his blog.\n\nUnlike the first seasons of Game Of Thrones, which had fleshed out texts to draw from and did so at first with incredible fidelity, House of the Dragon has a full story with many missing details, dialogues, and a bunch of multiple-choice answers of what really happened. This gives the writers interesting wiggle room but also wiggle necessity (I think I’ve coined that just now) since they can’t just do a straight adaptation. They must wiggle the details one way or another!\n\nObviously, making these changes will sometimes not please fans or the author. It’s not an easy calculus. But Martin’s recent comments that seem to take issue with Season 2 are very peculiar and just vague enough to be unhelpful. Before we get to those, however, we’ll go back in time to 2022, when Martin gushed over the changes made to the first season of House of the Dragon, writing:\n\nHOUSE OF THE DRAGON has helped brighten my Sundays as well. I mean, I cannot really review the show, that would be crazy, I am hardly objective… but I do want to commend Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik and the cast and crew for the work they’ve done. Sunday’s episode, “Lord of the Tides,” was everything I hoped it should be. Kudos to Eileen Shim, the scriptwriter, to Geeta Patel, the director, to our incredible cast… and particularly to Paddy Considine, for his portrayal of King Viserys, the First of His Name. The character he created (with Ryan and Sara and Ti and the rest of our writers) for the show is so much more powerful and tragic and fully-fleshed than my own version in FIRE & BLOOD that I am half tempted to go back and rip up those chapters and rewrite the whole history of his reign. Paddy deserves an Emmy for this episode alone. If he doesn’t get one, hey, there’s no justice. Meanwhile, I am going to give Archmaester Gyldayn a smack for leaving out so much good stuff.\n\nThe bolded portions are my emphasis because they’re the most important. Martin rightly praises the performance of Paddy Considine as Viserys I and how much better and more interesting and more sympathetic (and perhaps how much less sympathetic in some ways, because the character is so complex) he is in the show. And then he mentions Archmaester Gyldayn, the historian who “wrote” Fire & Blood for “leaving out so much good stuff.”\n\nTo me, this is the central conceit that makes most of these changes work really well. I say ‘most’ because I also think some changes have been odd, but I won’t get into details for the sake of brevity.\n\nNow, more recently, Martin has taken to his blog to complain about adaptations in general and, more recently, to throw a bit of shade at House of the Dragon in particular. His first post I largely agree with and have written about it previously. But I’ve also written about how this show makes changes that actually work quite well and how it’s okay for book and show canon to differe. Here’s what he typed at the time:\n\nEverywhere you look, there are more screenwriters and producers eager to take great stories and “make them their own.” It does not seem to matter whether the source material was written by Stan Lee, Charles Dickens, Ian Fleming, Roald Dahl, Ursula K. Le Guin, J.R.R. Tolkien, Mark Twain, Raymond Chandler, Jane Austen, or… well, anyone. No matter how major a writer it is, no matter how great the book, there always seems to be someone on hand who thinks he can do better, eager to take the story and “improve” on it. “The book is the book, the film is the film,” they will tell you, as if they were saying something profound. Then they make the story their own.\n\nThey never make it better, though. Nine hundred ninety-nine times out of a thousand, they make it worse.\n\nAfter this, he talks about how great the Shogun adaptation was despite the changes from the book. At the time it never occurred to me that he was perhaps also speaking about House of the Dragon, since he’d been so positive about the show’s changes in the past. Now, after his latest post about dragons, I’m not so sure. That “or... well, anyone” sure sounds like “or...me.”\n\nHe does praise the fourth episode of Season 2 where he asks “Has there ever been a dragon battle to match it? . . . Our guys knocked this one out of the castle. I think they took it as a challenge. And the dragons…”\n\nAt which point he goes into a very lengthy discussion about dragons, about the different types in different fiction and history, about how the Targaryen crest used to be right on Game Of Thrones, showing only two feet for the three-headed dragon, but was somehow changed to a four-footed (though still three-headed) dragon. He teases more information about dragons and their riders coming in The Winds Of Winter and A Dream Of Spring and the second part of Blood & Fire, but mostly he talks about how dragons in his stories behave—hunting, living in lairs, sticking close to their territories in King’s Landing and Dragonstone and nowhere else.\n\nHe reasons that if dragons left these areas, they’d be all over Westeros, and wouldn’t have mostly all died in the Doom of Valyria. They don’t go anywhere else unless they have a rider except for under very special circumstances. Then he writes, “You won’t find dragons hunting the riverlands or the Reach or the Vale, or roaming the northlands or the mountains of Dorne.\n\n“Fantasy needs to be grounded. It is not simply a license to do anything you like. Smaug and Toothless may both be dragons, but they should never be confused. Ignore canon, and the world you’ve created comes apart like tissue paper.”\n\nWhile I fundamentally agree with fantasy needing to be grounded and have internal consistency, this feels like direct commentary on Season 2’s decision to have a wild dragon in the Vale, where it appears Rhaena will be taking the place of Nettles as Sheepstealer’s rider. Of course, this hasn’t been 100% confirmed, but scenes over the past couple episodes make it all but certain. It also seems likely that Rhaena will not go to Dragonstone to rejoin Rhaenyra, but to Harrenhal to join her father, Daemon, which would keep things closer to the book version since Nettles also joins Daemon.\n\nIf this is a dig at House of the Dragon, it’s an odd one. They are hardly “doing whatever they like” by having one wild dragon ranging further from Dragonstone than the others. As you can see in the map, Dragonstone is about the same distance from King’s Landing as it is the Eyrie, and the Eyrie is in the most mountainous terrain in Westeros—a terrain one could easily see being very suitable for Martin’s dragons.\n\nGiving Rhaena something to do that’s more interesting than her book role is also a pretty understandable reason, especially since the new season has already introduced Ulf the White, Hugh Hammer, Alyn and Addam of Hull, new Kingsguard knights, new council members and various other names and faces to keep track of. Martin ic certainly fond of adding more and more characters with each of his books, but as a reader or viewer it can become quite overwhelming, and sometimes adaptations understandably have to combine characters or move more quickly through certain storylines.\n\nIn all honesty, in HotD I think Ulf and Hugh could have been combined with no noticeable impact on the story whatsoever. Alyn and Addam of Hull could have been combined as well. I’m glad they weren’t, but the series creators would have been justified in slimming the cast down a bit to make things more manageable and to give each of those characters more focus—character development that would do them good in the show, but which they didn’t need as much in Fire & Blood. I’d say more but I don’t want to spoil it.\n\nIn a post of Martin’s back when he ran a Livejournal blog, he addressed some complaints around the latest episode of Game Of Thrones which, by that post’s date of May 18th, 2015, I presume has to do with Season 5, Episode 6 which is the first truly harrowing episode between Ramsay Bolton and Sansa Stark. I was not a fan of this change—Sansa was never taken to Winterfell to marry Roose in the books, and this was the first major departure in the TV show, and the exact moment that I’ve said marks the beginning of the show’s decline—but Martin was pretty unfazed by it at the time.\n\n“How many children did Scarlett O'Hara have? Three, in the novel. One, in the movie. None, in real life: she was a fictional character, she never existed. The show is the show, the books are the books; two different tellings of the same story,” he wrote at the time, noting also that there “has seldom been any TV series as faithful to its source material, by and large (if you doubt that, talk to the Harry Dresden fans, or readers of the Sookie Stackhouse novels, or the fans of the original WALKING DEAD comic books)... but the longer the show goes on, the bigger the butterflies become. And now we have reached the point where the beat of butterfly wings is stirring up storms, like the one presently engulfing my email.”\n\nSansa going to Winterfell and suffering at the hands of Ramsay is a much, much more massive change than having a dragon in the Vale, or Rhaena double-up as Nettles or combining a couple relatively minor characters like Ulf and Hugh. How many Dragonseeds are there? Four in the novel, three in the show. None, in real life: These are fictional characters that never existed. The show is the show, the books are the books.\n\nThat’s a little twist on what Martin said in 2015. In 2024, as I quoted above, he whistles a different tune:\n\n“The book is the book, the film is the film,” they will tell you, as if they were saying something profound. Then they make the story their own.\n\nThey never make it better, though. Nine hundred ninety-nine times out of a thousand, they make it worse.\n\nI understand that as Game of Thrones continued, changes were more damning, but of course Weiss and Benioff—for all their mistakes—were in the unenviable position of not having the final two books of the series to work with. I understand how this may have changed Martin’s mind and made him more sensitive to this issue in the intervening years.\n\nBut as far as I can tell, Ryan Condal, the showrunner of House Of The Dragon, and his team are doing a remarkably great job at restoring my faith in this world, something that I did not think possible after Season 8 of Game Of Thrones and the long, endless wait for The Winds Of Winter. It’s not a perfect show, but it’s smart and well-written and gorgeous to look at and listen to. And as a huge fan of Fire & Blood, I think they’re doing a terrific job even if I don’t agree with every single choice that’s been made up to this point.\n\nI do, however, agree with both of Martin’s seemingly contradictory statements. People in charge of adapting books or games or comics or whatever else into movies and TV shows should make every attempt to do so as faithfully to the source material as possible. But at the end of the day, that won’t always be possible for countless reasons and we as audiences need to remember that these are different mediums and judge them accordingly. Sometimes it really does come across as a cynical attempt to “make it their own” but I think a lot of the time it’s just the reality of the adaptation process, of budgets, of time-constraints, of the medium’s strengths and limitations, etc."
