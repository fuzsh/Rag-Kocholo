DeMille’s 1956 classic is a staple watch for many families.\n\nThe Wrap Report provides an exclusive first look at the most-watched movies and individual TV programs from the past week across both linear television and streaming from data analyzed from Samba TV’s panel of more than 3 million households drawn from over 25 million connected TVs balanced to the U.S. Census.\n\nBeyond the 67-year-old Charlton Heston epic, the latest episodes of “American Idol,” “The Voice,” and “Chicago Med” rounded out the top five, with “American Idol” claiming spots No."
