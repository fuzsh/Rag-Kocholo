        "text": "BELLEVUE, Oct. 13.—He’s not running for president – at least this time out. But Indiana governor Mitch Daniels, a rising star in Republican-Party circles, presented his credentials anyway Wednesday night at the annual dinner of the Washington Policy Center.\n\nWith a Midwest twang and a folksy speaking style, Daniels, 62, told how he has changed the direction of Indiana state government during his two terms in office, enacting conservative reforms that have earned him cheers from the right side of the spectrum and enmity from public-employee labor unions. School vouchers, elimination of collective-bargaining rules, merit pay for public employees – he’s been going down the conservative checklist. Widely talked about in the early stages of the 2012 Republican campaign, Daniels opted out of the running. But with a new book out, “A Republic if You Can Keep It,” you might say he seems to be laying the groundwork for something or other.\n\nWashington State Wire presents the full text of Daniels’ speech. You might notice he attributes one joke to Mark Twain directly. But sharp-eyed readers with a knowledge of the works of Sam Clemens might recognize another one in there, without attribution. It was one that brought the house down. We’ll let you spot it for yourselves.\n\nIn his remarks, Daniels described what he did in the Hoosier state, though he admitted a natural reticence to talk about it, because “telling people what you did in your state is like showing your home movies. They pretend to be interested, but they are really not.”\n\nHe proceeded to expand on this point for the next 25 minutes.\n\nDaniels began with a nod to Hoosier State expatriate William Ruckelshaus, who wound up in this Washington after a prominent career in the other one. Among other things, Ruckelshaus served as the first administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Daniels said Indiana would be glad to take Ruckelshaus back, as the state has a “liberal return policy.”\n\nThe New Red Menace\n\n“It was Bill Ruckelshaus, come to think of it, who first drew my attention to Mark Twain’s really excellent description of the perfect audience, which he described as informed, intelligent, inquisitive, and drunk.\n\n“There is an advantage to going last on a program like this. But in the event you haven’t quite reached the status of perfection, I take some comfort in Henry Kissinger’s observation—he said “the best thing about becoming better known is when you bore people they think it’s their fault.”\n\n” I will endeavor not to bore you here in the next few minutes.\n\n“I did write this book [Keeping the Republic]. We’re not going to spend much time on it tonight, but it has been interesting, because it has brought me in front of a slightly different category of audiences, more literary than some of those that I visit with in Loogootee or Osgood or places I hang out in my home state. I finished a talk in front of one such audience on the East Coast recently. This lovely sort of matron lady rushed up to the front, all effusive – ‘Oh, Gov. Daniels, I can’t tell you how much I enjoyed that. It was just superfluous.’ I said thanks, and she went on, ‘Will your remarks be published?’ I said ‘Oh, if so, probably posthumously.’\n\n“She said, “‘And I do hope that will be soon!’\n\n“At the suggestion of the host, I am not going too talk much about the book except maybe a little by indirection. Let me give you the fast-forward version with an accent on those themes that I hope to return to in a few minutes. The sum of this little work is to suggest the following—that we are facing—excuse me if it sounds hyperbolic, a survival-level issue in our country today, threatening our standard of living, threatening our leadership position in the world, threatening worst of all, I guess, part of the American project—the promise of upward mobility, the one that has drawn millions to our shores over time, the one that still today says that you can start with nothing here and make a great life for yourself.\n\n“The threat has many manifestations, but the single symptom on which they all converge is the debt levels which we have piled up for ourselves and we are inexorably adding to day by day. In what may be too cute a term I’ve called it “the red menace.”\n\nA Matter of Arithmetic\n\n“We faced down the original red menace, thanks to people like John Bolton, in the last half of the last century. The red ink which menaces us now, in some respects, is to me even more alarming. It is not more terrifying than the threat posed by Soviet nuclear power, but it is a lot more certain to happen. In fact, it is arithmetically certain to happen. A great citizen of our time, Erskine Bowles, he was the Democratic co-chairman of that debt commission which our president appointed and then ignored from that point on. He’s got a very useful phrase. He said that we have the most predictable crisis we have ever seen. And he’s right—just look at the mathematics of what’s coming.\n\nIt can’t be wished away, it can’t be negotiated away, it can’t be deterred. It is an arithmetic certainty. There’s a pile of scholarly data—I refer to it the book—far better people than I have already pointed out that when great nations fall, typically it starts with the money. And that there are quantifiable points of no return past which economies just won’t grow— mortgage payment is too high—and every other form of decline including military defeat flows from that.\n\nWell, I think that Bowles was exactly right, but it’s true in a larger sense, if you just look back on it. Just as I am not the best economist in the room I’m not the greatest historian either, but you don’t have to be to know that there is a long lineage of skepticism about the whole project of self-governance. It wasn’t very long after the first Greek coined the term “democracy” that somebody cynically said “well that won’t work for long.” Eventually politicians will learn they can—as we say these days—pander and they will promise what can’t be delivered and they will borrow money until at least their time of leadership in office has run out and hand the problem to the next guy, until it can’t be passed on anymore. We see this Europe today, John walked us through that in his typical brilliant insight.\n\n“This problem, I always want to point out to people, is not ideological, it’s arithmetic. I say to folks at home all the time, “Let’s have the philosophical debate tomorrow. For tonight, can we just agree here that the math does not work?” No enterprise, large or small, public or private can thrive or even survive intact, with the debt levels that we have piled up and are right here in front of us.\n\nWill Require Consensus\n\n“Denial is a very human impulse, among the most basic of them. We have been practicing it. We don’t have much more time for that luxury. The kind of big changes that will be necessary to head this off and restore the promise of this country and to restore the economic vitality which undergirds our most necessary leadership in the world will require big majorities. This takes us in a couple of directions. One is that we really ought to stop arguing about lesser things for a little while.\n\n“We all have passionate views about a host of other questions, not to diminish their importance. I do too, for that matter, but I sometimes have pointed out that if a foreign army showed up at the Canadian border tonight, everyone in this room and most people I know anywhere in this country would stop fighting about other things and say, “what can I do until this is taken care of?” I also think it says that whenever possible, our national leadership should try to speak the language of unity. The first president I worked for preached the 11th commandment— speak no ill of another Republican. These days we may need a 12th—speak no ill of another American. We are in this together.\n\n“We have obviously very heartfelt disagreements about so many things probably even about the way to solve this problem. But we can’t bail from one side to the boat of the other. And if we don’t address it, as is too often the case, it is the young and the poor who will suffer the most. But all of us would suffer. None of us will like the consequence.\n\nEconomic Growth Should be Goal\n\n“The book ends in a very optimistic way. I refuse to be fatalistic about it. I am a Presbyterian. Supposedly that is our bent. You know, one of my preachers used to say a Presbyterian is someone who falls down a flight of stairs and says, boy I’m glad that I got that over with. [Laughter] We’ve never had that attitude in America and we can’t have it now. These problems can be dealt with. It will take a complete commitment to economic growth of the private sector. We’ll have to persuade our fellow citizens, most especially those who believe sincerely in a bigger and more involved and expansive and expensive government that nobody has a bigger stake than they do in a private sector that grows. We better start calling all the close ones and breaking every tie in favor liberating and encouraging the growth of the private sector, not the government, which has been the policy of this administration.\n\n“Well, the rest of it, you can read it if you so please. But I do think there are a couple of other questions that we’re going to have to address as we grapple with the all the policies. I think something bigger is involved here, if you can imagine such a thing, than GDP and net income and trade policy and tax reform and energy. All of these things are going to have to be part of the solution. But really we are going to need to be talking about a couple of questions that are somewhat more fundamental. Who is in charge here? Which sector of society ought to be preeminent?\n\n“Some of us were raised to believe that public service is that which men and women of good purpose and good will do—when they have the chance—to promote the flourishing, the success and growth of the important realms of life—the private realms of life—where freedom is exercised in enterprise and in voluntary associations, and in all of the great nonprofit activities for which America is uniquely known. But there’s another view that believes that this doesn’t produce sufficient justice, or that the world is just too complicated now and that we need our enlightened benevolent betters to make these decisions for most Americans.\n\nFreedom is Eroded\n\n“This then leads then to the corollary question, what kind of people will we choose to be in this country? What kind of people are we? I’ve got farmers at home about be regulated because they might—get this—create dust. What gave them the idea they could do that? Pretty soon we’ll be told, lest we make a truly fatal mistake, what kind of light bulbs we can buy. The current secretary of energy has to defend that policy. He said “were going to have to take away the right of people to waste their money.”\n\n“You know, it is easy to become desensitized. It’s not like this a new phenomenon, the shrinkage, really, of the zone of personal sovereignty that has been going on for quite a long time. It’s boiling the frog, as they say. We have four girls. I always say that when the first one caught a cold we rushed to the doctor. When the fourth one swallowed a quarter we took it out of her allowance. You just get used to things you shouldn’t. So I think we’re going to have to confront the question as a people, and ask ourselves, will we be creatures of dignity or objects of therapy?\n\n“And when people sense that we are headed, and it has been said more than once tonight and it is so true, that we are headed for a real moment of national decision. I think all these things are part of it, and it must lead wiser public policy decisions. But we really have got a societal issues to settle and I will tell you at the end why I’m betting on us.\n\nHome Movies From a Hoosier\n\n“Now I’m going to talk to talk a little about my home state because I was asked to do it. I am usually pretty bashful about this. I don’t prescribe that what worked in our corner of America is right for you or any other state. Plus, I am always reticent—I always say telling people what you did in your state is like showing your home movies. They pretend to be interested, but they are really not.\n\n“So this will not be a laundry list. I just want to talk a little bit—really in some reference to the questions I just surfaced about how we try to approach our stewardship in Indiana. And the reason I feel a little bit more comfortable doing that tonight is because I sense that you may have this opportunity very soon here in your state and I hope you do.\n\n“We think of government as the enabler as I said before. In the interval between my election and the inauguration I had a meeting in a hotel, sort of like this one, with the first 80 or 90 people who had agreed to be our part of our administration. Not one of them had ever been in state government. We had been in the wilderness a long time. And I said, look, every great business I was ever around or saw had a very clear purpose. They knew what they were there for. Everybody in the operation could tell you what it was. It was on the wall, it was in annual report if there was one, or it was on a laminated ID card. It was their ‘mission’ or whatever they wanted to call it, but anyway it was what they were in business for, and I said okay here’s ours.\n\nMade Economy Top Priority\n\n“We are here to raise the net disposable income of Hoosiers. That’s what we are here for. It has been sinking for 50 years. If we could ever turn that tanker, first of all we will have improved the quality of life. We will have given people more freedom in this state and the business of government will get easier. All of our problems will become more manageable. There will be natural revenue to do those things we want to do together.\n\n“I said look, wherever you are working, we don’t care where it is—we are going to be asking you, starting today, let’s identify what you can do better or do faster or maybe quit doing, to make it more likely that the next job comes in Indiana, not Washington, not Illinois or anywhere else. And when that job comes, those jobs pay on average more than the jobs we are doing today. And then we are going to try to run the people’s business here the best way we know how, the best way we can, so as to leave more of those dollars, that’s the disposable part, in the pockets of the people who earn it.\n\n“That’s it. Everything’s got to point to that. That’s what we’ve been doing for 7 years, from my first day in office. I went eventually got to all the departments that mattered, but I went to our environmental management department, our EPA, so to speak, and it was a big room. It was like this. They couldn’t fit in one room, so there were a bunch of them, and we had speaker phones all over the state—a huge crowd. There’s not quite so many now.\n\nMoving at the Speed of Business\n\n“But this is what I told them. This is the same thing, by the way, that I told our other regulatory agencies. I told them what I just told you, what we are here for, and I said, now listen. I don’t know what you may imagine, but let me just tell you. But we do not intend to soften, moderate, relax or weaken any environmental standard that I know of. And we have not done that in seven years—some have been tightened. However, in the implementation of those regulations, let me tell you what I’m going to expect. One is consistency and predictability. I’ve run into far too many people who had been told one thing by inspector A and something different by inspector B. We want to get rid of that.\n\n“The second thing—quickness. Time is money is not a figure of speech. To everybody that works for us—who have heard it until they’re sick of it—I always say we will move at the speed of business, not the speed of government.\n\n“And I said, lastly, we want you to be collaborative, not punitive. I said these folks that you are regulating are not the enemy. They’re your neighbors and their success is a good thing. For all the reasons that I mentioned a minute ago. And I said so, we want you to go and tell them what they need to do to get in compliance with whatever you’re enforcing, and 99-point-X percent of them are going to do that. Your job is not to lurk around in the bushes looking and waiting for them to mess up and jump out and whack them.\n\n“And I said that tiny minority that color outside the lines, well, throw the book at them. But you know we are going to measure how long it takes to get a permit out of your department and everywhere else, and we’re going to make that a lot shorter in a few years. And it is.\n\nNow Go Make Money\n\n“So you know, we try to remind the folks who serve the public—I always refer to the citizens of Indiana as ‘my employers’—of one of the basic truisms of life. No profits, no jobs. Somebody better make a profit or nobody goes to work. People come see me all the time, businesses, or collections of businesses, and you know they tell you what’s on their mind. Almost invariably—because this is the way people are in my state, I’m sure they’re no different here—on the way out of the door they will say, “now what can we do for Indiana?” Is there something we can do on our end? And I always say the same thing.\n\n“Make money. I want you to go make money. I want you to be good at what you do. If you make money, you’re eventually going to hire somebody else, create some opportunities for somebody in the state where they need it. And if you make some money you will be more able to support all those wonderful nonprofits we’re so proud of.\n\n“Now, I want to make one other point that I think gets missed often, even in wonderful crowds like this. We believe in our state that government, yes, should be limited, but it should be active. Limited does not mean inert. We believe in limited. I play this game—I go to schools all the time. I go to high schools and sometimes college campuses, and I will say who has got a five-dollar bill? And some kid will produce one, and I will say thank you and stick it in my pocket and keep walking and talking until the giggling starts and I will say oh, you were wondering about that five?\n\n“I will say, a minute ago when John had that five, please notice, he is now five dollars less free than he was. Because a minute ago he could decide what to do with it, but he doesn’t have it anymore. Now I’m going to decide. And that’s okay if we use it for the right reasons. But in a nation committed to protecting the freedom of citizens, we believe you should never take a dollar from a free citizen without a very necessary purpose. By the way, I give the five back. When I think of it.\n\nIntroduced Performance Measures\n\n“But some folks stop there, and I would just urge you to remember that there is an equally solemn duty, and that is for those many very necessary purposes for which we must have collective action, there is an equally important duty to spend that dollar as well and as effectively and wisely as you can. Some people don’t pay enough attention to that, but we do.\n\n“Government, remember, is the last monopoly. There is a reason why we as Americans don’t allow that very often, because monopolies overcharge and under serve their customers. There’s no competition to force them to do otherwise. So we in government one has to implant or transplant accountability. We do it every way we can.\n\n“We pay everyone in Indiana state government on a performance basis and on a bell curve. We have metrics for everything. There’s an old saying we used in business, ‘if you’re not keeping score, you’re just practicing.’\n\n“We introduced external competition, and I always say if you can find it in the Yellow Pages, maybe government shouldn’t be doing it itself. Maybe there’s somebody out there who’s doing every day that could do it better. And we have worked hard to build a culture of performance across Indiana state government, including a culture of economy. There is nothing more sure to get you a spot bonus for a big bonus, or an annual celebration we have, or a raise at the right end of that bell curve, than a year in which you and the group you work for found a way to stretch tax dollars.\n\n“First we came out of bankruptcy. Then came the recession and we came through that in the black with money in the bank. We never raised taxes. People looked at us as though it was some great mystery—it’s not, it’s really not that complicated. On Monday night football years ago they were discussing Bill Walsh, of the 49ers, the Hall of Fame coach, and somebody talked about him being a genius. So Joe Theismann says boy, there are no geniuses in football. A genius is someone like Norman Einstein.\n\n“Most of what we did did not take a genius. But I just want to tell you that even if you had a genius, or a bunch of them, at the top of the government I hope you’ll be building here in a year-and-a-half, there is nothing that will work better than getting the entire administration headed in one direction, whether that direction is raising the net income of your citizens or in this case, internally, constantly finding a better way to spend those dollars.\n\nPublic-Sector Unions Too Powerful\n\n“I want to say a word about collective bargaining, an important topic in so many ways. It is at the heart of this issue of who is in charge. We’ve got a great inversion in this country that has happened in the last few decades. It was once the case that public employees were badly mistreated a half-century ago. We had a lot of civil service reforms—good ideas—to protect them against patronage, protect them against being fired for political reasons, protect them against being underpaid and mistreated. We fixed that problem big-time. And it is now more and more plain that in place after place, strangely, public employees are paid a whole lot more than private sector taxpayers who are paying their salaries, with benefits are dramatically higher, and an almost solid tenure, almost perfect job protection. There are some real fairness questions involved there.\n\n“On the first day in office, I struck down the collective bargaining agreement, 160 pages of it that had existed in Indiana state government. I want to make a point about this, though. The reason I bring it up—yes, it helped us save money. Hundreds of millions of dollars, no question. We were able to undertake reforms such as competitive sourcing that I mentioned. It would have been impossible, otherwise. We were able to close facilities that weren’t needed anymore, and do just a lot of these just obvious business decisions that we would not have been able to make under those 160 pages. When they were in place we couldn’t move John’s book from that side to that side without a protracted negotiation. Just to give you an example, the performance pay that we put in place never would have happened.\n\n“But right after I signed that first executive order, I signed another one, addressing two of the many incredibly urgent problems that were facing our state at that time. We had the worst record in America for protecting children against abuse or neglect. The worst. And we were about the worst in America in collecting child support for single parents. Now we have really the best income-support program that I know. Almost every dollar that we collect goes straight to a family where it is really needed. On that first day I carved out of this monstrous, ineffective bureaucracy where those functions sat, a new department which is winning national awards in those two areas.\n\n“I couldn’t have done that. We would still be negotiating it seven years later. So the point that I want to make to you is that yes, there are unfairnessness. There was a reason FDR, George Meany and Fiorello LaGuardia and other champions of the labor movement thought it had no place—at all—in government. And now of course, more union members work for government than work in the whole private sector put together.\n\nThe Poor Dears\n\n“I would just urge you to think about these things in terms of delivering effective service to citizens who need it. Yes, government should be limited, but government should be excellent, and there are so many people who have all the right instincts who I think, however, make the mistake, as I see it, of letting skepticism about big government become contempt for all government, or sound like that to our fellow citizens. I don’t think that really expresses our view of how our society should operate, and I don’t think it is the most appealing way to speak of our fellow citizens.\n\n“Let me just finish by saying trust runs both ways. I didn’t have any trouble figuring out what to call the book, because I just pirated Ben Franklin’s line, you know, “a republic if you can keep it.” Right outside Independence Hall, the ink was not dry on the Constitution, and already Ben Franklin was expressing, as all the founding fathers did, their grave concern that this beautiful new experiment in freedom would be fragile and we might not keep it. It would be hard, and there were those who would have predicted the corner that we are in. They could have seen it coming. They might have been surprised it didn’t come sooner.\n\n“But you know, both sides of our national debate, I think, could stand to strengthen their confidence in the American people, or least make that their operating assumption. Those in power in Washington today adhere to a tradition of beliefs, and I will give them credit for their benevolence and sincerity, I think. That basically says the American people just can’t cut it, the poor dears. They’re just too gullible, too incompetent. Life’s just too complicated, they need us to make the big decisions for them, lest they pick the wrong healthcare, lest they send their child to the wrong school or pick the wrong light bulb.\n\n“On the other side, however, there is also, I think, a regrettable and unfortunate tendency for folks who believe in free institutions and in limited government, to say, well, you know our fellow citizens, they are hopeless dependents and they’re just too far gone. And that is not a formula for successful change in this country.\n\nEnabling Personal Choice\n\n“You know, back in Indiana one last time. When we set up a program for the low-income uninsured, and it is the same program in which now over 90 percent of Hoosier state employees are involved. They are in personal health savings accounts, the biggest such concentration in America. By the way, it’s an interesting little beta site because it doesn’t exist anywhere else in public sector America. The average penetration of consumerist healthcare plans is public sector America is two [percent]. Unions don’t like them. In Indiana it is 90 [percent] of the state employees and 100 [percent] of our low-income uninsured program, and we have several years of data. And guess what?\n\n“Just because somebody is low income—our state employees are hardly overpaid, either—doesn’t mean they don’t make wise choices for themselves. They ask for generic drugs at a much higher rate. They visit emergency rooms much less often. They ask for second opinions if they have an expensive procedure recommended. They shop. Why? It’s their money. That account is theirs. “We believe when we act together collectively, to do something support and help our fellow citizens, we should always look into it in a way that affirms the dignity, affirms their autonomy, and takes as its assumption that they are and should be creatures of dignity, making their own decisions wherever possible. We just passed the nation’s first universal school voucher program this spring. It is first and foremost about improving educational quality, about adding and implanting some accountability that is competition for the public schools.\n\n“But the basis of what it’s about is saying is that we trust citizens. There’s no reason that a low income single mom should be denied the same choice that her wealthier neighbor has who can move to a different school district or pay tuition at private school. That choice is now available to every Hoosier, to direct the dollars we will spend on them. [Applause] I am already meeting these parents and you would not believe the commitment they have to their kids, and how emotional they are that they have been able to free their child to go to a place that they believe is best.\n\n“We trust them to know—more often than not—which place is right. So let me just say to you that the jury’s out.\n\nDemocracy is Healthy\n\n“I am not blind. I read polls, too. I am not naïve to these things. The skeptics of history have said that free societies would run aground with the same problems that we are struggling with right now. Spending themselves broke, and the qualities and character traits that gave rise to liberty in the first place would weaken and wither and atrophy away. We’ve got these people with us right now—writing best-selling books, like Mr. Friedman at the New York Times, writing why can’t we be more like China? Just a little bit, you know. The guy who had the job I once had says, you know, we just have too much democracy. Somebody the other day said “why don’t we just suspend the election?”\n\n“Sure, there is an element of faith in suggesting that if we level with the American people about the arithmetic, just the facts of where we are, if we level with the American people about the kind of changes that will grow this economy, that will reform our so-called entitlement programs so they really serve those who would be destitute without them and stop sending checks to Mr. Gates, that they can rally to a program of big and bold reform that is in the interest of us all.\n\n“You know, I am going to leave Washington State with more faith than I came in with because I heard the story of [Initiative] 1098 tonight. I mean here is a situation in which you turned the polls and surveys upside down, as I heard the account, on an issue that was all demagoguery, and had all the buzzwords all loaded up against you. The people listened, took in facts. They changed their minds or came to a new point of view.\n\n“We have seen it over and over again in my state. Bill Ruckelshaus will tell you we have not been known as a state of change, quite honestly, just the opposite. But in the last seven years we have had one big one after another. And you know, we never took a poll to find out what to be for or what to be against.\n\n“And it has left me with the conviction that if spoken to honestly, as men and women born to freedom, Americans still in a large majority can unify themselves and go make a better world, put the interests of their children ahead of their own, the future ahead of today and support the kind of big changes in direction to preserve this as the great beacon of liberty and hope that it has always been. I just always say to audiences like this: I can’t prove it to you, but we better go find out.\n\n“If people like us don’t believe in the American people, well then, who will? I do. I am pretty sure you do too. Thank you.”"
