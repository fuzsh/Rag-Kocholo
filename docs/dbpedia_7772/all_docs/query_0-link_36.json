        "text": "Another year, another promise of an extended Purdue University tuition freeze.\n\n“Is that news?” Jake Thompson, a sophomore engineering student from Fort Wayne, asked Monday afternoon, while he dodged raindrops in the gap between Stewart Center and the Purdue Memorial Union.\n\nIt was a dog-bites-man shrug heard across campus, greeting word that tuition would be the same when Thompson graduates in 2019 – “Four years, crossing my fingers,” he said – as it was when he arrived on the West Lafayette campus a year and a half ago.\n\nPurdue President Mitch Daniels had guaranteed as much a short time earlier, telling faculty Monday afternoon that the university’s tuition freeze would continue into a sixth year, through the 2018-19 academic year.\n\nIs that news?\n\nThat’s how things stand at Purdue, a campus where today’s undergrads are working under a new assumption that holding the line on tuition is just the way things work – in much the same way previous generations of students simply expected the opposite. Both ends of that generation gap never didn’t know any other way.\n\nNot that it’s unappreciated.\n\n“Just kidding, really, about the news thing,” Thompson said. “That’s huge. I love it. One more reason: Boiler up.”\n\nDaniels rolled out the sixth and latest tuition freeze this week, saying it was timed for a critical time when high school seniors would be weighing their college choices for the fall. The news dropped fairly quietly at the start of the faculty’s monthly University Senate meeting.\n\nSenate members two months earlier had grilled Purdue Treasurer Bill Sullivan about the university’s budget and what a perpetual tuition freeze might mean in the long run for campus. (During that meeting, in January, Sullivan at times looked as if he had heartburn as he talked about how long a tuition freeze and the bottom line could co-exist.) On Monday, given the opportunity to ask Daniels questions, no hands went up.\n\n“A little surprised,” said David Sanders, a biology professor and University Senate chairman. “But it has become so routine and impervious to questioning that people have accepted it.”\n\nAgain, is that news?\n\nIt’s worth going back, then, to a time when the idea alone was real news – and seen as a real risk.\n\nDaniels arrived on campus in January 2013, the afternoon Mike Pence, his successor at the Statehouse, was sworn in as governor. Daniels immediately made noise about the price of admission. By way of introduction the two-term governor barely needed, Daniels wrote to students, faculty, staff and alumni: “Purdue has a chance to set itself apart as a counterexample to much of the criticism lodged against higher ed in general.”\n\nThis was the context: Purdue tuition had swelled 77 percent in the decade ahead of Daniels’ arrival. (Pushed back an extra year, when a $1,000 surcharge was added to the bill of every incoming student who followed, the increase was 138 percent – more than doubling from 2001-02 to 2012-13.)\n\nWhat’s more, Purdue had actually breezed through the most recent Statehouse budget hearings because lawmakers looking to rake callous colleges over the coals over in-state fees figured Purdue had made a good faith effort with increases of 3.5 percent – plus an extra, student-approved 1 percent for recreation center renovations – for 2011-12 and 2012-13. The state’s Commission for Higher Education was pleading with schools to keep increases to the rate of inflation – 1.7 percent in 2012 – for the next two years.\n\nThe headline on a column I wrote in those first weeks of his administration: “What kind of hero would Daniels be if Purdue held the line on tuition?”\n\nDaniels waited until March of that year to make news: No tuition increase for 2013-14. “The pause button,” he called it. Daniels treated it as low-hanging fruit that first year. And then again a second. By the third, fourth and fifth, he was giving some version on rationale he gave Monday when he rolled out the promise of a sixth.\n\n“The view of the board is, if you’re balancing the budget,” Daniels said, “why would you raise prices on your students?”\n\nDid he think six years of this could happen when he made his way up Interstate 65, from the Statehouse to Hovde Hall, in 2013?\n\n“I knew little to nothing about this when I got here,” said Daniels, who has turned a tuition freeze into a key component of his Purdue business plan aimed at enrollment growth and “creating separation” between Purdue and other schools.\n\n“We know that Purdue is seen as a place that really cares about keeping costs down – a place where you’re less likely to be surprised by increases in your sophomore, junior, senior year. It’s helped us attract great students, but also more of them,” Daniels said. “Just walk around, like I do, and talk to students. It comes up over and over and over again.”\n\nCases in point:\n\nAaron McGowan, a freshman from Rensselaer, said cost wasn’t his main reason to come to Purdue. He came for the engineering program and because his dad had gone to Purdue.\n\n“Even though the cost of tuition did not impact my decision greatly, it is awesome to hear the news because it shows that Mitch Daniels has the students’ best interest in mind,” McGowan said.\n\nHayden Hubbard, a senior at Cathedral High School in Indianapolis, will start at Purdue in August.\n\n“While deciding on which college to go to, I noticed Purdue was the only one that actually had frozen their tuition,” Hubbard said. “It isn't the total reason I chose Purdue, but definitely is a major factor.”\n\nRun the numbers, and we’re talking real money. Use 4 percent each year – the smallest increase Purdue had in the previous 10 years – and in-state tuition would have been up $1,698 a year over Purdue’s $10,002 tuition. By 2018-19, the increase would have grown to $2,653.\n\nA 2019 in-state graduate will save $1,837 over four years, based on that 4 percent increase scenario. Granted, that will only get you something in the range of two month’s rent in one of the newer apartment complexes going up near campus. And granted, tuition over those four years still runs more than $40,000 before books, meals, a few trips to Harry’s Chocolate Shop and the rest are factored in.\n\n“Let’s face it, this is still not an inexpensive proposition,” Daniels said. “But we certainly have separated from others in higher ed.”\n\nThe faculty questions lobbed at Sullivan linger about the tuition freeze and whether it’s the right way to go. Sanders said the budget squeeze that comes with it equates to lower staff morale and less ability to get work done. He continues to raise questions about deferred maintenance with trustees. And he said as colleges and departments find themselves under increased stress to find savings, “this pressure has impacted collegiality and mission completion.” He said budget shortfalls are “being used as excuses for curricular changes that diminish the value of a Purdue education.”\n\nDaniels stood his ground.\n\nThe next question is one he gets every time he pushes Purdue’s tuition freeze one more year: How long can it last? His current contract runs through the 2019-20 academic year. One more year of the freeze and he’ll make it a perfect 0 for 7 on tuition increases.\n\n“I don’t know, I don’t know,” Daniels said. “The touchstone is, can we balance the budget with a little to spare? That projects to happen over the next years, so …”\n\nThat would be more than news. It would be, for better or for worse, a legacy tough to duplicate."
