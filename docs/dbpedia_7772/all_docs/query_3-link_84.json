        "text": "Since 1927, Time magazine has named a Person of the Year, a living symbol of the year that was.\n\nThe title is not necessarily considered an honor or award; instead, Time describes its picks in terms of influence and importance.\n\nHere's every Person of the Year for the past quarter of a century ... and counting.\n\nBill Clinton (1992)\n\n\"History may eventually decide that the key to Clinton's accomplishment lay in his temperament ... in his enthusiasm for people and curiosity about their lives,\" Time said of the then-president-elect.\n\nThe Peacemakers (1993)\n\nTwo pairs of men shared the title in 1993 under the label \"The Peacemakers.\"\n\nF. W. de Klerk, as the president of South Africa, worked to secure Nelson Mandela's release from prison. The two worked together to end the system of racial apartheid in South Africa.\n\nPalestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime MinisterYitzhak Rabin signed the Oslo Accord, the first face-to-face agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nPope John Paul II (1994)\n\nThe first non-Italian pope in nearly 500 years, John Paul II was known for his modernization of the papacy and his extensive foreign reach.\n\n\"His power rests in the word, not the sword,\" Time said in 1994.\n\nNewt Gingrich (1995)\n\nCiting his role in ending 40 years of Democratic Party domination in the House, Time named Newt Gingrich Man of the Year in 1995.\n\n\"Gingrich has changed the center of gravity,\" Time said.\n\nDavid Ho (1996)\n\nAIDS researcher David Ho made huge contributions to understanding and treating HIV.\n\n\"He's kind of a genius, you know,\" his mother told Time. \"I'm not supposed to say that, but it's true.\"\n\nAndrew Grove (1997)\n\nIntel co-founder Andrew Grove changed the way tech affects everyday Americans through his extensive work with semiconductors.\n\nTime called Grove \"the person most responsible for the amazing growth in the power and innovative potential of microchips.\"\n\nBill Clinton and Ken Starr (1998)\n\nBill Clinton was once again named Time's Person of the Year in 1998, but this time, he shared the billing with Ken Starr, the special counsel investigating him for perjury during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.\n\nStarr's investigation led to impeachment proceedings against Clinton.\n\n\"For rewriting the book on crime and punishment, for putting prices on values we didn't want to rank, for fighting past all reason a battle whose casualties will be counted for years to come, Bill Clinton and Kenneth Starr are Time's 1998 Men of the Year,\" Time said.\n\nJeff Bezos (1999)\n\nAmazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos \"is a person who not only changed the way we do things but helped pave the way for the future,\" Time said.\n\nGeorge W. Bush (2000)\n\nGeorge W. Bush was named Time's Person of the Year after the closest presidential election in the nation's history.\n\n\"Bush campaigned for a year against partisan politics and that was before partisanship became so poisonous that it polluted every institution of government. The man who talked less about what he would do than how he would do it finds that his bet has been called,\" Time said.\n\nRudy Giuliani (2001)\n\nRudy Giuliani was the mayor of New York during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\n\"When the day of infamy came, Giuliani seized it as if he had been waiting for it all his life, taking on half a dozen critical roles and performing each masterfully,\" Time said.\n\nThe Whistleblowers (2002)\n\nColeen Rowley, Cynthia Cooper and Sherron Watkins were singled out by Time \"for believing — really believing — that the truth is one thing that must not be moved off the books, and for stepping in to make sure that it wasn't.\"\n\nRowley called out the FBI for ignoring early signs of a plan to attack the United States on 9/11. Auditor Cooper dug up $3.8 billion in accounting irregularities at Worldcom, forcing the company into bankruptcy. And Watkins warned her bosses at Enron that the company was in danger of collapse, which it did.\n\nThe American Soldier (2003)\n\nTime's decision came nine months into the Iraq War in 2003.\n\n\"For uncommon skills and service, for the choices each one of them has made and the ones still ahead, for the challenge of defending not only our freedoms but those barely stirring half a world away, the American soldier is Time's Person of the Year,\" the article said.\n\nGeorge W. Bush (2004)\n\nGeorge W.

No wonder his eyes look tired.\"\n\nMark Zuckerberg (2010)\n\n\"In less than seven years,\" Time said of the Facebook founder, \"Zuckerberg wired together a twelfth of humanity into a single network, thereby creating a social entity almost twice as large as the U.S.\n\n\"We have entered the Facebook age, and Mark Zuckerberg is the man who brought us here.\"\n\nThe Protester (2011)\n\nThe Arab Spring and the Occupy movement jointly inspired Time's decision in 2011.\n\n\"In 2011, protesters didn't just voice their complaints; they changed the world,\" said the Time article.\n\nBarack Obama (2012)\n\nAfter defeating Mitt Romney to win his second term as president, Obama once again found himself named Person of the Year.\n\n\"He will take the oath on Jan. 20 as the first Democrat in more than 75 years to get a majority of the popular vote twice.

All are journalists who were violently attacked or slapped with criminal charges in an apparent effort to silence the free press worldwide.\n\nThe magazine produced different cover images. One features Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed at the Saudi consulate in Turkey. An alternate cover features the wives of Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo holding their pictures; the journalists have been imprisoned since December 2017 in Myanmar after reporting on a massacre of Rohingya Muslims.\n\nOthers singled out by the magazine are Maria Ressa — a journalist and CEO of a news site in the Philippines — and the staff of the Capital Gazette newspaper in Maryland, where five journalists were killed in a mass shooting in June.\n\nJoe Biden and Kamala Harris (2020)\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala became the first running mates to be chosen together as Time's Person of the Year.\n\nTime editor-in-chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal writes that they were selected for their roles in \"changing the American story, for showing that the forces of empathy are greater than the furies of division, for sharing a vision of healing in a grieving world.\"\n\nElon Musk (2021)\n\nFor 2021, Time chose Elon Musk, the founder and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla — and lately the richest person in the world.\n\n\"Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too,\" editor-in-chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal wrote, explaining the choice.\n\nTime also honored vaccine scientists as 2021's \"Heroes of the Year.\"\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy (2022)\n\nTime chose Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and \"The Spirit of Ukraine\" as Person of the Year for 2022, as the nation fought back against Russia's invasion.\n\n\"Zelensky's success as a wartime leader has relied on the fact that courage is contagious,\" the magazine wrote.\n\nTaylor Swift (2023)\n\nTaylor Swift capped off a record-breaking 2023 by being named Time's Person of the Year.\n\n\"Every year contains light and dark; 2023 was a year with significant shares of darkness,\" the magazine wrote. \"In a divided world, where too many institutions are failing, Taylor Swift found a way to transcend borders and be a source of light. No one else on the planet today can move so many people so well.\"\n\nSwift earned the title after a year of big achievements. The pop star's \"Eras Tour\" became a cornerstone of the summer's pop cultural zeitgeist, with the Federal Reserve even saying at one point that the concert boosted tourism and travel to such an extent that it likely helped to revitalize the economy. Her concert film shattered box office records, she achieved billionaire status, and she was Spotify's most-streamed artist of the year."
