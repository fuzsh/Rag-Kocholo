Although payment of principal or interest shall not be required under a reverse mortgage until the entire loan becomes due and payable, interest may accrue and be compounded during the term of the loan as provided by the reverse mortgage loan agreement.\n\n(n) A reverse mortgage that is secured by a valid lien against homestead property may be made or acquired without regard to the following provisions of any other law of this state:\n\n(1) a limitation on the purpose and use of future advances or other mortgage proceeds;\n\n(2) a limitation on future advances to a term of years or a limitation on the term of open-end account advances;\n\n(3) a limitation on the term during which future advances take priority over intervening advances;\n\n(4) a requirement that a maximum loan amount be stated in the reverse mortgage loan documents;\n\n(5) a prohibition on balloon payments;\n\n(6) a prohibition on compound interest and interest on interest;\n\n(7) a prohibition on contracting for, charging, or receiving any rate of interest authorized by any law of this state authorizing a lender to contract for a rate of interest; and\n\n(8) a requirement that a percentage of the reverse mortgage proceeds be advanced before the assignment of the reverse mortgage.\n\n(o) For the purposes of determining eligibility under any statute relating to payments, allowances, benefits, or services provided on a means-tested basis by this state, including supplemental security income, low-income energy assistance, property tax relief, medical assistance, and general assistance:\n\n(1) reverse mortgage loan advances made to a borrower are considered proceeds from a loan and not income; and\n\n(2) undisbursed funds under a reverse mortgage loan are considered equity in a borrower's home and not proceeds from a loan.\n\n(p) The advances made on a reverse mortgage loan under which more than one advance is made must be made according to the terms established by the loan documents by one or more of the following methods:\n\n(1) an initial advance at any time and future advances at regular intervals;\n\n(2) an initial advance at any time and future advances at regular intervals in which the amounts advanced may be reduced, for one or more advances, at the request of the borrower;\n\n(3) an initial advance at any time and future advances at times and in amounts requested by the borrower until the credit limit established by the loan documents is reached;\n\n(4) an initial advance at any time, future advances at times and in amounts requested by the borrower until the credit limit established by the loan documents is reached, and subsequent advances at times and in amounts requested by the borrower according to the terms established by the loan documents to the extent that the outstanding balance is repaid; or\n\n(5) at any time by the lender, on behalf of the borrower, if the borrower fails to timely pay any of the following that the borrower is obligated to pay under the loan documents to the extent necessary to protect the lender's interest in or the value of the homestead property:\n\n(A) taxes;\n\n(B) insurance;\n\n(C) costs of repairs or maintenance performed by a person or company that is not an employee of the lender or a person or company that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the lender;\n\n(D) assessments levied against the homestead property; and\n\n(E) any lien that has, or may obtain, priority over the lender's lien as it is established in the loan documents.\n\n(q) To the extent that any statutes of this state, including without limitation, Section 41.001 of the Texas Property Code, purport to limit encumbrances that may properly be fixed on homestead property in a manner that does not permit encumbrances for extensions of credit described in Subsection (a)(6) or (a)(7) of this section, the same shall be superseded to the extent that such encumbrances shall be permitted to be fixed upon homestead property in the manner provided for by this amendment.\n\n(r) The supreme court shall promulgate rules of civil procedure for expedited foreclosure proceedings related to the foreclosure of liens under Subsection (a)(6) of this section and to foreclosure of a reverse mortgage lien that requires a court order.\n\n(s) The Finance Commission of Texas shall appoint a director to conduct research on the availability, quality, and prices of financial services and research the practices of business entities in the state that provide financial services under this section.

The director shall report his or her findings to the legislature not later than December 1 of each year.\n\n(t) A home equity line of credit is a form of an open-end account that may be debited from time to time, under which credit may be extended from time to time and under which:\n\n(1) the owner requests advances, repays money, and reborrows money;\n\n(2) any single debit or advance is not less than $4,000;\n\n(3) the owner does not use a credit card, debit card, or similar device, or preprinted check unsolicited by the borrower, to obtain an advance;\n\n(4) any fees described by Subsection (a)(6)(E) of this section are charged and collected only at the time the extension of credit is established and no fee is charged or collected in connection with any debit or advance;\n\n(5) the maximum principal amount that may be extended under the account, when added to the aggregate total of the outstanding principal balances of all indebtedness secured by the homestead on the date the extension of credit is established, does not exceed an amount described under Subsection (a)(6)(B) of this section;\n\n(6) (repealed);\n\n(7) the lender or holder may not unilaterally amend the extension of credit; and\n\n(8) repayment is to be made in regular periodic installments, not more often than every 14 days and not less often than monthly, beginning not later than two months from the date the extension of credit is established, and:\n\n(A) during the period during which the owner may request advances, each installment equals or exceeds the amount of accrued interest; and\n\n(B) after the period during which the owner may request advances, installments are substantially equal.\n\n(u) The legislature may by statute delegate one or more state agencies the power to interpret Subsections (a)(5)-(a)(7), (e)-(p), and (t), of this section. An act or omission does not violate a provision included in those subsections if the act or omission conforms to an interpretation of the provision that is:\n\n(1) in effect at the time of the act or omission; and\n\n(2) made by a state agency to which the power of interpretation is delegated as provided by this subsection or by an appellate court of this state or the United States.\n\n(v) A reverse mortgage must provide that:\n\n(1) the owner does not use a credit card, debit card, preprinted solicitation check, or similar device to obtain an advance;\n\n(2) after the time the extension of credit is established, no transaction fee is charged or collected solely in connection with any debit or advance; and\n\n(3) the lender or holder may not unilaterally amend the extension of credit.\n\n(Feb. 15, 1876.

All such indebtedness may be evidenced by bonds of such conservation and reclamation districts, to be issued under such regulations as may be prescribed by law. The Legislature shall also authorize the levy and collection within such districts of all such taxes, equitably distributed, as may be necessary for the payment of the interest and the creation of a sinking fund for the payment of such bonds and for the maintenance of such districts and improvements. Such indebtedness shall be a lien upon the property assessed for the payment thereof.

The indebtedness shall be a lien on the property assessed for the payment of the bonds. The Legislature may not authorize the issuance of bonds or provide for indebtedness under this subsection against a conservation and reclamation district unless a proposition is first submitted to the qualified voters of the district and the proposition is adopted.

Each such commissioners court and governing body may file its written consent or opposition to the creation of the proposed district with the governor, lieutenant governor, and speaker of the house of representatives. Each special law creating a conservation and reclamation district shall comply with the provisions of the general laws then in effect relating to consent by political subdivisions to the creation of conservation and reclamation districts and to the inclusion of land within the district.\n\n(f) A conservation and reclamation district created under this section to perform any or all of the purposes of this section may engage in fire-fighting activities and may issue bonds or other indebtedness for fire-fighting purposes as provided by law and this constitution.\n\n(Added Aug. 21, 1917; Subsec.

Transfer of service credit between the Employees Retirement System of Texas and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas also may be authorized by law.\n\n(3) Each statewide benefit system must have a board of trustees to administer the system and to invest the funds of the system in such securities as the board may consider prudent investments. In making investments, a board shall exercise the judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing that persons of ordinary prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income therefrom as well as the probable safety of their capital. The legislature by law may further restrict the investment discretion of a board.\n\n(4) General laws establishing retirement systems and optional retirement programs for public employees and officers in effect at the time of the adoption of this section remain in effect, subject to the general powers of the legislature established in this subsection.\n\n(b) State Retirement Systems.

The amount contributed by the state may not be less than six percent nor more than 10 percent of the aggregate compensation paid to individuals participating in the system. In an emergency, as determined by the governor, the legislature may appropriate such additional sums as are actuarially determined to be required to fund benefits authorized by law.\n\n(c) Local Retirement Systems. (1) The legislature shall provide by law for:\n\n(A) the creation by any city or county of a system of benefits for its officers and employees;\n\n(B) a statewide system of benefits for the officers and employees of counties or other political subdivisions of the state in which counties or other political subdivisions may voluntarily participate; and\n\n(C) a statewide system of benefits for officers and employees of cities in which cities may voluntarily participate.\n\n(2) Benefits under these systems must be reasonably related to participant tenure and contributions.\n\n(d) Judicial Retirement System. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the system of retirement, disability, and survivors' benefits heretofore established in the constitution or by law for justices, judges, and commissioners of the appellate courts and judges of the district and criminal district courts is continued in effect. Contributions required and benefits payable are to be as provided by law.\n\n(2) General administration of the Judicial Retirement System of Texas is by the Board of Trustees of the Employees Retirement System of Texas under such regulations as may be provided by law.\n\n(e) Anticipatory Legislation. Legislation enacted in anticipation of this amendment is not void because it is anticipatory.\n\n(f) Retirement Systems Not Belonging to a Statewide System.
