        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS – Purdue trustees continued to be effusive in their praise for President Mitch Daniels’ performance in the past year, even as they trimmed the “at risk” portion of his salary for missing several goals.\n\nDinged for missing fundraising goals set in December 2019, even as trustees said he hit every other mark during a year the university had to close campus and then work to reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic, Daniels received 89 percent of the metrics-based portion of his salary.\n\nThat dropped his salary 4.6 percent compared with the previous year, from $652,208 to $622,073.\n\nEven then, with an escalating $300,000 retention bonus built into the last year of a five-year contract, Daniels made $922,073 during the 2019-20 fiscal year – a 2.2 percent increase over the year before and that largest amount he’s made since he started the position in 2013.\n\nSince his first full year on the West Lafayette campus, when he made $530,880, Daniels’ annual compensation has grown 74 percent.\n\n“If it were up to me, it would be more,” Trustee Don Thompson said Friday, during a meeting held at the Purdue Polytechnic High School in Indianapolis. “But we know he wouldn’t take it.”\n\nMore: ‘A lot of crossed fingers’: Purdue’s campus reopening 'manageable' so far, as other schools retreat, higher ed monitors Mitch Daniels' plan\n\nWhen Daniels arrived at Purdue in 2013, he pushed for a salary structure that guaranteed a base rate, with the rest of it deemed “at risk” and tied to the trustees’ review of his performance.\n\nThe trustees each year have tied specific metrics in four broad categories: student affordability; student success, including graduation and retention rates; fundraising; and research productivity and reputation.\n\nOn top of a $430,500 base salary, Daniels’s contract puts another $215,250 – or half his base pay – on the line, based on his performance.\n\nThe 89 percent was his lowest mark since getting 88 percent in 2014. He received 103 percent and 100 percent of his at-risk salary in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nTrustee Malcolm DeKryger noted what he called highlights in Daniels’ year, including outpacing graduation rates and student retention rates, as well as landing a $40 million Lilly Endowment Inc. grant that will help speed construction of the Gateway Engineering and Polytechnic Complex on campus.\n\nHe also noted that Daniels missed fundraising marks, producing $342.1 million against at $375 million goal and 75,900 individual donors against a goal of 85,000.\n\nMore: Purdue lands $40M from Lilly Endowment toward engineering gateway complex\n\n“He got hit by something completely out of his control,” Trustee Michael Klipsch said, saying Daniels was on track to hit fundraising goals before the pandemic took its toll on the economy.\n\n“His achievement of having school open overshadows that,” Klipsch said. “That is the ultimate achievement that’s really not reflected in this at all.”\n\n“Can you imagine a year ago if we decided one of the objectives would be to keep the school open?” Trustee Gary Lehman said.\n\nIf that’s a new goal for Daniels during the 2020-21 fiscal year, trustees will lay that out in December.\n\nIn 2019, Daniels was listed fourth among Big Ten presidents in salary, trailing leaders at Northwestern, Ohio State and Penn State, according to data collected by the Chronicle of Higher Education in July. Daniels was listed just ahead of Indiana University President Michael McRobbie.\n\nLehman said those rankings could be off by not accounting for deferred compensation at other schools that Daniels doesn’t get in his contract. Lehman contended that Daniels was “pretty well in the middle” of the Big Ten.\n\n“I don’t think there are too many people on the board who feel we have an average president,” Lehman said.\n\nThe salary discussion came at a time when Purdue suspended pay raises as it navigates the effects of the pandemic and a campus reopening.\n\nFor 2019, Daniels made $902,207, including base pay, an at-risk portion of his salary and a $250,000 retention bonus that was part of a five-year contract extension that ran out at the end of June 2020. That year, trustees decided that Daniels had overshot the goals laid out, giving him 103 percent the at-risk pay, bumping that portion to $221,708.\n\nIn 2015, the trustees gave Daniels a raise when they extended his contract through June 2020. He continued to be guaranteed $420,000, but the at-risk portion grew to $210,000, or 50 percent of his base salary. The trustees also built in a retention bonus, starting at $100,000 in 2016 and increased by $50,000 each year he stays as president. He will be in line to get a $250,000 retention bonus in 2019 and $300,000 in 2020.\n\nFor 2019, trustees gave Daniels a merit-based raise to $430,500 in his base pay.\n\nThis year, Daniels is working under a year-to-year contract, approved in April 2018, which will pay him under the same terms as during 2019-20.\n\nHere’s how Daniels has done in total salary since his at-risk pay contract kicked in:\n\nIn 2014: $530,880, with 88 percent of the at-risk pay.\n\nIn 2015: $533,400, with 90 percent of the at-risk pay.\n\nIn 2016: $721,600, with 96 percent of the at-risk pay and a $100,000 retention bonus.\n\nIn 2017: $769,500, with 95 percent of the at-risk pay and a $150,000 retention bonus.\n\nIn 2018: $830,000, with 100 percent of the at-risk pay, plus a $200,000 retention bonus.\n\nIn 2019: $902,207, with 103 percent of the at-risk pay, plus a $250,000 retention bonus.\n\nReach Dave Bangert at 765-420-5258 or at dbangert@jconline.com.
