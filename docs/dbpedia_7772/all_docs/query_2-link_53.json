        "text": "NEWS RELEASE\n\nContact: Melissa Roberts, Energy Systems Network\n\nPhone: 317.532.4808 Email: [email protected]\n\nRaquel Bahamonde, Central Indiana Corporate Partnership\n\nPhone: 317.308.0064 Email: [email protected]\n\n(INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., March 14, 2013) Energy Systems Network (ESN), Indiana’s industry-driven clean technology initiative, elected two new members this week to its board of directors. Mitch Daniels, former Indiana governor and president of Purdue University, and David Johnson, president and CEO of the Central Indiana Corporate Partnership (CICP) and BioCrossroads, are the latest additions to ESN’s diverse board.\n\nDaniels has over 30 years of experience in both the public and private sectors. He most recently finished two consecutive terms as Governor of the State of Indiana before becoming Purdue University’s President in early 2013. Previously, Daniels held roles in the administrations of both former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. He also held senior level positions at Eli Lilly & Co. and the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank and public policy research organization.\n\n“Our mission is to accelerate innovation in the new energy economy through public-private partnerships, and nobody has a deeper understanding of how to make these partnerships work than President Daniels,” said ESN Board Chairman Thomas Snyder, president of Ivy Tech Community College. “Moreover, Purdue University offers a unique pipeline of energy solutions which ESN can connect to the global marketplace.”\n\nESN President and CEO Paul Mitchell added, “We are trying to build an energy ecosystem in Indiana that will generate jobs and investment, and we can learn a great deal from the person who made Indiana the nation’s best ‘sandbox’ for companies to grow.”\n\nJohnson is a long-time business leader and Harvard educated lawyer, who was one of the original organizers of BioCrossroads in 2003, a CICP initiative that seeks to invest in and advance the state’s life sciences sector. In late 2012, Johnson was also named the new President and CEO of CICP, replacing Mark Miles, also a former ESN board member.\n\n“David has been at the center of building Indiana’s life sciences sector into a national model,” Snyder said. “His experience and lessons learned will help ESN as we strive to establish a similar cluster in clean-tech.”\n\nBoth new board members were formally elected at ESN’s board meeting in Indianapolis, Ind. on March 12, 2013. Since ESN’s launch in 2009, former President of Purdue University France Cordova and former CICP President and CEO Mark Miles held positions on the ESN board.\n\nAbout Energy Systems Network:\n\nEnergy Systems Network (ESN) is an initiative of the Central Indiana Corporate Partnership. It is a non-profit industry-driven economic organization focused on the development of the energy technology “clean-tech” sector. ESN provides project development and coordination for joint ventures and cooperative partnerships between network members to bring new energy technologies to market. ESN partners include a wide range of Fortune 500 firms, emerging technology companies, and research and educational institutions with expertise in advanced technology vehicles, distributed power generation, advanced biofuels, renewable energy and energy efficiency.
