        "text": "Effective July 7, 2014: VA is changing its monetary burial benefits regulations to simplify the program and pay eligible survivors more quickly and efficiently. These regulations will authorize VA to pay, without a written application, most eligible surviving spouses basic monetary burial benefits at the maximum amount authorized in law through automated systems rather than reimbursing them for actual costs incurred.\n\nUnder the current regulations, VA pays for burial and funeral expenses on a reimbursement basis, which requires survivors to submit receipts for relatively small one-time payments that VA generally pays at the maximum amount permitted by law.\n\nThe new burial regulations will permit VA to pay, at a flat rate, burial and plot or interment allowances thereby enabling VA to automate payment of burial benefits to most eligible surviving spouses and more efficiently process other burial benefit claims.\n\nThe burial allowance for a non-service-connected death is $300, and $2,000 for a death connected to military service.\n\nBenefit\n\nService-related Death\n\nVA will pay up to $2,000 toward burial expenses for deaths on or after September 11, 2001, or up to $1,500 for deaths prior to September 11, 2001. If the Veteran is buried in a VA national cemetery, some or all of the cost of transporting the deceased may be reimbursed.\n\nNon-service-related Death\n\nVA will pay up to $796 toward burial and funeral expenses for deaths on or after October 1, 2019 (if hospitalized by VA at time of death), or $300 toward burial and funeral expenses (if not hospitalized by VA at time of death), and a $796 plot-interment allowance (if not buried in a national cemetery). For deaths on or after December 1, 2001, but before October 1, 2011, VA will pay up to $300 toward burial and funeral expenses and a $300 plot-interment allowance. For deaths on or after April 1, 1988 but before October 1, 2011, VA will pay $300 toward burial and funeral expenses (for Veterans hospitalized by VA at the time of death).\n\nAn annual increase in burial and plot allowances for deaths occurring after October 1, 2011 began in fiscal year 2013 based on the Consumer Price Index for the preceding 12-month period.\n\nEligibility Requirements\n\nYou paid for a Veteran's burial or funeral, AND\n\nYou have not been reimbursed by another government agency or some other source, such as the deceased Veteran's employer, AND\n\nThe Veteran was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable, AND\n\nThe Veteran died because of a service-related disability, OR\n\nThe Veteran was receiving VA pension or compensation at the time of death, OR\n\nThe Veteran was entitled to receive VA pension or compensation, but decided not to reduce his/her military retirement or disability pay, OR\n\nThe Veteran died while hospitalized by VA, or while receiving care under VA contract at a non-VA facility, OR\n\nThe Veteran died while traveling under proper authorization and at VA expense to or from a specified place for the purpose of examination, treatment, or care, OR\n\nThe Veteran had an original or reopened claim pending at the time of death and has been found entitled to compensation or pension from a date prior to the date or death, OR\n\nThe Veteran died on or after October 9, 1996, while a patient at a VA-approved state nursing home.\n\nNOTE: VA does not pay burial benefits if the deceased:\n\nDied during active military service, OR\n\nWas a member of Congress who died while holding office, OR\n\nWas a Federal prisoner\n\nEvidence Requirements:\n\nAcceptable proof of death as specified in 38 CFR 3.211., AND\n\nReceipted bills that show that you made payment in whole or part, OR\n\nA statement of account, preferably on the printed billhead of the funeral director or cemetery owner. The statement of account must show:\n\nThe name of the deceased Veteran for whom the services and merchandise were furnished, AND\n\nThe nature and cost of the services and merchandise, AND\n\nAll credits, AND\n\nThe amount of the unpaid balance, if any\n\nHow to Apply\n\nYou can apply online at Vets.gov, OR\n\nTo submit a paper application, download and complete VA Form 21P-530, Application for Burial Allowance and mail it to the Pension Management Center that serves your state, OR\n\nWork with an accredited representative, OR\n\nYou may also go to your local regional benefit office and turn in your application for processing.\n\nAdditional Information"
