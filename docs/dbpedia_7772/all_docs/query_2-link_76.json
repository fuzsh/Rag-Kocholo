DANIELS, JR. TO BE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET ---------- FRIDAY, JANUARY 19, 2001 U.S. Senate, Committee on Governmental Affairs, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:35 a.m., in room SD-342, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Lieberman, Levin, Carper, Carnahan, Thompson, Stevens, Collins, Voinovich, Domenici, and Cochran. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN LIEBERMAN Chairman Lieberman. Good morning. The Committee will please come to order. This morning we are holding a hearing to consider the nomination of Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Daniels, welcome to the Committee. We are very happy to have you with us today. I would also like to extend a warm welcome to Senator Carnahan, who along with Senator Carper are two new Members of our Committee. We are very pleased to have you join us and look forward to working with you on this Committee during this session. This is a weekend full of history, not the least of which is the fact that this hearing that I have the honor to preside over today is the one official act I will perform during this fleeting period of my chairmanship of this Committee. I am honored to have that honor, particularly in your case. I wonder if Senator Lugar and Senator Bayh have the time to hear Members of the Committee make opening statements. Then with the power vested in me as Chairman, I will proceed and then call on Senator Thompson. Mr. Daniels, as you well know, the job for which you have been nominated is a pivotal and demanding one. The Office of Management and Budget has authority far more sweeping than most people outside of government realize. As OMB Director, you will recommend where every Federal dollar is spent and help oversee how every Federal program is managed. You will have a leading role in shaping far more than just the annual budget. You will be formulating national policy. With that in mind, let me say that I hope one of your guiding principles will be the discipline that has normally come with this position, and I know that that is part of the very distinguished record of public and private service that characterizes your career. We have seen extraordinary growth over the last 8 years economically in this country, and I believe that has been fueled in no small part by the whittling of interest rates made possible by shrinking national debt, and growing governmental surpluses. I think it is wise counsel to continue as best we can, though the administration's political makeup is changing, with those policies, for which I think there is bipartisan support here in Congress, which means using the surplus to continue to pay down the debt, investing wisely in critical programs such as education and defense, and enacting tax cuts that give relief to the families of America, many of whom have continued to be hard-pressed, even in a good economy. For my part, you may not be surprised to hear, I find it difficult to justify a massive tax cut at a time when we are experiencing a modest economic slowdown and at a time when the exact size of the future surplus, though pleasing to contemplate, is uncertain, unclear. So I would offer at the outset a word of both caution and hope that, as the next OMB Director, you would emphasize the value of debt reduction, the brake it has put on inflation and interest rates, the wealth it has created and the confidence it has bred. Let us together use today's surplus to make the future of America and all Americans more secure. OMB's most pressing internal responsibility may well be managing the government's information policies, including the shift to digital governmental or, as it has come to be called, e-government. E- government will harness information technology to bring government closer to its citizens and citizens closer to the government, stimulating a broader knowledge base, greater efficiency and we think financial savings along the way. I was pleased that both presidential candidates talked about high-technology's role in the operations of government during last year's campaign; even both vice-presidential candidates talked about that, as I recall. Senator Thompson and I have been working together on a range of e-government proposals, and I hope the Committee will report them out and Congress will pass bipartisan legislation on this subject this year, and we look forward to your guidance and counsel in this effort. As to management, one of OMB's chief duties is to ensure that agencies implement the performance and accounting laws designed to give taxpayers as efficient and muscular a government as possible. These laws, which include the Government Performance and Results Act, the Chief Financial Officers Act, the Clinger-Cohen Act and the Inspectors General Act create a framework that addresses nearly every aspect of agency operations of our government. This Committee is proud to have played a role, again on a bipartisan basis, in developing these laws. I know that Senator Thompson and I together, regardless of which one of us happens to be Chairman at any given moment, intend to pursue the oversight of the implementation of these laws with vigilance, because they are what will spur the government to high performance with clearly defined missions that end in visible and good results. Again, I hope the Committee, OMB and the agencies will work together as we have in the past to prepare for the management tests that lay ahead at a time when taxpayers reasonably expect the most value for the least cost. Finally, let me discuss OMB's oversight of the Executive Branch regulatory process. From my perspective, this is one of the most consequential roles played by OMB, though not one that is well known. Through the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, if confirmed, Mr. Daniels, you will supervise the review of rules that provide critical protections to public health, worker safety, consumers and the environment. This Committee was actively involved in sorting out problems in the early years of regulatory review, problems that at that point undermined public trust in the fairness of the process. This morning, I would ask you to be vigilant and to oppose those who would use the process as a conduit to influence rule- making off the record and without disclosure. Regulatory agencies must have the capacity to do what Congress has asked them to do, in the full light of sunshine, to protect the public's interest. So, bottom line, we on the Governmental Affairs Committee and you at OMB have a lot of work to do together. We look forward to forging a partnership with you on these important matters in the public interest. Senator Thompson. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR THOMPSON Senator Thompson. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It is a great delight for me to be here today because of my friendship with the nominee, my personal regard for him, and the prospect of having someone with his background and capabilities working in this important job. A lot of the nominees, I think, are being told, ``You have a high level to live up to; we have peace and prosperity and things are going extremely well and so forth. So why would you take this job? You know you can only go downhill.'' In terms of the management of the Federal Government, you do not have that to worry about. We had another GAO report. The Comptroller came and gave us his latest high-risk list just the other day. It is obvious that we still have problems that are going in the wrong direction, such as waste, fraud and abuse with regard to the Federal Government, our lagging behind in the use of information technology, financial management, the security of our computers, and the fact that we now have a new risk that we have not had before, human capital. We are losing so many good people within 4 years. One-third of our entire workforce will be eligible for retirement, and up to one-half if these early-outs are available. This is the mass below the water level that now you are going to have to deal with. So a fresh start, I think at this time, is extremely good. I don't mean that just from a partisan standpoint, but I think from time to time we need a fresh look, and this is an area where we certainly need new leadership and strong, aggressive leadership with regard to the management side. We have many budget experts at this table here, such as the Chairman of the Budget Committee, and he will have an opportunity to talk about those issues in detail, but on the management side of things, a few more specifics. I have mentioned that because of years of neglect, our infrastructure is basically eroding. Many of the departments and agencies of government are vulnerable to waste, poorly managed, and antiquated. We are losing many of our best people. Numerous reports by the GAO and IGs before this Committee, along with a parade of witnesses from the outside who have testified before this Committee make these assertions irrefutable. The results are billions of dollars of waste, an increasing lack of ability to provide basic services, and an increasing cynicism among the American people. For example, the Federal Government of today is a crazy-quilt of agencies and programs that have evolved randomly over time in response to the real or perceived needs of the moment. In just about every area of Federal activity, multiple agencies and programs stumble over themselves to fix the same problems. Few would dispute that the government in Washington cannot do effectively all that it is now charged with doing. Much of what Washington does is inefficient and wasteful, and we do not have a handle on which programs work and which programs do not. Most Federal agencies do not adequately track receipts and disbursements and cannot account for billions of dollars in property and equipment. No one knows how much waste, fraud and mismanagement cost taxpayers, since the Federal Government makes no systematic effort to keep track of it. Based on just a few examples from GAO and the IG reports, our Committee staff came up with a figure of $220 billion, $35 billion in just 1 year alone. The Federal Government seems utterly incapable of using information technology to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness. One agency after another has wasted billions of dollars on failed information technology projects. Weaknesses in government information systems make them vulnerable to computer attacks from international and domestic terrorists, crime rings and everyday hackers. These weaknesses jeopardize government operations and threaten the privacy of our citizens. In recent years, the Federal Government reduced staffing without cutting back on anything that the government does. Federal downsizing usually is just a numbers game carried out randomly, rather than strategically. Consequently, many agencies now face severe shortages of employees with the necessary skills and expertise to carry out their mission. There is mounting evidence that workforce deficiencies are an emerging crisis in the Federal Government, and the Comptroller the other day, of course, acknowledged that was the case. It came as no surprise when he put it on the high-risk list. Agency regulatory programs impose tremendous costs and burdens on our businesses, State and local governments, and citizens. However, the Federal Government in general and the OMB in particular are not doing nearly enough to ensure the benefits of these rules justify their cost, and respect principles of federalism. Over the past decade, Congress enacted a number of laws designed to change how Washington works. Foremost among them was the Government Performance and Results Act, known as the Results Act. As its name implies, the act seeks to change the mind-set in Washington from what the government does--spending money, issuing regulations and so forth--to what actual results those activities produce. However, we still find that most agencies have trouble explaining what results they are trying to achieve and certainly in measuring how well they achieve them. Problems like these would attract the urgent attention of almost any executive in the private sector. They understand that investing adequate capacity and resources and then managing them effectively are key to achieving their missions. On the other hand, management problems are considered too mundane and too boring to warrant the attention of Washington leaders. Our leaders prefer to focus on policy issues. However, inattention to management and performance problems are just as devastating for the Federal Government as in the private sector, because they cost the taxpayers countless billions in waste, limit the capacities of agencies to achieve their stated and statutory missions, and threaten the ability of Presidents to carry out their policy agenda. The only answer to these problems is strong leadership from the top, and I believe it will be met with strong, bipartisan support. People implementing programs have to know what is important to people in charge. People they put in charge of government programs have to know that management is important. That has not been the case recently, and I hope it will be the case on your watch. Thank you very much. Chairman Lieberman. Thanks very much, Senator Thompson. Senator Carnahan, would you like to make an opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CARNAHAN Senator Carnahan. Yes. I want to welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Daniels, and certainly commend the President for sending us such a capable and respected nominee. Mr. Daniels. Thank you, Senator. Senator Carnahan. I am really quite intrigued by the possibilities of your position. You have the chance to change the perception of government. In a significant way, you can impact the quality of services that are delivered to our citizens by government. At a time when Americans hold the view that government is working against them, not for them, you will have the opportunity to restore the belief of the American people that their government is, in fact, working for them. Making government accessible, accountable and agreeable is a priority of mine. In order to achieve this goal and all the other priorities that will fall within your jurisdiction, I see it as an imperative that we work very closely together, and I look forward to that opportunity. Thank you very much. Chairman Lieberman. Thank you, Senator Carnahan. Senator Voinovich. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR VOINOVICH Senator Voinovich. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I would like to welcome our two new Members of this Committee, Jean Carnahan and Tom Carper. I got to know Jean through the Spouses' Organization of the National Governors' Association, and Tom and I served together as chairman and vice-chairman of the National Governors' Association. We look forward to working with you on this Committee, and I think share some of the same perspectives because we have had a little experience on the management side of government. I would like to welcome Mr. Daniels and say that you have a very difficult job ahead of you. Mitch and I have known each other for a long time. I got to know him when I was Mayor of Cleveland and President of the National League of Cities and he was a member of the Reagan Administration, and I found him to be bright, hard-working, a man of integrity and a man of his word. I just want to say that you do have your work cut out for you, and as Senator Thompson has said, we wonder why you are willing to take it on. I think my colleagues know that I am a debt hawk, and I shared that with you when you were in my office. One of the main reasons I ran for the Senate was to bring fiscal discipline to Washington, just as I tried to do as Mayor of Cleveland and Governor of Ohio. In the first 2 years of my Senate term, we have had some good news and bad news on that front. The good news is that we did not use the Social Security surplus in 1999, 2000, and 2001, and we did not use the Medicare surplus in 2000 and 2001. For all intents and purposes, we lockbox those surpluses. I would hope that this year Congress would pass legislation formally lockboxing the Social Security surplus and the Medicare Part B surplus so we take it off the table and it will not be spent in the future. The bad news is that, in my opinion, we have spent far too recklessly during the past 2 years. Non-defense discretionary spending in fiscal year 2000 rose 9.3 percent over 1999, to $328 billion. Fiscal year 2001 discretionary spending rose 8.1 percent and non-defense discretionary spending rose 12 percent--think of that--this, despite an inflation rate of only 2 percent. The only silver lining is that due to our roaring economy, we were able to see $87 billion of our on-budget surplus go for debt reduction. I have got to tell you that would not have happened had it not been for us doing hand-to- hand combat to make sure that money was not spent. Fiscal year 2001 estimates show we will have a $98 billion on-budget surplus. That money cannot be used for tax reduction, but I can assure you that between now and the time this budget fiscal year ends, there are going to be lots of people out there wanting to spend that $98 billion. The Heritage Foundation has come up with some recommendations on how we could pass legislation to take that money now, write a check, and put it into an account so we guarantee that it will not be spent and that it will go to reduce the on-budget surplus this year. I am also concerned about the overconfidence being placed in 10-year budget surplus projections, projections that are being used to make far- reaching policy decisions. Just recently we have seen it has been a ping-pong between the outgoing administration and the new administration. I think it is ridiculous to base this country's economic future on 10-year projections. The main problem is that those projections are prone to errors and they depend on Congress to rein in spending, something Congress has not been dong a very good job of lately. Remember that in 1997, CBO projected a $167 billion unified budget deficit for fiscal year 2000. Last July, CBO re-estimated that it would be a surplus of $268 billion. That is a swing in 4 years of $435 billion--in 3 years. We should also remember that the budget surpluses can swing back to deficits just as quickly, decreasing our ability to pay for tax cuts or spending increases without increasing the national debt. Reducing the national debt has been a priority in this country for a long time, a long time we have talked about it, and now that we have the chance, I think we should get it done. We owe it to our children. We owe it to our grandchildren and we owe it to fiscal responsibility and the future 10-year projections that we have for Medicare and Social Security. Reducing the national debt would help decrease the 13 cents out of every dollar that is spent for interest costs, which is more than we spend on Medicare in this country. Paying down that debt would also shift investment capital to more- productive uses in the private sector and stimulate economic growth, and I would say that it would work more quickly to deal with a downturn than even reducing taxes at this time, because it will take several years for the reduction to take effect. In fact, Alan Greenspan has said that to continue to pay down that debt is the best thing we can do for our economy. Mr. Daniels, I would hope you would present a budget that gives high priority to reducing the debt. I was pleased with what Senator Lieberman had to say about reining in the growth of Federal spending. Senator Stevens will tell you that a lot of this money is going to entitlements and securing our national defense and, yes, providing for tax reduction. Your budget submission and the budget resolution that Congress passes will be the first test of bipartisan cooperation and will set the tone for the rest of the 107th Congress. How we work that out, I can tell you, will set the tone for the rest of what we do. One other concern that I have is the need to implement a biennial budget process, and I applaud President-elect Bush's support of a biennial budget. I can tell you that Senator Domenici was the main sponsor of that in the 106th. He is going to sponsor it again in this session, and I am going to be glad to support that 2-year budget. Another area of concern is the GAO's high-risk list, which shows the Federal agencies or program areas most vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement. I will not get into them because Senator Thompson has spoken to them eloquently. In 1990, that list comprised 14 agencies or programs. The 2001 list, which was published last week, has 22. The only addition to the list this year is the human capital crisis. I would hope that you tackle that high-risk list and develop a serious strategy on how you intend to work it down. Long ago, I concluded that because Federal employees and human capital management have been overlooked, for all practical purposes there is no M in OMB. Indeed, government management has not been a priority; perhaps dealing with our annual budget leaves no time and you spend all your time worrying about the budget every year. The ``A-team,'' the men and women who do the work, have been neglected for years. Instead of Federal workers being looked upon as something to cut, we should treat them as assets to be valued and nurtured. It is the only way we are going to get continuous improvement in government today. We have got to get at our workers and get them involved in quality. Many of the political appointees that run our Federal agencies will need to rely on the best management practices or experience, and one of the challenges for this next administration, that was not addressed by the outgoing administration, is ensuring that management gets attention. As Chairman of the Oversight and Government Management Subcommittee of this Committee, I have been able to look into the manner in which the Executive Branch manages its people. I held six hearings in the 106th Congress to examine the human capital management policies of the Federal Government. I have developed two goals for those hearings: One, to empower Federal employees, just like businesses have done. The businesses in this country that have empowered their employees in quality management are the ones that are successful today and competing. Two, deal with the human capital crisis that is draining talent and experience from the Federal Government. Again, Senator Thompson has laid that out for you. On the latter issue, the American people need to know the magnitude of this pending crisis. By 2004, 32 percent of all of our Federal workers will be eligible for retirement and another 22 percent will be eligible for early retirement. Think of that, almost 50 percent of the Federal workforce could go out the door by 2004. I talked to Joe Allbaugh, who is the President-elect's designee for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the other day and I told him that he could lose one- third or up to one-half of his people. He had panic on his face, because floods and hurricanes do not wait for a government program. They come on you without any warning. This past Wednesday at Christie Whitman's confirmation hearing, I told her that over at the EPA, research and enforcement could be affected as scientists and lawyers retire. Last month, I released a report to help the new administration respond to this crisis before it reaches critical mass. OPM should tackle this emphatically and immediately, reaching out and teaming up with EPA to develop solutions to the crisis. One key component will be the selection of a strong Deputy Director of Management. In Congress, we stand ready to work with the administration to resolve this coming crisis. We must ensure that people understand how serious it is. In the meantime, Mr. Daniels, I hope you quickly familiarize yourself with the government's overall human capital needs and take quick action where you can, in order to respond to the challenge. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Daniels has his work cut out for him. I believe he will make a terrific Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I congratulate the President-elect for his choice and I want you to know we all look forward to working with you as you take on the challenge. Mr. Daniels. Thank you, Senator. Chairman Lieberman. Thanks very much, Senator Voinovich. Senator Carper, I welcomed you in absentia. It is a pleasure to now welcome you in person as a Member of this Committee. You bring your considerable experience as a Governor to this Committee, one of whose responsibilities is federalism, the relationship between the Federal and State Government. So thank you and we welcome an opening statement at this time. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CARPER Senator Carper. Chairman Lieberman, thank you very much for the warm welcome. I am delighted to be joining you and Senator Thompson, and other colleagues around the table. To our nominee, welcome. Congratulations on your nomination. We look forward to serving with you, and I suspect that some folks in this room today are your family, and we welcome them as well, and we thank you for your willingness to share a good man with the people of America. As Senator Lieberman had suggested during his remarks, before I was elected to the Senate I served as Governor of my little State for 8 years and served with Senator Biden, the National Governors Association, and with George Voinovich and with now-Senator Carnahan, as well. If you have been looking at me instead of watching Senator Voinovich speak, you would have seen my lips moving, and the reason why is because I agree with much of what he says, and that has been the case for a long time on a lot of subjects. I found as governor--I chose a great time to be governor--8 years of economic expansion, robust revenue growth. Before I was Governor, I was a congressman for 10 years when we had a real tough time trying to balance our budgets. Before that, I was State Treasurer for 6 years, of Delaware, when we had the worst credit rating in the country, at a time when we initially would always underestimate spending and overestimate revenues, a classic recipe for running deficits and we were pretty good at that back in the 1960's and 1970's. I found, though, that with robust revenue growth in the last 8 years, that sometimes it is easier to budget when resources are scarce than when resources are plentiful. We are now in a time of plentiful resources. As Senator Voinovich had suggested, the Congress and the President have spent willingly. I know there are a lot of important nominees that the President-elect has sent to us for consideration. I really believe yours might be the most important, and I hope you are as good as your supporters and admirers say, because we are going to need someone with great skill and intellect and ability. I want to mention a couple of things I want you to think about, and when we get back to questions, I will follow up on these. We have, I think, a great opportunity before us in the form of a budget surplus of some great magnitude. The question for us is what do we do with it, and I would hope that we use a significant portion of it to pay down our debt and to really make us debt-free as a Nation over the course of the next decade. If you look at the tax cuts that have been proposed by the President-elect, many of those tax cuts, the biggest part of them kick in towards the end of this decade, which is when, a lot of times, a lot of our baby boomers want to kick out or step out or step down and to retire. We just have to be mindful of that. I hope as we go forward, Congress and the President and the new administration working together, we can decide to use a portion of these surpluses to pay down our debt with an eye toward making us debt-free as a Nation by the end of this decade. I hope we can use some of the savings that flow from that debt reduction to shore up, particularly, the Medicare trust fund. I am a Democrat who likes to cut taxes, and we cut taxes 7 years in a row in my little State. We put in place a litmus test for those tax cuts that said they ought to be fair, they ought to stimulate economic growth, they should simplify the tax code, not make it more complex, and finally they should be sustainable throughout the full business cycle. We have had 8 wonderful years--actually, 9 wonderful years of economic growth, but what was that Harry Truman used to say? The only thing we do not know today is the history we have forgotten-- something to that effect. I am sure you recall his actual quote. We are going to have recessions again, and the OMB and CBO forecasts that we see assume no economic recession. I think it is just important that we keep in mind that the laws of economics have probably not been reinvented, at least not on our watch. The last thing I would say, in addition to cutting taxes, that in accordance with some kind of litmus test, I hope roughly aligned with what I have laid out, I hope we can do something good for people who don't have health care. I applaud the President-elect's proposal for a refundable tax credit, which I think has a lot of merit. I also like the idea of putting in place a prescription drug program for folks that are older and who need prescription drugs, and finally to invest in our schools. As Senator Voinovich mentioned--maybe to do a little on the defense side to ensure our readiness and our ability to deploy forces does not diminish. That is a lot to do. We have a lot of money to do it with. At the end of the day, I hope we have acted wisely, rationally, and not foolishly, and have not frittered away a wonderful opportunity to do great good for our country with the dollars that are now at our disposal. Again, congratulations on your nomination, and Mr. Chairman, I would ask unanimous consent to add to what I have just said, a written statement for the record. [The prepared statement of Senator Carper follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR CARPER Mr. Chairman, Senator Thompson, and Members of the Committee, it is a privilege to be joining you today for the first time. I am grateful for the opportunity to serve on this distinguished Committee, with its distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member, and I am looking forward to working with all of you on the issues that lie before us. Certain of the President-elect's nominees are obviously attracting more attention from the media than others, and I can imagine that Mr. Daniels would count it as a blessing that he is among those who are attracting less rather than more attention in this regard. Nevertheless, let me just start off by saying that there is no more important post in the new administration--in my opinion--than the one to which Mr. Daniels has been nominated at OMB. When the President- elect chose Mr. Daniels to head OMB, he let it be known that Mr. Daniels will be one of his key advisers and one of the people most responsible for ensuring that the Federal Government maintains fiscal discipline. Mr. Chairman, given the record of the last decade, and all that we have learned over the last decade about the importance of fiscal discipline to the health of our economy, this responsibility is clearly one of the more important responsibilities that will fall to the new administration. At this moment when the responsibility to manage fiscal and economic policy is being passed from one administration to another, I think we need to be clear about the role that fiscal policy has played in fostering the economic expansion of the last decade. As you know as well as anyone, Mr. Chairman, the current expansion has been fueled primarily by an unprecedented wave of private investment and innovation, unleashed in no small part as a result of the concerted effort that has been made, on the part of the President and the Congress--on the part of Republicans and Democrats together--to restore a modicum of fiscal discipline here in Washington. Now some of these days are espousing the view that a concern for fiscal discipline is an outmoded view--that fiscal discipline is ``no longer a problem.'' Indeed, some have even suggested that--as a long- time fiscal conservative--I may soon need to find myself a new set of budget priorities, and a new economic outlook, now that the era of deficits has given way to a new era of surpluses. I want to use this opportunity, if I might, to make it very clear that, as far as I am concerned, fiscal discipline remains critically important--indeed, in certain respects it has never been more important than it is today. The rate of private savings in this country is currently negative, Mr. Chairman, and despite all the progress that has been made in moving the Federal Government from a position of a borrower to a position of generating net savings, our economy remains highly dependent on borrowing from abroad--and thus highly susceptible to a loss of confidence on the part of foreign investors in our commitment to maintaining a responsible fiscal posture. Many economists are warning that a loose fiscal policy--whether it comes from irresponsible tax cuts or from excessive spending--could potentially undermine confidence in the dollar, leaving the Federal Reserve with a lose-lose choice between raising interest rates in the face of a slowing economy or allowing the dollar to deteriorate unchecked, thus risking a return to the days of 1970's-style stagnation. When one considers that the retirement of the baby boom generation--with all that that implies for the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook--lies just around the corner, it seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that now more than ever, we need to proceed with a realistic view of the surplus that might be available to the President and the Congress for the purpose of tax cuts or new spending initiatives. It also suggests to me that we must make a point of paying off our national debt in this decade and shoring up Social Security and Medicare sooner rather than later. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to hearing from Mr. Daniels today and, particularly, to discussing his views with respect to the responsibilities of the Director of OMB for promoting fiscal discipline and presenting the public with an accurate picture of the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook. Chairman Lieberman. Without objection, so ordered. Thanks, Senator Carper. We are honored on this Committee to have a couple of the real powerhouses of the Senate seated next to each other. Senator Cochran. Just a couple? [Laughter.] Chairman Lieberman. Oh, yes. I am sorry. Excuse me. There are an unlimited number of powerhouses on this Committee. I will not enumerate the number, but one of them is Senator Domenici. Senator Domenici. Well, you're getting a bit cocky around here. [Laughter.] Senator Cochran. I really had in mind Senator Lugar. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR DOMENICI Senator Domenici. First, I want to apologize for leaving. I have a very important engagement, and I came early in an effort to make sure that you heard my views on a few things, but most importantly my views about you. Congratulations. I commend the President on appointing you and I hope we confirm you quickly. I do want to say that I have observed, as you work to put together a staff, that you look for the very best. As a matter- of-fact, you have taken some of my staff from the Budget Committee, and I just want to tell you enough is enough. I, too, have to produce a budget and do something, but in any event I think you're putting together an exquisite team and that is what is necessary. I will not comment today, Mr. Daniels, about management. These are experts at the various laws that we have. I tell you, though, it is not a very politically sexy thing, so it is left to lag. When you try to do it from the top, it does not work. You just have to dig at it and it is just not easy. I share Senator Voinovich's concern about the Federal workforce. He has worked hard on that and we ought to listen to him. I am here to tell you that the U.S. economy, U.S. fiscal policy, is in very good shape. By the end of this year, we will have applied to the national debt, $600 billion. There are some good friends of mine that would say, ``That is not enough. Every bit of surplus ought to go on the national debt.'' I predict for everyone here that before we finish the debate this year on the size of the surplus, that there will be experts telling us we should not use the entire surplus to pay down the debt as quickly as it would mathematically permit. We are going to find that we are not going to be able to pay down a lot of the debt without an enormous cost. I can say to all three of you that are there that 20- and 30-year Treasury bonds are going to become so valuable that we are not going to want to buy them up, because people think they are the greatest investment in the world and the premium we are going to pay is going to be extremely high. Nonetheless, let me give you a few numbers and, in my statement, pose a situation for you. We need your estimates and your economic forecast sooner rather than later. We have talked about it. You need to do it right, but you need to do it quickly. What we are finding out, Mr. Daniels, through our investigation and what we think the Congressional Budget Office is going to tell the Congress, that the surplus over the next decade, whether my good friend from Ohio wants to use 10 years or not, we are going to do that and he can argue the fallacies in it, but it is going to be used and here is what it is going to show: It is going to show that the surplus accumulating over the decade is $5.7 trillion. Nobody in this room really understands that. That is a huge number, and the question really is over the next decade are we taking too much money from the American taxpayers or not? I think that is a very interesting question that should be debated. I have concluded that we are, because I think we can put every penny of Social Security on the debt, and you have already looked at that. It belongs on the debt and it will pay down the debt in 11 to 12 years. I happen to think that is very fast and maybe when we get near the end, it may even be too fast, in which event I do not know what to do with that. I tell you, if the Federal Government has cash after debt payment per year sitting around in a drawer, we have never heard of anything like that and nobody on God's Earth knows what should happen to it. In any event, you are going to prepare for us your budget, and then we are going to ask you to help us work with the Budget Committee to come up with a budget that the President of the United States can support, also. I just came today to tell you that we are going to try to work bipartisan, but there is also another player, and he got elected to be the President. I can tell you I am going to try as chairman to do as many things as I can in the budget resolution so that his desires for this Nation are met, and among those clearly are to look at this surplus from the standpoint of whether or not there is sufficient money in that surplus to give some of it back to the American taxpayers. Frankly, there has not been a lot said lately about whether the President's number of $1.3 trillion, which was the estimate of his tax cut is too big or not. I can tell you the amount of the surplus has grown so much since he put that on the table that it is a very different number versus the surplus. Just to put it in numbers, there will be $3.2 trillion left over after you pay Social Security, and if you were to give the President $1.3 trillion, just do the arithmetic, and you will have the rest of that to add to government, where government needs priorities, government needs defense, government needs education, government needs a lot of things. Let's hope we are not going to try to grow government astronomically, but rather relatively well. Those are the numbers. How we apply them and how soon you get to them is going to be your business, but I cannot see how you are going to be far off, because the Congressional Budget Office is very close to this, and they are the ones we normally follow. We hope you are close so we can follow both of you, because you understand there is an anomaly in the law. If you have to sequester, you sequester off your estimates, not off of CBO's, but we follow Congressional Budget Office in what we do. If they are close, we are on the same wavelength in terms of your responsibilities. Mr. Chairman, I am sure we will not be calling you that for very long. Chairman Lieberman. But I appreciate it. Senator Domenici. It is a pleasure to do that. Chairman Lieberman. Thank you, sir. Senator Domenici. Frankly, I mean that. Thank you for all your hospitalities, and to the new Senator--there is only one here--look forward to working with you on various assignments. Thank you very much. Chairman Lieberman. Thanks, Senator Domenici. I know you had a previous commitment. I really appreciate that you took the time to come and make that statement today. With regard to my previous statement, is there any Member of the Senate here who would disagree with the description of Senator Stevens as a powerhouse? [Laughter.] Senator Collins. Only at great risk. Senator Voinovich. I certainly would not. Chairman Lieberman. Any Member of the Senate who does not have matters pending before the Appropriations Committee? [Laughter.] Senator Stevens, thanks for being here. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR STEVENS Senator Stevens. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I, too, have some of your colleagues on the President's nomination list waiting in my office, but I wanted to be here to welcome you. I wonder if we could ask the Chairman's agreement that we ask your family to stand so we can say hello while we are still here? Chairman Lieberman. Please. Senator Stevens. Would you do that? I think that Cheri, Megan, Melissa, Meredith, Margaret--how many are here today, Mitch? Mr. Daniels. We have got about two-thirds complement, Senator. [Applause.] Senator Stevens. We welcome you and I welcome you as a former Hoosier, so that is why I am happy to see you here. When I was Chairman of this Committee, I tried to enforce the rule that opening statements were no longer than 3 minutes. I think we can all see the advisability of that rule this morning. I hope it will soon be restored. My only comment would be thank you for taking this on. I think you will spend more time with Senator Domenici and I than you want to spend, and our colleagues in the House, and our counterparts now, particularly here. Senator Byrd and I spend a great deal of time with the OMB. It is, as other Members have said, probably the most important position in government now, short of being the President. I think Vice Presidents--pardon me, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Lieberman. Under the circumstances, go right ahead. Senator Stevens [continuing]. Do not have the responsibilities that you will have, and I remember when you worked with Dick Lugar. We worked with you over the years and I commend you for having the commitment to our democracy to return, because it is an awesome obligation that you are undertaking. You have heard a little bit here about some people who think that the past has been a prologue of excess. I am afraid that the slowing down of the economy triggers a lot more expenditures than people realize. As a matter of fact, it is going to be very hard to deal with the budget, with the cap we have, that still lasts for one more year, and we have a 50/50 split here in the Senate. I told the Vice President-elect that he is going to find that he is going to keep his own seat warm in the Senate for a long time this year. It is going to be a difficult thing to deal with your issues more than anyone realizes. I am delighted that you have the experience in government and business that you have. We need both right now. We need some common sense as to how to keep this expanding economy expanding even more, whether it is jobs we need for new people and for the residents that I think comes to the whole democracy if we are healthy. I look forward to working with you. I can tell you that there are some immediate problems on your desk, Mitch. So we will be seeing you next week early. Thank you very much. Mr. Daniels. Thank you, Senator. Chairman Lieberman. Thank you very much, Senator Stevens. Senator Cochran. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR COCHRAN Senator Cochran. I am going to stay well within the 3 minutes. I want to congratulate Mitch Daniels on his nomination as Director of Office of Management and Budget and wish you every success as you undertake this important responsibility. I have some concerns and some views on the subject that we will be discussing, and I will reserve those questions and comments until we get around to that part of the hearing. Chairman Lieberman. Thanks. Senator Collins. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR COLLINS Senator Collins. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I know that you and the once-and-future Chairman agree on many, many issues, but I did hope that during your short tenure as Chairman, you would reverse the previous Chairman's decision to buy water from Tennessee and go back to the pure New England water from Maine. [Laughter.] Chairman Lieberman. Right. I apologize to you and the farsighted, wise people of Maine for not having seen that momentary opportunity and seized it. Senator Collins. You could have seized the moment. I do commend you and Senator Thompson for holding this hearing today on what, as my colleagues have noted, is a very important position in the Federal Government. Mr. Daniels, it is always nice to see another former Senate staffer do so well, and I want to commend you on accepting the President-elect's request that you serve in his administration in this very critical position. With your experience in government, as well as your experience in business, and particularly the terrific service that you gave to Senator Lugar, I believe that you have abundant expertise to handle this very important position. Many Americans may not be that familiar with OMB, but its crucial role in the Federal Government in budgeting and management issues affects us all. The agency you are nominated to head plays a critical role in formulating the Federal budget, in setting priorities and in overseeing implementation by Executive Branch agencies. The work of OMB is often unseen, but your important mission includes a careful review of the effectiveness of government programs, as well as budget issues. Moreover, as we discussed in my office, my concern, which has been echoed by many of my colleagues this morning, is that previously OMB has neglected the critical management role that it plays in the Federal Government. I think that this neglect is very unfortunate, because neglecting management increases the cost of government programs, and it also means we are missing out on opportunities to improve their quality and make their delivery more effective. Reversing this is a heavy burden, but it is one I am confident you have the skills and the background and the commitment to undertake. So, again, I am delighted that you have been nominated for this important post. I am pleased to see your distinguished home-State Senators with you, as well, today. I look forward to working closely with you. Mr. Chairman, I do need to return to the Health Committee, which is holding a hearing on Governor Thompson's nomination, so I would ask unanimous consent that the questions I would have asked if I could stay be submitted for the record. Chairman Lieberman. Thanks very much, Senator Collins. Without objection, we will do that and we will ask Mr. Daniels to answer for the record. Thank you very much. Senator Lugar and Senator Bayh, our colleagues, thanks for your patience as Members of the Committee held forth. I think we view this as an opportunity to state our priorities to the nominee. Senator Lugar, I must tell you that I have not had the privilege of knowing Mitch Daniels personally before, but when I looked over his record, what jumped out at me was that he was a graduate of what might be called the Dick Lugar School of Public Service. That is a pretty proud school, so it spoke well for him and I am glad you are here this morning. STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD G. LUGAR, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF INDIANA Senator Lugar. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for inviting me. I appreciate Mitch inviting my colleague, Senator Evan Bayh, and me. This is a very rare privilege that each one of you will understand, that someone who has been a very close personal friend for 30 years is nominated by the President for this responsibility and is willing once again to serve. I want to describe just for a few minutes how this came to pass over that period of time. Mitch Daniels was a brilliant student in the public schools of Indianapolis, North Central High School; was designated for the Lyndon Johnson award as the outstanding high school scholar in our State in 1967; not surprisingly, succeeded with honors at Princeton University and subsequently received a doctorate of law at Georgetown. I found him through his family, and his parents, Mitch and Dottie Daniels, who are here today, and his wonderful sister, Debbie, who in herself is a distinguished attorney and public servant. They were a talented family, and still are in our town. He came to the mayor's office as a senior from Princeton University 30 years ago, a brilliant student but filled with idealism, a capacity for enormous imagination and a desire for public service. He proceeded to help me during a period of intergovernmental relations that was very exciting. We had revenue sharing in those days. We had new federalism. We had the whole proposition of the alternative model cities, in which we set up under the administration's guidance about every urban experiment known, at least at that time, and Mitch Daniels was at the forefront of those innovations. He came with me to Washington after the election of 1976. Each of us has been through that process, and I occupied Bill Brock's offices at his sufferance for awhile. Mitch determined to bring the best that he could for us and the best sense of our own budget in those days. He was remarkable in his administration of my Senate office for many years, until I succeeded in winning the chairmanship of the Republican Senatorial Committee after the election of 1982. He was my major domo, right here in this building on the fifth floor. Then he went on to political duties, to help me fulfill that situation in the political cycle of 1983-1984. It was inevitable that the White House would note his political prowess. The White House did, and seized Mitch Daniels shortly thereafter, when President Reagan was reelected, and he became the chief political strategist for the President of the United States and responsible for intergovernmental affairs in the White House, a remarkable responsibility in the second Reagan term. He returned to Indianapolis, because we had been successful in our town in obtaining the Hudson Institute. As he was looking for a permanent home, he became the chief executive of that remarkable think tank for 3 years, until he was identified by a very great firm in our city, Eli Lilly and Company. Mitch has served in the last capacity, and I will move in descending order, as senior vice president for corporate strategy and policy for the last 3 years and on the important policy committee of the company, its top management body. He served as president of the North American pharmaceutical operations from 1993-1997, and joined the company originally in 1990 as vice president for corporate affairs. For 10 years, he has had a senior management position, and in the case of North American operations, the executive management position for a very great American firm. I mention that because the idealism that was true at North Central and at Princeton proceeded through the Senate and through his responsibilities at the White House, through his responsibilities at a great think-tank, and broad corporate responsibility at the highest levels for the last 10 years. These have been very successful years for that firm. Let me just simply add, in addition to that, Mitch has been a remarkable citizen, as you might anticipate, of Indianapolis and of the State of Indiana. The legion of boards on which he serves, the honors that he has received, are remarkable and have been noted by the Committee. I simply commend him to you as a very good person. I would say that Mitch is a person in whom I have trusted, who is not only honest along with his brilliance, but likewise caring about people. This is why he ran a good staff and why we had a good shop right here in the Dirksen building some time ago. I thank you for allowing me to make this statement and I appreciate the nomination. Chairman Lieberman. Thanks, Senator Lugar, for that very special, personal statement. Senator Bayh, thanks for being here and offering bipartisan Hoosier support for Mitch Daniels. STATEMENT OF HON. EVAN BAYH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF INDIANA Senator Bayh. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to be with you today and the other Members of the Committee, and my esteemed colleague from Indiana, Senator Lugar, for whom I have enormous respect. I should also say, Mr. Chairman, that I am pleased to be here today to introduce and support the nomination of Mitch Daniels to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I find this exercise to be of some personal use, as well, following up on the comments of Senator Stevens, who had to leave. I am going to exercise some restraint in my own remarks when I am on the other side of the dais here. Someone came up to me not long ago and said, ``Senator, you know that in order for a speech to be immortal, it need not be eternal.'' I am going to try to bear that in mind. I am here today, Mr. Chairman, to support Mitch Daniels' nomination, because I think he combines the right set of skills necessary to do a good job, quantitative, analytical and interpersonal. Senator Voinovich, you will be pleased to know it is my strong belief that Mitch Daniels believes in fiscal responsibility. As a matter of fact, I believe he has previously embraced some of the very reforms that you mentioned in your remarks, such as biennial budgeting. I know he has written about the need for entitlement reform, in particular to address some of the concerns that you outline that will face us in the years to come if nothing is done. Senator Carper, I personally have discussed with him the need for sound budget analysis based upon solid numbers, not wishful thinking or political considerations, so that we do not undermine the credibility of our public policy decision-making, and he agreed with me along those lines, and I think would agree with you in the points you made. He has the business experience, Senator Thompson, that you indicated is important, and I agree. He knows how the decisions we make here in Washington will affect real people and real places across the country, and he will bring the kind of management expertise that Senator Lugar outlined to the task of trying to bring more coherence to the finances and the management of the Federal Government. Because of his private sector experience, he understands that we compete today in a global economy and he knows the importance of investing in research and technology so that we can have greater innovation in our society and create the high value-added jobs that are important to the future economic prosperity of America. Finally, I would note that Mitch Daniels has a long and honorable record, as my colleague mentioned, being an active participant in the Republican Party. I, of course, am a member of the other major political party. I am here today in the spirit of bipartisanship to support his nomination, because I think he will do a good job for the President-elect, he will do a good job for this country, and I wish him well in his public service. Mitch, I am pleased to wholeheartedly support your nomination and look forward to working with you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Lieberman. Thank you very much, Senator Bayh. Thanks to both of you for being here. You are free to stay or leave as your schedules dictate. Mr. Daniels, for the record, let me just indicate first that you have submitted responses to a biographical and financial questionnaire; that you have answered pre-hearing questions submitted by the Committee and additional questions from individual Senators, and that you have had your financial statement reviewed by the Office of Government Ethics. Without objection, this information will be made part of the hearing record, with the exception of the financial data, which is on file and available for inspection in the Committee's own offices. In addition, the FBI file has been reviewed by Senator Thompson and me, pursuant to the Committee rules. Mr. Daniels, our Committee rules require that all witnesses at nomination hearings give their testimony under oath, so I would ask you to please stand and raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God? Mr. Daniels. I do. Chairman Lieberman. Thank you. We would welcome any opening statement that you would like to make. TESTIMONY OF MITCHELL E. DANIELS, JR.\\1\\ TO BE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET Mr. Daniels. Thank you, Mr. Chairman; a brief one, if you please. I think I am safe in saying this is the sixth-biggest day of my life. It is a five-way tie for first, as each of the five Daniels women came into my life, starting with my bride and partner, Cheri, and the four Daniels girls. The two interior members of that set are with us today. Their younger sister, Maggie, is stricken with the flu and otherwise would be lighting up this room today, and their older sister, Megan, is attending to her studies. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The biographical and financial information appear in the Appendix on page 44. Pre-hearing questions and responses appear in the Appendix on page 54. Post-hearing questions and responses appear in the Appendix on page 92. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I want to stress, Senator Voinovich, that she was prudent enough to choose a school in Ohio, Denison University. I would like to tell Senator Thompson that Melissa, who is here, was farsighted enough to choose a school in Tennessee, Vanderbilt University. In recent days, I have been drawing to the attention of our senior in high school, Meredith, several fine schools in Connecticut. Chairman Lieberman. Excellent. [Laughter.] Mr. Daniels. But we were unsuccessful in securing her admission in a timely fashion. [Laughter.] Chairman Lieberman. I wish you had called. Mr. Daniels. I thank the Committee also for welcoming my other family members. My Mom and Dad are here, my sister, Deborah, and my brother-in-law, Lyle. Of course, I thank my two home-State Senators for coming by on a very busy day. My fitness for this office is, of course, for this Committee to judge. I only say that to the extent I am prepared, I owe this to a string of people for whom I have had the pleasure to work or with whom I have been associated; beginning, as was remarked, with Dick Lugar, including President Reagan, the trustees of Hudson Institute, who entrusted me with responsibilities there, and the chairman of Eli Lilly and Company, who gave me increasing opportunities to learn and grow. I want to thank my predecessors in the office that I may soon hold. I was able to speak to most of my recent predecessors and expect to speak to all of them when schedules coincide, but let me single out Jack Lew, a fine public servant, obviously, and a gentleman who welcomed me in his office immediately after I got to town and with whom I have spoken on other occasions since. He has been very forthcoming in his advice and has offered to help us make a smooth transition. Last, I'd like to compliment the staff of this Committee, an unusually vigorous group which has helped me prepare, through the rare opportunity to answer a significant number of questions and also to visit the other afternoon at this table in what was a very helpful session in concentrating my thoughts on the interest of their principles. Let me say finally that this nomination would be a great honor for a person at any time. I think this is an especially unique moment for this honor to come. Much about this job will be new to me, of course. I guess I take some comfort in noting that much about this situation will be new even to the most seasoned veterans here. We are new in the area of surpluses. This is unfamiliar ground and it will take some getting used to. I believe that in its way, a time of surplus is a time of greater danger, imprudence, and mistake than a time of deficits. We are also in a rather unique moment with a closely divided Congress, and this will require, if progress is to occur, probably a greater level of cooperation and bipartisanship than has often occurred in our history. The President-elect has committed himself to that. We have heard it spoken of here this morning. I hope we will all maintain our resolve to do that in the days just ahead of us. I have been studying diligently the work product of this Committee, both its legislative and oversight capacities, and I do want to say that in full view of the difficulties that may attend it, I am resolved to try to capitalize the ``M'' in OMB. This Committee, as I read through the record, has built an extraordinarily strong foundation, or framework, as you put it, Mr. Chairman, of bills that offer the opportunity and the charge to the Executive Branch to try to uplift its standards of performance and accountability. I detect in the record that I have read some frustration that this framework has not been fully implemented, and I know that is so despite very sincere efforts on the part of my predecessors. I know they have encountered a reality that I have been advised about since the first moment I accepted the job, which is that in our current all-day, every-day, all-year budget process, the time and attention of people at OMB will be totally devoured in that responsibility. I do not deny that that may be our fate, too, but I am determined to try to do honor to your efforts and to this 10- year history of important legislative breakthroughs to meet your expectations. Thank you for the opportunity to be here. Chairman Lieberman. Thanks, Mr. Daniels, for that excellent opening statement. I appreciate the last part, and we have talked about it a bit, the ``M'', the management part, and I thank you for that. To say the obvious, the Federal Government is an enormous enterprise that is, by its essence, free of the normal competitive pressures that tend toward efficiency and good management and the rest. There are internal forces, obviously, that do that, but one of the roles we have always seen here is to try to play that role and, of course, to ask the Director of OMB to do that every day, and I thank you for the emphasis you put on that. Let me say on the questioning that we are going to follow the 7-minute rule. My clock is already going, and I ask my colleagues, as the lights begin to flash, to try to keep within that time limit. I am going to start by asking certain questions that we ask of all nominees. So first, Mr. Daniels, is there anything that you are aware of in your background which might present a conflict of interest with the duties of the office to which you have been nominated? Mr. Daniels. No, sir. Chairman Lieberman. Do you know of anything personal or otherwise that would in any way prevent you from fully and honorably discharging the responsibilities of Director of OMB? Mr. Daniels. No, sir. Chairman Lieberman. Do you agree without reservation to respond to any reasonable summons to appear and testify before any duly constituted Committee of Congress if you are confirmed? Mr. Daniels. Yes, I do. Chairman Lieberman. Thank you very much. Several of us asked questions or made statements along the way about Federal Government fiscal policy, and for those who may be watching on television who focus in on, ``I am not quite sure what OMB does,'' as you well know, the Director is essentially the chief fiscal adviser to the President of the United States and is the key bridge, or certainly has been in the years that I have been here, between the Executive Branch and Congress on the major fiscal questions that we determine. So these matters are going to be right--you are a lot more, for those who are watching, than an auditor or a kind of budget enforcer. You are a policy-setter. Let me ask you to first speak, if you would, about the surplus projections. These are obviously good news, numbers that, for most of us, are unimaginable, $5.7 trillion projected in surplus. Yet, I think many of us on both sides of the aisle here are concerned about how much validity we can give to a 10-year projection, and in that sense, how much of the surplus that is projected over the next 10 years is it--I am about to use a favorite Bush family word--prudent? Is it prudent to commit today, which is to say if we commit all of it during this 107th Congress, won't future Congresses have little in the way of fiscal flexibility to address either unforeseen problems or new priorities? Mr. Daniels. I think those cautions are well stated, Mr. Chairman, and with Senator Voinovich and others, I would certainly agree that--with Ben Franklin--we ought to resolve to doubt our own infallibility when it comes certainly to projections of the kind that we have made. I note that the error bars around even nearer-term projections have been very sizable, certainly when measured against the large base of the Federal revenue and spending structure that we now have. So I take the point. I guess I am impressed, and positively so, at the narrow range in which most forecasts do now trade. There is, to me, striking convergence certainly on the economic side. We are trading in a much narrower range than I might have expected coming to town. That is not a reason to believe we can take that money to the bank, but I think it does give some confidence that the long-term outlook is very strong, remarkably strong, and while we ought to keep an eye on it day by day to make sure it is not eroding, as we all know, the recent trend has been upward, not downward, and I take some heart from that. Chairman Lieberman. How about the priority that you would give or you would advise the President-elect to give to debt reduction? Not only has it value in itself, but in its way, if circumstances change over time and the surplus projections are not quite as rosy as we believe they are now, money set aside over the 10 years for debt reduction has a little bit more fungibility to it than money we have committed to spend. What priority would you give, in response to the statements Senator Voinovich, Senator Carper, I and others made about debt reduction? Mr. Daniels. I think I would give it a very high priority, and I believe that is pretty near a consensus view. Again, there may be what I would describe as relatively modest differences about the degree and the pace of debt reduction. Senator Domenici alluded to some rather striking and happy new problems that we might encounter if we are able to pay down the debt at a rate that soon tests our ability to actually do so in a practical matter. The answer to your question is, I think, debt reduction is the price of admission to the budget debate. It certainly is an important part of the fiscal mix that the administration will present the Congress, and we look forward to working with this Committee and others on the exact swiftness and degree at which that occurs. Chairman Lieberman. I appreciate that. As you know, the President-elect's tax cut proposal is controversial here on Capitol Hill, but I want to try to take it out of a partisan context and just ask you to comment from two points of view. One is consistent with the questions I have just asked you and your own comments; when you think about the priority given to debt reduction, about the uncertainty of 10-year projections, isn't $1.3 trillion, leaving aside whether we think it is not progressive enough or whatever, isn't that too large of a chunk to take out of the resources that are available to us? The second question about it builds somewhat on the latest arguments that I have heard for the proposed tax cut, which is it may help to take the economy out of the slowing down it is in now. I was interested in that regard to note the comments that Secretary of the Treasury-designate Mr. O'Neill made the other day, where he, as I read them, seemed to raise questions about--obviously, there are arguments he did make and one could make for the tax cut proposal--but he seemed to be saying, ``Don't put too much emphasis on its ability to help us out of a slowdown, because it takes awhile, a tax cut of this kind, to work its way through the economy, and it is no substitute for the kind of action that the Federal Reserve has already begun to take in lowering interest rates, which immediately runs through the economy.'' I wonder if you could offer responses to both of those questions. Mr. Daniels. Yes, Mr. Chairman. A tax cut along the lines the President-elect proposed during the campaign will be part of the budget and should be, in my judgment, for several reasons. The first is simply that it honors a commitment and a promise, and I think the American people have a right to expect that officeholders will honor faithfully those commitments on which they ran. Second, the American people today are taxed at record peacetime rates, and I think that level, now running closer to 21 than to 20 percent, argues for some moderation over time. Third, I think, and perhaps here we will have a difference of opinion, but that the long-term growth of the economy can only be benefited by a well-crafted tax cut. If there is concern about the sustainability of the surplus numbers, which depend in large measure on steady, real growth in the economy, then this is an argument for, not against, a measure like that, that the President-elect will propose. Last, I would say that, in my judgment, the greater threat to the eventual reality of the large surpluses we have comes in some of Senator Voinovich's writings on this subject, can speak to this same point, really comes on the spending side. I do believe that the greatest danger to the surpluses of the future does not come from leaving more money in the hands of the people who earned it, but comes from leaving more money in the hands of people here in Washington, where we might be tempted to spend it at an imprudent rate. Chairman Lieberman. Let me ask you just briefly, because my time is up, to respond to Mr. O'Neill's statements the other day, about the major argument for this tax cut, its effect on stimulating the economy right now. Mr. Daniels. Yes, excuse me for answering that only indirectly. You notice I did not make a near-term stimulus argument among those that I listed. That does not mean that a tax cut could not have a near-term effect, and I think it would be a mistake to deny ourselves one of the two tools of economic policy, and rely simply on monetary policy. I will certainly defer to the Secretary-designate of the Treasury in his caution about making that claim, and I will simply stand on the statement that I think there are multiple, very sound reasons for the tax cut we will propose, even if one doubts that it will have a near-term effect. Chairman Lieberman. Thanks. Senator Thompson. Senator Thompson. Thank you very much. I had the privilege of discussing this very issue with Mr. O'Neill in the Finance Committee when he testified, and there is nothing inconsistent with what you have said and what he said in that context. I do think we should not make the mistake of trying to justify the tax cuts strictly on the basis of current economic conditions or make the mistake of relying totally upon the monetary side of the equation to correct things. That is always in response to something else and it is also something that we have no control over, basically, in terms of monetary policy. It looks to me that, in addition to what you said, the greatest danger to the debt retirement in the long run and the greatest danger to our ability to get a handle on the demographic time bomb that is facing us is lack of growth in the economy, and that the real justification for the tax cut, and especially the rate reduction, is the stimulation to investment and thereby creating growth, long-term growth of the economy. With that kind of growth, we can do something about all those things, and without sufficient growth, we cannot do anything about any of them. Although I think there is some justification for near-term considerations and current economic considerations, as you have said, and obviously it can be made so that withholding taxes can be adjusted and have an immediate effect, I would urge you to still put the major emphasis on the long-term benefit to the economy and the country in looking down the road and not simply trying to react to what is going on today or depending on the Fed to react to what is going on today. Getting back to these management issues, this is not something that we get a great deal of personal pleasure out of dealing with, at least I do not--these green eyeshade issues-- when you have more important things going on, but we are, if not the only, the main Committee that has to deal with this. In looking at it, we have no choice, and I have become more and more convinced that this is the fundamental underpinnings of everything else. It is like so many other things in government, long-term systemic problems, whether it is entitlement program reform-- the things we all know we have to do--are so difficult to do anything about. So we have to be extreme on the subject. That is why our staff may be the only staff that does such a formal pre-interview in the entire Congress, as you went through, and we appreciate that. We have to keep coming back and back and back again. A survey of historians and political scientists across the ideological spectrum recently ranked improving government performance as among the least successful of the Federal Government's 50 greatest endeavors over the past half-century. In looking at restoring OMB's management role, a case can be made that OMB, in some respects, has abdicated its management responsibilities and that it has provided little direction and leadership to agencies in implementing the Results Act, for example, that we talked about earlier. OMB's own Results Act strategic performance plans are among the worst in government. They are supposed to be supervising the Results Act and they are doing a worse job than almost anybody else in doing what the Results Act requires these agencies to do. That is not sustainable. One of the things we have looked at is this 1994 reorganization of OMB and the effect that has had. It shifted most of its management staff to the budget side. The reorganization eliminated most of the OMB positions dedicated to management and integrated them into the budget side, the theory there being that management issues would carry more weight if integrated with funding decisions. In practice, however, budget issues crowded out management issues. Now you have certain people in Congress suggesting that we ought to have a separate office of management, outside of OMB. So we are still reshuffling the chairs and organizational charts. Have you had a chance to look at all of that and come to an opinion, if not a conclusion, as to what we ought to do in terms of either reorganization or ensuring that the management side of the equation gets its due deference? Mr. Daniels. First, I have had a look and I have formulated what I reserve the right to call a preliminary view, and that is this is not an issue of structure. It may be an issue of resources. It certainly is an issue of management attention, that is, OMB management attention and follow-through. At least on the surface, prior to an opportunity to sort of count heads and, more importantly, assess talent levels. The 1994 reorganization of the outgoing administration makes good common sense to me. Ideally, the authority vested in OMB to organize the President's budget, and negotiate it with the agencies and departments, offers the greater potential when unified with the management responsibility for driving through the necessary changes. At least up to this point, the least-promising idea I have seen would be to completely separate management and have it as a free-floating responsibility of an organization that might or might not have the clout and everyday contact with the agencies to get things done. My going-in attitude is that we need to make sure that the resources are there, that the talent levels are there and certainly that the attention is there. I do believe that it is not acceptable for this organization or the government, in its entirety, or the Executive Branch in its entirety, to be in default on so many counts, as apparently is the case today, across the range of this legislation that you have enacted here. I come across areas where reports have not been filed, where action has not been taken, therefore where the results you seek have not been achieved. I have a business customer who taught me the rule that if you are not keeping score, you are just practicing, and that is a pretty good rule. I'm careful not to too loosely analogize business and government, but there are respects in which I think the analogy is a good one, and that is one. Senator Thompson. I appreciate that. I think my time is up. Chairman Lieberman. Thank you, Senator Thompson. Senator Carper. Senator Carper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me follow up, if I could, on a couple of things that I mentioned in my opening statement, as well. Could we talk a bit about revenue forecasts over the next 10 years or so? I had asked a member of my staff to bring and to share with me a list of tax expenditures or tax credits that are expiring or have expired. The revenue assumptions prepared by CBO and OMB, I believe do not assume that these expired or expiring tax credits will be restored or extended, and if you look through this list, my guess is most of them will be. I think there is pretty broad support for extending them. There are some related concerns with the alternative minimum tax, that if we don't change the current law, then a lot of folks who are really middle-income families, and not much higher than that, are going to end up being caught up in the alternative minimum tax. Just share with me some thoughts you have about how much we keep in mind those expired or expiring tax credits and what we might need to do with the alternative minimum tax, and how that plays back against the revenue forecasts that we are going to be building our budgets on. Mr. Daniels. I think the answer comes at two levels, in terms of a baseline, and that is what you are probably reacting to, various baseline forecasts. They are not meant to be predictive of eventual outcomes. They are only a starting point, as we know, for making policy decisions, whether that is the renewal of existing tax advantages or spending programs, many of which are equally popular, but are not necessarily assumed in the baselines we use. I think that at a second level, the very practical political level to which you have directed our attention, we cannot take our eye off that ball. The President-elect's tax package at least partially responds to this by incorporating some, but not all of those expirations to which you allude, and partially, but not entirely, to the AMT issue. It is one we will have to work on together. Beyond that, I think it would be premature for me to comment about the eventual revenue forecast we will be making. Senator Carper. I hope this is a fair question, but have you had an opportunity to look at the budget surplus forecast prepared by OMB, the most recent, and by CBO? Are you familiar with those? Mr. Daniels. Yes, to an extent. Senator Carper. Could you just take a minute and share with me what you know, just in broad terms, of what the surplus is expected to be in either or both instances? Mr. Daniels. The difference, as you will have noted, is from just south of $5 trillion to just above $5.5 trillion aggregate surpluses over 10 years. These are very large numbers, although not so large in a 10-year context. I am struck less by the size of the differences than by the degree of general consensus in terms of the end point of these numbers and also the assumptions underlying them. The range of differences, certainly on economics, is narrower than we have often seen in the past. It does not mean they are right. They could all be wrong, but I think it gives us a reasonable basis for starting out the construction of a new budget, since the disparities between these various starting points are relatively modest. I do not know, after we have worked on the new OMB forecast, where they will fit, but I suspect they will fit in and around that range. Senator Carper. Those $5 trillion figures, do they include revenue inflows into and expenditures from the Social Security- Medicare trust funds? Mr. Daniels. I am sorry. Again? Senator Carper. Are those revenues, the budget surpluses, inclusive of inflows and outflows from the Social Security and the Medicare trust funds? Mr. Daniels. Yes, I believe they are. Senator Carper. If we back those out, and they are rather substantial, do you recall what we are left with? Mr. Daniels. Somewhat greater than half would be in the so- called on-budget accounts and somewhat approaching half in the Social Security accounts. Senator Carper. I am a boomer. I was born in 1947, 54 years ago next Tuesday. And in recognition of that, I have been assigned to, among other committees, not only this one, but the Aging Committee. Among a lot of us in my generation are going to be retiring and drawing down on Social Security roughly in 10 years, and how will that affect those surplus numbers beyond this 10-year period of time and should we be mindful of that? Mr. Daniels. We should be more than mindful, Senator. When I think about this rather new era that we have entered, of large surpluses, I think of it as a window of opportunity which, if seized, can enable us to deal with the problems to which you are just drawing our attention, and if passed, will make addressing them a much more painful and severe process. As we all know, reform done early, certainly in the entitlements area, can be much more moderate and much less difficult than reform done at the eleventh hour. Now, our process has not always been known for long-term statesmanship and for acting before the wolf is at the door, and yet I hope, particularly presented with the opportunity of these large, impending surpluses, whether they are closer to five or closer to six or even somewhat lower than either number, I hope that we will find ways to work together to bring reform to the programs on which our generation will depend, and that would be a salutary accomplishment for all concerned. Senator Carper. One last question before my time expires. I hope we will be mindful as we go forward that, again, we need to show great caution about supporting substantial tax cuts, and I am going to support a number of tax cuts. I think we ought to return some of the money to the taxpayers. We need to be mindful of supporting tax cuts which kick in largely at the end of this 10-year period, at the same period of time when a lot of folks in our country are going to be retiring and drawing down on Social Security and Medicare. I would ask us to continue to be mindful that we probably have not seen the re-invention of the business cycle or the economic cycle. There will probably be downturns. We have been lucky for 8 or 9 years. For us to assume we are not going to have a recession for another 10 years may be the triumph of man's hope over experience. Last point, Senator Voinovich and I have served the National Governors Association, led it for a period of time. One of the entities we established within the National Governors Association to help governors be better managers was something called the Center for Best Practices, which I believe he chaired and which I chaired, as well. One of the great things about the National Governors Association is it really exists as an entity not just to lobby the Congress and so forth, but to enable us to identify what is working, to solve our problems in our various States and to enable us to steal those best ideas. Too often, it seems to me that Federal agencies exist to issue rules and regulations, but not so often to share ideas of what is working. As you go forward on the management side of your quest here, as others have spoken to earlier, you may want to keep in mind how we share best practices amongst governors and to see if perhaps the Federal agencies could not some how encourage that as well at the Federal level. Mr. Daniels. I appreciate that advice very much, Senator, and my interest in doing that is not conditional. It is clear to me that the ties between OMB and the new administration in general, and the State and local officials of this country should be much tighter than they may have been recently, and better management practices is a good place to start, but I am a Federalist, and I think we have seen a great reinvigoration of State Government, and also local government, over the last couple of decades. You were a leader and a participant in that. I think that, on a host of fronts, we will be well advised to consult very carefully and I plan to do so on a regular basis, with the National Governors Association and with like organizations, to make sure that, in all the ways in which we interact, in all the ways in which our fiscal policies are tied to each other, as well as the management successes that are happening there in the famous laboratories of democracy, are learned about and are brought home to the benefit of the Federal Government and Federal taxpayers. Senator Carper. Thanks very much. Chairman Lieberman. Thanks, Senator Carper. Thanks, Mr. Daniels. Senator Voinovich. Senator Voinovich. I can testify that you are a Federalist. I was President of the National League of Cities, and working with you as Mayor of the city of Cleveland, there is no question about it, and I am glad to hear you reaffirm your commitment to that. I would like to build on the questions that Senator Carper mentioned, the baby boomers. We talk about the 10-year budget surplus and, by the way, one of the Senators pointed out that the end of that 10-year period is 2 years after President Bush will leave office. Also at the end of that 10-year period is the baby boomers. We talk about global warming. I think we need to talk about global aging. It seems to me that any of the decisions that we make about our financial decisions ought to also have that in the backdrop of that decision-making, because 1 day we are going to have to pay the piper, and too often in this government we have not done that. Second, the projections--there is going to be a lot of debate about the projections, and I think Senator Carper mentioned the assumptions that some of the tax benefits that we have will go off. I do not think they will. I think most of them are pretty good. We will extend them, and that will change the number. You talked about the surplus in Medicare Part B. As you know, supposedly the Social Security surplus is not included and we have taken care of that, but the fact is the budget projections also include on the on-budget surplus Part A of Medicare, I think that, from a fiscal point of view, they ought to be taken off the table in calculating your on-budget surplus. You get the issue of growth in the economy, spending. There are certain presumptions about spending and I can tell from the last couple of years around here, God help us if we do not have a President that shows some restraint about spending. So all of those things, I think, are things you are going to have to contend with, because we will be debating those assumptions and those projections. Also, something maybe you have not thought about, but we do have a $98 billion projected surplus for the 2001 budget. I heard Senator Stevens say he is coming over to see you, and I can assure you that you will get some supplementary appropriations bill suggested to you. Right now, we have already spent 12 percent more in the 2001 budget for non- defense discretionary spending and 8 percent more for discretionary spending than last year. Any new supplemental spending is going to add to that percentage increase, and so you are going to have a battle with that. On the other side of the coin, I think you better look at the projections in this budget in terms of Medicare and Medicaid spending. When I became Governor of Ohio, Medicaid was the Pac Man in State Government, eating away at education, secondary and primary, and other State spending. We brought it under control, and the reform of the welfare system has helped us. In fact, in 1997, we spent less money on Medicaid than we did the year before, but last year, and Ohio is in a crisis in terms of Medicaid, 15-percent increase in Medicaid spending last year. I do not know what the projections were in this 2001 budget, but the Federal Government has benefited from what the States have done, and now we are a 60-40 State. So you pick up 60 percent of that Medicaid spending. I am saying there are some things right now that need to be looked at, and we have this tendency to just use these big numbers and forget about the details, and I think that is a real problem. The last thing is--in response to a question in your pre- hearing questionnaire--you said that you planned, ``To make sure we retain and hire quality people at OMB and ensure they have the necessary resources to meet their responsibilities.'' As you will find, I think this is going to be easier said than done. Many talented young people view the Federal Government as an employer of last resort, and agencies across the government are finding it very difficult to attract the best and brightest people. The question I have is how you are going to accomplish your goal of hiring and retaining high-quality personnel at OMB, and then beyond that how are you going to deal with some the problems that other agencies are going to be having in the Federal Government, as we talked about in the report that we gave the President, ``The Crisis in Human Capital.'' GAO has also designated human capital management as a high-risk area. I would like to know your thoughts on it, and as Senator Thompson was asking, how do you manage that? Are you going to have a management czar? How are you going to make sure you do not get so involved in the budget side of this that management is neglected, as it has been for so many years around here? Mr. Daniels. All very fair questions. First of all, with regard to quality at OMB, and I do not for a moment want to underestimate the challenges we may have, I do suspect OMB may prove to be the exception that proves the rule. It is a place full of tremendously talented people today. I suspect they are there and that their successors can be recruited for reasons often mentioned at this hearing, the opportunity for service, a real service there, across the range of the budget, management, and regulatory policy, I hope will continue to excite and attract the top talent. That has certainly been the case in the past. It was my observation in my previous tour of duty and it is my impression in these few short days back in town that OMB is fortunate enough to reflect the highest standards of public service and the highest ethic of public service. That said, if it is true, I recognize we may be uniquely graced there, and everything I have read in your report on the human capital problem tells me there is not a moment to lose in trying to coordinate progress across the rest of the government. Moved by your words and this Committee's work, I added to my schedule of visits last week a lengthy visit over at GAO with David Walker. I plan to make that a very tight partnership. As far as I am concerned, their work, like your Committee's work, provides us with marching orders. I have told my potential colleagues-to-be we have got our hands full, but one problem we do not have is figuring out what to do. A roadmap has been laid out for us and our initial challenge will be deciding where to start. I thank you for your cautions on the spending side. I already have detected most of the visitors I receive are not there to help me get the $98 billion figure up into three digits, that they are probably interested in using some of it to some good purpose. We like to say in Indiana, I was born at night, but not last night. Last, I, for one, believe that we ought to take an open stance, at least temporarily, on this whole matter of a supplemental, which you mentioned. This may again be sort of a newcomer's prerogative, but I hope that in some respects, and this may be a bad example, that as the new kid in town I will have the privilege for a little while to ask exactly why do we do things this way. One of the few instances I could give is the notion that before the ink is even dry on the budget just written, that we have suddenly discovered a lot of other things that have to be addressed in a supplemental appropriation bill. I recognize that events can intervene and there may be new needs, but I, for one, hope that we will at least ask this as a new question each time, not allow it to become, as it may have, sort of an annual rite of spring. Senator Voinovich. Thank you. Chairman Lieberman. Thanks, Senator Voinovich. Senator Levin. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEVIN Senator Levin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, let me add my congratulations to you on your appointment. Thank you for your willingness to serve again in government, and thank your family for their support of you again coming back into really one of the most difficult jobs that there is in government, to both spend the right amount of money and spend it wisely, the budget side and the management side both equally important. There is nothing more important at OMB than to tell it straight, no cookbooks, no shading, no politics in forecasting. OMB has done that recently. Your compliment of Jack Lew, by the way, your very gracious compliment of him in your opening statement is very much appreciated and is offered in the most bipartisan of spirits, and that is also appreciated. I have a couple of questions on the disclosure question that you answered in your answers to the preliminary questions that were submitted to you. When reviewing rules, the question is whether or not the public should know where that rule is being reviewed, and we had an experience at OMB many years ago where the office, the OMB, through its Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, was playing a major role in the regulatory process, but it was secret. Nobody knew it. No one knew when a regulation was going from an agency to OMB, and therefore it happened too often that people who had access to OMB, who were using that access, while people who had no access were not even aware of the fact that the rule was at OMB. I happen to think it is legitimate for OMB to have that role because I think we ought to hold elected officials, the President, accountable for regulations. I believe in that accountability, so I have supported the OMB role. But we worked out finally, during the Bush years and during the Clinton years, a process to make sure that was an open process. The key question, your response to the question for the record was that documents that flowed between the agency and the OMB should be made public, but you left out of your answer the question of whether or not the public should be made aware, as it is now, that a rule has been forwarded to OMB for its review, so that anybody who wanted to weigh in with OMB would have the opportunity to weigh in with you or OIRA. So my question is whether or not you would support the cont"
