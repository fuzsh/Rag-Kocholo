        "text": "Gov. Mitch Daniels to speak at IU Bloomington winter commencement\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nNov. 19, 2012\n\nBLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- Mitch Daniels, the 49th governor of the state of Indiana, will address graduates at Indiana University Bloomington's 2012 winter commencement on Dec. 15. The ceremony begins at 10 a.m. at Assembly Hall.\n\nDaniels will complete his second four-year term as governor in January 2013. At that time, he will begin serving as president of Purdue University.\n\n\"It is a great honor for Indiana University to have Gov. Daniels as speaker for winter commencement,\" IU President Michael A. McRobbie said. \"As governor, he has successfully led Indiana through the worst fiscal crisis this nation has known for 80 years while doing much for the economic development of the state. He has had a very distinguished career in the public and private sector, and as he comes to the end of his term as a popular and respected governor, we are very pleased to be able to honor him by having him as our winter commencement speaker.\"\n\nDaniels was elected governor of Indiana in 2004 and re-elected in 2008, receiving more votes than any candidate for public office in the state's history. Before his election to governor, Daniels held top management positions in both the public and private sectors. He previously served as director of the White House Office of Management and Budget for President George W. Bush, chief of staff for Sen. Richard Lugar, senior adviser to President Ronald Reagan, CEO of the Hudson Institute and president of North American Pharmaceutical Operations for Eli Lilly and Co.\n\n\"I am deeply honored to be included in an IU commencement,\" Daniels said. \"The university's contributions to our state and to the successful lives of its graduates have never been greater than today, and I will try to speak for all Hoosiers who are rightly proud of these young men and women and the great school they so wisely chose.\"\n\nAs governor, Daniels led Indiana to its first balanced budget in eight years, and the state has maintained a budget surplus for eight consecutive years. Due to the governor's fiscal leadership, Indiana was awarded an AAA credit rating for the first time in history.\n\nDaniels created the public-private Indiana Economic Development Corp. to attract jobs, established the state Office of Management and Budget, and spearheaded reforms aimed at improving the performance of state government. His innovations include the 2006 lease of the Indiana Toll Road, enactment of the Healthy Indiana Plan to provide health care coverage for uninsured adults and a sweeping property tax reform in 2008. He has received numerous state and national awards for leadership in education, budget and tax policy and conservation, and was widely mentioned as a prospective 2012 candidate for president.\n\nDaniels earned a bachelor's degree from Princeton University and a law degree from Georgetown University, and he has received eight honorary degrees, including degrees from Butler University, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and Wabash College. He is the author of two books, \"Keeping the Republic: Saving America by Trusting Americans\" and \"Notes From the Road.\" He and his wife, Cheri, have four daughters and two grandchildren.\n\nWinter commencement is open to all students who complete degree requirements between September and December 2012. Just over 2,000 students are eligible to participate. Degrees awarded include 1,381 bachelor's degrees, 587 master's degrees and 115 research doctoral degrees. More information about December 2012 graduates and degrees is available online.\n\nDoors to Assembly Hall will open at 8 a.m. Dec. 15. There are no reserved seats, but people with special needs or who need accessibility seating and parking should call University Ceremonies at 812-855-3762.\n\nCandidates should report to Gladstein Fieldhouse in time to line up for the processional, which will start at 8:45 a.m. Graduates will receive degrees in the presence of friends and family members. Ph.D. candidates will be hooded, and other degree candidates will be introduced by school.\n\nNew graduates will be formally inducted into the IU Alumni Association, with graduating senior Brent Rasche representing the class during the induction. A member of the Board of Trustees will represent the university, and IU Alumni Association chairwoman Nancy Hamblin will represent the IUAA. The Rev. Linda C. Johnson, the Episcopal chaplain to Indiana University and the president of the IU Campus Religious Leaders Association, will offer the invocation following the processional."
