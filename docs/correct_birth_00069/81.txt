Put on your walking shoes and visit some of the places and spaces that shaped the lives of two of Dublin’s most iconic literary figures, Oscar Wilde and Bram Stoker.

Led by Wilde’s Women author Eleanor Fitzsimons, this guided tour through Dublin city centre will shine a light on the connections between Wilde and Stoker and take you to some of the most historic spots in the city. A true Dubliner, Oscar Wilde was born at 21 Westland Row and spent his childhood at 1 Merrion Square. His parents’ notoriety ensured that he mixed with the most interesting people living in or passing through the city. Although he left for Oxford University in 1874 and never lived here again, he retained strong links to the city of his birth.

Bram Stoker was born in Clontarf but moved into the city centre when he was 11. Both were undergraduates at Trinity College Dublin. Bram knew the Wilde family well and spent Christmas with them in 1875. Relations were harmonious until he married Oscar’s girlfriend in 1878.

On this 90-minute walk, we’ll visit some of the most famous locations associated with two of Ireland’s literary greats, ending at the memorial statue where Wilde gazes across towards his former home on Merrion Square, where Stoker was a regular visitor.

Eleanor Fitzsimons is the honorary patron of the Oscar Wilde Society and author of Wilde’s Women.
