        "text": "On November 30, 1900, Oscar Wilde died at age 46, while staying in the Hotel d’Alsace in Paris. Autopsy reports at the time claimed the culprit to be cerebral meningitis, which most associated with syphilis. It is believed (though this is perhaps more legend than truth, as it is likely the following was said several weeks before his death) that his last words were, “My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One or the other of us has to go.” Wilde, unfortunately, was the first to go.\n\n(Sidenote: Hotel d’Alsace, now known as simply L’Hotel, has since completely stripped the room of the offending wallpaper, and performed a total overhaul of the interior, remodeling it after Wilde’s London flat. This reproduction is pictured below.)\n\nWilde is someone I will always have at the top of my “Who Would You Have A Drink With, Dead or Alive?” list. I find him fascinating; he seems to exude this persona that is, in a word, utterly Fabulous. With a capital “F.”\n\nBorn Oscar Fingal O’Flahertie Wills Wilde on October 16, 1854, to minor Irish nobility, Wilde grew up to be one of the most celebrated personalities of the Victorian era. In fact, he was by all accounts a “celebrity” of his day and age– public interest in his life was much like that of any A-list star, today (though, with admittedly less paparazzi). However, Wilde’s fame was not distilled from merely his success as a writer (The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Importance of Being Earnest), but rather, most of his fame resulted from the seedy stories of his incredibly lascivious personal life.\n\nWilde, by all accounts, was the epitome of what it means to be a “dandy” (what we modern-folk might call a “metrosexual”). He was almost always well-coifed (as is evident in the above photograph) and was purportedly fond of peacock feathers, lavish costumes, and absinthe. He trolled through the bars of London and Paris, rubbed elbows with other Bohemian artists, and was notorious for his many affairs. Though married at age 30, Wilde took several male lovers over the course of his (short) lifetime. Robert Ross, a Canadian journalist and art critic, was perhaps his most famous affair. In fact, Ross’s ashes are currently enshrined in Wilde’s tomb. In 1894, due to public “moral” outrage, Wilde was convicted for being a “Sodomite” and was imprisoned for three years. He spent most of his incarceration at hard-labor camps throughout Britian, which wore down on Wilde physically, but which could not compromise his dandyish sensibilities.\n\nOnce released in 1897, Wilde refused to return to his home in London. Instead, he took up various hotel rooms in Paris, which were paid for by his estranged wife (who refused to reunite with him) as Wilde was completely penniless. While in Paris, Wilde induldged in every excess he was denied in Britian: alcohol and young men were his vices of choice. His drug of choice, however, was (once again) absinthe. Wilde was a fixture at the bars of Paris, where his unbridled consumption of absinthe (and therefore wormwood) was most likely the greatest contributor to his wild mood swings and deeply depressive emotional state. Battered, though perhaps not broken, Wilde finally met his end 109 years ago, on this very day."
