        "text": "Oscar Wilde\n\nIrish author\n\nTop Questions\n\nWhat is Oscar Wilde known for?\n\nOscar Wilde’s literary reputation rests largely on his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891) and on his masterful comedies of manners Lady Windermere’s Fan (1892) and The Importance of Being Earnest (1895). He was also known for his wit, his flamboyance, and his trials and jail sentence for homosexual acts.\n\nHow did Oscar Wilde become famous?\n\nOscar Wilde came from a prominent family. While studying at Oxford in the 1870s, he gained notice as a scholar, poseur, wit, and poet and for his devotion to the Aesthetic movement, which held that art should exist for its beauty alone. Wilde later established himself in London’s social and artistic circles.\n\nHow did Oscar Wilde die?\n\nAfter his release from prison in 1897, Oscar Wilde lived in France in straitened circumstances. In 1900 at the age of 46, he died of meningitis following an acute ear infection.\n\nOscar Wilde (born October 16, 1854, Dublin, Ireland—died November 30, 1900, Paris, France) was an Irish wit, poet, and dramatist whose enduring fame rests on his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891), and on his comic masterpieces Lady Windermere’s Fan (1892) and The Importance of Being Earnest (1895). In his comedies he proved himself to be a master of the epigram. He was a spokesman for the late 19th-century Aesthetic movement in England, which advocated art for art’s sake, and he was the object of notorious civil and criminal suits involving homosexuality and ending in his imprisonment (1895–97). Despite his fall from society’s grace at the end of his life, Wilde came to be regarded as the personification of wit and sophistication.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nWilde was born of professional and literary parents. His father, William Wilde, was Ireland’s leading ear and eye surgeon, who also published books on archaeology, folklore, and the satirist Jonathan Swift. His mother, Jane Francesca Wilde (née Elgee), was a nationalist poet and an authority on Celtic myth and folklore who wrote under the name Speranza. Wilde was one of three children. His elder brother, Willie, became a journalist, and his younger sister, Isola, died of a fever when she was 10. As a child, Wilde was baptized a Roman Catholic at his mother’s behest, despite his family’s affiliation with the Anglican church; presumably, this act signified his mother’s rejection of the Protestant landlord class and its values, since Wilde received no further education in the Catholic faith.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nA Study of Poetry\n\nAfter attending Portora Royal School in Enniskillen (1864–71), Wilde went, on successive scholarships, to Trinity College Dublin (1871–74) and Magdalen College, Oxford (1874–78), which awarded him a degree with honors. During these four years, he distinguished himself not only as a Classical scholar, a poseur, and a wit but also as a poet by winning the coveted Newdigate Prize in 1878 with a long poem, Ravenna. He was deeply impressed by the teachings of the English writers John Ruskin and Walter Pater on the central importance of art in life and particularly by the latter’s stress on the aesthetic intensity by which life should be lived. Like many in his generation, Wilde was determined to follow Pater’s urging “to burn always with [a] hard, gemlike flame.” But Wilde also delighted in affecting an aesthetic pose; this, combined with rooms at Oxford decorated with objets d’art, resulted in his famous remark, “Oh, would that I could live up to my blue china!”\n\nAestheticism, early writings, and marriage\n\nIn the early 1880s, when Aestheticism was the rage and despair of literary London, Wilde established himself in social and artistic circles by his wit and flamboyance. Soon the periodical Punch made him the satiric object of its antagonism to the Aesthetes for what was considered their unmasculine devotion to art. And in their comic opera Patience, Gilbert and Sullivan based the character Bunthorne, a “fleshly poet,” partly on Wilde. Wishing to reinforce the association, Wilde published, at his own expense, Poems (1881), which echoed, too faithfully, his discipleship to the poets Algernon Swinburne, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and John Keats. Eager for further acclaim, Wilde agreed to lecture in the United States and Canada in 1882, announcing on his arrival at customs in New York City that he had “nothing to declare but my genius.” Despite widespread hostility in the press to his languid poses and aesthetic costume of velvet jacket, knee breeches, and black silk stockings, Wilde for 12 months exhorted the Americans to love beauty and art; then he returned to Great Britain to lecture on his impressions of America.\n\nIn 1884 Wilde married Constance Lloyd, daughter of a prominent Irish barrister; two sons, Cyril and Vyvyan, were born, in 1885 and 1886, respectively. Meanwhile, Wilde was a reviewer for the Pall Mall Gazette and then became editor of Woman’s World (1887–89). During this period of apprenticeship as a writer, he published The Happy Prince and Other Tales (1888), which reveals his gift for romantic allegory in the form of the fairy tale.\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray\n\n“No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.” —Oscar Wilde, preface to The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891)\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nIn the final decade of his life Wilde wrote and published nearly all of his major work. In his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (published in Lippincott’s Magazine in 1890 and in book form, revised and expanded by six chapters, in 1891), Wilde combined the supernatural elements of the Gothic novel with the unspeakable sins of French Decadent fiction. The novel tells the story of an extraordinarily beautiful young man, Dorian Gray, who is taken under the wing of an older, amoral man, Lord Henry Wotton. Entranced by Henry’s views on art and sensuality, Dorian wishes to remain as young and handsome as a portrait of himself painted by another admirer, Basil Hallward. In time, the portrait changes and becomes hideous to reflect all of Dorian’s sins and moral failings while the flesh-and-blood Dorian remains entirely unchanged in appearance. Critics charged immorality despite Dorian’s self-destruction; Wilde, however, insisted on the amoral nature of art regardless of the novel’s apparently moral ending.\n\nIntentions (1891), a collection of previously published essays, restated his aesthetic attitude toward art by borrowing ideas from the French poets Théophile Gautier and Charles Baudelaire and the American painter James McNeill Whistler. In the same year two volumes of stories and fairy tales also appeared, testifying to Wilde’s extraordinary creative inventiveness: Lord Arthur Savile’s Crime, and Other Stories and A House of Pomegranates.\n\nPlays and epigrams\n\nWilde’s greatest successes were his society comedies. Within the conventions of the French “well-made play” (with its social intrigues and artificial devices to resolve conflict), he employed his paradoxical, epigrammatic wit to create a form of comedy new to the 19th-century English theater. His first success, Lady Windermere’s Fan (1892), demonstrated that this wit could revitalize the rusty machinery of French drama.\n\nIn the same year rehearsals of his macabre play Salomé, written in French and designed, as he said, to make his audience shudder by its depiction of unnatural passion, were halted by the censor because of a law that prohibited plays containing biblical characters. (In the Bible, Salome is the daughter of Herodias and stepdaughter of Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee. At the instigation of her mother, she arranges for the execution of John the Baptist by asking for his head on a platter as a reward for her dance before Herod. In Wilde’s version Salome lusts after John the Baptist and plots his death after he spurns her. After he is killed, she kisses his severed head.) It was published in 1893, and an English translation appeared in 1894 with English artist Aubrey Beardsley’s celebrated illustrations.\n\nA second society comedy, A Woman of No Importance (produced 1893), convinced the critic William Archer that Wilde’s plays “must be taken on the very highest plane of modern English drama.” In rapid succession, Wilde’s final plays, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, were produced early in 1895. In the latter, his greatest achievement, the conventional elements of farce are transformed into satiric epigrams—seemingly trivial but mercilessly exposing Victorian hypocrisies.\n\nI suppose society is wonderfully delightful. To be in it is merely a bore. But to be out of it simply a tragedy.\n\nI never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read in the train.\n\nAll women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That’s his.\n\nI hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would be hypocrisy.\n\nRelationship with Lord Alfred Douglas and trials for gross indecency\n\n“I myself would sacrifice everything for a new experience, and I know there is no such thing as a new experience at all.” —Oscar Wilde, from a letter to a friend, 1885\n\nIn many of his works, exposure of a secret sin or indiscretion and consequent disgrace is a central design. If life imitated art, as Wilde insisted in his essay “The Decay of Lying” (1889), he was himself approximating the pattern in his reckless pursuit of pleasure—or, as Wilde’s grandson, Merlin Holland, characterized it, “a Faustian thirst for experience.” About the time of his son Vyvyan’s birth, Wilde began a sexual relationship with a friend, Canadian journalist and art critic Robert Ross. It was the first in a series of secret affairs that he had with other men, culminating in his close and tempestuous friendship with Lord Alfred (“Bosie”) Douglas, whom he had met in 1891 and who was 16 years younger than Wilde. Their relationship infuriated the marquess of Queensberry, Douglas’s father, a violent-tempered man whom Douglas despised. Accused by the marquess of being a sodomite, Wilde, urged by Douglas, sued the marquess for criminal libel.\n\nThe case went to trial in April 1895. Wilde’s case collapsed within three days, however, when the evidence went against him. His writings were called into question, particularly The Picture of Dorian Gray and its homoerotic themes, and it was revealed that Wilde had solicited the services of male sex workers (albeit initially at Douglas’s urging). Wilde dropped the suit, but the evidence made him vulnerable to arrest for having violated Britain’s Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885, which criminalized sex acts between men (though not between women). Urged to flee to France (where homosexuality was legal) by his friends, Wilde refused, unable to believe that his world was at an end. He was arrested and ordered to stand trial for acts of gross indecency.\n\nWilde testified brilliantly, drawing applause (and some hisses) after giving an eloquent speech about “the love that dare not speak its name,” an expression in Douglas’s poem “Two Loves.” Interpreting it as a coy reference to homosexuality, the prosecution demanded that Wilde explain its meaning. He characterized it, in part, as “a great affection of an elder for a younger man…such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy, and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare. It is that deep, spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect.” But the jury failed to reach a verdict. In the retrial he was found guilty and sentenced, in May 1895, to two years at hard labor.\n\nImprisonment and De Profundis\n\n“To regret one’s own experiences is to arrest one’s own development. To deny one’s own experiences is to put a lie into the lips of one’s own life. It is no less than a denial of the soul.” —Oscar Wilde, from De Profundis (1905)\n\nMost of his sentence was served at Reading Gaol, where he wrote a long letter to Douglas (published in 1905 in a drastically cut version as De Profundis) filled with recriminations against the younger man for encouraging him in dissipation and distracting him from his work. Yet the letter also expressed Wilde’s spirituality, with elegant ruminations on suffering, repentance, and “the true life of Christ and the true life of the artist.”\n\nTo avoid scandal Constance Wilde moved to the European continent and changed the family’s surname to Holland. They corresponded often through letters, however, and she visited him once in prison after the death of his mother in 1896. She died in Genoa, Italy, in 1898, several days after a botched operation that was meant to resolve a uterine tumor. (Contemporary medical experts believe that she was misdiagnosed and in fact had multiple sclerosis.)\n\nThe Ballad of Reading Gaol and death\n\nOscar Wilde’s final resting place\n\nWilde is one of several famous artists buried in Père-Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Read about this celebrated resting ground and eight other “cemeteries to die for.”\n\nIn May 1897 Wilde was released from prison, a bankrupt, and immediately went to France, hoping to regenerate himself as a writer. His only remaining work, however, was The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898), revealing his concern for inhumane prison conditions. Despite constant money problems, he maintained, as George Bernard Shaw said, “an unconquerable gaiety of soul” that sustained him, and he was visited by such loyal friends as Max Beerbohm and Robert Ross, who would become his literary executor; he was also reunited with Douglas. Wilde died suddenly of acute meningitis brought on by an ear infection. In his semiconscious final moments, he was received into the Roman Catholic Church, which he had long admired.\n\nIn January 2017 Wilde was among 50,000 men who were posthumously pardoned under the Turing Law (named for British mathematician and logician Alan Turing, who was convicted of gross indecency in 1952). The law was introduced to exonerate individuals who had been unjustly convicted of homosexual crimes that no longer exist.\n\nKarl Beckson"
