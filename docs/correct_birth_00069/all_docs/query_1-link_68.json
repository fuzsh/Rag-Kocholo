        "text": "He was born in Dublin on 16th October. The ‘Wills’ part of his name was adopted later by the male members of the family. Wilde did well at school, but apparently hated it and may have struggled with his Irish middle names and heritage. He read out the poem, Ravenna, to an audience in the Sheldonian Theatre, and it was later his first book to be published. At the time, Wilde was working as editor of The Woman’s World magazine. It was first published as a shorter novella in a monthly magazine, and the text was later revised. Following his release, he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol about the fate of a fellow inmate. The couple had been lived apart since his release from prison, and she had changed her surname to Holland, but she had chosen not to divorce him. By this stage, Wilde had lost all interest in the play, and the original four-act version was not published until 1956."
