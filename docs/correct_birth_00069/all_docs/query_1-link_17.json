        "text": "Wilde is also known as a remarkable essayist and a children's book author. Perhaps the most long-lasting and widely popular aspect of his legacy is his much-quoted razor-sharp witticisms. So, let's explore some ideas and facts about Oscar Wilde's life and works as a writer who remains as extraordinary today as he was in the 19th century.\n\nA witticism is a comment or remark that is both insightful and humorous.\n\nOscar Wilde: biography\n\nOscar Wilde BiographyBirth:16th October 1854Death:30th November 1900Father:Sir William WildeMother:Jane (née Elgee)Spouse/Partners:Constance Lloyd (1884-1898)Children:2Famous Works:\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray\n\nThe Importance of Being Earnest\n\nNationality:IrishLiterary Period:Victorian, Aestheticism, Decadent\n\nLet's start with Wilde's biography. Oscar Wilde was born on 25 October 1854 in Dublin, Ireland. His father was a famous doctor named William Wilde who was knighted for his contribution to medicine and the creation of St. Mark's Ophthalmic Hospital for treating the poor.\n\nHis mother, Jane Francesca Elgee, was a politically active poet known for her English translation of Wilhelm Meinhold's Sidonia the Sorceress (1849). This was the story of the Pomeranian legend of Lady Canoness of Pomerania, Sidonia von Bor (1548–1620), who was tried and executed for witchcraft.\n\nA preternaturally intelligent child, Wilde excelled at the classics from a young age. Wilde's ability in Greek and Roman studies won him the top place for classics at the Portora Royal School. As well as winning school prizes for art, he was awarded a scholarship to attend Trinity College Dublin upon his graduation in 1871.\n\nAt Trinity, Wilde excelled once again and was awarded the Foundation Scholarship in 1872. Not stopping there, he added the Berkley Gold medal for best Greek student in his final year 1874 and also the Demyship scholarship for further studies at Magdelena College, Oxford.\n\nWilde transformed himself from a reportedly 'awkward and uncouth'1 character into what a Balliol College don described as:\n\nA brilliantly clever scholar, who had strangely good taste in art and humanity.\n\nHaving the advantage of a three-year degree in classics already, Wilde took the time to develop his social skills, make a name for himself, and begin his creative writing career. His first poem, 'Ravenna', (1878) won him Oxford's Newdigate English Verse Prize and landed him in the prestigious company of past winners like Matthew Arnold, John Ruskin, and John Addington Symonds.\n\nStudent fame or notoriety was an important factor in life during the Victorian era at Oxford. For instance, Wilde's contemporary, Christian Cole, was from Sierra Leone and one of Oxford's first African graduates. He was part of the 'Great Gun' crowd and was enough of a celebrity to warrant diary entries by young women who spotted him at Oxford. Unfortunately, his history is largely unrecorded beyond this. Wilde established himself as a brilliant scholar and flamboyant dresser who hosted soirees.\n\nIn his traditionally witty way, Wilde described Oxford as:\n\nA place where one can be, simultaneously, brilliant and unreasonable.\n\nWhatever he had to say, he graduated with a double first, and the Prize helped to launch his career as an up and coming writer.\n\nAfter the publication of his first collection, Poems (1881), Wilde went on several American and UK tours to establish himself as a leader of the Aesthetic movement on the lecture circuit.\n\nThe Aesthetic movement promoted art for art's sake, devoid of any social or political connotations. Self-standing beauty is considered the pinnacle of artistic practice in this movement. The movement began in the late 1800s and included artists like Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828 – 1882).\n\nOn 29 May 1884, Wilde married fellow author Constance Lloyd, who was known for her children's books and her short story collection, There Once Was (1888). They had two sons, Cyril, born in 1885, and Vyvyan, born in 1886. Wilde also had several homosexual relationships during his lifetime, including during his marriage.\n\nShortly after his marriage, Wilde became editor of the outmoded and failing Lady's World. During his two years there, he revolutionised the magazine by expanding the content to cover women's opinions on literature, art, and contemporary issues rather than merely focusing on what they should wear. When discussing these changes, Wilde said that:\n\nIt should be a magazine that men could read with pleasure.1\n\nOscar Wilde's death\n\nAlthough he built a successful career as a dramatist and author, Wilde died in exiled poverty on 30 November 1900 due to a 'gross indecency' conviction (a term often used to imprison homosexual people) in 1895.\n\nWhile in prison, Wilde collapsed from starvation and illness, which injured his ear. Upon his release in 1897, he died after becoming ill with meningitis which is believed to have been directly related to his prison injury.\n\nFig. 2 - Everything about Oscar Wilde's life\n\nOscar Wilde: famous books\n\nThe 1890s was a decade of extensive creative output that would see Wilde producing his most famous and long-lasting works. In 1888 he published his children's short stories, The Happy Prince and Other Tales.\n\nIn 1891, he published the acclaimed essay, 'Intentions'. This work set the stage for his approach to aestheticism and defined the tenets of the movement. In the same year, he published his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, which was received with much criticism and outcry.\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray (1891)\n\nOriginally published in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray had six additional chapters when it was published in book form. The novel tells the story of the protagonist, Dorian Gray, who leads a hedonistic, amoral, and self-indulgent life while his portrait withers and ages on his behalf.\n\nHedonism is an overindulgence in self-pleasing activities.\n\nThe novel caused much controversy when it was published. The English Victorian era was one of industrial revolution and materialism, but there was also a focus on religious morality. Wilde's novel was viewed as amoral and scandalous due to the homosexual content and Dorian's many unsavoury escapades, including the murder of artist Basil Hallward.\n\nHowever, it is also possible to read the book as a cautionary tale rather than an amoral one. Wilde does not glamourise Dorian's descent to murder in any way; he describes how grotesque the portrait becomes as it reflects Dorian's life, and the novel ends with Dorian's death and the restoration of the portrait.3\n\nWhat do you think about this novel? Do you think it presents a stance on morality? Why or why not?\n\nLady Windermere's Fan (1892)\n\nFirst staged in 1892, Lady Windermere's Fan is Oscar Wilde's most famous play. Set over four acts that occupy 24 hours, the play is both improbable and comedic. The main characters include Lord and Lady Windermere, with a cast of other members of the English upper classes. The fan is often seen as a symbol of the performative nature of female roles in society, but it takes on many different meanings in this play.\n\nIt has been argued that the play is also satirical and presents a subtle mockery of the English upper classes 'gender based double standards for respectable behaviour'.3 In the Victorian age, wealthy men were permitted to have extramarital affairs as long as they were discrete.\n\nOn the other hand, similar behaviour would have ruined a woman's reputation for good. However, Mrs Erlynne of Lady Windermere's Fan is not portrayed as a typical 'fallen woman' character, which has led to readings of implied social commentary in what is seemingly just an enjoyable, witty play.\n\nIn the Victorian era, a 'fallen woman' was a woman who had 'fallen from God's Grace' by behaving in ways deemed inappropriate for women at the time, especially concerning sexuality and sex outside of marriage.\n\nLady Windermere's Fan was a huge West End success, making Wilde wealthy and finally cementing his reputation as a relevant dramatist.\n\nDo you think that there are undercurrents of social commentary in Lady Windermere's Fan? Or is it just comedic art for art's sake?\n\nThe Importance of Being Earnest (1895)\n\nThe Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a satirical play set in London and Hertfordshire in England. The protagonist is John Worthing, who is known as 'Jack' by his country friends and 'Earnest' by his city crowd. Supporting characters include Algernon, Gwendolen, Cecilia and Lady Bracknell, who are all affected by John's double life.\n\nBroad themes include morality, hypocrisy, class, courtship and marriage. The use of the name Earnest is a pun, as 'Earnest' is not only a name but also an adjective that means 'serious' or, more specifically in this context, 'sincere'. Take a look at the title, The Importance of Being Earnest, to spot the wordplay. This pun sets the tone for much of the dialogue throughout the play, which also uses farce and melodrama to depict the world on its stage.4\n\nJohn's dual life means that he is not able to be sincere. Ultimately this ends badly, hence the title.\n\nFarce is a type of comedy that uses physicality, absurdity, miscommunication and ridiculous situations to convey humour.\n\nMelodrama is sensationalism. It uses dramatic situations to create entertainment.\n\nWhat do you think of puns? Do you think they can be a good way of revealing interesting meanings and connections? Why?\n\nOscar Wilde: quotes\n\nDorothy Parker wrote a witty poem about Oscar Wilde, saying that if anything funny is to be quoted, but no one knows where it came from, we can just assume that Wilde said it. Wilde is a much-quoted author, famous for his insight and wit. The topics of society, the human condition, and art are the thread that runs through many of his most quoted witticisms.\n\nTake a look below at some of the most famous quotes that have been attributed to Oscar Wilde. These are still relevant and in use today in many different contexts; in fact, you might even come across some of them being used as inspirational content on social media sites.\n\nHow do you interpret these quotes? Can you link their themes to his novels?\n\nLife imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life. — The Decay of Lying (1891)\n\nWilde suggests that real-life events and circumstances are often influenced and shaped by the representations of those same events and circumstances in art, such as in literature. This means that the images and narratives created in art can have a powerful impact on the way people understand and experience the world around them. Wilde thus argues that life is a form of imitation of the art that represents it, rather than the other way around.\n\nWe are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars. — Lady Windemere's Fan (1893)\n\nThis quote by Oscar Wilde's is a philosophical reflection on the human condition and the role of perspective. The 'gutter' refers to difficult and challenging situations that people face in life, while 'the stars' symbolize aspirations, hopes, and dreams.\n\nThe quote suggests that despite being in the same difficult circumstances, some people choose to maintain a positive outlook and focus on their aspirations, while others become overwhelmed and defeated by their challenges. The message is that the way we perceive our circumstances can have a significant impact on our ability to overcome them and reach our goals.\n\nAll Art is at once surface and symbol. — The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890)\n\nWilde's quote is a reflection on the dual nature of art. It suggests that all forms of art have two distinct components: the visual or tangible expression of art, and the deeper symbolic meaning or message. The surface of art is what is immediately noticeable and perceived, while the symbol refers to the underlying message, idea, or emotion that the artist is trying to convey.\n\nWilde's statement suggests that these two elements are intertwined and that the surface of art cannot be understood without considering its symbolic meaning and vice versa.\n\nAs long as war is regarded as wicked, it will always have its fascination. When it is looked upon as vulgar, it will cease to be popular. — The Critic as Artist (1891)\n\nThis quote represents Wilde's thoughts on the human fascination with war. Wilde suggests that as long as people view war as a thrilling and exciting event, it will continue to be popular and have a certain allure. However, if people begin to see war as a brutal and uncivilized act, it will lose its appeal and become less popular. The quote highlights the importance of societal attitudes and perceptions in shaping public opinion and popular culture.\n\nImportant facts about Oscar Wilde\n\nHere are some facts about Oscar Wilde and his life:\n\nAs a key proponent of the Aesthetic movement, Wilde embodied the ethos in his writing, lifestyle, and dress. His work can be read as 'art for art's sake,' but it can also be interpreted as more layered and subtly critical.\n\nWilde was a flamboyant figure in Victorian society and was known for his dandyism and unconventional style of dress.\n\nWilde was a lecturer and writer who toured America and gave lectures on aesthetics and the decorative arts.\n\nHe created two masterpieces of late Victorian literature in The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891) and his play The Importance of Being Earnest (1895). These works have had a lasting influence on novelists and dramatists up to today.\n\nHis novel and plays are reflective of his time and yet also progressive in their themes and content. Few authors of his age addressed homosexual themes, subtly promoted women's rights, or challenged accepted concepts of respectability in the witty and astute way that he did.\n\nOscar Wilde (1854-1900) - Key takeaways\n\nOscar Wilde was a key figure in the Aesthetic movement, which promoted art for art's sake. He lived from 1854-1900.\n\nDespite being married, Wilde's homosexuality was an open secret that eventually had him imprisoned.\n\nWilde's novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891), caused a scandal when it was published due to its amoral and homosexual content.\n\nWilde was an author, essayist, dramatist, and poet with famous works in each of these categories.\n\nWilde is known for his wit and flamboyant dress style, and many of his works are considered to have a place within the Western canon.\n\n1 Michèle Mendelssohn, 'When Oscar Came To Oxford'.
