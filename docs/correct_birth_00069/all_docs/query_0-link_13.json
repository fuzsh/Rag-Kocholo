        "text": "Oscar Wilde's Childhood home, 1 Merrion Square, Dublin. Oscar Wilde was born at 21 Westland Row, Dublin, on 16 October 1854, but his family moved here, to this prestigious address on the north side of Merrion Square, in the following year. The house needed six servants to help run it, and would become a hub of society life. Wilde's early biographer wrote:\n\nThere are many people still living in Dublin who remember No. 1 Merrion Square when it was the salon of the capital. On reception nights the crush of people in the drawing-rooms upstairs used to be so great that it was a familiar spectacle that of Lady Wilde elbowing her way through the crush and crying out, \"How ever am I to get through all these people.\" [Sherard 70]\n\nRelated Material\n\nEarly 20c photograph of the house\n\nEarly 20c photograph of Merrion Square\n\nHomes of Artists and Writers\n\nPhotographs and text by Jacqueline Banerjee.
