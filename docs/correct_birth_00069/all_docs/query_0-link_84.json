        "text": "The Oscar Wilde Statue is situated just inside the railings on Merrion Square. The statue faces across to Oscar Wilde’s birthplace – 1 Merrion Square which is now a museum to the great Dubliners life.\n\nThe statue was sculpted by Danny Osbourne and shows Oscar reclining on a granite rock from the Wicklow mountains. The torso is of green nephrite jade from British Columbia, Canada, and pink thulite from Norway. The legs are of Norwegian Blue Pearl granite with the shoes being black Indian charnockite and finished with bronze shoelace tips.\n\nThe visitor to the monument sees one side of Wilde when approaching and another when walking away. One is the witty Wilde who is most often remembered in popular culture, the other the “broken man” in the last years of his life. .\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThis is a running series called Our Dublin History – see the original post on Instagram below\n\n#ourdublinhistory\n\nAndrew Rooney\n\nDublin Whiskey Tours\n\nDublin Whiskey Tours © 2019\n\nWhy not book a tour with the real Irish whiskey experts – we provide you with knowledge of the culture, science and history of Irish whiskey in a fun and entertaining way. Its one of the best ways to experience Irish whiskey and Dublin city."
