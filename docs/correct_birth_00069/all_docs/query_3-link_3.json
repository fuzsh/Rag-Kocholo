        "text": "Before I get around to posting about my pre-Christmas trip to Paris, here’s a few Parisian related posts to get you in the mood.\n\nI’ve previously looked at places in Paris haunted by Hemingway, now I’m going to look at those where Oscar Wilde hung out.\n\nOscar Wilde died in Paris’s dingy, flea-ridden Hotel d’Alsace in November 1900, aged 46. The d’Alsace, located on the Rue des Beaux-Arts, was one of many cheap hotels Wilde lived in during the final 18 months of his life (another was the nearby Hôtel Louvre Marsollier, from which he was evicted for not paying his bill).\n\nBut much like the writer’s own reputation, both hotels have been restored since the writer’s passing though retracing his footsteps through the city can be a bittersweet experience. For Wilde, there were two versions of Paris. The one that showered him with praise as he rose to literary stardom, embracing him for his talent, wit and conversation, and the one in which he experienced personal and artistic collapse under self-imposed exile following a spell in a London prison.\n\nParis inspired Wilde from his first visit in 1874 when the then 20 year old visited the city with his beloved mother. To him, Paris was the “literary capital of the world.” Between 1883 and 1884, he spent several months at the Hotel Voltaire on the Rive Gauche (now the Hotel Quai Voltaire), accepting invitations to literary salons, dinner parties, and gallery openings.\n\nAmbitious and confident that he should be accomplished as a playwright, Wilde wrote two plays during this time though neither was successful, but the city had captured his heart.\n\nWilde honeymooned in Paris in 1884, settling into high society London life and becoming a father to two sons. He did not return to Paris until 1891, arriving just before the publication of his novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, which he hoped would establish him properly in the Parisian literary scene.\n\nHe spent several weeks hobnobbing with artists and immersing himself fully in the café culture, with several favourite haunts that are still operating today, such as the Grand Café Capucines near the Opera house and Café du Flore and Les Deux Magots on the Boulevard St Germain.\n\nIn the English language, Wilde’s star continued to rise as a playwright, with strings of successes such as Lady Windermere’s Fan (1892), A Woman of No Importance (1893), and An Ideal Husband (1894).\n\nBefore his prison term, his plays alone brought him today’s equivalent of a million pounds. But his abrupt downfall began on Valentine’s Day, 1895 when The Importance of Being Earnest premiered in London. That evening, the Marquess of Queensberry sent Wilde a card, on which he’d written:\n\nFor Oscar Wilde posing somdomite [sic].\n\nIt prompted Wilde’s disastrous libel suit against the Marquess, which landed Wilde in jail for homosexual acts, illegal at the time. The conviction cost him his wife, children, many friends, wealth and reputation.\n\nWilde’s Rehabilitation Through Art\n\nOn his release, facing poverty, uncertainty, and isolation, Wilde intended to build a quiet life in Berneval-le-Grand in Normandy. There, he wrote “The Ballad of Reading Gaol,” a poem that describes the brutality of the Victorian prison system, including the treatment of child prisoners, which would help bring reforms to the English criminal justice system.\n\nThe poem was published in February 1898 and he returned to Paris hopeful of rebuilding his literary standing and receiving the warm welcome of his friends.\n\nHe arrived in the city and spoke of writing a new play. He arranged for the publication of The Importance of Being Earnest and An Ideal Husband, making enormous revisions to the former in particular, but when these failed to stir any interest, Wilde was eviscerated. Although “Reading Gaol” sold very well and was even translated into French, it became clear that Wilde would never recover what he’d lost. He never wrote again.\n\nWilde’s Final Days and Restored Glory\n\nThe Paris of Wilde’s final years starkly contrasted with his pre-prison glory days and he gave up all pretence of producing new work.\n\nDepression and loneliness plagued Wilde. He dreaded being alone. He was occasionally treated to dinners at the likes of Café de la Paix, but mostly he spent his time talking to anyone who would listen."
