        "text": "Oscar Wilde’s life and art are very closely linked. He was born and grew up in Dublin; his father was a famous doctor while his mother was a translator and a nationalist poet.\n\nAfter graduating in classical studies at Trinity College, he won a scholarship to Oxford, where he met Pater and Ruskin, who introduced him to their aesthetic theories.\n\nHe settled in London where he became a popular dandy and he charmed everybody with his brilliant conversation.\n\nIn 1881 he published his first volume of poems.\n\nHe became an spokesman for the school “art for art’s sake” and in 1882 he gave a lecture tour in American, where he said “I have nothing to declare but my genius”.\n\nHowever he did some witty comedies very important.\n\nIn 1895 he was arrested, in fact he had married Costance Llyod with whome he had two children, and Marquis of Queensberry accused him of having a homosexual relationship with his son, Douglas.\n\nSo Oscar spent two years in prison during which time he wrote the poem “The Ballad of Reading Goal” and his confession “De Profundis”.\n\nAt the end, he was buried in Paris in the same cemetery of Baudelaire.\n\nThe importance of being Earnest\n\nThe title contains a play on words, because the word earnest (that means serious and sincere) is pronounced in the same way as the name Ernest.\n\nThe protagonists are Jack and Algy.\n\nThey both have a double life; Jack, when he visits the city, is called Ernest. Jack, to protect his reputation, convinces a young girl, Cecily Cardew, that Ernest is his brother.\n\nOne day, Jack falls in love with Fairfax. In the same time, Algy has invented a fictitious friend, the sickly Bunbury. When he want to escape from his family, he says that he has to go to visit his sickly friend.\n\nOne day, Algy falls in love with Cecily Cardew; Cecily thinks that Algy is Jack’s brother Earnest, with whom she is already in love.\n\nAfter many complications, transpires that Jack, when was a baby, was left in a handbag at Victoria Station.\n\nWe finally discover that Jack and Algy are brothers, and the true name of Jack is Ernest.\n\nHe became really earnest. So Fairfax can marry Ernest."
