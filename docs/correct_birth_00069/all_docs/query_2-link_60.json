        "text": "For Oscar Wilde, London was the centre of existence – of pleasure and of power. It was also the best place to buy cigarettes. Although he may have been born in Dublin in 1854 andwould die in Paris in 1900, it was in the English capital that he made both his home and his name. London was the locale of his keenest hopes and his greatest triumphs. It was the site, too, of his spectacular fall from grace.\n\nWilde has left his imprint upon the city. There remain many places touched by his presence. Of course there is Tite Street, the redbrick enclave in Chelsea where he lived – briefly at Number 1, then at what was Number 16 (now 34), in a house that he decorated in collaboration with the great architect-designer, EW Godwin.\n\nIt was from a front window of this “house beautiful” (a term Wilde used for his 1882 lecture on aesthetics) that he looked out one morning to be confronted by the sight of the actress Ellen Terry, emerging from a carriage decked in splendid emerald-green robes and a mass of paste jewellery – her costume for the role of Lady Macbeth. She was on her way to be painted by John Singer Sargent, the American artist who had his studio just across the way. It was a never-to-be-forgotten moment. “The street,” Wilde declared, “that on a wet and dreary morning has vouchsafed the vision of Lady Macbeth in full regalia, can never again be as other streets. It must always be full of wonderful possibilities.” To those wonderful possibilities is now added, perhaps, the chance of bumping into the ghost of Oscar Wilde.\n\nIt is easy to imagine him, too, in other places across the capital that still exist today: the galleries of the Royal Academy of Arts, where, as the “Apostle of Aestheticism”, he discoursed on art to herds of eager female worshippers in the early 1880s; St James’s Sussex Gardens, the parish church at Paddington with its frieze of pomegranates and sunflowers, where he married the beautiful Constance Lloyd in May 1884; Hatchards on Piccadilly where he bought his books; the Royal Arcade on Old Bond Street where he might obtain the specially- dyed green carnations that he wore in his buttonhole and so annoyed the philistines; the Café Royal where he liked to take his aperitifs; Kettner’s Townhouse (recently restored) where he “feasted with panthers” – or dined with rent boys; the Haymarket Theatre where two of his plays, A Woman of No Importance and An Ideal Husband, received their triumphant premieres; the Cadogan Hotel where – on 6 April 1895 – he was arrested on charges of gross indecency with various male persons; Great Marlborough Street’s magistrates court (now the modish Courthouse Hotel) where he was indicted; and the prisons at Pentonville and Wandsworth where he served part of his two-year sentence.\n\nYet Wilde’s spirit is perhaps felt most strongly along two distinguished London thoroughfares: the Strand and St James’s Street. Oscar loved the West End – the home of theatre, of fun, of fashion, of grand restaurants and hotels, and of luxurious living. It became his line that no gentleman ever goes east of Temple Bar – the boundary marker beyond which lies the City of London and the grim world of “work”."
