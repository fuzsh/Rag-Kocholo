        "text": "The Oscar Wilde House at 1 Merrion Square–one of Dublin's last magnificent Georgian squares– holds a rich history. It was here that Oscar Wilde's father, William, a renowned surgeon, settled in 1855 when Oscar was just a year old. The senior Wilde conducted consultations from the house, which has since been restored to showcase several antique surgical instruments on loan from the Royal College of Surgeons. Interestingly, the basement, once William's operating theatre, now serves as a café.\n\nFollowing William Wilde's passing in 1876, his widow faced significant debts and was forced to sell the house, relocating to England. Despite changing hands, the property remained a family residence for years until it was subdivided into flats and studios. By 1971, it had deteriorated to the point of being boarded up, remaining so for over two decades. However, in 1994, the American College of Dublin undertook a comprehensive renovation, breathing new life into the historic space. Ancient wood floors were revitalized, intricate cornices restored, and antique mirrors hung throughout the halls, dining room, and drawing room.\n\nToday, the top two floors accomodate classrooms for students, while other rooms host art and sculpture exhibitions, lectures by artists, conferences, and private events. Original Wilde family belongings, including Oscar's book collection and the Irish oak floorboards, are still in place. Visitors are encouraged to explore the neo-classical reliefs on the walls and admire the colored windows. Guided tours, particularly on Saturdays, offer a fascinating glimpse into the house's storied past, although self-guided tours are equally recommended.\n\nTip:\n\nStroll through Merrion Square Park, sauntering along the secret, leafy trails to discover the immaculately groomed gardens. Keep your eyes peeled for the statue of Oscar Wilde lounging on a boulder in the park's northeast nook, sporting a smoking jacket with red lapels.\n\nPub Crawl\n\nThe Irish in general and Dubliners in particular are known for their passion for whiskey and beer. As you embark upon a beguiling odyssey through the spirited streets of the Irish capital, you can't help noticing the reverberating vibrancy coming from its enchanting pubs. A tapestry of libation-laden lore awaits those who traverse the path of the Dublin pub crawl, guided by the siren call of... view more\n\nTour Duration: 2 Hour(s)\n\nTravel Distance: 2.4 Km or 1.5 Miles\n\nA Walk Along Liffey River\n\nThe Liffey River is a major waterway that flows through the Irish capital, stretching approximately 125 kilometers (78 miles) and dividing the city into two halves: the Northside and the Southside.\n\nA stroll along the river is bound to take you to the places steeped in history, associated with the events and people that played a significant role in the culture and development of Dublin, the... view more\n\nTour Duration: 1 Hour(s)\n\nTravel Distance: 2.1 Km or 1.3 Miles"
