        "text": "Oscar Wilde Timeline\n\nHow It All Went Down\n\nOct 16, 1854\n\nOscar Wilde Born\n\nOscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde is born in Dublin to Sir William and Francesca Elgee Wilde. Oscar is the second of the couple's three children, though he has three half-siblings from his father's previous relationships.\n\n1864\n\nStarts School\n\nWilde begins his studies at the Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, Ireland.\n\n1871\n\nStarts College\n\nWilde enrolls at Trinity College in Dublin to study classics. He is an outstanding student, earning the school's top prize in Greek.\n\n1874\n\nAttends Oxford\n\nWilde is awarded a Berkeley Gold Medal, Trinity's top honor for classics students. He earns a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, and enrolls there for further studies. Wilde raises some eyebrows at Oxford for his flamboyant dress and mannerisms.\n\nNov 1878\n\nGraduates From Oxford\n\nWilde is awarded the Newdigate Prize at Oxford for his poem \"Ravenna.\" He receives a bachelor's degree with top honors in classical moderations and classics. He moves to London.\n\n1881\n\nPoems Published\n\nWilde publishes his first book, a collection of verse entitled Poems. He has established a reputation as a leader in the London aesthetic movement, and is parodied as a dandy in the Gilbert & Sullivan opera Patience.\n\n1882\n\nU.S. Lecture Tour\n\nWilde spends the year lecturing in the United States. During his time in America, he meets poet Walt Whitman, whom he greatly admires, and produces his first play, Vera, in New York. The play is unpopular.\n\n1883\n\nLectures in the U.K.\n\nWilde does a lecture tour through England. He writes his second play, The Duchess of Padua, which also tanks.\n\nMay 29, 1884\n\nMarriage\n\nWilde marries Constance Lloyd, the wealthy daughter of an English barrister, in London. The couple settles in the Chelsea neighborhood of London.\n\nJun 5, 1885\n\nSon Born\n\nThe couple's first child, son Cyril, is born.\n\nNov 3, 1886\n\nSon Born\n\nThe Wildes' second son, Vyvyan, is born.\n\n1887\n\nWomen's World\n\nWilde is hired to revitalize the failing magazine Women's World. During his two years there, he turns the magazine around, insisting that the publication \"deal not merely with what women wear, but with what they think, and what they feel.\"27\n\n1888\n\nFairy Tales Published\n\nWilde publishes The Happy Prince and Other Tales, a collection of fairy tales.\n\n1891\n\nBooks Published\n\nWilde publishes a book of short stories as well as a collection of essays outlining his thoughts on aestheticism. He also publishes his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, which was serialized in a magazine the year before. Critics attack Wilde's moral character on the basis of the book's homoerotic overtones. He also befriends an Oxford student named Lord Alfred Douglas.\n\n1892\n\nTheatrical Success\n\nWilde writes the play Lady Windermere's Fan, which is a hit. He also writes a play in French called Salom√©, but it is not produced because of a law forbidding the depiction of Biblical characters on stage.\n\n1893\n\nA Woman of No Importance\n\nWilde's comedic play A Woman of No Importance premieres to great success.\n\nFeb 14, 1895\n\nThe Importance of Being Earnest\n\nWilde's play The Importance of Being Earnest premieres at St. James's Theatre in London. He and Lord Alfred Douglas are now lovers, a fact that enrages Douglas's father the Marquis of Queensberry. Queensberry attempts to get into the theater so that he can throw vegetables at Wilde but is barred from entry.\n\nFeb 18, 1895\n\nThe Calling Card\n\nQueensberry leaves a calling card at Wilde's home inscribed to \"Oscar Wilde, posing somdomite\" (he meant sodomite, a pejorative term for homosexuals). Wilde decides to sue Queensberry for libel, a decision that ends up ruining his life.\n\nApr 3, 1895\n\nQueensberry's Trial Begins\n\nThe libel trial begins. It soon becomes clear that the trial is more about Wilde's conduct as a gay man than about Queensberry's libel. Lawyers grill Wilde on his work and relationships, and submit his letters to Alfred Douglas as evidence. Queensberry is acquitted; Wilde is immediately arrested on charges of gross indecency.\n\nApr 26, 1895\n\nWilde's Trial Begins\n\nWilde's trial for indecency opens. At his family's urging, Douglas leaves the country and goes to France. Constance Wilde takes their sons to Europe and changes their last name. Wilde never sees his children again.\n\nMay 25, 1895\n\nSentenced\n\nOscar Wilde is convicted of gross indecency and is sentenced to two years hard labor. He is sent immediately to prison and is eventually transferred to Reading Gaol.\n\nFeb 3, 1896\n\nMother Dies\n\nWilde's mother Francesca dies. His wife Constance visits him in prison in order to break the news. Wilde pays for her funeral but is unable to afford a headstone, and so she is buried in an unmarked grave.\n\nMay 19, 1897\n\nRelease from Jail\n\nWilde is released from Reading Gaol in poor health. He goes to France, where he spends the rest of his life in exile."
