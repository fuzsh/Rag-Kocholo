        "text": "A glamour model hopes that taking a enterprisingly sexy approach to tuition could prove a hit with budding linguists.\n\nKaoru Kickuchi, a qualified architect who has also posed for FHM, has set up an online learning resource to encourage foreigners to learn Mandarin.\n\nIt may prove difficult for some pupils to concentrate on their conjugations though, as the course’s ‘teachers’ are a pack of nearly-naked models.\n\nKickuchi, who graduated from Nottingham University, believes that her sexy start up will help relax students ahead of getting to grips with the complexity of the language.\n\n“If you go the textbook way with all these Chinese characters it just makes you intimidated,” she said.\n\n“If you start with the colloquial way … or sexy clips it is a different story.”\n\nGoing by the barely-dressed instructors in the video above, that certainly seems to be the case.\n\nBut what do skimpily-dressed medical role play situations have to do with picking up a new language?\n\nShould the scheme take off, expect Michael Gove to report on an upsurge in teenage boys opting to take languages at GSCE."
