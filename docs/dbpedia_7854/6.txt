I was the host for this show’s predecessor. Shot in Cebu, Philippines on BigFoot Studio’s lot. Owner is Michael Gleissner, a German guy who invested well and got out quick. Now makes movies and TV shows strictly about hot women and featuring hot women.

One walk around the studio showcases the stereotypical older white man’s taste in Asian girls. Also, his guards are all young, attractive girls flown in from Russia.

He is essentially a bond villain.

He’s been trying to get into the Mainland market for a while now and thought this Mandarin program would help. I’m honestly surprised I was even allowed to be a part of it, given that I have a penis. He does this new series in Taiwan though. He even clearly copies the animation style of the Chinese teacher from the original one I worked on.

It also amuses me that he was an executive producer on Shanghai Kiss. That movie will never stop haunting me on Reddit.
