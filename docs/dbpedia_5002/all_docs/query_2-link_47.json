The subcommittee met at 2:13 p.m., in room SD-192, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Mitch McConnell (chairman) presiding. Present: Senators McConnell, Bennett, Campbell, and Leahy. DEPARTMENT OF STATE Office of South Asian Affairs STATEMENTS OF: HON. KARL F. INDERFURTH, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR SOUTH ASIAN AFFAIRS HON. JULIA TAFT, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR POPULATION, REFUGEES, AND MIGRATION opening statement of senator mitch mc connell Senator McConnell. Today's hearing will come to order. This is the first in a series of what I would characterize as some of the world's more, if not most, intractable problems. Over the next few months, I intend for the subcommittee to hold hearings on the linkages between U.S. assistance programs and our policies toward Afghanistan, North Korea, Iraq, the Palestinians, Russia, Indonesia, and Brazil. In each country we either indirectly or directly provide some type of aid. The funding ranges from support for programs for refugees, such as the border efforts along Afghanistan, to development and multilateral bank programs in Indonesia, Brazil, and Russia. While it is easy to provide anecdotal evidence that U.S. aid relieves human suffering and reduces poverty, at a time of rapidly diminishing levels of foreign aid resources, the unfortunate reality that Senator Leahy and I oppose, but must live with, is the whole question of whether our aid is serving our interests, where and when it matters most. Just a few of the kinds of questions I hope to examine over the coming months include: Has our expenditure of over $75 million for oil for North Korea reduced the threat of military conflict or the menace of their nuclear program? Is the congressional initiative to fund the opposition efforts to liberate Iraq achieving any results? Has our support of the IMF and World Bank programs promoted a stable, free market democracy or has it fed corruption in Russia? But today the questions will focus on Afghanistan. Several explosive issues fuse together in Afghanistan: narcotics trafficking, terrorism, regional military tensions, ethnic hostilities, refugee pressures, and internal civil and human rights abuses. Central to the solution of each of these problems and the promotion of our interests is the establishment of a viable, stable representative government, something that Afghan people have not enjoyed for decades. While there is a school of thought that argues the Taliban has delivered peaceful relief from years of Soviet occupation and mujahedin factional fighting, conditions are neither prosperous nor improved for most Afghanis today. Kandahar is a long, long distance from Kentucky, and no doubt many will ask why we should bother with a hearing, aid, or any measure of policy interest. The answer is simple: Afghanistan is the second largest producer of opium for heroin which makes its way onto U.S. streets; 220 people, including 12 Americans, died in savage bomb blasts that the administration blames on the Osama bin Laden organization, afforded honorary guest protection by the Taliban. Continued armed clashes between Iran's military and the Taliban risk a wider war, drawing in Pakistan, Russia, and Uzbekistan. Pakistan has provided safe haven to over 800,000 refugees, straining Islamabad's limited economic resources and political stability, facts which ripple through the nuclear dynamic with India. And finally, central to today's hearings, we all have mothers. Many have wives and sisters, and in their names in our common interests, we must address the Taliban's harsh, systematic denial to girls and women of health care, education, employment, and the most basic of rights. The status and treatment of women by the Taliban is not simply a matter of our cultural insensitivities as some would argue. In fact, lives are at stake. Women are beaten for appearing in public without a male relative or failing to wear the suffocating veils of the burqua. I was stunned to read that wearing white socks with the burqua risks a public beating because they are viewed as inappropriate and sexually provocative. And it is not just lives at stake. An entire generation of children is at risk. Until 1996, 70 percent of Afghanistan's teachers were women. Most are now banned from the profession and public schools remain closed, depriving all school age children of an education, girls and boys alike. Afghanistan is being dragged back into the dark ages, a time when women were chattel, literacy was a luxury, and sorcery substituted for sound medicine and health care. Children died of colds and measles then as they do now in Kabul. Far too many women died in childbirth, victims of ignorance, as they do now in Kandahar. The Taliban's war against the remnants of the mujahedin, combined with international isolation, compound the economic suffering. Yet, as depressing as conditions are, I do not think the situation is hopeless. In fact, I think there is a unique convergence of international interests which could compel strong action to produce a settlement of the internal conflict and an agenda to protect the rights and interests of all Afghans. Ironically after fighting a proxy war for a decade, the United States and Russia now share an interest in containing the influence of the Taliban's virulent form of Islamic fundamentalism. The Russians have obvious concerns about the Taliban's capacity to destabilize Central Asian states on their border. Russian support for the mujahedin, our former clients and the Taliban's only opposition, may also stem from an interest in limiting the development of alternative and competitive pipelines through Afghanistan. I understand we have engaged in a United Nations effort designed to produce a settlement which involves six key regional nations plus the United States and Russia. Given our interests, I hope this process can be energized and bring about a final solution. I also hope to hear today views on the wisdom of expanding our support for both border and cross-border initiatives which serve the interests of women and children. prepared statement Afghanistan fuses multiple threats to American interests. It is precisely the type challenge I think we are likely to face as we turn the corner on this century. How we learn to deal with this lethal mix of religion, drugs, terrorism, repression, and crime today may very well define our security, if not our survival in the future.

I would like now to turn to my colleague, the ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Leahy, for his opening statement and then we will proceed with our witnesses. Senator Leahy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to commend you for having this hearing. It is hard to describe in words what we have heard about this part of the world. We call it tragic, horrifying, outrageous, sad. No words are enough. We do know it has received too little attention for too long. The witnesses we have here are as knowledgeable as any we could have come before us, and I want to thank them for keeping us informed. Some of the information we have received has been from people who have risked their own safety to document the plight of the Afghan people. Ambassador Inderfurth is one of the finest professional diplomats I have ever had the pleasure to know. I can think of no one more qualified to represent our interests in Afghanistan. It was not very long ago that U.S. policy toward Afghanistan was the subject of considerable tension in the Congress and the press. It also soaked up huge amounts of American aid to the mujahedin and the millions of refugees in Pakistan. But, you know, besides the fact that they were anti-Soviet, we did not have much understanding of the people we were supporting. The Russians were their enemies. That made them our friends. And when the Russians left, we abandoned the Afghan people to the chaos and brutality of a country that turned on itself. Assistant Secretary Taft, who is extraordinarily knowledgeable in this area, knows what happened then. The Taliban, notorious for their flagrant violations of human rights and their especially brutal repression of women and girls, now occupy some 85 percent of the country. And Afghan refugees, some 2.4 million of them, remain the largest refugee population receiving U.N. assistance. I believe I am right in that number, am I not, Ms. Taft? Ms. Taft. Yes. Senator Leahy. As the chairman has said, the horrendous injustices being perpetrated against Afghan women, all in the name of Islam, is reminiscent of the dark ages. Physicians for Human Rights and others have documented the drastic decline in women's health and education. It is a travesty that should be condemned by the entire world. There should be no question that the United States will never recognize a regime that systematically subjects half its population to such barbarous mistreatment. Even though the Soviet army is gone, the fields and hillsides and roads, even some of the urban areas, are death traps. Some 7 million land mines litter the country, tens of thousands of amputees, mostly civilians, who have virtually no access to rehabilitation. I show a photograph periodically on the Senate floor of an Afghan boy missing both legs. That tells the story better than words of why the use of land mines should be a war crime. Besides the humanitarian crisis, the Taliban have shown no regard for the security concerns of their neighbors or the rest of the international community. Again, as the chairman pointed out, Osama bin Laden is an example of that. If that is not enough, Afghanistan and Burma share the dubious distinction of being the world's largest producers of opium poppy. What heroin has to do with Islamic fundamentalism is one of the mysteries that apparently only the Taliban can answer. I recognize the restraints they put on our humanitarian efforts. It would be easy to walk away. But we share a lot of the responsibility for what has happened in Afghanistan and we should not walk away. So, I hope, Ambassador Inderfurth, you will give us an idea of how much popular support the Taliban has, and whether they face any serious internal threat. Is there any hope for a sustained political dialog that could lead to a broad-based government? Do they care about world opinion? Two of our allies, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, support them. Are we encouraging them to cut that aid off? Is there more we could do for women and the children there? prepared statement I want to know whether will we will say publicly that the U.S. Government will not support normal relations with the Taliban or a seat at the U.N. until they stop supporting terrorism and uphold internationally recognized human rights? Mr. Chairman, I do want to hear the witnesses. I thank you again for holding this hearing. Senator McConnell. Thank you, Senator Leahy. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy Mr. Chairman, I want to commend you for holding this hearing on Afghanistan. It is hard to find words to adequately describe what has happened there--tragic, horrifying, outrageous. Whichever you choose, it has received far too little attention for far too long. These witnesses are as knowledgeable as any, and I want to thank them for keeping us informed--at times risking their own safety to document the plight of the Afghan people. Ambassador Inderfurth is one of the finest professional diplomats I have ever had the pleasure to know. I can think of no one more qualified to represent our interests in Afghanistan. It was not very long ago that U.S. policy towards Afghanistan was a subject of considerable attention in the Congress and the press. It also soaked up huge amounts of American aid, to the mujahideen and the millions of refugees in Pakistan. But besides the fact that they were anti-Soviet, we had little understanding of the people we were supporting. The Russians were their enemies, and that made them our friends.

There are some 7 million landmines littering the country and tens of thousands of amputees--mostly civilians, who have virtually no access to rehabilitation. This photograph of an Afghan boy, missing both legs, tells the story. It says, better than words, why the use of landmines should be a war crime. Besides the humanitarian crisis, the Taliban have shown no regard for the security concerns of their neighbors or the rest of the international community. They have given safe haven to Osama bin Laden, whose support for international terrorism is well known. Although the press reported last week that he and the Taliban had a falling out, there is no indication that they will respond to our repeated requests to expel him so he can be brought to justice. If that were not enough, Afghanistan and Burma share the dubious distinction of being the world's largest producers of opium poppy. What heroin has to do with Islamic fundamentalism is one of those mysteries that only the Taliban can answer. I recognize the constraints that the Taliban have put on our humanitarian efforts and those of the international relief agencies. It would be easy to do nothing but lament what has happened. But the United States shares responsibility for the chaos and suffering that has engulfed Afghanistan, and we should do what we can to help the Afghan people. We need to know where we can go from here. I hope Ambassador Inderfurth will give us an idea of how much popular support the Taliban has, and whether at this point they face any serious internal threat. Is there any hope for a sustained political dialogue that could lead to a broad-based government, or some other weakening of the Taliban's control? Do the Taliban care about world opinion? Two U.S. allies--Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, support the Taliban. What are we doing to encourage them to cut off their support? Is there nothing more that they can do to pressure the Taliban to change their most objectionable policies? Isn't there more we can do to help alleviate the plight of Afghan women and children? I hope our witnesses can give us some concrete advice on ways we could help. Have we said publicly that the U.S. Government will not support normal relations with the Taliban or a seat at the U.N., until they stop supporting terrorism and uphold internationally recognized human rights? These are a few of my questions. I hope, Mr. Chairman, that this hearing will point to steps this subcommittee can take to help the people of Afghanistan. prepared statement of senator dianne feinstein Senator Leahy. Mr. Chairman, I would also ask that a statement by Senator Feinstein be put in the record at this point. Senator McConnell. Yes; without objection, we will put Senator Feinstein's statement in the record. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Senator Dianne Feinstein Mr. Chairman, thank you for calling this important hearing, and for allowing me to make a statement on the situation in Afghanistan, about which I have been very concerned for some time now. Just about one year ago I held a public meeting with representatives from the administration and leading non-governmental organizations to discuss one aspect of this situation--the Taliban's treatment of women and girls--a situation which I think we would all agree is deplorable, and one which I find to be particularly troubling. The information reported at that meeting was devastating: --Every day the women of Afghanistan are excluded from the international community's prevailing vision of human rights, and continue to lack basic legal rights, access to education, and access to economic opportunity. --There are more than 50,000 war widows in Kabul alone, many dependent on international humanitarian assistance for their very survival. --It is estimated that close to 500,000 to 800,000 war widows have been forced out of their jobs and have no opportunity to earn money for food, clothing, or shelter for either themselves or their children. --In Kabul's stark ruins hordes of children--as many as 12,000 according to one estimate--paw each day through the shattered bricks and masonry in search of scrap metal that can be sold. And their mothers, many who previously worked in professional jobs, have been reduced to begging in order to feed their families. --According to Theresa Loar, the State Department's Senior Coordinator for Women's Issues, in the 1970s and 1980s a growing number of Afghan women worked outside the home: There were female lawyers, judges, doctors, and teachers. This trend was reversed in 1992 and now, under the Taliban, ``women and girls became, and remain today, virtually invisible.'' --The ban on women in the workplace has also compounded the already precarious food situation. With the war having killed more than 9 million head of cattle and sheep and destroyed much of Afghanistan's croplands, irrigation systems, and roads, the average Afghan has a caloric intake equal to less than a pound of bread a day. --Education is a major concern, with edicts which prevent girls from attending school and receiving an education. A small, low- profile, ``home school'' movement has had some fitful success, but these home schools are no substitute for access to a real education. --Many Non-Governmental Organizations have been doing work which is nothing short of heroic to provide medical and humanitarian assistance under the most adverse of circumstances. But they are faced with numerous constraints, from laws and practices which prevent the distribution of assistance or services directly to the women in need to physical danger which has, on numerous occasions, prevented them from working in Afghanistan. The women of Afghanistan, who have seen their families destroyed by war, are now having their economic life and their fundamental human rights stripped away. And, as witnessed by a ground breaking report by Physicians for Human Rights, the situation in Afghanistan has not improved at all in the past year. The report found, that: --A woman died of appendicitis after being turned away from two hospitals; --Women with diabetes are being denied insulin at clinics simply because they are women and, under Taliban edict, male doctors cannot treat them; and, --Women are dying in childbirth because male doctors are prohibited from performing deliveries, and female doctors are prohibited from working. As the State Department's 1998 Human Rights report states: ``The treatment of women and girls continued to deteriorate. There was widespread discrimination against women and girls, especially in areas under Taliban control. The Taliban imposed strict dress codes and prohibited women from working outside the home except in limited circumstances in the health care field. Girls generally were prohibited from attending school, particularly in Kabul and other urban areas.'' This hearing gives the Committee an opportunity to learn what the Administration has done over this past year to implement the ``Afghan Women's Initiative'' which I called for in a resolution adopted by the Senate last year. That resolution called on the United States to play a larger role in leading international efforts to provide assistance to Afghan women in Afghanistan and in refugee camps, with an emphasis on capacity-building, training programs, legal assistance, support for microenterprise projects, and refugee reintegration and protection. This hearing can also probe the Administration's thoughts and plans for the general scope and direction of U.S. policy towards Afghanistan. Looking beyond the question of the Taliban's treatment of women, the situation in Afghanistan is one of concern for the United States on so many levels, and for so many reasons. The conditions of near-anarchy that have resulted from the civil war have created in Afghanistan an environment well-suited for the training of terrorists and the production and shipment of drugs. It is no coincidence that Osama Bin Laden had chosen Afghanistan as a base of operations, or that the past few years have seen Afghanistan rise to become the producer of one-third of the world's opium and heroin. Lastly, the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan has created a strategic imbalance in the region, threatening stability in Russia, the Gulf, the newly-emerging states of Central Asia, and South Asia itself. Afghanistan, long smoldering with its internal civil war, is a regional tinderbox which threatens to ignite at any moment. The only long-term solution to the plight of the Afghan people is to help bring an end to the conflict that has created the Taliban, and to begin the long process of rebuilding a stable and prosperous Afghanistan. The sort of long-term economic redevelopment that will be necessary to repair Afghanistan's battered infrastructure will not be possible unless both men and women are able to take up gainful employment and have equal access to educational opportunities. summary statement of hon. karl inderfurth Senator McConnell. Our first panel will include Assistant Secretary Inderfurth who will provide an assessment of the political and security situation, followed by Assistant Secretary Taft who will report on refugee matters and how our humanitarian assistance may be serving our interests in the region. I would like for you both, if you have formal statements, to put them in the record, and please summarize them for our benefit. Then we will be glad to ask whatever questions we may have. Who would like to lead off? Secretary Inderfurth. Mr. Inderfurth. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Senator Leahy, members of the committee, along with my colleague, Assistant Secretary Taft, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to testify. I should add that I fully agree that Afghanistan falls into the category that you mentioned as one of the world's most intractable problems and, I might add, tragic. I hope that this hearing will make it clear why we in the United States should care and indeed why our interests are engaged. Mr. Chairman, I do have a longer statement which I would like to ask be submitted for the record, and I will try now to have a briefer presentation. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, 10 years ago last month, I was an eyewitness to history. I stood at the bridge over the Amu Darya River in Uzbekistan and watched the last Soviet troops depart Afghanistan. After an estimated 2 million dead with their country in ruins, the valiant Afghan people were victorious over a superpower. I hoped this meant the end of 10 years of conflict and that peace at last was returning to Afghanistan. Unfortunately, this was not to be the case. The fighting continues today and it shows no signs of abating. The Taliban occupy 85 percent of the country but do not exercise effective political control, particularly in the north. Elements of the Northern Alliance continue to resist and have actually improved their position in recent months. We believe there is no military solution to this conflict. Yet, the Taliban has demonstrated no willingness to work for a political settlement, largely because they believe they can win militarily. We and others in the international community are working hard to change that view. Mr. Chairman, Afghanistan is geographically remote from us, but the effects of 20 years of conflict are not. Key U.S. interests are endangered. Anyone familiar with the events of last August and the destruction of U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam knows the effect the Afghan conflict has had upon us. Afghanistan has become a breeding ground for international terrorism. In the fight against the Soviets, the Afghan resistance did not resort to international terrorism, but today Osama bin Laden and others have taken advantage of the war and its dislocations to use Afghan soil for training, basing, and safe haven. Terrorists with links to Afghanistan, both veterans of the fighting and those who have received training or shelter there, have committed terrorist acts in the region, including Kashmir, and beyond in Europe, Africa, and even in the United States. We have urged all of the Afghan factions to stop sheltering terrorists and their training facilities and to expel terrorists from parts of the country under their control. We have stressed to the Taliban and those with influence over them the need to expel Osama bin Laden to a location where he can be brought to justice. We have told them that he is plotting acts of terrorism against us and that because the Taliban have provided him safe haven, we will hold them responsible for his actions. Despite hollow protestations that Osama bin Laden is missing, there is no evidence he has left Afghanistan. Our experts and other informed observers believe he remains in Taliban-controlled territory. The Taliban are playing a risky and unwise game in attempting to convince us otherwise. Mr. Chairman, narcotics production and trafficking is another byproduct of the continued conflict, as you referred to in your statement. Afghanistan is now the world's second largest producer of opium and a major center for producing opiates. Narcotics produced in Afghanistan supply 3 million addicts in Pakistan and tens of thousands in Europe. Increasingly, heroin from Afghan-grown poppies is found in the United States. Almost all the opium produced in Afghanistan comes from Taliban areas, but virtually every faction has been involved at every level with and benefited financially from relationships with drug producers and traffickers. Nobody has clean hands on this. We and others have called on the Taliban and other factions to destroy opium crops and processing capability and urged cooperation with the U.N. Drug Control Program. Despite these calls, opium production increased 7 percent last year. Mr. Chairman, let me now turn to the human rights situation in Afghanistan. It is abysmal. Our most recent human rights report documents violations by all sides. Taliban forces killed thousands in Mazar-i-Sharif last year, reportedly based in part on ethnicity. This is part of a cycle arising from the massacre of Taliban prisoners by northern forces in 1997. The Taliban attempts to impose an extreme interpretation of Islam practiced nowhere else in the world on all individuals, men and women, under their control. We have received reports of religious persecution at the hands of the Taliban in prohibiting Shia prayer practices and converting Shia mosques to Sunni. They have also banned many traditional elements of Afghan culture, including music and kite flying. But few practices have aroused more worldwide condemnation than Taliban treatment of women and girls. Women and girls historically have been at a tremendous disadvantage in Afghan society. Only a small but growing number of Afghan women, almost entirely in urban areas, worked outside the home in nontraditional roles as lawyers, judges, doctors, and government officials. The status of women and girls in Afghanistan deteriorated rapidly with the resumption of fighting between the resistance factions in 1992. The trend significantly intensified with the Taliban takeover of Kabul in 1996 and the imposition of harsh social strictures. We have received recent reports that Taliban sympathizers in Pakistan, both Pakistani and Afghan, have attempted to apply similar restrictions both upon female inhabitants of refugee camps and upon Pakistani women too. When the Taliban took control of Kabul, they immediately forbade women to work outside the home, but gradually allowed exceptions for some female doctors and nurses. In urban areas, women are often barred from going outside the home unless accompanied by a male relative. The impact of Taliban restrictions on women is most acutely felt in cities such as Herat and Kabul, where there are numbers of educated and professional women who previously enjoyed far greater latitude. War widows--an estimated 30,000 are in Kabul alone--have been especially hard hit. Many of them are the sole providers for their families and have been reduced to begging to feed their children. There are credible reports that some women, now forcibly housebound, have attempted suicide by swallowing household cleaner rather than continuing to live under these conditions of isolation. Mr. Chairman, we have heard much about the burqa, and you spoke about that in your opening statement as well. Let me state what I know for the record. Others will expand on this I am sure during today's testimony. Women are enjoined from appearing in public, particularly in cities, unless wearing a traditional long robe called a burqa covering them from head to toe. Women have been beaten by the Taliban religious police on the street for failure to completely cover themselves in a burqa. Although some Afghan women wore the burqa before the Taliban took control, it was not an enforced dress code. Today it is. Mr. Chairman, the Taliban has also restricted education for girls, particularly in Kabul. Kabul's private home-based schools, which had quietly continued to operate, were ordered closed last year, though we understand some were allowed to reopen since. Although the Taliban claims that it is not against female education and has requested resources for Afghanistan's minimum educational infrastructure, these claims ring hollow. The militia has taken little real action to provide for female education. Women's and girls' access to medical services and hospitals has been drastically reduced. Although they reportedly are allowed to receive emergency care in all Kabul hospitals and non-emergency care in a few, women have died because male doctors were not allowed to treat them. The lack of ready access to medical facilities that do exist is further impacted by shortages of medicine and equipment. We commend Physicians for Human Rights for bringing this horrible situation to the attention of the world in its survey and report of women's health and human rights under the Taliban in Kabul. Mr. Chairman, the United States condemns Taliban policies publicly. Secretary of State Albright, during her visit to the Nasir Bagh refugee camps in Pakistan, described the Taliban's treatment of women as despicable. At the Human Rights Day celebration last December, the First Lady recognized two Afghan women in the audience for their invaluable work on behalf of women and girls and also said--and I quote--``We cannot allow these terrible crimes against women and girls--and, truly, against all humanity--to continue with impunity. We must all make it unmistakably clear this terrible suffering inflicted on the women and girls of Afghanistan is not cultural, it is criminal. And we must do everything we can in our power to stop it.'' The President has pledged continued assistance to the women suffering under the Taliban regime. In international fora, we also speak out. We drafted the country resolutions on Afghanistan for this year and last year's annual meeting of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women. Along with other U.S. officials, I have personally raised this issue in meetings with senior Taliban and Pakistani officials. I note the campaign instituted by the Feminist Majority and other human rights and women's organizations designed to raise our consciousness and to help Afghan women and girls. The State Department looks forward to working with them in this endeavor. My colleague, Assistant Secretary Taft, will inform you in this hearing regarding what we are doing on the ground in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran to help all Afghans, but specifically Afghan women and girls, despite difficulty caused by the continuing conflict, security problems, and pressure from the Afghan factions, including the Taliban. The United States, as the largest individual contributor to Afghan relief, has a record that I believe we can all be proud of. Mr. Chairman, my written testimony goes into a fairly lengthy section on regional stability and the search for peace. Let me mention that that effort is ongoing, that currently the U.N. Secretary-General's Special Envoy, Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi, is in the region, and that he is pursuing the so- called Six plus Two process that you mentioned in your opening statement. We also see some contacts taking place between the parties themselves, including the Taliban and some of the forces represented by Commander Masood. A meeting is scheduled to take place in Ashgabat on March 10th. Finally, as I think you know, later today, snow willing, I am prepared to depart for Moscow where I am to have consultations with the Russians on Afghanistan, and they continue to be very much involved and concerned about the events there. Rather than going into these issues at this time, let me simply restate for the record U.S. policy with respect to the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and then be prepared to answer questions, including those posed by Senator Leahy in his remarks. Mr. Chairman, the United States supports no individual Afghan faction, but maintains contacts with all to further progress toward a peaceful settlement. We recognize none of the contending factions as the Government of Afghanistan and have no plans to do so. We would be prepared to recognize a Government of Afghanistan that was broad-based, multi-ethnic, and representative and respected international norms of behavior on issues of concern to the world community, including terrorism, narcotics, and human rights, particularly the rights of women and girls and minorities. prepared statement Thus, we continue to be actively engaged on several fronts in the U.N., in Washington, in the region, and elsewhere. Our efforts, unfortunately, have not yet met with success. The fighting continues, the Afghan people suffer, the effects of the conflict spill over into neighboring lands and beyond. But as I have said before, without our direct involvement, this conflict will likely only continue to fester, causing even greater damage to our own interests and to those of the Afghan people. Thank you very much. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Karl F. Inderfurth afghanistan today: the u.s. response Ten years ago last month, I was an eyewitness to history. I stood at the bridge over the Amu Darya River in Uzbekistan and watched the last Soviet troops depart Afghanistan. After an estimated 2 million dead, with their country in ruins, the valiant Afghan people were victorious over a superpower. I hoped this meant the end of 10 years of conflict and that peace at last was returning to Afghanistan. Unfortunately this was not to be the case. The fighting continues today. Worse, Afghans are fighting Afghans in an increasingly ethnic war unprecedented in Afghan history. Thus internecine conflict continues to the detriment of the Afghan people, the region, and the world. War shows no signs of abating. The Taliban occupy 85 percent of the country but do not exercise effective control, particularly in the North. Elements of the Northern Alliance continue to resist and have actually improved their position in recent months. We believe there is no military solution to this conflict, yet the Taliban has demonstrated no willingness to work for a political settlement, largely because they still believe they can win militarily. We and others in the international community are working to change this view. Terrorism Afghanistan is geographically remote from us, but the effects of 20 years of conflict are not. Key U.S. interests are endangered. Anyone familiar with the events of last August and the destruction of U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam knows the effect the Afghan conflict has had upon us. Afghanistan has become a breeding ground for international terrorism. In the fight against the Soviets, the Afghan resistance did not resort to international terrorism, but today Osama bin Laden and others have taken advantage of the war and its dislocations to use Afghan soil for training, basing, and safehaven. Terrorists with links to Afghanistan, both veterans of the fighting and those who have received training or shelter there, have committed terrorist acts in the region, including Kashmir, and beyond--in Europe, Africa, and even in the United States. We have urged all of the Afghan factions to stop sheltering terrorists and their training facilities and to expel terrorists from parts of the country under their control. We have stressed to the Taliban--and those with influence over them--the need to expel Osama bin Laden to a location where he can be brought to justice. We have told them he is still plotting acts of terrorism against us and that because the Taliban have provided him safehaven, we will hold them responsible for his actions. Despite hollow protestations that Osama bin Laden is ``missing,'' there is no evidence he has left Afghanistan. Our experts and other informed observers believe he remains in Taliban-controlled territory. The Taliban are playing a risky and unwise game in attempting to convince us otherwise. Narcotics Narcotics production and trafficking is another byproduct of the continued conflict. Afghanistan is now the world's second largest producer of opium and a major center for processing opiates. Narcotics produced in Afghanistan supply three million addicts in Pakistan and tens of thousands in Europe. Increasingly, heroin from Afghan-grown poppies is found in the U.S. Almost all the opium produced in Afghanistan comes from Taliban areas, but virtually every faction has been involved at every level with and benefited financially from relationships with drug producers and traffickers. Nobody has clean hands on this. We and others have called on the Taliban and other factions to destroy opium crops and processing capability and urged cooperation with the U.N. Drug Control Program. Despite these calls, opium production increased 7 percent last year. Human rights The human rights situation is abysmal. Our most recent human rights report documents violations by all sides. Taliban forces killed thousands in Mazar-i-Sharif last year, reportedly based in part on ethnicity. This is part of a cycle arising from the massacre of Taliban prisoners by northern forces in 1997.

There are credible reports that some women, now forcibly housebound, have attempted suicide by swallowing household cleaner, rather than continuing to live under these conditions of isolation. We have heard much about the ``burqa.'' Let me state what I know for the record. Women are enjoined from appearing in public, particularly in cities, unless wearing a traditional long robe called the ``burqa'' covering them from head to toe. A small mesh covered opening about five inches square provides the only means to see. Women have been beaten by the Taliban ``religious police'' on the street for failure to completely cover themselves in a burqa. Although many Afghan women wore the burqa before the Taliban took control, it was not an enforced dress code. Many women in Kabul typically appeared in public wearing scarves that just covered the head. In rural areas, women do chores, tend animals, gather water and fire wood and, when working in the fields, do not wear burqas and enjoy a greater degree of mobility than female city-dwellers. The Taliban also restricted education for girls, particularly in Kabul. Kabul's private home-based schools, which had quietly continued to operate, were ordered closed last year, though we understand some were allowed to reopen since. Although the Taliban claims that it is not against female education and has requested resources for Afghanistan's minimal educational infrastructure, these claims ring hollow.

The United States condemns Taliban policies publicly. Secretary of State Albright, during her visit to the Nasir Bagh refugee camps in Pakistan described the Taliban's treatment of women as ``despicable.'' She said ``We are opposed to their (the Taliban's) approach to human rights, to their despicable treatment of women and children, and their lack of respect for human dignity, in a way more reminiscent of the past than the future.'' At the Human Rights Day celebration last December, the First Lady recognized two Afghan women in the audience for their invaluable work on behalf of women and girls and also said ``We cannot allow these terrible crimes against women and girls--and, truly, against all of humanity--to continue with impunity.

Along with other U.S. officials, I have personally raised the issue in meetings with senior Taliban and Pakistani officials. I note the campaign instituted by the Feminist Majority and other human rights and women's organizations designed to raise our consciousness and to help Afghan women and girls. The State Department looks forward to working with them in this endeavor. My colleague, Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugee and Migration Affairs Julia Taft, will inform you later in this hearing regarding what we are doing on the ground in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran to help all Afghans, but specifically Afghan women and girls, despite difficulty caused by the continuing conflict, security problems, and pressure from the Afghan factions, including the Taliban. The United States, as the largest individual contributor to Afghan relief, has a record that we all can be proud of. Regional stability and the search for peace I want to move to a broader area of concern--regional stability. The ongoing conflict has affected the entire region and beyond, spilling over into neighboring countries. I have spoken of drugs and terrorism. Let me also mention the refugees, arms-trafficking, ethnic and religious conflict, and the obstacle the ongoing fighting poses for those who want to see Afghanistan regain its traditional role as an important trade route between Central and South Asia. Events in Afghanistan rightfully have alarmed its neighbors. Terrorists trained in Afghanistan operate in neighboring states. The conflict itself threatens to spread. Last year, we saw a danger of a wider war when, following the killing of Iranian officials in Mazar-i- Sharif by Taliban forces retaking the city, Iran increased troop deployments on its border with Pakistan and Afghanistan and held largescale maneuvers. Fortunately, the U.N. was able to defuse this crisis, but as long as the fighting goes on, there is a danger it will draw in neighboring countries. We all agree the war has gone on far too long. The question arises what we are doing to bring it to a close, both bilaterally and through the U.N.-led peace effort. We strongly support the U.N.'s efforts, particularly the work of the Secretary General's special envoy Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi. We participate enthusiastically in Ambassador Brahimi's group of Six-plus- Two--composed of Afghanistan's six neighbors (Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China), Russia and the United States. I have participated in Six plus Two meetings in New York. The group represents an effort to have influential countries press the Afghan factions toward a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement. The Six-plus-two includes the key external players and it also provides a means by which, under the aegis of the U.N., we work constructively to bring peace to the region. The Six plus Two developed a series of Points of Common Understanding at its September 21 meeting in which Secretary of State Albright represented the United States. These points were communicated to the various factions. The call for a ceasefire and a settlement was unfortunately not taken up by the Afghan parties, particularly by the Taliban, which at that time had made several major military advances against its opponents and believed that it would inevitably be victorious. Circumstances today are different. We believe resistance to the Taliban is growing. There is organized opposition to them in the newly- occupied areas in the North and in the Hazarajat, and even in Pashtun- inhabited areas there have been violent cultural clashes and protests against conscription. Masood's forces also remain in the field. It should be clearer to all there is no military solution in sight. The U.N. now hopes to move the factions, including the Taliban, further along the road toward peace. Ambassador Brahimi is in the region now, meeting with all the factions and Afghanistan's neighbors in an effort to advance the process, particularly by narrowing differences between Pakistan and Iran, the principal supporters of the Taliban and the Northern Alliance respectively. The U.N. efforts, coupled with those of the Government of Turkmenistan, have had some initial success. Representatives of the Taliban and the Northern Alliance are due to meet in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, tomorrow, March 10, in direct negotiations. Ambassador Brahimi sounded a note of caution saying, ``I won't say this is the last chance, but I would appeal to them--referring to the warring parties--not to disappoint the Afghan people once again.'' He urged the parties, on behalf of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, to go to the talks with ``a spirit of compromise and understanding, patience and a constructive approach.'' We agree with these sentiments. The Six-plus-Two also has endorsed a proposal by Uzbekistan to host a meeting of deputy foreign ministers in Tashkent that would engage the Afghan parties in a concerted effort to end the fighting. Work is ongoing in New York on a political declaration but more groundwork will be needed to ensure a successful meeting. In particular, all Six-plus- Two members must accept that the ongoing conflict is in no one's interest and act accordingly. It is a fact that some Six-plus-Two members rendered or facilitated assistance to their favored Afghan clients, providing arms, munitions, economic help, and military advisers. On the bilateral level we maintain contact with the Afghan factions and other key interested countries in an effort to promote peace. This evening I plan to leave Washington for our regular consultations with Russia on South Asian issues in which Afghanistan will play a prominent part. We also are in contact with neutral Afghans currently attempting to organize a dialogue aimed at convoking a grand national assembly--loya jirga--designed to bring a peaceful end to the war. I met in Peshawar on February 2 with several distinguished Afghan moderates including former president Mojaddedi, Pir Gailani, and Hamid Karzai. We have supported this effort publicly and privately to get Afghans involved directly in the search for peace. We have also been in direct contact with His Majesty Zahir Shah, the former king of Afghanistan, who retains the admiration and good wishes of many inside and outside his country. I met with him in Rome on November 16. We admire those Afghans who are striving to bind their nation's wounds. Moderate Afghans have often been under threat from extremists for their efforts and these threats are indeed real. We condemn the despicable murder in Peshawar, Pakistan earlier this year of the wife, son, and bodyguard of prominent neutral and war hero Abdul Haq. We extend to him and to his family our deepest sympathies. This was a cowardly act of terrorism of the worst sort. U.S. policy Let me conclude by summarizing U.S. policy with respect to the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. The United States supports no individual Afghan faction but maintains contacts with all to further progress toward a peaceful settlement. We recognize none of the contending factions as the Government of Afghanistan and have no plans to do so. We would be prepared to recognize a Government of Afghanistan that was broad-based, multiethnic, and representative and respected international norms of behavior on issues of concern to the world community including terrorism, narcotics, and human rights, particularly the rights of women and girls and minorities. We believe that only such a government could bring peace to Afghanistan and gain the acceptance of other nations and represent Afghanistan effectively in international organizations. But while we are neutral regarding the factions, we are emphatically not neutral regarding their behavior and criticize or encourage them as we see fit. Unfortunately there has been little of an encouraging note in recent years. Thus we continue to be actively engaged in this effort on several fronts, in the U.N., in Washington, in the region, and elsewhere. Our efforts have not yet met with success. The fighting continues, the Afghan people suffer, the effects of the conflict spill over into neighboring lands and beyond. But as I have said before, without our direct involvement, this conflict will likely only continue to fester causing even greater damage to our own interests and to those of the Afghan people. summary statement of hon. julia taft Senator McConnell. We have a vote at 2:45, which is the only vote we will have today because of the snow. I think what I will do is call a brief recess, let Senator Leahy and myself go over and catch this vote right at the beginning, and then we will be back and we will be able to finish the rest of the hearing. [A brief recess was taken.] Senator McConnell. Secretary Taft, why do you not pick right up there, and we will pose our questions after you finish. We will make your entire statement a part of the record. Ms. Taft. Thank you very much, sir. I am really very pleased to be here not only to represent the humanitarian face of the foreign policy, but also to speak to what we consider one of the most horrific situations in terms of human rights and refugee crises in the world. One of my first visits as Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugees, and Migration was to go to Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to look firsthand at what is one of the largest, longest-standing and most complex humanitarian concerns in the world. It has remained a central preoccupation of our Bureau and we have had to make a number of shifts both in resources and in program concepts to adapt to the new challenges of humanitarian assistance requirements created by the Taliban. Let me just speak for a minute. My colleague, Assistant Secretary Inderfurth, went into very good detail about the situation, but I wanted to add a brief description of what happened 20 years ago. I think he started 10 years ago. Some 20 years ago, when the Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan, the flow that was precipitated mostly to Iran and to Pakistan, was 6 million refugees, and now the count is down to about 2.4 million refugees, 1.2 million in Pakistan and the remaining in Iran. When we think about the 4 million people who went back to Afghanistan, they went back beginning in 1989 and are still trickling back in today. But 4 million people have gone back to what they thought was going to be freedom and a new life, and you have described quite well what they have found. During this period of time, Pakistan has remained a very generous country of first asylum. Over the course of 20 years, they have hosted a total of over 3 million people. Now it is 1.2 million. They are getting very tired, and you will see reports that various officials in the northwest frontier province are saying they want to put everybody back into refugee camps. Well, they cannot even find these people. Many of them have already integrated into the local economy. They have established their lives. They have really fit into Pakistan fairly well, even though they are Afghans. But this is because many of them not only have been there for 20 years, but also they are in Pashtun origin and could fit into the economy fairly well of the northwest frontier province. There are, however, new refugees coming out of Afghanistan, and Pakistan has not allowed them to be registered. We are looking very closely and working with the UNHCR to make sure these people are identified and provided services because we believe there is a protection mandate that is critical here and much more needs to be done. In the mid-1990's when repatriation appeared to be a durable solution, the UNHCR and all of the implementing partners really started focusing on Afghanistan. That was where people were going to be going back to. That was where there should be projects for schools and hospitals, et cetera. The programs for first asylum in Pakistan shrunk considerably. While the focus was on Afghanistan, donations to UNHCR programs in Pakistan declined because there was no longer much of a first asylum requirement. We have now soberly realized collectively that repatriation is not as viable as it should be in Afghanistan, and in fact the people who are still in Pakistan probably are not going to go back to Afghanistan anytime soon. So, we are in a position now of having to try to reestablish some school programs, reestablish health services for women and girls in particular. We think those programs in Pakistan may be the best chance for these girls to get education in their lifetime. So, we are starting these over again. This has just been within the past year, and we have put in substantial funding for those. I can go into detail later if you are interested in exactly what we are doing, but we are putting in about $3.3 million for women and girls' programs, primarily in Pakistan. We are also, however, still supporting the UNHCR generally at 25 percent for their appeals, and we are supporting their requests for support for people who do want to go back into Afghanistan. It is a choice of the refugees themselves whether they choose to return, and for those who self-select to return, we are offering assistance through the UNHCR for initial cash and food. For resettlement outside of Pakistan and Afghanistan, we do have a program of resettlement that we are restarting. Again, this is connected to our own refugee resettlement program in the United States. Out of the total of 78,000 refugees that we will bring to the United States this year, we expect maybe 500 will come from Afghan refugees who are in Pakistan. We have a particular focus for those people we would resettle in the States: Those who are Afghan, educated women, or women particularly vulnerable with children who have virtually no hope of making a satisfactory adjustment in Pakistan or in Afghanistan. Now, we have identified more than 700 candidates. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is helping us. However, the INS must schedule a circuit ride, so we will be hoping to get some of these people approved for admission within the next month or so. I would also like to say that Iran has also been a generous host to Afghan refugees. They have absorbed about 3 million during this 20-year period. They are now down to 1.4 million. Unlike the approach that was taken initially in Pakistan, most of the refugees that went to Iran were just allowed to go into the economy, so there have never been any big camps or any big programs for those in Iran. Only about 25,000 have been in camps. Recently, however, the Iranian economy has really taken a slump, and Iran's welcome for the refugees seems to have diminished. We have reports that there have been some involuntary repatriations of Afghan refugees along the border. We have been unable to substantiate those because the UNHCR is unable to go into Afghanistan for security reasons. So, we do not know exactly what this refoulment problem might be. We are considering--but we have no recommendation to either to make our fellow colleagues in the State Department or in fact to Congress, but we are considering perhaps some augmented NGO programs in Iran which would supplement what the UNHCR is doing because of the conditions becoming apparently more severe. There will be an NGO meeting in April in Iran to look at requirements for human services for these refugees. If we get some ideas about particular approaches that we could support, we stand ready to assist. With regard to the focus of our assistance in Afghanistan, ever since the refugees started repatriating, we have funded about 25 percent of the UNHCR programs. But in addition to that, we have supported the ICRC, and, in fact, the International Committee for the Red Cross programs is the only program that has stayed in Afghanistan all these years. They did not even leave last summer with all of the security problems and the change of circumstances. So, we continue to fund them fulsomely, and we are funding NGO programs for pharmaceuticals, for health care, for some school programs, and some refugee repatriation programs that are in rural areas. I have seen these programs. At least I saw them last year. Even though the expatriate staff is no longer in Afghanistan, these programs are still going on to a modest degree. We are hoping at some point soon we will be able to infuse more resources and actually get some expatriate oversight of these programs soon. That leads me to the biggest issue that we have outside of the human rights concerns with Taliban, and that is the security of relief workers. The biggest problem that we have is trying to secure agreements with the Taliban to allow U.N. staff and NGO's the kind of access they need and the personal security they need to return permanently. Negotiations have been ongoing for at least a year, not just on security, but a year ago there were major criticisms of the Taliban with regard to the access by women and girls to various services. Negotiations were conducted at that time between the U.N. and the Taliban to ensure that all of the programs would provide gender equity. As soon as those negotiations were started, there became real security concerns, and unfortunately the U.N. had to withdraw. We are just getting reports now that the U.N. has completed its security assessment. It is reporting to New York on its recommendations about the return of U.N. workers and NGO's to Afghanistan. We have not had a full briefing on this, so I am not able to give you the details. We are concerned about workers going back, but expect the U.N. to have made an appropriate assessment. If the workers are able to go back and the U.N. is able to improve its presence, we think that donors will be more forthcoming in terms of their new assistance inside of Afghanistan, and we are hoping that that will at least provide appropriate monitors, witnesses, a presence, a western presence to try to make sure that the vulnerable people of that society are getting the assistance that we expect. It is a grim picture, but what I have tried to convey is it is a fairly realistic one. We are going to again focus our attention on Pakistan where we can reach the refugee girls and women and do what we can to improve the services inside of Afghanistan when the security is more appropriate. With those comments, let me just summarize by saying that the U.S. Government's total contributions range upwards of $30 million, if you consider all the food that is going into the various assistance programs. We expect from the Bureau of Population, Refugee, and Migration Assistance Act we are going to be funding probably close to $20 million this year on these programs for refugees as well as people inside of Afghanistan. prepared statement With that, let me just thank you for your attention on this subject. We are really grateful for the assistance the NGO's have given, Physicians for Human Rights and others who have called into international attention concerns about the plight of the people of Afghanistan. We stand ready to work with you and any other way we can to make sure that we can reach those who deserve our assistance. Thank you. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Julia V. Taft I am pleased to be able to speak today on the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. One of my first field visits as Assistant Secretary for PRM was to Pakistan and Afghanistan to look into what is one of the largest, longest-standing, and most complex humanitarian situations in the world. It has remained a central concern of our Bureau as we have had to shift resources and programs to adapt to the new challenges to humanitarian assistance created by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Twenty years ago, Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan, precipitating the flow of more than six million refugees to Pakistan and Iran. The official count today is 2.4 million and over 4 million refugees have gone back to Afghanistan since the withdrawal of the Soviets in 1989. Those remaining in exile have been in place long enough that the third generation is being born. At the same time, ongoing warfare and Taliban repression continue to generate new refugees. Within Afghanistan, one million or more Afghans are displaced from their homes. Nearly all Afghans are impoverished by the devastation of war. Recent severe earthquakes only seem to compound Afghanistan's misery. A/S Inderfurth has outlined for you what the USG is doing to promote a political solution to the situation in Afghanistan. I will focus on humanitarian concerns. While the humanitarian situation ultimately can only be effectively addressed with a political solution, there are things that we can and are doing to try to ameliorate the current situation of vulnerable people--particularly refugees in Pakistan and Iran. Unfortunately, what we can accomplish for vulnerable populations in Afghanistan is severely limited by the security situation and by Taliban policies. I will start with the refugees. refugees in pakistan Pakistan has been a very generous country of first asylum. Over the course of 20 years, they have hosted some three million refugees, 1.2 million of whom remain in Pakistan at this time. The largest group of Afghans in Pakistan--probably a significant majority--have been in Pakistan so long and are so well-established that they are not likely to return. They are preponderantly Pashtun who have integrated into the economy. The bulk of the remainder live in refugee camps close to the border and would likely return. Also mostly Pashtun, they are being held back by economic or other practical considerations, like schools and health care, rather than fear of persecution. Their needs are likely for targeted repatriation and reintegration assistance. There are also refugees in Pakistan who are sometimes referred to as the Afghan elite, or intelligentsia. Located mostly in Peshawar, they are relatively affluent but could not return to a Taliban Afghanistan. These may be candidates for resettlement in third countries and we are particularly looking at female heads of household who are experiencing difficulty in remaining in Pakistan and now would be particularly vulnerable if they return to Afghanistan. And, there are the new arrivals, who fled from the Taliban after its recent victories. These refugees only began arriving in Pakistan (and Iran) in late 1998. While Pakistan does not register refugees, it does grant prima facie status to all Afghans. We believe there are real needs for relief and protection for these new arrivals and have been working with UNHCR to address these needs--especially to ensure that protection is adequate. When, in the mid-1990s, repatriation appeared to be the durable solution after the retreat of the Soviets, UNHCR and its implementing partners began to scale back care and maintenance programs dramatically, leaving in place modest efforts on behalf of the most vulnerable. Facing many new complex humanitarian emergencies around the world, donors were happy to re-direct their resources to more needy populations. However, repatriation has slowed. New refugees are arriving. And the Taliban's policies and actions--particularly as regards women, girls, and minorities--have horrified the world. In response, we have reversed our phase-out strategy and last year funded a number of new or renewed NGO assistance projects in Pakistan. In infusing new funding, we have focused our efforts on women in recognition of the central importance of women's well-being to the well-being of their children and entire families. Health and education for women and girls are the prime project areas. This may be one of the few opportunities that the international community has to address educational needs of Afghan women and girls in the near future. We are also continuing our financial support to UNHCR's repatriation program. While some have suggested that no refugees, particularly women, should return to Afghanistan while the Taliban is in control there, ultimately this is a decision that the refugees themselves must make. Our assistance through UNHCR would provide initial cash and food for those refugees who self-select to return. refugees in iran Like Pakistan, Iran has been a rather generous host to as many as three million Afghan refugees, of whom 1.4 million reside there today. Only a handful of refugees (about 25,000) were held in camps, with most allowed to integrate into the economy--at least until 1992, after which time new refugees have been less able to obtain the required residency documents. With the Iranian economy in a slump, Iran's welcome for Afghan refugees has diminished. Since December Iran has reportedly returned 15,000 or more Afghans to Afghanistan. It is not entirely clear who is being expelled or under what circumstances, but it may be a mixture of economic migrants and refugees, and a mixture of voluntary and forced repatriation. Although there are no reports of Taliban mistreatment of returnees, because of security concerns, UNHCR does not have an expatriate presence in Afghanistan to protect returnees. Most assistance in Iran is provided by the government. UNHCR has provided some reimbursement for health services and complementary aid in the camps. UNHCR began to reorient care and maintenance efforts toward self-reliance in 1997. A European coalition of NGOs--the International Consortium for Refugees in Iran (ICRI)--plans a symposium in April in Iran to engender additional knowledge of refugee needs, particularly in education. We will watch the outcome of this conference closely for new information about refugees in Iran. Before seeking to address any unmet needs of Afghan refugees in Iran other than through UNHCR, we would certainly want to consult with Congress. humanitarian situation in afghanistan Let me turn to the humanitarian situation inside Afghanistan. There hardly appears to be a corner of Afghanistan not touched and impoverished by decades of conflict. There are other countries where the USG is working to provide humanitarian assistance that have been similarly devastated. Liberia and Cambodia come immediately to mind. But there are few where the authorities systematically present so many challenges to the provision of humanitarian assistance. Most attention on the Taliban's human rights record has been focussed on their mistreatment of women. Indeed, the Taliban violate the human rights of almost all Afghans in ways ranging from restrictions on political and religious freedoms to the horrific murder of thousands of people in Mazar-i-Sharif last summer. The Taliban maintain that the measures they have taken concerning women are for women's own protection. Regardless of what their intent is, the effect of their policies is to strip women of their human rights, and to seriously damage the physical well-being of women by denying them healthcare and employment. In our view, the greatest problems facing Afghan women are poverty, lack of education, and lack of health care. The actions of the Taliban which most trouble us are: --the denial of employment outside the home to women, which by denying women a livelihood is directly life-threatening, especially to Afghanistan's thousands of war-widows; --the denial of education to girls; --and a combination of restrictions on movement, employment of women health workers, and treatment of women by male doctors, which together limit women's access to health care. The USG is committed to provision of humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan, notwithstanding our strong disagreements with the Taliban on human rights, narcotics, and terrorism issues. This is consistent with the overall USG policy of trying to address humanitarian needs of vulnerable populations, even in countries with which we have strong political disagreements. The international community unanimously concluded at the Tokyo meeting of the Afghan Support Group in December to push for secure access by the U.N. and NGOs throughout Afghanistan and to fund humanitarian programs on a basis of gender equality. And foreign ministers of those parties engaged in trying to resolve the political situation in Afghanistan--the ``6+2''--have called for resumption of humanitarian assistance as soon as possible. The international and non-governmental organizations with whom we are working are all desperately anxious to be able to work freely to meet the needs of vulnerable Afghans, especially women and girls. But, as you well know, there are major constraints to international humanitarian action in Afghanistan. First, security. The ongoing conflict continues to inflict damage, impede reconstruction, and impair the security of both Afghans and aid workers. Moreover, there are still questions about the Taliban's commitment to ensuring security. Last August, most expatriate humanitarian workers were withdrawn from Afghanistan following the murder and kidnapping of some humanitarian staff. The U.N. and the Taliban subsequently concluded an MOU on the security protocol for return. We firmly support the U.N. position that expatriate staff not return until credible guarantees are in place. We and other donors have urged NGOs not to return expat staff until U.N. expat staff return. Some have nonetheless returned and we know that there are differing views on this issue. However, particularly given the need to improve the security situation of humanitarian workers worldwide, we have believed that the NGO community should maintain solidarity with the U.N. on the security issue. We have given our concerns about the current security situation to the U.N., and drawn their attention in particular to the threat posed by Osama Bin Laden. The U.N. is currently intensively reviewing the security situation. Second, Taliban policies and reprehensible human rights record. The USG has been unstinting in both our condemnation of Taliban human rights violations--particularly against women and girls--and in our efforts to promote a united donor front that will enable us to engage the Taliban on changing its repressive policies. We have publicly condemned the Taliban's human rights violations in multiple fora--for example the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women, the U.N. Security Council, and the Afghan Support Group. But beyond the human rights issue, the Taliban's position on women constrains the delivery of humanitarian assistance, because it challenges the basic humanitarian principle that such assistance must be available equally to beneficiaries, without regard to gender, race, or other characteristics. The international community has remained firm in the conviction that the most effective levers to ensure appropriate assistance to Afghanistan is through a Principled Common Program--under the direction of UNOCHA--the U.N. Coordinator for Afghanistan. ``Principled'' refers to the goal of having all assistance programs conform to standards that require gender equity in access to project benefits, that require non- discrimination against minorities (e.g., Shia, non-Pashtuns), that include reference to the cross-cutting goal of drug control, and that avoid giving undue power to the Taliban authorities while focusing on local capacity building. ``Common'' refers to donor agreement to abide by the same basic principles and to the idea of integrated, mutually reinforcing project development. For the moment, there is agreement among all major donors on several operating principles: --donors should seek to fund what is in the UNOCHA appeal and not use scarce funds on activities that are outside of the appeal; --no U.N. expatriates should return to Afghanistan until the Taliban has implemented the terms of the security MOU and given credible assurances on security; --NGOs should be encouraged to follow the U.N. in keeping expatriates out of Afghanistan; --humanitarian agencies should not submit to the mahram edict (that is the Taliban policy that requires Muslim women--even non- Afghans--to be accompanied in public by a close male relative) ; --projects that do not protect the human rights of women, girls, and minorities should not be funded; --urgent humanitarian assistance should not be subject to conditionality but development assistance or other new assistance could be subjected to conditionality on human rights principles and drug control; I would not be honest if I did not say that it is difficult to maintain consensus on all such issues as time goes on, especially given the tensions created by the keen desire to resume full international humanitarian assistance inside Afghanistan. As an illustration of the difficulty, take the issue of assistance in Kabul. Some donors will not fund any programs in Kabul, believing that Taliban restrictions there make it impossible to provide assistance on a principled basis. Other donors take a project-by-project approach, funding programs. The U.N., for its part, has decided to provide only ``life-saving'' assistance in Kabul. About ten days ago, I chaired a monthly coordination meeting that we have with the NGO sector of the international humanitarian assistance community and with USAID. U.S.-based NGOs represented there could not agree on whether urgent aid should be limited to ``lifesaving''. Or even on the definition. All more or less agreed that education was not strictly lifesaving; but we would all be loath to not provide education to women and girls where possible. At that same meeting, some NGO representatives argued that it would be wrong to provide assistance to those refugees repatriating because that could be construed as promoting--or even forcing--return to an Afghanistan that does not respect the rights of all of its citizens. Others--equally passionately--argued that it would be wrong to deny help to those who want to go home of their own free will. In fact, as a practical matter, unless we are prepared to use some kind of force, the USG may neither tell a refugee when to return home nor prevent him or her from doing so. usg assistance As I conclude my remarks today, I would like to outline for you what my Bureau and its partner USG agencies are doing in terms of funding. I believe that you all have received as background for this hearing a detailed accounting of PRM assistance for Afghan refugees and conflict victims over the last five years. Our assistance for Afghan refugees has been ongoing now for 19 years. In the last fiscal year--fiscal year 1998--PRM provided some $8.3 million in earmarked contributions through international and non- governmental organizations. Of that amount, over $3.3 million was for projects that specifically targeted programs for Afghan women and girls, including $1.5 million for education and health in Pakistan. An additional $14.8 million was contributed to the general regional appeals for UNHCR and ICRC--a significant proportion of the latter was for programs for Afghans in Afghanistan. Also in fiscal year 1998: --USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance provided nearly $7 million for earthquake relief and for internally displaced and other vulnerable persons inside Afghanistan. --The U.S. pledge of food commodities was 100,000 tons of wheat to Afghanistan for delivery via the U.N. World Food Program. --Important complementary assistance for demining ($2 million), counternarcotics ($1.54 million) and U.N. coordination ($500,000) came from several State Department accounts. For this current fiscal year, we anticipate that PRM funding will be at least at the level of last year, though, as I have indicated, we do not know at this point just what kind of assistance will be able to be implemented inside Afghanistan. Other assistance already decided for this year includes: --$2 million in demining assistance from the NADR program, --100,000 MT of wheat from the USDA Section 416 (b) program, --$500,000 for UNOCHA coordination from the IO Bureau, and --$25,000 to date from USAID/OFDA for earthquake relief. --In addition, our Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor has committed to contributing $200,000 in fiscal year 1999 Human Rights and Democracy Funds to the U.N. Consolidated Appeal for Afghanistan. The funds would be targeted to women's democracy/ human rights advocacy-building programs within the Appeal. The South Asia bureau has agreed to commit $200,000 from its fiscal year 1999 ESF regional democracy funds for the same type of programs in the Appeal specifically targeting Afghan women. While third-country resettlement may not be the appropriate durable solution for Afghan refugees in general, there are certain refugees who are at risk because of the Taliban takeover and who cannot integrate locally in Pakistan. Of particular concern are educated urban women, as well as widows and single heads of household. We expect to resettle several hundred such refugees in the United States. To ensure that these cases are adjudicated promptly, we have authorized the hiring of an experienced case worker in Islamabad to supplement the efforts of the NGO and INS processing personnel that visit Pakistan periodically on circuit rides. expectations for 1999 Unfortunately, there seems little prospect that the Taliban will make major changes soon in their human rights policies. So we expect the present situation of chronic conflict and repressive rule by a presumptive authority that falls short of being a government to continue. Meeting basic human needs of many Afghans is likely to continue to depend on international assistance. At the same time, the environment for delivering that assistance is likely to remain difficult and dangerous. Even if the situation improves to the point where international aid workers can return to Afghanistan, every day is likely to bring a struggle with Taliban interference and restrictions, and poverty and lack of infrastructure. This is a grim picture, but, we believe, a realistic one. Against this backdrop, let me say once again that the USG is committed to provision of humanitarian assistance, even under difficult circumstances, that responds to the needs of Afghan refugees, conflict victims, and vulnerable--especially the women and girls. I would be happy to respond to additional questions that you may have. strike against osama bin laden Senator McConnell. Thank you, Ms. Taft. Mr. Inderfurth, could you outline for me what you think the benefits were of the strike against Osama bin Laden? Mr. Inderfurth. The strike on August 20th against his training facilities in Afghanistan we think sent a very powerful message to him and to his supporters and to those around the world that were watching that the United States would, indeed, respond to attacks on U.S. interests wherever they may occur. We think that there has been a practical effect, which is a disruption of his activities. He has clearly been since that time much more on the move and on guard with respect to his activities. We have not been successful in accomplishing our objective of seeing him expelled from Afghanistan and brought to justice. We are continuing to make that effort, not only by those of us working in the diplomatic field--and I had meetings in Islamabad on February 3rd with Taliban officials to underscore the points that I made in my testimony and we are discussing here--but also others within the U.S. Government that are working on this problem quite literally around the clock. There is no question that there was disruption. There is no question that they got a very powerful message, but there is also no question that bin Laden remains a threat. And as we have said to the Taliban and to others, we reserve the right to act again either preemptively or in retaliation for terrorist activities undertaken or planned by bin Laden. Senator McConnell. So, no progress on the effort to locate and extradite him? Mr. Inderfurth. Mr. Chairman, in terms of the location of bid Laden, we do believe that he remains in Afghanistan itself despite some earlier reports that he may have left or that he had left Taliban-controlled territory. I would rather have a closed discussion with you about his location and what we actually know about that. His expulsion. We have seen no effort by the Taliban to expel, but again we believe that certain steps have been taken that have disrupted his activities that have made it more difficult for him to communicate, that he seems to be moving around a great deal. But we still believe that he has the capability to harm U.S. interests and we are going to pursue that. Senator McConnell. How do you see the Russian-Iranian relationship in the context of the Afghan problem? Mr. Inderfurth. Both the Russians and the Iranians have supported the Northern Alliance, the principal opposition to the Taliban. They have supplied certain materiel over the years to the Northern Alliance. I think a map has been attached to my testimony of the 15 percent or so that remains in Northern Alliance hands of Afghanistan. This is principally Commander Masood in the Panshir Valley. It is our view, as I stated in my testimony, that there can be no military solution to what is taking place in Afghanistan. Despite the fact the Taliban has increased its hold over the country geographically, we do not believe that they will be able to subjugate the country and to exert total control, that there will continue to be resistance in part because other countries with an interest there continue to supply those forces opposed to the Taliban. So, both the Russians and the Iranians remain involved in that fashion. They also remain involved diplomatically. They are part of the so-called Six plus Two process, and we believe that they both would be willing, based on our contacts with them, to work constructively if the Taliban were willing to sit down at the table with the other factions and to start working toward a peaceful resolution to establish a broad-based government. Senator McConnell. How have somewhat similar views of this problem affected our relationship with Iran? Mr. Inderfurth. I cannot speak beyond the Six plus Two process. I have taken part in those meetings in New York. Secretary Albright was there last September where she took part at a ministerial of the Six plus Two. The Iranians have, as I said, been engaged in that. We have had exchanges across the table. They have been constructive in their comments. I believe that, for reasons that Assistant Secretary Taft has pointed out, they want to see this conflict come to an end. They have refugees. They have had dislocations. They are very concerned about the narcotics spillover. Iran has taken very tough measures to deal with narcotics and trafficking, but they have the Hazara Shia minority in Afghanistan that they intend to look after their interests and not to see the Taliban repress them. So, there is their religious, their cultural, their historical connotations here as well as humanitarian. The Iranians I think are willing to work for a positive solution there, but in the meantime, until the Taliban indicates its willingness to come to the table, Iran will continue to take those actions to support the opposition forces it deems necessary. Senator McConnell. And now the relationship between Pakistan and the Taliban, particularly in view of the fact that the Pakistanis now have 3 million drug addicts. Describe for me again this relationship and also the apparent lack of concern or maybe there is concern that I do not sense here of the Pakistanis with regard to the drug problem that they now have. Mr. Inderfurth. Pakistan has been over time the principal supporter of the Taliban. As Senator Leahy pointed out, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have been the two principal backers of the Taliban. The only other country to officially recognize the Taliban is the UAE. That is the sum total of diplomatic recognition of the Taliban. Pakistan is the country most affected by the Afghan conflict and has been going back to the Soviet era. As Assistant Secretary Taft pointed out, the refugee problem is well known and Pakistan has responded in a very compassionate fashion over the years to that, and that problem continues. They have become increasingly affected by the narcotics trafficking that takes place and the number of addicts that we now see in Pakistan. Indeed, Pakistan is taking some important steps with respect to cooperation with the U.S. on narcotics. This year we were able to fully certify cooperation with Pakistan on our counter-narcotics efforts. They received full certification in this last presidential finding. But the drug situation in Afghanistan continues to get worse. Despite protestations by the Taliban that they are taking steps to eliminate this and that this is un-Islamic, we have seen little evidence of that. And Pakistan is having that spillover effect of the narcotics as well as terrorism. There is no question that some of the terrorists that are being trained in Afghanistan are affecting the internal situation in Pakistan itself, which leads us to the view that Pakistan is beginning to understand that what is taking place in Afghanistan under the Taliban is adversely affecting the national interests of Pakistan and that its support for the Taliban must reflect that. We are encouraging Pakistan to use its influence--and it has more than any other country--to move the Taliban toward the negotiating table. We are encouraging Pakistan to use its influence on terrorist issues, not just bin Laden, but the camps that are there that would remain even after he left. There is no question that internally this is a subject of debate within the Pakistani Government. We believe Prime Minister "
