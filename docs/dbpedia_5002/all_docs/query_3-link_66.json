        "text": "Lin-Manuel Miranda and Brooklyn-based actor, writer, and singer-songwriter Eisa Davis have announced a concept album that is inspired by the cult 1979 film The Warriors. They made the new album with executive producer Nas and producer Mike Elizondo. According to a press release, the 26-song effort “features a star-studded cast of voices” that will be revealed soon.\n\nAtlantic Records will release Miranda and Davis’ album, Warriors, on October 18. In a joint press statement, the artists said, “We’ve spent the past three years musicalizing the Warriors’ journey home, from the South Bronx to Coney Island. Along the way we’ve gotten to work with a lot of our favorite artists, and we’ll be announcing their roles on the album in the weeks ahead. We can’t wait to share these songs with you on October 18.”\n\nWalter Hill directed the 1979 Warriors film, which is based on Sol Yurick’s 1965 novel of the same name. The Warriors tells the story of a New York street gang that makes its way from the Bronx down to Coney Island after the group is framed for the murder of a powerful gang leader named Cyrus. The movie is perhaps best known for actor David Patrick Kelly’s taunting lines, in character as Luther, “Warriors, come out to play-ay!”"
