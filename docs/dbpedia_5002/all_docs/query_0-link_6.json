        "text": "To all of my friends outside of Israel, I’d like to give you a fact-based update from the ground. Please do not look away. On Oct 7, 2023: 1. Thousands of Hamas rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, hitting cities as far north as Tel Aviv. 2. Thousands of Hamas terrorists breached the Gaza border in southern Israel. 3. The Hamas terrorists went into civilian family homes and brutally slaughtered, as of this post, at least 600 babies, children, women, men, the elderly, and their caretakers. Houses were set ablaze, and entire families were burnt alive or butchered when they ran out. 4. The terrorists took at least a hundred Israeli babies, children, women, men, and the elderly into Gaza as hostages. The bodies of the dead were danced and spit on in the streets of Gaza in front of cheering crowds. Hostage Israeli children were beaten by Gazan children. We know these facts because Hamas proudly recorded and live-streamed the events. Israel’s intelligence, military, and government were caught off guard in a tragically similar way to the Yom Kippur War, which happened on the same weekend 50 years ago. Even then, civilians were not the front line of defense. This nightmare, and this evil, is far worse. In the coming days, Israel will organize and respond in a manner never before seen. It will likely take months, but we will completely destroy the Hamas terror organization, return our hostages, and ensure this unfathomable tragedy can never occur again. Never again. This war will also come at a very heavy cost to innocent Palestinian civilians whom Hamas cowardly use as human shields. A historic human tragedy with no winners. Hamas is backed by Iran’s radical Islamic leadership, who share Hamas’s stated goal of the destruction of the State of Israel and the death of all Jews. They believe they are the winners because this war delays the normalization of Israeli-Saudi relations, representing an existential risk to their regime. Their loss will be made clear to them in due time. As the war unfolds, your media, on cue, will flip the narrative to drive clicks and gaslight anti-zionism and anti-semitism. The term “disproportionate response” will run across breaking news tickers in heavy rotation. Your politicians will call for restraint and ceasefires. Your own judgment will transition from the horror of the facts above to innocent calls for love and peace between two warring armies. Hamas has proven that they can organize as an army, and we will deal with them accordingly, but what happened here isn't human. It's pure evil. If you support Hamas or their actions, you support terror. You support hate and darkness. You support brutal crimes against humanity. You don’t have to love or defend Israel, we’ll take care of that, I just ask you to check your soul and place in history. 10/7 is our 9/11. As you watch the news in the coming weeks, remember this before forming an opinion about Israel's unprecedented response. #AmIsraelChai"
