        "text": "Nearly 40 years ago, writer-director Walter Hill introduced American audiences to a new vision of New York City street gangs with the release of The Warriors. The movieâabout a Coney Island gang trying to make it home from the Bronx after being framed for the murder of the cityâs most powerful warlordâis a cult classic today. But its initial release in 1979 was surrounded by controversy.\n\nReports of violence, vandalism, and even three homicides were linked to screenings of the film, prompting Paramount Pictures to offer to pay the costs for additional security at theaters nationwide. It was a reaction that surprised Hill, who had always intended for The Warriors, which he adapted from Sol Yurickâs novel, to be seen as a fantasy film. âI felt very strongly that it certainly was not a very realistic book, and I wanted to make it even less so,â Hill recently recalled to Esquire. âI wanted to take it into a fantasy element, but at the same time add some contemporary flash.â\n\nThe genre intentions may have been lost on some audience members at the time, but the film has endured. Itâs still regularly screened at repertory theaters and a favorite midnight movie. It has also been turned into a comic book series and a popular video game. Now, weâre paying tribute to The Warriorsâ real starsâthe fictional street gangs who assembled for that midnight summit back in 1979.\n\n1. THE WARRIORS\n\nOkay, so this oneâs a gimme. The titular gang from Coney Island set the pace and plot of the film, as they attempt to make their way from the Bronx to Brooklyn after being framed for the murder of Cyrus, The Gramercy Riffsâ leader. Unfortunately for The Warriors, theyâre being pursued by the rest of the gangs on this list.\n\n2. THE GRAMERCY RIFFS\n\nIn the hierarchy of street gangs, The Gramercy Riffs are at the very top. And itâs their leaderâCyrusâwho organizes the midnight summit in Van Cortlandt Park that sets off the plot. Cyrus requests that each of the cityâs gangs send a handful of (unarmed) members to discuss how they might begin collaborating with each other instead of competing. Itâs a groundbreaking idea, but itâs short-lived; Cyrus is gunned down in the midst of sharing his vision. The Rogues are the ones who did it, but they successfully manage to blame the murder on The Warriors. And the chase beginsâ¦\n\n3. THE ROGUES\n\nâThe Roguesâ is an appropriate name for this Hellâs Kitchen crew, as they operate by their own set of rules. Itâs their leader, Luther, who is the real shooter, and also the first to point the finger at The Warriors. Luther also has a knack for offering up some of the filmâs most memorable catchphrases. Though actor David Patrick Kelly has long been credited with improvising the now-famous âWaaaaarriors, come out to plaaaayâ line, he insists it was Hill. âIâll take credit for the bottles and how I said it,â Kelly told Entertainment Weekly in 2012. âBut I remember him kicking in the lines.â\n\n4. TURNBULL ACâS\n\nThe Turnbull ACâs are easy to recognize for two reasons: Theyâre all bald, and they ride around the city in an old bus. Itâs that same bus that the gang uses to try and run down The Warriors shortly after the summit breaks up (the Turnbull ACâs are the first group The Warriors must face off against).\n\n5. THE ORPHANS\n\nThe Orphans, who reside in the Tremont neighborhood of the Bronx, arenât the most sophisticated of the filmâs street gangs. So much so that they werenât even invited to the summit. As Warrior member Fox says of their reputation: âTheyâre so far down, theyâre not even on the map.â Ouch! Of all the gangs they encounter, The Orphans are the most pleasant, at least at first, and even agree to let The Warriors pass through their neighborhood problem-free. But they change their minds about playing nice when a local girl, Mercy, calls their leader âchickenâ for not defending his territory. The encounter comes to an abrupt end when a Molotov cocktail makes an appearance.\n\n6. THE BASEBALL FURIES\n\nThe Baseball Furies take their identity seriously, with each member decked out in a Yankees-style baseball uniform. Which may not seem all that frightening ... until they whip out their baseball bats.\n\n7. THE LIZZIES\n\nThe all-girl Lizzies use their feminine wiles to coax three of The Warriors back to their pad near Union Square, and come closer than any other gang to capturingâand killingâthe titular crew. Fortunately for The Warriors, the gals donât have great aim. Theyâre able to escape relatively unscathed (even if they did need to punch and break a chair over the head of a couple of their female counterparts).\n\n8. THE PUNKS\n\nWeâre not sure whatâs so âpunkâ about pairing denim overalls with a rugby shirt. Or a pair of roller skates. But The Punks do reside in the Bowery, so the name is at least somewhat appropriate. As is the fact that their defeat begins with a can of spray paint. Â\n\n9. THE BOPPERS\n\nThe Harlem-based Boppers look more like a boy band than a street gang to be reckoned with, but they are very much the latter.\n\n10. THE HURRICANES\n\nThe Boppersâ main rivals are the Spanish Harlem-based Hurricanes, who make only a brief appearance in the film, at Cyrusâ summit.\n\n11. THE HI-HATS\n\nThe SoHo-based Hi-Hats might be the best proof Hill has got that he intended for The Warriors to be a fantasy film. Because clowns are scary, and mimes are not.\n\n12. THE ELECTRIC ELIMINATORS\n\nAlso based in SoHo are The Electric Eliminators, rivals to the Hi-Hats, who are seen twice in the film: first as they make their way to the summit, in their satin yellow bomber jackets, and later in the confusion following Cyrusâ murder.\n\n13. THE SARACENS\n\nThe Electric Eliminators pal around with The Saracens, who are based in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. And do a fine job of making black tank tops look intimidating.\n\n14. THE JONES STREET BOYS\n\nThe Jones Street Boys also hail from Bensonhurst, so they arenât fans of The Saracens. Their only appearance in the film is at the summit (theyâre the bumblebee-looking dudes in yellow and black stripes).\n\n15. THE SAVAGE HUNS\n\nThe Savage Huns of Chinatown are seen twice in the movie: once as they wait for the train uptown, and again as part of the crowd at the summit. Though the filmmakers did a great job of making the summit seem jam-packed, Hill says âI doubt if we had more than 200 to 300 people at a time, though we tried to make it look like more.â\n\n16. THE SATANS MOTHERS\n\nThe Savage Hunsâ rivals, the Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn-based Satans Mothers, are the movieâs only motorcycle gang. And apparently not big on possessive punctuation.\n\n17. THE BOYLE AVENUE RUNNERS\n\nWhen it comes to Queens-based street gangs, The Boyle Avenue Runners are it as far as The Warriors goes.\n\n18. THE MOONRUNNERS\n\nThe Moonrunners make their way to Van Cortlandt park from their own turf in the Bronx, in Pelham. They may look ready to jazzercise, but their standard issue necklacesâcomplete with moon pendantsâpay tribute their toughness.\n\n19. THE VAN CORTLANDT RANGERS\n\nThe Moonrunnersâ greatest enemies are The Van Cortlandt Rangers, a.k.a. the VC Rangers, whose fedoras match their striped shirts.\n\n20. THE PANZERS\n\nThe Washington Heights-based Panzers are one of the few gangs who look properly attired for warfare.\n\n21. THE GLADIATORS\n\nNot much is seen or known about the Canarsie, Brooklyn-based Gladiators. Except that they do seem like polite enough men, even paying for their subway tokens and entering through the turnstile in an orderly fashion. (See for yourself at the 2:25 mark.)\n\nSeveral other gangs were included in a list in the official movie script, but are either unidentified on screen or not seen at all. In alphabetical order, they are:\n\nTHE ALLEY CATS\n\nTHE AMSTERDAM ALL-STARS\n\nTHE BLACK HANDS\n\nTHE BLACKJACKS\n\nTHE BIG TRAINS\n\nTHE CHARLEMAGNES\n\nTHE COLT 45âS\n\nTHE DEALERS\n\nTHE DELANEY ROVERS\n\nTHE DINGOS: The Dingos did play a part in the original script when they captured one of The Warriors, but the scene was ultimately cut.\n\nTHE E STREET SHUFFLERS\n\nTHE EASY ACES\n\nTHE EIGHTH AVENUE APACHES\n\nTHE FASTBALLS\n\nTHE FIFTH STREET BOMBERS\n\nTHE FILMORES\n\nTHE FIRETASTERS\n\nTHE FIVE POINTS\n\nTHE GERRARDS\n\nTHE GO HARDS\n\nTHE GUN HILL DANCERS\n\nTHE HOMEBOYS\n\nTHE HOPLITES\n\nTHE HOWITZERS\n\nTHE HIGH ROLLERS\n\nTHE HUKS\n\nTHE IMPS\n\nTHE JESTERS\n\nTHE JUDAS BUNCH\n\nTHE JUPITERS\n\nTHE KNOCKDOWNS"
