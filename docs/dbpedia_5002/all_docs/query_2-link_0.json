        "text": "The goal of Hamas was to provoke an overreaction from Israel. They didn‚Äôt expect a military victory, but their aim was to commit atrocities to leverage Israel‚Äôs aggressive response and rally Muslims worldwide for the cause of Gaza and Palestine, which they have succeeded in doing. In my opinion, although it‚Äôs difficult, Israel should counter with conspicuous and unequivocal acts of kindness while targeting Hamas elite members. However, it's also crucial to understand that killing more people in Gaza could create more Hamas members who seek vengeance. The goal is also to minimize the number of Hamas members being created. An example of engaging in acts of kindness is establishing a mobile hospital in Gaza to ensure there‚Äôs food, water, and medical necessities. Israel should go above and beyond with their efforts, and also make sure they record them.\n\nIs Israel wise enough to not take Hamas' (and Iran's) bait? Hamas and Iran want a devastating response from the IDF. Why? Because in 1-3 days sympathy will shift from the Israelis to the Gazans. From there on the story will be Israel inflicting huge civilian casualties on Gaza. The relatively few Hamas combatants will be rarely shown and in comparison, to the much larger civilian losses, glossed over by the press. Israel needs to look beyond this latest cycle in the Hamas circle of violence. Hamas draws strength from appearing to be (a \"heroic\") small force battling the mighty IDF while the vast preponderance of Arabs sit safely in front of their TV sets. The temporary satisfaction of any Israeli revenge also establishes the conditions for Hamas to survive and grow. If another cycle is to be avoided, Israel needs to fix the intelligence problem and strengthen the area near the Gaza border. Then set out to identify all who planned, executed, and supported the Hamas attack for retribution. There is no negotiation with a group whose sole goal is the destruction of Israel and its people. My opinion.\n\nLife on social media is gradually returning to normalcy. Although, for the first time, we managed to convey the true picture of what is happening in Gaza. Why stop now? Why be complacent? Was this a phase of change for a mood improvement? We should be ashamed of ourselves; children are being killed, and men and women are being subjected to brutality by the Israeli occupation forces. What is happening in Gaza now is genocide, a deliberate policy of displacement carried out by this ruthless army. Do not cease to spread the truth, and let your pens and words find a place in the history being written."
