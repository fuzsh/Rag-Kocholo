        "text": "This article will be published in the September 2015 issue of WIRED magazine. Be the first to read WIRED's articles in print before they're posted online, and get your hands on loads of additional content by subscribing online\n\nWe reveal the 100 most influential individuals in the wider WIRED world, as nominated by more than 200 people in our network. The only rules for nomination to the WIRED 100 are that the individuals must have a strong European connection, if not a base here; and they are being judged on their influence today, rather than historic achievements or funding raised.\n\nFor the WIRED 100, as in each of the past five years, we wanted to identify not success nor wealth, but influence: that special ability to touch the culture, to build scalable success, to connect millions of people. From investors to inventors, engineers to e-commerce innovators, we collated hundreds of suggestions on little paper tabs (paper!) on our office walls, and with the input of the WIRED team put them in order. We excluded anyone from Condé Nast for avoidance of conflict, as well as names not closely linked to Europe.\n\nCheck out the full countdown here:\n\n100\n\nAlexander Llung and Eric Wahlforss\n\nWeb/Other CEO and CTO, Soundcloud, Berlin\n\nSoundCloud faces tough challenges, from copyright claims to the Apple juggernaut. But what gives its founders influence is their 175m monthly users and their visibility as Berlin's iconic social network. Can they persuade enough fans to pay a fee to put the $123m-funded firm in profit?\n\n99\n\nJames Bridle\n\nWeb/Social/Politics Artist/writer, London\n\nAs both a tech writer and artist, 34-year-old Bridle is politically charged and has an influential following. He's one of the first artists to understand the internet and make politically charged works about it. His Instagram project, Dronestagram, plots aerial photographs of unreported drone-strike locations.\n\n98\n\nMike Lynch\n\nTech/investment Founder, Invoke Capital, London\n\nMike Lynch's Autonomy was acquired by HP for $11.7bn, before allegations of cooked books (strongly denied) flew and he was sued for $5.1bn. In 2013, he re-emerged with Invoke Capital and invested £12m in cybersecurity startup Darktrace, which combines expertise from Cambridge University, GCHQ, MI5 and the NSA.\n\n97\n\nNigel Eccles\n\nOther CEO, FanDuel, Edinburgh/New York\n\nSince co-founding FanDuel in 2009 out of Hubdub, a news-prediction startup, Eccles, 40, has seen his fantasy American-football platform expand to host over 30,000 leagues and to secure exclusive rights from the NBA for basketball. In July, a $275 million funding round valued it at more than $1 billion.\n\n96\n\nNiklas Östberg\n\nWeb/Retail CEO, Delivery Hero, Berlin\n\nThe online food ordering startup operates in 34 markets, with 200,000 restaurants delivering ten million orders a month. In September, the company raised $350m, bringing total investment to more than $1bn since Ostberg, 35, founded it in 2011. Its current valuation is $3 billion. His next step? An IPO.\n\n95\n\nAndy McLoughlin\n\nTech/computing Co-founder, Huddle, California/London\n\nMcLoughlin and partner Alastair Mitchell launched their cloud-based co-working software in 2006. By December 2014, with McLoughlin, 36, as executive VP, Huddle was used by 80 per cent of the Fortune 500, and its value was around £1bn. In March he left to work at Silicon Valley VC firm SoftTech.\n\n94\n\nJimmy Wales\n\nWeb Co-founder, Wikipedia, London\n\nThe founder and \"benevolent dictator\" of the web's sixth most popular site has been speaking out against government surveillance and the tech sector's gender gap.

In addition to all this, Vardi is also a regular on the tech circuit, and serves as co-chair of the DLD (Digital-Life-Design) conference.\n\n92\n\nFunding Circle team\n\nInvestment P2P Money-Lending Service, London\n\nIn April, Samir Desai's startup closed a £150 million funding round, reflecting its remarkable success in the overcrowded peer-to-peer lending market. Funding Circle now has access to over 38,000 investors, who lent £100m to small businesses in Q1 2015 alone. The company hopes to hit $1bn in loans this year.\n\n91\n\nSina Afra\n\nTech/Investment/Design Entrepreneur, Istanbul\n\nIn May 2014, the 47-year-old Turkish entrepreneur exited his flash-sales site Markafoni. The former European director of M&A for eBay is an angel investor and eco-entrepreneur -- in May his design studio Atölye Labs launched low-carbon brand UNDO Laces. He's a connector in Istanbul's tech scene.\n\n90\n\nRuss Shaw\n\nTech/Investment/Politics Founder, Tech London Advocates, London\n\nShaw, 52, has been pushing for increased broadband speeds, modernised transport infrastructure and more office space for the capital.

From Google to the European Commission, the 54-year-old futurist has the ear of some of the world's most significant decision makers.\n\n87\n\nBen Medlock and Jon Reynolds\n\nTech/Computing Co-Founders, SwiftKey, London\n\nThe predictive-typing app is now on over 200m smartphones. In May 2015, it moved towards monetising its user base by offering personalised keyboard themes. SwiftKey has expanded into the Asian market -- Hindi is available on Android, and there are plans for Japanese too.\n\n86\n\nDominic Smales\n\nTech/Computing Founder, Gleam Futures, London/LA\n\nSmales, 42, is manager to YouTube's superstars.

His charming, six-second comedy videos have been played over a billion times, bringing him a reported six-figure salary and high-profile partnerships, including with Paramount.\n\n82\n\nPaul Tighe\n\nPolitics Secretary of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, Vatican City\n\nTighe, a 57-year-old Irishman who's a step or two away from being the online voice of God, manages the Pope's app and Twitter account. In April 2015, Pope Francis appointed him to streamline and modernise the Vatican's comms policy.\n\n81\n\nOskar Hartmann\n\nInvestment/Web/Gaming Founder and president, KupiVIP Group; Investor, Moscow\n\nThrough Hartmann Holdings -- his family-owned investment vehicle -- the 32-year-old launched ShoppingLive, Sapato.ru, FastLane, SIMILE Ventures, CarPrice and Zaodno. His fashion site KupiVIP dominates the local market -- in April it purchased Sapato.ru, the Zappos clone.\n\n80\n\nKristian Segerstrale\n\nInvestment/Gaming COO, Super Evil Megacorp, California/Finland\n\nSince selling his game-dev company, Playfish, to EA for $300m in 2009, he, 38, has focused on bringing multiplayer online battle arena games to tablets.

The cash will be used to build a network in Europe, Asia and the Americas.\n\n78\n\nCara Delevingne\n\nSocial Model/actress, London\n\nOf all Instagram's European users, only Cristiano Ronaldo has more followers. The 22-year-old has amassed over 13.2 million followers. A single shot will often break 600,000 likes -- few in fashion wield as much brand power as her. Next, she's looking towards Hollywood with a role in DC Comics' hotly anticipated Suicide Squad.\n\n77\n\nArnie Sriskandarajah\n\nInvestment Founder, The Collective Elevator, London\n\nAs the EU Commission's inaugural entrepreneur-in-residence, Sriskandarajah, 28, advised Brussels on startups.

The CEO and co-founder of accelerator TheFamily supports 270 startups and opened an office in London in May.

The Pop was announced at CES in January and claims an eight-month battery life, a feature the French entrepreneur says defines a \"true wearable\" -- disqualifying smartwatches from the category. The company is a European leader in connected devices.\n\n71\n\nChris Morton\n\nRetail/Web Founder and CEO, Lyst, London\n\nThe British entrepreneur raised $40m in a series C round for his e-commerce platform in April 2015 and plans to use the investment to take the company worldwide.

You already know you have, say, 3,500 people in Africa. Will you have in ten years 10,000? No way. There will be maybe 40,000 people.\"\n\nSamwer does not make time for journalists – his response when WIRED requested an interview was curt: \"As you know we focus all of our time on building great companies. Unfortunately I am too much working currently [sic] and need to focus.\" When we persuaded his team that, as the individual nominated by our network as the single most influential European in WIRED's annual list, he should at least accede to a photograph, he reluctantly granted a (repeatedly rescheduled) nine-minute cover shoot. So the odds are low, when WIRED arrives at the Noah conference in Berlin in mid-June, that Samwer, scheduled to give a late-afternoon keynote, will be available to answer questions about his extraordinary, hyper-scaling, systematised, controversy-generating company-building empire. But then a strange thing happens. A speculative text message leads to a phone call and then a two-minute warning that Samwer is after all available to meet WIRED. And he's ready to clarify a few popular misconceptions about his business. \"Our company is built on very simplistic virtues,\" Samwer begins, a Rocket media handler looking on in an otherwise empty VIP tent. \"We had success because we worked very hard, because we tried to grow more global faster, because we tried to run faster, because we tried to think ten per cent smarter.\" When he and his brothers Marc and Alexander began exploring online businesses in California back in 1994, you had to be \"an Einstein\" to be part of the internet revolution. \"But we stand for the type of analytical entrepreneur who could have been a lawyer, could have been working for a big company if he hadn't started an internet company. Maybe [we should demolish] the myth of internet building -- it's also something that relatively normal people can achieve with relative success.\"\n\nThe sons of two Cologne lawyers, the Samwer brothers returned from their Silicon Valley sojourn ready to bring West Coast business models to Europe much faster than their originators. In 1999 they launched a German eBay-like auction business called Alando, which they famously sold to eBay for $50 million (£30m) within 100 days of its going live. They launched a Facebook-ish social network called StudiVZ in 2005, which Holtzbrinck Ventures bought two years later for $85 million. Soon they were gaining a reputation for cloning Pinterest (as Pinspire), YouTube (MyVideo), Twitter (Frazr), Airbnb (Wimdu), Groupon (CityDeal) and Birchbox (Glossybox). By the time this magazine covered their parent business, Rocket Internet, as \"the clone factory\" in 2012, Oliver Samwer had gained a reputation as a ruthless, if sometimes insensitively brash, CEO: his image had not been burnished by an email he had sent some lieutenants the previous October headed \"when is it time for blitzkrieg\". \"I will die to win and I expect the same from you,\" he told staff building an international furniture business. \"The time for the blitzkrieg must be chosen wisely, so each country tells me with blood when it is time. I am ready – anytime! I do not accept surprises. I want this plan confirmed by all three of you: you must sign it with your blood.\"\n\nThat, though, was before Rocket became respectable: when it announced its intention in September 2014 to float on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Samwer sent a more measured email to all staff explaining his mission to build \"one of the world's greatest internet companies\". \"For Rocket, being global is the big prize,\" he wrote. \"Innovation never stops... we must win. To lead in our industries we have to innovate every day in providing the best services for our customers... Our strength is not in any single company or country. Our unique power is being the platform that brings it all together, and makes all the individual businesses possible. And the power of this platform is just getting started.\"\n\nThe IPO on October 2, 2014, raised €1.6 billion (£1.1bn), and made the Samwer brothers billionaires; now the business is finalising a move to a new 22,000m2 HQ building in Berlin's Kreuzberg district overlooking Checkpoint Charlie, from where it will be the \"platform\" that links companies such as HelloFresh and Foodpanda in food, Dafiti and Lamoda in fashion, Lazada and Linio in e-commerce, and Westwing and Home24 in home and living.\n\nRocket's website declares its mission as \"to become the world's largest internet platform outside the United States and China\" -- yet there was never any grand plan, nor any particular vision, Samwer says. \"We didn't have that vision. This entire word 'vision' always sounds very far away. When I hear, 'What's your vision, what's your misison, what's your strategy?' -- I think for us basically we would like to be very successful entrepreneurs in the internet space and have a very big impact on lots of people and markets and countries. With Jeff Bezos, Jack Ma, I think they never expected to be that big either.\" As he told WIRED three years ago: \"We are builders of companies, we are not innovators.\"\n\nSo he's not particularly bothered by the accusations of cloning others' original ideas. \"Even Edison said [success was] 99 per cent perspiration, one per cent inspiration,\" he says now. \"Are you really sure that of all the supermarkets in the UK, they all invented the same? I've never read a story that Tesco is the clone of Asda. Everyone has the chance to pick up ideas – and most people don't pick up. It's the difference between waking up -- which is easy -- and getting up, which is difficult. Your children have no problems to wake up. It's harder to make your children get up.\"\n\nOliver Samwer speaks quickly and firmly, and offers few opportunities for interruptions. \"I would have an easier life if it was all easy?\" he continues. \"It's damned difficult. Would I love to be the very first ever in the world with an idea? Yes, maybe. Do I lose sleep over it? No. I like what I'm doing. We try to build successful companies that are sustainable, that are market leaders, that provide great service to customers. Maybe one day people will write, 'He didn't invent many companies, but he invented one,' and maybe the business model of Rocket will be one day be declared pioneering, an original idea.\"\n\nIn aiming to be \"the home screen of the world\", Rocket's original idea is to identify, then build, then scale businesses in e-commerce, marketplaces, finance-tech and travel more quickly and aggressively than anyone else. It divides the businesses it launches (or invests in) into \"proven winners\" -- such as fashion retailer Lamoda and home-interiors business Westwing; \"emerging stars\" -- payment gateway Paymill and home-cleaning firm Helpling; and \"concepts\" -- laundry service ZipJet and carpool platform Tripda. It has \"Regional Internet Groups\" in Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East to take a new business quickly into any territory where Berlin sees the numbers working.\n\nRocket gives you access to a network of experts, help in setting and scaling up the business, and access to capital,\" says Stefan Smalla, co-founder of interiors- commerce business Westwing in his Munich office. \"That makes them great investors. It's not this romantic game building e-commerce – it's super expensive, and you need a boatload of capital to get it going.\" In four years, Rocket has helped Westwing scale to 15 countries from Brazil to Kazakhstan, with 1,600 employees and, as of 2014, €183m in revenue, growing at 66 per cent year on year. Part of the benefit is the centralisation of best practice: \"We were looking at rolling out HR software, so we contacted Rocket, and got access to a few benchmarks of good products,\" Smalla says. \"There are email lists such as CTO @ Rocket, product @ Rocket -- experts who run stuff across the Rocket portfolio, who can help.\"\n\nVery often, Rocket will develop a business model internally and then go on to recruit its founders, typically management consultants such as Paul Philipp Hermann, formerly of the Boston Consulting Group and now co-founder of real-estate-listings business Lamudi. \"I had the advantage of [launching with] a proven business model, of having a lot of help with fundraising, and lots of contacts,\" Hermann says. \"We launched in late 2013 and are currently in 33 countries -- last January we were launching a new country every two weeks. They take a lot of the risks out – and provide an environment where you can thrive and learn. We have regular calls with Oli -- we go through our numbers, our KPIs, our planned strategy – and we meet four times a year in the office to go through things in more detail. You do realise it's not 100 per cent your company -- but then again, if I had launched alone, I'd be in a ten-person startup, scared of running out of cash tomorrow. Rocket gives you an unfair advantage.\"\n\nOne criticism often made of the Samwers is that businesses are structured so as to minimise the founders' upside, thereby hindering the growth of an ecosystem where wealthy founders re-invest. Samwer naturally disputes this. \"Nobody created as many millionaires outside the US and China as us. Maybe we didn't create multibillionaires yet, but let's look at how many multibillionaires there are anyway in non-US and non-China tech. Microsoft was once a millionaire factory. We're not a factory yet, but we've filled several school classes, and there are multimillionaires and also multi-hundred millionaires there.\"\n\nIncreasingly, prospective founders are responding to the benefits of being inside the machine. \"In Germany you really need it because the culture is so antagonistic to startups that a factory approach makes such a difference,\" according to Christian Grobe, who went from McKinsey to co-founding peer-to-peer lending business Zencap. \"A lot of our McKinsey friends don't think about going to big companies like Mercedes now – they want to launch a startup in Berlin with Rocket. The downside is that you're expected to deliver your numbers from day one. There's no trying-out period.\"\n\nSamwer is blunt, too, about his mistakes. \"I invested in Facebook at $15bn and sold it at $15.5 because I was scared,\" he tells Marco Rodzynek on stage at Noah. \"I missed the chance to invest in Delivery Hero at $10m; the list is very long.\" He also pulled out of Turkey after losing money in a series of businesses. \"I don't regret it. You learn. There's no transformation if you don't try. In the same year we entered 27 markets; yes, Turkey didn't work, but 26 worked. I'm so focused on what's next I can't start crying at the past. \"The most important thing is that you chose the right business model. Then it's all about being number one in this business. You'll have a period when you'll have substantial significant losses as you build enough of a critical distance from number two, three, four. Being number one and giving everything to become that is very important. It's speed, but also the detail, the focus on the operations, the loyalty of the customers. It comes down to the normal virtues – hard work, thinking a little faster, smarter, going more international, and being a little braver and luckier.\""
