2,000 ARRESTS. MORE THAN 100 OFF-DUTY ARRESTS. 6,000 ASSISTS. 15 SHOOTINGS. 8 SHOT. 4 KILLS. THIS IS THE RECORD THAT MAKES DETECTIVE 2ND GRADE RALPH FRIEDMAN THE NYPD'S MOST DECORATED DETECTIVE. FRIEDMAN WAS ARGUABLY THE TOUGHEST COP EVER TO WEAR THE SHIELD AND WAS THE MOST DECORATED DETECTIVE IN THE NYPD'S 170-YEAR HISTORY. STATIONED AT THE SOUTH BRONX'S NOTORIOUS 41ST PRECINCT, KNOWN BY ITS NICKNAME "FORT APACHE," FRIEDMAN SERVED DURING ONE OF THE CITY'S MOST DIRE ERAS: THE 1870S AND '80S, WHEN FISCAL CRISIS, POLITICAL DISILLUSIONMENT, AN OUT-OF-CONTROL WELFARE SYSTEM, AND SURGING CRIME AND DRUG USE WERE JUST A FEW OF ITS PROBLEMS. STREET WARRIOR TELLS AN UNVARNISHED STORY OF HARROWING VICE AND HEROIC GRIT, INCLUDING FRIEDMAN'S REFLECTIONS ON RACIAL PROFILING, CONFRONTATIONS WITH THE CITIZENS HE SWORE TO PROTECT, AND THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE. THIS IS THE EXPLOSIVE TRUE STORY OF HOW ONE MAN'S DEDICATION TO JUSTICE MADE HIM A LEGEND.
