STREET WARRIOR is one of many TV action films getting buried in the heaps of similar flicks that have sat around movie store shelves before heading towards the bargain bin. With a story that's not very inventive and fight scenes that were mediocre even at the time of its release, this is a watchable but totally overlookable addition to an already cluttered subgenre that will only truly interest fans of particular performers.

I saw this movie only just a few minutes again and wow I was definitely impressed with the portray that Max Martini put out as his character Jack Campbell, He still played the role as well as he did when he was in The Unit as Mack. He was always well at putting out a character who was a 'Hero' but yet he was still able to pack a punch so to speak.

OK, OK, I know the plot is the usual rubbish - disgraced ex-Special Forces goes back home after a real loooong time and just gets into more trouble.Dodgy cops, dodgier camera work and some lame characters - is there anything good about it?

I have to be honest, I didn't expect this movie to be all that good. The story has been done plenty of times, and I was expecting not to be entertained, but I was pleasantly surprised.

Jack Campbell (Martini) is a soldier who gets a dishonorable discharge for beating up his commanding officer. He goes back to his old stomping grounds and finds out his brother has been severely beaten by a steroid-enhanced punchfighter named Isaiah.

First of all, i usually read the comments and check the ratings on IMDb before i even approve of watching a movie (unless it's a new, independent or recommended movie).This however was a gambler because there was a few comments out and all said positive things.

Love it. I saw this movie only just a few minutes again and wow I was definitely impressed with the portray that Max Martini put out as his character Jack Campbell, He still played the role as well as he did when he was in The Unit as Mack.
