        "text": "Have you ever wondered what makes James Bond theme music Bondesque? We reveal the answer to this question and more.\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn which songs you might enjoy for a karaoke night. But first, let’s look at what makes a Bond theme song Bond. To simplify the process, we’ll go in reverse order grouped by Bond eras.\n\nBond music has shifted throughout the years and failed to land in one genre. The early years used strong brass elements that transitioned into strings later on. While a minor key seemed to stay intact, there were many Bond songs written in a major key.\n\nEven the tempo that launched the franchise around 70 beats per minute (bpm) reached up to 90-110 bpm. The original sultry female voices even switched out with male voices. So what makes the Bond sound?\n\nBillie Eilish and Sam Smith seemed to be the only singers to get all the Bond elements to work together. The most obvious was their “John Barry” like orchestration in a minor key. Both made award-winning songs that rose to #1 on the UK charts, making them the newest famous Bond theme songs.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the Bond theme songs by era and artist.\n\nTwo-time Brit Award winner, Billie Eilish, wrote “No Time to Die” with her brother Finneas O’Connell. She unveiled the song during her performance at the Brit Awards in February 2020. The song was the first Bond song by a female artist to top the UK Singles Chart.\n\nEilish was 18-years-old when she wrote and recorded the song. This made her the youngest artist to ever work on a Bond film. It was also a first, recording a theme song in a bedroom studio.\n\nThe song is an orchestra pop ballad with a touch of R&B. The E minor key makes the song fun for karaoke singers.\n\nThe song is very Bondesque. It builds as a dark theme (Eilish’s forte) with dramatic orchestration. Hans Zimmerman wrote the orchestral arrangement.\n\nThe song won a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.\n\nSam Smith and Jimmy Napes wrote, “Writing’s on the Wall” for Spectre. The recording was at RAK Studios, Abbey Road Studios, and The Pierce Rooms in London.\n\nThe song won a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. It also won Best Original Song from the Academy Awards.\n\nThe song is a love ballad that focuses on its use of strings. Some critics thought the song written in the key of F minor was put together in haste. Others felt it was Smith’s greatest work.\n\nSony Pictures President of Music Lia Vollack selected Adele. She thought Adele’s voice could come across like Shirley Bassey’s voice. Bassey sung Goldfinger (1964), Diamonds Are Forever (1971), and Moonraker (1979).\n\nAdele was hesitant to accept since her music writing was so personal. But director Sam Mendes gave her the script and told her to write a personal song. After reading the script, the music flowed from Adele.\n\nThe song became a hit in 11 countries. It won:\n\nAcademy Award for Best Original Song\n\nBrit Award for British Single of the Year\n\nCritics’ Choice Movie Award for Best Song\n\nGolden Globe Award for Best Original Song\n\nGrammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media\n\nJ. A. C. Redford orchestrated the orchestral pop song in C minor. Some say the lower-pitched song was due to her micro throat surgery. Others suggest it was her pregnancy that limited her range.\n\nRegardless, Adele maintained the soulful, haunting, and evocative Bond tone. “Skyfall” became the best-selling Bond song in history. Its sales exceeded 7-million at its release.\n\nThis lower register of the song makes “Skyfall” easier for men to join in on karaoke night. They even like the sinister slant and Bond tropes and motif references.\n\nThis Bond song was not your typical James Bond song. It was the first duet in the franchise’s history. Jack White (White Stripes) wrote the song and Alicia Keys performed.\n\nThe song hit number one in Finland and struggled to reach number nine in the UK. The song premiered on September 18, 2008, on BBC Radio 1’s The Jo Whiley Show.\n\nThe song was not well received due to its genre shift. Instead of an orchestral sound mixed with R&B, the song was an alternative rock or symphonic rock genre.\n\nAlso, many confused the E minor key with its relative major chord of G major. One of the things that make the theme songs sound like Bond is its minor key. Some say this confusion was due to the music genre.\n\nThis is the song that launched Daniel Craig’s tenure as James Bond. Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman Chris Cornell wrote this song. It turned into one of the best songs of his career.\n\nBefore Jack White and Alicia Keys’ duet, Cornell changed up the genre of Bond music. But he was sensible enough to create a main version separate from the pop-mix music video version.\n\nHis changes focused on creating a replacement theme score for the character. He gave little consideration to the theme music as the film’s theme. If it wasn’t for the leaked music on September 20, 2006, the single may not have had a solid release.\n\nThe music was not included in the Casino Royale soundtrack. Instead, it appeared in Cornell’s album, “Carry On.” The “You Know My Name” single made it to number 7 on the UK Singles.\n\nCornell wrote the original lyrics separate from film composer David Arnold. Arnold wanted the song to fit the score and made a few changes to the lyrics. He also composed the music.\n\nThis collaborative song was the most up-tempo song in the franchise’s history. Instead of the orchestral mix with R&B, this B minor song was more rock-oriented or aggressive.\n\nMadonna’s first take on this song did not reflect the theme of the film. After screening the rough cut of the film, she adjusted it to fit the storey metaphorically. The idaea was to destroy one’s ego.\n\nThe music is an orchestral piece with interpolating electronic swirls. The team also used electronics on Madonna’s voice. This combination led to mixed reviews.\n\nMadonna fought for a unique sound but did not get what she had hoped. While most Bond songs were in a minor key, this one was B major. It was also at twice the tempo of most Bond songs and sped its way to number 3 on UK Singles.\n\nDavid Arnold and lyricist Don Black wrote the song in the key of A-flat major. Arnold used a 60 piece orchestra mixed with electronica to couple a dance beat with the Bond sound. Scottish-American rock band Garbage performed the song.\n\nGarbage was a big deal in the late 1990s so the timing was perfect. The Bond-style was intact, even though the music had more of a dance beat. Most critics approved and the song reached number 11 in UK Singles.\n\nSheryl Crow’s song “Tomorrow Never Dies” peaked at number 12 on UK Singles. The American singer-songwriter co-wrote the song with producer Mitchell Froom. Crow’s pop-rock style was evident and fused well with the Bond style.\n\nCrow matched the Bond swagger in the key of A minor. But her voice did not bring the classical style of Shirley Bassey and others.\n\nSome critics panned Crow’s style as being lazy. Others praised her for breaking free of tradition.\n\nThe Golden Globe Awards nominated the song for Best Original Song. The Grammy Awards nominated the song for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television, or Other Visual Media. The song did not win either.\n\nTina Turner sang the hit written by U2 stars Bono and The Edge. The song fits the Bond-style well, but the film’s storey was the first not based on Ian Fleming’s works. The B minor song topped many European charts including #2 on UK R&B and #10 on UK Singles.\n\nThe original motion picture soundtrack included “GoldenEye”. In the following year, the song was on Turner’s album Wildest Dreams. The piece highlighted strings and horns, with a lyrical twist of romance, danger, and class.\n\nMany suggested that Turner sounded like Shirley Bassey, but with a brighter tempo.\n\nNorwegian pop band A-ha took centre stage for this Europop version of the D minor Bond theme. The song hit the UK Singles at #5. Guitarist Pål Waaktaar wrote the song. A revised version was on the band’s album, “Stay on These Roads” (1988).\n\nJohn Barry got credit as co-writer and producer. This turned into a controversial topic. Waaktaar suggested that none of what Barry wrote was used.\n\nBut, Waaktaar stated in an interview that he loved the “stuff (Barry) added to the track.” He was referring to his string arrangement.\n\n“All Time High” was the theme song for Octopussy and was in E-flat minor. It brought theme composer John Barry back to the Bond family. The film’s title was too unique to make its way into the song, so the team brainstormed a new title.\n\nRita Coolidge was a curious choice because her career peaked six years earlier. Allegedly Cubby Broccoli’s daughter played Coolidge music in front of her dad daily. This continued until he decided that her voice was perfect for the theme song.\n\nBill Conti and Mike Leeson wrote, “For Your Eyes Only.” Scottish singer Sheena Easton performed. The song reached #4 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIt received a nomination for Best Original Song at the Academy Awards in 1982.\n\nEaston is the only artist to seen singing the theme song in a Bond movie’s opening title sequence. This was one of the few Bond films that didn’t include composer John Barry. The song was in the key of E-flat minor.\n\nThis song from “The Spy Who Loved Me” was the first Bond theme to carry a different name than the film title. Marvin Hamlisch wrote this ballad with lyrics by Carole Bayer Sager. The song was in G major with one of the slowest tempos for a Bond theme.\n\nThe single was well received and hit #7 on UK Singles. The song sold over a million copies. The song was in the style of Bond with the added pop flair.\n\nThis was Simon’s longest charted hit. Before that was her song “You’re So Vain” which reached #3 on UK Singles. Simon received Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Song in 1978.\n\nLulu performed this theme song. John Barry composed the song with lyrics by Don Black. Barry considered this D minor song his weakest contribution to the franchise.\n\nIt was the only Bond song that did not chart on UK Singles.\n\nMany attributed the failure to chart to the suggestive lyrics. But other changes were also a significant possibility. For instance, the shift from a horn-based sound from the 1960s to a smooth string sound.\n\n“Live and Let Die” was the first rock song to open a Bond film. The British–American rock band Wings performed. The song was in G major and written by English musician Paul McCartney and his wife Linda McCartney.\n\nThis song reunited McCartney with Beatles producer George Martin, who arranged the orchestra. While this song was a big hit on three major US charts, it only reached #9 on UK Singles. It was also the first Bond song to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.\n\nProducer Harry Saltzman wanted Shirley Bassey or Thelma Houston to perform the song. But McCartney only allowed the song in the film if Wings performed it. McCartney gave some leeway by allowing a second version of the song by B. J. Arnau to appear in the film.\n\nLouis Armstrong sang this James Bond theme. The singer did not record the trumpet music. He was sick at the time so he conserved his strength for singing.\n\nJohn Barry composed the music with lyrics by Hal David. The song was a secondary musical theme. The title theme was the instrumental version “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.” Barry composed both versions.\n\nThe song did not chart during its initial release. But thanks to a Guinness beer commercial, its 1994 release hit #3 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was in the key of A major with a moving beat.\n\nBarry’s instrumental version also appeared in “No Time to Die” in 2021.\n\nNancy Sinatra performed “You Only Live Twice” in the key of B major. Composer John Barry and lyricist Leslie Bricusse were brilliant in this opening number. Some called it perfect, while many rerecorded the cover for their own albums.\n\nThe song opened with a striking two-bar theme. The violins were in the high octaves and French horns built the harmony. The recording of the 60-piece orchestra was at the CTS Studios in Bayswater, London.\n\nThe song reached #11 on the UK charts.\n\nJohn Barry composed “Goldfinger” with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley. Shirley Bassey sang the film’s opening and closing title sequences. While the E major song only hit #21 on UK Singles, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nThe iconic two-note phrase for the song’s introduction was not in the original score. After a long rehearsal, Barry had an idaea during his tea break. 20-minutes later the notes were in the orchestration.\n\nProducer Harry Saltzman hated the music, but it was too late to replace the song.\n\nJohn Barry was the primary composer for this film. Joining him was Lionel Bart of “Oliver!” fame with a performance by Matt Monro. The instrumental version plays over the opening credits in the key of D minor.\n\nBart was not able to read and write music but composed the music and lyrics. Barry wrote the arrangement and a second version of the song hit the UK charts at #13. There was also a jazzy organ version by Alan Haven that was not released on the soundtrack album.\n\nMonty Norman wrote the original James Bond Theme. The music was featured in every Bond film in some fashion ever since.\n\nJohn Barry arranged the theme and composed 11 soundtracks for the franchise. The theme was in B minor with a tempo of 90 bpm.\n\nBarry claims that he was the one to write the theme and can explain in detail how it came into being. But Norman is the one who has won several lawsuits and continues receiving royalties.\n\nMany of the theme songs are iconic. While experimentation altered songs, most still included Bond elements.
