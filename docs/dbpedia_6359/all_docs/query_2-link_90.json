For example, a horror film will likely attract a different audience than a comedy. Same with action movies or thrillers.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is figure out the genre of your movie.\n\nFinding Your Movie Target Audience\n\nIf you're writing your movie, now is the best time to think about who will want to watch it.\n\nWhat kind of movie are you making? Is it a scary movie, a love story, or maybe something funny?\n\nDifferent types of movies attract different kinds of people.\n\nKnowing who you're writing for can help you add the right elements to your story.\n\nFor example, if you're writing a scary movie, the audience will expect to be scared. And you'll need to add all the suspense and thrills your audience will love.\n\nCompleted Movies: Who's Your Audience?\n\nIf you've finished making your movie, you're probably excited to show it to people.\n\nBut before you do that, you must consider who those people are.\n\nKnowing your audience can help you decide how to talk about your movie.\n\nAsk yourself:\n\nWhat do they like to do for fun?\n\nWhere do they live?\n\nAre they mostly men or women?\n\nHow old are they?\n\nDid they go to college?\n\nKnowing these things can help you figure out how to talk to your audience in a way that makes them want to see your movie.\n\nIf you get stuck, you can always research the local newsstand for magazines that cater to your audience.\n\nAny magazines in print in a digital world exist because people are interested in the topic.\n\nThese magazines can give you a lot of clues about what your audience likes and who they are.\n\nYou can even call the magazine to get more details.\n\nSince magazines make money with subscribers and advertisers, this information will be available.\n\nThis info will help you get a clear picture of the two or three types of people who will most likely want to watch your movie.\n\nTop Marketing Channels for Movies\n\nOnce you know who will watch your movie, you can figure out ways to talk about it so your audience will understand.\n\nIf you find out that people who will like your movie read certain magazines, you can put ads in those magazines.\n\nYou can use social media to get the word out with ads, posts, or comments if they're online often.\n\nThe idea is to go where the people who will like your movie are already spending time. This helps more people learn about your movie.\n\nIf you don't know this stuff, you're just hoping things will work out.\n\nAnd hope is not a good movie business plan.\n\nAttracting Film Distribution\n\nKnowing your movie's target audience is a big help when attracting a movie distributor.\n\nIf you know your movie targets a certain audience, you can find a distributor who also targets that audience. This makes your movie a better fit for them, and they'll be more likely to want to work with you.\n\nFor example, if your movie is a horror film, you can look for distributors who specialize in horror.\n\nThey'll already know how to reach the people who want to watch your movie, which makes their job easier and your movie more likely to succeed.\n\nWith solid research on your movie's target audience, you're in a much better position to negotiate a favorable film distribution deal.\n\nMovie Marketing Plan\n\nOnce you agree to a distribution deal, all of this research will also help you work better with your distributor to market your movie.\n\nSince you already know who your audience is, what they like, and where they spend their time, you can share this valuable information with your distributor.\n\nThis makes it easier to pick the right places to advertise and promote your movie.\n\nIn other words, the research you did to understand your audience isn't just useful for getting a distribution deal; it's also great for making sure your movie actually gets watched once it's out there.\n\nSo, having a good understanding of your target audience can help you not just attract a distributor but also make your movie a success after it's released.\n\nMovie Target Audience Success\n\nWhile defining the target audience for your film is not the most exciting part of the filmmaking process, this research can go a long way in helping you secure a favorable distribution deal and successfully market your movie.\n\nTake the time to understand your target audience, and use that knowledge to make informed decisions throughout the filmmaking and distribution process.\n\nAnd if your movie does not attract a fantastic distribution deal, then this research will go a long way toward helping you execute your film marketing and distribution plan. And check out Tom Malloy's movie distribution course.\n\nTL;DR â€“ Key Takeaways\n\nUnderstanding your movie's target audience is crucial for both the writing stage and for marketing a completed film.
