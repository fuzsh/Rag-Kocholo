        "text": "horror film, motion picture calculated to cause intense repugnance, fear, or dread. Horror films may incorporate incidents of physical violence and psychological terror; they may be studies of deformed, disturbed, psychotic, or evil characters; stories of terrifying monsters or malevolent animals; or mystery thrillers that use atmosphere to build suspense. The genre often overlaps science-fiction films and film noir.\n\n(Read Martin Scorseseâ€™s Britannica essay on film preservation.)\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nClassic Closing Lines\n\nIn the earliest horror films, which were influenced by German Expressionist cinema, the effect of horror was usually created by means of a macabre atmosphere and theme; The Student of Prague (1913), an early German film dealing with a dual personality, and The Golem (1915), based on the medieval Jewish legend of a clay figure that comes to life, were the first influential horror films. In the 1920s such German films as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), Nosferatu (the first filming of the Dracula story; 1922), and Waxworks (1924) were known throughout the world. In the United States a number of outstanding horror films were produced in the 1920s. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920) became a classic of the silent screen, and Lon Chaney terrified audiences as The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) and The Phantom of the Opera (1925). The Cat and the Canary (1927) was an atmospheric thriller set in a fog-shrouded house honeycombed with secret passages.\n\nThe great popular success of Dracula (made in the United States in 1931), Frankenstein (1931), and The Mummy (1932) led to a long series of successful horror films including King Kong (1932) and The Black Cat (1934). Among some of the best-known horror classics of this period are The Werewolf of London (1935), The Wolf Man (1941), and Cat People (1942)."
