        "text": "STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE\n\n30. Only God Forgives (2013)\n\nNo, he doesn't want your whiskey\n\nThis may be a polarizing start.\n\nThere’s a lot of good to take out of Only God Forgives, even if it’s not right up your alley. Admittedly, it chooses a frustratingly-incoherent amount of style over a frustratingly-incoherent amount of substance.\n\nIt's one of the more dreamlike interpretations of the genre that still plays out by-the-numbers. That’s a good thing.\n\nFrom the deluge of red and blue lighting to the frames within the frames, to the picturesque cinematography of every last shot, it’s the quintessential experience to a fault.\n\nRyan Gosling was clearly on a streak after Drive, which solidified him as the modern film noir equivalent of a Scream Queen. This is an important entry in that filmography.\n\nIf the plot bewilders you and the pacing bores you, watch it for the classical motifs and haunting vibes that so blatantly permeate it.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nONLY GOD FORGIVES\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Bangkok\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 41%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nHEIGHTENING MODERN NOIR\n\n29. Sin City (2005)\n\nI love hitmen\n\nWhen I said that neo-noir can heighten film noir, the first example I'd point to is Sin City.\n\nAdapted from Frank Miller's graphic novel, the movie preserves the black-and-white saturation. That immediately aligns it with the classic era of filmmaking.\n\nIt features hard-boiled male protagonists, fiendish murders, mystifying femme fatales, and poetic voiceovers — all trademarks of film noir.\n\nBut it amps them up to 11.\n\nCharacters survive an uncanny number of injuries. They all dress like caricatures. Accents of color violate the otherwise-grey setting. Then the film piles on some giant dinosaur statues and a yellow troll man.\n\nHonestly, it's all super dumb. But that's the idea.\n\nIt's a heightening of film noir to literally “comical” levels.\n\nWhile the 2005 green screens have aged fine, it's still incredibly watchable and I'd encourage it to see what modern film noir looks like.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nSIN CITY\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Basin City\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 77%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nMALTESE FALCON AT A HIGH SCHOOL\n\n28. Brick (2005)\n\nI'm gonna start shakin' things up\n\nRian Johnson’s debut is our first dose of a nontraditional noir setup.\n\nThat is, rather than the grizzly streets of an urban underworld, Brick takes place at a high school. All the archetypes are there, they’re just adjusted to fit that new setting.\n\nBesides the location change, Johnson keeps them all perfectly intact.\n\nBrendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is as fast-talking and hard-boiled as any film noir protagonist — except acting that way in high school makes you the weird kid.\n\nWhen he discovers his ex-girlfriend has been murdered, he confronts it not as a real teenager would, but instead as a parodic sleuth. It’s funny, but it’s played so straight that you're invested in the mystery anyway.\n\nYou know how Die Hard knockoffs set in different locales are a gag trope? Think of this as The Maltese Falcon at a high school.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nBRICK\n\nUnderworld of Choice: California Suburbs\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 79%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nSUBVERTING THE FEMME FATALE\n\n27. Black Widow (1987)\n\nShe mates and she kills\n\nLet’s talk about the “femme fatale” trope for a minute here...\n\nIt literally translates to \"fatal woman,\" so you know it's a little old-timey soft-sexist. Characters of this archetype will use seduction and exploitation to manipulate men to some deadly ends. Whether that's an assertion of their independence or a reductive two-dimensional portrait is still up for debate by women.\n\nEither way, in Black Widow, Catherine (Theresa Russell) is just such a character — except she's in the wrong movie. This isn't a film noir where the seductress toys with the leading man. She's already done that — three times — and she's killed each one of them.\n\nConsider this the aftermath. Alexandra (Debra Winger) is the only one wise to Catherine's scheming, so she goes undercover to expose it. What ensues is a Spy vs. Spy scenario wherein even Alexandra gets lured into the spiderweb.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nBLACK WIDOW\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Hawaii\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 48%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nEXPOSING MODERN FILM NOIR\n\n26. Bad Times at the El Royale (2018)\n\nThe hotel is truly a character in the film\n\nDark histories and deadly secrets pervade the casts of film noir movies. After all, many of those movies were detective stories, so uncovering mysteries was the whole idea.\n\nModern film noir ran with that by expanding into ensemble pieces. Each character gets their time in the spotlight, their hidden backstories exposed firsthand, rather than be discovered by a single, driving force.\n\nYou saw it in Sin City, you'll see it later in Pulp Fiction, and you can see it now in Bad Times at the El Royale.\n\nEl Royale sees the collision of seven archetypal characters in one neon-bathed setting. As it skips through time and space, each of their motives come to light.\n\nThere’s not a central murder, but there is a mystery.\n\nThough it doesn’t reinvent the wheel, it's a solid character study that offers new dimensions and the strong interplay between what would otherwise be tired tropes.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nBAD TIMES AT THE EL ROYALE\n\nUnderworld of Choice: The El Royale Hotel\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 75%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nDEBAUCHERY IN MODERN NOIR\n\n25. Enter the Void (2010)\n\nTrippy, drug-induced ride\n\nOne of the paradigm shifts from film noir movies to neo-noir movies is the addition of neon lights.\n\nThere’s still high contrast lighting, but directors now flood those once-monochromic images with vibrant reds, blues, and purples. With that, they replace the condemnation of immorality and temptation with a hedonistic embracement of them.\n\nEnter the Void is the ultimate exercise in that.\n\nIt's a drug trip, a sexcapade, and a DMT-fueled meditation on life and death. Much like Chinatown and Only God Forgives, this film appropriates the shimmer of its Asian influences. Then it employs a first-person POV to thrust you directly into and above the city of Tokyo.\n\nNarratively, this is less about curing the depravity and more about reconciling its impact on people — in the most psychedelic way possible.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nENTER THE VOID\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Tokyo\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 71%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nBEACH NOIR\n\n24. Inherent Vice (2014)\n\nLove usually leads to trouble\n\nThe renaissance of film noir took place in the 1940s-1960s. There was a certain perception of authority as an upright and hard-boiled thing.\n\nBy the time the 1970s rolled around, that was gone.\n\nWe had been in Vietnam for too long, the whiplash of protesting had birthed hippies, and then hippies in Los Angeles went and murdered Sharon Tate. So Paul Thomas Anderon's Inherent Vice picks up the reins in that era.\n\nThe film falls into the deeper subgenre of surf/beach noir since it's set in the parts of Los Angeles that are seedy but also sandy. Our lead is Larry \"Doc\" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix), a beach-bound stoner who also happens to be a private investigator.\n\nHe guides us through a tale that's overly-complicated and completely absurd, all rolled up tight into one joint.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nINHERENT VICE\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Los Angeles\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 73%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nNEO-NOIR IN THE 1970s\n\n23. Night Moves (1975)\n\nMaybe he would find the girl... maybe he would find himself\n\n...and that’s the perfect transition into Night Moves.\n\nUnlike Anderson, who had the luxury of playful hindsight, Arthur Penn made this film in the 1970s. And, this soon after Watergate, deception was trending on a national level.\n\nWhile that leads Inherent Vice’s Doc to some fun beatnik antics, Harry Moseby (Gene Hackman) is still feeling the brunt of it. Particularly because his wife is having an affair. Deception hits too close to home.\n\nA football player turned private investigator, Moseby is a man whose glory days are behind him. He still feigns a tough shell to mask his many insecurities, but he can’t help but flip-flop between solving his case and repairing his own marriage.\n\nNight Moves is a meta re-evaluation of American life that uses psychological thrills to speak to sociological paranoia.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nNIGHT MOVES\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Los Angeles\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 82%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nSETTING AND SENSITIVITY\n\n22. Se7en (1995)\n\n'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part\n\nLet's return to form with Se7en, a linear detective thriller.\n\nThough it's more conventional than some of the other movies on here, its dreary atmosphere helps it stand out in the genre.\n\nThe story takes place in I Don't Know Someplace, USA. Its actual name is less important than the city's tone, and that tone is overcast and bleak and threatening.\n\nThat does a lot of the legwork to define the film's overall mood. As we carry on, you'll see how the neo-noir movies that let their cities do the talking gain so much from it.\n\nAnd the violence is just as implicit. The numeric gimmick — murders in the theme of the Seven Deadly Sins — makes each new kill inevitable and morbidly fascinating.\n\nBy depicting them as graphic without cherishing the gore or glamorizing the action, Se7en keeps you from desensitivity.\n\nIt builds to an ending that, rather than put you on the edge of your seat, makes you want to crawl into a hole.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nSE7EN\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Unspecified American City\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 81%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nBLAXPLOITATION MEETS NEO-NOIR\n\n21. Jackie Brown (1997)\n\nShut your raggedy a** up and sit the f*ck down!\n\nIn one scene of this film, Max Cherry (Robert Forster) invites Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) to a bar. She asks him, \"Is it dark?\" He retorts, \"Why's it have to be dark?\" And that’s the question Jackie Brown answers.\n\nIt isn't overtly neo-noir, but contrast it with Sin City or Only God Forgives, which do all the noiry things in the noiry ways and come out weaker for it.\n\nQuentin Tarantino crams the blaxploitation world into the neo-noir box and lets it overflow.\n\nThe would be femme fatale is a flight attendant under the thumb of the police. The shady deals are conducted in, not just a mall, but the BIGGEST mall. The typical jazzy musical motifs are gone, replaced with soulful interludes.\n\nThe cynicism hangs around, but here it's about the sociological castes that trap the character rather the psychological turmoil.\n\nIt fits the neo-noir definition to a tee, so why's it have to be dark?\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nJACKIE BROWN\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Los Angeles\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 87%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nSHANE BLACK ON MODERN NOIR\n\n20. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005)\n\nThere was an eight percent chance\n\nShane Black movies are like Gilmore Girls for film bros. They burst with snappy dialogue that flattens the earth like a stampede.\n\nSo, really, he's a perfect fit for modern film noir.\n\nJust as Brick locks onto and emulates those overly smooth noir musings, Black uses them to riff on the genre itself. Robert Downey Jr., pre-Iron Man, is still just as well-suited to play a narcissistic wiseass.\n\nUsing RDJ’s character Harry as a voice-box, Black not only judges the conventions of neo-noir movies but makes his characters decidedly bad at following them.\n\nIn that way, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang isn't quite a deconstruction, nor subversion, but more like an extended commentary.\n\nAnd, even as it spoofs the tropes and standards it does fall into them by starring a morally-ambiguous antihero...\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nKISS KISS BANG BANG\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Los Angeles\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 85%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nWHAT IS NEO-NOIR IN THE 2010s\n\n19. John Wick (2014)\n\nYou stole my car and killed my dog\n\nAt some point, some cinematic authority (see: StudioBinder) should do a breakdown of the different waves of neo-noir. For all its common elements, the genre has evolved quite a bit from something like Chinatown in the 1970s to something like John Wick in 2014.\n\nWhatever wave modern noir is, John Wick is undoubtedly the face of it.\n\nWick's resurgence from hitman retirement parallels Keanu Reeves' return to the Hollywood limelight, but it also marks the rebirth of neo-noir as a mainstream genre.\n\nMovies like Hotel Artemis and Terminal (both of which I like, but admit shouldn't be on this list) are riding along on the coattails of this redefinition.\n\nUnder John Wick's reign, neo-noir is both thrilling and introspective, redeemable yet inevitably cynical.\n\nAnd while the world-building of future John Wick films is also fun, there's a lot to be said for the simplistic emotional weight of losing a dog.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nJOHN WICK\n\nUnderworld of Choice: New York City\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 85%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nPSYCHOLOGICAL NOIR\n\n18. Memento (2000)\n\nYou don't have a clue you freak\n\nLike an exercise in Godwin's Law, when fans and critics discuss nonlinear storytelling, Memento is bound to come up. It feels passée to praise it in 2019, but it's with good reason.\n\nGreater think pieces have assuredly been written on the collision-course timelines and cinematic innovations, so let's focus on Memento's place in the modern film noir catalog.\n\nIt's the antithesis of films like Jackie Brown and Bad Times at the El Royale, which broaden the protagonistic platform to let more characters unveil their history mysteries.\n\nHere, not even Leonard (Guy Pearce) knows who he is.\n\nAmnesia is a vastly overplayed movie trope, but by setting the parallel timelines against each other (oops, I guess we're think-piecing after all), Nolan is able to subvert it and enhance the central conflict.\n\nIn a time period when neo-noir movies were experimenting with macro-societal allegories, Memento leans away and masters psychological noir.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nMEMENTO\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Outside Los Angeles\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 92%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nSTEPPING STONE TO MODERN NEO-NOIR\n\n17. To Live and Die in L.A. (1985)\n\nGuess what? Uncle Sam don't give a sh*t about your expenses\n\nIronically, when Live and Die came out, critics slammed it for its thriller elements. Nowadays, it feels almost like an art-house.\n\nAside from launching the careers of several prolific actors, Live and Die captures the importance of setting in neo-noir. As the title implies, it is unabashedly based in Los Angeles, and it indulges in all the cityscapes and car chases that come with that particular culture.\n\nWhat early critics called \"over the top\" now feels oddly authentic. And director William Friedkin guided the project in such a way that it would feel like that as if the camera is gliding through the streets.\n\nThen there’s the musical score — which substitutes the smooth jazz for an uptempo beat that drives the action along at a more brisk pace than its predecessors.\n\nIt's a key stepping stone to modern neo-noir that can't be overlooked.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Los Angeles\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 91%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nINTERNAL CONFLICT EXTERNALIZED\n\n16. Heat (1995)\n\nI say what I mean, and I do what I say\n\nHeat is the first on-screen collision of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, two powerhouses in a crime drama — and that's awesome.\n\nBut! Let's talk about Night Moves again.\n\nHarry Moseby faced an internal conflict between his obligations as a husband and his obligations as a private investigator — two forces that he used to define his masculinity.\n\nHeat carries on down that path, pitting De Niro and Pacino against each other as two sides of the same coin, both facing Moseby's dilemma. One lawful, one chaotic, but neither strictly good or evil.\n\nTwo men with obligations who have reconciled them in different ways.\n\nAside from being a gripping thriller, Heat is a deconstruction of film noir as we know it. Look no further than the iconic coffee house scene, which lets two archetypes bare their sins to one another and show that they're more than stock characters dancing around the screen like puppets.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nHEAT\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Los Angeles\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 86%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nSUBVERTING THE TROPES\n\n15. Fargo (1996)\n\nWhoa, whoa daddy\n\nYou can take the noir out of the city, but you can't make it drink.\n\nWait, what?\n\nFargo stretches the limits of neo-noir, contradicting and subverting the genre in every discernible way it can while still unmistakably residing in the neighborhood.\n\nWhere film noir loves a shadowy, urban underbelly, the Coen brothers opt for a snowy, rural town.\n\nWhere film noir loves intricate mysteries, the Coen brothers pick incompetent mishaps.\n\nAnd, where film noir loves a cynical detective, the Coen brothers give us Frances freaking McDormand.\n\nWe behave as though the coastal elite cities are gatekeeping villainy, but ruthless killers can be found even in the most docile of middle-American towns. Fargo gives us \"Darn tootin\" and \"Yah, you betcha\" and \"Whoa, daddy\" and then it gives us the wood chipper scene.\n\nBut that's the beauty and the confusion of neo-noir. It twists the tropes in the ways its parent genre wouldn't dare.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nFARGO\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Fargo, North Dakota\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 93%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nTHE CYNICISM OF FILM NOIR\n\n14. Thief (1981)\n\nI am the last guy in the world that you wanna f*ck with\n\nMichael Mann sure loves an emotional diner scene, doesn't he?\n\nMost films on this list are set in New York or Los Angeles. Thief is set in Chicago. That bestows it with a reputable urban grit that's uncompromised by dreamy legend; it has neither the glamor of L.A. nor the grandeur of N.Y.C. So Frank's (James Caan) plight is as unromanticized as noir gets.\n\nA master thief, Frank wants to give it all up for the simple life. In that renowned diner scene, he bares his soul to girlfriend Jessie (Tuesday Weld) and invites her to join him on his vanishing act.\n\nIt's touching and tragic and so obviously futile.\n\nIn the production of Thief, Mann went to great lengths to authenticate Frank's skill set. Caan even learned the techniques Frank uses in his trade. Yet, for all that realism, it’s hard to bite on this escape plan.\n\nThat's the dark cynicism of noir.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTHIEF\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Chicago\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 93%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nLAWFUL GOOD VERSUS CHAOTIC GOOD\n\n13. L.A. Confidential (1997)\n\nWhite, I have this under control\n\n\"It'll look like justice,\" Officer White (Russell Crowe) says to Sergeant Exley (Guy Pearce) after planting a gun on his victim.\n\nThe plant validates White's shooting of an unarmed rapist — definitely justice, but not due process.\n\nWe've been touching on the theme of \"good versus evil,\" often presented as an internal struggle within oneself or as an external struggle between cops and criminals. L.A. Confidential deals with three lawmen, each of whom is \"good,\" or ostensibly on that side of the spectrum.\n\nBut their definitions of justice and the ethics they follow to achieve it are questionable at best.\n\nWhite is out for the blood of abusers. Exley is an unwavering boy scout who would check even his brothers in blue. And Sgt. Jack Vincennes just wants to make bubblegum celebrity arrests because it's sexy.\n\nDirector Curtis Hanson distills James Ellroy's novel down to these three throughlines and lets them intersect in L.A.'s complicated ethical coordinate plane.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nL.A.

Blood Simple (1984)\n\nDead in the heart of Texas\n\nIn their filmmaking debut, the Coen brothers immediately proved themselves innovators of neo-noir.\n\nBlood Simple is, as in the title, a simple and sleazy tale of simple and sleazy characters. Ethan and Joel shot it for cheap, but they didn't need special effects or numerous locations anyway.\n\nThey knew that as long as they had sufficient character intrigue, suspense and wit, the film would work.\n\nAnd those are like… their staples.\n\nThe film is complicated but not unintelligible. Without other budgetary distractions, the Coens can nail that and also showcase their patented dark humor in a way that twists the genre while remaining loyal to it.\n\nPlus — Frances freaking McDormand, man!\n\nThis encapsulates the reactionary self-awareness that neo-noir can have. It also happens to be a great lesson for aspiring filmmakers on making something memorable without breaking the bank.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nBLOOD SIMPLE\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Texas\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 92%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nNEWSIES IN MODERN NOIR\n\n11. Nightcrawler (2014)\n\nHow far would you go for the American Dream?\n\nIt’s clear that dirt and decay are the requisites of a typical neo-noir city.\n\nBut what happens when the city isn't actually spiraling into a dystopia? When the statistics are on the upswing?\n\nWhen criminality is a rare animal? Nightcrawler answers those questions in one of the best modern noir films out there.\n\nLou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a stringer so desperate to deliver on a bleeding scoop that he's willing to make the incision himself.\n\nSee, in the era of instant news, noir is no longer just a game of cops and robbers. There are third parties watching and profiteering off every incident. And that's exactly Lou’s business.\n\nIt's an apt critique of how modern news media vies for that Gotham City headline, regardless of accuracy. In doing so, they might become the criminal themselves — indirectly or otherwise.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nNIGHTCRAWLER\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Los Angeles\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 95%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nREIMAGINING THE CLASSICS\n\n10. The Long Goodbye (1973)\n\nNothing says goodbye like a bullet\n\nAnother in the wave of self-deprecating and self-referential but not self-loathing detective stories. The Long Goodbye stars Elliott Gould as Philip Marlowe, a private eye from the mind of Raymond Chandler — sort of.\n\nWith some creative license, director Robert Altman transforms him into a bit of a disasterpiece.\n\nIt's emblematic of the shift from the parent to child genres, the symbolic death of the hard-boiled midcentury man. In the twenty years between the Long Goodbye novel and movie, Los Angeles has made that figurehead obsolete.\n\nOne night, Marlowe is summoned to chauffeur his friend to Mexico. When he returns home without him, he learns that his friend's wife has been murdered, his Mexico-bound friend is dead, and he's the suspect.\n\nYou almost hope he'll stare into the camera and shrug as a black matte irises out around him.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTHE LONG GOODBYE\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Los Angeles\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 97%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nTHE BEST MODERN NOIR FILMS\n\n9. Drive (2011)\n\nGet in. Get out. Get away.\n\nDrive has the lightning-fast reflexes of its driver.\n\nIts action sequences go from zero to sixty in mere heartbeats, escalating from idle silence to roaring violence. And the violence, while over the top, isn't gratuitous.\n\nThe bits that feel cinematically fun in the heat of the moment drain of satisfaction when the Driver (Ryan Gosling) looks upon them and deactivates. Even the car chases, while tense, are far from the high-speed pursuits that real Angelenos see.\n\nLike Pulp Fiction or Mulholland Drive, this is a film that treats cars as more than utilitarian props. They are themselves rich settings with their own windows and Venetian blind spots.\n\nThis is Nicolas Winding Refn and Ryan Gosling's first collaboration before Only God Forgives, so the two films are unsurprisingly similar. Both undermine the dialogue and let the atmosphere speak — except this modern noir has more to say.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nDRIVE\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Los Angeles\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 92%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nEXPOSING THE GUTS OF NEO-NOIR\n\n8. Mulholland Drive (2001)\n\nBeware what you dream for...\n\nI'm a fan of H.P. Lovecraft. Much of his work purports that there is a thin veil of understanding around reality, masking an entire unseen world of darkness. For Lovecraft, that underworld is filled with eldritch abominations. For film noir, it's filled with corruption.\n\nFor David Lynch, it's Mulholland Drive.\n\nIt's impossible to explain everything this film is in a digestible chunk. It's peak Lynchian abstraction, beginning with a car crash and then swerving through dreamy vignettes about Hollywood.\n\nWhat I can say is that, in taking this approach, Lynch is able to both paint the thin veil of understanding and then rip it off, exposing the guts.\n\nThe tropes are buried in there somewhere, I'm sure, but it's the depraved essence of Lynch's tablecloth trick that makes this a titan of the genre.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nMULHOLLAND DRIVE\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Los Angeles\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 83%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nTOON NOIR\n\n7. Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)\n\nIt's a story of a man, a woman, and a rabbit in a triangle of trouble\n\nOh yes.\n\nNot only is Who Framed Roger Rabbit a neo-noir movie, it’s one of the very best neo-noir movies.\n\nNowadays, the use of cartoon characters in a hybrid setting is worthy of an eye-roll (see: Smurfs, Yogi Bear, and, oh no, Sonic the Hedgehog). But, at the time, this was a skillful demonstration of this technological feat.\n\nIt wasn't just an empty gimmick either.\n\nThrusting a grizzled detective into the manic world of Toontown enhances both sides of the coin. And twenty-three entries into this list, I'm aware of how played out \"the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles\" feels. But the seedy underbelly of a cartoon world? Where violence is perpetrated with oversized mallets and slapstick?\n\nIt's so much fun you forget it’s satire.\n\nIf the uncompromising cynicism of the genre has made you weary, check this one out and see if you can stay half as pouty as Eddie Valiant.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nWHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Los Angeles\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 97%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nCAPE NOIR\n\n6. The Dark Knight (2008)\n\nWhy so serious?\n\nSometimes I feel like Dark Knight has become such a cornerstone in the validation of superhero movies that it's easy to forget that it actually is one of the best modern noir films.\n\nAnd it's not JUST because of Heath Ledger's Joker, though that's a factor.\n\nBatman has always been billed as the World's Greatest Detective! While he can punch a face with the best of them, he’s just as engrossing when he's digitally un-shattering a bullet or mass-surveilling an entire city. That detective side is great.\n\nThere’s been some debate lately as to whether or not superhero movies are “cinema.” Dark Knight is given credibility because it’s so serious, but I think the theatricality adds a lot too. His heroism can escalate beyond Travis Bickle's vigilantism (Taxi Driver) or David Mills' wrath (Se7en). It’s not just vacant cynicism; there’s hope.\n\nChristopher Nolan drew influence from Heat, and it shows. If we're going down the line from Night Moves to Heat to Dark Knight, we can see the full spectrum of good versus evil, love versus duty, trust versus betrayal, all raging an internal and external and eternal war.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTHE DARK KNIGHT\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Gotham City\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 94%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nHEADINESS IN NEO-NOIR\n\n5. Point Blank (1967)\n\nHe thrived on two kinds of people... his victims and his women\n\nWalker (Lee Marvin) is on a revenge quest after being shot by a criminal partner. His vendetta isn't a thriller so much as a haunting.\n\nPoint Blank is the earliest item on this list chronologically, releasing just nine years after Touch of Evil. It's weird how weird it already is.\n\nFuture generations of film noir get experimental, but you can see how close to the tree the apple has fallen. Point Blank has the jerky pacing of Drive, and it plays with time like Memento. Its \"unreality\" is like Enter the Void and its atmosphere is Lynchian.\n\nThere's a strong emphasis on sound design here, too. Footstep Foley art heightens into a rhythmic score while vocal belting backs a fight scene.\n\nThese qualities don't lessen the realism, they just enable it to be muddy and frantic — like a frenzied revenge should be.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nPOINT BLANK\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Los Angeles\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 94%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nTHE DECAY OF NEO-NOIR FILMS\n\n4. Taxi Driver (1976)\n\nYou talkin' to me?\n\nPersonally, I’m not a fan of Taxi Driver.\n\nBut the qualities that puts me off to it are the same qualities that make its impact on the genre unquestionable.\n\nIn Martin Scorsese’s take on film noir, the old lust for justice is subservient to the bureaucracy of politics. The hard-boiled antihero of the 1940s isn’t a smooth detective, he’s an awkward insomniac.\n\nAnd the femme fatale isn’t some long-legged seductress, she’s a twelve-year-old prostitute. In short, society is in ruins.\n\nAnd this isn’t even a fantasy film.\n\nAlmost all of the characters are unromantically flawed especially Travis, but they're just vehicles — pun intended — to drive us through the workings of the underbelly.\n\nScorsese takes the time to milk the urban landscapes set to the tune of a smooth jazz interlude that's all at once beautiful, haunting, and grating.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTAXI DRIVER\n\nUnderworld of Choice: New York City\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 98%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nLOVE IS [VENETIAN] BLIND\n\n3. Blue Velvet (1986)\n\nIt's a strange world\n\nWe’ve studied plenty of moral quandaries here, but not nearly enough sexual taboos. Blue Velvet addresses that.\n\nWhile this genre is undoubtedly provocative, rarely is it overtly sexual. But the undertone is always there.\n\nVirginal student Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) finds a severed ear and brings it to the police. He takes a practically voyeuristic interest in the case, leading him astray to the suspect Dorothy's apartment.\n\nLike any good detective, Jeffrey eventually earns his Venetian blinds — but they’re from the slits in a closet door as he watches Dorothy undress.\n\nIn this film, the kisses are awkward and the sex scene is demonic. Like... there’s fire. Increasingly surreal expressions of gender appear, including an embodiment of male id who repeatedly screams “fuck” and calls Dorothy “Tits.”\n\nAnd the town is called… anyway...\n\nAs Sandy (Laura Dern) wonders, it’s unclear if we’re watching a thriller about a detective or a pervert.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nBLUE VELVET\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Lumberton\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 95%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nPOSTMODERN NOIR\n\n2. Pulp Fiction (1994)\n\nYou won't know the facts until you've seen the fiction\n\nPulp Fiction doesn't shy away from its roots. They're right there in the title. Tarantino crafts a literary setting where his characters are meant to abide by the tropes, but they're all existentially unsettled by it.\n\nFor instance, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are criminals who overthink the meaning of things to the point of introspective.\n\nAs we follow this unhinged mosaic of time, all the journeys stray from the natural order of things into some twisted territory. Characters who historically stand for power are emasculated. Criminals interpret their plot armor as divine intervention. And someone uses a damn sword.\n\nMany people consider this film to be \"postmodern.\"\n\nThat's a label, it seems, that many films in the genre share. Particularly for directors like Tarantino, who hold Old Hollywood in high esteem, film noir was the modern standard and everything after that is made in its image.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nPULP FICTION\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Los Angeles\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 92%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nTHE BEST NEO-NOIR FILMS\n\n1. Chinatown (1974)\n\nForget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.\n\nListen.\n\nI doubt you'll find ANY list of neo-noir films that doesn't end with Chinatown. I don't think it's because it is the best neo-noir of all time, bar none, we peaked in the 1970s, everyone goes home. And I don't think it's even because it has the most vocal fans.\n\nBut Hollywood is about history.\n\nThis whole subgenre literally has \"neo\" in the title because it is intrinsically paying respect to its ancestors. So, if we're going to talk about influential films — even if your all-time favorite is Drive or Dark Knight or Fargo — you must leave a seat open at the table for Chinatown.\n\nAnd that's easy to do because it IS a masterful film.\n\nIt doesn't just riff on the noir formula. It updates it and recontextualizes. It resonates because it's a reminder that corruption and cynicism aren't just stylistic homages; they're oppressive systems ingrained into our lives, present even in the water we drink.\n\nSo forget it, Jake. It’s Chinatown.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nCHINATOWN\n\nUnderworld of Choice: Los Angeles\n\nRT Tomatometer Score: 99%\n\nWhere to watch\n\nUp Next\n\nBest Cyberpunk Movies\n\nNow that we’ve made through this list of neo-noir films, let’s go one step further into the future.
