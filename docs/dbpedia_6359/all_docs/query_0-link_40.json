        "text": "I loved Davi; I met him here in Toronto during the Italian film festival. He was sitting on a patio with a friend and he had all the time in the world to chat with my son and I-- more time to chat after he heard my son's name: Brando.\n\n\"Now that's a name!\" he exclaimed in that booming voice of his.\n\nThe best advice in screenwriting, and maybe @Brady can chime in, as well as @RC7: develop an amazing antagonist, because only the antagonist will make the protagonist great (think DH: Hans elevated the stakes and McClane was forced to answer the bell at every turn).\n\nSanchez/Davi elevated Bond/TD-- and I'm not a dalton fan, but thought he shined in the presence of Davi...\n\nAnd yes, @barryt007, Pam does have legs to die for (yum, yum!)\n\nIt was about 2009, @barryt007... Davi had directed his first film, DUKES. It was in the Italian Film Festival, and my family and I live near Little Italy. Strolling down the street, it was I who had caught the eye of someone familiar to me.\n\nI almost lost it.\n\nAt the time, my son was a huuuuuge 007 fan (presently, with a mixture of a teenage rebellion, and the lack lustre feelings he had for SP (he fell asleep and couldn't stand one of his favorite actors, Waltz, sleep walk through his role), he has little love for the films at the moment), so this chance meeting was a big deal for both of us.\n\nDavi was a very charming man!\n\nAnd agreed with Wheatley: such a little snot who turns into a valuable ally.\n\nThis is the most underrated film in the series. It's ironic that the first of the EON films not to draw its title directly from an Ian Fleming story is also the closest in spirit to Fleming since \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\"\n\nIn \"License to Kill\" continues what he started in \"The Living Daylights\": he portrays a Bond that is still an ultra-suave superagent, but is also moody and reckless -- in other words, human.\n\nSome elements of the story come from Fleming's short story \"The Hildebrand Rarity.\" Sanchez's doomed henchmen Milton Krest is lifted directly from \"The Hildebrand Rarity,\" and elements of the relationship between Sanchez and his girlfriend Lupe echo that of Krest and his wife Liz in the original story.\n\nThe other Fleming story drawn upon is \"Live and Let Die\" for the plot-driving scene in which Leiter is thrown to the sharks. (This marks the second time that Fleming's \"Live and Let Die\" was drawn upon for a key scene in a movie other than the film version of LALD. The other is the \"dragged behind a speedboat over the reef\" scene in \"For Your Eyes Only.\" It kind of makes you wonder what the powers that be at EON were thinking when they couldn't find a place for these powerful, effective scenes in the good but inferior LALD.\n\n\"License to Kill\" features a realistic, believable story. Add to it the equal ruthlessness of Bond and Sanchez in their respective portrayals by Dalton and Davi and you have a movie that will stand out over time as one of the best in the series.\n\nAs Fleming was often described as writing in an American thriller writer's style, unlike many other English authors. Perhaps LTK is infact closer in feel to what Fleming had in mind ? ;)\n\nHmm...possibly That still doesn't excuse some of the more generic moments in the film, which now come off as cheesy.\n\nVirtually all of the first 20 minutes\n\n\"There's only one law down there...Sanchez's law\"\n\n\"We have laws in this country too\"...\"do you have a law against what they did to Leiter?\"\n\n\"I just hope that little stunt of yours hasn't scared him off\"\n\nIt needed a bit more visual class and atmosphere...more like FRWL.\n\nMy current #2 favourite Bond film, has been known to be the #1, from time to time. Sanchez is one of the best Bond villains, his high price on loyalty is a unique trait.I really like Kamen's Bond theme, especially during the Tanker chase. I always feel compelled to crank up the volume during the wheelie. Given the more down to earth style of the Dalton era, it might look absurd, but it's sure a pure Bond moment. And then there is Dalton's performance, Bond has never, before or since, been so ruthless and determined in seeing his mission through to the end."
