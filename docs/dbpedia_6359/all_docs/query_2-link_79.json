        "text": "Types of Movie Genres and Examples of Popular Films from Each Genre\n\nSeveral movie genres and sub-genres exist. Here’s a quick round-up of the most popular film genres and different types of movies that one can identify or categorize under each one.\n\n1. Horror\n\nA genre that needs no introduction, horror films are meant to scare the living life out of the audience. Films from this genre generally include supernatural thrillers, occult stories, fictional monsters and ghost stories.\n\nThe Conjuring, The Grudge, Paranormal Activity and Annabelle are some good examples of successful horror films. In Indian cinema, films like Raat, Bhoot and Ragini MMS are out-and-out horror movies.\n\nHorror filmmakers use techniques like light, darkness, rapid camera movements, lengthy still shots, eerie background music, Foley sound effects and shock to create impact and scare viewers.\n\n2. Drama\n\nDrama films are often driven more by the characters and their struggles or the situations they face. While there are various types of drama films, including melodramas, historical dramas, courtroom dramas and even romantic dramas, the genre sticks to what is mentioned above to a large extent.\n\n12 Angry Men, Citizen Kane and Forrest Gump are good examples of movies from the drama genre. In terms of Indian films, Saaransh, Masoom and Shaurya are serious dramas.\n\nThis genre of movies involves a heavy focus on character development, conflict build-up, interpersonal relationship exploration and interaction.\n\n3. Comedy\n\nA cinema genre that everybody loves, comedies are meant to make you laugh and feel good. You can find different types of comedy films, including slapstick, satire, spoof, parody and romcom (romantic comedies).\n\nMovies like Four Weddings and a Funeral, Wedding Crashers and There’s Something About Mary are excellent examples of comedy films. Bollywood films like Andaaz Apna Apna, Golmaal, Angoor, Hungama and Garam Masala are rib-tickling laugh riots. And who can forget the evergreen Charlie Chaplin?\n\nGenerally, filmmakers use exaggeration, dialogue, costumes, makeup, one-liners, caricature, action and hilarious circumstances and various ways of provoking laughter.\n\n4. Action\n\nOne of the most famous movie genres is action. These films usually feature high-octane action, fights, stunts, and chase sequences. They typically follow a good vs. evil plot, including larger-than-life sequences involving physical fighting and weaponry.\n\nWhile many subgenres fall under this category, action is a much-loved and successful genre. Films like Deadpool, Taken, John Wick, Hobbs & Shaw are all examples of out-and-out action flicks. In Hindi cinema, action movies like Dus, Tiger Zinda Hai, Wanted, Dabangg, and Mohra are all classic examples of films that fall under this genre.\n\nMassive budgets, props, slick editing, and conflicts resulting from physical encounters are common elements of modern-day action films.\n\n5. Fantasy\n\nFantasy films, a genre that has gained a lot of steam over the last three decades, have caught millions of people's imaginations worldwide. It is no coincidence, either—the coming together of great ideas, imagination, and technological advances has resulted in visually stunning masterpieces like the Harry Potter series, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and most recently, the epic Game of Thrones series.\n\nAlthough Bollywood directors have explored this genre, we have yet to see a film of that scale or quality made on our borders.\n\nFantasy films usually involve detailed sets and many visual effects since they are about creating a world that doesn’t exist in real life.\n\nUnderstanding all film genres, history, and culture is a massive part of Seamedu’s filmmaking degree and diploma courses. Our faculty members, who have spent most of their lives in the film and television industry, bring their personal and professional experiences along with a good mix of theoretical knowledge and the legacy of cinema.\n\nThe next part of this article will discuss film categories like thrillers, romances, wars, crime, and documentaries. Watch this space for more!\n\nIn the meantime, tell us your favorite movies from each film above genre classifications in the comments section below."
