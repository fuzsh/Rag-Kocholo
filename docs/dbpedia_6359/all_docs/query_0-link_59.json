        "text": "James Bond is one of the single biggest names in pop culture. Modern pop culture really began to take hold in the 1940s, and James Bond first hit theaters in 1962 with Dr. No. Now, in 2024, we have 25 James Bond films (aside from the 1967 parody film Casino Royale, which had three actors play the infamous spy). He might even be the UK's most enduring export (behind imperialist colonialism), at least giving the Beatles a run for their money. And, surprisingly, even though a number of different actors have taken on the role, the James Bond timeline is, more or less, in chronological order.\n\n2021's No Time to Die marked what is most likely the final film from the sixth actor to play the role for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's film franchise, Daniel Craig. Right now, we're waiting to find out who will suit up as the seventh official Bond--just about every actor with a somewhat believable British accent has been floated; Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Godzilla, Kraven the Hunter) has been the frontrunner, but critics and fans have also floated names like Henry Cavill, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, Dev Patel, and others.\n\nIn March of 2022, just months after the release of the latest James Bond film No Time to Die, Amazon acquired MGM, the studio in charge of producing the films of the James Bond franchise. As a result, you'd think that most of the Bond movies would be available on Prime Video--right? While Prime Video does have more Bond movies than any other streaming service, though, you won't find any of the movies from the Sean Connery or Roger Moore years, among others. If you want to watch James Bond on streaming, you'll have to do a lot of renting.\n\nLet's dive in and find out where you can find the world's favorite super-spy.\n\nStar: Timothy Dalton\n\nWhere to Watch: Prime Video rent/buy\n\nFuture Bond actor Pierce Brosnan auditioned for, and was offered, the role of James Bond for this movie. At the time, he was also starring in the just-then-canceled television show Remington Steele (how many cool names does this guy get to play?!), and the announcement caused a surge in interest in that show, which NBC then renewed. The producers then dropped Brosnan, causing a drop in interest, and the cancellation of the show. Hollywood is weird. This is Timothy Dalton's first of two Bond films. The film is darker and more serious than many previous Bond films, and is often called humorless. Dalton is regarded as one of the better Bonds, though, bringing more to the role than Lazenby or Moore. Bond is tasked with helping a KGB general defect to the United States, and things get convoluted quickly, with betrayals, a faked assassination, a team-up with the Mujahideen (as required of all 1980s international action films), and more.\n\nStar: Timothy Dalton\n\nWhere to Watch: Prime Video rent/buy\n\nWhen Bond's friend Felix Leiter is nearly killed by a drug lord, Bond attempts to resign from his post as 007. M revokes his licence to kill--note the more-traditionally-British spelling in the title--and Bond goes rogue. This is the second and final Bond film to star Timothy Dalton, and was the final film for other cast and crew, including the screenwriter, the producer, the director, and the actors who played M and Moneypenny in many of the previous films. The film has received mixed reviews, with as many \"best of\" lists placing it at near the bottom as the top. As with Living Daylights, Dalton's Bond is darker and edgier than Roger Moore's Bond, which had come to be considered almost a parody of the character.\n\nStar: Pierce Brosnan\n\nWhere to Watch: Prime Video, Apple rent/buy\n\nGoldenEye arrived six years after the release of Licence to Kill, the longest gap twice over since the series' introduction in 1962. It was the first film in the series to debut after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a frequent foe in the series' history, and used that as a focus. This film also happened to be paired with the seminal first-person shooter game of the same name, a game fondly remembered by fans for both its watershed multiplayer mode and its rad pause music, though it didn't actually release for another two years. This is also the first Bond film to not use any elements from the works of Bond creator Ian Fleming, who died in 1964 just as the series was taking off. Brosnan's Bond faces off against a rogue MI6 agent, Alec Trevelyan, played by Sean Bean, to prevent him from using the GoldenEye satellite to attack London. This movie also was the first to cast Judi Dench as M, making her the first woman to step into the role.\n\nStar: Daniel Craig\n\nWhere to Watch: Paramount+,Prime Video rent/buy\n\nAfter the campy Die Another Day and Pierce Brosnan's retirement, it was time to recast the character and reexamine what people wanted from Bond movies. Daniel Craig was cast in the role and was, at first, soundly rejected by fans as \"James Blond.\" These days, many consider him second only to Connery, returning to the more-thuggish Bond of the early days. Casino Royale was also the first time in 17 years that a Bond movie was based on an Ian Fleming story. Casino Royale was overlooked except as a parody film previously, but became a way to explore a less-experienced Bond. This film introduced the world to not just Daniel Craig, but also to Mads Mikkelsen, who played the villainous financier Le Chiffre. Casino Royale is considered to be among the best of the series.\n\nStar: Daniel Craig\n\nWhere to Watch: Prime Video\n\nWhere Quantum of Solace was once again a middling entry in the series, Skyfall received mostly positive reviews. This entry introduces Javier Bardem's Raoul Silva--a cyberterrorist with an axe to grind with the MI6 organization--of which Bond is a part. This movie introduces a new Q, played by Ben Whishaw; the character had been absent for two films, partly out of a desire to keep the Bond character more grounded. It's hard to stay grounded when you have a briefcase that has enough tricks to seem more like an accessory for the Joker than for James Bond. This Q is, like Craig's Bond, less experienced--he plugs a computer of unknown origin into the MI6 network, which is truly the least plausible thing that has happened in the entire Bond franchise. Even a computer-store tech-support staffer knows better."
