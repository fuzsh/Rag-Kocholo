        "text": "BRIT actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson is taking his martinis shaken, not stirred, after being formally offered the job as the new James Bond.\n\nInsiders said the Kick-Ass movie star is expected to accept the role as 007, taking over from Daniel Craig, who has played MI6’s most famous spy for 15 years.\n\nEon Productions, which makes the spy thriller films, is on course to start shooting this year.\n\nA source said: “Bond is Aaron’s job, should he wish to accept it. The formal offer is on the table and they are waiting to hear back.\n\n“As far as Eon is concerned, Aaron is going to sign his contract in the coming days and they can start preparing for the big announcement.”\n\nThe next Bond movie had been delayed because of last year’s Hollywood strikes.\n\nBut insiders confirmed a script was now being worked on, with production scheduled to take place at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire.\n\nAaron, 33, was in the running for the top job alongside actors including Oscar-winning Cillian Murphy, Idris Elba, Henry Cavill and James Norton.\n\nToday, bookie Coral changed the odds on Aaron taking on the famous role — first played by Sean Connery in 1962’s Dr No — and made him favourite at 2/1.\n\nWhen asked last week whether he would step into Bond’s shoes, Aaron said: “I find it charming and wonderful that people see me in that role. I take it as a great compliment.”\n\nIn 2022, The Sun revealed that he was in the running for the job after secretly screen testing for Bond movie supremo Barbara Broccoli at Pinewood Studios.\n\nAaron, who is from High Wycombe, Bucks, made a name for himself starring in the Kick-Ass and Avengers movies.\n\nHe started his acting career in 2000’s The Apocalypse, opposite Richard Harris, and appeared in 2008 teen movie Angus, Thongs And Perfect Snogging and 2022’s Bullet Train with Brad Pitt.\n\nInsiders said Aaron’s performance as a psychopath in 2016 thriller Nocturnal Animals, which saw him win a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor, opened the door to the Bond role.\n\nA source said: “Aaron may not be the best known in his field but he is an incredibly talented actor.\n\n“His role in Nocturnal Animals showed his depth as an actor.\n\n“He is the perfect person to play Bond and will pick up well from where Daniel left off.”\n\nCraig, 56, put down his Walther PPK pistol for the final time after 2021’s No Time To Die.\n\nIt ended with a shocking finale in which Bond is apparently killed off.\n\nSo with 007 seemingly dead, it is unclear where the next movie will fit in the timeline.\n\nThe last film made more than £600million at the global box office.\n\nDaniel also starred in 2006’s Casino Royale, Quantum Of Solace in 2008, 2012’s Skyfall and Spectre in 2015.\n\nBut he grew to resent the role and came under fire for saying he would rather “slash my wrists” than play 007 again.\n\nAaron’s personal life has previously generated more interest than his acting career.\n\nHe married filmmaker Sam Taylor-Wood, 57, in June 2012, four years after they met on the set of Nowhere Boy — which she directed and he starred in.\n\nWhen they started dating, Aaron was 18 and Sam was 42.\n\nTalking about their relationship, Aaron said: “I think we’re really great at collaborating but that’s not why I fell in love with her.\n\n“I’ve got really nothing to hide and I’m secure in what we have.”\n\nAaron and Fifty Shades of Grey director Sam married at private member’s club Babington House in Somerset and have two daughters, Wylda, 13, and Romy, 11.\n\nHe is also stepfather to Sam’s two daughters, Angelica, 25, and Jessie, 15, from her marriage to art dealer Jay Jopling.\n\nAaron has said of life as a parent: “I enjoy the normality of things, the everyday stuff.\n\n“Getting my kids ready in the mornings, taking them to school and activities. That feeds my soul.\n\n“I knew I was going to have a big family. I knew I was going to be a young father. I knew I was going to have many kids.”\n\nSam spoke about falling for Aaron on the Nowhere Boy set but insisted nothing happened until filming had ended.\n\nShe said: “I managed to hold off really until almost the end of the film.\n\n“We weren’t even together then. Maybe feelings were there but un-acted upon.\n\n“The thing is, we had quite a psychic link when working together.\n\n“I knew from a flicker of an eyelash what kind of performance I was going to get.\n\n“I felt that link almost from day one of meeting him.”\n\nThe couple, who live in London, are rarely seen together in public but often share photos of one another on social media.\n\nAaron celebrated Sam’s birthday last week with a black and white picture of them together.\n\nHe posted: “You’re an exceptional woman, there’s really no one quite like you. I couldn’t be more proud and excited for this year ahead.”\n\nSam has directed Back to Black, the Amy Winehouse biopic, which is out on April 12.\n\nAaron has a new Marvel film, Kraven the Hunter, out later this year.\n\nBond boss Barbara previously confirmed they would be casting a man in the 007 role despite calls for a woman to step in.\n\nShe said in 2020: “James Bond can be of any colour, but he is male. I believe we should be creating new characters for women.”\n\nSIX ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED 007\n\nSEAN Connery was the first James Bond.\n\nHe made his debut in 1962’s Dr No, starring in seven 007 films until 1983.\n\nBut he was not 007 creator Ian Fleming’s choice.\n\nHe thought the 6ft 2in Scot was not refined enough for the role.\n\nAUSTRALIAN actor George Lazenby played Bond just once in 1969’s On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.\n\nHe never signed a contract for the role and was reportedly persuaded by his agent not to stay on as the character would soon seem outdated.\n\nROGER Moore made his debut as 007 in 1973’s Live And Let Die and stayed for seven films.\n\nA TV actor, he was known as Simon Templar in The Saint and in The Persuaders!.\n\nHis last outing was 1985’s A View To A Kill.\n\nTIMOTHY Dalton played Bond only twice, once in 1987’s The Living Daylights and later in 1989’s Licence To Kill.\n\nHis portrayal was darker and more serious than his predecessors, with the actor wanting him to be less of a womaniser.\n\nPIERCE Brosnan made his 007 debut in 1995’s GoldenEye and went on to play the spy three more times.\n\nHe pushed for Bond to stop smoking, saying: “Smoking causes cancer therefore he doesn’t smoke.”\n\nHis last film was 2002’s Die Another Day.\n\nDANIEL Craig revamped the James Bond franchise with 2006’s Casino Royale.\n\nFans were initially not happy with his casting, setting up a petition against it.\n\nBut he became a much-loved 007, ending with 2021’s No Time To Die."
