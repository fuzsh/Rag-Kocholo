        "text": "Jason Statham has landed another starring role in a new untitled action-thriller, which comes from director Baltasar Kormákur (Everest, Two Guns).\n\nIn the film, Statham plays a character named Mason “who lives in isolation on a remote Scottish island. When he rescues a young girl from the ocean in a terrible storm, he sets a chain of events in motion that brings a violent attack to his hideaway, forcing him back into the world to confront the ghosts of his past.”\n\nJudging from this first information, there’s nothing different or unique about the story as it’s something we’ve seen a hundred times before. But, Statham tends to make fun flicks, so lets see how it turns out!\n\nThe film is set up at Black Bear, and producer John Friedberg said in a statement: “The combination of Jason’s unparalleled skill in explosive action and track record in the genre, with Balt’s elevated, kinetic filmmaking style that always keeps character and story in the foreground is undeniable.”\n\nHe added: “We’re thrilled to bring this new action franchise to life with such talented partners as Balt and Jason and can’t wait to introduce the world to Michael Mason.”\n\nThe movie is set to start production in November in the UK and Iceland with production services and filming to take place at Kormákur’s RVK Studios facility in Reykjavik. The script comes from Ward Parry."
