        "text": "Hey all,\n\nIf this topic has been brought up before I apologize in advance and I know little bits have surfaced in discussions here, but a recent conversation with a fellow Bond fan from work prompted me to ask this question. I did not get a chance to really get deeper into it with him at the time, but he pretty much told me that recently he tried to Watch LTK and couldn't even get half way through it. Also alot of reviewers on youtube and other venues seem to rip on this movie relentlessly. Now I know alot of people on these forums do indeed like this moive, myself included although I do still prefer TLD, but I'm curious as to why there is such extreme hatred for this film? I mean people who hate it REALLY hate it. Now I may be blinded a bit admittedly because I'm a fan of Dalton, but I'm curious what the extreme hatred is.\n\nThanks Guys and Gals!\n\nThe consensus is probably that there is only very little consensus. While the actual underwhelming performance of LTK at the box office is not really a topic of debate the actual reasons for this are still perceived as enormously varied: heavy-weight competitors, cuts in budget, lack of sufficiently exotic locales, lack of a satisfying amount of typical Bond ingredients, imbalance between down-to-earth action and a few silly gadget moments thrown into the mix, lack of a halfway-decent promotional campaign - the posters are just horrible - and a general feeling of 'cheap' where the production design should not have gone for less than 'fantastic'. Add to that a story that thematically was too close to an already beyond its 'best before' TV series and you've covered most bases. Some mention that Dalton supposedly wasn't a favourite with the female US audience, but it's debatable how much of an issue this really was. Two years before American women seemed to be happy enough with Dalton, I doubt they all just changed their minds in time for LTK. And back then the Bond films target audience was still mostly underage males, so a failure with female audiences could not have explained the actual box office.\n\nAs Dustin said, there is very little consensus on what really sunk LTK in the US. For me personally, I think these 3 factors were the most instrumental in LTK's box office fate:\n\n1) Absolutely brutal competition in the summer of '89. That summer is still legendary to this day.\n\n2) An abysmal promotional campaign. Bad posters, bad trailers that inspired apathy instead of excitement.\n\n3) The series had become too familiar to audiences, particularly after Roger Moore's 2-movies-too-far run and an every-other-year release schedule.\n\nI also recall reviews at the time being fairly toxic, most of them hinging on the fact that the film was \"not fun.\"\n\nAll valid points, I think. There was also the controversy, in the UK, about this being the first Bond film rated a \"15\" - prior to this all the Bond films carried an \"A\", or as I think it is now, \"12\" rating. If the Bonds at the time were aimed at a \"family\" audience (or \"underage males\" as Dustin states above) then a \"15\" rating in Bond's backyard wouldn't help with the box office.\n\nThe irony is, of course, that Daniel Craig's movies have been at times as violent as LTK yet did not attract a \"15\" rating - and raked in millions. How times have changed!\n\nI am a Dalton fan, I very much enjoyed both his Bond films, but there were times in LTK when it seemed the film makers were trying too hard to be \"tough\", as if the audience couldn't differentiate between Dalton's Bond and Moore's Bond without some extra added brutality thrown in on screen. But then I've always thought the hiring of Dalton should have meant new screenwriters and possibly a new director being brought in too. What we had instead was a Bond actor taking the part and trying to take his films in one direction with a production team used to taking a different route. And at times it showed.\n\nThe competition and the horrific marketing campaign played a great deal into it, I think. The posters, save for the blue-ish \"B\" poster which is actually a decent piece of artwork, are just terrible. The red-ish one they used as the final US poster is, IMO, one of the worst posters I've ever seen. The failure of the marketing department on that front is baffling, especially when they had this brilliant publicity shot that was meant for a poster at one time and went unused:\n\nhttp://www.corbisima...05-eb8fcd2a1092\n\nThere obviously other factors that played into it as well, but the poster campaign was one of the factors in the poor US performance of LTK that was completely under the control of the studio, and they botched it big time. Audiences being tired of Bond at that point isn't necessarily something that they can control, at least not in the immediate present of making and marketing the film, but they could have at least tried to counteract other forces that were working against the film with a good marketing push, and they didn't.\n\nHave to agree with all these points brought up again. There was a pretty thorough and intense debate on this topic on a CBn thread around 2005/6 or so, but I can't find it either. Like OHMSS, LTK took time to find its audience and place within the Bond canon. This film tested better with preview audiences than any other Bond film before. It also did great business in the rest of the world. But back in the summer of '89...\n\nThat was the summer of Batman. Also, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Lethal Weapon 2 felt more like Bond movies than Dalton's second outing did. In addition, there was Star Trek V, Ghostbusters 2, When Harry Met Sally, blockbusters and sleeper hits crowding the theaters. Indeed, a 007 film hasn't been released in the summer since.\n\nMarketing--there was even a TV commercial with a rap song for Bond. As if the poster campaign wasn't bad enough, despite some very good art work done by Bob Peak when the film was called 'Licence Revoked.' The studio didn't seem to know how to handle the title change either. Also, the publicity machine didn't adequately prepare the public or the critics for the dark, gritty, serious tone of this Bond film, which brings us too...\n\nReviews--one critic in San Diego called it \"Oh-Oh-Awful\" after showing the 'more of a problem eliminator' clip which was recently tagged as one of Dalton's best moments in another thread. Sheila Benson in the L.A. Times wrote, \"it's the first non-Fleming title and the furthest in spirit from it\" which betrays that she hadn't read Fleming since a third of the movie is from Fleming source material (Live and Let Die, The Hildebrand Rarity.) Now it looks like LTK was ahead of its time, but then it appeared to be a misfire, or at least out of tune with audience expectations.\n\nLicence to Kill has always been one of my top three Bond films, but back then I felt it was hampered by its title tune and film score. Gladys Knight didn't fit the Latin locale, nor did Patti Labelle even with a better Bond song, \"If You Asked Me Too.\" While I've grown to appreciate Michael Kamen's score, I missed John Barry at the time. Having recently watched it, the set of Krest's warehouse just screams cheap made for TV movie (which is ironic when the character later says \"I spent a fortune building that cover.\") It also drags in places, but is punctuated by some of the best stunts ever in a Bond movie (water ski, truck chase.) While its violence is in your face in places (both Krest's and Heller's deaths, Sanchez' whip, Leiter's shark attack and wife's death), it's nowhere near the death toll of other Bond films. Personally, I find Tomorrow Never Dies' casual machine gun violence far more disturbing, and Quantum of Solace's violence more unsettling. But back then it was pretty jarring (even though Lethal Weapon 2 had a decapitation and Last Crusade plenty of face melting) at least, for a Bond film.\n\nAs polarizing as it is, the film holds up pretty well and its plot is still believable today, which has helped its status in finding its place.\n\nEdited by Professor Pi, 22 June 2013 - 07:02 PM.\n\nMy main issues with this film (apart from the fact that it does not look or sound like a Bond film):\n\npace\n\nI have to struggle to stay awake throughout the movie. The first part in Key West is somewhat boring. And when we come to \"Isthmus City\" the movie enters a whole new dimension of dullness. Sanchez speech to the Chinese is always the point where I nearly nod off...\n\nDalton's Bond\n\nBond walks into the Barrelhead Bar looking as tense and nervous as always. Thankfully, the more experienced Pam is there to calm him down. But Bond is still mad at her. They end up in a random fight but Bond freaks out when he thinks that Pam has been shoot, and then freaks out again when he realize that they are out of gas.\n\nI don't mind Bond being angry, overstressed, anxious or upset. It just becomes a little bit tedious once you realize that this is the only way Dalton can do Bond.\n\nOther minor issues:\n\nLocations (very little variation)\n\nThe girls trying to act\n\nBad language (american slang)\n\nRobert Davi's villain (he wont hurt you if you are nice to him)\n\nKamen's music (Leathal Weapon VII)\n\nDEA agents in slow motion.\n\nThere were two things working against each other in LTK in 1988/89 -- the change to a harder, more serious style and the approach from the marketing side that since it's a Bond movie we'll just throw it out there and the audience will line up at the box office because they did for all the previous films.\n\nThe marketing campaign began at Xmas of '88. Smartly, they attached a teaser trailer before Rain Man, which was a huge critical and box office hit, not to mention Best Picture winner. I was pleasantly surprised to see the trailer when I saw Rain Man the day it was released. It was still there even when the film was playng second-run theaters that spring. I later saw the first full trailer in May before the notorious Road House. Yes, I paid to see that in the cinema. While I was excited to see it, I can't recall the reaction, if any, from the rest of the crowd, many of whom hooted at Road House.\n\nWhile that was all well and good, it seems like MGM/UA sort of coasted when it came to summer. While the later July release date worked for TLD here in the U.S. it seems to have worked against it in '89. I didn't watch a whole lot of prime time TV then so I can't recall if there were numerous ads the way there were for subsequent films. Even MTV, where all the new films pushed for time, didn't seem to show many LTK ads.Though there was a special I recall.\n\nI still believe if they'd held LTK back until the fall/holiday season it would have had a much better chance at the box office as Tango and Cash was the only real action competition that season.\n\nThe harder style may have also hurt the chances for repeat business. Whereas it seems the Craig films have had a lot of repeat business, LTK was an experiement of sorts with the harder-hitting manner yet still had a lot of amateurish acting in it from the girls and minor cast members. TLD ran in drive-in theaters in my area and I don't recall LTK getting that chance. It was even dropped from first-run to the second-run theater after only about 2 weeks. And this was when the new releases slowed down a bit.\n\nA bore...Not only in comparison with the wonderful Batman and Indy Jones 2 the same year, but compared with other Bonds.\n\nAfter the embarassment of the producers carrying on with Roger Moore for far too long (should have gone out after Octopussy, and even in that one he was obviously not in Bondian shape, and it had an awful attempt at humor with the Tarzan yell but it was FUN), and the awfulness of so many moments during Roger's long reign (the awful attempts at humor, the too young ice skater in FYEO, the disinterested female lead in the final Moore portrayal), Bond afficionados were QUITE ready for a new, back-to-the-books and back-to-the-cinema-spirit Bond...and, even in TLD Dalton was a snore. He seemed so often to lack confidence. Is Bond uncertain at times in the Connery films and in the books ? Sure ! But he does not look like a nervous schoolboy. In TLD when he stands with his leg turned inward, he conveys vulnerability, not cojones. I could not stand that moment then and every time I recall it since then, the same. It was enough to turn the audience off to him being accepted and liked as Bond. The next picture was just an episode of waiting for this guy to be done so we can move on.\n\nOf course, besides the actor, the script for LTK was horrendous. It WASTED several good scenes from the books, quite unfortunately, and it WASTED a great henchman, played by a quite young Benicio Del Toro. The villain was just another criminal. A guy we'd seen in other stuff who just did not belong in a Bond movie. He was great in Die Hard as a jerk FBI agent....was he worthy of being the villain in the film ? No, of course not ! They casted the very fine Alan Rickman and HE played a memorable and menacing villain. The story and plot were far too reminiscent of TV shows. Not even a TV movie, just a show. Horrible.\n\nThey wasted a good actor, Dalton, with him playing an unimpressive Bond, and with boring, dull scripts. I don't think Dalton was handsome or dashing to most of the audience, either. That may be a reflection of the scripts. Had the stories been more exciting and the scenes more glamorous and grand, it might have helped.\n\nI've read Fleming in full, and been going to see these films since the first, and Roger's era was understandably a change of approach (the light-heartedness which started, actually, in DAF, so you could see it coming, but which was marred by his rough mistreatment of non-deserving ladies, apparently to make him seem tough -- but for roughing up a lady, really ???). But that went on too long because they became ridiculous (MR) and, even after they reigned it in they could not resist some awfulness (young girl skater whom Bond must explicitly turn away making his age an open issue), they went on one film too long -- wasting some interesting ideas and actors (Christopher Walken's villain, May Day) which all would have worked well with a younger Bond. Then, the purgatory of the Dalton films which a fan just had to wait out until it was done. When they finally got the young, handsome, dashing Pierce Brosnan up for it, it was QUITE the relief and hit the right notes. Certainly, DAD went overboard (and the computer graphics were worse than in a child's tv show when he \"surfed\" the icy tsunami), but Pierce did it right and the stories were not just cop show drug busts. The Craig films have been superb. I realize QOS suffered from the strike the year it was made, but it still stands well above the embarassments and the dreary sufferings in prior years...\n\nI agree with most of the reasons posted above. Regardless of how Bond fans feel about the film (and opinions are all over the map), the real issue is whether LTK was what the public wanted in the Summer of '89, and the answer seems to have been \"not so much.\"\n\nFor one thing, Bond was old hat by '89, and LTK didn't even make the standard promise of being the \"biggest yet\" (\"fresh\" had gone out the window long before, but until now they always at least promised each one would be more grand). Meanwhile \"Batman\" was a genuine novelty, returning the character to the screen after a 23-year (!) hiatus, and redefining the character so radically from the way the general public had seen him up to that time -- as the Adam West \"Bif Bang Pow\" version -- that it could be argued it was something entirely new. Last Crusade was perceived as the end of the Indiana Jones trilogy (would that it were so!) and so had a sense of importance to it, plus the added draw of Sean Connery in probably the best piece of \"stunt casting\" ever. The Lethal Weapon franchise was at a peak in popularity. What did LTK offer against them, except a lead who was more low-key than any of his predecessors, in a film that scaled the Bond formula down to a bare-bones shadow of its former self, with a comparatively down-to-Earth (one might even argue TV-scale) adventure that, yes, got very little marketing (and what there was of it was dull).\n\nReally, I think it was just a miscalculation to go with a more Earth-bound, serious (as in \"less fun\") and cheaper (or cheaper-looking, anyway) approach when competing against films that were going ever bigger, more fanciful and more expensive. The Bond series wrote the book when it came to BIG cinema experiences, but in '89 it was the smallest dog in the fight. And as we were 27 years in, with entries dependably cranked out every two years, I think a lot of people probably thought \"let this one pass; the next one will be here soon enough.\" Little did we know...\n\nIn other words, regardless of whether you like your Bonds over-the-top or more \"realistic,\" fun romps or nail-biting thrillers, a key to the Bond success story has been making each new entry seem like one of the year's big events. No entry in my lifetime felt less like an event than LTK. Part of that's down to the film itself, part to the marketing. So yes, some people responded negatively to LTK, but the bigger problem was that too many people responded with indifference, and that's a recipe for box office disaster."
