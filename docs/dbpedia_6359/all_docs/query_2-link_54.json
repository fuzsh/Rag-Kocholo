        "text": "If you’re ready to be thrilled, look no further. Plenty of thrillers have already been released in 2023, and there are more movies to come that aim to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. This year, we’ve got everything from dinosaurs to super-secret spies to cocaine bears. (Yep, that last one is exactly what it sounds like. Don’t think too hard about it.)\n\nKicking off the year, twist king M. Night Shyamalan returned with Knock at the Cabin, a movie in which Ron Weasley threatens a family with a warning about the apocalypse (well, you know, essentially). There's also 65, which shows us what happens when a man from the future ends up back on Earth… but the Earth that existed 65 million years ago. (What happens is dinosaurs. Lots of them.) The fourth John Wick movie was also released, which saw Keanu Reeves return for a fourth round of action.\n\nStill to come this year, there's the latest Agatha Christie mystery from Kenneth Branagh—this time, he's joined by Tina Fey, Jamie Dornan, and Michelle Yeoh. You can also check out the erotic thriller Fair Play about why you shouldn't fall in love while working at a hedge fund. Plus, thriller fans can also look forward to a new movie from director David Fincher, who is adapting a graphic novel about an assassin.\n\nRead on to find out which 2023 thrillers are for you, watch all of their trailers, and learn when and where you can check out these brand-new films.\n\nPlane\n\nAvailable on VOD now\n\nPlane is about a pilot (Gerard Butler) who makes an emergency landing of an airplane only for the passengers to be taken hostage and held for ransom by terrorists. And those two major problems aren’t the only issues: The pilot also has to work together with a prisoner (Mike Colter), who has been charged with murder and is being transported on the plane.\n\nMissing\n\nAvailable on Netflix now\n\nThe 2018 movie Searching gave audiences something they’d never seen before as the entire movie took place on computer and phone screens. The follow-up, Missing, tells a new story in the same way. This time, a teenage girl (Storm Reid) is trying to locate her mother (Nia Long), who went missing during a trip to Colombia, but she soon learns her mom isn’t who she thought.\n\nSTREAM NOW\n\nKnock at the Cabin\n\nAvailable on Amazon Prime Video now\n\nThe latest from director M. Night Shyamalan is adapted from the 2018 book The Cabin at the End of the World by Paul G. Tremblay. It’s about a couple vacationing in a cabin with their young daughter when four mysterious people appear and present them with an impossible choice involving the apocalypse.\n\nCocaine Bear\n\nAvailable on Peacock now\n\nCocaine Bear is a dark comedy and a thriller, and it’s about exactly what the title says. Inspired by a true story (yep, really), the film from director Elizabeth Banks is about a bear that eats a bunch of cocaine and goes on a killing spree in 1985. (The real bear only did the eating a bunch of cocaine part.)\n\n65\n\nAvailable on Netflix now\n\nSci-fi thriller 65 stars Adam Driver as a spaceship pilot from the future who crash-lands on an unknown planet only to find out that it’s Earth 65 million years ago. You know what that means: dinosaurs. The pilot then has to find a way to escape along with a young girl (Ariana Greenblatt), who is the only other surviving passenger he finds.\n\nSTREAM NOW\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4\n\nAvailable on VOD now\n\nKeanu Reeves returns as John Wick for the fourth movie in the franchise. The hit man faces off against the international crime lords of the High Table once again. Costars include Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsgård, and Laurence Fishburne.\n\nMaster Gardener\n\nAvailable on VOD now\n\nJoel Edgerton and Sigourney Weaver star in Master Gardener, about a horticulturalist who works on a wealthy woman’s estate. When the woman insists that he hire her niece (Quintessa Swindell) as an apprentice, dark secrets from his past come to light.\n\nThe Mother\n\nAvailable on Netflix now\n\n\"I'm a killer, but I'm also a mother,\" Jennifer Lopez says in the trailer for The Mother, and that just about sums it up. Lopez stars in the action-thriller as an assassin, who reunites with the daughter she was forced to give up at birth in order to protect the young girl from her own violent past.\n\nSTREAM NOW\n\nSanctuary\n\nAvailable on VOD now\n\nSanctuary stars Margaret Qualley and Christopher Abbott as a dominatrix, Rebecca, and the rich heir to a hotel chain, Hal, who are engaging in a secret relationship. The movie follows the heir's attempt to end their arrangement while the dominatrix argues that she has the right to some of his money since she helped him in his business career.\n\nExtraction 2\n\nOn Netflix now\n\nIt might have seemed like Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) died at the end of the first Extraction movie, but that’s clearly not the case. The Australian special forces member turned black ops mercenary is back for more action and a brand-new mission in the Netflix sequel.\n\nSTREAM NOW\n\nOppenheimer\n\nIn theaters now\n\nOppenheimer is a biopic of Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who was one of the inventors of the atomic bomb.

Heart of Stone?). Expect car chases, explosions, and stunts on stunts on stunts. Jamie Dornan and Alia Bhatt costar.\n\nSTREAM NOW\n\nA Haunting in Venice\n\nIn theaters Sept. 15\n\nA Haunting in Venice is the latest Agatha Christie mystery adaptation from director and star Kenneth Branagh, following 2017's Murder on the Orient Express and 2022's Death on the Nile.

The weapon is a child. Co-stars include Gemma Chan, Ken Watanabe, and Allison Janney.\n\nBUY TICKETS HERE\n\nFair Play\n\nIn limited theaters Sept. 29. On Netflix Oct. 13\n\nPhoebe Dynevor and Alden Ehrenreich star in the erotic thriller Fair Play about an engaged couple who also work together at a hedge fund.

Don't date your co-workers?\n\nBUY TICKETS HERE\n\nSTREAM HERE\n\nThe Killer\n\nOn Netflix Nov. 10\n\nDavid Fincher is known for making thrillers, and his latest film is no different.
