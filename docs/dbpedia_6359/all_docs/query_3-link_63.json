        "text": "How do you watch the James Bond movies in order? It took a little longer than expected, but No Time To Die finally made it to cinemas in September 2021. 007 first hit cinema screens in 1962 (nine years after Ian Fleming’s first Bond novel, Casino Royale, was published). Since then, he has spent decades defeating supervillains and criminal masterminds, seducing beautiful women and drinking lots of Martini.\n\nThe latest new movie in the spy movie franchise was hugely successful, despite the obvious limitations of the pandemic. No Time To Die featured many of the familiar elements we associate with 007 – stunts, car chases, and evil plots aplenty. But, while much has stayed the same for our suave super-spy over the past 60 years, there have been many changes too (and we don’t just mean the lead actor and movie villains, a more enlightened role for the women, and fewer safari suits).\n\nSo get your tuxedo on, dig out your license to kill and join us on a multi-action movie mission debriefing, which explains how to watch the James Bond movies in order.\n\nHow do I watch all the James Bond movies in order?\n\nDr. No\n\nFrom Russia with Love\n\nGoldfinger\n\nThunderball\n\nYou Only Live Twice\n\nOn Her Majesty’s Secret Service\n\nDiamonds Are Forever\n\nLive and Let Die\n\nThe Man with the Golden Gun\n\nThe Spy Who Loved Me\n\nMoonraker\n\nFor Your Eyes Only\n\nOctopussy\n\nA View to a Kill\n\nThe Living Daylights\n\nLicence to Kill\n\nGoldenEye\n\nTomorrow Never Dies\n\nThe World Is Not Enough\n\nDie Another Day\n\nCasino Royale\n\nQuantum of Solace\n\nSkyfall\n\nSpectre\n\nNo Time to Die\n\nDr. No (1962)\n\nBond: Sean Connery\n\nDirector: Terence Young\n\nTheme song: The Bond theme\n\nMain villain: The metal-handed Dr No, who plans to use radio waves to sabotage a US space mission.\n\nFirst appearance: M (Bernard Lee); Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell); Felix Leiter; SPECTRE; the gun barrel opening sequence.\n\nTop stunt: A hard-as-nails fisticuffs between Bond driver, Mr Jones.\n\nMemorable for: Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder, emerging from the sea; the trio of assassins known as The Three Blind Mice; a calypso vibe; a cool, science fiction villain’s base.\n\nFrom Russia With Love (1963)\n\nBond: Sean Connery\n\nDirector: Terence Young\n\nTheme song: From Russia With Love, performed by Matt Monro (used over the end titles)\n\nMain villain: Donald Grant (Robert Shaw), an assassin hired by SPECTRE to kill Bond in revenge for killing Dr No.\n\nTop stunt: Bond vs Grant train carriage fight.\n\nFirst appearance: Desmond Llewelyn as Q; Blofeld (uncredited); a pre-credit scene; a “Bond will return in…” credit.\n\nMemorable for: Rosa Klebb going after Bond with a poisoned knife in her shoe.\n\nGoldfinger (1964)\n\nBond: Sean Connery\n\nDirector: Guy Hamilton\n\nTheme song: Goldfinger, performed by Shirley Bassey\n\nMain villain: Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe) who plans an audacious heist in Fort Knox.\n\nTop stunt: In the series’ first iconic car chase, Bond’s Aston Martin comes with all kinds of deadly optional extras.\n\nFirst appearance: The Aston Martin DB5\n\nMemorable for: “No Mr Bond, I expect you to die” – Goldfinger threatening to bisect Bond with a laser; henchman Oddjob, with his blade-brimmed bowler hat; Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore.\n\nThunderball (1965)\n\nBond: Sean Connery\n\nDirector: Terence Young\n\nTheme song: Thunderball, performed by Tom Jones\n\nMain villain: Eyepatch-wearing SPECTRE agent Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi), who blackmails NATO using their own stolen warheads.\n\nTop stunt: Bond escapes the bad guys using a personal jet pack.\n\nMemorable for: A bad guy disguised as a grieving widow; lots of underwater action; Bond in a red wetsuit; lots of harpooning.\n\nYou Only Live Twice (1967)\n\nBond: Sean Connery\n\nDirector: Lewis Gilbert\n\nTheme song: You Only Live Twice, performed by Nancy Sinatra\n\nMain villain: Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Donald Pleasence), who hijacks US and Soviet space shuttles in an attempt to ignite a war.\n\nTop stunt: The entire sequence with ninjas infiltrating Blofeld’s volcanic lair.\n\nMemorable for: Bond faking his own death; Blofeld’s awesome lair in a volcano; Bond flying an autogyro called Little Nellie.\n\nOn Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969)\n\nBond: George Lazenby\n\nDirector: Peter R.

tapping into the blaxploitation genre; a henchman with a metal claw hand; a comedy US cop; Moore’s eyebrow-raised quipping – though this film is quite dark in places, Moore’s era would become increasingly silly and ready to jump on cinematic bandwagons.\n\nThe Man with the Golden Gun (1974)\n\nBond: Roger Moore\n\nDirector: Guy Hamilton\n\nTheme song: The Man with the Golden Gun, performed by Lulu\n\nMain villain: Legendary hitman Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee) who wants to pit his skills against the renowned James Bond.\n\nTop stunt: Bond corkscrews a car while leaping a river.\n\nFirst appearance: Bill Tanner, MI6 chief of staff (who’ll be played by various actors in coming films)\n\nMemorable for: Not being called The Man With Three Nipples (Scaramanga’s other claim to infamy);

a ship that opens at the front to swallow other ships; the innuendo-drenched last line: “Keeping the British end up, sir.”\n\nMoonraker (1979)\n\nBond: Roger Moore\n\nDirector: Lewis Gilbert\n\nTheme song: Moonraker, performed by Shirley Bassey\n\nMain villain: Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale), whose plan is the same as Karl Stromberg’s only set in space\n\nTop stunt: Bond and Jaws fight on top of a cable car.\n\nMemorable for: Bond in space;

none of Moore’s stunt doubles looking like him; a villain with an airship; Bond driving a fire engine during a car chase; a fight on the suspension struts of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThe Living Daylights (1987)\n\nBond: Timothy Dalton\n\nDirector: John Glen\n\nTheme song: The Living Daylights, performed by A-ha\n\nMain villain: Double-crossing Soviet General Georgi Koskov (Jeroen Krabbé) and arms dealer Brad Whitaker (Joe Don Baker) stir up the cold war to their own advantage.\n\nTop stunt: Bond and Bond girl Maryam d’Abo escaping baddies using a cello case as a sledge.\n\nFirst appearance: Caroline Bliss as Moneypenny.\n\nMemorable for: Being an odd (but interesting) hybrid of Moore quippery and the more hard-nosed Bond to come; an excellent pre-credit action scene set on the Rock of Gibraltar; Bond fighting blond henchman Necros while hanging out of the back of a plane.\n\nLicence to Kill (1989)\n\nBond: Timothy Dalton\n\nDirector: John Glen\n\nTheme song: Licence to Kill, performed by Gladys Knight\n\nMain villain: Drug baron Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi), who doesn’t have an evil scheme, exactly, he just annoys Bond.\n\nTop stunt: A car chase along mountainous roads, only with bloody great tankers instead of cars.\n\nMemorable for: Being one of the bleakest Bonds; Felix Leiter is mutilated by a shark; his wife killed on their wedding day; M demands Bond’s resignation when he goes off on a revenge mission; a very icky death when a man explodes in a decompression tank;

The first was Casino Royale (1967), a spy film spoof starring David Niven as the ‘original’ Bond, and Peter Sellers as one of several pretend Bonds.\n\nLike spoofs? Check out our best comedy movies here\n\nThen there was Never Say Never Again (1983), a loose remake of Thunderball, in which Connery returns to the role, with the film acknowledging his advancing years. Produced by Kevin McClory, a producer on Thunderball who had managed to maintain the screen rights to that novel after a long legal battle, the film is an interesting curio but isn’t particularly memorable beyond that."
