        "text": "Image: Twentieth Century Fox\n\nAbout This Quiz\n\nEver since cinema was invented in 1895, it's interesting to note that action-laden movies have been in the minds of early filmmakers, even during the Silent Film Era.\n\nWho could ever forget one of the very first successful narrative films, 1903's \"The Great Train Robbery,\" directed by Edward S. Porter? By the title alone, you would know that this silent film classic belonged to the action genre. Plus it's a western to boot! Prior to this film, others made very short movies that showed \"safe scenes\" or those scenes that really didn't require much effort to put together much less shoot. Imagine shooting an action film outdoors, with a huge camera that only exposes the film strip in merely seconds. And Porter was able to use editing techniques and shooting styles modern filmmakers still use today. That 12-minute film is short by today's standards, but it was a long and great feat that put this action film on the map of cinematic history.\n\nJumping back to the 1980s, do you think you can cite some of Porter's descendants here? We'll show you familiar scenes from the movies, and you guess what action flick it is! Go, go go!\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\nThis one turned into a series of action movies, and they all starred Bruce Willis. What's the title of the first one?\n\nDie Hard\n\nUnbreakable\n\n12 Monkeys\n\nSin City\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\nDirector John McTiernan was behind the very first \"Die Hard\" movie, starring Bruce Willis in the role that made him a certified action star. Alan Rickman was also unforgettable here as his nemesis, Hans Gruber. \"Shoot the glass!\" was one of his classic villainous lines.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nThis buddy cop action flick became a TV series later on. What's the title?\n\nPolice Academy\n\nTraining Day\n\nLethal Weapon\n\nSerpico\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\nAction movies have many sub-genres within its umbrella category, and the buddy movie and/or the buddy cop tandem are but two of these subs. That's where \"Lethal Weapon\" belongs, since it's both a buddy film and a good cop/bad cop tandem film as well.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\nSigourney Weaver is the definitive female action hero in this sci-fi action film. What's the title?\n\nAliens\n\nAvatar\n\nGhostbusters\n\nGalaxy Quest\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\n\"Alien\" was actually the first film to feature Sigourney Weaver in an action-packed sci-fi film, but that was released in 1979. We saw more action from her as she reprised her role in 1986's \"Aliens\" sequel. The first film was directed by Ridley Scott while the second was directed by James Cameron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrion Pictures\n\nPerhaps this futuristic action film is the one most identified with Arnold Schwarzenegger. What's the film?\n\nThe Terminator\n\nThe Running Man\n\nPredator\n\nTotal Recall\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\n\"The Terminator\" sci-fi action franchise began with the first film in 1984, starring a villainous Arnold Schwarzenegger in the titular role. But in the later sequels, Arnie became a good android, starting with 1991's \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\"\n\n5 First Blood\n\nWe saw John Rambo wreak havoc in this first film. What's the title?\n\nFirst Blood\n\nThe Expendables\n\nCobra\n\nCommando\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\nJohn Rambo is one of the most unforgettable action heroes to come out of the silver screen during the '80s, starting with the first film, \"First Blood.\" This 1982 film was followed by a sequel in 1985, then the third was released in 1988. Rambo was played by none other than Sylvester Stallone.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\nJohn Carpenter directed this one. What's the title?\n\nEscape From New York\n\nBig Trouble in Little China\n\nMortal Kombat\n\nThe Golden Child\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\nThe 1986 action film called \"Big Trouble in Little China\" actually featured a storyline set in the Chinatown area of San Francisco, California. It's also a comedy and it starred Kurt Russell and Kim Cattrall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCannon International\n\nMartial arts was a big action film element during this decade, like in this film. What's the title?\n\nEnter The Dragon\n\nKarate Kid\n\nBloodsport\n\nAmerican Ninja\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\nThe 1988 film called \"Bloodsport\" featured a fighting Jean-Claude Van Damme, and he is one of the certified Hollywood action stars to have some martial arts background training in life. He was actually active in karate competitions in his native land of Belgium before giving acting a try.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\nIndiana Jones was introduced to moviegoers in this action-adventure film. Can you guess the title?\n\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade\n\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\nSteven Spielberg's 1981 action comedy adventure film, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" was the first movie that introduced Harrison Ford in his now iconic role of Indiana Jones. Being an archaeology professor going on worldwide adventures never looked so attractive before this film came out.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nThis film series is an Australian franchise. What's the title of this 1985 film?\n\nCrocodile Dundee\n\nMad Max Beyond Thunderdome\n\nBabe\n\nThe Man From Snowy River\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\nActor Mel Gibson was the original Max in the Australian-made \"Mad Max\" movies, one of the roles that made him a globally recognized action hero. \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\" is the third film in this post-apocalyptic series, and Tina Turner co-starred with him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nSteven Seagal was one of the martial arts-practicing action heroes of that cinematic decade. Can you name this film of his?\n\nExit Wounds\n\nKill Switch\n\nFire Down Below\n\nAbove The Law\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\nSteven Seagal made a mark as an action hero who can also do martial arts moves. He showed his action prowess in films like \"Fire Down Below (1997), \"Exit Woulds\" (2001), and \"Kill Switch\" (2008). He also demonstrated this extensively in \"Above The Law\" (1988).\n\nMGM/UA Entertainment Company\n\nJames Bond films were definitely contributing to the action back in that decade. What's the title of this 007 film?\n\nA View to a Kill\n\nFrom Russia with Love\n\nGoldfinger\n\nDiamonds Are Forever\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\nThe 1985 James Bond film, \"A View to a Kill,\" featured Roger Moore in one of his James Bond duties. The iconic Grace Jones co-starred with him as May Day, a very powerful villain. '80s musical icon Duran Duran performed its catchy theme song.\n\nMGM/UA Entertainment Company\n\nGangster-related period films were also action-packed, like this one. What's the title?\n\nThe Untouchables\n\nThe Cotton Club\n\nPrizzi's Honor\n\nMarried to the Mob\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\nThe 1987 gangster film, \"The Untouchables,\" featured the story of Elliot Ness and Al Capone that happened during the 1930s. Brian De Palma directed this one, with Kevin Costner essaying the role of Ness and Robert De Niro playing Capone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrion Pictures\n\nChuck Norris delivered the kicks and punches in this war-related action film. Do you know the title?\n\nLone Wolf McQuade\n\nSidekicks\n\nGood Guys Wear Black\n\nForest Warrior\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\nThe 1983 action film, \"Lone Wolf McQuade,\" featured two action heroes who are also martial artists: Chuck Norris and David Carradine. Norris played the titular role who is a Texas Ranger.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" saga also contributed to the action of that era. What particular film of the saga is this one?\n\nThe Phantom Menace\n\nAttack of the Clones\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back\n\nRevenge of the Sith\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\nThe second film from the \"Star Wars\" saga came out in 1980. It was called \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" Unlike the first film, director Irvin Kershner helmed this one while the script was written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan. George Lucas previously handled those two jobs, but the story remains his.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nAction and comedy also mixed during that decade, like in this sequel film. Can you tell the title?\n\nSmokey and the Bandit 2\n\nBeverly Hills Cop\n\nThe Blues Brothers\n\nThe Naked Gun\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\nThe successful 1977 film, \"Smokey and the Bandit,\" had an equally successful sequel called \"Smokey and the Bandit 2\" released in 1980. It still starred Burt Reynolds in the lead, and was an action comedy hit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\nRace films were definitely action-packed as well, like this all-star cast film. What's the title?\n\nThe Cannonball Run\n\nChariots of Fire\n\nSpeed Zone\n\nSafari 3000\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\nAction comedy films can also be star-studded, like the 1981 film, \"The Cannonball Run.\" The famous faces in this film include Burt Reynolds, Farah Fawcett, Roger Moore, Dom DeLuise, Jackie Chan, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr., to name a few.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nEddie Murphy supplied the comedy and the action in this police-themed film. What's the title?\n\nComing to America\n\nBeverly Hills Cop\n\nTrading Places\n\nHarlem Nights\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\nComedian Eddie Murphy became a certified global movie star with the release of the action-comedy film, \"Beverly Hills Cop,\" in 1984. He essayed the role of Axel Foley here, and the film's instrumental soundtrack song was also called \"Axel F.\"\n\nMGM/UA Entertainment Company\n\nFantasy hero epics also packed the action in some films, like this one. What's its title?\n\nLabyrinth\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nThe Beastmaster\n\nWillow\n\nCorrect Answer\n\nWrong Answer\n\n\"The Beastmaster\" is about a boy who grew up to become a warrior, and he has the ability to communicate with animals. The 1982 fantasy action film starred famous actors of that era, such as Marc Singer and Tanya Roberts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nAll-American comic book superheroes also graced the silver screen in the '80s, like this sequel.
