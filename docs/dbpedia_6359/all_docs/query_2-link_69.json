        "text": "\"Survive or die!\" Yes that is usually what happens in a war. Lionsgate has revealed an official trailer for a fantasy action thriller film called Warchief, made by actor / filmmaker Stuart Brennan. Every film that he has made previously is a fantasy action thriller with nothing but low scores. This one is basically a Warcraft knockoff, even the title is winking at that. A group of guardians are tasked with protecting a messenger who must deliver vital information to their king. On their journey through an ancient land, they'll face a battle filled with plagues, dark magic and vile monsters. \"After another fierce and costly battle with savage Orcs, the messenger reveals her identity as a master of the dark arts and that a war is on the horizon... As their once-peaceful world comes under siege and a future kingdom ruled by the undead is foretold, Orion and his forces make one final stand for the soul of all mankind.\" This stars Rosanna Miles, Stuart Brennan, Suzanne Packer, Mark Paul Wake, and Michael Lambourne. All of this footage looks so bad, it's The Asylum version of Warcraft, if you can even give it that much credit. Stay far away from this steaming junk.\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for Stuart Brennan's movie Warchief, direct from YouTube:"
