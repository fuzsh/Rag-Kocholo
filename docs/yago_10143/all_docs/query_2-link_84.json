        "text": "Read\n\nOctober 27, 2009\n\nI like Arlene Alda's works, but have mixed results with them when reading them to children. Some like \"Here a Face, There a Face\" are tremendously popular. Others just get sort of a nod and a look like 'can we move on'. \"Hello, Good-bye\" lies somewhere's in between. The problem being that the photographs aren't necessarily the best for small fry.\n\nCold and Hot, for example, are well done. There's an evergreen covered with snow on one page and a palm tree on a beach on the opposing page. The images are attractive and convey the ideas well. But to give you an example of where things don't work out as well, let's look at Old and New.\n\nIn both cases there is architecture. An old building (Europe?) on a river versus a new abstract looking building. Now you and I and even older kids would understand why one would think the abstract-painting building was New... but two year olds don't have the cultural context to make that connection and heaven knows but most children I know aren't that interested in buildings.\n\nTalking Points:::\n\n\"Hello, Good-Bye\" is a concept book that addresses contrasts. It's a better book for slightly older children.\n\nThe pictures are typical of Alda's work. And this book, like all of hers, are certainly worth sharing with children, either at home or at school. Good LibraryFind.\n\nText consist of single words. Accelerated Reading level given as generic \"1\".\n\nPam T~\n\nmom and reviewer at BooksForKids-reviews.com\n\nMarch 4, 2013\n\nages 1-5. The thing I appreciated the most out of this opposites book is that the images were photographs and not illustrations. Some children might benefit from seeing real life examples rather than drawings. The represented opposites seemed relevant, and the images paired with the words fit well. The white space around each word made identification of the words easy as well. A great book to build vocabulary and a conversation starter for children and their caregivers. I thought it was well done."
