        "text": "Arlene Weiss of the Bronx seemed to have all the tickets: She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Hunter College, won a Fulbright scholarship so she could study music in Europe, and then joined the Houston Symphony as assistant first clarinetist under the direction of Leopold Stokowski.\n\nAnd then, in 1957, she gave up her promising musical career to marry a struggling young actor named Alan Alda, who is two years younger than she and, at 6 feet 2 inches, a full foot taller.\n\nThey met at a Manhattan party during which a rum cake accidentally toppled off the top of the refrigerator. Rather than see the hostess suffer hurt feelings, Arlene Weiss and her new friend, Mr. Alda, sat down and ate the cake off the floor with spoons.\n\n''We were the only two people who did it,'' she recalled with a smile the other day, ''and I think it cemented our friendship for life. That sort of playfulness has stood us in good stead for 24 years.''\n\nToday Arlene Weiss is Arlene Alda, and her long-run marriage to the millionaire superstar of films and television's ''M*A*S*H'' is a legend in a business where mates are traded in almost as often as Mercedeses. Some people might assume that the marriage's success was due to Mrs. Alda's giving up her music career and adopting what she calls a ''behind the scenes'' role of traditional wife and mother to the Aldas' three daughters, Eve, 22 years old, Elizabeth, 20, and Beatrice, 19.\n\nThat explanation would sound logical if it weren't that in the last few years Mr. Alda has evolved into one of the country's best-known male feminists and an outspoken supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment. In 1976, President Ford appointed him to the International Women's Year Commission. His face was recently on the cover of Ms. magazine, and the proceeds from the premiere of his new film, ''The Four Seasons,'' went to a Ms.-sponsored fund for investigative reporting.
