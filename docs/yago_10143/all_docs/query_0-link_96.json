He has starred in, written and directed many films, and was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in The Aviator.

He is the author of the play, “Radiance: The Passion of Marie Curie” and “Dear Albert,” a reading for the stage of Einstein’s letters. He is a member of the Board of the World Science Festival, which has drawn more than 2.9 million visitors since its 2008 inception. He is a Visiting Professor at Stony Brook University’s Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science, which has trained over 15,000 scientists and doctors around the world.\n\nHis latest book is “If I Understood You Would I Have This Look on My Face? My Adventures in the Art and Science of Relating and Communicating.”\n\nHe hosts several podcasts: Clear+Vivid with Alan Alda, Science Clear+Vivid, and Soldiers of Science (from Audible Originals – audible.com)"
