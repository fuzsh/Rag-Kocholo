I spent all my summers on Broadway. Dad would be in one play and Alan would be in another. I used to hang out with the lighting guys.\" He found that being an Alda had its professional ups and downs. \"People figure you know what you're doing because you grew up around acting. Other people think you got the part because of your name.\"[8]\n\nAntony Alda finished his high school studies at Notre Dame International in Rome and completed his academic career studying musical composition at The Juilliard School in New York City.[9] Alda was married twice, first in 1975 to Leslie Clark at Saint Thomas Episcopal Church in New York City at Fifth Avenue.[10] Their reception was held at the old Biltmore Hotel.
