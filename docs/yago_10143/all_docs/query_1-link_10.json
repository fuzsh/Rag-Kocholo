        "text": "If there's anything this series loves, it's the perfect meet-cute, and Alan Alda and his wife Arlene have just offered it.\n\nAlda has had a long and varied career as an actor, best known for his starring role as Hawkeye Pierce in beloved US army comedy, M.A.S.H., as well as in The West Wing, and Woody Allen's critically acclaimed comedy-thriller, Manhatten Murder Mystery.\n\nBut not much is known about his 65-year marriage to his true love, Arlene.\n\nRELATED: Love Stories: Why Sophia Loren gave up her Hollywood affair with Cary Grant\n\nAt least, not until now.\n\nIn the most modern of ways, the world has been introduced to the pair's sweet meeting story through Twitter, after user @sonyashea3 posted a screenshot from Alan's Wikipedia page.\n\nThe page shared a cute anecdote of how two met while both studying in New York.\n\nLove at first rum cake\n\nStudying English at Fordham University in the Bronx, Alan attended a dinner party one night where he met Arlene â€” then Arlene Weiss.\n\nArlene was studying music at New York City's Hunter College nearby, and had attended the dinner through a mutual friend.\n\nRELATED: Love Stories: The tragic end to Sir David Attenborough's 47-year marriage\n\nBut what brought the pair together was a moment of adorable spontaneity. After a night of fun and flair, when the host's rum cake fell on the floor, the two were the only guests who didn't hesitate to eat it.\n\nAnd what's more, Alda himself has verified the story, tweeting that he and his love were \"inseparable after that.\"\n\nWhile it might've been the rum cake that brought them together, Alda confirmed that there was something else that drew him to Arlene.\n\n\"I was captivated by her even earlier in the meal when I heard her at the end of the table laughing at my jokes.\n\n\"She had me at Ha,\" he tweeted.\n\nAfter the fateful meeting, the smitten pair decided to marry only a year later, on March 15, 1957.\n\nAnd then, as often does, life unfolded.\n\nStruggling actor weds struggling musician\n\nThe young lovebirds locked eyes well before either of their careers had taken off, making their tale a classic love story of 'struggling-actor meets struggling musician'.\n\nAt the time, Arlene was pursuing her career as a musician, playing the clarinet for the Houston Symphony Orchestra under conductor Leopold Stokowski.\n\nIt wasn't until 1958 that Alan got his first big break on-screen, in a guest-starring role as Carlyle Thompson III on The Phil Silvers Show.\n\nAlan's career soon took him to the stage. He performed in various stagehouse plays, including The Owl and the Pussycat in 1964-1965, and then on Broadway, in the 1966 production of The Apple Tree, alongside Barbara Harris.\n\nHis performance saw him nominated for his first Tony Award, for Best Actor in a Musical.\n\nAt the same time, Arlene started to dabble with photography, and after studying with renowned New York photographers Lou Bernstein and Morton Shapiro, she made the daring career switch.\n\nAs the years went by, Arlene exhibited several major one-person shows for Nikon House and the Mark Humphrey Gallery in New York.\n\nRELATED: The most gorgeous love stories in the British Royal Family\n\nBy 1972, M.A.S.H came knocking at Alan's door, and the pair had a thriving family to take care of. With three daughters, Eve, Elizabeth and Beatrice to raise, Alan began commuting back-and-forth from Los Angeles to New Jersey over the weekends, for the show's 11-year run.\n\nHis time on M.A.S.H saw him nominated for 21 Emmy Awards, winning five.\n\nWhile taking care of their children, and supporting Alan's career, Arlene went freelance, with photographs appearing in The Saturday Evening Post, Vogue, People Magazine and Life Magazine.\n\nBut when Arlene decided to invest her efforts into children's books, for example, Alan was her first point of call.\n\nFrom the 1990s, she has authored 15 children's books, and upon Alan's idea, provides her own photography as illustrations in many of her works.\n\nRELATED: Love Stories: How Elvis helped Johnny Cash and June Carter fall in love\n\nAt a similar time, Alan's acting took him to greater heights, seeing him star in Hollywood hits including The Seduction of Joe Tynan alongside Meryl Streep, and Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanours.\n\nWith the arrival of eight grandchildren over the years, and various other trips and falls in life, Alan and Arlene have cherished their luck and tight bond.\n\nWhile the two maintain busy careers, even well into their 80s, at 65 years married it seems they are just as loved-up as they were that night they ate spoon fulls of rum cake off a friend's kitchen floor.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, sign up here to receive our top stories straight to your inbox"
