        "text": "Take time to enjoy the journey at these awe-inspiring stations\n\nBeautiful train stations are arguably a city’s most treasured architectural landmark. With nonstop flights going seemingly everywhere, people tend to prefer the sky over the rail. That said, there’s something nostalgic—and even glamorous—about boarding a train that simply cannot be replicated in any other form of transportation—especially planes, which are getting more modern by the year. After all, trains are often credited with completely transforming the United States in nearly every regard (socially, politically, and economically) during the most financially lucrative period, the Gilded Age.\n\nAnd with the popularity of trains on the rise throughout the latter half of the glittering 19th century, some of the stations are unsurprisingly beautiful works of architectural magic. From the celestial-inspired frescoes on the towering ceilings to the glossy red brick floors, the most eye-catching beautiful train stations are proof of the economic boom such transportation hubs introduced.\n\nWhether it’s on your daily commute or on daring adventures across the globe, you’d be amazed to find that some of the world’s most stunning architecture can be found in train stations. From the spectacular Gothic Revival look of London’s St. Pancras International to the Art Deco and Spanish Colonial styles of John and Donald Parkinson’s Union Station in Los Angeles, the dramatic designs featured in these transportation hubs make catching a train an awe-inspiring experience. Next time you find yourself booking a worldly adventure, make sure to plan a stop at any one of these renowned stations."
