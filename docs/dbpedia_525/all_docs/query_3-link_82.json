        "text": "See details about Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad fares, how and where to buy tickets, what our refund policies are, and more.\n\nAbout railroad fares\n\nPeak fares are charged during weekday rush hours on trains scheduled to arrive in NYC terminals between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. or depart NYC terminals between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. On Metro-North, peak fares also apply to weekday trains that leaves Grand Central between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m.\n\nOff-peak fares are charged all other times on weekdays, all day Saturday and Sunday, and on holidays.\n\nExact fares depend on your trip. The easiest way to see what your trip will cost is by using our schedules or the TrainTime app.\n\nIf you prefer to not use an app, see our fare tables.\n\nMost ticket types are the same on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad, but there are some exceptions.\n\nEach railroad station is assigned a fare zone. Tickets are valid to any station in the listed zone.\n\nFor example, Penn Station to Hicksville can be used for Atlantic Terminal to Massapequa Park.\n\nSave money with CityTicket and Combo Ticket.\n\nIf you're traveling within New York City on the LIRR or Metro-North, you can get a CityTicket for $5 during off-peak hours or $7 during peak hours.\n\nIf you're transferring between the LIRR and Metro-North, you can start a trip on one railroad and transfer to the other railroad at Grand Central for a flat $8 fee with Combo Ticket.\n\nThe easiest way to buy tickets is with the TrainTime app on your phone.\n\nFare tables\n\nMore options for buying tickets\n\nRailroad fare types\n\nOne-way and round-trip tickets\n\nThese are valid for 60 days, including the date of sale. Off-peak tickets are subject to an additional surcharge, payable to the conductor, if used on a peak train.\n\nFor travel outside Manhattan on Metro-North, and outside Zones 1/3 on the LIRR, the fare is the same on all trains. On Metro-North, look for \"intermediate\" tickets. On the LIRR, look for peak tickets.\n\nYou do not have to pay more or buy two tickets if you have to make transfers in the same direction to complete your trip.\n\nOn the LIRR, if you have to make a transfer that involves a change of direction (for instance, traveling from Mineola to Valley Stream via Jamaica), look for a ticket \"via\" your transfer point when you buy.\n\nOn Metro-North, if you make a transfer that involves a change of direction at Fordham or Harlem-125th St, you will need to buy two tickets. Travel to/from Yankee Stadium and Mets-Willets Point on game days is exempt from these rules. See the section below.\n\nRound-trip: Any combination of two one-way tickets. These are priced according to the fares you select (peak, off-peak, etc.).\n\nNote for Metro-North riders:\n\nOne-way and round-trip tickets on the Harlem and Hudson lines are not accepted on the New Haven Line and vice versa.\n\nWeekly, monthly, and 10-Trip tickets\n\nMonthly: Good for unlimited rides during the calendar month indicated on the ticket. This is the most cost-effective ticket if you’re commuting 3 or more days a week.\n\nMonthly tickets are non-transferable; the first person to use this ticket is the only person who can use it. Available for purchase starting the 25th of the prior month.\n\nWeekly: Good for unlimited rides for a calendar week (Saturday through Friday).\n\nWeekly tickets go on sale at ticket offices and ticket machines beginning Wednesday for the following week.

These are not valid on inbound morning peak trains. These can be used by more than one person, even when you are traveling together, if they are all eligible for this special fare and present the required identification.\n\n10-Trip intermediate (Metro-North only): Good for 10 trips between two stations outside of Manhattan on the same line.\n\nNotes for Metro-North riders:\n\nMonthly and weekly tickets to/from Manhattan on the New Haven Line are accepted on the Harlem and Hudson lines where the value of the Harlem/Hudson monthly/weekly ticket is the same or less.\n\n10-Trip tickets on the Harlem and Hudson lines are not accepted on the New Haven Line and vice versa.\n\nCityTicket\n\nRiders pay $5 for travel within New York City during all off-peak hours and $7 during peak hours.
