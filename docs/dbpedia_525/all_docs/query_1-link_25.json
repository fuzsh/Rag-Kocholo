        "text": "Now\n\nAnd then:\n\nI have finally got down to posting a photo of my layout 'Newhaven Harbour'. Let me say straight away that it bears little resemblance to the real thing! What I have done though, is build a layout which operates roughly like the real thing (can't fit in the boat trains!) and with stock that I can remember seeing in the early to mid 70's. This second photo shows the layout at Carmarthen show in September 2009.\n\nThe station building is based on that at Seaford - just up the line. The signal box is the one at Newhaven Harbour (the real one is still in use today). There is also a 'raft' type sub station just out of shot in the left distance. That is modelled on the one at Newhaven Town station.\n\nAt the time modelled, Newhaven still saw a little goods traffic and some engineers trains: There were some banana trains running from Fyffes depot on the East Quay of the harbour and there were numerous 'Grampus', 'Lamprey' and similar wagons delivering spoil to the 'Beach Sidings'. There is no chance of a layout with the complete harbour-side rail network - it would need a space roughly 30' x 60'!\n\nI have had to compress all this into the space that I had in the loft area of my workshop - minus one end board which is only used at exhibitions. In all, the 'L' shaped result is 16' x 11' (including the traverser).\n\nThis is the first layout that I have built since 'returning' to the hobby in the winter of 2005. At that time I had nothing in the way of models except for a 'Mermaid', a 'Dogfish' and a 'Shark' - all not really correct for the area I hoped to model!\n\nLuckily and coincidentally, Hornby produced their 08 model in 2005. Now there was definitely one of those in use at Newhaven, so things got off to a good start. We Southern Region fans have been (at last!) well served by the trade these last few years: The Heljan Class 33, Hornby's upgrade of the Class 73 not to mention all the kits for wagons and EMUs. That's a DC Kits 2 HAP at platfrom one by the way.\n\nI've also just got hold of the Bachmann 4 CEP - but that's another story!\n\nAnyway, that's all for now. The second photo was taken by Martin Dalling and is reproduced by permission.\n\nDear Pernickety all of you!\n\nThe stations in the Newhaven area did not receive the new BR corporate style signs until the summer of ' 76. I know this because I worked across the road from Newhaven Harbour at that time and saw the progress every day. This was also the case at Newhaven Town station. I was lucky enough to buy a totem sign direct from BR of 'Newhaven Town' before the signage was sent to 'Collector's Corner' at Euston station (??5.00 donation to the Railwaymens' Orphans' Fund!). The paintwork was also changed at this time - so there!\n\nWith regard to the shade of green on the 2 BIL, it said 'Late EMU Green' on the Precision Paints' tin. If you look on the internet, particularly on the Southern 'E' Group website I believe, there are plenty of colour photos of units in this shade. I used to travel on 2 BILs in the late 60's and it's pretty much the green I can remember. Some 2 BILs ran until withdrawal in 1970-71 in green, I admit most had full yellow ends by then but that was not the case with all of them. Other units were given the all-over blue with full yellow end livery. However, Unit 2034 is documented as being one of the last of nine 2 BILs to remain in service and is correct for the Kirk kit, so that's as close as I can get to authenticity at the moment!\n\nA fine layout, with all sorts of real LBSCR cues - well done! Newhaven boat trains weren't always very long - I'm sure I recall the boat being a 4-car and attaching to something at Lewes or Haywards Heath. I think a Mr Clasby was SM in the early '70s - he'd always ring Control to confirm departure of the up boat train.\n\nYou're doing fine, and CEP and VEP models won't hurt, either!\n\nBonjour Old dudders! I've heard about you from Old lugger.\n\nI think that if you remember Newhaven boat trains as short as that it must have been towards the end of the service when the trade had declined due to the introdution of 'roll-on roll-off' car ferries at the port. From what I can remember of the boat trains, they were twelve cars long. I thought that 2 x 4 CIGs and 1 x 4 BIG were used ('IG' being the old LB&SCR code for the London- Brighton route). I shall run my 4 CEP on the layout anyway as this sort of unit was used for the semi-fast trains in the area.\n\nI know that for about a year c.1970-71 the boat train was hauled by a Class 73 with Mk.1 carriage stock. This was a stop-gap measure after the withdrawal of the Bulleid-Raworth electric locos which ran the boat trains pretty much continuously from 1949-69.\n\nThe Newhaven 'Marine' station is still standing and in use today, running one train at some odd hour under the Paliamentry Act. The existing (re-built?) platform could hold a 12-car train with ease - that's why I didn't model the station area as it should be.\n\nBonjour Old dudders! I've heard about you from Old lugger.\n\nI know that for about a year c.1970-71 the boat train was hauled by a Class 73 with Mk.1 carriage stock. This was a stop-gap measure after the withdrawal of the Bulleid-Raworth electric locos which ran the boat trains pretty much continuously from 1949-69.\n\nI'm being talked about - which is always worrying!\n\nI worked in the Control at Redhill/Croydon from 1968-73, but was never trusted with Area 3, which I think looked after Newhaven. Area 4, which ran London Bridge to Coulsdon North and Warnham, was quite enough for me! I used to hear the boat train being talked about on occasions, and Geoff Clasby always seemed to ring the DCC (shift leader) to report the boat train away - was it at 1718, perhaps? As for the electric locos, I'd seen those a decade before when numbersnatching at Earlswood. Even in their last days, 20 years after Nationalisation and renumbering, it was not uncommon for the Norwood Yard staff, when giving us a tally for a departing freight train, to refer to 20001 as CC1!\n\nI'm afraid colour is a nightmare. Quite apart from the accuracy of our cameras, be they film or digital, and our PC monitors, memory is simply unreliable. If you are happy with the 2-BIL colour - and it happens to look ok to me - then that's that. Elsewhere, earnest folk are concerned about the shade of malachite Hornby are now using - with reason. Except when I looked in the HMRS Livery Register for LSWR & Southern I could see Hornby's point, too....."
