        "text": "Amtrak and LIRR have a new home in New York City. A visionary project – a generation in the making – championed by Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, Moynihan Train Hall is the city’s newest grand civic icon. The $1.6 billion project transforms the 100+ year-old James A. Farley Post Office Building into a modern, world-class transit hub – an idea first proposed by the late United States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan more than a quarter-century ago.\n\nThe Farley Building was one of the first buildings landmarked under preservation laws created in wake of the destruction of its sister structure, the original Penn Station. New exterior features include street and sidewalk improvements, restoration of the historic building moats, and security enhancements.\n\nImproving Penn Station – the busiest transit facility in the Western Hemisphere, and linchpin of the transportation network of New York and the Northeast – has long been considered one of the state’s and the nation’s most critical infrastructure priorities."
