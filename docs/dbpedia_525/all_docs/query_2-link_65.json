It was located on the middle pier at Granton Harbour. From this pier operated, after 1849, the world's first train ferry (for the ferry services see Granton Pier).\n\nThe station had a single platform on the west side of the rounding loop, harbour lines and slip lines. The station building was on the long, rather poor, largely wooden building with a canopy (an addition to the original building) standing on the wooden platform. Lines ran onto Granton Pier from which a train ferry operated to Burntisland Albert Pier in Fife. The linkspan to the ferry and the ferries themselves were designed by Thomas Bouch. Trains themselves were loaded onto the specially built and equipped boats.\n\nGranton Shed, a single road building, was to the south of the station at the base of the pier (its south end).\n\nAfter 1890, when the Forth Bridge opened, train ferries no longer ran to Burntisland Albert Pier. But the passenger ferry service continued, with fewer steamers.\n\nThe station closed in 1925 and the signal box closed in 1933 (this was to the south of the station, on the north side of the junction where a connection over Harbour Road was made with the Granton Branch (Caledonian Railway).\n\nSome railway lines remain in place on the pier. Nothing remains of the passenger station. The slip still exists. The site of the station is now the Royal Forth Yacht Club .\n\nTags\n\nStation terminus pier\n\nExternal links\n\nCanmore site record\n\nNLS Collection OS map of 1892-1914\n\nNLS Collection OS map of 1944-67\n\n05/10/2023"
