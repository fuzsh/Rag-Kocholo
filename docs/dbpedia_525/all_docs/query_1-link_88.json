        "text": "The Cape Cod Central Railroad takes guests past marshes, cranberry bogs, dunes, and other places only accessible by rail, but which ride to choose? Perhaps you can enjoy a daytime ride with narrated tales of the history of the canal and how cranberries are harvested? Or maybe a relaxing weekday lunch or Sunday brunch is more your style? Maybe a sunset dinner train is just the ticket? We say, why choose? Come explore all the Cape Cod Central Railroad has to offer. Cape Train is conveniently located at the Buzzards Bay and Hyannis train stations in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, along the coast of New England. We are located about 40 minutes south of Plymouth and an hour from Provincetown. We run rain or shine. All aboard!\n\nCape Cod Central Railroad is part of Cape Rail, Inc., which also includes the Massachusetts Coastal Railroad “Mass Coastal.” Cape Rail covers approximately 100 miles of track between the two railroads. Mass Coastal is a freight line, and the Cape Cod Central is a heritage, passenger railroad that operates primarily on 27 miles of former New Haven Railroad tracks on Cape Cod."
