The large and colourful mural for Newhaven Harbour railway station was designed and produced by thirteen members of the Sussex Community Development Association (SCDA), a charity that aims to support projects for the most vulnerable in the community.

The young group, aged between 11-17 years old, were part of the association’s youth clubs and Young People's Forum. The mural they made shows the landmarks in the town such as Newhaven Fort.

Shannon Payne, SCDA youth team lead, said: “After a year of isolation and distance, this mural project provided local young people with a collaborative outlet to create something for their community to enjoy now and for years to come.

“It's a great way for young people to connect with the wider community.”

Thameslink’s parent company Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) supplied the funding for the mural through their station improvement programme.

Chris Fowler, GTR's customer services director for Southern, said: “We're improving stations for passengers, and making them more valuable assets for the local communities they serve.
