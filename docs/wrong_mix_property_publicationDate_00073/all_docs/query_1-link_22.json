        "text": "This revolution was televised. When the six members of Monty Python embarked on their unique collaboration 30 years ago, they were reacting against what they saw as the staid, predictable formats of other television comedy programs. What they brought to their audience was writing that was both highly intelligent and silly. The series Monty Python's Flying Circus—which premiered in Britain in 1969 and five years later in the United States—combined visual humor with a quirky style, and featured boisterous performances that seemed to celebrate the group's creative freedom.\n\nBut what made the show extraordinary from the very beginning was its total lack of predictability, its reveling in a stream-of-consciousness display of nonsense, satire, sex, and violence. The very flow of action and ideas was the most potent source of humor on Monty Python. It was not about jokes; it was really about a state of mind. Three decades after the group's premiere, even after the routines have been memorized, the shows, films, books, and recordings remain funny. Through their uncompromising approach to comedy in various media the Pythons left a mark on popular culture that continues to be felt.\n\nThe group consisted of five Englishmen—Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin—and one American, Terry Gilliam:\n\n• Chapman, after struggling for much of his adult life with alcoholism, died in 1989 of throat cancer. Born in Leicester—his father was a policeman—Chapman attended Cambridge and after graduation continued to study medicine before fully committing to a career in comedy. He and his longtime male companion had an adopted son who died in 1992. As Monty Python's de facto straight man, Chapman played King Arthur in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Brian in Monty Python's Life of Brian, and, on television, a recurring army colonel who would interrupt proceedings and declare them \"too silly.\"\n\n• Cleese escaped a projected career in law when he accepted a job writing jokes for the BBC. The son of an insurance salesman (who had changed the family's surname from Cheese), Cleese was born in Weston-super-Mare and attended Cambridge with Chapman. Apart from Monty Python he has written and starred in the television series Fawlty Towers, the film A Fish Called Wanda, and its sequel, Fierce Creatures. He and his third wife divide their time between London and Santa Barbara; he has two daughters from his earlier marriages. His best-known Monty Python roles include the Minister of Silly Walks and the man trying unsuccessfully to return a dead parrot to a pet store.\n\n• Gilliam was born in Minnesota and raised in Los Angeles. His early careers as a magazine illustrator (he contributed to Mad co-founder Harvey Kurtzman's short-lived Help!) and an ad-agency copywriter in New York City somehow pointed him toward creating the surreal animated sequences that became a group signature. Away from Monty Python he has had an extremely successful career as a film director (Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Fisher King, Twelve Monkeys, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas). He lives in London with his wife, a former makeup artist on the Monty Python television shows. They have two daughters and a son.\n\n• Idle professes to shun acting for writing—his latest novel is The Road to Mars—and yet has performed in a number of non-Monty Python projects (his films include Nuns on the Run and Casper); he also wrote, co-directed, and co-starred in All You Need Is Cash, a mock documentary about a Beatles-esque rock group (the Rutles). Idle was raised by his widowed mother in South Shields, County Durham. At Cambridge, he was the president of Footlights, the student revue for which Cleese and Chapman also wrote and performed. Idle has a son and a daughter; he and his second wife live in Los Angeles. His Monty Python roles include the insinuating \"nudge, nudge, say no more\" chap; he was arguably the most fetching Python in drag.\n\n• Jones is a noted history buff who has written on Chaucer and hosted a number of documentaries, including one on the Crusades. He directed Life of Brian and Monty Python's the Meaning of Life; apart from Monty Python he has directed the films Erik the Viking and The Wind in the Willows and written several children's books. The son of a bank clerk, he was born in North Wales and attended Oxford University. He and his wife, a biochemist, live in London and have a son and a daughter. Jones regularly appeared nude (playing the organ) in the opening credits of the Monty Python television series; he also played the obscenely fat, vomit-spewing Mr. Creosote in The Meaning of Life.\n\n• Palin was born in Sheffield, where his father worked for a steel firm. As a teenager, Palin met and fell in love with the woman he would eventually marry (they have two sons and a daughter and currently live in London). Like Jones, Palin attended Oxford, where the two first wrote and performed together. Since Python, Palin has starred in films such as Brazil and A Fish Called Wanda and has hosted three travel series for the BBC. On Monty Python he played the cheese-shop owner who denies he has no cheese to sell and the leader of the dread Spanish Inquisition.\n\nLeading up to their first collaboration as Monty Python in 1969, the five British members of the group, already known to each other from their college revues, were writing separately or in teams for several radio and TV shows at the BBC and at independent television (TTV) companies—including David Frost's influential The Frost Report, to which all five future Pythons contributed and in which Cleese starred. During these years the group members crossed paths with Gilliam, who joined them in British television. The six soon recognized similar tastes or aesthetics about how comedy should be written—all were fans of radio's The Goon Show and of the Peter Cook-Dudley Moore collaboration Beyond the Fringe. At the BBC's behest and through their own affinity, the group came together as Monty Python. All were still in their 20s.\n\nJOHN CLEESE: The worst problem we had with the whole show was finding a good title for it. We had the first show written and we didn't know what to call it, and we had a whole lot of fanciful titles: A Horse, a Spoon and a Basin, which I really liked; Bunn Wackett Buzzard Stubble and Boot; Owl Stretching Time; The Toad Elevating Moment. In fact the BBC had started to call it The Flying Circus. They'd started writing it into their schedules, in ink, so they said, \"Well, could you call it The Flying Circus? Because otherwise we'd have to write out new schedules.\"\n\nThen we couldn't decide who. We thought it might be Gwen Dibley's Flying Circus, because she was a name Michael had pulled out of a newspaper, and then somehow we went off Gwen Dibley, I don't know why—she could be famous now, you know? But somebody came up with Monty Python and we all fell about, and I can't explain why. We just thought it was funny that night.\n\nTERRY JONES: The way we went and did the shows is, first of all we'd meet and talk about ideas. And then we'd all go off for like two weeks and each write individually or in our pairs. So at the end of two weeks we'd all meet together, quite often downstairs in my front room or dining room, and we'd read out the stuff. That was the best time of Python, the most exciting time, when you knew you were going to hear new stuff and they were going to make you laugh.\n\nTERRY GILLIAM: You had to jockey for position about when and where a sketch was going to be read out, which time of the day; if it came in too early it was going to bomb. And you knew that if Mike and Terry or John and Graham had something they wanted to do they wouldn't laugh as much [at the others']. And I was in a funny position, because I was kind of the apolitical laugh; I was the one guy who had nothing at stake because my stuff [the animation] was outside of theirs.\n\nJOHN CLEESE: I was the one who was having to write with Graham. Now I thought early on, before Graham's drinking was any sort of a problem, it would be much more fun if we occasionally broke up into different writing groups; we could keep the material more varied. To some extent there was a Chapman-Cleese type of sketch (which was usually somebody going into an office of some kind and probably getting into an argument in which there would be quite a lot of thesaurus-type words), whereas Mike and Terry [Jones] would nearly always start things where some camera would pan over Scottish or Icelandic or Dartmoor countryside and afterwards would get into some sort of tale. And Eric's was largely one man sitting at a desk talking to the camera and getting completely caught up, as they say, disappearing up his own ass.\n\nTERRY GILLIAM: John and Graham wrote contained pieces; they tended to be very confrontational pieces—bam bam bam! Eric wrote his tight things; wordplay was his specialty, I suppose. Mike and Terry tended to be more conceptual in the way they were approaching things, and I fit more in that group with what I was doing.\n\nYou've got John and Graham as the center of one half of the brain, and you've got Mike and Terry as the center of the other half, and Eric's the individual on that side, and I'm the individual on this side. It's like us on one side who thought in a freer way and those on the other who thought in this more aggressive, defensive way of writing sketches; they're much more the control freaks.\n\nMICHAEL PALIN: Eric was always a slightly cheeky chap. I don't think his characters were ever very complex, but they were really superbly performed. The man who talked in anagrams and all that: \"Staht sit sepreicly.\" Well, I can't imagine any of us doing that in quite that way. And also in group discussion he was very good. Not being part of the two writing groups, Eric was able to look at our material in a slightly more detached way and make very good comments about what worked and what didn't work, which was effective and important. I suppose he was more on our side, as it were, if you wanted to take sides up—more like Terry and myself than with John and Graham.\n\nERIC IDLE: When we got to the States we were amazed to find they assumed we wrote it out of our minds on drugs—as if anyone could successfully write stoned. Actually we always worked office hours: nine to five with a break for lunch. We were serious about our work, but we laughed like fuck.\n\nTERRY JONES: I suppose the great thing was we all liked each other's work, so we all had respect for what the others did. So if they thought [a sketch] wasn't funny, you'd think, Phew, that was a bit of luck, we might have tried to do that. I mean, occasionally there was something you really thought was funny and you thought, They haven't got it. I suppose the best example of that was a late one from The Meaning of Life, the \"Mr. Creosote\" sketch, the fat man in the restaurant, which was something I'd written. Mike and I both thought it was our funniest piece [a restaurant patron weighing more than all the Pythons put together proceeds to spew vomit throughout the establishment, consume everything on the menu, and then—upon digesting a dainty after-dinner mint—explode]. Mike hit them with it first thing after lunch, and nobody thought it was funny, it got thrown out. And then about a month later, John rang up and said, \"Hello, this is something that will bring a little smile to your face: I've just been looking at the 'Mr. Creosote' sketch; I think it could be quite funny.\" What John had realized I think was that the funniest part there was the waiter [who accommodates his disgusting but wealthy customer with unctuous doting]. And he and Graham came up with the idea of the \"wafer-thin mint.\" So that got rescued.\n\nTERRY GILLIAM: [In story meetings] I always had the most difficulty because I could never explain what I was doing [with my animation]; whenever I did, there would be these blank faces. I was in maybe the best position because I had the most freedom. The others had to submit all their material to the group and get rejected or included or changed; mine, because I couldn't explain it and because we were always revising at the last moment, was pretty much never touched.\n\nTERRY JONES: As we wrote on, we started parodying each other. Mike and I wrote a parody of one of John and Graham's sketches. Because of things like the \"Dead Parrot\" sketch, which is basically straight out of the thesaurus [Cleese's frustrated character runs through a number of synonyms for \"dead\" trying to persuade the shopkeeper the bird has perished], we wrote a parody of it, an \"Astrology\" sketch (\" ... the zodiacal signs, the horoscopic fates, the astrological portents, the omens, the genethliac prognostications ... \"). Mike read this out and everybody laughed and it went in, and we were just amazed because we'd written it as a joke, really. We thought they'd go, \"Oh, come on! Get away! Making fun of our writing?\" But we were quite surprised that it actually got into the show! They all thought it was funny, so we didn't say, \"Actually it was just a parody of one of yours.\" I kept a bit quiet, and it got into the Yes Pile.\n\nERIC IDLE: Casting always came last in everything. It was usually fairly easy, like the John parts were obvious—people who shouted or were cruel to defenseless people or animals. Mike and I were usually the ones who could play each other's parts. Usually people spoke up if they felt they were a bit light in a show; they might sulk until someone noticed, but it was swings and roundabouts, really. Also, we had no girls to sulk or feel left out (i.e., Saturday Night Live), and we would happily grab most of the girls' parts for ourselves. Serve 'em right, too. Get their own bloody shows!\n\nMICHAEL PALIN: Personally, I always enjoyed when you were able to flesh the character out a bit, even within a sketch. I mean, I loved playing the man in the \"Dead Parrot\" sketch or the \"Cheese Shop\" because you can give them some sort of character—they're not just somebody saying, \"No, we haven't got this,\" \"No, we haven't got that.\" It isn't just the words, it's the evasiveness and the degree of evasiveness, and why a man should be that evasive, and what's going through his mind [that] appeals to me. I really enjoyed getting to grips with characters like that, even within a fairly short sketch....\n\nI'd like to think we naturally were rooting for every sketch [rather than] anyone wanting their sketches to go down better, although there probably was a little bit of that, but basically you just wanted the show to have laughs all the way through.\n\nThe members of Monty Python proved that— in their case at least—six strong personalities were capable of subsuming themselves to a single comic entity. This is not to suggest, however, that tension and temperament did not intrude.\n\nERIC IDLE: It seems to me since comedians seek control we were a group of potential controllers. Obviously some are more manipulative than others, or cleverer at getting their own way. Cleese is the most canny, but everyone had their ways. Mike would charm himself into things. Terry J. would simply not listen to anyone else.\n\nJOHN CLEESE: Michael's great aim in life is to be affable. And this makes him enormously pleasant and enormously good company, but infuriating if he doesn't want to do something, or if he disagrees with something, because it's almost impossible for him to say so at the time. But we were all cowards; we all avoid confrontations about anything that wasn't to do with the material. Those kinds of things never got spoken about; we were very English in a sense that any kind of direct confrontation about anything emotional was impossible.\n\nMICHAEL PALIN: I think more than anybody Terry Jones kept the group together and kept it going forward, because Terry's probably got more energy, sheer mental energy. If he commits to an idea, Terry will really follow it through. And right from the very first discussions we had about Python, Terry was always positive about what the group could do and what we could achieve. I think he was the one who worked most to get this new form, this new shape together. He was always hurrying the director in editing sessions and all that. When the television series was coming to an end, he was the one who was most keen to try and get a film together.\n\nJOHN CLEESE: One or two people in the BBC definitely saw me as the mover of the group. The reality was that Terry Jones and I were probably the strongest personalities. The negative side of that is, we were probably the two who argued the most, because we cared terribly about the material. You could say we were young and naïve; writers are like this when they start. The funny thing was, we never argued about the acting. No one ever got into a snit because they hadn't got some role; all the arguments were about the material, and they would sometimes get quite intense and absurdly silly. I remember in one sketch we had a kind of taxidermized animal hanging from the ceiling with four lightbulbs in its feet; we got into quite an acrimonious debate about whether it should be a sheep or a goat. And in retrospect it's hilarious that we could get cross with each other about whether it should be a sheep or a goat! But we cared so much about the material that we fought quite a lot.\n\nTERRY GILLIAM: John's a hard one. John loves manipulating controlling; he's only comfortable when he's doing that. When he lets go of control and just starts hanging out, he can only do it for a short while and then the panic sets in, it really sets in. I mean, after we did Holy Grail we were in Amsterdam all together promoting it, and we went on a pub crawl one night, and we were having a great time, all of us. And we were getting drunk and speaking openly, all the things that a group can never [otherwise do], and it really was getting funny, and we were saying a lot of things that needed to be said in a really jolly, drunken way. And at a certain point John just had to pull back from it; he was relaxing, he was letting down his guard too much, and he went back off wherever he went. It was really weird. And it was a pity because we were having a good time, and John was having a good time, and he couldn't allow himself to not try to be in control.\n\nI think his attempt to try and control things gave a sense there was always something one could go against—his need to control [versus] our need to not be controlled, and that's such an interesting dynamic. [But] I don't know if that's exactly the best use of everybody in the group!\n\nMICHAEL PALIN: John and Graham took some pleasure in writing something which shocked an audience. I think this came from within, but John never seemed to be totally happy or centered—there was always something which John was having to cope with. And that desire to shock, I think, came from the way Graham was, too. Graham was a genuine outsider, a very straitlaced man who was homosexual and an alcoholic at that time and therefore found himself constantly in conflict with people, and so he would fight back. And the two of them would put together things like the \"Undertaker\" sketch purely because they knew it was outrageous [Cleese goes to a mortuary following his mum's death; Chapman, the undertaker, eventually suggests they eat her remains], and yet they did it in a way none of the other Pythons would have done, so it was quite refreshing. When we first heard that, we thought, Well, we just can't do it. But then you think about it: this is a really good, refreshing view of death, talking about it that way. In that particular case I think yes, there was a desire to shock an audience by talking about something that was not talked about.\n\nDOUGLAS ADAMS (before he authored The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Adams had been a writing partner of Chapman's on non-Python projects and had contributed some material to Python's final television season): It's easy to underestimate Graham's great role in Python, because he was in many ways the least distinctive in a lot of people's minds. The others would all tell stories of how they'd all be suggesting this and arguing about that, and Graham would sit there puffing on his pipe and quietly, in his tweedy way, think very, very naughty thoughts, and then every now and then would just interject something completely off-the-wall that would catch everybody by surprise, and then substantially turn something around. There's a much-repeated story I certainly heard from Graham, which was [about] a sketch that John had written by himself. It was based on something that made him very, very cross, which is often where a good sketch would come from, because he'd been sold a faulty toaster and he was going to complain about it. He wrote this whole sketch about this faulty toaster, and it was a beautifully written, beautifully crafted sketch, good sort of pear shape to it, and Graham must have listened to it or read it. As the story goes, John was feeling a bit cross that he'd done all this work and Graham was merely sitting there, and Graham's only remark was \"Yes, it's boring, why not make it a parrot instead?\" Whereupon it suddenly transforms into one of the most famous sketches they ever did.\n\nDAVID SHERLOCK (Chapman's companion of 23 years): Graham was fairly notorious as a boozer through the 70s, and yet he could often start work at 11 in the morning with a large tumbler of gin and tonic beside him and work through the whole day apparently sober, absolutely totally undetectable. He was a gentleman drunk, rather like Jimmy Stewart in Harvey, sort of gentle. The whole fun of that movie is that Jimmy Stewart is actually drunk all the time and yet you're never quite sure. That was the same with Graham.\n\nJOHN CLEESE: I have one very, very, very clear memory, and it was the day we were shooting \"The Upper-Class Twit of the Year\" [an \"athletic\" competition for upper-class twits] at some big sports arena in north London for And Now for Something Completely Different [a film version of some of the group's best sketches]. Graham for some reason wasn't there, and we all wanted to check a point in the script, and none of us could find a copy, and Michael said, \"Oh, Graham's got a script in his briefcase.\" And Michael opened the briefcase, took the script out, and then did a double take, because there was a bottle (I think of vodka) in the briefcase. And Michael looked absolutely stunned, and somebody said, \"What's the matter?\" And Michael said, \"That was full when we left this morning,\" and it was like quarter past 10, and the bottle was half empty. That was the moment when I realized that instead of needing a bit of a drink now and then, he was seriously into it. But my recollection is that his performing began to get affected in the second season.\n\nTERRY JONES: When he was drinking, the worst thing would be he I couldn't remember his lines, and [Ian MacNaughton, the group's director] would be quite remorseless with him, like in the studio shows, and make him go over and do it. I remember doing one sketch where we must have done about 24 takes of something, and then we had a problem because when Graham eventually got the line right, the audience cheered. [Just listening to it], you don't know why there's cheering! We tried taking the cheer off [in the editing room], but we couldn't quite do it. That was a bit awkward.\n\nTERRY GILLIAM: Graham to me was guy that wherever we went, he was the one who would come back the next morning with tales that we all wanted to hear, because he was out there. Whenever you go into a public restaurant suddenly he'd disappear. You look around; he'd be under somebody else's table, licking the girl's feet while her date is there. That was the real thing; he was genuinely mad. And it's funny because he was really in a sense the shyest and most conservative. He pushed himself right out there all the time.\n\nThe first Python show, broadcast on October 5, 1969, demonstrated quite clearly that the group was after something uncategorizable. It presented a surreal mix of violence (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart hosts a program depicting famous deaths); television parodies (\"We find that 9 out of 10 British housewives can't tell the difference between Whizzo Butter and a dead crab.'' \"It's true, we can't!\"); and intellectually tainted comic bits (Picasso paints while riding a bicycle, followed by Kandinsky, Mondrian, Chagall, Miro, Dufy, Jackson Pollock, \"and Bernard Buffet making a break on the outside\"). Running throughout the program were gags and animations about pigs. Though the series wasn't an overnight sensation, it quickly found a devoted audience.\n\nMICHAEL PALIN: Partly because of its programming and the time it went out [late on Sunday nights], Python clearly was seen as very much for an adult audience, which is very interesting because nowadays the spirit of Python burns on in 10-year-olds, 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds—so many children love Python. But at the time it was seen as an adult show. I'd never really been involved in an \"adult\" show, kind of X-rated comedy show, and this seemed to be the image of it. And also we became sort of the intellectuals' darling for a bit, written up in The Observer, things like that.\n\nTERRY GILLIAM: The BBC I think were constantly uncomfortable with us. They didn't know quite what we were, and I think they were slightly embarrassed by it, and yet it was too successful, it was making all this noise out there. When they took us off after the fourth show (this was the first series), we were off for a couple of weeks. I think there was a serious attempt to ditch it at that point. But there was too much noise being made by us. They would put us out at all these different times, and change it, but somehow the word got out and they kept us on.\n\nJOHN CLEESE: I had a friend who was trying to watch the series, and he sat down in his hotel room in Newcastle and switched it on and there was this hysterical start to Monty Python about this guy wandering around being terribly boring about all the ancient monuments around Newcastle. And he watched it falling about, and said it's real nerve to do this, it's really terrific, and what a great start to the show. And about 20 minutes in he realized it was [some local program—Newcastle had gone off-network at that hour].\n\nThe nicest thing anybody ever said about Python was that they could never watch the news after it. You get in a certain frame of mind and then almost anything's funny!\n\nThe group would go on to film two more 13-episode seasons for the BBC (as well as a fourth half-season in which Cleese declined to participate, having grown bored with the sketch format). In the spring of 1974, the Pythons embarked on production of their first \"real\" film, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, a jaunty but painstakingly realized vision of Arthurian Britain. The thin thread of a story—the knights of Camelot searching for the Holy Grail—allowed for a joyfully irreverent mixture of comic riffs, mock heroics, and song in which bits and pieces of Arthurian mythology (along with the stale conventions of Hollywood period epics) were all targets for satire.\n\nTERRY JONES: Originally the script went between the Middle Ages and the 20th century, and ended with [King Arthur] finding the Holy Grail in Harrods. I was very much into the Middle Ages with my Chaucer stuff, and I had not been very keen on the 20th-century stuff. Mike had come up with this horse-and-coconut thing at one stage [instead of riding horses, the film's characters pretend to ride while making hoof-beat sound effects with a pair of coconuts], and so I suppose in a group meeting I said, \"Why don't we do it all Middle Ages?\" And everybody seemed to agree. Maybe it was the perception that the modern material wasn't stronger, and also I said it would be more interesting, less like the TV shows, if it's all set in one period.\n\nThere was quite a lot of debate about [who should play Arthur]. I think in the end nobody wanted to do it.\n\nDAVID SHERLOCK: Nobody wanted to play the lead because they thought it was hammy, it was too dry. All they wanted to do was play all the cameos, where you could then have a nice long break before doing the next cameo! But Graham realized not that his part was a star part but that it was essential to hold the rest of the film together, and I think he had a better overview. That may be simplistic—I'm sure they all had the overview—but they didn't want to do it, and he said, \"O.K., I'll do it.\" And inadvertently stole the show.\n\nMICHAEL PALIN: Graham as a performer had a quiet intensity which, if you look at all of his performances, quite unlike any of the rest of us, is very convincing whatever he does. That's why he was so good as Brian, so good as Arthur. Here was a man who genuinely suffered, you know, trying to get through this world—he just happened to be a king, it wasn't his fault, he was trying to do his best, and all these people around him were just mucking him up.\n\nTERRY JONES: When we actually started the first shot of Holy Grail, I was going to shoot this bit on the edge of this gorge, and Graham was trembling and shaking, wouldn't go anywhere near the edge. I think he said it was fear of heights, which we thought was really odd because he'd been our mountaineering expert. I certainly didn't realize this was because he was doing cold turkey at the time, he was trying not to drink. So we couldn't do some of the shots that we wanted close to the edge. But that was all sort of slightly swallowed up by disasters such as the camera shearing its gears on the first take!\n\nThe technical demands of filmmaking, as opposed to television-making, caused some friction between co-directors Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam and the rest of the group.\n\nHOWARD ATHERTON (camera operator on Holy Grail). John Cleese was very impatient quite often. He would say, \"How many laughs in that?\" In other words, you're wasting time on the wrong thing. He thought the only thing you should spend time on was getting the humor right, whereas Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam especially wanted it to look like a film and not like television. So there was always that battle going on between the Pythons.\n\nTERRY JONES: I remember Mike getting really ratty when we were doing the \"Plague Village.\" His job was being a peasant who had to crawl through the mud and go to one spot where there was some chocolate in the mud and he had to start eating this chocolate. He'd spent the whole morning [eating this fake excrement], then he realized that he wasn't on-camera all the time. He did get a bit ratty about it, quite rightly!\n\nJOHN GOLDSTONE (executive producer of Holy Grail and sole producer of the group's subsequent two films): Holy Grail was very risky. There was no completion guaranty, it was just hoping it could be done, it really was. [But] it wasn't until the postproduction and first cut that anything seemed to be awry. We had this disastrous investors' screening when the film was supposedly finished. What had happened was, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones decided to make it as real as possible, to have a soundtrack that was very real, bone-crunching and everything. And so at this screening we had, it wasn't getting the response from the audience that we'd expected.\n\nTERRY JONES: It started off with everybody laughing at the beginning and then after a while just nothing; the whole film went through [with] no laughter at all. And it was awful—I was sitting there saying, \"It just can't be unfunny.\" So I went and redubbed it, and as soon as anybody started talking I just took all the sound effects out, all the atmosphere, everything. I went through the entire film doing that, and that seemed to help—it was something about the soundtrack filling in all the pauses.\n\nERIC IDLE: We had 13 previews, ranging from bloody awful to finally hilarious. That's what good ' comedy editing does, shifts it from a theory to tailored to the audience's response. It helps when you have four new brains (who are also the writers and the stars) coming in and suggesting what should be cut and what could be moved elsewhere.\n\nDuring a promotional tour for Holy Grail, when asked what the group's next film would be, Idle responded, \"Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory.\" That quip was the genesis of Monty Pythons next film, the 1979 biblical spoof Life of Brian, which became the group's greatest financial success and spurred the Pythons on to their final film, 1983's The Meaning of Life.\n\nJOHN CLEESE: Everything that was good about Life of Brian was bad about Meaning of Life. Life of Brian, we knew instinctively what we were writing about, everybody was writing well, the story (which we're not very good at) developed remarkably easily and organically, we knew that we were onto something good and funny and meaningful. That was a great project, and then we made a terrible mistake: when Life of Brian came out and it was such a big hit (a very big hit by our standards), Denis O'Brien [the group's manager at the time] said to us—and it remains to this day the single most misleading bit of information I've ever been given—\"If you guys make another film almost straightaway, you'll never have to work again in your lives.\" And so we started trying to create a film, even though we needed a break from each other. All we did was accumulate material, a third of which was really good, a third of which was O.K., a third of which I thought was not good enough.\n\nERIC IDLE: We never found the theme till the end. I think it would have been perfect if we had given it one extra draft. We nearly got there, but John was reluctant to meet, so we just went ahead and shot it anyway. It still has great stuff in it and is still marvelously offensive!\n\nTERRY GILLIAM: I actually think we didn't do the film we should have done. There was Monty Python's World War III, which I thought had some wonderful stuff in there, with all the soldiers wearing advertising, like race-car drivers—ads are being taken out on all the soldiers, on the weapons, everything. But then the one that I really liked was a whole Python film that was a court case. We were in the dock and the prosecution was trying to prove that what we were watching, this film we had made, is not a film, it's a tax dodge.\n\nJOHN GOLDSTONE: When I went out to raise the money for Meaning of Life, it was already a given that the Pythons would have to have final cut and artistic control. Also, what they were very keen about by then was having proper fees up front, so that needed a major studio to do that level of fee.\n\nThere was a little bidding war; I mean, every studio wanted the next Python film, and I just felt Universal was the most easygoing in a way. It was kind of interesting how the thing happened as well. I didn't show them the screenplay, I just did one page, which was the lyrics of a song that Eric had written about what was going to be in this movie [\"There's everything in this movie / Everything that fits / From the meaning of life in the Universe / To girls with great big tits ... \"] and they bought it on that.\n\nThings had changed internally, though, in Python by then. This was now 1982, and they'd all been doing their own things for a while, so this new movie somehow wasn't done with quite the same blinding commitment as the earlier ones.\n\nMICHAEL PALIN: I tend to think that the only creative work thrives on economy, in a sense. More money doesn't mean better comedy, I don't think it ever has. The best comedy is some sort of complaint or conflict anyway—that's what it's about—so it's probably better if the comedy writers are up against it than if they're being softened up with large amounts of money, because then you become formulaic.\n\nTERRY GILLIAM: It was work habits that had changed. We weren't all at the same level trying to work just for the show. I mean, lifestyles were getting in the way: \"I'm a Hollywood Star, I need this ...\" It's not [that] one is right or wrong, it's just they're different ways of working. Work habits: that's the only way I can describe it.\n\nJOHN CLEESE: I think there was a general sense that [The Meaning of Life] had not been a very satisfactory experience, and while I don't remember a conscious decision not to make another film, I think it was like when you go to a restaurant that isn't very good: you don't actually say, \"I'm never going back there again,\" you just discover three years later that you've never been drawn back. I think it was like that.\n\nOn October 4, 1989, almost 20 years to the day since the first broadcast of Monty Python's Flying Circus, Graham Chapman died at the age of 48. On March 7, 1998, HBO gathered the Pythons together for an informal stage appearance during the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado, taping the proceedings for broadcast. Apart from being the first public meeting of all five surviving Pythons in many years, the occasion became noteworthy for the almost sacrilegious handling of the supposed \"ashes\" of Graham Chapman, which were brought up in his stead and which ended up being vacuumed by a Dustbuster.\n\nJOHN CLEESE: What was really nice about Aspen and also the subsequent dinner that four of us had in London was just to see how well we all got on. As the main cause of dispute in the group (which was the material) has faded into the background, it enables us all to get on in the way that we basically always did get on—a personal level. The relationships have always been quite good; it's been the work that's thrown up the cause of the disagreements. And we got on well, and that's why we thought it would be fun to do something [for the group's 30th anniversary this year; there had been talk of a stage show, a tour, even a new film].\n\nBut then the very next day Terry Gilliam said to Michael Palin and Terry Jones that he didn't really want to do it, which is not what he said in the room. And then some weeks, months later, Michael decided he didn't really want to do six or eight weeks [of live performances], he really only wanted to do two. So trying to get everybody's needs together has proved very difficult.\n\nTERRY GILLIAM: That Aspen thing, it was like aspic. We were up there, thought we were almost mum: mified! There's a crowd three or four rows back, the entire cast of Cheers, Ted Danson and Woody Harrelson, grinning with these beaming, Moonie smiles: \"It's the Pythons/\" And we're just talking like [imitating an old fogy], \"Well, in my day when we used to do comedy ...\"\n\nERIC IDLE: Aspen was very beneficial for us. We got a chance to see each other again—apart from Terry Gilliam, who was still in his fascist \"I'm a Director\" stage and wouldn't have dinner with us but went running off to hang out with Hunter S. Thompson. What a lapse of taste! Still, he's a Yank, you know.\n\nWhether we will ever be able to agree on anything ever again is moot. I think groups use up all their agreements early and then all that is left is to disagree. But I'm not sure whether I agree with that.\n\nExcerpted from Monty Python Speaks!, by David Morgan, to be published this month by Spike/Avon Books Inc.; © 1999 by the author."
