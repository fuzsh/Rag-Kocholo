        "text": "AUCKLAND CIVIC THEATRE WEDNESDAY 23RD MARCH – SOLD OUT!\n\nAUCKLAND CIVIC THEATRE THURSDAY 24TH MARCH\n\nBook at Ticketekmaster 0800 111 999\n\nwww.ticketmaster.co.nz\n\nWELLINGTON MICHAEL FOWLER CENTRE MONDAY 28TH MARCH\n\nBook at Ticketek 0800 842 538\n\nwww.ticketek.co.nz\n\nTICKETS ON SALE NOW!\n\nBritain’s living legends of comedy, and the founders of Monty Python, John Cleese and Eric Idle, announce a New Zealand tour for their must-see new show, John Cleese & Eric Idle: Together Again At Last…For The Very First Time. The 2016 tour will see the British icons perform unforgettable shows in March 2016.\n\n“Eric and I had huge fun touring the States in October and now we can bring our show to the friendliest people in the world” John Cleese said on the announcement of the Australasian tour. “No one show will be the same and all of them will annoy the Politically Correct.”\n\nIn Together Again At Last…For The Very First Time, Cleese and Idle will blend scripted and improvised bits with storytelling, musical numbers, exclusive footage, aquatic juggling and an extended audience Q&A to craft a unique comedic experience with every performance. No two shows will be quite the same, thus ensuring that every audience feels like they’re seeing Together Again At Last… For The Very First Time, for the very first time. And now you know why the show is called that, don’t you?\n\nAs founding members of Monty Python, Cleese and Idle are unarguably among the godfathers of modern comedy, helping to pioneer an irreverent, absurdist sensibility that is emulated by comics around the world. As individuals, they have written, performed and produced some of the most beloved and critically-acclaimed shows of all-time like Spamalot, A Fish Called Wanda, Fawlty Towers and The Rutles.\n\nJOHN CLEESE\n\nOn the small screen, John Cleese is known for his work on programs such as Cheers, 3rd Rock from the Sun, Will & Grace, and the Emmy-nominated TLC documentary The Human Face with John Cleese. His film credits include Silverado, The Out-of-Towners, Rat Race and Kenneth Branagh’s Frankenstein. He also co-authored two best-selling books on psychology – Families and How to Survive Them and Life and How to Survive It – and served briefly as Minister of Defense in the John Major Cabinet. He recently completed his autobiography So, Anyway… that was described by the Daily Mail as “self-obsessed.” In his twilight years, John passes his time writing film scripts, giving speeches to business audiences, doing seminars on creativity, teaching at Cornell, paying alimony, and doting on three huge cats and a fish.\n\nERIC IDLE\n\nLong unmemorable as an actor, Eric Idle has trotted out an interminable number of glib performances in funny wigs and a bad moustache in numerous films and television appearances. But it is as a writer that he will be best forgotten, with credits that include Hello Sailor, Pass the Butler, The Greedy Bastard Diary, The Road to Mars, Monty Python’s Flying Circus, The Rutland Dirty Weekend Book, The Rutles, Spamalot, Not The Messiah and What About Dick? He also sings, tours, acts in bad movies, writes annoying songs, and generally never shuts up. Despite having Grammy, Tony, Writer’s Desk, Lifetime Achievement, and numerous other awards thrust at him, Eric refuses to go away quietly. It’s not right. He is currently sullying the internet at ericidle.com (and @EricIdle onTwitter).\n\nwww.abpresents.com.au"
