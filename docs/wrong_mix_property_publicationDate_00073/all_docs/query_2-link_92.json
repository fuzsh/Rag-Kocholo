        "text": "Residents at a Hollywood Hills home were evacuated Monday night after a piece of certified mail yielded an unknown powdery substance, the Los Angeles Police Department said.\n\nA resident opened the mail and a powder came out, so the resident called police at approximately 6:30 p.m., police said. The home is in the 3100 block of Floye Drive.\n\nThe home belongs to Eric Idle and Tania Kosevich, NBC4 confirmed. Idle is an English comedian best known as a member of the comedy group Monty Python. Kosevich, his wife, is a former model.\n\nOfficials said they treated the scene as an anthrax scare.\n\nUltimately, no hazardous chemical was found and no powder was discovered in the envelope, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Two women were taken to a hospital as a precautionary measure, but they did not display any symptoms, the LAFD said."
