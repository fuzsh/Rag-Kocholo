        "text": "The Greedy Bastard Diary: A Comic Tour of America by Eric Idle\n\n'I still feel somewhat nervous encroaching on the Palin territory of writing a travel diary based on a journey...thought it is true, I reason, that all the Pythons have been involved in documentaries. So this must be a Python thing. What is this urge to probe and examine by ex-comedians? Are they tired of dressing up as women? Surely not.' - Eric Idle The man who brought you the anthems 'Always look on the bright side of life' and 'Sit on my Face and Tell me That You Love Me' shows his naughty bits - and much more! As he crossed the US on The Greedy Bastard Tour, Eric Idle kept a diary on the Monty Python website updating fans with his experiences, insights and observations. Inspired by those blogs, THE GREEDY BASTARD DIARY is an honest, hysterical and moving book - part travelogue, part memoir - that chronicles those 80 days on the road, offering Idle's thoughts on his career, personal life and the country he now calls his home. Reflective, ironic, and stamped with his renowned wit, this illuminating work takes readers on a personal tour with the legendary star and offers an intimate, close-up look inside the man as never before.\n\n'This madly frank and funny diary fills us in on the 2003 tour, as well as various flash points in Idle's life.' EVENING STANDARD (26/6/06) 'A kind of rolling autobiography, mixing affectionate memories of the early Python days, and hilarious accounts of life on the road.' CHOICE (July 2006) 'Part memoir part travelogue. Idle keeps an honest and moving diary.' EXPRESS (7/7/06) 'There are plenty of laughs to be had and Python fans will lap it up' HAM & HIGH (23/6/06) 'Highly entertaining, the diary is also a wonderful insight into the workings of his brilliantly tangential mind... You won't be able to get enough.' GOOD BOOK GUIDE"
