        "text": "__ Engage a few dozen big-brain luminaries in a conversation about the future, and what do you get? Streaming consciousness. __\n\nDANNY HILLIS, Disney fellow; designer of the Millennium Clock: I am convinced that we humans are just at the beginning of our journey, on our way to becoming something more wonderful than we can imagine.\n\nSTEVE BALLMER, president, Microsoft: We have only just begun to scratch the surface of what is possible.\n\nDAVID GELERNTER, professor of computer science, Yale University; author, 1939:The Lost World of the Fair: The future was and remains the quintessential American art form. Other nations sit back and let their futures happen; we construct ours. We can let the future happen, or take the trouble to imagine it. We can imagine it dark or bright - and in the long run, that's how it will be.\n\nANDY GROVE, chair, Intel: I believe in the future as a stochastic process. Technologically, there are independent developments occurring, so that even if one area gets derailed, another development takes its place. Thomas Edison made a bunch of inventions, but do you really think that life would be different today if he hadn't lived? Most discoveries in science take place in several places in the same general time frame - like packets on the Internet: You can lose some packets on one path and the alternate path will still deliver the information. The future is going to take care of itself, like it always has.\n\nSTAN LEE, founder, Marvel Comics: If you're interested in technology and the progress of humankind, this is the most exciting period ever.\n\n__ The future smells like the Washington, DC, subway system. - Moby __\n\nFRAN LIEBOWITZ, humorist: But here's what's lacking: Science has done absolutely nothing about noise. The worst design flaw in the human body is that you can't close your ears. The reason you can't close your ears is, if a lion was coming, you had to wake up. Today no lions are coming. Beeping trucks are coming. I read the other day that the guy who invented the beep when trucks go backward, he died. I thought: Of course - he dies, I have to listen to it.\n\nMARK MOTHERSBAUGH, musician, producer; cofounder, Devo: Technology in movies is still boring. What happened to feelies and animated holograms?\n\nKATE STARBIRD, forward, Sacramento Monarchs: Where's the toothpaste that was supposed to come in all different flavors, like hamburger? Also, I know a lot of people who could use more knee cartilage - artificial cartilage you wouldn't have to graft. I'm always trying to order new parts. A new back wouldn't hurt.\n\nSCOTT MCNEALY, CEO, Sun Microsystems: Dick Tracy two-way wrist radios.\n\nKENNY SCHARF, painter, sculptor: Trips to the moon! We were promised, but it didn't happen, and I'm mad!\n\n__ For us believing physicists, the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion. - Albert Einstein __\n\nNORMAN SCHWARZKOPF, former commander in chief, US Army Central Command: If we would get off our butts and provide the necessary funding for research, we would have a cure for all types of cancers.\n\nSKY DAYTON, chair, EarthLink Network: We've gotta get off the wheel. It's had its run. Why not a bike-like vehicle that hovers above the ground and is powered by some engine that runs forever on a banana peel? Or maybe you just stick somebody into a T3 line and send them to New York. You just append them to an email message, even send them to multiple places - spam them: \"Hey, my wife hasn't been delivered yet! She's stuck on AOL's servers!\"\n\nJ. RICHARD GOTT III, professor of astrophysics, Princeton University: When I was a kid, you'd go see the car of the future, and everyone knew what it looked like. It had a bubble top and it had fins on the back and it drove itself down the expressway. You could play cards while you were driving. So why, in all these years, has no one ever, ever built a car of the future? Maybe people would buy it!\n\nTIM KOOGLE, CEO, Yahoo!: We're all doing our best with videoconferencing and stuff over the Web. But still, you can't quite replace physically being in front of somebody. I want teleporting - Beam me up, Scotty! - without jet lag.\n\nTIM BERNERS-LEE, inventor of the Web; author, Weaving the Web: Broken links, Web pages whose content is not accessible to people with disabilities, and pages you can't bookmark, because they don't have their own URL - these are all things we must leave behind!\n\n__ I'm looking forward to when people have tiny little goldfish swimming in one eye or feathers growing out of their backs. - Neil Gaiman __\n\nNEIL GAIMAN, author, Sandman comics: I am looking forward to the time when I can write a novel with something that looks like a fountain pen and a piece of paper, but lets me save, store, send, et cetera. I would also really, really like to see a Tasmanian tiger, which became extinct in 1936. We have some pickled thylacines in jars. Someday someone will clone one, and I'd like to see that walking around before I die.\n\nMARK LEYNER, author, The Tetherballs of Bougainville: I'm pro eternal life. I don't care what pathetic shape I'm in, I want to be kept alive at all costs - for society and my family.\n\nERIC SCHMIDT, CEO, Novell: In 2040, I think my primary concern will be life extension. Baby boomers as a group are going to be really obnoxious old people because we're used to getting our way, and I suspect a lot of us will be concerned about aging. Instead of going to business conferences, I'll go to being-old-and-having-a-good-time conferences. And everyone will be talking about the successors to Viagra and getting a better heart put in.\n\nFRANCIS COLLINS, director, National Human Genome Research Institute: In the next 20 to 30 years, we should aim to have a complete computer model of a cell, to solve the problem of predicting protein structure from amino-acid sequence, and to deduce all the major steps in evolution.\n\nBRUCE STERLING, author, Distraction: My dream appliance circa 2050 has one big dial on it, and when I twist it to the right, my IQ goes up to 450.\n\nJOHN LINNELL, musician, They Might Be Giants: They should affix the tray table of the person sitting behind you on an airplane to something other than your own seat.\n\nRICHARD PRESTON, author, The Hot Zone: The common cold. I'm not terribly optimistic here. There are 105 known strains of cold viruses. Each one will need to have its own vaccine unless we can figure out some kind of supervaccine. Cancer also will be cured with vaccines. If you develop a melanoma or a brain tumor, you'll go to the doctor, and for the equivalent of about $10, you'll get a shot that will block it.\n\nJ. CRAIG VENTER, president and chief scientific officer, Celera: Fifty years from now, when babies are born, they will have their own complete genetic code determined before they leave the hospital. Whatever the equivalent of the CD-ROM is then - probably some tiny card - will be handed to each baby's parents. The parents will get a prediction of the physical makeup of their child, in terms of likelihood of getting different diseases, type of metabolism, trends for personality, mental skills in a broad sense. We'll also be able to look backward. We'll be able to draw an exact map of how each species has evolved and what genetic changes have taken place. The chimp genome compared with the human - we'll probably find it's almost all the same.\n\nBRUCE STERLING: I expect science to be conquered by market forces just like the Internet was, so that science becomes indistinguishable from product development. There will still be a few guys in ivory towers pursuing basic questions, but they'll be regarded as arty cranks who have outlived their time. This should mean that quarks and neutrinos are forgotten, while we get consumer toothbrushes as complex as cyclotrons.\n\nNEIL GAIMAN: I'm looking forward to when bioengineering moves from technology to handicraft: biotech on the other side of necessity, where it enters the realm of nose piercing. People with tiny little goldfish swimming in one eye or feathers growing out of their backs. I'd love to be in a world where women grow penises because it is fashionable, or you can have an eye replacement of a different color or from a different species. All the adults will say, \"Tut, tut, tut, girls never had penises in my day. We used to pierce our noses and lips. Why don't you do that?\" And the kids will say, \"Mom, you're so old-fashioned.\" All good technology should be used to piss off people's parents.\n\nMARC ANDREESSEN, cofounder and chair, Loudcloud: Right now my favorite book about the future is Cryptonomicon, by Neal Stephenson - competing with Ken MacLeod's novels (Star Fraction, The Cassini Division, et cetera), John Brunner's The Shockwave Rider, Vernor Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep, Ray Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines, and David Brin's Earth.\n\nMOBY, DJ: My favorite book about the future is Brave New World. It was presented to me as very dystopian, but it seemed quite nice. People could choose to use mind-altering drugs, and those who chose not to could go live on an island.\n\nNATHAN MYHRVOLD, CTO, Microsoft: Jules Verne's Paris in the Twentieth Century. It is amazing how much Verne could predict - and equally amazing what he couldn't predict. It helps keep current prognostications in perspective.\n\nOLIVER SACKS, neurologist; author, The Island of the Colorblind: As I boy, I loved H. G. Wells. The Time Machine is still my favorite book about the future, partly because of its combination of great optimism with deep pessimism. But Freeman Dyson's latest book (The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet) is as penetrating a prevision of the next century as we are likely to see.\n\nGEORGE DYSON, historian; author, Darwin Among the Machines: The Time Machine presents a dark view of the future - humankind divided by technology and class distinction - but ends on a fragile note of hope. It's a family favorite - a book my father paid tribute to in a recent work of his own (Imagined Worlds), and a story that calmed my upset daughter, who phoned me three weeks ago to complain that she was trapped with an unresponsive television-watching baby-sitter and was upstairs in her room alone. I had a Penguin pocket edition of The Time Machine with me and started reading it over the phone: \"The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed ....\"\n\nROBERT ZUBRIN, president of the Mars Society; author, The Case for Mars: We will have people on Mars, if not within the next 10 years, then within the next 20. We will see human towns on Mars before my natural lifetime ends, and we'll see a pioneering mission to the asteroid belt before the end of the 21st century. The establishment of permanent settlements on Mars will be the driver of technological progress in many areas, like controlled fusion. You don't need controlled fusion to get the first people to Mars any more than you needed steamships to get the first Europeans to America. But controlled fusion will make possible access all the way to the outer solar system and the Oort cloud. Eventually, there will even be interstellar missions.\n\nA thousand years from now there will be human civilizations on hundreds of planets. And those civilizations will look back on this period of history as a kind of golden age, almost as we look back on ancient Athens. And even though their technology will be as superior to ours as ours is to that of Periclean Athens, they will look back at our time and wonder about us.\n\nTODD OLDHAM, fashion designer: Visit Mars? Oh yeah. Gosh, I love red.\n\nOLIVER SACKS: I'd very much like to visit Mars - and the moon and the depths of the ocean.\n\nSIMON REYNOLDS, author, Generation Ecstasy: I'd rather go to Callisto or Titan or the asteroid belt.\n\n__ I am in search of the simple elegant seductive maybe even obvious IDEA. With this in my pocket I cannot fail. - Tibor Kalman __\n\nRUDY RUCKER, professor of computer science, San Jose State University; author, Seek: Jupiter - I love clouds and turbulence and seething stuff like that.\n\nMARK MOTHERSBAUGH: I'd enjoy a planet where you need less protective gear.\n\nERIC IDLE, cofounder, Monty Python's Flying Circus; author, The Road to Mars: So what will we take with us? Of course, what we take with us will be show business. In the future, Mars is a bit like Vegas, the home of showbiz. The next step will be for the colonists on Mars to throw off the hand of the United States. There will be this wonderful historical irony. When the people on Mars write a declaration of independence saying, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident ...,\" the US will be rather pissed off. I was planning to write about this in my recent book, but I thought, 'You naughty Brit!'\"\n\nSALLY RIDE, president, space.com; first American woman in space: It's probably going to be 10 or 15 years before we send astronauts to Mars, but in that same amount of time we'll be sending small numbers of people into orbit around Earth, people other than professional astronauts. In 20 or 30 years, space will be a tourist destination. You'll drive out to the launchpad, use your electronic ticket, strap into a rocket, and visit space to experience weightlessness for a few hours or a few days. I picture space settlements as relatively modest. They are research settlements, much like the research stations in Antarctica. They look like they belong on the planet they're on, made with the material that's available - the red dirt of Mars, for example: adobe, well landscaped.\n\nTIM KOOGLE: It would be so cool to live long enough to meet beings on other planets. I think they will be not on Mars but in other solar systems. I'd love to go there.\n\n__ The extension of the Internet to everybody on the planet will lead to the decentralization of power, with all humans participating. - Robert Anton Wilson __\n\nPIERRE OMIDYAR, chair, eBay: As long as there are people out there in space, eBay will be serving their needs.\n\nRICHARD PRESTON: In the summer of 1969, I was 15 years old and traveling in Italy with my parents. We were staying in a fleabag motel on the bay of Naples and went to the local bar to watch the landing on the moon. There were not many televisions in this rather seedy part of town, so the entire neighborhood was there. The newscaster became absolutely hysterical when word came that Armstrong had landed. There was this incredible outburst, and then everybody in the bar started shaking hands and drinking. It became absolutely clear that this was not an American accomplishment, but a human accomplishment. At the age of 15, I realized that the future had arrived.\n\nJEFF HAWKINS, chair and chief product officer, Handspring: I've seen the future in a StarTAC cell phone. The first time I saw one, I took it apart. I was in awe. I realized there's no limit to how small you can build things.\n\nTOM PETERS, management guru; author, The Brand You 50: Where have I been that seems like it's already the future? Il Fornaio restaurant in Silicon Valley at eight o'clock in the evening, watching people who used to dress casually, and are now wearing expensive suits, spend kajillions of dollars on specious ideas - some of which will be important. Anyone who would bet a lot of money on a given Internet stock is an idiot. Anyone who would not bet a lot of money on a portfolio that includes Internet stocks is an even bigger idiot.\n\nTODD OLDHAM: Tokyo. Harajuku at night. Wow!\n\n__ A small group of thoughtful people could change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. - Margaret Mead __\n\nMOBY: The future smells like the Washington, DC, subway system. New but not too new. Clean but not too clean. The smell is 90 percent artificial and 10 percent organic. It's like my experience recently, lying on the grass in New York City's Battery Park - 78 degrees and humid, the sound of the sailboats in the distance, New Jersey in front of me, the World Trade Center behind. I was gazing up at the trees. But the trees had been there only three weeks.\n\nANGELINA JOLIE, actor: I'm hoping that the future turns out to be more of a Native American movie than a sci-fier, something where we're all riding horses and living off the land.\n\nINGRID NEWKIRK, cofounder, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals: My favorite science-fiction movie is Soylent Green, for a) showing old, sick people drifting off to their favorite sights and sounds before anyone had a chance to hook them up to life support, and b) showing Charlton Heston being ... shot!\n\nSCOTT MCNEALY: The Wizard of Oz. I like the part when the Wizard says, \"Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.\"\n\nBILLY BOB THORNTON, actor, director: The Reluctant Astronaut, with Don Knotts.\n\nNADJA SALERNO-SONNENBERG, concert violinist: I'm the original sci-fi fan! I learned how to speak English from Star Trek. Kirk? Please. I would have given limbs to work under Kirk, the coolest guy in the world. He slept with all sorts of alien women - women with one eye, you name it. What would I want to have from Star Trek? Very easy: Between the rigors of travel and the demise of every single airline, I would give anything for the transporter. If I had to play in San Francisco tonight and I were in New York, I'd take a shower around 6, have my chicken soup around 6:30, put on my outfit around 7:15, then just beam over to the dressing room at Davies Hall!\n\nTOM PETERS: Over a relatively short period of time - 10 years, maybe 25 - the security of the old white-collar job will be pretty well gone. This recent 50- to 60-year period when people worked for big companies - that's going to be the anomalous period of history. A new model is burrowing into the basic DNA of our world. But the cool thing is that it's also the old model. Two hundred years ago, you had to be good at something - damn good - and know a lot about what you were doing, whether it was shooting outlaws or shoeing horses. Then we went through this period where the bureaucracy sheltered us. Today, even the housepainter already gets that there's no grand corporate employer to take care of you, that you've got to be good as hell, show up on time, and know a hell of a lot about paint.\n\nSIMON REYNOLDS: In the future, tribalisms will be ever more elective, provisional, and nongeographical. They will be based around commodity loyalties, star worship, concept allegiance, activity devotion. People will pass through several \"nations\" in a lifetime (the Ska Revival Nation, the Snowboarder Nation, the People's Republic of Christina Ricci, et cetera) or be citizens in many nations concurrently. Maybe one day my passport will read \"raver\".\n\nWhat makes me optimistic is that there's always something to be amazed by: flexibility of spirit, imminent fatherhood, endless ingenuity of the powerless when it comes to outwitting the stratagems of power, the eternal return of \"vibe\" even when it looks like every sector of the pop culture is in terminal doldrums.\n\nINGRID NEWKIRK: What makes me optimistic is reading pompous old editorials arguing against freeing the slaves and \"giving\" women the vote.\n\nNEIL GAIMAN: People. The essential relentless, cheerful, it-will-all-work-out-somehowness that people have.\n\nSCOTT MCNEALY: The paradigm shift that's occurring in technology - the start of the post-PC era, in which we'll access the Net with all kinds of easy-to-use devices: screen phones, two-way pagers, handheld computers, and all kinds of intelligent appliances. Things that are much more simple and a lot less likely to crash.\n\n__ How about a Microsoft vibrator? - John Baldessari __\n\nSTEVE BALLMER: Whether it's shopping, sharing information like your calendar or your family Web site, or online applications and support for businesses of all sizes, these new services will be enabled across an entire new range of devices, giving users access to their information from any place, on any device.\n\nTHOMAS DOLBY ROBERTSON, musician; founder, Beatnik: Soon young people, in particular, will become accustomed to being able to mix their own versions of tunes. You remix one and send it to your friend: \"What do you think of this?\" We'll see prizes for the best amateur remixes and - who knows? - a few may even climb the charts.\n\nMIKE D, rap artist, the Beastie Boys: You can never tell the future. That's the cool thing with music.\n\nROBERT ANTON WILSON, futurist; coauthor, The Illuminatus! Trilogy: The extension of the Internet to everybody on the planet will inevitably lead to what Buckminster Fuller called \"desovereignization\" - the decentralization of power, with all humans participating.\n\nPIERRE OMIDYAR: In The Diamond Age, there's a section in which Neal Stephenson effectively describes a global marketplace: people all over the world offering their services, and others - wherever they might be - contracting to have them. This market lets you transcend the face-to-face boundaries. We're there a little bit. There's an IBMad where a Japanese company is in a serious manufacturing crisis. A group of businessmen sit around a conference table, and one says, \"What about Mitchco?\" It turns out Mitch is some regular down-home guy in Texas. You see him click a button and say, \"Domo arigato.\" There's still a lot that's keeping us from that sort of transaction. People think, \"How can we do a deal with a guy in overalls? We don't speak the same language!\" Getting past those barriers - that's where I hope we're going.\n\n__ Every time I see an adult on a bicycle, I no longer despair for the future of the human race. - H.G. Wells __\n\nNICHOLAS NEGROPONTE, director, MIT Media Lab: Instead of the 220 (plus or minus) countries that we have today, we will have more than 1,000 by 2040. They will form a global federation, united circa 2035. We will celebrate the day of its creation, as well as individual independence days, by staying at home and doing such old-fashioned things as cooking and enjoying a family meal.\n\nJOE KRAUS, cofounder, Excite: By 2040, assuming quantum limits don't present roadblocks, computers will be 70 million times more powerful than they are today. You'll go everywhere accompanied by a halo of generic processors and input/output devices that will converse with you in natural language. They'll watch facial expressions and biometrics to determine your mood. They'll communicate with one another and with the broader network using a range of wireless technologies, seamlessly switching from optical to cellular to satellite as the situation demands. Most important, you won't notice specific applications like digital videography or personal communications. They'll happen seamlessly.\n\nSTEFANO MARZANO, managing director, Philips Design: Theology basically says that God is omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipowerful. And God is a model of human aspiration. People aspire to be everywhere, to know everything, and to be able to do everything. We are being driven in perhaps a very subconscious way toward this vision.\n\nSIMON REYNOLDS: Chameleonic synthetic fabrics that mimic your environment, fluorescent teeth, strobing contact lenses, sea-anemone scalp implants, subdermal shimmer worms, cosmetic goiters, animated tattoos, elective body odor, syncopated facial tics and rictus smiles triggered by neuroelectrical devices, geometrically precise and choreographed epileptic fits triggered by neuroelectrical devices and functioning as free-form solos in the middle of normal dancing.\n\nTOM FORD, creative director, Gucci: The globalization of tastes and colors, especially among luxury products, is making fashion increasingly bland. Everyone is wearing the same things at the same time. This uniformity is so absolute that it can only mean a reverse trend is coming. I think we shall see a return to individualism.\n\n__ You'll be able to change your DNA to make your skin glow like a firefly. - Rudy Rucker __\n\nTODD OLDHAM: Khaki is a safe bet.\n\nMOBY: Armor. Just your basic gunmetal in color.\n\nRUDY RUCKER: Tattoos will be luminous. You'll be able to put something in your DNA that would make your skin glow, like a firefly.\n\nJANEANE GAROFALO, actor, comedian: Being tall, thin, and young.\n\nRICHARD PRESTON: Hair will be piled 2 feet on top of the head like the Flavian ladies of Rome wore it. They lived in the time of the Flavian emperors - around AD 75 - and their hair was held in place with lard (the ancient world's hair gel). Every fashion comes back sooner or later, and we've been waiting 2,000 years for this one, so it's probably due to return soon.\n\nWILLIAM SHATNER, actor: Sunglasses and hats - the ozone hole, you know.\n\nKIM STANLEY ROBINSON, author, the Red Mars/Green Mars/Blue Mars trilogy: One thing I see coming in the near future is machine translation. Soon, you will be able to face anyone on Earth and speak, while your translation box (something like a Palm) will announce what you've said - in their language. This will be good for us. There is a tendency to feel that people who cannot talk to you are not quite human, no matter the obvious signs to the contrary. But if someone were to speak in Urdu or Dravidian or Vietnamese to you, and your translation box said, \"We work in the same economy, so why do I work all day for 10 cents an hour, while 70 percent of the profit from my labor ends up in your pension fund?\" you would regard this person differently than if he remained a mute creature working in a field. Eventually you might have to justify this somehow. You would have to say things like, \"Well, we have more freedom, so we can afford bigger guns,\" and watch their face as this is spoken.\n\nCAROL BARTZ, CEO, Autodesk: Computers have got to be able to communicate with 100 percent natural language and emotion. They've got to do more than just Start, Stop, Open, and Close. They've also got to be able to ask, \"Are you frustrated because you can't find a damn thing?\"\n\nTIM BERNERS-LEE: We won't be using the word \"Internet\" in 2020, just as today we don't say, \"I saw an interesting article on a piece of paper today.\" People will simply talk about the information itself rather than the medium.\n\nMAYA LIN, artist, architect: I'm looking forward to when the house becomes your gadget - the transformable house. Press a button, walls would move, things would raise up, floors would change. Today, houses are getting bigger and bigger. You have to have a movie room, a playroom, an activity room. They're monsters. The transformable house would be a small but big home. You would have only five rooms, but you could change it according to your needs.\n\nI would also love to bring the outdoors in. My idea of the perfect office is the outdoors, literally. You're outdoors floating 50 feet up in the air, totally out there.\n\nMICHELLE KWAN, figure skater: If I have a daughter, my gift to her in 2040 will definitely be SUHS - Sport Utility Hovering Skates - so she can do quintuple axels.\n\nLANCE ARMSTRONG, cyclist: In August, I'd want an air conditioner on my bike, but I don't want entertainment or live stock quotes. You know, I've gotta get away.\n\nNICHOLAS NEGROPONTE: For my great-granddaughter, I'll buy a holographic telepresence machine with a gigabit connection to Internet X, so she can project herself onto her great-granddad's lap anywhere in the world.\n\n__ It's kind of fun to do the impossible. - Walt Disney __\n\nDARREN ARONOFSKY, director, : I played with Lincoln Logs. My parents played with Lincoln Logs. My grandchildren will. Sometimes simpler is better.\n\nJOHN BALDESSARI, artist: How about a Microsoft vibrator?\n\nFRANCIS COLLINS: A microscaled molecular genetic monitor that will detect signs of illness weeks, months, or years before symptoms appear, allowing immediate action to prevent the disease.\n\nDANNY HILLIS: I think the most interesting gifts in 2040 will be not gadgets, but living things bioengineered for specific purposes. A nice gift might be a new kind of plant that lights your garden path at night. Of course, by 2040 those will probably be old hat, so I will have to get the kind that sings to you as you walk by.\n\nHOWARD RHEINGOLD, founder, Electric Minds; author, The Millennium Whole Earth Catalog: It will be possible within a few decades to genetically engineer a new kind of plant that grows voraciously in most climates and soils, but can be controlled economically by nontoxic means. It is nourishing, mildly euphoric, and contraceptive.\n\n__ We won't use the word 'Internet' in 2020. People will simply talk about the information itself. - Tim Berners-Lee __\n\nJULIA CHILD, chef: How about fresh peas that are quicker to shell - you'd just pull one end of it and all the peas would pop out! You could also have a suction gadget that would suck out the fat and not the juice in a frying pan very quickly. (That would probably have to be electronic, don't you think?) Or something for when you're roasting a chicken that would be even better than a thermometer: You could pass it over the chicken, and it would tell you, \"It's almost done, except for in the hip here!\" I think we're going to have even better ingredients - wonderful fruits and vegetables - and I hope we get back into some good red meat.\n\nWIM WENDERS, director: For Christmas in 2030, I'll get the new phone implant. My digital assistant, Genie, will get an upgrade, while my personal assistant will get one of those full-size holographic Christmas trees: You can project it wherever you want, you can walk around it, it smells wonderful, it has real candles (not those terrible electric ones), and you can also shrink it and put it on your bedside table. It even works in your car on the dashboard.\n\nKURT ANDERSEN, author, The Turn of the Century; cofounder, Powerful Media: Christmas is going to be a full-time holiday. We might become \"the nation of Christmas.\" We'll have summer, and we'll have Christmas. You wouldn't necessarily have tinsel every day for six months, but the roast turkey-ish feelings, the Dickensian sleigh bells - the Christmas spirit - you'll have. I've been saying that Martha Stewart should brand Christmas. There's a great opportunity for her - magazines, books, theme parks.\n\nSTEFANO MARZANO: I want to see computing devices we can wear - our new second skin. You'd buy a dress not because it is blue or long but because your videoconference facility or telephone is built into it. You'd get dressed up not because you're going to a party and have to look great but because you want to show your vacation pictures on your outfit.\n\nJOHN BALDESSARI: What I've always wanted is the ability to go through Halliwell's Film Guide and get a code number I just punch in, so I can look at any movie anytime I want.\n\nTONY HAWK, skateboarder: First of all, there should be an archive of every show that's ever been on. And then anything else that you desire to watch, including security cameras from any part of the world.\n\nMARK LEYNER: More access to private amateur sports. I'd really enjoy watching uncoordinated people play tennis.\n\nWIM WENDERS: Only live events will still be called \"television.\" And there'll be live cameras everywhere and anywhere, constantly, from Times Square to the moon. Anything interesting happening anywhere will immediately be live on TV in the rest of the world. You'll just choose the place in the world where you want to be and you will be there, with somebody reporting for you. All forms of entertainment - games, shows, sports, news, et cetera - will be on demand.\n\nNATHAN MYHRVOLD: There won't be TV per se in three decades. There will be video service over the Internet, but it will be as different from TV today as, say, MTV is from the Milton Berle show of the 1950s or from radio plays of the 1940s.\n\nHERBERT ALLEN, president, Allen & Co.: I may laugh at the prediction if I'm still here, but I think there will be a lot less television viewing 10 years from now. I can't imagine that people who are used to the computer and the Internet are going to sit home and watch TV. It's just not as exciting. In the next 10 years, you will have video on demand. I can order up any movie or television show in history - what does that do to those few hours when I can watch? Meanwhile, the difference between computer and television will be tough to figure out. Screens will be everywhere. How many years are we from having a screen that will fan out of a pen that you carry in your breast pocket? You'll be able to play visuals on the inside of your eyeglasses, on your dishwasher.\n\nBEN STEIN, host, Win Ben Stein's Money: In three decades most of what's on TV will be pornography, which will simply blow all other forms of \"art\" off the tube.\n\nKURT ANDERSEN: People who inspire me the most are people who are optimistic but just barely. People like Tibor Kalman, whose last book was Perverse Optimist. His is optimism in the face of all that tells us not to be optimists, being viscerally aware of pessimism and nihilism but not embracing it.\n\nMAYA LIN: Tibor Kalman was very optimistic. So are my two kids - 21 months and 2Â½ months.\n\nDANNY HILLIS: My children Asa, Noah, and India are the most optimistic people I know. They see all people as basically good. They don't yet see anything as impossible.\n\nSCOTT MCNEALY: My 3Â½-year-old son, Maverick.\n\nNEIL GAIMAN: Maddie, my daughter. She's 5, and she's convinced that when she's grown up she's going to be a princess. She originally planned to be a queen, but then she learned she had to marry a king.\n\nBILL JOY, chief scientist, Sun Microsystems: The two most optimistic people I know are John Gage, director of the Science Office at Sun, who was the founder of NetDay to wire the schools (a hopelessly optimistic volunteer effort that has succeeded!), and John Doerr, who shows unbounded optimism that \"insanely great\" business ideas can work.\n\nERIC SCHMIDT: Bill Joy. He has this amazing ability to see the future as a technology initiative.\n\nCAROL BARTZ: My grandmother, who's 95. She's with the program. That tough old bird has never let anything get in her way. She just bought a treadmill last year. I remember as a little girl, living on a farm in Wisconsin, I once came running in the house when I saw a rattlesnake. She went right out there and chopped its head off and said, \"OK, no big deal.\" Today she'll call me and say, \"Why is your stock so low?\" She taught me to just solve the problem and keep moving.\n\nROBERT ANTON WILSON: The people who taught me the most about the value of optimism have all died by now - Tim Leary, Bucky Fuller, Gene Roddenberry - so I guess I'm the most optimistic person I know. They all helped teach me that both optimism and pessimism often function as self-fulfilling prophecies. So, not being a masochist, I choose optimism.\n\nCHRISTY CANYON, adult-film star: Porn star Victoria Paris, who taught me to always use SPF 2, get lots of facials, and worry about wrinkles later.\n\nLANCE ARMSTRONG: People refer to \"the good ol' days,\" but I don't know what they're talking about. As someone who's battled cancer, if I lived more than 20 years ago, I'd be a dead man.\n\nBILL JOY: Many bright people whom I respect believe that 21st-century technology may bring a century of abundance. If we have an era of abundance, we may be able to get past the greed and materialism that has come with hypercapitalism, and connect to each other and our world more spiritually. We also may see the human population start to drop as a result, giving hope for saving more species and the ecosystem of this planet.\n\nSANDRA BERNHARD, comedian: Everybody has a desire to have something much more real. People making so much money and spending so much money. Those people will hit the wall. Believe me, there's a deep longing that none of those kinds of things can fulfill.\n\nANDY GROVE: I long for time. Technology doesn't give time. It takes time away. So, technologically, I'm not a Luddite, but from a lifestyle standpoint I would like to turn the clock back - to a past that never existed, of course.\n\nWIM WENDERS: Spirituality? Definitely. We'll look back with slight embarrassment at the outburst of materialism at the end of the 20th century: \"Remember the consumer age?\"\n\nSKY DAYTON: The Matrix was an inspiration. At the end of the movie, I was screaming. In computer-speak, when you \"have root,\" you can do anything. You can get into other people's computers, you can destroy the system. Regular users can't. In The Matrix, when the lead character could get into root or God mode and totally control the system, that would be the equivalent in the real world of discovering the fundamental laws of life. What makes something alive and what makes something dead? Who are we? What are we? The way into the next chapter is to really understand how life works.\n\nJ. CRAIG VENTER: Who are we? Where did we come from? Where are we going? I hope to live long enough to witness our thorough comprehension of the meanings of life. Of course, I don't think the human brain has the built-in capability to absorb all the information about life's meaning. We'll always, as a species, evoke some higher power, wherever we can't manage the quantity and complexity of information.\n\nERIC IDLE: What is the expansion force of the universe? What keeps it expanding? The secret is levity, which informs the entire universe. I just love abusing Stephen Hawking - that he missed this.\n\nNADJA SALERNO-SONNENBERG: One of these days an alien is going to say, \"Hi, I'm here.\" And everything you thought about your world is going to change.\n\nRUDY RUCKER: A lot of science fiction is wish fulfillment. You can visualize the things you'd like to be able to do, and you wish you could skip the second-by-second process of doing them. There's a temptation to just push a button. And it's kind of cool that you can't push the button, but you can get there. The other day I was thinking, \"Here I am, making it to the year 2000. It's really happening.\" And it struck me that we do have a way to get to the future - it's just that it's hard. Our bodies are the time machine. You actually have to live second by second to get there."
