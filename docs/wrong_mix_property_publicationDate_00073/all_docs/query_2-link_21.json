        "text": "UPDATED: Residents of a home belonging to Monty Python comedian Eric Idle and his wife, former Playboy model Tania Kosevich, were evacuated Monday evening after reports that a powdery substance was found in a piece of mail. But authorities said later that it appeared to be a false alarm.\n\nAccording to NBC4, the resident called police to the 3100 block of Floye Drive near Nichols Canyon in the Hollywood Hills at approximately 6:23 p.m. after opening a certified mail item from Thailand that released a white, powdery substance. Police and fire officials mounted a hazmat response, and two women were taken to a nearby hospital as precaution, Los Angeles Fire Department Battalion Chief Jim Holland told reporters.\n\nHowever, the investigation found that “there was no hazard. There was no chemical found,” Holland said. “There was no powder to be found.”\n\nThe suspect letter was a notice from a shipping company that a package had arrived. What was reported as a powder was probably “just a little bit of dust that may have come from off the envelope,” Holland said. The two women taken to the hospital showed no ill effects.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIdle also tweeted on Tuesday morning that he and his family were safe, and thanked the first responders on the scene.\n\nThe home is a 5,200-square-foot Spanish villa situated on almost three-quarters of an acre.\n\nIdle, 76, is an English comedian and actor best known for his participation in the comedy troupe Monty Python, which created the sketch comedy show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus,” as well as the films “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” “Life of Brian,” and “The Meaning of Life.”\n\nIdle also wrote the Broadway musical “Spamalot,” which was adapted from the “Holy Grail” film. The original 2005 production received 14 Tony award nominations and won in three categories, including best musical. Its most recent run, in 2017, took place in the U.K. Idle has also had several voice acting roles for films such as “Ella Enchanted” and “Shrek the Third” and on “The Simpsons.”"
