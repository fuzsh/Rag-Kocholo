        "text": "LOS ANGELES â€” Emergency crews flocked to the home of the comedian Eric Idle on Monday night after a report of a suspicious powder in an envelope, which turned out not to be dangerous, fire officials said.\n\nPolice said a resident at the address called police about 6:20 p.m. NBC Los Angeles reported that Idle, 76, a longtime member of Monty Python's Flying Circus whose Broadway musical \"Spamalot\" won a Tony Award, lives at the address with his wife, the actor Tania Kosevich.\n\nOfficials initially said they were treating the scene as a possible anthrax scare.\n\nLate Monday night, the Los Angeles Fire Department said that there was no hazard and that two people who were taken to a hospital were transported only as a precaution.\n\nIt wasn't known whether Idle or Kosevich were home at the time."
