        "text": "NEW YORK | Eric Idle is writing a memoir, and Monty Python fans can guess the title: “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.”\n\n“We used to be babe magnets. Now we’re fridge magnets,” Idle said in a statement Wednesday. “I thought it was time to tell my tale before I suffer from Hamnesia, which is what happens to elderly actors.”\n\nCrown Archetype told The Associated Press that Idle’s book is coming out in October. Idle is calling the publication a “Sortabiography.” Crown is calling Idle “A legend in his own lunchtime.”\n\n“With anecdotes sprinkled throughout that involve close friends and luminaries such as Mick Jagger, Steve Martin, Paul Simon, Mike Nichols and many more — let alone the Pythons themselves — Idle captures a time of tremendous creative output with equal hilarity and heart,” according to Crown.\n\nIdle’s previous books include “The Greedy Bastard Diary: A Comic Tour of America” and the novel “The Road to Mars.”"
