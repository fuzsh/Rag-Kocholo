        "text": "Top Ten Tuesday is a meme hosted by The Broke And The Bookish, in which a lot of book bloggers around the world join in by writing a top ten list based on the topic corresponding to that week. This week the topic is recommending the top ten books based on a particular other book, TV show, movie, etc – for example, if you like this book, you’ll like this other book here. That sort of thing. Feel free to join in and do it on your own blog, just make sure you link back to the blog that started it all (and tell me so I can come and check it out)!\n\nAs you may have guessed, I’m recommending all my books on if you have a fondness for the ridiculous British comedy troupe known as Monty Python. In the 1960s and 1970s Monty Python shot to fame around the world, helping redefine comedy with their surreal brand of humour through 4 TV series (45 episodes in total), 4 movies, a live show, and a bunch of albums. Although Graham Chapman is no longer with us, sadly, the other 5 members have been working on a reunion live show that will be broadcast in cinemas around the world – this show, they have admitted, is also to be a final farewell to the group, most of whom are in their 70s now.\n\nSo it seemed appropriate to me to base my list on Monty Python. If you like Monty Python’s whacky, surreal, intelligent and most of all hilarious comedy, you’ll probably like these books:\n\nThe Murphy by Spike Milligan: Spike Milligan became famous in the 50s as part of The Goon Show, a radio series with the same type of surreal humour that Monty Python became known for. Milligan went on to make sketch shows on television, write a lot of books including several novels and a seven part war memoir, and even write children’s poetry. He was clearly a big influence on Monty Python, so really I could have put any of his books on this list. I chose this one because he published it in 2000, at the age 0f 81, and I loved how funny he still was even as an old man. He attempts to write a lot of the accents through the spelling of words, and that alone makes this short novel a worthy read for Monty Python fans.\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy by Douglas Adams: Douglas Adams openly admitted that Monty Python were a huge influence on him, and it shows in all of his novels. There’s a complete randomness to these stories, courtesy of the fact that he blows up the Earth early in the first book of the series and really makes anything possible. But underneath, there is some intelligent social commentary going on as well. Very funny books by a very funny man.\n\nThe Road To Mars by Eric Idle: Yes, Eric Idle is one of the members of Monty Python, so this book is almost a given for this list. Written a bit over a decade ago, it focuses on a topic he knows well – comedy. The main characters are stand up comedians who travel the galaxy, but the character who most interested me was a robot who didn’t understand the distinctly human concept of humour, and spent his time trying to analyse it to figure out what makes something funny. Very thought provoking while still being as hilarious as you’d expect.\n\nThe Last Girlfriend On Earth by Simon Rich: I’ve only just started reading this book today (my girlfriend is reading it right now while I write this) and I bought it after reading this review on the fabulous blog Books Speak Volumes. Just skimming through it and reading the odd page, I am already finding it hilarious and a lot of it is just totally absurd but in a brilliant way. While Monty Python might not be the first type of humour that this reminds me of, I definitely think fans of one would enjoy the other! Excited to sit down and properly read this later.\n\nPreincarnate by Shaun Micallef: Shaun Micallef is a much loved Australian comedian, and he snuck this little novel out a couple of years ago. I was quite impressed by it, for the plot was very complex and totally ridiculous, revolving around time travel and suspended animation. What made it extra funny, though, was the footnotes that Micallef added that sometimes interrupted the narrative flow on purpose – in much the same way that sketches are interrupted by other sketches in Monty Python. Very funny and one of the most insane novels I have ever read. I’d like to reread this one soon, actually.\n\nCalcium Made Interesting: Sketches, Essays, Letters and Gondolas by Graham Chapman: Graham Chapman was also one of the Monty Python troupe, but sadly he died back in 1989. This book is a collection of essays and other various writings by Graham, all of which is hilarious. Often with these sort of books I tend to skim through looking for the more interesting parts, but this one I quite happily read all of – it was just too good! Some of his best work is in here, I think.\n\nThe Hundred Year Old Man Who Climbed Out Of The Window And Disappeared by Jonas Jonasson: This is one of the most popular Swedish books of recent years both in Sweden (where it was the best-selling novel the year it came out) and around the world, and recently was turned into a film (which is a reason I need to hurry up with my Swedish language learning). Basically about what the title says, a man who on his hundredth birthday decides to jump out the window and run away, and all the crazy things that happen as a result, interspersed with tales from his youth. Another absurd story, I think it’s the surrealism and unlikeliness of it that makes me think of Monty Python.\n\nCatch-22 by Joseph Heller: I know some of you are thinking “what? He’s clutching at straws now!” But I’m not, nor am I including this just because it’s my favourite ever book, so hear me out. Catch-22 was a hilarious book which ultimately served to expose the real lunacy of war through situations and scenarios which seem too absurd to be possible, but which clearly are quite possible and probable (many of which Heller drew from experience). Likewise, Monty Python often tried to expose the lunacy behind a lot of things, from blind belief and religious fanaticism in “Life of Brian” to politics and media in their TV series, Monty Python’s Flying Circus. Besides, both this book and Monty Python reside among my favourite ever things, so, you know. It’s got to mean something, right?\n\nMrs Fry’s Diary by Mrs Stephen Fry: Monty Python had a bit of an obsession with dressing up as women for sketches (as the main six members were men, although they did have women who often worked on their films and shows as extras too), and the results were often hilarious. Stephen Fry, the much loved host of intelligent quiz show QI, documentary person, novel writer and all round word-wizard, sometimes writes as Mrs Stephen Fry, playing his apparent wife as his alter-ego. This book is a year’s worth of diary entries, and it is very rude, crude and absolutely hilarious. Fry really knows how to twist words to get every last bit of humour out of them.\n\nAn Utterly Impartial History of Britain or 2000 Years Of Upper Class Idiots In Charge by John O’Farrell: This last one is my favourite ever history book. So why am I recommending it if you like Monty Python? Because it is also the funniest history book I have ever read, poking fun at just about every bit of Britain’s past over the last couple of millennia. The humour is often quite absurd and more often just downright silly, just like the comedy in both of Monty Python’s single-story films (the other two were sketch compilations) which were set in the past. Unlike those films though, this book is fairly accurate (and obvious when its not). A must-read for comedy fans of any kind, and of course history buffs.\n\nI actually could have come up with a few more books, but this post is long enough already. I’d love to hear from you, Monty Python fan or not, on whether you have read any of these books and what your thoughts are on them or the Pythons!\n\nQuite frankly, I’m surprised it took six of these posts before I finally mentioned one of the Monty Python troupe, but there you go. Better late than never.\n\nAfter achieving success at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and on the television show The Frost Report, John Cleese became a member of Monty Python in the late 1960s – the comedy group who would go on to make four television series and four films all of which changed the world of comedy forever. Each of the members of Monty Python brought something different to the show and films. Cleese had a great ability at juggling both slapstick and more intellectual based humour. The former was added to by the fact that he is quite remarkably tall (the infamous Silly Walks sketch comes to mind here), and he was great at just acting downright silly, such as in this famous clip from Monty Python and the Holy Grail:\n\nBut then, many of his most loved sketches involved both his verbosity and his ability to come across as, well, rather snobby actually. Take for instance this sketch, the merchant banker sketch from the television series of Monty Python, in which he pretends to be a rich banker so caught up in his own wealth he doesn’t understand the concept of donating to charity:\n\nIn the mid 1970s, as the Monty Python group stopped their television series but achieved a greater worldwide success with their films, John Cleese went on to co-create a sitcom with his then wife Connie Booth, called Fawlty Towers – in which he played the constantly angry and bumbling owner of a hotel. His character, Basil Fawlty, is perhaps one of the funniest characters in fictional comedy history, and is supported by a superb cast of other various misfits through the twelve episodes of this show. One of my favourite moments is when a fire breaks out in the hotel and he struggles to cope with the whole situation, descending into total panic and chaos:\n\nIn the 1980s, he starred in a number of films, most notably A Fish Called Wanda. Then sadly, at the end of the decade, fellow Python Graham Chapman passed away, which drew the remaining members of the group back together in mourning. What I have always thought is one of the most wonderful things, however, is the eulogy Cleese gave at Chapman’s funeral – outrageous, but hilarious, and exactly what Chapman would have wanted. Check out this short two minute snippet of it:\n\nOver the last couple of decades John Cleese has appeared in a number of films, including two of the Harry Potter films and three of the Shrek films. He has also taken to the stage again, performing a tour around the world in the last couple of years. I’m going to end this post though with a clip from a film that is often forgotten about – Rat Race. In this film Cleese plays an eccentric billionaire (reminscent of his Python days), who sets up a race between six randomly selected people in his casino to a certain location where a large amount of money is held, entirely for the entertainment of his fellow gambling billionaires who are betting on who will get there first. It’s a little hit and miss, but overall very funny, and I think Cleese is brilliant, especially in this scene where he tries to explain the rules to the contestants:\n\nWhat are your thoughts on John Cleese? Do you find him funny in any of his roles? Any particular favourites?\n\nThis may not come as much of a surprise to many, but I am, and for as long as I remember always have been, an immense fan of Monty Python. As a child I remember watching two of their movies, The Holy Grail and The Meaning of Life, over and over, loving the silliness of The Holy Grail (which to this day is my favourite film) and pretending to get the jokes in The Meaning of Life. As I hit my adult years, I discovered the other Monty Python movies, then discovered the television show they made, Monty Python’s Flying Circus, and quickly digested all forty-five episodes. I even managed to find most of the albums they made (including my favourite, Monty Python’s Contractual Obligation Album, which must be the funniest audio recording of all time).\n\nBut now I had ignited something deep within me, an insatiable hunger for more of this comedic genius. I re-watched John Cleese’s brilliant Fawlty Towers. I discovered the odd comedy Terry Jones and Michael Palin produced around the same time called Ripping Yarns. I watched the television shows the Monty Python crew had starred in before coming together. I watched movies that featured some of the pythons, such as A Fish Called Wanda and Erik The Viking. I even watched all of Michael Palin’s travel documentaries (which I must say were thoroughly enjoyable). With a little room left for dessert, it occurred to me I should look into whether any of them wrote books – in particular if any of them wrote fiction. And it turns out, some of them did.\n\nThe three books I intend to look at are the novels The Road To Mars by Eric Idle, Hemingway’s Chair by Michael Palin, and the non-fiction volume Calcium Made Interesting by Graham Chapman.\n\nThe Road to Mars by Eric Idle\n\nThis bizarre novel is perhaps one of the most thought provoking and insightful books both of and about comedy I have ever read. Set vaguely in the future, it follows the story of two comedians, Muscroft and Ashby, who suddenly find all their gigs along an inter-planetary vaudeville circuit called ‘The Road To Mars’ are cancelled, for no explicable reason. Thrown into the mix are divas, mastermind terrorists, a micropaleontologist (who studies the evolutionary implications of the last ten minutes) as the narrator, and my favourite character, Carlton, a robot who is attempting to decipher the essence of comedy, and why he as a robot doesn’t understand or appreciate it. It is through this last character that the novel seems to split, being partly a hilarious science fiction tale rather similar to the work of Douglas Adams (which is interesting, as Adams had cited the Pythons as being an influence on him), and partly a dissertation on comedy, coming from somebody who frankly is in a position to ponder the art of humour so philosophically. I was pleasantly surprised by this novel, and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of comedy on any level (which surely covers most people).\n\nHemingway’s Chair by Michael Palin\n\nI have mentioned this novel briefly before on my blog, as this was a book I only got around to reading quite recently. It is a very English story, set in a small English village, mostly around a post office (I know, not exactly a setting that bounds with excitement). Martin Sproale is assistant postmaster, and is obsessed with Hemingway, but when he is beaten to the position of postmaster by an outsider, Nick Marshall, who then steals his girlfriend and brings controversial changes to the post office, much to the annoyance of the workers and villagers, Martin soon has to find inspiration to fight back, as his hero would. It sounds inspiring in a sort of humble way, and as I read it I kept expecting it to make me leap up and cheer for Martin, but I just don’t know that it did. The book ended up being a lot stranger than I had anticipated, and when I finished I wasn’t entirely sure what to think. It wasn’t bad, by any means, but it isn’t a book I think I’ll be in a hurry to read again. Having said that, the writing was lovely and very evocative, and there were some funny moments in the story. If you’re a fan of Hemingway, or of Michael Palin, it is definitely worth a read, but it probably isn’t for everyone.\n\nCalcium Made Interesting by Graham Chapman (edited by Jim Yoakum)\n\nThis is an anthology containing, as the front cover states, various “sketches, essays, letters, gondolas”, but also monologues, teleplays, articles both by himself and also by others about him, and much more. Throughout them all, these pieces and fragments reveal the many sides of Chapman, from the anarchist who liked silliness for its own sake, to the man who campaigned tirelessly for gay rights, who became a qualified doctor only to walk away from medicine for comedy, and who became one of the most influential comedians of his time. The book is fascinating, intelligent, but most of all just downright hilarious – from the first page beginning with “This book is dedicated to the following apology” (which is then followed by an apology letter he wrote to a pub), through to the “What you may have missed by skimming through this book” page included at the end. I often found myself laughing to the point of being in pain while reading this, so if you are a Monty Python fan, I absolutely urge you to find this book and read it.\n\nHave you read any of these books before, and if so, what were your opinions? Would you be interested in reading them if you haven’t yet done so? And lastly, are there any comedians you love who have written books you also enjoyed?\n\nConveniently, I have just finished reading a book which disappointed me, which is of course disappointing, but it at least gives me something to talk about for this blog. It is always a strange feeling when you do read a book, which you had a certain amount of expectation for, only to find that it doesn’t quite leave you feeling content. It’s not necessarily a bad book, but just not as good as you would have hoped. It doesn’t happen to me very often, because I try to go into reading books with no expectations, but sometimes it can’t be helped.\n\nIn this particular case, the book which disappointed me a little is Hemingway’s Chair by Michael Palin. Yes, the same Michael Palin from all the travel documentaries, and one of the members of the Monty Python comedy troupe. I have always love the comedy work of Monty Python, and have read books by other members of the group which I loved. I have read Michael Palin’s diaries from the Python years, which I found highly entertaining, and I have also admired his travel work. So you can sort of see why I had my hopes up for this, his only fictional novel.\n\nWritten in the mid 1990s, Hemingway’s Chair tells the story of Martin Sproale, a man in his mid thirties who still lives with his mother, in a small English village, working at a local post office, and growing his obsession with Ernest Hemingway. He is your typically pitiful protagonist who has no confidence, and absolutely no clue, and when he is beaten to the postmaster job by an ambitious outsider, who also steals his girlfriend, he reaches a point in which he must choose between defeat, or fighting for his beliefs, as Hemingway would. It sounds charming, and indeed in many ways is – the writing itself is particularly eloquent and very quintessentially English. But Martin is just too much, too weird, so much so that he isn’t likeable, and what changes do appear in his character during the story just seem bizarre and unlikely. It was one of those books where I read it, got to the end, and as I put it down, thought to myself “what just happened?” Not because I don’t get it, I understood the significance of the ending, and how the story all tied together but…I don’t know. I just didn’t like it as much as I hoped I would. It is a great piece of writing, and it captures a certain kind of Englishness very well, as anybody who has ever lived in a small English village will probably agree, but I just can’t help but think that Michael Palin is capable of so much more, of something much bigger, bolder and more powerful than this.\n\nHave you ever read a book that disappointed you? If so, do you know why it disappointed you?"
