        "text": "The comedian, actor, author, singer, writer and composer of comic songs, lives here. He wrote and performed as a member of the British comedy group \"Monty Python\". He purchased the 4-bed, 4-bath, 5,175 sq ft home in April of 1993 for $1.6M, according to public records. Neighbors are likely to get a dose of laughs living next to this well known comedian.\n\nIdle is best known for his work in the 60’s when he began a project that would known as \"Monty Python\". Him along with Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin, would write zany sketches and outlandish jokes, that would change the face of comedy forever. Idle’s sketches, which he wrote by himself, often included plays on words and dealt with contemporary issues and people, a distinct brand that would make Monty Python the most influential sketch show of its time. Idle wrote many of the group's most popular songs, including \"Look on the Bright Side of Life\" and \"Eric the Half-a-Bee\".\n\nPost-\"Monty Python\", Idle wrote several books, appeared in numerous television shows and films, and toured as a solo artist. Most importantly, he wrote Spamalot, which has won three Tony Awards. In Spamalot's initial run of 1500 performances, it grossed $175 million, and is still often in production.\n\nEric Idle, the well known and respected comedian earned a net worth of $60 Million.\n\nThe actor was in the news recently when, according to several reports, the Los Angeles Fire Department were called to this Hollywood Hills property owned by Idle and his wife, Tania Kosevich, after an unknown powdery substance was found in a piece of mail. The Anthrax scare was thankfully a false alarm, and no one was hurt, but it gave Idle quite the scare. Many fans were concerned about the actors health, but he remains in high spirits.\n\nHomes - Celebrity - Entertainment - Actors\n\nLinks: en.wikipedia.org\n\nBy: tlp333"
