        "text": "Eric Idle, star of stage, screen and crossword puzzle, has often been compared to Noel Coward. But, alas, never favorably. He has been in Show Business since 1961. “Unfortunately, I can’t find the exit” he says. “My role in life seems to be cheering people up,” he adds glumly.\n\nHis new show, Always Look on the Bright Side of Life, Live! is a nostalgic one man musical and contains everything including comedy, music, philosophy and one fart joke.\n\nHis last tour of the West Coast was way back in 2016.\n\nHe has written several novels and plays and he was in several movies but he forgets which. Oh, and he was in Monty Python."
