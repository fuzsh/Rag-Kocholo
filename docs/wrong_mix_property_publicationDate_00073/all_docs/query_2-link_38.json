Working with his friends, Mole attempts to win back his home.\n\nDirected by Terry Jones (Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian), the film has an ensemble cast including Steve Coogan (I’m Alan Partridge, Philomena), Eric Idle (Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Nuns on the Run), John Cleese (Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Fawlty Towers), Stephen Fry (Gosford Park, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows) Bernard Hill (Titanic, The Lord of the Rings) Michael Palin (Monty Python and the Holy Grail, A Fish Called Wanda) and Robert Bathurst (Cold Feet, Emma).\n\nThe production filmed at Dover Castle, which doubled as the Gaol as well as The Old School in Chiddingstone (now the post office) which features as the Welcome Inn where Toad dines before stealing and crashing a motorcar.\n\nDover Castle is a stunning medieval castle situated on the White Cliffs of Dover, overlooking the English Channel. Dover Castle is a popular film location having featured in Into the Woods (2015), Poirot “The Clocks” (2009) and Hamlet (1990).\n\nChiddingstone is a beautiful one-street Tudor village with over 70% of the buildings in more than 200 years old. In 1939, the National Trust bought the village in order to preserve it. The village has previously been used as a film location by productions such as Terry and Mason’s Great Food Trip (2015), A Room With A View (1986) and Elizabeth R (1971).\n\nThe Wind in the Willows – Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride is available to purchase on DVD."
