        "text": "AEG presents Eric Idle: Always Look on the Bright Side of Life, Live! on Wednesday, September 4, 2024 at 7:30 PM. Star of stage, screen and crossword puzzle, Eric has often been compared to Noel Coward. But, alas, never favorably. His new show is a nostalgic one man musical and contains everything including comedy, music, philosophy and one fart joke. He has written several novels and plays, and he was in several movies, but he forgets which. Oh, and he was in Monty Python.\n\nDaily Noozhawk\n\nSubscribe to our free P.M.
