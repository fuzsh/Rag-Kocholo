        "text": "Eric Idle’s Los Angeles home was reportedly evacuated on Monday evening (8 April) after an unknown powder substance was found in the mail.\n\nAccording to NBC4, residents of the Hollywood Hills home – which belongs to the former Monty Python comedian and his wife, Tania Kosevich – called the police after opening a letter from Thailand that released a white powder.\n\nFollowing the call at approximately 6:23 pm, there were police, fire and hazmat units on the scene.\n\nOfficials are treating the incident as an Anthrax scare, though it remains unclear whether the substance was a dangerous bacteria.\n\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department has since said that they have yet to discover hazardous chemicals or power in the envelope.\n\nTwo women were taken to hospital as a precautionary measure, but neither has displayed any symptoms.\n\nIdle is best known for being a member of Monty Python, the comedy troupe behind the TV series Monty Python’s Flying Circus and the acclaimed films Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian, and The Meaning of Life. Kosevich is a former model. The couple have a daughter, Lily."
