        "text": "Business innovation\n\nMedia use has changed dramatically in recent years and continues to change. Digital platforms have drastically increased the variety of available options and new forms of information dissemination are clearly breaking up old patterns of use. The evolution of everyday media usage in German-speaking Switzerland confirms this trend. Across all age groups, the probability of daily use of the Internet is already at 90 per cent. Among the 15-29 year-olds, the daily probability of using the Internet is as high as 96 per cent, while that of print media has fallen to 39 per cent. Considering the countertrend in print media use and the tremendous relevance of digital platforms for young people, it can be assumed that the existing pressure on the newspaper industry will continue to increase. There is surging demand for innovative solutions, with artificial intelligence, VR and AR as well as blockchain continuing to emerge as powerful forces.\n\nAbout three years ago, AI caused a stir in the industry through the introduction of writing robots. These robo-journalists were primarily suitable for the preparation of statistics such as annual accounts, weather data and sport results. In the meantime, though, the topic is on everyone's lips and more in vogue than ever before. Fourteen European news agencies have already introduced semi-automated editorial systems, nine of which use “bots” to research and write articles. The British news agency Press Association has pushed robo-journalism the farthest and today supplies local media throughout the UK with a software routine called “Radar”.\n\nBlockchain is set to play an increasingly dominant role in journalism. It has the potential to grow into a key capability by helping publishers to keep track of content assets, avoid contractual disputes and establish the certainty and accountability that fosters readers’ trust. Civil, a decentralised journalism marketplace from the U.S. is technologically based on the Ethereum blockchain platform. It provides transparency and security for trustworthy and reliable journalism in times of fake news, advertising pressure and manipulative power interests. Anyone can register with Civil as a “newsmaker” or “citizen” and publish or receive content. For the latter, the authors can be remunerated on a voluntary basis in their desired crypto currency or in the form of Civil tokens. The traceability of authorship of the respective content in the blockchain database is another added benefit.\n\nSteemit, a kind of hybrid social network cum content platform, even goes one step further than Civil. The provider uses a rating and credit system for content, whereby the publisher's remuneration depends on the resonance the content receives. Like Civil, Steemit has its own crypto currency, the Steem Token. Authors active on the platform receive compensation in the form of Steem Tokens and so-called Steem Power. Steem Power is designed in such a way that its influence on the platform increases with the increased power. Furthermore, the blockchain technology is interesting in other use cases where intellectual property such as texts, images or videos can be legally documented or traded. The Berlin-based company BigchainDB, for example, has developed a database on a blockchain platform to document and define licensing principles as well as to transfer copyrights. However, even blockchain can hardly prevent pirated copies – but at least it makes dealing with legal issues considerably easier. The innovations and potential associated with blockchain are mind-boggling, especially since they can heighten the credibility and transparency of today’s worrisomely assailable journalism.\n\nThe technological innovations presented below demonstrate the variety of possibilities on digital platforms. Going forward, the difficulty for Swiss newspapers in particular will not only come from the necessity to rely on click-increasing soft news despite the emotion-driven functional logic of social media, but also from insisting on the quality of content. Especially in comparison to the Anglo-Saxon sector, the Swiss press already has a know-how deficit in the digital sector. It is not the processing of basics that is relevant nowadays; rather, it is the courage to innovate.\n\nEqually spoken, advertising revenues for Swiss newspapers are still slightly higher than circulation revenues. Switzerland is in an uncommon position compared to the norm elsewhere in the world, where circulation revenues have already exceeded advertising revenues. In Switzerland, the approximate revenue contributions for 2017 came in at 57 per cent from advertising and 43 per cent from circulation. The decline in advertising revenues, which began in 2012, continued to accelerate in 2017. In total, the daily, regional, weekly and Sunday press generated sales of CHF 692 million. Advertising revenues were 11.6 per cent below the prior-year level. The Sunday press suffered particularly heavy losses, with advertising revenues down 26.1 per cent on the previous year. These extraordinary changes are mainly due to the discontinuation of several titles in the Sunday press and the launch of new weeklies. Last year also showed that the number of paid print titles sold (-14.2 per cent in 2017) significantly underperformed the volume of free titles (-3.5 per cent in 2017).\n\nThe downtrend in print advertising is being offset by increasing sales of digital advertising (5.5 per cent in 2017). However, this increase still falls short of compensating for the decline in sales from the print advertising business. Nonetheless, digital offerings such as programmatic and content advertising are on the advance. The willingness of Tamedia, Ringier and NZZ Mediengruppe to invest more in these forms of advertising show that publishers have not yet written off the advertising market.\n\nIn 2017, for example, Tamedia decided to enter the growth market of digital outdoor advertising by acquiring a majority stake in Neo Advertising. Its takeover of Goldbach Group cements the publisher's efforts to be involved in the promising field of databased advertising in the future. The NZZ Mediengruppe also aims to strengthen its position in the advertising market through alliances, as the positive developments of its digital marketing organisation “Audienzz” illustrate. The Swiss newspapers are not losing heart because of the bleak prospects in the advertising market, but instead are trying to counter this with targeted investments.\n\nCirculation revenues are experiencing less turbulent times than advertising revenues. Overall, circulation revenues declined by 2.9 per cent in 2017, and this trend should continue over the next five years. Digital circulation rose from CHF 20 million to CHF 28 million in 2017 (+40 per cent). In the same period, print circulation decreased by 4.4 per cent. Swiss newspapers are still struggling to compensate the decline in print with growth from digital channels. “20 Minuten”, which now has 1.3 million readers in Switzerland with its online edition, is leading the way by setting a good example. However, the creation of high-quality content while simultaneously having to streamline resources and search for user-friendly and proven payment systems is still a source of concern for publishing houses. Innovative ideas such as the crowdfunding-sponsored and advertising-free magazine Republik from Zurich could gain a foothold in the newspaper industry and force both customers and publishers to rethink.\n\nPrincipal drivers\n\nAdvertising is moving further and further away from journalism\n\nDigitalisation is changing not only media production and distribution, but also the advertising industry. The mechanics of supply and demand have driven prices into the basement, ad fraud is more problematic than ever, and ad blocking is widespread. In addition, the Internet opens up new advertising channels for advertisers, which has led to the decoupling of advertising from journalism. Traditional newspapers are losing readership to new aggregators and search engines, which makes advertising financing increasingly difficult for them. The large technology platforms such as Google and Facebook are garnering the lion's share of today’s digital advertising revenues due to their ability to address the audience efficiently and at scale. Publishers should not only accept this development (albeit with suspicion), but also see the associated opportunities as these platforms are equally dependent on entertaining and informative content. In this respect, Facebook, for example, offers media houses a channel for distributing their content in the form of “instant articles”. Facebook argues that much of this revenue benefits publishers. Other ways to generate advertising revenue are to sell the embedded advertising directly or to use the platform's advertising network. Although the success of this model is still unclear, it is evident that social platforms in particular have an interest in high-quality content from established media companies.\n\nThe resurrection of paid content\n\nAfter years of broadening their paid content offerings, publishers now face the challenge of optimising them. Since subscription revenue in Switzerland will also exceed advertising revenue in the medium term, publishers need to finance more digital content via recipients.\n\nDeclining fixed costs increase the diversity of journalistic supply\n\nWith the elimination of the fixed costs associated with conventional media consumption, the barriers to market entry are also disappearing and freelance journalists are participating in the market. It is important to keep an eye on the increase in dubious content, as the production of such non-verifiable or even deliberately false reports is associated with negligible costs. The bigger relative market size and thus the available supply is also concomitant with increased competition and price pressure for publishers, who often respond to this with product differentiation. For example, the newspaper range is offered in different variations and quality levels, thereby making the range less interchangeable from the customer's point of view and in turn strengthening the market position of the individual producers. From the recipient’s point of view, the growing need for orientation aids must be accommodated due to the increasing variety of offerings. Especially in the Swiss newspaper market, regional or content-related specialisation is becoming more and more common as niche interests with theme-specific publications are gaining in attraction due to falling fixed costs. This is reflected in the increasing focus of Swiss media houses on small markets, a move favoured by the local peculiarities of Switzerland.\n\nThe autonomy of consumers towards advertising is on the rise\n\nThe increasing use of ad-blockers and customer control over personal data release associated with advertising create new obstacles for publishers. A positive aspect of ad-blockers from the customer’s point of view is the performance boost on mobile devices: they considerably reduce the amount of data to be loaded. However, the use of ad-blockers also increases the pressure on publishers, who now need to deliver advertising to users they hardly know are out there. So-called “native advertising” is becoming more and more popular and creates real benefit for users by illuminating topics that are relevant to the products of the advertisers. The art is to package these topics informatively and attractively so the customer does not even recognise the advertising hidden inside. From the publisher’s point of view, however, the question arises as to whether this effect is at all desirable in terms of content quality and objectivity. However, such incentive problems already existed in times of traditional advertising-financed journalism. Companies that generated significant advertising revenue for the publisher may have been treated differently in newspaper articles than companies that were not financial contributors. And finally, more stringent data protection regulations mean that digital providers must now obtain the users' consent for the processing of their personal user data. This could make room for price differentiation, as some people agree to the use of their data and others do not. Those with shared data may be offered lower user prices because their data is applied for advertising purposes and therefore generates additional revenue."
