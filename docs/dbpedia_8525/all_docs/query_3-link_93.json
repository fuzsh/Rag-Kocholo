        "text": "This book tells the story of how doing an 11-minute TED talk changed my perspective of myself and other people, almost got me slammed up in jail, and could have cost me my job.\n\nThe Last Straw\n\nI was coming to the conclusion that no matter where I posted my talk, it would be stifled shortly after. Sensing that my supporters would soon tire of this game of cat and mouse, I decided to try another tactic. As I’ve worked in communications for more than 22 years, I’m used to working with the press. I spoke to a writer for the Basler Zeitung, the main newspaper in Basel, who had become interested in the story by following the updates on LinkedIn. He asked for an interview, which of course I accepted. A couple of weeks later he called me to tell me to watch out for an article on page three the next day. I was thrilled when I read a prominent piece, in German, entitled “So ein Bullshit” (“Such Bullshit!”), giving a light-hearted summation highlighting the ridiculousness of the situation.\n\nOf course I posted a copy of the article on Facebook and LinkedIn.\n\nThe following Monday morning at work, I received a call from my company’s Chief Compliance Officer. If you’ve ever worked in a highly-regulated industry, you’ll know that a call from the Chief Compliance Officer is rarely good news. He wanted to meet me that afternoon.\n\nMy ever-supportive colleague whispered to me from the next desk: “Peter, if I were in your shoes, I’d be shitting my pants right now.”\n\nWhen I walked into the office of the Chief Compliance Officer, he asked: “Peter, you’re probably wondering why I’ve summoned you here”. Before I could answer he exclaimed: “well it’s B.S.”, and slammed a three-inch thick dossier onto the desk, with a copy of page three of the Basler Zeitung staring at me from the top.\n\nHe told me how he’d had a long phone conversation, that morning, with Harrison, who had called him to complain about my behaviour and demanded the company do something about it. He also informed me that Harrison had reported me to the Basel police alleging that I had “offended” him and Jane.\n\nKnowing me relatively well but being unaware of the strong feelings that had been running high on both sides, the Chief Compliance Officer asked if I could sort this out over a gentlemanly drink with Harrison and insisted that I meet with him to try to put an end to the matter, muttering something about having more important issues to deal with.\n\nI duly called Harrison, telling him “it’s time we met”, and so we did a couple of days later in the same place I’d had the fruitless conversation with him the last time. I didn’t offer a drink this time.\n\n“How do you think we can resolve this matter?”, I asked him, as he sat solemn-faced with very little emotion in his eyes.\n\n“What is your goal?”, he asked me in response.\n\n“I just want to draw a line under the whole thing”, I said. “How can we do that?”\n\n“You can stop breaking the law for a start”, he replied.\n\n“And exactly how am I breaking the law?”, I asked.\n\n“You know perfectly well”, he said.\n\n“What I do know is that you have reported me to the police and to my employer. Do you intend taking this any further?”\n\nTo which he replied: “I have no interest in taking this further. I just want you to take down your talk from YouTube, stop posting the video, provide a written apology to Jane for the attack on us, don’t encourage people to contact us over this, and I want your assurance that you will not use your talk in the future without our written permission”.\n\nA week or so earlier, someone unknown to me had acquired and re-posted a copy of my talk on their own YouTube channel. I explained that I hadn’t posted this latest copy so I had no power over that. I also told him that I retain the rights to a speech I wrote and performed.\n\n“You know the parts where Jane and I had input. We have the drafts”, he said menacingly.\n\nThat took me aback. He was claiming rights to a piece of work that was ultimately mine. Indeed he and Jane had provided some input and ideas, but so had many others who had coached me and helped me to shape and rehearse the speech. To claim that he had the rights to my hard work astounded me.\n\nThis time I bit my tongue and quietly wrote down his demands. To me, this was clearly a man who had become obsessed and had started to live in his own story.\n\n“We decide what goes in the speeches and we decide what’s posted. It’s our decision”, he said.\n\nAt this point I thought it best to leave.\n\nI informed my company’s Chief Compliance Officer of our conversation and sent Harrison the following e-mail:\n\nDear Harrison,\n\nThis is to follow up from our meeting yesterday. It's a pity that this whole matter has been blown out of proportion but I am pleased to hear that you have no interest in taking this further with the police or my employer.\n\nFor my part, I will not post the video of my TEDxBasel talk publicly on the internet, nor will I encourage anyone to contact you or Jane about the matter. I wish to offer my heartfelt and sincere apologies to Jane.\n\nMy intention from the beginning has simply been to have my talk posted online by TEDxBasel.\n\nHowever, I do not agree to your demand of me not performing my talk in the future. I retain the right to do that.\n\nAs you said you have no interest in taking this matter further, I would ask you to withdraw the complaint against me that you have lodged with the police within the next five days. Please let me know if you have not been able to do this and I will engage a solicitor accordingly.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPeter Sandbach\n\nI wasn’t expecting a response and none came.\n\nThe Phoenix Rises\n\nYou’ve no doubt gathered by now that I’m not the kind of person who gives up easily when I feel strongly about an injustice. I began racking my brains for ideas of other ways I could get my talk seen. As the anonymously-published video continued picking up views, then at more than 1,700, I knew there must be an appetite for even more.\n\nI remembered that a year or two previously I had met with one of the organisers of nearby TEDxZurich and offered to coach some of her speakers. I looked up the date of the next TEDxZurich event and it was coming up in November! I hastily contacted her, was open in telling her everything that had gone on with TEDxBasel, and asked if I could perform my speech at her upcoming event.\n\nTo my delight, she told me that she had been at the Basel event and seen my speech, telling me that it was the best of the day and she’d be delighted to have me speak at TEDxZurich.\n\nA couple of weeks later she confirmed my speaking slot, sent me the rehearsal schedule, and asked me if I could have the video of my Basel talk removed from YouTube to prevent people finding it when the speaker list was published.\n\nAgainst my instincts but now armed with the knowledge of how to issue a “copyright strike”, the anonymous posting of my talk was quietly removed on my instruction to YouTube.\n\nMy nerves leading up to this event were as great as they’d been for the Basel performance. I knew this time it had to be better, even though TEDxZurich had told me that the exact same speech would be fine. For me, delivery had to be spot on and even more powerful this time.\n\nSo I rehearsed with another of my training groups, with my children, and with my fellow trainers, including Olivia Schofield, who put me through my paces in person. But when I delivered the speech, it didn’t seem to be my speech any longer. It represented so much more than just a ten-minute talk. Whenever the now familiar words fell out of my mouth, “happy birthday”–style, I just felt all the baggage and upset that they had brought. Olivia could feel this too.\n\nIt was then, in a darkened meeting room, after hours, in the tallest building in Switzerland, that Olivia made me deliver the speech with no words.\n\n“Just feel it”, she told me. “Don’t speak it, but I want to see all the emotions you are trying to get across in your talk through your body language and your face”.\n\nIt seemed odd to deliver a ten-minute speech without talking but somehow it worked. I felt the baggage slowly tumble from the 23rd floor.\n\n“Great! Now with the words”, she said.\n\nSo I did. And when I got to the word “bullshit”, I roared it with might, as all the stress and strife of the last few months fell away.\n\nThe following day, in a final panic, I emailed the Chair of TEDxZurich to ask her to confirm that everything was fine from her side, that she was fully aware of the situation with TEDxBasel and still happy to have me as a speaker and publish my talk online after the event. She confirmed in writing that that was the case, as I’d requested. Once bitten and all that.\n\nI booked a hotel room in Zurich for the night before the event and bought a new shirt. One of the things I’d noticed from by Basel performance was that my ample belly was fighting to make its stage appearance too.\n\nNow I was ready for TEDxZurich 2016.\n\nOr so I thought."
