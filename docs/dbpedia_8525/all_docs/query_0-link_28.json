        "text": "Most newspapers in Switzerland do have a long tradition reaching back far into the 19th century. All major Swiss cities and towns had two or even three rivaling local newspapers presenting the views of the major parties in the region: liberals (entrepreneurs), conservatives (craftsmen and farmers) and in industrial centers also socialists (industrial workers).\n\nAfter World War II Switzerland's national public radio and television were forced by political decisions to present balanced and independent news reports and they met this challenge very well. The changes towards a more open and dynamic society common to all western European nations after the 1968 students' protests went exactly in the same direction: people increasingly wanted to get informed instead of being indoctrinated by partisan opinion leaders.\n\nThe partisan print media found themselves confronted with changing expectations as well as with increasing amounts of information to be selected and presented. By the 1980's it had became too expensive to produce so many quality newspapers for such a little market of only 7 million inhabitants. The solution was a concentration process leaving only one quality newspaper per region usually presenting issues from different points of view."
