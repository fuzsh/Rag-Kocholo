In the new edition of our backline blog – brought to you by Novartis – we introduce you to a specialist who is one of the world's best restorers of guitars and developers of electric guitars: Gary Levinson!\n\nMore\n\nFor the past 38 years, the Baloise Session has played host to the world of music. As «Host City» of the renowned festival, Basel itself also boasts a vibrant music culture.

Nowadays, live concerts would be unthinkable without it: the synthesizer. This fascinating musical instrument also plays an important role in jazz, as demonstrated by one of today’s most exciting bands, who will be topping the bill at the Baloise Session on 10 November: Snarky Puppy from the USA. But what actually is a synthesizer? And what makes it such an exciting instrument musically?

In a business still very much dominated by men, they embody a wide range of emotions – from love to anger, from vulnerability to pride.

But how do their voices differ? In the Backline Blog of the Baloise Session, a specialist investigates this question: Tanja Dankner!\n\nMore\n\nIn the first blog post – brought to you by the Basler Kantonalbank – we compare two songs which come from two completely different music scenes and yet are very similar in musical terms.
