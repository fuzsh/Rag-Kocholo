Wondrously imaginative stories that tell the reader how powerfully fresh, at times tongue-in-cheek bold, how breathtakingly pretty and pretty complicated life is.' --taken from the jury rating for the grant of the Neumayer Foundation 2011\n\nWhat does it mean to have a connection with someone?\n\nEveryday you see tens and hundreds of faces and overhear countless conversations. Everyday you pass people by - on the street. In the office. In the car. In cafes and bars. Down the corridors of department stores and hotel rooms. But what makes one person a stranger, and another a friend, an accomplice, even a lover?\n\nA traveller shuts himself up in his hotel room, with no-one but room service to talk to; a teenager stalks her long-lost father; a journalist interviews a great poet with a dark past; a woman pursues a doomed liaison with an anonymous man she meets once a month at the casino; a bar lady locked in with the regulars at night... These are just some of the tales exploring the mysterious and random side of human relationships."
