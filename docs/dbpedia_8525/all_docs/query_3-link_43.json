The Equality and Human Rights Commission states that 'assistance dogs are highly trained' which means they:\n\nWill not wander freely around the premises.\n\nWill sit or lie quietly on the floor next to their owner.\n\nAre unlikely to foul in a public place.\n\nIf a dog does not act along these lines while on-site, it and the user/owner will be requested to leave the Exhibition. All assistance dogs must always remain on the lead.\n\nThe Marvel exhibition offers time slot tickets. You can choose the day and time of arrival at the exhibition. With a flex ticket your month stays as flexible as possible according to your wishes. You just purchase a flex ticket and visit whenever you feel like it within that month.\n\nWith a VIP ticket, you gain entry through the VIP entrance, the fast lane. You will also receive a VIP badge on a Marvel lanyard, a voucher for a free poster at the end of the exhibition and a 10% discount at the merchandise shop on site.\n\nChildren aged 5-9 profit from a special rate, while children aged 10-16 are included in our special discount rate.\n\nThe special discount is also suited for senior citizens (age 65+), students (with show of ID), apprentices up to the age of 27, people in civil or military service, welfare recipients and wheelchair users.\n\nA family of 2 adults and 2 children or 1 adult and 3 children can visit the Marvel exhibition with a family ticket.\n\nWe also offer Group tickets where school classes profit from special rates per person as well as other groups (10 or more people) will profit from special rates suited to them."
