        "text": "Basler Zeitung was founded in 1729 under the name Avis-Blatt, renamed to Basler Nachrichten in 1856 and received its current name in 1976. This originally centre-left newspaper radically changed course after it was taken over in 2010 by the right-wing Swiss financier Tito Tettamanti (75 percent) and the Basel-based media lawyer Martin Wagner (25 percent). In 2018 the newspaper was taken over by the Tamedia Group (now TX Group) from Zurich."
