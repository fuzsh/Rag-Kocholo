        "text": "#canberrawithkids#familytravel#questacon\n\nQuestacon is a science centre, and the best one we have ever visited. There is something for all ages here. The mind-bending, hands-on experiments in the interactive galleries can be experienced at many levels. For young children, just participating in the experiments is fun. A pen which draws on its own? Mirrors which change your appearance? A room that shakes? All pretty cool. Older children and adults will also benefit from learning about the science behind the experiments, making this an ideal educational outing for primary school-aged children.\n\nThe Questacon building’s foyer is creative and inviting, if a little chaotic. There is a lot to appeal to the senses and it is a sign of what you will find in the galleries. The first experiment booths are found on the spiral entrance ramp, so the fun begins even before you reach the galleries! Our favourite activities overall were the tornado tubes, earthquake room, lightning strike and musical instruments. The variety of activities highlights just how big a role science plays in every aspect of our lives.\n\nEntry to Questacon is by timed ticket. Once inside, visitors progress through the galleries in order, but at their own pace. This means that the most fun galleries can feel a bit crowded, while others are almost empty. Long lines form for some of the most appealing activities. We didn’t feel like this ruined our experience, but we did feel that visiting at a less busy time (ie. Not in school holidays) may have allowed our kids to enjoy more of the hands-on activities. You will need to pack your patience if you’d like to do every single experiment yourself, but we found it just as enjoyable and educational to watch others do some activities when the lines were long.\n\nPre-booking tickets is recommended. Tickets are booked through Ticketek. Adult entry is $24.50 and child entry (4-16 years) is $18.90. Various family packages are available, including two-adult, two-child and two-adult, three-child family tickets for $73.40. Families of four, like ours, can purchase one 2+3 family ticket plus an extra child. It’s a fair price for the interactivity and family-friendliness of Questacon. If you’re feeling spontaneous, there is a ticket desk on the ground floor and there is a small saving to buy tickets in-centre (no ticketing fee applies). But some sessions do book out, and having a guaranteed entry time is worth the small fee to book online, in our opinion.\n\nEntry times can be booked to start from 9:00 am and every 15 minutes thereafter. Questacon closes at 5 pm and is open every day except Christmas Day. Metered parking is available on-site, in nearby streets and at the National Library across the road. Questacon is located close to Lake Burley Griffin and within walking distance of parks and paths around the lake, and there is a café on site, for those interested in grabbing a bite to eat while there."
