        "text": "Get out your comfy shoes and get ready to see Canberra in a whole new light.\n\nThe annual Enlighten event starts Friday, 28 February, in the Parliamentary Triangle. If you aren’t living in Australia’s national capital, this might not make sense to you, but if you are here or nearby, this year’s program is looking fantastic.\n\nIt all kicks off with one of my favourite sights. It’s stunning to see six iconic buildings—Parliament House, Old Parliament House, the National Gallery, the National Library, Questacon and the National Portrait Gallery—become architectural canvasses.\n\nEach will have an enormous and ever-changing lightshow splashed on its exterior. There will be animation, interactive finger painting, images from the Gold and the Incas: Lost Worlds of Peru exhibition at the National Gallery, and contemporary artworks.\n\nThe free lightshows run from 8pm to midnight for two weekends—this Saturday and Sunday and the next.\n\nAnd I mentioned the comfy shoes. Believe me, it’s easy—in fact recommended—to walk from display to display because they are close to one another. Parking will be chaotic, so park and walk.\n\nBut festivities aren’t limited to lightshows. There is plenty of other outdoor entertainment—some free and some with admission.\n\nPoor John and I are having a terrible time trying to figure out how we’ll fit everything in. Luckily a program arrived as an insert in our newspaper, so we can spend hours trying to puzzle together a plan. You’ll have to check out the details online.\n\nLook for these. A fire garden at the High Court and a herd of 12-foot-tall puppets—horses to be precise—in John Dunmore Lang Place. Or check out the local and interstate bands, and book a ticket to one of the many performances.\n\nAnd then there’s Priscilla. The lighthearted, colour-splashed and hilarious movie, The Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert, turns 20 this year. There will be a special showing this Friday at the National Film and Sound Archive. Tickets are $40 and include an outdoor showing, a talk about the costumes by the designer and complimentary drink on arrival. If you haven’t seen the movie and you can’t be there, hire it this weekend and join in the laughs. Here’s some background about the movie and costumes (the designers won the Oscar).\n\nNote: The pictures here are from Enlighten 2013. Links to some of 2012’s offerings are here."
