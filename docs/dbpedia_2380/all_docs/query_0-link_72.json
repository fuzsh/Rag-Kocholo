        "text": "Overview\n\nA National Police Certificate (NPC) is a summary of your offender history in Australia. It's sometimes called a national police check.\n\nYou must use the AFP if your request is for Commonwealth or ACT reasons.\n\nYou might need a national police check for things such as:\n\nrecruitment and job applications\n\nvolunteer and not-for-profit positions\n\nworking with children or vulnerable groups\n\nlicensing or registration scheme applications\n\nwork-related checks due to legislation or regulations\n\nAustralian citizenship and permanent residence applications\n\nvisa applications for some countries\n\nworking overseas.\n\nYou will need to state the purpose of the police check on your application. Different purposes might lead to different results, depending on relevant laws.\n\nAnyone can apply for an NPC for their own use. But you cannot apply for an NPC for someone else without their consent.\n\nIf you're younger than 18, you'll need a parent or guardian to co-sign your application. If you cannot do this, contact us.\n\nWhat is included in a police check\n\nWe compare your details, such as name and date of birth, against a central index. We then work out what information to include, subject to laws and current policies.\n\nYour NPC will list 'disclosable court outcomes' released in line with federal, state and territory laws, including the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and the Spent Convictions Act 2000 (ACT).\n\nOur national police check also uses information from all Australian police services to list any:\n\nlocal and interstate criminal and traffic court outcomes\n\noutstanding warrants\n\npending charges, where you have been charged with an offence but have not yet been to court.\n\nDepending on the relevant state or territory legislation, it may not include:\n\nconvictions considered 'spent' under federal or state legislation\n\nguilty findings without conviction.\n\nSome categories of employment or purposes of the check are exempt from any relevant legislation.\n\nWe cannot tell you in advance what may or may not be on your NPC. You'll need to check with the criminal records section of the relevant state or territory police service.\n\nFees and charges\n\nEach NPC application costs $56. If you need to supply fingerprints as part of your application, the total cost is $113.\n\nApplication fees are exempt from GST.\n\nCompany checks\n\nIf you need us to do an NPC on an Australian company, visit Company checks.\n\nBefore you apply\n\nWe use the identity documents you send us to verify your identity. You need to send us identity documents worth at least 100 points in total.\n\nDownload the proof of identity checklist:\n\nFile icon\n\n(pdf, 578.37 KB)\n\nIf you can't meet 100 points, contact us.\n\nYou'll need to scan or photocopy your documents to attach to your application.\n\nYou'll also need to send us details of other names by which you are, or have been, known.\n\nFingerprint checks\n\nSometimes, you’ll need to have a fingerprint check as part of your NPC.\n\nFor example:\n\nsecurity guard licensing\n\nvisa applications through a migration agent in some countries.\n\nIf you live in the ACT, book an appointment by emailing ACTP-Finger-Print-Hotline@afp.gov.au. Make sure you include:\n\nyour full name\n\ncontact phone number (mobile preferred)\n\nlocation preference: City Police Station or Woden Police Station.\n\nPost the original of your fingerprints to us with your completed application. You ‘ll also need to send an official translation if they are in a language other than English.\n\nYou can’t use an online application if you need to include fingerprint checks. You’ll have to apply by post.\n\nWe’ll check your fingerprints against a central database of records. This takes between 15 and 30 business days.\n\nHow to apply\n\nOnline\n\nIf your NPC does not include a fingerprint check, you can\n\nApply online\n\nScan and upload your documents.\n\nCheck your date of birth and other details are correct.\n\nInclude your email address.\n\nPay $56 by credit card.\n\nWe will start processing your application straight away and send you a payment receipt via email. We will send a digital certificate when we have completed the check.\n\nYou can also ask for a hard copy of your certificate. We will post that to you.\n\nBy post\n\nIf you prefer to apply by post, or if you need to include a fingerprint check, print a National Police Check application form [PDF 800KB].\n\nWhen completing the form, remember:\n\nuse black ink\n\nmark boxes with a cross (X)\n\nuse capital letters\n\ncheck all details are correct\n\nsign and date the form.\n\nYou will need to pay in Australian dollars via bank cheque or money order, made out to the Australian Federal Police.\n\nMake sure you include all paperwork, forms, payment and identification with your application. If you need a fingerprint check, include the original of your fingerprints.\n\nYou must send us the form no more than 3 months after you sign it.\n\nIf you do not fill in your application correctly, and include payment and documents, we will not process it.\n\nPost to:\n\nAustralian Federal Police\n\nCriminal Records\n\nLocked Bag 8550\n\nCANBERRA CITY ACT 2601\n\nYou cannot lodge your application at a police station.\n\nMistakes in your application\n\nContact us straight away if you:\n\nmake a mistake in your submitted application\n\nforget to include some details.\n\nIt is up to you to make sure that the check is suitable for the purpose you need it for. Once you have submitted your application, you cannot get a refund.\n\nDo not lodge a new or updated application unless we tell you to.\n\nFalse or misleading information\n\nYou will need to certify that the personal information on your application is correct.\n\nIf we discover that you have given us false or misleading information, you may be prosecuted under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).\n\nAfter you apply\n\nProcessing times\n\nWe complete and post most NPCs within 48 hours of receiving your application.\n\nThis may vary if we need to get information from multiple states or territories.\n\nDigital certificates are sent directly to your email address.\n\nFor hard-copy certificates, allow for postage time. Wait at least 15 business days before contacting us about the status of your check.\n\nName and fingerprint NPCs may take 15 to 30 business days.\n\nWe will send you an email to let you know when we have:\n\nreceived your application\n\nfinalised your application and mailed your certificate.\n\nCheck the status of your NPC\n\nYou can also validate any newly completed checks.\n\nChange of address\n\nIf you change your address before we notify you that your certificate has been posted, please tell us. Otherwise, you can contact Australia Post to redirect your mail.\n\nReceive your certificate\n\nWe will send your:\n\ndigital certificate as a secure PDF to the email on your application\n\nhard copies to the name and postal address on your application.\n\nBoth digital and hard copy certificates have security features.\n\nDigital certificates include a unique QR code you can scan to validate your certificate.\n\nFile icon\n\n(pdf, 572.03 KB)\n\nFile icon\n\n(pdf, 335.78 KB)\n\nWe print hard-copy certificates on paper that includes:\n\na watermark of multiple images of a padlock with 2 keys visible when held up to the light\n\nfluorescent tricolour threads on both sides of the document that glow blue, yellow and red when held under ultraviolet light\n\na border on the right-hand front of the document, printed in microtype, that can be read when viewed under magnification\n\nimages printed in heat-sensitive ink that fade or disappear under moderate heat or friction\n\nhidden images printed in fluorescent ink that glow yellow when viewed under ultraviolet light\n\na screened background printed in solvent-reactive ink.\n\nSee an example hard-copy certificate [PDF 639KB].\n\nDo not rely solely on a photocopied or scanned and emailed certificate. Always ask for an original when you need information to make a decision.\n\nIf you receive a certificate that appears to have been tampered with, please tell us straight away.\n\nCheck the details\n\nWhen you receive your digital or hard copy certificate, check all your personal details.\n\nIf your name or date of birth is wrong, please tell us straight away.\n\nWhere the error was due to incorrect details you entered, you'll need to submit and pay for a new, correct application.\n\nIf we caused the error, we'll process a new application at our expense.\n\nDisputed records\n\nIf you believe any court outcomes on your certificate are incorrect or inaccurate, complete a Disputed Record form.\n\nAttach any extra information or documents supporting your enquiry, such as identification or court documents, to the form to help us assess your application.\n\nWe might need comparison fingerprints to resolve some disputes. We will let you know if this is the case.\n\nValidity of your certificate\n\nYour certificate is valid from the date of your application, but it won't record any court outcomes that occur after that date.\n\nIt's up to the organisation asking for the certificate as to how long they will accept it.\n\nLost certificate\n\nIf you lose your certificate, you can download another from the digital portal for up to 3 months.\n\nIf you need a new hard-copy certificate, you will need to contact us. We will issue reprints for 3 months from the original date. If more time has passed, you will need to submit a new application.\n\nUsing your certificate\n\nThe level of information we release is based on the purpose of the check. This means you can only use your certificate for that purpose.\n\nFor example, a certificate issued for the purpose of 'Aged Care staff/volunteers' is not appropriate for a job needing a certificate for 'Immigration Detention Centre Employment'.\n\nYou may, however, use the certificate more than once for the same purpose.\n\nCriminal record for court\n\nYour NPC is not suitable for use as a criminal record in court proceedings. It only lists disclosable court outcomes and pending charges that may be subject to spent convictions legislation.\n\nSeek independent legal advice if you need your criminal record for court."
