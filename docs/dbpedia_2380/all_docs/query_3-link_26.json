        "text": "The federal department that runs Questacon could be fined up to $1.5m after a child’s hands were allegedly set on fire during a visit to the Canberra museum.\n\nThe nine-year-old was seriously burned after they allegedly touched a hands-on plasma globe exhibit at the National Science and Technology Centre in July 2022.\n\nA Comcare investigation found a spark from the globe ignited the alcohol-based hand sanitiser used by the child, and the Department of Industry, Science and Resources (DISR) has been charged with breaching health and safety laws.\n\nThe sanitiser had been supplied by Questacon and the child suffered burns to their hands and wrists.\n\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\nThe commonwealth director of public prosecutions alleged the department failed in its primary health and safety duty under the Work Health and Safety Act and could have eliminated or minimised risks through measures including removing the globes after discovering the risks of alcohol-based hand sanitiser.\n\nOther potential mitigating measures included limiting the operation of the globes to trained staff, providing adequate warnings and providing a non-alcohol based sanitiser, Comcare said.\n\nThe category 2 criminal offence carries a maximum penalty of $1.5m.\n\nThe DISR said it could not comment on the case as it was before the courts but confirmed the CDPP had commenced proceedings against the department.\n\nQuestacon had removed the plasma ball exhibit and implemented a range of other actions after the incident, the spokesperson said.\n\n“The safety of both visitors and staff at the Centre is of paramount importance to Questacon and we are committed to maintaining Questacon as a safe place for Australians to visit,” they added.\n\nThe matter is listed for a mention at the ACT magistrates court on 12 September."
