        "text": "An Australian Government department has been charged with breaching federal work health and safety laws after a child suffered serious injuries from an exhibit at the National Science and Technology Centre, Questacon.\n\nFollowing a Comcare investigation, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has filed a single charge in the ACT Magistrates Court alleging the Department Industry, Science and Resources (DISR) failed in its duties under the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (WHS Act).\n\nQuestacon is a DISR portfolio agency. The incident happened at the Canberra facility on 23 July 2022.\n\nA nine-year-old child visiting the centre was touching a plasma globe in one of the galleries when their hands caught fire, causing burns to their hands and wrists.\n\nComcareâ€™s investigation found a spark from the plasma globe ignited the alcohol-based hand sanitiser used by the child and supplied by Questacon.\n\nIt is alleged the Department failed in its primary health and safety duty under the WHS Act, and could have eliminated or minimised risks through measures including:\n\nRemoving the plasma globes after discovering the fire risk from alcohol-based hand sanitiser\n\nLimiting the use and operation of the plasma globes to trained Questacon workers\n\nProviding a non-alcohol-based sanitiser or portable soap and water handwashing stations\n\nWarning visitors about spark ignition and the risk of fire.\n\nDISR is charged with a Category 2 criminal offence under the WHS Act, carrying a maximum penalty of $1.5 million.\n\nThe matter is listed for mention in the ACT Magistrates Court on 12 September 2024.\n\nMedia contact"
