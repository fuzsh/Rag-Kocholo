        "text": "Questacon is Australia’s premier science museum with loads of fun interactive exhibits and is located on the southern shore of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra and welcomes over 500 000 visitors annually.\n\nDWP was asked to redesign the cafeteria at Questacon and bring nature inside. A drone was used to capture a local river in the ACT region and to give a bird’s eye perspective of the landscape. Eternal digital printed vinyl from Forbo was chosen as the medium to bring the photography to life. The advanced digital printing technology enables striking floor visuals that cannot be achieved with conventional print techniques. A true bespoke option on a blank canvas is available.\n\nAnne W, designer at DWP:\n\n“It’s lovely to see the care and effort that went into creating the graphic has paid off. Small details like the position of photography to allow shadows in the image to mimic actual aspect is wonderful, it really seems like the sunlight streaming in from outside is creating the long shadows in the graphic… and the colours are vibrant, rich and lush”.\n\n“The graphic floor has completely transformed the space more than I would have credited it with at the beginning of the project. it is like a work of art, but in addition, the emotional response felt while in the space is quite special, I really didn’t think it would have that sort of impact. I can see now, the floor is not just a cosmetic addition, it transcends and humanises the space in a powerful and unique way”"
