        "text": "On June 30 last year, my life was forever changed.\n\nI'd missed an important work deadline, and my friends and family were concerned about my welfare. When they couldn't reach me, they came to my home. They called police after I didn't respond when they knocked on my door.\n\nWith the help of emergency workers, they broke into my apartment and saved my life.\n\nI'd recently arrived home from a trip to Cambodia and Vietnam and I'd been feeling unwell, which I put down to general illness or maybe COVID.\n\nIn fact, as a result of a cut foot, an infection was rapidly taking over my body, resulting in sepsis. I was barely conscious when my friends and family found me.\n\nWhen I was taken to hospital, my lower right leg was amputated below the knee. I also found out I had undiagnosed diabetes.\n\nNow, a year since my amputation, I'm marking my \"stumpiversary\" (as it's sometimes called in the amputee community) and I'm feeling both optimistic and reflective.\n\nHow my life changed after my amputation\n\nEach year over 8,000 people in Australia have some kind of amputation, with varying causes including accidents, cancer, and the combination of infections and diabetes.\n\nMy own experience is similar to that of Clayton, a peer support volunteer with \"Limbs For Life\" who called me during those early days in hospital.\n\nHe described his own life-changing experiences following a walk on the beach, a cut foot and undiagnosed diabetes leading to his own amputation, with significant changes to his personal life and career.\n\nFuelled by powerful pain medication during the early weeks of my hospitalisation, I found it hard to think clearly.\n\nSimple emails and messages of support required multiple readings before I could even attempt a response.\n\nI also had to put modesty concerns aside as nurses helped me with the most basic of human functions.\n\nThe question I kept getting asked by friends and family\n\n\"How are you REALLY?\" was a frequent early question from concerned family, friends, and medical staff.\n\nAt first, their responses to my \"I've had a couple of tough days, but mostly I feel pretty good\" seemed laced with disbelief.\n\nI noticed there were two main ways in which people responded. First, there are those who take my positivity at face value, offering enthusiastic support like, \"You've got this!\"\n\nSecondly, there were others who approached the situation with a different perspective, perhaps wondering if the full weight of what happened might hit me later, once the hospital's comfort and support faded.\n\nThe ups and downs of post-amputation life\n\nIt hasn't escaped me that millions around the world have lost limbs without the privileges I've had living in an affluent country with a top-notch health system.\n\nIn total, I spent close to four months in hospital. Preparing for discharge was always at the forefront of my mind, including whether I could navigate in and out of the apartment independently.\n\nWould I be able to shower independently? And what modifications, if any, might be necessary for me to continue living on my own? Would I always be in a wheelchair, or would my new prosthetic leg allow me to lead a \"normal\" life?\n\nMy good friend Michaela stayed with me on the first night home. Although I went to bed that night feeling fairly good about things, I quickly found myself in tears.\n\n\"The tears are perfectly normal,\" she said. \"Maybe there will be more tears in the future, and likely there will be difficult days.\"\n\nWhat changed when I returned to work\n\nI work at the ABC, and I returned part time in November. At first, it was really hard balancing work with managing my diabetes and the additional demands of an amputation.\n\nI got tired pretty easily. It often felt like I was making twice the effort compared to someone without an amputation.\n\nThe dedicated Wednesday off work for medical appointments and rehabilitation activities like swimming and physiotherapy has been a welcome relief. However, fatigue persists, sometimes forcing me to spend most weekends resting in bed.\n\nMy workplace has been wonderful, and I'm optimistic about returning to full-time work later this year.\n\nThe amputee Facebook group I joined has also been invaluable as a guide. Discussions there shed light on the varied experiences of returning to work.\n\nSome, like a bank employee facing ongoing medical challenges, have struggled for years even with a part-time return. Others, like a remarkable quad amputee, transitioned from part-time to full-time office work.\n\nFor many, the journey back to work is arduous, and for some, it remains unattainable.\n\nThe Facebook group truly helped me understand that everyone's experience is different.\n\nThere's no single answer to the ever-present question for new amputees: \"When can I return to work?\"\n\nReflections from my first year as an amputee\n\nOne year on, I'm aware of how lucky I have been and the support I've received from friends, family and colleagues.\n\nBut this experience has also brought a different perspective and new challenges.\n\nRecently, after heavy rain, the lift in my apartment block stopped working, which meant it was harder for me to get in and out of my apartment.\n\nIn the last year I've achieved a few personal goals, such as taking up some sport and even marching in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.\n\nIn the next few months, I'm hoping to receive approval from the NDIS for a much lighter prosthetic leg, which will hopefully mean even greater flexibility.\n\nJames O'Brien is a planning manager for audio content at the ABC.
