        "text": "Here’s my last piece for Newsroom before the election: https://lnkd.in/g4CC6Bhw (no paywall). It starts off describing a clip that went viral on social media of two people at Avondale Market moving effortlessly between te reo Māori, English, and Mandarin. It reflects growing community understanding of Te Tiriti o Waitangi / the Treaty of Waitangi, te reo Māori, and NZ history - and some politicians want to drag the public back from that. These politicians - including figures from ACT, NZ First, and National - don’t represent a majority of the public when they attempt to do that. But these moves are dangerous, as the last week of anti-Māori sentiment and misogyny on the election campaign shows. We need to name that for what it is. Chris Hipkins gave a strong speech on these worrying trends - but Labour could also do more to talk about Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and why it justifies policy shifts. Time for politicians to catch up with communities.\n\nNew Post: Election ballots and boxes carried across Indonesia by motorcycle, boat, horse and on foot - https://lnkd.in/g4jwdRYv - Iconic white ballot boxes and ballots to let the nearly 205 million eligible voters of Indonesia choose candidates in this Wednesday’s election have been carried across the world's largest archipelago by motorcycle, boat and even horse — as well as on foot. The journey can be tough. The boxes and ballots must sometimes be hand-carried up mountains, across rivers and through villages in the forest to reach a population that is spread out across over 17,000 islands that stretch over 5,000 kilometers (3,000 miles) from east to west. A huge number of boxes and ballots is required for the vote in the world's third largest democracy. Once entering a voting booth, a voter must deal with five ballots at once, choosing one of three pairs of presidential and vice presidential hopefuls, as well as candidates at the national, provincial, regional and city levels. The official vote-counting process is laborious, and may take up to 35 days. But the public can expect numerous early vote count... - #news #business #world -------------------------------------------------- Download: Stupid Simple CMS - https://lnkd.in/g4y9XFgR -------------------------------------------------- or download at SourceForge - https://lnkd.in/gNqB7dnp\n\n🚨𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐝𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐫🚨 𝐈𝐭𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐝𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐲!!😱 🤔𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐝? - Move Forward Party is a reformist party that saw a massive victory in the 2023 elections with great support from the public. - The Constitutional Court in Bangkok has ruled to dissolve this party! - Moreover, its senior leaders have been banned from politics for 10 years! - The US criticized the court and claimed that the move was against democracy!! 🧐𝐖𝐡𝐲? - Thailand’s Article 112 of the Criminal Code criminalises the act of insulting the Thai monarchy with prison time of 3-15 years! - Move Forward party had promised many changes to democratise Thailand, including its promise to reform this ‘lese majeste’ law. - That move won over the public but offended government forces as it prevented the party from taking power. - Moreover, the party was ordered by a court in January this year to drop the reform plan, which it failed, leading to the dissolution ruling yesterday!! 😲𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐲: - Many activists claim that the law was only a political tool to silence critics! - 272 people have been charged under it since July 2020! - According to Amnesty International, this law has been used to criminalise peaceful activism for reform!! ❓𝚆̲𝚊̲𝚜̲ 𝚝̲𝚑̲𝚎̲ 𝚌̲𝚘̲𝚞̲𝚛̲𝚝̲ 𝚛̲𝚞̲𝚕̲𝚒̲𝚗̲𝚐̲ 𝚊̲𝚐̲𝚊̲𝚒̲𝚗̲𝚜̲𝚝̲ 𝚍̲𝚎̲𝚖̲𝚘̲𝚌̲𝚛̲𝚊̲𝚌̲𝚢̲??

Why? 1. Independent candidates (former Deputy Chairman of National Cyber and Crypto Agency & Commissioner General of Police ⭐️⭐️⭐️) illegally used IDs (KTPs) of people without consent but were still passed by the election commission (KPU) 2. Fat coalition \"Koalisi Indonesia Maju Plus/KIM+\" eliminates the existence of a balanced opposition, threatening checks and balances 3. The House of Reps (DPR) is trying to overturn the decision of the Constitutional Court (MK) regarding age limits and thresholds to thwart the opposition and allow the president's third son to run as a candidate for governor/deputy governor in the upcoming regional elections 4. The president's first son has already been elected vice president in the last election and will be inaugurated next October (with the same pattern of circumventing the law) 5. The leadership of one of the major parties (Golongan Karya/Golkar) was torn apart to make things easier for those who tore it apart. The current General Chair was asked to resign several days ago even though the party's internal deliberation schedule will only be held at the end of the year. So if you (experts, donors, granters, development partners, investors, etc.) have access to be heard by those in power, please strengthen the conditionalities for improving Indonesian democracy and governance, as they will be less likely to listen to their people but maybe they will listen when your money talks. 🙏🏼💸 #KawalPutusanMK #SafeguardDemocracy\n\n\"Democracy should never be taken for granted\" Your vote at the #euelections24 matters as EU citizens elect the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) for the next 5 years. The MEPs - represent the 450 million people who live in the #EU. - look at plans for new EU laws. - also change laws to make EU laws better. - and the Council of the EU decide on the EU budget. - check how the EU is working. - vote on trade agreements with countries outside the EU. - elect the President of the European Commission. #ivoted today. #useyourvote\n\nAs always, relevant and practical recommendations from Pak Yanuar Nugroho . The last paragraph is - dare I say - a crucial challenge for Indonesian civil society and academics. A call to action to meet the moment. \"In the longer run, [indonesian civil society's] main strategy should be to consolidate their forces, allowing CSOs, universities, and other elements of the post-1998 reform movement to collectively strategise on how to function as an effective check-and-balance for the government. Any political parties not in Prabowo’s future coalition can ideally act as viable opposition, working with civil society.\"\n\nPakistan's biggest problem is censorship. It always has been and maybe it will stay the same for the foreseeable future. Open Dawn's website and today's page is filled with stories like these, 1. Comedian arrested and released 2. Journalist returns home after four months 3. Govt admits it's tinkering with internet 4. IT minister says reports about throttling the internet are false 5. Businesses and right activists decry internet slowdown This list is not exhaustive. https://www.dawn.com/ Censorship stands in the way of accountability. It derails the system and suffocates people. We cannot have equality, equity and fairness unless we kill the monster that is censorship. Amnesty International Human Rights Commission of Pakistan"
