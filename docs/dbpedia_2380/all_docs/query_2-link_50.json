        "text": "Welcome to another edition of Whatâ€™s Been on Your Calendar?\n\nItâ€™s time for our monthly Whatâ€™s Been on Your Calendar #WBOYC linkup. Iâ€™m also trying to include THRIVE, my Word of the Year, in these posts.\n\nSo letâ€™s get on with it! Iâ€™ve gone with an acrostic style post this month, just to change things up a bit â€“ with some photos of course!\n\nJuly â€“ a good time to get away from winter by heading north\n\nMost of July was spent away from home spending time with family, helping out and having fun with our daughters and grandchildren in Brisbane (Queensland) and Canberra (ACT). We did a lot of driving and had a lot of fun.\n\nBlogging in July\n\nIt was a reasonably good month on the blog but Iâ€™m behind in reading and commenting on other bloggerâ€™s posts and comments on my recent posts â€“ Iâ€™ll catch up eventually!\n\nIncluding this post, Iâ€™ve written 8 posts during July, which isnâ€™t too bad when you consider I was away from home for most of the month!!\n\nAs well as my updates below, Iâ€™ve written about my catchup with co-host Sue here, our trip to Norfolk Island here and here, and some thoughts on life while out cycling.\n\nThriving in July\n\nTrails â€“ we took our ebikes with us while we were away and managed to ride a few trails and cycle paths â€“ surprise, surprise! We rode the trail beside the railway line from Murrumba Downs to Kippa-Ring, then onto the beach at Scarborough and Redcliffe along the Moreton Bay Cycleway. I rode to the gym most days and we had a great ride with our daughter to the beach, with a stop for fish and chips for lunch. We stopped at the Northern Rivers Rail Trail (NRRT) on the way home parking at Burringbar and riding to Murwillumbah and return (approx 38km). We did this rail trail last year and it was much busier this time during school holidays â€“ so good to see people out enjoying the fresh air and I just love the lush rainforest sections we rode through. The next day we rode the newly opened (in March 2024) Casino to Bentley section of the NRRT, (a total of 25km) which was good to see being used by walkers, horse riders, cyclists and groups of families. We drove onto Nambucca Heads for the night and had a spectacular ride around the shared footpaths in the afternoon light. It was so beautiful!\n\nHolidays â€“ although we may be retired teachers and donâ€™t have â€˜holidaysâ€™ anymore (because our whole life is a holiday ðŸ™‚ ), we now have children and grandchildren who are caught up in the school holiday cycle. So it was that we were â€˜invitedâ€™ to help out with our grandson Patrick in Queensland while Eliza (our youngest daughter) was involved a school sports trip to Townsville, for a week. We stayed up there for another week or so and loved our time helping out and having fun with four year old grandson Patrick. Eliza had some time off so we got to do some fun things like seeing The Very Hungry Caterpillar on stage in central Brisbane, going to indoor playcentres, playing in the park and just playing cars/trucks with Patty! Unfortunately they all fell ill so we were in carer mode, cleaning, washing, shopping, and cooking!\n\nEmilia our five year old granddaughter in Canberra, was on school holidays the week after and on our way home we helped out for a few days with visits to the National Museum of Australia, Questacon and playing around the house. She had a friend from school spend the day with us and we all loved our time at Questacon.\n\nRoad Trip â€“ I wrote about our road trip and what we listened to on our drive, in my recent WOYBS post. The trip up was quick, 2 days of constant driving, as we were on a strict timeline but on the way back down the coast we took our time. We used the opportunity to ride some rail trails as mentioned in my T above and stayed in a variety of accommodation. The motel in Casino was absolutely awful and the next night at Nambucca Heads was brilliant (The Beach Rooms) followed by a pretty standard night in a motel in Raymond Terrace. We then had three nights with our daughter in Canberra, and as usual I ended up sharing my bed with Emilia who loves having us stay. Iâ€™ll continue to do this for as long as she wants me to as thereâ€™ll come a time when Granny wonâ€™t be quite as cool!\n\nInformation â€“ this was our familyâ€™s Word a Week prompt for our weekly photo challenge (yes itâ€™s still going on). As we were taking in the views over Nambucca Heads, I read the information board and saw that the area was where our Indigenous family came from so snapped a photo for our weekly photo challenge (see photo below).\n\nVisits â€“ on our way home we dropped in to see an old friend who weâ€™d lost contact with, for various reasons, and hadnâ€™t been in touch with for 15 or so years. Donna and I met on the footpath outside our home in Newcastle when we were both pregnant with our second child, and we discovered we were due at the same time â€“ April/May 1985. We lived three houses apart and our families soon became fast friends with our older daughters close in age and Donna and I the same age (24), Jim and Grant were very similar too and enjoyed each otherâ€™s company.\n\nWe both had second daughters only weeks apart and then when I was pleased to find out I was expecting again in 1988, and mentioned it to Donna, she exclaimed that she too was pregnant again and our third babies were born a week apart â€“ I had a third daughter and Donna had a baby boy. Many of our friends thought weâ€™d planned it all (?) but we were both just as surprised as each other to find out we were expecting at the same time. We did playgroup, picnics, trips to the zoo, babysit each otherâ€™s children and supported each other through lots of things. Donna and her family moved away to a town about an hourâ€™s drive away but we managed to maintain contact. We moved to Tumbarumba in 1991 then to England in 1992 and our first visit when back in Australia was to see Donna, Jim and family and they visited us in Tumbarumba for a trip to the snow in 1993. Over the years we stayed in touch but life took over and after Donna and Jim moved to Melbourne and then Mauritius we lost contact. Last year while we were in England, Donna messaged us out of the blue to let us know that Jim had died suddenly, as weâ€™d been great friends and she thought we should know. This sad event brought us back into contact and it was lovely to sit with Donna and chat for a few hours, catching up on years worth of news. Funnily enough our children are still in touch with Donnaâ€™s children via Facebook and our eldest daughters shared a house during their university days! We were so excited to sit and chat that we didnâ€™t even take a photo! Donna is dealing with her grief in her own way and we were happy to see her looking well and to chat about our times with Jim. Weâ€™ll now stay in touch!\n\nEnergy â€“ itâ€™s so much fun being with our grandchildren. They have an energy that Iâ€™d sort of forgotten. The ups and downs when playing, the way they see the world and the frantic pace they do things! Emilia and I enjoyed a swim before her swimming lesson last week and I wish I had half her energy! Fun is never far from the surface with them all. Zachary (3) is a live wire and is growing up way too fast, having an older sister helps in this Iâ€™m sure. Patrick (4) is learning quickly and has a great sense of humour. We were lucky to have lots of Facetime calls with Dottie (in UK)while we were away and she loves seeing what her cousins are up to.\n\nWhat is THRIVING?\n\nI see THRIVING as an action word, progressing, flourishing, growing, developing, moving forward â€“ Iâ€™m certainly doing my best to THRIVE this year!\n\nI found this quote from Tiny Buddha (on Facebook) and while I know itâ€™s not possible to be excited about every little thing you do, it certainly does help to have some excitement in your life. It makes me happy to be excited about little things as well as the big things. What do you think? I wrote a post about this for #WWWhimsy â€“ Discovering Excitement\n\nJuly 2014\n\nThis week weâ€™ve been looking back to July 2014 when my brother-in-law Cliff suddenly died at aged 56. We canâ€™t quite believe it was that long ago but when you look at whatâ€™s happened in those years itâ€™s a lot. We still grieve for Cliff and now it makes us want to make the most of our lives, as you just never knowâ€¦I wrote this post Shock back then.\n\nWhatâ€™s Been on Your Calendar plus Word of the Year\n\nSue, Donna, Jo and I have set this linkup for the last Friday of the month and the linkup button is below â€“ copy your postâ€™s URL and add it in.
