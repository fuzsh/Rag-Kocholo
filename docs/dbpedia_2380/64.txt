Questacon was officially opened as Australia’s National Science and Technology Centre on 23 November 1988. As part of the Australian Government Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, Questacon takes a leading role in communicating science and technology to people of all ages. Our aim is to excite and motivate through inspirational learning experiences such as hands-on exhibits, science shows and people to people interaction offering high quality engagement. Each year the Centre is visited by about 450,000 people annually, Questacon’s activities are based in Canberra at the Questacon science centre building in the National Parliamentary Zone and the Ian Potter Foundation Technology Learning Centre in Deakin, with outreach programmes extending across Australia working with partners to reach millions of Australians each year.
