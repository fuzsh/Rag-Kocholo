As icon, as mediated personality, and as object of audience fascination and desire, the Hollywood star remains the model for celebrity in modern culture and represents a paradoxical combination of achievement, talent, ability, luck, authenticity, superﬁciality, and ordinariness. In all of the volumes, stardom is studied as an effect of, and inﬂuence on, the particular historical and industrial contexts that enabled a star to be “discovered,” to be featured in ﬁlms, to be promoted and publicized, and ultimately to become a recognizable and admired— even sometimes notorious—feature of the cultural landscape. Understanding when, how, and why a star “makes it,” dazzling for a brief moment or enduring across decades, is especially relevant given the ongoing importance of mediated celebrity in an increasingly visualized world. We hope that our approach produces at least some of the surprises and delight for our readers that stars themselves do. ADRIENNE L.

My aunt and uncle, Pauline G. and Gilbert A.

BARTON PALMER\n\nBy the end of the 1940s, the Hollywood ﬁlm industry had established itself as an integral part of American popular culture through the production, distribution, and exhibition of celluloid entertainment for general national (and international) audiences. Because the value of such releases depended, for obvious reasons, on ﬁlmgoers seeing ﬁlms as unique or innovative, marketing campaigns often emphasized the supposedly pleasurable differences that each “coming attraction” somehow embodied. But Hollywood’s business model also depended heavily on sameness and predictability, qualities as necessary for producers (who needed to be sensitive to economies of scale) as they were for exhibitors (who required a constantly changing supply of ﬁlms of consistently high quality). Crucial to the satisfactory maintenance of a dialectical balance between the absolutely new and the tried and true were a stable system of diverse genres and the contracted availability of established star performers. Hollywood’s balance between sameness and difference ﬁnds a microcosmic reﬂex in what critic Richard Maltby calls the “two bodies” of the star: the perdurable (if existentially varying over time) form of the performer consumed and enjoyed across a series of productions, as well as the transitory incarnation of that same self as a character customarily limited to a single ﬁlm (380–84). Stars, of course, were not all that the industry had to offer the paying public. Over almost three decades, the studio system had developed a ﬂexible approach to providing every ﬁlm with a variety of attractions: compelling narrative; appealing spectacle; and provocative but ultimately conservative themes. The onscreen (and, complexly, also the offscreen) presence of those charismatic, culturally evocative personas called stars had long been crucial to the industry’s continuing proﬁtability. Stars, in fact, were absolutely essential to the very notion of Hollywood. Hollywood produced ﬁlms, but, just as important, also produced itself as a fantasy, extending the glitz, glamour, and charisma it put on the screen to “real life.” The Los Angeles suburb was both a thriving business center and an idealized world of the imagination, a “tinseltown” inhabited by endlessly captivating celebrities whose “private lives” were carefully surveilled and shaped by 1\n\n2\n\nR. BARTON PALMER\n\nstudio publicity machines. And so, in addition to performing onscreen, stars played themselves, constituting the indispensable population of a world continually produced as pleasurable fantasy. It had been so since the 1920s. Much else, however, had changed in America by the beginning of the 1950s. It is true that escapist entertainment of the glamorous Hollywood variety remained popular, especially in the performance-oriented genre of the musical. As this volume establishes, the musical held onto much of its audience through most of the decade (which was also, arguably, the great age of the Broadway musical), but a steep decline had already begun that would accelerate in the 1960s. Escapism, of course, was also available for those who wished it across the spectrum of other postwar Hollywood genres, including westerns (which often retreated into an idealized national past), melodramas (in which life’s vexing personal problems found satisfying solutions), comedies (whose entertainment value often ﬂowed from a riotous anti-realism), and war ﬁlms (which sanitized, anatomized, and celebrated the global victory so recently attained). All the stars discussed in this volume consistently, if not exclusively, worked on projects conceived as what studio heads considered solid entertainment of these kinds.\n\n✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★\n\nLighter and Darker Strains\n\nBut popular taste at the time came also to include a desire for a deeper, more serious, and confrontational engagement with life’s troubles. The wholesale conversion to a wartime economy had posed a serious challenge to traditional social values (and especially gender roles), altering the understanding many had of society and their places in it. The reversion to peacetime occupations for men and women was accompanied by a reassertion of the importance of the traditional family, particularly for the middle class. Among other postwar adjustments, both social and economic, however, this conservative retreat soon uncovered deep dissatisfactions. The retrospective stereotype of the American 1950s is that it was a placid decade marked by untroubled acceptance of collectivism in both economic and personal life, an age of conformity to social norms and lasting loyalty to organizations. But the 1950s were also vexed by public issues that simmered often just beneath an only apparent surface calm, held in check for the most part by a consensus desire for their repression. As demonstrated throughout this volume, sometimes these tensions received eloquent expression in the ﬁlms of the era, an aspect of Hollywood’s cultural importance that was crucially dependent on the richly signifying images of the industry’s stars.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nWhat was new in the postwar period was that there were strident demands at the time, especially from young ﬁlmmakers like Elia Kazan and Stanley Kramer, for a cinema that would be more authentically engaged with what viewers might understand as “real life.” The industry, however, refused for the most part to deal openly and directly with the troubling questions of the day (especially segregation and McCarthyism), though Hollywood did produce a limited number of usually low-budget ﬁlms (only some featuring valuable stars) that dealt with Cold War politics and racial matters. Hollywood’s experience with “A” production social-problem ﬁlms in the late 1940s, including Kazan’s Gentleman’s Agreement (1947) and Pinky (1949), was somewhat disappointing. These critically acclaimed productions were often quite popular (Gentleman’s Agreement was Fox’s highest grossing picture in 1947), but, often wracked by controversy, Hollywood in the 1950s had enough political troubles of its own without looking for many more. For example, at the very beginning of the decade, Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s No Way Out (1950) offered an unforgettable confrontation between a rabid racist (Richard Widmark) and a young black doctor trying to establish himself in a northern urban hospital (Sidney Poitier). The ﬁlm features a disturbingly violent race riot that recalls a similar outbreak of white hostility toward blacks in 1943 Detroit. Poitier went on to build a substantial career during the following two decades, becoming one of Hollywood’s most acclaimed and bankable actors. But there would be no more roles in which he would play a black family man threatened in his home by a pathologically prejudiced white man. Instead, Poitier would be mostly limited to projects that weakly endorsed conventional liberal pieties or only superﬁcially explored racial stereotypes (Go, Man, Go [1954] and Band of Angels [1957] are useful examples). Hollywood simply could not conceive of many proﬁtable ways to utilize him or the few other African Americans who attained something like star status (Harry Belafonte, Dorothy Dandridge, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Eartha Kitt, and Ethel Waters chief among them). In fact, catering to a mostly white clientele to whom “Negroes” were, in Ralph Ellison’s telling formulation, “invisible,” 1950s Hollywood offered few opportunities of any kind for actors of color, beyond their participation in the occasional all-black musical production (Carmen Jones [1954], St. Louis Blues [1958]) or, often playing a servant of some kind, as a supporting dramatic player (for example, the memorable appearance of Waters in such roles in The Member of the Wedding [1952] and The Sound and the Fury [1959]). If the movies of the1950s mostly shied away from the more controversial areas of national and international politics, some of the era’s most notable releases at least launched the celluloid examination of psychological\n\n4\n\nR. BARTON PALMER\n\n“truth,” with more searching dramatizations of the inner life than had previously been brought to the screen. Issues of happiness and identity were treated within the ﬂourishing genre of the family melodrama, in which the discontents of the most personal of relationships found telling, if usually rather traditional, dramatization (Magniﬁcent Obsession [1954], All That Heaven Allows [1955], The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit [1956], and many others). But this character-centered view of human experience found its most culturally signiﬁcant expression not in a single genre, but in the innovative, ultra-naturalistic style of acting known as the Method that, after developing in the New York theater, exerted a considerable inﬂuence on performance (and even the concept of performance itself) in Hollywood during the 1950s. A new generation of Method-trained actors—most notably Dana Andrews, Carroll Baker, Martin Balsam, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, Lee J. Cobb, James Dean, Mildred Dunnock, John Garﬁeld, Julie Harris, Kim Hunter, Karl Malden, E. G. Marshall, Kevin McCarthy, Paul Newman, Gregory Peck, Eva Marie Saint, Rod Steiger, Maureen Stapleton, Jo Van Fleet, Eli Wallach, and David Wayne—rose to prominence and “sought out roles that led to suffering, both emotional and physical,” challenging conventional notions of what constituted entertainment (McCann 6). As several chapters in this volume illustrate, the Method complicated the relationship between the actor’s two bodies by identifying “the actor’s own personality not merely as a model for the creation of character, but as the mine from which all psychological truth must be dug” (Vineberg 6). The Method, to put it somewhat crudely, aimed at transforming performance into “being,” and so the more astute practitioners of this style—Brando, Clift, Dean—often delivered performances that threatened to collapse the distinction between star and character, even as they emphasized an affecting presentation of bitter, sometimes neurotic inwardness that suited the industry’s proﬁtable investment in family melodrama. However, many—perhaps most—Hollywood ﬁlms of the decade did not indulge in such powerful, disturbing anatomies of the self. As Murray Pomerance has pointed out, the big box-ofﬁce successes of the decade were solid entertainment of the kind the studios had been purveying for decades rather than provocative art. Not one of the decade’s biggest earners represents “the work of ﬁlmmakers most critics and scholars now most frequently placed at the pinnacle of ﬁlmmaking at the same time” (5). As America began to enjoy the ﬁrst stages of an unprecedented peacetime prosperity, the studios took care not to offend the more traditionally minded among their audience, continuing to fund and support an industrycreated ofﬁce, the Production Code Administration, which had been founded\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nIn Fear Strikes Out (Robert Mulligan, Paramount, 1957), Anthony Perkins gave an affecting performance as a major league ballplayer driven to mental illness by the relentless perfectionism of his father (Karl Malden). Courtesy of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nin 1934. It was the task of the PCA to vet and shape projects at various stages in their development and production in order to forestall, insofar as possible, legal restrictions (including banning) at municipal and state levels and to satisfy special interest groups, most notably the lay Catholic organization the Legion of Decency (founded in 1933 and arguably enjoying its most vigorous and powerful decade in the 1950s). The legion demanded\n\n6\n\nR. BARTON PALMER\n\nwhat one of its most concerned and articulate members, journalist Martin Quigley, termed “decency in motion pictures,” threatening condemnation and boycotting of, and even protests against, releases that its raters regarded as dangerously immoral, perhaps even an “occasion of sin.” American society began to move unexpectedly to the left on cultural issues during the 1950s, and the ﬁlm industry would in 1968 abandon the Code and institute the current ratings system. In part, this change was provoked by Code-defying directors in the 1950s like Otto Preminger (whose The Moon Is Blue [1953], in which the word “virgin” was uttered for the ﬁrst time in a Hollywood ﬁlm in relation to sexual inexperience, was released without a Code seal and to large box ofﬁce returns, and whose Man with a Golden Arm [1955], even more successful, ignored the Code prohibition against representing drug addiction, providing singer-turned-leading-dramatic-man Frank Sinatra one of his most powerful roles as a junkie attempting to kick the habit). For the most part, however, and despite some stylistic and formal inﬂuence of European movements such as Italian neorealism (especially shooting on location), commercial ﬁlms eagerly promoted an idealized and conservative vision of American society, a collective, representational ideal in which the industry’s gallery of named, recognizable performers played indispensable roles. What made stars the most popular and acclaimed of these recognizable performers is that on one level they customarily (but not always) represented important and appealing or intriguing social types. As the essays collected here show, however, stars, in the words of Richard Dyer, are “always more complex and speciﬁc than types,” which, as it were, only constitute “the ground on which a particular star’s image is constructed” (Stars 68). Stars represent more than an attractive gallery of ideal and idealized versions of ﬁgures familiar from everyday life. In fact, their images are just as often linked to the signiﬁcation of potent contradictions as they are to the incarnation of broadly accepted ideals of looks, manner, and social values.\n\n✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★\n\nA Hollywood Low and the Postwar American High\n\nIn 1946, Hollywood rode a cresting wave in ticket sales, and its many stars never enjoyed greater popularity worldwide. Box ofﬁce receipts hit an all-time high ($325 million) as returning servicemen fueled a dating boom, and consumer goods, which might have competed for the money in very full wage packets, were not yet available in sufﬁcient quantity (see Schatz 353–94 for complete earnings ﬁgures; the ﬁnancial account of Hollywood offered here reﬂects his analysis). Weekly attendance at ﬁlm\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\ntheaters, in fact, almost equaled the nation’s population, at the time close to 140 million. This staggering ﬁgure indicates how important moviegoing had become for the many who must have attended religiously many times a week. Studio proﬁts ran close to $120 million, nearly doubling the record ﬁgure of $60 million set just one year earlier. Gross revenues were an astounding $1.45 billion (also a record), and this success was largely fueled by a string of ﬁve ﬁlms that each earned more than $5 million in domestic rentals, far exceeding even the most optimistic industry expectations. Each of the ﬁlms was in some sense both a genre exercise and stardriven: The Bells of St. Mary’s (1945), a religious melodrama featuring two of the decade’s most popular performers, Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman; Road to Utopia (1945), a musical and the latest in an ongoing franchise of similar “road” movies, starring (again) Crosby, as well as Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour (a trio that by 1945 had become a kind of composite star); The Jolson Story (1946), a musical biopic starring Larry Parks and Evelyn Keyes, two of the most recognizable performers, minor league stars, if you will, from one of the so-called “Little Three” studios, Columbia Pictures; Duel in the Sun, a western starring, among a cast of name performers (Joseph Cotten, Lionel Barrymore, Lillian Gish, and Walter Huston), Gregory Peck and Jennifer Jones, two of the decade’s most acclaimed and popular stars; and The Best Years of Our Lives, a postwar melodrama with three featured stars, Fredric March, Myrna Loy, and Dana Andrews, and a strong supporting cast of experienced name performers (Virginia Mayo, Steve Cochran, Ray Collins, and Hoagy Carmichael). These last two ﬁlms did hint at new directions for the industry, perhaps because they were each projects overseen by one of the era’s most aggressive and successful independent producers. Made by an established industry master, William Wyler, The Best Years of Our Lives seems a precursor of the more serious kind of fare urged on the industry by the likes of Kazan, Kramer, and Nicholas Ray. Dana Andrews’s performance as an ex-ﬂier who experiences great difﬁculty in readjusting to civilian life features a moving “interior” sequence in which the demons that haunt the disillusioned former navigator are exorcised, requiring the small-scale, dialogue-free facial acting in which Method-trained actors specialized. This intense moment of self-discovery, triggered by the outpouring of repressed memories, anticipates similar scenes in a number of famed 1950s productions: James Dean in Rebel without a Cause (1955) and East of Eden (1955); Paul Newman in Somebody Up There Likes Me (1954) and The Left-Handed Gun (1957); Montgomery Clift in A Place in the Sun (1951) and I Confess (1953) as well as Suddenly, Last Summer (1959); Marlon Brando in The Men (1950), A Streetcar\n\n8\n\nR. BARTON PALMER\n\nNamed Desire (1951), and On the Waterfront (1955); Anthony Perkins in Fear Strikes Out and The Tin Star (both 1957), among a number of others. The sensational success enjoyed by Duel in the Sun certainly predicts the shift in audience tastes toward the less Victorian treatment of the sexual life that becomes such a prominent element of 1950s cinema (a trend that would be exploited by a number of stars: especially Elizabeth Taylor in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof [1958] and Suddenly, Last Summer [1959]; and Paul Newman, also in Cat, and in both The Long, Hot Summer [1958] and The Young Philadelphians [1959]). Similarly, Duel arguably breaks new ground in building its narrative around a distinctly antiheroic (if also attractive and somewhat sympathetic) protagonist, a strategy that would soon underlie the proﬁtable notoriety of Marlon Brando’s Stanley Kowalski in Streetcar Named Desire. As a result of Streetcar’s critical and box ofﬁce success, as well as the respect accorded Brando by those in the business, the antiheroic protagonist would become one of the most characteristic ﬁgures of 1950s cinema. The national economy in the early postwar era managed to maintain momentum as wartime production was shifted to satisfying (after creating) consumer demand, inaugurating a decade and a half of unprecedented growth that expanded the middle class and provided most Americans with a lifestyle that was comfortable and even rich beyond the wildest dreams of their parents. As a result, the 1950s were, in the estimation of a prominent historian, William O’Neill, an “American High,” but not, as it turns out, for the ﬁlm industry. The most noteworthy crisis was political: the continuing investigation of purported communist inﬂuence in the industry by the House Un-American Activities Committee in the early years of the decade, which led not only to a bitter, divisive confrontation between right- and left-wing members of the ﬁlmmaking community, but also to the jailing of ten “unfriendly” witnesses and a blacklist that lasted for years, ruining many careers (including that of Larry Parks, the star of The Jolson Story) and polarizing the ﬁlm community, with notable stars lining up on the right (John Wayne, Dick Powell, and James Stewart, for example) and on the left (Humphrey Bogart, Gene Kelly, and Lauren Bacall, among others). More destructive in the long run, however, was the fact that production costs, fueled by rising wages in a time of inﬂation, rose steadily in the postwar era, while earnings fell substantially. By 1950, studio proﬁts were down to about $31 million, only about 25 percent of what they had been in 1946, while, perhaps even more disastrously, the proﬁts of exhibitors had declined about 60 percent, forcing the closing of many theaters. The decline in the ﬁlm business had multiple causes that created something like an economic perfect storm. Income from foreign markets did not\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nmeet expectations (in some countries, like the United Kingdom, Hollywood proﬁts were frozen and could not be exported to the United States, as the British ﬁlm business experienced similar hard times of its own). Because it was an economic as well as a political barrier, the falling of the Iron Curtain (a process completed by 1949) deprived Hollywood of its customary and proﬁtable markets in Eastern Europe. And there was a destructive competition in Los Angeles itself between two rival labor unions. With the eventual victory of the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees (IATSE), some workers received fatter paychecks, but this proved to be no general boon as union employment in the industry fell precipitously because the growing ﬁnancial crisis forced Hollywood to cut production and eliminate the jobs of many contract workers. Such developments by themselves would have posed a serious enough threat to the industry. Even more disastrous, however, was the fact that Hollywood, through large-scale social changes it could not have anticipated and could hardly adjust to quickly, began to lose much of its traditional main market: middle-class urbanites who lived within walking (or public transportation) distance of downtown theaters and were not averse to paying the higher admission prices at these ﬁrst-run venues (which, owned and operated directly by the major ﬁve studios, for two decades had generated a very high proportion of the gross earnings of “A” production releases). A severe inner-city housing shortage hit the country in the immediate postwar years, and the unexpected solution to this problem was quickly found in relatively cheap suburban developments. The building boom beyond city limits was largely fueled by the government loan programs mandated in the G.I. Bill. This profound social change may have been a terriﬁc boon to the nation’s millions of veterans and to the housing industry, but it spelled disaster for Hollywood. Suburban areas were usually far from movie theaters and frequently off public transportation routes, making a trip back into town to see a picture often inconvenient and expensive. Furthermore, the public had become acclimated to “going to the movies,” that is, dropping in at theaters whenever convenient and without regard for feature showtimes. Driving in from the suburbs made this kind of ﬁlmgoing impractical for most. Movie attendance, as a result, became more of an event than a casual activity, requiring greater planning and effort. These trends did not favor the industry during the 1950s, but exhibitors would manage a turnaround of sorts in the 1960s as more theaters became established in the suburbs. To make matters worse, one of the most signiﬁcant developments of the early postwar years was the appearance of a home-centered and (at least\n\n10\n\nR. BARTON PALMER\n\napparently) free substitute for moviegoing. The broadcast services provided by television, and the popularity of the new medium, expanded rapidly. By the end of the 1950s, most families in the country owned a set which they turned on for a gradually increasing number of hours every week. Furthermore, with the establishment of a consumer economy devoted to the production of “durables” and the emergence of entertainment alternatives from boating to bowling, Hollywood’s traditional customers began to spend more of their discretionary income on washing machines, vacation travel, and do-it-yourself projects than on going to the movies. Deserted by their patrons, thousands of theaters around the country closed their doors forever. Some observers thought that America had ﬁnally wearied of the motion picture. For Hollywood’s stars, however, the appearance of television proved more a blessing than a curse. With its emphasis on both live drama (produced in and broadcast from New York) and ﬁlmed series (which were often transplanted from radio), television created an immense demand for trained actors, especially those of proven appeal. Television offered great opportunities for work, even if the pay did not approach what name actors and stars could make in Hollywood. Important stars from the 1940s (Loretta Young [“The Loretta Young Show” (1953)], Dick Powell, David Niven, Ida Lupino, and Charles Boyer [“Four Star Playhouse” (1952)], Jack Benny [“The Jack Benny Program” (1950)], Groucho Marx [“You Bet Your Life” (1950)], Abbott and Costello [“The Abbott and Costello Show” (1952)], Robert Cummings [“The Bob Cummings Show” (1955)], and Robert Young [“Father Knows Best” (1954)], among many others) found renewed career life on the small screen as they sought out additional sources of income, grew too old for leading parts, or otherwise slipped from fashion. Conversely, a number of actors who had found little success in Hollywood discovered in television the path to a stardom that had otherwise eluded them. One of ﬁlm noir’s most effective bit players, Jack Webb, turned producer and transformed one of the Hollywood productions in which he appeared (He Walks by Night [1947]) into a showcase for his acting talents. “Dragnet” became one of 1950s television’s most successful and inﬂuential crime drama series, even enabling Webb to return to feature ﬁlmmaking as star and producer (Pete Kelly’s Blues [1955]). Similarly, Lucille Ball, a comedienne whose talents for slapstick and zany comedy had been wasted during her years as an RKO contract player, developed a television series with her husband, musician and part-time Hollywood actor Desi Arnaz. “I Love Lucy” (1951) enjoyed phenomenal success in its initial run and subsequent, seemingly endless syndication well into the next decade\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nand beyond. Like Webb, Ball also took her newly fashioned persona back to the big screen (The Long, Long Trailer [1953]). Fifties’ Hollywood bit players Lee Marvin, Clint Eastwood, and Steve McQueen would all go on to achieve movie stardom (and more in the case of Eastwood) as a result of their work in anthology television drama and then, taking on starring roles, in popular television series during the 1950s.\n\n✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★\n\nThe Move to the Package-Unit System\n\nThere was a further, though less surprising, blow that the ﬁve major studios (Paramount, Warner Bros., RKO, MGM, and Twentieth Century–Fox) had to endure. For three decades an essential element of the majors’ success had hinged on the vertical integration of their business model, in which production, distribution, and ﬁrst-run theatrical exhibition were organized under one corporate umbrella. After decades of legal wrangling, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1947, in what came to be labeled the “Paramount Decree,” that vertical integration was in restraint of trade and therefore illegal. As a result, the major studios during the next few years were all forced to sign consent decrees that led to their divestiture of theatrical holdings. Without a secure market for their product, the studios could no longer function as “factories” turning out hundreds of ﬁlms annually by methods that were similar to (if always different in important respects from) the industrial assembly line. A gradual shift was made to one-off production (the so-called package-unit system), “a short-term ﬁlm-by-ﬁlm arrangement,” in the words of Janet Staiger, designed to service a market no longer controlled by group rentals. As she relates, producers now were more required to “differentiate the product on the basis of its innovations, its story, stars, and its director” (Staiger 330, 332). One of the results for the industry was that the contract system for those working both above the line (creative personnel) and below (technicians) gradually disappeared. Once again, such a radical change in the approach to production planning, though it posed difﬁculties for the industry, actually strengthened the position of many of Hollywood’s stars, as they became in general even more important than in decades past to the promotion of each ﬁlm’s unique, special appeal. It is no accident that some industry regulars like John Wayne, Cary Grant, Kirk Douglas, and James Stewart took advantage of this freedom from exclusive studio contracts to explore new approaches to their image and screen roles, coming to enjoy either a renewed or a strengthened popularity.\n\n12\n\nR.

On the one hand, Hollywood could outclass the fuzzy black-and-white images and tinny audio then available on the tube. On the other, insofar as public taste and the PCA would allow, the studios could emphasize serious, gritty drama that, while increasingly an important pres-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nence on the Broadway stage of the era, could not in many cases be featured into productions for the small screen. Unlike the broadcast networks, Hollywood was not answerable to either program sponsors or Federal Communications Commission (FCC) protocols. The pressing need for product differentiation led ﬁlmmakers to innovate with two dissimilar kinds of ﬁlms during the 1950s, while never breaking decisively from the “general entertainment” model that had sustained the industry since the 1920s and even earlier. More traditional, even retrograde, in both story and their dependence on glamorous, extravagant spectacle, were the blockbuster Technicolor ﬁlms shot in one of the era’s several innovative widescreen formats. Often remakes of, or closely similar to, the epic spectaculars of late 1920s cinema, these ﬁlms were ﬁlled with stars (often appearing in cameo or restricted roles) and featured elaborate, expensive production values (especially the proverbial “cast of thousands”), and they did not neglect the big-screen appeal of the scantily clad human body, a representational strategy “covered” as it were by the fact that the stories they told were period pieces. The decade’s run of biblical and historical epics, including Quo Vadis (1951), Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954), and The Ten Commandments (1956), treated religious subjects and fully exploited the titillating possibilities of ancient dress (or, at least, Hollywood’s idea of it). Such ﬁlms needed impressive human ﬁgures more than actors and offered opportunities for performers with obvious physical gifts: Yul Brynner, Joan Collins, Victor Mature, Robert Taylor, and preeminently Charlton Heston. The big-budget Technicolor musical also continued as a staple, starring both familiar faces and bodies from earlier decades—Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Bing Crosby, Doris Day, Judy Garland, Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, for example—as well as introducing new stars as disparate as opera tenor Mario Lanza and rock ’n’ roll sensation Elvis Presley. The blockbuster’s “other” was the small-budget black-and-white ﬁlm, whose appeal was hardly what is now termed “eye candy,” but rather an affecting, dramatic, stylistic engagement with arty, politically engaged, or perhaps even adult themes. An amazing trend-setting success in the immediate postwar era, as already mentioned, was achieved with the ﬁlm noir and the social problem drama, two closely connected and sometimes indistinguishable genres that featured not only the thematization of discontents with American society but also the complex intersection of opposed stylistic regimes: expressionism and documentary realism, a mixture found in the Broadway theater of the period as well (and, in ﬁlm, inﬂuenced by the rise of the “art house” cinema, especially European modes such as neorealism and, by the end of the decade, the French New Wave). Such ﬁlms usually\n\n14\n\nR. BARTON PALMER\n\nrequired actors who were tough, urban types, good-bad guys with sophistication and pep. To some degree, the industry’s need in this area was ﬁlled by actors who had made a reputation for such portrayals in the 1930s and 1940s, among them Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, Henry Fonda, Glenn Ford, John Garﬁeld, Sterling Hayden, Van Heﬂin, Arthur Kennedy, Alan Ladd, Fred McMurray, Robert Montgomery, Edmond O’Brien, Vincent Price, Edward G. Robinson, Barry Sullivan, and Richard Widmark. But an emerging generation also found opportunity here: Ernest Borgnine, Marlon Brando, Raymond Burr, Broderick Crawford, Kirk Douglas, Dan Duryea, Farley Granger, William Holden, Burt Lancaster, Robert Mitchum, Jack Palance, Robert Ryan, Rod Steiger, and Eli Wallach, among others. Such productions required actresses of a complementary type to incarnate scheming femmes fatales or hard-bitten women with more than a little experience. Memorable performances of this type during the 1950s were delivered by an interesting mixture of established, even older performers (such as Joan Bennett, Rita Hayworth, Ida Lupino, Barbara Stanwyck, and Claire Trevor) and a younger generation of talented actresses, including Lauren Bacall, Anne Bancroft, Yvonne DeCarlo, Rhonda Fleming, Ava Gardner, Gloria Grahame, Jane Greer, Susan Hayward, Janet Leigh, Marilyn Monroe, Kim Novak, Lizabeth Scott, Jan Sterling, Gene Tierney, Shelley Winters, and Joanne Woodward. The ﬂourishing of ﬁlm noir and the social-problem ﬁlm through the 1950s was certainly unexpected. This production trend was blamed by some for the industry’s continuing precipitous drop in gross earnings. Critic Manny Farber, for example, complained that Hollywood had moved away from the “old ﬂowing naturalistic ﬁlm to embrace ‘mannerist works’ that betrayed the accepted function of the corner theater (an institution itself fast disappearing), that ‘simple mansion of leisure-time art’ ” (in Sklar 89). In any case, the small ﬁlms of the 1950s, including some striking noir productions (Orson Welles’s Touch of Evil [1958]) and deglamorized, gritty dramas like Death of a Salesman (1951), Come Back, Little Sheba (1952), The Rose Tattoo (1955), Patterns (1955), Marty (1955’s Oscar winner for Best Picture), The Rainmaker (1956), A Hatful of Rain (1957), The Three Faces of Eve (1957), 12 Angry Men (1957), The Bachelor Party (1957), The Diary of Anne Frank (1959), and Middle of the Night (1959), were showcases for ostentatiously excellent acting especially, but not exclusively, of the Method type. With the larger sphere of Hollywood production, small ﬁlms constituted collectively something that could arguably be called a “cinema of performance” that decisively affected the conception of screen acting, accelerating a turn toward increased naturalism. Method acting is alive and well in American\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nIn Sunset Blvd. (Billy Wilder, Paramount, 1950), Hollywood took a look at its own history, especially its reliance on star performers.

But in terms of acting culture more broadly considered, the 1950s in Hollywood were much more than a decade that witnessed the ﬁrst real ﬂourishing of a style that would have such lasting inﬂuence. As the essays in this volume illustrate, the period was also characterized by what we might call industrial trends, including the continuation of the traditional concept of the leading man (the handsome, charming, affable actor with a resonant voice who looked better in evening clothes than with his shirt off and who could be readily slotted into different action, dramatic, and comedy roles). Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson, Jack Lemmon, James Mason, Ray Milland, Gregory Peck, Spencer Tracy, and many others who enjoyed starring roles during the era belong to this general type, which is capable, of course, of considerable variation; the notable “pretty boys” of the era— Robert Wagner, Troy Donahue, Hudson, Tab Hunter, and Guy Madison— constitute an interesting and important subgrouping, one that was crucial\n\n16\n\nR. BARTON PALMER\n\nin engaging adolescent and young adult ﬁlmgoers. The postwar era’s rougher version of the leading man, like Kirk Douglas, Charlton Heston, Burt Lancaster, and Robert Mitchum, also were often ﬂexible enough to play in a variety of genres. All the actors on this list appeared in westerns, romances, and comedies. In terms of actresses, the 1950s saw a number of interesting developments. There was the advent of a group of blonde “bombshells” of outsize physical proportions (the female equivalents of John Wayne, Charlton Heston, and Rock Hudson to some degree). These so-called “mammarians” included Jayne Mansﬁeld, Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell, and, in some sense, Judy Holliday and Kim Novak. Traditional leading-lady types, however, also found work and success, often continuing careers begun in the 1940s: Joan Bennett, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland, and Barbara Stanwyck chief among them. Some, notably Susan Hayward, made an impact on 1950s cinema through searing dramatic (rather than strictly romantic or comic) performances. Three of the decade’s most unusual ﬁlms (With a Song in My Heart [1952], I’ll Cry Tomorrow [1955], and I Want to Live! [1958]) featured Hayward as either a performer or a criminal who ﬁnds herself unable to fulﬁll the dream of domestic happiness that 1950s culture suggested women pursue. Other notable stars of the era were sui generis, from Jerry Lewis—partnered for most of the decade with Dean Martin, and whose zaniness was exceptional (though with roots in the work of other ﬁlm comedians like Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, and The Three Stooges)—to Audrey Hepburn’s stylish sophistication. Her popularity testiﬁes, as this volume suggests, to the growing interest during the 1950s in both Europeanness more generally (witness a number of “travelogue” productions staged in Europe such as Roman Holiday [1953], with Hepburn, and To Catch a Thief [1955]) and French fashions in particular (for which Hepburn became a kind of onscreen model). She is one of a number of exotic, sexy European actors and actresses to capture the interest of American ﬁlmgoers in the 1950s, as the successful work in Hollywood of Rossano Brazzi, Gina Lollobrigida, Sophia Loren, Anna Magnani, and Yves Montand demonstrates. Of course, the reading of such images, as Hepburn’s case usefully exempliﬁes, is far from simple. The stars themselves always exceeded the general type to which they in some sense customarily connected. And so their signiﬁcance for Hollywood history can only be explored through in-depth case histories. Star personas, moreover, take shape across a career that molds and shapes—sometimes radically altering—the meaning of their presence, a meaning that is also constructed extratextually (through interviews, fan magazine articles, celebrity experiences, entertainment “news”).\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\nWith in-depth discussions of Fred Astaire, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, Bing Crosby, Doris Day, James Dean, Audrey Hepburn, Charlton Heston, Judy Holliday, Rock Hudson, Gene Kelly, Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin, Jayne Mansﬁeld, James Mason, Marilyn Monroe, Kim Novak, Gregory Peck, Frank Sinatra, and James Stewart, Larger than Life: Film Stars of the 1950s focuses on the most notable stars of the decade, offering a varied and useful survey of acting styles, performance histories, and the construction of star images in what was beyond a doubt one of the richest periods of classical Hollywood ﬁlmmaking. The ﬁfties was a time of change for actors, most notably, perhaps, as the practice of long-term exclusive contracting came to an end, making them increasingly independent. But it was also a time of stability, as box ofﬁce results demonstrated the continuing importance of stars to the ﬁlmgoing public. Careers were lengthened for those who had joined the industry in earlier decades. And new careers continued to be launched. It is clear that the stars of 1950s Hollywood helped ensure that the industry itself, then radically reorganizing its business model in the face of a disastrous downturn and widespread social change, would retain its prominence in American culture. As the 1950s opened, the studio system might have found itself in devastating crisis, but its stars, enjoying an outsized popularity that suited the decade’s growing fascination with widened screens ﬁlled with spectacular images, were still proﬁtably “larger than life.”\n\n1 ★★★★★★★★★★ ✩✩✩✩✩✩✩✩✩✩ Montgomery Clift Hollywood Pseudohomosexual TISON PUGH AND BARRY SANDLER\n\nOne of the silver screen’s foremost leading men in the 1950s, Montgomery Clift inspired devotion from his female fans, the vast majority of whom little suspected his homosexuality. Surprisingly, during an era that seemed to exult in conformity and repression, he made little effort to conceal it within the intimate conﬁnes of the Hollywood community. Clift’s close friends and family knew of his queer sexuality, though some were quick to modify it. In an interview with biographer Patricia Bosworth, Clift’s brother Brooks describes his brother’s sexuality: “Monty was a bisexual . . . I met two girls he got pregnant. He was never exclusively one thing or the other; he swung back and forth. Because we’d been raised in Courtesy of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 18\n\nMONTGOMERY CLIFT\n\n19\n\nEurope where homosexuality was more or less accepted, he never felt ashamed—until much later when he grew up” (Bosworth 67). Director Herb Machiz ascribes the anguish of Clift’s personal life to his sexuality: “The real tragedy in most homosexual lives and for a person as sensitive as Monty was having to accept the tremendous disappointment of never ﬁnding a mate worthy of him” (Bosworth 254). In the closeted world of 1950s Hollywood, however, as well as the outside world, Clift’s sexuality could not be openly addressed, despite his abstention from marriage. At the same time, between homosexuality and heterosexuality are various shades of gray, and Clift’s characters in his ﬁlm oeuvre—strong yet sensitive, with a saturnine sensuality simmering just beneath the surface— frequently exhibit a type of masculine sexuality that one might call pseudohomosexuality. This term suggests the ways in which some men fail to convincingly embody normative sexuality and display characteristics that cast them with gendered suspicion. Barbara Ehrenreich outlines the ways in which marriage deﬁned a man’s sexual normativity in the 1950s: The average age of marriage for men in the late ﬁfties was twenty-three, and according to popular wisdom, if a men held out much longer, say even to twenty-seven, “you had to wonder.” . . . By the 1950s and ’60s psychiatry had developed a massive weight of theory establishing that marriage—and, within that, the breadwinner role—was the only normal state for the adult male. Outside lay only a range of diagnoses, all unﬂattering. (Ehrenreich 14–15; see also 16–28)1\n\nFalling somewhere between the poles of heterosexuality and homosexuality, such pseudohomosexual men as bachelors, priests, wimps, and, of course, closeted homosexuals could become marked with queerness despite their attempted performances of normative sexuality. Queer male stars such as Anthony Perkins, Rock Hudson, Farley Granger, and Montgomery Clift frequently exhibit pseudohomosexual masculinities as part of their star personas. Whether in Perkins’s murderous maternal obsession in Psycho (1960), in Granger’s homoerotic relationship with his fellow killer in Rope (1948), or in Hudson’s tongue-in-cheek romp as a straight man playing gay to win Doris Day’s affections in Pillow Talk (1959), pseudohomosexual screen personas often obliquely reﬂect the sexuality of the actor playing the role. For Clift, pseudohomosexuality explains much of his enigmatic appeal as a leading man, in that his dazzling good looks and magnetism drew audiences in, yet his fans rarely saw him in the role of a successful heterosexual romantic lead, and in the few cases they did, he invariably met a tragic or unfulﬁlled end. Whether arbitrary or by design, Clift’s roles conveyed the image of men self-contained and unobtainable.\n\n20\n\nTISON PUGH AND BARRY SANDLER\n\nWithin the restrictive cultural context of 1950s cinema, such roles in traditionally feminine and masculine ﬁlm genres (from melodramas to westerns and war movies) deploy the enigmatic coding of the pseudohomosexual to create a man of mystery for audience consumption.\n\n✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★\n\nHollywood, Homosexuality, and the 1950s\n\nA culture with a signiﬁcant homosexual population, Hollywood in the 1940s and 1950s faced the paradox of relying on queer talent to make ﬁlms that could not openly depict homosexuality. As a result, queerness was often coded into ﬁlms, simply through the subjective sensibility of the ﬁlmmakers, with those creative forces cloaking its actual content (see Russo). For example, Farley Granger describes how the sexuality of the lead characters in Rope was treated as an open secret: “We knew that they were gay, yeah sure. I mean, nobody said anything about it. This was 1947—let’s not forget that. [The homosexuality of the characters] was one of the points of the ﬁlm, in a way.” Arthur Laurents, the ﬁlm’s gay screenwriter, comments further on its queer themes: “I don’t think the censors at that time realized that [Rope] was about gay people. They didn’t have a clue what was and what wasn’t. That’s how it got by” (Celluloid Closet DVD). Although much of Hollywood blinded itself to homosexuality, queer themes nonetheless appear with relative frequency in ﬁlms of the 1940s and 1950s, and in terms of casting, queer actors like Granger were often picked to play pseudohomosexual roles. Public attitudes about homosexuality in the 1950s wavered between confusion and intolerance, although some notable medical iconoclasts attempted to enlighten and encourage acceptance. Alfred Kinsey’s publications, including Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953), revolutionized social views of sexuality, especially in regard to his theories of a continuum of human sexuality, with heterosexuality and homosexuality as opposite ends of a spectrum. Kinsey’s research underscored a potential for latent bisexuality in just about everyone. Sigmund Freud, whom Clift portrayed in John Huston’s wan 1962 ﬁlm biography, died in 1939, but his inﬂuence on debates regarding sexuality continued in the decades after his death, especially with the 1951 American publication of his 1935 letter to a distraught mother in which he wrote, “Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classiﬁed as an illness” (Freud 786). In terms of social change, many queer GIs returning from World War II relocated to large cities and formed gay communities and organizations. In\n\nMONTGOMERY CLIFT\n\n21\n\nthe early 1950s, the gay rights group known as the Mattachine Society was founded. These ﬂedgling steps for queer emancipation were accompanied by increased paranoia and suspicion about homosexuals, notably in the House Un-American Activities Committee and Joseph McCarthy’s witchhunting Permanent Senate Subcommittee on Investigations (see Rizzo). With homosexuality gaining wider exposure but with acceptance still long delayed, surrounding social tensions often focused on whether a given man was or was not homosexual, and thus the effects of pseudohomosexuality might threaten the identity of even the straightest of men. For example, Norman Mailer, writing in the 1950s for the gay magazine One, confronts the fear of his own latent homosexuality: “There is probably no sensitive heterosexual alive who is not preoccupied at one time or another with his latent homosexuality, and while I had no conscious homosexual desires, I had wondered more than once if really there were not something suspicious in my intense dislike of homosexuals” (qtd. in Ehrenreich 129). In 1950s America, where conformity was a seal of social acceptance, the Red Scare was at its height, McCarthyism and political witch hunts destroyed lives, and ﬁlms such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) exploited dread of the enemy within, pseudohomosexuality played on the persistent fear of an internal invasion by the Other. In regard to Clift, the popular press continually addressed the questionable nature of his sexuality in articles about him, pondering his life as a bachelor, his potential girlfriends, and his famed reticence about discussing his personal life. The titles of many of these articles—including Photoplay’s “What’s It’s Like to Date Monty Clift?” (Tricia Hurst, July 1949), “Tall, Dark, and Different” (Elsa Maxwell, September 1949), “Montgomery Clift’s Tragic Love” (Jane Corwin, May 1954), “Forget the Mystery, Meet the Man—Monty Clift” (George Kingsley, December 1954), and “Hollywood’s Most Shocking Rumor” (Cameron Shipp, August 1958)—play upon the public’s fascination with Clift’s romantic life, as well as the possibility of his secrets. In an article in the Saturday Evening Post entitled “Hollywood’s New Dreamboat,” Stanley Frank pokes fun at Clift’s masculinity, calling him a “marshmallow delight” and observing that the actor “does not generate sparks of broad-shouldered virility from a torso pegged to a twenty-nine-inch waist.” Frank also describes how Hollywood press agents created a story about Clift as a world-class skier, ostensibly to project a persona of athletic masculinity: “The attempt to build him up into an outdoorsy he-man drew a loud snicker from Clift. ‘I’m just learning to ski,’ he said. ‘I lower the tone of every hill I go on’ ” (27 August 1949, 109). This account, possibly apocryphal, nonetheless hints at studio concern regarding\n\n22\n\nTISON PUGH AND BARRY SANDLER\n\nClift’s masculinity and the actor’s self-deprecating response to such fabricated machismo. Key phrases and terms that obliquely connote queerness frequently appear in these articles. In a story in McCall’s called “Montgomery Clift . . . Strange Young Man” (January 1957), Eleanor Harris quotes one of Clift’s friends, who says that the actor “suffers from a Narcissus complex” (32), and his twin sister recalls that he was “very sensitive even as a child” (70). These descriptions of narcissism and “sensitivity” tacitly adumbrate homosexuality, in that such terms have long been stereotypically applied to gay men. Indeed, in Barbara Long’s obituary in Vogue magazine (“The Winner Who Lost: Montgomery Clift,” 15 November 1966, 70–74, 86), Clift’s sexuality is anatomized by an anonymous friend: He attracted masochists, and he himself was a sado-masochist. . . . Actually he was almost pre-sexual, and his sex fantasies were so completely psyched out we wouldn’t have seen the sex in them. I always thought whenever he embraced a friend, male or female, that he was really reaching out for that oceanic thing that newborn babies have with their mothers. Whatever his problem, whatever the root of it was, we’ll never know, but he never got past infantilism. (74)\n\nThis pop-psychology analysis proposes numerous diagnoses of Clift’s sexuality, uniting in a vision of him as an infantile bisexual yet somehow asexual sado-masochist. As a whole, this exegesis dances around the truth of Clift’s sexuality, yet never quite touches it. Furthermore, that this friend is anonymous suggests at least the possibility that the speaker was homosexual, and possibly one of Clift’s lovers. Long does not describe her source in any detail, but she later mentions that two of the guests at Clift’s funeral were from Cherry Grove on Fire Island, a town known as a gay mecca (see Newton). Clift was famously reticent about discussing his love life, which subsequently fanned the ﬂames of gossip around him. For example, Jane Corwin notes in “Montgomery Clift’s Tragic Love” that “on the subject of girls, Monty remained skittish with interviewers” and then resignedly comments: “Customarily, however, Monty diverted questions about rumored romances by speaking, instead, of his work.” Elsa Maxwell’s “Tall, Dark, and Different” opens with this teaser hinting at Clift’s pseudohomosexuality in his wily escapes from a hypothetical female: “She served him coffee—he disappeared into the kitchen! She mentioned movies—he plunged into politics! She said goodbye—he left in the service elevator! Which isn’t surprising— she was entertaining Clift!” (38). This miniature melodrama illustrates the difﬁculty for women in nabbing a pseudohomosexual boyfriend. Maxwell\n\nMONTGOMERY CLIFT\n\n23\n\nalso rationalizes Clift’s lackluster love life: “I did not, although it shames me as a reporter, ask him about his girlfriends. He does not take kindly to personal, prying questions. . . . Where Monty is concerned, though, I can think of no girl who would understand his personality or his philosophy” (86). For the popular press of the 1950s, Clift was both sexual due to his incredibly good looks yet asexual in that he refused to divulge amatory fodder for interviewers. George Kingsley offers this homogenizing, if somewhat infantilizing, interpretation of the star’s sexual appeal in “Forget the Mystery, Meet the Man—Monty Clift”: “[his] sadness is one of the qualities that makes him so enormously attractive to female moviegoers. It seems to arouse their maternal instincts” (92). Clift is seen as the perfect child, and one of the deﬁning features of children is their culturally presumed asexuality. In terms of his personal life, Clift obviously struggled with the need to cloak his homosexuality within the more accepted cultural coding of pseudohomosexuality. For her biography of Clift, Patricia Bosworth interviewed one of Clift’s former girlfriends, Phyllis Thaxter, who describes the asexual innocence of their relationship: “Monty and I loved each other very much, but it was a romantic kind of love—I never went to bed with him. . . . But we ﬁnally thought—well, maybe we should marry. It seemed like a good idea.” Bosworth then recounts the scene of their breakup: “Then one afternoon while she was still living at the Clifts, Monty sat [Thaxter] down and said, ‘I’ve been thinking about it, darling, and I can’t get married. It just wouldn’t be right.’ ” Thaxter then continues: “He seemed so serious and a little sad, as if he knew something I didn’t. I didn’t ask questions; I just said all right and we never mentioned marriage after that” (73). It is not difﬁcult to read the queer subtext of this scene, as it tells the familiar story of a gay man and a straight woman, in which the man’s secret desires subvert any hope of marital fulﬁllment. In the closeted world of the 1950s, society demanded that homosexuals perform pseudohomosexuality, yet at times these performances could only go so far. Pseudohomosexuality protects yet constrains, and these tensions are similarly evident in Clift’s ﬁlms.\n\n✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★\n\nMontgomery Clift’s Pseudohomosexual Melodramas\n\nMuch of Clift’s appeal as an actor stems from his beauty; as Richard Dyer remarks, echoing a sentiment shared by many of his fans, “When I see Montgomery Clift I sigh over how beautiful he is” (Stars 162). Largely due to his good looks, Clift makes an ideal lead for ﬁlms intended for a female audience. Primarily known as “tearjerkers” and “women’s\n\n24\n\nTISON PUGH AND BARRY SANDLER\n\nmovies,” melodramas typically focus on feminine perspectives and heightened emotionalism. Robert Lang argues that the melodrama is foremost “a drama of identity” that addresses the protagonist’s autonomy: A woman (or a woman’s point of view) often dominates the narrative of the family melodrama because individual identity within the patriarchal context—always deﬁned by a masculine standard—is problematic for women. The dominant ideology asserts that, whether or not a woman is at the center of the narrative, what is at stake in the melodrama will be a question of identity—of a failure to be masculine, or a failure to accept the repressive, subjectivity-denying terms of patriarchal femininity. (Lang 8)\n\nMany of Clift’s melodramas, including A Place in the Sun (1951), I Confess (1953), Indiscretion of an American Wife/Stazione Termini (1954), Raintree County (1957), and Suddenly, Last Summer (1959), focus on (or at least include) this issue of female identity formation. Notably, Clift’s characters in Indiscretion of an American Wife and Suddenly, Last Summer play secondary roles to the female characters in distress—respectively, Jennifer Jones’s Mary Forbes and Elizabeth Taylor’s Catherine Holly. Clift undeniably plays the lead in A Place in the Sun, I Confess, and Raintree County, but his characters in these ﬁlms are highly emasculated from patriarchal authority and take on a feminized cast. Each of these melodramas, whether with Clift in the lead or secondary to a female lead, features him as somehow incarnating a form of pseudohomosexuality. In A Place in the Sun, Clift’s pseudohomosexual persona coincides with the ﬁlm’s focus both on the role of the outsider trying to ﬁt into a social order he does not belong in and on the ideological constraints placed on working-class sexuality. When George Eastman (Clift) joins the manufacturing ﬁrm of his wealthy uncle, his cousin Earl (Keefe Brasselle) warns him, “There’s a company rule against any of us mixing socially with the girls who work here. My father asked me to particularly call this to your attention. That is a must.” Despite the fact that the ﬁrm manufactures women’s swimsuits—in effect, manufacturing heterosexual desire for women—George is trapped in a “look but don’t touch” world. Sexual desire is monitored throughout the ﬁlm: the police send George and his girlfriend Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters) home when they are caught necking in a car, and Alice worries that her neighbors will learn of their affair. “Mrs. Roberts is right next door,” she whimpers before melting in George’s arms. Despite the carnal nature of his relationship with Alice, George’s sexual development appears arrested in other scenes. During a phone conversation with his mother, she admonishes him to behave: “I know you’ll be a good son.” The seductive Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor) then teases him for his\n\nMONTGOMERY CLIFT\n\n25\n\nemasculation: “Did you promise to be a good boy—not to waste your time on girls?” When George and Angela’s love ﬁnally ignites, it seems real and alive, the most natural of Clift’s screen romances. This is due less to his gift as an actor to manufacture it than to his lifelong platonic friendship offscreen with Elizabeth Taylor, with whom he shared honesty and affection, feeling no pressure to perform. This comfort with Taylor sustained and vitalized Clift as her romantic co-star in two additional ﬁlms, Raintree County and Suddenly, Last Summer, and brought a depth and credibility to their onscreen relationships that fortiﬁed his allure and allowed him to perpetuate the pseudohomosexual persona in a viable context. A Place in the Sun tells the story of a socially marginalized man attempting to assert his position in industry and concomitantly to establish his masculinity, but it is apparent from early in the ﬁlm that Clift’s Eastman is the feminized object rather than the masculine agent. Laura Mulvey’s famous assessment of the gendered dynamics of gazing—“Pleasure in looking has been split between active/male and passive/female” (Mulvey, “Visual Pleasure” 162)—is overturned in this melodrama, with Clift serving as the feminized object of the gaze. When he ﬁrst walks into the swimsuit factory, he is greeted by a wolf whistle; when Angela meets him while he enjoys a solitary game of pool, he offers to let her play, but she purrs demurely back, “Oh no, I’ll just watch you.” Gazing at him from behind, she then queries, “Do I make you nervous?” George replies succinctly, “Yes.” Angela is quite literally in the driver’s seat of their relationship, picking him up and chauffeuring him in her car, and George readily complies. Such images of weakness are ﬁxed on him throughout the ﬁlm, as his sense of reason is continually subverted by his physical urges and visions of grandeur. The tragic irony for George, replicating, albeit in class rather than sexual terms the irony for Clift in reality, is that the ideal life with the perfect woman is, alas, unobtainable, and this awareness lends sadness and depth to both the character and performance. At ﬁlm’s end, George’s desperate attempts to establish himself as a man culminate in his being convicted and executed for Alice’s accidental death, and Clift’s pseudohomosexuality merges with the character’s inability to rise from working-class to upper-class man. Both economically and sexually, George is doomed to disappointment and then death. Alfred Hitchcock’s I Confess merges murder with melodrama, but with the identity of the murderer known from the ﬁlm’s beginning, its melodramatic core takes prominence. The heart of the ﬁlm is encapsulated in a question voiced by potential cuckold Pierre Grandfort (Roger Dann): “What does one do when one’s wife is in love with a priest?” Pierre’s wife Ruth\n\n26\n\nTISON PUGH AND BARRY SANDLER\n\n(Anne Baxter) still loves Father Michael Logan (Clift), despite his vow of celibacy. In an emotionally charged confrontation, she tries to win him back: Ruth: Are you afraid of me? Why? Why? You’re in love with me. You’ve always been in love with me. You haven’t changed. Logan: Ruth, I’ve changed. You’ve changed, too. Ruth: You want me to pretend. Logan: No, I don’t want you to pretend. Ruth, do you understand, I chose to be what I am. I believe in what I am. I want you to see things as they are, not go on hurting yourself.\n\nThe queer potential in this scene arises in Logan’s preference for nonprocreative celibacy over heterosexual passion, his refusal to pretend, and his declaration of self-acceptance. He could have easily spoken the same dialogue in a scene admitting his homosexuality to her, and the conviction with which Logan speaks it may well have been heightened by Clift’s awareness of this, giving the scene a deeper layer of honesty. Logan’s devotion to God must trump his love for Ruth, but again we see Clift’s onscreen persona melding well with a character whose sexuality is somehow suspect. Ruth blames the war for Logan’s metamorphosis from boyfriend to priest—“I didn’t want to hear about the war, but the war had changed him.” On the surface, her words suggest that Logan found God amid the horrors of war, but they also capture the disorienting effects of World War II on human sexuality, in which many gay men moved to metropolises after their military service ended to free themselves of the strictures of small-town life. Rather than suggesting a facile subtext of a priest hiding his true identity behind a clerical collar to avoid sexual engagement, social interaction, and self-confrontation, the transition from lover to priest depicted in I Confess parallels that postwar transition out of the closet for many queer soldiers who left behind bafﬂed girlfriends when they moved to urban areas and staked out queer identities and communities (see also Pomerance, Eye 170–213). Clift’s charisma and looks made him an ideal romantic lead, yet his character in Indiscretion of an American Wife, Giovanni Doria, incarnates a suspect and brutish masculinity that is ultimately rendered ridiculous because he cannot compete sexually with a child. Despite being lured by the chance to work with legendary Italian director Vittorio De Sica, Clift clearly was miscast in the part and knew it—his discomfort seems obvious throughout. This somewhat wooden performance stands in stark contrast to his work with Elizabeth Taylor, who provided a comfort zone, and it is most evident in his scenes with Jennifer Jones, with whom he shares little onscreen chemistry. Doria jokingly assumes a masculinity rife with\n\nMONTGOMERY CLIFT\n\n27\n\nmachismo in a conversation with his lover, Jones’s Mary Forbes, telling her that he would beat her: “I’m an Italian, too. If you didn’t behave yourself, I’d beat you.” Mary laughs in response, but then wonders if his words are true: “You wouldn’t. Would you?” When Doria subsequently hits her, Mary’s nephew Paul (Dick [Richard] Beymer) is disgusted with him for striking his beloved aunt and utters with contempt, “Hitting a woman . . . I’d show him.” This ﬁlm reconﬁgures the classic erotic triangle, in which two men pursue and compete for the love of one woman, but in this instance the struggle is enacted by a man and an adolescent boy. (Given that Truman Capote wrote the dialogue for Indiscretion of an American Wife, this theme is perhaps not surprising, since pre-adolescent sexuality is a recurring theme in his oeuvre, including his novels [Other Voices, Other Rooms, for example] and screenplays [The Innocents (1961)]). The sexual undertones between Mary and Paul are magniﬁed when he kisses her for promising that he can visit her in America: with a bitten apple in his hand— the classic symbol of sexual knowledge dating back to Adam and Eve—Paul is perhaps an ineffective suitor for Mary, yet his presence highlights Doria’s own unsuitability for the position. Clift is only marginally taller than Beymer, and thus his physical presence does not overwhelm his competitor, despite his advantage in years. In the end, Mary chooses to return to her children—her daughter and her husband, whom she describes as a child—and Giovanni loses her as she escapes the unappealing violence apparently inherent in adult sexuality. Suddenly, Last Summer, with a screenplay by gay writers Gore Vidal and Tennessee Williams, is in many ways the queerest entry in Clift’s oeuvre. In this Southern-gothic melodrama, Clift plays Dr. Cukrowicz, a lobotomist who must determine whether to operate on patient Catherine Holly (Elizabeth Taylor) at the instigation of her wealthy aunt, Violet Venable (Katharine Hepburn). Holly was traumatized after she witnessed her homosexual cousin Sebastian being devoured alive by cannibals, and his mother, Violet, is determined to preserve Holly’s idealized memory of him by erasing her recollection of the sordid events. Violet will pay any price to accomplish this, even if it means lobotomizing her niece, an offer Cukrowicz’s supervisors at their ﬁnancially strapped hospital ﬁnd hard to turn down. Once again, Clift’s pseudohomosexual qualities make him appropriate for his role, as Cukrowicz in many ways serves as Sebastian’s surrogate in the ﬁlm. Upon meeting Cukrowicz, Venable effeminizes the handsome doctor, calling him “Dr. Sugar,” and she recognizes his similarity to Sebastian: “Such extraordinary eyes—so like him.” Venable continues to notice likenesses between the two men:\n\n28\n\nTISON PUGH AND BARRY SANDLER\n\nVenable: You’re very like him, Doctor. Cukrowicz: In what way? Venable: Because you, a doctor, a surgeon, are dedicated to your art.\n\nThe two men are ostensibly linked through their artistic professions, since Sebastian was a poet who lived his life as a work of art. Holly later reveals that Sebastian used his mother and her to ﬁnd men for him (“We procured for him . . . We both made contacts for him!”), and in this earlier scene between Cukrowicz and Venable, the viewer sees that the mother still seeks new conquests for her son, despite his death: “You would have liked Sebastian, and he would have been charmed by you.” Suddenly, Last Summer examines both the moral dilemma faced by Cukrowicz in deciding Holly’s fate and the struggle for his soul between the desperate, mercenary Venable and the wounded, vulnerable Holly. With Cukrowicz caught in the middle, he at times seems reduced to a cowering pawn in this battle of two ﬁercely dynamic women (and actresses). The central male ﬁgure here is subjugated to a conﬂicted position inherent in the material itself but underscored by Clift’s onscreen passivity, which seems more pronounced than usual. That sense of weakness owing to a self-conscious awareness of disguised sexuality was here compounded by the actor’s own insecurity in appearing onscreen as a romantic lead with two legendary beauties, while still bearing the disﬁguring, conﬁdence-shattering scars from a serious automobile accident two years earlier. Despite the homosexual subtext at its core, Suddenly, Last Summer is ostensibly a heterosexual melodramatic romance between Cukrowicz and Holly. Paired with Taylor once again, Clift could rely on the affection and comfort in their offscreen friendship to help him offset anxiety in the role and make Cukrowicz’s feelings for Holly seem genuine, if perhaps more empathetic than passionate. Further counterbalancing the actor’s seeming quiescence and buttressing the believability of the Cukrowicz-Holly relationship and Holly’s attraction to him is the fact that Clift played an establishment symbol of achievement and stability. These qualities in the character intrigue Holly, who lacks and craves both; at the same time they obfuscate the actor’s insecurity. Holly kisses Cukrowicz upon meeting him, and he calls this a “friendly kiss.” Despite the strictures of their doctor/patient relationship, romance blossoms, and before Holly’s climactic breakthrough, in which she is cured of her illness by remembering—and thus being able to come to terms with—the details of Sebastian’s gruesome murder, she begs Cukrowicz, “Hold me—I’ve been so lonely,” and they passionately embrace. Indeed, the ﬁnal shots of the movie depict the two lovers walking off together. This hetero-\n\nMONTGOMERY CLIFT\n\n29\n\nPictured here in the Tennessee Williams gothic melodrama Suddenly, Last Summer (Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Columbia, 1959), Montgomery Clift did his best screen work as a romantic lead when paired with his close friend Elizabeth Taylor. Courtesy of MovieStarNews.\n\nsexual romance, however, is complicated by Cukrowicz’s assumption of the position of Violet Venable’s new “Sebastian.” As much as the ﬁnal shots establish the romantic pairing of Holly and Cukrowicz, the penultimate sequence highlights that Violet, taking onto herself the madness of which Holly has been cured, delusionally mistakes Cukrowicz for Sebastian: “Oh, Sebastian. What a lovely summer it’s been. Just the two of us. Sebastian and\n\n30\n\nTISON PUGH AND BARRY SANDLER\n\nViolet. Violet and Sebastian. That’s the way it’s always going to be.” As she ascends to her room in her rococo elevator, she continues, “Oh, we are lucky, my darling. To have one another and need no one else ever.” The vision of Cukrowicz replacing Sebastian and serving as the mollycoddled yet arrogant son of the venerable southern matriarch relies on Clift’s pseudohomosexual attributes, particularly those eyes that Violet believes link him to Sebastian and that Holly found so seductively blue. By foregrounding female desire and the quest for identity beyond the constraints of patriarchal society, melodramas question social constructions of gender. Clift’s pseudohomosexual characters contribute to the gendered politics of these ﬁlms, creating a space to question prevailing standards of masculine identity. Even in Clift’s melodramas that do not particularly play on his pseudohomosexuality, he is still cast as the outsider to the typical value system of society. In the Civil War epic Raintree County (1957), he plays an artistic and intelligent man, Yankee abolitionist John Wickliff Shawnessy, who sets himself apart from his community through his scholarly and creative traits. He is torn between two women—his saintly blonde, down-to-earth childhood sweetheart Nell Gaither (Eva Marie Saint) and the dark, dazzling, demented southern belle Susanna Drake (Elizabeth Taylor). Shawnessy wins the hands of both women but is mesmerized by the mysterious aura surrounding Susanna and resolves to discover her secrets—with tragic results. Clift’s offscreen friendship and chemistry with Taylor again prevails, giving dimension and credibility to their onscreen pairing to sustain his status as a romantic lead. However, a case can be made here for a pseudohomosexual subtext inherent in the character’s intrigue with dangerous, forbidden love. Shawnessy’s willingness to be lured away from the bland, unsatisfying normalcy of a stable, conventional relationship with Nell and into the exciting, perilous, erotically charged instability of life with Susanna to fulﬁll his passion, whatever the risk, reﬂects a similar conﬂict and desire in homosexual men. In the end, similar conﬂicts in Shawnessy’s physical desire and his pull to the dark side nearly ruin him; Susanna’s world proves untenable and following her inevitable demise he returns to the safe, wholesome security of Nell—a victory for convention and a paean to 1950s America.\n\n✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★\n\nMontgomery Clift’s Pseudohomosexuality in Masculine Genres\n\nClift’s roles in melodramas evince a masculinity mirroring his own that is often tentative and conﬂicted, and in many of his other roles, pseudohomosexual edges similarly color the contours of predomi-\n\nMONTGOMERY CLIFT\n\n31\n\nnantly heterosexual characters. He appeared in numerous westerns and war movies, genres that typically feature hypermasculine heroes, yet in such ﬁlms as From Here to Eternity (1953), The Young Lions (1958), and Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), his characters display a preference for homosocial companionship, an inability to win the women they love, or some other pseudohomosexual tendency to forgo heterosexual attachment. In one such example, his widely acclaimed performance in Judgment at Nuremberg, a Holocaust drama of searing impact, Clift plays Rudolph Petersen, a witness for the prosecution testifying about his sterilization at the hands of the Nazis, who deemed him intellectually limited. Clift’s own sense of isolation and social disengagement, his fear of being marginalized and persecuted for his sexuality, clearly connected him to the character of a lonely, devastated Jew victimized by the Nazis. It helped him understand the character in much the same way it did his tormented romantic leads in melodramas, giving weight and realism to his performance. In this ﬁlm, Clift creates an image of profound anguish, and while his time onscreen is brief, it is memorable. Clift’s melodramas frequently depict him as feminized, vulnerable, and/or emasculated, and it might appear that war movies would offer him the opportunity to play more classically masculine roles. But in From Here to Eternity, men are more committed to the homosocial environment of the army than to their respective heterosexual liaisons. Private Prewitt (Clift) and Sergeant Warden (Burt Lancaster) both sacriﬁce the women in their lives—Alma Burke (Donna Reed) and Karen Holmes (Deborah Kerr)—to honor their commitments to their fellow enlisted men. In Karen Holmes’s parting words to Warden, she realizes that he is “already married . . . to the army,” and the homosocial foundations of the army are equated to the marital bonds between husband and wife. Indeed, except for the iconic romantic scene between Lancaster and Kerr depicting their liaison on the beach, the most touching moment of intimacy in the ﬁlm occurs between Warden and Prewitt, when they drunkenly discuss their problems in love while Warden gently strokes Prewitt’s hair. Clift’s own role in life as an outsider helped deﬁne and enrich the Prewitt character. Prewitt is ostensibly an individualist, one who refuses to march in lockstep with the other men, and this refusal is depicted quite literally when he must be trained to march in time with the others. Captain Dana Holmes (Philip Ober) observes that Prewitt has a “reputation as a lone wolf” and that such an ethos will not be supported in his current environment: “In the army, it’s not the individual that counts.” Prewitt embraces his individualism, justifying his refusal to join the regiment’s boxing corps by declaring that “a man don’t go his own way is nothing.” Adhering to his\n\n32\n\nTISON PUGH AND BARRY SANDLER\n\nClift played a soldier with a strong sense of personal honor in Fred Zinnemann’s From Here to Eternity (Columbia, 1953). Courtesy of MovieStarNews.\n\ncredo entails his refusal to ﬁght, but he tells Alma that he will ﬁght for her, ostensibly privileging heterosexual passion over a solipsistic sense of ethics. Surprisingly, then, Prewitt does not ﬁght to advance his relationship with Alma, proving his devotion to her in a public display of machismo; instead, he engages in a knife-ﬁght with “Fatso” Judson (Ernest Borgnine) to avenge his brutal treatment of Private Maggio (Frank Sinatra). The ﬁght\n\nMONTGOMERY CLIFT\n\n33\n\nitself is quite phallic, with Prewitt taunting Fatso that he will attack him with his own weapon: “See this knife? It’s the one you pulled on Maggio.” When Prewitt later dies, Warden eulogizes over his body, declaring, “He loved the army more than any soldier I ever knew,” and this individualist who bucked the system throughout the movie is thus revealed to be the man truest to the values that the system itself ignored. The queerness of homosociality in From Here to Eternity is of a different valence than the queerness of Clift’s melodramas, yet even in this war ﬁlm his onscreen persona does not fully mesh with heteronormative masculinity. In The Young Lions, Clift plays the role of Noah Ackerman, a Jew in the U.S. Army at the start of World War II, and hence a constant target of persecution and ridicule. Clift could relate to Ackerman based on his own history as a homosexual and outsider and channel his own pain, confusion, and fear into the character, bringing to the role even greater humanity and truth. This worked particularly well in conveying an awkward, self-conscious anxiety in his romantic involvement with Hope Plowman (Hope Lange), a gentile woman whose world is initially foreign to him. Clift’s own unease with women as a homosexual informs Ackerman’s unease with this woman from a separate socioreligious background. In some ways, Ackerman resembles Prewitt of From Here to Eternity in that both men ﬁnd themselves at odds with the dominant ethos of the military. For instance, Ackerman’s fellow soldiers deride his masculinity: “Here comes momma’s helper.” Ackerman determines to prove his manhood by ﬁghting the four men who stole twenty dollars from him, only to suffer a series of bloody beatings. Before entering the army, Ackerman’s masculinity is somewhat suspect because he is sexually naïve. He encounters Michael Whiteacre (Dean Martin) at the draft board and the two men become friends; when they leave the building, Whiteacre notices two young women appraising them. He sees their interest as proof of his sexual virility: “Sometimes I think I give off a scent or something—you know, arouses the female.” When Ackerman responds confusedly, Whiteacre impugns his masculinity, declaring, “Your antenna’s turned off” and taunting, “You’re sick.” He bluntly asks: “You ever had a girl?” The ensuing dialogue reinforces the view of Ackerman as sexually innocent in contrast to Whiteacre’s experience with the opposite sex: Ackerman: Have I ever had a girl? Whiteacre (dismissively): That’s what I thought.\n\nAckerman soon begins courting Hope Plowman, and his innocence almost cripples their romance. Ironically, he assumes a somewhat more macho persona and tries to steal a kiss, to which she angrily responds:\n\n34\n\nTISON PUGH AND BARRY SANDLER\n\nHope: I suppose you think that you’re such an attractive young man that any girl would just fall all over herself to let you kiss her . . . Ackerman (moans sotto voce): Oh, God . . . Hope: Never in all my days have I met such an opinionated, self-centered young man. Good night, Mr. Ackerman.\n\nAckerman then confesses to Plowman that his masculine derring-do was merely a façade: “I was afraid that if I was myself you wouldn’t look at me twice.” Plowman ﬁnds Ackerman’s muted masculinity one of his most appealing features, stating to her father: “He’s gentle, and he’s clever. He’s not just a man, he’s a boy.” Plowman’s words tie in with Kingsley’s assessment of Clift’s appeal as an actor in arousing maternal instincts in his female audience, and the cinematic and popular-press constructions of Clift’s pseudohomosexuality here dovetail. Ackerman and Plowman become engaged, win the approval of Plowman’s father, and marry. Despite the character’s initial innocence, Ackerman in The Young Lions is one of Clift’s more heterosexually successful roles. Indeed, he is compared to Whiteacre several times in the movie, and he is generally understood to be the braver and, hence, better man. Whiteacre’s girlfriend, Margaret Freemantle (Barbara Rush), is disappointed in her suitor’s cowardice: “I want you to act like a man. I want to be proud of you—the way Hope is proud of Noah.” Whiteacre admits his cowardice openly; he freely admits his hesitation to join a war for the purpose of being shot at. In the end, the two men spur each other to masculine accomplishment, in that Whiteacre overcomes his cowardice and Ackerman returns to his family. This conclusion gives Clift the chance to play a rare role in his oeuvre: a father. By the end of the 1950s, Montgomery Clift’s now scarred good looks were fading, his internal conﬂicts and subsequent indulgences in alcohol and drugs were taking their toll on him both physically and mentally, and several ﬁlms in which he had recently starred (Lonelyhearts [1958], Wild River [1960]) were commercial failures, thus relegating him to supporting roles. This blow to his stature and conﬁdence was undoubtedly painful, but that pain permeated and shaped his onscreen persona and weathered appearance, giving these supporting characters enormous vulnerability and complexity. In addition, it fueled Clift’s onscreen chemistry and made it electric. In The Misﬁts (1961), he and Marilyn Monroe were kindred spirits in that they were wounded, lost, and insecure; they were celebrated and ridiculed, adored and scorned, and ultimately dehumanized by years of objectiﬁcation and role playing while searching for some stability, some\n\nMONTGOMERY CLIFT\n\n35\n\nIn The Big Lift, Clift (here pictured with co-star Paul Douglas) played an American airman aiding in the struggle against the Russian blockade of West Berlin (George Seaton, Twentieth Century–Fox, 1950). Courtesy of Twentieth Century–Fox.\n\nsense of self. They clearly saw that in each other, and the connection was undeniable, turning their onscreen characters practically into extensions of themselves and giving their scenes together an honesty and raw power that make them at once both heartbreaking and transcendent. Had Clift not succumbed to his drug habit and died in 1966 from occlusive coronary artery disease (Bosworth 370), his next picture was to have been Reﬂections in a Golden Eye (1967), the ﬁlm adaptation of Carson McCullers’s 1941 psychosexual novel. Clift was to play Major Weldon Penderton (the role taken over by Marlon Brando), opposite Elizabeth Taylor as his ﬂamboyant, oversexed wife. This part would have given Clift the opportunity to play a homosexual, albeit a closeted member of the army, in a ﬁlm that thematically endorses homosexuality by condemning uniformity. As Penderton, he would have defended those who resist social norms: “It’s morally honorable for the square peg to keep scraping in a round hole rather than to discover and to use the unorthodox one that would ﬁt it.” The blatant symbolism of these lines—in which the traditional “square peg in a round hole” cliché becomes replete with sexual and sodomitical meanings—argues forcefully for appreciating sexual diversity. Penderton’s words also celebrate the homosocial community of the army: “There’s much to be said about the life of men among men.” The possibility that Clift would have played Penderton points to the ways in which his onscreen pseudohomosexual persona, after years of channeling his own internal conﬂict and sexual confusion into his ﬁctional characters, was merging with his real-life identity as a gay man. An actor’s onscreen persona is merely an illusion, yet it is an illusion that nonetheless can speak important truths. The delicate alchemy of casting the right actor in the right part cannot be distilled into a science, but the real-life conﬂicts of an actor that are human and recognizable can indeed be harnessed and imbued in the character being played, even when\n\n36\n\nTISON PUGH AND BARRY SANDLER\n\ncamouﬂaged, to make that character more honest and credible, as is clearly evident in Clift’s work. The pseudohomosexuality of the 1950s informs and reﬂects the ﬂuid gendered dynamics of so many of Clift’s roles, and, in so doing, deﬁnes his enduring place in ﬁlm history. N OT E S 1.

BARTON PALMER\n\nConsider the following two stories about ﬁlm acting that involve two of 1950s Hollywood’s most popular male stars: Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck. Working with veteran director George Marshall on one of his ﬁrst westerns, The Savage (1952), Heston was uncertain about how to play a short scene. According to the script, he was to ride his horse close to the camera, dismount, and utter a single, and apparently simple, line of dialogue. The young actor, so Heston reported years later, worried that the line did not suit his character, and he proposed a substantial revision. Courtesy of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 37\n\n38\n\nR. BARTON PALMER\n\nMarshall listened with apparent understanding and sympathy to what turned out to be a lengthy and complex pleading, then turned to the earnest neophyte and said: “Look, kid, in this business, the most important thing is not whether you act, but can you ride a horse to your mark.” Marshall interpreted, correctly it seems, Heston’s concern with character and interiority as signs of an enthusiasm for the so-called Method, an acting style then a common preoccupation of aspiring actors, especially those who, like Heston, had done their apprentice work on Broadway and in live television. The director closed their discussion with this sardonic comment: “In this shot, that’s your motivation; just hit the damn mark. Ok?” Writing his autobiography, Heston saw this exchange as a deﬁning career moment. “I got the message,” he writes, “I hit the mark. Acting is partly a question of focus” (Heston, Arena 119). He had learned that screen acting was (at least in the ﬁrst place) not feeling, but action, that is, doing what he was told with enough precision that the camera could capture the image the director desired. He had also absorbed the lesson that a successful career in Hollywood might depend on taking orders—and no pointless back talk or discussion. After his brief and unproductive “creative” dispute with Marshall, Heston would become a loyal organization man during his entire Hollywood career. It turns out that Gregory Peck had a similar encounter a few years earlier with a veteran director that he also remembered long afterward, if a bit less fondly. Like Heston, Peck had moved to screen work from the stage. And for years after becoming a substantial star, in fact, he continued to think of himself as a serious (that is, stage) actor, working when his ﬁlm schedule permitted with the La Jolla Playhouse in his hometown near San Diego, which he had founded with fellow actors Mel Ferrer and Dorothy McGuire in 1947. Intent on honing his skills in classical repertory and current productions, he too had become attracted to the Method, undertaking training with one of its less orthodox but very popular masters, Sanford Meisner. Heston never studied with Meisner and in his autobiography never speaks about training or workshopping with any of the Method’s famous gurus. Yet, so pervasive was the inﬂuence of this brand of naturalistic acting that, while ﬁlming The Savage, he had adopted the form of preparation that is perhaps most characteristic of Meisner’s approach. The famous teacher believed that actors should build a performance by discovering the inner truth of their character, which they could then project, rather than by consciously designing movements and inﬂections. Dialogue should reﬂect that inner truth; if it did not, then it should be altered in order to achieve a greater sense of truthfulness. In this theory of preparation, identifying the motivation (object, intent, desire, etc.) of the character\n\nCHARLTON HESTON AND GREGORY PECK\n\n39\n\nat different moments in the narrative was crucial. It was this process that Marshall had rejected so decisively when directing Heston, who was apparently unsure of both his character’s motivation and the dialogue that should reﬂect it. Peck approached his performance as the amnesiac and possible murderer Dr. Anthony Edwardes for Alfred Hitchcock’s Spellbound (1946) with the same preparation technique in mind. The famed British director showed as little patience for this approach as Marshall did a few years later. Hitchcock seems to have regarded the Method as both trendy (in the worst sense) and also useless for screen work because resources other than the actor’s voice and body were available to create character. Conﬁdent during the shooting of Spellbound (1946) that his carefully designed editing pattern, along with music, would lend the required meaning to the actor’s celluloid presence, Hitchcock asked Peck in one close-up simply to void his face of all expression. Try as he might, the actor found he could not comply. As Peck’s biographer Gary Fishgall comments, “That told him nothing about what to feel; only how to look. It was too technical for him” (Fishgall, Peck 97). This was a mark he could not hit. Much like Marshall, Hitchcock cared most about the actor’s looks, especially insofar as they marked him as belonging to a type that ﬁlmgoers would ﬁnd sympathetic. Even more important, perhaps, he was concerned about the actions and movements he had designed at the storyboard stage; the requested “blank look” apparently fell into this category. This formal structure, it seems, was often simple. Hitchcock once confessed: “My kind of picture is made up entirely of looks and reactions,” certainly an oversimpliﬁcation of the kind the director was accustomed to utter for dramatic effect, but true enough in its own way (Gottlieb 173). Peck, in contrast, had trained himself to imagine the interior feelings that allowed these movements to be produced. To achieve such authenticity, the actor had to experience (by a process of sympathetic imagination) a state of mind that would make his character’s lines and action ring true. To Hitchcock, that process was a matter of profound indifference. His only concern was that his actors should simply do as they were instructed; and, as noted, he determined what that instruction would be long before the cameras began to roll. To Peck, however, screen acting was much more than hitting his mark, and he could never be satisﬁed with just this “focus,” as Heston calls it.\n\n✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★\n\nLooking for That Inner Truth\n\nInterestingly, Peck in retrospect felt somewhat uneasy about the inadequacy of his performance for Hitchcock in Spellbound: “You do it\n\n40\n\nR. BARTON PALMER\n\nhis way. I don’t think I was at my most effective with him—not because I didn’t like him as a director, but because I was not quite ﬂexible enough . . . to do everything he wanted and at the same time provide my own inner truth. Because it’s quite possible to act the other way about, from the externals in. Many, many great actors do this” (qtd. in Haney 120). After further experience in the art of screen performance, the actor was able to recognize clearly the different interests of performer (who needed his “inner truth”) and director (who only needed to be given “everything he wanted”). Peck could now see that thinking about appearance, demeanor, gestures, movement, vocal inﬂection, and so on might constitute a useful beginning. For him, however, the process of preparation still had to arrive eventually at a plausibly fabulized interior self (or at least moment of consciousness) so that the requisite externals might be authenticated. Otherwise, acting would be only a superﬁcial impersonation, lacking the force of truth that some form of “being,” however shallow, limited, and confected, might lend it. He would, in short, give directors what they wanted, at least to the best of his ability, but he remained determined to provide his characters with an inner being that made them his own. He would not be happy with just hitting the mark, however important, as he "
