        "text": "In middle age, inventor Stephen Minch is happy enough with his life, despite the fact that he has never risen to prominence even though his innovations have made others rich. His wife Martha, however, resents his lack of drive, his complacency, his willingness to live hand-to-mouth, and his ever-present and ever-annoying sidekick Hanus Wicks. Confronted by the evidence of Martha's years-long regret over how their lives together have turned out, Stephen decides to use his newest invention to repair her unhappiness. The new invention: a time machine.\n\nA father reads his son a bedtime story about young Oblio, who is banished from the fantastical kingdom of pointed heads and things for having no point.\n\nGeorgie Soloway, a pop hit love song writer who cannot love, himself, or others. He spends his days with various women flying his plane, and dropping in to the world around him.\n\nAlfredo, a timid young Italian, lusts after and woos the beautiful Maria Rosa. But when he manages to marry her, he discovers life is not nearly so blissful as he expected.\n\nA French convict in the 1930s befriends a fellow criminal as the two of them begin serving their sentence in the South American penal colony on Devil's Island, which inspires the man to plot his escape.\n\nAfter the murder of his older brother, a New York history student is hounded by shadowy government agents on the trail of a Nazi war criminal who is trying to retrieve smuggled diamonds.\n\nIn December 1926, mystery writer Dame Agatha Christie's husband Colonel Archie Christie asks for a divorce. She leaves her car and goes missing for eleven days. US reporter Wally Stanton searches for her in this speculative story.\n\nTwo terrible lounge singers get booked to play a gig in a Moroccan hotel but somehow become pawns in an international power play between the C.I.A., the Emir of Ishtar, and the rebels trying to overthrow his regime.\n\nAfter a selfish L.A. yuppie learns his estranged father left a fortune to an autistic-savant brother in Ohio that he didn't know existed, he absconds with his brother and sets out across the country, hoping to gain a larger inheritance."
