        "text": "Synopsis\n\nJohn and Mary begins the morning after John and Mary meet in a bar, during a conversation about Jean-Luc Godard's Week End, and go home with each other. The story unfolds during the day as they belatedly get to know each other over breakfast, lunch and dinner. Flashbacks of their previous bad relationships are interspersed throughout when something in their conversation brings the thought up.\n\nCritical reception\n\nBefore the release of the film, both Hoffman and Farrow made the cover of Time in February 1969, with the headline \"The Young Actors: Stars and Anti-Stars\". This marked and celebrated new actors like Hoffman and Farrow (both hot off their successes in The Graduate and Rosemary's Baby respectively) as significant to their generation.\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times says, \"John and Mary is supposed to be a contemporary movie, I guess, and yet it's curiously out of touch. John and Mary shadow box uneasily with the American language, trying to sound like all people their age without sounding too much like any particular person.\" John Thompson of the Orlando Weekly calls it \"a delectable New Waveâ€“inspired dish for thoughtful viewers tired of the same old menu.\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times concludes, \"There is nothing wrong with the idea of John and Mary, just with its execution.\"\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 3 positive and 5 negative reviews of the film.\n\nAwards\n\nWon:\n\n1970 BAFTA Award, Best Actor - Dustin Hoffman (For Midnight Cowboy and John and Mary)\n\nNominated:\n\n1970 BAFTA Award, Best Actress - Mia Farrow (For: Rosemary's Baby, Secret Ceremony and John and Mary)\n\n1970 Golden Globes, Best Actor, Musical/Comedy - Dustin Hoffman\n\n1970 Golden Globes, Best Actress, Musical/Comedy - Mia Farrow\n\n1970 Golden Globes, Best Screenplay - John Mortimer\n\n1970 WGA Awards, Best Adapted Screenplay - John Mortimer"
