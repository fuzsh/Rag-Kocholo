It's bad enough Mia Farrow was snubbed by the Academy for Rosemary's Baby, but she should have won an Oscar for her performance in this. Dustin Hoffman is in full "Graduate" and "Midnight Cowboy" form but this is clearly Mia's movie. This film is an absolute gem! Peter Yates pulled off another great film and one which would never be made today - it's too character driven and nuanced - not enough happens - for Hollywood today. But oh, so much happens between the lines. There are voice-overs of Dustin and Mia's character's thoughts - which totally work - but because of the quality of the their performances, could easily have been eliminated.
