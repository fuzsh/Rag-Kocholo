Brian Wilson is celebrating his 80th birthday today. We’re taking a look back at the life and career of the legendary Beach Boy.

Born Brian Douglas Wilson on June 20th, 1942, in Inglewood, California, Brian is the oldest son of Audree and Murry Wilson. His two younger brothers were Dennis and Carl, who have both passed away. When Brian was 2 years old, his family moved from Inglewood to nearby Hawthorne..

The Wilson brothers, along with cousin Mike Love and Al Jardine formed The Beach Boys back in 1961.Over the years, the family act evolved from a harmony-driven surf band to mainstream pop band in the 60’s.

Brian reunited with his surviving Beach Boys bandmates for a huge 2012 tour and album. Since that reunion, Brian and Mike Love have again gone their separate ways. Brian tours with his own band -- including Al Jardine and later Beach Boys member Blondie Chaplin -- and they’re on the road this summer as he's on the road as part of a tour with Chicago.

Brian Wilson is a member of both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.
