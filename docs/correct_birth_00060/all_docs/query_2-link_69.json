        "text": "You and Brian were born in 1942 – you recently turned 80 as Brian does in June. It’s amazing that you both – and many of your peers – are still so productive and active. You just completed a tour and start up again in July, and Brian heads out in June. Could you have imagined this forty years ago?\n\nForty years ago I couldn’t even imagine forty years into the future! Let alone that I’d still be making music after all this time. It’s something I never take for granted. Both Brian and I are fortunate to be in good health and able to get out there and share our music with others. We’re also lucky that people still want to come to see us!\n\nCan you tell us when you became aware of The Beach Boys and what your impression was?\n\nThe Hollies played a show with The Beach Boys in the mid-sixties. I believe it was in Birmingham, Alabama. At least that’s what I remember. Their harmonic structure blew us away. We were all pretty floored by the sound they had created. It was really something to hear. A new kind of sound that made you stop and take notice.\n\nWhen Pet Sounds was released, U.S. album sales were somewhat disappointing, whereas in the U.K, it reached #2 and remained in the Top 10 for six months. Brian described it to me once as an “industry hit” meaning it had more impact on musicians and producers and it did on the public. What did you think of Pet Sounds when it was released?\n\nI thought it was incredible. It was one of those albums that pulled you in straight away. Start to finish it’s perfection. I think in a way that album set the bar higher for many of us as musicians. It was a real testament to Brian’s true musical genius. It still is today. You can put that album on now and it sounds just as inspiring and fresh as it did when it came out.\n\nYou’ve talked about “God Only Knows” as being a favorite of yours. Can you tell us what makes this song so special?\n\nI think the combination of the musical arrangement with the incredible vocal sound of their combined voices created a remarkably sophisticated and instantly impactful song. It’s just one of those songs that goes straight to the heart the first time you hear it, and every time after for that matter.\n\nDid the Beach Boys’ harmonies have an influence on you personally, as well as with Crosby Stills & Nash?\n\nThey weren’t an influence on me personally or with CSN, but they were certainly something I greatly admired then and still now. Their harmonies are pretty much perfection. There’s no denying that!\n\nThe last time I talked with Brian, Crosby Stills & Nash came up and he told me how much he loved your harmonies – he thought they were “very tight.” Can you explain the process of how you guys created such a beautiful harmonic sound?\n\nYou know, we really lucked out in that the three of us had such distinct voices on our own already. It was pure good fortune that when we got together our voices seemed to blend pretty effortlessly into one another. Almost creating the sound of one voice.\n\nMusic changed dramatically in the late 1960s: Crosby Stills & Nash became the world’s biggest band and sold tens of millions of albums. At the same time, The Beach Boys popularity sank. Part of this was probably due to Brian becoming less active, but perhaps as much due to their being perceived as uncool. Yet, they did make some really good albums in the early 70s like Sunflower, Surf’s Up and Holland. Were you aware of these albums, and if so, what did you think of them?\n\nI wasn’t… I knew they were still active and recording but was pretty deep in the music I was making at the time.\n\nI’m guessing you’ve crossed paths with Brian over the years. Do you have any stories or antidotes you’d like to share?\n\nI’ve actually never met Brian before! Can you believe that? Now, having said that, I would love the chance to meet him. It would be my honor.\n\nAnd anything you’d like to say to Brian as he approaches his 80th birthday.\n\nOnly that I wish him the very best in continued health and creativity. I hope he’ll keep right on performing and creating because what he does brings so much joy to people and that is what we need right now more than ever. Happy Birthday, Brian!\n\nGraham, you’re also a renowned photographer and published “A Life in Focus” this past November for Simon & Schuster (we will have a link to the Simon & Schuster book page). Can you tell us a little bit about it.\n\nThe book is a collection of images that I felt were worth seeing. There are some that people might have seen before, but many others that I had never shared until now which felt important to include in the book. It’s my hope that the book will show not only how long photography has been an important part of my life, but also how much I love it."
