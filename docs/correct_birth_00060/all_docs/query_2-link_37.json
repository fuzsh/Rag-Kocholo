        "text": "When holding down the reputation of a monumental figure in music as Brian Wilson boasts, there are a lot of important moments to cover. From first fathering together members of his family to create a band to moving away from the surfing sound that became The Beach Boys’ signature to breaking down in the face of deteriorating mental health, a timeline of Wilson’s 1960s alone could be a 40-plus entry list.\n\nAs the Smile sessions turned disastrous, Wilson’s image as the brilliant-yet-fragile genius became solidified in pop culture. But Wilson lived quite a life after initially stepping away from The Beach Boys – his mental health struggles, his returns to music, his partnership with Eugene Landy, and his establishment of a solo career.\n\nWith so many possibilities, we’ve had to key in on some of the most important moments that made Wilson the legend he is today. Quite a few of the biggest events in Wilson’s life had to be condensed, paired up, or simply left off this timeline. The truth is that Brian Wilson lived enough to have about ten timelines that cover it all.\n\nThese entries are just some of the most important points that made Brian Wilson the iconic artist that he remains today. 80 years of unstoppable creativity is being chronicled in just a few dots across the one-of-a-kind life of Brian Wilson.\n\nA timeline of Brian Wilson’s remarkable career:"
