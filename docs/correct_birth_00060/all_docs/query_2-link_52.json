This book was (ghost) written whilst BW was in the clutch of Eugene Landy, the guy who invented 24/7 psychiatry, and the guy who likes to co-write songs with his patients, as long as their name is Brian Wilson and they might sell a million. As I recall this book was the subject of a lawsuit, probably from Mike Love. Well, that's not so unusual. He sues Brian on a regular basis, and sometimes he's even completely justified.\n\nBut this book is quite unique - uniquely odd writing, weird phrases, off-centre descriptions, overblown emotionalism. Nowadays, of course, Brian Wilson fans can read it knowing that the story eventually had an entirely unexpected happy ending, with Brian's emotional rescue and the artistic triumph of Smile and That Lucky Old Sun. In fact, the whole damn story is amazing.\n\nMarch 11, 2021\n\nWhen I began reading this “autobiography” about Brian Wilson’s life, I was pretty sure that I would probably rate it with three, probably four stars. So why the one star? I’ll tell you:\n\nThis book by Brian Wilson, as told to Todd Gold, was at first, to me, quite an interesting read. While I had heard about Wilson’s struggle with mental illness and drugs, I had never known any of the details. So, it was quite eye opening to read Wilson’s account of his father, Murry Wilson’s lifetime of abuse and how it affected and tragically incapacitated Brian as a human being. In the midst of this abuse, Brian and the Beach Boys still found their stardom, with Brian responsible for the lion’s share of their success.\n\nBrian married his first wife Marilyn and they had two daughters, Carnie & Wendy. Brian was unable to be any kind of husband to Marilyn, much less a father to his girls. The book candidly details his ghastly life of drug addiction, food addiction, mental illness and literally his inability to function as a human being.\n\nBrian found salvation at the hands of a doctor Eugene Landy. Once Dr. Landy enters Wouldn’t It Be Nice, he never leaves. As the book tells the story of the miracles performed by Dr. Landy, it also explains that many in Brian’s family had serious objections to Dr. Landy and thought he was brainwashing Brian. The more I read, the more curious I got.\n\nI put down the book and began watching videos on YouTube. In 1991, Diane Sawyer interviewed Brian Wilson about Dr. Landy, concerning the allegations that Landy was a con man, had moved into Wilson’s homes, was writing and recording songs with Brian, involved himself in all of Wilson’s business deals, was making a fortune off Brian, and on and on.\n\n(These charges eventually led Landy to lose his license to practice in California and a court order in 1992 barred him from contacting Wilson.) I had gotten a bad feeling about Dr. Landy from the book thus far, but the videos and other research I performed convinced me I was right. In addition to watching videos of both Wilson and Landy, I read accounts by people who said that Brian Wilson never even saw the completed manuscript of the book before it went to print, and that Dr. Landy had controlled the writing of the book to portray himself in a messianic way. There is extensive documentation on the internet about Landy (who died in 2006) and his relationship to Brian Wilson.\n\nAll I can say is that when Dr. Landy enters Brian’s story, he’s there on every page. His ubiquity is overwhelming. Supposedly, Brian is recalling the wonderful things this amazing doctor did for him and there is nothing but defense after defense about poor misunderstood Dr. Landy’s actions. Landy, Landy, Landy, and Landy. The title of the book truly should have been changed midway to become Dr. Landy’s story, not Brian’s.\n\nMost photos in the second group are credited from the Eugene Landy Collection. It took me forever to finish this book because it was such a toxic read. On page 388, Landy is described as Brian’s “business partner, teacher, adviser, manager, protector, voice of sanity, collaborator, and closest friend. Gene Landy was all those to me, and more.”\n\nIf you’re interested in Brian Wilson’s life, you might enjoy the first part of this book and maybe even all of it. But if you’re interested in the controversy over Dr. Landy, I’d suggest watching the interviews and judging for yourself. In my opinion and that of many others, this book is Dr. Landy’s, not Brian Wilson’s. If I could rate the first half of this book higher, I would. :)\n\nIt would be interesting to hear how Brian Wilson would write his autobiography today, with Dr. Landy gone. To me, that would be the far more fascinating read.\n\n2021 UPDATE: I wrote this review in 2010. As many who read this will know, what I described above was later made into a film called LOVE & MERCY (2014) which stars both Paul Dano and John Cusack as Wilson and the amazing Paul Giamatti as Landy. It tells the truly toxic story which this book revealed (while ironically trying to portray the opposite) about the very sick Eugene Landy, now deceased. I highly recommend the film.\n\nOctober 6, 2008\n\nWhat do you think? Is this really good? If there’s one book about Brian would this be it?\n\n9/19 Nobody answered me so I got my own copy to decide for myself!\n\nReview:\n\n10/15/08 My answer. The vote is in. Finishing this book was like loosing a friend. I wanted to go on reading it forever. Anything I pick up now won't come close to how much I enjoyed this book.\n\nI was a full-fledged music fan when Brian's million dollar hits graced global airwaves. Having seen “I Just Wasn’t Made For These Times”, I knew going in that Brian had suffered and come through, but his telling is extraordinary. He recounts early life with his horrifically abusive father, incompetent mother, and resulting insecurity, mental illness and drug abuse that nearly killed him. I was amazed at how he was able to remember so many situations so clearly, to describe his craziness, insecurity and suffering in such detail, with a rawness and honesty that only he could do. In this world men are supposed to be invincible. Brian's inability to fight for himself nearly cost him everything. It took guts to reveal his tremendous weakness, given that he is so talented, so idolized.\n\nHis \"crazy doctor\", Gene Landy was lambasted by Brian's entire family, the media, etc. What Brian demonstrates is Mr. Landy's incredible ability to endure, to understand Brian's illness, to make the right moves, to make Brian address his impossible situation. Thank god Brian lives. Thank god he has the strength to tell his story. Thank god he can still hear six part harmonies in his head. I hope he stays healthy. We are blessed, not only by his music, but by that not-always-indomitable human spirit to fight against mental illness, anxiety and depression.\n\nMay 24, 2016\n\nBeautiful book, but HEROES AND VILLAINS is far more objective!\n\nThe thing that made this book sad for me was not so much that phony \"Dr. Landy\" is called Brian's savior and that Brian supposedly \"wrote\" this book under his brain-warping influence. The sad thing is that Brian really did write this and feels the need to justify a lot of his own mistakes by running down other people, aside from Dr. Landy.\n\nMarilyn Wilson married Brian at 16 and basically gave up her whole adolescence, and young adulthood to care for him. And in return he gave her almost nothing emotionally, and even less to their two daughters. Yet Brian is quick to ward off guilt by deciding that she \"used him\" and got more into being wealthy and important than actually caring about him. It's painful if you grew up listening to this man's love songs to hear how quickly he takes a Mick Jagger stance, basically sneering that Marilyn was \"just another groupie.\"\n\nBy the same token, Mike Love was an obnoxious jerk, and everyone knows it. But he really did write some great teen lyrics, and he also stood up for Brian against his father Murry. But Brian really focuses on selfish Mike, greedy Mike, etc. etc. as if to justify his own inability to stand up for his music.\n\nAll in all, while this book is a must-read for serious fans, HEROES AND VILLAINS by Steve Gaines gives a much more objective view of the \"big picture.\"\n\nSpecial postscript: Four years down the road, I've just seen the Brian Wilson movie, LOVE AND MERCY. Dr. Landy is portrayed as evil and monstrous in the movie, which I accept. But I still think this book is worth reading. The chapters specifically about Landy may be obvious fabrications, but much of the writing on Brian's early years feels authentic to me. Moreover, there is an irony here in that the anti-Landy movie distorts Brian's life and the Beach Boys' music in much the same way as this book, i.e. reducing the other Beach Boys to one-note clowns, greedy Mike, wasted Dennis, wimpy Carl, etc. WOULDN'T IT BE NICE is no more inaccurate than LOVE & MERCY, in my opinion. Brian (or his ghostwriter) is brutally frank about his hellish childhood and his years of self destruction as an adult. And there's a lot of great writing about the music that only Brian Wilson himself could have come up with.\n\nMarch 31, 2024\n\nBrian Wilson you insane motherfucker nobody understands your like I do. you should be in jail but also you should have been free to be yourself I will never forgive u and yet I worship u . I love u xx u admitted to sleeping with an androgynous twink I promise u if that would have been me I would have changed ur life . Wouldn’t it be nice ???\n\nNovember 21, 2021\n\nThis book was clearly written by a ghost writer. Real people don’t write like this. It seems to follow all the rules out of the how-to-write-an-auto-biography manual. Start with some scene, that depicts you on the low side. Then go on chronological until you reach the point where you are at the bottom. Then show how you climbed out of the pit. And put in lots and lots of dialog. Don’t care how unlikely it is that you would remember conversations that occurred decades ago.\n\nI loved it. Not so much the writing, not so much the story itself. But the allusions to the songs. Throughout reading this I had Beach Boys melodies in my head. Break away. Only God knows. Cool, cool water. Darlin, Johnny Carson. Good Time. I can hear music. (I also listened to some of their albums and to a live concert on youtube. What a delight. And by the way - Mike Love who is presented as one of the villains was the coolest guy. And the most beautiful songs were all sung by Carl.)\n\nSo he had a father, who was not the nicest guy. He, Brian, was a genius. Must be true. Everybody says so. Including himself. Or his ghost writer. And disturbed. And really uncharismatic. I checked. Him with his second wife with Larry King and live presenting Pet Sounds. Poor guy. He behaves like a zombie. Maybe the result of being brain washed by Eugene Landy. Dr. Landy. The genius who made him believe that he had saved him. At least he has managed to convince the ghost writer of this.\n\nThe Landy part of the book is interesting in itself. So everybody (including mother and daughters!) agree that Landy was the real villain of the story. But Brian sticks with him. This really seems to have been written by Landy himself.\n\nAnyway. Add some, add some add some music to your day.\n\nMay 30, 2020\n\nI think this is maybe the fourth Beach Boys related book I have read despite the fact I wouldn't consider myself a massive fan in truth although ..yep there's bits I enjoy and I do agree with the common theory that 'pet sounds' is a formidable piece of work.\n\nAnyhow this is the first book I have read which is an autobiographical piece from a member of the band the other books have been outside biographers so it was under we to get the take from someone who was there..and I'm honesty it correlated with much I have read elsewhere.\n\nThe first part of the book with the family tensions alongside Brian's father and the creation of the band are a decent read I think when Dr Tandy appears as a almost later 'father figure/guru' the book had become a little less of interest to me...the psychological comeback is a important part of the book and Wilson's fight with mental well being are documented and as such are of interest however I didn't find myself so engaged at that point.\n\nAnyhow what is of interest is the tough love treatment Brian received which I think comes across very unorthodox in these days where the idea of 'manning up' etc...well it's not now perceived wisdom..however it worked here it seems as Tandy comes across as a hard taskmaster.\n\nAll in all a half decent read.\n\nMarch 16, 2022\n\n(3 1/2). As a music afficianado who grew up with the music in the 60’s, I thought I knew a fair amount of the story on Brian Wilson. It turns out I knew very little. The Wilson brothers combative father, Murray, had quite a reputation as a total asshole, but this book really highlights it. The emotional problems all the brothers manifested certainly have some origin there. The Beach Boys story is very interesting, but Brian’s bouts with his mental health are truly frightening. Addiction was a problem and there has been a never ending story of the good news/bad news situation with Dr. Eugene Landry. This book gives us one side of the story and it is mostly highlighting how such a talented, musical genius can lead such a damaged and destructive life. Very dark for the most part. Certainly not the best autobiography out there but lots of new information to be gleaned. OK stuff.\n\nApril 24, 2021\n\nif you know going in that this book is a propaganda piece by “Dr.” Landy, then it’s a fascinating primary source from an incredibly controversial time in the history of Brian Wilson & The Beach Boys. But obviously, a majority of this book is bullshit and while I found it easy to read, there really wasn’t that much to take away from it. I would exclusively recommend this book to Beach Boys fans who are looking to get more insight into the bizarre relationship between Brian and Landy.\n\nOctober 9, 2019\n\nThe Dr. Landy sections are like some bizarre sitcom about a burned-out rocker and his even crazier shrink, but the early stuff is worth the price of admission, especially The Glass Eye chapter, a self-contained, near-perfect of Southern Californian Gothic.\n\nJune 29, 2012\n\nI rate this book two stars not only for the poor writing but also the perverse and sickening feeling that crept upon me as I read it. The first half of the story is pretty standard \"autobiographical\" schlock. It's full of bizarre anecdotes about Wilson's childhood and then the rise to success and the burden it started to take on him. It's no secret that most autobiographies are written by outside parties and that is forgivable, if annoying. What isn't forgivable is the way this book so clearly is not written in Wilson's voice at all. Most Beach Boys fans know by now that Brian Wilson was not all smiles and sunshine, but the vengeful and resentful moments in this book feel completely out of character for him, as do a lot of his descriptors and word choices.\n\nWhich brings me to this book's biggest problem: Dr. Eugene Landy, Ph.D. From the moment he's introduced, the book becomes a glowering testimonial for him and all the work he's done for Brian. The story becomes quite obviously told from his perspective as he spins yarns about becoming friends with John Belushi and co-writing songs with Brian from Love You. Landy saved Wilson's life but this book shows how twisted and messed up their relationship had become.\n\nThe worst part about this book is that I'm not sure why I read it at all. I had been warned ahead of time about Landy's tampering and meddling with the book and Brian Wilsom himself admitted under oath that he had not played any part in the creation of this book (aside from dropping off some tapes at the author's house). So why is it that I couldn't put it down even as Gene grew more and more prominent. I guess it goes back to that ugly feeling I brought up earlier. This is a negative and poisonous book even when Landy isn't around. If you enjoy reading hundreds of pages of gossip purporting to be written by a musical legend then check this book out. If you want to read a more balanced account of Brian Wilson's life and music, check out Catch A Wave: The Rise, Fall and Redemption of Brian Wilson by Peter Amos Carlin.\n\nMay 4, 2012\n\nThere's essentially two halves to this book: the first half, with deals mostly with Brian's pre-Landy life, and the second half, which is his Landy and (briefly) post-Landy life. The former is interesting and engaging reading, and hell, maybe some of it is true! Though in Wouldn't It Be Nice, I'd take everything with a sizable lick of salt. But even if it's mostly fabrication, at least it's good reading, and for that, the first half of the book deserves a much higher rating than the 3-stars I gave it. And the reason why is the second half.\n\nAfter meeting and \"befriending\" Landy, the story quickly devolves simultaneously into a nauseating panegyric extolling the virtues of said Svengali-cum-charlatan, and a philippic denouncing Brian's first wife Marilyn, their children, and the Beach Boys (though I certainly have no sympathy for Mike Love, who from various other sources, seems to deserve the attacks). This second half of the book is so frustratingly polluted by Landy, it doesn't even deserve a star.\n\nSo there you have it, a book that starts off well, and ends terribly. Of course, I went into this book expecting as much. I wouldn't recommend anyone read it as a definitive account of Brian's life; rather, approach it as an artifact of Brian's Landy-controlled days, and realize that just about everything contained in these roughly 400 pages are contaminated by that discredited, and now-deceased, charlatan.\n\nSo there you have it; my reasons for making this logical, arithmetical compromise of 3-stars.\n\nAugust 7, 2014\n\nThis book is a roller-coaster of a read. Brian's ups and downs over the course of his life are depressing, and at times exhausting to read due to the magnitude of the sadness he's experienced. I wouldn't say this book was enjoyable, mainly because it's just so sad and a lot of parts are cringe-worthy, but it's definitely an intriguing read. It opens up a good psychology study, dealing with the affects that abuse and lack of nurturing parents can have on a person. Brian's descent into madness has so little to do with the hallucinogens of the sixties and is more a testament to him succumbing to the demons of his past and present, and I can't blame him for it. Many things Brian does during the darkest period of his life are repulsive and shameful, and the narrative is raw and uncensored--Brian holds nothing back. So at times it can be hard to side with him, but that only makes the book more real. It's very interesting, and equally chilling, to get a first-hand account of how it feels to go crazy. And it's moving to see someone get better.\n\nThis book did go through about a 40 page dry patch, so I can't really give it a 5 star rating, but the ending blew me away. Brian's newfound strength of character and lust for life made the harrowing scenes of his adolescence and early adulthood less sad. Knowing that someone could get better after such a rocky life is very inspirational.\n\nNovember 18, 2019\n\nDNF @ 272 pages\n\nI didn't realise how controversial this book was before starting it. The early parts of the book dealing with Brian's childhood and the start of The Beach Boys are OK, if a bit all over the place. There are some good anecdotes that reveal the inspirations behind several songs, but that's pretty much the best thing I can say about this book.\n\nFrom roughly the midpoint onwards, Eugene Landy enters Brian's life and it all goes downhill. I only knew a little about their shared history before reading this, but after a short while of only reading about how great Landy is (every character in the book seems to have a connection to him and only says good things, as soon as he is introduced) I got suspicious and did some further reading about Landy elsewhere. From the mid 70s right up until when this book was published Landy exhibited a huge psychological influence over everything in Brian's life. It's very obvious that he had a heavy hand in this book and his own glowing depiction in it. There isn't really any attempt to be subtle, the writing is awful and jumps all over the place, it definitely doesn't read as you'd imagine Brian writing / narrating it.\n\nI'm a huge Brian fan but this isn't worth anyone's time, I'd give it 0 if I could.\n\nAugust 3, 2008\n\nIf Brian Wilson actually wrote this biography (and there are plenty of people who dispute that, ascribing it to his psychologist-songwriting partner-best friend-music producer Dr. Eugene Landy), it is, without a doubt, the most honest, sad, and ultimately heartbreaking self-revelation of anyone who has ever scaled the heights of stardom and success.\n\nIf it is factually accurate, then it is the most compelling cautionary tale of excess and its costs ever written. If it is not, then why did I finish reading it understanding to a greater degree than ever before why popular culture icons misbehave and self-destruct with such regularity and predictability. In other words, even if it's not completely accurate when dealing with Brian Wilson, it is true in the sense that my gut tells me it is true: if I was given EVERYTHING, could I handle it?\n\nAt this late date, it's amazing that BW is still alive. His father, mother, both brothers Carl and Dennis, and the infamous Eugene Landy have all preceded him in death. Brian, meanwhile, is still writing, recording, and performing. I'll bet Mike Love hates that...\n\nJune 29, 2008\n\nA very strange book. Billed as an autobiography when it came out, Brian Wilson later claimed that he had never even read the book in its entirety, and that it was entirely written by his therapist at the time, Eugene Landy. In a formal trick similar to Gertrude Stein's Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, but executed with different intentions in mind, Landy creates a fictionalized version of Brian Wilson's life with himself cast in the role of God-like psychological savior. The first half of the book is a juicy retelling of Brian's abused childhood and later ascent to stardom and descent into madness - but the second half is where things really get both interesting and monotonous, as Landy (speaking as Brian Wilson in the first person) gives an obsessively detailed account of Landy's treatment of Brian, a treatment which required Landy to control every aspect of Brian's life, including co-writing his songs. The ending, when Brian gets a restraining order on his psychologist only in order to prove his undying love for his savior, is especially surreal.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMarch 3, 2015\n\nLandy...you egotisical bastard, I've read your book!\n\nThis is not Brian Wilson. This is a hodge-podge of old interviews and articles on the history of the Beach Boys (psychological abuse and all) and then a name-dropping, self-praising testimony of the man who took a musical genius from one brink of destruction to another.\n\nBrian even testified he had little to do with this book at all and that Landy was behind the whole thing and it shows. Brian has had a rough life and this book shows it, but there is no happiness shown in it until Landy appears like a savior and even then it makes you want to take psychotropic drugs just to ease the pain of reading how wonderful that swindling sack of crap was.\n\nTo be honest, I'm looking forward to Love & Mercy, the biopic on Brian Wilson because that is based more in reality than this book. My only disappoint is 24 years after this attempt, we still have yet to get an authorized definitive biography of one of the great musical minds of American pop music.\n\nFebruary 28, 2018\n\nOn Sky One’s “Brainiac” programme, they used to try to put the lie to Twisted Sister’s “Can’t Stop Rock and Roll” by a variety of methods. They’ve found that you can stop rock and roll with a shotgun, with a flamethrower, with a caravan, with a chainsaw, with lots of things.\n\nMany years before “Brainiac” had even been conceived, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys did something similar. He discovered that you can stop rock and roll with drug addiction and mental illness.\n\nAfter years of mental and physical abuse from his father, Brian Wilson found solace in music, finding that it allowed him to put his hurts to one side, if only for a little while. Getting together with his brothers and a cousin, he founded the Beach Boys who, for a while, were one of the world’s most popular bands.\n\nBut as their popularity grew, so did the pressure on Brian Wilson. His father, a failed songwriter himself, was constantly putting down Brian’s efforts and trying to claim credit, as well as some of the money, for himself. The record company, buoyed with the success of the Beach Boys wanted more hits, and now! Trying to cope with writing, recording, touring and listening to the advice of everyone, most of whom wanted little more than to for Brian to be doing what they wanted was bound to crack Brian eventually. Add drugs; first marijuana, then LSD, then cocaine into the mix, and you have a recipe for disaster. Pushed and pulled all over the place, a nervous breakdown, and worse, was maybe inevitable.\n\nIf you’ve ever enjoyed stories of rock and roll excesses, then this isn’t the book for you. Whilst it certainly seems that Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys have done some weird things and taken many, many drugs, that’s not the main feature of this book. In fact, everything seems to lead towards Brian’s mental illness and his recovery from that, with the drugs simply being a step down that path, not a catalyst to disaster.\n\nIt is this that gives the story a lack of balance. There’s more words dedicated to Brian’s decline and fall, and the attempts to pick him back up again than there are to life with the Beach Boys. Even where the Beach Boys are mentioned, most of it is the recording of the music and the battles with the rest of the band than there is about the success and the joys it bought. It may be that Brian Wilson was so unwell that he didn’t actually enjoy a single moment of his success, but I would have still expected more mention of that, other than how it related to his declining mental state.\n\nThere’s also a great deal of space in the book dedicated to Brian’s relationship with Dr Eugene Landy, supposedly a psychiatrist who was helping Brian. Depending on who you listen to outside of this relationship, though, it’s a possibility that things didn’t happen the way they are recounted here, and it may be that Dr Landy bullied Brian in much the same way as his father had done years before. Whichever possibility is true, there’s too much about him in the book for there to be much balance.\n\nFor this reason, it’s quite a hard book to read. There’s no sense of Brian overcoming his mental illness to be the Beach Boys, so there’s no uplifting story to be read between the lines. The Beach Boys and the illness, drug use and depression all go together, and it’s the depression that leaches most strongly onto the page. Most of the story is written on a bit of a downer, and it’s tough to enjoy reading something like that.\n\nAlthough it’s not a badly written book, it is fairly simply written. Brian Wilson is credited as the author but from a songwriter, I would have expected something a little more lyrical and poetic than there is here. There are some nice turns of phrase on occasion, but more often than not, it’s pretty prosaic most of the time. I suspect that the book was mostly written by Todd Gold, who is credited as the secondary author, although only after a long time talking to Brian Wilson. Brian may have told the story, but I doubt he did much with regards to physically getting the words onto the page.\n\nAll this said I am not the biggest of Beach Boys fans, which might be why I haven’t been taken too much by this book. My flatmate, who I borrowed it from and who IS a big fan, did enjoy it. But he has since read other books about Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys and says they were better than this one.\n\nThis is really a book for only the hardiest of Beach Boys and/or Brian Wilson fans. If you have only a passing interest in either, there are other books on them which are more balanced and better written. “The Making of Pet Sounds” is one I can recommend. For the non-fan, and particularly as someone who wasn’t even alive when the Beach Boys were at their height, this may be a welcome distraction to a long bus journey, which was how I read it, but it doesn’t have enough to keep you returning back to it. For a fan, it’s got some interesting insights, but may not be the most balanced or most accurate account of Brian Wilson’s life you’ll ever read.\n\nFor a book with such limited appeal,it's OK if you’re a big enough fan of the Beach Boys, or enough of a fanatic about music generally, especially 60’s music, to be interested in details of their trials and tribulations. Otherwise, avoid, as you’re likely to feel that you’ve wasted your money.\n\nWhilst I wouldn’t say I didn’t enjoy the story, at least in part, that was more in a “how the other half live” way, rather than an “it’s Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys!” way. I’d be unlikely to read it again, and I’m delighted that it was a loan from my flatmate, and I didn’t have to pay for it. On a positive note, however, it’s reminded me of some pretty good music and, thanks in part to my flatmate’s CD collection, I’ve had many enjoyable times listening to the Beach Boys music again. More than I ever had, or am ever likely to have, from reading the book.\n\nJanuary 2, 2011\n\nFascinating, and often disheartened. The abuse, addictions, and mental illness that Brian Wilson endured become somewhat fathomable, but the insult to injury is being surrounded by family and bandmates that in no way help Brian Wilson, they would rather keep riding the coattails of his genius and success. This book raises some interesting thoughts about intensive (and expensive) radical psychotherapy.\n\nThis is the kind of book I feel I could go on an on for hours about. The best epilogue is seeing the amazing success/recovery he has had years after the release of this book. My only main issue with the book is that there is little talk about the actual song writing and production, but that is to be expected with an amateur writer.\n\nOctober 21, 2012\n\nA strange book. The subject of much early 1990s litigation between various members of the band, with Brian Wilson holding up his hands to say he didn't write it, or couldn't remember it, or it was someone else's memories. Still a fascinating glimpse, primarily, into the relationship between Dr Landy and his team and Brian Wilson: patient and psychologist; co-songwriters; co-book writers; manager and client; would be film producers etc. Only in America could such behaviour continue for so long. Scary, because Landy did help to save his life, but then took it over almost lock, stock and barrel. A cautionary tale of money, drugs and too much influence. The part not about Landy is all cobbled together cut and paste.\n\nDefinitely not Todd Gold's finest hour.\n\nMarch 23, 2010\n\nI really enjoyed this. Even with its redundancy, in the end it was necessary to tell a good story. In retrospect, I also enjoyed the kinda sadness it made me feel. I had a hard time putting it down. The Beach Boys were real dicks to Brian.\n\nJuly 27, 2011\n\nI loved it so much more before I found out quite how much of it was written by his shrink...\n\nJune 11, 2015\n\nPretty interesting facts. You really have to be a Beach Boys fan to get into this book I think. Wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who isn't!\n\nJuly 29, 2016\n\nExcellent story of Brian Wilson's fight with mental health and his genius behind the Beach Boys. Very easy to read if you are a fan.\n\nJanuary 30, 2018\n\n“He’s made a lot of people happy for a long time.”\n\nThat’s what Paul Simon said at the conclusion of his thoughtful, “unplugged” rendition of Brian Wilson’s first ever composition, “Surfer Girl” at the 2001 “All-Star Tribute to Brian Wilson” at Radio City Music Hall. As I watched Simon softly utter these words, standing there alone on the stage with his acoustic guitar, wearing a pair of jeans and a baseball cap, I realized he’d summed up, in one simple sentence, the enduring greatness of Brian Wilson’s musical creations, and the many wonderful ways in which his songs “painted” the memories of my youth in the sunny gold hues of sandy beaches, drive-in diners and tanned, bleached haired surfers of Southern California.\n\nSongs like: “All Summer Long”, “Wendy”, “The Warmth of the Sun”, “In My Room” and every single song on the album “Pet Sounds” were an ever present accompaniment to my long lazy summer drives, school dances and skating parties. They were part of that magic sparkle, a glowing light guiding me, the young man on his journey toward growing up.\n\nBy the time I’d picked up Wilson’s “Wouldn’t It Be Nice – My Own Story” I felt as though I knew the man, not fully appreciating how everything I thought I knew came from no other source than my memories of his songs, and all the happiness they brought me. But his truth was something completely different. As I read his book I realized how much he struggled with reclusiveness, depression, drug use and the kind of erratic behavior that ultimately lead to the unorthodox, yet ultimately successful intervention of psychologist and psychotherapist Eugene Landy.\n\nAs the chapters of Wilson’s autobiography flew past, I found my thoughts competing between admiration for the man who’s heart and mind once single-handedly housed such a thick, inspiring chapter of the Great American Songbook, to a shade of sadness for the many setbacks and challenges he faced in his middle years. But as I reached the last few chapters, I felt my admiration of him once again begin to win out. I now understood what he’d been through, how he overcame, and how he eventually went back to writing the songs…crafting the unforgettable lyrics that he was born to do.\n\nIn the end, I put down the book, quietly considering everything I’d learned and tried to sum up how I felt. I soon realized there was only one word that fit.\n\nHappy.\n\nAugust 8, 2021\n\nI'm not sure what makes rock autobiographies so appealing to me, but I couldn't pass up this one by Brian Wilson. Although I grew up listening to the Beach Boys, owned their records (and now CDs), saw the in concert (sans Brian in the early 70s), they were never my favorite group. That said, I still listen to them now, which says quite a bit about the quality of their music. And of course, Brian was always the driving force behind the Beach Boys' music. One always recognized the genius of Brian Wilson, but after reading this book, it becomes starkly clear and amazing at how deep and ongoing it is. And there was always his weirdness and reclusiveness, and drug abuse that was fuzzed around--but after reading this book, it is amazing that this man produced the quality and quantity of music that he did. And that he has survived physical and mental abuse from his parents and family, mental abuse from his bandmates (including his brother, Carl, and most often his cousin, Mike Love--who gets the jerk of the year award in my book), record companies and producers, mental illness that went undiagnosed and ignored for years, and out of control drug abuse, and yet still wrote and arranged and produced hit song after hit song, after hit song, and is still alive to tell the tale is all the more amazing. I'm not sure I would ever feel comfortable being his friend, but I certainly hold this man in great respect. I can't imagine what he would have been able to produce musically if his life hadn't been so full of emotional black holes. Even with those black holes, his catalog blows the mind. Sadly, although my opinion of Brian has improved, my feeling for the rest of the group (with the exception of Dennis), has deteriorated quite a bit. And perhaps saddest of all, after reading this book, I will never be able to enjoy Kokomo quite the same way ever again. This books takes you on a hard journey. It left me saddened and at times horrified, but also stands a wonderful tribute to the resiliency and tenacity of a great spirit and a truly great musical mind. Mr. Wilson, I only hope that you have nothing but Good Vibrations surrounding you for the rest of your days on this earth. You certainly deserve them.\n\nSeptember 1, 2020\n\nI actually enjoyed reading this mess of a man. It's incredible Brian is still alive. Due to an abusive father and mother who seemed to not care, he grew up insecure and scared of life. So much, that he needed drugs to try and function everyday with..family.. Beach Boys..expectations from everyone. It's your typical rock star poor me can't handle the stress read. It's a very long read. First half is his life growing up with his hard to please abusive father and how Beach Boys got started.. Other half he's a mess, he can only try and function with drugs to cope with everything.. Then the doctor comes into the story to help him. He seemed to really be the only person who can handle Brian. Brian gives up easy and very stubborn. I think Brian would be dead if it wasn't for this doctor. But, I think this doctor knew this and main goal was to get him healthy to hide the control he had over Brian. Brian could never do anything without asking the Doctor. The Doctor even got involved with his music..So after reading this book, I hear this doctor is the ghost writer of this book (book dated up to 1990). Apparently there was an restraining order on this doctor after 1990.. I'd like to read Brian's book now written by him how it really was.. But I enjoyed this book anyways.. Doctored up or not. I was very disappointed in Brian never trying hard enough to be there for his kids. He seemed really selfish and told them when they were young that he was a bad daddy and can't really help being that way..he'd write them a song to make it up to them.. (If he can see he's a bad daddy he didn't care to change for them for the better later). He never mentioned anymore in the book if he ever wrote them their song..that got left hanging for me.\n\nDecember 21, 2020\n\nThis revealed how famous the Beach Boys were in the 60s and 70s and how famous artists\n\nof that time looked up to them. The main driver Brian Wilson battled his personal demons his whole\n\nup to his late 40s when the autobiography was published. He lived for writing songs but mostly shunned the public life including playing with the rest of the group. His personal life was mostly a mess including his at home growing up year, with an aggressive abuse father and a passive mother.\n\nAlcohol and drugs were were usual escape and often he relied on others to help him cope. In his late 40s he seemed much more capable of looking after himself and took on a healthier lifestyle.\n\nOctober 27, 2021\n\nWow, Cali Gothic at its finest. What a life. Any pedestrian Beach Boys fan will know Brian's story of growing up with an abusive father. But this is story of triumph over life and told with brutal honesty.\n\nI went through this book pretty fast as it was a very engaging story, told in a conversational tone. You'd have thought Brian was sitting right next to you, about his struggle to evolve as an artist despite those who were part of the money train convinced that what made music in the 60's could work just as well decades later.\n\nIt's not a flattering look at some of the other members of the group or the music industry.\n\nWhat music, what a life...what a story."
