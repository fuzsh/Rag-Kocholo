        "text": "Brian Douglas Wilson (born June 20, 1942, Inglewood, CA) is an American musician, best known as the leader and chief songwriter of the group The Beach Boys. On stage, Wilson provided many of the lead vocals, and often harmonized with the group in falsetto. Early during his on-stage career, Wilson primarily played bass on stage, but gradually transitioned to primarily playing piano/keyboards. Besides being the primary composer in The Beach Boys, he also functioned as the band's main producer and arranger. After signing with Capitol Records in mid-1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits including \"Surfin' Safari\", \"Surfin' U.S.A.\", \"Shut Down\", \"Little Deuce Coupe\", \"Be True to Your School\", \"In My Room\", \"Fun, Fun, Fun\", \"I Get Around\", \"Dance Dance Dance\", \"Help Me Rhonda\", \"California Girls\", and \"Good Vibrations\".\n\nSource: Wikipedia"
