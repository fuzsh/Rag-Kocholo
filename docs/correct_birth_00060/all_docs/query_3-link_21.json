Right now I’m applying the carnitas theory. The concept is to eat just the right amount of carnitas over your life time to knock the bad years off the end. One night you go to bed and the next day you wake up dead. However you don’t want to eat to much carnitas and dip into the good years, it’s a fine balance\n\nTrollerDave\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nMar 8, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n3,996\n\nReaction score\n\n8,563\n\nSad deal. He’s been dependent for such a long time. If you haven’t seen the movie, Love and Mercy, it’s really good and tells his story from growing up to meeting and marrying Melinda.\n\nSome of my earliest musical memories are from our 8 track of The Beach Boys Endless Summer.

The last few years have been interesting. My family and especially my wife have been great. We have been at the Landing 15 years now.\n\nThe first episode or sign of change came up few years ago. Explained to wife i need do a quick turn around to Ventura regarding our business. Fact is i responded to Scream & Fly advertisement for boat for sale in Louisiana,made a deal on phone with a great guy. We agreed meet in Duncanville Texas. 3 days later came home with awesome STV. Family was amused. Next up a year after that trip explained to wife a trip to Phoenix for us to just get away. Again,fact is on phone pretty much had agreed if boat was as advertised would purchase. We came home with a boat i always admired 1979 Campbell. Well,for many years i did my best for family and business especially my awesome wife of almost 50 years. These days they let me think i’m still in control but the leash has gotten shorter these days but stll having some good times . Incredible neighbors at the landing that show up every weekend.\n\nstephenkatsea\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nApr 30, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n8,237\n\nReaction score\n\n12,039\n\n… wow…I did not know that his wife had passed…\n\n… Brian was born a Gemini… and had dealt with schizophrenia, for much of his life..: the alcohol and drugs were a crutch to a point… And then it all went haywire…\n\n… a brilliant, brilliant composer, and lyricist… RIP… Mr. Wilson…\n\n… ( his bio is definitely worth a read )…\n\nBrian Wilson has not died.

They were great. Later saw them in Vegas, late 70s and they were terrible. Brian had just returned to the band.\n\nDennis Wilson - Drums, died of drowning in 1983 in MDR. He was 39, married 5 times and had connections to Charles Manson and family. Significant drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nCarl Wilson - Lead guitar, died of lung cancer 1998 in Los Angeles.

Reportedly, his prior abuse has worsened his present bout with dementia. I’m sure there are some who never drank, but also suffer from dementia. There’s a lot yet to be learned about dementia. It’s a bad deal, for sure.\n\nUnlike his brothers, I don’t believe Carl abused drugs and alcohol. Carl was a longtime cigarette smoker.
