        "text": "Post by Rick Bartlett on\n\nIt never ceases to amaze me, and getting older, how quickly time is going by, so I've had time to reminisce.\n\nIt's almost May 2023, and almost a few months short of Brian's last show to date.\n\nCurrently, that's 7/26/22, Pine Knob Music Theatre.\n\nHere is the introduction and a finale from 'Al' pretty much stating the fact.\n\nI'm sad seeing my heroes slowly get old and almost disappear right in front of my eyes, and all the while,\n\nI'm happy knowing Brian has had a full life and to see a man, who is human after all!\n\nBrian has always been my 'Elvis'! if that makes any sense.\n\nIt's also a little sad to see a half empty crowd, when in time, people will be screaming out in fury wishing they were there\n\nto see the big fella with their own eyes.\n\nBrian's performance 'chops' are behind him, but there's still a little magic about this man that has always been a part of the\n\nmyth, the legend and the fact.\n\nIt also shows what time can do to a person, and how short our lives really are.\n\nIt only seems like yesterday seeing Brian regain his career back in the mid 90's, recording, becoming productive, and touring!\n\nYou could not have bet money on it the work load he was about to embark upon over the next 20 years!\n\nIt's a miracle if there was one.\n\nWhile his live shows were not all magical, some were just that, and a little more if you were lucky on one of those nights!\n\nI'm glad I got to see a few of those and they have become some of my favorite memories.\n\nSeeing this last show, I see an old fella who is tired, but so very proud of what he has accomplished.\n\nAlso if this is the last one, it's nice his pal Al was there right til the end and helping his old friend out.\n\nBrian has had a huge impact on my life and I love this man.\n\nFeeling a little sentimental at the moment and just reflecting....\n\nI'm gonna miss this guy one of these days...\n\nPost by lonelysummer on\n\nWell, it's happening to all of us. In my prime, I was going out to probably one concert a month (sometimes more). Now I look at the lists of upcoming shows, and most of the bands I've never heard of; and others are just charging far too much for someone on a limited income (me). Yeah, it's a combination of seeing ticket prices soar, and fewer acts out there that I am interested in.\n\nI remember thinking back in 2013 that $50 was a lot to see Michael Nesmith (and for an additional $50, I could have done the meet and greet), but he was not a touring animal, so I paid the money and took my chance. I'm glad I did. And now he's gone. I saw all four Monkees individually, and Micky, Davy and Peter together twice. Now Micky is the only one left, and I have no interest in seeing him perform as The Monkee.\n\nI love the Beatles, but Macca charges way too much for his shows, and his voice is gone. Ringo still looks and sounds great, but I have no interest in his current All Starrs. Is it really worth coughing up $80 to see Ringo sing a few songs, and back up other guys on their hits?\n\nI doubt Ray or Dave Davies will ever tour again; so for me, that leaves Bob Dylan and John Fogerty. And Mike and Bruce.\n\nYeah, it's depressing. I grew up loving the rock and roll of the 50's 60's 70's, but always assumed other acts would come along that I would grow to love just as much as those oldsters. Well, occasionally someone would come along...and then they'd disappear.\n\nThe last show I went to was a little known acoustic performer who goes as Hamell on Trial. The only reason we get to see him out here is my friend knows him and pays his way. Let's him stay at his house and everything. A good size crowd for Hamell is 50 people.\n\nPost by andrewhickey on\n\nWell, it's happening to all of us. In my prime, I was going out to probably one concert a month (sometimes more).

Now Micky is the only one left, and I have no interest in seeing him perform as The Monkee.\n\nDrifting from the topic a bit but on the cruise last year Micky's solo performance was quite, quite magical. I booked to go on it partly of course to see Mike & Bruce's band, and partly to see the Temptations (who were better than I expected) but mostly because I thought it would be the last chance to see Nez as a Monkee (I'd seen him solo in 2012) but of course he died between buying a ticket and setting sail. But Micky's \"celebrates the Monkees\" show was worlds better than the solo show I'd seen him do in 2016, and his new keyboard player and lead guitarist had very much the same energy and attitude about them that Darian and Nicky had when they started performing with Brian. Go if you can.\n\nPost by Awesoman on\n\nAs a guy at the tail end of Generation X, rather than embracing most \"modern\" music growing up which included alt-rock and hip hop, my musical tastes always gravitated towards older music my parents grew up with. It's hard to watch my heroes such as the Beach Boys, Paul McCartney and others grow old and eventually fade out entirely from recording and performing as they are the music I primarily followed through the years. It's nice that at least Paul Simon and apparently the Rolling Stones have at least one more new album each in the works but it doesn't appear we're going to be receiving much else after that. It has forced me to engage younger artists and embrace more modern music but it just ain't the same.\n\nYou could always give \"classical\" music a try. Masses of variety there and the time/age factor doesn't figure at all. Just a thought (he said, making a dash for the door).\n\nAgreed and I do listen to some classical. Not to mention some jazz as well. But I'm talking about artists I can follow who currently make music and perform.\n\nPost by ironhorseapples on\n\nAs a guy at the tail end of Generation X, rather than embracing most \"modern\" music growing up which included alt-rock and hip hop, my musical tastes always gravitated towards older music my parents grew up with. It's hard to watch my heroes such as the Beach Boys, Paul McCartney and others grow old and eventually fade out entirely from recording and performing as they are the music I primarily followed through the years. It's nice that at least Paul Simon and apparently the Rolling Stones have at least one more new album each in the works but it doesn't appear we're going to be receiving much else after that. It has forced me to engage younger artists and embrace more modern music but it just ain't the same.\n\nYou could always give \"classical\" music a try. Masses of variety there and the time/age factor doesn't figure at all. Just a thought (he said, making a dash for the door).\n\nAbsolutely. Interestingly, the Beach Boys were my 'gateway drug' to so many genres I wouldn't have otherwise considered as a young gen x-er in my late teens. Smile alone turned me onto baroque, jazz and exotica. Not to mention my utter love of barbershop quartets. I owe my eclectic tastes 100% to the Beach Boys. As one of the Gibb brothers put it, they were 'great teachers in the field'\n\nPost by newbbfan on\n\nTrying to make out what Al was saying there as an introduction; was it simply a reference that this was the last show of the tour, or do you think there was a resonance there of a greater sense that the last time the two would appear on stage together ever?\n\nI guess there was an ambiguity there that's all the more poignant and maybe Al did say something a bit later on about likely not going out with Brian again on tour or something like that?\n\nIn any case this was not the planned and definitive final show, right? Were there shows that were canceled after this? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether this was billed ,advertised , and promoted as the final show, or whether, now, since Brian seems to have retired that this would wind up feeling the slot of the final show. Just trying to determine whether I missed some critical information there.\n\nBut what Rick says and what everyone says on the emotional level is nonetheless, whatever unfolds, completely true and completely poignant. And if it's the last show, I believe-- unless I'm not distinguishing the voices correctly-- Brian sang both verses of California Girls on key in tune in perfectly accurately, and under the circumstances sounded just fine to me. What a warrior for music.\n\nOur history becomes a history of firsts and lasts more quickly than we would like to acknowledge.\n\nPost by AGD on\n\nThat was, as Alan clearly says, the final show of the joint tour with Chicago (joint... yeah: Brian opened every date) - \"last time this tour with Brian Wilson\", and Brian had five more shows scheduled, the first just under two weeks later, but less than 24 hours after it was promoted on his own Facebook page they were all cancelled due to a downturn in his health (according to the management). Since then... nothing. Not a word. No more dates, no rescheduled shows. The concensus is that Brian's touring days are over (Carnie as much as said so on the BBTalk show she was on, although she's not exactly in constant touch with her father). In all honesty, that should have happened a couple of years ago. As for this observation of yours - \"Brian sang both verses of California Girls on key in tune in perfectly accurately\" - you must be watching a different video to me. First verse, yes, adequate if clipped... but he basically gave up halfway through the second.\n\nSo no, never planned or announced/advertised as the final show, but it almost certainly was. With all my heart, I hope so. It hurts to see Brian embarrassed like this: the man deserves so much better.\n\nPost by jk on\n\nYou could always give \"classical\" music a try.

As one of the Gibb brothers put it, they were 'great teachers in the field'\n\nI came in from the other side! After five years of buying one or two \"classical\" LPs virtually every week, I switched to pop albums (via Ravi Shankar) with my head full of a hundred years of orchestral and choral music. So for me it was first Charles Ives and Aaron Copland and then SMiLE (and first Edgard Varèse and John Cage and then Frank Zappa).\n\nBut in 1967 I was completely in awe of Pet Sounds, my first pop album since Del Shannon's debut in '61. I knew many tracks from \"pirate\" radio but stuff like \"Don't Talk\" and \"LGAFA\" was not a million miles away from the classical things I knew and loved.\n\nPost by lonelysummer on\n\nWell, it's happening to all of us. In my prime, I was going out to probably one concert a month (sometimes more). Now I look at the lists of upcoming shows, and most of the bands I've never heard of; and others are just charging far too much for someone on a limited income (me). Yeah, it's a combination of seeing ticket prices soar, and fewer acts out there that I am interested in.\n\nI remember thinking back in 2013 that $50 was a lot to see Michael Nesmith (and for an additional $50, I could have done the meet and greet), but he was not a touring animal, so I paid the money and took my chance. I'm glad I did. And now he's gone. I saw all four Monkees individually, and Micky, Davy and Peter together twice. Now Micky is the only one left, and I have no interest in seeing him perform as The Monkee.\n\nDrifting from the topic a bit but on the cruise last year Micky's solo performance was quite, quite magical. I booked to go on it partly of course to see Mike & Bruce's band, and partly to see the Temptations (who were better than I expected) but mostly because I thought it would be the last chance to see Nez as a Monkee (I'd seen him solo in 2012) but of course he died between buying a ticket and setting sail. But Micky's \"celebrates the Monkees\" show was worlds better than the solo show I'd seen him do in 2016, and his new keyboard player and lead guitarist had very much the same energy and attitude about them that Darian and Nicky had when they started performing with Brian. Go if you can.\n\nFor me, Micky has kind of worn out his welcome. I saw the group in 1987 and 1997; Davy solo in 1996; Peter with Shoe Suede Blues in 2001; Micky solo in 2006 and 2007; and Mike solo in 2013. Michael and Peter were the most interesting to be as solo performers, because they weren't trying to do a Monkees show. I don't really care to see Micky singing Davy and Michael's songs.\n\nPost by andrewhickey on\n\nI skipped the BW/Chicago show when it came to my town. The clips online were not pretty sad. I didn't want to see Brian like that.\n\nI saw the never-ending Pet Sounds shows in 2016 and 2017, and neither of those were particularly memorable either. I had had enough.\n\nYou made the right decision. I saw two of the shows in 2016, and on one I was lucky enough to see the soundcheck. Brian was clearly in charge on that show, and clearly doing well -- he was a bit bored for part of the Pet Sounds set and speak-singing a bit, but it was a good show and had one moment that was very, very special for me. The other one I saw a few days later was less good, but still a perfectly fine show.\n\nI saw him in 2017, and he was bored and not at his best apart from the three-song mini Wild Honey set, where he came alive. Al, Matt, and Blondie carried the rest of the show. I decided not to bother again unless he was going to do something very different, but it was just about adequate, and everyone has an off night.\n\nBut then in 2018 I got the opportunity to see him again for £2, on what turned out to be his second-to-last ever UK show. It was £2 because tickets became available through a seat-filler site because nobody was interested any more, but I thought it was probably worth £2 even though it was yet another Pet Sounds show.\n\nWhere previously I'd seen Brian play at the Royal Festival Hall, the Royal Albert Hall, the Bridgewater Hall, prestigious, classy, concert venues designed for classical music, this time he was playing \"Digbeth Arena\". This is called an arena but is actually a disused, graffitid, car park, with a couple of Portaloos and a \"bar\" consisting of a trestle table with someone pouring cans of lager into plastic cups. The \"venue\" could hold approximately a thousand people but it was maybe half full. It was grey, and rainy, and Brian clearly wanted to be anywhere else in the entire world, but despite the surroundings it could still have been a great gig if Brian hadn't been so clearly unwell and incapable of performing. He mumbled his way through about half the lyrics to the handful of songs he sang on at all, forgetting the other half and not even attempting to sing in tune, and spent the rest of the time staring into space dissociating. The rest of the band tried their best, but I honestly felt cruel and somewhat soiled by the experience, as if I was being nonconsensually drafted into participating in elder abuse. It was heartbreakingly sad.\n\n(Note that I don't say it *was* elder abuse. I've spoken a lot with Brian's band members over the years, though not since then, and I firmly believe that they all have Brian's best interests at heart and wouldn't take part in something that they knew in advance would be upsetting for him. But it's very easy for something that starts out great to slowly turn into something with good days, bad days, and the occasional great day when you can convince yourself it's still like it was, and then for the great days to become infrequent, the good days less good, and the bad days worse, without you really realising if that's your day-to-day existence. But seeing the clear, marked deterioration over that two-year period made it very, very visible what was happening. In 2016 touring was still a net positive both for Brian and his reputation, even if the shows weren't quite as good as those from 2002 or 2004 or 2007. In 2018 he was a seriously ill man dissociating in a half-full car park in the rain while an audience of a couple of hundred people who hadn't even paid for their tickets cheered and pretended not to notice what was in front of their eyes.)\n\nPost by John Manning on\n\nYou made the right decision.

It was heartbreakingly sad.\n\nQuite the most incredible review I’ve read in an age, and I feel gutted for you to be there to see your – our – hero in such a stage of decline.\n\nI last saw him play at the Glastonbury Extravaganza in 2017 and the circumstances of the gig made it wonderful for me, even though Brian himself wasn’t in as good shape as he’d been in Glasgow the previous year. What made it magical was being able to take my kids to see the guy who was responsible, one way or another, for the two walls of CD shelves and LPs in the living room; the chance to hear Blondie shred things up, to watch BW perform while supporting my son on my shoulders (couldn’t do that now!)… the event made the show, if you get my drift.\n\nAt the same time I realised, then, that that would be the last time I saw BW, as his own ability to perform had slipped again and there was a risk that the magic would eke away completely after that. Reading your account, Andrew, I see I was right.\n\nAnd yet, I wish we could wind back to Glasgow 2002…"
