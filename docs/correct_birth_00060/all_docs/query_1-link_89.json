        "text": "Brian Wilson has been placed in a court-ordered conservatorship after it was revealed earlier this year that The Beach Boys member was diagnosed with dementia. As Rolling Stone reports, Wilson’s longtime publicist and manager, Jean Sievers, and longtime business manager, LeeAnn Hard, are in charge of the conservatorship, which applies to physical and medical needs.\n\nAccording to court filings, Wilson's children Carnie Wilson Bonfiglio and Wendy Wilson Knutson requested that “all of Brian’s children who wish to be added will be added to the text chain from his nurses providing updates about Brian.” The conservators are also required to run “all material healthcare decisions” by his children.\n\nThe initial petition was filed in February, with Sievers and Hard revealing that the 81-year-old musician is dealing with a “major neurocognitive disorder” and is “unable to properly provide for his own personal needs for physical health, food, clothing, or shelter.”\n\n“Mr. Wilson will remain in his home, and it is Ms. Sievers’ and Ms. Hard’s intent to ensure that all of Mr. Wilson’s daily living needs are satisfied, and he has the best possible care while remaining in his home,\" reads the petition."
