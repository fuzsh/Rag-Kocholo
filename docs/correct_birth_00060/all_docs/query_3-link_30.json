        "text": "Brian Douglas Wilson (born June 20, 1942) is an American musician, singer, songwriter and record producer who co-founded and led the rock band the Beach Boys. After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group. In addition to his lifelong struggles with mental illness, Wilson is known for his unorthodox approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques, and he is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century. One of Wilson's songs, Little Children, was arranged by The Wiggles on their Hoop-Dee-Doo It's a Wiggly Party album."
