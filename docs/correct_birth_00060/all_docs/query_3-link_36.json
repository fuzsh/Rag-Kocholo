        "text": "High up in the hills above Los Angeles, close to where Mulholland Drive reaches its apex, an ornate house nestles behind electronically controlled gates. It is eerily quiet save for the soft hiss of sprinklers, the distant hum of traffic. In the back garden, there is a large playhouse and a children's swing, but no sandpit. On a clear day, when the smog lifts over the city far below, you can probably see the ocean.\n\nInside, in the front room, a familiar-looking man sits. He is pale, and his voice is slightly slurred. His slippers are arranged neatly just beyond his feet so he can step into them when he pads to the fridge, or to answer the phone, or occasionally, to play the piano. From time to time, his hands beat out a slow, jerky rhythm on his knees. There is music playing constantly in his head, but he has not written a finished song for four years, nor a hit song for nearly 30. He remains, though, a genius. Perhaps, history may yet prove, the only true genius that pop music has produced.\n\nHis name is Brian Wilson, erstwhile Beach Boy, composer, singer, arranger, visionary.\n\nHe is talking, fitfully, sadly, about the moment some 30 years ago when his genius turned into a kind of madness. 'I guess, for a while, I didn't really want to be in the world,' he says, his eyes flitting from me down to his fidgeting hands, 'The world was just too scary.' His words trail off into silence, as if voicing these memories might reawaken their full horror. He looks fragile, slightly lost, almost childlike. He looks like one of his songs. 'There was pressure, always pressure,' he continues, the words coming in short breathless salvos. 'The people I was working with were pressurising me and that kind of scared me away from being creative.'\n\nThe people he was working with were the other Beach Boys: his brothers, Carl and Dennis; his cousin, Mike Love; and his friend, Al Jardine. Back in the mid-Sixties, when pop was young and full of seemingly eternal promise, the Beach Boys made music that effortlessly encapsulated that innocence, Songs like 'Barbara Ann', 'Surfin' USA', 'I Get Around', and the anthemic 'California Girls', all as bright and sun-kissed as their titles. Then, when pop grew vaultingly ambitious and darkly serious, Brian Wilson responded in kind, creating some of the most musically complex, and saddest, songs ever recorded.\n\nAt the height of his creativity, though, Wilson's genius fled as suddenly as it had blossomed. The melodies in his head were drowned out by the clamour of dark, disembodied voices, and the endless summer promised in so many Beach Boys' songs gave way to a long, dark winter of depression and debilitation. Pop's greatest songwriter stayed in his bedroom for three years. Stories circulated about his addiction to drugs and pornography, about his obesity and his insanity. For nigh on 20 years, the most gifted Beach Boy retreated, not just from the world of music, but from the world itself. And, the more he withdrew, the more the legend of Brian Wilson grew. 'I was in a bad place,' he says, 'I can see that now. Back then, I was just stuck there. Adrift.'\n\nNow, finally, it seems, Wilson is ready to embrace the world of performing again. After a well received mini-American tour last year, he arrives in London this month to play four sold-out, eagerly anticipated London shows.\n\nThough the past is still a scary country to him, he seems, tentatively at least, to finally be at peace with his own legacy. 'We'll do Pet Sounds,' he smiles, 'maybe all of it. And a few other big Beach Boys' songs. And one or two Brian Wilson songs. It'll be one big musical journey and people will hear the love in it. It's important to me that people hear the love.'\n\nMeeting Brian Wilson now is an oddly affecting experience. At times, he seems distracted, at others, so candid, and innocent, he could be a 12-year-old. He is palpably uncomfortable talking in any detail about his non-musical past, and will abruptly shift the subject if he feels questions are too probing. He is, though, a survivor, albeit a fragile and deeply damaged one.\n\nThe Brian Wilson story begins, like all great tragedies, with the sins of the father being foisted on to the sons. Murry Wilson hailed from Kansas, his family migrating to California in 1922 in the great flight from the dust bowl. A semi-successful songwriter, Murry was a tyrant who took out his frustrations on his three sons. He once tied his most gifted son to a tree as punishment for a petty misdemeanour. An early beating may have caused Brian's partial deafness. 'I was constantly afraid,' Brian says. 'That's what I remember most: being nervous and afraid.'\n\nBy adolescence, the precociously gifted teenager had learned to escape into music, to turn the melodies in his head into fully formed songs. In the Wilson family home in Hawthorne, California, overseen by the ever present Murry, the three brothers and their cousin began singing in the close harmony style of their favourite gospel group, the Four Freshmen. Carl, the youngest brother, introduced the others to the rhythm and blues of Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, but it was Brian who merged the two almost conflicting genres to create a unique sound that, as musician and fan, Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins, would point out 30 years later, 'didn't just eulogise cars, girls and surf, but sounded like cars, girls and surf'.\n\nThe latter element emerged almost by accident, though, when Dennis Wilson, the wildest of the Wilson boys, and the only actual surfer in the group, suggested they should write an ode to the pleasure of riding the big wave. The result, simply called 'Surfin\", was released on a small local label. When Carl Wilson heard it playing on the radio, he was so overwhelmed he threw up. Between early 1963 and the end of 1964, Brian wrote 16 hit singles and seven hit albums. Collectively, those same songs defined a particular kind of American mythology. As his later collaborator Van Dyke Parks put it: 'Brian's songs personified the Californian sense of place that all Americans used as their dream escape.'\n\nThe cost, though, to Wilson's already fragile sense of self was immense. In the studio, he was happy and at peace with himself; outside the studio, his life was fraying at the edges. At home, he lived as much as possible in his bedroom-cum-music room. It was a sanctuary from his father's rages, and the inspiration for his most beautiful and fragile early song, 'In My Room': 'There's a place where I can go/ To tell my secrets to...' The song was both escapist fantasy and premonition.\n\nIn the spring of 1964, after another row over the group's direction had ended in Brian breaking his own spectacles and stamping on them in a fit of impotent rage, he fired his father as the band's manager. Murry, broken, took to his bed for weeks with depression. By Christmas of that year, Brian, too, was confined to bed in the family home following his first nervous breakdown. He had cracked up on a flight to Texas where the band were scheduled to play some shows, and ended up rolling in the aisle, screaming and sobbing like a distraught baby.\n\nHe was replaced for live performances by country and western singer Glen Campbell and, while the Beach Boys toured their bright and breezy, airbrushed American songs, Brian stayed in Los Angeles, and watched the world of pop shift on its axis. Hanging out with the Byrds and visiting members of the Beatles, he tried LSD for the first time in 1965. As his first wife, Marilyn, later put it, 'Brian saw God, and cried for days on end.' You can hear the psychic shift in the spacey, shifting opening chords of 'California Girls', released that summer: the first taste of the richness and complexity that was to come. When I ask him if he has any regrets, he answers quickly, 'Only one - taking LSD. It really fouled up my mind.'\n\nWilson used LSD and marijuana, Marilyn would say later, 'to medicate his pain'. But, like Syd Barrett, the lost genius of English psychedelic pop, Wilson's quest for the ultimate altered state would be his long-term undoing. In the first brief summer of experimentation, though, he wrote, arranged, produced and sang on the album that would become his, and pop's landmark. After hearing the Beatles' Rubber Soul album on marijuana, and being 'blown away by it', he announced to his wife that he was 'going to make the greatest pop record ever'. Then, he set about doing just that. 'Pet Sounds was spontaneous,' he says now, his face brightening for the first time since we met. 'People ask me: \"What was going though your head?\" Well, nothing was going through my head. The only thing I was thinking was, \"Come on! Come on!\" I felt like I had so much music to get out. I was also smoking a lot. Pet Sounds was me saying, \"Brian Wilson's love is yours...\"'\n\nIt was also, he says, 'an ode to Phil Spector', the producer whose trademark wall of sound became an obsession with Wilson. 'I was obsessed totally with Spector, with the energy of his music. That's why I called the album Pet Sounds - the same initials as Phil Spector.' Now regarded by many critics as the greatest pop record ever made, Pet Sounds was most memorably described by the writer Nick Cohn as 'sad songs about loneliness and heartache; sad songs even about happiness'. Songs like 'God Only Knows' and the eerily prescient 'I Just Wasn't Made For These Times'. Though Wilson says now that he had given himself 'a pep talk for months' before springing this new direction on the rest of the group, his confidence was shaken by their initial dismissal of his work.\n\nTony Asher, Brian's co-writer at the time, stomped out of the studio in frustration, after he heard the others sniggering between takes, and asking: 'Why are we recording these stupid songs?' Mike Love, who clung most strongly to the old ideal of the formulaic pop song, called it 'Brian's ego music' and described some of the lyrics as 'nauseating'. Commercially, too, Brian Wilson's sad, beautiful and extraordinarily complex songs fell on deaf ears. The album sold poorly, and eight weeks after its release, Capitol Records rushed out a greatest hits package to compensate.\n\n'It was tough,' he says now, his face clouding, 'I mean, I had nothing to go on but my own instinct. I knew it was a leap and it was a risk, and that maybe the audience wouldn't come with us, but I had to trust in myself. It was scary, though. I was smoking every day which made me get deeper into the music, but made me more scared, too. People say, there was something in the air back then, and I say, yeah, marijuana! That's what was in the air.'\n\nAnd, for a while, it helped, he says, 'get him right inside the music'. He began working almost immediately on the follow-up to Pet Sounds, a single song pieced together from countless recorded fragments of music. It took six months to complete and cost the unprecedented sum of $50,000. The end result was a three-and-a-half-minute single,'Good Vibrations', in which the old Beach Boys' sound - cars, girls and surf - was filtered through a psychedelic gauze that was both mesmeric and intoxicating. 'That was a scary record, real scary' he grins. 'It blew everyone away, me included.' 'Good Vibrations' was released at the tail-end of 1966, and shot to the top of the charts in America and Britain. At 24, Brian Wilson had made his last No1 record.\n\nWhat happened next is the stuff of pop mythology. With a new lyrical collaborator, Van Dyke Parks, an elfin Pennsylvanian who someone once described as 'Edith Sitwell on speed', Brian Wilson set about constructing his answer to the Beatles' Sergeant Pepper, a concept album originally known as Dumb Angel, later retitled Smile. It would, he said, be 'a teenage symphony to God'. Simultaneously, though, his behaviour was becoming more unpredictable and eccentric. He opened a health food emporium called The Radiant Radish, and would often turn up, stoned and overweight, to do a stint on the till. 'This is a guy who Leonard Bernstein had just called one of the true American treasures,' the Beach Boys' promoter, Fred Vail, quipped, 'and he's behind the counter selling vitamins.' In his home studio, he had builders construct a huge sandpit in which the grand piano sat. He wanted, he said, 'to feel the beach beneath his feet'. Van Dyke Parks refused to work at the piano because he kept stepping on dog shit left by Brian's beloved pooches.\n\nWilson's drug intake was now epic even by the standards of the time: $2,000 worth of hash was purchased to kickstart proceedings on Smile, alongside a batch of LSD and the prescribed amphetamines he now took daily. 'We smoked a lot and got into a good place with the hash,' Brian told Steven Gaines, author of the definitive Beach Boys book, Heroes & Villains. 'We lay on the floor recording with the microphones about a foot from the ground. We were so stoned we had to lie down. We got to the point where we thought this was the way to record. We got halfway through the album before we decided to stand up because we got sleepy.'\n\nAn orchestral string section was summoned to work on a piece called 'Fire', part of a proposed 'Elements' suite. Brian insisted that everyone present, including the ageing violinists, should wear firemen's helmets. Bright red ones were duly purchased from a Hollywood toy store. He then instructed the caretaker to actually start a small fire in a bucket in the middle of the studio so the musicians could smell smoke, all the better to recreate the experience. They gamely acceded. Brian told Gaines: 'There were musicians smelling smoke with fire hats on. They were firemen. Roaaar! Roaaar! The violins were screeching, reaching upward, rolling down... Whoooorrr... It was sick. I mean, it was sick... I started thinking, Oh God, I'm flipping here...' That evening, Wilson heard that a building nearby had burned down during the recording session. Pure coincidence turned to paranoia in his addled brain, and he tried to set fire to all the Smile tapes, then locked the remains in a vault. Fire, cleansing and destructive, became his element, just as water had once been his formative musical motif.\n\nBrian spent the next three years in bed, paralysed by anxiety, bingeing on food and drugs. He played Phil Spector's 'Be My Baby' over and over - 'it was the anointed song'. At times, he heard Spector's voice taunting him. At other times, Murry's voice whispered in his ear. 'I was paralysed by fear,' he says now. What, I ask apologetically, were you afraid of? 'I was afraid of Phil Spector. I thought he was going to kill me.'\n\nOn 29 April, 1968, his first daughter, Carnie, was born, but fatherhood did little to soothe his troubled psyche. The Beach Boys, meanwhile, toured without him, but the group was a fractured entity: Mike Love had embraced the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi; Dennis Wilson was locked into a lifestyle that redefined the term, sex and drugs and rock'n'roll - along the way, he had befriended an illiterate ex-con and would-be recording artist who called himself the Wizard, and whose real name was Charles Manson. Manson's self-styled 'family' of mainly young, promiscuous girls lived in Dennis Wilson's Hollywood home for most of 1968. They spent $100,000 of his money that summer, and wrecked his uninsured $21,000 Mercedes-Benz. Undeterred, Dennis introduced the Wizard to his friend, the record producer Terry Melcher, who tried unsuccessfully to record some of Manson's half-formed songs. Dennis even took Manson to the Beach Boys' studio underneath Brian's bedroom, where they cut some demos to tout around Los Angeles record companies. No one was interested. Manson's frustration turned to a dark, simmering anger. Scared, Dennis high-tailed it out of town. The Manson family returned to their ranch out in the desert, where Charlie hatched his revenge.\n\nIn the meantime, the Beach Boys recorded one of Manson's songs, the eerie 'Cease to Exist' for their 20/20 album, changing the lyrics to 'cease to resist', and enraging the author. Released as the flip side to 'Bluebirds over the Mountain', the song charted at No61. The Beach Boys had made Manson a footnote in pop history.\n\nThe following year, on 9 August, members of the Manson Family, high on LSD and fired by their leader's vengeful rhetoric, pulled into the driveway of 10050 Cielo Drive, the home that Melcher had rented to film-maker Roman Polanski and his pregnant wife, the actress Sharon Tate. Polanski was abroad filming, but Tate was there with four friends. They were all slaughtered, and the word 'Pigs' was scrawled in blood on the living room wall. Susan Atkins, one of the murderers, would later say: 'Charlie picked that house to instill fear into Terry Melcher, because Terry had given us his word on a few things and never came through with them.' After the short summer of love, the darkness had descended on the hippie dream.\n\nThat same year, Brian Wilson learnt that his father, in a final act of vengeance, had sold the entire Beach Boys' publishing rights for $70,000, telling his distraught son: 'They're never going to amount to anything.' (In 1999, the Beach Boys' back catalogue was valued at $22 million.) Brian remained in his room, writing countless half-finished songs that no one bar his brothers would ever hear.\n\nIn 1972, the group released 'Surf's Up', the epic title track with its baroque lyricism and shifting, layered melodies, dating from the legendary Smile sessions. 'When I listen to that song,' Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins once enthused, 'I hear America. He was trying to sum up America, to take Mark Twain into rock'n'roll. And, he almost got there.' The album also included the song that would become Brian Wilson's farewell song to the Beach Boys, and the fading Californian dreamscape he had helped create. It was called, simply, 'Til I Die'. 'I'm a cork on the ocean,' he sang, 'floating over the raging sea.'\n\nThe following year, Murry Wilson died of a heart attack, aged 53. Only Carl attended the funeral. By now, Brian's behaviour was so unpredictable that his wife, Marilyn, approaching the end of her tether, hired Dr Eugene Landy, a psychologist who had successfully treated other troubled stars such as Rod Steiger and Alice Cooper. Landy's bullying regime of exercise and health food seemed to work wonders and a slimmed down Brian Wilson was back on stage with the Beach Boys within months. One critic, though, described his role as that of 'a performing bear'. 'I wasn't ready,' he tells me. 'It was pressure again. People pushing me. I used drugs to escape. Then they sort of took over.'\n\nThe pressure mounted when the group signed to CBS, with a clause that stipulated Brian Wilson write 70 per cent of the material. He cried as he signed the contract. In 1978, Marilyn left with the two children after Brian offered the young Carnie an unspecified drug.\n\nBrian was hospitalised for two months for severe drug dependency. Released, he existed on a diet of prescribed drugs, steaks and cigarettes, ballooning to over 300lb, and living like a wealthy bum. He took to roaming the night-time streets of Los Angeles, high on cocaine and alcohol, frequenting massage parlours. He grew afraid of water, refusing to wash or shower. On stage, he often jumped around, waving his hands in the air, and pulling faces, too stoned to be embarrassed. During a Beach Boys' show in London in 1978, Mike Love, the group's resident transcendental meditator, was so incensed by his cousin's erratic behaviour that he tried to overturn the piano with his bare hands.\n\n'He got mad at me for smoking too much,' Brian smiles like a naughty child. 'I was smoking, and he was choking. And, boy, he got real mad. It wasn't,' he adds, seemingly unaware of the irony, 'appropriate behaviour.'\n\nOn 5 November, 1982, his brother Carl, who had tried to help him more than anyone else, was elected by the rest of the group to tell Brian that he was no longer a Beach Boy. Bereft, Brian returned to the only other family he had, Landy's entourage. In his Hawaiian clinic, Landy bullied and cajoled his reluctant charge until he came off drugs and shed his excess pounds.\n\n'Brian Wilson,' he said at the time, ' is a perfect example of the fact that in my field I am an artist.' Brian, though, told a French magazine: 'Today I want to go places, but I can't because of the doctor. I feel like a prisoner and I don't know where it's going to end. He'd put the police on me if I took off and he'd put me in the funny farm.' He concluded by asking the interviewer: 'Do you have any uppers?'\n\nInevitably, the most gifted Beach Boy reluctantly rejoined the group who were riding high on the back of yet another successfully marketed greatest hits package. The original line-up played their last gig on Independence Day, 1983. On 28 December that same year, Dennis, the only Beach Boy who had lived the surfing lifestyle, drowned while diving off his old yacht. Brian sank further into depression. In 1984, at age 42, he was officially diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and a manic depressive. The doctors also found evidence of brain damage caused by excessive and sustained drug abuse.\n\nIn the 10 years that followed his diagnosis, Brian's life veered constantly between the stable and the surreal. Landy appointed his team of 'psycho roadies' to monitor his charge's behaviour around the clock, and appointed himself as Brian's creative collaborator. A solo album costing a million dollars was completed and released to favourable reviews. Landy approached Richard Dreyfuss and John Hurt to play himself and Brian in a proposed Hollywood film. His bills burgeoned to $20,000 a month, and he was also managing the songwriter's business affairs.\n\nThen, in 1990, after hearing that Landy had allegedly persuaded Brian to redraft his will, the family filed suits to regain control of Brian's life. The court ruled that Brian should not see Landy for three years. The psychologist, already stung by a previous charge of clinical malpractice, retreated to his Hawaiian clinic, where he still practises psychotherapy. 'I don't regret it,' Brian says of that strange time. 'I loved the guy, he saved me. Exercise saved me. There is no drug in the world like it. He pushed me beyond my limits and stopped me being fearful of the world.'\n\nSince the departure of Landy, Brian seems finally to have found some degree of peace , some measure of contentment and creative fulfilment. His second wife, Melinda, with whom he has two young children, takes charge of his daily regimen of exercise and massage. He is still in therapy. He has made up with his grown-up daughters, Carnie and Wendy, who he did not see throughout the Landy years, and who have subsequently found success of their own as part of the pop group Wilson Phillips. Though palpably fragile and still endearingly childlike, he seems remarkably free of regrets.\n\nIn 1991, Brian filed a successful suit against the company which purchased his Sixties songs, winning them back at a cost of $10m. Two years later, the ever combative Mike Love sued him for royalties on 93 songs he claimed to have co-written and not received credit for. The court ruled in Love's favour, and Brian shelled out $5m. Within a few weeks, they were writing new songs together. It would not be overstating the case to say that, in more ways than one, Brian does not really exist in the material world.\n\nIn 1997, his mother, Audrey, passed away and his beloved brother, Carl, died of cancer. He tries, he says, not 'to think about the bad stuff too much', and has learnt 'to chase the negative thoughts away when they surface'. His face, though, darkens into a troubled frown when he tells me this.\n\nIn 1998, he released his second solo album, Imagination, to good reviews. He accepts that his best work is behind him, but finds it 'hard to live up to my name. I know I have to,' he frowns, 'but I don't think I'm going to be able to it this time around.' These days, he spends a lot of time 'sitting and thinking', and waiting for inspiration. 'I have writer's block,' he says at one point, out of the blue, 'I haven't been able to write anything for three years. I think I need the demons in order to write, but the demons have gone. It bothers me a lot. I've tried and tried, but I just can't seem to find a melody.'\n\nThose words haunt me for days afterwards. But, in truth, they were not said with any sense of deep regret, more in an almost quizzical tone. It is a tone that sums up Brian Wilson's relation to music, and to the world, right now. He is easily the most humble, as well as the most gifted musician I have ever interviewed, and this, I think, is part of the reason so much of his life has been spent in thrall to controlling figures less talented than himself: his father, his group, his former shrink. I hope he has finally found some contentment. I hope, too, that he no longer feels he has to live up to his legend: he created more than enough brilliant pop music when he was young, and we can ask no more of him.\n\nThen, I think of something else he said, towards the end of our meeting, right at the moment when I thought his interest in the interview had waned to the point of boredom. 'I think maybe pop has had its time,' he mused. 'Pop music has been exhausted. The innocence has been exhausted. I think we've lost the ability to be blown away by music. I mean, who is ever going to blow our minds like Phil Spector did?'\n\nOr, I venture, like Brian Wilson did? He smiles and looks away. 'I guess so... I mean, Pet Sounds would be in the all-time Top Five, right?'\n\nI nod, and say: 'Top three, easy. Maybe even right at the top.' He seems genuinely bowled over. 'You really think so? Aw, man, that's something, huh?' It sure is, Brian, it sure is."
