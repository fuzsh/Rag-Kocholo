        "text": "Wouldn't it be nice if we had better treatments for Alzheimer's disease? The thousands of dollars raised after Brian Wilson's performance in Jackson can help make that goal a reality.\n\nWilson, a legendary singer-songwriter and co-founder of the Beach Boys, took the stage at Thalia Mara Hall on April 28 in a benefit concert for the MIND (Memory Impairment and Neurodegenerative Dementia Research) Center at UMMC.\n\nWilson, at piano, and fellow Beach Boy Al Jardine\n\n“We were thrilled to have Brian Wilson perform this evening,” said Dr. Thomas Mosley, director of the MIND Center. “He has written and arranged music that has been a gift to the world for many years.”\n\nWilson opened the concert with “Heroes and Villains,” an appropriate piece as generous support from businesses and citizens grossed more than $425,000 to defeat neurodegenerative dementia.\n\n“The MIND Center is a national leader in Alzheimer's care and research located right here in Mississippi,” Mosley said. “The proceeds from the concert will help us cure, slow the progression of and prevent dementing illnesses.”\n\nFellow Beach Boys Al Jardine and Blondie Chaplin sang and danced, danced, danced with their guitars as Wilson played his white grand piano. A nine-piece band joined the trio as they performed from a 50-year catalog featuring the band's earliest hits to Wilson's recent compositions.\n\nEnjoying The Mind Center's Catch a Wave Sponsor Reception are, from left, Emily and Dr. Tom Mosley and his parents, Mattie and Tommy Mosley.\n\nNext door, the Mississippi Museum of Art Garden was a sunny California beach party with a steel drum band, surfboards and beach balls during a pre-concert sponsor reception. A few lucky fans had the opportunity to meet-and-greet with Wilson, Jardine and Chaplin before the show.\n\nFormer UMMC vice chancellor Dr. James Keeton thanked Governor Phil Bryant, First Lady Deborah Bryant and members of the state legislature in attendance for their continued support of UMMC and the MIND Center.\n\n“You are all here tonight to help us in our quest to find a cure for Alzheimer's,” Keeton said."
