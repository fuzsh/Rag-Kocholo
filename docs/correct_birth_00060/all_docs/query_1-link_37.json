        "text": "UPDATED with latest: At a hearing today, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Gus T. May placed Beach Boys legend Brian Wilson in a conservatorship. The arrangement is to be overseen by the 81-year-old musician’s longtime publicist Jean Sievers and manager LeeAnn Hard.\n\n“I find from clear and convincing evidence that a conservatorship of the person is necessary,” said May at the hearing.\n\nWilson has reportedly consented to the conservatorship.\n\nA doctor’s statement in the filing said that Wilson suffers from a “major neurocognitive disorder,” is taking medication for dementia and “is unable to properly provide for his own personal needs for physical health, food, clothing, or shelter.”\n\nHis wife, Melinda Ledbetter Wilson, died in January.\n\nPREVIOUSLY on February 16: Beach Boy founder Brian Wilson is suffering from a “major neurocognitive disorder” and should be placed in a conservatorship in light of the recent death of his wife and primary caregiver Melinda Ledbetter Wilson, the rock icon’s family and management team says.\n\nA petition for conservatorship was filed by Wilson’s management team Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. Wilson’s family confirmed the move in posts on Wilson’s social media accounts, including Instagram, last night.\n\nIn medical papers filed with the petition, the 81-year-old Wilson is said to be taking medication for dementia.\n\n“Following the passing of Brian’s beloved wife Melinda, after careful consideration and consultation among Brian, his seven children, Gloria Ramos and Brian’s doctors (and consistent with family processes put in place by Brian and Melinda), we are confirming that longtime Wilson family representatives LeeAnn Hard and Jean Sievers will serve as Brian’s co-conservators of the person,” the statement reads.\n\n“This decision was made to ensure that there will be no extreme changes to the household and Brian and the children living at home will be taken care of and remain in the home where they are cared for by Gloria Ramos and the wonderful team at the house who have been in place for many years helping take care of the family.\n\n“Brian will be able to enjoy all of his family and friends and continue to work on current projects as well as participate in any activities he chooses.”\n\nLeeAnn Hard is Wilson’s business manager, and Jean Sievers his manager and publicist. Gloria Ramos was Wilson’s housekeeper and caretaker.\n\nThe petition asks that Hard and Sievers be named Wilson’s conservators to oversee personal and medical decisions. Wilson’s estate was not included in the petition because the assets have already been placed in a trust, with manager Hard as trustee.\n\nWhen Ledbetter Wilson died last month, Wilson wrote on social media, “My heart is broken. Our five children and I are just in tears. We are lost. Melinda was more than my wife. She was my savior. She gave me the emotional security I needed to have a career.”"
