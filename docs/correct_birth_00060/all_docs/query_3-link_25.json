        "text": "BRIAN WILSON, leader of THE BEACH BOYS, was born in 1942, and raised in Hawthorne, outside Los Angeles. He was a musical genius — an eccentric, lonely, withdrawn obsessive, given to panic attacks and stage fright, who feared large ocean waves, and did not surf at all, but wrote and produced catchy songs about surfing, hot-rodding, girl-watching… little jewels of the fun, casual, social world that people across the U.S. and around the world associated with California.\n\nAnd the Beach Boys, through Capitol Records, helped define “the California sound,” sold 100 million records, and convinced tens of thousands of people to try surfing. Some of Brian Wilson’s best songs also have a wistful sense, a melancholy mixed right in with the joy.\n\nThe biggest single influence on Brian was a man he came to hate and fear — his father, Murry Wilson. Murry worked for Goodyear, then started his own company, Always Better Lasting Equipment (ABLE) which rented out building equipment for construction. But Murry Wilson’s supreme ambition was to be a great songwriter. He was a talented, headstrong, driven man. He gave Brian and Brian’s younger brothers, Dennis and Carl Wilson, all he had, but he cruelly abused them, too — Brian most of all.\n\nBrian’s mother Audree was a much kinder, more gracious person and she had a lot of interesting tidbits of information, such as the fact that dogs pick up vibrations from people, good and bad.\n\nMusic was huge in the Wilson home. Murry and Audree played George Gershwin songs on the phonograph, and Les Paul and Mary Ford songs. Murry played his own songs on the piano and Audree would join in on the organ. They’d often asked Brian to sing aloud a Rosemary Clooney love song.\n\nBrian, Dennis and Carl all had good voices, but there was something special about Brian. He had perfect pitch and seemed mesmerized by music, captivated by its sound and determined to understand its structure. He’d stay in his room for hours and hours, lost in his music.\n\nBut at first, singing was just a hobby. Brian, Dennis and Carl would sing together — Everly Brothers hits, or doo-wop. At age 12, Brian began writing songs. He loved a jazz-inflected barbershop group called The Four Freshmen, especially the way they used falsetto. He’d take apart a Four Freshmen song, rearrange the harmonies, and the Wilson brothers would sing it. But no one in the family was thinking of this as a career.\n\nThen Brian Wilson was transfixed by the sound of Chuck Berry and Eddie Cochrane singing rock’n’roll. He wondered: How would it sound if you mixed Chuck Berry with The Four Freshmen, on a record produced by Phil Spector? For his 16th birthday, Brian got from his parents a two-track tape recorder, and he began experimenting with it.\n\nDennis Wilson was the first to suggest they form a singing group and try to break into show business. In 1960 and ’61, Dennis urged Brian and their cousin, Mike Love, to write a song, and try to get it on the radio. Brian and Mike came up with a song called “Surfin,’” played it and called themselves “The Pendletones.” Mike Love sang lead. Brian played bass, keyboards and sang falsetto. Dennis played drums. Carl played lead guitar.\n\nWhen Brian’s parents went on a visit to Mexico, they left their sons some money in case of emergency. Brian and Dennis decided the “emergency” was to make a professional-quality recording of “Surfin’” They rented some equipment and made their demo.\n\nMurry Wilson used some connections of his to get the demo record listened to by a few record labels. The song was put out by a minor label, Candix Records — and made it to #75 in the country. Candix also decided “The Pendletones” would now be called “The Beach Boys”\n\nBrian and one of his brothers were driving around in the rain one night in a 1957 car, when “Surfin’” came on the radio. Brian’s brother said he never, before or since, saw Brian as happy as during those two-and-a-half minutes.\n\nMurry now made himself the group’s manager. This made a certain sense; Murry knew something about the music business, and was highly motivated to represent the Beach Boys. Murry did a pretty good job with the nuts and bolts. He got professional sound-quality demos made of “Surfin’ Safari” and “409” — and got them to producers at Capitol Records.\n\nBut in another sense, it was a disastrous choice to make Murry the band manager. The only way he knew how to act around his sons was brusque and domineering. Also, as manager he had to know what their plans were, what their latest songs were, how close they were to cutting their next record. These were things Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson and Mike Love wanted to keep private, and Murry snooped without apology on their private conversations, insisting that to be a good manager of the group, he had to know everything about them.\n\nWhen Capitol Records put those “Surfin’ Safari” and “409” out as a singles and they got good radio play, Capitol Records asked the Beach Boys for a full 12-song LP album. The band was commercially launched. Now they needed to practice their instruments, get band uniforms, and figure out how to travel from gig to gig. But most of all, they needed new songs, and Brian Wilson wrote them.\n\nBrian wrote songs about the beach, and hot rod cars, though none of the Beach Boys spent much time at the beach. Dennis and Mike Love could surf a little. Brian’s mother, who’d come to California dirt-poor from Kansas, was the only one in the family who’d spent much time at the beach. She’d once lived in a tent city, at Seal Beach, California, and her memories of it were painful. Brian tried surfing briefly in 1963, and fell off his surfboard. But the beach was a muse that Brian kept returning to. Beach culture was something Californians were proud of, and that people all over America admired, or were curious about.\n\nBetween the founding of the group in 1961 and the Pet Sounds album in 1966, Wilson wrote “Surfin’ Safari,” “409,” “Surfer Girl,” “Catch a Wave,” “Little Deuce Coupe,” “Fun, Fun, Fun,” “Don’t Worry, Baby,” “All Summer Long” and “California Girls.”\n\nWhen his song “Surf City” was a #1 hit in 1963, Brian felt pressure to create a #1 hit in 1964. When he did that with “I Get Around” in ’64, he felt pressure to get another #1 song in ’65. He did that with “Help Me Rhonda,” — and felt he needed a #1 hit in 1966. Always, there was the pressure, from his bandmates, from his fans, his father, from people at Capitol Records…\n\nPlaying with sounds, composing and arranging melodies, was pure pleasure for Brian — but the strains of touring and of avoiding crazed fans and personal conflicts was much harder. He used marijuana to help him relax, then became addicted to it. In 1964, on a Beach Boys tour, Brian Wilson had a nervous breakdown on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston. In the wake of that freak out, he put his foot down; he would NOT keep touring. He wasn’t a great live performer anyway.\n\nBrian loved to have the run of a studio, using a menagerie of instruments and sound machines to try to capture what was in his head. Could you get a piano to give a little different sound by plucking the strings differently? How could you get a regular guitar to sound like a steel guitar? Violins, saxophones, pianos, oboes, drums, guitars, vibraphones. Multiple takes, layered over each other.\n\nBrian was like a kid in a sandbox. In fact, Brian redid his den at home, so that it had a giant sandbox in it. He liked to feel the sand under his feet and in between his toes as he created. He created a beach without people.\n\nBrian warned people that he might quit the music business. He was a mix of goofy enthusiasm and bouts of despair. In early 1965, when the Righteous Brothers hit “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling” came out, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, co-writers of the song, got a phone call from Brian in their New York apartment — at 3 a.m.\n\nCynthia Weil picked up the phone in her sleep, and Brian was gushing “This is Brian Wilson! YOUR SONG IS THE GREATEST RECORD EVER! I was ready to quit the music business, but this has inspired me to write again. I want to write with you guys!”\n\nCynthia Weil, still half-asleep, asked: “Now?”\n\nWhen Murry Wilson’s intrusive presence became unbearable, Brian fired him as the band’s manager. Whenever he sensed discord, Brian retreated to his music. Several times, he listened to “Be My Baby” by the Ronettes 100 times in a single day. He told people, “Music is God’s voice.”\n\n“Pet Sounds” in 1966, the band’s greatest record, was a difficult record to make. While the rest of the Beach Boys toured Japan, Brian was in Studio 3, at the United Western Recorders Studio in Los Angeles, with a great backing band “The Wrecking Crew.” Brian wanted to mix into his songs not only odd instruments like harpsichords and flutes, but also the sounds of bicycle bells and dog whistles. He was thinking a lot in those days about the way that everyone has certain sounds they love, certain pet sounds…\n\nOn the “Pet Sounds” song “Caroline, No” Brian recorded backup vocals by his dogs, Banana and Louie. Mike Love, who talks a lot about peace and transcendental meditation, lost his temper over Brian’s self-absorption and quirky sound choices. At one point he said witheringly: “Who’s gonna hear this shit? The ears of a dog?”\n\nOn “Pet Sounds,” Wilson wrote and produced two perfect pop songs “Wouldn’t It Be Nice” and “God Only Knows.” Capitol Records didn’t promote “Pet Sounds” well, and sales were flat. But other musicians loved it. Paul McCartney was known to adore the album. The arrangements were lush, the harmonies clean, and the songs more personal than the old beach music. Brian Wilson was coming closer to showing his fans his true self, and he’d found a way to do it that was sonically gorgeous.\n\nThe album nodded at drug use (“This is the worst trip I’ve ever been on” noted the song “Sloop John B”.) But if the album made gestures at psychedelia, it was really too personal to be a psychedelic album. “Pet Sounds” was one-of-a-kind and will always remain so.\n\nBut the biggest Beach Boys song of 1966 was “Good Vibrations.” It was their most complex song, the song in which Brian Wilson, at age 23, showed a complete mastery of composing, arranging and recording technique.\n\nHe had a set of themes and sounds that inspired him: what his mother had told him about good and bad vibrations; pop-romantic lyrics on that theme from Mike Love; musical fragments that Brian recorded both with the Beach Boys and with session musicians, in four different studios, over nine months of 1966. Brian had his brother Carl sing lead. He had rich sounds from a cello and eerie sounds from an Electro-Theremin. Ninety hours in various studios produced 70 hours of music on tape, which Brian whittled down to a glorious three minutes and 35 seconds.\n\nThe finished song, “Good Vibrations,” is a song of parts, a tiny symphony. It keeps shifting in tone and mood but hangs gloriously together. It’s somehow both innocent and sophisticated. And to Brian Wilson’s great relief, it went to #1."
