        "text": "As the cofounder, co-vocalist, songwriter, and producer of The Beach Boys through the â60s, Brian Wilson radically expanded ideas of what pop music could be. But for all the sunshine, his songs also contained an underlying darkness, stemming from the struggles that began in Wilsonâs childhood and nearly derailed his career. Born in Inglewood, California, in 1942, Wilson was a musical prodigy who began writing songs at the age of 12. Under the direction of their controlling, abusive father Murry, Wilson and his brothers Carl and Dennis formed The Beach Boys with their cousin Mike Love and friend Al Jardine in 1961. They soon became one of the decadeâs most formidable hit machines. Yet even amid the groupâs string of smashes about surfing and hot rods, there were subtler songs like 1964âs âDonât Worry Babyâ and others that pointed to Wilsonâs growing sophistication as a writer/arranger and to the more melancholy music to come. Some of Wilsonâs most iconic releases arrived in 1966 with Pet Sounds and the single âGood Vibrations,â works that remain astonishing for their symphonic scope and innovative instrumentation (theremin included). Yet Wilson's worsening mental health led to his retreat from public life. In 1988, Wilson ended decades as rockâs most famous recluse, released his self-titled solo debut, and began an initially tentative but ultimately triumphant return to the music world. Along with many live performances of Pet Sounds, Wilsonâs belated victory lap included the completion of Smile, The Beach Boys album that contained his wildest musical adventures but was previously released as the unfinished Smiley Smile (1967). Even more thrilling was the sight and sound of a healthier, happier Wilson sharing his music again."
