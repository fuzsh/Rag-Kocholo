        "text": "Brian Wilson (born June 20th 1942) is a Californian musician and former frontman of The Beach Boys.\n\nNet worth: Brian Wilson has a net worth of $75 million according to Celebrity Net Worth (2015).\n\nMusical career: Brian Wilson started with him, his brothers Carl and Dennis, Mike Love and Al Jardine, in 1961 thought they were named The Pendletones. They then released debut single 'Surfin'' and impressed Brian's father so much so that he helped them sign to Candix Records, who went on to change their name to the Beach Boys without them knowing.\n\nTheir first album, 'Surfin' Safari', was released by Capitol in 1962. Wilson fought to be head of production on the record.\n\nFollowing records included 'Surfin' U.S.A.' and 'Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)'.\n\nWhile still in the band, he tried to work with other people separately including Jan and Dean, to much upset from the label.\n\nMeanwhile, The Beach Boys were touring a lot which was an emotionally and mental struggle for Wilson who wanted to concentrate on songwriting. He was briefly replaced by Glen Campbell and then Bruce Johnston.\n\n1966 saw the band release the critically acclaimed 'Pet Sounds', which the rest of the band were initially averse to.\n\nWilson's next project for the Beach Boys, 'Smile', became a point of much conflict within the band, with it eventually getting cancelled in 1967.\n\nThe band began to struggle financially and Wilson's interest in the band gradually began to wane, often locking himself up at home particularly after the death of his father in 1973. He did, however, spend much time drinking with the Hollywood Vampires, Alice Cooper and Iggy Pop.\n\nHe eventually turned to a side project with Bruce Johnston and Terry Melcher's Equinox Records named California Music. However, he was forced to quit the project by the Beach Boys' management, who insisted he turn his attention back to the group.\n\nIt was then he was referred to corrupt therapist Eugene Landy who, despite eventually damaging his mental state further, did manage to help Wilson regain some motivation and the band released '15 Big Ones' for their anniversary in 1976. He did, however, appear solo on 'Saturday Night Live' that year.\n\nEventually, Landy had him fired from the Beach Boys. He returned for Live Aid in 1985 and their subsequent self-titled album.\n\nHe then went solo, releasing his self-titled debut album on Sire Records in 1988 and during this time Landy's influence became increasingly clear in his lyrics and his behaviour, having been prescribed a large dosage of psychotropics.\n\nHis memoir, 'Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story', was released in 1991 though it is largely believed to have been written by Landy, who he soon severed ties with.\n\nIn 1995, Wilson released the 'I Just Wasn't Made for These Times' soundtrack and the Van Dyke Parks produced 'Orange Crate Art'. In 1997, he sang on Belinda Carlisle's 'California'.\n\nThe following year he released 'Imagination', but was forced to undergo vocal training for his damaged voice. During this time, he began to perform regularly for the first time in years.\n\n2004 saw the release of 'Gettin' In Over My Head', featuring Elton John, Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton.\n\nThat year he finally went back to 'Brian Wilson Presents Smile' and toured with the album worldwide. The Beach Boys version of the album, 'The Smile Sessions', came out in 2011.\n\nWilson returned to the Beach Boys for 2012's 'That's Why God Made the Radio' and in 2015 he released his eleventh solo venture 'No Pier Pressure'.\n\nPersonal life: Brian Wilson grew up in California with his mother Audree and father Murry. He was always musical as a child, but became partially deaf after an unknown accident. His father was physically abusive, but provided Wilson with toy accordion lessons and choir practise. In Hawthorne High school he played football, baseball and did running, and started playing piano after leaving school. He often recorded himself singing with friends and encouraged his brothers to join him as a band.\n\nHe studied psychology at El Camino College.\n\nWilson has struggled a lot over his career with mental health and addiction problems. He had a nervous breakdown while touring in 1964, and began taking cannabis soon after which he claimed improved his songwriting. In 1965, he began taking LSD, but the drug subsequently gave him lifelong auditory hallucinations.\n\nAround 1968, he also began taking cocaine among many other narcotics, became suicidal, and was eventually admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Has been diagnosed as a manic-depressive with schizoaffective disorder. He sought care from a psychologist named Eugene Landy in the 80s, who caused Wilson's mental condition to deteriorate and managed to obtain control of every aspect of his life including his money.\n\nWilson's first marriage was to Marilyn Rovell in 1964, though that ended 15 years later. They had two daughters, Carnie and Wendy.\n\nHe married Melinda Ledbetter in 1995 and they have five adopted children: Daria, Delanie, Dylan, Dash and Dakota.\n\nBiography by Contactmusic.com"
