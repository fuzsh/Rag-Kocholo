        "text": "Brian Wilson\n\nI can remember when I was a little girl, my father and I would listen to Beach Boys’ albums together in our living room. My favorite song was Kokomo and I would sing it all the time. I loved the cheerful sounds of the music and the fun loving attitude that The Beach Boys portrayed. As I grew older, I still loved The Beach Boys, and I continued to listen to their music frequently. The more I learned about music the more amazing their music seemed. The tight harmonies and unique instruments made each song unique and made me more and more interested in finding out how they were created.\n\nBrian Wilson is the creative genius that wrote and produced much of The Beach Boys’ music. Despite being near deaf in one ear, Wilson managed to not only provide the Beach Boys with countless hit records, but also made a major impact on popular music as a whole. His music influenced most major pop musicians today and his harmonies are used in songs sung by such pop acts as N’Sync and The Backstreet Boys. Even the Beatles admit that they felt threatened by the Beach Boys and without the creative challenge that Brian Wilson posed, both Revolver and Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band would have never come into being.\n\nBorn in Inglewood, California, June 10, 1942, Brian was the first child of Murry, who was an aspiring songwriter, and Audree Wilson, a talented pianist. Brian’s life was always full of music. Brian Wilson said in his biography Wouldn’t It Be Nice, “As far as I can remember, I have always heard music, faint strains of melody floating in my head...I was able to tune into a mysterious, god-given music. It was my gift.”\n\nHowever, Brian did not have a happy childhood. His father both physically and emotionally abused Brian, Brian’s mother, and later, Brian’s two younger brothers, Dennis and Carl. His mother turned to alcoholism to escape from the abuse. Also, because she was afraid of Murry, Audree rarely showed her boys physical affection."
