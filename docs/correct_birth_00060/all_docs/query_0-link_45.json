        "text": "Brian Wilson net worth-American musician and co-founder of the Beach Boys, Brian Douglas Wilson was born on June 20, 1942, in Inglewood, California in the United States of America.\n\nHow much is Brian Wilson worth?\n\nBrian Wilson has a net worth estimated to be about $100 million as of 2024. He is believed to have amassed his impressive net worth from his career as a singer, songwriter, record producer, and also the co-founder of the Beach Boys.\n\nBrian Wilsonâs salary\n\nBrian Wilson has garnered great fortune and fame for himself through his music career. His skillful works gave wealth and registered his name in the hearts of music lovers. However, we have no details about his salary at the moment.\n\nBrian Wilsonâs assets\n\nBrian Wilson spent $3.5 million for a Beverly Hills property in July 1999. He put the mansion up for sale in 2007 for just under $9 million, but it never sold. He and his spouse invested $2.1 million in a Lake Arrowhead home in 2012. In 2016, they put the house up for sale, asking $3.3 million. They sold this house for $2.85 million in November 2019.\n\nBrian Wilson career\n\nMany have referred to Wilson as a genius for his unique approaches to pop composition, outstanding musical ability, and mastery of recording techniques. He is regarded as one of the 20th centuryâs most influential and inventive songwriters.\n\nHis most well-known compositions stand out for their excellent production quality, intricate orchestrations and harmonies, layered vocals, and clever or reflective themes. In addition, Wilson is well-known for his lifetime battles with mental illness and for his once-high-pitched singing.\n\nPhil Spector, Burt Bacharach, the Four Freshmen, and George Gershwin were among Wilsonâs early influences. He joined the Beach Boys in 1961 to start his professional career. He was the groupâs songwriter, producer, co-lead vocalist, bassist, pianist, and de facto leader.\n\nHe became the first pop musician to be given credit for creating, producing, arranging, and singing his own music in 1962 after joining Capitol Records.\n\nIn addition, he produced other artists, including American Spring and the Honeys. More than two dozen U.S. Top 40 successes, including the number-one smashes âSurf Cityâ (1963), âI Get Aroundâ (1964), âHelp Me, Rhondaâ (1965), and âGood Vibrationsâ (1966), had been written or co-written by him by the mid-1960s.\n\nHe is credited as being one of the first rock producers and music producer auteurs to use the studio as an instrument.\n\nAfter experiencing a nervous breakdown in 1964, Wilson decided to concentrate on songwriting and production, which resulted in the unfinished album Smile as well as the Beach Boysâ Pet Sounds and his first acknowledged solo release, âCaroline, Noâ (both 1966).\n\nLegends around his drug-abusing, overindulgent, and reclusive lifestyle emerged as his contributions to the band decreased and his career and mental health plummeted in the late 1960s.\n\nHis controversial first comeback resulted in the planned solo album The Beach Boys Love You (1977). With the controversial album Brian Wilson (1988), he resumed his solo career after forming a creative and business relationship with his psychotherapist Eugene Landy in the 1980s.\n\nAfter splitting from Landy in 1991, Wilson embarked on a string of solo tours from 1999 until 2022. Wilsonâs achievements as a producer heralded the acceptance of popular music as an art form and ushered in a period of unparalleled creative freedom for bands signed to record labels.\n\nHis early songs are frequently linked to the youth culture of the 1960s, and he is considered a key player in a wide range of musical movements and genres, such as sunshine pop, punk, art pop, psychedelic, chamber pop, punk, outsider, and the California sound.\n\nHis influence has spread to post-punk, indie rock, emo, dream pop, Shibuya-kei, and chillwave since the 1980s. Several industry honors, inductions into several music halls of fame, and placements on various criticsâ âGreatest of All Timeâ lists are just a few of Wilsonâs many achievements. Love & Mercy, a 2014 film, portrayed his life.\n\nSource: www.Ghgossip.com\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpupopmeYsSquNKopWamlal6uLvRrZ9o"
