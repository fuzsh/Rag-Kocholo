        "text": "Brian Wilson's daughters Wendy and Carnie Wilson have good news to share about their dad's health amid his battle with an undefined neurocognitive disorder.\n\nThe pair opened up about the 81-year-old Beach Boys legend's wellbeing to Entertainment Tonight on the red carpet for the new Disney+ documentary \"The Beach Boys\" on Tuesday.\n\n\"He is doing great! He is doing great. Every day he is in physical therapy. I'm cooking for him, he's spending a lot of time with his children now, his family,\" Carnie Wilson told ET. \"I'm so happy he's here tonight.\"\n\nThe insight into Wilson's life comes after a Los Angeles County Superior Court placed him under a conservatorship earlier this month.\n\n\"I think he's doing really good under the circumstances that he's going through right now,\" Wendy Wilson said.\n\n\"But, you know, he's a survivor. That's my dad. He's very tough, a very strong person,\" she continued. \"So yeah, I'm glad that he's coming tonight and I think that he'll really enjoy it, actually.\"\n\nThe premiere saw Wilson reunite with former bandmates Mike Love, Al Jardine, David Marks and Bruce Johnston as their new movie got the full Hollywood treatment at the TCL Chinese Theater.\n\n\"The Beach Boys,\" which started streaming on Friday, \"is a celebration of the legendary band that revolutionized pop music, and the iconic, harmonious sound they created that personified the California dream, captivating fans for generations and generations to come,\" according to Disney+.\n\nBeach Boys' Brian Wilson to be placed in conservatorship, judge rules\n\nBrian Wilson 'is unable to properly provide for his own personal needs', conservators claim\n\nEarlier this month, Judge Gus T. May approved the guardianship during a hearing, according to the Los Angeles County Superior Court website.\n\n\"The court finds from clear and convincing evidence that a conservatorship of the person is necessary and appropriate in that (Wilson) is unable to care for (his) person,\" a minute order from the hearing reads. \"The conservatorship is the least restrictive alternative needed for the protection of conservatee.\"\n\nMike Love talks Beach Boys doc: Reunion with Brian Wilson was 'sweet' and 'special'\n\nWilson did not object to the conservatorship, according to court documents obtained by USA TODAY. His longtime manager LeeAnn Hard and publicist Jean Sievers, who filed the conservatorship, were named his conservators.\n\nRegarding Wilson’s medical care, Hard and Sievers have been granted the authority to \"authorize the administration of medications appropriate for the care and treatment\" of the musician's neurocognitive disorder, per the minute order.\n\nThe representatives must consult with Wilson's children on \"all material related healthcare decisions\" for their father.\n\nThe ruling came nearly three months after Hard and Sievers filed paperwork to become Wilson's co-conservators.\n\nWilson was taking medication for dementia, according to a doctor’s declaration filed with the petition, and \"is unable to properly provide for his own personal needs for physical health, food, clothing, or shelter,\" the petition claimed.\n\nHis wife Melinda Ledbetter — who he credited with stabilizing his famously troubled life — had managed his daily needs before her death on Jan. 30, the petition said.\n\nContributing: Edward Segarra and KiMi Robinson"
