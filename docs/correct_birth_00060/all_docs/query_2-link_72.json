        "text": "Brian Douglas Wilson (born June 20, 1942) is an American pop musician, best known as a founding member of and the main producer, composer, and arranger for The Beach Boys.\n\nSourced quotes\n\n\"I think because I felt so sad I had to bring out my feelings, and try to create music that would make me and all my friends feel better.\"[1]\n\nSimple: I think that, because I was so upset, I had to show my feelings, and try to make music that would make me and all my friends feel better.\n\n\"We wanted to bring some love to the world. I thought we were good at doing that. Bringin' love to the world.\"[2]\n\nSimple: We wanted to bring some love to the world. I thought we were good at doing that. Bringing love to the world.\n\n\"I'm not a genius. I'm just a hard-working guy.\"[3]\n\nSimple: I am not a very smart person. I just work very hard.\n\n\"Beware the lollipop of mediocrity; lick it once and you'll suck forever.\"[4]\n\nWhat it means: Be careful of being encouraged to do something ordinary. If you do ordinary things once, you will no longer ever be interestered in doing something special.\n\nQuotes about Wilson\n\n\"Jesus, that ear. He should donate it to The Smithsonian.\"[5] – Bob Dylan\n\nSimple: Wow, look at that ear. He should give it to The Smithsonian.\n\n\"It was Pet Sounds that blew me out of the water. I love the album so much. ... I figure no one is educated musically 'til they've heard that album ... I love the orchestra, the arrangements ... it may be going overboard to say it's the classic of the century ... but to me, it certainly is a total, classic record that is unbeatable in many ways ... I've often played Pet Sounds and cried. ... 'God Only Knows' is a big favorite of mine ... very emotional, always a bit of a choker for me, that one. On 'You Still Believe In Me', I love that melody — that kills me ... that's my favorite, I think ... it's so beautiful right at the end ... comes surging back in these multi-colored harmonies ... sends shivers up my spine.\"[6] – Paul McCartney\n\nSimple: It was Pet Sounds that amazed me. I love the album very much...I am sure that nobody is taught musically until they have heard that album ... I love the orchestra and the arrangements...I may be making too much of it to say it is the classic of the century...but to me, it is a total, classic recording that cannot be beaten in many ways ... I have often played Pet Sounds and cried ... God Only Knows is one I prefer...very moving. On You Still Believe In Me, I love the melody — that I like very much...that is my favourite, I think...it is so lovely at the end...comes rushing back in the harmonies...sends shivers up my spine.\n\n\"If there is one person that I have to select as a living genius of pop music, I would choose Brian Wilson. Without Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper wouldn't have happened... Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds.\"[6] – George Martin\n\nSimple: If there is one person that I would select as a living legend of pop music, I would choose Brian Wilson. Without Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper would not have happened... Pepper tries to equal Pet Sounds.\n\n\"I think I would put him up there with any composer — especially Pet Sounds. I don't think there is anything better that that, necessarily. I don't think you'd be out of line comparing him to Beethovan — to any composer. The word genius is used a lot with Brian. I don't know if he's a genius or not, but I know that music is probably as good as any music you can make.\"[6] – Tom Petty\n\nSimple: I think I would put him on the same level as any composer — especially Pet Sounds. I do not think there is anything better than that. I think it would be fine to compare him to Beethoven — to any composer. The word \"genius\" is used a lot with Brian. I do not know if he is a genius or not, but I know that his music is as good as any.\n\nReferences\n\n↑ Caroline Now! interview (20 April 2000)\n\n↑ \"A Pop Genius Speaks of Love, Mercy, and Melody \" (November 6, 2001)\n\n↑ Boston Beats - Articles: When Brian Wilson Smiles\n\n↑ The Metropolitan Room\n\n↑ Abbott, Jim (October 15, 2000). \"Quotes from the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson\".
