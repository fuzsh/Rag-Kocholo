During an interview with Chet Cooper and Gillian Friedman of ABILITY Magazine, he was asked when the condition started. He answered:

Well, for the past 40 years, I've had auditory hallucinations in my head, all day, every day, and I can't get them out. Every few minutes, the voices say something derogatory to me, which discourages me a little bit, but I have to be strong enough to say to them, Hey, would you quit stalking me?

In 1976, his family sought help from controversial psychiatrist Eugene Landy. Eugene controlled the singer's life, monitoring him for 24 hours. The biopic Love & Mercy reveals what Brian went through at the hands of Landy.

Landy subjected him to overmedication, psychological abuse, financial control and virtual imprisonment. He controlled his business affairs, relationships and contact with the outside world.

Landy was fired in 1976 but rehired in 1982 after Brian's health deteriorated again. The psychiatrist allegedly continued mistreating the singer, and it was not until Brian's second wife, Melinda, came to his rescue. Wilson's family filed charges against Landy, and he was banned from contacting Wilson in 1992.
