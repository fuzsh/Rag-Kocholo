        "text": "Roy Webb, who helped found the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and wrote several musical scores for movies, died of a heart attack at St. John's Hospital Dec. 10, his family said Sunday. He was 94.\n\nAs a student at Columbia University, Webb composed music for variety shows and wrote the university's fight song, ''Roar, Lion, Roar.'' He left New York and a songwriting career shortly after the advent of sound motion pictures and received his first screen credit for ''Alice Adams'' in 1935.\n\nHe composed or designed the musical sequences for more than 100 films, including such pictures as ''Citizen Kane,'' ''Gunga Din,'' ''Marty,'' Notorious,'' ''Kitty Foyle,'' ''I Remember Mama'' and ''Sinbad the Sailor.''\n\nHe was survived by his wife, Jean."
