        "text": "This photo is the only one I have ever seen of my Grandad - I believe his cap badge is ASC can anyone give me anymore information (I realise it isnt much to go on)\n\nI do not know who is sitting beside him but his cap badge seems to look very much like a heavy horse can anyone identify it from the outline at all.\n\nIm trying desperately to identify more info about my grandad as Im really interested in where he served etc\n\nThanks for any help\n\nHi there, and welcome aboard. can't say about grandad, but if you post his details (or as much as you have), there will be people to help. is that an MM ribbon - difficult to say, as it's not a good picture.\n\nThe other chap, I suspect, is Queen's regiment. It's difficult to say, but it looks to me like the lamb with a scroll below, and a flag over its shoulder (they were nicknamed, i think, \"The Mutton Lancers\").\n\nGood luck with the researches.\n\nThank you Steve and Stebie9173 - my grandad was JOHN WEBB [/b] from Southwark area -\n\n(1245pm have just checked the London Gazette and there are 2 John Webbs one with MM after his name and the other states t/Lt John webb RE - what is MM ribbon? and the band around his left arm please - hubby thinks its to do with being in a regiment!!!!)\n\nit states ' ex Driver ASC' on my dads birth certificate (1919)- I have been researching my family history and grandad Webb is the real mystery as I cannot find any registration of his birth so therefore have had no joy finding him in any Army records - As this is the only photo I have of him its very little to go on I know but I really want to know more about him and where he served and who the other soldier is .............\n\nIs there anyway that you know to find his army number at all? Do local councils hold records of people who served in the war...............sorry Im really new to this - but I look at Grandads photo all the time wondering what he went through and where he was based -\n\nI consider myself really lucky and extremly humbled that both my grandads survived both wars - and thats why I want to know as much as I can about Grandad Webb - Im so proud of him ..............\n\n[Looks a bit too round for ASC. Could be Royal Engineers.\n\nCould we have a full name to work on, please? That does look like a MM ribbon, and possibly a 1914 or 1914-15 Star ribbon. Would probably date the picture to towards the end of the War.\n\nSteve.\n\nThanks have tried to find Grandads medal card but too many John Webbs - any idea how I might find his service number please - I have checked the London Gazette for info on MMs awarded but they do not give much info to work on - thanks for any assistance............am finding the site and forums really interesting and it has stirred a real interest in WW1 - watched the programmes 'searching for the fallen' yesterday its great that there are people still trying to identify our lost soldiers and has certainly opened my eyes ........\n\nHi\n\nSorry, I can’t help on the military side of things but hopefully I can give a few useful tips on finding your g/fathers DOB.\n\nWith John Webb being quite a common name in the London area I can see how hard it would be to pinpoint him. Going on the assumption that you don’t know John Webb’s parents names, then hunting down his marriage cert would, in my opinion, be your next best bet. Hopefully your g/mother will have a less common maiden name so searching for her marriage would possibly narrow down the search critea.\n\nFailing that, concentrate on the eldest child. From their date of birth search back say 3 years for a possible marriage. I’ve found in my tree that the first child is usually born within a year or two of the marriage. Where the eldest child is born sometimes (but not always) points to where the marriage may have taken place so concentrate on that area first.\n\nUnfortunately it may mean you will have to order several certificates before you get the right John Webb but don’t discard them until you are certain they are not in your tree. Names like John can appear several times within a tree so although it may not be your g/father it could be say a cousin etc.\n\nI hope I have been of some help. Good luck with your search.\n\nRegards\n\nLorac\n\nAny chance to repost the pic with a different scan resolution? This looks as if it was set to 'black and white'. (unless it is a photocopy perhaps...)If you have the option, try 'greyscale' as it often gives a smoother result, which may prove better for our resident 'experts' to check his cap badge.\n\nIan\n\nYes, I'd agree with this, Greyscale give a much better result, the photo does look as if it has been scanned using the \"Black and White\" setting. Also, if you have an editing programme your picture may benefit from sharpening up a bit. Best of luck with your search\n\nIan Robertson\n\nThank you all so much for your help I will try to rescan the picture - having taken a closer look I believe it is a photocopy - I also contacted the Queens Royal Surrey regiments museum about the gentleman sitting down (Mutton Lancers) they confirmed that it is indeed their badge (West Surrey) but have no way of identifying him but suggested I visit their museum in Woking which I hope to do next year - they advised they have many mnay pictures similar to mine -\n\nOf grandad he said 'The man on the left does seem to be wearing a medal ribbon which is quite unusual as most medals were awarded after the war except for gallantry and for service prior to the war so was your grandad in before the war and was awarded the bravery medal?' more food for thought - I can really understand how this type of research and interest becomes addictive Im driving hubby mad!!!!!!!!:-)\n\nAnother note thats slightly off the WW1 forum but I moved to a tiny village in Somerset 2 and a half years ago pop. approx 50!!! and in our tiny cemetary there is the grave of one of the survivors of Rourkes Drift - hubby has always had a real interest in this period of history and couldnt believe the coincidence.\n\nThanks again Ill let you all know what I find out..............\n\nOur man on the left is almost certainly wearing a Military Medal and a Star Medal in that order from left to right as we look.\n\n1914 Stars were given out from 1917.\n\n1914-15 Stars were given from 1918.\n\nM.M. ribbons (not necessarily the medals as these were often presented by dignitaries later on) were awarded within a week or two of being won. The M.M. was created in March 1916, with the first two medals being awarded in April 1916, and then awarded in earnest from June 1916.\n\nSteve."
