        "text": "As I type this, I’m expecting the official announcement of Josh Cobb as Gold City’s new tenor to be made at any moment. In addition, Roy Webb has joined the group as pianist and Tim Riley is officially the “new” bass.\n\nYou can read the full press release here on the Singing News site.\n\nJosh, 18 years old at the time, was the original tenor for Legacy Five. His most notable song was “I Stand Redeemed” on the group’s debut label recording, which, if memory serves, was the group’s initial radio release. Josh won the Horizon Individual award at the Singing News at the 2000 National Quartet Convention. At the end of that year’s convention, Josh suddenly left the group (to be replaced by Tony Jarman). (Side note: Some comments that appeared on Josh Cobb’s myspace page several years ago received a lot of attention in the past. I’ve been told that some of those comments were the result of a friend’s hacking Josh’s account and attempting to be funny. In any case, a young man can grow a lot in maturity and in the Lord over an almost ten year period.)\n\nRoy Webb is maintaining his solo status but will be behind the piano for Gold City when his solo bookings do not conflict with Gold City’s schedule.\n\nThe least surprising bit of news is that Tim Riley “has committed to a return to the full-time world of Southern Gospel music”.\n\nBest wishes to Josh, Roy, and Gold City for a long, successful ministry together.\n\nHere is a video of Josh singing a duet for an Easter service this year."
