His attempt to disguise his leftist agenda by feigning shock over Francom's editorial cartoon is pathetic. Where was Webb while the president of the United States was repeatedly called a liar, in spite of weapons of mass destruction having been found in Iraq? George Bush currently serves his country and deserves respect.",
