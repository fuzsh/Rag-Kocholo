        "text": "Football 8/2/2024 11:00:00 AM Daniel Hooker, Associate Athletics Director for Media Relations\n\nCole Gonzales Named to Phil Steele All-America Team\n\nGonzales also headlined 14 Catamounts named preseason All-SoCon\n\nCullowhee, N.C. – Western Carolina junior quarterback Cole Gonzales collected his third preseason All-America honor on Friday as he was selected to the third-team offense on the Phil Steele FCS 2024 Preseason All-America team released by the publication.\n\nThe Ocala, Fla., product was first recognized by FCS Football Central with second-team honors before being placed on the third-team in the Stats Perform FCS Preseason All-America squad. Earlier this week, Gonzales appeared on the initial watch list for the Walter Payton Award given to the nation's top offensive player. Last year's Roy M. \"Legs\" Hawley Offensive Player of the Year from the voting media in the SoCon, Gonzales was a first-team all-conference honoree at the end of the record-setting 2024 season that saw him toss a school-record 28 touchdown passes in guiding the nation's top yardage producing offense.\n\nGonzales was one of seven players from the Southern Conference to grace the Phil Steele preseason All-America team. Taylor and Samford LB Noah Morris landed on the first team. UTC wide receiver Javin Whatley and offensive lineman Reid Williams were named to the second-team offense. Gonzales was third-team offense with Mercer linebacker Ken Standley on the third-team defense with his linebacker teammate Isaac Dowling landing on the fourth team.\n\nAdditionally, 14 different Catamounts combined for 17 preseason All-Southern Conference honors by the same group as it released its all-conference teams for the 13 NCAA Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) leagues. The SoCon's preseason offensive and defensive players of the year mirrored the conference's coaches' vote with Gonzales collecting it on offense and Chattanooga DL Marlon Taylor receiving defensive top honors while both landed on their respective first teams.\n\nIn addition to its quarterback, the Catamount offense saw senior OL Blake Whitmore and junior WR AJ Colombo receive first-team plaudits. Running back Branson Adams, WR Calvin Jones, and OL Derek Simmons were dubbed second-team offense while returning senior OL Xavier Graham landed on the third-team offense.\n\nDefensively, senior DB CJ Williams was a first-team selection, while DL Micah Nelson, who is returning after being sidelined last season with an injury, and DB Samaurie Dukes were both dubbed second-team. Up front, senior defensive linemen Chris Morgan and Curtis Fann Jr. were joined by safety Ed Jones IV on the preseason third team.\n\nColombo and Jones additionally collected special teams honors on the first and second teams, respectively. Colombo was first-team as a punt returner while Jones was a two-time special teams second-teamer at kickoff return and all-purpose back. Veteran long-snapper, senior Colby Cross, collected third-team preseason All-SoCon recognition.\n\nA total of 10 Catamounts were named preseason All-SoCon at the league's preseason Media Day at the Hotel Hartness back on July 23. Gonzales, Colombo, Cross, and Whitmore were first-team honorees, with Adams, Dukes, Fann Jr., Jones, Simmons, and Williams each earning a second-team nod.\n\nWestern Carolina continued its preseason practice on Friday morning with its second session in \"uppers,\" or helmets and shoulder pads. The squad is also utilizing Guardian Caps, or padded, soft-shell layers worn outside the helmet, during its practice sessions. Preseason continues with a third session in uppers on Saturday morning before the first off-day of camp on Sunday, Aug. 4. The squad will work out in full pads for the first time this preseason on Monday morning on the turf at E.J. Whitmire Stadium / Bob Waters Field.\n\nPhil Steele – 2024 Preseason All-SoCon Teams\n\nWestern Carolina Catamount selections\n\nFirst Team Offense:\n\nQB – Cole Gonzales, Junior\n\nWR – AJ Colombo, Junior\n\nOL – Blake Whitmore, Senior\n\nFirst Team Defense:\n\nDB – CJ Williams, Senior\n\nFirst Team Special Teams:\n\nPR – AJ Colombo, Junior\n\nSecond Team Offense:\n\nRB – Branson Adams, Junior\n\nWR – Calvin Jones, Junior\n\nOL – Derek Simmons, Senior\n\nSecond Team Defense:\n\nDL – Micah Nelson, Senior\n\nDB – Samaurie Dukes, Junior\n\nSecond Team Special Teams:\n\nKR / AP – Calvin Jones, Junior\n\nThird Team Offense:\n\nOL – Xavier Graham, Senior\n\nThird Team Defense:\n\nDL – Chris Morgan, Senior\n\nDL – Curtis Fann Jr., Senior\n\nDB – Ed Jones IV, Senior\n\nThird Team Special Teams:\n\nLS – Colby Cross, Senior\n\n2024 Catamount Football Preseason Practice Schedule:\n\nSat., Aug. 3 – Practice #5 – 8:30 am – 11:00 am (uppers)\n\nSun., Aug. 4 – No Practice (Off Day)\n\nMon., Aug. 5 – Practice #6 – 8:30 am – 11:00 am (full pads)\n\nTues., Aug. 6 – Practice #7 – 8:30 am – 11:00 am (uppers)\n\nWed., Aug. 7 – Practice #8 – 8:30 am – 11:00 am (full pads)\n\nThurs., Aug. 8 – No Practice (Off Day)\n\nThurs., Aug. 8 – Catamount Football \"Ladies Night\" – 5:30 pm\n\nFri., Aug. 9 – Practice #9 – 8:30 am – 11:00 am (uppers)\n\nSat., Aug. 10 – Scrimmage #1 (Practice #10) – 9:00 am – 11:15 am (full pads)\n\nSun., Aug. 11 – Team Photo Day, 2 pm; Practice #11 – 3:00 pm – 5:30 pm (helmets)\n\nMon., Aug. 12 – Practice #12 – 8:30 am – 11:00 am (full pads)\n\nTues., Aug. 13 – Practice #13 – 8:30 am – 11:00 am (uppers)\n\nWed., Aug. 14 – Practice #14 – 8:30 am – 11:00 am (full pads)\n\nThurs., Aug. 15 – No Practice (Off Day)\n\nFri., Aug. 16 – Practice #15 – 8:30 am – 11:00 am (helmets)\n\nSat., Aug. 17 – Scrimmage #2 (Practice #16) – 2:30 pm (full pads)\n\nSun., Aug. 18 – No Practice – Team Building\n\nMon., Aug. 19 – First Day of Fall Classes at WCU\n\nKeep track of everything related to Catamount football and WCU Athletics through its social media outlets on Facebook (FB.com/CatamountSports, FB.com/WesternCarolinaFootball), Twitter (@catamounts, @CatamountsFB), and Instagram (wcu_catamounts, catamountsfb).\n\nImportant Dates in Catamount Athletics & Catamount Football:\n\nThurs., Aug. 1 – Remaining single-game tickets and game day parking go on sale\n\nWed., Aug. 14 – Catamount Fall Sports Preview, Facebook LIVE from Catamount Jaxe – (6 pm)\n\nFri., Aug. 16 – WCU New Student Convocation (Ramsey Center, 5 pm)\n\nSun., Aug. 18 – Catamount Women's Soccer Home-Opener – vs. UNC Asheville (7 pm)\n\nMon., Aug. 19 – First day of classes for the fall semester – Cullowhee\n\nFri., Aug. 23 – Catamount Volleyball Exhibition – vs. Gardner-Webb (Ramsey, 6 pm)\n\nThurs., Aug. 29 – 2024 Catamount Football season-opener at NC State (Raleigh, 7 pm)\n\nFri., Sept. 6 – The Bob Waters Memorial – Sequoyah National Golf Club (Cherokee, N.C.)\n\nSat., Sept. 7 – 2024 Catamount Football home-opener, vs. Campbell (1 pm, updated)\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#22 Branson Adams\n\nRB\n\n5' 9\"\n\nSophomore\n\n#0 AJ Colombo\n\nWR\n\n5' 8\"\n\nSophomore\n\n#48 Colby Cross\n\nLS\n\n6' 0\"\n\nRedshirt Junior\n\n#3 Samaurie Dukes\n\nCB\n\n5' 10\"\n\nSophomore\n\n#9 Cole Gonzales\n\nQB\n\n6' 0\"\n\nSophomore\n\n#3 Calvin Jones\n\nWR\n\n5' 10\"\n\nRedshirt Sophomore\n\n#7 Ed Jones IV\n\nLB\n\n6' 1\"\n\nJunior\n\n#93 Chris Morgan\n\nDL\n\n6' 0\"\n\nJunior\n\n#9 Micah Nelson\n\nDE\n\n6' 3\"\n\nRedshirt Junior\n\n#66 Derek Simmons\n\nOL\n\n6' 6\"\n\nJunior\n\n#72 Blake Whitmore\n\nOL\n\n6' 2\"\n\nRedshirt Junior\n\n#4 CJ Williams\n\nCB\n\n5' 10\"\n\nRedshirt Junior"
