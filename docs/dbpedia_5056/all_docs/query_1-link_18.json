        "text": "In this age of Artificial Intelligence (AI) fabricating convincing information it is obvious the human record needs to be protected so that facts remain facts. But is it likely a percentage of our human facts were constructed and are not true? Potentially it is the errors in the record of truth that lead to erroneous facts from AI. Artificial Intelligence systems like pdf.ai when trained on a single document stick to the facts and don’t fabricate. It may be the contradictions of multiple sources lead to fabrication.\n\nFor example, people researching the 1948 Somerton Man story (aka Carl Webb) about the body on the beach, rely on the military record of his brother Roy Webb being the touchpoint of truth.\n\nHis brother private Roy Webb born 12/07/1904 was presumed dead during WW2 and buried in a war grave. The family could visit the grave knowing his body was buried there.\n\nBut is it true, is the body of Roy Webb buried in the Thanbyuzayat War Cemetery?\n\nPrivate Roy Webb | War Casualty Details 2091636 | CWGC\n\nand,\n\nThe human record is convincing. We have the NAA record and the ‘Thanby’ war grave record and newspaper records. Three human facts confirm Roy Webb died on 6/10/1943. It is a convincing human truth.\n\nThere is only one piece of contradictory human evidence in that his daughter Brenda was born after he died in 1943. She was born in 1946 making it biologically impossible Brenda was his child. Yet his name is ‘likely’ written on her birth certificate as her father. It may be one factor for her committing suicide years later, not knowing the truth about her father. It has also been said that the name of Ruby her mother was not on her birth certificate.\n\nBut what about technology?\n\nSearching with Pimeyes uncovered a face that matched Roy Webb. So potentially it means technology found a doppelganger to Roy Webb. They say we all have doppelgangers. But is that human view of doppelgangers true, do doppelgangers match with facial ID?\n\nInterestingly the source of the Roy Webb doppelganger has subsequently been removed from the Internet as Pimeyes no longer finds the original image that it found some months ago. You have to wonder why someone would suddenly remove a picture of a family member that may have been on the Internet for years.\n\nFacial ID software allows us to check whether these images match.\n\nand,\n\nAccording to facial ID technology, Roy matches his doppelganger.\n\nBut the question is do we believe the technology found and matched the real Roy Webb or his doppelganger and was the birth certificate of Brenda accurate in that Roy Webb really was her biological father?\n\nWas Roy Webb’s recorded death at ‘Thanby’ a lie or is technology wrong?\n\nHere are two women identified in news reports as doppelgangers. Yet facial ID says they do not match.\n\nand,\n\nSo is our human understanding of a doppelganger incorrect or is technology wrong in not seeing them as identical?\n\nHow can dead Roy Webb’s face match a man who was clearly alive years after his death in 1943?"
