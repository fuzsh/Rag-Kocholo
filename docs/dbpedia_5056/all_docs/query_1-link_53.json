        "text": "I used to love movies growing up but lately I've been disappointed with this medium.I keep seeing the same old recycled crap over and over again and honestly I don't understand how people keep watching them.The worst part is that it seems there's a stronger emphasis on visual effects and action scenes while the story and character development are neglected.Whenever I see the name Michael Bay next to a movie I'm rolling my eyes and already know it's gonna be a horrible movie.Instead of wasting that HUGE budget on visual effects why not hire a talented writer and make a movie that actually has something to say?\n\nEven the music seems to be taking the same path with recycling the same old epic hybrid tracks and rarely hearing something fresh and original.I suppose temp tracks are to take part of the blame for this.I know directors get overly attached to them and they act as an anchor that's holding back the composer.There's nothing wrong with that kind of music(I actually like it) but for the love of god,give it a break and try something different for a change.\n\nFinally,my conclusion is that TV series are the future.I couldn't help but notice how far they have come and how much better they are than movies now.They have much more potential for better story ,better character development and plot intricacy.Shows like Breaking Bad or Game Of Thrones(and many others) are honestly 10 times better than any movie I've seen in the last 5 years.\n\nMusic is also much better.Some of my favorite music is from Bear McCreary on Battlestar Galactica and Da Vinci's Demons.\n\nI don't think they're obsolete, but I do think that they struggle to fight for the attention of the general public. Because there is so much choice out there for entertainment, and because movies are such a massive undertaking in both manpower and money, less risks can be taken. The end result is more garbage. I'm not the most avid moviegoer, though I think I have a pretty good barometer for quality storytelling. There have been some great, smaller movies in recent years. Off the top of my head, movies like Winter's Bone, Mud, The Road, and Take Shelter have all struck a chord with me recently. They are all small scope stories of people, written, acted, and shot beautifully. They just get drowned out in the noise of the next big explosion-fest.\n\nAlso, and I am 100% biased because of how I pay my bills, but I think that games are another avenue for great storytelling. There is just as much crap as there is in any other medium, but there are more and more great stories being told, from small games to big ones. A series like Mass Effect takes the tropes of big sci-fi epics and puts you in control of the entire thing. It has the small moments as well as the big, and you are able to affect the story as you want it across three titles. It's an incredible achievement. On the other end of things, there are titles like Dear Esther, Gone Home, or Kentucky Route Zero that are \"games\" only in the sense that they use the same technology that other games do, but the focus is squarely on telling a story and not killing enemies or scoring points. In the middle ground, there are titles like The Banner Saga, which has strategic gameplay akin to chess, yet it is wrapped up in jaw-dropping art and a story revolving around viking mythology which, like Mass Effect, you play a role in shaping based on your choices (all with beautiful music to boot).\n\nTo touch on what you said about TV shows (and what many people have been saying for years), I do think they are becoming better at telling some of the same types of stories that movies used to. I noticed this when watching the latest Superman movie. Even though the movie is quite long (not something I had an issue with), the pace of the storytelling felt breakneck to me compared to something like Game Of Thrones. Having 12 hour long episodes to let a story and characters breath is a welcome change of pace from relentless action, as it allows you to build up and cool down from major moments.\n\nYou know, if all people eat is shit all day, they start to discriminate between the \"good\" shit and the \"bad\" shit, utterly losing perspective on the fact that they're eating shit either way. It's a curious byproduct of the nearly limitless adaptability of humans, who can learn to hang by their thumbs.\n\n_Mike\n\nNah, I don't buy it.\n\nNo quibble about 12 Angry Men - it's outstanding and still highly relevant (and, I notice, in the IMDB public top 10). But you overstate the case. There are outstanding contemporary movies being made every year - it's not all good shit and bad shit (and I suspect you know it). You could pick a dozen movies from this century that are worthy of being called - at least - very good (and of course there are hundreds from the 50's that haven't remotely stood the test of time - 12 Angry Men is, after all, a cherry pick).\n\nHere's a little cherry picking of my own, based solely on the Best Picture noms of the past four years:\n\n12 Years A Slave\n\nCaptain Philips\n\nDallas Buyers Club\n\nPhilomena\n\nSilver Linings Playbook\n\nZero Dark Thirty\n\nLincoln\n\nArmour\n\nArgo\n\nMoneyball\n\nThe King's Speech\n\nInception\n\nThe Social Network\n\nToy Story 3\n\nNo doubt all of us would find fault with a number here (heading off \"I don't like X so will conflate that to invalidate the whole argument\"), but you can't casually dismiss the whole lot as merely relatively good, but still ultimately shit.\n\nWilliam Goldman (all praise be) was fond of pointing out every year that the Oscar nominations of whatever year it was he was writing couldn't hold a candle to those that didn't get nominated in, say, 1941. I suspect that, overall, he's right and the quality level has dropped, and blockbusters in particular have suffered an atrocious 10-15 years. But its imo lazy cynicism to denigrate everything.\n\nNah, I don't buy it.\n\nWell, you can disagree with how it applies to this argument, but it's a psychological fact. It's why life-in-prison inmates don't all go insane. In time, they scale their \"joy\" to little, relative things. Like Taco Tuesday or whatever. I used to wonder about the truth of this, but 14 years of working with prisoners later, I've learned it is an immutable truth.\n\nSo the question is, if relative judgment is a fact, why would you think that opinions on movies are an exception? It's not an exception in fashion, food quality, or anywhere else I can think of. The shoes they felt \"comfortable\" in in 1800 were not, by today's standards. Have you eaten a chicken, raised on an actual farm, eating actual grass and walking around all its life, killed an hour before you ate it? It tastes like something completely different than what we eat usually. I was stunned the first time I did. I had no idea; prior to that moment I had my own, relative scale, of good chicken and bad chicken. It was all bad chicken.\n\n_Mike\n\nCan't believe I forgot about games but yeah,I agree.On paper,there wasn't anything remarkable about Mass Effect.It wasn't a bad plot either.But playing it and being able to interact with the story and shape it was truly something special.Gone Home is another example of an amazing story that couldn't be as effective if told through any other medium.It's a shame really that so many people dismiss games and fail to realize that they can be so much more than killing zombies with an ak47.Of course there's just as much crap in games as there is in movies.\n\nMovies were always about making money.There's no doubt about that.But there was a time when the people involved in making them were passionate about what they were making.Now a movie (Excuse me for generalizing.I know there are exceptions) is just another product and the people who are calling the shots have no artistic sense whatsoever.They are seeing everything through just a business perspective.\n\nBut I agree with what Mike V. is saying.There's no way you can be disappointed if your expectations are low enough and the bar hasn't been set any higher.I think we are all guilty of that in some form or another.\n\nNah, I don't buy it.\n\nWell, you can disagree with how it applies to this argument, but it's a psychological fact. It's why life-in-prison inmates don't all go insane. In time, they scale their \"joy\" to little, relative things. Like Taco Tuesday or whatever. I used to wonder about the truth of this, but 14 years of working with prisoners later, I've learned it is an immutable truth.\n\nHa - go see The Lego Movie and re-read this post, those writers are way ahead of you\n\nDown this road of course, all is relative and debate becomes meaningless. Personally, I find the notion that absolutely no decent movies are made nowadays of any kind anywhere in the world relative to the 1950s to be, shall we say, not compelling. But nevertheless I'm delighted that someone presumably raised on a diet of Michael Bay has finally seen a decent movie, regardless of when it was made.\n\nPainting: an obsolete art-form.\n\nIf that Monet paints another water lily I'll scream! Or those Degas ballerinas. Talk about repeating yourself. And why not just use a camera? Much more modern. Actually, I meant \"smart-phone\", of course.\n\nYes, Tv is having a golden age. Especially Scandinavian. \"The Killing\", \"The Bridge\" are really great in their original form. Well, it can't be compared to movie-making. Dogs and Deer. A movie is a novella or short-story at best, a Tv series can be a Russian novel. Lots of time for character development.\n\nI blame Spielberg and Lucas. Making movies that they wanted to make that brought us 'High Concept' and where so successful with that \"Starwars\" thing or that \"Jaws\" thing that it created the business model for the block-buster.\n\nMichael Bay has fun making movies he likes. And he gets paid for them. What's wrong with that?\n\nYes, we'd all like Shakespeare and Goethe to write our scripts, or Ben Hecht or Peter Morgan. (oh, Peter Morgan is writing my scripts, but then know one went to see \"Rush\"...)\n\nThere are more movies being done all over the world than ever before. If you are a Spanish composer, you are laughing, because suddenly you are doing big Hollywood movies because you have the right passport. And good for them! That should bring some variety and new voices into the mix.\n\nThere have never been as many opportunities to create art and be paid for it as now. Come on, Video games didn't exist a few years ago. There have never been as many opportunities to take advantage of artists, to rip them off, to have artists cut each other's throat by undercutting each other as now.\n\nIt is the best of times, it is the worst of times. If you don't like it, change it. Write something so undeniably compelling that it can't be ignored. That's all it takes. Not who you know, where you live and all the other excuses why it's all bland and mediocre out there.\n\nAnd stop stating the obvious. (That goes for me, too)\n\n-H-\n\nDear Mike,\n\nas usual, I was garbling my metaphors and mixed messages... so, in best Zimmer stream-of-something: I think that no one sets out to make a bad movie deliberately Not a director, or a studio, or a writer or \"The System\". I think people are forever complaining without realizing that every year is a bad and great year for movies. Other than - as William Goldman keeps reminding us - 1939. But that was a bad year in all other aspects, except for movies and Mel Brooks. I think the paradigm is - just like in the rest of society - shifting to the 1% super-expensive movies and, on the other hand, the technology affording us to make a movie like \"Rush\", which just wouldn't have been possible without go-pros and cheap non-linear editing systems, etc., etc.. Remember, I worked on \"Days of Thunder\", so I'm doing some comparison shopping here . I believe that there where always great stories badly told - which is the only reason in my mind for a remake - and surprisingly thin little stories elevated to something fantastic by talented film-makers. (What are the stories that move us in a Fellini film, for instance? They really work best as pure cinema, not as a novel)\n\nI believe - and I use myself, or - since I just worked with him, Steve McQueen - as an example, that it's not who you know in Hollywood, but what and how you do it that gets you noticed. The way to get your foot in the door is to do compelling work that happens to be in sync with the Zeitgeist. And yes, it's still about a fair amount of luck.\n\nThen we have the question that Tv and cable really are stepping up by being more daring and original than they'd been in a long time (excluding The Simpsons! - always great and cutting-edge for 25 years or so...)\n\nAnd now we have video games. I think it is undeniable that the written word is still a great thing, but the Kindle or the IPad have shifted not only the delivery form, but the contend, and if we only look outwards, not inwards all the time, given us a whole world of amazing content to discover. I think games have - most often not for the better - influenced movie making, while movies are very much influencing games I think for the better. (no, there will not be a \"12 Years A Slave\" game anytime soon).\n\nBut stop the whining. (I don't mean you, Mike).\n\nPut some effort in discovering the great stories being told by new masters. Don't come at new movies with a sense of pre-conceived expectation that is just a sentimental leftover from going to the movies in your teen-age years.\n\nThis is supposed to be a forum for creators. So create The Next Big Thing. Or join a forum of critics...\n\nI could go on, but I'm very bored with my patronizing drivel\n\nActually, only Mike will get this rant, since he knows me.\n\n-H-"
