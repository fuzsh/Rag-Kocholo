        "text": "Roy Webb's\n\nREDDITCH\n\nThen & Now\n\n- Conservation for Our Time -\n\nThis book is based on my late brothers, Roy Webbs, prose, poetry and letters to the press. Starting with his diverse subject matter and composing it into something coherent represented a significant challenge. I have added source material, photographs and research topics to complement, and sometimes supplement, Roys writing. The work of conservationists in Englands Redditch-Worcestershire area is included together with considerable detail about the work of the UKs Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB).\n\nRedditch originally was a small industrial town which grew into some prominence through the production of sewing needles, surgical needles and fishing hooks. The needle and hook industry was a strong employer and influence on the town of Redditch from the mid-18th to the mid-20th century. The town itself was just an ordinary town where everyone knew everyone, if not by name, certainly by face, or family. The countryside surrounding the town was idyllic. In 1964 Redditch became the focus of government sponsored New Town Planning which caused my brother Roy great consternation and distress as he saw his home town completely altered.\n\nAs I have written in this volume, \"New Town Planning\" could have happened anywhere at any time, and it certainly did in a number of UK towns and cities. My aim with this book is to try to give the reader a glimpse of a small towns past through to its present day state. My hope is that concern for, and husbandry of, the environment will lead Redditch's current citizens on a path to an ever improving community of the future.\n\nTina Emily Webb-Moore\n\nAVAILABLE FROM:\n\nTina Kidger\n\nor\n\nHistory Into Print\n\nPublished by: History Into Print 2014\n\n170 pages\n\nTable of Contents\n\nReviews and Testimonials"
