Lieut.-Colonel Walter Turner was in the Wellington College XI in 1897 and from there, like his older brother, he played intermittently as a batsman for Essex when his military duties allowed. A strong driver and cutter, his first-class career extended over 27 seasons, with large gaps while he was abroad with the army. He did not appear in England between 1906 - his best season when he scored 924 runs at 33.00 - and 1914, but did play for the Europeans while in India during that time. Back in England in 1919 - his only season in the surrounding decade - he scored 371 runs at 51.57, including a career-best 172 against Middlesex at Leyton.
