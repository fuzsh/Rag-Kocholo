Researcher Turner Wiley estimated that Robert Turner may have "appeared" in Bethania, at the intersection of the Great Wagon Road to Squire Boone's and the trail from the Shenandoah Valley, as early as 1756. This was during the more intense fighting of the French and Indian War in the area. It is unclear how he separated from his military unit, or whether he continued fighting. He then moved a little farther southeast to Brushy Fork, where he became an acquaintance of Mathias Sappenfield in Rowan (now Davidson) County. In January 1757, Walter Thornburg purchased 437 acres ten miles east on Richland Creek, Guilford County (now most of the south section of High Point). In August 1762, Walter was granted 660 acres on Abbotts Creek, about a mile east of the Sappenfield plantation in Rowan County. And Mary Thornburg, Walter's daughter, was expelled from the Quaker church 23 Feb 1765 for marrying Robert Turner "out of unity" with the church. Their son Walter was born in April, 1765.

Robert was loyalist in the Revolution, his land was judged confiscated in 1779 and granted to someone else. But Robert was off fighting against the Revolutionaries, and Mary could not be put off the land because Robert had not acquired proper title to it. This land was on Muddy Creek, just south of the Guilford-Randolph County line, and about one mile south of Walter Thornburg's plantation.

Revolutionary sentiment surprised this largely Loyalist community. When the Governor called for volunteers to fight the Rebels, Captains Robert Turner and Mathias Sappenfield assembled, with about 1600 others north of Wilmington, NC, on 23 Feb 1776. The Rebels were waiting for them 27 Feb at Widow Moore's Creek Bridge, 18 miles north of Wilmington. The battle didn't last long, and the Patriots pursued the Loyalists, capturing 850, including Robert and Mathias, the next morning. Most of the soldiers were released after signing a loyalty oath. But Robert and Mathias, being officers, were taken prisoner. They were first taken to the gaol at Halifax, NC, where they steadfastly refused to take the Loyalty Oath, and so remained prisoners. Mary Turner, and eight other wives of Guilford County, petitioned the Council of Safety at Halifax 12 Oct 1776, to release their husbands. But Robert had been transferred about April 28, probably to Sharpsburg, MD. And from there, in September, he had escaped into Pennsylvania, and eventually joined the Loyalists in New York. His final pay there was on 27 Oct 1778, for 995 days of service.

He apparently joined the British and Loyalist forces sent by Gen. Henry Clinton in December 1778, to capture Savannah, Georgia. They then fought fairly evenly until Clinton himself arrived in February, 1780. British Col. Patrick Ferguson now assumed command of the Loyalist forces in Savannah, and moved them to assist in the siege of Charleston. The city fell 12 May, 1780, and with it the Carolinas fell under British control. Ferguson marched to Fort 96 in June, leaving Robert Turner to assist the Royal Fusiliers in recovering at Congaree Store. In July, Turner rejoined Ferguson, who had orders from Cornwallis to march north, scouting, increasing his army, and occupying land. At Cedar Spring, 18 July 1780, the Loyalists suffered heavy losses, and Captain Robert Turner and his small contingency accompanied the wounded to Musgrove Mill.

While he was there, the Loyalists suffered another defeat, but Capt. Turner was so impressed with the performance of Col. David Fanning that he attached himself to Fanning's forces, a smaller party recruiting and gathering supplies for Ferguson. While they were thus occupied, they missed the Battle of Kings Mountain, 7 Oct 1780, where Ferguson and most of his men were killed. They then rode north and joined the civil war under way in North Carolina, mostly both sides burning their neighbors' plantations by night. One such encounter was only 6 miles from the Turner Plantation on Muddy Creek, where Mary and the children were living. This portion of the mayhem was called the Scourge of Randolph County, and persuaded many of the peaceful German and Quaker families in the area to migrate northwest into what later became Tennessee. Robert Turner was listed as a Captain from Randolph County NC in July, 1781, in the Narrative of Colonel David Fanning (page 20) and thought (by Fanning) to be living in North Carolina in 1790. Fanning signed a truce in May, 1782, and headed for Florida, then Nova Scotia. Robert probably returned to his family only to find them packed and ready to join the Mills migration west. He did not accompany his family to Tennessee. And no record of him has been found thereafter. (This narrative is from the final letter written by Turner N Wiley, 10 May 2008, now on file with the rest of his correspondence (34 two-inch 3-ring binders) on the Turner Family, 1967-2008, in the Special Collections Department at Rowan Public Library, Salisbury, North Carolina.)

It has been suggested that Robert Turner received his final pay 25 Aug 1784. But the document referenced is a pay voucher from the State of North Carolina, which did not pay Loyalist claims, and must have been paid to one of the several other Robert Turners, who served in the Revolutionary forces. And the Nov. 1797 settlement of the estate of a Robert Turner in Jefferson Co, TN, who died 13 May 1796, was administered by James Turner, and buyers at the sale included William Turner and Gemima Turner, none of whom were children of this Robert.

Mary Turner was certified from Springfield Monthly Meeting to Westfield MM, Surry Co NC, 1791, and to Lost Creek MM, New Market TN, 1797. She was among the representatives sent to New Garden MM to authorize New Hope MM in 1795. Shortly after 1800, Quaker sentiment against slavery increased, and another migration occurred, from North Carolina and Tennessee to Ohio and Indiana. On 28 Feb 1807 Mary Turner was certified to Miami MM in Ohio, but joined Center MM in Clinton County, 3 miles NE of Wilmington, on 6 June 1807. She is listed in the Census of 1820, next door to James Hickman, and with one male, age between 26 and 45, living with her.

According to yDNA evidence, this William Hand, alias Robert Turner, appears to be a "close" relative of the Hand Family of Long Island and Cape May, New Jersey, matching 62 out of 67 markers. The American family has been traced nicely since arriving about 1636. But William descends from the family left behind in England, which is untraced. Baptismal, marriage, and death dates below are from the Parish Registers of Sundridge and Tonbridge, Kent:

Steven Hand (buried 9 May 1622) married 24 Jun 1600 Ann Buckland, widow (buried 27 Nov 1625) [Ann might have been the widow of John Buckland (buried 27 May 1595, at Staplehurst, Kent) who married Ann Hills 11 Feb 1593 at Bletchingley, Surrey.]

1. Alice Hand (bapt.14 Dec 1600) married 23 Jun 1617 Nicholas Mills

11. Sarah Mills, born before Steven wrote his will in 1622.

2. Giles Hand (bapt.20 Mar 1602/3, buried 30 Sep 1639) married Anne (buried 1 Aug 1639)

[1638-9 southeast England seems to have had a high incidence of typhoid fever and small pox.]

21. Thomas Hand (bapt.25 Nov 1634)

22. Giles Hand (bapt.25 Nov 1634, buried 9 Dec 1636)

23. Leonard Hand (bapt.2 Mar 1636/7, buried 11 Dec 1639)

3. Jane Hand (bapt.5 Aug 1605) married 5 Jul 1636 Nicholas Swan

4. John Hand (bapt.4 Jun 1609, buried 24 Jan 1660) married 24 Apr 1634 Elizabeth (or Alice) Gransden (born 28 Nov 1613 in Tonbridge, daughter of Henry Gransden and Alice Harris). Moved between 1636 and 1640 to Lynn, Massachusetts, then to Southampton, Long Island, by 1644. John was buried in East Hampton, Long Island, his wife Alice remarried by 1663 Capt. Edward Codner, and died after 25 Jul 1687. This Hand Family is well-documented from John on down.

So we need to look for descendants of Thomas Hand (1634) or for brothers of Steven Hand (c1570)

There were at least 30 Thomas Hands (including variant spellings) married in England (none in Kent) between 1650 and 1680. Insufficient probability to investigate any of them, at this time.

There was a Thomas Hand, who had children baptized in Dartford, Kent.

1. Thomas Hand (bapt. 7 Mar 1563)

2. Martyn Hand (bapt. 11 Dec 1564; buried 31 Jan 1565)

3. Steven Hande (bapt. 22 Aug 1568) Since the Steven Hand of Sundridge married a widow in 1600, it would not have been unreasonable for him to have been 32 years old at the time. If he was previously married, apparently no children survived, since none were named in his will. [NOTE: This is pure speculation. I know of NO evidence (thus far) to connect this Steven Hande with the Steven Hand of Sundridge.]

NOTE: Sundridge is about 9 miles north of Tonbridge, and about 11 miles south of Dartford.

Robert Buckland buried 7 Jan 1600, at Newnham, Kent

Phillip Buckland buried 30 Mar 1595, at Smeeth, Kent

John Buckland buried 27 May 1595, at Staplehurst, Kent

John Bucklan married An Hils 11 Feb 1593 at Bletchingley, Surrey

There is an undocumented claim that in 1635, a vessel sailed for America with a passenger list that included John Hand, Mark Hand, Milford Hand, and Richard Hand. There was a John Hand, of unknown, if any, relation to Steven, who married Joan Simmons, and lived in Stanstead, Kent, in the same time period. Mark, Milford, and Richard were apparently his sons, along with a Stephen and daughters Mehitable and Mary Ann. Some researchers have merged the two families, creating considerable confusion. No record in Parish Registers has been found for the Stanstead family.

John Hand, of St Peter Parish, Sandwich, Kent (buried 20 Sep 1593)

1. Rychard Hand (buried 4 Jun 1592)

2. John Hand (bapt. 2 Jul 1593)

3. Jane Hand (buried 19 Oct 1593)
