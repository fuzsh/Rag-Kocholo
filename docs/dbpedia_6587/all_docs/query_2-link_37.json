        "text": "MADISON - Walter Douglas Turner, 88, died on April 2, 2014 at Agrace Hospice Care, surrounded by his family.\n\nWalt was born February 12, 1926 in Fort Wayne, Indiana to Walter William Turner and Ruth (Rogers) Turner. Raised in Fort Wayne, Walt graduated from Yale University and received his JD degree from the University of Indiana. In 1949, he married Phyllis (Dooley) Turner, beginning a life together filled with family, travel, and adventure. They moved to Chicago and, eventually, to Hinsdale, Illinois, where they raised their three children, Andy, Amy, and Matt.\n\nWalt was an extraordinary father, a devoted husband, and a respected lawyer. He worked for Swift & Co. (which later became Esmark, Inc.) for over 30 years, working his way up to chief counsel and commuting into the city daily, while still managing to be involved in all of his children's activities.\n\nWalt talked often of his summers spent on his Aunt Jesse's farm in Odebolt, Iowa, and upon retirement, he and Phyllis moved to Brodhead, Wisconsin, where they restored a small farm and raised sheep on it for more than twenty years. During this time, they also lived an urban life in Madison during the week, driving back and forth to spend long weekends tending to the farm in Brodhead. In 2005, the farm was sold and Walt spent the rest of his years in Madison. During these years, he volunteered at the Geography Department at UW Madison. He took on the clerical challenges there with the same serious effort he gave to all of his endeavors. When he could no longer drive, he happily learned to take the bus to \"work.\"\n\nWalt was above all gentle, unassuming, and loving. There was nothing he would not do for anyone he met. Even at his retirement home, he was known for clearing the dishes for other diners at his table. Just mention something you needed to have fixed in front of him and he would be off to his workshop, taking on the smallest project with the utmost seriousness.\n\nWalt had a natural and distinct taste in visual arts. He appreciated original art, loved his antique bank collection, and even became a gourd artist himself in retirement. As his gait became a bit stooped over, he found \"treasures\" on the ground, a small trinket or earring piece, and incorporated them into his gourd creations. Walt could always find the one positive aspect of a tough situation.\n\nWalt was loved by all who met him. Even when he faced losing his memory and becoming physically limited, he did so with grace and a smile. None of us remember him ever complaining, but all of us remember him smiling and blowing us kisses. We will cherish him forever.\n\nWalt was preceded in death by his parents and his older sister, Mary Elizabeth (Streeter) Turner. He is survived by his wife, Phyllis Turner, his children, Andy of Council Bluffs, Iowa, Amy (Larry Whitehouse), of Glenwood, Iowa, and Matt (Rebecca May) of Madison, Wisconsin, and his six grandchildren (Liam, Caleb, and Rachel Whitehouse and Eliza, Mariama, and Lucy Turner). Special thanks to the wonderful staff at Sebring Assisted Care and Agrace Hospice Care.\n\nA service to celebrate Walt's life will be held at 11 a.m. on Saturday, April 19, 2014 at Cress Funeral Home, 3610 Speedway Rd., Madison. Family will greet friends after 10 a.m. until the time of service.\n\nIf you wish to make a gift in his memory, please consider the UW Foundation Odebolt Fund #12417318 (a fund established by Walter to support graduate students in the Department of Geography), by sending it to UW Foundation, US Bank Lockbox 78809, Milwaukee, WI 53728-0807, or online at supportUW , inserting the fund name and number."
