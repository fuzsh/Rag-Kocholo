        "text": "With thanks to Dominic Sheridan of the Australian Great War Poetry Journal who has researched Turner and his work extensively for his commemorative project, for his guidance and inspiration\n\nI was surprised to discover that one of my all-time favourite poems - \"Romance\"* - was written by a WW1 soldier poet.\n\nWalter was born in South Melbourne, Australia on 13th October 1889. His parents were Walter James Turner (1857 – 1900), an organist at St Paul's Cathedral and a warehuseman, and his wife, Alice May Turner (née Watson), who was a musician. Walter was educated at Carlton State School, Scotch College and the Working Men's College.\n\nAfter the death of his father, Walter and his mother went to live in Britain. The 1911 Census shows Walter working as a merchant’s clerk and residing in Hugh Street, London, S.W. with his widowed Mother, who is listed as a musician and pianist. Among the literary personalities of the era, Walter met and became friends with Siegfried Sassoon, Virginia Woolf, Vita Sackville-West, and Lady Ottoline Morrell. Harold Monro, who founded the Poetry Bookshop and helped aspiring young poets to get their work published, included 13 of Walter’s poems in his Georgian Poetry anthologies.\n\nWalter spent ten months travelling and writing in Austria and Germany between 1913 and 1914 and served as a Lieutenant in the Royal Garrison Artillery Anti Aircraft Section from 1916 to 1918.\n\nOn 5th April 1918, in Chelsea, London, UK, Walter married Marguerite Delphine Dubuis (1891 - 1951). From the First World War until the mid-1930s, Walter was known primarily as a poet. His 1916 poem entitled “Romance” (\"Chimborazo, Cotopaxi....\") is arguable the most famous of his poems. Walter dedicated his collection entitled “The Dark Wind” (E.P. Dutton & Co. New York, 1920) to Siegfried Sassoon, with whom he and his wife shared a house on Tufton Street, Westminster, London, before Sassoon moved out in 1925.\n\nPhoto of Walter and Seigfried Sassoon by\n\nLady Ottoline Morrell c. 1925\n\nW. B. Yeats was \"…lost in admiration and astonishment\" about Walter’s poetry, including some of Walter’s work in his “Oxford Book of Modern Verse 1892–1935\", published in 1936 by Oxford University Press.\n\nWalter was the literary editor of the weekly “Spectator” magazine from 1941 to 1946, and general editor of the Britain in Pictures series. He died in Hammersmith on 18th November 1946.\n\n“Recollecting a Visit to W. B. Yeats” by Walter Turner\n\nIt is most pitiful to watch men go\n\nIn search of beauty with despairing eyes,\n\nAnd what it is they lack as this world lies\n\nOpen before their gaze they do not know.\n\nThese porcelain skies with billows of graven snow\n\nThey paint on cold, thin cups, and draw from strings\n\nVoices of mourning winds and sense of wings;\n\nFrom woods rob sad-faced flowers and bid them grow\n\nNearer their souls; ay, creep out in the night\n\nAnd steal the stars and the bright Moon from Heaven,\n\nAnd bring them home to decorate their dreams\n\nMy God it is a strange and pitiful sight\n\nTo see the treasury of a poet's room\n\nAnd him alone there shrouded in beauty's gloom!\n\nWalter’s WW1 poetry collections were: “The Hunter and other Poems”\n\n(Sidgwick & Jackson, London,1916)\n\n“The Dark Fire” (Sidgwick & Jackson, London, 1918)\n\nThe Dark Wind (E.P. Button & Co., New York,1920) - a compilation of poems from “The Hunter”, “The Dark Fire” and “In Time Like Glass”\n\nAnd his poems were included in eight WW1 poetry anthologies.\n\n“The Sky-Sent Death” by Walter Turner\n\n'A German aeroplane flew over Greek territory, dropping a bomb which\n\nkilled a shepherd.'\n\nSitting on a stone a Shepherd,\n\nStone and Shepherd sleeping,\n\nUnder the high blue Attic sky;\n\nAlong the green monotony\n\nGrey sheep creeping, creeping.\n\nDeep down on the hill and valley,\n\nAt the bottom of the sunshine,\n\nLike great Ships in clearest water,\n\nWater holding anchored Shadows,\n\nWater without wave or ripple,\n\nSunshine deep and clear and heavy,\n\nSunshine like a booming bell\n\nMade of purest golden metal,\n\nWhite Ships heavy in the sky\n\nSleep with anchored shadow.\n\nPipe a song in that still air,\n\nAnd the song would be of crystal\n\nSnapped in silence, or a bronze vase\n\nSmooth and graceful, curved and shining.\n\nTell an old tale or a history;\n\nIt would seem a slow Procession\n\nFull of gestures: limbs and torso\n\nWhite and rounded in the sunlight.\n\nSitting on a stone a Shepherd,\n\nStone and Shepherd sleeping,\n\nLike a fragment of old marble\n\nDug up from the hillside shadow.\n\nIn the sunshine deep and soundless\n\nCame a faint metallic humming;\n\nIn the sunshine clear and heavy\n\nCame a speck, a speck of shadow —\n\nShepherd, lift your head and listen,\n\nListen to that humming Shadow!\n\nSitting on a stone a Shepherd,\n\nStone and Shepherd sleeping,\n\nIn a sleep dreamless as water.\n\nWater in a white glass beaker,\n\nClear, pellucid, without shadow;\n\nUnderneath a sky-blue crystal\n\nSees his grey sheep creeping.\n\nIn the sunshine clear and heavy\n\nShadow-fled a dark hand downward ;\n\nIn the sunshine deep and soundless\n\nBurst a star-dropt thing of thunder —\n\nSmoked the burnt blue air's torn veiling\n\nDrooping softly round the hillside.\n\nBoomed the silence in returning\n\nTo the crater in the hillside,\n\nTo the red earth fresh and bleeding,\n\nTo the mangled heap remaining:\n\nFar away that humming Shadow\n\nVanished in the azure distance.\n\nSitting on a stone no Shepherd,\n\nStone and Shepherd sleeping,\n\nBut across the hill and valley\n\nGrey sheep creeping, creeping,\n\nStanding carven on the sky-line.\n\nScattering in the open distance.\n\nFree, in no man's keeping.\n\nFrom “The Dark Wind”\n\n* \"Romance\" by Walter James Redfern Turner\n\nCotopaxi and Chimborazo are the most popular climbs in the Andes Mountains of Ecuador,\n\nDominic Sheridan, writing in his Australian Great War Journal*, has this to say:\n\n\"Walter James Redfern Turner - Australia’s Georgian Poet\" served in the Royal Garrison Artillery from 1916 - 1918. He was born in South Melbourne, Australia. Writers such as Turner, Frederic Manning, Harley Matthews, Martin à Beckett Boyd and James Griffyth Fairfax, helped give Australia a literary voice in England. Walter wrote 13 poems for the Georgian School. Whether he had meant any of these poems to be chosen is difficult to say, but Harold Monro (poet and publisher) and Edward Marsh (editor), believed that these 13 poems by the expat Australian poet were worthy, not only of consideration, but also inclusion into two of the five anthological volumes of Georgian poetry”\n\nhttps://76f98171-044b-4541-aab1-f00e8ed6041e.filesusr.com/ugd/040634_0e974ab8b64840e980f35bec476eef4d.pdf\n\nStephen Cribari, a poet who teaches law in America, has this to say: “Georgian Poetry only saw maybe five volumes, many of its contributors did not survive The War, but it does seem to have brought the major figures from the end of the Victorian Era together with the poets who would have marked the fullness of the Georgian Era, some of whose writing changed with The War and then changed the arc of English poetry after the war.\n\nEdward Thomas, still in his prose mode, favorably reviewed the first volume. That was just before Frost turned Thomas toward becoming a poet. Thomas then submitted poems to Marsh for the second volume, but \"Edward Marsh . . . had decided against the inclusion of either Thomas or Frost in his second volume of Georgian Poetry, not caring for Thomas's verse and imposing a new rule to exclude overseas writers from consideration.\" Hollis, \"Now All Roads Lead to France,\" p. 248 (Faber & Faber, 2011). Thomas enlisted in The Artists' Rifles, which attracted as you know many artists and poets including Wilfred Owen. Though nothing seems to suggest Thomas knew Owen personally, \"(o)ther poet members would include two minor Georgians, W.J. Turner and Edward Shanks.\" J.M. Wilson, Edward Thomas from “Addlestrop to Arras”, p. 336 (Bloomsbury, 2015).\n\nSources: Find my Past, British National Archives, Free BMD,\n\nCatherine W.
