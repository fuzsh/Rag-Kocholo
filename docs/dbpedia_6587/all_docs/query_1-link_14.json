Mr. Turner was born July 24, 1928, in Kentucky and lived in West Virginia until moving to Eastlake over 50 years ago. He married the late Nancy (nee Walter Turner Walter Turner, 80, of Eastlake, passed away August 8, at home surrounded by his family. Mr. Turner was born July 24, 1928, in Kentucky and lived in West Virginia until moving to Eastlake over 50 years ago. He married the late Nancy (nee Waulk) Turner in 1955 and was married to her for 44 years, before her death in 1999. Mr. Turner worked as a machinist for more than 40 years before retiring from Metal Seals in Willoughby. He was a people person, as evidenced by his love of working for Eastlake Tops as a packer after he retired until the store closed in 2007. Mr. Turner was a US Army veteran, serving in Germany from 1951-1953. Mr. Turner was involved in the community also. He was active in the Eastlake Little League for 20 years, serving as a Coach and President of the League. He coordinated the Eastlake July 4th Parade for several years, served as Grand Marshall one year and designed the parade route for the Bicentennial Parade in 1976. He was a lifelong league bowler and an avid Cleveland Indians fan. He loved all things about baseball-attending Spring Training in Florida for many years, watching games on TV, going to Captains games and to Jacobs Field. He especially loved spending time with his children and grandchildren, rarely missing a band concert or sporting event that they were involved in. He was preceded in death by his father Charles Turner; mother Dorothy; brothers Charles and David, sister Lena Fransetta and his wife Nancy (nee Waulk). He is survived by his brother C. Eugene (Lee) of San Antonio, Texas and his three children, sons David (Jeannie) Turner of Parma and William (Susan) Turner of Mentor and daughter Kathy Blau (Michael) of Willowick; brother-in-law, Anthony Fransetta. He is also survived by seven grandchildren; one great-grandchild, and many nieces, nephews and great-nieces and nephews. Visitation will be Tuesday 2 to 4 and 6 to 8 p.m. at Monreal Funeral Home, 35400 Curtis Blvd, Eastlake. Funeral services will be at 8 p.m. following visitation. Family suggests contributions to The Hospice of the Western Reserve 300 East 185th Street, Cleveland. 44119."
