        "text": "Charles County Public Schools (CCPS) recently celebrated 60 students who completed the requirements for a Maryland high school diploma in summer school. The students, along with their friends, family and staff from their respective high schools, gathered Aug. 2 at St. Charles High School for a summer commencement ceremony.\n\n“Today is a celebration — we highlight a great accomplishment today,” Maria V. Navarro, Ed.D., superintendent of schools, said. “We are here to celebrate 60 kids.”\n\nNavarro spoke of perseverance and motivation, traits the graduates of the seven CCPS high schools possessed to earn their diplomas. “For each of you, today marks not just the culmination of your high school journey but is also the acknowledgement of the many challenges you faced and overcame to arrive at this moment,” Navarro said to members of the Class of 2024. “Your journey to this point has taken a bit longer than perhaps what you might have expected. Today, I honor your perseverance and determination to keep going and reach this important milestone.”\n\nWhile high school graduation is an occasion to be celebrated, Navarro urged the graduates to think beyond the ceremony, beyond the accomplishment. “Remember, success is not always measured by how quickly you get to your destination but by the strength and determination to finish no matter what,” Navarro said.\n\nThe following is a list of members of the Class of 2024 who earned their diplomas through summer school.\n\nLa Plata High School\n\nBrooke L.
