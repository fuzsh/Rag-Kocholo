        "text": "senior pastor\n\nBrent Horan\n\nBrent grew up in a small town in Texas where his family attended a Catholic church. A major part of his early years was tennis and he even ended up playing collegiate tennis at Texas A&M. It was at A&M that the Lord opened his eyes to the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ. After college, he spent nine years as a tennis professional at a club in Dallas, Texas. In 2006, he met his wife Katie, who is also a graduate of A&M. In 2010, they moved to Charlotte, NC for Brent to attended Reformed Theological Seminary, where he received his M.Div. After graduating in 2013, they returned to Dallas and Brent served as an assistant pastor at Providence PCA for three years. In July of 2016, Brent began his work as senior pastor at FRPC. Katie and Brent now have two boys, Stowe and Boston. If Brent isn’t working, you would probably find him on the golf course (or doing something athletic), reading a good book (hopefully, with ice cream nearby), or spending time with his family (probably playing some form of superheroes with the boys).\n\nAssociate Pastor\n\nJim Weidenaar\n\nJim was born and raised in Michigan. He earned degrees from both Calvin College and Calvin Theological Seminary, during which time he met and married his wife, Deb. After seminary Jim worked as a retail manager for four years. In 2002, they moved to Philadelphia to study at Westminster Theological Seminary, where he finished his PhD. From 2012-2022 Jim worked for Harvest USA, directing the Pittsburgh office and developing church equipping efforts. Jim joined the staff of First Reformed in September of 2022, though he and his family had been attending and involved since moving to Pittsburgh in 2012. When Jim is not at work, he enjoys doing home improvement projects, road trips, or taking walks with Deb, their daughter Abby, and their dog, Cocoa.\n\nMinister in Residence\n\nJim Spitzel\n\nJim Spitzel recently retired from full-time ministry and now serves as our Minister in Residence. In high school, Jim heard the gospel at a Young Life ranch and God’s redeeming grace created in him a new heart. He then began a journey to serve Jesus Christ, first as a Young Life leader, while he was attending Duquesne University as a music student. During this time Jim became a “regular” at the Ligonier Study Center learning the doctrines of grace from Dr. R.C. Sproul. His journey continued on to Gordon-Conwell Seminary where he was blessed to study under Dr. Roger Nicole. Since graduation, Jim has served Presbyterian churches in Flushing, NY, Roanoke, VA, and Pitcairn, PA. Jim serves FRPC in the areas of congregational care, music ministry, and outreach."
