        "text": "Lexy Brooks, executive producer of Jamaica Independence Foundation, Inc., a New York-based charity organization, says that Federal Reserve Bank Executive Vice President and General Auditor Clive Blackwood will be the keynote speaker at “Jamaica People’s Ball” this Saturday, August 10, at Terrace on the Park in Queens.\n\n“We are elated to welcome Clive Blackwood, a Jamaican-born New York resident as our keynote speaker,” Brooks told Caribbean Life on Tuesday.\n\n“Not only is Mr. Blackwood supremely accomplished, but he is also a fountain of great motivation for our Caribbean-American people” he added.\n\nBrooks said special awards for outstanding accomplishments will be awarded to Blackwood in the field of banking, during the black-tie affair, as well as to saxophonist Dean Fraser in music, assistant commissioner Lamona Worrell in community affairs in the New York City Mayor’s Office and Jamaican Olympian Veronica Campbell Brown in the field of sports.\n\nBrooks said Blackwood has “an impressive background in risk and auditing spanning over 25 years in the financial services industry.”\n\nIn June 2015, he was named executive vice president of the largest federal bank in the country, and he also became the first Black in the position, Brooks said.\n\nBlackwood was born in Kingston, the Jamaican capital, and grew up in the Waltham Park area. He is a graduate of Chetolah Park Primary School and Ardenne High School in Jamaica, and New York University.\n\nBrooks said that social media sensation Julie Mango will serve as Mistress of Ceremonies for the gala affair that has as its theme, “The Rise of the Black, Gold and Green”.\n\nJamaica on Tuesday celebrated its 62nd Anniversary of Political Independence from Great Britain.\n\nOn July 19, 1962, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the Jamaica Independence Act, granting independence effective August 6."
