        "text": "Walter Lamar Turner age 74, formerly of Gainesville, GA. was born February 26, 1945 to the late Johnny Howard and Ruby Lee Young Turner. He departed this earthly life December 30, 2019. He is preceded in death by his brother Henry Turner and two sisters Gladys Louise Turner and Sadie Belle Turner McClusky.\n\nWalter was a 1962 graduate of Fair Street High School. He moved to Los Angeles, CA and enrolled in Cal State LA where he excelled as a business student while being employed for the United States Postal Service. April 19, 1966 he was drafted into the United States Army. He ended his tour as a decorated serviceman having served in the Vietnam War. Upon his return, his love for animals seems to be satisfied by his newfound career as a much sort after dog trainer. He travels abroad training many animals and he learn to speak German and Spanish. The most notable group of dogs he trained was the Dobermanns for the movie “The Dobermann Gang”. Walter also trained police dogs for the Los Angeles County Police Department, K-9 units with the City of Buena Park, Santa Anita Law Enforcement Animal Unit, Monterey Park Police Department, and CANINE-1.\n\nHe was President of the Southern California Rottweiler Klub and an avid judge in many AKC Sanctioned B/OB Matches for the Shoreline Dog Fanciers Association of Orange County, Inc. in the 90s and early 2000’s.\n\nWalter leaves to cherish his memories to his sisters, Rosalyn Turner, Martha Turner Mays and Lisa (Herbie) Mize all of Gainesville, GA; brothers, Asberry Turner of Duluth, GA, Johnny Edward Turner of Los Angeles, CA, Jackson Larry (Karole) Turner of Kansas City, MO, Douglas (Clara) Turner and Emory Harold Turner of Gainesville, GA: one aunt, Mildred Brown of Gainesville, GA; and a host of nieces, nephews, great nieces and great nephews and other beloved relatives and friends.\n\nMemorial service will be held at St. Paul Methodist Church, Summit Street, Gainesville, GA., February 15, 2020 at 12 noon.\n\nDexter T. Sims Mortuary, LLC, Gainesville,GA"
