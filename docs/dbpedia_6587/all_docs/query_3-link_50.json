        "text": "PETERSBURG âˆ’ Police have identified the victim of Tuesday afternoon's homicide in a south Petersburg neighborhood, and they believe his shooting is connected to a later one at a motel near Interstate 95.\n\nAccording to police reports, Devere McKinney was found around 1 p.m. Tuesday in the 200 block of Holly Hill Road in the city's Oakhurst neighborhood. McKinney was taken to an area hospital where he later died.\n\nWhile investigators were at the McKinney crime scene, a woman was reported shot at a motel in the 900 block of Winfield Road. That victim's injury was deemed not life-threatening.\n\n\"Our investigation has determined that both incidents are related, and the investigation is ongoing,\" a Petersburg Police statement said. Anyone who may have information about either shooting is asked to contact Crime Solvers at (804) 861-1212 or use the P3Tips mobile app.\n\nMcKinney is Petersburg's sixth murder victim of 2024."
