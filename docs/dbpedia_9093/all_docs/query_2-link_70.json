However, Isfahan owes much of its fame to the Safavid King Shah Abbas. He built Isfahan into a central city to the status of a global importance and a symbol of art and architecture. But the history of this city is not limited to the time of Safavids and its kings. With that said, let’s explore the fascinating history of Isfahan, a city that has left an indelible mark on Iran and the world.\n\nWhy is Isfahan called Naqsh-e Jahan?\n\nIn Persian Naqsh-e Jahan means pattern of the world. When the name of the city of Isfahan comes up, it is continued with the sentence: Isfahan is Naqsh-e Jahan or it is Nesf-e Jahan (meaning it is half of the world). So why is Isfahan considered half the world? This is a actually a proverb that represents the city’s grandeur, historical significance, and beauty. It comes back to the French poet Renier, who visited Isfahan in the 16th century and described the city as “half the world.” Let’s explore the history of this city to understand better why Isfahan bears this interesting name.\n\nFounding and Early Influence\n\nIsfahan has a long past dating back to ancient times. It was once called Gabae during the Achaemenid era and later became a significant center under the Sassanian dynasty. However, it was during the Seljuq Empire (1038–1194) that Isfahan truly flourished. The Seljuqs introduced a unique Iranian architectural style, replacing traditional mosque layouts with designs centered around four Iwans (vast halls open at one end). The Great Jameh Atiq Mosque is an example of this approach.\n\nThe Safavid Dynasty and Shah Abbas\n\nThe Safavid dynasty, which ruled Persia from 1501 to 1736, left an unforgettable mark on Isfahan. Shah Abbas the Great (1588–1629) played a very important role in shaping the city. He moved the capital from Qazvin to Isfahan because of its economic potential and strategic location. Under his rule, Isfahan became a center of commerce, diplomacy, and art. Shah Abbas strengthened the Safavid empire by expelling Ottoman and Uzbek troops and creating a standing army. His reforms revitalized the state religion of Shi’a Islam, and he started trade links between Asia and Europe.\n\nArchitectural Marvels and Cultural Renaissance\n\nShah Abbas’s legacy extends beyond military victories. He transformed Isfahan into a cultural gem with building great boulevards, bridges, palaces, tiled mosques, and minarets. The Naqsh-e Jahan Square stands as a testament to the vision that he had for this city. The Safavid era witnessed a flourishing of Persian artists, with Isfahan as their main city. This is how Shah Abbas strengthened the Safavid empire. Here’s a glimpse into the major events during his reign:\n\nCapital Transformation: As we mentioned earlier, in 1598, Shah Abbas made Isfahan his capital and started building a center that transformed the city into Iran’s most beautiful urban center. Isfahan became home to the court of the Shah, the royal artists, and a center for carpet production.\n\nVisual Style and Art: Like modern leaders, Shah Abbas understood the power of visual communication. He employed a group of skilled artisans, including calligraphers, painters, bookbinders, and illuminators. Their collective efforts produced manuscripts, inscriptions, and beautiful paintings for buildings. The period witnessed a mix of traditional Persian artistry with innovative art techniques.\n\nSilk Carpets and Art: Luxury carpets woven with silk and gold became a thing of Shah Abbas’s era. These carpets adorned palaces, mosques, and residences of noble people. If you want to know more about Persian Carpets make sure you check out our video series about Persian Carpets on YouTube. The calligraphy of Ali Riza Abbasi and the portraiture by Riza-yi Abbasi changed the artistic values in a great extent. These artists captured the essence of the Safavid court and its cultural aspects.\n\nCultural Transformation: Isfahan became a very important cultural center where European and Indian traders, travelers, and adventurers communicated with various levels of Safavid society. Shah Abbas recognized the rulers of Christian Europe as potential military allies against his Ottoman enemies and as partners. The exchange of luxury Iranian silk for European gold and silver enriched both cultures.\n\nHistory of Isfahan after the reign of Safavids\n\nAfter the Safavid dynasty, Isfahan’s history took several significant turns. Let’s explore the city’s post-Safavid era:\n\nThe fall of Isfahan (1722): In 1722, Isfahan faced a six-month-long siege. The city fell during this brutal conflict. The fall marked the beginning of the end for the Safavids, as their decline had already set in due to strifeand wars with Ottoman rivals. Isfahan’s fall was a pivotal moment in Iranian history.\n\nRenovation and Transformation: Despite the decline, Isfahan remained a cultural and architectural gem. During the Safavid period, Shah Abbas had already initiated a transformation of the city. His vision led to the construction of iconic monuments and buildings that define Isfahan’s identity today. The city broke away from Seljuq tradition, embracing a new style under Shah Abbas’s rule.\n\nOverall, Isfahan’s legacy extended beyond the Safavid era. It continued to thrive as a center of art, trade, and intellectual exchange. The city’s bazaars, mosques, and gardens remained as important as before. Isfahan’s position as a crossroads between East and West persisted, leaving a mark on its cultural history. In summary, the history of this city has always been a tale of resilience, architectural beauty, and long-lasting significance in the heart of Iran.\n\nWhat are the main Attractions of Isfahan?\n\nIsfahan, with its rich history and architectural marvels, offers a variety of attractions for visitors.
