        "text": "Answer:\n\nA. balance of free states and slave states\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe Missouri Compromise of 1820 was very important for various reasons. The compromise itself resolved, for the time being, the dispute over where slavery should and could exist in recently acquired Louisiana territory. He urged that slavery did not exist above the 36 ° 30 'longitude. The exception was Missouri, which entered the Union in 1820 as a slave state under compromise.\n\nIn addition to Missouri, Maine also entered the Union as a free state (formerly part of Massachusetts) to balance the number of free and slave states in the nation. This seeks to achieve equality of slaves and free states, along with a balance in Congress.\n\nThe Compromise of 1850 was a set of laws passed in Congress that sought to address the issue of slavery, which soon divided the nation.\n\nThe legislation was highly controversial and passed only after a long series of battles on Capitol Hill. It was destined to be unpopular, as almost every part of the nation found something that disliked its provisions.\n\nYet the 1850 compromise served its purpose. It kept the Union apart for a while, and essentially delayed the outbreak of the Civil War for a decade.\n\nAnswer:\n\nB\n\nExplanation:\n\nsomeone passed this to me) 90% of people marry there 7th grade love. since u have read this, u will be told good news tonight. if u don't pass this on nine comments your worst week starts now this isn't fake. apparently if u copy and paste this on ten comments in the next ten minutes you will have the best day of your life tomorrow. you will either get kissed or asked out in the next 53 minutes someone will say i love you\n\nAnswer: Mercantilism\n\nExplanation:\n\nIt was an economic doctrine that emerged during the sixteenth century. Mercantilism was the dominant economic doctrine during the colonization of North America by England. Mercantilism maximizes the export of raw materials, and it implies the strengthening of national policy. Mercantilism was present even after the colonization of the New World. The English tried in various ways to place products on the soil of North America and enforce certain laws on the soil of the American colonies, all for economic gain. There have been many such examples throughout colonial history, and one of those laws is the Stamps Act. Mercantilism can be presented as the embryo of capitalist doctrine.\n\nAnswer:\n\nD.The national government shares power with the states.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThree things or elements make the government created by the Constitution a federal system. These include the following:\n\n1. Establishment of national government comprising of a legislative, an executive, and a judicial branch, with each performing checks and balances on one another or simply Separation of power.\n\n2. Division of governmental powers between the federal government and the state government.\n\n3. Protection of individuals or citizens rights\n\nHence, in this case, the correct answer is \"The national government shares power with the states.\"\n\nAnswer:\n\nClay ran for president five times, 1824, 1832, 1840, 1844, and 1848. In two of these elections, 1832 and 1844, he was his party’s nominee. In 1824, he was one of four candidates on the election day ballots where all of them were from the same party. He was a general election candidate three times. He lost his party’s nomination two times, both to two generals who were far less able politicians than him, William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor. Clay was nearly the nominee in both of these elections. He created the National Republican Party and the Whig Party. When the National Republican Party fell, most of its members went to the Whig Party, and when the Whig and Free Soil Party collapsed some former members made the Republican Party, mostly former Whigs, including Abraham Lincoln, who joined the new party.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn “The Farewell Address,” George Washington describes religion and morality as the two indispensable pillars which support political prosperity. He then says that we should be cautious about the idea that morality can flourish without religion and concludes with the assertion:\n\n\"Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.\"\n\nThere is considerable debate about the religious opinions of the founding fathers, including Washington. Whether he meant it or not, however, this statement is clearly false. There is no clear correlation between religious principles and national morality, let alone any good evidence that one causes the other. This would have been less clear two hundred years ago, since practically every nation had an established church, from which it was often difficult for many people to dissent publicly. Nonetheless, it is now clear that secular nations such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Belgium are sustained by a national morality at least as strong as any religious nation. These countries have low rates of crime and particularly of violent crime. They have enlightened, compassionate social policies which enjoy the support of the majority of citizens. Their presses are freer and their political systems less corrupt than the average in Europe, let alone worldwide. They conform in every material respect to the founding fathers’ notion of political prosperity.\n\nIn addition to other attitudes and behaviors, religion and morality are fundamental cornerstones of political prosperity. If someone sought to weaken these crucial bases of human happiness and the most powerful pillars of men's and citizens' obligations.\n\nWhat do you mean by morality?\n\nMorality is the separation between what is deemed proper and what is unsuitable in terms of intents, choices, and behaviors.\n\nMorality can be a set of rules or guidelines generated from a set of rules of behaviour from a specific philosophy, religion, or culture, or it can come from a rule that a person feels ought to be applied to everyone. Goodness or rightness are more exactly synonyms for morality.\n\nMeta-ethics, which examines abstract concepts like moral ontology and moral epistemology, and normative ethics, which examines more concrete frameworks for forming moral judgments like deontological ethics and consequentialism, are both branches of moral philosophy.\n\nThe Golden Rule, which argues that \"one should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself,\" is an illustration of normative ethical philosophy.\n\nWhile amorality is variously referred to as ignorance of, indifference to, or denial in any certain set of moral standards or principles, immorality is the active resistance to morality.\n\nLearn more about morality, here\n\nhttps://brainly.com/question/13107468\n\n#SPJ5\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn 1882, the British invaded and conquered Egypt to put down a revolt of Egyptian army officers. Colonel Urabi of the Egyptian army—with support from disgruntled officers—overthrew the Khedive. Urabi dressed and looked like Arab peasants who called him “el Wahid,” meaning “the only one”. (Pakenham 125). The British, of course, were worried about the Suez Canal falling into the hands of an unfriendly power. When the British sent the navy to bombard Alexandria from the sea, Egyptian mobs rampaged and killed 50 Europeans (Pakenham 132). With the Khedive’s support, the British attacked both ends of the Suez Canal, sailed to the midpoint, and rushed to Cairo, using a new railroad to transport supplies (Sayyid-Marsot 654). Urabi surrendered. The British had an army of 31,000 while Urabi had only 16,000 poorly trained troops with old rifles and swords (UNESCO 37 and James 272). Britain now held Egypt as a virtual colony, which also gave them responsibility for territory Egypt had controlled in the south, in Sudan.\n\nHOPEITHELPSYOU:-)\n\nAnswer:\n\nTheir success was limited by state governments, but they were the basis for later civil rights activism\n\nExplanation:\n\nHistorians like Eric Foner emphasize the long-term significance of the Civil War Amendments because in trying to understand the formation and establishment of rights and freedom of the colored people, they realized the significance of these amendments and that \"Civil War Amendments are otherwise known as Reconstruction Amendments, even though its success was limited by the state governments, they were the basis for later civil rights activism.\"\n\nThe Reconstruction Amendment includes the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendment, of which all of them focused on the freedom and rights of the colored people.\n\nAnswer: C. Land.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe last thirteenth colony in North America was founded in the area of Georgia. Georgia was supposed to be the first line of defense in the country's interior against possible attacks by natives or Spaniards. To attract residents to the newly formed colony, the authorities distributed free land to new settlers. Of course, there was a limit in terms of the glorified allotted plot. Authorities also initially decided that the allotted piece of land could not be sold. Authorities also banned slavery in the colony in hopes of attracting the Catholic population. These are all measures that gave good positive results in the first year after establishing the colony.\n\nThe right to remain silent best illustrates the idea put forth in the Fifth Amendment. Thus, option C is appropriate.\n\nCriminal defendants are likewise exempt from testifying under the Fifth Amendment because their testimony could lead to self-incrimination.

In addition to nine other articles, it was ratified in 1791 as a component of the Bill of Rights.\n\nCertain amendments were enacted by the Constitution's Fifth Amendment.
