Alamut Castle is the prominent legacy of the city. Besides, Sa’d al-Saltaneh caravanserai is the largest urban one that shows the importance of Qazvin in Iran.\n\nQazvin commences attracting attention to a Multinational, multicultural and inter-communication hub, where ideologies and beliefs shaped elevated civilizations. Qazvin indulges our expectations about historical knowledge, that how great empires thrived by developing infrastructures. Qazvin infrastructures are caravansaries, courier-house (chapar khaneh: royal System of communication), sanctuaries and urbanism along the royal road.\n\nSa’d al-Saltaneh Caravanserai is the largest urban one of its kind on the Silk Road and a highlight of Qazvin. The architecture consists of Iwan, Hojre (Travelers room), Dome and courtyards to provide a relaxing atmosphere for travellers and traders. Qazvin bazaar is one of the bazaars that attracted new structures with charm and charisma.\n\nSaad al-Saltanah Palace is a Safavid caravanserai in the center of the old texture of Qazvin. The old bed of this bazaar is a thousand years old, but new building has traces of Safavid and Qajar. A collection with thousands of years of memories and narrations."
