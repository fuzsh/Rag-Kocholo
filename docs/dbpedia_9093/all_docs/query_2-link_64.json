        "text": "The city of Tabriz is situated 619 km. northwest of Tehran and 150 km. from the borders of Iran and the Republic of Azarbayjan. This city is generally cold but due to its environment the climate is extremely pleasant. Rivers such as Ajy Chay, Liqvan Chay, Maidan Chay and Soofian Chay flow through this area. In an inscription related to Sangar II one of the Assyrian rulers 714 BC, the name of Tabriz has been mentioned in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD when the city of Tabriz was of great importance. For the first time in the 4th century AH., the Raavadian family proclaimed Tabriz as their capital.\n\nDuring the said period and the Mongol reign, Tabriz experienced many earthquakes causing it to become a ruined city. But after the Mongol conquests this city was made capital by 'Abaqakhan' of the Ilkhanan. During the reign of 'Mahmood Qazan' (694 AH.) the city thrived . Mosques such as Alishah, Robe Rashidy, and Shonab Qazan were constructed during this period. During the Safavid dynasty Tabriz was the capital of Iran. The Kabood Mosque is a relic from the time of the Turkamans. In later centuries Tabriz has been the seat of great warriors facing the Ottomans and Russians.\n\nPersonalities such as Sattar Khan and Baqer Khan in their fight against despotism is on historical record. In the year 1911 AD., Sheikh Mohammad Khiyabani (one of the clergymen) revolted against the colonialist policies of the British government. The Islamic revolution owes its success partly, because of the participation of the people of Tabriz and their heroic deeds."
