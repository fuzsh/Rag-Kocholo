        "text": "Twelver Shīʿa ruling dynasty of Iran (1501–1736)\n\nNot to be confused with Saffarid dynasty.\n\nSafavid dynasty\n\nدودمان صفوی,\n\nCountrySafavid IranFounded22 December 1501FounderIsmail I (1501–1524)Final rulerAbbas III (1732–1736)TitlesShahanshah of IranTraditionsTwelver Shi'ismDissolutionc. 1736\n\nThe Safavid dynasty ( ; Persian: دودمان صفوی, romanized: Dudmâne Safavi,[1] pronounced [d̪uːd̪ˈmɒːne sæfæˈviː]) was one of Iran's most significant ruling dynasties reigning from 1501 to 1736.[2] Their rule is often considered the beginning of modern Iranian history,[3] as well as one of the gunpowder empires.[4] The Safavid Shāh Ismā'īl I established the Twelver denomination of Shīʿa Islam as the official religion of the Persian Empire, marking one of the most important turning points in the history of Islam.[5] The Safavid dynasty had its origin in the Safavid order of Sufism, which was established in the city of Ardabil in the Iranian Azerbaijan region.[6] It was an Iranian dynasty of Kurdish origin,[7] but during their rule they intermarried with Turkoman,[8] Georgian,[9] Circassian, and Pontic Greek[12] dignitaries, nevertheless, for practical purposes, they were Turkish-speaking and Turkified.[13] From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over parts of Greater Iran and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region,[14] thus becoming the first native dynasty since the Sasanian Empire to establish a national state officially known as Iran.[15]\n\nThe Safavids ruled from 1501 to 1722 (experiencing a brief restoration from 1729 to 1736 and 1750 to 1773) and, at their height, controlled all of what is now Iran, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Armenia, eastern Georgia, parts of the North Caucasus including Russia, Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, as well as parts of Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\n\nDespite their demise in 1736, the legacy that they left behind was the revival of Iran as an economic stronghold between East and West, the establishment of an efficient state and bureaucracy based upon \"checks and balances\", their architectural innovations, and patronage for fine arts.[3] The Safavids have also left their mark down to the present era by establishing Twelver Shīʿīsm as the state religion of Iran, as well as spreading Shīʿa Islam in major parts of the Middle East, Central Asia, Caucasus, Anatolia, the Persian Gulf, and Mesopotamia.[3][5]\n\nGenealogy and identity\n\nThe Safavid Kings themselves claimed to be sayyids,[16] family descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, although many scholars have cast doubt on this claim.[17] There seems now to be a consensus among scholars that the Safavid family hailed from Iranian Kurdistan,[5] and later moved to Iranian Azerbaijan, finally settling in the 11th century CE at Ardabil. Traditional pre-1501 Safavid manuscripts trace the lineage of the Safavids to the Kurdish dignitary, Firuz-Shah Zarrin-Kolah.[18][19]\n\nAccording to historians,[20][21] including Vladimir Minorsky[22] and Roger Savory, the Safavids were Turkish speakers of Iranian origin:[23]\n\nFrom the evidence available at the present time, it is certain that the Safavid family was of indigenous Iranian stock, and not of Turkish ancestry as it is sometimes claimed. It is probable that the family originated in Persian Kurdistan, and later moved to Azerbaijan, where they adopted the Azari form of Turkish spoken there, and eventually settled in the small town of Ardabil sometimes during the eleventh century.\n\nBy the time of the establishment of the Safavid empire, the members of the family were Turkicized and Turkish-speaking,[24] and some of the Shahs composed poems in their then-native Turkish language. Concurrently, the Shahs themselves also supported Persian literature, poetry and art projects including the grand Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp,[25][26] while members of the family and some Shahs composed Persian poetry as well.[27][28]\n\nThe authority of the Safavids was religiously based, and their claim to legitimacy was founded on being direct male descendants of Ali,[29] the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, and regarded by the Shiʻa as the first Imam.\n\nFurthermore, the dynasty was from the very start thoroughly intermarried with both Pontic Greek as well as Georgian lines.[30] In addition, from the official establishment of the dynasty in 1501, the dynasty would continue to have many intermarriages with both Circassian as well as again Georgian dignitaries, especially with the accession of Tahmasp I.\n\nSafavid Shahs of Iran\n\nSee also: List of Safavid monarchs\n\nIsmail I 1501–1524\n\nTahmasp I 1524–1576\n\nIsmail II 1576–1578\n\nMohammad Khodabanda 1578–1587\n\nAbbas I 1587–1629\n\nSafi 1629–1642\n\nAbbas II 1642–1666\n\nSuleiman I 1666–1694\n\nSoltan Hoseyn 1694–1722\n\nTahmasp II 1722–1732\n\nAbbas III 1732–1736\n\nMothers of Safavid Shahs\n\nCulture\n\nThe Safavid family was a literate family from its early origin. There are extant Tati and Persian poetry from Shaykh Safi ad-din Ardabili as well as extant Persian poetry from Shaykh Sadr ad-din. Most of the extant poetry of Shah Ismail I is in Azerbaijani pen-name of Khatai.[31] Sam Mirza, the son of Shah Ismail as well as some later authors assert that Ismail composed poems both in Turkish and Persian but only a few specimens of his Persian verse have survived.[32] A collection of his poems in Azeri were published as a Divan. Shah Tahmasp who has composed poetry in Persian was also a painter, while Shah Abbas II was known as a poet, writing Azerbaijani verses.[33] Sam Mirza, the son of Ismail I was himself a poet and composed his poetry in Persian. He also compiled an anthology of contemporary poetry.[34]\n\nSafavid dynasty art\n\nSee also\n\nKhanates of the Caucasus\n\nList of Shi'a Muslim dynasties\n\nPersianate states\n\nSafavid art\n\nSafavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam\n\nTrade in Iran's Safavid era\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nBlow, David (2009).
