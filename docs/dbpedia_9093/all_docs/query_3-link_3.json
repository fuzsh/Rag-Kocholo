        "text": "Arts of the book: The royal manuscripts, single-sheet miniatures, and muraqqa albums\n\nRoyal manuscripts provide a glimpse into the fusion of regional styles used in early Safavid art. The best artists from across the empire traveled to work at the royal workshop in Tabriz, a city in northwestern Iran that was the first capital of the Safavid dynasty. Bihzad, the famed miniaturist from Herat, was commissioned by Shah Ismail to direct this royal workshop. Here, Bihzad helped establish the birth of a new Safavid aesthetic—a hybrid of the colorful expressionism and naturalistic rendering of the dynasties that preceded the Safavids.\n\nThis fusion of artistic styles is best glimpsed in the story of The Court of the Gayumars, a tale which recounts the mythic origins of Persian kings in the opening of the Shahnameh (the Book of Kings). The Shahnameh is an eleventh-century epic composed by the poet Firdausi. It is one of the most important pieces of Persian literature and records the sweeping history of Persia, from its mythical origins up until the Islamic conquest in the seventh century.\n\nIn 1522, the Safavid royal library of Shah Tahmasp produced the most exquisitely illustrated Shahnameh of all time, now known as the “Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp.” Royal manuscripts such as this were highly collaborative enterprises that brought together miniaturists, illuminators, calligraphers, poets, scribes, and gold sprinklers. The Court of the Gayumars is renowned for its precision of line and attention to the finest of detail, whether in the rendering of a flowering tree or the sable fur lining the robe of the enthroned king.\n\nAround the middle of the sixteenth century, a trend developed for stand-alone illustrations of popular stories, including the Shahnameh, but encompassing other folkloric literature. This had to do with a decline in the patronage of large scale manuscripts as well as the rise of a market outside of the royal workshop. Safavid artists sold single-sheets and painted miniatures at markets and coffee houses. Whereas manuscripts (hand-made books) included detailed landscapes, margin illustration, background figures, and calligraphic text, single folio paintings featured only the most important and iconic scene from the story (such as A Young Lady Reclining After a Bath).\n\nRather than confined within the binding of books, individual miniatures were mobile. Royal elites collaged them into muraqqa—albums in which miniatures from different sources were collected together (muraqqa translates to “that which has been patched together”). Every muraqqa album was entirely different from the next and they brought together excerpts from Persian poetry, calligraphic scripts, miniature paintings, and design motifs.\n\nSafavid textiles: Shah Abbas and the rise of Safavid silk\n\nScenes from popular stories and floral motifs were applied just as easily to the pages of books as they were to walls of palaces and, most commonly, to designs woven into silk and velvet textiles. The silk industry of early modern Iran was one of the cornerstones of the Safavid economy. While silk had always been a highly sought after Persian commodity, dating back to ancient times, the Safavid era produced one of the most lucrative silk industries of the early modern world.\n\nWhen Shah Abbas I came to power in 1588, he immediately began making plans to move the Safavid capital to Isfahan, a city in central Iran. This was a strategic move that accomplished two things. First, by bringing the capital closer to the center of the empire and away from the Ottoman border, it safeguarded the court from the Turks. Second, it brought the royal workshops closer to the silk route, making it easier for the Safavids to control the sale of Persian silk.\n\nSilk was akin to gold in this era, and Safavid silk was renowned for both the high quality of its raw silk, as well as the exquisite designs of their embroidered textiles. Europeans imported some of the highest volumes of Safavid textiles. For this reason, many silks used floral and vegetal motifs that appealed to both Persian and foreign markets. The most popular of these themes was the Persian gol o bol-bol (the rose and the nightingale). The rose and nightingale motif was both a literary and decorative theme in Persian culture, symbolizing earthly and spiritual love. In its beauty and perfection, the rose represented the beloved (though its thorns also warned of love’s cruelty), while the doting nightingale, lost in song of longing and devotion, represented the lover. In mystical Islamic poetry, the thirst of the nightingale for the rose was also a metaphor for the soul’s yearning for its union with God. Textiles often included scenes from gardens of paradise. When placed on the floor of palaces and mosques, depictions of verdant florals suggested one was in fact within a garden.\n\nThe Ardabil carpet, produced during the early period of the Safavid era, is a powerful example of Safavid carpets that resembled heavenly gardens. It also demonstrates the unmatched quality of Safavid weaving and textile design. In the composition of the carpet’s layout, the borders and margins demonstrate how manuscript illumination and the arts of the book carried over into textile design as well. The Ardabil carpet was commissioned for the shrine of Safi al-Din, the founder of the original Safavid order who was also a Sufi sheikh. Textiles were an important architectural and decorative component of the many religious shrines commissioned by Safavid shahs.\n\nArchitecture: palaces, mosques, shrines\n\nThe Safavids commissioned and built hundreds of monuments during their reign, making them some of the most productive builders in all of Iranian history. The main types of buildings constructed during this time were mosques, palaces, markets, shrines and caravansaries (structures used to shelter travelers during long journeys). While the decoration of each of these buildings varied, the structural composition remained much the same, consisting of domes surrounded by four iwans (or ivans)—rooms that open on one side to a courtyard often framed by pointed arches. This modular layout could be expanded or contracted, creating both monumental and intimate spaces.\n\nThe palaces of the Safavid era, such as the Ali Qapu (Royal Gate) and Chehel Sotoun (Forty Columns) palaces in Isfahan, are remarkable for their decorative figural frescoes. Murals of women decorate the lower level of the Ali Qapu, hinting at the uppermost level of the palace, the harem, a space reserved for the shah and his female attendants. The murals of the Chehel Sotoun, on the other hand, were painted with group scenes of diplomatic receptions and notable battles. These figural murals are one of the defining and unique features of Safavid architectural decor, and are not found as often in Ottoman or Mughal palaces.\n\nAnother singular characteristic of Safavid architecture are the colorful tiles that covered exterior faced and interior domes of mosques. Known as haft-rangi, or “seven-colors,” the Safavids developed a new glazing technology that allowed them to produce polychromatic tiles. A beautiful example of these can be found on the exterior façade of the Shah Mosque (or Royal Mosque) in the main square of Isfahan. Turquoise, lapis, white, and hints of green are all harmoniously blended into the tiled façade. This replaced the old method of cutting single-color tiles and rearranging them into the desired geometric pattern. Haft-rangi tiles produced the effect of façades that glittered in the sunlight of the Iranian plateau, a light noted by visitors far and wide for its clear and iridescent brightness. In addition to multi-colored tiles, Safavids also decorated the surfaces of their walls with “aineh-kari,” or “mirror work,” which consisted of small fragments of mirrors configured into mosaic and geometric patterns. The reflective light of the sun refracted rays of light from the mirrored walls, a brilliant effect heightened by the placement of reflecting pools of water at the courtyard entrances to palaces.\n\nMirror mosaics were used in religious spaces as well, especially in Shi’a mosques and shrines to important Shi’a saints. The reflective light symbolized the presence and light of God, who was conceived as a mirror of the divine realm. Started in the Safavid period, mirror mosaics became an enduring Persian decorative motif that was used by the subsequent dynasties. While used primarily in mosques and shrines, fragments of these mirror mosaics can still be seen in the outdoor portals of the Chehel Sotoun palace, as well as on the columns of the Ali Qapu palace."
