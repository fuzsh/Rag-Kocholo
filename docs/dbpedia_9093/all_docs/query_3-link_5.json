        "text": "The Safavids were still faced with the problem of making their empire pay. The silk trade, over which the government held a monopoly, was a primary source of revenue. Ismāʿīl’s successor, Ṭahmāsp I (reigned 1524–76), encouraged carpet weaving on the scale of a state industry. ʿAbbās I (reigned 1588–1629) established trade contacts directly with Europe, but Iran’s remoteness from Europe, behind the imposing Ottoman screen, made maintaining and promoting these contacts difficult and sporadic. ʿAbbās also transplanted a colony of industrious and commercially astute Armenians from Jolfā in Azerbaijan to a new Jolfā adjacent to Eṣfahān, the city he developed and adorned as his capital. The Safavids had earlier moved their capital from the vulnerable Tabrīz to Qazvīn. After eliminating the Uzbek menace from east of the Caspian Sea in 1598–99, ʿAbbās could move his capital south to Eṣfahān, more centrally placed than Qazvīn for control over the whole country and for communication with the trade outlets of the Persian Gulf. ʿAbbās engaged English help to oust the Portuguese from the island of Hormuz in 1622. He also strove to lodge Safavid power strongly in Khorāsān. There, at Mashhad, he developed the shrine of ʿAlī al-Riḍā, the eighth Shiʿi imam, as a pilgrimage center to rival Shiʿi holy places in Mesopotamia, where visiting pilgrims took currency out of Safavid and into Ottoman territory.\n\nSupreme Political/Religious Authority:\n\nLeader: Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei\n\nHead Of State And Government:\n\nPresident: Masoud Pezeshkian\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 87,529,000\n\nCurrency Exchange Rate:\n\n1 USD equals 41932.958 Iranian rial\n\nUnder ʿAbbās, Iran prospered. The monarch continued the policy begun under his predecessors of eradicating the old Sufi bands and ghulāt extremists whose support had been crucial in building the state. The Kizilbash were replaced by a standing army of slave soldiers loyal only to the shah, who were trained and equipped on European lines with the advice of the English adventurer Robert Sherley. Sherley was versed in artillery tactics and, accompanied by a party of cannon founders, reached Qazvīn with his brother Anthony in 1598. The bureaucracy, too, was carefully reorganized, but the seeds of the sovereignty’s weakness lay in the royal house itself, which lacked an established system of inheritance by primogeniture. A reigning shah’s nearest and most acute objects of suspicion were his own sons. Among them, brother plotted against brother over who should succeed on their father’s death. Intriguers, ambitious for influence in a subsequent reign, supported one prince against another. ʿAbbās did not adopt the Ottoman sultans’ practice of eliminating royal males by murder (as a child he had been within a hair’s breadth of being a victim of such a policy). Instead, he instituted the practice of immuring infant princes in palace gardens away from the promptings of intrigue and the world at large. As a result, his successors tended to be indecisive men, easily dominated by powerful dignitaries among the Shiʿi ulama—whom the shahs themselves had urged to move in large numbers from the shrine cities of Iraq in an attempt to bolster Safavid legitimacy as an orthodox Shiʿi dynasty.\n\nThe Afghan interlude\n\nḤusayn I (reigned 1694–1722) was of a pious temperament and was especially influenced by the Shiʿi divines, whose conflicting advice, added to his own procrastination, sealed the sudden and unexpected fate of the Safavid empire. One Maḥmūd, a former Safavid vassal in Afghanistan, captured Eṣfahān and murdered Ḥusayn in his cell in the beautiful madrasah (religious school) built in his mother’s name.\n\nThe Afghan interlude was disastrous for Iran. In 1723 the Ottomans, partly to secure more territory and partly to forestall Russian aspirations in the Caucasus, took advantage of the disintegration of the Safavid realm and invaded from the west, ravaging western Persia. Nādr, an Afshārid Turkmen from northern Khorāsān, was eventually able to reunite Iran, a process he began on behalf of the Safavid prince Ṭahmāsp II (reigned 1722–32), who had escaped the Afghans. After Nādr had cleared the country of Afghans, Ṭahmāsp made him governor of a large area of eastern Iran."
