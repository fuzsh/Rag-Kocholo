        "text": "With its roots tracing back to the Safavid dynasty, Qazvin has a rich historical and cultural heritage that has left an indelible mark on its present-day identity. Renowned as the calligraphy capital of Iran, Qazvin exudes an air of artistic elegance, evident in its traditional confectioneries, intricate carpet patterns, and flourishing poetry scene. The city’s political significance and influence on the Pahlavi accent add layers to its multifaceted charm.\n\nAs you walk through its bustling streets, you’ll encounter remnants of its storied history intertwined with the pulse of modern life. Situated approximately 150 kilometers northwest of Tehran, Qazvin’s lofty altitude of about 1,800 meters above sea level lends it a unique climate characterized by chilly yet dry weather, owing to its strategic location south of the rugged Alborz range. Join us as we explore the must-visit attractions in Qazvin.\n\nAlamut Castle\n\nAlamut Castle stands majestically on the heights, surrounded by massive precipices and deep crevices. Access to the castle is limited to a narrow trail to its north. The castle consists of an eastern and western sector, each further divided into lower and upper segments. The structure spans approximately 120 meters in length and varies in width from 10 to 25 meters in different areas. The upper castle’s eastern rampart, built from stone and gypsum, rises about 10 meters long and 5 meters high. To the northwest, chambers carved into the mountains contain a small water pool.\n\nThe northern rampart extends 12 meters and ends at a steep drop. The eastern section once housed guards and their families, while the western rampart still stands at 2 meters high. Three water reservoirs are carved into the mountains, and ramparts divide the area between the upper and lower castles. Three towers are located at the northern, southern, and eastern corners. The only entrance is northeast, reached via a path below the eastern tower.\n\nConstructed from stone, mortar, gypsum, brick, tiles, and earthenware, Alamut Castle is a significant historical site near an ancient cemetery and remnants of brick kilns.

The western entrance has a wooden door, leading to a basement tomb covered by a quadrangular chamber with turquoise-tiled cornices. Sacred verses in the Naskh script adorn the dome’s base, while the stone floor and brick ceiling highlight the tomb’s architecture. The vaulted segment, renovated due to damage, contains an azure inscription in the Nasta’liq script detailing Mostowfi’s biography. This historic mausoleum reflects the rich cultural heritage of the Mongol period.\n\nKharaqan Towers\n\nThe Kharaqan Towers, dating back to the Seljuk era, are built over the tombs of notable Seljuk figures Abu Saeed Bijar and Abu Mansour Iltay. Located 1 km from Hesar Armani village and 32 km along the Qazvin-Hamadan Road, these towers are close yet positioned in a vast area. The eastern tower, octagonal with round pillars at each corner, was repaired in 1968. The tower is made entirely of bricks and features decorative internal arch designs and a double-crusted dome from the 5th century AH. An inscription at the entrance reveals the construction date and architect’s name, Mohammad Ebne Mokr Zandjani Al Qobba, in 460 AH.\n\nThe western tower, octagonal with round columns, displays prominent brick ledges and geometrical designs on the upper dome.

The Sanjideh Mosque’s enduring presence and unique design offer a glimpse into the religious and cultural heritage of the Seljuk era.\n\nKabir Jame Mosque\n\nKabir Jame Mosque, located on Shohada Avenue in Qazvin, dates back to the Saljuqi and Safavid periods. The mosque features a large rectangular courtyard with a central pool and elevated porches on all four sides. The northern porch is flanked by two striking minarets, and each side of the porch has long porticos. The most ancient part of the mosque is a small domed structure leading to the eastern entrance corridor, known as the Harooni arch, constructed in 192 AH under Haroon-Ol Rashid.\n\nThe mosque also has a double brick dome from the Saljuqi era, which is considered an architectural masterpiece. Significant additions, such as the Khomar Tashi area and the nocturnal sections, were made during the 6th century AH. The porch and platform in front of the domed Saljuqi area were built in 1069 AH during the Safavid period. The northern porch and its minarets have undergone numerous repairs, reflecting the mosque’s ongoing historical significance and architectural grandeur.\n\nImamzadeh Shahzadeh Hossein\n\nImamzadeh Shahzadeh Hossein in Qazvin is the resting place of Hossein, the son of Hazrat Ali Ebne Moosa-Al Reza (AS), who passed away in 201 AH. The original structure dates back to the era of Shah Safi, with the earliest dated element being a wooden sepulcher from 806 AH. The mausoleum has undergone renovations, especially in the early 14th century AH. The complex includes an entrance, a courtyard, and the mausoleum itself.\n\nThe entrance features intricate geometric tilework and is flanked by minarets. The main dome is centrally positioned among four porches. Inside the courtyard, a large octagonal structure serves as a water source, with an inscription on top. The mausoleum’s walls have false arches, enhancing its architectural beauty. The overall structure resembles a castle, providing visitors a significant historical and religious site.\n\nQazvin Bazaar\n\nQazvin Bazaar, a remnant of the Safavid period, showcases remarkable architectural elements. The bazaar originated in pre-Safavid times and saw significant expansion during the Safavid dynasty. Each alley was designated for a specific guild, and every segment included a mosque, bath, and arcade. The Qeisarieh section has four entrances leading to various arcades and intersections. Notable areas within the bazaar include the Sarbaz Arcade, its double-story structure and arched entrance adorned with hunting scenes and floral designs on yellow and pink tiles.\n\nThe Covered Arcade, a two-story structure, is located south of Qeisarieh, while the Haj Sayed Kazem Arcade, opposite the leather merchant alley, is currently a hub for leather products. The Razavi Arcade, constructed by Haj Seyed Abol Qasem Razavi Esfahani, is known for timber trading. The Dervish Mehdi Arcade and Haj Mohammad Taqi Arcade are areas for dispatching goods and merchandise. This vibrant bazaar remains a testament to Qazvin’s rich commercial history.\n\nLambsar Castle\n\nLambsar Castle, also known as Lamasar, Lambasar, or Lambesar, was likely the largest and most fortified of the Ismaili castles. Located in the central Alborz mountains and about 120 km from Tehran, this fortress stands northeast of Razmian village. Kiya Buzurg Ummid, appointed by Hassan-i Sabbah, captured the castle from Rasamuj and transformed it into a formidable stronghold with local labor. Today, only ruins remain, but the deep valleys surrounding it make it nearly inaccessible from the east and west. The north and south fronts offer the only possible entry points, with the castle stretching 480 meters from north to south and spanning 190 meters in width.\n\nThe imposing two-layered parapets, made of 10-meter-high stones, and the main northern building with 1.2-meter-thick stone walls and remarkable water reservoirs and grain stores in the southern parts highlight the castle’s strategic and architectural ingenuity. Lambsar Castle played a crucial role as a defensive stronghold against the Mongol invasions in its final days. Despite a resilient defense, a cholera epidemic led to its fall in January 1257, followed by Hulaku Khan’s order to destroy the fort and execute the survivors. Subsequent attempts to recapture the castle in 1275 and 1389 were short-lived, marking the end of this significant historical fortress.\n\nExplore Qazvin with Visit Our Iran\n\nQazvin, a city steeped in history and culture, is a fascinating destination for travelers seeking to experience Iran’s rich heritage.
