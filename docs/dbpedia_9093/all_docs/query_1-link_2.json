        "text": "Province of Iran\n\nNot to be confused with Qazvin County.\n\nFor the city, see Qazvin.\n\nProvince in Region 1, Iran\n\nQazvin province (Persian: استان قزوین; IPA: [ɢæzˈviːn] ⓘ)[a] is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. It is in the northwest of the country, with the city of Qazvin as its capital.[5]\n\nThe province was carved out of Tehran province in 1993. The province was made a part of Region 1 upon the division of the provinces into 5 regions solely for coordination and development purposes on June 22, 2014.[1]\n\nQazvin was the location of a former capital of the Persian Empire and contains over 2000 architectural and archeological sites. It is a provincial capital today that has been a cultural center of mass throughout history.\n\nArcheological findings in the Qazvin plain reveal the existence of urban agricultural settlements as far back as 7000 BC. The name “Qazvin” or “Kasbin” is derived from Cas, an ancient tribe that lived south of the Caspian Sea millennia ago. The Caspian Sea itself in fact derives its name from the same origin. Qazvin geographically connects Tehran, Isfahan, and the Persian Gulf to the Caspian seacoast and Asia Minor, hence its strategic location throughout the ages.\n\nQazvin has been a hotbed of historical developments in Iranian history. In the early years of the Islamic era Qazvin served as a base for the Muslim forces. Destroyed by Genghis Khan (13th century), the Safavid monarchs made Qazvin the capital of the Safavid empire in 1548 only to have it moved to Isfahan in 1598. During the Qajar dynasty and contemporary period, Qazvin has always been one of the most important governmental centers due to its proximity to Tehran. Abbas Mirza, a Crown Prince and Minister of Commerce, was also the governor of Qazvin.\n\nQazvin is situated close to Alamut, where the famous Hasan-i Sabbah, founder of the secret Ismaili order of the Assassins, operated from.\n\nQazvin is where the coup d'état of General Reza Khan, with his Russian-trained Cossack brigade, was launched from – which led to the founding of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1921.\n\n1962 Buin Zahra earthquake killed 12.225 people.\n\nThe majority of people in the northeast of the province, in Alamut, are Mazandarani or Gilaks who speak a dialect of the Mazandarani[6][7][8] or Gilaki language.[9][10] However, other sources claim that the majority of people in Alamut are ‘Tats’.[11][12]\n\nAt the time of the 2006 National Census, the province's population was 1,127,734 in 294,305 households.[13] The following census in 2011 counted 1,201,565 inhabitants living in 352,472 households, of whom 68.05% lived in cities and 31.95% in villages.[14] The 2016 census measured the population of the province as 1,273,761 people in 397,165 households.[3]\n\nThe population history and structural changes of Qazvin Province's administrative divisions over three consecutive censuses are shown in the following table.\n\nQazvin Province Counties 2006[13] 2011[14] 2016[3] Abyek 89,334 93,844 94,536 Alborz 182,046 203,276 242,865 Avaj[b] — — 43,798 Buin Zahra 153,873 164,723 122,994 Qazvin 530,961 566,773 596,932 Takestan 171,520 172,949 172,636 Total 1,127,734 1,201,565 1,273,761\n\nAccording to the 2016 census, 952,149 people (nearly 75% of the population of Qazvin Province) live in the following cities:[3]\n\nCity Population Abgarm 6,336 Abyek 60,107 Alvand 93,836 Ardak 5,043 Avaj 5,142 Bidestan 18,060 Buin Zahra 20,823 Danesfahan 9,434 Eqbaliyeh 55,066 Esfarvarin 12,371 Khak-e Ali 3,148 Khorramdasht 6,554 Kuhin 1,411 Mahmudabad Nemuneh 21,982 Moallem Kalayeh 2,223 Mohammadiyeh 90,513 Narjeh 5,604 Qazvin 402,748 Razmian 1,253 Sagzabad 5,492 Shal 15,290 Sharifiyeh 20,347 Sirdan 805 Takestan 80,299 Ziaabad 8,262\n\nThe province covers 15821 km2 between 48–45 to 50–50 east of Greenwich Meridian of longitude and 35–37 to 36–45 north latitude of the equator. The province is bounded on the north by Mazandaran and Gilan, on the west by Hamedan and Zanjan, on the south by Markazi and on the east by Tehran Provinces. The famous mountains of the province are those of Siälän, Shäh Alborz, Khashchäl, Sephidkouh, Shojä e din, Alehtareh, Rämand, Ägh dägh, Kharaghän, Saridagh, Soltan pïr, and Siähkouh, in which Siälän with a height of 4,175m and Shäh Alborz which is 4,056m are the highest. All are part of the central chain of Alborz. The lowest point of the province is in Tärom e Soflä.\n\nThe climate of the province in the northern parts is cold and snowy in winters and temperate in summers. In the southern parts, the climate is mild with comparatively cold winters and warm summers.\n\nQazvin contains several archeological excavations dating back 9,000 years. There are also 23 castles from the Ismaili Assassins nearby as well. And in the middle of the city, there lies the ruins of Meimoon Ghal'eh, one of several Sassanid edifices in the area.\n\nQazvin contains few buildings from the Safavi era when it was capital of Persia. Perhaps the most famous of the surviving edifices is the Ali Qapu mansion, today a museum in central Qazvin.\n\nAfter Islam, the abundant attendance of mystics (ascetics), as well as the prevalence of tradition (Hadith), religious jurisprudence (Fegh´h), and philosophy in Qazvin, led to the emergence of many mosques and religious schools among which the most magnificent ones are:\n\nJame e Atigh Mosque: One of the oldest mosques in Iran constructed by the orders of Harun al-Rashid in 807AD. In spite of the devastating Mongol invasion, this mosque still stands today in its full glory.\n\nHeidarieh Mosque: Renovated by Amir Khomär-täsh after the earthquake of 1119 AD, the history of construction of this mosque goes back to pre-Islam, where it was a fire temple.\n\nMasjed Al-nabi (Soltani Mosque): With an area of 14000 m2, this mosque is one of the most glorious mosques of antiquity, built in the Safavid period.\n\nSanjideh Mosque: Another mosque of Qazvin dating back to pre-Islamic Iran; a former fire temple. Its present-day form is attributed to the Seljukian era.\n\nPanjeh Ali Mosque: A former place of worship for royal harem members in the Safavid period.\n\nPeighambarieh School-Mosque: Founded 1644 according to inscription.\n\nPeighambarieh Shrine: Where four Jewish saints who foretold the coming of Christ, are buried.[16][17][18]\n\nMolla Verdikhani School-Mosque: founded in 1648.\n\nSalehieh School-Mosque: founded in 1845.\n\nSheikhol Islam School-Mosque: renovated in 1903.\n\nEltefatieh School: Dating back to the Il-Khanid period.\n\nSardar School- Mosque: Made by two brothers Hossein Khan and Hassan Khan Sardar in 1815, as a fulfillment of their promise if they came back victorious from a battle against the Russians.\n\nQazvin contains three buildings built by the Russians in the late 19th/early 20th century. Among these is the current Mayor's office (former Ballet Hall), a water reservoir, and the Cantor church where a Russian pilot is buried.\n\nAccording to explorers Pietro Della Valle, Jean Baptist Tavenier, Johannes Chardin, and others, there have been many Christians of various sects living in Qazvin for centuries. Qazvin is the location of the Saint Hripsime church, and it is also where four Jewish prophets gave tidings of the arrival of Jesus Christ. Their tomb is now a popular shrine called Peighambariyeh.\n\nThese are castles and fortifications left over mostly from the Isma'ili movement of the Middle Ages:\n\nAlamout Castle\n\nLambesar Castle\n\nShirkouh Castle\n\nQez Qaleh Castle\n\nShemiran Castle\n\nMeimoon Ghal'eh\n\nBarajin Qaleh\n\nAnother grand attraction in Qazvin Province, is the tombs of two Saljuki era princes, Aboo Saeed Bijar son of Sad and Aboo Mansoor Iltai son of Takin, that are located in two separate towers known as the Kharaghan twin towers. Constructed in 1067, these are the first monuments in Islamic Architecture which include a non-conic two-layered dome.\n\nBoth towers were severely damaged by a devastating earthquake in March 2003.\n\nSome popular shrines and Mausoleums in Qazvin Province are:\n\nImamzadeh Hossein\n\nPeighambarieh (where 4 Jewish prophets are buried)\n\nImamzadeh Ismail\n\nAmeneh Khatoon\n\nZobeideh Khatoon (that has also a unique traditional water reservoir)\n\nImamzadeh Abazar\n\nImamzadeh Abdollah and Imamzadeh Fazlollah in Farsajin\n\nImamzadeh Vali in Ziaabad\n\nImamzadeh Kamal in Heydarieh\n\nImamzadeh Ali in Shekarnab\n\nHaft Sandoogh Pilgrimage Place\n\nTombs of Hassan Abad and Shahkouh\n\nSoltan Veis\n\nMausoleum of Pir e Takestan\n\nKafar Gonbad\n\nHamdollah Mostowfi's Tomb\n\nImam Ahmad Ghazali's Tomb\n\nMolla Khalila's Tomb\n\nShahid Sales' Tomb\n\nRaeesol Mojahedin's Tomb\n\nIn the old days, Qazvin was nicknamed the 'city of water reservoirs'. Of the 100 or so water reservoirs of Qazvin, only 10 remain today, all protected by the Provincial Cultural Heritage Organization.

In Qajar period there existed nine gates surrounding the city which were connected to each other through a wall around the city. These gates (darvāzeh in Persian) were:\n\nPanbeh Riseh\n\nSheikh Abad\n\nRasht\n\nMaghlävak\n\nKhandaghbar\n\nShahzadeh Hossein\n\nMossala\n\nTehran\n\nRäh e Koushk\n\nDue to 20th century hasty urban expansion, only the last two gates remain standing.

These are fed by numerous subterranean canals, deep and semi-deep wells, and a large irrigating canal which originates from The Sangbän dam in Taleghän and Ziärän. The agricultural produce of the land is grape, hazelnut, pistachio, almond, walnut, olive, apple, wheat, barley, sugar beet, pomegranate, fig, and cereals. Animal husbandry, and aquatic and poultry breeding are developed throughout the province.[citation needed]\n\nIn recent decades, Qazvin has become a developing pole of the country, primarily due to its preferable location. Qazvin today is a center of textile trade, including cotton, silk and velvet, in addition to leather. It is on the railroad line and the highway between Tehran and Tabriz.\n\nQazvin has one of the largest power plants feeding electricity into Iran's national power grid, the Shahid Raja'i facility, which provides 7% of the country's electricity.[citation needed]\n\nImam Khomeini International University\n\nIslamic Azad University of Takestan\n\nIslamic Azad University of Qazvin\n\nQazvin University of Medical Sciences\n\nShahid Babaee Technical Institute\n\nAli Akbar Dehkhoda: Prominent linguist and author of Iran's first modern Persian dictionary, was originally from Qazvin.\n\nObeid Zakani\n\nHamdollah Mostowfi: The great Il-Khanid historian and writer (1281–1349) and author of The Selected History (Tarikh Gozideh), Nezhatol Qoloub and Zafar Nameh. The turquoise conic dome and its inscription in Sols calligraphy in which Mostowfi's family tree and his works are introduced are the features that distinguish the tomb from other historical monuments of Qazvin.\n\nTáhirih\n\nDineh Kuh\n\nIran portal"
