It features beautifully designed sections such as the Sarbineh (changing room), Mian-dar (intermediate room), and Garmkhaneh (hot room). Today, the bathhouse is managed by the Qazvin Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization.

The Sardar-e Bozorg Water Reservoir is one of the largest in Iran and is open to visitors. Other notable reservoirs include the Haj Kazem Water Reservoir on Tabriz Street and the Jameh Mosque Water Reservoir in Qazvin. Many of these reservoirs feature architectural masterpieces such as exquisite tile work, arches, and beautiful windcatchers.

Ask local guides or the ticket sales staff to explain how these reservoirs were used in the past, as it can be an interesting topic for you and your children.\n\nJameh Mosque of Qazvin\n\nThis very old mosque is located on the famous Sepah Street. The Jameh Mosque of Qazvin is considered the oldest grand mosque in Iran. Also known as the Atigh Mosque, it is registered on Iran’s National Heritage List. The historical mosque was built on the remains of a Sassanian fire temple. Harun al-Rashid ordered the construction of this mosque in 192 AH. The mosque features beautiful brickwork and tile work decorations.\n\nHoseynie Aminiha\n\nDuring the Qajar era, this mosque was the home of the wealthiest person in Qazvin, Haj Mohammad Reza Amini. He used the best architects, woodworkers, plasterers, and mirror workers for the construction of this house. The house has several courtyards, two of which contain rooms with orosi (traditional wooden lattice) doors. The most interesting part of the house is the orosi doors, which can be completely removed from their frames during Ramadan or religious ceremonies to combine all spaces. The carpets in the orosi rooms were specially designed and woven for these rooms. Today, the house belongs to the descendants of Haj Amini and is constantly being renovated. To visit the house, go to Molavi Street and ring the bell. If you are traveling with a tour group, this house will likely be one of your stops. You can plan your visit to this house after visiting the Qajar Bathhouse and on the way to the bazaar.\n\nAlamut Castle and Evan Lake\n\nThe Alamut region of Qazvin is one of the most beautiful areas in western Iran. The region is home to numerous historical castles belonging to the Ismailis, the most famous of which is Alamut Castle.
