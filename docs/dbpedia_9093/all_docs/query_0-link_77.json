In the early ors of the Islamic era Qazvin served as a base for e Arab forces. Following destroyed by Genghis Khan, the Safavid monarchs made Qazvin the capital of the Safavid empire in 1548 only to have it moved to Isfahān in 1598. During the Qajar Dynasty and contemporary period, Qazvin has always been one of the most important governmental centers due to its proximity to Tehrān.
