        "text": "Jennifer Marie Anne Berry-Pipkin, 58, passed away in Indianapolis, on May 16, after a hard-fought battle with leukemia.\n\nBorn and raised in Indianapolis, she graduated from Roncalli High School in 1981. She worked for the Indianapolis Star before embarking on a 37-year career with the United States Postal Service. Throughout her tenure, she welcomed customers at branch locations at Garfield, Lawrence, Nora, and Bacon Stations and downtown at the Andrew Jacobs, Jr, Post Office. She ended her service at the US District Post Office in Indianapolis.\n\nShe will be remembered for her gifted mind. For record-time completion of jigsaws and crosswords. For a standing 8 pm reservation on Wednesdays to watch Survivor with a Bud Light.\n\nPerhaps more widely known across town, Jennifer will be remembered by hundreds of people for whom she made passport photographs at numerous Indianapolis Post Office Branches. She received an emergency call from the Indianapolis Colts during the Andrew Luck years to travel to the Colts Practice Complex to make passport photos before an overseas team event. She had a gift of making expectant travelers—and football players—comfortable in front of the camera.\n\nJennifer was preceded by her parents, George and Mary Berry and a brother George, Jr.\n\nShe is survived by her sons, Anthony ‘Tony’ and Alec Pipkin, both of Indianapolis, and four siblings all of Indianapolis: Edward Berry; Kathleen Berry Graham, (Donald Graham); Maureen ‘Mimi’ Berry Huck, (Rick Huck); Laura Berry. She cherished family gatherings where nieces Emily Graham Najem, Rachel Graham Templin, Nicholas Berry Graham, Edward Huck, Mary Shannon Huck, Gabriella DeMore, and three great-nephews celebrated anything from a Chicago Cubs W—or a loss—to a Kentucky Derby surprise longshot. She will be remembered by numerous relatives and friends.\n\nVisitation for Jennifer will be Monday, May 23, from 4:00 to 5:30 pm at St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated following visitation at 5:30. Please visit ORileyBranson.com to leave condolences.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to the Catholic Youth Organization or the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society."
