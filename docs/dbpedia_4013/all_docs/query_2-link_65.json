In her childhood she mostly spent all the time with her sister Jennifer, whereas she basically never interacted much with her older sisters. She felt unwanted from them and it was for her noticable that they tried to avoid her whenever they could. The situation between the sisters changed when they have all attended the flight school. Due to her skills that were equal to Amelia's, she finally was able to get to know her sister better. Solely her oldest sister Lily was still unknown to her and both were still avoiding each other. With the successful completed flight course she was now be able to work in her father's organisation. And so she joined together with her sisters, Lily and Amelia, the escort division, whereas Jennifer joined the transport division where she was stationed on board the Endeavor, together with her parents.\n\nThe Endeavor\n\nThe new life in the escort division was the best time she had. As all pilots in the escort division were dependant on each other, she was finally no longer ignored and avoided by Lily. The three sisters were a perfect team and with joint forces they were able to push any threat back. Together with the effort of each family member, the organistation flourished and was as successful as never before. However, the luck was damned to end sooner than expected. For some reasons her sister Lily didn't show up for the convoy exercises and often disappeared for days without having a reason to back her up. Her father warned her that she would lose the job, if it was happening again. After the warning, Lily stopped missing in the exercises, but nothing was going to be the same as before. Evie noticed that Lily has changed. Her overall attitude, especially towards her father has changed drastically.\n\nBetrayal\n\nOne day on a normal convoy mission where all sisters were supposed to take part in, something happened that would change everything. It started with an alleged mission assignment for Lily and Amelia, that made it impossible for both to be there in the convoy. So the convoy started without them with solely Evie as escort vessel and her parents as well as her sister Jennifer on board the Endeavor. She knew it was going to be risky without her sisters backing her up in case of an attack.\n\nAfter some time, just as the convoy was passing the Mojave lane in California, which has always been the place where the most pirate attacks took place, the convoy was suddenly disrupted by a group of pirates. However, instead of demanding a sum, they immediately started to shoot at the Endeavor. Evie knew that they weren't just pirates, they were Mercenaries, hired to attack the convoy. She tried to act as quickly as she could and opened fire on the ships, but she was of no use in this situation. These 'pirates' were too skilled for her and took down the Endeavor with ease. All she could see was the Endeavor in flames and an explosion quickly following. She was paralyzed and didn't realize that the mercenaries already had started to fire on her ship, which took out the engines and made it impossible for her to retreat. Instead of killing her, the Mercenaries boarded her ship and took her in. When they've boarded the ship, they have hit her on the head with a hard object which led to her losing the consciousness.\n\nShe woke up hours later and noticed herself tied down on a chair. She looked around and was obviously on board one of the ships of the Mercenaries. The room she was in looked like a bloody torture chamber. Minutes later she was awake, a man came towards her and punched her. He stopped and removed the ropes from her as another man said that she has to be unharmed and that she, with her short height, would be no threat to them. Just as he removed the ropes, she took the chance to reach her hidden knife in her boot and silently killed the man infront of her. The others didn't notice it and so she killed them one after the other until no one was left on the ship. In her blind rage she took control over the ship and opened fire at the other Mercenary ships that were escorting the main ship. They were destroyed in a few seconds as they didn't expect that to happen. With the current situation and the ship she gained from the Mercenaries, she set course away from Liberty. While she did that, she took the chance to search for hints on the dead bodies of the mercenaries and found a document with a mission assignment to attack the convoy and to capture Evie. The document was signed by someone with the callsign Viper. Evie knew only one by that callsign, and that was Lily.\n\nHer life in the Order\n\nKnowing that she had no where to go and that she was alone now she flew towards the Omicrons to start a new life there. Her own sisters betrayed the family and she had lost everything she loved, her sister Jennifer and her parents. She was severly depressed and hid herself on a Freeport in Omicron Delta. There, she met a man, who surprisingly managed to cheer her up. Later it turned out that he was a member of the Order and exactly that man offered her a place in the Order. He had a feeling that she would be a good addition and so Evie joined the Order to start a new life and forget about the past.\n\nDuring her career in the Order, she gained new skills and experience. With these gained attributes she managed to find out that her sister Jennifer survived the attack and serves nowadays in a Libertonian Corporation, Ageira Technologies. For the first time in a while, she was happy again. But that didn't last for long. She found the man who was the only reason for her to be in the Order dead in her own apartment. He was shot down and Evie immediately realized that she was no longer safe here.\n\nOn the run\n\nThe Mercenaries once again were about to get her. It appeared her sisters didn't give up and hired new Mercenaries to finish the job. She got in her Order ship and started to run towards Rheinland. However, the Mercenaries were already waiting for her outside and opened fire as soon as she was out of the Freeport. It was a hopeless fight for her, she was alone and highly outnumbered. But for the first time in her life she had a bit of luck and a few Corsair ships engaged the Mercenaries that gave Evie the opportunity to run, which she of course took.\n\nIn Rheinland she tried again to settle down but the Mercenaries were already after her. This time however, she managed to run before they could catch her. She set course to Kusari in the hope they wouldn't find her there. Without luck, though. They were already expecting her there and so the only place she could go to was Bretonia. She knew that if they were finding her in Bretonia, she would have to face her fate. She was more or less ready for it as she was sick of running. Luckily she found a pilot from the Bretonian Armed Forces. His name was Austin Goodman. Evie expected him to be one of the Mercenaries, considering that he wanted to help Amelia to catch her. He already caught her but he gave her the chance to explain the situation. Evie, without even knowing him, put all her trust and hope in him. She had a feeling that he would be the one that is going to save her from this hell.\n\nThe Endgame\n\nIn Progress"
