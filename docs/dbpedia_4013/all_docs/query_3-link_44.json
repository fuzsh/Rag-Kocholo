        "text": "3.2. Definition of lost to follow-up\n\nThe majority of survey respondents defined an ‘inactive’ PKU patient as a patient who had spent 2 years (55% [34/62] of respondents) out of clinic (1 year: 24% [15/62]; 3 years: 11% [7/62]). Patients were defined as ‘inactive’ because of the number of failed communication/contact attempts (78% [42/54] for 3–5 failed attempts), missed clinic appointments (77% [33/43] for ≥3 missed appointments), or missed laboratory tests/prescription refills (41% [16/39] for 3–5 missed tests/refills and 39% [15/39] for 6–10 missed tests/refills).\n\nTaking into account the survey results, personal experience, and publications, we defined lost to follow-up patients with PKU as “patients with no contact with the clinic for at least 2 consecutive years.” Note that for some clinics, if a patient has had no contact with the clinic for 3 years they are then considered ‘new’ patients if/when they return to clinic.\n\nThe findings reported here may also be relevant to additional cohorts of patients: minimally engaged patients, who do not attend clinic but do keep in touch with the clinic, and lost to care patients, who were treated when they were young but for whom contact information is no longer available. We believe that many of the lost to care patients may have been advised by their healthcare provider that lifelong management of PKU was not required. For example, in 1971 Blaskovics and Nelson [9] recommended that dietary restriction to prevent mental retardation was unnecessary beyond 6 years. Each of these cohorts has a different relationship with the clinic and may require modified approaches toward re-engagement.\n\n3.3. Best practice recommendations to engage lost to follow-up patients\n\nCombining the results from our survey and our discussion at the Expert Meeting, we have prepared six best practice recommendations to engage lost to follow-up patients with PKU ( ) that we believe will assist clinics in helping lost to follow-up patients return to clinic. We provide evidence supporting our recommendations.\n\n3.3.1. Ensure patients are aware of current treatment guidelines for PKU\n\nThe most important guideline recommendation for adult patients with PKU is that treatment should be lifelong. The current American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) practice guidelines [10] recommendations include the following points: “Treatment for PAH deficiency should be lifelong for patients with untreated Phe levels >360 μmol/L” and “Maintaining a treated Phe level of 120–360 μmol/L is recommended for all patients of all ages.” The guidelines note that there is strong evidence to suggest that lifelong management is essential to optimal functioning of patients with PKU. Importantly, the ACMG suggests that patients with PKU may not be aware that lifelong management is recommended, or that new advances in diet or pharmacologic treatment are available, and encourages clinics to engage LFTU patients.\n\nThe ACMG recommendations are reinforced by the recent European Guidelines for PKU [11], which state “Treatment for life is recommended for any patient with PKU” and “All adults with PKU should have lifelong, systematic follow-up in specialized metabolic centers due to specific risks which may occur during adulthood.”\n\n3.3.2. Communicate to patients any new treatment and diet options as they become available for PKU\n\nOur survey found that, in the opinion of the respondents, the greatest factor motivating lost to follow-up patients to return to clinic was the availability of a new pharmacologic treatment (mean rating on a scale of 1 to 9 = 8) ( ). Other factors considered highly motivating were new research on PKU, new types of formula or medical food, or new options for treatment. For example, one of our clinics sent out 50 letters to lost to follow-up patients with PKU informing them that a new treatment for PKU was available and that lifelong treatment is the current clinical recommendation, and this resulted in 10 patients returning to clinic. Another clinic sent out 12 letters to lost to follow-up patients with PKU letting them know that new treatments were available, and this resulted in 4 patients returning to clinic, as well as siblings to whom the information was passed. Patients may consider that the availability of new treatment/information is an incentive for them to return to clinic.\n\n3.3.3. Consider the neuropsychological and neurocognitive aspects of PKU\n\nThe ACMG guidelines recognize that when PKU treatment lapses, as for lost to follow-up patients, a variety of disabling neuropsychological and neurocognitive symptoms can develop, such as deficits in executive functioning, anxiety, depression, and phobias [10]. Indeed, our survey found that the greatest barrier to clinic attendance was “neuropsychological issues affecting cognitive ability” (mean rating on a scale of 1 to 9 = 7). Our survey also found that the “lack of understanding of the burden of disease” was a significant barrier (mean rating = 6.5). This finding is supported by a survey of Italian adult patients with PKU that found that 40% (44/111) of patients did not consider PKU a disease [12]. A combination of not understanding or recognizing the burden of illness and neuropsychological conditions may create a cycle that impedes clinic attendance and adherence to treatment.\n\nThe importance of the neuropsychological and neurocognitive aspects of PKU is recognized in the current ACMG practice guidelines [10], which include the following points: “The risk for neurocognitive or psychological symptoms in PAH deficiency is related to age of onset of therapy, lifelong Phe levels, and adherence to treatment” and “Appropriate intellectual and mental health assessments are an important component of care for individuals affected with PKU.” The guidelines note that patients may experience an improvement in neuropsychological and neurocognitive symptoms with the reinstitution of treatment.\n\nWe believe that the neuropsychological and neurocognitive aspects of PKU in adult patients are the principal reason why patients remain lost to follow-up. Not only do patients often deny that they have a disease, they also have little awareness of their symptoms. Patients may not be able to grasp the concept that their Phe levels may cause their symptoms, particularly because the symptoms are not physically obvious. In summary, patients with PKU may not understand the practical impact of poor Phe control on daily life [10]. Furthermore, given the limitations that patients may have for planning and organizing appointments, careful communication with lost to follow-up patients is important in ensuring they attend the clinic appointment. Therefore, helping patients understand their symptoms may be due to elevated Phe, and, despite the challenges involved, offering adult lost to follow-up patients with PKU psychological support may be incentives for them to return to clinic. Importantly, a specific tool for assessing the quality of life of patients with PKU and the effectiveness of treatment and psychotherapy is available [13].\n\n3.3.4. Prioritize motivated lost to follow-up patients\n\nOur survey found that the average wait time for a clinic appointment was up to 3 months, and did not differ between existing patients (29.9% [20/67] respondents note <1 month average wait time for a clinic appointment, 56.7% [38/67] 1–3 months), new patients (40.3% [27/67] <1 month, 47.8% [32/67] 1–3 months), and lost to follow-up patients returning to clinic (32.8% [22/67] <1 month, 52.2% [35/67] 1–3 months). Traditionally, engaged patients, newborns, and pregnant women receive priority care. However, lost to follow-up patients may not return to clinic if there is not immediacy in the response to their enquiry, as there may only be a small window of opportunity to help them re-engage with the clinic. We highly recommend that clinics prioritize appointments for motivated lost to follow-up patients who contact the clinic. We suggest that, even though these approaches may have administrative challenges, clinics consider opening appointments, holding regular group sessions, using telemedicine, and/or initiating home visits to capitalize on the opportunity to begin treatment as soon as possible.\n\n3.3.5. Explore new approaches of outreach to lost to follow-up patients\n\nOur survey found that 11.9% (8/67) of the clinics did not reach out to lost to follow-up patients, although we note that most clinics are limited in their resources. For those clinics who did attempt to contact patients, the communication was usually made by the dietitian (62.7% [42/67] of respondents) or the front office staff (32.8% [22/67]). The first communication attempt was usually by phone (50.7% [34/67] of respondents) and the second attempt by mail (34.3% [23/67]); final attempts at communication were made by reaching out to primary care physicians or family members.\n\nOur survey found that, in the opinion of the respondents, factors motivating lost to follow-up patients to return to clinic included access to telemedicine (mean rating on a scale of 1 to 9 = 7), educational events (mean rating = 7), satellite clinics (mean rating = 6), and adult clinic days/hours (mean rating = 6).\n\nWhile acknowledging that clinics are limited by funding, time, and staff, we believe there are numerous options available to clinics to engage lost to follow-up patients with PKU. In support of survey findings, our recommendations include:\n\nTailoring clinic visits to this population. For example, PKU-only clinic days/hours, adult-only clinic days/hours or metabolic centers (to overcome attending a pediatric clinic), and satellite clinics (to overcome transportation issues).\n\nTelemedicine. This may be used to overcome anxiety over clinic visits and transportation issues.\n\nHolding social events for adults. Encourage patients to attend activities, educational seminars, patient dinners, patient panels, or camps that are designed specifically for adults with PKU. Events may also target younger or older adults.\n\nCommunication using social media. The use of social media may be limited by the institution, but will target the correct generation and remove the embarrassment associated with personal communication. Clinics should also consider the use of texts and emails rather than phone calls (within workplace guidelines).\n\nCollaboration with local advocacy groups to connect with patients.\n\nCollaboration with companies. This relationship could be used to send out samples of pharmacologic treatments or medical foods/formula to patients, or highlight new clinical trials that patients may like to participate in.\n\nEstablishing a PKU registry. This would enable clinics to target communications specifically to patients with PKU.\n\nPreparing publications that target primary care physicians. Primary care physicians can be made aware of the symptoms of PKU and may refer patients to metabolic clinics.\n\nOf importance is how we communicate with lost to follow-up patients with PKU. We believe that all communications should be motivational because the type and tone of the communication can have a significant influence on the patient’s decision to return to clinic. Some ways to achieve this include focusing communications on:\n\n•\n\nrecommendations from ACMG guidelines\n\n•\n\nthe availability of new treatments\n\n•\n\nthe total wellness of the patient, i.e. is the patient healthy overall and capable\n\n•\n\nthe idea that low Phe levels can contribute to symptoms and comorbidities\n\n•\n\nthe quality of life benefits from having Phe levels under control\n\n•\n\nachievable goals that are personal and individual\n\n•\n\nplaces to seek further information, e.g. websites\n\nHowever, communications should NOT focus only on Phe levels as this detracts from a holistic approach to care.\n\n3.3.6. Formalize approaches to track and/or identify PKU patients\n\nAt present, there are no formal electronic programs available to track patients that can highlight those individuals who are lost to follow-up. Most current electronic medical record (EMR) systems do not have the capacity for queries or flagging of patients. To overcome this, clinics often go by memory or have monthly meetings to discuss patients who are lost to follow-up. Given that our survey found that some of the difficulties in engaging lost to follow-up patients included the ability to obtain contact information (mean rating on a scale of 1 to 9 = 7), the time needed to contact patients (mean rating = 6), and the accessibility of historical records (mean rating = 5), the development of a patient record system specifically for patients with PKU is warranted. Survey respondents also suggested that more technologically advanced ways of tracking clinic attendance (mean rating on a scale of 1 to 9 = 8), additional staff dedicated to tracking patients (mean rating = 7), and increased cooperation with patient support groups (mean rating = 6) would be useful options for tracking/identifying lost to follow-up patients with PKU.\n\nWe suggest that tracking options may also include Department of Health records, state newborn screening records, ICD-10 query of records, regular scheduled formal reviews of patient status with clinic staff, and working with local primary care physicians. However, the development of more appropriate and specific electronic programs is paramount."
