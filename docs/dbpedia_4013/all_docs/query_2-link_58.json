Miss America\n\n9-688-122 REV: MARCH 17, 2006 National Cranberry Cooperative (Abridged) On February 14, 1981, Hugo Schaeffer, vice president of operations at the National Cranberry Cooperative (NCC), called his assistant, Mel O’Brien, into his office and said: Mel, I spent all day yesterday reviewing last fall’s process fruit operations at receiving plant #1 [RP1] with Will Walliston, the superintendent, and talking with the co-op members [growers] in that area. It’s obvious to me that we haven’t solved\n\nBlackberry Picking- Seamus Heaney Seamus Heaney is an Irish poet who was born in Mossbawn farmhouse and spent fourteen years of his childhood there. Many of his poems are based on personal experience; ‘Mid-term Break’, for example, was based on the death of his younger brother; and are laid out in settings akin to those he is familiar to. His poem, ‘Blackberry Picking’, is set on a farm and explores the simple luxury of picking fresh, ripe blackberries, his inspiration quite possibly being his own\n\nHeaney uses the speaker in the poem to show one way of dealing with death is to accept it. The nostalgic views of the speaker in the poem shows the speakers' remembrance of picking the blackberries and even though the berries would rot too soon, the good memories of picking the berries would always outweigh the bad of them rotting. In “Blackberry-Picking”, Seamus Heaney utilizes colorfully yet contrasting imagery, diction and structure to suggest that death is inevitable and loss isn't always the easiest\n\nNational Cranberry is a cooperative of berry growers around North America that share common production facilities and for the last several years have been experiencing capacity bottlenecks among other issues. After initial analysis, two main factors that contributed to a decrease in production were found. The first issue in the business is that the supply trucks and drivers delivering the harvest were not properly organized and there was not enough space and organization to allow for smooth offloading\n\nDuring \"Blackberries\" we see the boy grow into a young man, going from his first haircut, to being alone, because of his parents' fight. At the beginning we see the boy get his first haircut.\"'Just an ordinary cut please Mr. Fresnham,' said the child's mother, 'and not too much off.

This was to foreshadow what will happen\n\nas, “clot,” “flesh,” and “blood,” to give the reader a negative connotation towards the taste and texture of the berries. Heaney compares the hands of the children to Bluebeard, a fairy tale character who killed all of his wives; he uses references to gore to exemplify the comparison between Bluebeard and the berries that stain the narrator’s hands. When the author describes the berries using “blood,” it can be seen as foreshadow towards the grim story of Bluebeard, as well as the words: “clot”\n\nstanza of the poem is mostly quite positive and enthusiastic. The first part of the stanza describes the the ripening of the berries, “given heavy rain and sun for a full week, the blackberries would ripen”. He also gives us an image of the berries. Heaney uses the metaphor “a glossy purple clot” for the ripe berries, and the similie “hard as a knot” for the unripe berries. When you say “hard as a knot”, the sound is quite short,\n\nbut when fall came around they picked umdoni berries to trade neighbors for food. One day Nandi went to the river to pick umdoni berries so she could trade and eat. When she got there she couldn’t find any berries not even one. She then heard a loud hissing sound, and she saw snake. The snake was wound around the branches of the umdoni trees eating all the berries. Nandi cries out “You are stealing my berries….Oh, Snake, you are stealing all my berries. What will I have to exchange for meat if you\n\nEastern Woodlands have a fascinating life and culture.
