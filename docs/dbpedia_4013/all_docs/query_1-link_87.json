In this episode of Behind The Song, they sit down with songwriter and former member of The Band, Robbie Robertson, and PFC producer Mark Johnson, to talk about \"The Weight.\" Get an inside look at how this Song Around The World came to be...\n\nPlaying For Change is a movement created to inspire and connect the world through music, born from the shared belief that music has the power to break down boundaries and overcome distances between people. Our primary focus is to record and film musicians performing in their natural environments and combine their talents and cultural power in innovative videos we call Songs Around the World. Creating these videos motivated us to form the Playing For Change Band—a tangible, traveling representation of our mission, featuring musicians met along our journey; and establish the Playing For Change Foundation—a separate 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to building music and art schools for children around the world. Through these efforts, we aim to create hope and inspiration for the future of our planet. #musicicons #musichistory #omegaliveproductions\n\n...
