        "text": "üöÄ CU Engineering Undergrads: Did you know you can engage in meaningful research to help launch your career, whether you choose industry or academia? Meet Joshua Elston, a senior at University of Colorado Boulder majoring in aerospace engineering. His passion for aerospace was ignited during a family trip to the Kennedy Space Center, leading him to pursue a field that challenges him academically and excites him about the future of space exploration. ü™ê ü¶¨ Joshua chose CU Boulder for its vibrant student atmosphere, highly regarded aerospace program and unique opportunities like the ability to research methods to improve astronaut autonomy in deep space missions. Josh's experience in SPUR (CU Engineering's Summer Program for Undergraduate Research) has not only deepened his knowledge but also opened a pathway toward graduate studies in bioastronautics. Joshua recently presented his research at the Human Research Program Investigators' Workshop (IWS) ‚Äî the primary venue for reporting progress and results of research related to safe, productive and efficient human spaceflight. This experience will help propel Joshua towards his future aspirations which include graduate school and, ultimately, contributing to NASA's efforts in bioastronautics. üßëüèΩüöÄ üî¨ Joshua's story highlights CU Boulder's commitment to providing students with extraordinary research opportunities that help shape future leaders whether they choose industry or academia.

NASA, a name synonymous with exploration, has embarked on a journey, not to the stars, but into the realm of open-mindedness and inclusivity. The 'Transform to Open Science' initiative is a testament to their commitment to creating a research culture that is open to all. Their new 101 course is the first step in this direction, providing an introduction to Open Science through definitions, tools, and resources spread across 5 modules. The essence of scientific research is the ability to question, explore, and share knowledge without barriers. By promoting an inclusive culture, we're not just making science more diverse, we're enabling a holistic growth of knowledge. The path to progress is a shared one, and it is initiatives like these that make it a reality. Let's champion inclusivity in every field. Because when we lift each other up, we all rise.

After completing online courses, students are invited to attend a prestigious residential summer academy at NASA Langley Research Center, where they engage in NASA-related research and satellite mission design while connecting directly with NASA scientists, engineers, and technologists, all in an environment deeply rooted in Earth's exploration and understanding. üè´ PLACES (Place-Based Learning to Advance Connections, Education, and Stewardship): We're also privileged to work with WestEd and their NASA-funded PLACES project, focused on engaging students in data-rich, place-based Earth science learning. The project uses a professional learning framework to help teachers cultivate students' sense of place and understanding of earth science concepts using NASA data and data tools. These partnerships exemplify our shared vision of preparing the next generation of earth scientists to use data, data tools, and scientific processes to understand and protect the sustainability of our planet. As we commemorate Earth Day, let's celebrate not only the beauty of our planet but also the remarkable efforts of NASA-funded projects like VESSS and PLACES that are shaping the leaders of tomorrow. #earthday #NASA\n\nPlease take a moment & check out the Harvard / MIT / Massachusetts Space Consortium ‚Äî ‚ÄúSpace Week‚Äù is coming up in April 2024! üååüòä ‚ÄúThe Space Consortium was founded in Fall 2017 when a concerted effort supported by the Harvard Provost Office brought together faculty members from Harvard and MIT to work towards a common goal: creating an academic space hub for multidisciplinary space research. Today, the consortium serves a network of over 1,700 affiliates (students, faculty, alumni and space enthusiasts) in the US, working on a wide range of topics‚Ä¶ During Boston Space Week, the Consortium promotes fruitful exchanges between an array of affiliated top experts, business and community leaders, faculty, researchers, educators, students, alumni, and space enthusiasts which allows the community to engage with critical discussions related to the multidisciplinary issues affecting the aerospace industry today. Past speakers have included Jeffrey Hoffman (Former NASA Astronaut and Deputy PI of the Mars MOXIE experiment), Professor Kim Kowal (Chandra X-ray Observatory), Astronaut Soyeon Yi, and Richard Dalbello (VP of Business Development and Government Affairs, Virgin Galactic).‚Äù To become an affiliate and/or participate in Space Week: contact@spaceconsortium.com #space #spaceweek #thespaceconsortium #harvard #mit #aerospace #conference #astronomy #astrophysics #spaceexploration #economy #sustainability #technology #boston #bostonspaceweek #spaceindustry #spacetechnology #education #astrobiology #multidisciplinary #research #festival #community #careerfair\n\nThis month, researchers from the University of Brighton are set to run zero-gravity flights to put ground-breaking experimental devices through their paces. The two teams, including six students from participating universities, have just 20 seconds at a time to run tasks in weightless conditions. During each flight, the plane is set to climb to an altitude of 7,500m before going into a 3,000m high roller coaster climb and fall, during which weightlessness is experienced for about 20 seconds. This will be repeated 30 times on each of the three planned parabolic flights later this week. One of the teams is part of the DEPLOY! project, a collaboration between the universities of Brighton, Pisa (Universit√† di Pisa) and Parma (Universit√† degli Studi di Parma) and funded by the UK Space Agency and the European Space Agency - ESA Academy Experiments Programme, which provides funding and support for university students to develop their research in the fields of space science and technology. The other research team taking part, Gell-P, also funded by the UK Space Agency, is pictured below. Read the full story üëá https://lnkd.in/eqJb2pr8"
