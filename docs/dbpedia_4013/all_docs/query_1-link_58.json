        "text": "PREFACE\n\nLike much of Charleston, I was at home preparing for bed when I saw my colleagues’ first tweets about a shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church. Just two months had passed since our newsroom at The Post and Courier fanned out to cover the shooting death of Walter Scott, an unarmed black motorist killed by a white police officer. When I saw that this latest violence occurred in an AME church, I called a minister in the denomination who had been a helpful source in the past. He was at a hotel near the church ministering to survivors and other church members. The man could barely speak.\n\nMother Emanuel’s rich civil rights history—its revered status as the South’s oldest AME church, spiritual home to Denmark Vesey and his doomed slave rebellion—framed my first story. It was a brief one, written on late deadline that night as the first victim’s name leaked out: Reverend Clementa Pinckney. A day later, I co-wrote the first detailed public account of what happened inside the fellowship hall, followed by dozens more stories over the coming months that allowed me to meet the survivors and many of the victims’ family members. Almost four years later, I feel like I know all nine who died through the memories of those who loved them most. I wish that I’d gotten to meet them all.\n\nI come from off, as the white locals here call it when they want you to know they belong to the storied soil of the place more than you ever will. In fact, I have lived in Charleston for two decades. My children attended school right across the street from Emanuel. I once was employed at the public library two doors down. For nearly all my time in Charleston, I have worked as a journalist at the city’s daily newspaper. Before June 17, 2015, I had written a lot about the city’s troubled racial legacy, but I had never experienced it as closely as I did while reporting on this tragedy.\n\nAs a white woman, I’ve since thought a lot about the difference between empathy and shared experience. While covering Dylann Roof’s trial, most of the black journalists sat together in the media courtroom’s jury box. Over coffee, one described for me the particular shared pain they felt covering this massacre. Hearing the killer’s racist rants and knowing he meant them for you and your family? I didn’t experience his words the way that reporter did. But I could report and contextualize the roles of race, guns, and Christian faith in a state built upon the triumvirate of their influence. This is what I have attempted to do in the pages to come. I hope they provide a comprehensive picture of Charleston and the people who will live this story forever.\n\nThe adult survivors of this tragedy and many members of the victims’ families took considerable time to sit with me and help to tell this story. I hope they feel that I have remained faithful to their experience and sensitive to their suffering. I also want to acknowledge my debt to the reporters, editors, photographers, designers, management, and countless others at The Post and Courier. This book could not have been written without their insistence on bearing witness to the shooting and its aftermath, events that forever changed our city and the nation.\n\nJennifer Berry Hawes\n\nPART I\n\nWe Have Stared Evil in the Eye\n\none\n\nSown Among Thorns\n\nIt would be a late night. That much Felicia Sanders knew when she gathered her worn Bible and headed out into the swampy summer heat of June. She had a 5 o’clock committee meeting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, where her family had worshipped since the days when Jim Crow ruled the old slave city she still called home. First, she would attend two meetings, one small and one large, to handle routine church business.\n\nLast would come Bible study, her favorite.\n\nShe slipped into her black Toyota 4Runner, where she kept an extra pair of flats in case she was called to usher at the last minute. A day rarely went by that didn’t bring Felicia to the place that many folks called Mother Emanuel, given its revered status as the South’s oldest AME church. Its members knew they could count on her to help with just about anything. Revivals. Mother’s Day programs. Fundraising. Sunday school. Felicia, a fifty-seven-year-old grandmother and hairstylist, had served as a trustee, a steward, the usher board president. She even volunteered as Emanuel’s chicken fryer, although she herself was a vegetarian.\n\nFelicia did it because she loved God, and she loved the congregation. Mother Emanuel was home.\n\nA handsome woman with soft hips and high cheekbones, she had grown up with her siblings in Charleston’s downtown projects, attending church with her strict grandmother after her own mother died young. Felicia’s husband, Tyrone, had also grown up among closely bound families in the working-class black neighborhoods near Emanuel. After years of hard work, however, they had been able to provide a suburban life for their own children, complete with a two-story house and the wide tree-draped front lawn that Felicia now drove past.\n\nAs she cruised along a winding road that led toward downtown Charleston, she wondered if her youngest child would make it to Emanuel that night. Tywanza also loved Bible study, but he was working a shift at Steak ’n Shake, one of his two jobs, and had warned her that he might run late. The thought meandered away as she crossed over a wide river, passed a marina adorned with gleaming white vessels, and merged onto downtown Charleston’s thin peninsula.\n\nPedestrians crowded its thin streets, many lined with majestic old churches and finely restored antebellum homes. A few traffic lights stopped Felicia along a tourist-choked stretch of Calhoun Street, named after the country’s seventh vice president and one of its most ardent defenders of slavery. A 115-foot monument to the man towered over a verdant city square that bordered the street Felicia, a black woman, now navigated. It was so much a part of the place that she scarcely noticed it anymore. One building beyond the statue, she eased into a lot outside of Mother Emanuel and strolled inside, as she had thousands of times before.\n\nAs Felicia made her way into the church of her ancestors, a young white man, lean of frame, with a mop of bowl-cut sandy brown hair, sat one hundred miles away pecking at a keyboard inside his father’s house at the heel of a dead-end road. The young man sometimes slept overnight on the couch, although that wasn’t his plan today. He was busy putting the finishing touches on his new website. Its subject: issues facing our race.\n\nA couple of years earlier, he’d Googled black on white crime, mostly out of passing curiosity, and stumbled onto a surprisingly robust realm of white supremacist websites. There he’d discovered claims of grave threats to his race—an epidemic of violence against whites, the overlooked inferiority of blacks, and a vast conspiracy to cover it all up. Writings on the sites he’d plumbed after that search had fomented what he now considered his life’s great epiphany: his racial awakening.\n\nThe young man’s keyboard clattered in time with the words he’d read and now adopted as his own. I wish with a passion that niggers were treated terribly throughout history by Whites, that every White person had an ancestor who owned slaves, that segregation was an evil an oppressive institution, and so on. Because if it was all it true, it would make it so much easier for me to accept our current situation.¹\n\nInstead, black people were slaughtering innocent whites, raping white women, and taking over the nation. Yet, nobody cared. The media ignored it. His friends didn’t get it. Even his own family didn’t see it. And the white people who did realize it—the skinheads, neo-Nazis, and KKK—just bitched about it online. Nobody was doing anything to change it.\n\nWell someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.\n\nHe apologized for not writing more. But he had to go.\n\nHis pale skin and rail-thin stature—though five-foot-nine, he barely topped 120 pounds—allowed him to move in a silence of unnoticeability. At 6:13 p.m., he slipped into his creaky old black Hyundai Elantra and steered it toward the city he’d visited a half-dozen times over the past six months, seeking his target. He’d selected a place that drew good people, the kind whose murders would garner notice and outrage.\n\nThe white stucco building, a Gothic revival style built back in 1891, stood grand as ever, though her paint crumbled in spots and termites chewed her frame. Gentrification and aging congregations hadn’t been kind to many of downtown Charleston’s black churches, including Felicia’s beloved Emanuel. The collection plate just didn’t go as far as it once did, given that neither the building nor the members were getting any younger. The church held just one service on Sundays now, and most of the pews still sat empty.\n\nTwo sets of stairs led to its front entrance and the crimson-hued sanctuary inside, a sacred space both for its tradition of worship and its role in America’s civil rights history—the likes of Booker T. Washington and Martin Luther King Jr. had spoken here back when the congregation topped one thousand. Felicia didn’t ascend those steps, however.\n\nIt was Wednesday, not Sunday, so she headed to the left side of the building, which bordered a neighboring church. This side of Emanuel had a narrow parking lot and two sets of doors that led inside to the fellowship hall, an open space that stretched across most of its ground floor. For the Bible study’s regulars, this hall had been the site of hours upon hours spent studying the sacred text more closely than Sunday worship allowed. A core group of a half-dozen or so of Emanuel’s most devoted members, including Felicia, showed up for the study every Wednesday evening.\n\nFelicia entered one of the side doors, left unlocked for members and visitors alike. She associated the room with these intimate sessions but also with church meetings and special celebrations, like her Aunt Susie’s big seventieth birthday. With its caramel-colored wood paneling, cushioned couches, and bulletin boards, it felt like a cross between a grandmother’s living room and an elementary school classroom. The rectangular space was oriented around a small, slightly raised altar on one wall. Three ornate wooden chairs, cushioned in red velvet, sat perched on it near a hefty Bible on a lectern. The pastor’s office door sat just a few feet to the altar’s right. To its left, a short hallway led to the secretary’s office and a second set of doors to the outside, the ones almost at the back of the church.\n\nOn both ends of the room, snug staircases allowed access to Emanuel’s second-floor sanctuary, which slumbered above. The design necessitated the need for an elevator to serve its older members. Plans for that elevator brought Felicia to Emanuel now, early, before much of the congregation would arrive for their large quarterly conference meeting shortly after. Rows of empty folding chairs awaited larger audiences like that meeting would draw. On the other side of the room, away from the doors, four round foldable white tables stretched in a row. These hosted more intimate conversations, like Bible study.\n\nThe elevator committee members now gathered at one of them to check their progress after years of fundraising, planning, and building. Construction was almost done, a reason to celebrate. Felicia had a special place in her heart for the church’s elderly congregants, including her beloved Aunt Susie, who had just arrived, walking with a cane.\n\nIconography intrigued the young man. His companions on the one-hundred-mile drive to Charleston included his new .45-caliber Glock and eight magazines with eleven hollow-point bullets in each. It made for a total of eighty-eight rounds. The number was a symbol for HH, based on the alphabet’s eighth letter, a neo-Nazi favorite: Heil Hitler.\n\nHis fifteen-year-old Hyundai also bore a Confederate States of America license plate with three different Confederate flags, although its presence on the car wouldn’t draw any particular attention. In much of the old Confederacy, battle flags still flew on porches and embellished pickup trucks, a symbol of white southern pride and a snub to elitist Yankees who flocked south for the strong economy and pleasant climate while deriding its heritage.\n\nWithout stopping, he cruised toward South Carolina’s most historic city, where the first shots of the Civil War were fired in the first state to secede from the union. Charleston had once been home to the nation’s highest ratio of enslaved black people to whites. An estimated 40 percent of America’s slaves came through its harbor. That’s why he’d picked it. Six times over the past six months, he had visited the city—and Emanuel—while devising his plans. Once he had chosen his target, he’d struck up a conversation with one of its congregants, who had provided a useful detail: The church had Bible study on Wednesday nights.\n\nIt was perfect. Bible study would draw a smaller crowd than Sunday worship. It surely wouldn’t have any security. And a black church wouldn’t draw any white people. He didn’t want any of them to get hurt accidentally.\n\nThe young man drove down the same interstate that the church’s senior pastor, Clementa Pinckney, had sped down just a couple of hours earlier. The traffic-choked road connected Charleston to Columbia, the state’s capital, where Clementa lived not far from the young man, although they’d never met.\n\nClementa had just spent a hectic day embroiled in his other job, that of state senator. It was budget preparation season, an annual exercise in frustration given he was a black Democrat in a state where white Republicans maintained an easy grip on power. Over the two-hour drive to Emanuel, his cell phone rang incessantly. His immediate boss, the presiding elder, and about sixty members would arrive soon for the church’s quarterly conference, and the evening’s agenda wasn’t quite ready yet.\n\nHis wife, Jennifer, and his six-year-old daughter had joined him for some family time given that he had been so busy lately. Little Malana begged him to stop for ice cream at McDonald’s, but there wasn’t time. He promised to take her on the way home.\n\nAs soon as they arrived at Emanuel, his secretary, Althea Latham, rushed to help him print off and copy the agenda. Their relatively new presiding elder, the Reverend Dr. Norvel Goff, would be there soon. When Althea finished, Clementa walked over and set his hand on her left shoulder. He thanked her.\n\nYou know you’re gonna owe me, she teased.\n\nWhen’s your birthday? he asked.\n\nForget it, she answered dryly. My birthday is in December when everybody is thinking about Christmas.\n\nYou’re going to have Christmas in July then!\n\nAlthea tried not to smile. I’m gonna hold you to it.\n\nClementa, she thought, looked unusually nice, even for him. Hair freshly cut, black suit fine, new shoes shining. When it was time for the quarterly conference to begin, she watched him persuade Malana to stay in his office with Jennifer. The winsome girl—Grasshopper, as he called her—clung to the smooth fabric of his pant leg until he gave her a parting hug and disappeared into the fellowship hall.\n\nPresiding Elder Goff stepped in front of the group of almost sixty congregants. He and Clementa attended to church business, including the licensing of two new ministers, a first step in the long road to ordination. They also re-licensed a third, Myra Thompson. It promised to be a thrilling night for her.\n\nIn a few minutes, she would lead Bible study for the first time.\n\nThe young man reached Charleston at 7:48 p.m. and headed straight for the church. The parking lot, however, was full. Too full.\n\nSomething bigger than Bible study was going on.\n\nUnhurried, he waited.\n\nAfter the conference ended, Felicia watched most of those gathered stroll out into the waning sunset. The meeting had gone long, and the start of Bible study was now two hours behind schedule. Daniel Simmons Sr., a seventy-four-year-old retired minister who usually led the small group, wondered if they should postpone it. So did Reverend Pinckney, who faced an almost two-hour drive home.\n\nThey went back and forth. Stay. Cancel. Stay. Cancel.\n\nDePayne Middleton Doctor, one of two women newly licensed moments earlier, spoke up: Let’s just do thirty minutes of it.\n\nThe group agreed and headed toward four round tables, the first one just outside the pastor’s office door near the altar, then extending in a row down the length of the room. Five or six white plastic folding chairs waited around each.\n\nDePayne, already an ordained Baptist minister, normally led her four daughters into Bible study like ducklings behind her, each with a milkshake in hand. Now, she headed for the second table from the altar alone.\n\nWhere are your girls? Felicia asked.\n\nDePayne explained their busy schedules as Myra, a retired educator and head of the church’s trustee board, joined them. Myra wore a classic black dress suit, her shoulder-length black hair smooth and dappled with gray, a headband holding it in place. Her face flushed with anticipation. This was her first time leading the Bible study, and she’d overprepared.\n\nAs the group settled in, Reverend Pinckney stood at the side door saying good night to the departing members, mostly older women whose skirts blew in the summer breeze as they headed out. He’d decided to stay.\n\nReverend Goff decided to go. He got into his black Cadillac, parked in the space closest to the side door where Clementa Pinckney bid people good night, and pulled out.\n\nCynthia Graham Hurd, a popular local librarian, had come to present a project about the church’s history to the quarterly conference. Now, as she prepared to head out, Felicia greeted her. They’d grown up at Emanuel together and often sat beside each other during Sunday services. Felicia invited her to stay.\n\nNo, I’m leaving, Cynthia demurred. She’d weathered an all-day managers’ meeting at the Main Library a few doors down, in addition to the quarterly conference. She was exhausted.\n\nBut I love you Felicia Sanders, Cynthia added.\n\nYou love me, you’ll stay to Bible study, Felicia teased back.\n\nWhat could Cynthia say to that? She headed for the second table to sit with Myra, DePayne, and Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, another licensed minister who was a close friend of hers. Retired pastor Dan Simmons joined them, and soon their Bibles covered the table.\n\nSusie Jackson shuffled toward the third table, pocketbook hanging from her cane. She was eighty-seven and wore a gap-toothed smile familiar to everyone at Emanuel. Hers was Emanuel’s largest family, and Susie its matriarch. Felicia and her eleven-year-old granddaughter joined her. Aunt Susie was one of Felicia’s closest friends and most dedicated prayer partners.\n\nEarlier, at 6:50 p.m., Felicia had received a text from her youngest child, Tywanza. You still at Bible study? he’d asked. Since it was starting late, the twenty-six-year-old had figured he could make it after all. When he arrived, Felicia’s granddaughter smiled big at her Uncle Wanza, a father figure, tall and hipster cool as he joined them at the third table.\n\nAlmost seventy years old, diabetic and hungry, Polly Sheppard had intended to skip this Bible study. A church trustee, she’d been in meetings all day. But she also had just run into Myra, one of her dearest friends, in the fellowship hall’s ladies’ room. Myra had begged her to stay. Now, Polly headed for the last of the four round tables, still tempted to duck out. If Myra looked away, she told herself, she still might, though it would be hard to get across the wide space to the doors without being spotted. Another old friend, Ethel Lance, the church’s sexton, sat near her.\n\nAcross the room, the door to Reverend Pinckney’s office stood open. He headed in that direction to check on his wife and daughter. Jennifer, an elementary librarian, had corralled Malana inside, on the other side of a thin wall from the fellowship hall, thankful that the normally energetic child was quietly eating some snacks and watching cartoons.\n\nAs Clementa turned to head back out for Bible study, she stopped him. Hold up, mister. I need your credit card. She needed to pay for their older daughter’s dance class.\n\nHere you go, darlin’.\n\nClementa hugged and kissed Malana, then stepped through his office doorway and into the fellowship hall, where he sat alone at the first table. An empty chair sat beside him.\n\nThe young man waited until 8:16 p.m. By then, all but a dozen cars had left the church’s parking lot behind the building. He pulled through an open gate in back and headed toward a narrow strip with a few parking spaces along one side. He wasn’t certain which entrance to use; he’d never been inside. The front doors were way too conspicuous, elevated on the second floor and highly visible to cars and pedestrians on busy, four-lane Calhoun Street. The church had no back entrance, so he steered toward a set of double doors on one side of the building. They sat near the church’s back corner, away from the street.\n\nThe parking space closest to them, where elder Goff’s Cadillac had been, remained empty.\n\nHe eased into it and stepped out slowly. Despite thick humidity and temperatures that reached well into the nineties, he wore a long-sleeved gray shirt, dark pants, and Timberland-style boots, along with a black pouch that hung heavy on his waist.\n\nIt took him just ten steps to reach the tall wooden side doors, where he tugged first at the one on the right. It wouldn’t budge, so he tried the left. It opened inward with an industrial clank. The church left it unlocked to welcome all who came seeking God’s word. A narrow, wood-paneled hallway inside was made even more cramped by stacks of workbooks, a potted plant, and a console table. Along it, he passed an empty office on his left.\n\nThe brief hallway ended at a lobby with a red exit sign and an open doorway into a large room beyond it. Voices drew him forward. He flitted toward them, past a poster of the Ten Commandments, and stepped through the doorway.\n\ntwo\n\nThe Visitor\n\nThey’d barely opened their Bibles when the young white man entered the fellowship hall from the lobby.\n\nPastor, we have a visitor! Sharonda announced.\n\nIt wasn’t unusual for strangers to venture inside, even white ones. Emanuel was a well-known church in the heart of a city that swelled with tourists during the summer months. The ever-growing College of Charleston’s campus also sat just a couple of blocks away, sending forth thousands of mostly white young adults on foot and bicycles, including those who occasionally stopped in to pray or learn more about the church’s important civil rights history.\n\nReverend Pinckney unfolded his tall form from his chair and strolled across the room to welcome their guest.\n\nAre you here for Bible study? he asked, towering over the slight man before him, his baritone bridging the space between them.\n\nThe visitor nodded.\n\nReverend Pinckney handed the young man a Bible and a copy of Myra’s study guide. Then, he pulled out a chair beside him and beckoned for the man to sit. There they settled in, just the two of them at the round table closest to the altar and pastor’s office. The visitor stared silently at the table.\n\nPolly Sheppard maneuvered her eyes toward their guest at the other end of the row of tables, trying not to be obvious. He looked like a college student, if an unusually docile and quiet one, with his boyish bowl haircut. The one thing that struck her was his eyes. They looked vacant and dull. Maybe he was just shy, she thought. Or hurting. Or on drugs.\n\nIn any event, if he’d come to Emanuel in search of God, they would guide him.\n\nOutside, the summer sunset darkened, yielding to fluorescent lights hanging from the fellowship hall’s low ceilings. Myra propped up her iPad to read the notes she’d prepared for several weeks. She had read tonight’s text over and over, analyzing each verse until the minutes before she’d left home that afternoon.\n\nDan Simmons, a retired pastor, sat across from her. A tall and imposing former Army man with a deep knowledge of the Bible, he commanded respect from everyone he met. He’d been around the district for decades, and he’d run more than once for bishop. Myra knew that he did not brook laziness or ignorance and wanted to impress him. She knew too that he also lived for a good debate. She was ready.\n\nThey opened their Bibles to a passage in Mark 4 known as the Parable of the Sower, a story Jesus shared with his disciples about seeds cast onto ground ill-prepared to nourish them.\n\nBehold, there went out a sower to sow:\n\nAnd it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the wayside, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.\n\nAnd some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:\n\nBut when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.\n\nAnd some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.\n\nAnd other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.\n\nThe room became stuffy and they quickly exceeded the half hour they’d planned. Myra’s enthusiasm carried them along. She described a world of sin in which hatred and worldly desires had hardened hearts, leaving too many people unable to nourish the seeds of God’s grace within themselves. As Christians, they needed to provide that fertile ground.\n\nMyra saw herself in the story. Once a single teenage mother, she had heeded God’s call to become a teacher and guidance counselor for at-risk children and, now, to prepare for the ordained ministry.\n\nJesus told his disciples that even people capable of hearing didn’t always comprehend what they heard. Similarly, Myra explained, people didn’t always absorb or apply God’s lessons to their lives. Like seeds that fell onto rocky ground or were choked by the thorns of sin, they often missed out on the redemption that God offered.\n\nAt the next table, Felicia listened with pride. She had known Myra her entire life. Like her, Myra was always at the church, always getting stuff done. She called Myra the bugaboo because she kept her nose in everything—and kept everyone else on task.\n\nReverend Simmons listened too, leaning back in his chair and grinning, arms spread widely as he jumped into the conversation. Felicia’s son Tywanza opened the Snapchat app on his cell phone and recorded a few seconds of video, panning from the far right, where the visitor sat quietly hunched over a table, then stopping on Reverend Simmons—old Dapper Dan—wearing a button-down shirt and a wide smile. An imposing man, he’d once carried a bullhorn around his old church, blasting his commanding voice to chase criminals away. He also usually carried a gun and was trained to use it. At that moment, it sat beneath a towel on the front passenger seat of his Mercedes parked outside.\n\nAs Tywanza recorded his antics, Felicia shook her head. Tywanza had been nudging her to get onto social media, too, but she’d put him off. That was his world. A couple thousand people followed his life on his freshwanza Instagram page, where he posted inspirational memes and photos that showed off his stylish clothes and a smile so big it almost couldn’t fit on his face. As Dapper Dan spoke, Tywanza typed across his Snapchat Bible study knowledge planter and then sent it.\n\nMyra continued to plumb the passage for meaning.\n\nIn like manner, the seed of God’s word, falling upon a heart rendered callous by the custom of sinning, is straightway snatched away by ‘the evil one,’ her notes read.\n\nThe visitor sat quietly as the study continued for almost an hour. At 9 o’clock, the group began a closing prayer.\n\nThey bowed their heads and closed their eyes.\n\nThe visitor did not close his eyes.\n\nHe’d later say that he had wavered. They seemed so nice. But his mission was too important, the moment too pivotal for the salvation of his race.\n\nHe reached a slender hand into his pack.\n\nThe cold grip of his Glock was scored, with indents that his fingers now grasped.
