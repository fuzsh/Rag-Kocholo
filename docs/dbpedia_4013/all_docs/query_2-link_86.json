        "text": "Halle Berry (born August 14, 1966, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.) is an American film actress, the first African American to win the Academy Award for best actress. She received the honour for her nuanced portrayal of Leticia Musgrove, a down-on-her-luck character in Monster’s Ball (2001).\n\nBerry was a teenage finalist in national beauty pageants, worked in modeling, and began acting on television in 1989. Film roles in Jungle Fever (1991), directed by Spike Lee, and in Boomerang (1992), starring Eddie Murphy, first brought her notice. She starred with Jessica Lange in Losing Isaiah (1995), a drama about adoption, before earning acclaim for her portrayal of film star Dorothy Dandridge, the first African American to be nominated for a best-actress Oscar, in the television film Introducing Dorothy Dandridge (1999). That performance earned her Emmy and Golden Globe awards.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nBerry was cast in action roles in X-Men (2000) and its sequels (2003, 2006, 2014), Swordfish (2001), and Die Another Day (2002), an installment in the James Bond spy series. The thriller Gothika (2003) and the Batman spin-off Catwoman (2004) were the first theatrical films in which she received top billing. After starring in the television movie Their Eyes Were Watching God (2005), an adaptation of Zora Neale Hurston’s novel, Berry played opposite Bruce Willis in the crime film Perfect Stranger (2007). She then took lead roles in the character-oriented dramas Things We Lost in the Fire (2007), as a recent widow, and Frankie & Alice (2010), as a woman with dissociative identity disorder.\n\nIn 2011 Berry appeared in the ensemble romantic comedy New Year’s Eve, and the following year she starred as a diving instructor vexed by sharks in the thriller Dark Tide. In the elaborately structured epic Cloud Atlas (2012), she performed multiple roles, including those of a 1970s journalist and a male Asian doctor from 2144. Berry later starred in the thrillers The Call (2013) and Kidnap (2017), portraying an emergency call-centre operator attempting to thwart a serial killer and a mother whose son is abducted, respectively. She then appeared in the spy movie Kingsman: The Golden Circle and starred in Kings (both 2017), playing a foster parent living in Los Angeles during the riots of 1992. She later was cast in the action thriller John Wick: Chapter 3—Parabellum (2019)."
