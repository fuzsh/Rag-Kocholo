        "text": "Rashad Jennings, RB, Giants (seventh, fifth/late fourth): As of this writing, he's going at pick 61 in ESPN drafts, but that's gonna rise as he keeps playing well in the preseason. He will be a PPR monster (Eli is going to be mayor of Dump-Off City this year, you watch) and again, in the West Coast offense they wanna run (up-tempo, no huddle, quick slants) he's actually a great fit. He's also going to stay on the field for most of every series. I hear the arguments about how bad the Giants offensive line is going to be, but last year, behind the Raiders offensive line (fourth-worst in run blocking per Pro Football Focus), Jennings was awesome sauce. Starting in Week 9 -- the first week he got 15 or more carries -- Jennings was the 11th-best running back in fantasy in terms of points, 11th in terms of total yards and tied for ninth in touchdowns. Playing for the Raiders. Yeah, maybe Andre Williams vultures some scores, I get that, but when they get in close, they have no red zone target except for Rueben Randle (that's called foreshadowing, kids). Last five years, under Tom Coughlin, Giants running backs have the second-most touchdowns in the league. When they get close they run, and that's not changing this year with their personnel. Will be enough to go around.\n\nTorrey Smith, WR, Ravens (seventh, fifth): Two words: Andre Johnson. The lead wide receiver in Gary Kubiak's offense has always put up numbers, as play action is a huge part of what those offense do (Texans had the sixth-most play-action snaps in the NFL during the Kubiak era). He's the best deep guy they have. As I stated in \"100 Facts\", Smith set career highs in targets, receptions and yards on deep throws last season ... and yet had zero deep touchdowns. He had at least five deep touchdowns in both of his first two NFL seasons. As I also stated in \"100 Facts,\" this is the third straight year I have pumped Smith. I might have a problem.\n\nCordarrelle Patterson, WR, Vikings (seventh, fifth): In Norv I trust. In last year's \"Love/Hate,\" I had Josh Gordon as a love, suggesting you reach at least three rounds earlier to get him. You're welcome, America. (Of course, I also had Dwayne Bowe. Sorry 'bout that). Anyway, here was one of the stats I used to pump up Gordon: \"Over the past five years, only the Colts attempted more passes of at least 15 yards downfield than Norv Turner's Chargers, and Turner is now the Browns' offensive coordinator.\" A year later, Norv is now in Minnesota, but while his home address has changed, his penchant for throwing deep hasn't. Patterson looks like a video game out there. This is the last year you'll be able to get him outside the first two rounds. Did I recently legally change one of my daughters' name to Cordarrelle? Maybe.\n\nSteven Jackson, RB, Falcons (eighth, seventh): Fantasy. Kryptonite. (Copyright Bill Simmons). I can't resist him. Sigh. And he's already banged up. If you draft him, you need to make sure you get Devonta Freeman or Antone Smith, whoever wins the backup job. (I'm betting on Freeman). That said -- six touchdowns in his final six games last year on a terrible team going nowhere. Rebuilt offensive line, healthy Julio and Roddy to keep the safeties from cheating up, he won't cost very much and he's got a shot to be a very productive flex back with RB2 upside some weeks. OBPTNWLBWHYWYL.\n\nShane Vereen, RB, Patriots (eighth, fifth): We know it's always dangerous to count on a New England running back, but I like Vereen because of his role in the passing game. That's not gonna change. His 69 targets last year were fifth-most on the team -- and he played in only eight games! One more game than Gronk, three more targets. Over 16 games, that's a 126-target pace. And at his career catch rate of 70 percent, that's 89 receptions. Small sample caveats and all that, but in the three games he played with Gronk in the lineup, he averaged nine targets. They didn't go away when Gronk was healthy. That's right. When I hang out with my buddies, I talk about things like Shane Vereen's career catch percentage. Just like Jennifer Lawrence does, I'm sure.\n\nJoique Bell, RB, Lions (eighth, late fourth/fifth): The Lions running back I want this year (you'll never guess who is in \"hate\") and I don't think it's all that close. Wanna win a bar bet? Here's a good one. Over the last two years, Reggie Bush has 89 receptions. And Joique Bell has 105. Yeah. Last two years, Bush has 10 rushes inside an opponent's 10-yard line and two touchdowns from that distance. Bell has 12 rushes and seven touchdowns. He's a better fit for the new offense Joe Lombardi wants to run (basically, a version of the Saints offense with a lot more two tight end sets. Read more here from NFL Nation's Michael Rothstein). They say put your money where your mouth is, and the fact that the new regime in Detroit signed Bell to more guaranteed money than Bush this offseason speaks volumes.\n\nEmmanuel Sanders, WR, Broncos (ninth, sixth/seventh): There's 136 Peyton Manning targets up for grabs in Denver. Just because it's obvious doesn't mean it's not true.\n\nGreg Olsen, TE, Panthers (ninth, seventh/eighth): Sometimes, you don't have to be the prettiest girl in the bar, you just have to be the only girl in the bar.\n\nPierre Thomas, RB, Saints (10th, seventh): Last year, Thomas caught the quietest 77 balls this side of Kendall Wright. Meanwhile, Darren Sproles and his 89 targets are in Philly. Yes, some of those looks will go to Brandin Cooks, but not all of them. Ignore the talk of Thomas being third on the depth chart. Or better yet, encourage it, because it'll only help drive his price down further. He's the best passing-down running back on a team that throws. (Career receptions for Khiry Robinson and Mark Ingram combined: 24 in 47 games). He's gonna have the ball in his hands a lot.\n\nKendall Wright, WR, Titans (10th, seventh): Speaking of the Quiet Man ... dude had 94 receptions last year. Only two touchdowns. There were only nine wideouts who caught 90 or more balls last year. Eight of them had at least five touchdowns with the average being nine touchdowns. The average. I'm not predicting that for Wright, but I am a believer in Ken Whisenhunt's ability to get the most out of his talent, the most recent example being last year's San Diego Chargers. They are going to move Wright around a lot, and while I am on board with the Justin Hunter sleeper talk (more foreshadowing!), make no mistake, Wright will be the focal point of this offense again. And with a more reasonable touchdown total (based on volume of targets), he's a top-25 wide receiver who won't cost nearly that much.\n\nTerrance Williams, WR, Cowboys (10th, seventh): Josh Gordon. Calvin Johnson. Torrey Smith. Riley Cooper. Sorry, just listing the only wide receivers in the NFL last year that caught at least 40 balls and averaged more than Terrance Williams' 16.7 yards per catch. When I spoke to Jason Garrett at the combine, his eyes lit up only when I asked about one player. Wanna guess who? Under Scott Linehan last year, the Lions threw the ball 634 times. With the Cowboys defense, I'll take the over this year and they can't all go to Dez. Williams is the real deal.\n\nFred Jackson, RB, Bills (10th, eighth): Gonna get the ball on the goal line and be a legit part of time-share with C.J. Spiller. People forget he was actually a top-10 fantasy running back last year after I put him as a later-round Love, making him a repeat OBPTNWLBWHYWYL .\n\nJay Cutler, QB, Bears (11th, eighth): If you decide to wait on quarterback, Cutler is a great one to grab toward the end of the starting QB run. Second year in the Trestman system, the talent that surrounds Cutler is as good as any team in the league. If you wanna play fast and loose with numbers, combining Cutler and McCown fantasy points last year would give you the third-highest scoring quarterback by ESPN scoring. Cutler is still injury-prone and he's not mistake-free either, but he doesn't need to be a top-three QB at this price.\n\nTom Brady and Matt Ryan, QB, Patriots and Falcons: Brady is going as QB No. 10 in ESPN drafts and Matt Ryan is being drafted as QB No. 12. That's nuts. See \"100 Facts\" for my thoughts and stats on both Brady and Ryan and why they are both due for big bounce-back seasons.\n\nRiley Cooper, WR, Eagles (11th, ninth): I don't know, do you think Jeremy \"20 games missed the past three years\" Maclin stays healthy? Starting in Week 9, when Nick Foles took over full-time, Cooper had 27 receptions on 47 targets, 521 yards and six scores. Now, three of them came in that crazy Oakland game, but still. That's a full-season pace of almost 1,000 yards, 50 receptions on 80 targets and 10 touchdowns. Those numbers would have been good for the 14th-best wide receiver in fantasy last year. I expect some regression in the touchdown pace, but so what? He's being drafted outside the top 40 at wide receiver. I'm gonna repeat that because it's a helpful trick in writing to emphasize something. Outside the top 40. You're telling me he can't get to top 30? Top 25? Wherever he lands, it's gonna be at a profit.\n\nKyle Rudolph, TE, Vikings (11th, 10th): He's Norvelous.\n\nLamar Miller, RB, Dolphins (12th, sixth): (Ducks) I know. I know, OK, I know? (Ducks again). Look, if you'll just let me (ducks again. Starts deeking back and forth). Just if you can give me one second -- (gets hit on arm, wipes it off, keeps moving) OK, I hear you, just (just getting pelted at this point) ... Fine, quickly, it'll-be-a-better-offense-this-year-with-new-offensive-coordinator-Bill-Lazor-from-the-Eagles-using-Miller-in-the-McCoy-role-and-his-only-competition-is-Knowshon-Moreno-who-isn't-close-to-the-talent-of-Lamar-Miller-and-I-still-believe-in-his -- OK fine, fine fine. You win. I'm leaving now. Stop. I'm leaving. (Runs off stage).\n\nJordan Reed, TE, Washington (12th, seventh/eighth): Health is a concern, but with DeSean Jackson stretching the field and Pierre Garcon demanding attention, the middle of the field will be wide open for Reed. In today's episode of playing fast and loose with simple math, Jermaine Gresham and Tyler Eifert combined for 126 tight end targets in Jay Gruden's offense last season. If you combine those two into one player, only Jimmy Graham had more targets among tight ends. IF he can stay on the field, Reed is gonna have a big year.\n\nBrandin Cooks, WR, Saints (12th, seventh/eighth): As the hype continues to build, there's no way he remains a 12th-rounder. So just going on record as thinking he is worth a look in the seventh-to-eighth round on upside alone, but if it gets too crazy (or higher than that), there's no potential for profit. The talent is immense and the team/scheme is a great fit, so if you get a shot at him in this area, take it.\n\nShonn Greene, RB, Titans (14th, 11th/12th): Another OBPTNWLBWHYWYL, he's not very good, but he's going to be better than a 14th-rounder. Still has a chance to start and get decent playing time on a team that will run the ball.\n\nZach Ertz, TE, Eagles (14th, 12th): Excuse me. Pardon me. Can I just, yes, right there, if you could squeeze, right and if you over there will just move and I'll just duck here and ma'am, if you could bend slightly and hang onto the rail ... ah! Perfect. Yep. Plenty of room left on the bandwagon.\n\nThe other trendy 14th & 15th-rounders: I'd be cool with any of these guys in the 10th or 11th: Kelvin Benjamin (Wow. I'm usually not a big rookie wide receiver type); Christine Michael and Carlos Hyde should be two of the first \"true handcuff\" guys off the board; I'm on the Justin Hunter bandwagon; I do think Jeremy Hill is going to be better than a lot of people think (again, due to the Hue Jackson tendencies); Andre Williams actually needs to be drafted in the eighth or ninth round, not the 16th where he's going here. And it's not if, but when will Ladarius Green be a stud fantasy tight end? I say second half of this year.\n\nOther receiving votes:\n\nThese are players going outside the top 14 rounds. I advocate going defense and kicker in rounds 15 and 16 (the last two rounds) of an ESPN standard draft, so for my draft strategy, consider anyone being drafted outside the first 14 rounds as being \"undrafted.\"\n\nThat said -- some people are in deeper leagues, or draft the Seattle defense earlier or got distracted by their 9-year-old because he just taught your 2½-year-old twin daughters how to open the magic marker box and they are currently going to town on your walls, so you ran out of time and got put on auto pick and somehow wound up with a defense or kicker you didn't want. Just to pull a completely random example out of thin air.\n\nSo for all of you, here's some players I think should or could be drafted depending on team need or personal preference. I don't advocate more than one QB but maybe you want two. Or need another tight end. Or want more upside running backs and/or wide receivers. I've grouped them by position in no real particular order (read my rankings for where I would slot them).\n\nCarson Palmer, QB, Cardinals: Over the final seven games last year, only Peyton Manning had more passing yards, only Peyton and Aaron Rodgers averaged more passing yards per game, and only six quarterbacks had more touchdowns.\n\nGeno Smith, QB, Jets: I know. But while there were some brutal moments last year, he also had five 20-point games. More than Tony Romo, Andrew Luck, same number as Russell Wilson and Cam Newton. Second year in the league, much improved supporting cast.\n\nJake Locker, QB, Titans: Before you laugh, Philip Rivers was left for dead too before Ken Whisenhunt showed up.\n\nTerrance West, RB, Browns: Yeah, because Ben Tate is an iron man.\n\nJames White, RB, Patriots: Vereen has had health issues, Steven Ridley can't hold onto the ball and we know Bill Belichick has no issue throwing whoever he wants in there.\n\nCharles Sims, RB, Buccaneers: Feel strongly about this one. Really talented back who is going to get more work than people think. Martin will get 65 percent or so of the RB touches, but Sims is gonna contribute sooner than later. Very good player; think Matt Forte. [Editor's Note: Sims had ankle surgery in mid-August and is now expected to miss most or all of the 2014 season.]\n\nLance Dunbar, RB, Cowboys: Very good pass-catching running back on a team that is going to throw a ton. Not a pure handcuff to Murray (he'd split with Josepth Randle) but certainly, being a backup to an injury-prone running back isn't the worst thing for your fantasy value.\n\nDevonta Freeman, RB, Falcons: See Jackson, Steven.\n\nDonald Brown, RB, Chargers: The Chargers will be more of a three-headed monster than folks realize, and between the history of injury and/or fumbling we've seen from Ryan Mathews in the past, \"Dammit Donald\" could easily have a larger role.\n\nAhmad Bradshaw, RB, Colts: One of the toughest players in the NFL, while Trent Richardson is no sure thing. Not even close.\n\nChris Polk, RB, Eagles: Polk, not Darren Sproles, is the McCoy handcuff you want. Would be top 10 if anything happened to McCoy.\n\nKnile Davis, RB, Chiefs: Speaking of guys who would be top 10 if something happened to the guy in front of them ...\n\nBryce Brown, RB, Bills: Talented player who is probably the Bills' starting running back next year. If not sometime this season, given the injury history of both C.J. Spiller and Fred Jackson.\n\nTheo Riddick, RB, Lions: I am really not a Reggie Bush fan this year. And I think some Lions coaches agree with me.\n\nAndrew Hawkins, WR, Browns: Assuming Josh Gordon is suspended for a length of time, they're still gonna throw to someone. I say it's Hawkins.\n\nMarkus Wheaton, WR, Steelers: Lost rookie year, but loads of talent and one of the reasons the Steelers let Emmanuel Sanders walk.\n\nHarry Douglas, WR, Falcons: With Tony Gonzalez gone, Atlanta will go three-wide a lot more this year.\n\nMike Williams, WR, Bills: Potential fantasy zombie -- nice red-zone target for EJ Manuel.\n\nGreg Jennings, WR, Vikings: If Matt Cassell wins the job, then I like Jennings. His full-season pace in games played with Cassell was 88 receptions, 1,018 yards and eight touchdowns. Those numbers would have been two points better than Larry Fitzgerald last year.\n\nReuben Randle, WR, Giants: The only real red-zone threat they have in the passing game.\n\nDexter McCluster, WR, Titans: Listed as a WR in our game, McCluster will be used in the Danny Woodhead role in Ken Whisenhunt's offense. Sneaky PPR play in deeper leagues.\n\nPlayers I Hate for 2014\n\nMarshawn Lynch, RB, Seahawks (going in first, I have as a second-rounder): Not to get all technical on you, but Marshawn Lynch gives me something those in the medical profession call \"the heebie jeebies.\" There's certainly nothing to point to in terms of his production last year. He was a stud like he always is. For me, it's a combo of things. The workload is the obvious one. Since coming to Seattle in 2010, including playoff games, no player in the NFL has carried the ball more. Three straight years of at least 250 rushes and as I noted in \"100 Facts,\" history has not been kind to running backs who come into a year with three straight seasons of at least 250 carries. For example, last year that list was Arian Foster, Chris Johnson, Ray Rice and Steven Jackson. How'd they work out for you? The Skittles thing is cute and all but seriously, shouldn't a NFL running back who wants to get paid eat a lot healthier? You hear all these off-the-field issues, he had the brief hold-out, showed up out of shape, they have really good (I mean really good) backups behind him. I always say I'd rather jump off the bandwagon a year too early than a year too late. Lynch will probably be great again this year. But since it costs me a first-round pick to enjoy it, it won't be on my team.\n\nDoug Martin, RB, Buccaneers (top-14 pick, third round): Here's the quote new Buccaneers offensive coordinator Jeff Tedford gave the Tampa Bay Times this summer. \"I think you have to alternate,\" Tedford said. \"Even when we had two 1,000-yard rushers (at California), J.J. Arrington was a 2,000-yard rusher and we had a couple times guys had a thousand yards apiece. But I don't believe that one back can carry the load. It's just too physical. I think you probably need to have two to three guys to bring different things to the table.\" J.J. Arrington, Marshawn Lynch, Justin Forsett, Jahvid Best, Shane Vereen ... Jeff Tedford certainly had success with running backs in college. Key words is backs. Plural. Lead back on Tedford's college teams got about 60 percent of the touches and I think that's what Martin gets. Now, running backs can have a lot of fantasy value on 60 percent of the carries, but will Martin? Not to the tune of being a top-14 player he won't, which is where he's going.\n\nReggie Bush, RB, Lions (third, sixth): See Bell, Joique. Will have a much different role this year in Joe Lombardi's offense. He's gonna be in the Darren Sproles role, which means he's still a fine pick for PPR (though, again, not as good as Bell). But taking him in the third in a standard non-PPR league is officially \"whoa crazy crazy.\"\n\nBen Tate, RB, Browns (fourth, sixth): I get the argument. A perfect fit for Kyle Shanahan's zone-blocking scheme (same thing he ran in Houston, basically) this is a team that will need to run and if Johnny Manziel is the quarterback, even better, as mobile QBs have traditionally helped create room for their running backs. But Tate has missed eight games the past three years (not to mention the entire first season he was drafted) and if you add in the games he was less than 100 percent and on the injury report that number goes up, if my math is correct, to three billion. I keep hearing Terrance West's name too much for my liking, especially when Tate is going ahead of guys such as Andre Ellington and Rashad Jennings. If you're gonna roll the dice on a talented but injury-prone player in this round, why wouldn't it be C.J. Spiller (currently going four picks later), who we have seen as a top-10 back in this league? Too rich for my blood.\n\nDeSean Jackson, WR, Washington (fifth, sixth): Great player I am thrilled to have on my favorite NFL team, but if we are talking fantasy, people expecting a repeat of last year will be disappointed. He scored nine touchdowns on 82 receptions. Prior to last year, he'd never had more than 62 receptions in a season and here are his career touchdown totals, starting in 2008: 2, 9, 6, 4, 2, 9. He's not a huge touchdown guy traditionally, there are better red-zone options than him in Washington and, as much as I love RGIII, deep-ball accuracy is something he struggled with last year. Taking Jackson at WR 14, ahead of guys such as Pierre Garcon, Victor Cruz, Roddy White and Keenan Allen, among others, is putting too much faith in last year's numbers.\n\nRyan Mathews, RB, Chargers (fifth, sixth/seventh): Been saying this on the podcast for a while., San Diego will be a three-headed monster at running back this year and Ryan Mathews is no sure thing to lead it. They signed Donald Brown to real money; he's not gonna just be hanging out, waiting until Mathews gets injured (still a real possibility, last year notwithstanding). I love this stat from \"100 Facts\": Last year, Mathews and Danny Woodhead converted just 13-of-71 opportunities in the red zone (18 percent). Meanwhile, Donald Brown was the only running back in the league to have at least 15 red-zone opportunities and converting at least one third of them for touchdowns. He was 6-for-18 (33 percent). Trust me when I tell you the San Diego coaches are well aware of this. Given what it'll cost to acquire each guy this year, I'd much rather have Brown (ADP of 135) than Mathews (ADP of 47).\n\nSeattle D/ST (sixth round, 11th): I'm OK with reaching for Seattle's defense. Feel they are that good. Reaching in the 11th round, not the sixth! They're great but they were less than a point a game better than Carolina and only one point a game better than Kansas City, neither of whom were drafted last year. I always wait until the second-to-last round to pick my defense for a lot of reasons, this fact being one of them: Over the past four years, only five of the teams drafted as a top-10 defense finished the year as a top-10 defense. Drafting a defense in the sixth is nuts.\n\nTrent Richardson, RB, Colts (sixth, late seventh/eighth): My friend Ron Shandler is one of the best fantasy baseball minds ever and a seminal figure in the fantasy sports industry. He is known for many theories in fantasy baseball, one of them being \"draft skills, not roles.\" The idea being, of course, that over a long season, skills win out and roles can change. And that's my big problem with Richardson (and, coming soon, Bishop Sankey!). The big argument for him is \"he's the guy!\" Well, he was the guy last year too, and Donald Brown was better than him. I hear ya on how good he was his rookie year, but ... was he? Ran for less than 1,000 yards and averaged just 3.6 yards per carry, his fantasy value was carried by 12 touchdowns and a whopping 70 targets in the pass game. Don't think he's scoring 12 times this year and maybe he gets that much volume this year, but I'd hate to count on that, especially given all the other pass-catchers at Andrew Luck's disposal this year. The past two years they've said they want to be a power running team. And the past two years they've been 22nd and 23rd in rushing attempts. Read this blog from NFL Nation's Mike Wells, then tell me if you still think they're gonna run a ton. With a straight face.\n\nT.Y. Hilton, WR, Colts (seventh, eighth): I swear, I actually really like the Colts this year. And I absolutely love Hilton's talent. The best wide receiver on the Colts, and it's not close. Here's my issue on him for fantasy: inconsistency. He led the Colts in targets last year. In fact, starting in Week 9 (after Reggie Wayne went down), Hilton averaged nine targets a game. His 84 targets from Week 9 on was the seventh-most in the NFL. And here were his point totals in those games: 30, 13, 4, 3, 4, 0, 7, 5, 15. One great week, two very solid weeks, five brutal weeks. And again, that was while he was seeing the seventh-most targets in the NFL. Reggie Wayne is back. So is Dwayne Allen (don't discount that!). They added Hakeem Nicks. Da'Rick Rogers is coming on. There's no way he sees the kind of volume he did last year where, again, he was wildly inconsistent. He'll have four or five awesome games this year but a bunch of stinkers as well and, given the other high-upside guys you have to pass on to take Hilton. Cordarrelle Patterson, Torrey Smith and Michael Floyd are all in the same ADP area code, and I'd rather have any of them.\n\nRussell Wilson, QB, Seahawks (seventh, 12th): Mark Sanchez. Brandon Weeden. Chad Henne. Sorry. Just listing some of the quarterbacks who have more 300-yard games the past two years than Russell Wilson. He has two. In 32 games, Russell Wilson has thrown for 300 yards twice. Exhibit A in why real football often differs from fantasy, I think Russell Wilson is a pretty good NFL QB. I also think he's an overrated fantasy QB. Yes, he finished eighth in fantasy scoring among quarterbacks, but that's more a result of playing all 16 games than anything else. Remember, we play a weekly game and on a points-per-game basis, he was 13th last year, averaging just .13 points more per game than Alex Smith. The Seahawks just won the Super Bowl with the 2nd-lowest passing play percentage in the NFL. If you're Pete Carroll, why are you changing that? Yell \"Percy Harvin\" at me all you want, but Harvin, who is no guarantee to stay healthy, has never had a 1,000-yard receiving season in his career. Need more? Over the past two years, the Seahawks have the second slowest offensive pace of any team. They are in no hurry. And when they get close? They run. Wilson threw the ball 22 times inside an opponent's 10-yard line. That was tied for 19th in the league and only two more than Sam Bradford, who, you know, played seven games last year. Not a top-10 QB this year, despite being drafted like one.\n\nCarolina D/ST (eighth, 15th): See D/ST, Seattle.\n\nMatt Prater, K, Broncos (ninth, 16th): I mean, come on people. Really? I'm sure people think I am cherry-picking here and taking an easy \"hate\" but I don't define the average draft positions. These are based on real ESPN.com drafts. And in the millions of ESPN drafts, Matt Prater is going, on average, in the ninth round. I could tell you the stat I mentioned in Manifesto ... that, on average, the best kicker is worth about two points more a game. That last year, Stephen Gostkowski had one of the three highest-scoring season for a kicker since 1960. He was a top-10 kicker in 11 weeks, the most for a kicker since 2004. Which sounds impressive until you look at it another way: One of the best kicker seasons in fantasy history and there were still five weeks where he shouldn't have been started. But it's not just about the unpredictable nature of kickers or the statistically small difference between kicker No. 1 and No. 10. It's also about opportunity cost. Look at who you are passing on in the eighth and ninth rounds for a defense or kicker: Michael Floyd, Sammy Watkins, Joique Bell, Jeremy Maclin, Reggie Wayne, Emmanuel Sanders, Pierre Thomas ... lots of high upside plays or solid veterans that will help you with bye-week depth and are undervalued. If you draft Matt Prater in the ninth round, then I have failed you. Your parents have failed you. And yes, America has failed you.\n\nAnquan Boldin, WR, 49ers (10th, 13th): There's nothing wrong with Anquan Boldin. He's fine. Professional wide receiver on a good team. But .... meh. You know? Meh. Whatevs, dude. It goes more to draft philosophy than anything, but for me, Boldin is what he is. Maybe less. With Crabtree there for the full year, the addition of Stevie Johnson, Vernon Davis ... does Boldin get 129 targets again? For comparison sake, the year before, Michael Crabtree got 127 targets playing all 16 games. Just feel like there's no upside here and in the 10th round, I'd rather take a flyer on a guy who could explode. Not literally, of course. Terrance Williams, Kendall Wright, Mike Wallace (this year's DeSean Jackson in Bill Lazor's offense?), Cecil Shorts are all going within 10 picks of Boldin and I'd much rather take a flier on any of them. Winners don't settle for guys like Anquan Boldin and you're a winner, kid. You just don't know it yet.\n\nDeAngelo Williams, RB, Panthers (11th, 13th): Not part of the goal-line package (it's gonna be Cam and Tolbert), on the wrong side of 30, bad offensive line and part of a three-headed RBBX monster. Yet somehow going ahead of better-upside running backs such as Lamar Miller and Khiry Robinson. I like him. I just want him on your team, not mine. Is that wrong?\n\nHakeem Nicks, WR, Colts (12th, 14th): Remember when he used to be Hakeem Nicks? Sigh. (Side note: I swear! I don't hate the Colts! Promise!)\n\nEli Manning, QB, Giants (13th, Shouldn't be drafted: Nineteen different quarterbacks are being drafted in the first 14 rounds of at least 40 percent of ESPN.com leagues. There is absolutely no need for this. If you have a quarterback where you are concerned about health -- maybe RGIII, Cutler or Romo -- OK, fine. I can see grabbing a backup. But if you ever need to start Eli, your season has gone horribly, horribly wrong. He may have a decent matchup here or there but Eli -- or someone similar -- will always be available on your waiver wire. I'd rather use that roster spot on a running back or wide receiver with upside. This year, you can't have too many running backs.\n\nAnd with that, Love Hate 2014 is in the books. Well, book. Not plural. And not even a book, because who reads books anymore. Other than \"Fantasy Life,\" now in paperback with three new chapters. Ha! Snuck a plug in. You may be prepping for your draft but I am in midseason form, my Internet friend. Happy drafting.\n\nMatthew Berry -- The Talented Mr. Roto -- thinks strange things are afoot at the Circle K.
