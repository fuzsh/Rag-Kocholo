Jen was born and raised in Center, Texas. She graduated from Center High School, the Class of 2001. In 2011 she married the love of her life, Garnet White Ill. The two spent over 13 years together. Jen enjoyed laughing, spending time with family, friends, and was always the life of the party. She loved her husband, children, and family dearly. She was an outstanding cook and interior decorator. She enjoyed trying new recipes, watching cooking shows, mukbangs, and grilling. All of her loved ones had a special entree or dessert of hers they loved and would often request her to make. She was a Daddyâ€™s Girl. She did it all. From field dressing deer to scaling fish with a spoon. Jen worked serving others as a private caretaker as her heart was focused on serving others.
