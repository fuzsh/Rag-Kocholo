Guy Verhofstadt

Member of the European Parliament, 47th Prime Minister of Belgium

Guy Verhofstadt served for a decade as the leader of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), the centrist-liberal grouping in the European parliament. He is also the former Prime Minister of Belgium and has been charged with leading the EU's negotiating team on the UK's departure from the Union.

"One of the architects of the current structure of power in the European Union"

After studying law, Guy became a member of the Ghent City Council and quickly rose within the ranks of Belgium's VLD party. He became an MP and then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for the Budget whilst still in his 30s. After losing power, Guy took control of the party and reinvented it, making it more attractive to representatives of other parties. After taking time away from politics, Guy returned as president of the VLD winning the general election and becoming the first liberal PM in over 60 years. Guy retained the office for eight years before becoming a Senator and then an MEP.
