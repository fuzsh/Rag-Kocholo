        "text": "MOTION FOR A EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT RESOLUTION\n\non proposals of the European Parliament for the amendment of the Treaties\n\n(2022/2051(INL))\n\nThe European Parliament,\n\n– having regard to Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union,\n\n– having regard to the Manifesto of Ventotene[1],\n\n– having regard to the Schuman declaration of 9 May 1950[2],\n\n– having regard to its resolution of 9 June 2022 on the call for a Convention for the revision of the Treaties[3],\n\n– having regard to Rules 46, 54 and 85(1) of its Rules of Procedure,\n\n– having regard to the opinions of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on Culture and Education and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs,\n\n– having regard to the position in the form of amendments of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality,\n\n– having regard to the letters of the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy,\n\n– having regard to the report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (A9-0337/2023),\n\nA. whereas the current version of the Treaties entered into force on 1 December 2009 and since then the European Union has faced unprecedented challenges and multiple crises, in particular Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine;\n\nB. whereas amending the Treaties is necessary, not as an end in itself, but in the interest of all Union citizens, as these amendments aim to reshape the Union in a way that will enhance its capacity to act, as well as its democratic legitimacy and accountability;\n\nC. whereas amending the Treaties should enable the Union to more effectively tackle geopolitical challenges;\n\nD. whereas the Union’s institutional framework, and in particular its decision making process, especially that in the Council, is barely adequate for a Union of 27 Member States; whereas the prospect of future enlargements makes a reform of the Treaties inevitable;\n\nE. whereas on 9 May 2022 the Conference on the Future of Europe finished its work and presented its conclusions; whereas those conclusions contain 49 proposals and 326 measures, many of which are only possible to implement if there are changes to the Treaties;\n\n1. Reiterates its call for the amendment of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU); calls on the Council to immediately and without deliberation submit the proposals set out in this resolution and reflected in the Annex hereto to the European Council; calls on the European Council to convene a Convention in accordance with the ordinary revision procedure provided for in Article 48(2) to (5) TEU as soon as possible;\n\n2. Notes that several countries of the Western Balkans are in various stages of accession negotiations; welcomes the granting of candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova on 23 June 2022;\n\nInstitutional Reforms\n\n3. Highlights the importance of reforming decision-making in the Union to more accurately reflect a bicameral system by further empowering the European Parliament, and by changing the voting mechanism in the Council;\n\n4. Demands the strengthening of the Union’s capacity to act by considerably increasing the number of areas where actions are decided by qualified majority voting (QMV) and through the ordinary legislative procedure (OLP);\n\n5. Calls for Parliament to gain the right of initiative for legislation, in particular the right to introduce, amend, or repeal Union law, and to become a co-legislator for the adoption of the multiannual financial framework;\n\n6. Calls for the reversal of the roles of Council and Parliament in the nomination and confirmation of the President of the Commission to more accurately reflect the results of European elections; proposes to enable the Commission President to choose its members based on political preferences, whilst ensuring geographic and demographic balance; calls for the renaming of the European Commission as the European Executive;\n\n7. Proposes to increase the transparency of the Council of the European Union by requiring it to publish those of its positions which form part of the normal legislative process, and to organise a public debate on the Council’s positions; proposes the creation of a legal basis empowering the co-legislators to strengthen the transparency and integrity of their decision-making;\n\n8. Calls for the Convention to discuss, in addition to the proposals set out in this resolution, and reflected in the Annex hereto, the division of subjects between the TEU and the TFEU to address the difficulty of amending Union law; calls for the Convention to examine in which policy areas Union structures could increase the effectiveness of the Union;\n\n9. Proposes that the composition of the European Parliament become Parliament’s exclusive competence;\n\n10. Proposes to strengthen the role of social partners in the preparation of any initiatives in the areas of social, employment and economic policy;\n\n11. Proposes the introduction of a European referendum on matters relevant to the Union’s actions and policies; calls for the strengthening of instruments for citizens’ participation in the EU decision-making process within the framework of representative democracy;\n\nCompetences\n\n12. Proposes to establish exclusive Union competence for the environment and biodiversity as well as negotiations on climate change;\n\n13. Proposes to establish shared competences on public health matters and the protection and improvement of human health, especially cross-border health threats, civil protection, industry, and education especially when transnational issues such as mutual recognition of degrees, grades, competences and qualifications are concerned;\n\n14. Proposes to further develop Union shared competences in the areas of energy, foreign affairs, external security and defence, external border policy in the area of freedom, security and justice, and cross-border infrastructure;\n\nSubsidiarity\n\n15. Proposes that the subsidiarity review by the Court of Justice of the European Union be strengthened; calls for the opinion of regional parliaments with legislative powers to be taken into account in the reasoned opinions on legislative drafts of national parliaments; proposes to extend the deadline for “yellow card” procedures to 12 weeks;\n\n16. Proposes that a “green card mechanism” for legislative proposals by national or regional parliaments with legislative powers be introduced in order to make Union law more responsive to local needs;\n\nRule of Law\n\n17. Proposes to strengthen and reform the procedure in Article 7 TEU with regard to the protection of the rule of law by ending unanimity, introducing a clear timeframe, and by making the Court of Justice the arbiter of violations;\n\n18. Suggests providing for jurisdiction for inter-institutional disputes at the Court of Justice of the European Union;\n\n19. Suggests a pre-emptive review of norms at the Court of Justice of the European Union (‘abstract review of norms’), designed as a minority right in Parliament; suggests furthermore to empower Parliament to bring cases of non-compliance with the Treaties before the Court of Justice of the European Union;\n\nForeign, Security and Defence Policy\n\n20. Reiterates its call for decisions on sanctions, interim steps in the enlargement process and other foreign policy decisions to be taken by QMV; underlines that the proposals provide for an exception to this principle for decisions authorising military missions or operations with executive mandate;\n\n21. Calls for the establishment of a defence union including military units, a permanent rapid deployment capacity, under the operational command of the Union; proposes that joint procurement and the development of armaments be financed by the Union through a dedicated budget under parliamentary co-decision and scrutiny and proposes that the competences of the European Defence Agency be adjusted accordingly; notes that clauses with regard to national traditions of neutrality and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) membership would not be affected by these changes;\n\n22. Proposes that the Convention examine ways to prevent tax havens from distorting competition in the single market;\n\nSingle Market, Economy & Budget\n\n23. Proposes that reinforced QMV be used for decisions on direct and indirect taxation; calls for the establishment of the multiannual financial framework for a five year period;\n\n24. Calls for measures to ensure that Member States invest in achieving the European economic, social, and environmental and security objectives; proposes for Article 122 TFEU to be deleted and replaced by a reworded emergency clause that provides for full parliamentary scrutiny in Article 222 TFEU;\n\n25. Insists that the four freedoms of the internal market must be applied equally by all Member States and the institutions of the Union;\n\nSocial Policies and Labour Market\n\n26. Reiterates its call for a social progress protocol to be annexed to the Treaties;\n\nEducation\n\n27. Calls for the Union to develop common objectives and standards for an education that promotes democratic values and the rule of law, as well as digital and economic literacy; calls further for the Union to promote cooperation and coherence between educational establishments systems while guaranteeing the cultural traditions and regional diversity;\n\n28. Calls for the Union to develop common standards on vocational training to increase the mobility of workers; proposes that the Union aim to protect and promote access to free and universal schooling, institutional and individual academic freedom, and human rights, as defined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union;\n\nTrade and investment\n\n29. Suggests that the promotion of democratic values, good governance, human rights and sustainability as well as foreign investment, investment protection and economic security be included in the scope of the common commercial policy; proposes that the European Parliament and the Council, upon a recommendation from the Commission, open trade negotiations; proposes to establish a permanent mechanism for the screening of foreign direct investment;\n\nNon-Discrimination\n\n30. Proposes to expand non-discrimination protections to gender, social origin, language, political opinion and membership of a national minority and to introduce OLP for non-discrimination legislation; proposes to replace ‘the equality of men and women’ by ‘gender equality’ throughout the Treaties; underlines that the Union’s institutions and their governing and consultative bodies must be composed in a non-discriminatory manner and reflect gender equality and diversity of society;\n\n31. Calls for additional protections for national minorities and for regional and minority languages in the Union to be included in the Treaties;\n\nClimate and Environment\n\n32. Proposes that the reduction of global warming and safeguarding biodiversity be included as aims of the Union; suggests adding climate and biodiversity protection to the Union’s sustainable development goals; suggests including sustainability in the Treaty provisions on fisheries; calls for the Union to protect the natural foundations of life and animals, in line with the One Health approach, as well as to take account of the risk of crossing planetary boundaries; calls for international obligations of the Union to pursue efforts to limit the global temperature increase to be incorporated into the Treaties;\n\nEnergy Policy\n\n33. Calls for the creation of an integrated European energy union; suggests that the Union’s energy system must be affordable and based on energy efficiency, renewable energies and in conformity with international agreements to mitigate climate change;\n\nArea of Freedom, Justice and Security\n\n34. Proposes that Europol receive additional competences subject to parliamentary scrutiny; suggests that gender-based violence and environmental crime be added as areas of crime that meet the criteria of Article 83(1) TFEU (Union crimes); calls for the functioning of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office to be governed by the OLP;\n\nMigration\n\n35. Calls for common minimum standards for the acquisition of Union citizenship by third-country nationals, as well as for common standards for long-term visas and residency permits to prevent the sale and abuse of citizenship and residency;\n\n36. Proposes that the Union’s common immigration policy be strengthened by taking appropriate and necessary measures to ensure the efficient monitoring, securing and effective control of the Union's external borders and for the Union’s migration policy to take into account the economic and social stability of Member States, the ability to meet labour demands of the single market, as well as the efficient management of migration, taking into account the fair treatment of third country nationals;\n\nHealth\n\n37. Suggests that the Union set common indicators for healthcare systems; proposes that the Union take measures for the early notification, monitoring and control of serious cross-border threats to health, in particular in the event of pandemics, without preventing Member States from maintaining or adopting reinforced protective measures where these are imperative;\n\n38. Calls for the Union to take measures for monitoring and coordinating the access to common diagnostics, information and care on communicable and non-communicable diseases including rare diseases;\n\nScience and Technology\n\n39.

It reiterates Parliament’s call for the amendment of the Treaties and call on the Council to immediately and without deliberation submit Parliament’s proposals to the European Council. Furthermore, it calls on the European Council to convene a Convention in accordance with the ordinary revision procedure provided for in Article 48(2) to (5) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), as soon as possible.\n\nThe current Treaties entered into force on 1 December 2009. Since then the European Union has faced unprecedented challenges and multiple crises, in particular Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. The proposals in this report aim to reshape the Union in a way that will enhance the Union’s capacity to act and strengthen its democratic legitimacy and accountability.\n\nOn 9 May 2022 the Conference on the Future of Europe (COFE) finished its work and presented its conclusions. Those conclusions contain 49 proposals and 326 measures, The European Parliament welcomed the conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe of 9 May 2022 and noted that several of the Conference proposals require amendments to the Treaties.\n\nThe European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have committed to following up effectively on the conclusions of the Conference, each within the remit of their competences and in accordance with the Treaties.\n\nWithout aiming to be exhaustive and focusing in particular on conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe that require institutional reforms, the COFE proposals listed below have been taken into account in the proposals for the amendment of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Protocol (No 2) on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality:\n\nCOFE proposals 39.1 (21.1 for CFSP, 6.7 for environment e.a) on reassessing decision-making and voting rules (in particular replacing decision-making by unanimity by qualified majority voting) have been taken into account in the proposals for the amendment of Articles 7, 16, 24, 29, 31, 42, 46, 48 of the TEU as well as the proposals for the amendment of Articles 19, 22, 23, 64,70, 77, 81, 83, 86, 87, 88, 113, 115, 121, 126, 153, 192, 194, 207, 218, 222, 223, 226, 234, 238, 245, 246, 247, 262, 286, 294, 311, 312, 329, 330, 333, 342,346, 352, 353 and 354 TFEU.\n\nCOFE proposal 25 on rule of law, democratic values and European identity, proposal 13.6 on gender equality and proposal 48.2 on language diversity have been taken into account in the proposals for the amendment of Articles 2, 3, 7, 13, 49 TEU, as well as Articles 8, 10,19, 24 a (new), 157, 179 and 354 TFEU.\n\nCOFE proposals 36, 37, 38.2, 38.3, 38.4, 46.1, 47.2 on strengthening citizens’ rights and participation, information and youth (including an EU wide referendum) have been taken into account in the proposals for the amendment of Articles 10, 11, 48, 54, TEU, as well as Articles 4, 20, 22, 24, 26, 79, 263 and 294 TFEU.\n\nCOFE proposal 38.3 and 38.4 on strengthening links between citizens and their elected representatives, in particular on giving citizens a greater say on who is elected as President, amending EU electoral law, giving Parliament a right of initiative and allowing it to decide on the budget as is the right of parliaments on national level, have been taken into account in the proposal for the amendment of Article 17 TEU, as well as proposals for the amendment of Articles 78, 223, 225, 226, 234, 247, 259, 285, 286, 294, 311 and 312 TFEU.\n\nCOFE proposal 39.2 and 22.1 on the transparency of EU decision-making has been taken into account in the proposals for the amendment of Articles 10, 11, and 16 TEU, as well as Article 15 TFEU.\n\nCOFE proposals 38.4, 39.2, 39.5, 39.6, 40.3 and 40.5, as well as 11.3, 13, and 36.8 advocating a more inclusive decision-making process, strengthening, inter alia, the role of social partners, have been taken into account in the proposals for the amendment of Articles 10, 11 TEU, as well as Articles 9, 121, 151,153, 166 and 299 a (new) and following TFEU.\n\nCOFE proposal 39.3 on considering changing the names of EU institutions, to clarify their functions and respective role in the EU decision-making process for citizens, has been taken into account in particular in the proposal for the amendment of Article 17 TEU. These changes should apply throughout the Treaties.\n\nCOFE proposals 2, 3, 4, 6.7, 8.3, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18 , 23,24, 41,42, 43, 46.1 on strengthening the competences, role and action of the EU in the areas of climate change, environment, biodiversity, health, civil protection, industry, education, energy, foreign affairs, external security and defence, external border policy in an area of freedom security and justice, migration, cross border infrastructure, single market, economy, social policies and labour market, trade and investment and science and technology have been taken into account in the proposals for the amendment of Articles 3, 21,29,42,43,45, and 46 TEU, as well as Articles 3,4, 9, 11, 43, 67, 77, 79, 83, 88, 108, 113, 119, 126, 148,151, 151 a (new), 153, 165, 168, 179, 189, 191, 194, 206, 207, 218, 222, 258, 259, 260, 263, 275 and 352 TFEU\n\nCOFE proposal 40.1 and 40.2 on active subsidiarity and the role of national parliaments have been taken into account in the proposals for the amendment of Article 19 TEU and Article 263 TFEU as well as the proposals to reinforce Protocol No 2 on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and integrate it into the TFEU (Articles 299 a (new) TFEU and following).\n\nPosition of co-rapporteur Helmut Scholz on Foreign, Security and Defence Policy\n\nCo-rapporteur Helmut SCHOLZ takes note of the COFE proposals on establishing an EU Defence Union and QMV in the CFSP, but expresses reservations regarding the amendments covered by paragraphs 20 and 21 of the resolution. He believes that an EU Defence Union must be built on a comprehensive, multi-layer and non-military concept of security underpinned by unanimity of all EU Member States and requiring full parliamentary scrutiny both at Union and Member States' level. Co-rapporteur Helmut SCHOLZ intends to introduce proposals for a revised CSFP and CSDP during the Convention that is called for. He underlines in particular the Union's responsibility for contributing to international peace and security in accordance with international law, fostering active engagement for disarmament, particularly of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, and joining the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). The restructuring of EU Member States’ military capacity into EU wide structures should, in his view, be based on the principle of structural non-aggression capabilities. As most Member states are also members of NATO, any treaty change, in his view, must rule out a duplication of military capacity and budget expenditure. Treaty change must therefore be accompanied with steps towards a de-coupling from NATO."
