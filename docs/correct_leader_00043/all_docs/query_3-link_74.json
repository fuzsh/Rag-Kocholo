        "text": "By Shaun Connolly, Press Association Political Correspondent\n\nEuropean Parliament Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt has joined the Liberal Democrats on the campaign trail, saying they offer an \"alternative to nationalism\".\n\nMr Verhofstadt joined Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable canvassing in London on Friday as he predicted a Remain surge in upcoming European Parliament elections.\n\nMr Verhofstadt insisted his presence was not foreign interference in the UK's elections as he was \"a Lib Dem\" and backing the party because it opposed Brexit.\n\nSir Vince said he was campaigning to combat \"ugly populism\".\n\nMr Verhofstadt said: \"I think it's important to show that the European liberals and democrats support Vince Cable.\n\n\"Support the Lib Dems in this difficult fight in Britain, in these European elections.\n\n\"Secondly, we want to show by coming here a message to the continent to say never repeat Brexit again.\n\n\"I'm a Lib Dem. It's natural that people are looking to the Lib Dems when it comes to European elections.\n\n\"We want to be the alternative for nationalism and popularism.\n\n\"What I think is there will be a huge support for Remain.\n\n\"I'm not here as a Brexit negotiator, I'm here as the leader of the liberals and democrats for Europe.\"\n\nAsked if his presence could be seen as foreign interference, Mr Verhofstadt said: \"This is Europe. Europe, it's all Europe.\"\n\nSir Vince said: \"We are fighting nationalism.\n\n\"We are patriotic people in our different countries, but we are fighting nationalism.\"\n\nThe Lib Dem leader said his party was standing up \"to the ugly populism that is now happening\" as it campaigned ahead of the May 23 Euro poll.\n\nPic by Yui Mok/PA Wire"
