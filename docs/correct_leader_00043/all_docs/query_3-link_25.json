        "text": "Bart De Wever, the leader of the largest party in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium, is a unique figure among right-wing European populists. He is neither hostile to the European Union nor interested in the alleged threat of Islam to Western civilization. Instead, he is preoccupied with the prospective death of Belgium. “I think Belgium will be snuffed out slowly,” he told me in October. “Slowly, like a candle, barely noticed by anyone.”\n\nWe met at the headquarters of his New Flemish Alliance Party, in Brussels, the unofficial capital of the European Union. Like the E.U., Brussels is in a permanent state of identity crisis: it is at once the capital of Belgium, which hasn’t managed to form a government since federal elections were held in June, and the capital of Flanders, even though less than a tenth of its residents are native Dutch speakers. Most people in Brussels speak French, the language of Wallonia, the other main region of Belgium. De Wever’s Brussels headquarters, with its bare walls and cheap furniture, have the improvised feel of a campaign office in an unwinnable race, out of place in the grand Rue Royale, or, as Flemings like De Wever call it, Koningsstraat.\n\nKnown for his love of French fries— a truly pan-Belgian taste—De Wever has put on a lot of weight since he entered politics as a member of parliament, in 2004, and that, combined with his rosy cheeks, floppy dark hair, and open-necked shirt, gives him the look of an eager, plump schoolboy. He used to be a professor of Belgian history, and became a Flemish celebrity last year when he outshone his opponents on a popular TV quiz show called “The Smartest Person in the World.”\n\nDe Wever wasn’t contemplating Belgium’s death mournfully. The platform of his Flemish nationalist party calls for an independent Flanders. This would leave Wallonia high and dry, a rump state, with or without Brussels, and with or without the Belgian throne, whose current occupant is Albert II. The rise of De Wever’s party certainly suggests that Belgium’s always segmented sense of identity may be drifting toward a point of no return: a stress fracture threatens to become an outright break. Normally, after an election the winning parties of Flanders and Wallonia will agree, over much fine dining and good wine, to form a federal government together. This time, they are still quarrelling. Not a few Belgians are sounding the alarm. Belgium, in the words of Eric van Rompuy, a Flemish M.P., “is in coma.” Brussels, a Flemish writer told me, “is a powder keg waiting to go off.” A longtime American resident of Brussels even pressed on me that he didn’t “discount the possibility of real violence.”\n\nThe problem with Belgium is that its citizens have so little left in common. Of its 10.8 million inhabitants, about sixty per cent speak Dutch and live mostly in Flanders, while forty per cent speak French and live mostly in Wallonia. There is also a small number of German speakers, in East Flanders. The Flemings and the Walloons have their own political parties, newspapers, TV stations, novelists, and pop stars. But the issues dividing them are not just cultural or linguistic. Wallonia is controlled by the Francophone Socialist Party (Flanders has its own socialist party), which runs the region of Rust Belt industries like a baronial fiefdom, and resists any notion of secession, in part because it depends for its survival on large transfers of federal funds. Like the conservatives in northern Italy, who resent having to spend their taxes on the poorer south, De Wever’s Flemish voters, who have recently grown prosperous on multinational business and trade, would prefer to keep their money for themselves. Most of them may not actually want a divorce from Wallonia, just yet, but they would like a separation, with Brussels as the contested offspring.\n\nBrussels is what complicates the secessionist dream. A Flemish journalist likened the two main regions of Belgium to Siamese twins with only one heart: divide them, and one of them would die. Would Brussels end up as part of Flanders? Wallonia? The European Union? Or as a city-state, perhaps?\n\nDe Wever nodded gravely when I raised the issue. “Yes, without Brussels it would already have happened,” he said. “You see, Brussels is the child of Belgium. It is Belgium, neither Walloon nor Flemish but Belgian. Brussels is fighting to preserve Belgium. Yet most people in Flanders, as well as in Wallonia, dislike it.” The Flemings, he explained, don’t feel at home there because Brussels has been, as he put it, “deculturalized.” Once a largely Dutch-speaking city, Brussels saw its Flemish citizens become mostly Francophone in the nineteenth century, because French was the language of high culture and social mobility, whereas Dutch, in an oft-quoted phrase, was “for domestics and animals.” And the Walloons resent Brussels, because it was always the city of fat cats who got rich off the mines and factories of the south, the Black Country, the Pays Noir.\n\nIf Brussels can be described as the child of Belgium, it was in some ways the parent as well. Belgium, as an independent state, was the creation of the Brussels élite, which, in 1830, decided that it no longer wished to be ruled by the Dutch king. French-speaking Flemings and Walloons, supported by the Catholic Church, broke away from the mostly Protestant Netherlands, and imported their own king, who, like most European kings, came from Germany. The Flemish region was poor and largely rural then. All the wealth came from the industrial south. Until the mid-twentieth century, many of the world’s railway and tram cars were made from Black Country steel. When the coal mines and steel plants started to shut down, in the nineteen-sixties, former Wallonian boomtowns such as Charleroi and La Louvière were left to rot, while Brussels got on with its European business.\n\nNow that Flanders has become the wealthier region, and educated Dutch-speaking Flemings, such as De Wever, look to Britain and the United States for cultural sustenance rather than to France, there is no Brussels élite left to hold the nation together. The Flemish and the Walloon leaders barely know each other anymore. When De Wever wanted to congratulate the Socialist Party leader, Elio Di Rupo, on his election victory in Wallonia, he couldn’t even find his cell-phone number. And these are the men who have to form a government together.\n\nThat this is happening in the center of Europe is, to say the least, of symbolic importance. As De Wever put it, “The paradox of today is that, as Europe is growing together, the nation-state is falling apart.” That’s an exaggeration, but the idea of national sovereignty, and trust in the old political classes, has been weakened by economic globalization and by the transfer of authority from national to European institutions, often referred to simply, and rarely positively, as “Brussels.” Throughout Europe, a growing number of people, in some version of the Tea Party mantra, “want their country back”—from “Brussels,” or from overeducated technocrats, or from immigrants. The alienation among the Belgians is, in this respect, a typically European story.\n\nThis isn’t the way it was supposed to be. When the first steps toward European unity were made, in the nineteen-fifties and sixties, notably in the Brussels Treaty of 1965, Belgium, as a democratic, multilingual, multicultural state, served as a model for the pan-European ideal. One day, Euro-idealists thought, all Europeans would get on just as well as the Flemings and the Walloons did.\n\nBelgium seemed destined to be the ideal center for the new Europe, not least because of its history: Charlemagne (742-814) is thought to have been born there, as was Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor (1500-58). And Belgium’s new dynamism was symbolized by the Brussels World’s Fair in 1958, with that great silvery monument to modernity the Atomium, built in the shape of a unit cell of an iron crystal. Here was the future of the united Europe, a continent of regions as much as nation-states.\n\nIn some respects, this wish came true. The trouble is that the diminishment of national sovereignty emboldened regional solidarity—among, for example, the Flemings, the Scots, the Catalonians, the Basques—without any compensating love for the European Union. Belgium gradually became a model of what can go wrong when the center starts to melt. And the other regions of Europe are watching carefully to see how this story will turn out.\n\nThat’s not to say that tensions between Dutch speakers and French speakers are a recent development. At the University of Ghent, in a lovely old Flemish city to the northwest of Brussels, I spoke with Bart De Wever’s elder brother, Bruno, who teaches Belgian history there, and who explained that the language divide was always a social divide, too. Ghent, as it happens, was the first Belgian university to teach only in Dutch. This right was granted in 1930, on the centenary of Belgian independence, and the words of the rector at that time, August Vermeylen, were pinned to the wall outside Bruno De Wever’s office: “We want to be Flemings, to become Europeans.” Professor De Wever, a much trimmer version of his more famous brother, told me about the “Flemish movement,” which called for equal rights, and was initially led, in the late nineteenth century, by professors and literary men. One of the sacred monuments of the Flemish movement is a huge tower in the shape of a cross on the River Yser, where, during the First World War, many Flemish soldiers died in battle, allegedly because they couldn’t understand the orders from their Francophone officers. The Yser monument bears the letters “AVV—VVK,” a Dutch abbreviation for “Everything for Flanders—Flanders for Christ.”\n\nWhen Belgium was occupied by the Germans during the Second World War, Flemish nationalism took a fateful turn toward collaboration. Germanic brotherhood, many Flemish activists thought, would be the best way to advance their cause. De Wever’s grandfather, a schoolteacher, became a member of the Flemish Fascist party in 1943. “Not the best timing,” Bruno murmured.\n\nAfter the war, their father, a railroad worker, joined the far-right Flemish Militant Order. “The Flemish movement emerged from the Second World War deeply tainted by collaboration, a trauma that is still kept alive by the Islamophobic Vlaams Belang,” Bruno explained. He was referring to the right-wing “Flemish Interest” party, which is anti-E.U. as well as anti-immigrant. In 2004, the V.B., with such slogans as “This is OUR country,” got twenty-four per cent of the votes in Flanders. In the last elections, it held onto more than ten per cent. The politicians of Wallonia have a habit of using the collaborationist legacy to discredit any form of Flemish activism. Recently, a Francophone TV station showed a documentary that featured the collaborationist past of the De Wevers’ grandfather. (Bart De Wever, responding in a newspaper article, pointed out that the most notorious Nazi collaborator was Léon Degrelle, a Walloon.)\n\n“There is no question that there has been a continuity, in terms of people and ideas, of the collaborationist past,” Bruno De Wever said. “But there has also been a fresh wind blowing in Flanders. We have dealt with the past honestly, much more so than in Wallonia, where the history of Degrelle and his Wallonian Nazis is still passed over as an aberration.” Because Bart De Wever and his party pointedly avoid the xenophobic rhetoric that’s customary among right-wing populists, they have helped make Flemish nationalism respectable again, and his electoral gains in Flanders have come, in part, at the expense of the Vlaams Belang.\n\nOthers, on the Wallonian side, but also among the Flemish left, continue to see De Wever as a respectable front man for hard-line Flemish nationalism. But De Wever claims that his agenda has moved beyond any concern with linguistic or cultural conflicts. “We have achieved cultural emancipation,” he told me. “That is no longer part of our discourse. We’re interested in democracy and efficiency.”\n\nA little more efficiency would certainly not go amiss in Belgium. Owing to compromises struck between the different language communities in the past, not only does the country have separate governments and prime ministers for Wallonia, Flanders, and the district of Brussels but Brussels itself is divided into nineteen municipal areas, each with its own mayor, and six police zones. And, apart from many local authorities to administer social affairs, there are also communal authorities, representing the various language groups, which have a say in education and cultural matters. Belgium “is a labyrinth of institutions,” Bart De Wever says. “If you were to ask the average member of the federal parliament to explain how the system works, and who has authority to do what, he would run away in a panic.”\n\nBut “efficiency” is also a code word in the Franco-Dutch culture war, because Flemish nationalists—and not a few Walloons themselves—regard the socialist-governed Wallonia as a model of inefficiency. I had lunch in the European district of Brussels with Christian Laporte, a distinguished journalist for the Francophone newspaper La Libre Belgique. For lunch, he chose a steak tartare, which Belgians call a filet américain. French Belgium, he said, is “an oasis of socialism in Europe.” Where paternalistic industrialists once kept the region afloat, the Party now does the same—but with public money, the movement of which tends to be somewhat opaque. Hence Bart De Wever’s talk about the need for “transparency.” Not surprisingly, “the great Socialist Party machine doesn’t want to be held more responsible,” Laporte said. “It is afraid that its use of federal money will be questioned.”\n\nThe high price of administrative inefficiency became painfully clear in the notorious case of Marc Dutroux, a small-time gangster and pedophile pimp, who, in the mid-nineteen-nineties, kidnapped, molested, and tortured six young girls, only two of whom survived. A lack of coördination and coöperation among different local authorities delayed his apprehension. In October of 1996, three hundred thousand outraged Belgians marched in Brussels in protest—one of the few examples of Walloons and Flemings coming together in a common cause. Dutroux’s home town, where he committed his worst crimes, was Charleroi, one of the places where the Continental European industrial revolution began.\n\nCharleroi is now a dilapidated, sooty town of boarded-up stores and broken glass in the streets, of strip joints, cheap Turkish kebab places, Eastern European gangsters, and middle-aged prostitutes strung out on heroin. I prowled around its crumbling industrial outskirts and grubby streets of small, blackened row houses with Pascal Verbeken, the author of a fine travel book about the region entitled “Poor Wallonia.” Verbeken, who, unusually for a Fleming, takes a deep, sympathetic interest in the French-speaking part of his country, pointed out the many Flemish names in the old cemetery outside Charleroi.\n\n“People have forgotten that during the good years, between the eighteen-forties and the nineteen-fifties, more than half a million Flemings moved down here to work,” he said. “But this doesn’t fit our Flemish self-image anymore, our image of being top dogs.”\n\nThe largest café in the center of town is called La Maison de Huit Heures, for the old socialist demand for a working day of no longer than eight hours. In the bleakest, shabbiest corner of Charleroi, tucked away near the railway sidings, stands the two-story house that used to belong to Marc Dutroux, its façade plastered with a huge picture of a small child flying a kite, now daubed with graffiti.\n\nPascal Verbeken doesn’t like the way his country is going. “You know, everyone talks about the end of Belgium,” he said to me. “And they focus on Flemish nationalism, but Belgium is disappearing in so many different ways, day by day. It’s all very well for the former Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt to go on about being a model European, drinking Burgundy wine, listening to Sibelius, and reading Cavafy. But what about the degradation of our cities, swamped by immigrants from Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, who don’t share any memories of our Belgian past? Flemish nationalism is the reaction of a society that is changing too fast. Nobody knows where we’re heading anymore.”\n\nIf Brussels is Belgium, as Bart De Wever says, it is also the best example of the disappearing Belgium lamented by Pascal Verbeken. A third of the city’s population was born abroad, and the number is growing, even as Belgian-born citizens are moving out, mostly to plush suburbs. There are areas near the center of the city, not far from the splendid Grande Place (or Grote Markt), with its ornate seventeenth-century guildhalls, that are inhabited almost exclusively by immigrants from North Africa, Turkey, Congo, Rwanda, and elsewhere. Molenbeek, a traditional working-class area once known as Little Manchester, is now referred to as Little Marrakech. Bart De Wever avoids talking about such places. But the troubles of Little Marrakech have some relevance to the Franco-Dutch tensions that are pulling Belgium apart.\n\nThe most notorious immigrant area in central Brussels is called Cureghem, known for its high rates of crime and unemployment. In a spasm of “zero tolerance,” the police once staged a raid there with helicopters and riot squads. Part of Cureghem is sub-Saharan African. Young men hang around street corners waiting to buy old cars to ship off to Africa—no questions asked or documents required. Much of the rest is North African, mostly Moroccan. That’s where I met the owner of a grocery store, whom I’ll call Ahmed. He and his wife, a friendly woman in a head scarf, clutching an infant to her breast, were born in Belgium to Moroccan parents. Ahmed wore a neatly clipped beard and smiled often, even when he was voicing his despair at conditions in the neighborhood. He spoke French, as well as Arabic. French is the lingua franca of the streets, because, as Ahmed explained, Moroccans themselves don’t understand one another’s dialects.\n\n“It used to be great here, when I grew up,” he said, smiling wistfully. “Mostly Belgians living here, a few other Europeans, not many immigrants. But now, well, you can see for yourself. Drugs, robberies, arson. They are Moroccan people like us, I know, but I don’t want my children to go out in the streets. The gangs are armed. They buy Kalashnikovs from the East Europeans. I worry about my boy. One bad friend, and he becomes a criminal, too.” Even though Ahmed and his wife are Francophone, they send their children to a Dutch school. “Better education,” he said. I’d been told the reason: Dutch-language schools have fewer pupils from immigrant families. If Ahmed could afford it, he’d move out to a suburb. “But I can’t. We’re stuck here.”\n\nVilvoorde, a genteel old town once known for its thriving horse market, is the kind of suburb that Ahmed would move to, if he could. It is also one of two small towns that Flemish and Walloon political parties are fighting over; the other is Halle. The dispute is a typically Belgian muddle. Vilvoorde and Halle—though Dutch-speaking and situated in Flemish Brabant, a province of Flanders—belong to the same electoral district as bilingual Brussels. This means that the tiny minority of French speakers can vote for French-speaking parties, whereas Dutch speakers in Wallonian Brabant can’t vote for Dutch-speaking Flemish parties. So the Flemish nationalists suddenly decided that Halle and Vilvoorde should be split off from Brussels and incorporated in Flanders for electoral purposes, causing a ruckus that is still going on.\n\nA sign on the wall at the social-welfare office in Vilvoorde informed visitors in Dutch that only Dutch was spoken there. It was not clear what use this sign would be to a non-Dutch speaker. But in Belgium one ceases to wonder about such things. I had come to see Hans Bonte, a socialist town counsellor who also runs the welfare office. Round-faced and blunt-featured, with close-cropped sandy hair, Bonte exudes energy and good will, like a friendly sports coach. Before addressing the vexed matter of Belgian identity, he told me something about Vilvoorde identity: “From the perspective of the authentic Vilvoordener, this is a real Flemish town, with its own purely Flemish identity. From the perspective of Brussels, it is a multilingual Brussels suburb.”\n\nThe Dutch-speaking Flemings, he said, had no trouble accommodating the small, mostly wealthy Francophones in their midst. “I blame the Brussels politicians for radicalizing the communities, even as we try our best to get people to get along.”\n\nI asked Bonte about the flow of non-European immigrants to the suburbs. Was this a problem? Bonte sighed. “Yes, it is,” he said. “You see, they are mostly French-speaking Moroccans, and this annoys the Flemings. For the immigrants make the community not only less white but also more French, more like Brussels.” He guessed that a fifth of Vilvoorde was now French-speaking. “People who used to call the Moroccans monkeys now use the same derogatory terms for all French speakers,” Bonte said. Meanwhile, the Francophone immigrants call the Dutch speakers _sals Flamands, “_dirty Flemings.” It comes as little surprise that xenophobia is growing in Vilvoorde.\n\nIs there a way out of the perilous swamp of ethnic and linguistic identity politics? I was working on my notes one night in my hotel room, with one eye on the television. The Belgian soccer team was playing Ukraine. Soccer still holds many European nations together, and the so-called Red Devils were once the pride of all Belgians. I was watching the game on a Francophone channel, but the team’s coach is a Dutch-speaking Fleming, as are many of the players. I was wondering about the language in the locker room, when I was struck by a short message flashing on the TV screen extolling the achievements of the Red Devils: “Our Team,” it said, in English.\n\nMany people in Brussels urged me to talk to Philippe Van Parijs, a Francophone philosopher and political economist. If anyone might be called the model Belgian, and indeed European, it would be Van Parijs, a tall, thin, bearded man. His father was Flemish, so he speaks fluent Dutch, but he was educated in French, and converses with his British wife in English and his children in Dutch and French.\n\nVan Parijs has a fine town house on the Rue de Pavie (or Paviastraat). One end of the street lets onto the huge and hideous buildings of the European Union, including the Berlaymont, home of the European Commission, also known as the Berlaymonster. From the other end, it is a short walk to St. Joost-Ten-Node, a largely Turkish and Moroccan area, where you can make cheap phone calls to Anatolia, buy a cut-rate ticket to Istanbul, and eat kebabs with frites. Van Parijs’s house is where the so-called Pavia Group of Belgian intellectuals, Flemings and Walloons, meet to discuss the future of their country.\n\nThe Pavia Group’s most important idea is to create a federal constituency in the center of the Belgian confederation of Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels. Instead of just pooling votes from the different regions, the group proposes that a tenth of the federal parliament would be elected directly by all Belgians. This means, Van Parijs said, warming to his subject, that French-speaking politicians will have to campaign in Dutch-speaking regions, and vice versa.\n\nThere are serious obstacles to the Pavia Group’s federalist dream. Too many interests are vested in communal politics. A thoughtful Flemish P.R. executive told me that a federal constituency would only strengthen the domination of the Flemings, given their greater numbers, and so would be rejected by the Walloons. Bart De Wever disagrees. He told me that “the protection of regional rights is so entrenched in Belgium that numerical superiority would not make the Flemings any more dominant.” But then he doesn’t believe in what he calls “state creation.” He has no interest in reviving the comatose Belgian nation.\n\nVan Parijs is unmoved by the skeptics. In fact, he thinks that a similar scheme should be devised for the European Union, with a percentage of the seats in the E.U. parliament voted for by all E.U. citizens. “Of course, it is easier to achieve a sense of solidarity in a monolingual community,” he said, “but the problems in Belgium, and in Europe, can only be solved on a larger scale. Neither Brussels nor Belgium can be governed without federal authority. The same is true of Europe. So we are suggesting a solution, which Belgium has not yet found, but one that would serve as a model for Europe.”\n\nWhen I asked Bart De Wever how the current political impasse would be resolved in Belgium, he gave a rather Gallic shrug. “The future? You might as well peer through thick coffee,” he said. When I asked a distinguished Flemish author, Geert van Istendael, whether he thought the Belgian nation would survive, he said that he had always believed so but was no longer so sure. I put the same question to the Francophone journalist Christian Laporte. He looked up from his filet américain and said, “Look, Belgians spill a great deal of ink, but very little blood.” The same might be said about the always confusing, usually contentious, seemingly hopeless patchwork called the European Union. And yet, as Europe’s bloody history shows, once nations, or empires, or unions fall apart, violence often follows. Bart De Wever, apparently the most benign of European nationalists, is leading his country to the brink of disintegration. A nation collapsing in the center of Europe would not bode well for the fragile state of the European Union. But then De Wever, as a historian, would be well aware of Belgium as the stage of shattered European dreams. Only ten miles from his office lies a town called Waterloo. ♦"
