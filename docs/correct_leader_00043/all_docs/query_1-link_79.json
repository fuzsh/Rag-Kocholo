        "text": "Led by the Joint Committee on European Affairs, with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and Defence and the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, the meeting will focus on the ongoing Brexit negotiations and the Future of Europe.\n\nThe meeting will be chaired by the Ceann Comhairle, Seán O’Fearghaíl, and closing remarks will be made by the Cathaoirleach, Denis O’Donovan.\n\nEU Affairs Committee Chairman, Michael Healy Rae said, “Tomorrow’s meeting is an important opportunity for Committees of the Irish Parliament to engage directly with the key person involved in Brexit in the European Parliament on a variety of issues relating to Brexit. Mr Verhofstadt speaks on behalf of the European Parliament in relation to Brexit and he also chairs the Parliament’s Brexit Steering Group, coordinating and preparing the European Parliament’s considerations and decisions on Brexit. In February, I led a delegation of Committee Members to Brussels where we met Mr Verhofstadt and discussed the implications of the UK’s departure as they relate to Irish interests. His engagement with us tomorrow is a welcome development and follow-on to earlier engagement and one that will provide Members with a valuable opportunity to discuss Brexit and its impact on Ireland. Some of the issues likely to be discussed include the border, Customs Union, how the negotiations are progressing and agriculture.”\n\n“In addition to Brexit, I expect Mr Verhofstadt to outline his views on the Future of Europe debate. The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs is holding a public consultation and stakeholder engagement on this debate, so it will be useful to hear Mr Verhofstadt’s views on where he thinks the EU should be going.”\n\n“From a parliamentary perspective, tomorrow’s meeting is another example of how Oireachtas Committees provide us with a unique opportunity to engage at the highest level with key stakeholders and policy-makers. As Oireachtas Committee Members, we look forward to engaging with Guy Verhofstadt tomorrow on the Irish impact of the UK’s decision to withdraw from the European Union and on the Future of Europe.”\n\nOireachtas TV will have live coverage and analysis from 10.15am on the following channels:\n\n• Saorview Channel 22\n\n• Virgin Media Channel 207\n\n• Sky Channel 574\n\n• eir Vision Channel 504\n\n• Vodafone Channels: Oireachtas TV - 201, Dáil - 207 and Seanad - 208\n\nWatch proceedings live via this link.\n\nPhotographs will be available from Maxwell Photography: office@maxwellphotography.ie"
