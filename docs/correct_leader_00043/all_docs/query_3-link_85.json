        "text": "Joachim Fritz-Vannahme, Europe director of the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German research organization that focuses on democratic reform, said that Mrs. Merkel “finds herself in opposition to more or less all of the E.U.” “In a very prominent way,” he added, “the German government is saying, ‘Our national interest comes first. We behave like all the others do.”’\n\nGermany was historically a main motor of European integration, a project conceived as one of Franco-German reconciliation in the aftermath of World War II. But leaders of the largest economy in Europe, and therefore the biggest contributor to the Union, began to take a more assertive line more than a decade ago when Chancellor Helmut Kohl was replaced by Gerhard Schröder, a politician from a younger generation.\n\nAt times during her period in office, Mrs. Merkel has asserted strong European leadership — on climate change, for example — but today’s crop of issues has prompted a different reflex.\n\n“This is certainly farewell to the Germany of Kohl, which was, at the end of the day, ready to pay with a check for stability within the E.U.,” Mr. Fritz-Vannahme said.\n\nSeveral factors are at play. Mrs. Merkel’s opposition to some of the targets proposed for the Union’s 2020 economic strategy is based on Germany’s constitutional arrangements. Education, one of the areas identified, is the responsibility of powerful regional administrators, whom Mrs. Merkel wants to consult before striking a deal.\n\nThere are stresses, meanwhile, within the new coalition government that have led to deals apparently done by the country’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, then being undone in Berlin.\n\nBut the deeper issues relate to Germany’s economic policy. Fearing that any bailout of Greece could break German constitutional or domestic law — and cost Berlin billions of euros — German support for any emergency mechanism is contingent on others meeting its tough terms. Those terms include a statement that intervention would be a last resort, that the International Monetary Fund would be involved and that there will be new rules to prevent any repeat of the crisis.\n\nOne E.U. diplomat, who was not authorized to speak publicly, asserted: “The Germans are saying, ‘We have had 10 years of the euro. What has happened is proof that this is not working.”’\n\nNicolas Jabko, research director at the Center for International Studies and Research at Sciences Po in Paris, said that different approaches to the Greek issue from France and Germany highlight the two countries’ divergent economic models. While Germany pursues tight fiscal discipline, wage moderation, export and supply-side-driven growth, France has used more consumer demand and deficit spending to post its moderate growth rates.\n\n[…]\n\nMrs. Merkel’s call for the right to exclude countries like Greece actually seems linked to domestic politics before an important regional election in North Rhine-Westphalia in May. Polls suggest that the governing coalition could lose to a liberal combination of Social Democrats, Greens and the Left party. “Many German electors, themselves constantly asked to do more for salary moderation, don’t see why Germany should aid a country that has never imposed fiscal discipline,” Mr. Jabko said.\n\nThat widespread sentiment means that, though she may strike some deals in Brussels this week, Ms. Merkel will do so from a hard-nosed German perspective. “Her argument can be clearly defined as one of national interest,” Mr. Fritz-Vannahme said, “and our national interest is no longer defined as the same thing a Europe’s interest.”\n\nGermany is no longer interested in carrying on in its role as the EU’s paymaster. The government in Berlin sees the danger that an overly hasty agreement to provide direct financial aid to Greece would set a dangerous precedent that might motivate other countries in the wrong ways. The worry: Reform pressure in other countries would diminish and the move would reinforce the mentality in some countries that if worse comes to worst, they could turn to the EU for a handout, and that others would always be there to help.\n\nThe government in Berlin seems little concerned that other countries are now accusing Germany of economic nationalism. Instead, the government sees itself as the true protector of stability in the euro zone, the \"trustee of the treaties.\" The debate over financial aid for Greece, they say, is a question of whether the EU is heading into a fiscal equalization, through direct aid, between countries that would violate the terms of the EU treaties. One could complete that sentiment by stating that Germany, as Europe’s largest economy, does not want to be transformed into an ATM for other European countries with spending problems."
