        "text": "On 11 April 2019, the Bruges Chapter of the 89 Initiative, a pan-European think-do tank based at the European Institute of the London School of Economics and Political Science hosted an event at the College of Europe in Bruges, to discuss the questions collected with its #AskYourFuture campaign (https://89initiative.com/ask-your-future/) with Mr Guy VERHOFSTADT, President of the ALDE Group in the European Parliament, Lead candidate of OpenVld for the European elections and member of ALDE’s Team Europe.\n\nThe event aimed at bridging the so called \"Brussels Bubble\" with citizens, and it revolved around the ambition to reach out to people who are not in contact with politics or the institutions of the European Union. The goal was, in fact, to get to know what changes and developments are most important to those who are not the \"usual suspects\".\n\nThe format of the event was a Keynote Speech from Mr VERHOFSTADT, followed by a debate revolving around the questions collected during the #AskYourFuture campaign.\n\nThis event was open to the public.\n\nAgenda:\n\n19.00: Opening of Registrations (Dijver 9, Entrance)\n\n19.30: Welcoming Remarks (Dijver 9, Room E)\n\n19.45: Keynote Speech by Guy VERHOFSTADT, President of the ALDE Group in the European Parliament, Lead candidate of OpenVld for the European elections and member of ALDE’s Team Europe.\n\n20.15: Q&A Session\n\n20.55: Closing Remarks and Farewell\n\n21.00: End of the Event\n\nAbout the Organiser:\n\n89 Initiative is a pan-European think-do tank. It runs several research programmes and projects such as 89 Connect and Talking Europe. On 11 April a set of major policy recommendations for the new European Parliament will be released. This is the result of the work conducted by the think tank's 5 research directors and their teams in the framework of our five research programmes."
