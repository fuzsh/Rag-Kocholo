        "text": "It was in the late 1990s that Hilde Vautmans, at the time an aspiring politician serving as a university assistant in the Belgian Senate, was first thrust upon the national stage.\n\nWith degrees in social sciences and criminology in hand, she knocked on the doors of the sitting Belgian politicians until someone listened. She was eager to get to work, and she was impatient to make a difference.\n\n“My uncle, Valère Vautmans, was a senator and he taught me a lot – such as how to campaign and how to talk with people,” she recalls. “There I got the politics virus, and I do not regret my choice one minute.”\n\nAfter serving as an assistant to both her uncle and Senator Stef Goris, she caught the eye of Guy Verhofstadt, who was then president of the Liberal Open-VLD party. He needed someone to help advise him for his role as rapporteur of the Belgium’s Rwandan Commission, which was looking into the war crimes committed there. He saw in Hilde someone with not only a bright intellect, but also with a strong sense of moral justice.\n\nIt was during this time that Vautmans first worked closely with Verhofstadt. When Verhofstadt became the Belgian prime minister in June 1999, her work with him thrust her into the spotlight, too.\n\n“There I got the politics virus, and I do not regret my choice one minute.”\n\nOne of Verhofstadt’s first aims was to legalize same-sex marriage in Belgium. “I was working in Verhofstadt’s office, and he was looking for an adviser on the dossier of same-sex-marriage,” says Vautmans. “Nobody at his office was interested and I took it on, as I saw the need for it.”\n\nVautmans was eventually successful, but it took three years for Belgium to follow the Netherlands and become the second country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage in 2003. It was a hard-fought victory.\n\n“My drive and passion helped bring the dossier to a good end, but I never expected to have so many practical obstacles along the way,” Vautmans says. She remembers feeling incredibly impatient, as the bill ran into hurdle after hurdle.\n\nHowever, it was Vautmans’ work on the gay marriage dossier that propelled her into elected office. Fresh from the marriage victory, she was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives in 2003 with 16,488 preference votes. Though she was largely known for spearheading the drive for equal marriage, she was also elected based on her specialisms in national defence, human rights, infrastructure and the fight against crime.\n\nShe served in the Belgian legislature for seven years, during which time she was the chairwoman of the foreign relations committee. She also used her degree in criminology to focus on issues of crime and poverty. She ran a parliamentary inquiry on cults in Belgium and also served on the defense, infrastructure, military purchases and European Affairs committees.\n\nVautmans’ work on the latter guided her to the next phase of her political career. After failing to win reelection in 2010, she set her sights on moving down Brussels’ Rue de la Loi street, from the Belgian Parliament to the European one. She took one of the seats won by Open-VLD in 2014, and took spots on the European Parliament’s Foreign Affairs committee and in the Parliament’s delegation to NATO.\n\nTwo years on, Vautmans says the transition from the Belgian Parliament to the European Parliament has been invigorating. But it has not been without its frustrations. While she remains a passionate believer in the aims of the European project, she sees evidence all around her that the European Union is focusing on the wrong things.\n\n“My Europe of the future focuses on the security, freedom, and independence of its citizens.”\n\n“Coming from the Belgian Parliament, I find the workings in the EU institutions very slow,” she says. “This is so on a political and bureaucratic level. When it comes to European Parliament bureaucracy, I sometimes suspect conspiracies in order to calm us MEPs all down.\n\n“I am in love with the original EU project. But now I find the EU is engaged in overkill in legislation, and it has come so far that I am afraid the EU doesn’t see any more the difference between its core business and all the rest.”\n\nIs the European Union a failure then? Far from it, says Vautmans. Perhaps it has somewhat lost its way, but there is no reason that it can’t get back to its founding principles.\n\n“My Europe of the future focuses on the security, freedom, and independence of its citizens,” she says. “It will have its own army and will be less bureaucratic. It will be the region in the world that will be considered the standard of cooperation and democracy. We need a strong Europe which can act strong in cases of emergency.”"
