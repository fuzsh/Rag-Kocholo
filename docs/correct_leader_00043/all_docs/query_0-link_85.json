GUY VERHOFSTADT’S HOUSE, ITALY\n\nGUY SITS IN STUDY\n\nGUY WORKS IN WINE CELLAR\n\nCOMM:\n\nGuy Maurice Marie Louise Verhofstadt is a former prime minister of Belgium, he led his country in the heart of Europe for almost 10 years. But whenever he had a moment to spare, he put his two kids in the car and drove to Italy where he restored an old villa with a vineyard. Seven years ago, he started making wine, around 3,000 bottles a year.\n\n10:06:05\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT:\n\n[SUBTITLES] A politician who works, that will make an original programme!\n\n10:06:13\n\nGUY FILLS WINE BOTTLES\n\nCOMM:\n\nAs a prime minister of Belgium, Verhofstadt refined the art of compromise, working in coalitions with both the left and from the right. After 10 years in power, rather than retire, he moved to the European stage where he became one of the most vocal and passionate members of the European Parliament. The result of the Brexit referendum in June 2016 devastated him. According to his wife, Dominique, he watched the news all night and kept repeating, “It can’t be true.”\n\n10:06:58\n\nINT. GUY’S HOUSE – GUY AND HIS WIFE ARE COOKING\n\nGUY SITTING IN DARKENED ROOM, LOOKING AT MOBILE PHONE\n\nCOMM: (CONT'D)\n\nVerhofstadt and his wife have been together since they were 17. Dominique Verkinderen has her own career as a professional classical singer. The couple spend a lot of time apart, but Umbria brings them together, physically at least.\n\n10:07:15\n\nDOMINIQUE VERKINDERN: (OOV)\n\n[SUBTITLES] Where is Guy?\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT:\n\n[SUBTITLES] Here.\n\n10:07:21\n\n10:07:31\n\nBRAM DELEN WORKING ON MOBILE PHONE\n\nGFX CAPTION:\n\nbram delen\n\nspeech writer\n\nCOMM:\n\nVerhofstadt is not there, really, he’s in Brussels with his Belgian speech writer Bram Delen, they are finalising a speech on what Europe means for the Brexit coordinator of the European Parliament.\n\n10:07:36\n\n10:08:11\n\nBRAM DELEN WORKING ON COMPUTER, GUY LOOKING AT MOBILE PHONE\n\nGFX CAPTION:\n\nrome\n\nitaly\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT AND BRAM DELEN ON STREET IN ROME\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT: (OOV)\n\n[SUBTITLES] It’s not chocolate, it’s not beer, it’s not Tintin that is typically Belgian. No, it’s our love for Europe! And this is not a matter of choice. For us it is simply existential. Existential! Our country, our lands were the battlefield for Europe for too long. They all passed through here. The French, the Germans, twice, the Spanish, the Dutch, the Austrians. Religious wars, succession wars, trench wars with millions of deaths. And the first use of chemical weapons. Only Europe can save is from this misery of the past.\n\n10:08:34\n\nSTREET IN ROME – GUY VERHOFSTADT ADDRESSES THE CROWD\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT:\n\n[SUBTITLES] We show here, dear friends, that not only nationalists and populists but also Europeans who can fight back in the coming years. To keep our independence with regard to Putin, with regard to Trump, with regard to everybody who wants in fact to be a threat to us.\n\n10:08:55\n\n10:08:58\n\n10:08:59\n\n10:09:27\n\nEXT.

Directing behind the scenes he has to make sure that over 700 parliamentarians from across the political spectrum speak with one voice during the negotiations. It’s the painstaking and tedious side of democracy. His main aide and fellow sufferer is Guillaume McLaughlin. As a child of six Guillaume helped his British father and French mother, campaigned for the UK to be part of Europe. Together they put pro-European stickers on cars. Now Guillaume must help navigate Britain’s exit.\n\n10:09:43\n\nguy and guillaume work on press article\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT:\n\nYeah, um… [SUBTITLES] Nobody was against the text where it said: “This will be an unprecedented and regrettable event in the history of the EU”?\n\nguillaume mclaughlin:\n\nYeah. [SUBTITLES] Somebody said it was no good.\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT:\n\n[SUBTITLES] No, it was okay, even the word regrettable. They said: “We want to say regrettable.” I wanted to get rid of regrettable. But then they said, “No, don’t get rid of regrettable! It is regrettable!” You could start with saying: “Whereas this will be an unprecedented and regrettable event.” Full stop. Yeah?\n\nGUILLAUME MCLAUGHLIN:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT:\n\n[SUBTITLES] Yeah, do it now.\n\nGUILLAUME MCLAUGHLIN:\n\n[SUBTITLES] I’ve got it here.

Okay, change it.\n\nguillaume mclaughlin:\n\n[SUBTITLES] This is my text from last night.\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT:\n\n[SUBTITLES] But that is not important. What we decide now is important.\n\nIN:\n\n10:10:39\n\n10:10:41\n\nint. european parliament\n\nCOMM:\n\nGuy Verhofstadt had to fight hard for the European Parliament to have a role in the Brexit negotiations alongside the European Council and the European Commission.\n\n10:10:51\n\nguy addressing european parliament\n\nguy’s staff watch on monitor from office\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT:\n\n[SUBTITLES] What they are proposing is simply to say, “We go forward with the Brexit negotiations but without the parliament.” You are not aware we have to approve these arrangements at the end? Must we open separate negotiations with the British authorities? Is it that what you want? You can have that, parallel negotiations. Maybe I can quote you a famous phrase by Linden B. Johnson. He said once said: “Better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside the tent pissing in.” Maybe that’s an appropriate reality that you can relay to the European Council.

I see that Mr Davis is Secretary of State for Brexit again. In Mrs May’s cabinet, he came to see me yesterday, Olly Robbins is her right-hand man. I can’t say who it’ll be. All I can say is that as European negotiator we want a representative who is available, stable and reliable. Yes.\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT:\n\n[SUBTITLES] We can’t ask too much of the British, don’t overdo it. Elmar? Elmar?\n\nELMAR BROK:\n\n[SUBTITLES] Thank you very much. We hear all the time that because Britain is in a mess, we have to a bit to help them. That would be tactically a totally wrong situation. Tactically a wrong decision.

David Davis told me even before the first round: “We can do everything in two years, a free trade deal and the divorce.” I told him that this is technically, politically and legally impossible.

The start of the Brexit negotiations was a relief but it’s also a problem for Guy Verhofstadt and the European Parliament. Michel Barnier will now get most of the media attention. To keep the Brexit Steering Group in the picture, Bram is asked to write an article that can be published in all major European newspapers.

So we should a little bit more… Because otherwise we just put oil on the fire.\n\nELMAR BROK:\n\n[SUBTITLES] Roberto, you are partly right but not about everything. For example, it says: “It was a cold shower.” We should not delete a sentence like that.\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT:\n\n[SUBTITLES] It needs to be printed. All the newspapers need to take it. If it is not sexy as an article, they won’t take it.

If the EU and the UK cannot make a deal in 18 months, this border could become a closed border again with the threat of long queues of trucks, arduous checks of every import and export, and ordinary citizens needing a visa to travel. Without a deal, the UK risks becoming a country with the same relationship to the EU as China, Russia or Zimbabwe.

It’s fine. So the problem is a European problem. So if ever we need to reinstate checks, create a physical border, it will be the Europeans’ fault.” Another very interesting thing is that they are using the Irish border as a test case for all their borders.

There are hard Brexiteers who would leave the EU even without a deal, soft Brexiteers who want a deal that keeps the UK as closely tied to the EU as possible, and remainers who simply don't want to leave the EU.

For example it will take time to put in place the new immigration system required to retake control of the UK's borders.

The declaratory system, has to be changed and then, at the end of the negotiation, say: “It’s not the same thing anymore, so let’s change the name.”\n\nGUILLAUME MCLAUGHLIN:\n\n[SUBTITLES] But find a name that they like as well.

But maybe they will protect the children of bankers and lawyers. No, but it is an issue, and we always tell the UK: “That’s your problem that you are treating your citizens so badly and you can simply change that by treating your own citizens better.” But politically we have to see that that is extremely difficult for them.\n\n10:54:41\n\n10:54:46\n\nsteering group meeting (CONT'D)\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT:\n\n[SUBTITLES] OK, maybe we can go to Ireland, Northern Ireland now?\n\nSABINE WEYAND:\n\n[SUBTITLES] This has now become, over the last few weeks, probably the most intractable problem of the negotiations. I think that, as with all other issues, it is only the Prime Minister who, in the end, can commit the government. What we know is that, she is really very, very, very keen to have sufficient progress at the December European Council. And we are now testing how far that keenness takes her.

So, you’re happy with that?\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT:\n\n[SUBTITLES] You know that was always the request of the EU. It's not a question of a punishment, it's also a question of whatever bill is to be paid. It's normal when you leave an organisation, that you honour your obligations. It's like in a divorce.

And Davis told me that as far as Ireland is concerned, she had agreed to the text. But then they phoned Foster, because Foster had made a statement. And this statement came as a complete surprise in the meeting. So they phoned and in the end came back and said: “We need more time.”\n\n11:00:53\n\nVIEW FROM OUTSIDE THE ROOM.\n\nGUILLAUME MCLAUGHLIN:\n\n[SUBTITLES] And they didn’t expect Arlene Foster to blow up the deal?

To do so, Theresa May gathers her ministers at her official country residence called Chequers. From there she wants to publish a white paper, with the British plans for the future relationship between the EU and the UK. The disagreements in her cabinet are huge.\n\nIN:\n\n11:17:13\n\n11:17:38\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT:\n\n[SUBTITLES] OK, right, lets start this bloody shit. We could also say on Brexit we’re expecting the white paper from the British government on the 7th of July. If there are still ministers then. If they have not killed each other in Chequers. That’s harsh, eh? You’re saying that they are fighting with each other. You can do that, with a joke, can’t you?\n\nOUT:\n\n11:17:44\n\n11:18:00\n\nWOMAN 1:\n\n[SUBTITLES] Yeah, and it’s also true.\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT:\n\n[SUBTITLES] Plus it’s true.

There’s a serious debate about it going on in their war cabinet. Well, in Mrs May’s cabinet. Where there are many opposing ideas. But we know that there are two big options. The first option is the David Davis one. I saw him on Monday for an hour. It was the first time I’d seen him in three months. Perhaps he told you. Anyway, the first option is to create a kind of mini Union, between the EU, the Europeans and the UK on an equal footing. But if we are on an equal footing, each time we want to change something we have to ask whether they agree. The second option is Theresa May’s. I think I know what she wants from my talks with her negotiators. Her aim is to join the Single Market for goods only. This option is dangerous because it goes against our principle of the integrity of the internal market and the indivisibility of the four freedoms. I’d like to remind you that regarding the value of an item, a telephone for example, between 20 and 40% of its added value, on average, is connected to services or research. Or to data.\n\n11:19:57\n\nMICHEL BARNIER:\n\n[CONT] [SUBTITLES] So saying we are in regulatory alignment on goods and as for the rest, we’ll do what we want, in particular for services, that is a door that is permanently open to regulatory dumping, thanks to services, on the market of goods.\n\n11:20:14\n\nTHE MEETING ENDS.

Everybody on the continent understands that when you’re talking about the Single Market, it cannot only be the freedom of movement of goods or services or capital. But that it also needs to be the freedom of movement of people. Because there are some countries in the Single Market, who are specialised in goods. So they have an advantage of the Single Market with their goods.\n\n11:21:15\n\nGUY VERHOFSTADT:\n\n[CONT] [SUBTITLES] Some countries are specialised in services. I think that we are here in the centre, in the capital of a country that is specialised, that has a huge advantage in services. Like other countries in that Single Market because of their work force. And if you want to take out one of these elements, you destroy the concept itself of the Single Market.\n\n11:21:44\n\n11:21:46\n\nGV millennium bridge & st pauls at night. people crossing bridge\n\nCOMM:\n\nIn the end, the Chequers debate over which plan to choose for the future relationship is won by Theresa May.

That’s not difficult…\n\nMAN OOV:\n\n[SUBTITLES] You mean, to do better?

This may cause, and I am saying this cautiously, coordination problems within the British negotiation team, where clearly they were in the habit of doing things differently. On the issue with Ireland, there was a moment of extremely high tension, when Raab said: “If you don’t accept our demands in the Chequers white paper, the UK-wide solution, the cherry picking, then you are responsible for the disagreement, for no deal, and thus it is you who create borders, because we want to leave it as it is, without borders.”\n\n11:26:24\n\nMICHEL BARNIER:\n\n[CONT] [SUBTITLES] I stopped him there and told him very, very clearly: “Your prime minister Theresa May never dared say this to us, never. On the contrary, she confirmed that the UK is aware of the problems it creates by leaving the EU and the Single Market, that it is aware of tits responsibility. The idea that the creation of a border will be the fault of the Europeans is absolutely unacceptable for us. And if this is the British position, you better tell me straight away so I can inform the European Parliament and Council that discussions are over. Negotiations have failed.” He immediately took his words back, said that wasn’t what he meant. He is not always into nuances, Dominic Raab isn’t… But nuances are important in this discussion.\n\nin\n\n11:27:22\n\n11:27:24\n\n11:27:32\n\n11:27:40\n\n11:27:56\n\ndelegate eating outside building; gvs of local area.\n\nCAPTION: european parliament\n\nbrussels – belgium\n\nSUBTITLE: DISASTER\n\nSHOTS OF GUY’S OFFICES, PEOPLE DISCUSSING\n\nCOMM:\n\nIn seven months the UK will leave the EU and the risk is growing that they will do so without a deal. The Irish border has become the core problem. The EU negotiators find nothing in May’s Chequers plan that might resolve it in a way that they find acceptable. But it’s the only plan on the table.

This fiction will prevail because in the end nobody wants to get rid of the Prime Minister or the power to do so. The Brexiteers in the end, with blood on their hands, will have to go for this and we will buy it, pretending to agree, while we disagree, and everything is just theatrics to make them accept this bloody Brexit!

Everybody wants the border between Northern Ireland, part of the UK, and the Irish Republic, part of the EU, to stay open, it’s a guarantee for peace on the Irish island. But if the border stays open goods could enter the EU which might not meet European standards.

In fact, we were ready on Friday to make this agreement but it stuck on the backstop. For me there is also a strategic and tactical reason, which is using Ireland for future negotiations. Isolating Ireland, and not closing this point, leaving it open for the next two or three years. And in that case we will clearly face permanent pressure on the negotiations about trade, the Single Market, because of Ireland. And we have to be careful what the reaction will be of the European Council and the Member States.\n\n11:36:06\n\nUNKNOWN OOV:\n\n[SUBTITLES] What is your fear?

The main stumbling block, the Irish border backstop was solved by keeping Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom in a temporary customs union with the EU.\n\n11:39:09\n\nMICHEL BARNIER:\n\n[SUBTITLES] Because if you look at the national interest, and the common interest, of both sides, a free trade agreement plus the Customs Union will be the best in the long term.\n\nOUT: 11:39:09\n\n11:39:17\n\ngvs. european parliament building, strasbourg\n\nIN: 11:39:17\n\n11:39:29\n\npeople ARRIVING inside the eu parliament building\n\nCOMM:\n\nFinally there is a deal but it still has to be approved by the UK parliament and that is a problem.
