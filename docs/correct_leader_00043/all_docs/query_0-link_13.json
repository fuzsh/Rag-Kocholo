        "text": "Over the coming weeks, Euronews will be speaking to the leading candidates to take the EU’s top job after elections next month.\n\nWe have already spoken to Ska Keller, Frans Timmermans and Violeta Tomic.\n\nNext up is Guy Verhofstadt, representing the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), who will be appearing live at 16h CEST on Friday, May 13th.\n\nSubmit your questions for Verhofstadt here.\n\nWho is Guy Verhofstadt?\n\nVerhofstadt is a Belgian MEP with a long history of political activity. He graduated in 1975 with a law degree from the University of Ghent.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1976, Verhofstadt became a member of Ghent City Council. He then became the leader of the Flemish Liberal Party in 1982, at the early age of 28.\n\nVerhofstadt served as Deputy Prime Minister of Belgium from 1985-1988, and in 1991, he founded his own party, the Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open VLD).\n\nIn 1999, he was elected Prime Minister of Belgium and remained in office for almost 10 years. He made Belgium the second country in the world to introduce gay marriage and to legalise euthanasia.\n\nHe is currently the leader of ALDE for Europe and the Chief Brexit coordinator for the European Parliament.\n\nWhat does he stand for?\n\nDefending European values\n\nVerhoftsadt wants to defend democracy and equality in a time of rising nationalism that he sees as threatening Europe's fundamental values. For example, he wants to combat gender inequality, gender-based violence and sexual harassment.\n\nPrepare Europe for the future\n\nHe wants to harness globalisation and other global trends to generate growth and jobs. He is against protectionism and defends free and fair trade.\n\nBoost infrastructure\n\nVerhoftsadt wants to invest in education and make life better for Europeans by simplifying bureaucracy and introducing a fully integrated market for digital services.\n\nOppose all forms of racism\n\nVerhoftsadt believes the EU migration and asylum policies are no longer fit for purpose. He wants refugees who come to the EU to find protection. In the ALDE manifesto, liberals say they \"oppose all forms of racism, division of societies and hatred against human beings. Any form of violence against people on these grounds must be prosecuted\".\n\nOne of Verhoftsadt's measures is to financially support safe countries in the Middle East and Africa to continue hosting refugees.\n\nInnovation and opportunities for all\n\nVerhoftsadt wants to invest in research and innovation, and equip the EU's workforce with appropriate skills for the 21st century. He wants to fix our current digital divide between generations and promote education that focuses on critical thinking, entrepreneurial skills and interdisciplinary skills to fit with the current market.\n\nBuild a more liberal Europe\n\nDefend LGBTI rights, protect citizens against terrorism, organised crime and climate change, pursue innovation, make Europe more competitive and defend entrepreneurship and business are some of the measures Verhoftsadt wishes to put in place to make Europe more liberal.\n\nSocial media engagement\n\nVerhodstadt has 651,741 on Facebook, 24.3K on Instagram and 372K on Twitter.\n\nBelow is his most liked post on Facebook since 2009:\n\nOn Twitter, he got 107k likes on this post, captioned: \"Just tell us what Vladimir has on you. Maybe we can help.\""
