        "text": "14 September 2021\n\nThe digital platform of the Conference on the Future of Europe has already attracted over three million visitors â€“ more than 26,000 registered as active participants, generating 7,000 contents, and over 2,000 events attended by over 100,000 people both in person and via video conference.\n\nThese are the figures presented by Guy Verhofstadt, co-chair of the Executive Committee of the Conference on the Future of Europe, on the eve of the first meeting of the citizens' panels scheduled for 17-19 September in Strasbourg.\n\nVerhofstadt also presented the first results on the type of content that citizens have started to bring to the Conference Platform. European Democracy is the most clicked category by citizens, and the creation of truly European elections through a single EU-wide constituency in the most discussed topic.\n\nClimate change is the second most discussed topic by citizens, followed by economy, labour and social justice and, in fourth position, foreign policy and migration. The contents contributed to the Platform will guide the citizens' panels.\n\nConference on the Future of Europe"
