He became an MP and then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for the Budget whilst still in his 30s. After losing power, Guy took control of the party and reinvented it, making it more attractive to representatives of other parties. After taking time away from politics, Guy returned as president of the VLD winning the general election and becoming the first liberal PM in over 60 years. Guy retained the office for eight years before becoming a Senator and then an MEP."
