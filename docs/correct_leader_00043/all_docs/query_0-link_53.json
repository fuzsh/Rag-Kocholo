        "text": "“It’s a brave new world”\n\nWe live in a world that is becoming ever more entwined and interdependent, where companies operate across borders and national law is increasingly affected by European and international rules. The number of in-house company lawyers is growing rapidly, driven by globalization and the increasing transnational legislation that companies must apply and respect. “It’s a brave new world for all of us. One of challenges, but also of great opportunities.” Those words were spoken by ECLA’s President Jonathan Marsh on 11 April 2018 at the 2018 Reception and opening of ECLA’s new office in Brussels, Belgium.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt on the future of the European Union\n\nThe evening’s keynote speaker Guy Verhofstadt, Former Prime Minister of Belgium and Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in the European Parliament, shared his visions for the future of the European Union. Considering the high-speed globalization of the world, he strongly believes that the European Union needs to be fundamentally reformed. “Europe can only stand strong in this new world order, if we stand united, and that means: if we build up the right institutions to keep us united” – ECLA shares this view. This European association represents company lawyers all over Europe and addresses major challenges for legal in-house departments in European companies.\n\nAn opening event with prominent guests\n\nThe new office of ECLA Association Services SPRL in Brussels was opened on 11 April 2018. The event was attended by many prominent figures and offered guests an impressive program. Almost 200 participants from all over Europe attended the ECLA Reception 2018. Representatives of ECLA member associations, European politics, bar associations, law firms and various members of the European legal society were present. After a warm welcome by ECLA‘s General Manager Marcus M. Schmitt, Association President Jonathan Marsh opened the evening with a plea for the professional recognition of company lawyers. „It is high time for the EU and for governments to view company lawyers as partners, as go-betweens, and as ambassadors of EU law in the corporate world.“\n\nThe key note speaker of the evening, Guy Verhofstadt, shared his visions for the future of the European Union with those in attendance. In view of the world‘s rapid globalization, he firmly believes that the Union must be fundamentally reformed. „Europe can only stand strong in this new world order, if we stand united, and that means: if we build up the right institutions to keep us united.“"
