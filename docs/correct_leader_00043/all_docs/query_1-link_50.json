Under Prime Minister Verhofstadt's leadership, Belgium has promoted transatlantic relations and increased cooperation between NATO and the European Union. Belgium has made significant contributions to supporting democracy and security in Afghanistan and the Balkans, and is assuming a leadership role within the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, an organization dedicated to the cause of freedom. The President and Prime Minister Verhofstadt will discuss a range of issues on the transatlantic agenda, including our common commitment to working together to advance democracy and prosperity in Europe and beyond."
