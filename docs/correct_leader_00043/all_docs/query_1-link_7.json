        "text": "Liberal MEP Guy Verhofstadt will become president of the “Conference on the Future of Europe,” an exercise to consider how the EU should be reshaped, according to a deal between European Parliament leaders.\n\nThe former Belgian prime minister is to have German conservative Manfred Weber and an as-yet-unnamed socialist MEP as his deputies, several officials told POLITICO following a meeting of senior MEPs on Thursday.\n\nWhile the Parliament has taken the lead in setting out how the conference should be arranged, the European Commission and the Council are yet to provide their views on the process or the personnel involved.\n\nDiplomats have previously expressed disquiet about Verhofstadt’s suitability to lead the conference given his federalist views.\n\nAt a meeting of Parliament leaders — known as the Conference of Presidents — senior MEPs agreed to set up a five-strong Executive Coordination Board including a representative of the conservative European People’s Party, the Socialists & Democrats and the liberal Renew Europe, plus someone from the Council and Commission, according to three officials, one of whom was present at the meeting.\n\nThough names were not mentioned during the meeting, officials said the liberals and the EPP had chosen Verhofstadt and Weber respectively in advance of formal nominations. Both MEPs have been seeking senior positions after failing in their bids to become European Commission president.\n\nAccording to Thursday’s deal, the conference would be held under the “patronage” of Parliament President David Sassoli, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Council President Charles Michel, the person present at the meeting said.\n\nThe conference was proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron in March. He argued it should “propose all the necessary changes to our political project, without any taboos, not even treaty revision.” Some EU diplomats have expressed skepticism about how effective the exercise is likely to be, and are wary of any talk of changing the EU’s governing treaties.\n\nThough Verhofstadt emerged as a frontrunner for the president post, Sassoli was also said to be interested in the role. Officials said his predecessor and fellow Italian Antonio Tajani also coveted the job, although Tajani’s office denied those ambitions."
