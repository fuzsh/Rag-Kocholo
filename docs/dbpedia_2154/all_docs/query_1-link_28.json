        "text": "In our previous blog we mentioned the portrait of Duchess Hélène of Mecklenburg (Mikla Burg meaning, big fortress) in the Royal Château d’Amboise.\n\nThe portrait is there because as a close member of the French royal family she stayed in the Château on several occasions. Her husband Crown Prince Ferdinand, duke of Orléans, the eldest son of Louis Philippe, lived in the Château supervising the restoration work commissioned by his father who turned the old, cold, Château into a comfortable holiday retreat for his huge family.\n\nIt would be wonderful if one of her visits was at Christmas because Hélène introduced* the German tradition of Christmas Trees to the French Court.\n\nIt wasn’t long before having a Christmas tree epitomized the rich upper classes then adopted by the fashionable French middle class bourgeoisie. It wasn’t just the tree. The picture of a close knit happy family was also emulated.\n\nIt’s not known when the tradition entered humble homes, but the French took to the idea of decorating a spruce tree (native to France) as a symbol of Christmas. They needed one. People find comfort in rituals. Before religion was banned during and after the French Revolution, Christmas was celebrated at the Mass of the Nativity. When churches were boarded up, families decorated a Crèche, a nativity scene with the manger, baby Jesus, Mary, Joseph, and the three wise men.\n\nHélène would not have been daunted by the Court or her royal in-laws. Her mother was a royal princess, her father was a Prince and Grand Duke. She was born in a much larger, much grander château. The Mecklenburg dynasty was founded in 1167, older by far than The House of Orleans, with continuous rule until the fall of the German monarchy in 1918.\n\nAlthough she was a Protestant - the French royal family were Roman Catholics - she was chosen, like many aristocrats before and after her, for political reasons. France wanted her cousin, the King of Prussia, as a useful ally.**\n\nHélène went against the wishes of her family when she accepted the marriage proposal of Crown Prince Ferdinand because she wanted to be Queen of France. Alas it was not to be (more anon).\n\nBecause Hélène was a Protestant, the Archbishop of Paris would not allow them to be married in Notre Dame de Paris. The couple were married in two ceremonies, Protestant and Catholic, at the Palace of Fontainebleau in 1837 before moving into a huge apartment complex in the magnificent Palais des Tuileries.***.\n\nThe marriage was very happy. The couple had two sons in quick succession. Prince Philippe, Count of Paris and Prince Robert, Duke of Chartres. The portrait in Château Amboise shows Hélène with her baby son Philippe who was born in the Tuileries.\n\nFerdinand enjoyed making engravings, etchings and lithographs including political satires. An art lover, he bought works of art by the tutors who taught him landscape painting, landscapes by Corot, The Prisoner of Chillon by Delacroix and commissioned Ingres to paint his portrait.\n\nThen came a heart breaking tragedy. In 1842, the horses of his carriage bolted. Ferdinand jumped out and fractured his skull. He died a few hours later surrounded by family members who rushed to the scene of the accident. They had lost a much loved son, husband, father and brother. He was thirty-one. Hélène was devastated. His funeral was held in Notre Dame de Paris. He was interred in the Chapel Royal, Dreux, Eure-et-Loir.\n\nWhen Louis Philippe was forced to abdicate six years later, Château Amboise was confiscated by the government. Hélène appeared at the French Assembly with her son Philippe to claim his right to the throne. It was refused."
