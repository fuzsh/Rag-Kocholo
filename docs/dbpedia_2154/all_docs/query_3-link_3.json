        "text": "MEMOIR OF FERDINAND-PHILIPPE,\n\nLATE\n\nDUKE OF ORLEANS.\n\n(From Fisher's Colonial Magazine, for\n\nAugust.)\n\nFEW parallels are afforded in modern history\n\nof calamities so sudden, awful, and\n\nunexpected, as that which has befallen\n\nFrance, in the untimely death of the Duke\n\nof Orleans ; and its lamentable occurrence\n\nis one of those memorable events which\n\nincrease the extraordinary interest that will\n\none day be found, in studying and analys-\n\ning the very eventful history of this illustrious\n\nhouse.\n\nLouis Philippe, King of the French, had\n\nparticipated in the sorrows that fall to\n\nmortals, more largely than any monarch\n\nthat ever reigned in Europe; and, if princes\n\nhave destinies distinct from other men, he\n\nhas in this respect also been conspicuous,\n\nby the protection extended to him during\n\na life of the most varied adventure. It has\n\nbeen his fate to have outlived the days of\n\nJemappe, of Valmy, and of Mons, where\n\nhe established for himself a reputation for\n\nsoldiership that did honour to his race ; he\n\nhas been spared a wretched death from the\n\nassassin's hands, and reached the honoured\n\nage of seventy. So many of his years were\n\npassed in England, that, exclusive of the\n\nclose commercial bonds, and the geographical\n\nproximity that exist between these two nations,\n\nhis history is somewhat identified\n\nwith our own; and there are many yet\n\nalive amongst us who have been the cheerful\n\ncompanions of his youth. But his story,\n\nand that of his amiable family, have at\n\nthis moment, a claim still stronger on the\n\nBritish public — a claim on that sympathy\n\nwhich they have never been known to\n\nwithhold from the mourner.\n\nEducated under the vigilant and philosophic\n\ntutelage of Madame de Genlis, the\n\npresent wise ruler of the French acquired\n\nthat taste for literature which made him\n\nthe Mecænas of his country, when the decree\n\nthat banished him was reversed —\n\nthat practical knowledge that qualified\n\nhim to descend into the ranks of private\n\nlife, and secure by personal industry, an\n\nhonourable existence — those sound moral\n\nprinciples that have rendered him the admiration\n\nof Europe and of his own country.\n\nIt was not the least valuable consequence\n\nof this prince's early education, that he\n\nwas taught not only to govern, but to\n\nobey — not only to receive kindnesses, but\n\nto return them; and to this social system\n\nmay, in part, be attributed that great influence\n\nwhich he established over the\n\nminds of his children, and the foundation\n\nof that strong family affection which is\n\nnot often witnessed in royal houses.\n\nHaving passed through the most extraordinary\n\nvicissitudes that ever marked indivi-\n\ndual career — having lamented the death of\n\na fond father who perished on the public\n\nscaffold, — entombed his broken-hearted\n\nbrother, Montpensier, in the mausoleum\n\nof British kings at Westminster, — and,\n\nwatched over the death-bed of poor Beau-\n\njolais, in the sultry clime of Malta, another\n\nvictim of republican inhumanity, until his\n\nspirit fled, Louis Philippe, as it banished\n\nlord, sought an asylum in the palace of\n\nKing Ferdinand at Palermo. His sorrows,\n\nand the resignation with which\n\nhe bore them, his many accomplish-\n\nments, commanding person, and great\n\nexperience of human nature, at once excited\n\nthe respect of the Sicilian Bourbons.\n\nAfter a short residence at the court of\n\nKing Ferdinand, Louis Philippe espoused\n\nthe second daughter of that monarch ;\n\nand, at his marriage, which was celebrated\n\nin the Norman chapel of the Palazzo\n\nReale, Palermo, on the 23th November,\n\n1809, his venerable mother, the exiled\n\nwidow of Egalité, was present.\n\nAll those happy consequences that\n\nshould naturally result from an union of\n\nthe purest affection, attended the lot of the\n\nillustrious pair. The intriguing character\n\nof the Sicilian court was not congenial to\n\nthe band of Louis Phillippe, who retired\n\nwith his bride to a villa, a few miles dis-\n\ntant from Palermo, and there Prince Fer-\n\ndinand, whose melancholy fate the fond\n\nfather has lived to witness, was born on\n\nthe 2d of September, 1840.\n\nWhen the military genius of England,\n\nin the person of our gallant Wellington,\n\nhad cut short the career of revolutionary\n\nprinciples upon the plain of Waterloo, the\n\nexiled family of Orleans returned to France ;\n\nwhere, by the prudence of Louis Phillippe,\n\nhis encumbered estates were released from\n\na weight of debt, and the engagements of\n\nhis predecessor, to which he was not legally\n\nliable, fulfilled. Her age, political character,\n\nand many painful recollections,\n\nforbade the employment of Madame de\n\nGenlis, as peceptress of a second generation\n\nof the Orleans family ; but her\n\nabsence was amply supplied by one of her\n\nformer pupils, the Mademoiselle d'Orleans,\n\nwho bestowed those leisure hours not\n\ndevoted to acts of piety and benevolence,\n\nto the instruction of her nephews and\n\nnieces. But when their ages required a\n\nstronger controlling power, the Princes of\n\nOrleans were placed under the ablest\n\nscholars, but the father's affectionate care\n\nwas never withdrawn from them for a\n\nsingle moment.\n\nDuring the reigns of Louis XVIII. and\n\nCharles X., Louis Phillippe seldom appeared\n\nat court, took no part in public\n\naffairs, and, secluding himself in his splendid\n\npalace, passed his hours in the distribution\n\nof benefits to a large circle of\n\ndependents, and in the education of his\n\nchildren. His family presented a happy\n\nmodel of unity, amiable habits, and private\n\nvirtues. Himself superintending the care\n\nof his young and numerous offspring, he\n\nsaw them trained in the principles and\n\npractice of those high qualities of which\n\nhe and his benevolent Duchess had\n\nnever ceased to present the example.\n\nAs to the efficacy of his system, there\n\ncannot be more valuable testimony,\n\nif the competence of the witness be\n\nsufficient to ensure it than that which\n\nMadame de Genlis has left. \"I con-\n\nfirmed,\" says the venerable lady,\n\n\"to pay my respects to Mademoiselle\n\nd'Orleans, who is still as kind and affectionate\n\ntowards me as ever. I saw the\n\nyoung Prince de Joinville, who was only\n\ntwo years old, but who spoke as distinctly\n\nas a child of six or seven: he was also\n\nas polite as he was handsome and intelligent;\n\nin fact the whole family of the Duke\n\nof Orleans is truly the most interesting I\n\never knew ; the members of it are charm-\n\ning by their personal attractions, their\n\nnational qualities, and education, and the\n\nreciprocal attachment of parents and chil-\n\ndren.\"* A citizen of the world, one who\n\nhad so often recovered from shipwrecked\n\nfortunes, Louis Philippe appreciated justly\n\nthe advantages of a public education for his\n\nsons, as presenting an epitome of life in\n\nlater times, and, notwithstanding the re-\n\nmonstrances of the king, upon the degradation\n\nto which the blood-royal was exposed\n\nby these visionary schemes of education,\n\nthe Dukes of Chartres and Nemours\n\npursued their studies at the College of\n\nHenri Quatre and the Polytechnic College\n\nwith the most exemplary diligence. Louis\n\nPhilippe might not inaptly have referred\n\n* Wright's \" Life and Times of Louis\n\nPhilippe.\"\n\nthe king to himself, as an example of the\n\nbenefits of an extended intercourse with\n\nmankind, but with better taste he cited\n\nthe case of the great Henri Quatre, who\n\nhad himself been trained in the public\n\nschools of Bearne. No arguments, however,\n\ncould convince his majesty that any\n\ncourse of proceeding, any line of conduct,\n\ncould be correct which evidently extended\n\nthe popularity of the Orleans family ; so\n\nthe illustrious relatives parted as they met.\n\nWhen the folly and perverseness of the\n\nelder Bourbons had rendered the government\n\nnot contemptible only, but insup-\n\nportable, all France looked towards Louis\n\nPhillippe for protection against the banished\n\nrace — against the crowned heads of Europe,\n\nand even against themselves. Chateau-\n\nbriand, bound more tenaciously by grati-\n\ntude than patriotism, declared, that \"all\n\nthat he saw vacant, was — not a throne,\n\nbut a tomb in St. Denis ; but, had he the\n\ndisposal of a crown, he would lay it at the\n\nfeet of the Duke of Orleans.\" The result\n\nof the revolution of 1830, is universally\n\nknown. Louis Philippe ascended the\n\nthrone of his ancestors on the 9th of\n\nAugust, not as a dictator, but as the\n\nfounder of a new dynasty ; and to make\n\nhis meaning incapable of misconstruction,\n\nas he solemnly approached the throne, to\n\nswear to a faithful observance of the charter,\n\nhe was followed by the Dukes of Chartres\n\nand Nemours ; and when he placed the\n\ndiadem on his brow, the heir, whom he\n\nhad fondly, but vainly, destined to succeed\n\nto his earthly glories, was seated by his\n\nside.\n\nThat this sentiment was tacitly concurred\n\nin, the total abstinence on the part of the\n\nChartist Journals from any allusion to the\n\nplace allotted, de jure, to the heir apparent,\n\nstrongly proved, besides, the passing over\n\nthe Duke of Chartres, and offering the\n\ncrown of Belgium to the Duke de Nemours,\n\nis a presumptive argument to show, that\n\neven the revolutionists of Europe looked\n\non the late prince as the next in succession\n\nto the sceptre of France.\n\nBefore he had attained his twentieth\n\nyear, the Duke of Chartres exhibited that\n\npredilection for a military life, which he\n\nmight be said to have inherited from both\n\nancestral lines ; for a more chivalrous\n\ncourage never existed within the female\n\nheart, than that which animated his grandmother,\n\nthe Queen of the two Sicilies.\n\nAnd his august father had given the most\n\nunequivocal proofs of personal firmness on\n\nthe sudden assaults of danger, and of the\n\nnoblest enthusiasm in the battle field. It\n\nceases, therefore, to create the least astonishment\n\nthat the scion of such a stock\n\nshould have selected, as the theatre of an\n\nennobling distinction, the profession of arms,\n\nand sought glory chiefly \"amid the circumstance\n\nof war.\"\n\nWhen the destiny of France had again\n\ndeposed the elder branch of the royal race,\n\nwhile revolution reigned in Paris, and the\n\nthrone of legitimacy was tottering to its fall,\n\nLouis Philippe remained secluded at\n\nNeuilly, his residence, with his duchess\n\nand their children, the Duke of Chartres\n\nexcepted, who was with the head-quarters\n\nof his regiment, Joigny. As this attached\n\nand exemplary family sat around a rustic\n\ntable, on the pleasure-grounds that slope\n\nfrom the chateau to the banks of the\n\nsmooth-flowing Seine, they heard the thunder\n\nof artillery incessantly rolling ; and\n\nit was in vain that the illustrious prince\n\nendeavoured to conceal the agonies that\n\nrent his susceptible heart. His friends,\n\nhis family, endeavoured to tranquilize him,\n\nbut he turned away, exclaiming, \"No, no!\n\nI have tears and blood in my heart'. —\n\nPoor Paris ! Poor France! \" When\n\nintelligence of the Revolution reached his\n\nhead-quarters at Joigny, the Duke of\n\nChartres decided, at once, upon returning\n\nto the shelter of his father's palace, and\n\nthere awaiting the result of the struggle\n\nbetween liberty and despotism, receiving\n\ninstructions as to his future conduct from\n\nhis father. In his first determination he\n\nwas interrupted, being placed under arrest,\n\nalthough left at liberty on his parole, by\n\nthe mayor of Montrouge, — an insult\n\nwhich the young soldier never afterwards\n\ncondescended to resent. Being released\n\nby an order from Lafayette, he conceived\n\nit was his first duty to rejoin his regiment,\n\nand accordingly set out for Joigny. Upon\n\nthe heights of Melun, his carriage was\n\ncrossed by that of the Duchess d'Angou-\n\nleme, on her return from Dijon to Paris.\n\nHer Royal Highness recognised the\n\nprince, and, stopping her carriage, inquired\n\nanxiously whether he was then\n\ncoming from Paris? what was going on\n\nthere/ and where was the king ? \"Madame\n\nreplied the Duke, \"I believe the\n\nking is at St. Cloud; as for myself, I\n\ncould not enter Paris. I saw from a\n\ndistance, the tri-coloured flag floating\n\nabove all the public buildings.\" \" Where,\n\nthen, are you going?\" added the Duchess.\n\n\"To the head-quarters of my regiment, at\n\nJoigny\" \" I trust, sir, you will keep it\n\nfaithful to us ?\" \" As for that, Madame,\n\nyou may rest assured that I shall perform\n\nmy duty without apprehension of the con-\n\nsequences.\"\n\nThe election of Louis Philippe to\n\nthe throne of the French threw the\n\nhighest ranks in his profession open\n\nto his eldest son; nor could any\n\nchoice, on his part, have been more con-\n\ngenial to the feelings of a people so trained\n\nto arms as the French had been by Napoleon.\n\nAn opportunity to study the art of\n\nwar soon presented itself; the King of\n\nHolland, having obstinately persisted in\n\nendeavouring to retain some portion of\n\nwhat was geographically considered to be-\n\nlong to Belgium, threw a strong garrison\n\ninto the city of Antwerp, under the command\n\nof the brave veteran, General Chasse.\n\nIt was the inclination and duty of the\n\nFrench to aid the consummation of the Belgian\n\nrevolution ; and a larger force, furnished\n\nwith all the implements for the\n\nconduct of a regular siege, crossed the\n\nfrontier, and sat down before the devoted\n\ncitadel. Perhaps a more instructive opportunity\n\nof acquiring a knowledge of this\n\nbranch of the science was never before presented\n\nto the young soldier ; every species\n\nof line, battery, entrenchment, and mine,\n\nthat assaults require, was deliberately constructed.\n\nThe young Duke of Orleans,\n\nand his brother, distinguished themselves\n\nduring this seige, in every instance that\n\nadmitted of it nor does the silence of\n\nofficial despatches as to these services,\n\nimply that they were not entitled to the\n\nmost honourable notice. Their own sound\n\njudgment, and cultivated minds, pointed\n\nto a purer taste, and a better policy. Their\n\nlabours did not, however, pass without acknowledgment;\n\nthey could not escape the\n\nrecognition of a fond father, of a just as well\n\nas generous sovereign. In his reply to the\n\ncongratulations of both Chambers, on the\n\nhappy termination of French intervention\n\nin the affairs of Belgium, Louis Phillippe\n\nobserved, \" The time had arrived, to provide\n\nfor the execution, of treaties, and\n\nfulfilment of engagements, contracted with\n\nBelgium. The sentiments of the King of\n\nEngland coincided with mine. Our flags\n\nwere seen to wave together at the mouth\n\nof the Scheldt ; our army, whose discipline\n\nand forbearance are only equalled by\n\ntheir valour, appeared before the walls of\n\nAntwerp ; my two eldest sons shared in\n\ntheir labour and their glory.\"\n\nThis constant attendance upon his\n\nroyal father, an attention resulting from\n\naffection and duty, exposed the Duke of\n\nOrleans (the title for which Chartres had\n\nbeen exchanged) to the sword and the\n\nbullet of the assassins who contemplated\n\nhis illustrious father's fall ; but the same\n\nProvidence which reserved him for a\n\nsudden and a violent death, rescued him\n\nfrom the murderers arm. When the\n\ninfamous attempt of Fiaschi was matured,\n\nand the death intended for Louis Philippe\n\nwas inflicted upon his attendants, the\n\nhorses of the Duke de Nemours and of\n\nPrince Joinville were wounded, while the\n\nDuke of Orleans, although close to the\n\nking, and in the centre of slaughter and\n\ndestruction, escaped without the slightest\n\ninjury. A second parricidal attempt\n\nupon the life of the king of the\n\nFrench, and which his destiny\n\nagain miraculously frustrated, was made\n\nin the following year, (1836,) by the\n\nmonster Meunièr. From this the Duke of\n\nOrleans also escaped, but not quite so\n\nscatheless, a wood-splitter having lacerated\n\none of his ears at the same time that a\n\nfragment of glass entered the cheek of the\n\nDuke de Nemours.\n\nWe know not whether to dwell with\n\npleasure or with pain upon such scenes as\n\nthese ; those whose lives have been so pro-\n\nvidentially preserved, owe unbounded gratitude\n\nto the Author of that preservation,\n\nbut does not the national character sustain\n\na diminution of honour upon every repeti-\n\ntion of these homicidal attempts.\n\nFrance had succeeded in planting the\n\ntri-colour flag on the tower of Algiers, but\n\nthe haughty Mussulman submitted to the\n\ninsult with an uneasiness that did not dis-\n\nhonour his ancient martial renown. New\n\nlevies were enrolled for the Algerine service,\n\nand the agitation of the adjoining\n\nstates gave reason to anticipate a sanguinary\n\ncampaign. To a gallant and chivalrous\n\nspirit, this prospect of danger was\n\nthe lure that led him, — glory could only\n\nbe achieved by the conquest of an enemy\n\nworthy of the civilized arms of France.\n\nSailing for Algiers, the Duke of Orleans\n\nplaced himself at the head of a veteran\n\narmy, and undertook to force the passage\n\nof the \" Iron Gates,\" and take the summits\n\nof Mouzaia — places disguised by\n\nmodern names, but well remembered by\n\nthe Roman legions, whose bravery here\n\nreceived a memorable check. Its chivalrous\n\nbearing in those regions of ancient\n\nhistory, his kind and manly conduct to\n\nthe companions of his glory, however\n\nhumble, had secured for him the affection\n\nof the army, and the universal respect of\n\nhis countrymen. When the colonization\n\nof their African conquests was deemed\n\nstable, the prince returned to France, and\n\nparticipated in all the manly sports and\n\nexercises, that preserve and improve the\n\nphysical powers, and not unfrequently\n\ncontribute to benefit the intellectual also.\n\nHis figure was symmetrical, his manner\n\nfrank and courteous, and, as long as the\n\nrespect due to his rank was not violated,\n\nhis deportment was so easy, that even\n\nthose who were strangers to him, felt\n\nno embarrassment in conversation with\n\nhim.\n\nHis hours of leisure, while absent from\n\nthe army, were occasionally employed in\n\nfeats of strength and activity, and in every\n\nspecies of field and forest sport. He excelled\n\nin each, and the agility he displayed\n\nin gymnastic feats were never equalled by\n\nany of his youthful companions. Having\n\nno direct constitutional position with reference\n\nto the administration of the\n\ngovernment, he evidently kept at a distance\n\nfrom the course of its operations,\n\ncommitting himself with none of the political\n\nparties. The wisdom of such\n\npolicy is apparent to those, whose acquaintance\n\nwith modern history reminds\n\nthem of the scenes of internal discord,\n\noccasioned in certain reigning families of\n\nEurope, where the ambition of the prince\n\nhas overpowered the duties of the son,\n\nand a deplorable spectacle of filial disobedience\n\nexposed to public curiosity.\n\nTo such feelings the family of Louis\n\nPhilippe have always been strangers ; its\n\namiable members are united in the bonds\n\nof common affection, and the example they\n\npresent is as gratifying to the philanthropist,\n\nas it is beneficial to the nation.\n\nHaving seen service in Holland and in\n\nAfrica, and acquired the reputation of\n\nmilitary skill, he made a careful tour and\n\ninspection of the French possessions in\n\nAfrica, and returning by Marseilles and\n\nLyons, in a somewhat public manner,\n\nreached the metropolis of France. The\n\nincidents of this journey attracted much\n\nattention, and the conduct of the Duke drew\n\nupon him the most unequivocal proofs of\n\ngeneral approbation He threw himself\n\nfairly upon the country, freely placing\n\nhimself in contact with the community,\n\nreceiving all and hearing all. — There can-\n\nnot be a more severe and trying test, to\n\nwhich the pretensions of a public man can\n\nbe submitted, than the circumstances of\n\nsuch a tour involve. He was present at\n\nmany sumptuous banquets ; he performed\n\nthe principal part in the splendid pageants\n\nthat everywhere met him in his progress ; he\n\nreceived corporate addresses in many instances,\n\ncomplaining of the severity of the\n\nexisting laws, and supplicating his favourable\n\naid in obtaining redress ; — from this\n\nordeal he came out not only untouched,\n\nbut with the reputation of ability, and accomplished\n\nfact. In some instances his\n\nreplies had been previously considered, but\n\nmost were extempore, and displayed not\n\nonly a knowledge of the subjects to be discussed,\n\nbut of mankind, and of his countrymen\n\nmore particularly. This return of\n\nthe royal Duke from his campaign in\n\nAfrica, was tantamount to a triumphal\n\nprocession.\n\nHaving attained his seven-and-twentieth\n\nyear, the Duke of Orleans resolved to\n\nenter the married state, and had previously\n\nplaced his affections on the Princess\n\nHelena, of the House of Mecklenburgh\n\nSchwerin. This interesting, but now unhappy\n\nlady, brought to her high station,\n\nqualities calculated to adorn it. Her religion,\n\nProtestantism, might not have been\n\nacceptable to the French people, but the\n\npropriety and amiability of her conduct\n\nafter marriage calmed apprehension, and\n\ngave additional reason for admiring the\n\ntolerant mind of the Prince in the choice\n\nhe had made. She is learned in all the\n\nmodern languages, and is familiar with all\n\nthe standard English writers. The marriage\n\nof the late Duke of Orleans with this\n\nvery beautiful and gifted princess was\n\ncelebrated on the 13th January, 1837, at\n\nthe palace of Fontainbleau, and in the\n\nsplendid gallery of Henry II., the noblest\n\napartment of ceremony in Europe. It was\n\nhere, amidst the festivities that reigned\n\naround, that Louis Philippe, happening\n\nto meet Yousouf Bey, play-\n\nfully observed, \" Well, general, what\n\ndo you think of Fontainbleau?\" Magnificent!\"\n\nreplied the Mussulman ;\n\n\" I only regret that I did not bring some\n\nof my countrymen with me to France,\n\nfor, when I return, and attempt to describe\n\nthe splendour I have witnessed\n\nhere, they will not credit my unsupported\n\ntestimony.\" This union, so auspiciously\n\nbegun, was continued happily to the last\n\nhour of the prince's life ; the example of a\n\nconjugal affection, which the home of his parents\n\nhad-held out to him, had not been\n\nlost, and the private life of the Prince was\n\none of unmitigated happiness. — To the\n\njoy of France, and evident and unmixed\n\ngratification of Louis Philippe, the Duchess\n\nof Orleans gave birth to a son, the Comte\n\nde Paris, now heir apparent to the throne of\n\nFrance, in August, 1838, and, on the\n\n9th November, 1840, a second prince, the\n\nDuke de Chartres, was born.\n\nThe prospect of a direct succession in\n\nthe royal line of France was now completed;\n\nand the able monarch who now\n\nsways the sceptre of France, had the\n\nhappy and contented prospects resigning\n\nhis great trust, whenever the decree\n\nof Providence should call from this world,\n\ninto the hands of a prince, every way\n\ncompetent to preserve the peace and honour\n\nof the nation, one who had studied\n\npolitics and the art of war, a prince, who\n\nhad secured by his public conduct the\n\naffection of the people, and had attained\n\nto the matured age of manhood. These\n\nhopes, however, were not to be realized ;\n\nthis wise and valiant prince, like the\n\nyoung Marcellus, was just to be shown in\n\nearth, then snatched away. France\n\nwould, perhaps, have been too powerful\n\namongst nations, had this chivalrous\n\nprince been spared.\n\nOstendent terris hunc tantum fata, neque\n\nultra.\n\nEsse sinent. Nimium vobis Romana propage\n\nVisa potens, Superi, propria hæc si dona\n\nfuissent.\n\nIt was on the 13th of July, that Ferdinand\n\nPhillippe, Prince royal of France,\n\nhaving resolved on repairing to St. Omer,\n\nto inspect the troop, entered his private\n\ncarriage, and intending to proceed in the\n\nfirst instance to Neuilly, to take leave of\n\ntheir Majesties. Arriving at the Porte\n\nMaillot, the horses became unmanageable,\n\nand escaped up the Chemin de la Revolte.\n\nDuring this flight, the Prince attempted\n\nto stand up, but in doing so, was thrown\n\nout of the carriage, his head first reaching\n\nthe ground. The fall was fatal ; assistance\n\nsoon arrived, but the Prince never\n\nrallied; he was carried to an adjoining\n\nhouse, and every means that surgical skill\n\ncould suggest, attempted — but in vain.\n\nThe os ocsipitis had been fractured, and\n\nrestoration, therefore, placed beyond the\n\nreach of human skill.\n\n\" The news of the accident was conveyed\n\nto Neuilly. The Queen immediately set\n\nout on foot, and the King followed her;\n\nhis Majesty was to be at Paris at twelve\n\no'clock to hold a council of ministers.\n\nHis carriages, which were ready, soon\n\novertook their Majesties, who entered\n\nthem, with Madame Adelaide and the\n\nPrincess Clementine. They proceeded to\n\nthe house into which the Duke of Orleans\n\nhad been taken. It is easy to imagine,\n\nbut impossible to describe, the grief of\n\ntheir Majesties at the spectacle they be-\n\nheld. Soon afterwards, the Dukes d'Aumale\n\nand Montpensier came from Cour-\n\nbevoie and Vincennes, when Dr. Pasquier\n\nwas compelled to announce that the case\n\nwas of the most serious nature. A few\n\nwords pronounced by the Prince, in the\n\nGerman language, gave a momentary hope,\n\nbut this as quickly vanished. Marshal\n\nSoult, Marshal Gerard, the Ministers of\n\nJustice, and other functionaries arrived,\n\nand were admitted into the death-bed\n\nchamber of the royal Duke. The Chancellor,\n\nthe Prefect of Police, Generals Pajol\n\nand Athalin, with the officers of the house-\n\nholds of their Majesties and the Princes,\n\nhastened to the spot, and remained outside\n\nthe house in a space kept clear by sentinels\n\nstationed around. The King sent for the\n\nDuchess Nemours, who had remained at\n\nNeuilly, who came attended by her ladies\n\nin waiting, and added her bitter tears to\n\nthose of the rest of the family ; she found\n\nthe Queen and Princesses on their knees\n\nby the bedside, praying, and bathing with\n\ntheir tears the hands of their departing\n\nson and brother, so intensely beloved.\n\nThe King stood by, silent and motionless,\n\nwatching with painful anxiety every\n\nfluctuation in the countenance of his ex-\n\npiring heir.\n\nAt four o'clock, the Prince showed the\n\nunequivocal symptoms of departing life,\n\nand in another half-hour he rendered his\n\nsoul to God, dying in the arms of his King\n\nand father, who at the last moment,\n\npressed his lips on the forehead of his lost\n\nchild, hallowed by the tears of his afflicted mother,\n\nand the sobs and lamentations of\n\nthe whole of his family. The King then\n\ndrew the Queen into an adjoining room,\n\nwhere the ministers and marshals assembled\n\nthrew themselves at her feet, and endeavoured\n\nto offer her consolation. Her\n\nMajesty exclaimed, \" What a dreadful misfortune\n\nhas fallen upon our family, but\n\nhow much greater is it for France !\" Her\n\nvoice was then stopped by her sighs and\n\ntears. The mortal remains of the Prince\n\nwere placed on a litter covered with a white\n\nsheet. The Queen refused to get into\n\nthe carriage, declaring her resolution to\n\nfollow the corpse of her son to the chapel\n\nat Neuilly, whither she wished to be carried.\n\nA company of the 17th light in-\n\nfantry was hastily marched down from\n\nCourbevoie to line the procession on each\n\nside, and thus those brave men who had\n\nshared with the Prince Royal in all the\n\ndangers of the Iron Gates, and the\n\nheights of Mouzais, served as the escort\n\nof his now lifeless body. Several of the\n\nmen wept : all called to mind the brilliant\n\nvalour with which the Duke of Orleans\n\nhad assailed the enemy, and at the same\n\ntime the mild and delicate beneficence with\n\nwhich he had ever tempered the necessary\n\nrigour of command. At five o'clock the\n\nmournful procession moved towards the\n\nchapel at Neuilly, General Athalia walked\n\nat the head of the bier, which was carried\n\nby non-commissioned officers. Behind\n\nfollowed the King, Queen, Princess Adelaide,\n\nDuchess de Nemours, Princess\n\nClementine, Duke d'Aumale, and the\n\nDuke de Montpensier. Then came\n\nMarshal Soult and Gerard, the ministers,\n\nthe general officers, the household\n\nof the king and prince, and a\n\nnumber of other persons. The sad procession\n\nmoved along the avenue de Sablon-\n\nville, and crossing the old Neuilly road,\n\nentering the royal park, traversed its whole\n\nlength to the chapel. Here their Majes-\n\nties and the Princes and Princesses, after\n\nprostrating themselves before the altar,\n\nleft their beloved child and brother under\n\nthe guardianship of God.\n\nAt seven o'clock, M. Bertin de Vaux\n\nand M. Chomel, his royal highness's first\n\nphysician, set out for Premieres, where\n\nthe Duchess of Orleans was taking the\n\nwaters. Amidst all their own affliction,\n\nduring this disastrous day, the thought of\n\nthe deprivation sustained by this unfortunate\n\nPrincess, was never absent from the\n\nminds of her royal relations, and her name\n\nwas repeatedly invoked in their lamenta-\n\ntions. At length it was resolved, that the\n\nDuchess de Nemours and the Princess\n\nClementine, should go to her with letters\n\nfrom the King and Queen.\n\nCommandant Laru was sent off to the\n\nChateau d'Eu, to bring back the Count de\n\nParis and the Duke de Chartres, who had\n\nbeen sent there for the bathing season.\n\nOne courier was despatched to the Duke\n\nde Nemours and another to Toulon, with\n\norders for a steamer to be sent to the coast\n\nof Sicily, where the Prince de Joinville\n\nwas stationed.\n\nUnconscious of the privation she had\n\nsustained, and indulging probably in\n\nvisions of greatness and of happiness yet\n\nreserved for after life, the Duchess of Orleans\n\nremained at Plombieres, whence a\n\nletter, dated only the 11th of July gave\n\nthe following account.\n\n\" Her Royal Highness has already derived\n\nbenefit from the baths of Plombieres.\n\nShe walks out daily, and the inhabitants\n\nthough delighted to see her without attendants\n\nor guard, quietly passing through the\n\nstreets, have the delicacy to allow her to\n\npass without indulging unbecoming\n\ncuriosity. She has visited the principal\n\nshops of the place, and made several purchases\n\nof the polished steel goods for\n\nwhich the manufacture of the town is deservedly\n\nfamous. Her Royal Highness\n\nhas also been to see the Stanislaus\n\nHospital, founded by the good king whose\n\nname it bears, and expressed her satisfaction\n\nat the state in which it is kept. There\n\nis every reason to hope that her Royal\n\nHighness's health will soon be perfectly\n\nrestored. Her affability and charity make\n\nher nearly adored here.\"\n\nEvery precaution that humanity and the\n\nutmost refinement of tenderness could desire,\n\nwere practised to alleviate the overwhelming\n\nshock which such intelligence would necessarily\n\ngive to the heart of a young and affectionate\n\nwife : yet the scene of her inter-\n\nview with the messenger, whom she met\n\nupon the road, was of the most distressing\n\ncharacter. When she became sensible of\n\nher desolation, she desired to be taken to\n\nParis with the greatest expedition, \"that\n\nshe might at least be permitted to behold\n\nher husband dead, since Heaven had denied\n\nthat she should see him living.\" The\n\ninterview between the venerable parents\n\nand their children, after the tremendous\n\ncatastrophe that befel the nation — so\n\nmany renewals of the deepest sorrow, were\n\nborne by the Queen with that resignation,\n\nwhich is an evidence of her Christian\n\nfaith, and by the King with a fortitude not\n\nunlike the stoicism of Cato, under similar\n\nsorrow, and still more resembling that of\n\nour great Duke of Ormond, who declared\n\n\"he would not exchange his dead son for\n\nany living one in Christendom.\"\n\nThe remains of the late Duke of Orleans\n\nhave undergone the process of embalming\n\nand, when the body shall have\n\nlain in state at the cathedral of\n\nNotre Dame, it is to be removed\n\nto Dreux, and there interred in the\n\nvault belonging to the Orleans family. A\n\nstatue of his Royal Highness from\n\nthe classic chisel of Pradier, will be\n\nerected at Versailles, and another, in\n\na reclining posture, placed upon his\n\ntomb. We cannot close this brief\n\nmemoir, which the astounding nature\n\nof the event has called forth, without\n\nreferring to the first observation of the\n\nDuke de Nemours, when informed that\n\nthere was dreadful news from Paris ; it illustrates\n\nthe short-sightedness of weak\n\nmortals as to the progress, or even probability,\n\nof future events, and demonstrates\n\nour incompetence to form any judgment of\n\nthe ways of Providence. General Villatte\n\nundertook the delicate task of breaking the\n\nawful event to the Duke, who was at the\n\nmoment engaged in inspecting the 1st regiment\n\nof Hussars, (one of those that had\n\nserved with the Prince Royal in 1830,)\n\nbut, becoming much affected as he approached,\n\nthe Duke perceived it, and asked\n\nat once what was the matter? \"Oh, Sir,\"\n\nreplied the general, \" terrible news has arrived\n\nfrom Paris.\" \"Ah!\" said the Prince,\n\n\"I understand you; my father has been\n\nassassinated.\" \"No, Sir ; but the Duke of\n\nOrleans is no more!\" The review was\n\npostponed, the Duke left the ground, and\n\nset out almost the same moment to join his\n\nafflicted family.\n\nThe public journals of both England and\n\nFrance have done honour to themselves,\n\nby the sympathy which they have unanimously\n\nevinced for the honoured house of\n\nOrleans, and by their total abstinence from\n\nthose political considerations, which, at\n\nsuch a crisis, could only be calculated to\n\ngive pain. We quote the following paragraph\n\nfrom the Debats, because it appears\n\nto convey the general sentiments of the\n\npress of Paris, on the late melancholy occasion.\n\n\" The Royal Family has just experienced\n\na frightful calamity ; the country\n\nhas sustained an immense loss. The\n\nKing has lost the eldest of his race, the\n\nheir-apparent of his crown, the son in\n\nwhom his eldest and dearest hopes reposed,\n\nthe son who by twelve years of a devoted\n\nand courageous life had acquired the\n\nesteem and confidence of the army and of\n\nthe country. We shall not give expression\n\nto-day to the various reflections which\n\ncrowd upon us. Every word, every thought\n\nmust be restrained in presence of the\n\nprofound affliction of a family which is\n\nthe first, as it was yesterday morning the\n\nmost happy in France. We will allow\n\nthis day to pass over without giving expression\n\nto the sad thoughts which afflict\n\nall minds. We will close our eyes to the\n\nimmense chasm left by the death of the\n\nDuke of Orleans on the steps of the throne\n\non which he was so worthy to sit : we will\n\nonly think of the grief which is felt at his\n\ndeath. The Duke of Orleans was not\n\nonly a prince of a firm character, superior\n\nintelligence, tried courage, and of a mind\n\nas noble as his rank was elevated ; he was\n\nalso the best of sons, the most tender of\n\nhusbands, the most affectionate of brothers,\n\nand we say it to his glory, for it is one in\n\nso elevated a position, a most sincere and\n\ndevoted friend. The calamity which has\n\nfallen upon the royal family does not\n\naffect its most serious and noble interests\n\nalone ; it attacks its most cherished affections."
