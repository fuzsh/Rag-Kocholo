        "text": "I remember to read, some years ago, that Prince Philippe was dating a rich Brazilian girl called Adriana. It was said she was very catholic and Queen Fabiola approved the relationship. That was the only girlfriend of Philippe I read about. I think he wasn't the kind of young man who has a lot of girlfriends. He is religious and probably he wanted to wait for the right woman to have a serious relationship.\n\nAs far as I remember the girl was Adriana Torres de Silva and she was from Seville, Spain. Queen Fabiola was more than pleased with this, as the girl was catholic and Spanish, just like Fabiola was/is. The author of the text I read even stated, that Fabiola was the one who introduced Philip and Adriana, hoping in a mariage, but the couple did not cope with her wishes. I don't remember where I read this, but it was just after Baudouin died and Albert and Paola became King and Queen of the Belgians.\n\nAs far as I remember the girl was Adriana Torres de Silva and she was from Seville, Spain.

I don't remember where I read this, but it was just after Baudouin died and Albert and Paola became King and Queen of the Belgians.\n\nThanks Olka That's her name! I thought she was brazilian because the magazine said so and I memorized because \"Silva\" is a common surname in Brazil (and Portugal). But you'e very right, she is from Seville. This article (from El Mundo) says Philippe dated the spanish Adriana and Infanta Elena of Spain (I didnt know about this last one).\n\nIn Belgium there is now a book with the title \"Prince Philippe\". The books says that Mathilde was not Philippe's first love.\n\nWhen Philippe went to the abbeyschool of Zevenkerken, he became in love withe Barbara Maselis. The daughter of a manufacturar of cattlefood. It was love at first sight between the prince and Barbare. Barbara was 2 years younger, but according to the book more mature and wordly. When philippe left the school the relation beceme more serieus. Barbara was a beautiful girl, spoke 4 languages. They were a couple for 3 years. Filip regulary visited her in Roeselare or Leuven, where she shared a appartment with her sister. Barbara visited Philippe a couple of times in Belvédère, but the reception was not very warm. To comon, and that was something where the royal family was not ready for those days.\n\nUltimately it was his father who obliged Philippe to end his relation \"Jou are a prince, you have an official future. I can see that Barabara is important for you, but you will have to try to make an end at the relation.\"\n\nLater, Philippe would loose Barbara to one of his best friends. But in his head he keeps her faithful. Until he meets Mathilde.\n\nMovie with pictures of Barbara\n\nZIJONLINE VIDEO=\n\nWell, I haven´t heard aboutn those ladies, but I still have a magazine from the early 90-ties where the gossip was that he was reserved for Princess Margarita of Bourbon-Parma, so he got a lucky escape there... A totally bogus story btw. He seems to be friends to Duchess Helene in Bavaria, were there ever any rumours about the two of them being a couple?\n\nI think the name of the de Lalaing countess was Stephanie btw. I am not too sure if it was her but I remember that either she or another lady were not very discrete too the press and later it was discovered that the girl didn´t have a relationship with Phillipe at all and never had one. This story was in the late 90-ties I believe, 1997 or 1998 even. But Phillipe has always been very discrete, the engagement to Mathilde came as a total surprise (though it leaked out a day or two in advance).\n\nWell, I was able to find some information on Phillipe´s lovelife or supposed lovelife... and I might say from an unexpected source: by a book from that horrible Jan van den Berghe that I bought in 1998 (when I didn´t know any better ).\n\nHe writes down some ladies that the press say he is dating, but they note that these were just rumours: Princess Elena of Spain, Archduchess Constanza, Archduchess Isabella (Lorenz´s sister), Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, Lady Helen Windsor, Princess Bianca of Savoia-Aosta, Princess Maria of Roumania, Princess Marie-Louise of Baden, Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria, Princess Alexia of Greece, Princess Alexandra of Hannover and Duchess Eleonora Fleur of Wuerttemberg. Just gossips of course.\n\nMore serious rumours about this Stephanie de Lalaing, I was wrong about her btw as she denied these rumours in the press immidiately.\n\nThere werehowever two more serious candidates, the Italian Fiametta Frescobaldi, daughter of Marques Vittoria Frescobaldi and Marchioness Bona, the rumours started in the Italian press in 1984. Fiametta denied it, she did say that their two mothers were childhood friends.\n\nThe next candidate was Dona Adriana Torres de Silva of Spanish nobility. The Prince was photographed with her in Sevilla and Adriana went several times to Belgium where she stayed with the Counts de Brouchove de Bergeyck (now that is a last name that sounds familiar at these forums ). But the Brouchove family denied these rumours and said that Adriana was friends with their daughter Eleonore. It would have been too good to be true anyway as Adriana is also related to Queen Fabiola.\n\n---\n\nI was mixing Stephanie de Lalaing with another woman. Apparently it was Sigrid van Erp who ´promoted´ herself as the girlfriend of Filips. Sigrid was editor in chief of the magazine ´Made in Brussels´, her claim was completely ludecrace though.\n\nLooking at the list of supposed love interests of Crown Prince Phillipe, it seems that he was very particular about choosing a spouse from an appropriate social class.\n\nI agree. I think there is/was subtle pressure on all of them(Astrid, Philippe and Laurent) to marry \"well\". I read that the late King Baudouin was thrilled with Astrid and Archduke Lorenz and gave the greenlight to the union. Paola and Albert felt that their only daughter was too young to marry when she first met Lorenz but Baudouin had a real horror of what was happening in other Royal European dynasties, with the Princesses marrying below their rank, and he wanted to strike while the iron was hot, I guess.\n\nI am betting the same thing will happen with the younger generation when they start to become of an age to marry. The BRF is probably the last Royal House in Europe that still marries almost exclusively within the aristocracy.\n\nI agree. I think there is/was subtle pressure on all of them(Astrid, Philippe and Laurent) to marry \"well\". I read that the late King Baudouin was thrilled with Astrid and Archduke Lorenz and gave the greenlight to the union. Paola and Albert felt that their only daughter was too young to marry when she first met Lorenz but Baudouin had a real horror of what was happening in other Royal European dynasties, with the Princesses marrying below their rank, and he wanted to strike while the iron was hot, I guess.\n\nI know this is going a bit off topic...Didn't know where to post this...sorry ...\n\n-Does anyone how Astrid felt, was Lorenz the only boyfriend she had? Like I mean she seems to really love the job of being a mother, wife of a banker, and regular princess duties. Not trying to stir up anything.\n\n-What was the belgian attitude towards their engagement announcement?\n\n-Makes you view King Albert and Queen Poala in a new light...really modern...cared for the well being and happiness of their kids first over the familiy's 'social status'.\n\n-Wonder why they [Albert and Poala] gave in? Did Baudouin threaten Albert, that he would be taken out of the line of succession?"
