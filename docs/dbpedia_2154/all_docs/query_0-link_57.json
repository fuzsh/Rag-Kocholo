        "text": "I was wondering something. If no July Monarchy, then do the Orléans kids still marry the same people?\n\nMarie d'Orléans was desired by the king of Naples or the count of Syracuse, but as king Louis Philippe refused to give them the dowry they wanted. Here, Louise d'Artoid might be offered instead.\n\nLikewise, the Beauharnais connection in Portugal might make the Bragança infantas unpalatable to the French court (and if the marriage between Francisca and a Orléans boy still goes through, it probably won't be the third son of the premier prince du sang.\n\nAnd what's happening in Portugal actually affects three marriages of Louis Philippe's kids (Nemours, Joinville and Clémentine): Auguste de Beauharnais died in 1835, Maria II remarried to Ferdinand of Coburg in 1836, Nemours married a Coburg in 1840 and Clémentine married in 1843.\n\nWere Auguste to survive, the Coburg matches aren't so appealing. Sure, they're connected to the future Queen of England, but butterflies could mean that the Belgian Revolution is crushed or the crown ends up on someone (not Coburg)'s head - Hell, Nemours might even get it if his dad isn't busy being king of France. All in all, the Coburg-Kohàrys would be little more than German princes with large estates in Hungary.\n\nDefinitely not. The Orléans are only Princes du Sang here and not close to the main Branch. So they're not likely go get the daughters or sons of reigning sovereigns, unless those monarchs are cash-strapped. Though here they're not tainted by being the children of a revolutionary monarch, so they might get some decent matches.\n\nI can see Marie d'Orléans marrying the Conde de Siracusa. Both Henri V's mother and the Duchesse d'Orléans are Neapolitan Princesses, with Siracusa being Madame de Berry's half-sister and the Duchesse's half-nephew, so some kind of Neapolitan match would likely happen. Actually its a good pairing; both were artists, patrons and politically moderate, so they have much in common. Plus it's not a match that Marie-Thérése would likely veto, so Marie Caroline can exercise some influence here.\n\nI think your getting a little ahead here. We have an 1823 POD and there's no guarantee that Pedro I would successfully put Maria II on the throne. The French could easily send in troops to support Carlos V in Spain and Miguel I in Portugal, backed by the Holy Alliance. Louis XIX might not want to come to an agreement with the United Kingdom and unless the British are willing to put their troops were their mouth is, there's not much London can do with their navy. In my opinion, if Leopold I isn't King of Belgium, then the Coburg marriages before Victoria's accession are butterflied. He's in no position to influence the Great powers to want Coburg spouses without a Crown of his own. So we might see Louise d'Orléans as a candidate for Miguel I (though he's likely to try for an Archduchess of Austria, but with how disastrous his brother's marriage to Franz I's daughter was, IDK if Metternich would try for another Braganza bridegroom).\n\nAlso, 1823 POD. There's a slim chance that butterflies could give Adelaide a child or Victoria a bad cough that puts her in the grave.\n\nLouise married in Naples is not a bad idea (she is just a little too young for being the first wife of Ferdinand II, but can be his second easily enough as she would be just 16 at the death of Marie Christine) but freeing Louise from her engagement to Chartres would likely require Clementine as bride for the future King, something who is neither impossible or unlikely considering only Olga of Russia is better than her and Queen Marie Therese was against that match for religious reasons. The brazilian match will likely go to Nemours, Chartres can marry his OTL bride, Louise can marry Syracuse and Marie her OTL husband or they can exchange this matches\n\nHard to say who Mademoiselle ends up with as I'm not sure who came up with her unofficial engagement to Chartres. If it was Charles X then it would likely be scrapped, if never officially brought up (considered Charles is the one who made overtures to the Orléans in the first place, it likely came from him), but if it came from Caroline (also a possibility) then we'd see some infighting between her and the Queen. But I can say this; an Orléans would be Queen over Marie-Thérése's cold, dead body. She'd NEVER allow Louis-Philippe to be the father-in-law of the King. Plus Marie Caroline isn't disgraced here, instead she's the more or less designated guardian and Regent of the future King. Her opinion would be hella hard to ignore or block; Marie-Thérése might be the living saint of the Bourbons and the daughter of the martyred Louis XVI (unofficially obviously, but I know that the Bourbons wanted to make a case for Louis XVI's Sainthood) but Marie Caroline is the Mother of France and her influence can't be ignored. I think she could pull off a Romanov marriage.\n\nAs for the Brazillian marriage, as I pointed out above, that might not be possible if Louis XIX backs Miguel I of Portugal successfully. And I think Chartres can do better than a third rate niece of the King of Prussia's late wife. He's not tainted by a revolutionary father here. So maybe a cadet Habsburg or something.\n\nI can follow the logic of no Belgium, although I think in the absence of Leopold either being a king or married into the family, his various nephews might not do so well if they're only the queen of Great Britain's cousins. Victoria has her own half-siblings and half-nieces and -nephews (as well as ACTUAL prince/sses of Hannover, compared to paper royal Highnesses like her Coburg relations) that are far better proxies.\n\nHowever, that is just my opinion (especially since many of the matches the July Monarchy took OTL were matches of opportunity since very few people were willing to ally with them (hence the plethora of lesser/liberal/new monarchies (Brasil, Belgium, UK relatives) who would've not have even got a look in at the Restauration court. I mean, can you imagine how Francisca of Brasil would've been regarded by the Restauration court with her fabulous faux pas on first arriving in Paris and asking for a bowl of macaw soup. Likely she would've wound up the laughing stock of the court.\n\nAlso, would a Restauration France get involved in the Spanish succession crisis were it to happen as OTL. And on whose side eould they jump in. It's not like I could see ANYONE being willing to accept Isabel marrying Henri V (although Louise d'Artois COULD be betrothed to the Cde de Montemolin (provisionally until Isabel comes along)). And even if the French DO offer Ahmale/Montpensier, I can't see anyone making as big a stink about it as OTL - since here they'd simply be the most junior princes du sang.\n\nAnd without Louis Philippe getting the throne, the Prince de Condé might not will his fortune to Aumale, sincd(LP basically twisted his arm about it something terrible, although Sophia Dawes might still be on the scene (IIRC she was banished under Charles X, but Louis xviii liked her) and the powers that be might use her to get Condé to named Henri V as heir. Or if Condé still decides to try autoerotic asphyxiation the king might rule the death a suicide and say that Condé was mad thereby giving him reason to break the will favouring Aumale and seize the entirety of the Condé patrimony.\n\nAumale as a poor younger son would likely not be competition for Henri V in trying to marry Carolina of Salerno (both Henris courted her, but her mom urged her to go with Aumale rather than Bordeaux, since even if Aumale was a younger son, he was at least rich. Bordeaux, if he never got the rhrone back, was rather a poor man's bargain.\n\nDefinitely no Belgian revolution. The Belgians were heavily influenced by the success of the July Revolution and really only succeeded due to the French army supporting them. Here there's no initial inspirational spark and definitely no French army backing a revolution. Hell Louis XIX (and Charles X) actually wanted to restore the Revolutionary borders France enjoyed under the Republic and Napoléon, ie annexation of Belgium and the right bank of the Rhine. So if a Belgian revolution still happens we could see him try to make a deal with Willem I over a possible division of Belgium between themselves (like the Talleyrand plan).\n\nI think there's a possibility that the Orléans might be used as proxy matches for the Bourbons, but not likely. That branch made only one foreign match during the Ancien Régime (to a Margavine of Baden-Baden) and even though Maria Amalia boosted the Orléans here, they're still only a rich Cadet branch. So they'd likely get second-tier cadet foreigners, cash-strapped Sovereigns or possibly French Nobles. So a Princess of Brazil might still be on the table (depending on how the Liberal Wars in Portugal goes and if Louis XIX backs Miguel I with troops and money).\n\nI said above that it's possible that Fernando VII would produce a son instead of Isabel with an 1823 POD, so the Carlist wars might be butterflied. However, who Louis XIX would support is harder to say. Isabel II was Marie Caroline's niece and Henri V's first cousin, so the Berry faction would likely have sympathies for the Queen Regnant. However, by and large Restauration France would likely support the traditionalist lines of Carlos, Conte de Molina, although Louis XIX had a bad relationship with Fernando VII so that might influence him one way or another. I know who Charles X would support but not Louis XIX.\n\nI think Aumale won't get the Condé fortune here. OTL the Prince wanted to back out of the deal (as well as get away from his controlling mistress) shortly after the July Revolution, but he conveniently tried autoerotic asphyxiation before he could change his will and died. Louis-Philippe obviously upheld the previous arrangement and Aumale inherited everything. So likely a new will would be made leaving everything to the Duc de Bordeaux. Or maybe not; in the absence of an accepted will the Condés had no legal heirs (I've gone back to the early 1600s and can't find a surviving female line; they married into the Contis frequently but that line died in 1814), so it might go de-facto to the Crown. Also I doubt Caroline of Salerno would be considered as Queen of France, not being the daughter of a Sovereign.\n\nWait, I thought we agreed Francisca of Brasil might get Nemours? Or since Louise d'Artois is putting Maria Theresia of Teschen out of a job as queen consort, maybe said lady could end up in Paris? She was the archduchess Chartres wanted to marry (before Metternich put a spoke in that wheel) IIRC.\n\nAs to Carolina of Salerno, I only suggested her for queen of France because Henri (and his mom) was interested in her OTL. Though her being princesse de Joinville makes sense. D. Pedro might be too pro-Napoléonic for him to consider/accept Joinville (not to mention that Britain and Austria (Maria's two main backers OTL) will have a massive collective aneurysm at the thought of a Bourbon Spain+Bourbon Portugal. OTL her dad areanged her marriage to Auguste (younger brother of her stepmother), I can't see a reason why he'd go with a Bourbon instead, here.\n\nIf France backs Miguel I of Portugal successfully I think any Brazilian marriage would be off the table. Though I suppose that might depend on how long Pedro I survives; Pedro II's regency might not have an issue with marrying into the country that made sure their Emperor's sister wouldn't get her throne. An Archduchess of Teschen might be a good prospect, though I think a Tuscan bride might also work. After all, France is going to want to duel Austria for influence in Northern Italy.\n\nI think Carolina would work for either of the middle Orléans Princes. She's not important enough to get a King or major ruler, but be a prestigious prize for a third landless son of a Cadet Branch. Though she might be considered for Francesco V of Modena as well. If so Princess Adelgunde of Bavaria might be a possible bride for either Joinville or Aumale, depending on the feelings in Munich and Paris.\n\nYou know, we might also consider some Protestant marriages as well. While it would likely give Louis XIX and Marie Thérése apoplectic fits, the Orléans made three interfaith marriages under the July Monarchy (Louise to Leopold of Belgium, Ferdinand Philippe to Helene of Mecklenburg and Marie to Alexander of Württemberg) and Prussia had recently married Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm IV to the Catholic Princess Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria. So we might see some of the German Princes look at the Orléans girls as consorts or a few German Princesses as brides for the Orléans Princes.\n\nI was thinking more as eventual second husband of Maria (instead of Coburg) so after Auguste's death not before... Henry with a crown will be likely interested in something more important of a junior princess like Carolina of Salerno or marry domestical with Clementine d'Orleans who had a lot of pro: religion, ready for babymaking, without political complication, useful for stabilizing the kingdom and with a very big dowry (because you can be sure who Louis XIX and Marie Therese will force the Orleans to pay a lot for that wedding) and as cons only the fact who she will not bring any foreign political alliance.\n\nThinking well a wedding with Brazil for one of Orleans' sons in this ATL is quite forced... Instead Spain and Portugal are more logical and historical choices and in that political situation for a France who is trying to keep stable a Constitutional Monarchy with the Bourbon mainline on the throne allying with liberals in Spain and Portugal make sense... Joinville, Aumale and Montpensier are junior sons likely to stay unmarried so would be still available for this kind of political matches and reading well about Helene better exchange her with Maria Theresia of Teschen as wife of Chartres (but that would left us with two Archduchesses Maria Theresa as Duchesses of Chartres and Nemours)...\n\n@isabella, I don't know why your pushing Clémentine d'Orléans as Queen of France so hard. Such a marriage brings no advantages to France other than a cosmetic reconcilliation between the Bourbons and their junior branch. A large dowry has little value for the richest court in Europe (other than the Romanovs) and doesn't bring any foreign alliance or even domestic boost. I'm still absolutely convinced that Olga would be the best bet for the Bourbons. It creates an alliance with the largest land power in Europe, would bring France into the Quasi-existing Eastern alliance (the Holy Alliance and the Quintuple Alliance had officially lapsed but unofficially the eastern powers heavily cooperated) and would bring new blood into the Royal line. Clémentine brings no such advantages.\n\nReally both Louise and Henri were at the akward age marriage-wise. Most of the prestigious Catholics were either too old (for Henri) or married (for Louise) or too young. Why not have Louise marry Vittorio Emanuele di Savoie? He's only a year younger than her (and being the sister of the King of France, I think the Savoyard Court would overlook that minor age difference), would potentially move Sardinia into the French sphere of Influence (allowing Paris to duel Vienna for influence in Northern Italy) and is a traditional marriage (Louis XVIII, Charles X and Madame Clothilde all married into the House of Savoy). Plus I can see the French having issue with their Madame Royale/Mademeoiselle being a second bride without a chance of her children inheriting the throne if she married into the Two Sicilies. Or have Louise marry Maximilian II of Bavaria. The Wittelsbachs had long been allies of the House of Bourbon, and even though Ludwig was a Bonapartist supporter, Maximilian certainly wasn't (can't remember the book but I've read that Max hated Napoléon and attempted to refuse to serve in the Bavarian contingent in the Grande Armée). Either would be better than the Two Sicilies, which is already allied via Madame de Berry and the Duchesse d'Orléans.\n\nFor Spain as well, we're talking about a 1830 POD here. So Isabel II might end up being Fernando VIII/Felipe VI/Carlos V here. But if Isabel II still happens, she's likely to be married to a Borbón cousin, same as OTL. Louis XIX is still going to be heavily influenced by Marie-Thérése and she's never going to endorse Orléans Princes on the throne of Spain (though Portugal would be an interesting idea).\n\nSo I see this as a possible list, depending on the policies of Restauration France;\n\nPrincess Louise of France (1819) - Maximilian II of Bavaria OR Vittorio Emanuele II of Sardinia OR Juan, Count of Montizón (if his father becomes Carlos V)\n\nKing Henry V of France (1820) - Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna, Savoyard Princess (Carlo Alberto's short-lived daughter was born after our POD, so she could be healthier here) or Princess Adelgunde of Bavaria (a traditional marriage, would happen if Louise married Savoy; hopefully she's more fertile than OTL)\n\nFerdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans (1810) - Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Teschen OR Archduchess Auguste Ferdinande of Tuscany\n\nLouise d'Orléans (1812) - Miguel I of Portugal OR Friedrich August II of Saxony (2nd wife; a traditional Bourbon marriage, if Miguel doesn't remain King)\n\nPrincess Marie d'Orléans (1813) - Prince Leopold of the Two Sicilies, Count of Syracuse\n\nLouis, Duke of Nemours (1814) - Princess Caroline Auguste of the Two Sicilies (double marriage with his sister) or Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este\n\nClémentine d'Orléans (1817) - Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen, Infante Sebastian of Portugal and Spain (could also work for Louise d'Orléans) or Francesco V of Modena\n\nFrançois, Prince of Joinville (1818) - Queen Maria II of Portugal as second husband (if no successful Miguel I) OR maybe a Brazillian Princess (if Regency Brazil has no issue with such a match due to France's role in Miguel's victory)\n\nHenri, Duke of Aumale (1822) - Not sure yet; maybe same bride as OTL, Caroline of Salerno or Princess Adelgunde of Bavaria (both would also work for Joinville)\n\nAntoine, Duke of Montpensier (1824) - Infanta Luisa Fernanda, Duchess of Montpensier (if Isabel II holds the throne)\n\nWe might also consider some of the Mediatized Princely Houses or the surviving Princes étranger as spouses for the Orléans."
