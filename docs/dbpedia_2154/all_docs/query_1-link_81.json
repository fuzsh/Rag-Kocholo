He had to wait 59 years to become king. Though only 9 years, the king also lent his name to an era. The Edwardian era was distinct in its social and cultural change with a rejection of certain Victorian values. The era saw significant social mobility, reform yet also hedonism. In the words of W. B. Yeats ‘everybody got down off their stilts.' He was perhaps the final monarch to hold true political power.

In the 1630s, Oliver Cromwell raised chickens and sheep for their eggs and wool. 20 years later he was offered the crown. He helped lead an army to defeat and execute Charles I, becoming one of the most successful military leaders in British history. He now led a country that had become a republic, it had sailed into unchartered waters.

His commitment was remarkable with over 22,000 royal engagements. If Queen Elizabeth II is remembered as the greatest monarch in British history, it will be largely due to the support of her husband Prince Philip. On their golden wedding anniversary in 1997 she said, ‘Philip is a man who doesn’t take too easily to compliments, he has quite simply been my strength and stay all these years and I and his family owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim or he shall ever know.’\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nPrince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh – consort of the United Kingdom, husband of Queen Elizabeth II\n\nPrincess Elizabeth/ Elizabeth II – Queen of the United Kingdom and 15 other Commonwealth realms (1952-present)\n\nPrince Andrew of Greece and Denmark – father of Prince Philip\n\nPrincess Alice of Battenburg – mother of Prince Philip\n\nConstantine I – King of Greece (1913-17, 1920-22) uncle of Prince Philip\n\nGeorge I – King of Greece (1863-1913), grandfather of Prince Philip\n\nLouis Mountbatten – uncle of Prince Philip\n\nPrince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward – children of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip\n\nPrincess Margaret – sister of Elizabeth II\n\nPrincess Diana – former wife of Prince Charles\n\nPrince William and Prince Harry – children of Prince Charles and Princess Diana\n\nCamilla, duchess of Cornwall – second wife of Prince Charles\n\nMeghan Markle – wife of Prince Harry\n\nKurt Hahn – headmaster of Gordonstoun\n\nVictoria – Queen of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1837-1901)\n\nAccording to the chronicler Vergil, ‘Henry VII's (1485-1509) spirit was distinguished, wise and prudent; his mind was brave and resolute and it never, even at moments of great danger, deserted him’.\n\nHe was the last king to win the crown on the battlefield in one of the most significant moments in English history.
