        "text": "Tag Archives: religion\n\nMy Birthday inside Saint Louis’ Royal Chapel\n\nNovember 20, 2021\n\nNatasha knows how much I love visiting old churches, and she saved a special one for my birthday. The Sainte-Chapelle was crafted by Saint Louis to be the royal chapel inside the Palais de la Cité, constructed between 1239 and 1248. King Louis IX purchased the Crown of Thorns, pieces of the Cross, and other sacred relics from the Latin Emperor of Constantinople (these claimed artifacts had been gathered in 326 C.E. by Saint Helena, the mother of Emperor Constantine). Louis IX was making a clear statement by raising a special chapel to hold these relics in his royal palace on the Île de la Cité: Paris was stating its claim to be the center of Christendom.\n\nOn some of our walks in early days through the area, it had seemed that tourism was at a standstill due to the pandemic, but by November 20th, plenty of people were touring Paris. We had some difficulty determining which of the two lines was intended for people who already had tickets in hand, since they both seemed to be moving at a glacial pace. We spent thirty minutes in line before we could pass through the metal detectors and body scanners (much like boarding a plane!).\n\nWhen you make it through the perimeter into the courtyard, you’re standing quite close to the chapel, with its spire seemingly ascending to the heavens (in reality, the roof is 42.5 meters above ground level, almost the same as the building’s length). The photo above was composited from three photographs on a prime lens; I don’t know that a wide-angle lens would be enough to get it all in one shot. In the 14th century, the church would have been inside the Cour de Mai, and a small treasury building in similar Gothic style was next door. Today the Sainte-Chapelle sits in a parking lot; the accompanying treasury was torn down during 19th century renovation. The soaring spire of the Sainte-Chapelle has evolved considerably over time, with four different models during the royal period for France. The Revolution, naturally, tore away the spire altogether in 1793, and it remained uncrowned until Viollet Le-Duc‘s restoration (perhaps one should say reimagination) of the chapel in 1844.\n\nInside the Sainte-Chapelle\n\nBecause of its height, the Sainte-Chapelle is able to accommodate sacred spaces on two different levels. The lower level depends heavily on artificial lighting, but the gorgeously painted ceiling vaults add a lot of drama since it is not so high above the visitor. I couldn’t get over the rich colors all around. It is clear that the facility needs to control how many people can be inside at once, since there’s still a respiratory virus on the loose. I am sure that the gift shop was happy to have plenty of visitors on our day.\n\nMeredith Cohen made this chapel come to life in her 2015 book. In section 4.3, “Setting the Stage: the Lower and Upper Chapels,” she explains that at first, the lower chapel contained just one altar to the Virgin Mary. By the 14th century, however, the lower altars and chaplains had grown substantially, and the upper chapel became more and more exclusive in who could attend services there. A sculpture of “Saint” Louis the IX now stands at the southeast end of the lower chapel; I had expected to see him at Basilica Saint-Denis. His statue still shows faded colors of painted fleurs-des-lis on his tunic, but I don’t know how much of the pigment is original and how much comes from efforts to restore the original appearance. Natasha pointed to an odd smirk on his face. If this statue is the one from Mainneville, it belonged to the main minister of Saint Louis’ grandson, King Philippe IV le Bel. The Sainte-Chapelle is definitely a place where his image belongs.\n\nEven after the sumptuousness of the lower chapel, the upper chapel will certainly knock the tourist back on her or his heels. All that light! All that color! It’s like a sudden immersion in royal splendor as you exit the spiral staircase. This chapel is Rayonnant Gothic at its finest.\n\nAs we had seen at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the emphasis in royal chapels built during Louis IX’s reign was on a single open, unencumbered space (for example, there’s no metal screen separating the metal reliquary structure from the rest of the chapel). The walls of the upper chapel average 0.86 meters, frequently using iron to reinforce the stone, while the walls of the lower chapel average 1.31 meters; this reflects the fact that all the weight of the upper chapel must be borne by the lower. The “tribune” or baldachin is a metal frame at the eastern end of the chapel. Originally, the reliquaries holding the relics would have been here. The Crown of Thorns was moved around the time of the French Revolution to Notre Dame Cathedral, but it has recently been moved to the Louvre instead.\n\nTHE WINDOWS! The royal space of Saint Chapelle is a essentially a stone and iron skeleton to maximize the space for stained glass. As you might expect, the windows feature key moments from the life of Christ, particularly the Passion. I appreciated that a window features the story of how St. Helene rediscovered the relics. It’s worth noting that the artistry below those windows is also worth examination. Almost all the four-lobed paintings have been scratched to oblivion, but I liked the example I show above.\n\nI took a moment on the entry porch of the upper chapel, and I am glad I did. The post standing between the double doors was sculpted with a charming rendition of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The Sainte-Chapelle was definitely worth the wait. We descended to the lower chapel and found the exit.\n\nThe Conciergerie\n\nRather than exit to the street, Natasha and I sought the entrance to the Conciergerie, the museum part of the former Palais de la Cite (the contemporary Palais du Justice). Our ticket for the Sainte Chapelle also gave us entry to that museum. We walked across the former Court du Mai to the side of what was once the Grand’Chambre. A policeman with a carbine was guarding an entrance, but he began talking with another tourist seeking information. I turned around to spot a really lovely view of the skyline of the Chapelle. Natasha and I exited to head north on the street and then enter the Conciergerie; for this entrance there was no line at all!\n\nI had to pause on the stairs leading down from that entrance. The Salle des Gens d’Armes is a vast subterannean forest of columns and vaults. Artificial lights keep it brightly lit today, but I imagine it must have been quite smokey with torches in medieval times! We showed our tickets and COVID-19 vaccination status and were allowed to walk freely through the museum.\n\nI would subdivide the public space of the Conciergerie in two parts, one dating from the Ancien Regime (royal France) and another relating to the Revolution. The Ancien Regime shows us the Salle des Gens d’Armes, the Salle des Guards, and the kitchens. I would have loved to see the Grand’Chambre, which was crafted to be an even grander royal hall than Westminster (though I believe its space has been divvied up to different purposes). I would also have loved to see the meeting room of the Parlement, the legislature of nobility that supported the king’s efforts. These spaces were upstairs of the Salle des Gens d’Armes and adjoining Salle des Guards, respectively; you can see some photos on a history page from the French Justice ministry. Both of them, however, have been extensively remodeled in the years of Republican France to serve the judicial management of the nation. Today we get to see the basements.\n\nAs one walks down La Rue de Paris (today essentially a gift shop extneding south from the Salle des Guards), one approaches the Revolutionary part of the Conciergerie. The name “Rue de Paris,” in fact, is a reference to “Monsieur Paris,” the customary title of the head executioner of France!\n\nThe Revolutionary space of the Conciergerie reveals the dramatic change that came to the Palais de la Cite as the Revolution transformed France. The site became known as a final prison for people condemned to death. The most famous inmate to be housed there spent just 76 days in the cells, having been transferred from the tower of the Temple, where she had been housed with her family. Marie Antoinette was given a special cell adjoining the prison chapel, and today an altar funded by her brother fills that space. The chapel itself is worth a look, too; the balcony is enclosed by bars to secure inmates hearing what might be their last appeal from the church!\n\nWhen I was a high schooler, I thought the name “Robespierre” was synonymous with “if you make a mess, prepared to be caught up in it yourself.” It was a little surprising, then, to see exhibits extolling his virtues, including a statue from the 1790s. Fouquier-Tinville, who prosecuted many defendants during this period, was also extolled in his own exhibits. Because this room had many people in it, Natasha and I scuttled away quickly, but I wonder if I might benefit from a reappraisal of these two hated and loved persons.\n\nBirthday lunch and cake!\n\nNatasha and I don’t often visit the city center, and this visit gave us he opportunity to visit some restaurants that practice good allergen controls. We walked down Rue St. Jacques to reach Blvd. Saint-Germain. Very close to the intersection we found Loulou, our lunch spot, just across from the Hotel de Cluny (the temporarily closed Museum of the Medieval). It was already 2 o’clock, and we were hungry! I really enjoyed my fish and chips (their locally-made fries were particularly tasty). Natasha was very grateful that Loulou gets their gluten-free bread from Chambelland Bakery, a place we have visited on a couple of occasions. She enjoyed a club sandwich in perfect saftey.\n\nAfter lunch, we strolled west on Blvd. Saint-Germain. We paused in the little park next to the abbey, and Natasha appreciated the Art Deco memorial to the Sevres company. We walked to the park on the opposite side of the abbey, where I spent a few moments with the fragments remaining of the Lady Chapel, destroyed in the Revolution. The Lady Chapel might have been considered a close contemporary of the Sainte Chapelle we had visited early; perhaps the two even shared a master builder! I wish we could visit both as they were in their primes.\n\nWe continued west on the boulevard to reach its merger with Rue Raspail. We headed just a bit south to Rue de Grenelle for a quick visit to NoGlu, a patisserie that makes gluten-free products. I acquired a couple frosted cinnamon rolls, and Natasha found some mini pecan pies.\n\nBy that time we were feeling a bit worn from our day, and I returned us to the Rue du Bac Metro station back at the merger of Saint-Germain and Raspail. We boarded the first train south, and something I hadn’t experienced before happened. The subway train stalled, and the lights went out, before we had reached even the first station! Natasha and I surreptitiously took a seat and waited. Within five minutes, we were back on our way south.\n\nThe Basilica of Saint-Denis at last\n\nOctober 16, 2021\n\nIs it possible for a church to loom in your imagination? Ever since I started learning about French Gothic churches, Saint-Denis has been right there, at the corner of my eye. It was slightly too far for me to “accidentally” take the metro there, and it wasn’t a place that I prioritized for a weekend run with Natasha. *Something* tweaked my awareness last night, though, and I impulsively bought a ticket for my visit today.\n\nGetting to the Basilica was really easy, even if it took 45 minutes rather than 15. Our metro line 8 intersected with line 13 at Invalides, and I rode 13 to the penultimate stop. Since I was chasing a 10AM Saturday reserved time at the cathedral, the metro was not horribly busy. I was under the impression that I would emerge from the underground almost in front of the church, but I first needed to follow the brown tourist signs a couple of blocks until the church came into view. It soon became apparent why almost every modern photograph of the church looks squarely at its facade; the city hall is at right angles with the facade and far enough away that putting the two together would be quite a stretch. I didn’t see any way to get a photograph of the flank of the church, either.\n\nWhy does Saint-Denis matter? Saint-Denis was the abbey church at the tomb of France’s patron saint. In a critical era, the abbot of Saint-Denis joined forces with the King of France to enhance the prestige of the kingdom, helping to forge a national vision of France from a million competing baronies and duchies. As a result, the status of Saint-Denis was elevated above being an ordinary abbey, and it became the royal church of France. Yes, kingly coronations traditionally took place at Reims Cathedral. Saint-Denis, however, would become the final resting place for all but three of the kings. Saint-Denis was also the genesis of the Gothic architectural movement that became the prototype for building a cathedral in medieval France. Amazingly, the abbot of Saint-Denis who was responsible for linking its fate to the kingdom of France was the same person who took the bold step of rebuilding the church in Gothic style. Abbot Suger seems to have been the right person in the right place.\n\nToday, few signs of Abbot Suger remain in the church. He appears as a small kneeling figure to the left of Jesus’ feet in the tympanum over the central portal. He appears at the feet of Mary in a 12th century stained-glass window themed on the infancy of Jesus (currently undergoing restoration). He was also added to a window during restoration by Viollet-le-Duc during the 19th century; he appears as a figure in green in the much older “Tree of Jesse” stained-glass window. In architecture, we step inside the church Abbot Suger envisioned and imagine how astonished the visitors must have been at its dedication by King Louis VII in 1144 CE. The new Gothic style caught on like wildfire, and soon the Cathedral of Sens (begun 1143), Senlis (begun 1153), and Paris (“Notre Dame,” begun 1163) cemented this design as the future of French churches.\n\nPope Eugene III visited the new church in 1147 CE to see the king of France accept the Oriflamme from Abbot Suger. This battle standard was used to show the endorsement of the church for going to war. The Second Crusade accomplished little of military value other than the recapture of Lisbon, but the ceremony was an excellent launch to Abbot Suger’s standing as co-regent of France during the king’s absence.\n\nIt is a mistake to think that Saint-Denis sprang fully-formed from the mind of Abbot Suger, though. The 13th century saw the culmination of the Abbey church under “Saint” Louis IX. By 1281 CE, a new Gothic nave with a fully-formed transept was constructed, likely to a design by Pierre de Montreuil. The new nave was flanked by flying buttresses, and a new spire crowned the north tower of the church. Saint Louis commissioned a number of reclining statues of former kings of France to showcase the growing royal necropolis. He himself was entombed in Saint-Denis at his death in 1270 CE, his grave marked by a simple stone slab. By 1282 CE, however, his tomb’s reputation for miracles had led to it being protected by an iron grate and later replaced by an artistic tomb of precious metal. At the start of the fifteenth century, however, Saint Louis’ tomb was gone. The cost of the Hundred Years’ War had seen the tomb of the only royal French saint as a disposable asset. Today, you can see just two markers of Saint Louis in the basilica: a bone from his corpse stands in a gold reliquary in the Chapel of the Virgin, and a nineteenth-century painting of his death appears in the northern transept (it’s not very related to the history of his death– the Saint died of dysentery in North Africa).\n\nTo walk into the church to attend a service or just look at the colored light streaming through the windows is free of charge. Quite a lot of the church, however, is given over to the royal necropolis (particularly the double ambulatory, the transepts, and the sizeable crypt). For admission to those areas, one must buy a ticket. I could hardly describe it all, so I’ll emphasize the things that struck me the most forcefully.\n\nThe archaeological crypt would be a treasure trove for any scientist seeking to understand the historical origins of this church. Its walls and vaults are a pastiche of the early churches that occupied this area since 313 CE. I wasn’t prepared to see so many sarcophagi scattered higgledy-piggledy in this space, though. Particularly the French Revolution was unkind to the dead interred in this church; almost all the tombs are empty, with recovered royal and noble and sacred bones lumped together in the ossuary (also in the crypt).\n\nThe allure of the “Sun King” for me didn’t wear off during my sun-stroke at Versailles. Louis XIV, his wife, and his brother, all have monuments down in the Bourbon chapel of the crypt. Louis’ tomb is essentially the wall of that chapel, surmounted by an angel.\n\nI have come to admire Charles V of France (“The Wise”) for his management of the country during the early stages of the Hundred Years War (r. 1364-1380 CE). He was a builder, with a hand in the Bastille, Chateau de Vincennes, the Louvre, and St.-Germain-en-Laye. When he died, sculptor André Beauneveu produced a masterful effigy of the king for his tomb, rendering Charles V as the sculptor had known him in life. I was intrigued by the right hand of the king, seemingly passing a note to someone.\n\nFrancois I (r. 1515-1547 CE) may be popularly known as the handsome French counterpart to King Henry VIII in “The Tudors” TV series. Unsurprisingly, he had a pretty big impact on France, too! It is his Renaissance revision of the St. Germain-en-Laye palace that the heritage folks in France have decided was the right target for its restoration. Arguably, his remarkable tomb is the grandest in Saint-Denis. Up close, most visitors will get a good view of the bottom of his naked feet. If you look back at it from the higher ground of the ambulatory, though, you will see the figures of the family in prayer atop the tall structure.\n\nAs I began making my way to the exit of the church, the organist broke into a lovely fugue to prepare for a noon church service. I paused to record some of the music and pan across the lovely stained glass windows at the back of the nave. I am so grateful for my time there!\n\nStrolling Contemporary Saint-Denis\n\nI turned left as I exited the church and began sauntering down the Rue de la Legion d’Honneur. These schools were established by Napoleon I for the daughters, granddaughters, and great granddaughters of decorated soldiers. On this Saturday lunchtime, though, the street bogged down rather badly after I crossed Rue Pinel. A line of cars several blocks long was at a stand-still, and the occasional motorist tried to improve his lot by hooting and yellings. It took quite a while for the logjam to clear.\n\nI turned aside to visit the “Little Burger” chain restaurant. On a whim, I decided to try their flame-grilled “Wooper” meal. I am pleased to report it resembled a similar-sounding burger from an entirely different restaurant. On the other hand, the French Fries were dusted with paprika. I tried them, and I cannot say I disliked the change.\n\nToday many Parisiens probably think of Saint-Denis most in connection with the massive Stade de France. It can hold 80,700 people, and it is principally used for soccer (“le foot”) and rugby matches. I decided to walk down to the side of the canal for a photo. I was a little put-off by the huge number of pedestrians, bicyclists, and scooters that whizzed by me, but I got my photo. What I didn’t include is that the entirety of the concrete pier to my right (holding up a highway viaduct) was covered in a giant mass of graffiti. I only had the camera out long enough to snap my one photograph, and then I moved back into the stream of people behind me.\n\nSaint-Denis Art and History Museum\n\nIt was almost two o’clock in the afternoon, and I wasn’t sure when else I would have the chance, so I wandered to the City Art and History Museum. The facility is housed in a former Carmelite monastery that dates back to 1628; its cornerstone was laid by Marie de Medici. The city only purchased the complex for this museum in 1972; previously it had operated in the city hall or library. I think the complex is a rather special place for this museum on several counts:\n\nI have seen only a few history museums incorporate gardens into the tour, and the grounds of the monastery are lovely.\n\nWho can deny the charm of a cloister? Not me.\n\nThe ground-level galleries retain moral guidance printed in six-inch tall letters at the top of the walls!\n\nThe high dome of the chapel gives a real sense of occasion to the displays there.\n\nThe archaeology museum is notable for its displays on early stages of the Basilica, including a couple charming statues of Saint Denis holding his head in his hands (after being beheaded). I appreciated the museum’s explanations of some column capitals dating back to 1125 CE (before the Gothic basilica had begun construction). Some of the bone carvings in the area were quite cool, too, such as a bone flute from the 12th century.\n\nThe religious art in the convent did not inspire me, but I really liked some of the paintings of Saint-Denis from earlier centuries. I prefered Giuseppe Canella’s 1831 earthy painting of the basilica (see top of post) to the larger one from 1817 by Bouhot, but that may only reflect that I liked imagining livestock in the street! A cool Art Nouveau mosaic piece titled “Esperance” (Hope) was a cool complement, too.\n\nThe gallery on the Communards in the aftermath of the disasters of 1870 was hard to take in, perhaps because I entered at the end rather than the beginning. A 2006 painting by American Kevin Larmee titled “the Paris Commune 1871” commemorated the many enraged Parisians who lost their lives with their backs to a wall in the bloody aftermath when the Commune was crushed. On the other hand, Narcisse Chaillou created a charming little piece showing a young man advertising his rat-killing prowess in “le depeceur de rats” at the end of the 19th century.\n\nMy train ran off its rails as I encountered a gallery revisiting and commenting on the awful images displayed at the Colonial Exposition at Paris. I think living in Africa has made me more sensitive to the casual racism that was so common in Europe and North America a century ago. That is not to say that it has vanished in recent years. My discomfort with even a quick pass through that gallery did not leave me in a good headspace for the temporary program exhibited in several rooms of the museum: “Saison Africa2020: Un.e Air.e de famille.” The program has a very good notion at its heart: reveal the anti-colonial commitment of surrealists and other artists whose works enter into dialogue with the contemporary artistic practices of thirteen female artists from Africa and its diaspora.\n\nMy brain was slowing from five solid hours of tourism. I was determined, though, to see the interior of the high-domed chapel, standing behind a facade that one would associate with a law court instead (it even reads “Justice de Paix” on its lintel). The space was quite dark inside to make a suitable suite for large video screens, but I still collected photos of the chamber. I tried reassembling in my mind what it would have looked like for a church service, but I couldn’t really envision it. Yesterday’s church had become today’s art gallery.\n\nI was satisfied. I marched back to the metro station and headed down the stairs. It was time to head back home!\n\nJelling: markers of change for medieval Denmark\n\nSeptember 26, 2021\n\nThe other posts from this series appear in the index.\n\nI don’t believe that certain places are sacred or imbued with magical power. There was something about our misty sunrise drive to Jelling, though, that made me feel that we were about to experience a world other than our own. We had decided to visit Jelling because of its interesting description on the UNESCO World Heritage site. The monuments there represent key turning points for Denmark, in many respects marking the beginning of its national history.\n\nOur hour-long route north from Haderslev followed the E45 followed by highway 176. Once we moved to the spur roads leading to Jelling, though, it seemed that the skies became leaden, and the roads contracted. We had a magical moment as we passed through a tunnel of greenery, with tree branches meeting above us. I have taken to calling these “Fairy Tunnels,” because Natasha and I love them. Within minutes, we had arrived at Jelling.\n\nIt’s not really possible to become lost in Jelling, a town of fewer than 4000 people. We parked on Mølvangvej and walked about a block to the Jelling Mounds site itself. You can be sure we would have loved to see the Kongernes Jelling Museum (“Jelling of the Kings”), but it only opened at 10AM, and we had a wedding to attend in the afternoon!\n\nThe pagan monument (mid-10th century C.E.)\n\nThe monument at Jelling began as a royal burial. King Gorm and Queen Thyre are the first royal family for Denmark for which we have really strong historical sources. The northern mound at Jelling is believed to have been created at the time of Queen Thyre’s death. When it was excavated in the early 20th century, the mound contained a beautifully crafted silver cup that has come to define the “Jelling Style.” [The cup image at the top of this post came from the National Museum of Denmark.] The body of Queen Thyre was not there, though. It appears she was moved to a different burial chamber during the Viking Age, perhaps at the time of King Gorm’s death.\n\nThe ship and the mound are not the only parts of Queen Thyre’s memorial, though. King Gorm recorded this testament in runes upon a large stone at the site (though it was probably moved from its original location): “King Gorm made this monument in memory of Thyre, his wife, Denmark’s adornment.” It’s a beautiful inscription, but it has historical significance, too. This is the first time the name “Denmark” appears in a written document from that country! I want to take a moment, by the way, to recommend the excellent chapter on Jelling by Steen Hvass in The Lives of Prehistoric Monuments.\n\nThe Christian monument (late 10th century, C.E.)\n\nWhen Gorm and Thyre’s son Harald came to the throne, Denmark was to experience profound changes. King Gorm had done quite a lot to unify Denmark under himself, but his hostility to Christianity had caused him to demolish churches in his wars, and that caused him to run afoul of the German King Henry the Fowler (no, I could not resist that pun). As king, Harald continued his father’s mission of unifying Denmark (and Norway), but he also spread his mother’s appreciation of Christianity.\n\nKing Harald Bluetooth contributed a second magnificent carved stone to the Jelling Monument, with writing on one face and lovely images on the other two. Originally, it was painted with bright colors (definitely take a look at this recent replica). This side shows a large animal locked in battle with a snake.\n\nThe second image side is remarkable for being the first image of a crucifix known from the part of the world (see the color version for better contrast). Where Gorm’s stone arranges its runic text in vertical columns, Harald changed his text to represent the left-to-right ordering of Latin text. It reads, “King Harald commanded these monuments to be made in memory of Gorm, his Father, and in memory of Thyre, his mother— that Harald who won the whole of Denmark for himself, and Norway, and made the Danes Christian” [this and the previous translation come from Steen Hvass].\n\nJust as Ozymandias makes a proud but vacant boast in Shelley’s poem, Harald Bluetooth makes a boast at Jelling that lasted less long than he might have liked. The king was greatly distracted by a rebellion led by his son, Sven Forkbeard. His son was so successful in his revolt that Harald was driven from Denmark and died in exile.\n\nThe church at the Jelling Mounds lies directly between the two mounds. While the church site has been preserved since the late 10th century, the current limestone structure probably dates from around 1100 C.E., though with significant changes after a 17th century fire. A burial chamber beneath the church might have been the final resting place of Gorm and / or Thyre.\n\nSadly, Natasha and I didn’t get the chance to see the mural work within the church, just as we missed seeing the museum. We did enjoy a stroll around the site, though; the Mounds site has a nice walking trail that allows one to beat the bounds. I really appreciated that they’ve added a nice little stairway for tourists to reach the top of the southern mound. There’s another stairway off to the side that King Frederick VII used to ascend to its halfway point during the mid 19th century. Tourists don’t use that one.\n\nNatasha and I enjoyed the atmosphere of Jelling, but we needed to get back to Haderslev to get dressed for the wedding. We walked into the Super Brugsen grocery in hopes of finding something gluten-safe to eat. Surprisingly, we found some of the best options we’d seen since leaving Copenhagen (Natasha recommends the broccoli salad)! Jelling receives two thumbs up from these tourists.\n\nThe Major Basilicas of Rome\n\nThe first post of this series will link to all our adventures in the city.\n\nFor someone who grew up Southern Baptist, like me, understanding the complex hierarchy of churches within the Catholic tradition can be a bit bewildering. Having visited the Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican during my 1994 tour, I was aware of that church as a particularly special one. What I hadn’t realized was that three other churches in Rome have nearly the same stature (in one case even greater stature)!\n\nOur opportunity to visit two of these churches came on our first full day in Rome. We spent the time before lunch at the National Roman Museum, and then we paused for a delicious lunch at La Mela D’Oro, right by Saint Mary Major. We were delighed to discover that people with celiac disease can find safe food at most restaurants in Italy. The food culture of Italy makes it particularly important not to force people to eat separately from their friends and family.\n\nPapal Basilica of Saint Mary Major\n\nAugust 28, 2021\n\nOur first view of Saint Mary Major was from the Piazza dell’ Esquilino. I’ve grown accustomed to the French Gothic style from our months in Paris, and I’ve come to expect a high central nave with some flying buttresses and maybe a couple of towers. Saint Mary Major looks nothing like that. From the northwest, one is looking at the apse, a curved structure that comes at the top of the choir, the farthest part from the main entrance of the church. The middle part of the church is not particularly high; instead, we saw two domes rising on either side, each marking substantial side chapels of the church.\n\nI was even more confused when I saw the southeast facade of the church. A fountain and a high column stand in Piazza di Santa María Maggiore (the Italian name for the church). A two-level colonnade comprises the loggia or “porch” on the main entrance of the church, with a high campanile (bell tower) appearing to the right. We are far, far away from a “look” like Notre Dame in Paris! I felt so confused about the church exterior that I wondered if I was going to be disappointed.\n\nTo enter the church instantly dispelled that worry. The Saint Mary Major interior just blew me away. The wood ceiling gleams with gold, and these pair well with the mosaic art appearing in the apse. The current church structure was consecrated in 434 CE; St. Mary Major had been standing for seven hundred years when Notre Dame in Paris was begun! Naturally, it has been substantially upgraded over time; the golden ceiling was a relatively late addition, reflecting the increased availability of this metal after colonization efforts in the New World.\n\nThe mosaics, by the way, are probably the most unique work of art housed by the church. Many date from the fifth century CE, with twenty-seven of the original forty-two still in place. Some of the heavy hitters of the Renaissance are represented there, as well. I hoped to see Michelangelo’s Sforza Chapel, but it was unavailable for photos. Natasha and I both remarked at the rather modern stained-glass window in the main entrance.\n\nWe paused in the Borghese Chapel to look at the fine decoration of the space and to look upwards at one of the two domes we had seen from the outside. The icon painting at the heart of the chapel seems a bit confusing to me. I have seen enough Eastern Orthodox icons to recognize one when I see it, but what is it doing in the heart of a key Roman Catholic church? I was really interested to learn of its incredible longevity. It was part of an anti-plague procession by Pope Gregory I (590-604 CE) and was restored by the Vatican Museums in 2017. If this is indeed the same painting from the sixth-century procession, it would pre-date the split between eastern and western churches by 464 years!\n\nI am including an image of a gilt angel holding a stand for candles in the Capella Sistina Presepe opposite the Borghese Chapel so that it won’t feel left out. When even the candle holders are this sumptuous, every step is an aesthetic treat.\n\nWhen we left the Borghese Chapel, we noticed a little stairway leading down below the high altar (marked by four high and wide columns). I loved the prayerful statue of Pius IX, but I was unsure what the little reliquary he faced represented. When I looked it up later, I realized that this was the relic par excellence for this church; it purports to be boards from the manger in which Jesus was born.\n\nPapal Basilica of Saint John Lateran\n\nAugust 28, 2021\n\nIf you have reached Saint Mary Major, it’s a pretty easy walk to reach another church of special significance. The Via Merulana will lead you directly to it! Natasha and I strolled down the road hand-in-hand. Merulana felt very much like a Parisian street, with businesses on the ground level and housing above. Paris would regulate that the first levels are all uniform heights off the ground as well as a high degree of uniformity in the colors and materials of the facades. In Rome, each buildng was its own beast, appearing in a riot of colors. We had to cross the Viale Manzoni, a substantial highway, but soon enough we had reached our goal.\n\nSaint John Lateran is the only “Archbasilica” in the world. The church is considered supreme in this way because it is the church presided over by the Bishop of Rome, a.k.a the Pope. The “Lateran” part, by the way, refers to buildings on the lands of the Lateranus family of the Roman Empire. When they lost their lands to Emperor Constantine, he re-gifted them to the Catholic Church in 311 CE. The first Christian Church on this site was in place by 324 CE. This makes it the oldest basilica in the world! That said, the church has burned a few times, so the current structure may not share any “bones” with the old.\n\nAt first we tried to enter by the facade presented ot the end of Via Merulana, but that loggia is not open to visitors. We followed the road around to the east. During that walk we passed the Scala Santa, claimed to be the stairs that Jesus had to climb to reach the Sanhedrin, relocated to Rome by the mother of Constantine. The devout are allowed to climb the stairs only on their knees. We continued onward to the eastern side of Saint John Lateran to find its main facade to the world, with majestic columns. We passed through its massive bronze doors, perhaps even the ones originally crafted for the Roman Senate.\n\nThe interior of Saint John Lateran was another story. A church approaching 1700 years of age should look pretty ancient, right? The interior, however, was heavily remodeled in the seventeenth century by Borromini, creating a series of arches lining both sides of the nave, each with a saintly figure at roughly double life size. The riot of color that we saw at Saint Mary Major was very different than the serene monochrome of Saint John Lateran. The ceiling, on the other hand, was richly worked with the colorful insignia of the pope.\n\nAs usual, Natasha had spotted several things I missed. I lost sight of her for a moment and then found her inside a side chapel with an aged tile floor. She pointed out signs of use in the floor; these mosaics tell a story of many generations of faith. I was happy to see several elements representing the early days of the structure throughout, and a trip to the restroom revealed an opportunity to look upward into the ancient timbers and stone of the structure without the layers of art masking them.\n\nThe part of the church that most appealed to me artistically, however, were the mosaics and frescoes surrounding the altar of the church. The apse is particularly beautiful.\n\nI was curious about a small wooden madonna. After a bit of a web search, I learned that this was a gift to the Lateran by Pope Francis. Though I wasn’t a fan of the nave in this church, the church had quite a few elements of beauty throughout. I think Natasha and I would have enjoyed a walk in the thirteenth-century cloister, too, but we were both out of energy from our busy first day.\n\nWe returned to the outdoors and admired the view of the old city wall. I really liked a bronze statue group in a little park there, and the exposed artwork of a chapel on the courtyard before the Lateran also caught my eye. We struggled to discern which side of which street we needed to be on in order to catch a bus back to our neighborhood, crossing first this way and then that before realizing we needed to wait on an island separating lanes heading north to catch bus 81. The return trip gave us an enviable view of the Colosseum!\n\nPapal Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls\n\nAugust 30, 2021\n\nI had never heard of “Paul Outside the Walls” until I read a book on medieval art. It extolled the church built atop the presumed tomb of Saint Paul, and I was determined that I should see it myself. Because Natasha was ready to get back in the shade after a sunny morning, I made my way down to the church on my own, taking the line B train south from the Colosseum. Someone was playing a hammer dulcimer for donations. When I emerged aboveground, I was in an entirely different part of the city.\n\nThe church was close to the train station, and I navigated a sidewalk sale of fabric to reach the abbey behind it. I couldn’t enter the abbey since it was closed on Mondays. The sun was beating down, and nobody was around, making me worry the entire complex was simply closed for business. I came to the bell tower and the eastern facade of the church, and again it appeared to offer no access. Had I come down here for nothing?\n\nWhen I reached the “quadriportico” at the northwest corner of the complex, everything changed. A few military vehicles were present, and the soldiers reported that yes, the church was open as usual. I found the entrance between the quadriportico and a coffeeshop with building fragments in its garden. Unlike some of the other sites, I was waved through without someone even screening my backpack. There were very, very few visitors at the church for the entire time I was there.\n\nSaint Paul’s Outside the Walls is a really ancient church. Paul’s followers erected a memorial at his grave, and it gained a church under Pope Sylvester in 324 CE. A much grander basilica had to wait until 386-402 CE. The church complex was fortified to survive raids by the Saracens in the 9th century, but an earthquake in 1348 CE damaged it extensively. The repaired church was mostly unchanged for a few centuries but then was immolated when a workman repairing its lead roof in 1823 started a fire. The Church decided to rebuild the church essentially as it had been, but the project took quite a while, with many tasks remaining at the reconsecration of 1854.\n\nAt first I thought the nave was roped off for a service, but then I realized the entrance was from the side instead. I entered, admired the wooden model of the church dating from the 19th century rebuild, and just gazed around the beautiful space for a few moments. It was very quiet inside with three or four people seated and roughly the same number of apparent tourists. I lingered for longer than strictly necessary, just soaking up the atmosphere.\n\nSuddenly I realized that the exit door was actually a transition into the space behind the altar (where I had been able to see such beautiful spaces in the earlier two churches. I realized that the space beyond the arch was really large in St. Paul’s, with chapels and magnificent mosaic work all around. For me, the apse mosaic was simply enchanting.\n\nThe high altar of the church, however, was always lingering in my mind. You see, it’s built right above Paul’s sarcophagus. This historical figure who played such a key role in creating a Christianity that opened itself to gentile and Jew alike was buried right there. It was all a bit overwhelming to me.\n\nThe church is reputed to have a magnificent cloister, dating to the 13th century, but it was closed. An architecture walk downstairs was open, for the low price of just 1 euro. The site did a good job to depict the settlement that attended Paul’s burial site during medieval and early modern times. Their use of hanging strings to represent column positions along the entrance walk for the medieval basilica was rather evocative and beautiful.\n\nPapal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican\n\nSeptember 2, 2021\n\nIn retrospect, it’s clear that scheduling our visit to Saint Peter’s after our visit to the Vatican Museums meant we would be on the low-energy orbit of the massive church. Natasha and I had a lovely lunch at “A gogo gluten-free” near the Ottaviano subway stop and then strolled down the road of the same name to the square before the church. In walking through the curved colonade to enter the square, it felt like an emergence from the city into a monumental space (besides crossing a national boundary, since the Vatican is not Italy).\n\nWe baked in the sun for a few moments and took silly photos of ourselves near the Vatican Obelisk (it has a less-distinguished history than the Lateran Obelisk). Just how did we want to experience St. Peter’s? Did we want to join the line for the cupola? Well, the line would take time, and neither of us does well with heights and vertigo just now. Instead we looked for the shorter line to enter the basilica at ground floor. The most common reason people were turned away was not for security but rather for wearing clothing that was judged too revealing for a sacred place (such as bare shoulders). Natasha and I were through the lines very quickly; most of our time was just walking through the baffles to reach the point of entry.\n\nI was glad we could pause just after entering the church, because I wanted to gaze at Michelangelo’s Pieta. I couldn’t see a good option for an up-close photo due to glass reflections and tourist elbows, but I stood back a bit a bit and switched to my telephoto for this image. It is a striking work of art.\n\nThe nave of St. Peter’s seems far more gargantuan than the other major basilicas. It’s not just that it’s the longest and widest nave of the four, but its arched ceiling rises higher above above its floor than the flat ceilings of the other structures. Given that its capacity is listed at 60,000 people, the church felt as though it was quite empty even with maybe a thousand tourists running around. I appreciated that railing prevented the clueless (me) from crossing the aisle into an area good Catholics would avoid.\n\nGiven how I plotzed over the tomb of Saint Paul above, you might think I would be equally enamored of the tomb of Saint Peter. Oddly, I find that I get less excited about him because his church is so overwhelmingly popular among tourists to Rome and the Vatican. For the high altar to be scaled appropriately to the volume of this massive church, though, the 17th century baldachin in bronze reaches almost 29 meters in height (almost 95 feet). Many aspects of this church changed in the 16th century, since “Old Saint Peter’s” (pictured above in the schematic accompanying the Saint Paul’s Outside the Walls section) was replaced by the present structure during 1506 through 1626 CE. Considerable artistry has gone into making this space effective for a huge number of people to celebrate mass together.\n\nNatasha and I both enjoyed a little pause at the apse, the farthest point from the entrance. Bernini’s 17th century “Cathedra Petri” draws your eye from quite a large part of the nave, with the light shining through the dove’s window representing the Holy Spirit. The sculpture also serves as a reliquary, though, since the chair below that window and supported by the Four Doctors is traditionally held to be the Chair of Saint Peter (though even its oldest parts apparently are not older than the sixth century). We loved the artistry of it all.\n\nFrom there, Natasha and I took the stairs down to the Vatican Grottoes. While photographs are not allowed, the Vatican has made photographs available from the linked website. The grottoes are not cave-like at all, and it’s a really pleasant visual break if you are feeling dazed from immeasurable spaces and gilt all around you! We walked out into the sunlight, blinked our eyes, and set course for our home-away-from-home. The most magnificent churches on earth had made their mark on us both.\n\nRouen Cathedral: layer upon layer\n\nOf all the words I have learned in the past few years, “palimpsest” is definitely the worst. Try saying it out loud. In my mouth, it has the same awfulness as “moist.” Just the same, the meaning of the word is useful: we frequently see the materials of a past work being reused to serve a new purpose. Rouen Cathedral is one of the best examples of architecture that preserves in its structure many different layers of design across the centuries.\n\nTimeline\n\nBecause the Rouen Cathedral has occupied its present site for approximately forever, I felt this timeline, adapted from La Cathédrale de Rouen; sauvetage – restauration, 1939-1955 with some additional details from Kevin D. Murphy, would help put it in context.\n\n1037 CE: Reconstruction of the church begun by the archbishops Robert and Maurille. Dedication in 1063 CE. From this church are preserved the crypt and sculpted capitals.\n\n1145: Continued work at the cathedral, attested by a letter from Archbishop Hughes.\n\n~1180: Construction of the lower parts of the Saint-Romain tower and the Saint-Jean and Saint-Etienne portals of the current facade.\n\n~1185: Demolition and rebuilding of Romanesque nave to follow a Gothic design.\n\n1200: Fire in Rouen and the Romanesque cathedral.\n\n1200-1220 approximately: Construction of the Gothic nave\n\n~1220-1230: Construction of the Gothic transept and choir, on older foundations.\n\n1275-1300 approximately: Construction (by master builder Jean Davi?) of the portals of the Calende and the Library.\n\n1302-1320 approximately: Extension of the chapel of the Virgin, under archbishop Guillaume de Flavacourt.\n\n1370 and after: Work on the “flamboyant” western facade under the direction of Jean Perier and Jean de Bayeux, who died in 1398.\n\n1407-1421: Completion of western facade decoration and the Saint-Jean portal.\n\n~1430-1460: Repair of the high windows of the church.\n\n1469-1477: Complementation of the crown of Saint-Romain tower by Guillaume Pontis; construction of the Library and its staircase.\n\n1485-1508: Construction of the Tour de Beurre.\n\n1508-1514: Reconstruction of the large western portal.\n\n1514: Fire of the spire of the lantern tower and fall of part of the choir vaults.\n\n1523-1544: Construction of the new wooden spire.\n\n1562: Sack of the cathedral by the Protestants during the Wars of Religion.\n\n1683: A hurricane (!) devastates the facade of the cathedral.\n\n1730-1780: Transformation of the choir: altar, new rood screen.\n\n1792-1795: French Revolution destroys metal objects (lead, brass, part of the old Treasury).\n\n1822: Fire in the spire of the lantern tower and part of the attic.\n\n1829-1876: Construction of the cast iron spire, designed by Alavoine.\n\n1884: Demolition of the 13th century rood screen.\n\n1894-1910: Main restoration work by Sauvageot, then by Chaine.\n\n1928-1935: Excavations discover the Romanesque crypt.\n\n1940: Partial fire in the attic.\n\n1944: Bombing, fire and partial destruction of the cathedral.\n\n1945-1956: Consolidations, excavations and general restoration of the cathedral by A. Chauvel.\n\nIt should be apparent from the above that the cathedral represents many plans, builds, destructions, and restoration all layered atop each other. Given that the contemporary cathedral stems from foundations laid in the eleventh century, it’s worth remembering that Duke William of Normany conquered England in the Battle of Hastings in 1066 CE. As a result, Normandy was entering a period where it mediated the relationship between France and England. The Catholic parish was not the only religious organization in Rouen, either; the Abbey of Saint Ouen was just a short walk away, and the archbishop and the abbot sometimes entered violent conflict with each other!\n\nThe other addition to the abbey text is the account of the riot of 24 august 1073, which has become, in the well-known words of Michel de Boüard, ‘un incident héroï-comique souvent narré’. The riot began after archbishop John, who was supposed to conduct the feast day mass of St-Ouen, arrived at the abbey late and found that proceedings had started without him. Clearly feeling that his jurisdiction had been undermined, the archbishop flew into a rage. Excommunicating the monks on the spot, he drove the officiating prelate, the abbot of St-Martin de Sées, from the altar, placing him under an interdict. He then began to celebrate mass himself, but was interrupted when someone offended by his behaviour began to ring the monastery bell. The individual responsible for the interruption then ran to the square, and shouted that John was trying to take the relics of St-Ouen back to the cathedral, which was untrue. Upon hearing the rumour, however, the people of Rouen took up arms and entered the abbey, where they attacked the archbishop. The cathedral clerks and St-Ouen monks then began to brawl, and the whole situation only dissipated with the arrival of the local vicomte. A council was convened in Rouen by the duke to examine the dispute, and William ordered that the archbishop pay a fine of 300 livres for his actions against a ducal abbey, and reconcile himself with St-Ouen. The archbishop’s rage was so great, however, that he refused, and the task was eventually entrusted to Michael, bishop of Avranches (1068–94).\n\nRichard Allen. Chapter 4 in Cathedrals, Communities, and Conflict in the Anglo-Norman World.\n\nIn-Spiring and Towering\n\nThe two towers flanking the western facade of the cathedral each have their own stories to tell. The north tower, Saint-Romain, is considerably older than the other. Tour Saint-Romain (named after an early bishop of Rouen) was constructed at the start of the 13th century, though its top floor was only completed in the 1478. This tower, paid for with chapter funds, was begun as the church made an abrupt shift toward gothic stye from Romanesque; the dedication of the Basilica Saint-Denis in 1144 CE turned many heads to the new Gothic style. If you approach the cathedral from the Horloge, this tower will be the first to come into sight.\n\nGuillaume Pontifs, who had just completed the Tour Saint-Romain, then continued his efforts by constructing the Tour de Beurre (“Butter Tower”) in a completely different style. If your only exposure to Gothic churches is to have seen images of Notre Dame in Paris, you might not realize that it’s a bit unusual that the two towers come as a matched pair. Chartres, Saint-Denis, and many other Gothic cathedrals have rather different styles in their two towers (and of course some may omit one or both towers flanking the facade). The Tour de Beurre won its fun-to-say name through an unusual funding measure. The church agreed to accept money from parishoners who wanted to continue eating dairy products during Lent. With a very motivated master builder, the construction of the Butter Tower was completed in only twenty-three years.\n\nTo say that the restoration of the cathedral spire after an 1822 fire was controversial is a significant understatement. Jean-Antoine Alavoine resolved upon constructing a new spire from cast iron atop the lantern tower, a technology unavailable to the medieval architects. When Alavoine died in 1834, the project was woefully incomplete, and for a time criticism by influential restoration architect Viollet-le-Duc nearly killed the forward progress. Marshal MacMahon curried favor with the Rouennais by throwing support behind its completion, and the spire was in place by 1875. Its spire made Rouen Cathedral the tallest building in the world, replacing St. Nicholas Church in Hamburg. The record stood until Cologne Cathedral was completed in 1880. In 1884, the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. swiped the crown. Only five years later, the Eiffel Tower nearly doubled the height of the Washington Monument!\n\nLibrary\n\nThe same Guillaume Pontifs who had built the Tour de Beurre was also asked to connect the northern transept of the cathedral to the library. Both the Abbey of Saint-Ouen and the Cathedral of Rouen acquired manuscripts for their libraries throughout medieval times, and yet multiple fires in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries eviscerated these collections. The chapter library constructed after 1398 CE by Jenson Salvart at the cathedral is substantial at 35 meters by 8 meters (sadly, though, we did not get to visit). The 1479 CE stairway to the library by Guillaume Pontifs is so gorgeous as to make one pause. He was responsible for the first two flights; the upper levels were added in 1788. This library gained a new function as the printing press made significant inroads in the early fifteenth century.\n\nWilliam the Conqueror, Richard the Lionheart, Philippe-Auguste, Jeanne d’Arc, and Claude Monet.\n\nI wanted to highlight five famous people who had a brush with Rouen Cathedral. William the Conqueror, of course, was the Duke of Normandy who crossed the English Channel to fight in the Battle of Hastings, founding the short-lived House of Normandy line of kings. Just three years before he launched his invasion of England, though, Duke William attended the consecration of the Romanesque cathedral at Rouen in 1063 CE. Today’s cathedral may look very different than the one back then, but the footings are still there!\n\nWhen Richard “the Lionheart” I died in 1199 CE, the Crusader King had gone to war against a town called Châlus in central France. His body was separated into pieces for interment, and a lead box containing his heart was placed in the crypt at Rouen Cathedral. The box was rediscovered during excavations at the cathedral in 1838 CE. In 2013, scientists investigated the dust into which the heart had decomposed.\n\nPhilippe-Auguste was the king of France in 1204 CE who reabsorbed Normandy into the main body of France. He chose the in-construction cathedral for his solemn procession. By this time the Rouen Cathedral had made its abrupt turn toward Gothic design, so the nave or choir might already have shown something like their modern elevation. Philippe-Auguste was an inveterate builder (such as the walls of Paris), so he would probably not have been dismayed by scaffolding and construction dust!\n\nThe Joan of Arc museum is directly behind the cathedral, in large part because she was subjected to questioning in the archbishop’s palace. She was only nineteen years old in 1431 CE when she was burned to death at the old market square in Rouen. The cathedral honors Jeanne the Maid by hosting a chapel in her memory.\n\nClaude Monet is the Johnny-come-lately of this group. In 1892 CE, the innovative artist set up his canvas to paint the facade of the cathedral for the first image of his Rouen Cathedral series. In 1895 he would choose his favorite twenty paintings from this series for his exhibition. For anyone with a love for Impressionism, seeing the facade of this cathedral in person will ring bells of memory!\n\nThe Devastation of War\n\nTo visit Rouen Cathedral is to join a long tale, winding through history. I am grateful that the extraordinary damages of World War II were restored! To close, I would like to translate a few sentences from Le Maho and Carment-Lanfry:\n\nMade up of such diverse contributions, Rouen appears as the most alive, the most human of all cathedrals; like a human being, in fact, she was born from an upwelling of love. Like a human being, she has been shaped by life, transformed over the ages while remaining deeply the same. Though she has known great joys and glorious hours, she has not been spared trials. She came out purified, embellished, nobler to have suffered and to know how to stand.\n\nLa Notre-Dame Cathédrale de Rouen, pp. 289-290, by Jacques Le Maho and Anne-Marie Carment-Lanfry\n\nChartres Cathedral: a paradise of stained glass\n\nAugust 24, 2021\n\nI have tried to avoid becoming one of “those tourists,” people who march directly from the train to a tourist site, snap lots of photos, and then step directly into traffic without looking. When my opportunity to visit Chartres arrived, I scheduled myself half a day in the town. Unfortunately, my cell phone decided that the morning of my trip was the right time to refuse connection to the mobile network. The “Oui” app from SNCF wouldn’t show my ticket QR code! As a consequence, I slipped back an hour in my departure for Chartres. The train, departing from Montparnasse, took a little more than an hour to cross the distance, but it feels like a bigger difference in environment, since one can live in Paris for months without seeing anything like agricultural land!\n\nI decided to follow Avenue Jehan de Beauce away from the train station rather than walking directly to the cathedral. I was pleased to see that it soon gained a pedestrian-friendly Esplanade de la Résistance on its east side. Its “chemin de memoire” explained several memorials along the path, with maps to attractions like the Fine Arts Museum. The Broken Sword monument was notable for celebrating the life of Jean Moulin (French Resistance) and remembering those lost in the concentration camps of World War II. It appears opposite the Médiathèque L’Apostrophe, housed in a beautiful Art Nouveau building from 1926 by Raoul Brandon.\n\nA massive plaza right next to it had picked out “#Chartres” in 3D letters in front of an admirable vista of the city’s cathedral. I stopped instead to photograph Sainte-Foy, an old church of solid composition, even if it were much less impressive in size. During World War II, the crypt of this church was used to protect some of the materials from Chartres Cathedral from bomb strikes.\n\nI wandered for a little while, both because the streets were far from a north-south / east-west grid and because I had some difficulty getting my internal north pointed in the right direction. The plazas and historic buildings seemed to stretch in every direction, and it appeared that business was booming despite the never-ending pandemic. Before too much time had passed, I had circled the cathedral to approach from the south. Given how much larger it is than most other buildings in Chartres, one can generally find it by entering a plaza and looking up.\n\nEncountering Chartres Cathedral\n\nI first heard of Chartres when I was a little boy (and yes, I was small for quite a lot longer than my age-mates). My primary or middle-school teacher was trying to explain medieval times to the class. She showed us a videotape dramatizing the construction of a cathedral as a multi-generational task; almost no people alive to see the cornerstone placed would survive to see the nave completed, let alone the choir, the facade, or the never-ending towers. Chartres began construction in 1145 CE. It wasn’t the earliest of the Gothic churches; that honour usually goes to Basilica of Saint Denis, which completed its Gothic nave and choir during 1135-1144 CE, or the Cathedral of Sens, which broke ground in 1135 CE and had a completed nave in 1164 CE.\n\nChartres was distinctive in part because of a disaster; a fire in 1194 forced reconstruction of its nave and choir. The key elements of Gothic architecture (pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses) had been established long since through experimentation at places like Saint-Pierre de Montmartre and Saint-Martin-des-Champs. Chartres would integrate these elements for substantial elevation of the structure, integrating a trio of rose windows with enormous clerestory stained-glass and sculptures throughout the church. Chartres Cathedral inaugurated the “High Gothic,” and it has been honored as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nI was quite surprised by the stark contrast between the inside and outside. At present, the exterior wears its 800 years with a combination of crumble and corrode. The inside, however, is light and airy throughout the nave (but again one sees a contrast between transept and nave since the side areas have not completed restoration).\n\nThe ongoing restoration has performed its everyday miracle on the wall of sculpture separating the choir from the ambulatory, with just the last scenes from the 17th century life of Jesus still dark while the rest gleams in white.\n\nMy interest in Chartres stems from my interest in stained glass; unlike almost every other Catholic Cathedral in France, the original panes are still in place for the great majority of its fantastic collection, and almost all were created in the 12th and 13th centuries CE. One frequently hears that stained glass windows played a role in communicating stories from the Bible to a largely illiterate population. While that is true of Chartres, these beautiful “vitraux” also extend to the lives of saints and even to historical figures. I would not have expected to see Thomas à Becket and Charlemagne featured in their own windows, but there they were! I was also interested to see that the creatures of the zodiac made an appearance, plus four animal heads were grafted to the pulpit.\n\nI loved the little touches that showed that different sectors of the Chartres community had contributed to its construction. I snapped an image of cobblers making shoes in the corner of St. Stephen’s window.\n\nThe veneration of Mary is obviously going to feature in a church called Notre Dame, and I loved the famous window in “Chartres Blue” that celebrated her. The 15th century carving of her (see below) was much smaller than I had expected, but its magnificent frame was something special. I did not visit the extensive crypt; I am unsure whether the public is allowed to see the reliquary housing the veil of the virgin that made the site such a draw for pilgrims at the millenium before last. I found a couple treasures at the gift shop, one for me (a mousepad with the pattern of the famous labyrinth from the floor of the cathedral) and another present for my mother-in-law.\n\nUpon exiting the cathedral, I spent some moments at the south porch; I had already seen its interior, with an enchanting set of windows showing prophets perched on prophets’ shoulders. The exterior, however, features a beautifully sculpted depiction of the last judgment. I have decided I rather like this subject for art ever since I first used Hans Memling‘s depiction in a slide for my biomarkers class, using it to explain dichotomous classifiers. In any case, the side of the Chartres sculpture showing those judged unworthy of heaven is delightful, with very naughty-seeming demons dragging their charges to hell. One demon has clasped the ankle of a woman, and her hair trails behind them on their journey. I am convinced that the creativity and whimsy of artists is what sets apart one work of art among others of the same topic.\n\nWhy did Chartres manage to retain these priceless windows and sculptures when so many other churches were destroyed in the Revolution (Lady Chapel of St. Germain-des-Pres) or World War I (Rheims Cathedral) or World War II (Rouen Cathedral)? The Historic Monuments Commission / Fine Arts Commission agreed to remove the windows from Chartres Cathedral for remote storage during World War I and World War II (this story is told in more detail in Saving the Light, by Victor A. Pollak). The cathedral itself was greatly endangered in the course of World War II. The American Army resolved to destroy it, believing the cathedral was being used as an observation post by German forces (the town of Chartres had become a logistics center for the Germans occupying France). Colonel Welborn Griffin objected to this order, volunteering to determine whether or not the cathedral was playing a military role. He shines as the hero of Pollak’s book.\n\nCentre International de Vitrail\n\nI decided to visit the Centre de Vitrail, just north of the cathedral, to learn more about the creation and restoration of these images. My attention was arrested at the entrance to the centre by an apparently well cared-for fluffy grey and white cat. I rested my hand nearby, and she stretched her paw out to touch my finger! I stroked her head for a few minutes, and all was right with the world.\n\nBecause the museum opened only at 14:00, I popped over to a restaurant for some lunc. While the Centre offers its flossy brochure only in French, the descriptions on the walls are offered in both English and French (just a few are French-only). I particularly appreciated their glossaries of uncommon terms, as they apply to stained glass:\n\nStop-gap\n\nGrisaille\n\nFoliation\n\nApse\n\nCartoon\n\nJewelling\n\nSilver stain\n\nCarnation\n\nColoured through the Mass\n\nAfter a while I became aware that the building I was visiting had many of its historical “bones” on display. I could see up into the rafters, and its modern art display in the cellar was staged in a decadent Gothic backdrop, with ribbed vaults throughout. The Centre provides maps for a great many of the Cathedral’s compound windows, so it is a great way to understand the details of a given story told in glass.\n\nAvignon, refuge of Popes and anti-Popes\n\nWhen our TGV to the south approached Avignon on June 12, my first sight of the Palace of the Popes caught my breath. I had last seen the structure in 1994 from a train in the middle of the night, but with my brother Tom in town, I would finally get my chance to see the Palace up close. He and I had already invested a morning wandering around the Roman theatre at Orange, so we paused for an ice cream lunch in the Place du Palais.\n\nWhat an impression that square creates in a visitor’s mind! The builders of the fortress knew how to project power. If I could start the story at the end, though, I think it’s really interesting that the Place du Palais itself was created in 1398 by Rodrigo de Luna. He was no architect; he was the military commander under (and nephew of) anti-Pope Benedict XIII, and he destroyed the buildings before the Palace to make its entrance easier to defend from a siege of French mercenaries. The plaza is ground zero for tourists in Avignon, so I was grateful for some elbow room!\n\nBut I am getting ahead of myself. Why did the pope decide to move his court to Avignon from the Vatican? Several reasons seem to have been in play, many of which relate to French King Philippe IV “le Bel”. King Philippe levied a tax against French clergymen, and Pope Boniface VIII wrote a bull proclaiming that all kings were below the Pope’s authority and excommunicated King Philippe. French thugs conspired with northern Italians to capture Boniface VIII at Anagni in 1303, to treat him quite roughly, and to pillage his treasury; the Pope died a month later, making it clear that Italy was not a safe refuge. King Philippe needed money for his wars and decided to smear the Templars so he could appropriate their wealth; his desire for an accommodating Pope caused French cardinals to forestall any but a French candidate for the papacy.\n\nAvignon Popes and Palaces\n\nI rather like the caricature shorthand for the seven Avignon Popes that Edwin Mullins included in his book: “Puppet, Miser, Monk, Emperor, Bookkeeper, Saint, and Humanist.” I know that serious scholars of the medieval would scoff at its rigor, but the book is at least memorable!\n\n“Puppet” Clement V: The Archbishop of Bordeaux was chosen to become Pope Clement V even though he wasn’t a cardinal. As was characteristic of the Avignon Popes, he was trained in canon and civil law, heralding a period when the papacy would have more powerful administration than before. Immediately upon his election, however, Clement V must have realized that his independence as pope was pretty limited, since King Philippe compelled him to be coronated in 1305 on French soil at Lyon. After a stint at Poitiers, the papal court came to Avignon to take advantage of its being in papal lands of Provence, an area that was not integrated into France until the French Revolution. At the start of the 14th century, Avignon was essentially a village, certainly without grand housing for wealthy cardinals, but the court of Clement V “made do” without a palace; he frequently visited the countryside rather than creating a stately residence in Avignon itself.\n\nSo did Clement V manage to achieve any independence? He attempted to deflect King Philippe’s efforts to take Templar property and execute the knights (for example by making it a church trial rather than a royal one), but ultimately he could not stop the king from burning the Templar leaders at the stake. True, the Avignon Papacy was not in France proper, but the fact that the papal court was just across the river from France gave King Philippe greater international prestige. A great storm was building on the horizon, though. It was clear even before the reign of Edward III that England and France were on a collision course, so being closer to France gave the Pope more opportunity to intervene in the Hundred Years’ War.\n\n“Miser” John XXII: The second Avignon Pope put the church on a sound financial footing during a time of significant growth for Avignon. Cardinals built two early structures in the city during his reign: the “Petit Palace” (1318-1320) which now houses an art museum and the “Livrée Ceccano” (begun before 1331) which now houses the municipal city library. I wish I had known enough before our visit to see the two!\n\nOne of the factors I found most intriguing about John XXII was that he became something of a bête noire to William of Ockham (who popularized parsimony in his philosophical writings). John XXII is also notable for having canonized St. Thomas Aquinas.\n\n“Monk” Benedict XII: As a Cistercian monk, Jacques Fournier served as an Inquisitor who burned the last of the Cathars in southwestern France. It is this austere pope who first constructed a monumental palace at Avignon, today labeled the “Palais Vieux.” Mullins describes this structure as a “bastion” or “fortress,” but its purpose was to house church business, bringing the archives from Italy, treasury, and administrators under one roof. The old fortress receives considerably less attention than the new on the Palace tours, but my brother Tom and I did shoot a little video in its courtyard to explain the Popes’ move to Avignon for his students.\n\nAs we move forward with the most imperial of popes, I think it is worth saying that the most influential of writers from this period were mad as hell at what they saw the Papal Court becoming in Avignon. I would refer you to Petrarch and Dante…\n\n“Emperor” Clement VI: Ruling during 1342-1352 CE, Clement VI gets the lion’s share of the glory for the Avignon Popes. The monies that John XXII had brought to the treasury were spent heavily by Clement for his “Palais Neuf,” which transformed the structure from an forbidding keep to a resplendent mansion and a grand church in its own right. He also added substantial gardens to the back of the complex.\n\nClement VI brought parades to the streets of Avignon and majestic receptions for visiting royalty. Italian banks opened major centers in the city, today remembered by a bas relief on the opposite side of the Place du Palais. Clement also made a key appointment in launching a military effort under Cardinal Gil Alvarez Carrillo de Albornoz to repacify the Papal States of Italy.\n\nClement VI’s term as Pope would seem a great success except for a little public health problem called the “peste noire;” the Black Death had come to France. A Genoese ship sailing from the Crimea brought rats to Messina in 1347 CE. Those rats were infested with fleas, and the fleas were infected with Yersinia pestis. Two to eight days after an infected fleabite, a victim’s lymph nodes would swell to the size of chicken eggs before he or she died. This, the first appearance of this plague in Europe, killed an astonishing number of people throughout the continent, striking down as much as half the population of cities. Naturally, the people of Avignon wondered if the sumptuous living on display at the palace was being answered by a sign of disapproval from God…\n\nWalking around the Palais Neuf of Clement VI, the luxury of his life is apparent even if many of the hand-painted room interiors have been lost through aging, chipped away by soldiers who used the structure for a barracks, or otherwise defaced. The path through the palace is quite a maze, really. Rather than having a single linear progression through all the rooms, a tourist makes lots of choices along the way. Do you want to see the gardens? The treasury? The kitchens? All of these are spurs to the main tour.\n\nFor me, the highlight is the Chambre du Pape, or the Pope’s bedroom. Vexingly, photographs are disallowed inside painted rooms (both walls and ceilings) such as this one. Yes, even if your camera doesn’t have a flash. Yes, even if it’s just your cell phone. Happily, I was able to find some archival images over at the French Ministry of Culture. I loved the theme of an indoor forest for the Pope’s bedroom, and the little birds that one can find in each curl of branches are charming. I had less love for the Chambre du Cerf, the Pope’s private study next to his bedroom. The hunting and fishing scenes tell us of the love for these sports among the nobility of the fourteenth century, but they have been marred by the ravages of time.\n\nThe palace has two small frescoed chapels and a gargantuan nave for large-scale masses. The smaller chapels are right on top of each other in the aptly named “Tour des Chapelles.” Chapelle Saint-Jean celebrates two eponymous saints (John the Baptist is a different person than John the Evangelist). The Chapelle Saint-Martial celebrates one of the first bishops in France, active around the year 250 CE. Matteo Giovannetti crafted lovely frescoes of his life for this chapel in 1344-1345, and he completed the set for Saint-Jean during 1346-1348. I didn’t really feel that we got a good look at these works during our tour, since one cannot really linger inside the chapel (and one of them was closed off from visits).\n\nThe Grande Chapelle is on a completely different scale from the smaller chapels. Very few of its original frescoes remain in place, but its vaults are still beautiful. In the 19th century, the nave served as a storage depot for government archives. The stairway leading down from the chapel has a magnificent look onto the courtyard below, effectively the space enclosed between the old and new palaces. The area had temporary construction underway to erect banks of seats for a concert or recital. I wonder how echoey those walls will be!\n\nI really enjoyed our visit to the Palace, though I did feel that the building has a great emptiness to it. Relatively few spaces have exhibits in place, and there’s no period furniture to help us imagine how these rooms would function. The tablet audioguides that they issued us at the entrance, however, were pretty cool in that they could show us animations of some rooms superimposed over the walls and floors we were navigating. I liked their little historical vignettes, too.\n\n“Bookkeeper” Innocent VI: As a former professor of law, Innocent VI was known for his prudence and sobriety. The ongoing party that Clement VI had started had come to an end, the papal coffers emptied of their gold. Despite the new austerity, Innocent kept the pressure on the Papal States of Italy by funding Cardinal Albornoz’s military campaign there. In some cases, it was possible to turn warlords’ loyalties by bribes more inexpensively than by military action.\n\nA temporary lull in the Hundred Years’ War meant that many unemployed men were lingering with sharp weapons. A substantial army of these “routiers” came to Avignon under Arnaud de Cervole. Innocent paid the routier forces a substantial fee to abandon the castles they had occupied in papal lands. When the “Free Companies” came to Avignon under Albert Sterz, Innocent used a slightly different strategy, taking some of the forces in employ for winning back control of the Papal States in Italy. Naturally, establishing better walls around the city gained priority.\n\n“Saint” Urban V: Under the penultimate Avignon Pope, the moribund effort to return to the Vatican seemed to have been underway once more. The former Benedictine abbott expanded the palace gardens further and continued the city wall project, but his heart was set on returning to Rome. Cardinal Albornoz’s efforts had finally stabilized Italy enough that the papal court could return.\n\nOn October 16, 1367 CE, the returned papal court was received rapturously by the city of Rome. A representative of the Eastern Orthodox faith was there to discuss a future where the two branches of Christianity could re-unify [If you are sensitive to naughty language, don’t click that link]. The problem, however, was that the Eastern church needed military forces to accomplish that. The two largest military powers in Western Europe, England and France, were not willing to send armies east while they were busy killing each other wholesale in France. On September 24, 1370, Urban re-entered Avignon with his court. The Hundred Years’ War was raging once again, and now the Papal Treasury was empty from the expensive moves between cities. Urban died on December 19, 1370, not even three months after returning to Avignon.\n\n“Humanist” Gregory XI: It could not have hurt his prospects that Gregory XI was the nephew of “Good Times” Clement VI. As yet another civil and canon lawyer, he had familiar training to that of the previous Avignon Popes. Although he had inherited Urban’s sense that returning to Rome was the proper course, his French cardinals were much happier to have returned to their comfortable lands and palaces in Avignon and its environs, and King Charles V, one of the most capable of medieval French kings, continued his opposition to the papal court leaving Avignon. On the other hand, Saint Catherine of Siena rallied him: “Forward! Finish what you have begun!” In the end, the growing instability of the Papal States in Italy (1375) seems to have been the spur required to begin the move back to Rome. On January 17, 1377, the papal court once again took up its role in the Vatican, and the Avignon Papacy came to an end.\n\n… and the Anti-Popes\n\nOR DID IT? Gregory XI’s death in the spring of 1378 brought about the election of Urban VI on April 8, 1378, the first Italian Pope since the unbroken string of Frenchmen that spanned the Avignon Papacy. Much as I enjoyed Mullin’s treatment of the Avignon popes, I feel he was off-base in his portrayal of Urban VI as essentially a paranoid tyrant. Wouldn’t you feel betrayed if the same French cardinals who had been part of the conclave that elected you then vanished to another city and named one of themselves as Pope? That said, even the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia says, “If the first days of Urban’s pontificate were unhappy, his whole reign was a series of misadventures.”\n\nAnti-Pope “Clement VIII” naturally gravitated to the recently vacated papal palace at Avignon. He claimed that he was simply awaiting the death of “crazy” Urban VI to become the Pope for all Christendom, but when Urban VI died in 1389, it became clear that Clement VIII did not have legitimacy outside the parts of Europe that had already acknowledged him.\n\nClement VIII’s successor, “Benedict XIII,” had suggested that if elected as (Anti-)Pope, he would resign if the other Pope would resign so that a single Pope could lead Christendom. When the French king tried to get him to honor that pledge, however, Benedict XIII gave him the cold shoulder. That explains why the French king sent an army of mercenaries to start a siege at Avignon (and that’s when the palace gardens demonstrated their worth)! The wily Benedict XIII snuck himself out of his own palace in 1403. In 1409, the Western Schism was brought to an end when both popes were deposed and Martin V began his rule.\n\nAvignon is a beautiful city with lots of fun spaces to enjoy, and the Palace of the Popes brings together history and fascination in a really unique combination. I hope one day that I can return with my favorite historian!\n\nLegacy of the Templars and the Benedictines in Paris\n\nNortheastern Paris offers two sites with immense religious heritage that are all but invisible today. I would like to step back in time a few centuries to the heydays of the Saint-Martin-des-Champs Priory and the Old Temple Quarter, just a few blocks southwest of Place de la République. What has become of these ancient sites?\n\nMy first chance to wander through the Temple Quarter came when my big brother Tom visited Paris last month. He wanted to see parts of the city that related to the French Revolution, and so we planned a bit of a saunter through the northeastern area of the city:\n\nPlace de la République, which hosts an admirable timeline on its monument for the chief events of this period,\n\nthe Temple, which served as a prison for the royal family before their executions,\n\nthe Carnavalet Museum, which tells the history of Paris with great coverage for the revolution period, and\n\nthe Bastille, which was the site of one of the Revolution’s most dramatic events.\n\nThe Temple Quarter\n\nThe Temple Quarter takes its name from the Knights Templar, a Catholic organization founded in 1119 CE to protect pilgrims on their way to and from the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem after the city was captured during the First Crusade (1099 CE). The initial home of this order was on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, but the knights were compelled to move their headquarters repeatedly when Jerusalem was recaptured by Muslim armies under Saladin in 1187 CE. Generous gifts of land and money fueled the growth of the Templars, and their 1139 CE settlement in the marshy area to the northeast of Paris’ city hall (“Marais” means “marsh”) rapidly transformed it into a rich farm, supported with windmills just outside the Porte du Temple.\n\nWhen the Latin Kingdoms of the holy land were lost, the Temple Quarter became a European headquarters for the order. The Temple Quarter had considerable autonomy, as the Templars were not accountable to the King of France. That was acceptable to Philippe Augustus and to “Saint” Louis IX, but it was not to Philip IV “the Fair” (r. 1285-1314 CE). In 1307, he arrested the leaders of the Templars and subjected them to torture and trials. When the last of them were burned at the stake in 1314, the pyre was apparently at the western point of the Île de la Cité, near Place Dauphine. The Temple Quarter then became a home for the Knights Hospitallers, ironically a rival branch of Catholic knights from the Crusades. Over time, the Temple Quarter shifted from farmlands to the urban landscape shown in the maquette above.\n\nI would highlight two buildings of this complex. The palace of the prior, constructed by François Mansart in the 1660s, was the large building at the lower left corner of the maquette shown above. A horseshoe-shaped court draws attention to the building. At first, however, it was surrounded by gardens, as in the 17th century engraving below by Israel Silvestre.\n\nThe donjon of the Temple, dating to the 13th century, made the most lasting impression on the citizens of Paris. As we saw at the Bastille, small bumps mark the outline of this tower on the pavement in front of the city hall for the third arrondissement of Paris. Because the royal family was held here before their execution in the French Revolution, it became a site of pilgrimage for royalists. That was intolerable to Napoleon I, so he ordered its destruction in the first decade of the 19th century.\n\nOn our walk through the Temple, we paused at the Church of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, just across the street from the former Temple Enclosure. The church, consecrated in 1648, for some time retained some works of art relating to the zenith of the Temple Quarter. I was glad my brother could see this church, since even humble parish churches in Europe are pretty eye-popping. I could almost hear the thoughts in his head, “this is older than my home country!”\n\nWhen we reached the Square of the Temple itself, you might ask what remains of the medieval Temple enclosure. The answer is… nothing. Today the square is a park of grassy lawns and a lovely reservoir. The other day, however, Natasha and I returned to this spot. We had arrived just as a tremendous street market was closing up. The market is linked to two locations nearby. Le Carreau du Temple was formerly a big cloth market, just northeast of the Square du Temple. The Marché des Enfants Rouges (market of the red children) is the oldest surviving covered market area in Paris, dating from 1615. It looked like a delightful place to shop and eat, if only we had had enough energy!\n\nThe Priory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs\n\nThe reason we were out of energy was that we were coming from the Musée des Arts et Métiers, housed in a former Benedictine Priory just a few blocks to the west of the Temple. This museum of scientific and technological arts has one of the best collections I have ever seen! It particularly emphasizes great French innovators, such as Blaise Pascal, Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier, Ferdinand Berthoud, Léon Foucault, Augustin-Jean Fresnel, Léon Bollée, Jacques Vaucanson, Louis-Nicolas Robert, Jules Hardouin-Mansart, the Lumière brothers, Louis-Jacques Mandé Daguerre, Clément Ader, Nicolas Joseph Cugnot, and a host of others. All of these are represented by personal instruments, measurement standards, precision machinery, clockworks, cars, and even airplanes.\n\nGiven that the Paris skyline so prominently features the masterpiece of Gustave Eiffel, it is perhaps not so huge an omission that his name is not widely seen at the museum (he shows up as having helped August Bartholdi in creating the massive “Statue of Liberty Lighting the World” by building its iron skeleton). I was grateful that American pioneers also made an appearance, with prominent exhibits from Seymour Cray, Thomas Edison, and Henry Ford. The museum sits cheek-by-jowl by the Arts et Métiers ParisTech, an engineering school dating from 1780 that has long led France’s efforts in mechanization and industrialization.\n\nGiven that this entire city block is given over to science and technology, it might be surprising to realize that this entire complex occupies the ground of the second-oldest church still standing in Paris (it was constructed just after Saint-Germain-des-Prés). The structure of Saint-Martin-des-Champs was first consecrated in 1067 CE for the Canons Regular by King Philippe I; the “des-Champs” part reflects that the church was build in the fields lying to the northeast of the city of Paris. I think it’s pretty funny that both London and Paris feature churches dedicated to Saint Martin in an area of the current city that was previously agricultural lands.\n\nAt first the church design was essentially Romanesque. Two notable changes to its structure came in 1135 CE, when the chevet was rebuilt in a precursor to the Gothic style (much like Saint-Pierre-de-Montmartre), and in 1455 CE, when its western facade was changed to a flat plane from its previous porch design. The thirteenth century saw the nave rebuilt on grander scale. Saint-Martin-des-Champs was constructed right on the boundary between the worlds of the Romanesque and of the Gothic.\n\nToday, however, we encounter the nave of the church as the final display area of the museum. From the highest point of the ceiling a Foucault pendulum gently swings, showing evidence of the Earth’s rotation, and three different airplanes are suspended nearby. A grand piano was roped off in the axial chapel. The colors of the nave interior are quite lovely, reminding us that churches are not required to be dun and bland inside.\n\nNonetheless, it is clear that Saint-Martin-des-Champs is no longer a church. I was grateful I could spend a moment imagining it in an earlier time.\n\nThat is why I am glad we have images from the distant past to remind us of those times. The drawing above comes from 1630 CE. In 1079 CE, the church was given to the Benedictine order, particularly to the Cluny community (the same group that built the medieval mansion over Roman baths on the left bank). As a “daughter of Cluny,” Saint-Martin gained a belltower and a chapel by the early twelfth century. In the thirteenth century an adjoining refectory and dining hall was also constructed (today the dining hall houses the library of the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers).\n\nUnlike the Temple, the buildings of Saint-Martin-des-Champs have remained intact and unified in purpose. Of course, training the next generations of the science and technology community is a rather different mission than serving as a home for the Benedictine order in the capital! The surprising proximity of the Temple to Saint-Martin-des-Champs (just about three blocks) contributed a structure to this area of Paris. When Philippe Auguste constructed his wall around the city in the thirteenth century, these two districts contributed neighboring gateways in the wall: Porte St. Martin (late 12th century) and Porte du Temple (completed in 1280 CE).\n\nToday, however, it would be very easy to travel through this area of Paris and see little more than another old church and another pretty park. I am glad to have had the chance to examine each a little more closely!\n\nThree churches for three different Montmartres\n\nBecause the first bishop of Paris was martyred on the slopes of the hill, Montmartre has been an obvious site for Christian veneration throughout the history of France, even serving as a site for pilgrimage. I wanted to draw attention to three churches that currently stand on the hill to explore three different “looks” at the city. Two of them stand close together near the crest of the hill, while the other stands (appropriately) next to the Abbesses Metro station.\n\nSaint-Pierre de Montmartre: 1131-1134 AD\n\nIf you enjoy churches that approach a millennium in age, Paris is a rich feast! I have written previously about Saint-Germain-des-Prés, the earliest church still standing in the present city of Paris (before 1014 AD). Philippe Plagnieux, who wrote a wonderful architectural history of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, also wrote a helpful introduction to Saint-Pierre de Montmartre. Saint-Pierre was a project near and dear to the heart of Louis VI (le Gros), the first Capetian king of France to make serious investment in royal institutions. As an example of the importance of this church to the rulers, his queen, Adélaïde of Maurienne, was buried there. The church was the centre of a Benedictine abbey created in 1134.\n\nSt. Pierre was the first church in Paris to represent the new Gothic style (yes, before Notre Dame and before the Basilica of Saint-Denis, too). Sometimes the leading edge is actually the “bleeding edge,” though, and St. Pierre certainly seems to have had some challenges resulting from this design experiment. Around 1170 much of the apse was rebuilt, and the buttresses of the side apses were reinforced. Archive documentation showed that a variety of repairs and additions were required over the next centuries, contributing both ornamental features, such as “flamboyant” rib vaults on the central nave, and structural ones, such as new buttresses or choir alterations.\n\nAs with other churches, St. Pierre suffered worse than neglect during the French Revolution. I was astonished to learn that the admirable field of view for the church made it the site of an optical telegraph tower during the Revolution (if you are a fan of Terry Pratchett, it was similar to the Clacks)! The tower was only removed in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe way that most tourists will encounter St. Pierre is by approaching from the west side, coming from Place du Tertre. From that vantage, one can only see the facade constructed in the 18th century. The tourist route will then lead around the north side of the church (without much view of it, sadly) and then across its east end (the chevet). This is where one could have a great view of this historic church. Frustratingly, there are two problems with this vantage. First, this walk is now designed to funnel tourists to the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur, so this massive, gleaming white church draws one’s attention away from its venerable neighbor. Second, the street is lower than the ground level on which St. Pierre sits, so one tends to photograph the wall rather than the church!\n\nSacré-Cœur Basilica: 1873-1914\n\nAfter the 1870 Battle of Sedan, Napoleon III abdicated, ending the Second Empire period of France. The sense of national humiliation led to the bloody revolt of the Paris Commune (1871), which was terminated through the deaths of thousands of Parisians. French Catholics began looking to the Sacred Heart devotion for a way to revive order, and monarchists were able to swing legislative support behind the project to construct a prominent basilica atop Montmartre (interestingly, the conservatives had eyed the flamboyant, still-under-construction Garnier Opera as a potential site for their church). To say the site at Montmartre was controversial is an understatement: “When you think to establish on the commanding heights of Paris– the fount of free thought and revolution– a catholic monument, what is in your thoughts? To make of it the triumph of the Church over revolution” (from a republican deputy in National Assembly, quoted by David Harvey). For its part, the Sacré-Cœur website denies that repressing revolutionaries contributed to the location or style of the church.\n\nPaul Abadie was an architect who frequently teamed with Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, a controversial figure in the restoration of medieval structures. His proposal for the 1873 design competition for the new church on Montmartre (bottom middle above) was selected.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the church, the unsteady funding to sustain it, and problems in the terrain all combined to prevent the completion of the church before 1914; gypsum mining was quite common on Montmartre [“Plaster of Paris”], and so a deep foundation of 33 meters (more than 100 feet) was required. Paul Abadie never saw his designs reach fruition, since he died in 1884.\n\nSacré-Cœur Basilica seems very unusual among the Gothic churches of Paris, and that reflects Abadie’s choice to adopt a “Romano-Byzantine” fusion for the church instead. To look for precedents, one should look at Hagia Sophia in Istanbul instead of Notre Dame. The enormous mosaic over the choir continues the Byzantine theme. We should not make the mistake of thinking Sacré-Cœur Basilica has its gaze fixed outside of France, though. The massive equestrian statues atop the front portico represent Louis IX and Jeanne d’Arc, with Saint Louis holding his inverted sword pommel as a cross of justice and Joan of Arc with her sword raised, ready to smite a fool.\n\nÉglise Saint-Jean-l’Évangéliste-de-Montmartre: 1894-1904\n\n…And now for something completely different. During the same years that Sacré-Cœur was developing on the crest of Montmartre, a very different church was being built at the Place des Abbesses. Father Sobaux led the parish of Montmartre and realized that the population he served was larger than one church could manage, and creating a new church halfway down the hill would be able to draw from many growing neighborhoods. In choosing to work with architect Anatole de Baudot (a disciple of Viollet-Le-Duc), Father Sobaux had decided to use a revolutionary new technique; iron framing had brought about Art Nouveau, and now reinforced concrete would make for stronger and thinner supports in larger structures (this was key for maximizing the heavily sloped, very small lot available for the church), not to mention far cheaper construction than stone.\n\nWhat they had not expected was a hostile city council and judiciary. The church publised a parish bulletin with the cute name “La Demi Butte” (something like “halfway up the hill”). In its January 1914 issue, Father Sobaux laid out the full story of obstreperous shenanigans bored bureaucrats could throw at a project trying something new (the Third Republic of France was not known for good relations with the Catholic Church, either). The first stone had been laid in 1897. In 1901, however, construction came to a halt when Father Sobaux was called to defend the church in civil court for the charge of having created an unsafe building, where a guilty verdict would bear the penalty of demolition of the structure and a hefty fine on the Church. Before the cardinal decided whether to throw his resources behind Father Sobaux’s defense, he hired Mr. Boutilhier, inspector general of bridges and roads, to decide whether the city’s architects were correct in thinking the structure was unsound. Among other tests, Mr. Boutilhier loaded the nave with bags of sand to produce a weight of 600 kilograms per square meter (>1300 pounds per square yard) and left them in place for weeks. The inspector general’s report fully supported the structural integrity of the church. In 1902, the Prefect of the Seine withdrew the charges against the church, and work was able to continue. In 1904, it opened its doors to the new congregation.\n\nNatasha and I saw the church with our own eyes during our Montmartre meander. I read about this marvel in a book from the American Library in Paris, so I was really pleased when Natasha showed an interest in seeing the inside. Our eyes adjusted to the dun interior, and then our mouths just dropped open. The facade exterior hints at beautiful ceramic work to be found inside. The interlocked arches forming a railing to the balcony contrast tiny mosaic tiles against a gray-bronze of the painted concrete. While the large crucifixion scene in stained glass in the southern wall might draw your attention first, the smaller stained glass windows used incredibly vivid colors.\n\nIs it apparent that this church was revolutionary in its construction methods? Thinking about it the following day, Natasha said, “I have never seen a church that seems so feminine!”\n\nKings, Vikings, and Saints: St. Germain des Prés\n\nA very different Paris\n\nThe oldest church in today’s Paris was established outside the city walls during the sixth century A.D.
