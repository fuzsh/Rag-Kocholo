        "text": "This subject was of considerable importance to the Restoration Monarchy. Louis XVIII had commissioned from Baron Gérard the Entry of Henri IV into Paris (Versailles, Hall of Battles) the event which marked the end of the Wars of Religion and the final unification of France under the benevolent rule of Henri IV. Henri IV’s entry into his capital was compared directly with the peaceful reconciliation between all Frenchmen represented by the Restoration of the ancient Monarchy and had considerable political significance. The subject of our painting shared a corresponding symbolism.\n\nHenri IV was the greatest hero and first King of the Bourbon line and his imagery was employed not only by Louis XVIII and Charles X, but also Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orléans, who shared a common descent from Henri and later usurped his cousin’s throne. Henri III, on the other hand, had been his cousin Henri IV’s most bitter enemy. The third surviving son of Henri II of France and Catherine de Medici he had led the Catholic reaction against the Huguenot rising whose leadership had passed by 1570 to the young King of Navarre, Henri de Bourbon. An attempt at reconciliation between the Catholic Valois and the Protestant followers of Henri, King of Navarre had been made with the latter’s marriage in 1572 to Margot of Valois, daughter of the dowager Queen, Catherine de Medici, and sister of Charles IX and the future Henri III. This was a ruse, however, to entice the King of Navarre and his followers to Paris. Catherine, acting in the name of her feeble second son, Charles IX, and with the future Henri III’s enthusiastic support, had ordered her soldiers to murder Henri of Navarre’s followers in what became known as the Saint Valentine Day’s Massacre. Henri, who first embraced Catholicism to escape execution, later recanted after escaping to reignite the fires of rebellion.\n\nAfter years of struggle, the Religious Wars were curtailed by the assassination in 1589 of Henri III who, dying, summoned his cousin Henri of Navarre to beg his forgiveness and name him his successor. This is the scene shown here. The King of Navarre was not only the leader of the Protestant faction but also head of the next male line of the House. The dying King passes him the Scepter and Crown, twin symbols of royalty, and all present were commanded to recognize him as heir. Although Henri IV was proclaimed King of France on his Valois cousin’s death, he faced four more years of struggle before eventually converting to Catholicism (the occasion of his famous saying “Paris is worth a Mass”) and being allowed to enter his capital. For Louis XVIII, who had been restored after Napoleon’s decade long Empire ended, and for Ferdinand I, who had been restored to his capital Naples in 1815 after fifteen years in exile in Sicily, there was a powerful symbolism in the Crown being passed without a break from one legitimate Monarch to the next."
