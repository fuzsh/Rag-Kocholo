        "text": "Family\n\nHélène of Orléans (1871-1951) was the third of eight children born to Philip of Orléans, Count of Paris and Orlean pretender to the French throne, and his wife Marie-Isabelle of Orléans, Infanta of Spain.\n\nHis maternal grandmother was Luisa Fernanda of Spain, younger sister of Isabella II of Spain, while her great-grandparents (both maternal and paternal) were the last kings of the French: Louis Philippe of France and Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily.\n\nHélène was described as a serious and thoughtful girl, spoke perfect English and three other languages, and was a great lover of the humanities. She was tall and slim, with light eyes and reddish-blond hair. Hélène appeared refined and elegant but also sporty and sprightly. She was ‘the personification of feminine health and beauty, distinguished as a graceful athlete and charming linguist‘.\n\nLike her two older brothers, Hélène was born in exile at York House, Twickenham, shortly before the repeal of the exile law against the dynasty. At the end of June 1871, they were able to return to France.\n\nHowever, the festivities in Paris in the spring of 1886 that preceded the marriage in Lisbon of Hélène’s older sister Amelia to the royal prince of Portugal aroused such clear expressions of monarchical support for the House of Orléans that on 22 July the French Republic took the precaution of banning the heads of the former ruling dynasties of France, the Orléans and the Bonapartes, from the country.\n\nAlmost all the Orléans immediately left France: Hélène and her parents went to England then to Scotland. Finally, in 1890 they moved to Stowe House in Buckingham, England.\n\nIn Love with the Duke of Clarence\n\nMost of Hélène’s siblings had married well, including Amelia, Queen of Portugal, Philip, Duke of Orleans (who married Archduchess Maria Dorothea of Austria) and Isabelle, Duchess of Guise. Hélène’s parents hoped that she would marry an heir to the throne. These hopes were fuelled by the fact that Hélène was considered a great beauty for the time.\n\nPrince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale (who was called ‘Eddy’ in the family) was the eldest son of the future Edward VII and grandson of the then reigning Queen Victoria. During the spring and summer of 1890, Eddy and Hélène became acquainted at the home of the Duke of Clarence’s sister, Princess Louise, Duchess of Fife and, with the encouragement of their respective mothers, Hélène and Eddy fell in love.\n\nOn 29 August, the Duke of Clarence obtained permission to meet alone with his grandmother at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, and brought Hélène with him. Marriage to a Roman Catholic would have resulted in the constitutional forfeiture of Eddy’s claim to the British throne under the Act of Settlement, but Hélène offered to become an Anglican. When Queen Victoria expressed surprise at this offer, Hélène wept and insisted that she wanted to do it out of love.\n\nMoved by the couple’s desperate plea for help, Victoria agreed to support them, but warned that she felt there were many obstacles that would make success unlikely. Among these was the prediction that Hélène’s father would not consent to her daughter’s change of faith.\n\nThe Duke of Clarence offered to relinquish his succession rights if necessary, writing to his brother: ‘You have no idea how I love this sweet girl now, and I feel I could never be happy without her’.\n\nQueen Victoria’s fears of insurmountable opposition from many quarters proved to be correct. Her prime minister, Lord Salisbury, expressed his objections to the alliance to the Queen in writing on 9 September. Hélène’s father refused to accept the marriage, was adamant and informed the Queen of his decision. However, he granted Hélène permission to personally ask Pope Leo XIII for a dispensation to marry the Duke of Clarence but the Pope confirmed her father’s verdict and the courtship ended.\n\nEddy never got over his feelings for Hélèneand their relationship is commemorated on his tomb at Windsor Castle by a beaded wreath with the single word ‘Helene’ written on it. As fate would have it, the Duke of Clarence never became king because, shortly after his engagement to Princess Mary of Teck (who would later marry the future George V, Eddy’s brother), he died of influenza in 1892.\n\nOther potential suitors\n\nAlthough acknowledging in his diary his parents’ desire for a French alliance, the future Tsar Nicholas II of Russia (first cousin of the Duke of Clarence) never pursued their choice, a marriage with Hélène of Orleans, as he was already in love with Alice of Hesse and obtained their permission to marry her in 1894.\n\nIn 1892, while travelling in Egypt with her brother Philip, Hélène met Ernst Gunther, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, who decided to marry her, much to the disappointment of his sister, the German Empress Augusta Victoria. German diplomatic pressure put an end to Ernst Gunther’s hopes, probably fruitless in any case, as Hélène showed no interest in his advances.\n\nLater, family members pushed for a marriage to Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. Although Emperor Franz Joseph was not in favour of this union, he said he would not oppose it, and Franz Ferdinand himself did not say no but postponed the decision. In the meantime, he met his future wife, Countess Sophie Chotek, and no longer considered Hélène.\n\nMarriage and relationship with the Savoys\n\nFate was leading Hélène in the direction of Italy because in 1893 she met in London Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, Duke of Aosta, at that time second in line to the Italian throne.\n\nHélène, so refined and vivacious, fell in love with the elegance and gallantry of the Duke, whom she married on 25 June 1895 in London, in the presence of Crown Prince Victor Emmanuel of Italy, the Prince and Princess of Wales and other members of the British royal family.\n\nHélène arrived in Italy as a queen and was immediately a great social success, despite the fact that the marriage was not particularly well liked in the House of Savoy. ‘She is tall, too tall,’ writes Victor Emmanuel. Queen Margherita herself had little sympathy for the new Duchess of Aosta.\n\nIn 1898 and 1900 Hélène gave birth to two boys, Amedeo and Aimone, and the duchess, who was ambitious, certainly hoped for the throne for her eldest son, since at the beginning of their marriage Victor Emmanuel and Elena of Montenegro had no children. The Duchess of Aosta’s hope ended in 1904, with the birth of Crown Prince Umberto.\n\nIt is true that as the Aosta family were very refined, the same could not be said of the royal Savoy couple, but it is not very flattering that Hélène called Queen Elena ‘Ma cousine la bergere – my cousin the shepherdess‘!\n\nThe Dukes of Aosta first lived in Turin, then from 1905 in Naples, in the palace of Capodimonte, whose court rivalled the royal court of the Savoy. The couple influenced Neapolitan cultural and intellectual life. Hélène was involved in charity work and was considered the Queen of Naples.\n\nAdventures around the world\n\nHélène was a modern, easy-going and adventurous woman. Already in 1892 she had travelled with her brother Philip to Egypt and Palestine, the first of many trips outside Europe.\n\nAs the cracks began to appear in her marriage to the Duke of Aosta (the two remained married but from 1902 ‘agreed’ to be an open couple), Hélène began to make frequent trips to Africa, lasting up to ten months at a time.\n\nShe travelled along the Nile, the Congo, much of East Africa and crossed the Sahara. During these journeys she became known as a hunter of large animals, a reputation reinforced by the articles she wrote for Harper’s Weekly and, later, by the travel books, illustrated with photographs she took.\n\nIn 1913-1914 Hélène undertook a trip around the world, which she reported in another travel book.\n\nWar-time nurse\n\nAt the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish war, the indefatigable Hélène trained as a nurse and boarded the hospital ship Menfi, where she cared for wounded and sick soldiers.\n\nDuring the First World War, Hélène became head nurse of the Italian Red Cross and spent much of her time on or near the front line. She is remembered for greatly improving the sanitary conditions of military hospitals and for elevating and professionalising the role of nurses.\n\nFor her service, the Duchess of Aosta was awarded the Italian Silver Medal for valour, the Romanian Queen Mary Cross, the French Croix de Guerre and the Insignia of Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire. Her war diary was later published with an introduction by Benito Mussolini to help the Italian Red Cross.\n\nAn experience that the writer Gabriele D’Annunzio reported in his ‘Canzone per Elena di Francia‘ (Song for Hélène of France): ‘…at the edge of the bandage that binds him, a golden face bends towards his cheek, a golden face like the cornflower. Be blessed, Hélène of France…‘.\n\nLater years and death\n\nHélène was widowed in 1931 and got married a second time in 1936 to Colonel Otto Campini, 20 years her junior.\n\nDespite the high esteem in which she was held, especially for her charitable activities and religious devotion, there was a shadow over her figure, her convinced support for fascism. Ambitious as she was, she wanted important roles for her sons, so Amedeo was appointed viceroy of Ethiopia in 1937 and Aimone, king of Croatia, in 1941.\n\nA sad end, however, for these sons, who both died before their mother: Amedeo died of malaria in Kenya in 1942, Aimone was in exile in South America when he died of a heart attack in 1948 (Aimone had had a son from his marriage to Irene of Greece, Amedeo, father of the current head of the Savoy-Aosta family, Prince Aimone).\n\nThe end of the Second World War was also the end of the monarchy in Italy and so, after the proclamation of the Republic on 2 June 1946, Hélène retired to her Capodimonte residence, the only one authorised by the Italian government to remain in Italy. Famous, in this regard, was her reply to Umberto II when he asked the whole family to leave Italy: ‘Sire, I have become Italian and I am staying in Italy‘.\n\nThe Duchess of Aosta had a special love for Naples. In 1947, she donated her entire library of some 11,000 volumes to the National Library in Naples.\n\nOn 20 January 1951 at 11.15 p.m. Hélène d’Orléans died at Castellammare di Stabia, suffering from cerebral thrombosis. According to her wishes, the funeral was simple, without flowers, she only wanted the Tricolour with the Savoy shield to be placed on the coffin. Hélène rests in the Basilica of the Incoronata Madre del Buon Consiglio at Capodimonte.\n\nFor further reading"
