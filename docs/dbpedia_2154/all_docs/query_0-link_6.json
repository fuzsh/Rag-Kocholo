The Protestant François Guizot was to be the most prominent political personality of the time.",

        "text": "Louis-Philippe agreed to his children marrying Protestants...\n\nProtestants trusted the head of the new dynasty : it was said that he had attended Protestant church services in Switzerland, that he had met Jean Monod, pastor of the French community in Copenhagen, and that his best friend had been a Protestant, Louis de Chabot-Jarnac. This favourable impression was confirmed by the immediate rallying of Guizot, Cuvier and Benjamin Constant.\n\nThe fact that three of King Louis-Philippe’s children married Protestants resulted in the royal family’s real popularity amongst the latter. His eldest daughter, Louise, married the new king of the Belgians, Léopold I of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, a Lutheran ; their children, however, had to be brought up as Catholics. After the civil ceremony and the Catholic wedding, another ceremony was held that satisfied the « Protestant subjects » (it was, in fact, a fairly lustreless ceremony, no more than a simple family service). In 1837 Marie, the king’s second daughter likewise married a Lutheran : Alexander, Duke of Wurttemberg. And Ferdinand-Philippe, Duke of Orleans and heir to the throne, married a Protestant, Helen de Mecklenburg-Schwerin ; the latter remained Protestant and regularly attended Lutheran church services. « The Bible was found in the royal dwellings, alongside the missal ».\n\n...and associated Protestants to political life\n\nSeveral Protestants actively participated in political life : chiefly Guizot, but also Agénor de Gasparin, Claramond Pelet de la Lozère and Léon de Maleville. In 1847, 17 Peers of France were Reformed Protestants.\n\nThe Education policy and the fairly liberal trend of the regime suited the majority of Protestants, especially the middle-class who held most of the power via the tax-based voting system. At this stage, the new social aspect of Protestantism began to flourish, with its businessmen and bankers in Paris, Nîmes and Alsace."
