        "text": "Philip II\n\nking of Spain and Portugal\n\nTop Questions\n\nWho was Philip II?\n\nPhilip II was a member of the Habsburg dynasty. He served as king of the Spaniards from 1556 to 1598 and as king of the Portuguese (as Philip I) from 1580 to 1598. The Spanish empire under Philip prospered: it attained its greatest power, extent, and influence. Philip was the self-proclaimed protector of the Roman Catholic Church. He sought to limit the spread of Protestantism, and he ultimately completed the work of unification begun by Ferdinand and Isabella (the “Catholic Monarchs”) in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nhouse of HabsburgRead more about the house of Habsburg and the Habsburg dynasty.\n\nProtestantism: The expansion of the Reformation in EuropeLearn about the expansion of the Reformation in Europe in the 16th century.\n\nHow did Philip II become king?\n\nPhilip II was born on May 21, 1527, in Valladolid, Spain. Philip was the son of Charles V—the reigning Holy Roman emperor—and Isabella of Portugal. Philip was prepared to succeed Charles almost from birth. As a child, Philip sometimes received secret memoranda from his father reminding him of the responsibility he bore as his father’s successor and warning him to be wary of advisers. Charles gradually increased Philip’s responsibilities as he aged. In 1540 Charles gave the duchy of Milan to Philip. In 1555 Charles resigned the Netherlands to Philip. In 1556 Charles resigned the kingdoms of Spain, the Spanish overseas empire, and the Franche-Comté to Philip. Philip eventually succeeded to all but one of his father’s dominions.\n\nRead more below: Philip II\n\nCharles VRead about Philip II’s father, Charles V.\n\nWhat is Philip II known for?\n\nPhilip II is remembered both for his failures and for his successes. As a ruler, Philip was stubborn, bitter, and paranoid—and his court was no better. It was slow and ineffective, prone to factionalism and infighting. The failures of Philip’s government were great: it failed to suppress the revolt of the Netherlands (beginning in 1566), and it sacrificed the “Invincible Armada” to the English in 1588. Its successes, however, were also great. Under Philip, the Ottomans were defeated (1571), the spread of Protestantism in Italy and Spain was prevented, and a literary Golden Age began.\n\nRead more below: Philip II\n\nSpain: Philip IILearn more about the Spanish empire under Philip II.\n\nWho succeeded Philip II?\n\nPhilip II married four times and was four times a widower. The son of his first wife, Maria of Portugal, died in prison in 1568. His second wife, Mary I of England, bore him no children. His third wife, Elizabeth of Valois, bore him two daughters. Philip fathered a son by his fourth wife and cousin, Anna of Austria. Upon Philip’s death in 1598, his second son ascended the throne as Philip III.\n\nMary IRead about Philip II’s marriage to “Bloody Mary.”\n\nCarlos de AustriaRead about Philip’s first son and learn why he was imprisoned.\n\nPhilip II (born May 21, 1527, Valladolid, Spain—died September 13, 1598, El Escorial) was the king of the Spaniards (1556–98) and king of the Portuguese (as Philip I, 1580–98), champion of the Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation. During his reign the Spanish empire attained its greatest power, extent, and influence, though he failed to suppress the revolt of the Netherlands (beginning in 1566) and lost the “Invincible Armada” in the attempted invasion of England (1588).\n\nEarly life and marriages\n\nPhilip was the son of the Holy Roman emperor Charles V and Isabella of Portugal. From time to time, the emperor wrote Philip secret memoranda, impressing on him the high duties to which God had called him and warning him against trusting any of his advisers too much. Philip, a very dutiful son, took this advice to heart. From 1543 Charles conferred on his son the regency of Spain whenever he himself was abroad. From 1548 until 1551, Philip traveled in Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands, but his great reserve and his inability to speak fluently any language except Castilian made him unpopular with the German and Flemish nobility.\n\nPhilip contracted four marriages. The first was with his cousin Maria of Portugal in 1543. She died in 1545, giving birth to the ill-fated Don Carlos. In 1554 Philip married Mary I of England and became joint sovereign of England until Mary’s death, without issue, in 1558. Philip’s third marriage, with Elizabeth of Valois, daughter of Henry II of France, in 1559, was the result of the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559), which, for a generation, ended the open wars between Spain and France. Elizabeth bore Philip two daughters, Isabella Clara Eugenia (1566–1633) and Catherine Micaela (1567–97). Elizabeth died in 1568, and in 1570 Philip married Anna of Austria, daughter of his first cousin the emperor Maximilian II. She died in 1580. Her only surviving son became Philip III.\n\nKing of Spain\n\nPhilip had received the duchy of Milan from Charles V in 1540 and the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily in 1554 on the occasion of his marriage to Mary of England. On October 25, 1555, Charles resigned the Netherlands in Philip’s favour and on January 16, 1556, the kingdoms of Spain and the Spanish overseas empire. Shortly afterward Philip also received the Franche-Comté. The Habsburg dominions in Germany and the imperial title went to his uncle Ferdinand I. At this time Philip was in the Netherlands. After the victory over the French at Saint-Quentin (1557), the sight of the battlefield gave him a permanent distaste for war, though he did not shrink from it when he judged it necessary.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nAfter his return to Spain from the Netherlands in 1559, Philip never again left the Iberian Peninsula. From Madrid he ruled his empire through his personal control of official appointments and all forms of patronage. Philip’s subjects outside Castile, thus, never saw him, and they gradually turned not only against his ministers but also against him.\n\nMethod of government\n\nBy sheer hard work Philip tried to overcome the defects of this system. His methods have become famous. All work was done on paper, on the basis of consultas (that is, memoranda, reports, and advice presented him by his ministers). In Madrid, or in the gloomy magnificence of his monastic palace of El Escorial, which he built (1563–84) on the slopes of the Sierra de Guadarrama, the king worked alone in his small office, giving his decisions or, as often, deferring them. Nothing is known of his order of work, but all his contemporaries agreed that his methods dangerously, and sometimes fatally, slowed down a system of government already notorious for its dilatoriness. Philip was painstaking and conscientious in his cravings for ever more information, hiding an inability to distinguish between the important and the trivial and a temperamental unwillingness to make decisions.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Margaret of Parma, the duke of Alba, Don John of Austria, Antonio Pérez, and Alessandro Farnese—to name only the most distinguished—suffered disgrace. “His smile and his dagger were very close,” wrote his official court historian, Cabrera de Córdoba. It was no exaggeration, for in the case of Juan de Escobedo, the secretary of Don John of Austria, Philip even consented to murder. As a result, Philip’s court became notorious for the bitterness of its faction fights. The atmosphere of the Spanish court did much to poison the whole Spanish system of government, and this played no small part in causing the Eighty Years’ War (1568–1648) and the rebellions of the Moriscos of Granada (1568–70) and the Aragonese (1591–92).\n\nYet the “black legend” that in Protestant countries represented Philip II as a monster of bigotry, ambition, lust, and cruelty is certainly false. Philip’s spare and elegant appearance is known from the famous portraits by Titian and by Sir Anthony More. He was a lover of books and pictures, and Spain’s literary Golden Age began in his reign. An affectionate father to his daughters, he lived an austere and dedicated life. “You may assure His Holiness,” Philip wrote to his ambassador in Rome, in 1566, “that rather than suffer the least damage to religion and the service of God, I would lose all my states and an hundred lives, if I had them; for I do not propose nor desire to be the ruler of heretics.” This remark may be regarded as the motto of his reign. To accomplish the task set him by God of preserving his subjects in the true Catholic religion, Philip felt in duty bound to use his royal powers, if need be, to the point of the most ruthless political tyranny, as he did in the Netherlands. Even the popes found it sometimes difficult to distinguish between Philip’s views as to what was the service of God and what the service of the Spanish monarchy."
