        "text": "Oil on canvas\n\nIn its Louis XIV period frame in carved and gilded wood, \"Berain\" model\n\nTotal dimensions : 125 x 95 cm. The canvas alone : 100 x 70 cm\n\nPhilippe d'Orléans, younger brother of King Louis XIV and more commonly called \"Monsieur\", was born on September 21, 1640 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye and died on June 9, 1701 in the Château de Saint-Cloud.\n\nPrince of the French royal family, son of Louis XIII and Anne of Austria. Titled Duke of Anjou at birth, he was known by his title of Duke of Orleans from the death of his uncle Gaston of France in 1660.\n\nPhilippe, is homosexual and well known for his libertinage. Amateur of extravagant finery, he leads an expensive lifestyle. He had several favorites in his entourage, including the Marquis of Châtillon, the Count of Guiche, the Marquis of Beuvron, the Marquis of Manicamp, the Marquis of Effiat and especially for thirty years the Chevalier de Lorraine.\n\nHowever, imposed by his brother the King, he married twice, the first of his wives was Princess Henriette of England and the second, the daughter of the Elector Palatine, Elisabeth-Charlotte of Bavaria known as \"The Palatine\". From this union two sons and a daughter were born.\n\nJean Nocret\n\nPainter of history, portraits and aquafortist, he was born in Nancy in 1615 and died in Paris in 1672.\n\nA student of Jean Le Clerc, a master from Lorraine, Nocret undertook a trip to Rome. There he met Nicolas Poussin and made copies for Monsieur de Chantelou. Returning to Paris in 1644, he was appointed in December 1649 painter to the king, valet de chambre to the king, and painter to the Duke of Orleans, and quickly became known as a great portraitist.\n\nIn 1657, Nocret left for Portugal in the company of the French ambassador, the bishop of Comminges, and during this period painted portraits of the Portuguese royal family. Back in Paris in 1660, he was commissioned to decorate the interiors of the Château de Saint-Cloud.\n\nNocret joined the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1663, with the presentation of the Repentance of Saint Peter.\n\nBetween 1666 and 1669, Nocret decorated the queen's apartments in the Tuileries Palace, under the direction of Charles Le Brun. These decorations disappeared in 1871, following the fire of the Tuileries.\n\nIn addition to the collective portrait of the royal family presented at Versailles, several paintings have been preserved, including a portrait of a child as a Roman general (Blois, Musée des Beaux-Arts), Portrait of Philippe d'Anjou (Madrid, Prado Museum), Portrait of the Duchess of La Vallière, Portrait of Queen Marie-Thérèse, and Portrait of Anne of Austria (Versailles, Musée national des châteaux de Versailles et de Trianon). Some works are only attributed to him or to his workshop, such as La Renommée présentant à la France, le portrait de Louis XIV (Saint-Quentin, musée Antoine Lécuyer, painting sometimes attributed to Louis-Ferdinand Elle), Portrait d'Anne d'Autriche (Nantes, musée des Beaux-Arts), Portrait de Louis XIV (Château de Maisons-Laffitte), Portrait de Louis XIV en général romain (vers 1670, Sceaux, musée de l'Île-de-France).\n\nVery good condition."
