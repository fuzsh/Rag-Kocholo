        "text": "Even though I've been totally slacking on it, I am still working on my OTL, The Last Hanover, which explores the life and reign of Charlotte of Wales had she survived her childbirth in November 1817.\n\nObviously with Charlotte living, Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld -Leopold I of Belgium- is not going to take that throne. It's been making me crazy trying to figure out who will take the throne, and what it will do to Europe. Some things that for sure are going down are: Albert (OTL husband of Victoria) marries a Russian Grand Duchess and gets Greece after Otto I, and Louis Philippe d'Orléans does not take the throne of France and rules as co-regent with the dowager Duchesse de Berry, who does not remarry and retains custody of her son, who becomes the liberal King Henri V of the French.\n\nOur OTL options are:\n\nPrince Louis d'Orléans, Duc de Nemours (In my timeline, his father is next in line to the French after Henri V and his oldest brother Ferdinand Philippe is marrying Henri V's sister to keep the bloodlines together, so he's the next best 'Royalist French' option. In February 1831 OTL, he was nominated king of the Belgians when accompanying the French army into Belgium to support it's revolt; he participated in the siege of Antwerp. His father -the King of the French at the time- made him deny it to keep international peace but here it's not so much of an issue. OTL he married Leopold's Catholic niece, Viktoria of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Koháry, but he might look to marry someone a little higher up in this situation. Suggestions welcome!)\n\nAuguste de Beauharnais, The Duke of Leuchtenberg (Step-grandson of Napoléon I and grandson of Maximilian Josef I of Bavaria. He was the official Russian candidate OTL and is ridiculously well connected in Europe: His sisters included Joséphine, The Queen of Sweden and Amélie, The Empress of Brazil; his aunts and uncles included Ludwig I of Bavaria, Empress Karolina of Austria, Queen Elisabeth Ludovika of Prussia, Queen Amalia Auguste of Saxony, Queen Maria Anna of Saxony, and Archduchess Sophie of Austria; and he was a first cousin to Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria, Napoléon III, Maximilian II of Bavaria, Maximilian I of Mexico, Otto of Greece, The Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine, Albrecht I of Saxony, Georg I of Saxony, The Grand Duchess of Tuscany, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, and the Queen of the Two Sicilies. OTL his Napoleonic connections allayed the concerns of some of the Great Powers worried that the breakaway Roman Catholic realm might otherwise ally itself too closely with the likewise Catholic and revolutionary \"bourgeois monarchy\" of Orléans France, but since there's no bourgeois Orléans France, I'm not sure how his chances improve / worsen in this situation. He was said to have \"proved unthreatening to the Great Powers because of his lack of membership in an already reigning dynasty and lack of conflicting foreign obligations or ambitions\". He married Maria II of Portugal OTL and died two months later; supposedly he most likely died from diphtheria, so it's a simple case of butterflying that away. Obviously he can't marry Maria II in this situation, so brides for him would be welcome!)\n\nMaximilien de Beauharnais, The Duke of Leuchtenberg (The brother of above, he's got all the same connections and 'unthreatening-ness'. OTL he had a not-so-hot marriage with Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia and like his brother, died fairly young of tuberculosis. Active in artistic and charitable causes, he could make a decent king. Not going to marry Maria Nikolaevna in this situation - she was a devoted Russian and not going anywhere, thank you- , so we're gonna need another wife).\n\nArchduke Karl of Austria, The Duke of Teschen (Third son of Emperor Leopold II of the HRE, he was adopted and raised by his paternal aunt and uncle, the Duke and Duchess of Teschen, who conveniently were the much beloved governors of the Habsburg Netherlands - including what ended up becoming Belgium. He's not quite as well-connected as the Beauharnais brothers -he's a brother and an uncle to the Austrian Emperors, brother to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, great-uncle of the Duchesse de Berry, and brother to the Queen of Saxony. He's also got numerous cousin on Catholic thrones throughout Europe. He's married to the Protestant Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg - a nice sop to the Protestants in Belgium-, who's a sister to the Duke of Nassau and a distant cousin of the British royal family. He has six living children, including 4 sons, at the time he would accede to the throne, which gives him a bit of a leg up - his oldest son, Albrecht, was born in 1817 and OTL married Hildegard of Bavaria but may look for another, more connected wife if he's going to be the next King of the Belgians. All of the kids marriages will probably get shifted around if he takes the throne, so matches for them would be appreciated)\n\nWild Card Options\n\nFor whatever reasons, these guys weren't offered the throne of Belgium when it came up for grabs: since it's my timeline and my rules, I thought I would give them a shot this time around.\n\nPrince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha-Koháry (Brother of Leopold, he converted to Catholicism for his Hungarian heiress wife, Maria Antonia Koháry de Csábrág and founded the Catholic Koháry branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha. OTL his son Ferdinand married Maria II of Portugal after Auguste de Leuchtenberg kicked the bucket, his daughter Viktoria married the Duc de Nemours, and his son August married Princess Clémentine of Orléans, so they were fairly well-connected. The fact that his wife was noble and not royal might be a sticking point for some of the Great Powers, but he's Catholic, has three sons, is fairly well-connected, and has connections to Great Britain and Austria right off the bat. Obviously his son Ferdinand can't marry Maria II of Portugal if he's going to be a king in his own right, so he needs a new wife - his brother and sister probably wouldn't both marry into the Orléans family, so one or both of them possibly need new spouses as well, and possibly the third son Leopold, who married morganatically OTL but might not get away with that here).\n\nNapoléon François Charles Joseph Bonaparte, The Duke of Reichstadt (aka Napoléon II): (Okay, so hear me out here: the guy was intelligent, serious, focused, Catholic, a military man, and well-connected to the Emperors of Austria. Assuming we keep him from dying in 1832 and he gives up all claims to the throne of France, I feel like he's got a decent shot. He \"gave some concern and fascination to the monarchies of Europe and French leaders over his possible return to France. However, he was allowed to play no political role and instead was used by Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich in bargaining with France to gain advantage for Austria\". Assuming the stars align and the heavens part, we need to find a wife for him, since he was a confirmed bachelor OTL)\n\nBONUS CHALLENGE: Find me someone to marry Victoria of Kent (OTL Queen Victoria, who's been pushed pretty far down the line of succession in this timeline), either from these candidates or in general!\n\nWould the Duke of Orleans allow his daughter to marry the relative of Napoleon? Granted my French history is shaky, but I distinctly remember the Bourbons / Orleans hating the Bonapartes - I could be wrong though. I like the idea of Auguste and Maria Theresa - like you said, a good way to get the Austrians on their side. I would ship Victoria to the Netherlands but I already have a dumpster fire set up there in this timeline - Charlotte and Leopold's daughter and William III. Maybe Victoria could marry William III's younger brother Alexander? That might be too many Dutch marriages for Leo and his 'Coburg under every Crown' plan though. Marriage to Ernst could work, especially with her mother pushing for it...\n\nYeah, if Charlotte & Leo's daughter is taking William III then Victoria likely isn't going to Amsterdam. Ernst is the most likely choice, which will make for an interesting marriage between the philandering Ernst and needy Victoria\n\nSeriously cannot believe N2 has the highest number of votes right now - I know @isabella said that giving him a seat to close to the French was asking for trouble, but Belgium is such an interesting little seat between France, Germany, and the Netherlands. Maybe Belgium would keep him satisfied (new country, he's the first ruler a la his papa, he can prove his worth, fun chance to prove himself as the son of Napoleon by fighting off the Dutch) and he could / would be persuaded to forfeit any claims to France in return for getting Belgium. Who would he marry, though? I'm figuring since he has the backing of one Great Power (Austria), it would be wise to marry into another. Or maybe he could marry Maria Theresa of Teschen to earn that popularity vote.. any thoughts?\n\nPoll's not over until it's over - vote and comment for your favorite!\n\nMaria Theresa is one choice, but might it be considered too Austrian. Honestly, if any Orleans will marry him it might be the ambitious Clementine, although she's a bit young. However might pragmatism rule the day?\n\nWhy not a local belgian princely house?\n\nAdded as voting options!\n\nFor Belgian princes, there are:\n\nEugène François Charles Joseph Lamoral de Ligne, The Prince de Ligne (He had a successful diplomatic career, beginning in Austria before Belgium became its own country. In 1849 he was elected as a member of the Belgian parliament, was President of the Belgian senate from 25 March 1852 until 18 July 1879, and in 1863, Leopold I named him the Minister of State; an experienced statesman and diplomat that could easily move to king. He's widowed after 1833, which opens him up for a royal marriage, and has two sons: Henri (b. 1824) and Louis (b. 1827).)\n\nHenri Marie Ghislain de Merode, The Prince Rubempré et de Grimberghe (After the French Revolution, members of the Merode family became prominently engaged in politics and diplomacy. Charles-Guillaume-Ghislain de Merode (Henri's father) had been active as a minister under Austrian rule since 1787 and would hold several other important political posts under successive regimes, such as mayor of Brussels in 1805, and senator of the French Empire in 1809. Henri's brother Frédéric became a new national hero when he was killed in the battle near Berchem during the Belgian revolution, while his other brother Félix became an important member of the Provisional Government of Belgium and the Belgian National Congress. After the first Belgian legislative elections, Henri de Merode became a senator, while his brothers Félix and Werner both became members of parliament. The de Merodes had owned land in Belgium since the 14th century, and were known for their wealth and connections. In 1831, Henri is married with a daughter and a son: Marie (b. 1820) and Charles (b. 1824).)\n\nJoseph Philippe de Riquet de Caraman, The Prince de Chimay (Rich, cultured, a Francophile, he led the negotiations which led to a treaty of friendship between the Netherlands and Belgium following William I of the Netherlands' abjuration, which guaranteed Belgian independence. He also contributed to establishing Belgium's diplomatic relations with the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the Kingdom of Naples, the Papal States and the German Confederation. A devout Catholic, he founded Scourmont Abbey and the Compagnie de Chimay, which helped build the first railways in Belgium. In 1831, he is newly married to Émilie Pellapra, with whom he will eventually have four children; she'd be fairly easy to butterfly away, though. His father François-Joseph is alive until 1843 and a friend to Napoleon I, so he is another option)\n\nProsper Louis vom Arenberg, The Duke of Arenberg (He was the colonel of the Belgian Chevau-Légers d'Arenberg which fought in the Peninsular War, and a friend to Napoleon I, who gave him the additional titles of Duke of Meppen and Prince of Recklinghausen. In 1831, he's married and has three sons -Engelbert (b. 1824), Pierre (b. 1826), and Charles (b. 1831)- and two daughters -Louise (b. 1820) and Marie-Flore (b. 1823)).\n\nAlfred François Frédéric Philippe von Croÿ, Duke von Croÿ (His father was made a peer of France in the Bourbon restoration, and his family was well-known in Belgium and Europe: famous members included \"two bishop-dukes of Cambrai, two cardinals (one being also the Archbishop of Toledo and another being the Archbishop of Rouen), five bishops (those of Therouanne, Tournai, Cammin, Arras, and Ypres), one prime minister of Philip the Good, one finance minister, archchancellor, chief admiral, godfather and tutor of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (himself godfather to another Croÿ), one Grand-Bouteiller, one Grand-Maitre and one Marshal of France; one Grand Equerry of the King of Spain, several imperial field marshals and twenty generals, four finance ministers of the Netherlands, two governors of the Netherlands and Belgium, one Russian field marshal; numerous ministers, ambassadors and senators in France, Austria, Belgium, and a record of thirty-two knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece\". In 1831, he is married and has six children: Léopoldine (b. 1821), Rudolf (b. 1823), Alexis (b. 1825), Emma (b. 1826), Georges (b. 1828), and Anna (b. 1831))"
