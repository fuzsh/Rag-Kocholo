        "text": "The Spanish Civil War was fought between the Republicans, who were loyal to the Spanish Republic, and the Nationalists, a rebel group led by General Francisco Franco from 17th July 1936 to 1st April 1939. The war ended with the victory of the Nationalists, and Franco ruled Spain for the next 36 years, from 1939 until his death in 1975. There were a number of intellectuals and writers who went to Catalonia to back up the Republicans. Both George Orwell and Ernest Hemingway participated in the Spanish Civil War. Orwell wrote a retrospective text about his personal experience in Spain: Homage to Catalonia (1938), whereas Hemingway wrote his famous novel For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940) which takes place during the Spanish Civil War. The novel is set in the spring of 1937, a month after the German troops bombarded the Spanish town of Guernica. This paper work shows to what extent the above-mentioned works of art and literature reect and inform the readers about the truths and real circumstances of the Spanish Civil War. İspanya İç Savaşı, 17 Temmuz 1936-1 Nisan 1939 tarihlerinde, İspanyol Cumhuriyeti'ne sadık olan Cumhuriyetçiler ve General Francisco Franco önderliğinde bir isyancı grup olan Milliyetçiler arasında meydana gelmiştir. Savaş, milliyetçilerin zaferiyle sonuçlanmış ve General Franco bu tarihten itibaren 1975 yılında gerçekleşen ölümüne kadar 36 yıl boyunca İspanya'yı yönetmiştir. Cumhuriyetçilere destek vermek için çok sayıda aydın ve yazar Katalonya'ya gitmiştir. Gerek George Orwell gerekse Ernest Hemingway İspanyol İç Savaşı'na katılmıştır. Orwell İspanya'daki kendi kişisel deneyimini yansıtan retrospektif bir metin olan Katalonya'ya Armağan, Hemingway ise konusu İspanya İç Savaşında geçen ünlü romanı Çanlar Kimin için Çalıyor?'u yazmıştır. Roman Alman askerlerinin İspanya'nın Guernica kasabasını bombalamalarından bir ay sonra, 1937 baharında geçmektedir. Bu çalışmanın amacı, yukarıda adı geçen sanat ve edebiyat yapıtlarının ne derecede İspanya İç Savaşını yansıttığını ve okuyucuyu iç savaşın gerçek yüzü ve gerçek şartları hakkında bilgilendirdiğini ortaya koymaktır.\n\nThis essay considers the nature of the contribution made by contemporary Spanish novelists to the process of the recovery of historical memory and the construction of a democratic state in Spain specifically from within the literary field. It begins by reviewing some current thinking in critical theory on the role of literature in society and the relationship between the arts and democracy before moving on to an analysis of two novels published in 2006: Tres cipreses by Manuel Ramos Ramos and La higuera by Ramiro Pinilla. The purpose of this analysis is to show how even today some novels continue to offer one-sided accounts of the Spanish Civil War while others offer a more complex account of the events and to argue that while the first does little to further understanding of the conflict, the latter can be read in a literary mode which, by offering an encounter with ‘the other’, deepens understanding and so makes an essential contribution to a maturing democracy.\n\nSince the mid-1990s in Spain, a renewal of interest in the history of the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) and Francoist dictatorship (1939-1975) has resulted in a surge of cultural and historiographical production related to the subject, as well as instigating a robust debate about how these difficult periods ought to be officially interpreted and commemorated. This so-called memory boom indicates that there is still an unresolved tension in Spanish society, and while there are many who speak in favour of a final reconciliation, the means of best achieving it are so contested that old divisions appear to have been paradoxically widened rather than diminished. The two novels which are treated in the present study Eduardo Mendoza’s Riña de gatos (An Englishman in Madrid; 2010), and Antonio Muñoz Molina’s La noche de los tiempos (The Night of Memories; 2009) make an important literary contribution to the debate, and although they are very different in tone and style, they evidence a mature, considered approach to the issues. Drawing upon the Bakhtinian concept of chronotope (the organisation of space-time in the novel), this paper will contend that the two works, in their different ways, inscribe and subvert the conventions of the classical historical novel in order to challenge historical myths and open up a dialogic space within which the reader can engage critically with the past. This narrative strategy prevents the war from being plotted as an inevitable tragedy, therefore emphasising the argument made by both novels that, contrary to popular belief, the civil war was not simply the result of a radical polarisation between the mythical “two Spains” eternally at war, but of a complex of factors, both national and international."
