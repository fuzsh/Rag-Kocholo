        "text": "The purpose of this paper is to uncover the mechanisms used by the Francoist regime to seize the chil- dren of its political opponents, as well as to discuss the problem as depicted in contemporary historical novels. In order to achieve these goals, the paper begins with an inquiry into eugenics, as interpreted by the infamous Spanish psychiatrist Antonio Vallejo Nágera. Further, the author reviews the processes through which biological parents (and/or family) lost the legal control over their children, many of whom had their identities changed. Consequently, the analysis focuses on three new historical novels (La voz dormida by Dulce Chacón, Mala gente que camina by Benjamin Prado, and Si a los tres años no he vuelto by Any R. Cañil), which use the mediation of historical memory to recover the remembrance of the lost children of the Francoist regime. Key words: lost children of the Francoist regime; Francoist state terror; historical memory; new historical novel; eugenics; Antonio Vallejo Nágera\n\nAna Cañil published Si a los tres años no he vuelto in 2011, after years of research on female prisons of Franco Spain and speaking with many survivors. Based in historical reality , the novel explores life in female prisons during the immediate postwar years, delving into the experiences of the prisoners as well as the prison director. In this article I examine the role of the body in the novel from several perspectives, incorporating studies on the body by Michel Foucault, Elaine Scarry, and Judith Butler. By looking at the body under control, in pain, and as a cultural subject/outlier, this analysis opens up the understanding of the experience of female prisoners and guards in Franco Spain, revealing points of brutality , manipulation, and agency.\n\nSince 1989, Spain has gone through a process of re-emergence of the memories of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) and Francoism (1939-1975). These newly produced memories challenge the official reading of the civil war, as established during the transition to democracy, as a “collective insanity.” As part of this process, the last three decades have produced numerous novels, documentaries, and journalistic accounts that have brought to the fore the untold stories of the repression during the civil war and its aftermath. This dissertation offers an analysis of the influence of transnational frameworks on the reconfiguration of the cultural memory narratives of the Spanish Civil War. The selection of post-Cold War Spanish cultural texts – narrative fiction, documentary film, photography and journalism – being analyzed in this dissertation, is framed by three emblematic “spaces of transnational memory.” These are: the wars in former Yugoslavia; Forced Disappearance in the Southern Cone; and the remembrance of the Holocaust. Each of these spaces highlights a different contemporary site of agency in the production of memory, namely contemporary civil war, mass grave exhumations, and testimony. In addition, this dissertation posits affect and emotion as important mechanisms in the production of transnational memories. This research argues that these transnational contexts of remembrance serve to reimagine Spain, proposing alternative and more “inclusive” forms of national memory and identity, often in opposition to the current Spanish “constitutional patriotism.” Transnational memory is located within the margins of the nation-state, a space of entanglement between the national and the transnational, and inhabited by those who were excluded from Spanish national identity through the forging of the Spanish nation-state.
