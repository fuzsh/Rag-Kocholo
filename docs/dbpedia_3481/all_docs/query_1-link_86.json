        "text": "Biographical Information of Invited poets to the\n\nXX International Poetry Festival of MedellÃ­n\n\nPOETS OF AFRICA\n\nNIYI OSUNDARE was born in Ikere-Ekiti, Nigeria, in 1947. He is a New Orleans/Nigerian poet, dramatist, critical essayist, and columnist. He is Professor of English at Universities of New Orleans and Ibadan. Osundare is an intensely political poet and a vehement champion for human rights. His award-winning Selected Poems were published by Heinemann in 1992. Osundare's more than two dozen books include his most recent collection of poetry, Days (2008). He is one of the most prominent within the generation of contemporary Anglophone Nigerian poets that emerged after Wole Soyinka, J.P. Clark-Bekederemo, and Gabriel Okara. His poems have won many national and international prizes, among which was the 1986 Commonwealth Poetry Prize. His published works include: I Sing of Change; Songs of the Marketplace; Village Voices; Moonsongs; The Eye of the Earth; The Nib in the Pond; Waiting Laughters; and Midlife.\n\nOsundare draws copiously from the oral tradition, and his imagery and settings are essentially rural. He says his primary purpose is to demystify poetry and make it accessible to the ordinary man for whom he sings. As the voice of the people, his condemnation of the ruling class and of social vices in general is unequivocal and his call for change in every facet of society unprecedented.\n\nALHAJI PAPA SUSSO is a master kora player and an oral historian born on 29 September 1947 in the village of Sotuma Sere in Gambia. He hails from a long line of griots (traditional oral historians) of the Mandinka people and has been playing the kora since the age of five. The Kora is 21-stringed harp-lute, evolved from earlier hunter harps used by the Mandinka people of West Africa. In 1974, he resigned from the group to form âThe Manding Music and Dance Limitedâ, a company dedicated to conducting research and carrying out studies into the history, traditions and ethnomusicology of Manding. He says its aim is also âto carry on the business and to assist the performing artists in the presentation of music and folklore of Manding and to revive, expose and promote a better understanding and appreciation of the music culture of the Mandingâ. Papa Susso has performed in several countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle West, and North America, and in venues such as New York Cityâs Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center in the African Odyssey series production of Sundiata: Liong king of Mali.\n\nIn 1991, he was appointed as Regentâs Lecturer in Ethno musicology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is also the director of the Koriya Musa Research Center in Gambia, which was established in order to promote research into traditional cultures of the area. Today Papa Susso is a goodwill ambassador traveling all over the world, giving both classroom presentations and formal concert performances where he recounts the history of his country and his people, discusses the roles of griots in West African Culture and performs the classic songs of the griot repertoire. He has two albums, Sotuma-Sere which is a mix of imploring praise proverbs and A Gathering of Elders: (Water Lily Acoustics) which mixes ancient kora melodies and African-American rhythms.\n\nMOHAMMED BENNIS was born in FÃ©s, Morocco in 1948. His interest in literature, in particular for lyric, developed already at an early age. During his studies at the Department of Philosophy in FÃ©s he began corresponding with the Syrian poet Adonis (Ali Ahmad Said) who published Bennis' first poems in 1969. Numerous other volumes of verse and essays have followed up to the present - not in French, as is so often the case in the Maghreb, but instead in Arabic. Bennis' relationship to French culture is ambivalent. While he rejects the ideology of francophone policy - which for him represents a form of colonizing globalization - he very much appreciates the French language as such: \"As a modern Arab poet I am committed to French culture and its modernity\".\n\nThis close relationship is reflected in the translations of their own works on which Arab poets are especially dependent if they want to be read outside of their own culture. Several of Bennis' collections of poems have already been translated into French; among them Le don du vide, 1992, for which he received the Moroccan literary award \"Grand prix du livre\" in 1993. In addition, Bennis has made a name for himself as an Arab translator of Abdelwahab Meddeb who writes in French, as well as the French poet Bernard NoÃ«l. Meddeb for his part translated Bennis' poems into French. In Germany, Bennis' poems can be found in two anthologies: \"Zwischen Zauber und Zeichen. Moderne arabische Lyrik von 1945 bis heute\" (2000, t: Between Signs and Magic. Modern Arab Lyric from 1945 to the Present) and \"Die Farbe der Ferne\" (2000, t: The Color of Distance). Bennis' efforts are aimed at the modernization of Arab poetry. He ranks among the most important voices in Arab literature. His writing is characterized by having borrowed from traditional mysticism and surrealism. As a result, his verse is remarkable for its radical succinctness and simultaneous reproduction of the various levels of sense. In 1996 he became a founding member and president of \"Maison de la PoÃ©sie\" in Casablanca. Bennis lives in Rabat where he has been teaching Literature at the university since 1980. Bibliography: Chant pour un jardin de lÂ´eau, 1999; La don du vide, 1999; DÃ©sert au bord de la lumiÃ¨re, 1999; Fleuve entre des funÃ©railles, 2003; Le livre de lâamour, 2008.\n\nPAUL DAKEYO was born in Bafoussam, Cameroon, in 1948. He is a pivotal figure in the postindependence generation of African Writers in France. His poetry of revolutionary love creates a bridge between the writing of combat and the works of the intimate generation of Parisianists. Dakeyoâs collections of poetry include Les Barbeles du Matin, 1973; Chant dâAccusation, 1976; Le Cri Pluriel, 1976; Soweto: Soleils FusillÃ©s, 1977; Jâappartiens au grand jour, 1979; La Femme oÃ¹ jâai mal, 1989 and Les Ombres de la Nuit, 1994. In addition to his writing, Dakeyo was a founding editor of Ãditions Silex and is the editorial director of Ãditions Nouvelles du Sud. These two publishing houses have provided important literary outlets for African Writers.\n\nâSome people ask me, âÂ¿How did you come up with that? Do you enter a state of trance in order to write?â âI answer that form me, itâs simple a matter of putting myself into a context. Just as an interview, you have a person in front of you and something happens. Thereâs a certain chemistry that makes you want to communicate. Itâs the same way with poetry. In poetry, thereâs a total communication. Aime Cesaire once said that the secret of great communication is great combustion. And I think in the case of poetry, thatâs exactly what happens. When something takes place between two people, thereâs a discourse. Writing poetry is like that. Some academics think that all you need is a certain background, then you can write. For them, itâs like building a house. You have the foundations, the cement and the roof. All you need is a mason to put it all together. Well, writing poetry is not all like that. Itâs specialâ¦âÂ\n\nLUÃS CARLOS PATRAQUIM (born 1953, Mozambique) is a journalist and author. He writes in the genres of poetry and drama. Patraquim's poems reflect his life marked by the experience of exile. As a young person he fled to Sweden to escape the war of independence in Mozambique and returned in 1975 after Mozambique had gained independence. In 1986 he left his homeland again, which was continually shaken by crises even after independence, and in which the Marxist Freedom Party had seized power. Since then he has lived in Portugal. While political themes dominate in Patraquim's poetry, he also writes, in addition to poems dealing with the subject of 'exilio melancolico', poems partly inspired by the passion of being in love, which are sometimes openly sexual. Patraquim was awarded the PrÃ©mio Nacional de Poesia, MoÃ§ambique in 1995.\n\nKOUMANTHIO ZEINAB DIALLO was born in 1956 at LabÃ© in Guinea. She hails from a rich poetic tradition. Her first work was dedicated to her children, Dalanda (Lynda), Ousmane (Mawdo), Mamadou (Vieux) and TguidankÃ© (Nene). Koumanthio Zeinab Diallo is a foundation member of the Guinean branch of the PEN Club International, a member of the International Committee of Women Writers and of several other literary associations.

She is poet, short-story writer, playwright and dancer. Her soft, firm voice speaks out in the Great Lakes region. From her library in Louvain-la-Neuve, she writes radio plays in kirundi, broadcast by Studio Ijambo in Bujumbura. Umubanyi niwe muryango (Our neighbours are our family) is the most popular radio programme in Burundi. Twice a week for twenty-five minutes, she recounts the daily life of two families, one Hutu, the other Tutsi. The programme explores their lives from day-to-day, showing how they maintain their friendship despite crises and problems. Since 1997, Marie-Louise Sibazuri has been using this radio programme to try to help break down barriers between Hutus and Tutsis, for the construction of durable peace. Her programmes are more than a story they depict social guidelines to convince listeners that there is always a way to get along.\n\nPATRICIA JABBEH WESLEY was born in Tugbakeh, Maryland County, Liberia in West Africa, in 1955 and grew up in Monrovia, Liberia. She and her family were forced to flee their homeland of Liberia when civil war broke out, and they immigrated to the United States in 1991.

His poems have been published in some outstanding magazines and journals, and he has translated poetry from around the world. A classic autodidact, he went on to hold university posts in French, English and cybernetic art. That good poetic works should remain concealed from the public for many years may seem strange but it is not uncommon. When he was 23 years-old, a university published PatiÃ±oâs first book in a very small and modest edition and afterwards he self-published the rest of his books, including an anthology of African-French speaking poets, with the aid of a computer. Rafael PatiÃ±o has written five books of good poetry but they barely exist in Colombiaâs poetic canon.\n\nPatiÃ±oâs poetry is suffused with sardonic humor and peopled by imaginary beings and animals that perform marvelous deeds; language is freely associative or distorted, creating odd yet vivid images. The poet has, in sum, found his own quite peculiar form. PatiÃ±o is certainly a poet who as he says in one of his poems, in his quite characteristic manner, â[is a] solsticed excrescence of humanity, /gathering the froth of miserable cries.â\n\nDARÃO JARAMILLO AGUDELO was born in Santa Rosa de Osos in the province of Antioquia in northwest Colombia in 1947.Â He studied Law and Economics at the Universidad Javeriana in BogotÃ¡.Â Dario Jaramillo Agudelo published his first book of poetry, Historias, in 1974.Â Four years later his second book of verse, Tratado de retÃ³rica, received the Premio Nacional de PoesÃ­a.Â His debut novel, 1983's, La muerte de Alec - followed by several novels, including Cartas cruzadas and most recently La voz interior, 2006, - proved him also to be a remarkable prose writer.Â In spite of this, as a writer, DarÃ­o Jaramillo Agudelo did not want to have to depend on royalties, scholarships and prize money, which is why, since 1985, he has earned his living as a cultural representative for the National Bank of Columbia.Â In 1995 Jaramillo Agudelo was made a corresponding member of the Colombian Academy of Languages.Â He lives in BogotÃ¡.Â DarÃ­o Jaramillo Agudelo's writing overcomes the gap which today separates poetry and prose; he lets the poetic stimulate his literature.Â In an interview with the Mexican newspaper 'La Jornada' he admitted, \"I'm convinced that the only literary genre is that of poetry.Â A novel, an essay, a reportage is only valuable if it conveys poetic emotion\".Â However, his novels are not sentimental.Â They are dominated by topics having to do with the violent nature of everyday Columbian life, a subject that is also pursued by Columbia's own literary movement, the 'literatura de la violencia'.Â Dario Jaramillo Agudelo became popular above all through his series 'Poemas de amor'.Â\n\nBOB HOLMAN was born in LaFollette, Tennessee, USA, in 1948. Once dubbed the âPoetry Czarâ by The Village Voice, Holman has received NEA support for his new poetry media project, World of Poetry, the first digital poetry anthology of its kind.\n\nAmong his most important works are his latest collection of poems, A Couple of Ways of Doing Something, and his first CD, In With the Out Crowd.

Holman won three Emmys producing Poetry Spots for WNYC-TV and earned a Grammy nomination for a release from his poetry record label, Mouth Almighty/Mercury Records (1995-98).\n\nHolman was founding editor of the NYC Poetry Calendar, which curated reading series at St. Marks Church, the Whitney Museum, the Public Theater, among others, and is also the Artistic Director of the Bowery Arts and Science.

He studied physics at the Universidad de Antioquia and has written three books of poems. Particularly notable is his first book of poems Del huerto de Van Gogh (âFrom Van Goghâs Orchardâ) in which he writes nocturnes, epitaphs, acrostics and also S.O.S. messages and grafitti. In this book, a beautiful map of the internal geography of the Dutch painter, Gil seizes his voice and expresses the enthralling vital experience of the painter in almost conversational poems.Â The poems embody a life full of deprivation and obsessions; it is an innovative book that takes us close to an artist who survived on the edge of insanity and sanity in an interesting historical period. Other of his poetry books are: Ecce Infans, 1996; and Coctel de versos para la mesa 3, 2002. He is a polyphonic poet who experiments with language but in a clear and direct style charged with irony. His sharply perceptive humour tends to take the reader by surprise and he never abuses metaphor. The poems are capsules of grace and intelligence that strike the reader by exposing the theater of the world without descending to the pathos we are used to in a culture of lachrymose and ambiguous morality. In his second book, Ecce Infans, the poet returns to the context of childhood and in short poems, children talk with their fresh and free language about the stains in the world of adults. It is a book that has the power to reveal the greatness of childrenâs minds and takes us into a luminous region.\n\nQUITO NICOLAAS was born in San Nicolas, Aruba and left at the age of 17 years for The Netherlands.

He has published the books of poetry Herido Ã¡rbol; The Garden of the Rose; Future Sea; and the lyrical essays, Treatise of Angels and A Star by the Moon, are characteristic of the poetic maturity with which he unwinds the symbols he finds on his way to give us a song of love longing for the creative mystery. For four years he has worked with the students of Philosophy and Literature in the Open Class of Poetry âDÃ©xima Musa.â\n\nMARCO MEJÃA (Caldas, Antioquia, Colombia).

Always intense, his first poems were the poems of a young man trying to find a place in the world â profound and sorrowful prose poems expressing a boundless solitude. He was trying to define himself, while we all were just detached companions, but our generation saw itself in that vertiginous prose where little by little his childhood and the omnipresence of God appeared. They were a God â a word that for him should always be written with a capital letter, like a menacing eye â that he condemned and a childhood to which he did not want to return. But through the sadness of his poetry gradually arose, sharply clear, the loving look at the other, at the war that even God could not stop, at the maimed children, the insanity, the rivers of blood, the country â slowly abandoning his own circumstances to embrace others, to ask himself the anguished question of how and where to find our voice.\n\nRENATO SANDOVAL (Lima, Peru, 1957).

She read Communication Studies. A co-founder of the International Poetry Festival of MedellÃ­n, she was its executive director and a member of editorial board of the Prometeo review until 1999. She has published five books of poetry, three of them bilingual into German, Swedish and Serbian, and numerous poems in anthologies, reviews and newspapers of several Latin American and European countries. Her poems have been translated into German, Swedish, French, Galician, Portuguese, Italian, Macedonian, Serbian and Croatian. She co-directed the video La orilla opuesta (The farther shore). She produces poetry events for the International Poetry Days in MalmÃ¶, Sweden.\n\nColombian poetry written by women has suffered from an excess of whimpering and sentimentality, or from an empty and repetitive bedroom eroticism. Ãngela GarcÃ­aâs poetry is happily free from both of these regrettable features. To begin with, her verbal economy is outstanding; in many cases she even does without defining adjectives and articles. But her search of precision does not affect the musical quality of her verses. This will to condense and leave out the debris is a method which sometimes may imply certain problems of comprehension for the reader:Â I am harassed /by the name without equivalent / the advancement / ignored language / initiation chamber / name without phoneme / sign / like sun or blackness / without resemblance.\n\nGUSTAVO GARCÃS was born in Medellin, in 1957. He is a lawyer with a masterâs degree in political studies and has been a professor of literature and political science in several universities, and works in the National Solicitors office of Human Rights and Ethnic Matters. One of the most original of Colombian contemporary poets, he has published five books of remarkably condensed and deliciously ironic poems â quite opposed to the Spanish-American rhetorical traditionâ the second of which, Breves dÃ­as (Brief Days) was awarded the important Colombian Institute of Culture National Poetry Prize in 1992. The most visible feature of GarcÃ©sâ poetry â akin to the poetry of William Carlos Williams and his Colombian translator JosÃ© Manuel Arango, to Japanese tankas and haiku, and Chinese poetryâ is the exactness and peculiar transcendence of his poems. The reader is forced to go back to them, or rather is drawn into them: GarcÃ©sâ poems are like tiny doors which open to wide avenues; they have incredible powers of suggestion. Re-reading them, one finds proof of their peculiar poetic efficacy; behind their deceptively simple surface, there is a great deal of work, a vigilant observation of the world and of people. The poet captures or evokes the fleeting instant, or the essence of a person, or an action. The poems are ample windows to reality. His own feelings, subtly stated, are viewed with tenderness or irony, and humor, always humor.\n\nJOSÃ LIBARDO PORRAS was born in TÃ¡mesis, Antioquia, Colombia, in 1959. He studied Spanish and Literature at the University of Antioquia. Narrative works: Es tarde en San Bernardo, 1984; Seis historias de amor, todas edificantes, 1996 (Winner of the Literary Contest of the CÃ¡mara de Comercio de MedellÃ­n); Hijos de la nieve, 2000; Historias de la cÃ¡rcel Bellavista (National Prize of Literature), 2004; Happy birthday, capo, 2008.

Some concepts about her work are: âThe rupture represented by her poetry seems to show a transformation in her aimed at opening and developing an active interior life in which she, free from the masculine domination, can create from her feminine experience.â (Blanca WiethÃ¼chter). âSensuality, plenitude, eroticism soak her poems, being a celebration and an exaltation of love. The body becomes an instrument of knowledge, the surrender is mutual, the loving word opens, peoples, discovers the feminine body, final learns and apprehends her body the otherâs bodyâ (Giancarla de Quiroga). âIn the geography she offers us we perceive the becoming of the hymn of the body, of bodies, but also the longing for the ethereal, luminous and winged, imaginary body, the body of dreams. // But the exceptional thing is that these bodies are only one: The body of the poet extending, expanding, multiplying itself. The other is the reflection of herselfâ (Gary Daher Canedo).\n\nJAIRO GUZMÃN was born in Medellin in 1961. He studied Mathematics at the National University of Colombia in his hometown. He has published books entitled Coro de ahorcados (âChoir of hanged menâ) and Todo paisaje es la elegancia del ojo (âEvery landscape is the eyeâs eleganceâ), and his poems have been published in many Colombian and foreign reviews and on various websites. In 1995 he was invited to China by the local Society of Authors, and he has appeared at international poetry events in Helsinki, Curitiba (Brazil), and Quito (Ecuador). He currently publishes his work on a website. Since he published Coro de ahorcados, his first book of poems, Jairo GuzmÃ¡n has continued his inquiry into the basic human sense of intuition, the cypher of living things. That said, the source of the subterranean world of his poetry is actually something else â music, a sonorous river running through his verse.\n\nGuzmÃ¡n is unusual, both as a poet and in his form of expression. âPoems travel through the umbilical cord,â he offers up frankly, observing that the navel is the origin of poetry: âeverything enters through it.â This is the reason he called his website, âthe navel of the fish.â As he claims, âI learned everything through the navel, when I was in the womb.â GuzmÃ¡n writes poetry from a sense of this prenatal stage of existence and developed his early voice through images, verses, personal experiences, all of them connected in his proteic imagination. He speaks from the navel, which he considers the seat of his conscience.\n\nHÃCTOR FAGOT (Fredonia, Antioquia, Colombia, 1961). Took part in the writersâ workshop Fernando GonzÃ¡lez, hosted by Manuel MejÃ­a Vallejo in Otraparte, Envigado. In 2001, he published the book Internal Affairs. According to VÃ­ctor Bustamante: âHÃ©ctor Fagot expresses the radioactive power of his personal experiences, recovers the music of bygone days but without any nostalgia, but with the nitric acid of what is left from the stale leftovers of those instants. Fagotâs poetry is based on his experience: He thinks, like Pavese, that to write it is necessary that his word has passed through his body.â\n\nGABRIEL ARTURO CASTRO (BogotÃ¡, 1962). He is a poet, essayist and Social anthropologist from the Universidad Nacional, reviewer of books of anthropology, literature and education, art workshop host.

Books of poetry: Book of Alchemy and Solitude, 1992; Alchemy of the Half Moon, 1996; After the Verses of Job, 2009 (Porfirio Barba Jacob National Poetry Prize). In this last book, he suggests to the reader a poetic search of the exhausting and long tragedy of Job which is that of all men marked by a history of mutual aggression, but at the same time, as one goes deeper into the arduous prairie of suffering, offers diamonds of pensive rest for those who, like no doubt so many brave readers and living beings, decline to accept as a final result the assault of death wielding its black mirrors everywhereÂ to placate with its old siren song, once and for all, the moaners who do not dare raise their voice like the poet.\n\nCLAUDIA TRUJILLO (MedellÃ­n, Colombia, 1963). She is a poet, essayist architect from the National University of Colombia, MedellÃ­n. Co-founder and co-publisher of the poetry reviews Gyrfalcon, Digital Whispers and Poetics.

Although people he knew insisted that he stay in the city, he decided to return to his native land ten years later.\n\nIn his prizewinning book, Encuentros en los senderos de Abya Yala, he writes: I speak from the recognition of the Amerindian face, / from the indigenous world of America (Abya Yala) . . ./ Here is my song and in my hands the diverse dream, / the intense voice of ancient times, here in my steps is the sweat / of reaffirmation, the throbbing of the defined root, /the look at the serene horizon, / the invitation to multiply encounters / and to increase mutual respect wherever human life breathes...\n\nMAYRA SANTOS FEBRES (born 1966) is a Puerto Rican professor of literature, poet, novelist, and critic who has garnered fame at home and abroad.

He is a co-founder of the International Poetry Festival of MedellÃ­n. Several poetry reviews have published his oracular poems, and he has been invited to a handful of international poetry festivals. He also leads poetry and poetry appreciation workshops. Ever since his poems were first featured in MedellÃ­n reviews,\n\nHis first poems, written between 1986 and 1998 and collected in Los elementos perdidos, demonstrate a method of expression based on the image, open to sudden flights of fantasy. His poetry speaks of what is not obvious, it reveals prayerâs underlying dialogue; these are songs that redeem us from our daily disarray. Typical of his first book are two poems that confirm this: âInvocationâ and âLord of Lightningâ. In the first one we see his talent for the poetic image: Lost in amazement / I bow / before the image and in the poem âLord of Lightningâ the poet extends his gaze towards the infinite;Â he feels the universe throbbing: Oh!, Old Lord who pursue / the stirring rhythm of the woods / announcing the fear of prayer / where every silence is truth / and sustained delirium.\n\nBERENICE PINEDA was born in Bello, Antioquia, Colombia, in 1969.

In 2001, she obtained the Roberto Sosa Young Poetry Prize. She now works as a translator and professor of French, English, Italian and Spanish. Helena Ramos has asserted that she ââ¦abstains from loving passionate suffering, rejects renunciation, demolishes the myth that women are born to die of love and that we enjoy our sorrows, all of this with images, not with proclamations. She also questions the masculinity of the lover, that mythicised, magnified, invulnerable and rational masculinity: âA nest of answers / widens your breast / I try to find in them / the answer.â She even questions the very dynamics of a love relationshipÂ not presented any longer as the height of happiness but as a painful, sometimes ineffective adjustment: ââ¦he who insists I donât understand / what arm I must cut / to fit into your front.â And another discovery even more anguishing: ââ¦to be together / is not the contrary of being alone.â All of these bitter revelations have nothing to do with the rejection of affection, because in other of her poems there flourish brief loving exaltations, created with verbal economy and framed in landscapes of deep anxiety.\n\nWALTHER ESPINAL was born in MedellÃ­n in 1980. He study Philosophy and Literature at the University of Antioquia. He has attended several literary workshops in his city. Poetry books: La danza de Narciso, 2009; El pirata y otros poemas, 2010.

Her book Puerto Calcinado has been partially translated into English, French, Italian, Macedonian, Arabic and Catalanian. As Piedad Bonnett says: âAndrea Cote is nowadays one of the most important young voices of our poetry. Her work recreates, in an ambiguous language, full of meaning, a very personal world, of an intimate tendency, full of recurrent feelings that point out the urgency of its phantoms, the need to transform the experience in the wordâ. Moreover, in the words of Juan Manuel Roca âHer poems, attentive to the passing by of a rough time, reveal an impulse for not concealing neither tragedy nor oblivion in which it wraps our individual and collective drama. It is hers a reflective poetry that seeks the expresiÃ³n of a calcinated landscape in fair images, in diverse rythmsâ.\n\nPOETS OF ASIA\n\nU SAM OEUR was born in Cambodia in 1936 and grew up in a farming family.

The prose poet belongs to a new generation of modern Arabic women poets, who express their individual experiences as women and intellectuals in the Arab world. What gives Hala Mohammad's poetry its unique character is its spontaneity. Instead of complex reflections there are ideas which flicker momentarily into life: colours, sense impressions, smells and movements are evoked and connected to the manifold and recurring themes which flow through Mohammad's poetry like leitmotifs. These include memory, which also plays an important role in her fimic work, emotions like fear, alienation and loneliness, as well as a profound sense of grief and having lost oneâs way: Â»On this morning / light broke without mercy / with clear eyes / I saw / my solitudeÂ« (from: Â»The Soul Has No MemoryÂ«). The presence of the Â»otherÂ«, manifest even in his absence, bound to the narrator in love, can always be felt. In her poetry Mohammad rejects complex syntax, relying instead on simple expressions. Modern Arabic dominates, but is free of dialect.\n\nAK WELSAPAR was born on 19th September 1956 in the former Soviet Republic of Turkmenistan.

Ak wrote many critical articles about the enormous ecological problems that he had exposed in Central Asia â the shockingly high rates of infant and maternal death and the reason behind these awful statistics â overuse of chemicals and pesticides in agriculture. The overuse was caused by the monoculture of cotton â which required enormous amounts of chemical fertilizers, defoliant butifos (a substance similar to Agent Orange) and pesticides. Cotton monoculture in Central Asia, which was ordered by the Soviet regime to cover the cotton needs of all Soviet Union, led to deep-seated ecological problems in the whole region, problems that rapidly turned into global ecological disasters, the most noticeable of which is the subsequent drying-out of the Aral Sea.\n\nHis poetic works are: Which of us will dive deepest?, 1982; The first drop, 1983; The Round House, 1996; Longing for Another Sky, 2005; If I Only Were a White Bird!, a book for children, 2006.

In the words of Mizanur Rahman, \"... Quamruzzaman Swapan is a fervent exponent of both romanticism and realism. Heâs been writing poetry since 1980, and has published three books that have been widely welcomed by both public and critics. Though his poetry he has attacked the modernism of Dhaka and the evils of modern society. It is regrettable that the poems written by modern Bangladeshi are mostly incomprehensible. The common reader cannot understand the meaning of some poems that are, apparently, always inscrutable. Most of those poets donât even know what their writings mean. Maybe theyâre expecting the critics to clarify their obscurity. Long foreign words are now introduced in Bangladeshi as symbols or metaphors that mean nothing. I have great confidence in Qumruzzaman because he limits himself to be concrete. In name of expressionism, surrealism sensualism, one does not have to use incomprehensible words in poetry in order to generate pedantic applause instead of making the poem be understood because of itâs well used rimes and reasons. Even analysts get confused in the complex background of modern poetry. But Quamruzzaman poems have the necessary qualities to convince the readers that their task is not going to be vain. He is the promising young poet of Bangladesh that will be able to reflect with a clear perspective the images of our time and our land in the different ways and tones of his poetry.\"\n\nNATHALIE HANDAL is an award-winning poet, playwright, and writer born in 1969 in Haiti but her family is from Palestine and Lebanon.

Among his books of poems translated into Spanish one finds Jardines errantes (El TucÃ¡n de Virginia) and El reino imaginalÂ (PoligrafÃ­a). Translator into French of the books by Octavio Paz: Libertad bajo palabra, Ãguila o sol, El laberinto de la soledad, A la orilla del mundo. âTo translate poetry is one of the most complex and risky linguistic operations possible. To each language corresponds a particular organization of the historical experience. When we find ourselves before a particular order, as is the case of a poem, it is possible to copy the apparent structure of the text: for example, that of a sonnet. At present, when poems are open structures, a combination or occupation of the page is reproduced. In short, one can imitate the productive process, but what to do will all the rest? The word âfreedomâ, for example, has a different meaning for Paz and for AndrÃ© Breton. Each word has a phonic and graphic personality in its own language, beside the concepts it contains. If this were not enough, the poet charges it with emotional or subjective values that are added to the collective connotations. In every poem two languages are intertwined, the groupâs and the poetâs, this last similar to a foreign language. Poetry is in itself a foreign language. There cannot be a perfect translation, capable of transmitting all the senses of the poem. The translator must commit a true affront, although every reading is really already a translation.â\n\nLASSE SÃDERBERG was born in Sweden in 1931. He is a poet and translator from a variety of languages, was born in 1931 and eventually settled in MalmÃ¶ where he started and for the last nineteen years has been the organizer and artistic leader of the International Poetry Days in MalmÃ¶. He has published â in addition to translations and non-fiction â more than twenty volumes of poetry.\n\nHis most recent collections are Stenarna i Jerusalem (2002) and Breven frÃ¥n Artur (2007). Among his recent volumes of translations is a selection of Gonzalo Rojas. Lasse SÃ¶derbergâs many prizes and awards for translations and his own work include Bellmanpriset (1996).\n\nNANNI BALESTRINI was born in Milan, Italy, in 1935 and lives in Paris. He has been one of the principal editors of the literary magazine Il Verri and has contributed to many periodicals and journals. From 1966 to 1968 he edited, together with Alfredo Giuliani, the magazine Quindici. Balestriniâs poems were included in the celebrated anthology I Novissimi, 1961. One of the propelling forces of the Gruppo â63, he has organized many conferences and exhibitions. His book publications include Il sasso appeso, 1961; Come si agisce, 1963; Tristano, 1966; Ma noi facciamone unâaltra, 1968; Vogliamo tutto, 1971; La violenza illustrate, 1976; Le ballate della signorina Richmond, 1977; Ipocalisse, 1986; Il ritorno della Signorina Richmond, 1987; Lâeditore, 1989, and Il pubblico del labirinto, 1992.\n\nJULES DEELDER is undoubtedly one of the Netherlandsâ best-known poets. He owes much of his fame to public appearances, in which he combines a dandyish pose with a curious mixture of popular city humor and irony, dished up in an uncut Rotterdam accent. He is arguably the godfather of Dutch performance poets. There is an unmistakable link between Deelderâs poetry and the Dutch ultra-realists of the 1950s, and an even stronger kinship with the carefree anarchism of the 1960s. Many of his poems are on an exciting collision course with established taste. Apparently, Jules Deelder has found the recipe for successfully combining a deadpan exterior and crass realism with the comic effect of irony. He calls himself a âneon realistâ, a âneon romanticâ and a âneon comedianâ. Deelder has a rare command of register, mimicking the language of soaps as effortlessly as that of military rhetoric or the quasi-profound verbiage of esoteric or antiquated cultures. He does this in his poetry as well as in his prose, which never fails to betray the poet.\n\nDeelderâs work often tends toward cabaret, but was not cabaret the mainspring of a movement like Dadaism? With the Dadaists he shares a fondness for the absurd, born from a relentless defiance of established high art. He has thus made of himself a kind of enfant terrible of the Dutch poetic scene, but one that cannot be ignored. Several of his poems have achieved the status of âmodern classicâ, and if he is not one of the Netherlandsâ most read poets, he certainly is one of the most heard.\n\nERLING KITTELSEN was born in Norway in 1946. He had his debut as a poet in 1970. He has since than published several poetry cycles and collections, as well as fables, dramatic works and translations of poetry.\n\nHe is known for his dialogues, partly with colleagues and partly in the work with the translation of poetry from distant languages in relation to the Nordic language area like Arabian, Persian, Korean, Lithuanian and Sumerian. He also has poetical dialogue with the most ancient poetical traditions in the Nordic Countries â the Old Norse Poetic Edda where at first he translates the old text and than presents a contemporary literary answer. Erling is known as a writer who renews language, a poet and storyteller. He is a writer who moves in untraditional ways, both with the language in his books and dramatic works and his literary activity through events and happenings. His last play has been translated and performed several times in the Middle East.\n\nHe has received several literary prices amongst them The Aschehoug Prize (awarded on a binding recommendation by the Norwegian Critics Organization) and The Dobloug Prize (awarded by the Swedish Academy).\n\nVLADIMIR MARKU was born in Albania in 1950.

He is a poet, essayist, translator, publisher, and professor. âHis verses are quiet varied in measure, if not in content. Although nearly all the poems here are free verse, we also come across an occasional quatrain. Hochelâs writing is not concerned with broad philosophical questions or with political issues. Rather, his verses might be called existential in nature. Hochel deals with the often bizarre side of everyday life, as well as with the psychological double binds which people who are close place upon one another.â (Michael Sosa).\n\nUWE KOLBE was born in East Berlin in 1957 to family that sailed the inland waterways.

She made her debut in 1998 with the quietly mumbling poetry collection Tatoveringer (Tattoos) which in 2002 was followed by a very different, enthusiastic and extroverted collection Golden Delicious; her great breakthrough arrived with Moestrup's third book, Kingsize, in 2006, a powerful presentation of quality, which deservedly brought her the newly founded Montana Prize for Literature this Spring.\n\nMoestrup holds a degree in the history of literature and is one of Denmark's leading Rilke experts, and, as she writes in the poem 'A Bite of the Banana': 'Call me intellectual, I do it myself./ I can take it.' And the most delightful thing about her poetry is that sheÂ does not distance herself from intellectuality, but firmly interweaves it into a brilliantly mastered, traditional poetic practice: harmonious : musically existential pain, and a playful intercourse with (traditional!) avantgardish strategies, such as pastiche and the ready-made. One poem refers to the children's game of 'Mess-Mother' in which the players entangle themselves with each other really thoroughly, and Kingsize as a whole and, now and then, the individual poem may well also seem like a refined and hilarious round of 'Mess-Mother' for 1 sharp intellectual, 1 sensitive main poet and 1 crafty avantgardist, all by the name of Mette Moestrup: 1,2,3, tangle!\n\nJENNY TUNEDAL was born in Sweden in 1973. He published her first book, Hejdande, hejdande sken, in 2003. This year she received the Prince Eugene Cultural Award for her work as poet, critic and editor of LyrikvÃ¤nnen. Her tenure as editor of this journal, one of the oldest (founded 1954) and most prestigious in Scandinavia, has been characterized by an intense interest in the poetry of other nations, including American poetry. Tunedal has translated the poetry of American poets such as Sylvia Plath, Claudia Rankine and Emily Dickinson. This is how she describes her poetics: \"Poetry is maybe, to attempt, rushing against the language walls. Poetry is thoughts that continue to continue. Poetry is written on its paper, without a doubt, and doubts and hesitates, a wavering writ. The poem lays still and moves. Poetry is maybe, dubiously gray. Like when black and white and light and darkness merge, like when snow does not quite cover the ground, like night before it falls, like faces that are shadowed by memory. That is one example. The poem is worse than that.\"\n\nÂ\n\nCAROLINE BIRD, who was born in 1986, was a winner of the Foyles Young Poets of the Year Award in 1999 and 2000, and the Peterloo Poets Competition for Young Poets in 2002, 2003 and 2004.
