T. J. Demos, Return to the Postcolony\n\nColombia is a country of ghosts. The violent deaths of thousands of people lost to the country’s decades-­old ideological, political, and social conflicts haunt its rivers, mountains, towns, history, and memory. Over the last forty years, Colombia has experienced severe violence, in part due to the expansion of powerful drug cartels that have spread terror, infiltrated the economy, reshaped the social landscape, and fueled ongoing conflicts among guerrilla groups, right-­wing paramilitaries, and the army. Despite important signs of progress, such as the 2003 demobilization of the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC) and the peace agreement with the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC)—the latter the oldest active guerrilla group in the hemisphere—forced disappearances, displacement, and human rights violations of all kinds persist. The numbers are staggering. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (2015, 83) estimates that from 1985 to 2014 there were 6,044,200 internally displaced people in Colombia, which means that more than 10 percent of the country’s population has been forced to leave their homes due to violence. Forced disappearance is another brutal manifestation of this violence. Record keeping has been poor, and statistics differ, but as of September 15, 2018, the Centro Nacional de Memoria Histórica (2018) reported 80,472 conflict-­related missing persons.1 Though shocking, the true number is thought to be much higher. Based on its experience carrying out special sessions to register disappearances in specific conflict zones, the Colombian Office of the Attorney General warned that in hard-­hit areas, some 60 to 65 percent of disappearances went unreported (Haugaard and Nicholls 2010). 1\n\n2 Haunting without Ghosts\n\nAs is often and tragically the case, the majority of the disappeared are civilians (79,245 out of 80,472), particularly human rights defenders and young men and teenage girls in rural areas (Centro Nacional de Memoria Histórica 2018). Apart from catastrophic human consequences, the conflict generated a proliferation of works attempting to denounce, challenge, comprehend, aestheticize, or profit from such violence. In this book, I examine selected works by Colombian cultural practitioners who since the late 1990s, and especially in the new millennium, have been addressing the ethical and aesthetic challenges that historical violence poses to cultural representation by appealing to spectrality as a productive mode of storytelling. In this sense, I owe a profound debt of intellectual gratitude to Rory O’Bryen’s Literature, Testimony and Cinema in Contemporary Colombian Culture: Spectres of La Violencia. In his seminal work, O’Bryen (2008) engages with the works of novelists and filmmakers born in the 1940s and 1950s, a time when La Violencia, with a capital V, was ravaging the country.2 Drawing primarily from Jacques Derrida’s Specters of Marx and the works of other Marxist scholars, such as Fredric Jameson, O’Bryen argues that “notions of spectrality can provide conduits for exploring the insistence of La Violencia in contemporary Colombian cultural discourse” (2008, 17). Through this lens, he analyzes literary and cinematic works produced from the 1960s to the late 1990s that, in one way or another, turn to ghosts and to haunting to frame their discourse about historical violence. As O’Bryen points out, however, attempts to “give voice to the spectre” on the part of these writers and filmmakers are often “infelicitous” (77). The works examined by O’Bryen struggle with the ghosts they conjure, frequently becoming “collective exorcism[s]” (13) that end up demonizing, laying to rest, or expelling the repressed histories they so effectively invoke. Instead of welcoming the ghosts and the foreclosed stories of violence they conjure, the invocation these narratives perform may at times act not as “a way of giving voice to a spectre [but] as a way of destroying it” (18). I take O’Bryen’s premise further by broadening its breadth and scope in two central ways: first, by extending its temporal framework; and, second, by reframing spectrality primarily as a mode of storytelling in which ghosts may or may not be present. As the title of his book suggests, O’Bryen limits his discussion so that violence remains circumscribed to that concrete and defining period of La Violencia in Colombian history (1948– 1958). O’Bryen’s lens remains focused on how this complex, poorly understood, and often-­repressed moment haunts the works of authors who grew up during this troubled time, shaping their (mis)understandings of the forms of violence they would come to witness and face decades later. In my\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nown work, I argue that this relationship between certain characteristics of spectrality and La Violencia can be productively extended to the modern armed conflict, from its unofficial beginning in the early 1980s to its much-­ publicized—yet still incomplete and somewhat botched—ending with the signing of the peace agreements between the government of Juan Manuel Santos and FARC in 2016. This book also covers a broader scope by including artistic works by Juan Manuel Echavarría, Beatriz González, and Erika Diettes and by beginning, chronologically speaking, where O’Bryen left off: in the new millennium. In essence, I seek to further explore the productive relationship among spectrality, violence, and cultural production outlined by O’Bryen by continuing to think about how, why, and to what extent historical violence continues to haunt cultural production in Colombia. I argue that a growing body of work is increasingly using representational techniques associated with spectrality, thus setting the ground for a constructive hauntology of historical violence in the realms of aesthetic representation and cultural production in Colombia and beyond. In the last two decades, cultural producers as diverse as novelists (Evelio Rosero), filmmakers (William Vega, Jorge Forero, and Felipe Guerrero), and artists ( Juan Manuel Echavarría, Beatriz González, and Erika Diettes) have produced notable works that, though varied in scope and medium, share both a concern for that which can no longer be seen—but which lingers—and a will to account for the vanishings and silences that constitute Colombia’s recent history. Despite the many differences between these aesthetic projects, the common use of representational techniques that weave disappearance, ambiguity, and critical reflection into the narrative fabric converges into a visual and literary grammar that, though broad, remains distinctive. By exploring the limits and opportunities of this hauntology, I posit that the proposed framework is a valuable tool to better understand and address the complex relation between representation and historical violence from an ethically informed perspective, which is at the core of much contemporary cultural work. Building on Jacques Derrida’s landmark postulates on the specter and on the work of scholars such as Avery Gordon and T. J. Demos, I call this mode of storytelling “spectral realism.” Spectral realism should not be confused with the fantastic, or with its famous “magical” predecessor. Spectral realism is a mode of storytelling that takes the ghost seriously but not literally. Rather, it formally assumes the disruptive potential of the specter, shifting the focus from what the ghost is to what the specter does. As Alberto Ribas-­Casasayas and Amanda Petersen explain, spectrality “rises as an aesthetic opposed to conditions or\n\n4 Haunting without Ghosts\n\nmoods generated by military, political, or economic violence in the context of modernity. It is an aesthetic that seeks ways to counteract erasure, silencing, and forgetting that eschews melancholic attachment to loss. It seeks to construct itself as an alternative to the linear, hierarchical, and rationalistic. It also looks to subvert potentially alienating realistic or documentary representations of the past by creating a deeper engagement with the realities suppressed by the simplified plots of market-­driven cultural production” (2016b, 6). The language of the specter is thus justified not by the presence of ghosts in these works but by the use of the ghostly as a means of parsing the complex interactions among representational practices, historical violence, and ethical concerns. These works do not speak of ghosts. However, in the disruptive force of spectrality, they all find a way to explore the unresolved absences and truncated histories that haunt them. Like Colombia, these works are spaces haunted by the voices and demands of those who refuse to vanish despite no longer being present. As a concept, spectral realism has no evolutionary or chronological implications. Spectral realism is not an overcoming or a more accomplished version of other kinds of realism. It is part of an ongoing search for strategies and perspectives that allow cultural practitioners to revisit, interrogate, and reframe the societies and conflicts of their time. I use the term “realism” because it differentiates the spectral from the fantastic and supernatural and highlights the will to convey history and memory in the context of extreme historical violence, as well as the ethical anxieties around the representation of atrocities at the core of this book’s selected works and of realist projects. Therefore, if at first “spectral realism” sounds like an oxymoron, the concept proves fruitful when thinking about works that are deeply concerned with the reality of their time but, unlike other efforts, understand such reality as fundamentally encompassing the voices and stories of those who are “no-­longer-­not-­yet-­there” (Derrida 2006), and that conceive artistic work as the disruptive and transformative conjuring of these repressed and expelled forces. The selection of works in this volume does not intend to be exhaustive or prescriptive. I do not claim that these works constitute a movement with explicit goals and rules. In Colombia, there is no spectral manifesto. Furthermore, the artists that are the focus of this investigation have not been previously grouped together by critics, and even though in most, though not all, cases they are familiar with each other’s work, they do not necessarily see similarities, much less influences, among them. Rather, I have carefully selected the works from the broad and extensive cultural production that relates to violence in the last twenty years in the country because of the\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nindividuals’ interest in and formal experimentation with the four disruptive axes most associated with spectrality: a profound distrust of vision, the challenging of the spatial coordinates of what Jacques Derrida productively calls an “ontopology of presence” (2006, 103), the upending of the linear chronology of modernity, and a deeply rooted ethical anxiety that reflects upon the reach and possibilities of justice beyond the limits of the law. The haunting works of Evelio Rosero, William Vega, Jorge Forero, Felipe Guerrero, Juan Manuel Echavarría, Beatriz González, and Erika Diettes have left a profound imprint on Colombia’s ethical and aesthetic landscape and have much to offer to the ongoing global conversation about the imbrications and tensions among representation, historical violence, and ethics. More Than One Hundred Years of Solitude and Violence No imaginaba que era más fácil empezar una guerra que terminarla. Gabriel García Márquez, Cien años de soledad\n\nColombian cultural production is haunted by violence. Colombia is a country of missing people and silenced stories, but it is also a country of survivors and storytellers. In La narrativa de Gabriel García Márquez: Edificación de un arte nacional popular,3 Ángel Rama (1987) dates the first literary “boom” in Colombia to 1953, five years after the assassination of Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, a presidential candidate and populist leader whose violent death unleashed the period known as La Violencia (1948–1958). This era was marked by a political struggle between the two major political parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives, that took on the proportions of a civil war. Exact numbers are not known, but some have estimated that in ten years, La Violencia took the lives of two hundred thousand people. Inquiring into the effect this conflict had on literature and art, Rama notes: “El efecto es en primer término el de un extraordinario acrecentamiento de la producción literaria de un país, un país como Colombia que tenía muy escasa producción narrativa, que no tenía editoriales, que no tenía sistemas de comunicación literaria perfectamente organizados. En ese sentido hay que decir que este proceso significa un cambio en la situación creadora del país. El país se apresuró a crear más. Además, casi todos los escritores atendieron a una serie de sucesos y trataron de expresarlos, de contarlos, de manifestarlos en sus obras” (1987, 81). Violence as subject matter was not new. But the amount of work being produced and the perspective that predominated made these works distinct. In “Nación y narración de la violencia en Colombia,” María Helena\n\n6 Haunting without Ghosts\n\nRueda examines how the representation of violence changed in the period identified by Rama as compared to the treatment violence had received in the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth. She maintains that throughout this earlier period, violence formed part of the discourse of the founding of the nation and in fact was not portrayed as a problem (Rueda 2008, 346). Violence was seen as an element of social cohesion whose excesses were rationalized as necessary, even heroic. Furthermore, the nation was regarded as a safeguard against such violence, and the most painful episodes were relegated to the distant past as part of the foundational myth of the nation. During La Violencia, the discourse gravitated toward a political partisanship in which the project of national foundation became increasingly distant and improbable. This turn prompted a discursive crisis that led to the emergence of new textual discourses that could no longer contain the reasons for the bloodshed within a cohesive national project. The very ambiguity of the expression “La Violencia” points to the crisis it designates.4 Its enunciation implies the impossibility of assigning agency or responsibility for the events and of containing, explaining, or justifying what happened. The loss of agency, meaning, and justification associated with extreme violence worsened as the rise of drug cartels in the 1980s and 1990s provided a much-­needed source of revenue to the struggle between guerrillas, paramilitaries, and the army and evidenced that the main driver of this new wave of violence was no longer political or ideological but almost exclusively economic in nature. For Rueda (2008), then, the period Rama (1987) identifies is key because, for the first time, violence began to be perceived as unnecessary and problematic both by the majority of the population and by intellectuals and artists. The explosion in narrative output that Rama identifies came about as a part of this discussion: it stems from the necessity and urgency of giving meaning to the senselessness that extreme violence, in the absence of a discourse that justifies or channels it, creates. Since then, the most representative voices in Colombian cultural production have sought to explain this reality and this crisis—and the reality of this crisis—and to forge an aesthetic that accounts for the horror and preserves the stories that official narratives would prefer to elide. This vast cultural production is uneven in quality, diverse in perspective and technique, and polemical in nature, and its aesthetic qualities—beyond its sociological, documentary, and monetary value—have been extensively and heatedly debated by specialists and laypeople alike. These concerns are made explicit in “Dos o tres cosas sobre la novela de la violencia en Colombia,” a short text written by Gabriel García Márquez in 1959. Eight years before writing his capolavoro—his masterpiece telling the dazzling and vio-\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nlent fate of the Buendía family—García Márquez decried the pressure put on writers to take explicit political stands through their work and the expectation that art could, and should, respond immediately to sociopolitical upheaval. Aesthetic representation, García Márquez argues, requires mediation both in terms of temporal distance from the events and, more importantly, in terms of formal experimentation. Displaying equal amounts of foresight and arrogance, the young García Márquez dismissed all the novels written about La Violencia until then by simply and categorically saying that “todas son malas.” He based his critique on what he saw as the troublesome and gory fascination of these works with massacres, tortures, and other horrors of war and on the preeminence of nonliterary techniques of storytelling more related to journalistic and sociological discourses than to aesthetic intentions. The many grisly trees, he seemed to say, were keeping us from seeing the forest of Colombian history and politics. But the rejection of what García Márquez perceived as an overreliance on the crass and gruesome aspects of reality that leads to a litany of horrors with little literary and analytical value is not new and can be seen as an iteration of the old tension between realist and naturalist perspectives and tools. That is to say, between two critical modes of artistic representation that seek to account for the maladies of their time through varying degrees of proximity and detail. Naturalism and realism are not opposed movements. Despite their differences,5 they share the belief “that art cannot turn away from the more sordid and harsh aspects of human existence” (Morris 2011, 3) and are defined by the imperative to challenge official narratives and bear witness to the impact that social, economic, and political forces have on lived reality. Since its first “boom” during La Violencia, Colombian cultural production has been marked by the oscillation between representational forms that appeal to a more direct approach to reality—even at the risk of appearing vulgar or exploitative—and modes that, through formal experimentation, explore the omissions and silences that constitute official discourses and challenge the assumed transparency and availability of reality, even at the risk of appearing elitist or exoticizing. As is well known, García Márquez’s quest to avoid narrative immediacy and descriptive accuracy with regard to violence resulted in Cien años de soledad (One Hundred Years of Solitude) (1967), the novel that would later be recognized as the masterpiece of magical realism. Despite worldwide recognition, however, magical realism has not been devoid of controversy. Its conceptual framing has been criticized for being too broad and diffuse, and the term itself has been cause for debate. Following Alejo Carpentier’s (2004a) landmark essay on the topic, “De lo real maravilloso americano,”\n\n8 Haunting without Ghosts\n\nscholars such as Irlemar Chiampi (1983) advocated for the use of “marvelous realism,”6 as this term has the advantage of providing a much-­needed historical and cultural specificity to the concept, distancing it from European versions of the fantastic and the surreal. As shown by the rhetorical question that closes Carpentier’s text, marvelous realism is not one of many literary and artistic movements. Rather, it is the direct result of Latin America’s hybrid, layered, and often exorbitant history and culture: Carpentier asks, “¿Qué es la historia de América toda sino una crónica de lo real maravilloso?” (2004a, 14). Such discussions aside, “magical realism” is the term more broadly used,7 and in spite of its global resonance,8 it is by far the cultural referent most associated with Colombia and Latin America. Broadly speaking, magical realism became a useful concept for considering a representational mode that, after World War II, found in the naturalization of the supernatural a powerful mechanism to decry the physical, economic, and epistemic violence of colonial and neocolonial regimes. In magical realism, the reenchantment of the world comes hand in hand with a keen historical and social consciousness and a deep concern with the region’s identity and place in the new geopolitical order. Thus, magical realism can be regarded as the region’s first major successful cultural attempt to “write back” to power. Writers as diverse as Miguel Ángel Asturias, Alejo Carpentier, Gabriel García Márquez, and Isabel Allende engaged in a deliberate retelling of Latin America’s history and culture as well as its political, economic, and social ailments through a distinct and innovative language. In the case of García Márquez, magical realism provided the aesthetic tools to account for the fratricidal carnage at the core of Colombian history while avoiding “el exhaustivo inventario de los decapitados, los castrados, las mujeres violadas, los sexos esparcidos y las tripas sacadas” (García Márquez 1959), which in his view was a path that did not lead to the novel but did provide its “justificación documental.” By the late 1980s, however, it was becoming increasingly clear that magical realism was a victim of its own success. Through the repetition of a stale repertoire of señoritas too beautiful to be part of this world, hyperbolic tyrants, and incestuous genealogies in which names repeated themselves ad nauseam, magical realism had lost its critical edge and fallen prey to the “pobreza imaginativa” through which, according to Carpentier, “los taumaturgos se hacen burocrátas” (2004b, 14). Furthermore, cultural practitioners and critics were concerned that the hallucinating tales of magical realism were turning the region’s most devastating historical events and social realities into mythic tales that left practically no room for reflection, much less action, on the part of the mainly urban or foreign audience that consumed\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nthem as part of their entertainment diet. They denounced the commodification that had turned magical realism into little more than a profitable packaging of cultural difference, an exoticized version of Latin America made to satisfy the international market. What was once an effective vehicle of creativity and dissent was having an asphyxiating effect on other perspectives and voices in the region. Thus, a new generation of writers, filmmakers, and artists abandoned Macondo and headed to McOndo. In 1996, the writers Alberto Fuguet and Sergio Gómez published an anthology of short stories titled McOndo. The name, which comes from García Márquez’s mythical village of Macondo—a proxy for Colombia and for Latin America more broadly—is both an “ironía irreverente al arcángel San Gabriel y también un merecido tributo” (Fuguet and Gómez 1996, 14). In the introduction, Fuguet and Gómez explain that the idea for the volume that would later become a literary movement came when one of Fuguet’s texts was rejected for publication in a “prestigiosa revista literaria” (9) in the United States “por faltar al sagrado código del realismo mágico” (10). Fuguet says that to his frustration and disbelief, the editor had no problem disdainfully telling him that “esos textos bien pudieron ser escritos en cualquier país del primer mundo” (10). There and then, “en medio de una planicie del medioeste,” the McOndo movement was born (10). The McOndos sought to actualize the imaginary around Latin America by focusing on the existential and material troubles of the modern and cosmopolitan urban dweller, such as alienation, looming ecological tragedy, drugs, and the impact of mass media in local contexts. As Fuguet and Gómez explain, “en McOndo hay McDonald’s, computadores Mac y condominios, amén de hoteles cinco estrellas construidos con dinero lavado y malls gigantescos,” and if people fly, it is because they are either traveling by airplane or very high on drugs (15). The emphasis on postmodern, globalized conditions of existence was accompanied by a move away from the sociopolitical toward the individual realm. Their works were not meant to be “frescos sociales ni sagas colectivas.” Instead, “el gran tema de la identidad latinoamericana (¿quiénes somos?) pareció dejar paso al tema de la identidad personal (¿quién soy?)” (13). With the biting irony that characterized their project, Fuguet and Gómez shrug off criticism by saying that “suponemos que esto es una de las herencias de la fiebre privatizadora mundial” (13). And, to further distance themselves from the previous generation and to reinforce the notion of a depoliticized, globalized mode of writing, they explain that “si hace unos años la disyuntiva del escritor estaba entre tomar el lápiz o la carabina, ahora parece que lo más angustiante para escribir es elegir entre Windows 95 o MacIntosh” (13). Despite the McOndos reference to Colombia’s most famous imaginary\n\n10 Haunting without Ghosts\n\nvillage, however, their mode of writing was not particularly popular in the country. While the McOndos were writing about the spleen produced by watching too much MTV, Colombia was facing one of the biggest political crises of its existence and experiencing extreme and unabated violence. In the 1980s and 1990s, Colombia suffered intense political and social upheaval due to the rise of powerful drug cartels and growing conflict among the military, guerrillas, and right-­wing paramilitaries. Violence moved from the countryside to medium and large cities, causing panic in the general public and threatening a social class and a political elite that had not suffered the most violent consequences of the war. Furthermore, the immense sums of money produced by the lucrative drug trade invigorated the local economy at a time when, as in most other Latin American countries, Colombia was undergoing a severe crisis due in part to the aggressive neoliberal reforms that characterized the decade in the region. This influx of money helped ailing private and public finances but also shook up the traditional class system, as powerful families and the government itself became dependent on capital of dubious origins generated by newcomers with no social credentials. In this anxiety-­ridden context, literature, art, and film became valuable means of expressing the uneasiness that characterized the period and of reflecting upon the social, cultural, historical, political, and human impact of these rapid and threatening changes. Most cultural producers agreed with the McOndos that magical realism as an innovative and critical artistic mode had been exhausted and sought to distance themselves from the seemingly omnipresent shadow of García Márquez’s legacy. Like the McOndos, they turned their attention from the countryside to the cities. But if their works followed the privatization instinct of their cosmopolitan counterparts and were no longer “sagas colectivas,” they were powerful “frescos sociales.” Writers such as Alonso Salazar, Fernando Vallejo, Jorge Franco, Darío Jaramillo, Laura Restrepo, and Óscar Collazos and filmmakers such as Víctor Gaviria explored the role of historical violence in the sociopolitical and moral decomposition of the country. Despite the differences among them, their aesthetic proposals share an inclination toward visual immediacy and linguistic verisimilitude and an intense interest in the more deprived social echelons. Thus, they have been grouped into the larger trend of realismo sucio, or “urban realism,” as it has sometimes been translated into English to mitigate confusion with North America’s “dirty realism.”9 The term “dirty realism” is more a false cognate than a literary homologue of realismo sucio. Bill Buford, who coined the English-­language term in Granta magazine, defines “dirty realism” as\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nstrange stories: unadorned, unfurnished, low-­rent tragedies about people who watch day-­time television, read cheap romances or listen to country and western music. They are waitresses in roadside cafés, cashiers in supermarkets, construction workers, secretaries and unemployed cowboys. They play bingo, eat cheeseburgers, hunt deer and stay in cheap hotels. They drink a lot and are often in trouble: for stealing a car, breaking a window, pickpocketing a wallet. They are from Kentucky or Alabama or Oregon, but, mainly, they could just about be from anywhere: drifters in a world cluttered with junk food and the oppressive details of modern consumerism. This is a curious, dirty realism about the belly-­side of contemporary life. (Buford 1983)\n\nThis definition shares more similarities with the stories written by the McOndos than with the fast-­paced, violent narratives associated with Colombian cultural production of the time. Though it also tells tales “about the belly-­side of contemporary life,” Colombia’s realismo sucio tackles social decomposition at both the individual and the structural level. The work of the filmmaker Víctor Gaviria is perhaps the best example of realismo sucio. His films focus on the grim realities of the most dispossessed inhabitants of modern cities: children and adolescents struggling to survive in a world plagued by economic injustice and social violence. In general, his characters do not watch TV during the day—or at any other time—because they do not own television sets, and they do not eat hamburgers because they cannot afford them. Hence, films such as Rodrigo D: No futuro (1990) and La vendedora de rosas (1998) could be better interpreted as postmodern heirs to Latin America’s Third Cinema.10 Like the films of the New Latin American Cinema, they have an intense concern for social justice and economic violence and use hybrid forms and techniques that blur the line between documentary and fiction.11 They differ, however, in their political disillusionment and the lack of any ideological affiliation that could be translated along party lines. In realismo sucio, one sees the despair and alienation of the young and the disillusionment and loneliness of the old. But one is also faced with the stark contrasts that make up Latin America’s modernity: the uneven distribution of wealth, the ruthless consequences of new globalized economies, and the unmet promises of neoliberal states. One sees the slums and the malls, the cocaine-­snorting college kids and the homeless children fighting to survive in the streets. Another characteristic of realismo sucio is its emphasis on the present. If magical realism proposes grand narratives that encompass the mytho-­historic life of a people, realismo sucio focuses on immediate reality. Its characters have no interest in\n\n12 Haunting without Ghosts\n\neither the past or the future; the here and now is all that matters. As the title of Víctor Gaviria’s film Rodrigo D: No futuro suggests, the dire conditions of existence for most of these characters create the sense of a futureless, apocalyptic world. In the Colombian context, the lethal combination of the booming business of illegal drugs and the growing military might of the seemingly all-­ powerful cartels aggravated the situation. Cultural practitioners did not remain silent. The vast majority of novels, films, and art produced in Colombia in this time period revolved around the sociopolitical chaos and the human consequences of the war on drugs and the longest armed conflict in the hemisphere. This crisis was personified by the figures of the sicarios, boys between fourteen and twenty years of age who worked as hitmen primarily, though not exclusively, for the cartels.12 The fascination with sicarios generated a new boom in cultural production. The works produced about this topic were retrospectively classified under the productive and profitable label of sicaresca. The term was coined by the Colombian writer Héctor Abad Faciolince in his 1995 article “Estética y narcotráfico,” and it combines the words sicario and picaresca, the word used to designate the picaresque literary genre. The term points to the transformation of a social phenomenon (the sicariato) into a cultural one (the sicaresca genre), grouping a variety of novels and films about the lives of the young sicarios, and in general about the violent and exuberant world of the narcos, that became popular in the late 1980s and are still very well received by the public.13 As Margarita Jácome explains, these works revolve around “los nexos entre los traficantes de droga y los jóvenes asesinos, en los que el sicario aparece como objeto, y las prácticas culturales heredadas del narcotráfico, especialmente el afán consumista y un énfasis en ritos religiosos de protección y agradecimiento” (2009, 205). Formally, the novels are characterized by superficial, racialized, and sexualized depictions of the sicarios; fast-­paced narratives with detailed descriptions of the inner workings of the criminal world and the violent acts perpetrated by criminals; the extensive use of parlache, the slang associated with the underworld of the narcos; an idealized and nostalgic view of the past that produces a sharp contrast with the chaos of the now; and the presence of a literate narrator who acts as a cultural and linguistic bridge between the violent lives of the young assassins and the reader, with whom he shares presumed socioeconomic status and values.14 The predilection for marginalized characters, the use of crass language, and the reliance on explicit images of violence and social decomposition make the sicaresca more closely related to naturalism, with the works sharing many of the characteristics of the novels of La Violencia that in\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nhis time García Márquez questioned and sought to abjure. Representative works in the genre include El sicario (1990), by Mario Bahamón Dussán; No nacimos pa’ semilla (1990), by Alonso Salazar; Morir con papá (1997), by Óscar Collazos; Rosario Tijeras, in both novelistic ( Jorge Franco, 1999) and cinematographic (Emilio Maillé, 2005) form; and Sangre ajena, by Arturo Álape. In part because of the cinematic rendition (2000) by the French filmmaker Barbet Schroeder, the best-­known example, however, remains La Virgen de los sicarios (1993), written by Fernando Vallejo, the enfant terrible of literature whom Colombia loves to hate. Largely because the war on drugs and drug traffickers themselves—with their glamorous lifestyles and sensational crimes—hold such fascination for the global imagination, violencia (now with a small v) replaced the hyperbolic exoticism of magical realism and came to be seen as the country’s most distinctive historical and cultural feature. Violence became a double synecdoche of representation for Colombia; its cultural production was expected to represent the violence both of drug trafficking and of the anachronistic and discredited revolutionary struggles that the country itself represented in the new world order. Furthermore, the enthrallment with all things narco created an international market that the literary critic Alejandro Herrero-­ Olaizola (2007, 43) describes as a “comercialización de los márgenes” that promotes “cierta exotización de una realidad latinoamericana ‘cruda’ dirigida a un público más atento e instruido en cuestiones socio-­políticas de América Latina y ansioso de leer algo nuevo, algo más light . . . pero con cierto ‘peso cultural.’ ” Similar to what occurred with magical realism, “narco” became a powerful commercial prefix, and the critical drive that catalyzed many of these works was diluted by the demands of the market and the need to conform to the expectations of an audience eager to read something new, something light, but with a certain “cultural weight.”15 In this context, the question posed by the film critic Juana Suárez becomes more pressing: “Si el tema más frecuente de [la producción cultural] colombian[a] sigue siendo la violencia, cabe indagar si hay un cambio de encuadre y otro lente de acercamiento al mismo. . . . En el centro del dilema, entonces, subsiste la discusión sobre mirar la violencia, ser indiferentes o encontrar otra manera de abordarla” (2009, 182). Since the late 1990s, but especially in the new millennium, Evelio Rosero and other writers; filmmakers such as William Vega, Jorge Forero, and Felipe Guerrero; and artists including Juan Manuel Echavarría, Beatriz González, and Erika Diettes have been part of an ongoing search for a different perspective from which to look at Colombia’s recent historical violence without simplifying, exoticizing, or commodifying it. They have done so by exploring the aesthetic\n\n14 Haunting without Ghosts\n\nand ethical possibilities of the ghostly—what I am calling “spectral realism.” Spectral realism is a response to the cultural and political landscape of its time, but it should not be thought of as an overcoming of magical realism or of the sicaresca. Rather, it can more productively be analyzed alongside them. A short stroll into any local bookstore or a quick search on Amazon will suffice to show that magical realism and the sicaresca are alive and well. Young and not-­so-­young authors still find the resources provided by these narrative modes productive, and thousands of readers and viewers are enthralled by the worlds they represent. More than a break from or a rupture with the two realist modes that precede it, spectral realism is another iteration of the old haunting at the core of Colombian cultural production that Suárez mentions. Furthermore, even if it is essential to analyze spectral realism in its specific context, its scope is not limited to Colombia, and it can be a useful conceptual metaphor for analyzing the representation of historical violence elsewhere. For the purpose of this book, however, I focus on Colombian cultural practitioners who, in their search for a way to tell the violent tales of their native country, have found themselves sharing García Márquez’s insight that “la novela no estaba en los muertos de tripas sacadas, sino en los vivos que debieron sudar hielo en su escondite, sabiendo que a cada latido del corazón corrían el riesgo de que les sacaran las tripas” (1959); but they have disagreed with him in one fundamental aspect. It was not true that “los pobrecitos muertos ya no servían sino para ser enterrados” (García Márquez 1959). On the contrary, they needed to be summoned, and the violent deaths they encountered had to be told not in spite of, but precisely because of, the profound disruption their untimely but necessary return provokes. To better understand what this summoning of specters entails, it is crucial to differentiate the ghost from the specter and ghost stories from spectral narratives. Haunting without Ghosts: Spectrality as Conceptual Metaphor At the end of the twentieth century, a major shift took place in the humanities, the social sciences, and the arts in the way that ghostly matters were comprehended and mobilized. During this time, ghosts ceased to be perceived as supernatural entities or fictional tropes relegated to the fantastic or the allegorical. This change in perspective shaped a productive critical framework in which to rethink both academic disciplines and cultural production. María del Pilar Blanco and Esther Peeren call this tectonic theoretical shift “the spectral turn.” Under this rubric, they mark the transition\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nwhereby “the ghost ceases to be seen as obscurantist and becomes, instead, a figure of clarification with a specifically ethical and political potential” (Blanco and Peeren 2013, 7). The publication of Jacques Derrida’s Specters of Marx: The State of Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International in 1993 is a landmark in this regard. While there are important antecedents, including Terry Castle’s The Apparitional Lesbian: Female Homosexuality and Modern Culture (1993) and Anthony Vidler’s The Architectural Uncanny: Essays in the Modern Unhomely (1992), Specters of Marx was the catalyst of the more recent wave of academic interest in all things spectral. In Specters of Marx, Derrida rehabilitates the figure of the specter as a much-­needed disruptive and critical force, using precisely the two systems of thought that in the first part of the twentieth century produced some of the most scathing criticism against it: psychoanalysis and Marxism. Born as a response to Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History and the Last Man (1992), Specters of Marx cautions against triumphalist and eschatological visions of history that obscure the injustices that uphold them, and explores the relationship between the intellectual and the specter as a way of resisting the historical, economic, and ideological homogenization proclaimed after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Within this discourse, the figure of the ghost appears as an enabling metaphoric vehicle with which to revisit the past and recognize those who have been physically and symbolically banished from it in its transition into official history. The characteristics associated with ghosts and haunting make the spectral ideal for this disruptive task. The liminal position of the specter with regard to life and death, presence and absence, materiality and immateriality; the disruption of the spatiotemporal coordinates of modernity it produces; and the demand for justice it brings along, turned the ghostly into one of the most productive conceptual metaphors of the last decade of the twentieth century. Unlike a regular figure of speech, a conceptual metaphor “performs theoretical work” through “a dynamic comparative interaction, not just of another thing, word or idea and its associations, but of a discourse, a system of producing knowledge” (Blanco and Peeren 2013, 1). Specters of Marx is but one example of such productive conceptual metaphor at work.16 The book redefines the role of the intellectual amid the euphoria produced by the consolidation of liberal democracy and capitalism as the only legitimate political and economic ideologies of the West. It highlights the ethical problems of such an epistemological position and invites scholars to disrupt this homogenizing impulse and embrace uncertainty, heterogeneity, and multiplicity as essential parts of their academic and ethical endeavors. Hence, spectrality is primarily concerned with relations be-\n\n16 Haunting without Ghosts\n\ntween modes of production and violence. It asks destabilizing questions about the erasures underlying dominant ways of producing goods, knowledge, affect, history, and time and seeks to mobilize alternatives, primarily from within the cultural and academic realms. In order to not neglect the “obvious macroscopic fact . . . that never before, in absolute figures, have so many men, women and children been subjugated, starved or exterminated on the earth” (Derrida 2006, 106), the intellectual, like Horatio in Hamlet, must be capable not of talking about those who have been physically and symbolically exiled from this eschatological vision of history, but be willing and able to speak to and with them. Therefore, Derrida calls for a “hauntology”: a move away from the “spirit” that informs (Hegel’s) ontology and toward Marx’s specter, not as Marxism but as a disruptive critical force, “an interpretation that transforms the very thing it interprets” (Derrida 2006, 63). Derrida is not interested in ghosts; rather, he pursues “that which haunts like a ghost and, by way of this haunting, demands justice or, at least, a response” (Blanco and Peeren 2013, 9). Through the asynchronicity of the specter, and the exploration of the silenced histories it enables, spectrality explores the possibilities of justice precisely when such a quest seems more doomed and foreclosed. Haunting, then, is a will to seek justice beyond the law,17 because the law is bound to the exclusionary, and often violent, dynamics of ontopology. Above all, haunting is a quest for the possibilities of uttering such will. To summarize, spectrality does not entail a belief in the supernatural; rather, it assumes the characteristics of the specter to advance critical and ethically oriented academic and cultural products. The specter makes the familiar unfamiliar, or unheimlich. It unhinges time, rarefies space, questions materiality and presence as the only forms of being, and demands justice. These characteristics make the reach and appeal of spectrality broad. The copious bibliography about spectrality shows that the figure of the specter as a means of rethinking cultural production, and of haunting not only history but also storytelling, has been used by cultural producers in varied locations, times, and ways.18 Hence, to avoid spreading the concept too thinly, careful contextualization and site-­specific analysis is essential. When cultural, historical, and geographical specificities are taken into account, spectrality becomes a productive theoretical tool that allows a more comprehensive understanding of the operations and effects of late capitalism and modernity, underscores how these processes make certain subjects prone to sociohistorical erasure, and explores the representational challenges and possibilities enabled by this hauntology.\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nIn the following chapters, I focus on selected Colombian iterations of the spectral as a mode of storytelling and artistic expression in a historical moment when the country is attempting to make sense of its past, grapple with its present, and forge a future after decades of a conflict that—at least in its traditional form—has reached its end. To do so, it is first necessary to ground the ghost and to briefly look into the long and rich genealogy of Latin American specters. Ghostly Genealogies, Spectral Realism, and Storytelling Ghosts have haunted Latin American cultural production for decades, from Domingo Faustino Sarmiento’s Facundo: Civilización y barbarie (1845) to the short stories of Horacio Quiroga; from María Luisa Bombal’s La amortajada (1938) to Juan Rulfo’s groundbreaking Pedro Páramo (1955); from Ernesto Sabato’s Sobre héroes y tumbas (1961) to Gabriel García Márquez’s Cien años de soledad (1967) and Isabel Allende’s La casa de los espíritus (1982), a staple of high school curricula. As these all exemplify, the trope of ghosts and the talking dead figures prominently in Latin American fiction and has played a key role in the development of the region’s modern narrative. Since Sarmiento’s famous conjuration of the “terrible shadow” of Juan Facundo Quiroga as the starting point of his foundational book,19 ghosts have entered Latin American cultural production to denounce unresolved feuds, to demand justice, to challenge official accounts of violent events, and sometimes simply to soothe and accompany the living. Most notably, the works of Sarmiento and García Márquez established the link between the ghost and the region’s violent history and troubled modernity, underscoring the historical and aesthetic importance of talking to the dead. As previously noted, however, not all ghost stories constitute spectral narratives. Despite the importance that ghosts have for diegetic time and events and for symbolic meaning, in almost all of the examples referenced previously, the reader remains mainly unaffected by the unsettling potential of the ghost. For both Sarmiento and García Márquez, the ghost is primarily a revelatory, almost messianic, figure through which the destiny of the living is revealed and acquires its full meaning.20 Such is not the case in the work of Juan Rulfo. If Sarmiento and García Márquez provided important conceptual tools for the development of spectral realism, Rulfo’s contribution is pivotal from a formal point of view. In this sense, Pedro Páramo (1955) is the most significant precedent to spectral realism. In his first and only novel, Juan Rulfo tells the story of Juan Preciado, a\n\n18 Haunting without Ghosts\n\nyoung man who after the death of his mother travels to Comala, a town inhabited by ghosts and spectral murmurs, to meet his father and demand repayment for years of abandonment. But Pedro Páramo is also, and more importantly, a tale of the disastrous consequences of years of plundering and sexual and physical violence that resulted from the revolutionary struggles and the Cristero War, frustration with the unfulfilled promises of the Mexican Revolution, and the results of Mexico’s uneven process of modernization. Rulfo’s literary work mirrors the destabilization and anxiety produced by this situation. His text not only speaks about ghosts and haunting but also extends the experience to the readers. The readers partake in Juan Preciado’s inability to navigate the space, tell apart the living from the dead, identify the origin of the echoes and murmurs that haunt him, and accomplish any sense of closure or fulfillment. Comala is a place “donde anidan los sobresaltos” (Rulfo 2002, 28), and where the spatiotemporal coordinates used to navigate and make sense of the surroundings are suspended. In Comala time shrinks (20) and moves backward (57), and light does not provide clarity because it is “[una] pobre luz sin lumbre” (116). Additionally, even though Preciado is able to see and hear, the sensory horizon is both ex‑ panded and radically altered. “Mis ojos, tan sin mirada” (67), says Preciado, summarizing the reworking of vision in the novel: a gaze that does not produce epistemic or visual clarity. The role of sound is similar. Comala is a town of auditory contradictions. Silence is rife with voices “que se quedaban dentro de uno, pesadas” (14), words are felt but cannot be heard (50), and streets are crowded by “ruidos. Voces. Rumores” (49) with no discernible origin. Furthermore, Comala is filled with echoes (44) that beset Preciado— so much so that murmurs are literally what kill him: “me mataron los murmullos” (60), he says calmly, in one of the most powerful and ambiguous moments in the book. But death is not the end in Comala. Both Preciado and the reader learn to listen to the ánimas that share the streets with the living (54) and must eventually abandon the quest to set them apart. The question of whether somebody is dead or alive is repeated throughout the book and is either never resolved or passed off with contradictory answers that further confuse characters and readers alike, thus making it impossible, and unnecessary, to establish any difference. Rulfo’s specters have little in common with García Márquez’s wise, irreverent, and melancholic ghosts. Unlike Macondo, Comala is a haunted town for both protagonists and readers. The readers of Pedro Páramo do not sympathize with Juan Preciado’s anxiety, frustration, and failure to achieve clarity; they share it. Most of the time, Preciado cannot map or navigate the space, establish a clear chronology of the events, or identify the source of the\n\nIntroduction 19\n\nvoices that address him. Initially, this disorientation terrifies and confounds him and disconcerts the reader. But the haptic reworking of the senses is one of the key contributions of the novel and is what allows mobilization of the demands for justice that the spectral voices evoke, not as an individual claim, but as a collective demand that will not be silenced. If Sarmiento conjures the specter as a key voice with which to complicate the foundational narratives and historiographic discourses of modernity, and García Márquez reenchants the world by allowing the ghosts of the past to freely walk into the present and converse with the living while fanning themselves in the parlor’s rocking chairs, it is Rulfo who models the spectral as a mode of storytelling in Latin America. Spectral realism draws on this ghostly lineage specifically as it relates to formal experimentation with regard to the representation of historical violence. It draws upon realist tenets and concerns but finds in spectrality its means of expression. Peter Brooks defines classical realism as “that species of literature for which the careful registering of the external world counts most” (1993, 3); and the literary critic Georg Lukács notes that one of the key elements of realist writing is that it was the first literary form to escape what he considered the two main pitfalls of artistic representation: the pernicious dehistoricization implicit in the creation of universal tropes, and the narcissistic and bourgeois overemphasis on the individual. According to Lukács, realist writing historicized universal types in literature for the first time. That is, heroes were no longer portrayed as atemporal entities representing humanity as a whole. Instead, they were depicted as both representatives and products of their own historical and social circumstances. Also, despite the intense focus on specific characters, the realist novel of the nineteenth century remained firmly grounded in social and economic forces, which kept it from falling into the crass dogmatism of the naturalist novel and the melancholic ruminations of modernist writing.21 In a similar guise, spectral realism is deeply concerned with the human side of historical forces. As Avery Gordon notes in her classic Ghostly Matters: Haunting and the Sociological Imagination (1997), “The ghost is not simply a dead or a missing person, but a social figure” (2008, 8). As in other iterations of realism, in spectral realism characters “are conceived historically. Their personalities and the events of their lives are wholly shaped by the larger social forces in which their existences are enmeshed” (Morris 2011, 64). Even if not explicitly thematized, historical density in spectral realism is enmeshed in the plot and informs the traits and actions of the characters. Classical realism is also defined by an ethical anxiety that often leads to scathing social critique. At its core is a profound questioning of the values\n\n20 Haunting without Ghosts\n\nof its time and a will to denounce the moral corruption and violence that upholds the status quo. Despite its often grand and totalizing narratives, classical realism intersects with the imperative to bear witness to and speak for those without a public voice. Realism’s “insistence that art cannot turn away from the more sordid and harsh aspects of human existence” (Morris 2011, 3), and that these situations are not the result of fate or tragedy, but the direct consequence of historical and socioeconomic processes, has been of great aesthetic and ethical value. As a genre, however, realism was developed toward the end of the eighteenth century and was consolidated during the nineteenth century in Europe, particularly in England and France.22 Thus, realism is strongly associated with the rise of capitalism as the world’s main economic system, the bourgeoisie as the new social class in power, and many of the values of the Enlightenment: rationality, secular forms of knowledge that prioritize observation and reasoning, and, later on, natural and social theories about evolution, progress, and development. Through its incorporation of spectrality, spectral realism undermines these claims to epistemic mastery and denounces their collusion with systems of physical and symbolic subjection. Following Juan Rulfo’s lead, spectral realism underscores that ethical issues cannot be separated from representational ones, thus enacting a turn toward the spectral that refocuses one’s attention on “the aesthetic aspects of the problem, whereby beings and presences enter uneasily into, or insistently disturb, representation and the stability of its visual, temporal, and spatial logic” (Demos 2013, 9). As is the case in Pedro Páramo, in spectral realism, the clash of political, economic, and social forces does more than affect the characters and the denouements of the plot. The narrative itself is unhinged by it. Violence is not aestheticized, exoticized, or normalized. The instability, confusion, and fear that violence engenders are incorporated into the works in an attempt to shake the reader or spectator out of his or her cultural and ethical stupor. The spectralization of the narrative elicits complex questions about the ethical pertinence and aesthetic relevance of works that deal with violence and, like all specters, aspires to set readers, spectators, critics, and other cultural producers into political, social, or artistic motion. It does so through a careful reworking of the four axes critical for realist practices: vision, time, space, and ethical concern with the implications/complications of the artistic representation of historical violence.\n\nIntroduction 21\n\nUnpacking Spectral Realism: “La vista sin perspectiva de la niebla”; or, The Limits of Vision There is something unsatisfactory about the field of vision: it can never quite see. Peter Brooks, Body Work\n\nClassical realism is the literary child of the Enlightenment. It shares with it a secular and scientific understanding of the world, an empirical view of knowledge, and a totalizing ethos that seeks to comprehend and apprehend the world primarily through the supposedly objective and rigorous observation at the heart of the scientific method. From the birth of academic disciplines such as anthropology and ethnography, and the boom of botanical expeditions in South America that aspired to catalogue the entire fauna and flora of the continent, to the development of technologies of the visual that radically altered the perception of the world, such as the daguerreotype, the X-­ray machine, and the cinematograph, toward the end of the eighteenth century and throughout the nineteenth, white European men embarked on an unprecedented quest of observation that encompassed biological, social, and human nature.23 The rise and consolidation of the realist novel is part of this epistemological project. In his 1842 avant-­propos to The Human Comedy, Honoré de Balzac explicitly declares that his literature has been heavily influenced by the work of biologists such as Georges-­Louis Leclerc, Georges Cuvier, and Étienne Saint-­Hilaire and describes his own project foremost as the careful observation, registration, and analysis of social life to discover the causes and effects of social forces and human behavior. Balzac’s success in achieving his own project is debatable; indeed, his status as one of the West’s greatest writers may partly stem from his failure to follow this narrow conception of literature. His frantic writing pace left little room for meticulous scientific analysis,24 and what Peter Brooks calls his melodramatic, and highly moralistic,25 imagination, and what Erich Auerbach (2003) labels his bombastic nature,26 made his most memorable books prodigious treatises on human passions and scathing critiques of contemporary society that have little to do with the balance and rigor adjudicated to scientific writing. But the idea that literature should partake in the scientific endeavors of the time continued throughout the nineteenth century and reached its peak years with Émile Zola’s Le roman expérimental (1893). Modeling this work on Claude Bernard’s Introduction à l’etude de la médecine expérimentale, Zola claimed that the novel was a privileged space for social and psychological experimentation because it allowed\n\n22 Haunting without Ghosts\n\nauthors to create a controlled environment that was not replicable in real life. It is beyond the scope of this book to discuss the details and merits of the works of Balzac and Zola, but it is relevant to my project that in both instances the impulse to account for the maladies of their time translated into a formal investment in vision applied to the sociopolitical and economic realms of the time. Vision is central to realism’s epistemic claims and narrative style. As Peter Brooks explains in Realist Vision, realism, more than any other mode of literature, “makes sight paramount—makes it the dominant sense in our understanding of and relation to the world” (2005, 3)27—hence its association with painting and other visual arts. In fact, as Brooks also points out, the term “realism” “comes into the culture, in the early 1850s, to characterize painting—that of Courbet in particular—and then by extension is taken to describe a literary style. It is a term resolutely attached to the visual, to those works that seek to inventory the immediate perceptible world” (16).28 One of the main literary consequences of this investment in vision is the quantity and relevance of descriptive prose. Realist authors believe that “sight is the most objective and impartial of our senses” (16) and thus dedicate a significant amount of narrative time and space to visually inspecting and accounting for the material world the characters inhabit. In this context, objects are not merely decorative or functional. They are cues that provide crucial information about their owners’ social background, age, gender, political affiliation, cultural anxieties, and more. They are pieces of data that must be properly identified and analyzed by both characters and readers in order to make sense of the sociohistorical fresco meticulously and painstakingly being (re)constructed in front of their very eyes. Consequently, the realist novel also partakes in the strong correlations among vision, knowledge, and mastery common to the Enlightenment project as a whole. That is, the desire to see overlaps with the desire to comprehend and to apprehend in the political, social, and artistic realms. For example, through a judicious reading of travel books written starting around 1750 by Europeans about non-­European peoples and territories, Mary Louise Pratt (2008) identifies how aestheticization became one of the most effective tools used by the white, male subject to claim authority for his vision and to assert his political and economic hegemony in the shifting world order; and Michel Foucault famously recognized in Jeremy Bentham’s panopticon of 1790 the powerful embodiment of the entanglement of hierarchical vision and social control.29 In fact, the act of seeing without being seen, the authority, the knowledge production, and the control that the panopticon symbolizes, is, for Peter Brooks, precisely what lies at the core of\n\nIntroduction 23\n\nthe realist epistemological project, and the panopticon is also the image that most effectively represents its narrative focalization and voice. Based on analysis of Balzac’s main works but noting that his conclusions illuminate classical realism more broadly, Brooks claims that “Balzac’s narrative vision corresponds to the model of Jeremy Bentham’s panopticon prison, in which a centrally posted surveillant can, himself unobserved, observe and interpret the appearances and movements of others” (1993, 84). Vision, in classical realism, is the preferred medium of acquiring the knowledge required to control and master a particular environment. Characters and readers must learn a way of seeing that allows them to access the information needed to successfully navigate the social and textual space in which they are immersed. This is why the positionality and directionality of the gaze is vital. As in the panopticon, the gaze that classical realism pursues is hierarchical and penetrative. The main task of the narrative voice of the classic realist novel is to illuminate, to bring to the fore the darkest aspects of the human heart and psyche as well as the hidden dynamics that sustain the sociopolitical status quo. The all-­seeing, all-­knowing narrator of realism achieves and retains control by constantly zooming in on the houses, lives, and minds of the characters and by revealing their darkest secrets and the unexpected significance of objects and gestures to the reader in a meticulously planned textual denouement. This ability to see, know, and reveal is what Peter Brooks calls the “x-­ray glance” (1995, 134) of realism. But Balzac (2018) himself best described this technique as a process of psychological— and, one might add, sociopolitical—optics that leads to the epistemic and social command of the world presented to both characters and readers. Indeed, the final scene of Balzac’s Père Goriot is paradigmatic in this sense. After the burial of old Goriot, Rastignac goes to the highest part of Père-­ Lachaise Cemetery and, from this position of visual command, shows that he has achieved full legibility of Parisian society—and is therefore ready to master it. Looking down upon Paris, he addresses its society directly: “ ‘Now it’s just the two of us!—I’m ready!’ And then, for the first challenge he hurled to Society, Rastignac went to have dinner with Madame de Nuncingen” (Balzac 1994, 217). Rastignac is finally able to move from vision to possession, thus achieving a position analogous to that of an author: “From his state of limited vision . . . he has risen to dominating heights, seized the knowledge of his way into and through the world, and become master of his destiny” (Brooks 1993, 141). The strong correlations among visibility, knowledge, and mastery that traverse classical realism are also a fundamental part of the reading experience because they produce a strong textual scopophilia; that is, a dynamic\n\n24 Haunting without Ghosts\n\nin which the desire to see is imbued with the drive to unveil and to possess. This economy of desire keeps the reader engaged and gratified. Despite the grim stories, readers are rewarded with the reinforcement of their privileged epistemic position and a clearly defined code of values with which to judge characters and events. By the end of Balzac’s novel, the reader is standing next to Rastignac and, like him, has achieved full legibility and command. In contrast, the most salient and productive trait of spectral realism is a profound distrust of visibility and elucidation that leads to the formal exploration of alternative perspectives to the hierarchical, objectifying, and rapacious gaze of realism. Epistemic and visual clarity are replaced by an oblique gaze that does not present, transcribe, or explain. In a world plagued by technologies of hypervisibility ready for consumption through social media platforms, these works complicate vision by exploring the limits and unreliability of the visible. They do so in part by focusing on disappearance as a key narrative driver. All of these works feature an ongoing search not only for those who have disappeared due to the war but also for all the things that have vanished with them, from objects and buildings to the ability to make sense of a world once familiar and now unheimlich and hostile. But disappearance is more than a thematic preoccupation. As Avery Gordon argues, “The power of disappearance is the power to control everyday reality, to make the unreal real. . . . The power of disappearance is . . . to be vanished as the very condition of your existence” (2008, 131). Spectral realism extends the destabilizing force of disappearance into the formal composition of the works. Evelio Rosero’s novels En el lejero and Los ejércitos are cases in point. In the latter, the protagonist himself turns into a ghost after the disappearance of his wife, Otilia. In the former, the reiterative and extensive use of different modes of the verb desaparecer mediates the description of the novel’s space, environmental conditions, and plot denouements and is indicative of how disappearance not only spectralizes the people who have been forcefully banished but also disrupts the ability to perceive, to comprehend, and to inhabit the world for those who search for them.30 In this sense, the statements of the film director William Vega about the prevalence of fog and other visual impairments in his film La sirga is expressive of spectral realism as a whole: “The fog doesn’t let us see beyond certain limits, and this provokes an inevitable suspense. I think that is what the film is about; human incapacity to see it all” (Comingore 2013). Seeing, in spectral realism, is a difficult and frustrating task because to see in spectral realism is always to witness something, or someone, disappear. It is to confront the limits of vision. Spectral realism does not attempt to dispel the fog of war but is instead\n\nIntroduction 25\n\nnarrated from within that fog. It reenacts the crisis in looking, proposing that violence turns visuality “from a transparent tool into a felt uncertainty” (Baer 2002, 106). As a result, shock and bewilderment, not clarity and seduction, define the experience of reading these novels and watching these films. This difficulty in seeing undermines our privilege as readers and viewers and forces us to engage more actively and critically with vision. By steering away from scopophilic desire and its triangulation of sight, knowledge, and power, spectral realism reflects on the violence implicated in the construction of visibility. It explores the disproportion between those who see and those who are seen, the intangible but all-­too-­real persistence of what cannot be seen, and the aesthetic, social, and political dynamics that lead to the visibilization or effacement of certain bodies, voices, and experiences. Spectral realism invites us to follow the lead of Jeremías Andrade, the protagonist of En el lejero, and instead of searching for illumination and elucidation, to learn to see through “la rara luz de la niebla” (Rosero 2003, 73). To be able to see in spectral realism, we need more than our eyes; or, rather, our eyes need to be able to do more than just see. If “to know, in realism, is to see, and to represent is to describe” (Brooks 1993, 88), the spectral gaze is more closely related to what Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari call “haptic” vision, a synesthetic mode of seeing whereby the eye has a tactile, “nonoptical function” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 492). This way of seeing affects the experience and perception of space as well. Spectral Landscapes and Smooth Spaces\n\nRealism is built on a recognizable and navigable conception of space. The construction of a clear cartography that corresponds with actual places, and is attuned to the nuances of inhabiting the specific cities and towns where the action takes place, is fundamental to its narrative structure. References to local landmarks and distinguishable aspects of city life strengthen the reality effect for the readers and provide important information for the development of the plot, which is why it is not uncommon to find maps of Paris or London in well-­curated editions of Balzac and Dickens. The ability to map out social and physical space is vital for realist readers and characters alike. Readers and characters must learn to navigate the space and recognize the dense historic and symbolic meanings of these sites in order to fully comprehend—and dominate—the social, epistemic, and textual space of the novel. Realismo sucio remains grounded in the city, but the ability to reliably move through and master the space is lost. Cities become chaotic and undecipherable, even apocalyptic, but are still recognizable as concrete\n\n26 Haunting without Ghosts\n\nsites with specific histories and dynamics. Fernando Vallejo’s literature is inseparable from his Dantesque and nostalgic vision of Medellín, and Víctor Gaviria’s tales of despair are intrinsic to the violent inner workings of modern Latin American metropolises. In Colombia, spectral realism, following the lead of the novela de la tierra and magical realism, returns to the countryside.31 Its milieus are remote and secluded villages torn by war, lakes ensconced in páramos, jungles plagued by mosquitoes. An anecdote that Evelio Rosero often recounts is telling in this regard. When asked about the mysterious title of his book En el lejero, he replied that “lejero” derives from “lejos,” the Spanish word for “far.” “Lejero,” then, would mean something like “faraway land.” The word, he clarifies, is not his; it came from his mother. When he told her he was going away to Paris to be a writer, she snubbed him and said that it was ridiculous to go to “semejante lejero” (such a lejero) just to be a writer. Rosero went to Paris anyway, but both the word and the idea—that to be a writer he didn’t have to distance himself, symbolically or physically, from Colombia—stuck with him. Spectral realism inhabits and is narrated from within the lejeros of Colombia, the spectral sites that haunt the national imaginary because they are the spaces in which violence has gorged itself. In most cases, the towns do not have proper names, specific geographical referents are either completely elided or vaguely mentioned, and few or no landmarks help the reader or viewer recognize them as discrete locations. What is readily recognizable and disturbingly familiar is the devastation of war, the deserted streets, the terrified eyes behind the shutters. What is recognizable is how unrecognizable a space becomes once it has been afflicted by violence. This unmooring of stable spatial coordinates is linked to the visual ambiguity spectral realism mobilizes. If in perspectivist vision one’s eye is guided by a hierarchical construction of space, in spectral realism one’s gaze wanders restlessly, unsure of where to land or what to look at. As in the photographs of traumatic historical events that Ulrich Baer analyzes in Spectral Evidence: The Photography of Trauma (2002), in spectral realism we are confronted with a space that does not accommodate our viewpoint and does not engender a sense of place. A key characteristic of this spatial ambiguity is that it does not necessarily subside as the plot progresses. In fact, in many instances it intensifies as the violence worsens, and it becomes impossible for one’s focus to stay grounded. The substrate upon which stability itself depends literally vanishes into thin air and turns into darkness, water, “niebla en lugar de tierra, niebla y cádavares” (Rosero 2003, 14). As a consequence, efforts to map and effectively navigate the space frequently fail. For both readers and protagonists, the spaces remain unfamiliar, and there is a strong sense of vulnerability and menace. Variability, disorientation, and opaque-\n\nIntroduction 27\n\nness are the coordinates of these spectral topographies of disappearance and desolation. In A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari explain that there are two kinds of spaces: striated and smooth. Striated spaces are “defined by the requirements of long-­distance vision: constancy of orientation, invariance, . . . constitution of a central perspective”; they prioritize and rely on the scopic regime (1987, 494).32 Deleuze and Guattari’s conceptualization of the scopic regime closely correlates to Brooks’s scopophilic impulse in that they both understand perspectivist vision as a device of control and mastery. Therefore, “one of the fundamental tasks of the State is to striate the space over which it reigns” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 385). It is key for a nation to (re)produce a space that is measurable, that has defined boundaries, that can be perceived clearly— in maps, aerial photographs, and so forth—and that has well-­defined geographic and historical landmarks that remain stable through the years. On the other hand, smooth spaces move away from vision and rely instead on what Deleuze and Guattari call “haptic” perception: “Where there is close vision, space is not visual, or rather, the eye itself has a haptic, nonoptical function: no line separates earth from sky, which are of the same substance; there is neither horizon nor background nor perspective nor limit nor outline or form nor center” (1987, 494). Striated spaces are part of the ontopology of presence that seeks to turn space into territory in order to control and dominate it, both economically and physically, through militarization, while the smooth spaces advanced by spectral realism relate to Derrida’s hauntology. If ontopology grounds and stabilizes, hauntology sets into motion and seeks to transform. If ontopology is tied to the “stable and presentable determination of a locality, the topos of territory, native soil, city, body in general” (Derrida 2006, 103), hauntology is “an interpretation that transforms the very thing it interprets” (63). Cities are the striated spaces par excellence, while smooth spaces are sites that retain a sense of placelessness, since they cannot be measured or contained by metric systems or cartographic abstractions. Spectral realism embraces haptic perception and explores the possibilities of smooth spaces. As Santiago Lozano, the assistant director of La sirga, explains, the difficulty of seeing in La sirga creates a more holistic sensory experience. La sirga is not a film that can merely be watched. It has to be experienced as an atmosphere. It has to be absorbed through the pores: “Esos espacios donde no te muestran las cosas literalmente, donde no hay una narración evidente son las que te pueden dejar entrar en una atmósfera. [La sirga] es una película totalmente atmosférica. . . . No es una cosa que le entra a uno ni por los ojos ni por los oídos, sino por los poros” (Navas 2012).\n\n28 Haunting without Ghosts\n\nSound constitutes another distinctive trait of this multisensory configuration of space. Spectral realism heightens auditory perception. As vision becomes increasingly obscured and unreliable, sound plays a greater role in the creation of the atmosphere that permeates these works. In Specters of Marx, Derrida notes that “the spectral rumor resonates, it invades everything” (2006, 169). As previously noted, this auditory haunting is present in Pedro Páramo and extends to spectral realism. Characters and readers are surrounded by shreds of conversations that do not necessarily generate cohesive and coherent speech, are frightened by dreadful moans, or are interpolated by voices that cannot always be identified. But haptic perception is not only about voices; it is also about sounds. If the emphasis on (in)visibility invites us to experience a mode of seeing through the mist—and not in spite of it—what at first seems like silence or background noise takes prevalence. Miguel Hernández, the sound designer of La sirga, encapsulates this idea well when he says that as spectators we must “descubrir esa otra sonoridad, esa otra sonoridad que no es evidente, que no es estridente, que no es como la ciudad” (Navas 2012). This “otra sonoridad,” or other sonority, is a fundamental part of the haptic perception and the smooth spaces that spectral realism seeks to create. The insistent pattering of raindrops on the hostel’s tin roof and the constant howling of the wind in La sirga are as important to the story as the film’s scarce dialogues. But perhaps the best example of this sonority that is neither “evident” nor “strident” can be found in Felipe Guerrero’s Oscuro animal. The film, which tells unrelated stories of three women seeking to flee armed conflict and reconstruct their lives, relies entirely on environmental sound. In its 107 minutes, nobody speaks. But the film is not silent or unintelligible. It is teeming with background sounds and subtle visual cues to which the viewer is likely not accustomed to paying attention, thus making the film confusing and exasperating for many viewers. The absence of an omniscient and reliable narrative voice, explicitly providing the information we have come to expect when making sense of cinematic story lines, understanding the details of the historical context, penetrating the innermost secrets of the characters, and figuring out the space, makes viewers restless and uncomfortable and requires a readjustment of their expectations and senses. Furthermore, as Felipe Guerrero says, this “dispositivo sonoro radical,” or radical auditory device, is not vacuous formalism, it is a “propuesta política” that uses the power of “verbal absences” (International Film Festival Rotterdam 2016a) to raise awareness about how, in war-­ridden contexts, silence is more often than not the result of (sexual, physical, and other forms of racial and gender) violence, an imposed individual and col-\n\nIntroduction 29\n\nlective situation that seeks to efface or repress the memory of the very acts and conditions that bring it into being. Therefore, this “other sonority,” as well as the realignment of the senses and the uneasiness it produces, is key to encouraging a more active engagement with space and a reflection upon one’s own positioning within recent Colombian history. Through its haptic reworking of vision, sound, and space, spectral realism performs a readjustment of the senses that expands the limits of ontopology. The treatment of sound in these films (and in spectral realism more broadly) brings to the fore what Ana María Ochoa Gautier (2014, 118), drawing on Idelber Avelar, calls “a politics of the unsaid.” That is to say, the films embrace a mode of auditory perception that seeks to listen to “the spectral history of silencing” (119). This is of great relevance in contexts of extreme violence and national refounding, because, as Ochoa also highlights, it begets questions about whose voices count as legitimate interpellators of the state, particularly in times of major sociopolitical transitions, be it the postcolonial period examined by Ochoa or the postaccords era dawning in Colombia. Through its haptic reworking of vision, sound, and space, spectral realism performs a readjustment of the senses that expands the limits of ontopology. But doing so requires letting go of the temporal coordinates of modernity that structure and govern the pace, functioning, and discourse of the city and the state and entrusting oneself to the disruptive temporality of the specter. The Disjointed Temporality of the Specter Specters produce disjointed times.\n\nAlberto Ribas-­Casasayas and Amanda Petersen, Espectros\n\nAllá te acostumbrarás a los de repentes. Juan Rulfo, Pedro Páramo\n\nSpecters are figures of the untimely. Their (re)appearance disjoints the assumed homogeneity and universality of modern time, actualizes foreclosed elements of the past, and inscribes responsibility for the unresolved onto the present. As Rory O’Bryen explains, “Spectres . . . disrupt the ordering of time in ontological terms of a succession of ‘états présents.’ They are ‘revenants,’ the ‘return of the repressed,’ but belong exclusively neither to the past, present or future. Instead, they bring about the experience of a more profound ‘anachronicity’ putting time itself ‘out of joint.’ Secondly, such ‘anachronicity’ is political and stands for the postponement of mourn-\n\n30 Haunting without Ghosts\n\ning and justice” (2008, 23). The political “anachronicity” of the specter is key in the Colombian context, particularly in the wake of the government’s peace agreements with the two main illegal armed forces in the country, the AUC in 2003 and FARC in 2016. These massive historical events have prompted a rhetoric of postconflict that, fueled by powerful economic interests, uses the discourse of progress and development to encourage rapidly overcoming the wreckage of war. According to this narrative, the armed conflict is a regrettable but now resolved hiatus from the teleological vision of the nation, the biggest roadblock to the fulfillment of its promise of well-­being and abundance. To get back on track, the country should abandon its anachronistic ways and struggles and reinsert itself into the homogenous chronology of history as soon as possible. The “post” in “postconflict” denotes a will toward closure, an urge to just move on. But is it enough to just move on? Is there a way to welcome the future in a more just manner? Spectral time reminds us that when injustices have been committed, there is something to be acknowledged, grappled with, and requited, not simply surpassed. Furthermore, even though much has changed, violence has not stopped in Colombia. Drug cartels continue to wreak havoc and profit from the criminalization and growing consumption of narcotics, led by the United States; guerrilla factions that did not demobilize or that have rearmed harass and cause panic in the civilian population; and criminal organizations such as the Águilas Negras and the Rastrojos still extort, deal drugs, engage in illegal mining, and rape and murder for a living. Thus, with T. J. Demos (2013), I consider the term “neoconflict” more appropriate, as “neo” signifies a continuation by other means. This persistent violence must be emphasized as a guard against a teleological vision of the nation. The “temporal unruliness of haunting” (Lim 2009, 12) allows for discrepant temporalities to coexist and presents a way to resist the homogenizing thrust of modernity’s linear chronology. The return of the specter alters the presumed emptiness and homogeneity of modern time. The unsettled grievances it represents disrupt uniform chronology by pointing to those who are missing from historical time, either because they were assassinated, displaced, or kidnapped or because they were unseen or unheard in its making. By assuming the unruly temporality of the specter, spectral realism denaturalizes modern conceptions of temporality and encourages the disruption of a historical discourse that claims to have exhausted other possibilities of being in time and space. But this does not mean that all violence is the same. One must be cautious not to obliterate historical context by equating events that vary in scope, actors, and consequences. As O’Bryen aptly explains, spectrality does not\n\nIntroduction 31\n\nforeclose careful contextualization; it requires it, because it conceives of violence as “historical but not dated” (2008, 23). That is to say, what spectrality questions is the “fixity” and “pastness” of historical violence, or the portrayal of violent situations as enclosed and bygone events that do not, and should not, affect, much less disrupt, the present. Through its temporal disruption, spectrality supports a contextual historical understanding of violence more aligned with what Slavoj Žižek has famously conceptualized as objective violence.33 Instead of remaining captivated by the “all-­too-­visible” (Žižek 2008) and gruesome acts of subjective violence that commonly dominate cultural production, media discourses, and historical narratives, spectral realism rarifies temporality as a way of shedding light on how certain forms of historical becoming, social understandings, and daily habits systematically efface the structural oppressions that underlie and constitute them. By immersing the viewer or reader in a haunted temporality that moves slowly and capriciously, and by insisting on what remains unknown, unresolved, and unmourned, these works point out, as Žižek suggests, that the persistence of violent dynamics that continue to constitute everyday life for thousands of people in Colombia and around the world, as well as the enduring consequences of disavowed individual and collective trauma, “ha[ve] to be taken into account if one is to make sense of what otherwise seems to be ‘irrational’ explosions of subjective violence” (2008, 2). Hence, the works I analyze in this book decelerate and confound temporality, not in order to escape historical specificity but as a way of allowing systemic and symbolic conditions of dispossession and violence to acquire a fuller meaning by encouraging the reader or viewer to experience the pensive, historically imbued, multidirectional, and unresolved temporality of the specter. In these works, time is elliptical, capricious, and “out of joint” (Derrida 2006, 20). It moves slowly, it accelerates, it halts. It is pensive, it weighs, it brings back. It is subjective and questions the assumed universality and cultural neutrality of modern time. As is the case with vision, this is partly done through spectral realism’s emphasis on disappearance. Avery Gordon notes that “death exists in the past tense, disappearance in the present” (2008, 113). The suspension of time produced by disappearance, and the impediment to closure that it brings with it, is embedded in both diegetic and narrative time. Characters, readers, and spectators experience the temporal unfastening of the specter. For example, as Los ejércitos progresses—if such a word can be used in this context—it becomes increasingly difficult to measure time. From the beginning of Evelio Rosero’s novel, temporal references are tainted by doubt due to the unreliability of the narrative voice. But after the disappearance of the protagonist’s wife, Otilia, either a question\n\n32 Haunting without Ghosts\n\nmark or explicit expressions of skepticism begin to accompany references to days and time. This gesture culminates in chapter 17, in which all of the sections start with a day of the week followed by a question mark. By the end of the novel, the reader has given up on establishing a timeline and has to agree with the protagonist, Ismael, that “no era posible adivinar qué horas eran” (Rosero 2007, 196). In Réquiem NN, Juan Manuel Echavarría’s documentary about the practice of adopting unidentified bodies, known as NNs, that float down the Magdalena River in a remote town in Colombia, narrative time is elongated and punctured by the long and idle sequences of the river and its whirlpools and the unpredictable disruption of the tombs of the NNs throughout the film. The prolonged shots of tree trunks caught in the swirls of the river and of vultures waiting patiently and attentively at the shore, as well as the capricious reappearance of the graves interlaced without diegetic justification, make the simple act of looking a disquieting and uncanny experience. The film suspends the viewer in the whirls of the Magdalena, and, because one already knows that the river is the watery grave of the region’s disappeared, one now looks at it with fright and expectation. Echavarría’s river simultaneously pushes things forward and brings them back. The camerawork and temporal disruption of the film turn the river into an eerie and haunted site, a space that acknowledges what has been lost but refuses to lose it completely. In doing so, the film appeals to the pensive, disruptive time of hauntology—the transformative time of the specter. Spectral realism also escapes the trappings of nostalgia. If the past haunts the present, it does not do so in an idealized form. In that sense, spectral realism is far removed from Fernando Vallejo’s melancholic conjuration of beloved ghosts, his bourgeois lament of times gone by, and his overuse of the ubi sunt trope. What the irruption of a different temporality mobilizes in spectral realism is not a longing for a lost paradise but a demand for justice; a call to action that comes from the past but is actualized in the present, in the name of the future. As Gordon explains, “Haunting, unlike trauma, is distinctive for producing a something-­to-­be-­done” (2008, xi). The return of the specter hopes to set characters, readers, and spectators into motion (Derrida 2006, 192), redirecting us toward a “something-­to-­be-­done” in the name of justice. Alongside the haptic reworking of vision and space, the temporal disruption of spectral realism provides an alternative in order to address ethical concerns regarding the complex relation between artistic representation and historical violence at the core of Colombian cultural production.\n\nIntroduction 33\n\nEthical Anxieties, from “Pornomiseria” to Spectral Realism The tension among representation, violence, and ethics is neither limited to Colombia nor new. As María Helena Rueda (2011) points out, violence has been at the heart of cultural production in Colombia for most of the twentieth century, and questions about the ethical implications of its aesthetic representation have haunted writers, filmmakers, and artists for years. In the first chapter of her book La violencia y sus huellas, Rueda argues that this dilemma was succinctly articulated in an open letter that José Eustasio Rivera, the author of La vorágine (1924), wrote in response to a harsh critique of his novel. Tormented by the reception of his novel, Rivera wrote: “Dios sabe que al componer mi libro no obedecí a otro móvil que el de buscar la redención de esos infelices que tienen la selva por cárcel. Sin embargo, lejos de conseguirlo, les agravé la situación, pues sólo he logrado hacer mitológicos sus padecimi"
