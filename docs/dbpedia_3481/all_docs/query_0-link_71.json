        "text": "monográfico · La Razón y la Emoción en Política\n\nThe heroes of the Spanish Embassy in Nazi Budapest\n\nArcadi Espada\n\nPart One\n\nIn John Ford’s film The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962), Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) becomes an archetypal hero for shooting and killing Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin), the paid stooge of the cattle barons. But Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) -literally hidden in the shadows- is really the man who shoots him. Stoddard gets Doniphon’s girl and goes on to a spectacular career -governor, senator, etc. Doniphon is the unsung hero. After many years, Stoddard, following Doniphon’s death tells a local newspaper editor what really happened, but the editor refuses to print it, “This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend1».\n\nErrol Morris, The Ashtray\n\n1 «This is the West, Sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend».\n\nI took the long way to Budapest. The reason for my trip was Angel Sanz Briz, the young diplomat who saved the lives of thousands of Jews in the terrible Hungarian winter of 1944. I was going there to tell his story and my concern was to make it a happy one. There were some happy stories in the Shoah. Striking, insignificant. The importance of the Shoah, and its significance, lies in the Nazi success. It’s true that they lost the war, but first they managed to murder six million Jews. In 1941, Heinrich Himmler, commander-in-chief of the SS, informed Rudolf Höss that Auschwitz would not merely be a “place of affliction” but the largest “killing centre” ever built. It was.\n\nHence, anyone wishing to write a pleasing, even optimistic and uplifting, episode about the Jewish genocide must first establish how rare this is. Journalism is always positioned at the crossroads between what’s important and what’s interesting. The story of Sanz Briz, like so many other heroes from the European winter, is interesting. But far less significant than the vast, mute piles of bodies that nobody could save.\n\nHowever, it was not enough for me to simply state this. So, I chose to travel with a body. Someone who would whisper in my ear “Don’t forget that I died” when faced with the phenomena of triumphant heroism. For the previous two years I had been working alongside other writers to trace the life of a woman born in Frankfurt in 1904, who lived in Berlin and ended up in Auschwitz, and had been Josep Pla’s1 lover in his Berlin days. It was for Aly Herscovitz that I wished to travel to Budapest from Paris, following in the final steps of her life, from her arrest by the French police on July 22nd, 1942, probably in an apartment in Square de l’Averyon, in the Batignolles district, recorded as her last residence.\n\nAly was a victim of the Vélodrome d’Hiver or “Vel d’Hiv” roundup, that infamous chapter in French history that the country took half a century to acknowledge. From the early morning of July 16th, seven thousand Jews (many of them children) were hoarded together, with practically no food or water, in a heinous act of inhuman contempt. Like many of those detained, Aly was transported to the concentration camp of Drancy, a suburb on the outskirts of Paris. There on the site of a modern and well-intentioned social housing estate under construction, French collaborationism had organized its main point of departure for the killing camps.\n\nI arrived in Cité de la Muette, in Drancy, on a summery Sunday at noon. My problems began straight away. First with the photographs. La muette is actually a housing estate today and the sole sign of the tragedy that occurred here is a set of sculptures commemorating it with an allegorical train on a track to nowhere. There is a sign stuck to the wagon that reads:\n\nHOMMES 40 CHEVAUX en long 82\n\nSince the sky is stormy and sharp August light shines, I take a few style photos. Until a blush spreads over my face: I had tried to protect myself by travelling with a body, but still couldn’t resist getting the best shot of things! An early lesson. I’d be ready for when I got to Krakow and saw the tourist sign with a beautiful sunset over the wires of Auschwitz. Although I had already received a lesson on the difficulties of representing death: in Jorge Semprún’s pages of La escritura o la vida that so beautifully narrated the murder of a German soldier, while his back was turned, on the banks of a calm river as he sang La Paloma in a clear voice, where the deliberate ambiguity of the writing, or perhaps of life itself, makes it impossible to tell whether it was Semprún or his comrade, who ultimately pulled the trigger.\n\nShould we equally photograph the red-tinted Taj Mahal, the Eiffel Tower, the Coliseum or Auschwitz at sunset? No. Should we photograph the body about to commit suicide through the windows of the Twin Towers with the same intention as the joyous flight of an Olympic diver towards the water of the swimming pool? No.\n\nLa Muette does not seem like a comfortable place. And I’m not just referring to the inevitable literary reference to one of the definitions of muette, meaning lair: I have gone to great lengths to avoid those traps. It’s that the atmosphere and the buildings have the appearance of being even more social than they were back then. On the ledge of one building, on the mezzanine floor, there’s a ripped-up sofa. It could be photogenic for the Museum. I take a quick wander around the perimeter. Even quicker when I come across a group of young guys who haven’t gone to bed yet and are going through the usual shouting rites before the knives get taken out. There’ve been more than a few cases of the onlooker becoming the victim.\n\nI returned to the car and then to Paris. I had already discarded a trip to the geriatric home in Arbonne la Forêtt to speak to Robert Herscovitz’s mother, who was also Aly’s sister-in-law. She must have been one of the few people still alive who had known Aly; but from what she had said on the phone, she had only briefly glimpsed her on the street once. And her willingness to collaborate had been only relative. She was already very elderly and just wanted to die, she shouted to me one evening through the phone speaker her son had activated so we could hear her vigorous voice, loaded with contempt; engaging us in one more incident of what must have been a long and painful enmity, while we gasped for air in that crammed trader’s apartment, marked by a nomadic chaos replete with so many echoes of the Herscovitz family’s entire lifetime.\n\nThe families. Given that my job so often consists of resuscitating the dead, I am duty-bound to deal\n\nwith them. There are two main groups: those who put themselves at the service of the dead and those who put the dead to their service. I prefer the latter. The dead person is the affair of the living. The instructions of the dead regarding how they should be remembered should be ignored if their heirs so choose. Memory brings with it myriad problems and benefits: it is only fair for those who are going to experience them to decide how to handle them. «In his memory…», this common invocation, only means in our own interest. In our just interest. It is not clear how a dead person should be any different for their families than for a biographer, that is, the raw material for a series of moral or economic benefits. It is worth acknowledging this and acting accordingly. The dead person will never rise up and give an opinion if not through the living. A large part of the evocative efficacy of Robert Herscovitz regarding his aunt Aly and the rest of their family (documents, photos, correspondence) was linked to his demands for compensation from the French state: the police who took part in the roundups were French, the employees of the trains that took them to Auschwitz were French. Who, in all honesty, could reproach Robert for acting in his best interests. If it weren’t for the fact that she’d have to speak through her mouth, I’d say that even the dead person would be interested.\n\nThe family of Sanz Briz never knew what to do with their hero. Even now their actions are marked by uncertainty. Their case is an authentic example of the extent to which memory is a matter of any given present. According to Josep Pla’s calculations, the most important conversation in a lifetime can be wrapped up in seven minutes. I agree. I don’t even need seven lines to explain why Ángel Sanz Briz, born in Zaragoza in 1910, is the main material for this book. Between June and December of 1944, while responsible for the Spanish legation in Budapest, this diplomat gave refuge and protection to thousands of Hungarian Jews threatened by Nazism. By today’s standards, this would have guaranteed immediate, constant and inextinguishable honour. And yet, for years he has been a dormant hero.\n\nThe first appointment took place in Madrid, in the Salamanca district in which Pilar Sanz-Briz (hyphenated by her father when the children were adolescents) lived with her husband,\n\nJosé García Bañón, also a diplomat, who had worked with his father-in-law in numerous embassies. It was an interesting dinner. The maid served vichyssoise and hake in a sauce. The latter on a grand platter along with its menacing serving utensils. As per usual in these situations, the maid in pure complicity with her lordships, served me haughtily and silently: after all your glibness everyone is going to know who you are now. As we were served, my hosts looked the other way, the most painful way to look in these cases. There was a great burst of talk when Pilar alluded to some neighbours, saying of them:\n\n—Ah, but that lot are terribly hoity-toity…\n\nThe grammar and human appeal of the hero’s daughter have clearly benefited from the combination of Madrid’s Salamanca district, the Quijanos (Cantabrian bourgeoisie stock) on her mothers’ side and a life of travel.\n\nBack in the drawing room, I had left a book that had just come out in Italy on the table: Giorgio Perlasca: un italiano scomodo, by the journalists Dalbert Hallenstein and Carlotta Zavattiero. The hors d’oeuvre had sufficed to understand that Perlasca was a sort of family taboo.\n\nPerlasca, born in Como in 1910, a meat trader by profession who suffered Nazi persecution after the fall of Mussolini, had been given refuge by Sanz Briz in the legation. He remained in Budapest until the arrival of the Russians in January 1945, weeks after the Spanish diplomat had abandoned both the city and the direct control over the Jews under his protection. It was well known that Perlasca had pretended to be his substitute and this impersonation had saved many lives. The book, a defence of his behaviour, included some surprisingly cruel paragraphs about Sanz Briz. One of them directly attacking the Achilles heel of his memory:\n\n«He had but one sole objective: to leave Hungary and save his lover, a beautiful Hebrew woman, the baroness Podmaniczky, owner of the house in front of the Spanish legation».\n\nNever before this paragraph has Sanz Briz’s decision been attributed to anything but compliance of ministerial orders, in light of the imminent Russian invasion.\n\nHis daughter, Pilar, reacted with delightful moral protestations to the possibility of the aristocratic lover. And contributed some aspects of her father’s life back then to the conversation. The fact that he had been married for two years, was about to have his second daughter (she would be born in October 1944) and that he had also suffered a trepanation in one ear, leaving him irritable and unable to stand noise for a long time. I observed her, touched by her vehemence, but thinking of other equally truthful situations that contradicted her. The fact that his wife, Adela, had left Budapest towards the end of winter, already pregnant. The evidence, made plain in multiple diplomatic centres around the world, that Sanz Briz was a man at least as attractive as the women procured for him. And last but…, the poetic impact of the love-war combination, that affects the protagonists of a story at least as much as its chroniclers.\n\nNonetheless, what truly worried Pilar was not the sentimental question, but the possibility of a woman rather than common sense or the Spanish government having given her father the order to leave; that an inconvenient shadow of frivolity might hang over the hero. I thought that Perlasca’s accusation was going to be tough to prove, there was no evidence of it apart from his word, proclaimed by proxy, and without any recordings, the publication of which had been delayed ten years (the same number Perlasca had been dead for) from the moment it had supposedly been voiced.\n\nIn addition to the orders of his government, common sense, perhaps love, and fear may also have been decisive factors.\n\nA fear, moreover, that had a name, the fear of the Bolshevik. Our hero was qualified to feel it. On July 18th, 19363, Ángel Sanz Briz was working in the Ministry of State. He was 25 years old and had been working in the diplomatic corps for three.\n\n«On the date the glorious National Movement began I was in Madrid, providing my services to the Protocol Section of the Ministry of State. This situation […] placed me in a position that allowed me to assist a substantial number of fellow countrymen persecuted by sympathisers of the Movement, in collaboration with the diplomatic delegations of Germany, Italy and Argentina…».\n\nThe paragraph, taken from his purging file, went on to give an exhaustive account of his rebel merits and formed the nucleus of the depositions Sanz Briz would make available to the authorities of the Franco regime to demonstrate his commitment to the cause. His arguments would take slightly over a year to be definitively accepted, following an initial ruling against him. The new authorities’ distrust appeared to be unfounded if we take the obligatory ambiguities of the fifth-columnist4 into account. A letter from Agustín de Foxá, a colleague in both trade and defection, cleared up any suspicion of collusion with the Republican authorities:\n\n«None of the diplomats from Madrid have presented their resignation. To do so in that inferno would have been a death sentence. When six of us departed from Madrid, we gave our word to our colleagues not to resign, as they were left hostages. Hence, we cannot resign, but it is essential that you communicate to the Council of Burgos that of those 6, four, whose names I will give in due time, have the firm intention of boycotting the Madrid Government in every way possible.\n\nWe will only resign if sent to buy weapons. Be careful with this letter, we would not want it to compromise you. If necessary, burn it. Be extremely careful.\n\n[…]\n\nP.S.—The other diplomats in question are: Ramón Sáenz de Heredia, R. Martínez Artero and Ángel Sanz Briz».\n\nThere is further, compelling testimony to his conspiration in Republican Madrid and his enthusiastic activity in the Estación de Mediodía5, at the time a sinister place in which the fate of many of those hoping to escape was determined. For instance, the testimony of the secretary of the German Embassy in Salamanca, present in the depositions document under the simple name of Fischer:\n\n«I know for certain, from my own experience and the testimony of colleagues, that V. did excellent work close to the Red Committee of the Estación de Mediodía in Madrid, and that at great personal risk, due to the frequent altercations with said committee, he facilitated the departure of a great number of persecuted people from Madrid. When it came to the escape of Miss Pilar Primo de Rivera, at immediate risk of death, his collaboration with this Embassy was decisive, obtaining the diplomatic stamp for her passport that made evacuation possible».\n\nAnd even Agustín de Foxá himself, in Madrid de corte a cheka, illuminated the Estación de Madrid with his jaundiced moon:\n\n«The yellow moon had risen. He saw the road up to the Botanical Gardens at the entrance to the station, where he used to buy the old books by Moratín and Villaroel, and the dark stain of the Retiro park, that enclosed his childhood, and the cupola of the Observatory, where his father used to take him after school, to see the moon through the telescope. There were practically no automobiles at the station. The illuminated clock marked nine. Celia and Pilar sat on the benches, beneath the tourist posters advertising beaches and spas, and a yellowed page, with the full railway regulations in tiny print. Beside them were some provisions and a basket of chickens, gifts from the farmers around Madrid to the unions. They walked onto the platform.\n\n—We need to get through the Controls Committee.\n\nThat would be the riskiest moment. Comrade Rico, surrounded by militiamen, was scrupulously examining each passport. Another militiaman called out to one of the travellers, a pale young man who replied in a trembling voice.\n\n—How could you be Mexican; you’re the marquis of Mezquitilla.\n\nThey arrested him. He was shaken. And so, that man already drowning in the port, tossed and turned.\n\n—Call the Embassy yourselves.\n\nHis wife and children were already on the train. And she was waving her arms from the window. She wished to stay with her husband. They took him to the Committee and a railway man said:\n\n—They should have just shot him on the tracks ».\n\nStations are decisive places. They indicate the precise instant in which somebody will stop\n\nbeing what they were. The instant of going from life to death, for example. The Nazi crime was linked to the stations because transportation to the concentration camps was via train. In some cases, like Birkenau, the train conveniently dropped travellers at the foot of the gas chambers. If anyone got on a train in Nazi territory, their fate was sealed, which is why so many of the tales of rescue take place in stations. All the fictitious accounts written or filmed about Sanz Briz have presented him, at one point or another, at the station of Józsefváros, the point of departure for crime in Budapest, rescuing Jews on the brink of the final whistle. None of these stories, however, has achieved the level of reliability of Secretary Fischer’s railway testimony. In any case, the Sanz Briz of the Budapest Winter did have a precedent in the Estación de Mediodía in Madrid. An uncomfortable precedent for collective memory. Trains, passports, embassies as refuges, lists of protected persons: Madrid and Budapest shared war, totalitarianisms and the humanitarian work of a Spanish officer.\n\nBefore arriving in the Hungarian station, this officer had already brilliantly confronted Nazism. In August of 1933, the Republic sent a group of aspiring diplomatic corps candidates on a study\n\ntrip that travelled Central Europe for almost three months: Czechoslovakia, Germany and Poland. On his return to Zaragoza, the young Sanz Briz wrote a Travel Diary recounting the conferences given in a school in Geneva. Trade, history, social trends…, it all fit into these master classes. Sanz Briz proved himself to be an intelligent and well-educated youth, capable of ordering and presenting his ideas didactically. The memoirs, written six years before the start of the Second World War, included a four-page prologue in which the German dualism, before it became topical, was presented with rare premonitory force.\n\n«Wannsee and Cribintzsee [Griebnitzsee]. Small boats navigate the river, carried by the gentle current. It’s a holiday and Fritz and Gretchen are immersed in the cult to Nature. The lakes are like mirrors reflecting the green hills of the landscape ».\n\nThus, began his memoirs. At night, the young candidate went to the theatre. And there, Fritz and Gretchen rubbed shoulders with eight thousand spectators raising their arms in a Nazi salute.\n\n«This contrast constitutes the obsessive memory of our pleasant excursion through Central Europe. In Germany itself it is possibly more than an obsession. The war-mongering psychosis versus the peaceful anxiousness of Fritz and Gretchen, yearning for a life of calm and serenity, form a dualism that is too strong to build a reassuring regime on ».\n\nThe Nazi crime was always surrounded by tenderness. Goethe’s oak and the Buchenwald camp. The lyrical lake of Wannsee, on the banks of which a handful of Nazis decreed the final solution. There is no doubt that Sanz Briz observed this dialect with rare precocity, far before it was on the tip of everyone’s lips.\n\nStill on the trail of the dead. In the morning, before Muette, just after landing in Orly, I made\n\nmy way to Fontenay-aux-Roses to walk in Léautaud’s garden, burial ground of his animals and memories. A plaque overgrown with weeds attests to this: «Dans ce pavillon… vécut Paul Léautaud… écrivain français… Étranger a toute foi et a toute inquiétude philosophique2». I was like that when I was young, carefree. It has been confirmed that Léautaud died marvellously, without any deterioration. A couple now lives in the house. All living things are vulgar. That is perhaps the worst literary affliction, and perhaps the only one I haven’t managed to free myself of. At sunset, back in Paris and on my way to the bistro, I walk around the Place de l’Hôtel-de-Ville. Tonnes of sand have been poured over it, with the crass intention of turning it into a beach. A few indifferent youths play volleyball. I abominate and curse it. The scene is worthy of a maid’s bedroom poster: the snow of Kilimanjaro sticking out behind the domes of Venice’s San Marco: the mermaid of Copenhagen in the midst of a desert: or this Paris beach. My dinner, though irrelevant, triggers a thought. What if the entire reconstruction of the past is just one of those posters.\n\n2 «In this house… lived Paul Léautaud… French author… Stranger to all faith and all philosophical concern».\n\nSanz Briz arrived in Budapest in May of 1942 with the rank of second secretary at the Embassy. He had come from El Cairo, his first diplomatic destination and just a few weeks earlier had married\n\nAdela Quijano, a young lady of the Catalan bourgeoisie. The Spanish legation occupied a Renaissance-style building on Eötvös Street, close to Andrássy Avenue and Budapest’s Western Railway Station, in the heart of the Pest part of the city. It was not the only diplomatic building in the district: the Uruguayan embassy was housed in the building opposite, a delicate pink stone palace owned by the Baroness Podmaniczky. The head of the legation at the time, with the rank of minister, was Miguel Ángel Muguiro. Europe had been at war for two years, but Budapest was still an oasis of calm.\n\nDiplomatic activity consisted of routine commercial exchanges: rabbit furs, Vaseline and oranges. Social life was still ongoing. Sanz Briz was, for instance, one of the hosts of three Spanish journalists invited by the Hungarian government: Javier de Echarri, director of the broadsheet Arriba; Pedro Laín Entralgo, member of Franco’s National Movement and contributor to Pueblo and Enrique Llovet, Press manager of the Falange abroad. Laín summarised the meaning of the visit after a lunch, remembering the short-lived tyranny of the communist Béla Kun, saying vehemently: »The Spanish people hold Hungary in its utmost esteem, as it is the only other country, apart from Spain, to have crushed Communism in its own backyard». Poor Laín. Back then, in the spring of 1943, it was only a question of time before the Soviet Union would conquer the country and establish itself in Hungary for years and years.\n\nGiorgio Perlasca had been in Budapest for a year. Ostensibly, the reason for his visit was trade-related. In the autumn of 1943, he turned to the Spanish legation for the first time in search of protection and a passport. Mussolini had fallen in the summer and he claimed to fear the Gestapo.\n\nUntil the end of the nineteen eighties Perlasca was a nobody. It would be a conversation among ladies in a Berlin salon, that I will describe further on, and the inexorable effect of Schindler’s List that would bring him fame and a name. Between the end of the second world war and the publication of the first account of Perlasca 46 years of almost complete silence went by. Approximately the same number of years as in the case of Sanz Briz. It is hard to explain the causes of such silence; this book will attempt to explain them, but they are not yet fully known. From the nineties on, a few texts by Perlasca appeared, apparently penned shortly after the end of the war. The first is the report, A sua Eccellenza el ministro degli Affari Esteri di Spagna6. The second, the so-called Promemoria, a more detailed description of the facts that occurred during the Budapest Winter, about which, however, there are a number of paratextual doubts.\n\nOn the first page of the report, Perlasca explains that in September of 1943, faced with the aforementioned possibility of detention by the Gestapo, he crossed the threshold of the Spanish legation for the first time:\n\n«I presented myself to Mr. Ángel Sanz Briz, who was the first secretary to the Spanish Legation in Budapest at the time and whom I was already acquainted with, to request protection in the face of immediate danger».\n\nPerlasca does not provide any details in the report of his reason for choosing the Spanish to ask for help. In some of his subsequent texts, he alludes to his participation as a volunteer on the Franco side during the Civil War. Indeed, this was how the ex-combatant presented himself to the Spanish authorities. Their reaction was cautious and dilatory. Muguiro wrote to Minister Jordana, detailing the request and a few days later the minister replied:\n\n«Regarding your letter of September 25th, I will telegraph Your Excellency a resolution of the passport application once I have obtained the service details requested urgently. With reference to the rest of the consultation, as there is sustained contrary criteria Your Excellence should abstain should the case present itself».\n\nThe «service details» probably refer to the specific participation of Perlasca in the Civil War. And the ministry definitely did not find anything in the archives to prove this participation. As for the rest, the minister’s reply indicated («sustained criteria») that the Francoist authorities opposed the legation serving as a refuge and the diplomats exercising the right to asylum.\n\nThe road from Paris to Auschwitz runs through the heady fields of Champagne. It’s a sunny\n\nand blustery day, an energetic invitation to travel. Travelling, going in search of something: there’s nothing better in life. Travelling without raising dust is as exciting as Swedish gymnastics. There’s no need for the modern-day fervour, or research or enigma: suffice to follow the trail left by any author on the landscape. Travelling through a place no-one has seen is to travel blindly. Travel should be read first; and done later. Anything else is like discovering America. As for writing, travelling delivers quantum delights: I am still in the Budapest Winter as I journey by car through the fields of Champagne and envisage the Tibidabo mountain in November out the window. And now, in this car, taking advantage of the many kilometres ahead before stopping for the night in Frankfurt, where what is to happen has already been determined, and his first visit to the Spanish legation, let me bring in Chaves Nogales and a paragraph on the siege of Republican Madrid to justify the decisive instruction sent by minister Jordana on the right to asylum. He knew exactly what he was talking about.\n\n«The multiple crimes committed in Madrid by the bands of murderers who lorded it over the capital after the uprising caused thousands of people fearing for their lives to seek refuge under foreign roofs. The legendary right to asylum was broadly granted to all of them and some humanitarian impulse led the Chiefs of Mission to extend the limits of extraterritorial rights, sheltering thousands of Spaniards under their protection without asking them whether or not they were belligerent […] Up to fourteen thousand went so far as to become refugees […] The embassies, legations and consulates alone were insufficient to house so many and each country incorporated their residences into the rights of extraterritoriality, with hundreds and hundreds of Spaniards paying their room and board as if they were in a hotel».\n\nThe truth of Chaves’ account is based not only on his proven authority as a journalist, it is confirmed by various sources. There is no question that the Francoist authorities were well aware of the efficacy of the right to asylum: which is precisely why they refused to grant it. On the other hand, Chaves’ paragraph again takes the similarities between Madrid in 1936 and Budapest in 1944 to a marked lack of specifics. We will see, however, that what was room and board in Madrid turned into a ghetto in Budapest.\n\nOn March 19th, 1944, the German troops invaded Budapest. They no longer trusted Admiral Horthy’s\n\ngovernment, which had kept Hungary relatively on the fringes of Nazi frenzy. The Reich wanted complete Hungarian mobilisation and to accelerate the deportations of Jews, whose lives in the country, though threatened, also represented an exception among the countries controlled by the Axis. There are three Spanish accounts of this moment. The first was by Ambassador Muguiro, addressing his government. There was nothing to distinguish it from the nervous prose of any war correspondent. Nobody could avoid seeing the influence of the official neo-language of the Franco regime in the phrase «persons considered unaligned»\n\n«A series of… German motorised divisions departing outskirts Vienna three a.m. occupied Budapest seven a.m. […] German troops proceeding with numerous detentions, including Home Secretary, some politicians, Jews and persons considered unaligned. Kingdom of Italy legation occupied and staff detained. German Minister himself replaced by noted SS Commander. City appears normal though evacuation beginning. Telephonic communications interrupted. I fear this telegram will be delayed.».\n\nThe second account was by Eugenio Suárez7. At the time, a 24-year-old journalist who had been sent to Budapest by Juan Aparicio, director-general of the regime’s press office, with the goal (confessed years later) of getting him off his back. Suárez sent his articles to a number of Spanish broadsheets, while also writing long and conscientious reports for the authorities of the regime. The Hungarian experience led to Corresponsal en Budapest, a long, scholarly and informed journalist book in the style of his master, Eugenio Montes8. I spoke to Suárez on a number of occasions. The first on the beach of Salinas, when he was about to turn ninety. It was aperitif time and I remember Suárez drinking something red, probably Campari. I was being ceremonious and awestruck. Suárez was a journalist of epic proportions, a veritable legend. He had founded first El Caso and then Sábado Gráfico. If during the Franco dictatorship journalism managed to stay alive, it was thanks to his efforts. He had a somewhat sceptical opinion of Sanz Briz. And when I asked him about Perlasca, he replied laconically:\n\n—Italian.\n\nInvested with the double authority of both writing for the newspapers and for the mission he had been entrusted with, Suárez would take his texts to the Spanish legation and request their transportation to Madrid via the diplomatic pouch. It would appear that Sanz Briz was not terribly fond of this method.\n\n—I think he was jealous of my reports. I don’t like to boast, but I had very good information about what has going on in the city.\n\nSuárez had been in that Budapest and spoke to me of extraordinary people. One such figure was the pouch courier. Every fifteen or twenty days, a man would turn up at the legation on Eötvös, having traversed a warring Europe by train. He was responsible for a zone that included Budapest, Istanbul, Vienna, Berlin and Paris. So important was the pouch to him that he kept it constantly handcuffed to himself, not even uncuffing it in sleep. Suárez remembered that the Budapest courier was called Antonio Martínez Tomás, from La Unión in Murcia9, and that following the war he emigrated to Barcelona where he became the president of the Press Association.\n\nThe reports courier, one of many secondary characters tempting for the author of any book to take a turn with them. So also was the recipient of the reports in Madrid, the press officer of the German Embassy, Hans Lazar. Suárez said to me:\n\n—When the war ended I met Lazar one day in a bar in Red de San Luis. That was when I found out, to my great surprise, that he was familiar with every little detail of my Budapest reports. He praised them. The thing is, that I was sending them to Aparicio, not to Lazar! He was a peculiar man, well-informed, clever and cultured. I believe that in reality he was a double agent, ultimately in the service of the allies. He saw himself as a sort of Lawrence of Arabia, and he was highly intelligent and educated.\n\nI haven’t been able to read all of Suárez’s reports. But the one he includes in his book on the Budapest situation following the German invasion contains a high-quality analysis. And his recall of that instant is moving:\n\n«Budapest continued to party. The honeyed voice of Catalina Kárady was a variety show hit; at the Moulin Rouge, the city applauded the comic genius of a Spanish clown: Charlie Rivel. The Danube had not frozen over and the tziganes were composing new love songs. On March 18th I lunched with one set of friends, and dined with another: good people, happy people, inoffensive people who were committed to their jobs, happy with their lot. Forty-eight hours later, two of them had been hanged. Another couple bore the infamous yellow star on their chest; one of the women, of exquisite education and thirty centuries of Talmudic refinement at her slim back, profound, dark eyes and graceful figure, was sent to a brothel on the Eastern front. The Germans had entered Hungary ».\n\nThe young Suárez not only wrote precise reports and poignant paragraphs. He also saved Jewish lives. I will recount at least one of these, and it is a well known and solemnly acknowledged fact that anyone who saves a life, saves all of humanity. He modestly told me that he had housed the persecuted in his Hungarian villa on more than one occasion. And he mentioned the name Angyal. Georges Angyal. He lived in Geneva, where all men of a certain age and education should live. We exchanged short, specific, almost notarial questions and answers. This paragraph will suffice:\n\n—Could you tell me the circumstances in which Eugenio Suárez saved your life?\n\n—It was after the coup d’état of the Hungarian Nazis. There was a huge sense of insecurity. The city was swimming in armed groups. There was shooting in our district. Eugenio, on the request of my friends who knew him well, came to pick me up two days later and allowed me to stay in his villa, in a residential district, until after he left for Spain. He also drew up a certificate claiming I was his secretary.\n\nThe last account of the moment of the Nazi invasion was personal. A letter from Sanz Briz to his wife, who had been in Spain for two months.\n\n«March 23rd, 1944\n\nThe commotion that has taken place here is incalculable. The Gestapo has detained over 500 people as hostages, approximately half of those rich Jews, and the other half a mix of politicians and aristocrats. The Badoglio Legation [the Legation of Italy] has been occupied and Ferrariis, Voli and the other directors detained. They have also detained Mme. Dampierre; her husband, forewarned in time, has escaped and must be hidden away in some friend’s country house. I have visited Gyula and Eva in case they needed anything. He will go to the countryside tonight to await events. She will remain in her house in Budapest. I must confess that Eva gave me a frankly unpleasant impression in the company of that French escapee that you know of. When a woman becomes hysterical, she is incapable of behaving elegantly and with dignity in even the most important moments, because in my view the situation here is very similar to what happened in Madrid on July 18th, naturally with the exception of the barbarity and vulgarity that took place in our country. […] The exodus to the countryside of all those with estates or properties has begun, particularly those most visible to the authorities. However, it is not so easy to get away from the capital as both the train and the roads are strictly controlled. International telephonic communications have been interrupted and we don’t know whether the official telegrams we are sending these days have reached destination or not. I sent you one the day before yesterday that said, and I quote: “Letter with photos received. Still perfectly fine. In light of circumstances here I believe you must suspend trip. Love”. As I was telling you above, people here are horrified by the situation that has befallen them. You must remember that there are one million Hungarian Jews in this country, 180,000 Polish refugees, Jews, French, Italians, etc., and as you know the majority, particularly the upper classes, are positively anti-German.\n\nAs you can see, the situation is not very appealing and their future highly uncertain and dark. On the other hand, the news from the Russian front is not very promising either.\n\nSome Bolshevik patrols have already set foot in Romania, and with the fall of Vinitza the Red Army is now just over 50 kilometres from our border. A veritable party, in short. In any case, the military advisers estimate that however bad things get, it will be a couple of months before the Russians pose a serious threat to this country as they believe their main objective must be the Ploesti oil fields. Time will tell. I am perfectly fine and pleased with the food reserves I have as I may very well have to use them down the line, although I insist everything is functioning perfectly normally at present. I really liked the photos of our daughter, particularly two of them in which she is clear. I am sorry you have been indisposed and hope it is only temporary.\n\nAnything you desire, from Ángel».\n\nHer indisposition is likely to have lasted nine months. Adela had left Budapest with the intention of returning shortly, without realizing that she was pregnant. Part of the language of the letter made me think how Utopian an account can be when written entirely in the style of the time.\n\n1. « When a woman becomes hysterical, she is incapable of behaving elegantly and with dignity in even the most important moments».\n\n2. «Naturally with the exception of the barbarity and vulgarity that took place in our country ».\n\n3. «A veritable party, in short ».\n\n4. «In which she is clear ».\n\n5. «Anything you desire, from Ángel».\n\nIn another subsequent letter to his wife, the diplomat described the situation the Jews were starting to find themselves in after the German invasion.\n\n«The streets of Budapest are steeped in yellow stars. You would say there is nobody but Israelites in this city. New laws against them are published daily. They have taken away their automobiles, radios, telephones. Blocked their accounts. The bomb victims have occupied their homes, which they must leave within three hours, leaving half their clothes, belongings and furniture behind».\n\nThis letter from the young diplomat had an official equivalent in the report on the Jewish situation sent at the time to the authorities in Madrid by the Spanish minister, Muguiro. Among the aggressions detailed in the report, these special measures against the written word stand out:\n\n«The destruction of literary works written by Jews has begun in the fires created for this purpose. In the workshops of a cardboard factory, the destruction of works took place in the presence of Mr. Kolozsvary, Secretary of State and other figures from the Ministry and the Press. Kolozsvary-Borza made a short speech before putting the first volume into the fire, which turned out to be a book of poetry by Kiss József».\n\nI searched, in vain, for the speech made by the Secretary of State. The presentation of merits must have been interesting to say the least. But there is no doubt that Kiss József certainly had merit. «All that remains of man is his name». A verse he wrote. Reconciling being Jewish with being Hungarian was the main characteristic of both his poetry and his life. A characteristic that ended up on a bonfire.\n\nThe list of atrocities committed against the Jews as a result of the German invasion was the last service Muguiro did to the Spanish state from Hungary. At the end of June, he left Budapest. From the official correspondence we can deduce that his government was fully complicit in his departure. And it was connected to the change in the Hungarian delegation in Madrid, imposed by the German invasion and the new puppet government.\n\nThe Jewish cemetery in Frankfurt is enclosed by a stone wall containing thousands of small\n\nniches each with a tombstone recording, in alphabetical order, the name of a victim of Nazism. It is night by the time I walk along the wall and then head back for dinner. There are fireworks over the river Main. Aly Herscovitz was born here, in 1904, yet everything indicates that her time in the city was brief. In any case, there is no funerary trace of the family. Almost all the niches have one or more pebbles, that Jewish custom of paying homage and remembering the dead. Pebbles do not wither. The wall looks sober and tidy. The gregariousness of death makes me think of the old matter of Jewish obedience, the resigned and sheep-like way they went to death. Another night, months later in Madrid, the incisive intelligence of Stephen Vizinczey would come through:\n\n—Yes, the Jews were obedient. But it wasn’t only them. All society was obedient. Respect for authority, people trusted and feared at a level we would find strange nowadays. If the Holocaust is unrepeatable, it is also because the concept of obedience has flagged.\n\nMy hotel was on the outskirts of Frankfurt. It is surrounded by a park of willows and ponds that Fritz and Gretchen ran through on Sundays. But my room has a view of a shed. From early in the morning, a group of workers haul in metals and tools. I watch them from the window, with a zoological approach, like someone observing a colony of ants that comes and goes. I cannot fully work out their plan, but I’m certain they have one. Like I have mine. Today’s is to reach Dresden to add more blocks to the base of this very long wall. I’m not interested in the reason I’m doing this. I never have been. I just work on commission. I pick things up and take them to a place because someone suggests it and I’m interested in doing so. It might be a book or newspaper publisher, or a less physical entity. What I am sometimes interested in, is what happens during the transportation. Like that afternoon when rounding a corner in Cadiz, a young man leaning against the wall of a warehouse, blew through a Tuba and out came gold.\n\nThe first telegram Sanz Briz sent to his minister after taking charge of the legation following\n\nMuguiro’s departure dealt with the Jewish persecution. It included a translated copy of the letter the Hungarian Primate, Jusztinián Serédi, addressed to his country, recounting the conversations he had held with the new Hungarian authorities on the spread of anti-Semitic measures. The ethical flexibility of this letter is surprising and offers a clear local example of the Catholic Church’s occasional attitude to genocide. All the Cardinal’s efforts were limited to ensuring that the discriminatory policy of the pro-Nazi authority differentiated between Jews and Christian Jews. Thus, for instance, the cardinal asked that Christians not be obliged to wear the yellow star:\n\n«The six-point star is a sign, not of the Hebrew race but of its religion and therefore stands for contrast and apostasy among Christians ».\n\nNot one of the letter’s eleven pages held a hint of a demand or imploration of the Nazi authorities to put an end to their acts of genocide. The «brothers» mentioned, and to whom the primate extended his deepest concern, were just brothers in religion. His correspondent, the president of the Cabinet, Döme Sztójay, was extremely frank in his reply. He categorically denied the cardinal the possibility of allowing the Christian Jews to go without the star (the pro-Nazi authority considered it a merely administrative rather than a religious symbol), although he did not oppose adding a cross to the star. The president went on to very clearly illustrate his point to the cardinal with a fluvial, Danubian, unequivocal metaphor:\n\n«There is no questioning the impossibility of avoiding a rational resolution of the Jewish problem. It is impossible, above all, because each belligerent European state has adopted the correct means in this direction and because should the Hungarian Government choose not to adopt them, such an act would prove that it does not wish to be integrated into the new European order based on new principles: the consequences of this fact would be immeasurably serious for the entire nation as a whole. Szécheny is profoundly right when he says: “If I am on a boat with my son and somebody else’s son and water enters the boat and I find it impossible to keep them both, it’s true that if I throw my son into the water this would be published in the newspapers, but in any case, I would keep my son and throw the other boy into the water”. The lives and future of 13 and a half million Hungarians cannot be risked for the sake of a million Jews ».\n\nSztójay’s paragraph illustrated two of the main principles of the genocide. The evidence that the Hungarian, French or German Jews were no longer attributed a nationality and that this loss immediately lowered their condition: their life was worth less than that of the Hungarians. Killing among brothers is something contenders have always striven to avoid: when an opponent is recognised as a brother, their life is more likely to be spared. The first thing Franco’s generals did to justify their Alzamiento10 was to refer to the brothers as the anti-Spain. That is, they nipped the idea of Spaniards killing each other in the bud. The Republicans put the same theory forward, particularly from 1937 on: the Spanish nation, that is, the Republic was fighting against the major foreign powers —Italy, Germany—. There were no Spaniards on the other side.\n\nThe destruction of the European Jews raises interesting questions about national identity.\n\nIdentity is a fragile and arbitrary phenomenon. Germans had participated in the defence of their country during the First World War, and some of those decorated for their patriotic value were subsequently sent to the gas chambers for being Jews. Their Germanness, so tested over time, was of little use to them in the face of the «true Germans». National identity is not therefore just an objective circumstance, resulting from the place in which a person lives or is born, shared memory or a common culture, but rather an arbitrary, ideological cut, so to speak, whereby some citizens are segregated from the rest. The mechanism was described perfectly by a nationalist politician of Catalan origin, when he came up with this definition of identity:\n\n«A Catalonian is any person living and working in Catalonia, and wishing to be it». In this will, in this apparently inoffensive and even respectful «wishing to be it», nestles the obligatory jurisdiction of the definers: the evidence that to be German, you have to earn it!!\n\nI am writing with half my body in Dresden, a city destroyed sixty-five years ago by the Allied bombs and in which today the only dispute is a bend in the Elba, the picturesque view of which may be damaged by the possible construction of a bridge. Drawn by identity and destruction, the most synonymous antonyms of the Spanish language, the memory of Aly Herscovitz returns to us, her admiration for Germany and its hymns ended in Auschwitz. One morning, five years ago, Sergio Campos purchased a stack of post-war postcards in a flea market in Berlin. One of them, dated May 29th, 1947, was written by Fanny Achs, from Brooklyn, to her friend Olly Gloeckner, who lived in Berlin, probably in the Soviet zone. There are incredible paragraphs in this letter. This one:\n\n«I was very interested to read your letter, although it is sadly depressing because it shows the conditions you were living in there. However, dear Olly, and you will understand this, it is hard for me to show the necessary solidarity with your situation. I mean naturally, and I know this, you had nothing to do with the Nazis and I doubt that you, unlike the majority unfortunately, supported them. We, those of us who were forced to abandon Germany and find ourselves forsaken, like all those who found themselves in our situation and were deported and cruelly executed without scruple in gas chambers, or some similar method – six million Jews in total- we have no interest in Germany being reconstructed so that in twenty or thirty years it can bring horror to Humanity again. We feel bitter, and we cannot forget, because the victims were our nearest and dearest. Of course, there are innocent Germans, but unfortunately they are a minority. They all calmly watched while old and helpless men were mistreated and evicted from their own homes, without their possessions, to be led to certain death. Of course, the German people now need to pay for that. Otherwise, what justice would there be? Responsibility can only be attributed to Germany’s own countrymen and not other countries. From what we are hearing, they do not have the slightest feeling of guilt. Fine, enough on this subject. I just wanted to make my opinion clear to you. I will be glad when in a year and a half I can definitively waive my German nationality, as since my husband is American, I too will become American. One of my biggest worries during the war was to be considered German, as I wanted to have nothing to do with everything that was happening. I didn’t want to then, and I don’t want to now ».\n\nGermans, indeed, were all those living and working in Germany and wishing to be German.\n\nJewish persecution, along with the Soviet invasion, were at the heart of communications\n\nbetween Sanz Briz and his government. The Hungarian primate’s letter was soon followed by a telegram describing the spread of new anti-Semitic measures, such as the prohibition of Jews speaking to each other from window to window or the creation of a room for Christian neighbours in the safer part of the shelter. His humanitarian interest was politically reinforced after July 5th, 1944. On this date, the Spanish ambassador in Portugal, Nicolás Franco, the General’s brother, was in Lisbon with two eminent Jewish leaders.\n\nThere was a man and a plan behind this meeting with the ambassador. The man was Javier Martínez de Bedoya, a former Falangist from Asturias who was 30 years old, married to Mercedes Sanz Bachiller, founder of the charity, Auxilio Social, and widow of Onésimo Redondo, formally appointed to the Spanish Embassy in Lisbon as head of press though, in reality, he had been entrusted a secret mission by the Spanish Foreign Minister, Count Jordana. Eugenio Suárez was the first person to mention Bedoya to me, in our conversation in Salinas.\n\nHe could play down the role played by Perlasca, or even Sanz Briz, but he had no doubt that Bedoya had been key in the operations aimed at saving European Jews with Spanish participation. Suárez had known and had dealings with him, but his information came from a specific source.\n\n—Bedoya wrote a very interesting sort of memoir and I tried, in vain, to get it published. In it, he had written a detailed description of the role played by himself and Minister Jordana in the operations to save the Jews. It is a fundamental book, but I don’t know how I might get my hands on a copy.\n\nWhat Suárez didn’t know was that the book had eventually been published under the title, Memorias desde mi aldea. But its impact had been non-existent. Bernd Rother, who mentioned Bedoya in passing in his canonical volume, Franco y el Holocausto, did not give any hint of having read it either. A completely minor fact contributed to its importance. Though published in 1996, it had been written far earlier, because Bedoya had died in 1991. Hence, before the Schindlers and the diplomatic activity aimed at protecting the European Jews had become a matter of major media interest.\n\nDresden’s Hotel Romantik is the ideal place to write a big book. Here, there’s an effective mix\n\nof Communism and democracy. The former provides deathly silence; while the latter makes the air flow merrily. It is thanks to these two conditions that I hear the moaning pleasure of a woman’s siesta in the room next to mine. At dinner, old questions are posed about Nazism. And the main enigma: whether it was the work of a group of psychopaths that took control of the State or the joint action of a devastating people. Dresden is also the ideal place to talk about the European destiny. In less than 70 years, it has witnessed the passage of the gas chambers, the Allied bombs and Communism. Yet today, it forms part of a country with a risk premium the whole of Europe confides in. This book also raises some old questions. What stands out is that it suggests attributing the Spanish diplomatic activities aimed at saving Jews to both individual action and to government strategy.\n\nBedoya’s reply to the question posed in Dresden was clear and outlined in his memoirs. And\n\neven on his face: Bedoya’s face, or at least the mature Bedoya, denoted more Jesuitism than Falangism. A Lombroso-style, poetical observation of mine, obviously. A more rigorous approach would be to detect the same subtle and intricate traits in his description of the strategy that led to the Spanish protection of thousands of European Jews. According to his memoirs, it all began on October 12th, 1943. The Day of Race in Spain, he underlines. It is a paradoxical coincidence that a Pro-Semitic strategy should begin on such a day. But the chronicler seems aware of even this little detail given that a few years earlier, in a seminal article for the story at hand, published in a weekly publication called FE that aimed to appeal to both Christian virtue and the Spanish Falange, he had written:\n\n«This is the case in Spain with our paradoxical “Fiesta de la Raza”11, which in reality means the complete opposite. In reality, Spain has mixed with all races without any racist or unitary bias, without any prejudice whatsoever. (The essence of Catholicism is anti-racist)».\n\nThe count of Jordana, Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, summoned him to his house at dusk, once the day’s celebrations had ended. He showed him into the sitting room:\n\n«—Dear Bedoya, I intend to bother you again, but first allow me to ask you a discreet question: are you anti-Semitic?\n\n—I never have been.\n\n—In that case, I shall ask you a less personal question: do you feel there might be any element of anti-Semitism in the Falange’s programme?\n\n—Absolutely not; none whatsoever.\n\n—Good, good; could you then do a study of the essential non -anti-Semitism in said programme for me?».\n\nThere was good reason for Jordana’s request. Since the spring of 1943, he had been wrestling with the Falangist wing of the government, led by the Minister of Governance, Blas Pérez12, who was contrary to the first repatriation measures for Sephardi Jews put forward by Jordana. It took Bedoya a week to verify that he was right and send him «four pages» on the matter. The minister called him back at the start of November. He praised his work and explained his foreign policy in light of the hypothetical victory of the Allies («the only outcome he allowed possible»). The programme included the achievement of solidarity between the Jews of the world and Franco’s regime. Bedoya praised his idea, even somewhat hyperbolically, according to his chronicle. Jordana seemed satisfied, and said to him:\n\n«—I’d like to have your support in the Jewish question. I’d like you to move to Lisbon until the end of the war to make the necessary contacts, with authorization to travel wherever necessary from there: the World Jewish Congress works in New York; the Zionist Commission in London; the Jewish Agency in Palestine. We will be able to provide you with the cover of a diplomatic post as Embassy attaché ».\n\nThe Ambassador in Lisbon was the General’s brother, Nicolás Franco. This situation, clearly advantageous for his capacity to operate, was extremely attractive for Jordana’s purposes. By the start of 1944, Bedoya was already settled in Lisbon with his wife and his secretary, a multilingual German Jew called Ernesto Bacharach, who had links to the film industry and in whom Bedoya trusted to ease contacts with his «brothers in race», the terms he used in spite of his FE and his doctrines, to refer to them in his book. The first meeting with the Jewish representatives took place in the Tívoli hotel bar. Bedoya would have preferred somewhere more discreet. Apparently, the bar of the Tívoli had an obscene number of spies per square metre. It would appear that the Jews quickly made their requests known:\n\n«—We’d like a gesture before signing anything, like for instance, the release of around four-hundred haidris Jews [sic: probably mizrajíes] who are in Athens right now and about to be taken to Poland to be exterminated in the gas chambers».\n\nBedoya’s account mentions an interesting piece of information here. The idea of diplomatic protection came from the Jews and not the Francoist authorities. Although it’s likely that these authorities had already considered offering them help preventing deportations in exchange for the «benevolent neutrality of the world’s Jews towards National Spain». The Jews’ consular problems had affected Spain from the outset of the world war. The regime’s attitude to these problems had changed to the rhythm of the Nazi possibilities of winning the war. This was the institutional tune. Afterwards, each man performed it in his own tone. Jordana’s tone had always been one of resistance against the Nazis.\n\ngustín de Foxá, the great writer and diplomat in the Balkans, had also written a report on the Sephardi situation. It contained these two paragraphs:\n\n«Five hundred thousand Jews in the Balkans and the Mediterranean basin uphold, among a people removed from our culture, the old Castilian language from the time of Cervantes, Spanish cuisine, our songs, melodies, sayings and romances, and even our customs, family morality and ways of life. […] This civil servant, during his time in the Balkans has been moved by this echo of Spain, setting aside the race transmitting it. […] Scattered throughout Western Europe and the Mediterranean, they will always constitute a force that for its wealth, social situation, business acuity and trading skill could help Spain, particularly if the course of war causes their opposite numbers to fail in Europe [sic]. Furthermore, their extraordinary racial solidarity causes their influence to extend to other American communities that in turn influence American public opinion through the press and finances».\n\nFoxá’s text contains an important element that helps explain the Franco government’s attitude to the Jews (apart from their fear, humanitarianism and political interest). This element was nationalism. Though it may seem surprising so many years later, what resonates with Foxá and with so many other melancholic patriots, particularly Ernesto Giménez Caballero, is that the Sephardis hold the key (sometimes physical, in the shape of the key to their old homes) to a part of Spain’s past. And above and beyond any racial or religious considerations, the Sephardis are Spaniards in trouble begging for the help of their homeland from afar. Not even the strictest Falangism, that of Blas Pérez or José Luis Arrese, could object to the diplomatic protection measures when in addition to the sentimental argument, sovereign pride was also appealed to. Skilfully exploited by Jordana before his political rivals, the idea could be summarised as the evidence that only Spanish jurisdiction can comprehend a Spanish Jew.\n\nThe meeting in Lisbon’s Tivolí Bar was so positive that it paved the way for the\n\naforementioned official encounter between the ambassador Franco and the Jewish representatives in July, on which Jordana wove one of his elegant diplomatic strategies. With a view acquainting the minister Arrese, secretary-general of the Movement and under whose ministry Bedoya worked as press manager for the Lisbon Embassy, with the meeting between Nicolás Franco and the Jews, in the hopes of gaining his complicity, Jordana asked Bedoya to write a report recounting the Jewish visit and the procedures planned.\n\n«I wrote a quick, draft report for Jordana, he approved it and it was dispatched on April 11th of this year 1944, under number 15E. Neither Arrese nor Arias Salgado [junior minister for Education: Bedoya’s direct superior] ever mentioned or asked me anything regarding its contents and I became convinced that the demands of correct interministerial relations had been met».\n\nBedoya’s skill lay in writing the report as if Jordana were unaware of either the strategy or the relations that had taken place. The report is filed in the Spanish ministerial archives and the wording confirms Bedoya’s account in his memoirs. This is good for his credit, because one of the issues with his book is that due to the confidential, if not secret nature, of the activities described, many of his observations are sustained on his word alone. And sometimes not even. Shortly after Nicolás Franco had received the Jews, Bedoya claimed that they got down to work: «The first issue was to save the four hundred Jews in Greece». And according to Bedoya, he saved them in the blink of an eyelid:\n\n«Our ambassadors in Berlin and Athens had already been mobilised previously, requesting a delay in the transportation in an attempt to take charge of them by claiming their Sephardi ancestry. The German authorities replied: “Get them out of here as soon as possible, you’ll be doing us a favour!” […] Quicker than it takes to recount it, all four hundred Greek Jews had disembarked in Palestine ».\n\nThis wasn’t true. The Greek Jews were deported by the Nazi authorities to various concentration camps, although the majority of them lived to tell the tale and returned to Greece after the Allied victory. The event is described in documented detail by Matilde Morcillo in her book on the diplomatic activity of the Spanish ambassador in Greece. But also by Bedoya himself, in a letter to ambassador Franco, a copy of which exists in the Foreign Ministry’s archives:\n\n«Thus, regarding the Sephardis in Athens, it was impossible to induce Turkey to allow them to travel over its territory in time. Indeed, so much time was lost that Germany ended up definitively transporting them to its territory and once there it is practically impossible, due to transportation difficulties, to think of getting them to Turkey ».\n\nIt is almost quaint to see how Bedoya contradicts himself. And that a document dated the spring of 1944 should correct a book from fifty years later. Sometimes vanity and memory mix to create disturbing effects, and that is the most common risk of memorialism. In his account, Bedoya alternates unquestionable fact with blatant exaggerations. The public archives confirm some, but not always very satisfactorily.\n\nVanity and memories, excursus. A perilous alliance. In La cruda y tierna verdad, José Luis de Vilallonga’s first volume of memoirs, there is an amusing and vivacious account of Lisbon in the decade of the 40’s (and the Estoril of the time, real-life model for Bogart and Bergman’s Casablanca). The chapter begins with these paragraphs:\n\n«For a number of weeks, he had been staying in a very peculiar family hotel comprising a Hungarian jeweller, by the name of Gabor, who had escaped from Budapest, his wife and three daughters. His wife, called Bijou – with far better reason than my father’s sister-, was a spectacular woman of incredible beauty whom her daughters called “the coronel” for her management skills, to be heard all day long. The three daughters, Magda, Eva and Zsa -who would go on to become renowned in the world of show business and money years later- were also sumptuous beauties, though with nothing in common either with their mother or each other. Magda was a red-head, with very pale skin, big green eyes and a body that was ideally suited to doing what she enjoyed most, and which I was soon to discover. Eva -who subsequently married Conrad Hilton and a number of other down-and-outs- was the prototypical American woman of European origin who rubbed her hands together every time she heard mention of money. Zsa-Zsa, the most eye-catching of the three, was terribly ordinary, a highly underrated quality that rendered her one of the most famous women in the world.\n\nThe Gabor family had arrived in Estoril with nothing but the clothes on their backs, apart from three wonderful blue diamonds that the jeweller had managed to hide in the soles of his shoes. They had all settled into four spacious rooms on the top floor, soon to become known as the quartier hongrois, solely accessible to those pretending to enjoy Hungarian cuisine or somehow capable of rapidly improving the economic future of the three sisters.\n\nEvery Thursday afternoon from one to four, to the great desperation of the hotel director, Bijou Gabor offered an extraordinary seasoned goulash prepared on numerous hot plates for a dozen or so guests who were rarely invited again. On this day, Gabor, husband and father, always dined out. I soon realised that one of the four rooms was always left free in case one of the sisters -or even Bijou herself- needed a private interview with one of the guests.\n\nNaturally, all sorts of comments were made about the Gabor girls and their parents in Estoril. That they were all communist spies, that mister Gabor had travelled to Portugal to buy the jewels of those fleeing the red terror at cut-price, that both mother and daughters worked for the American counterespionage services and for the Intelligence Service. Bijou was even accused of having orchestrated for the English the murder of Ismaïl Pachá, found dead in the casino gardens. But many of those who slandered the Gabors would have done anything to appear at the famous Thursday lunches».\n\nThe story continues predictably. Our first Don Juan more or less enamours one of the daughters and has some sort of vaudeville-style fling with her, given that his wife is also staying at the hotel. There’s a glitch in this story, however, from the factual perspective. Least of which is his calling Jolie Gabor by the name of Bijou, because that could just be the influence of the diamonds. It’s possible that Magda Gabor was Vilallonga’s lover, but the truth of the matter is that on Sunday, March 21st, at nine in the morning, she left Budapest by car with Carlos Sampayo, the Portuguese ambassador. Carlos Sampayo, he was her lover. The source is irrefutable. Magda’s mother! And she wasn’t the only source: Eugenio Suárez also explained it in his book, though without mentioning Magda’s name. Obviously, women are capable of anything, and nothing definitive can be added regarding the truth of Vilallonga’s account. He certainly didn’t waste any time if his tale is true. Our Don Juan arrived in Portugal in October of 1945, on his honeymoon, after marrying Essylt-Priscilla Scott-Ellis on September 27th. And on December 1st of the same year the Gabor family emigrated to America. But in any case, his real vanity issues and memory problems arrive with the famous Gabor sister, Zsa-Zsa. This paragraph:\n\n«Zsa-Zsa, the exuberant Zsa-Zsa, she had become so friendly towards me that Magda forbade me from sitting beside her at the Thursday goulash sessions. Eva limited herself to praising my taste in ties. […] As for Bijou, she treated me like Jewish mothers treat their exceptionally gifted children. She overfed me. In time, the Gabors ended up seeing me as Magda’s steady beau, and at a certain stage I wasn’t sure whether I was cheating on my wife with Magda or on Magda with my wife».\n\nSometimes people are taken out of tales as they overshadow them. Sometimes they are added to brighten them up. Zsa-Zsa had emigrated to America in 1941. In 1945 when the mother and her sisters travelled to America from Lisbon she was at the port to welcome them.\n\n22\n\nI tried to research among Bedoya’s family, in case they still had any memories or papers. I\n\nlocated his daughter, Ana María, by phone one morning a couple of years ago, in Marbella. It was sunny, spring had arrived and her voice sounded chirpy and rushed. She had just opened a bar, she said brightly and then promised she would call me, seriously. I went to visit Mercedes Redondo, daughter of Onésimo and his widow, in Madrid. Mercedes was a charming lady, widow and orphan. Her father had been killed in the war on July 24th, 1936 and her stepfather, Bedoya, occupied a respected but minor place in her life. Shortly after taking a seat in the living-room of her apartment in Puerta de Hierro, she asked me.\n\n—Have you read El Estado Nacional?— an essay written by her father.\n\n—No.\n\n—It’s quite interesting— she said unaffectedly, elegantly. Mercedes held the noble title of Countess of Labajos, which Franco, using his remarkable King’s prerogatives, had bestowed on her father posthumously. The countess appeared melancholic. Though habitual among the worst of humanity, it must nonetheless have been delicate to live with the place, hitched to her name, where they killed her father, Labajos, a village in Segovia, and that mid-day death when Onésimo fatally mistook the red and black of a Cenetista13 patrol for that of his Falange. The Countess was unfamiliar with this version of his death, as she wrote to me months later:\n\n«This is the first time I’ve heard this version of anarchist-falangist clashes. And who mistook whom? The truth be told, I’ve never had more than the limited family information and the versions gleaned from books. Let me explain the family information to you. I have no recollection whatsoever of my father. I had just turned three when he died. My mother, an only daughter and orphan since the age of 14, was 25 when widowed. She remarried in November of 1939. From a very young age, I realised that to mention my father appeared like a rejection of her second marriage. My uncle, Andrés Redondo and also Eduardo Martín Calero, who were in the car with my father, were saved in Labajos. They never once spoke of this event to either me or my sister. I can assure you that my father never carried arms (I believe he was a disastrous conscript during his military service). It suits a true Castilian to die in a road ambush. “The gentleman was killed by night…”14. They have already removed the monument on the hill. The figures were terribly ugly, by a dreadful sculptor. The only lovely part of that place is the view».\n\nOne of the most solid general principles of this book is the fact that children know nothing of their parents.\n\nAnd even less about their half parents! The countess was completely unaware of Bedoya’s participation in the salvation of the European Jews. I would go so far as to venture that the Jews, per se and their destruction, were of very little interest to her. The countess had that visibly refined air one gets from travel. For a large period of her life, she was married to the diplomat, Temboury. And of the five years spent in Paris, she retained a cyclostyled booklet, written with «admiration, but also the necessary irony such a perfect place deserves».\n\nThere was nothing of Bedoya’s in the house, and I needed to get away and escape the pull of tobacco. Or, in other words: the draw of those characters that initially appear on the fringes of books and then threaten to devour them.\n\n—Come for lunch someday.\n\nA few months later, she reminded me of her invitation. And added:\n\n—I’ve read a curious book. It’s called El frac a veces aprieta. The author is Argamonte, the diplomat. Slightly before the Second World War he was in Berlin, and throughout it he was the Spanish ambassador in Denmark. Well, he never mentions a word about Jews.\n\nThe countess’s gentle denial. Ambassador Agramonte’s attitude was not unusual. Among the countries invaded by the Germans, Denmark was the only one in which the authority, the King, protected the Jews and more categorically and successfully opposed the Nazi deportation plans.\n\nHence, for the moment, and given the lack of any family papers, Bedoya’s memoirs would have to sustain themselves, opposing the facts whenever possible. His chronicle supports the existence of a more or less improvised plan drawn up by the Franco government with a view to help save the European Jews, that was developed alongside the events that took place in the last year and a half of the Second World War, when the Nazi defeat was more than a premonition. But, like I’ve said, Bedoya’s contribution is uncertain in some details. One such detail refers to the protection offered by Spain to the Jews in Budapest, the core theme of this book.\n\nDresden and Prague were stuffing me with their Baroque and their river and their empire. I can’t wait to get to Budapest, where it all came to a head in the end.\n\n.\n\nThe Nazis kept the existence of Auschwitz and the death camps secret until 1944.\n\nFrom that year on, the elite civil servant, political and journalist classes of the Allied countries began to find the first evidence that various concentration camps were, in reality, mass death factories. Nonetheless, Spanish diplomacy could always claim that it had reported the crime at an earlier date, around the summer of 1943, in a paragraph of a report from its minister of the Berlin ambassador, Ginés Vidal, alluding to the mortal activity of the Treblinka camp:\n\n«The massive liquidation of Jews, not just those still alive of the three and a half million who were living in Poland, but those brought in from Austria, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Norway, France and Yugoslavia; a place unknown to date called Tremblinka [sic] has gained itself the bleak reputation of having been chosen for these terrible killings ».\n\nOne year later, regarding Auschwitz, the young Sanz Briz informed his government in more detail of rumours that until that moment had seemed inconceivable. His first news was dated mid-July and was part of a report on the chaotic situation in Hungary following the Nazi invasion.\n\n«They assure me that the number of Israelis deported is as high as 500,000. The rumours about their destiny are more alarming. One of the more persistent would have us believe that the majority of the expeditions of Jews (that take place in cattle cars [sic] packing 80 people into each of these in a veritable herding) travel to a concentration camp located on the outskirts of Kattowitz [35 kilometres from Auschwitz], where they are gassed to death and their bodies used as the fatty matter of certain industries. Without confirming the truth of such a barbarity, I refer the rumour to Your Excellency due to how insistently it has spread throughout this capital ».\n\nThus, in all likelihood, Sanz Briz was the first Spanish diplomat to inform the Francoist government of the Auschwitz killings. And he did so again the following month, in greater detail, in the so-called Auschwitz Protocol, supposedly written by two prisoners who managed to escape in 1944, that was being passed around various European capitals. In his letter to introduce this protocol to his minister, he wrote:\n\n«Please find attached a report on the treatment Jews are condemned to in the German concentration camps. This report has been delivered to me by members of the Board of the Zionist organization of this capital. Its origin, therefore, make it suspect of passion».\n\nFurthermore, in those inconceivable days, the truth was independent of whomsoever spoke it. Although the Auschwitz report had been written by two victims, it was largely true. And it had formed the documentary basis of the exiled Polish minister’s condemnation, published in the Los Angeles Times a few months beforehand, in which the name Auschwitz was first linked to mass killings. Although it was not the first time a newspaper had talked about the gas chambers and industrial extermination. That honour, to the best of my knowledge, lies with a Montreal-based broadsheet that published the following headline in the summer of 1942:\n\nNazis Massacre 700,000 Polish Jews;\n\nThousands Executed in Mobile Gas Chambers\n\nThe minister who received the Auschwitz report was not count Jordana. Jordana had died\n\nsuddenly three weeks earlier, in San Sebastián. Regarding the cause of his death, the press came up with a remarkable eulogy: the minister, who was 68 years old, had apparently been killed by work. An overwhelming, inhumane job. So wrote the anonymous writer of the Mencheta agency:\n\n«The death of the Lieutenant General, Count Jordana was undoubtedly caused by an excess of work accumulated over the past years. It could be said that the Spanish Foreign Minister lived in a state of constant vigilance in recent times, never resting, firm in his arduous task, toiling night and day».\n\nIndeed, the obituaries insisted so much on this point that even those with no information on how the drama had unfolded became suspicious. The truth is that the most immediate cause of death was probably one described by the minister in the diary he kept right up to his last days. This was the entry for Sunday, July 23rd:\n\n«At six am we went hunting on the Viuda de Arroyo estate, in Navalquejigo. Very agreeable and quite good hunting but almost at the end they put me in a beating on top of a rock with limited base to throw from and on shooting at a rabbit I lost my balance and shot out of there like a rocket, hitting another rock and opening up a great gash on my forehead, with a lot of bleeding and fuss, giving the boys an enormous fright; and giving myself one too as I bled a great deal ».\n\nHis own son, Luis, publisher of his diaries, would add at the bottom of this entry, in brackets: «According to subsequent deductions, this accident was the cause of his sudden death a few days later».\n\nJordana’s last days were spent between the dressings of his hunting injury and suffocating heat. His notes on the Madrid heat of the last days of July (on the eve of his death there were 52 degrees in Mora de Toledo) were constant and distressed. The minister was extremely tired. On Saturday the 29th he went home for lunch feeling very unwell with pains in his arms, «as if it were neuritis». And in the afternoon, he still had a cabinet meeting. Two days later he wrote his final diary entry: the journey to San Sebastián, where he would pass away. The newspapers made no mention of the hunting accident (it must not have seemed compatible with the tireless dedication to work), or the urgent mandate a son of Jordana’s received from his mother shortly after his death:\n\n«At the time of my father’s death, my sister Pilar and I were in San Sebastián. My mother, in a reaction difficult to understand given the time she was going through, told me to run to my father’s office and gather up his diaries and the copy of a letter, of the utmost importance, that he had written just a few months beforehand to General Franco. I recovered the handwritten diaries; but the lock on the drawer the letter was in had been forced and the letter taken».\n\nThe son did not offer any conclusive explanations of the truly strange event. He was more explicit about the contents of the letter. A year before, the father had written in his diary that he had given Franco a text on the Spanish political situation. The son deduced that a copy must have been held in the forced drawer. This was not a reassuring deduction, and even less so in the context of the minister’s sudden death. But there was nothing else. Years later, the memoirs of Martínez de Bedoya would sustain the son’s suspicions about the contents of the stolen letter. In the second conversation between Bedoya and Jordana, in November 1943, on the Jewish protection plan, the minister had confided the three axes of his foreign policy to him:\n\n«The Generalissimo has authorised me to carry through my purpose. In short, it is a question of elaborating a foreign policy based on three cards, the only ones we have in the hypothesis (the only one I allow possible) of an Allied victory: the first consists of putting forward as a permanent argument, in the most varied of circumstances, the demands of the “balance of power” against Soviet Russia; the second consists of establishing our love of a State of Law towards which we are moving if we are not harassed (amnesty, Courts, law on individual rights, union and representative elections, treatment of war refugees, etc.); the third derives from achieving the international solidarity of the Catholics and Jews of the world».\n\nBedoya wrote years after this conversation. He did not clarify whether he used notes or reports from the period to put these words in Jordana’s mouth. There was no further allusion in his memoir to the theoretical democratising plans nor the written transcription of the same. As for everything else, time would add a dramatic postscript to the minister’s notes. The allied victory brought neither amnesty nor courts nor rights. The executions by shooting and the political persecution of the Franco dictatorship continued to the very end. Indeed: the letter to Franco had certainly been stolen.\n\nAll journeys have absurd moments. The traveller starts singing a childish song at the top of his lungs along\n\nthe motorway. And cannot stop. There is secret laughter at the locals for any old silliness. He manages to pass the same corner of a random city a hundred times, without meaning to. It’s caused by exhaustion, the oddness of things, a certain unabashed joy, the easy summer days. A classic absurd moment is laughter. A sudden, irrepressible, pitiless fit of giggles. I can’t forget that morning that Boix and I walked into the office of an Egyptian member of the International Olympic Committee to interview him. We were writing our own Samaranch. We shook hands and sat down. As the conversation was to be in English, only Jaume would ask the questions. He opened his mouth but I don’t recall him uttering a single word. Laughter spewed forth like vomit. The man waited a few minutes and then pointed to the exit without getting up. It is understandable that after a lifetime asking questions I often remember, in dangerously formal moments, this embarrassing scene. But today is not one of those moments. I am in Rynek Glówny, the grand plaza of Krakow, and nobody is going to put me to shame for my laughter. The usual laughter I get from anything Baroque, worsened by the specific view of the Church of Santa María, that looks like what in Madrid we call a fungus: a protuberance the square could easily have suffered. And it’s not the only one. I go over to the other side, as far as San Woyceh, San Adalberto, they say: as if the fungus laughter hadn’t been enough. And beyond it, the tower of the old city council, another. The square is vast. To create it, they must have knocked down houses, palaces, closed off streets and sliced chunks off these enormous churches that turn both their faces and their backsides to the visitor, cleanly, without the stone ambushes and intricate web of streets usually to be found in places like this. I am doubled over by the time I proclaim it’s neither fungi nor cut-outs, Rynek Glówny is in fact the only square in the world to be created via panspermia. I’m going to get out of here, I’m not quite sure how. At the tourist office I’ve seen spectacular, general offers entitled Communism Tours and at the end of the summer of 1944, the Soviet bombings announced the imminence of the liberation, as such, of Budapest. This crossroads is promising, but a lovely sunlight shines over Rynek Glówny, so I’ll sit and savour it before proceeding to the summary execution.\n\nMinister Jordana was replaced by José Félix de Lequerica. The first thing the new minister said\n\nwas that Spain had just one foreign policy and it was the work of Franco. He had his reasons for saying so. His nomination had been interpreted as an unusual and mistaken reinforcement of the Francoist, Germanophile opinion. However, Bedoya was well aware of the rapid and intelligent adaptation capacity of that «boisterous Germanophile». His description of Lequerica coincides, in spirit at least, with the three lines José Luis de Vilallonga wrote in the volume of his memoirs that evokes the Lisbon of Bedoya and the end of the European war: «José Félix de Lequerica, the clever and slippery future minister of Franco, [was] the prototypical cynic too busy with himself to have time to hurt anyone else». Lequerica probably didn’t have an active capacity for evil. It’s true that in his period as ambassador in Paris he observed the Jewish tragedy with enormous passiveness and without ever losing his calm.\n\nApart from his ideological view on international matters, he exuded rigidity, that could perhaps be attributed to the insecurity of the new person, in the first meeting between Lequerica and the young diplomat facing the desperate situation of the Jews and the Soviet bombing in Budapest. When his minister had been in the post for just two weeks, Sanz Briz requested his authorisation to attend an important meeting. The Apostolic Nuncio, Angelo Rotta, had called on all neutral countries with diplomatic representation to present a joint note of protest to the government against the deportations of the Jews.\n\n«… we feel obliged to vehemently protest such procedures, so unjust in their foundations\n\n—because it is absolutely inadmissible that men should be persecuted and condemned to death for the simple fact of their racial origin— and so brutal in their execution».\n\nWhen the time came for the meeting, the minister’s authorisation had not yet arrived, but Sanz Briz decided to attend. Not just attend, but to sign the protest:\n\n«All attendants approved its content and proclaimed their willingness to sign it and, in light of this, the undersigned considered it wise to adopt the same attitude in spite of not having received instructions from Your Excellency.».\n\nThe minister’s reply was not exactly encouraging:\n\n«Delay in receipt of telegram 82 if still in time should you attend meetings on behalf of Spain consider it advisable to agree on actions in friendly tone and polite indication avoiding protestation which if necessary may only be conducted through the Spanish Ambassador in Berlin».\n\nIn friendly tone and polite indication. This was, indeed, the voice of the still Germanophile Lequerica. Caused by absent-mindedness, undoubtedly. This type of man would persist for a few weeks, sending the odd telegram, like this one from early September:\n\n«Authorised entrance [to Spain presumably] of Hungarians, Elena Bak, Presca Szego and Susana Steintiz, conditional to their holding regular documentation and not being people of Jewish condition».\n\nThe «Jewish condition» was pure Vichy-speak. Nonetheless, the Germanophile quickly transformed into the cynic. In his memoirs, Bedoya recounted some clues as to the specific circumstances of this transformation. Shortly after Jordana’s death, he had received a call from Franco Salgado-Araujo, the legendary secretary of the General.\n\n«—Bedoya, listen to me Bedoya, I’ve been given your Estoril telephone number by the chancellor of the Embassy. This is Franco Salgado, military secretary to his Excellence, the Head of State. It’s a question of procedure. Kindly take good note: hereinafter, everything you formerly sent directly to Jordana, you now ensure it reaches El Pardo ».\n\nBedoya recounts that it didn’t take long for him to start using this privileged channel. At the beginning of September, he communicated to Franco the desperate request of his Jewish interlocutors in Lisbon for refuge in the Spanish legation of around twenty prominent members of the Israeli community in Budapest:\n\n«Lequerica who was acting in the traditional capacity of minister to the King in San Sebastián, came to Madrid on September 12th, returning to San Sebastián just a few hours later. It was during this brief stay at the palace of Santa Cruz that he called Mr. Nicolás Franco [the Spanish Ambassador in Lisbon] by telephone to say to him: “Tell the Jews that their issue in Budapest is all resolved”».\n\nLequerica had changed his mind about the people «of Jewish condition» whose entrance to Spain he had vetoed ten days earlier. In mid-September, via a verbal note, he communicated his best intentions regarding the Hungarian Jews to the North American embassy, which had expressed an interest in them weeks before.\n\nNo visible and definitive trace of the actions of either Bedoya or Lequerica are to be found in the archives. But the possibility that the group alluded to by Bedoya was the same as the group referred to by the minister in his verbal note cannot be discarded. The important thing is that while time has passed, the note has never ceased to ooze the drooling eagerness of the writer to fulfil the wishes of his new master.\n\n«… has the honour to communicate to you that the corresponding orders to the minister of Spain in that country have been dispatched so that it may proceed to approve travel visas for all those passports of Jewish subjects presented for this purpose. Furthermore, instructions have been issued to take an active interest in proceeding close to the Hungarian government and occupying German authorities, [and] to facilitate the exit from Hungary of the aforementioned subjects. Thus, this Ministry believes that the Government of Spain through this measure will do everything in its power to reach a positive outcome of the aforementioned problem and it has demonstrated its will to invest maximum interest and effort. ».\n\nIn September of 1944, the Soviet bombs reached the Spanish legation. Sanz Briz sent descriptions of the increasingly worrisome news to his minister as they occurred:\n\n«They day before yesterday, Budapest suffered a very violent aerial bombardment. Huge number of victims and destruction. Numerous bombs exploded in the vicinity of this representation which only suffered broken windows. Other cities in Hungary have also been bombed. I beg for urgent instructions on whether to deliver funds to Swedish representative from this representation should it prove necessary to evacuate Hungary due to the Russian advance. In this event, I request authorization to burn files and passwords».\n\nIn his fifth-columnist activity during the Spanish war the young diplomat had shown courage and cool-headedness. Now he was under the bombs again. And his vulnerability mirrored that of the government of Spain. Along with Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Portugal and the Vatican, Spain was one of the formally neutral countries still present in Budapest. Nonetheless, in the eyes of the Bolsheviks who were already at the city walls, Spain was a belligerent country. None of the other countries, not even Portugal of the Salazar dictatorship, shared this condition. France made the Civil War a crusade against communism in which Sanz Briz had participated passionately.\n\nHe had been forewarning his ministry that the fall of Budapest was far more than a mere hypothesis for a long time. In a telegram dated the end of August, he had alluded to the Swedish offer to protect Spanish interests when the Soviet army entered Budapest. The telegram ended with these unequivocal words: «I believe the time has come to obtain said protection». He was not only requesting protection for himself. He was also awaiting permission from his minister to shelter two loyal and veteran employees in the legation: Elisabeth Tourné and the lawyer, Zoltán Farkas. Minister Lequerica granted his authorisation in the first instance, but one day later conditioned his response and furthermore, regarding the bombs, advised him to take them in his stride:\n\n«It is unadvisable to give an impression of excessive precipitation and lack [of] serenity by attempting [to] withdraw as long as you have free communication with Austria [and] until the events you foresee occur. If the front should break and Russia advance to the outskirts of Budapest, you may hand Legation over to Swedish representative authorizing Madame Tourné to reside in it, but not the legal adviser who in no way forms part of the Legation staff and his nationality does not give him the right to protection. You could, however, provide him with a special recommendation to the Swedish representative when he takes charge of Spanish interests. As has already been communicated, you may leave Budapest and start destroying part of the files of no value transferring the rest to Vienna».\n\nYears after his death, when his odyssey in Budapest was revealed in the papers, films and books, the memory of Sanz Briz suffered due to his departure from Budapest. «There was no order», repeated Perlasca’s daughter-in-law one night in her house in Padova. «That paper does not exist», she stated. Obviously, the intention was to present the Spanish diplomat’s departure as if it were an escape, driven by irresponsibility, self-interest and fear. But the papers did exist (more than one) and proved that Sanz Briz made his decisions with the complicity and agreement of his government, the opposite would have been highly unlikely. This note from Lequerica, still so distant and circumspect, was the first of the papers and it established an unequivocal and authorised cause/effect relationship between the Soviet conquest of Budapest and the legation’s departure. Spain was a formally neutral country, but Franco’s government feared that the Soviet troops would not exactly consider it thus. There is no other possible interpretation of the indication to destroy the files: the first order anyone fearing to see their house in enemy hands would give.\n\nTanks. The tanks are always Soviet. There is one vigorous but isolated exception with Rommel in\n\nthe conquest of Tobruk. When I walked into the tourist office in Krakow to ask about the conditions and characteristics of the Communism Tour they didn’t offer me the tank experience. This is what they offered me:\n\n1. Our classics: communism tour, communism de luxe, communist welcome, communism tour & disco, communist offer for groups.\n\n2. Others: Kalashnikov shots.\n\nGiven my social democrat bent, I became immediately interested in communism deluxe. To put it briefly, they put you and a guide in a Trabant (a tough and rock-solid Soviet equivalent of a Seat 600), and drive you around the Nowa Huta district, paying logical Polish attention to the chimneys. There are soft drinks and the guides tell you old stories about communism. If you pay extra, you can visit «a communist apartment» where they serve you the famous cooperative gherkins and a shot of vodka. Then they let you drive the Trabant. For the more sentimental spirits, the experience of seeing communism reduced to a medieval dinner is somewhat hard to stomach. In the end, it’s your youth inside that coat of armour, with its lance and its shield. While I’m debating whether to get into the Trabant or not, I am reminded of the Polish girls I met in that communist camp in Caprarola over 30 years ago. A place found for me for the summer by my professor, Faustino Miguélez, a Party socialist who was an expert in the worker’s struggle in Seat, as sober and dry as commitment. The Polish girls were suspicious, not just as Catholics. Sometimes, while debating the justice and beauty of communism in the group, one of them made a very slight and rapid grimace, that rendered them even more dated and ugly. A number of us had already unhappily noticed that expression. Certainly, of the entire group, made up of Italians, Western Germans, Spaniards, Japanese and even an adoptive Bolivian, they were the only communists; but I don’t know what right they thought they had.\n\nI didn’t get into the Trabant.\n\nThe lawyer Zoltán Farkas and the secretary Elisabeth Tourné. Sanz Briz wished to house them\n\nin the Embassy but the minister gave permission for the woman only. He emphasised Farkas’ (Hungarian) nationality and the fact that he in «no way» formed part of the legation staff. The «no way» was hurtful as the truth is that Farkas had been its legal adviser for almost twenty years. A letter dated the summer of 1940 from the Spanish representative in Budapest at the time, Miguel Ángel de Muguiro, to Juan Luis Beigbeder, Minister of Foreign Affairs, gave a detailed account of the solid link between Farkas and the national interests:\n\n«Days before my arrival in the capital, my predecessor, Mr. Carlos Arcos and Cuadra, proposed, through dispatch n.º 64, of May 4th, 1938, that the government of the Spanish State should nominate doctor Zoltán Farkas, honorary legal adviser of this Legation, replacing the previous nomination made by the government of the Republic.\n\nHaving failed to receive any reply to this dispatch, undoubtedly, expecting said proposal put forward by my predecessor to be confirmed by me as I took charge of this Legation, nor having personally received any indication to do so, I take the liberty, in light of the time passed, to respectfully request a new nomination of Mr. Farkas, as honorary legal consultant of this Legation, given that the services he provides are extremely necessary, that he is sufficiently qualified in the legal matters brought to his attention for study, for his perfect linguistic knowledge (Hungarian, Spanish, French and German), for his complete capacity, gentlemanliness and honour and for his absolute adhesion to the national regime.\n\nI trust my proposal shall be taken into consideration, not only for the reasons detailed above, but because this gentleman has exercised said position since shortly after the creation of this diplomatic representation.\n\nThe nomination arrived one month after this letter, and although it specified the merely honorary nature of his work, it would have sufficed four years later to justify refuge in the legation, not only for his «Jewish condition». There was an additional fear. Farkas had already lived through the eccentric, bloodthirsty and ephemeral Bolshevik dictatorship of Béla Kun and he probably saw the imminent arrival of Soviet tanks in Budapest as a resumption of this and sought refuge from the diplomatic statute that, though fragile and relative, the Spanish representation could certainly have given him.\n\nElisabeth Tourné was the other person for whom Sanz Briz requested an exception from his\n\nminister. In this case, he was granted permission to give her refuge in the Spanish legation. She had been born in 1899, was Hungarian by birth and French by marriage, and since 1917 had been working as secretary (to the chancellor, in consular jargon) with the successive Spanish diplomats. The reasons for which Tourné sought refuge are laid out in a sensational paper in the archives of the Spanish Foreign Ministry, written from Valladolid, a Francoist zone, right in the midst of the Spanish Civil War:\n\n«CONFIDENTIAL NOTE\n\nThe secretary of National Spanish representation in Budapest is Jewish. This is the reason she facilitates the necessary passport visas to enter the free zone for all Hungarian Jews and those of other nationalities who apply for them from our representation in Budapest. The Generalissimo’s representative in Hungary is unaware of this detail and signs without rea"
