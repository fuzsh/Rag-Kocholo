Admired for her long, Alice-in-Wonderland hair, Farrow shocked Hollywood one day by cutting it all off, an independent act which, odd as it may seem now, made headlines across the country, and characterized Farrow as not just another pretty face content to follow the instructions of her male Hollywood bosses.\n\nThat Farrow's boyish charm was a significant part of her attractiveness is clear; her slightly enigmatic grin, those fetching and luminous eyes, the short hair that sets off her features, and the thin body, recalling Audrey Hepburn. \"Victim\" roles followed: in a television adaptation of Johnny Belinda, in which she played a deaf mute who is raped; and in Rosemary's Baby, in which she plays a contemporary New York City woman who is raped by the devil and subsequently gives birth to Satan's son. Directed by Roman Polanski, Rosemary's Baby was an incredible box-office and critical success. Farrow's slight physical presence and vulnerability made her a believable victim. It seems ironic that at a time of emerging women's liberation, an actress should appear whose persona was that of a woman apparently so in need of being taken care of.\n\nDespite the popularity of Rosemary's Baby, Farrow has never been especially admired by the critics or popular at the box office; that she failed to win an Academy Award nomination for this or any other film seems to reflect her lack of general appeal. John and Mary, Farrow's first film after Rosemary's Baby, was widely ridiculed, although today, while still rarely screened, it seems to be among the earliest American films of the 1960s to deal with sexual relationships in a relatively honest way. Another underrated performance was as Daisy in The Great Gatsby, a multimillion dollar film which cast her opposite Robert Redford. Here director Jack Clayton revealed Farrow's innocence and beauty as a corrupt facade in a film that looks increasingly praiseworthy, as does her performance in it. Other Farrow roles seem either to perpetuate the waif/victim persona (such as See No Evil, in which she plays a blind woman who is terrorized by a killer, or in her theatrical and television performances as Peter Pan), or to manipulate and subvert the waif/victim persona by countering audience expectations (as in the Agatha Christie adaptation Death on the Nile, Robert Altman's A Wedding, or Claude Chabrol's Docteur Popaul). Yet if Farrow's persona is often vulnerable, her offscreen image has about it a considerable element of independence: one thinks of her interest in social issues, her adoption of Vietnamese children, her visits to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the 1960s, and her highly publicized relationships with a variety of famous and talented men such as Frank Sinatra, André Previn, and Woody Allen.\n\nCertainly the period of Farrow's career with the highest profile comprises her numerous performances for director Woody Allen. While generally thought of as an instinctual, if mannered, actress, Farrow reveals herself in Allen's films to be an actress of substantial technical skill; and before its termination, their collaboration acquired the stature of a Chabrol and Audran, a Fellini and Masina, a Bergman and Ullmann. Farrow played a liberated freethinker in A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy, a psychiatrist in the pseudodocumentary Zelig, and—most surprisingly—a vulgar Italian woman in Broadway Danny Rose, a key Allen film in which Farrow played il bruto to Allen's Gelsomina in a contemporary comedy evoking Fellini's La Strada. Her excellent work for Woody Allen has been judged surprising particularly by those critics who had already tended to underrate or dismiss her. Her totally luminous and sensitive performance as the forlorn movie fan in the 1985 The Purple Rose of Cairo seems already to be a key performance in the American cinema: the performance and film both extraordinary achievements largely ignored at their release, pushed aside by the Spielberg-inspired, special-effects spectaculars of the Reagan era. As the daughter in September (based loosely on Lana Turner's relationship with her daughter in the aftermath of the Johnny Stompanato murder), Farrow shows the ability to eradicate her own charismatic personality within an intimate chamber drama in a way that recalls and rivals Liv Ullmann in Autumn Sonata, with which the film bears comparison: Farrow's sniffling, whiny protagonist is both terrifyingly vulnerable and pitiable, as well as the temperamental opposite to Farrow's spunky cigarette girl who becomes a star in Radio Days, in which Farrow offers a deft, comic turn.\n\nPerhaps unfortunately, one cannot comprehensively discuss Farrow in the mid-1990s without some consideration of the extraordinary scandal that gripped tabloid America for over a year. The Allen-Farrow breakup, which included dismissed charges against Allen of child sexual abuse and revelations of an acknowledged affair between Allen and Farrow's then-teenaged adopted daughter, Soon-Yi, put the Farrow-Allen collaboration under a microscope. A reevaluation of Allen's use of Farrow reveals, perhaps surprisingly to some, that Farrow's persona in Allen's films (with the exception, perhaps, of Alice, which emphasizes the Roman Catholic, giving component of Farrow's identity) was by no means a heroic or valorized one. In Hannah and Her Sisters, one of Allen's most sustained works, shot largely in Farrow's Manhattan apartment, Farrow played a role patterned upon her own life, allowing the spectator a kind of voyeuristic entrance into Farrow's life with Allen. And yet, if barely commented upon at the time of the film's release, Farrow's Hannah—only apparently the stable, expressive center in Allen's world—is relatively smug, and it is clear that the filmmaker expends much more narrative time and interest on her sisters, as Allen's surrogate (Hannah's husband, played by Michael Caine) falls in love with a sister-inlaw—an incestual precursor to Allen's later disenchantment. In Crimes and Misdemeanors (arguably Woody Allen's finest work), Farrow plays an archetype for our time: the amoral smiler—smart, attractive, talented, and sensitive, yet ultimately ambitious and pragmatic in ways which are all too recognizable. In retrospect it is clearer that in The Purple Rose of Cairo, September, and Another Woman (in which a very pregnant Farrow spends most of the film in therapy nd tears), there is a profound element of masochism implicit in Farrow's suffering, and sadism on the part of the director and/or the narrative.\n\nHusbands and Wives, the Allen masterwork representing the last of their collaboration, in production while the scandal was unfolding, has Farrow and Allen playing a married couple whose marriage traumatically unravels, with Farrow presented as a woman who subtly uses her charm and passivity to manipulate those around her. In this film of vertiginous style and emotion, Farrow's heartrending performance, for many, was so persuasive that the film was greeted (though to disappointing box office) as psychodrama in the Cassavetes style, too painful to watch. Even in the \"Oedipus Wrecks\" segment of New York Stories, the character played by Woody Allen ultimately rejects as his perfect match the fantasy of Mia Farrow in favor of the reality of Julie Kavner. Is any more evidence necessary that Allen has been no Sternberg elevating his Dietrich? As a last curious footnote to the scandal, one notes that even in non-Allen films, major roles in Rosemary's Baby, Death on the Nile, Docteur Popaul, and The Great Gatsby (among others) put Farrow in a sexual triangle that ends in tragic sensation.\n\nSince the breakup with Allen, Farrow has managed to acquit herself professionally in some interesting, idiosyncratic work. Returning to Ireland and her roots in Widows' Peak, a gentle and surprising comedy, Farrow again played a victim more apparent than real and turned in a luminous, subtle performance, complete with Irish accent. Especially interesting is Miami Rhapsody, a comedy directed by David Frankel explicitly in the style of Woody Allen, in which Farrow plays a woman whose daughter is given the opportunity to sleep with her mother's lover, but refuses out of moral principle—a sly, cinematic rebuke to Allen, if ever there was one. Unfortunately, too much of Farrow's subsequent work has been less satisfactorily distributed or conceived. Reckless, a black comedy made in 1995, was too weird for mainstream audiences. Angela Mooney Dies Again, another film made in Ireland, allows Farrow the opportunity to give an intense performance in a flawed film as a woman who repeatedly threatens suicide. Coming Soon, which went straight to video as a result of the MPAA initially giving the film an NC-17 rating, boasted Farrow, Ryan O'Neal, and Spalding Gray in supporting roles in a feminist comedy centered on women's orgasm. More successful for Farrow, certainly, were two movies made directly for TV. In Miracle at Midnight, a TV movie produced for The Wonderful World of Disney, Farrow plays a heroine from real life: Doris Koster, who together with her husband saved thousands of Jews in Nazi-occupied Denmark during World War II. Forget Me Never, broadcast in 1999, was even more successful—garnering Farrow a Golden Globe nomination for her poignant performance as a married fortysomething attorney who is diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Despite these reent successes, one suspects that Mia Farrow's continuing performance work will continue to be too fine, subtle, and marginal for significant contemporary acclaim. And unlike other of her acting contemporaries (like Streisand or Nicholson), Mia Farrow—even in the midst of her biggest successes with Rosemary's Baby and Hannah and Her Sisters—never particularly worked at capitalizing her potential as a movie star or as a Hollywood power player.\n\nIronically, Farrow's most overwhelming public success has come not through her acting, but through her writing. Her extraordinary memoir, What Falls Away, which was published in 1997, joins that very rare company of actress memoirs (including Liv Ullmann's Changing and Hildegard Kneff's The Gift Horse) that rise to a literary quality. Dealing courageously with her own childhood polio, her complicated relationships, her unusual inter-racial family of fourteen children (many adopted, with multiple handicaps), and of course, the scandal involving Woody Allen, What Falls Away became a national best-seller as well as an elegant and poetic self-portrait of one of our most sensitive and unique film artists.\n\n—Charles Derry\n\nFARROW, Mia\n\n(b. 9 February 1945 in Los Angeles, California), actress who found fame in the television soap opera Peyton Place and whose big screen breakthrough came in the stylish horror movie Rosemary's Baby (1968).\n\nBorn Maria de Lourdes Villiers Farrow, Mia Farrow is the daughter of film director John Farrow and actress Maureen O'Sullivan, who starred as Jane in the popular Tarzan movie series of the 1930s. The third of seven children, Farrow attended convent schools in Madrid, Spain, as well as Marymount School in Los Angeles. At the age of nine she fought a battle with polio and in her teens took bit parts in several of her father's movies. Farrow's schooling finished at the Cygnet School, London, in 1962. From an early age, she craved fame, saying in a 1965 interview with Kitty Kelly, \"I just couldn't stand being anonymous.\"\n\nAged just eighteen, Farrow made her off-Broadway debut as Cecily in The Importance of Being Earnest in 1963, and in 1964 she began her screen career as Allison Mackenzie on the hit television show Peyton Place. Farrow was known for roller-skating around the set and soon acquired a reputation for wild behavior. Despite the apparent intensity of her real-life ambition, Farrow's blonde hair, wide-eyed look, and gentle smile have led to numerous roles as sensitive, intelligent, but slightly misunderstood women. Peyton Place produced the first public outings for an acting persona Farrow would cultivate and refine over the next thirty years.\n\nAlthough Farrow's role in Peyton Place was a supporting one, the show's success guaranteed national fame. Starting in 1964 with twice-weekly installments, the show, by the end of the first season, was airing three times a week. Between 1964 and 1966, Allison Mackenzie became one of the show's most popular characters and won Farrow the 1965 Golden Globe for most promising newcomer. Farrow left Peyton Place just as the show's ratings were about to decline. She married fifty-one-year-old Frank Sinatra on 19 July 1966.\n\nAged just twenty-one and married to one of the greatest popular singers of all time, Farrow quickly became a household name, her photograph appearing in newspapers and magazines around the world. Her waiflike figure, short hair, and vulnerable appearance were much admired. She appeared on the cover of Vogue in 1967, helping to feed the 1960s fashion industry's obsession with thin, boyish women. This new look was a radical departure from the voluptuous figures of the previous generation of actresses, such as Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell.\n\nAlthough she was happy to be in the public eye, Farrow also wanted to work. After her marriage, her acting career stalled, and it was against Sinatra's wishes that she took the leading role in Roman Polanski's cult horror movie, Rosemary's Baby (1968). Farrow plays Rosemary Woodhouse, a young woman from the country who moves to New York with her new husband. The couple settle in an old apartment building called the Bramford, which is home to a strange group of neighbors. Rosemary becomes increasingly afraid of an occult presence in the building and is convinced that she has been raped and impregnated by Satan. Rosemary's Baby was perhaps the most influential horror movie of the decade, inspiring a whole subgenre of movies about possessed children, including The Exorcist (1973), and The Omen (1976). Unlike the Ira Levin novel on which it is based, Polanski's movie leaves it unclear whether or not Rosemary has been raped by Satan. The film is more about alienation, loneliness, superstition, and mental collapse than it is about supernatural evil. By the time of the film's release, Farrow was so well known that in an attempt to boost ratings, the writers of Peyton Place introduced a baby to coincide with the movie's opening weekend. The baby was introduced as the child of Allison Mackenzie, Farrow's character in the show.\n\nA career high, Rosemary's Baby earned Farrow a nomination as best actress at the 1969 Golden Globes and won her a David at the 1969 David di Donatello Awards in Italy. However, although the finished movie was a success, the process of filming had been painful. Farrow's decision to continue working brought her marriage to Sinatra to an end, and he served her with divorce papers on the set. When filming was over in January 1968, Farrow went to India to recuperate. As if to confirm her place at the heart of 1960s popular culture, she spent her time in India with the Beatles at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Farrow and Sinatra divorced on 16 August 1968.\n\nAfter Rosemary's Baby, Farrow was much in demand in Hollywood. She was nominated for a second Golden Globe in 1970 for her role alongside Dustin Hoffman in the sex comedy John and Mary (1969), although the film was a commercial failure. The same year, she married the orchestral conductor André Previn, had twin boys, and adopted three other children. After their divorce in 1979, Farrow was linked with director Woody Allen for twelve years, although they never lived together. She had one child with Allen and adopted two more. By 1994, two years after her much-publicized split with Allen, Farrow had fourteen children, ten of whom were adopted.\n\nFarrow was one of the most prominent young stars of the 1960s, with an attitude and \"look\" that have since come to embody the spirit of the decade. However, she failed to achieve the broad popular appeal of contemporaries such as Goldie Hawn and Jessica Lange, possibly because the \"little girl lost\" persona went out of favor as the decade ended. Yet despite this sense that she is stuck with a screen presence she can exploit but not escape, Farrow has in fact built on her achievements in the 1960s to show great technical breadth. This is especially true of her work for Woody Allen, who managed to draw performances from her that surprised many people. In performances between The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985), and Husbands and Wives (1992), Farrow augmented the vulnerable-yet-strong character she made her own in Rosemary's Baby to become one of the most admired actresses of her generation.\n\nFarrow published her much-praised autobiography, What Falls Away: A Memoir, in 1997. Biographies include Sam Rubin and Richard Taylor, Mia Farrow: Flowerchild, Madonna, Muse (1989), and Edward Z. Epstein and Joe Morella, Mia: The Life of Mia Farrow (1991). Further information is available in Kitty Kelly, My Way (1965), Ivan Butler, The Cinema of Roman Polanski (1970), and David Shipman, The Great Movie Stars: The International Years (1972).\n\nChris Routledge"
