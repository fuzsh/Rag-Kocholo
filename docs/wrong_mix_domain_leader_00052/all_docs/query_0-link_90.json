They also discussed various aspects of the Russian-Israeli relations, including trade and economic cooperation.\n\nAt the talks President Putin stated that Russia supported the efforts by Israel, its Arab partners and the United States as a co-sponsor in the Middle East peace process, to settle the situation in the region. He also expressed confidence that the Russian diplomatic efforts would help Israel and all parties to the conflict to resolve the complicated problems they have encountered.\n\nMr Putin particularly noted that many immigrants from the Soviet Union had settled in Israel, and Russia took an interest in their fate.\n\nThe talks were followed by a joint news conference held by Mr Putin and Mr Katsav."
