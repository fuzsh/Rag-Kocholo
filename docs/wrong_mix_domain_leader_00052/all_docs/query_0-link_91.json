        "text": "To: seth edenbaum (4):\n\nOnly two-states solution is possible, if something is possible at all at that place. Jews and Arabs can’t live together in one Arabs’ majority state. Be serious. The better solution is to have two states in that historic land of Israel, while the Jordan River borders them in the middle. Israel will be spread out and stretched from the Jordan River to the sea shore and will be the national land of Israel. Jordan will be the national Arab’s state of those who are called “Palestinians”. One has to remember that the Palestinians are 80% of Palestinian’s Jordan. Most of the Arab refugees will be settled in Jordan than they’ll reach 98% of the population there.\n\nJews and Arabs as persons will dwell at their places as they are sited now. Arabs, those who are living in Israel too, will vote for the Parliament in Amman. Jews will vote for the Knesset in Jerusalem. That act will preserve the identity and souls of both states while keeping the Muslims threat to annihilate Israel away of reach. That will make the area much calm and safer. Both states can join a mutual alliances to keel ties close rather to sink into war.\n\nEquating Israel to Apartheid’s South Africa is false and outrageous. Its one of the major lies that the Falsetinian ProPalganda succeeded to promote and plant in the European population heads. The very truth is that while Israel is ready to recognize a Palestinian state, where ever its border will be, The Arabs do not want to recognize Israel as the state of the Jews. More than that, while Arabs constitute 20% of the Israeli habitants, the Arabs formally deny the right of Jews to be habitants in their future state. I think that this makes clear that the Apartheid side in this game is the Arabs. The fact that Arabs contribute more to ProPalganda doesn’t make their case more right.\n\nWell, no, it doesn’t happen to be true. A majority of the people between the Mediterranean and the Jordan are Jews.\n\nOlmert’s concern is that it will become true, because the Muslim birthrate is so much higher than the Jewish birthrate, and Palestinian life expectancies are high. Demographers predict that the cross-over point will take place in about 12 years or so. (Claims of Israeli genocide against Palestinians notwithstanding, Palestinians have one of the highest growth rates in the world. Over the last 40 years, the Israelis have proved themselves the most incompetent genocidaires known to history.)\n\nAs for the “South African” solution – the proper analogy is not South Africa. In South Africa, the whites, a small minority, have surrendered political power in exchange for retention of economic dominance. That is not a trade-off that is available in a state where almost half the people are members of the dominant group. The proper analogy is Lebanon.\n\nLebanon is a state that began as roughly half-Muslim, half-Christian, and it has been embroiled in a series of civil wars from its beginning. Anyone who proposes a one-state solution for Israel is proposing a state on the Lebanese model, which is a guarantee of intractable civil war for generations to come. And if there were civil war in Israel, would the neighboring states stay out? They haven’t in Lebanon – both Syria and Israel have invaded repeatedly.\n\nAs they say, if you’re wishing for a one-state solution, you might as well wish for a pony while you’re at it. A two-state solution, on the other hand, might actually work.\n\n@22:\n\nBut a two state solution will only work if there is an enormous reservoir of good will on both sides and a willingness to make it work.\n\nIt seems to me that a one-state solution would require much more trust and goodwill than two states, because the required level of integration would be higher. In order for two states to coexist, all they have to do is not attack each other. If a single state is to function, the inhabitants actually have to work together in matters of day-to-day governance.\n\nThe historical track record of single-state solutions (defined, for purposes of argument, as states formed from the involuntary union of two or more hostile peoples) is a poor one. Lebanon isn’t the only case of failure: others include Cyprus during the “partnership republic” period, Armenia and Azerbaijan during the immediate post-Soviet era, Nigeria, Sudan, the DRC, etc. In a “best-case” scenario, you get a state of sublimated ethnic conflict along the lines of Fiji or Guyana. Even Belgium, with 180 years of single-state inertia and EU-anchored peace and prosperity, is having a hard time making it work.\n\nSouth Africa is the only real counterexample I can think of (Macedonia may be a second one if it survives the next few years), and the Israelis and Palestinians don’t even come close to the conditions that enabled ZA to succeed. Whether or not two states is the fairest solution – I think it is, but that’s a whole ‘nother argument – anything else is way up the gravity gradient.\n\n“If you were sent back to 1945, knowing what you know now, would you advise the Jewish population of the world to set up the state of Israel in its present form?”\n\nOf course, that advice would have to be given on the basis of the conditions then prevailing. Whether the Jews would have been better off in the Kimberleys is a moot point if the Australian government of the time wasn’t willing to take them in – as, if Evian is any guide, it wouldn’t have been.\n\nThere’s also a certain amount of room between establishing the State of Israel “in its present form” and not establishing it at all. One could, for instance, advise the Jews of 1945 to establish the state but avoid certain subsequent mistakes, in which case your logic would dictate that we figure out how the mistakes might be undone or corrected. I’d argue that the Taba or Geneva proposals would be a fair start toward doing so, although your mileage may vary.\n\n@34:\n\nNo, the Evian conference was in 1938, not 1945; in 1945 the nations of the world were much more willing to take in Jewish refugees, and the thing might conceivably have been done.\n\nThey were more willing to talk the talk, but often slower to walk the walk. The United States still had the national quota system and didn’t give any breaks to Eastern European Jews (it’s no accident that the Jews who settled in the US during and after the war were mostly German), the UK was interning stateless Jews on Cyprus and the Polish Jews were returning home to pogroms. Even those countries with more generous policies, such as the Dominican Republic, would likely have balked at admitting hundreds of thousands or millions. Projecting the idea of universal asylum back to the 1940s is somewhat anachronistic.\n\nAnd then there were communities like the Yemeni Jews, who were oppressed as hell but weren’t refugees in the legal sense and wouldn’t have had a snowball’s chance of being admitted to any Western country. Their only realistic chance for freedom and dignity in this lifetime was a state.\n\nIt’s possible to look at a map and find plenty of places where Jews might have been better off. Personally, I think Bavaria would have been nice. It would have required considerably more ethnic cleansing than occurred in Mandatory Palestine, but the consensus seems to be that 1940s-era ethnic cleansing is OK as long as the perpetrators were Allied powers and the victims Germans or Poles. If the Bavaria plan had been put into effect, I’d be eligible for an EU passport today, and my aunt might have started a Moroccan-cuisine craze in central Europe long before the Maghrebi immigrants in Amsterdam got around to it. But for all I can tell, that idea wasn’t even given a moment’s thought, and I suspect that any other plan for mass sanctuary in the West would have been almost equally quixotic.\n\nThe State of Israel in its present form is a Jewish state, existing primarily for the Jews. Thatâ€™s why (a) people support it and (b) other people oppose it.\n\nThere are two groups of people in the world: those who divide people into two groups, and those who don’t. I don’t believe a two-group division is appropriate here. There are certainly those who would support a Jewish state no matter what and others who will oppose it on that ground alone, but there are plenty of people in the middle whose willingness to accept such a state depends on its policies. I don’t believe that very many Israeli policies, either historic or current, were or are inevitable results of Israel being a Jewish state. For instance, some people who have a problem with Israel now would be more accepting of it within the 1967 borders, and others (including, if polls are any guide, a majority of Palestinian-Israelis) would accept a Jewish state that gave full individual equality and collective cultural autonomy to non-Jewish minorities. Neither of these is incompatible with Israel being a Jewish state – the European national-minority framework comes to mind as a method of constructing a homeland-type state within liberal parameters.\n\nThe question as I’d frame it – and the only practical question, in my somewhat biased opinion – is how to construct an Israeli state that is at peace with its neighbors, doesn’t occupy foreign territory and fulfills its legal guarantees of equality for minorities. In other words, the question is how to construct Israel along European lines rather than the Habsburg-Ottoman path it has taken thus far. That seems quite possible to me, certainly more so than any alternative.\n\n@33:\n\nIâ€™m not sure about this, given the smallness of the Palestinian state. I would guess theyâ€™d have to be on pretty good terms with their neighbor if they want to prosper.\n\nAs Alex pointed out, though, even states where the governments (and much of the respective populations) nominally despise each other can coexist reasonably well. I agree that there has to be a minimal level of trust and cooperation for two states to exist together, but the necessary level of goodwill is much less than what’s needed to sustain a single state.\n\nIn my more optimistic moments Iâ€™d hope theyâ€™d be on such good terms that in a generation or so the two states might even decide to merge.\n\nI’d guess that the cooling-off period would have to be closer to two generations, but I don’t see why not. It worked for Germany and France, didn’t it?\n\nWhile we’re all wishing for a pony, my ideal solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be for both Israel and Palestine to join the EU. This would amount to “two states minus” – each state would keep many of the incidents of self-determination (including, critically, separate security forces and citizenships) but would have (1) an overlay of existing supra-national institutions to resolve disputes and deal with cross-border issues, and (2) free movement of people and a universal local franchise. The right-of-return and settler problems would be eliminated quite elegantly – Palestinians could freely live in Israel as citizens of Palestine (or, for that matter, Belgium or the Netherlands) and vice versa. Jerusalem could be a free city under EU jurisdiction and a joint capital. One could even argue that the EU owes it to the Israelis and Palestinians in return for Europe’s role in creating this whole mess. But, well, that and a pony.\n\nOn a somewhat less pony-like level are proposals to create a mini-EU in which Israel and Palestine alone are confederated. The Alternative Palestinian Agenda – which, uniquely among single-state proposals, recognizes Jewish peoplehood and suggests a right of return for both Jews and Palestinians – is a well-thought-out and promising prescription along these lines. If I thought it had a chance of working, I might support it. But I don’t think the necessary level of goodwill will exist without a substantial cooling-off period.\n\nIt’s funny, though, that the more a single-state solution aims to be fair to both sides and resolve both parties’ concerns, the more nearly it tends to resemble two independent states, and the more a two-state solution attempts to guarantee peace and cooperation, the more nearly it resembles an EU-style confederation. Proposals for a just peace seem to be limited (in the mathematical sense) by a confederation of states, so maybe that will be the long-term solution.\n\n@36:\n\nItâ€™s been nearly 150 years since the end of the American Civil War. It doesnâ€™t look like the South is going to rise again any time soon.\n\nWere northern and southern Americans “two peoples” before the civil war, though? Their original union was voluntary, and they seem to have all thought of themselves as Americans despite their political disagreements. That may also be, pace Joshua, why Texas wasn’t viable as part of Mexico but did manage to stay in the United States.\n\nThat’s also, IMO, why South Africa succeeded in transforming itself politically within a single state. The component ethnic groups had lived together for a long time, and except for a homeland movement that was fringe even among Afrikaners, they all agreed that they were South Africans at the end of the day. The main liberation movement was very consciously not indigenous-nationalist and made a point of including everyone in its proposed new state. The stakes in the South African conflict were always framed the political future of a single state, not whether it should divide into two or more. That doesn’t seem present on either the Israeli or Palestinian side of the I-P conflict.\n\nProbably a little late to the party, but I had to point out a few blinding ironies.\n\nAccording to Abe Bird, comparing Israel’s actions in the West Bank and Gaza to Apartheid-era South Africa is abominable. Abe argues that Jordan shall be the new Palestinian state, after all the Palestinians move there. The Jews will keep their land, and the Jordanians will give up theirs, and Arabs in Israel will vote for a government they will never live under. One wonders several things, however:\n\n1) If the Israelis, who immigrated en masse until they were around a third of the Palestinian population in the 1940s, were not accepted by the Palestinians as having a claim to over 50% of the territory, then why would the Jordanians accept giving up the entirety of their control over Jordan by allowing mass Palestinian immigration?\n\n2) If the Israelis are unable to accept the right of return for Palestinians whose families lived in Palestine for a millenium or so, then why would the Jordanians accept taking one for team Israel?\n\n3) Isn’t Abe’s proposed solution precisely the solution that South Africa had for its unwanted majority population – i.e., removing all political rights for blacks by declaring them to be citizens of bantustans that the vast majority of that population would never live in? Admittedly, Jordan is a lot bigger than Swaziland, but the effect – a population living its entire life under the rule of a state over which it has no influence – is exactly the same.\n\nIn other words – Israelis control everything between the Jordan and the coastline, Palestinians are no longer even second class citizens, but rather basically stateless people. Honestly, nationalism can go hang, and that includes Zionism. Enough people have died for the idea that the state – representing ethnicity and race – is god.\n\nThey are native to the geographical area known as â€˜Arab statesâ€™ and therefore they are Arabs. They speak the language, they are a part of the culture, little idiosyncrasies of their particular Arab tribe are irrelevant.\n\nYou mean in the way that Armenians, Assyrians, Persians, Kurds and so forth are Arabs? Then, sure, but I don’t think your argument is a very good one.\n\n(I guess you could quibble about how those ethnic minorities had, in most cases still have, their “own” languages whereas the Judeo-Arabic dialects and written communications of the Jews — I’m not sure whether you are willing even to acknowledge that we constituted an ethnic minority — weren’t “really” a language. But that would be an even weaker argument, and — not that it matters, I guess — a considerably more offensive one.)\n\nThey speak the language, they are a part of the culture, little idiosyncrasies of their particular Arab tribe are irrelevant.\n\nAgain, you seem to be anxious to homogenise geographic areas, and to close off the possibility of transnational communities — diasporas — actually existing.\n\nThe retrospective projection of ethnic homogeneity on multicultural, heterogeneous places seems to me a particularly poor way to try and win an argument.\n\nJust make sure weâ€™re talking about the same thing: ordinary Sephardi, not the religious nuts among them.\n\nGiven the relative absence of your Euro-Enlightenment shearing of “religion” from the rest of culture among, erm, those who are “ordinary Sephardi”, I doubt it is as easy as you apparently think to draw such a line.\n\nCouple of things, abb1:\n\nFirst, why is it an either-or question whether Joe Lieberman is an American or a Jew? People can, and usually do, have more than one identity. I’m an American citizen and a member of the Jewish people. I’m also a resident of New York City, a member of my family, a lawyer, a social democrat and an atheist. There’s nothing incompatible about all American citizens sharing one identity while not sharing others, just like an Iraqi Jew (or an Iraqi Kurd) might identify as an Iraqi but not an Arab.\n\nSecond, don’t people have a right to define who they are? Nations are constructs to begin with, so the views of those who construct them seem entitled to respect. If Jews see themselves as a distinct people, and if Mizrahim regard themselves as part of that people, then it isn’t for outsiders to tell them they aren’t. Somehow I doubt you’d be sympathetic (nor am I) to the flip-side argument that Palestinians are no different from any other Arabs and should just blend into Jordanian or Syrian society.\n\nFor what it’s worth, a sense of peoplehood has been an ongoing Jewish cultural thread through well over a millennium of dispersion. It’s reflected in ninth-century poetry as much as nineteenth, and cuts across the Ashkenazi-Mizrahi divide which those who deny Jewish peoplehood often paint as much sharper than it really was. Peoplehood isn’t the only conception of Jewish identity, of course, and there are both historical and modern countercurrents, but it’s not something that can be dismissed out of hand by saying “they’re Arabs” or “they’re Russians.”\n\nI’m sorry but this is all blather and literary theory. Meanwhile\n\nIsrael is considering an Iran Strike and Gaza’s medical sector suffers Israeli sanctions and people are dying.\n\nMost nationalist movements do not derive from people being driven off their land. And many of those same people are still alive. How many people here are supporters of ETA or the full independent Kurdish nation? Nobody would claim that Chileans and Argentines have to get along but somehow in the middle east things should be easier. Blah Blah.\n\nIsrael is considered one of “us.” It should not be. What demands have ever been made of it? And I mean DEMANDS!\n\nThere’s another thread on deconstruction running at CT right now and they should be joined together. There is no arab point of view represented on this site yet John Quiggen can crack wise about easy and false dichotomies. “Trust us” I hear again and again. But still someone has to respond “No, trust no-one, least of all yourselves.”\n\nInterrogate everything. An old lesson maybe not not one people learned, least of all neoliberal bureaucrats."
