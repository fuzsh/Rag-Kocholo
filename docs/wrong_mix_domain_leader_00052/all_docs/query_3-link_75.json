The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:13 p.m. in room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Gordon Smith (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Senator Smith. Senator Smith. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We welcome you to this hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee's European Affairs Subcommittee. Today's hearing is about the European Union: Internal Reform, Enlargement, and the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Today the committee is convened to discuss the current situation in the European Union, and we do so as, literally, the defensive arm of our alliance is dropping bombs on Belgrade. Our first panel will consist of Mr. Anthony Wayne, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the State Department's Bureau of European Affairs. After we hear from Mr. Wayne, the committee will welcome Dr. Jeffrey Gedmin from the American Enterprise Institute and the New Atlantic Initiative; Dr. Lily Gardner Feldman from Georgetown University; and Mr. Peter Rodman of The Nixon Center. Today, the EU is holding a summit in Berlin during which some of the more contentious issues of internal reform, including the Common Agricultural Policy, are going to be discussed. The summit's agenda, however, has necessarily been dominated by the en bloc resignations of the European Commission last week. I fear that we have only seen the tip of the iceberg when it comes to allegations of mismanagement within the institutions of the European Union. I hope that I am wrong. I understand that former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi has been nominated as the new President of the European Commission. It is my hope that Mr. Prodi and the new commissioners that comprise his team will be successful in tackling the fraud and mismanagement that has infected the Union. With regard to enlargement, I must admit some skepticism about why countries in Central and Eastern Europe would want to join the European Union. For example, the economies of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are growing faster and are experiencing far less unemployment than countries in the European Union. Furthermore, excessive EU regulations, taxes, subsidies, and labor laws could just as easily hurt the economic development of these countries more than EU membership would help them. One final note. Last night the Senate was faced with a difficult decision on whether to authorize NATO air strikes against Serbs as a result of that country's brutal crackdown against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. I supported that resolution, but I must say that from now on, I will no longer have much sympathy when I hear complaints from some about U.S. dominance on issues of mutual interest. The experience in Kosovo highlights the inability of the EU to act together on matters of foreign and security policy. No one can deny that, when the crisis in Kosovo first erupted and for some time thereafter, countries, such as Italy and Greece, were pressing for a policy that differed both in substance and in approach from that favored by other members of the EU, including Great Britain. Its military arm, the Western European Union, refused to take action in Kosovo as it has on other instances where European interests have been threatened and, instead, turned to NATO to address the problems on the continent. I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses this afternoon regarding their views on these and other issues. Mr. Wayne, we turn to you first and invite your testimony. STATEMENT OF E. ANTHONY WAYNE, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE, BUREAU OF EUROPEAN AFFAIRS Mr. Wayne. Thank you very much, Senator, for your remarks and for taking the initiative to have this hearing on what indeed is an important long-term development for the United States, even if today our focus is somewhat to the south or southeast of much of the EU. As you, I think, well know, the origins of the EU come directly out of the devastation of World War II, when a number of the leaders of Europe at that time came away convinced that they had to find a way to bind together the nation-states of Western Europe to avoid another world war. The United States supported and encouraged that development and eventually, through several steps in the process over four decades, now, in fact, arrived at where we are with the European Union. At this point, indeed, as you noted, the 15 members of the European Union are about to undertake the largest single Enlargement that they have ever tried to manage. This is going to be a major challenge for both the members of the European Union and for those countries that would like to join. We have traditionally and consistently supported European integration because we think there is a lot of benefit in it for us, and we are supporting this process of integration in the sense that we see that there can be, an expansion of the zone of stability, prosperity, and democracy to all of Europe. The Enlargement does offer the candidate countries the prospect, as they see it, of achieving the high level of economic prosperity and quality of life enjoyed in the 15 current members. There is some immediate practical benefit in line for the potential members. The EU has put forward its own plans to spend about $82 billion between 2000 and 2006 in what some have called a new ``Marshall Plan'' for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This will amount to a series of assistance efforts designed to bring these economies in line with the rest of the European Union. Equally important, this process will encourage cooperation, reinforce democracy, and greatly reduce the possible damage from nationalistic and ethnic tensions. We, of course, are seeing and currently experiencing the costs of those kinds of tensions in the Balkans at present. In the end, if the current round of Enlargement is completed successfully, the European Union would comprise the world's largest single market, with over 500 million citizens, with free movement of goods, people, and services, and capital, and with an economy significantly larger than our own. Now, as is clear from that potential, our strategic economic and commercial interests are inextricably bound up in this process. The Enlargement will be a difficult process. Unlike NATO expansion or what we did with NAFTA, it involves a significant transfer of sovereignty from one nation to a central authority. It addresses a host of very sensitive legal, social, and economic issues, such as the movement of goods and people. It is somewhat analogous to us asking another nation to sign up to every provision of the Code of Federal Regulations, and there are, I have been told, something like 20,000 pages of what is called the Acquis Communitaire, the EU's laws and regulations, to which these new States would need to adhere in the process of Enlargement. Now any country in Europe can apply for EU membership. Thirteen have done so, so far: Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Turkey. There are three basic steps in this process. First, there has to be an opinion from the European Commission that the applicant is suitable to become a member; second, the Council of Ministers has to approve opening an accession negotiation, which then becomes a very long process; and, finally, at the end of that, there will be an accession treaty, which is ratified by the European Parliament and the parliaments of all the current member states. So, talks have begun now with all the applicant countries, aside from Turkey and Malta. They are in the middle of talks with 6 of the 13 countries. They call these the ``first wave countries.'' Those are Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia. They have begun a pre-accession process with 5 others: Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia. This just started last month. There has, as yet, been no date set for the completion of any of these negotiations and, indeed, the year 2003 is thought to be the earliest possible date for accession. There are a number of predictions among various observers that it will be later than that. But nothing firm has been set yet. On the whole, we estimate that Enlargement should be good for U.S. exports of goods and services to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe. As the prospect of EU membership and membership itself produces accelerated rates of economic growth, our investment in the region should position us to take advantage of this further market opening and growth. But it is interesting to look at the figures of trade and investment. In 1997, the European Union accounted for over 60 percent of the imports into the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The United States accounted for 2 percent. We have made just over 20 percent of the foreign direct investment in Central Europe, while EU member States account for over 60 percent. Now if we compare that to our overall trade and investment relationship with the European Union, which is worth about $1 trillion, you can see that we have a great deal invested in the overall relationship and a significant amount in Central Europe. There is great synergy in those two promises: a buoyant market for our own goods and services and opening that market to a wider area. Many of our companies are well ensconced in the European Union already. Nonetheless, we have been working very hard to ensure that our commercial and economic interests are not disadvantaged in this process. We are working with both the European Union and the member countries to prevent the erection of new barriers. There are, and have been some specific cases where significant tariff differentials do exist on American goods imported into the accession States, and we are working with the candidate countries on a case by case basis to deal with those problems and to insure that U.S. companies are not adversely affected by commercial decisions and, particularly, of course, by commercial decisions taken for political reasons. At the same time, I think we do need to recognize that the European Union means more than just market potential. It has the potential to be a very important partner in addressing common political, social, and security concerns around the world. I think if we reflect on a number of instances, we can see that where the United States and the European Union are able to act in concert toward common challenges, those challenges can be overcome and we can do a lot of good together. The converse also holds. Where we are not working together, we often run into stagnation and blockage in solving those problems. At present we work on a very wide range of issues, from bringing peace to the Balkans and promoting democracy in Africa and Southeast Asia, to assisting nuclear waste cleanup in the former Soviet Union. We are working to develop and deepen our cooperation. Many commentators have described the U.S.-EU relationship as a zero-sum game; that EU growth and prosperity, whether from the success of the Euro or the continuing Enlargement can only come at the expense of American power and prestige. Certainly, we are and will continue to be economic competitors. But with our combined strength, together we can also set a global agenda that supports democracy and open markets. Now, as you said at the opening of the hearing, Mr. Chairman, there is an important summit going on in Berlin among European Union leaders and it will be hard to predict exactly what comes out of that. But they are dealing with some of the largest issues on their agenda. As Enlargement of the EU requires that the candidate countries conform their laws and practices, it also requires significant changes and important decisions about resources on the part of the EU member states. As part of that preparation, the European Commission published what they call ``Agenda 2000.'' This proposed a number of structural, budgetary, and agricultural reforms that would be required to make Enlargement work and work well. There are a number of proposals in this reform that, indeed, would benefit the United States also. The largest step for the EU is reform of the Common Agricultural Policy [CAP]. We very much hope that this reform will reduce the unfair competition faced by our farmers. As a whole, reduction in the subsidy and import funds would help rationalize the EU economy and, we believe, make it more prosperous. Almost half--that is, about $50 billion--of the EU's 1999 budget is earmarked for agricultural subsidies. The EU's budgetary reform, necessary to bring in new member states, would be impossible to undertake if they do not change the Common Agricultural Policy. The EU originally sought to lower EU commodity prices to world levels in order to export without subsidies and to bring EU internal prices closer to those in potential new member states. The agricultural ministers have reached a compromise which has been forwarded to the summit that is a step in the right direction. But, unfortunately, it falls short of the more ambitious goals that had been laid out. It is possible, but we do not think too likely, that the EU leaders will review that compromise and, indeed, make additional cuts. But, in any case, they will be grappling with this budgetary debate today. The CAP debate pits the net recipients of agricultural subsidies, led by France and Spain, against the net payers, led by Germany and the U.K. Even the reform that they came up with, which had a 20 percent cut in cereals, 20 percent in beef, and 15 percent in dairy in 2 and 3 stages over a number of years, even these reforms have set off massive agricultural protests in France, Brussels, and in other places. It is our fear that these smaller cuts won't wean the agricultural sector in the EU away from its dependence on export subsidies. There will continue to be an impact on world prices and our trade interests from the CAP policy even after these reforms have gone into effect. Now I do not want to be mistaken. We are very happy that they are reforming CAP. But many of the proposed reforms just do not meet the minimum expectations that we had for the upcoming WTO negotiations. The United States has an ambitious agenda for the next WTO round in agriculture, including the elimination of export subsidies and the decoupling of domestic supports from production. The danger is that the EU will present Agenda 2000 Common Agricultural Policy reform as a ``fait accompli'' in order to avoid substantive negotiations in the WTO on domestic support and export subsidies. I hope that danger does not turn into reality. Some speculate that the EU might be holding back in order to have something to concede in the next round and there may be further agricultural reforms possible early in the next century. But we will have to see. Now, one of the other big items in the Agenda 2000 that the leaders are grappling with today is to reduce the amount of funds available for direct regional transfers to those parts of the community which are economically disadvantaged. The European Union has set up a process in which the poorer areas get economic assistance from the wealthier areas. But, as you are going to bring in countries whose economic standard of living is lower, that means a number of those member States currently who are relatively below the mean will become above the mean. A number of these current recipients, especially Spain, Portugal, and Greece, are not happy with the prospect that they may have some of their subsidies, structural and cohesion funds, as they are called, taken away. Another area that they are looking at today is how to share more equitably the burden of the $100 billion annual budget. There are a number of member States, particularly Germany and the Netherlands, that complain that they pay too much to support the European Union relative to their partners. The others, of course, are trying to say no, no, you do just fine and we want to preserve the current balance. In sum, this is really an effort for the EU to get its house in order to be ready for Enlargement. We will be looking very carefully at what comes out today from the summit. But it is not at all clear that there will be a breakthrough in the very short term. Let me say a few words about institutional reform that has been going on. Historically, in every step to expand the European Union, there has also been an effort to deepen the Union--that means to make a closer integration of decisionmaking in one area or another. It is often to our eyes and ears pretty arcane stuff to try to figure out all the processes that are going on here. They are very complex, even to Europeans. They are not immediately transparent. But they can make a big difference in how decisions are made and, thus, how well we can achieve our common goals with the Europeans. In 1993, the Maastricht Treaty came into effect. That is the treaty that, in its most famous part, committed movement toward the Euro, which, of course, has now been completed. This was a major step forward in integration in Europe. Following the Maastricht Treaty, the EU leaders very quickly realized they needed to do some more, both to bring the Union closer to its citizens. There had been a lot of criticism in Europe for what they called a ``democratic deficit,'' meaning that decisions were made by bureaucrats very far away from the citizens. Europeans did not understand the bureaucrats and did not identify with them. The leaders of the European Union saw that and said we need to deal more clearly and in a better manner with the problems facing our citizens. This led to the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Treaty of Amsterdam is going to take a number of additional steps forward in the intergration process. One is bringing something called the Schengen Agreement into the EU. This has to do with police and judicial cooperation, cooperation in fighting against cross border crime. Another factor brought into the EU is now combatting discrimination on the basis of gender, race, religion, disability, age, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation. Also, for the first time the EU will have a clear role in employment policy and in the environment. Now there are a number of areas where these changes can make the EU a better partner for us. I think particularly about working together to fight international drug smuggling and to fight international crime. It is clear that on some other issues we will have some differences. In the environment, for example, we have had some significant differences about dealing with global climate change. One big area that you have mentioned, Mr. Chairman, that will also change a bit with the Amsterdam Treaty has to do with how the EU conducts its foreign policy. There will be a new High Representative for the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy. The idea is to give the EU a greater visibility on the international scene, a greater ability to speak with one voice. An effective EU with an effective CFSP would be a power with shared values and strong Atlantic ties with which we could work to solve a number of the global problems and regional problems in other parts of the world. We do a pretty good job right now in coordinating with the European Union on long-term programmatic issues when we are dealing with providing development and technical assistance over a long period of time to Central Europe or to the former Soviet Union, or dealing with providing humanitarian assistance to areas in Africa or other places, where disaster has hit. There is a lot that we do well together. Even recently, in Central America the EU was one of the first to step forward with significant assistance in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch. But where there have been problems is responding quickly to crises and agreeing on common EU positions where we can act together with them. So the EU hopes that these steps to have a new High Representative will help them be a bit more efficient and effective in this process. One of the other steps they also approved is that for the first time they will have something called a ``Common Strategy'' where the EU, as a whole, will agree on an approach to an area. The first areas they are looking at are Russia and the Ukraine. They are doing that right now. It remains to be seen how well these changes will work. But we look forward to working with the new High Representative and the European Union to see if we can improve our cooperation. Another area that is currently being discussed that is not in the Amsterdam Treaty but that is on the agenda, both in NATO and within the EU is the establishment of an operational defense identity for the European Union. We anticipate that the outlines of an ESDI, as it is called will be visible at the April 25 NATO Summit here in Washington and then also will be discussed at the EU's European Council meeting in Cologne in June. It will focus on enabling the European Union to better undertake its responsibilities in such areas as regional peacekeeping, humanitarian and rescue missions. An EU with an effectively functioning ESDI we believe would benefit the United States. It would provide us with a Europe that has the capabilities and the mechanism to permit it to act to deal with problems within Europe, even when we do not want to join in that effort. We will be monitoring these developments closely, especially to insure that the primacy of NATO is not undermined in the process. Beyond these reforms, the EU leaders have agreed that, before the next Enlargement round can be completed, there have to be a number of reforms in the EU's institutions and decisionmaking processes. For example, the European Union arrives at its decisions through consensus on many important issues, including external relations. This often results, we have seen, in a lowest common denominator policy when there are gaps in positions between the 15 member states. The practical effect is that the EU has often been slow to respond in crises. While this procedure is difficult with 15 members, once the European Union expands to 21 members, say, the process could be exceptionally slow and difficult. We expect EU institutional reform to address the three key issues which I just mentioned and others, about which I will not now go into detail: the number of commissioners, the weight of the votes that each of the member States has in the Council, and the extension of a qualified majority voting versus consensus decisionmaking on a wider range of policy issues. With the advent of the Amsterdam Treaty, we are witnessing a dramatic shift in power. I think that might be of interest to you. It will give the European Parliament, I think, an enhanced role in future decisionmaking. With the new treaty, the Parliament will enjoy the power of co-decision--that means it has to have a say in any decisions-- on more than two-thirds of all European Union legislation, compared to less than one-third today. The European Parliament's views will now matter much more than ever before and will need to be taken into account as we work with the Europeans. In this vein, I urge that you and your colleagues consider participation in a recently announced initiative by some of your colleagues on the House side and some members of the European Parliament to establish a Trans- Atlantic Legislative Dialog. The goal is to provide an opportunity for direct exchange on bilateral issues of concern and to help resolve the irritants in relations before they become major problems. Now let me say just a little bit on the recent Commission crisis. Indeed, the group resignation of the Commission derived directly from an investigation and pressure engineered and required by the European Parliament. They requested a ``wise men's'' report on reports of fraud, nepotism, and mismanagement. It was in response to this that the Commission resigned. This was an unprecedented event. So, as you indicated, there was and is still a bit of uncertainty about how this will all be worked out. At the summit today, as you indicated, the member states have agreed that former Italian Prime Minister Prodi should be nominated as the next President of the Commission. He would need to be confirmed by the current Parliament. We believe that is the idea. Then, once confirmed by the Parliament, he would work with member states and others to designate a new Commission. The current Commission remains on duty until replaced. Throughout this period, we have been continuing our regular consultations with the EU on the full range of issues before us. Indeed, as you know, we have a number of difficult trade issues on the platter right now and we are continuing to work those both with the member states and with the Commission to try to resolve them. We know Mr. Prodi well from his period of prime ministership in Italy and we worked with him well then. If confirmed, we look forward to working with him in his new role as Commission President. At the same time, as you indicated, Mr. Chairman, the Commission itself has become the object of calls for significant internal reform. Subjects currently under consideration include tighter controls over spending, more transparent procedure for awarding contracts, stricter accountability standards, and disciplinary procedures for officials who are found to abuse those standards. There is a groundswell to bring the European Union back to its citizens and to address that democratic deficit that I mentioned earlier. We are working at this time to insure that our relations with the EU are strengthened by the outcome of these events. We will continue to use our influence and prestige to encourage the EU to become a more responsive, open, and reliable partner for the United States. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Wayne follows:] Prepared Statement of E. Anthony Wayne Time and again this century the U.S. has been drawn into European conflict. Seared by the devastation of the Second World War, the founders of the European Union dedicated their nations to ending the scourge of war on the European continent. With U.S. help and encouragement, Western European nations started the European integration project that brought bitter rivals together and produced, first, the European Coal and Steel Community, then the European Community, now the European Union. The fifteen member EU is now about to undertake its largest single enlargement ever. It will be one of the most important challenges facing Europe as it moves into the 21st century. We support this historic opportunity to further the integration of the continent by peaceful means, extending a zone of stability, prosperity, and democracy to new members who have thrown off the yoke of Communism. Enlargement offers the candidate countries the prospect of achieving over time the high level of economic prosperity and quality of life enjoyed by the fifteen current EU members. The EU plans to spend $82 billion between 2000 and 2006 in a new ``Marshall Plan'' for the counties of Central and Eastern Europe to help bring their economies into line with the rest of the EU. Equally important, it will encourage cooperation, reinforce democracy and greatly reduce possible damage from nationalist and ethnic tension, which have been such a tragedy for the people of the former Yugoslavia. In the end, if the current round of enlargement is completed successfully, the European Union could comprise the world's largest single market with over 500 million citizens with an economy significantly larger than our own. The United States has long recognized the importance of these goals and fostered them since we laid the foundations for international cooperation in Europe, which eventually blossomed into the European Union. Our political, strategic, economic, and commercial interests are inextricably bound up in this process. Enlargement will be a difficult process for the European Union. Unlike NATO expansion or NAFTA, it involves a significant transfer of sovereignty from one nation to a central authority. It addresses sensitive legal, social, and economic issues like the movement of people and goods. The task facing the EU in its enlargement would be analogous to the U.S. asking another nation to sign on to every provision of the Code of Federal Regulations. Any European country can apply for EU membership, and 13 countries have done so: Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Turkey. The accession process requires (1) an opinion from the European Commission on the applicant's suitability to become a member, (2) the European Council of Ministers' agreement to open accession negotiations, and (3) ratification of the resulting accession treaty by the European Parliament and the parliaments of all the Member States and the candidate country. Accession talks have begun with all the applicant countries except Turkey and Malta. We differ from the Europeans in the way we view Turkey. We focus on the strategic advantages of including Turkey in the EU, while the Europeans see the huge practical, social and economic problems presented by the entry of such a populous and relatively underdeveloped nation to the community. However, both the Commission and the Council of Ministers have recently indicated, however, that they consider Turkey a ``candidate'' country. We also expect Malta to start its accession conference by the end of this year. The Commission is in the middle of negotiations with six of the 13 applicants (the so-called first wave--Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia). Bilateral screening of the legislation of five other candidates (Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia) started last month, a necessary prerequisite for the opening of their accession negotiations by year's end. No end date has been set for the completion of any of the accession negotiations. The negotiations themselves will cover thousands of pages of EU legislation, which candidate states must adopt. The Commission has indicated that, by the end of this year, it would like to set provisional dates for accession as a way of promoting the Union's commitment to enlargement. The year 2003 is the likely ``earliest'' date for accession of the first of the candidates. On the whole, enlargement should be a boon for U.S. exports of goods and services to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe as the prospect of EU membership and membership itself produces accelerated rates of economic growth. Our investment in the region, together with our very good bilateral relations with each of these countries, should position us to take advantage of this future economic upswing. In 1997, the European Union accounted for over 60% of imports into the countries of Central and Eastern Europe while the U.S. accounted for 2%. We had made just over 20% of the Foreign Direct Investment, while EU member states accounted for over 60%. Our trade and investment relationship with the European Union is worth more than $1 trillion. We look to achieve in the East what we now have with the West: a buoyant market open to U.S. goods and services. Nonetheless, we will ensure that our commercial and economic interests are not disadvantaged. When countries accede to the EU, it will liberalize trade to us in most areas. We are working with the European Union and the candidate states to prevent the erection of new barriers to trade. Where none now exists, let none be raised. As Eastern European candidate states adopt the EU's Common External Tariff, most tariff levels will drop in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. In specific cases where tariff differentials do exist on American goods imported in to accession states, we are working with the candidate countries to find suitable remedies. We are monitoring developments closely to ensure that U.S. companies are not adversely affected by commercial decisions made for political reasons. At the same time, we must recognize that an enlarged European Union means more than market potential. It will be our greatest partner in addressing common political, social, and security concerns in the world. The European Union is increasingly ``the other power.'' Repeatedly, we have shown that, where the United States and the European Union act in concert toward common challenges, those challenges are overcome. The addition to the EU of countries--such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and others with whom the United States has worked closely and productively in their transition from Communism to democracy--should reinforce our efforts to create a productive, forward-looking partnership with the European Union. The United States and the European Union are working side-by-side all over the globe to address problems that affect hundreds of millions of ordinary people. From bringing peace to the Balkans, to promoting democracy in areas as far flung as Africa and Southeast Asia, to assisting with nuclear waste clean-up in the former Soviet Union, the U.S. and the EU are setting new levels of cooperation. We will therefore continue to work with the European Union, both during and after enlargement, on problems around the world. We will especially strive to make sure that Russia and the other states of the former Soviet Union see the enlargement of the European Union as a real opportunity from which they too can prosper, rather than an obstacle. We do not view the U.S.-EU relationship as a zero-sum game. Some commentators seem to believe that EU growth and prosperity, whether from the success of the euro or the continuing enlargement, can only come at the expense of American power and prestige. Certainly, we will be economic competitors, but with our combined strength, together, we will be able to set a global agenda that supports democracy and open markets. Where we cannot act together, we risk stalemate. agenda 2000 Much of what I say here may be overtaken by events today and tomorrow in Berlin. The Special EU Summit there is hammering out compromises on budgetary reform. We cannot predict what tradeoffs will be made, but we can outline the issues. Enlargement of the European Union requires the candidate countries to conform their laws and practices to European Union norms. But it also requires preparation on the part of the EU member states. As part of that preparation, in July 1997, the Commission published ``Agenda 2000,'' its proposals for structural, budget, and agricultural reforms required for enlargement of the Union. We can benefit from EU reform. The largest step for the EU is reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). We hope that reform will reduce unfair competition faced by our farmers. As a whole, reduction in subsidy and support funds will rationalize the EU economy, making it more prosperous. Almost half, $50.5 billion, of the EU's 1999 budget is earmarked for agricultural subsidies, and the EU's budgetary reform will be impossible without reform of the CAP. The EU originally sought to lower EU commodity prices to world levels in order to export without subsidies and to bring EU internal prices closer to those in potential new member states. The member-state Agriculture Ministers have agreed on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy that right now unfortunately falls short of the goal. It exceeds the earlier $43.7 billion target spending level by $6.8 billion. It is possible but not likely that, when EU leaders review the compromise agreement this week at Berlin, they will propose additional spending cuts. The CAP debate has pitted net recipients of agricultural subsidies, led by France and Spain, against the net payers led by Germany and the UK. The Agriculture Ministers' compromise calls for support price cuts of 20% for cereals over two years, 20% for beef over two years, and 15% for dairy products. Farmers would receive compensation for lost income in the form of direct income supports rather than price supports. Even these cuts are engendering farmers' protests, yet the small cuts are unlikely to wean European agriculture from its dependence on export subsidies. The CAP will continue to have an impact on world prices and our trade interests. Further cuts will probably be necessary before new Member States could join in the Common Agriculture Policy.We are glad the EU is reforming the CAP. There is a long road to travel to bring the EU into a more open and efficient world agricultural market. Many of the proposed compromise agricultural reforms do not currently meet our minimum expectations for the upcoming WTO negotiations. The United States has an ambitious agenda for the next round of WTO agriculture negotiations, including the elimination of export subsidies and de-coupling domestic supports from production. The danger is that the EU will present Agenda 2000 Common Agriculture Policy reform as a ``fait accompli'' in an effort to avoid substantive negotiations in the WTO on domestic support and export subsidies. Others believe the EU is holding back so that it has something to concede in the next round. In a debate that largely pits the less developed south, against the wealthier north, Agenda 2000 reform also seeks to reduce the amount of funds available for direct regional transfers to aid those parts of the Community which are economically disadvantaged. Under a proposed compromise, eligibility for these monies would be tightened to areas with greatest social and economic welfare needs. This is obviously unpopular with current recipients, especially Spain, Portugal, and Greece. Agenda 2000 also seeks to achieve a more equitable sharing of member states' financing of the EU's $100 billion annual budget. Some member states like Germany and The Netherlands have complained they pay too much to support the European Union relative to their partners. The proposed Agenda 2000 agreement seeks to redress this imbalance by changing the method by which the Union raises its funds. Also on the table is the United Kingdom's $3 billion annual rebate. Won by Prime Minister Thatcher in 1984, the rebate seeks to rationalize the UK's relatively large contribution with its relatively small return from Brussels. The EU conceived Agenda 2000 as a major effort to put its financial house in order in anticipation of enlargement. It is important to note that, in an effort to safeguard the enlargement process, EU leaders have agreed to exclude from budget-cutting consideration the projected expenditures linked to enlargement. Despite this carve-out for enlargement, it is not clear that any breakthrough on the EU budget will be forthcoming in the short term. institutional reform Historically, every enlargement of the European Union to include new member states has been preceded by the member states' deepening the level of internal cooperation. This ``deepening'' usually includes fundamental reforms that give EU institutions a greater say over actions of member states and change how the EU legislates and makes decisions. The current enlargement process appears to be no different. To American eyes and ears, these innovations often seem arcane, bureaucratic, and complex. Nevertheless, they do serve to permit member states to pool their sovereignty while protecting their people's interests. We have to learn to work with the new institutions, and insure they help us further our agenda. With the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, the leaders of the European Union committed themselves to a most ambitious step toward integration, the launch of the euro. As of January 1, 1999, for the first time, participating EU member states have a common monetary policy, conducted by a European Central Bank. This important project is considered an important stimulus for still further integration of the European Union. In the next major step in the integration process, and to prepare the European Union for new member states and bring the European Union closer to its citizens, EU leaders negotiated and agreed upon the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997. Expected to enter into force this spring, the Amsterdam Treaty will incorporate the ``Schengen'' accords on the abolition of border controls, giving EU institutions more say over the control of the European Union's external borders, including immigration and asylum policy. The new Treaty also increases EU attention to police and judicial cooperation and the fight against crime. It commits the European Union to combat discrimination on the basis of gender, race, religion, disability, age, ethnic origin, and sexual orientation. For the first time, it also places employment and environment at the center of EU policy concerns. On one hand, these changes should result in a European Union that is a better partner for the U.S. as we confront the global challenges before us, particularly international drug trade, and transborder crime. Nonetheless, on issues such as the environment, reaching agreement with the EU could well become more difficult. The Amsterdam Treaty will also result in major changes in the way the European Union conducts its foreign policy. A new ``High Representative'' for the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) will give the EU greater visibility on the international scene. An EU with an effective CFSP would be a power with shared values, and strong transatlantic ties with which we could work globally to solve problems. Now we do well coordinating with the EU on long term programmatic issues. A better-integrated CFSP would enable the EU to act effectively in crises as well. We anticipate that the new ``Special Planning and Early Warning Unit'' will permit greater coordination of U.S. and EU policies. In the near future, more foreign policy decisions will be taken by qualified majority voting instead of unanimity. A new type of decision--the ``common strategy''--will be introduced to establish general policy guidelines and give greater coherence to EU foreign policy. The EU has decided to focus initially on a common strategy with respect to Russia. Our hope is that with these changes the European Union will become an even stronger, more responsible foreign policy partner after the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty. Another critical reform currently being discussed that may affect U.S.-EU cooperation is the establishment of an operational defense identity for the European Union. We anticipate that the outlines of a fresh approach to European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI) will be visible at the April 25 NATO summit here in Washington and the June 3-4 European Council meeting in Cologne. It will focus on enabling the Union better to undertake its responsibilities in regional peacekeeping, humanitarian and rescue missions, and other so-called ``Petersberg tasks.'' An effective EU with a functioning ESDI would benefit the U.S. It would provide us with a Europe that has the capabilities and the mechanisms to act when NATO chooses not to. We will monitor this development closely to ensure that the primacy of NATO is not undermined. We have emphasized the three ``D's'' in discussing ESDI with our European friends: no duplication of NATO structures, no de-linking from NATO's core missions, and no discrimination against non-EU members of NATO. Beyond these reforms, European Union leaders have agreed that before this next enlargement round is completed, there must be further reform of the Union's institutions and decision-making processes. For example, the European Council arrives at decisions through consensus on many important issues, including external relations. With members representing nations as disparate as Sweden and Greece, this often leads to a lowest common denominator policy. The practical effect is that the EU is slow to respond in a crisis, and while this procedure is difficult with fifteen members, once the European Union expands to 21 members, the process could grind to a halt. We expect EU institutional reform to address three key issues: the number of Commissioners, the weight of votes for each member state in the Council, and the extension of qualified majority voting to more policy areas. Currently there are 20 Commissioners, with the five largest countries each having two. EU leaders must decide how this formula can be revised to ensure that a larger European Union can still operate efficiently. Member states have indicated that a larger Commission would be too unwieldy and have been trying to design a formula that would accommodate new members without increasing the number of Commissioners. The member states must also re-assess the weighting of their relative voting power in the Council at the same time; they may also extend ``qualified majority voting'' to most of the policy and legislative decisions they take. This would mean less reliance on achieving unanimity, thus potentially increasing the speed and efficiency of the decision-making process. With the advent of the Amsterdam Treaty, we are witnessing a dramatic shift in power which will give the European Parliament a greatly enhanced role in future EU decision making. Under the Treaty, the European Parliament will enjoy the power of co-decision with the Council of Ministers on more than two-thirds of all EU legislation, compared with less than one-third today.The European Parliament's views will now matter much more than ever before. We will need to take this into account as we work with the Europeans on our trade, agricultural, environmental and other interests. In this vein, I strongly encourage you to participate in the recently established Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue, which will provide the opportunity for direct exchange on bilateral issues of concern and will help us resolve irritants in our relations before they become major problems. commission crisis In response to a highly critical wise men's report tasked by Parliament on fraud, nepotism, and mismanagement in the European Commission, the entire Commission resigned on March 16. This is an unprecedented event in the history of the European Union, and we are in uncharted territory. Member states, especially the German presidency, have taken on the resolution of the Commission crisis, and EU leaders at the Summit now going on in Berlin have chosen former Italian Prime Minister Prodi as the next Commission President. Once confirmed by the current Parliament, Prodi will work with the member states to select his Commission. The EU is aiming to have that new Commission confirmed by the newly elected Parliament in July. Commission legal experts tell us that under the Community treaties, the Commissioners will remain on duty until replaced. Throughout this period, we have been continuing our regular consultations with the EU on the full range of issues before us. We realize progress could become more difficult. We know Mr. Prodi and have worked well with him before. It confirmed we look forward to working with him in his new role as Commission President. In many ways, the resignation of the Commission reflects the major institutional change the Union is undergoing. A change that will propel further change. The Commission itself has become the object of calls for significant internal reform. Subjects currently under consideration include tighter controls over spending, more transparent procedures for awarding contracts, stricter accountability standards, and disciplinary procedures for Commission officials. There is a groundswell to bring the European Union back to its citizens, to address the EU's ``democratic deficit'' effectively. We are working to ensure that our relations with the European Union are strengthened by the outcome of these events. We will continue to use our influence and prestige to encourage the European Union to become a more responsive, open, and reliable partner for the United States. Senator Smith. Thank you, Mr. Wayne. That was excellent testimony. I wonder if you can comment on a headline. As a preface to that, I would say I have always been of a mind that, as Americans, we should support Europe in however their self- determination takes them. My belief has always been that that will raise the European vote and, therefore, improve life for them and us as a trading partner and as an ally. But I notice this headline: ``The New Europe: Menace or Farce.'' This is going to be read by a lot of people in this town. I wonder if you think that either ``menace'' or ``farce'' characterizes the European Union accurately. How would you characterize it? Mr. Wayne. Indeed, Mr. Chairman, I would not choose those words to characterize their relationship. Senator Smith. I didn't think you would. Mr. Wayne. I think what indeed is clear is, first, that we have an extremely important economic relationship with the European Union. As I said, it is worth $1 trillion, and there are at least 6 million people--3 million on each side of the Atlantic--directly employed by companies originating on the other side of the Atlantic. This does not include all of the secondary employment that comes from that. Senator Smith. The thesis of one of the articles is, essentially, that this is being done to decouple the United States and Europe, to put up trade barriers and, seeing it as a zero-sum game, that this is a way to make America lose so that Europe can win. Do you think they see it that way? Mr. Wayne. No, I don't think so. I mean, of course, on both sides of the Atlantic there is a wide range of opinion, and I cannot speak for every opinion. But no, I don't think that is the driving force at all or even an important consideration in the majority on the European side. In fact, we have undertaken with the European Union and with the blessing of all the member States a range of initiatives, indeed to deepen the integration across the Atlantic and to reduce the additional barriers. Last May, in London the President and the leaders of the European Union agreed to launch a new process called the ``Transatlantic Economic Partnership.'' Then we worked until December, when we had a concrete action plan which we put forward. This talked about 10 very important areas to reduce regulatory barriers while maintaining high standards of health, safety, and protection of consumers; indeed, to allow freer exchange back and forth across the Atlantic. One of the important points to remember is that, with Europe, we can take these kinds of steps and feel much more secure that we are talking about the same kind of level of standards on both sides to protect our citizens. So, there is a whole active program going on to deal with further taking down of barriers, to bring us closer together. In fact, if you look at some of the high profile disputes that we have been having, some of that is a direct result of the degree of integration of our two economies right now, which has been increasing under what is called ``globalization,'' most broadly, in many commentaries. The degree of integration across the Atlantic has increased. So when on one side or the other side of the Atlantic somebody undertakes what they may consider in their head a regulatory reform only affecting their side, there are immediate shock waves on the other side of the Atlantic. This is a problem that we have to deal with. But it really is a measure of the health of the economic relationship that we have. Just to answer on the other, menace, part of this, certainly as we look at the relationship, we see a great potential for cooperation in dealing with problems that neither of us can deal with by ourselves effectively. When we can combine the assistance resources and the diplomatic resources of Europe and the United States to deal with a regional problem somewhere else, it is much more likely that we can get a better outcome working together than we could working alone. So we see that potential and, try to work with it. Senator Smith. I was in Poland not too long ago. I am generalizing now, but, essentially, what they told me they were being told in their accession talks is raise your taxes, accept our regulations and you may get in but you still won't sell us your potatoes. Mr. Wayne. Right. Senator Smith. I guess my comment is why would a country like Poland, whose economy is coming out of communism and doing very well, or a country like Estonia, that seems to be adopting a Hong Kong model, want to get into the European Union, which are essentially socialist democracies--heavy statist, welfare systems? Why would they want to be part of that if they are actually trying to improve their standard of living? Mr. Wayne. It is because the standard of living at the EU is so much higher than theirs. They are growing at wonderful rates and, as you said, at higher rates than any in the EU. Senator Smith. Will they retard their rates of growth if they accept the high taxes and regulatory burdens of the EU? That is up to them, I know. Mr. Wayne. My guess--I am not speaking as a trained economist here--my guess is no, that they are going to continue growing because they have a dynamic space to grow in right now. They are not at the more mature level economically of the European Union. So I think they will probably continue to grow well. Senator Smith. What is your sense of what Britain will do? Will they get fully integrated or will they just stand apart or take a hybrid approach to it? Mr. Wayne. I think the U.K. has gradually moved closer and closer to the European Union. The big next challenge is whether they will join the Euro. It is clear that there are still divided opinions in the U.K. about that. The government is certainly preparing the ground for a decision to be made to do this. There is strong sentiment in the business community favoring further integration. But there is strong sentiment elsewhere in society the other way around. I just really cannot predict right now where in 2 or 3 years opinion will be in the U.K. But it is very interesting that the U.K. has taken the lead in proposing internal reforms to the Commission in the midst of this current crisis. They have really come in, and Blair has said we need a ``root and branch'' reform of how things are done here. So there is no pulling back from being involved in European Union affairs. And, in fact, part of the new reflection on the European Security and Defense Initiative was initiated by Tony Blair. Senator Smith. Can you briefly comment on Norway and Turkey as it relates to the European Union? I, at least, would regard them as European. Certainly there is no question about Norway. But they are not a part of this and they are not a part of the foreign policy apparatus, apparently. Mr. Wayne. That is correct. Norway did undertake negotiations to join the European Union with the last wave of entrants, with Sweden, Finland, and Austria. They then went to the voters and the voters said ``no, we don't want to join.'' This had to do with the opinion of the Norwegian people. They saw more benefit in staying out than in coming in and, in a sense, overruled their officials and the government at that time, which had wanted to come in. Now they still have a very, very close economic relationship. They have negotiated something that is almost the same as full membership in a number of economic areas. But they do not sit at the table with the other EU leaders when they make a number of the big decisions. On the part of Turkey, I think it is fair to say that there are divided opinions in the European Union about Turkey, about when and if Turkey will become a member, though the European Union of late has been calling Turkey a ``candidate country.'' There have been a number of proposals put forward by the Commission to deepen the Turkey-EU relationship. We think that, there is a shared perspective, that Turkey is very important to Europe, that there should be a closer relationship between Turkey and Europe. It is not a surprise that we have been perhaps more enthusiastic supporters of Turkey moving closer to the EU than certain members of the EU. This will remain, I think, an issue that will have to be worked on by the European Union. But I think there is general agreement that that relationship is a very important one. Senator Smith. Thank you very much, Mr. Wayne. I appreciate your testimony and your answers to questions. We will now call up Dr. Jeffrey Gedmin from the American Enterprise Institute and the New Atlantic Initiative; Dr. Lily Gardner Feldman from Georgetown University; and Mr. Peter Rodman of The Nixon Center. If you would just allow me a moment, I want to find out if there is any vote pending immediately. [Pause] Senator Smith. There is a vote scheduled at 3. Let's start the testimony and I will quickly go over and vote and will come right back. Why don't we start with Mr. Gedmin. STATEMENT OF DR. JEFFREY GEDMIN, RESIDENT SCHOLAR, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE; AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, THE NEW ATLANTIC INITIATIVE, WASHINGTON, DC Dr. Gedmin. Thank you, Senator, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity and invitation to testify today. I have prepared a statement which I submitted for the record. But I am happy to summarize my statement before answering any questions you might have. First, Senator, I should mention that you did hold up the weekly issue of The Weekly Standard. You asked Mr. Wayne if he agreed with the language, ``Europe: Menace or Farce.'' I am the author of one of those two articles and I must say I did not choose that language, either. I am the ``menace'' guy and I would not argue that Europe is a menace--not yet. At any rate, I do want to go on record as saying I still adore the Europeans. I am just deeply skeptical about some of what they are doing. Let me make brief remarks about two areas that you have already discussed with Mr. Wayne today. One is the European Union's enlargement and second is what the European Union wants to do with a deeply integrated Europe that perhaps one day adopts a common foreign and security policy. First of all, on the subject of enlargement, I think it is important to remember that in 1989-1990, our West European allies faced a strategic choice in the midst of stunning changes--the fall of the Berlin Wall, German unification, dissolution of the Soviet Union. The European Union had a chance either to concentrate on widening the EU and including the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe or deepening and concentrating, then, on internal consolidation of power. In my view, it would have been a better choice to concentrate on widening, rather than deepening. You, Senator, have raised very interesting questions as to why our friends in Central and Eastern Europe wish to join this institution. That is an interesting conversation in and of itself, genuinely. But the fact is, as you well know, they do-- desperately and intensely. They do. It is the only game in town. I think that the West Europeans could have served continental and transatlantic interests more effectively had they been a little more open and inclusive institutionally. Broadly speaking, I think there are three reasons why, over the last decade, West Europeans have put their eggs in the basket of deepening. The first has to do with Helmut Kohl's argument. His thesis, as you know and as you will recall, is and was if we don't internally unify Western Europe, if we do not create economic and political unity--and, remember, they were talking about West European unity, and that is unity of the EU members. You rightly pointed out that there are other European countries that do not belong to the European Union, including Norway and Western Europe. Kohl's argument was that the opposite alternative would lead to new dissolution, maligned nationalism, and lethal fragmentation in Europe. I must tell you that I have never bought this argument, as much respect as I have for Helmut Kohl. It strikes me as an argument that maintains that we must stop ourselves before we kill again. It has always struck me that if we have so much confidence in our democratic allies in Europe and in Germany, they should have a little more confidence in themselves. The second reason why the European Union chose to focus on internal deepening rather than enlargement in my view has to do with an argument advanced, including by people like Germany's current Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, that deepening of the European Union is a key to modernization. This is the principal means by which we can become competitive in the global economy. Well, here, too, I must tell you that I found this rather puzzling. I just looked at the statements of two leading politicians in Europe today. Tony Blair, for example, contends that the adoption of the Euro, for instance, will make the EU ``more efficient and less subsidized, more open and less heavily regulated.'' Across the Channel, though, French Finance Minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, calls the Euro ``a tool in the service of a better society, of a better social model; that is to say the European model, based on greater solidarity than in the United States.'' I read this as code words for shielding inefficiencies and protecting against what Strauss-Kahn calls ``the free market illusion.'' The third, and I think the most interesting and compelling reason why West Europeans have concentrated on deepening integration rather than enlargement in the last decade, is rather actually appealing, seductive, and most problematic for American policy. This is that a stronger, more self-reliant European Union will not only be more capable of tending to problems and security in its own neighborhood, it will also be a more effective partner of the United States both within the transatlantic community and around the world. Let me conclude, Mr. Chairman, by just giving you three reasons why I am skeptical of this overall thesis. Of course, it has been said today and it bears repeating that we, as the United States, for decades have supported European integration and over the last decade we have supported the West Europeans in their ambition for a Common Foreign and Security Policy and also the so-called European Security and Defense Identify which, as we have discussed today, would mean the Europeans can act on their own without American participation but relying on NATO assets. Now, briefly, I have three points of skepticism. The first has to do with the general emerging political climate in the European Union itself, which I believe has tendencies, not dominant today, but tendencies which, at their best, are anti-hegemonic in sentiment and, at their worst, outright anti-American. Of course, the French are notorious and to cite our French friends is probably a little unfair because it is so predictable. The French Interior Minister keeps telling us we have our interest, the Americans have theirs. And, doubtless, we don't have to go through all the mischief vis-a-vis Russia, Serbia, or Iraq that the French have put on our table. But it is worth noting that leading French politicians quite explicitly say that the ``raison d'etre'' of the new European Union should be to represent European interests in the world, not transAtlantic interests, certainly not American ones, and that the European Union should be ready to play the role of counterweight vis-a-vis the United States, either directly or outflanking us in international institutions. Now before one says well, that is the French, that is predictable, and that is part of the love/hate relationship, I would hasten to add that our friends the Germans, too, become now, in my view, increasingly prickly about American leadership or what they would call American hegemony. I took careful note of Helmut Schmidt's comments recently. The former German Chancellor said that the arrival of the Euro ``means that the United States can no longer call all the shots in the world.'' I take note of German commentators who argue that with European unity, Europe will no longer ``be seconding U.S. global policies.'' Finally, I make the observation that it is not only the French but other West Europeans and the Germans, too, who refer now to America as the rogue super power and focus great attention on the United Nations; this is to say the U.N.'s Security Council should become the sole, indisputable legal basis for the use of force in international relations. Now there is much talk about the need and the desire to uphold international law. But in my view, this is a desire amongst some of our allies to check American power and room for maneuver. Before leaving this point, let me just mention that I do believe there is much we can do in the United States to alter the style and substance of our leadership. The rules of the game have changed and allies are tired of being junior partners, and understandably so. But I also worry at times that the old, maligned nationalism of the Nation-State that Helmut Kohl was so committed to getting rid of could become replaced by a new, maligned nationalism of a European Super State. The second point I want to mention has to do with burden sharing and our desire and the West European desire to become self-reliant and to take care of security in its back yard. Of course, we have had, already, two instances in this decade--Bosnia and Kosovo--and the results have not been very good. But I would like to point out that in my view, I think we Americans should not underestimate the structural and historical obstacles to the West Europeans doing what we want them to do. I mention two points. First of all, the EU, with all its desire for institutional fixes, still hasn't and will not have for any foreseeable future a national leader. I think Bismarck had something when he said that every alliance needs a horse and a rider. I think in crisis people need leaders and I think that the European formula institutionally may be a formula for common foreign and security policy, but the common part may often be for paralysis, inaction, and lowest common denominator politics. The other point I want to make is the American argument continually and persistently that the West European friends need to spend more on defense. In fact, I think that is true. But I don't think that is a panacea. I think that we have to remember that one of the reasons why we at times have been so successful--that is, Americans and American leadership--is that we have successfully combined military power, military power with the unwillingness, the determination not to appease dangerous tyrants. And for reasons of history, culture, and temperament, I don't think our West European friends share the same lessons in the same way. The last and final point, Senator, that I would like to make has to do with the EU as a partner in helping America defend a liberal world order--something that I am for but that I think we are far from, in fact. First of all, I point out that it is important to remember when we are nostalgic about the days, the good old days, of the cold war, when, as we are told frequently, things were conceptually so much easier, that when it came to our allies, things were never easy, as you know. Whether it was coping or contending with crises like martial law in Poland, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, battling Marxist insurgencies in Central America, getting the European Community to help us react when Americans were taken hostage in Tehran in 1979, in general, the West European friends reacted with temporizing, reacted with equivocation, and were often reluctant to go along. Today, the scene has changed dramatically. West Europeans without the cold war feel less dependent on the United States. Generational change in underway and, as we are discussing today, they are busy developing European institutions with minimal American participation and consultation. I think we have to be very sober in our expectations. Take one example--how difficult it has been for us: bipartisan consensus, as it has existed at times in the United States, to convince our West European friends of the danger of the Iranian threat. I should tell you that I just read in a German newspaper last week an interview with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who just announces unilaterally to his interview partner that ``it is time now to improve the already traditionally good relations between Germany and Iran.'' Finally, Senator, in closing let me just mention that by no means in my view, by no means should this be an argument for disengagement from Europe. I think we need allies. Some of the best allies we have are in Europe, and the allies still need us. I think it is terribly important, when we are working on these problems, to realize that we do want more burden-sharing, but I believe that we want to be a super power. That has costs but also benefits. I believe that it makes sense to support the choices our European colleagues make. They are sovereign, democratic Nation-States. But I think of what Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott says: for this process we have ``hopes and apprehensions.'' I would like to see us emphasize much more the apprehensions, openly and candidly. Finally, when our West European friends tell us that most important to their part is the project of European integration and deepening of the European Union, we should challenge them to transfer at least some of this energy to deepening of the Atlantic community and NATO. My overall fear is this. In the future, I think Americans will be increasingly unwilling to support a NATO that looks backward. However, Europeans today I think are far from taking this project in the future and looking forward. Thank you, Senator. [The prepared statement of Dr. Gedmin follows:] Prepared Statement of Dr. Jeffrey Gedmin Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I want to thank you very much for the invitation to appear before you today to testify on developments in Europe and within the European Union specifically. With NATO poised for airstrikes against Serbia, a mission designed to stave off a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo, I welcome the opportunity for this conversation with you about issues that are not unrelated. In my view they are issues of strategic concern which relate directly to the long term health of Atlantic Community. 1. west europe's strategic choice: deepening over widening After the stunning changes in Europe between 1989-91--including the fall of the Berlin Wall, Germany's unification, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union--West European leaders were faced with a strategic choice: to widen the European Community to include the new democracies of central and eastern Europe and to help consolidate the gains of Cold War victory; or to concentrate on ``deepening'' the European Community by promoting greater West European internal unity through economic and political consolidation and harmonization. At the time, West European leaders were fond of saying that both processes--widening and deepening--were compatible, complementary, and by no means mutually exclusive. A decade later we know differently. Deepening is on track. Eleven of the fifteen members of the European Union adopted a single currency on January 1 of this year. And monetary union is now to be followed by deepening economic and political union, features of which include the West European ambition for a European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI) and ultimately a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Meanwhile, ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, not a single nation from the old Soviet bloc has been admitted to the European Union; nor is any single nation on the verge of becoming a member of the EU--not this year, not next, not the year after. In my view, American interests, Western interests, and European interests would have been better served had the European Union acted over the last decade as openly and inclusively as its sister institution NATO has acted. What explains this pattern of behavior, what one might describe as a form of West European isolationism? There have been primarily three different arguments driving the EU's inward looking, self-absorbed behavior of recent years. First, there was the argument advanced by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Germany is the country in Western Europe which most closely shares the American interest in seeing to it that the doors to Western institutions of consultation and cooperation are open to the young democracies of the east. And Germany has been the leader among West European countries in providing by far the largest amount of assistance to central and eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union since the end of the Cold War. At the same time, however, while in power Helmut Kohl's government remained principally preoccupied with deepening of the EU. ``Unification'' as a cure all to Europe's ills has been an idea of statesmen, princes, and poets on the continent for centuries. And in step with the historical ethos--and, one should add, acutely conscious of Germany's own tragic history in this century--Kohl devoutly believed that economic and political unity would serve as antidote to Europe's darker inclinations. Simply put, unity would once and for all, in Kohl's view, lock in cooperation and lock out the demons of malign nationalism, blood rivalry, and lethal fragmentation. In my judgment, Helmut Kohl's thesis, however sincere, was simply out of date and out of step with developments in modern, democratic Europe. At the beginning of this decade, liberal democratic nation- states existed throughout Western Europe. And without having ceding inordinate amounts of sovereignty or democratic control to supranational institutions in Brussels or elsewhere, West Europe's democracies were doing just fine. It was the central and eastern European democracies that needed help. It was on this part of the continent where stability was needed. But for the new democracies, the EU's doors remained closed. I think U.S. envoy Chris Hill pointed in the right direction, incidentally, when last year he criticized West Europeans for ``toasting themselves and claiming that they have achieved a united Europe'' while the Balkans go up in flames. Others have argued (and Germany's new Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder belongs to this second school) that deepening of the EU--including specifically the adoption of the euro--will help modernize the economies of Western Europe and better permit the EU to compete in a global economy. But here, too, the argument is hardly persuasive. In fact, the divergence of views within the EU itself is striking. British Prime Minister Tony Blair contends that the euro will make the EU ``more efficient and less subsidized, more open and less heavily regulated.'' Across the channel, though, French finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn calls the euro a ``tool in the service of a better society, of a social model, that is to say the European model . . . based on greater solidarity'' than in the U.S.--code words for shielding inefficiencies and protecting against what Strauss-Kahn calls the ``free market illusion.'' Finally, they are those across the West European political establishment who have argued that an economically and politically united Europe--and I always want to remind that what they are developing thus far is a united Western Europe--is an essential part of a maturation process. A united Europe will be better equipped, they contend, to care for security in its own neighborhood. And a united Europe will be a stronger partner for the United States both within the transatlantic community and around the world. This third argument is the most interesting, most compelling, and the most problematic for U.S. policy. Before pointing out what in my view some of problems with its assumptions are, though, let mention that West Europeans have not abandoned the project of EU enlargement. 2. eu internal reform and enlargement Making the EU fit for enlargement. That's what the ambitious reforms known as Agenda 2000 are primarily about. Reform of the EU's finances, farm, and regional policies is necessary if the EU is to start admitting poorer countries from central and eastern Europe. EU officials report that progress on Agenda 2000 has been made; and that remaining problems will be resolved at a special EU summit which takes place today and tomorrow in Berlin. (At the same time, negotiations with five applicant countries from eastern Europe and Cyprus have been creeping along since last November). What's more, the mass resignation of the European Commission recently, EU officials argue, ``should not delay enlargement.'' \\1\\ Nevertheless, it is hard to find grounds for optimism. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ With an annual budget of $100 billion, the Commission negotiates trade issues and is the final arbitrator on antitrust policy and other economic matters. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To be sure, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose government currently holds the rotating EU Presidency, will push hard in Berlin for a full agreement on outstanding issues, probably arguing that the EU's credibility is at stake in light of the European Commission fiasco. But success will be in the eye of the beholder. As for the EU's farm deal, for example, the Economist writes recently that it is largely: an Augustinian package of promises and postponements: yes, we will cut subsidies, but not yet. Cuts in prices guaranteed to farmers for beef, cereals and milk will be phased in, but farmers will be paid directly instead. A review of the quota- ridden diary industry will take place in 2003, but quotas will stay in place until 2006 at least.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ The Economist, March 13, 1999, p. 40. Meanwhile, difficult issues relating to the financing of the EU budget have yet to be resolved. These issues include Germany's wish for a reduction in its net contribution, and pressure from other EU countries for cuts in or the elimination of the UK's budget rebate negotiated by Prime Minister Thatcher in the 1980s.\\3\\ Regardless of what comes out of the Berlin summit, I expect EU enlargement to proceed at a snail's pace. Before Christmas, senior European officials were already confiding privately that ``slippage'' could be expected in the current pace. More to the point, a senior adviser to the Prime Minister of one EU country told me recently, ``publicly, everyone's for enlargement; privately, there's really little enthusiasm.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ Prime Minister Blair has thus far refused to consider giving up the rebate Great Britain received from the EU budget that Mrs. Thatcher secured as compensation for the comparatively limited aid British farmers receive from the EU. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. common foreign and security policy (cfsp) and european security and defense identity (esdi) There remains considerable enthusiasm in West European capitals for the project of deepening integration, however. In fact, just as NATO engages in its debate about a revised Strategic Concept, the EU is devoting considerable energy to modernizing its own institutions, outlook, and mission. Support for European integration has been a hallmark of U.S. foreign policy for decades. And the administration has welcomed new steps, including the arrival of the euro and the parallel movement in recent years toward defense integration. In the 1991 Maastricht Treaty, the EU committed itself to the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). And since that time, the European Union has taken some practical steps by encouraging, for example, EU foreign ministers to develop common analyses; and by agreeing to adopt the post of ``high representative'' for foreign policy (Mr.CFSP), to act as EU spokesman. In the 1994 NATO Brussels Summit initiatives and in the 1996 NATO agreement in Berlin, the U.S. pledged to support the creation of the so-called European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI)--presumably another move forward in the EU's transition from adolescence to geo- strategic adulthood. As British Defense Minister George Robertson puts it, ``without effective military capability to back up European foreign policy, we are wasting our time.'' In theory, ESDI means that NATO's European members, relying on NATO assets, would in the future be able to undertake missions in which U.S. forces would not participate. And the U.S. position has been clear: Yes, to ESDI, as long as this trend does not, as the Secretary of Defense puts it, ``undermine or supersede NATO institutions and missions.'' \\4\\ In theory, it sounds like West Europeans taking responsibility. It sounds like burden-sharing. And for these reasons, enthusiasm in some circles in Washington has been equally clear. Such steps toward greater European responsibility would fit well, for example, with the idea of those, like Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who argue for an increasingly neat division of labor in the alliance: ``Europe leads with the United States as backup on the European continent; the United States leads with European and other allies as back up in the rest of the world.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ ``Report on Allied Contributions to the Common Defense: A Report to the United States Congress by the Secretary of Defense,'' March 1999. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Any honest discussion of these developments must recognize however, in my view, that these trends carry promise and peril. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott talks about ``hopes'' and ``apprehensions.'' As he put it recently, ``We want to see Europe define its identity and pursue its interests in a way that not only preserves but that strengthens the ties that bind [us together].'' Of course, this is exactly the question. Can and will the EU define itself in a way that strengthens the transatlantic bond? A recently published article on ``Building a European Defense Capability,'' coauthored by a respected American, French, and British analyst, contends that any argument ``that a stronger, more assertive Europe will undermine NATO as well as U.S. interests is simply wrong.'' I'm skeptical about the certainty of such statements; just as I'm struck by the vehemence of the authors' tone.\\5\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ ``Building a European Defence Capability.'' Kori Schake, Amaya Bloch-Laine, Charles Grant. Survival. Spring 1999, p. 21. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The EU and its members are entitled to their choices. And of course, we want to encourage our allies to shoulder greater burden within the alliance. But I'm not at all certain that it remains in the American interest to continue offering unqualified support for deepening European integration. Not, at least, without asking hard questions of our allies and ourselves. And not without considering carefully what we can simultaneously do to strengthen Atlantic ties in security, trade, and political cooperation. West European officials increasingly argue, for example, that an economically and politically unified EU is the best vehicle to advance Europe's interests in the world. Fair enough. But should we not be asking what those interests are? And whether they are compatible with American interests, and what we frequently view as, common transatlantic objectives? For clues to the answers, start by considering the current French lament of America as ``hyperpower.'' French President Chirac speaks of a new ``collective sovereignty'' to check American power and sees the EU as playing a crucial role. Meanwhile, French mischief has directly encouraged Russian support for Slobodan Milosevic's Serbia. French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine has advocated accommodationist policies toward Iraq, noting that the French position is that ``of all Europeans, . . . the Arab world, the position of the Russians, the Chinese.'' And France's interior minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, fondly says: ``We have our interests and the Americans have theirs.'' For those of us who still like to believe in the idea of the West, our French friends are not very inspiring these days. Of course, French mischief--and outright anti-Americanism--are nothing new, of course. But consider the changed conditions of the post-Cold War world. With the Soviet threat gone, our allies across Western Europe are feeling less dependent on the United States. Generational change is underway, and younger politicians--on both sides of the Atlantic, of course--no longer have the same intuitive reflexes about the importance of transatlantic relationship that their predecessors had. And, as we've started discussing, West Europeans remain busy developing their European institutions with great enthusiasm--and often minimal American participation or consultation. It is in this wider context that I believe we should consider developments within the European Union. At the summit between French and British leaders in the French port of St. Malo in December, there was talk of Europeans' working ``within or outside NATO'' in the future. The tone and level of interest our British allies are now taking in European Security and Defense Identity is striking and unprecedented, even with all the predictable footnotes about how great European independence will not undermine the transatlantic link. I believe it's appropriate, then, for Americans to ask whether the special relationship with Britain is to fade as the United Kingdom seeks amalgamation with a European federal state. Incidentally, under majority voting in a future Common Foreign and Security Policy, it is possible that our British allies could find themselves at times prevented from joining the U.S., as they did in the bombing of Libya during the Reagan administration, for example, because the EU's majority dissents. I believe it's also appropriate to ask, when the British and French issue a communique affirming that ``the European Union needs to be in a position to play its full role on the international stage,'' what exactly Europeans envisage this role to be--and how it will relate to NATO. I should mention that there are those among our European allies who genuinely believe that the developments we are discussing are fully compatible with Atlanticism and a strong NATO which retains its unity and credibility. There are others, though, who promote in various ways a different vision for the future of U.S.-European relations. Former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt boasts, for example, that the arrival of the euro means ``the United States can no longer call all the shots'' in the world. Prominent German commentators applaud the fact that a stronger EU, as they see it, means that Europe will no longer be ``seconding U.S. global policies.'' French and German leaders alike these days insist that the United nations assume greater power and influence and hold alone the ``indisputable legal basis'' for the use of force in international affairs. Support for the idea in Western Europe grows. The Europeans apparently argued initially that the use of force in Kosovo required explicit UN authority. There are noises about dangerous precedents and the need for stronger international law. The primary intent, in my view, is the EU's desire--and of course, the desire of others--to check America's room for maneuver. Having said all this, it's clear--and understandable--that West Europeans have tired of playing the junior partner in the alliance. Simply put, our allies want to assert their new feelings of independence, and they want to be treated as grown-ups. All fair and reasonable. There's increasingly prickliness about American hegemony throughout Western Europe. And we can do our part in adjusting the style and substance of our leadership at times. At the same time, though, one wonders whether the old nationalism of the nation-state which Helmut Kohl was so determined to bury, may be reborn in a malign supranationalism of a European superstate. Even if such a scenario does not develop, it's still wrong, in my view, for the U.S. to assume that the new EU will share our analysis of problems and our goals in the world. Although it is easy to be nostalgic, it was, in fact, never easy with our allies during the Cold War. Remember the Europeans opposed American efforts to resupply Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War and to forge a unified Western response to the oil cartel's embargo and price hikes. Remember that after U.S. embassy staff was taken hostage in Tehran in November 1979, the United States appealed to its EC allies for support in applying sanctions, to no avail. When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, the Europeans mustered condemnation and little more. When martial law was declared in Poland in December 1981, the EC offered a temporizing response--and massive resistance to U.S.- sponsored sanctions. When the U.S. battled Marxist insurgencies in Central America in the 1980s, the Europeans equivocated; when an EC commissioner warned, for instance, of the danger of ``external intervention feared by all,'' he was understood to be referring as much to the United States as the Soviet Union. And those were the days of Cold War dependency. And today? I am concerned that NATO's new Strategic Concept, to be unveiled at the Washington Summit next month, will paper over important fissures that are not easily mended. Is a united EU ready to join the U.S. in promoting and defending a liberal world order? I'm doubtful. And if we want to promote a common strategic culture we have enormous work to do. To take but one example, remember that our policy of containing Iran has faltered in large part because our allies have been unwilling to take the Iranian threat seriously. And now, despite interesting but also contradictory signals from Tehran over the past year, Gerhard Schroeder calmly tells a German interviewer that ``the time is ripe for an improvement in the traditionally good'' relations between Germany and Iran. And what about the EU in its own neighborhood? West Europeans are desperate to do more. And rightfully so. Remember Luxembourg's foreign minister Jacques Poos in 1991, who declared that this was ``the hour of Europe.'' He also said, ``if one problem can be solved by the Europeans it is the Yugoslav problem. This is a European country and it is not up to the Americans. It is not up to anyone else.'' I don't think it's premature to say that with Kosovo a second chance has already tragically come and gone for the Europeans to solve a problem in their neighborhood without the help of the Americans. And with all the institutional fixes in the works, and all the obsession with new structures, mechanisms, and institutional arrangements, it's hard to imagine the EU--which lacks a natural leader--moving in times of crisis beyond the suffocating confines of lowest-common-denominator politics. Nor am I confident that our West European allies are otherwise on the right course. Defense spending remains low. Our allies spend about 2.2 percent of GDP on defense, one- third less than the United States. In Germany, defense spending as a share of GDP dropped by 1.5 percent last year, down by almost half from its 1990 level of 2.8 percent. And conscientious objection reaches record levels. But there's more to the story. American leadership has been successful when the United States has combined military power with the determination not to appease dangerous tyrants. Even if the EU were to grow its own autonomous military capability, there is no reason for Americans to assume that Europeans, with the advantages, but also in instances the obstacles created by their different history, culture, and temperament, will pursue policies in which we would have confidence. When the West Europeans tried to ``lead'' in Bosnia earlier this decade, we should not forget that leadership often took the form of traditional power politics, with major powers siding with traditional regional proteges, and often turning a blind eye to the victims of aggression. All these points of skepticism that I've raised today should not be misconstrued as an argument for U.S. engagement from Europe. On the contrary. America, the lone superpower still needs allies, just as Europe, its own superpower pretensions notwithstanding, still needs the United States. Issues like Bosnia and Kosovo cannot be solved without American military power and leadership. NATO's enlargement--and the expansion of freedom and prosperity into Central and Eastern Europe-- cannot happen without active American support and participation. At the same time, terrorism, proliferation, rogue states and other new threats are effectively combated only when America and the alliance of democracies band together. With all our differences, that's how the Cold War was won. It is my hope that a successful Washington Summit, the promotion of new Atlantic initiatives--and a healthy dose of skepticism regarding deepening European integration--will help keep the Atlantic community together and moving forward on the best possible path. Senator Smith. Thank you very much. If we could stand in recess, I am going to go to vote. I will be right back and we will carry on. [Recess] Senator Smith. I apologize. There were two votes, not one. But we are now back and I appreciate your indulgence. This is such an important topic and I want to make sure each of you has a chance to contribute to the understanding of this committee on this issue. Dr. Feldman, we will go to you next. STATEMENT OF DR. LILY GARDNER FELDMAN, SENIOR SCHOLAR IN RESIDENCE, CENTER FOR GERMAN AND EUROPEAN STUDIES, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, WASHINGTON, DC Dr. Gardner Feldman. I'm Lily Gardner Feldman, Senior Scholar in Residence at the Center for German and European Studies, Georgetown University. I am pleased to address the committee today, Chairman Smith, and request that a longer written version of my presentation be submitted for the record. Senator Smith. Without objection, that will be done. Dr. Gardner Feldman. I will confine my remarks here to the 5 to 7 minutes I have been given. Both the internal character and the external profile of the European Union are changing in ways that are significant for the United States, especially given the European Union's status as America's most important partner in global commerce and in global problem solving. It behooves the United States, then, to appreciate and anticipate the nature and consequences of the EU's internal deepening and external widening which, I believe, unlike my colleague, have been twin goals since 1989. I congratulate the committee for recognizing the importance of the European Union by holding this hearing. I will divide my remarks today into three parts: first, an outline of three scenarios for how enlargement of the European Union could occur; second, an indication of the institutional and policy reforms that will determine which scenario likely will prevail; and, third, a specification of enlargement's implications for the United States. Let me begin with the scenarios for enlargement of the European Union. The scenarios for near-term expansion of the EU relate to the six candidates with whom negotiations already are underway--Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Slovenia, and Cyprus--and not the other seven applicants, including the special case of Turkey. The presumed date of accession would be 2004-2005, with a 20 year transition period to fulfill all the obligations of membership. There are three main scenarios for enlargement: (1) the total failure of enlargement, due to member State opposition or growing influence in candidate countries of the probable ``loser'' economic sectors, or the refusal of the European Parliament to grant its assent to widening in the absence of major deepening; (2) the achievement of enlargement involving minimal reform and a divisive and piecemeal process. This means perpetuation of the European Union as a hybrid, yet functioning, organization that combines ``flexible integration'' of moving toward a common goal at different speeds; ``variable geometry'' involving a permanent core on certain issues coexisting with countries who opt out; and the pillar system of supranational, mixed, and national competencies. Some of the six current candidates may not make it into this untidy entity. Finally, the third scenario is the realization of enlargement with all candidates in the context of overall, fundamental reform of institutions and policies from which the EU would emerge as a decisive, coherent actor with a sense of direction, streamlined instruments, and a reinvigorated agenda. I predict that scenario two will prevail due to current developments in policies and institutio"
