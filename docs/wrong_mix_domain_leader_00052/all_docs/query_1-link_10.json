        "text": "DRIVE a few kilometres north-east out of Amsterdam and you gradually notice that the landscape has changed. It is, inevitably, flat. But the fields, roads and ditches start to look almost too manicured; the settlements and towns too planned; and the trees become notable mostly for their absence. And then you realise that this area was until recently under water: until 1968, in fact, when it was drained to become Flevoland, the largest and newest Dutch “polder” (land reclaimed from the sea), situated at the foot of the Ijsselmeer.\n\nEvery schoolchild knows that water is critical to the Netherlands. Fully one-quarter of the country is below sea level, and much of it has been reclaimed over the centuries: as people say, “God made the world, but the Dutch made the Netherlands.” Although the landscape looks solid enough today, dangers still lurk. As recently as 1953 the southern dikes were breached, inundating part of Zeeland and killing some 2,000 people. One of the more poignant places in the country is just south-east of Dordrecht, where on November 18th 1421 the dikes gave way and a medieval polder was flooded, with the loss of 73 villages and as many as 100,000 lives. This former polder has never been reclaimed: today its marshes and lakes make up the Biesbosch national park."
