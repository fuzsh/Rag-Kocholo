        "text": "As EU governments prepare for a final hectic fortnight of negotiations onthe contents of the new Treaty of Amsterdam, Dutch Minister of EuropeanAffairs Michiel Patijn admitted yesterday (28 May) that many questionsremained unanswered.\n\n“We will prepare a new text at the end of this week or early next for thenegotiations. But how we will present it, whether we will publicise it orwhether everything will be in it has not yet been decided,” he said.\n\nWhile legal language has been agreed for many of the changes and additionswhich will be made to the existing treaties, a consensus on ways tooverhaul the Union’s decision-making mechanism continues to elude EUgovernments.\n\nDespite warnings at last week’s special mini-summit in Noordwijk that adecision to leave institutional issues until the Amsterdam meeting opens on16 June ran the risk of exposing a squabbling and divided Union to theoutside world, the chances of agreement beforehand are decidedly remote.\n\nThe stakes have been raised by Franco-German suggestions that the votes ofthe big four members, who are insisting that their demographic superioritybe more clearly reflected in the Council of Ministers, should be raisedfrom the existing ten to 25. Smaller countries would also receive anincrease, but of nowhere near the same magnitude.\n\nDutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, who formally denied last week that any suchproposal had been tabled, will try to construct a formula acceptable to bigand small members alike as he conducts his tour of EU capitals in thecoming week.\n\nHe will take the opportunity to advise French President Jacques Chiracagainst any attempt to postpone the Amsterdam summit in the event of achange of government after Sunday’s general election in France – an ideaalready floated by French Socialist MEP Elisabeth Guigou.\n\n“I would consider that a highly unfortunate start for a new Frenchgovernment. There is a very heavy agenda for the second half of the yearand a delay would push a number of issues further into the future. I wouldleave it to Madame Guigou to explain that to Warsaw,” said Patijn.\n\nParallel efforts to find ways out of the Intergovernmental Conference mazewill also be made by Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg next Monday (2June) and by European Socialists – including a bevy of EU prime ministers -at a conference in Malmoe next week."
