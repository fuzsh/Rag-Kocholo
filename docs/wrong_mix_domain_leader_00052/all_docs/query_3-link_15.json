        "text": "Dutch election campaigns are boringly amicable affairs, with every opponent a possible future coalition partner. In 2010, a satirical website decided to spice things up. If the social democratic PvdA dared to make a US-style attack-ad about Mark Rutte, the leader of the conservative-liberal VVD, what would it look like? They produced a spoof showing Rutte’s mother cleaning his home, restocking his fridge, and slinging his Hulk underpants in the washing basket. “Mark is a real boy,” she gushes.\n\nTellingly, the satirists could not think of anything nastier to lampoon than Rutte’s everyman, boyish image of a bachelor who still lives in the modest flat he bought after completing university. Insiders at the Binnenhof, the centre of Dutch politics, stress Rutte’s charm and easy-going manner. As a junior minister for social affairs, he lunched in the canteen and refused to take the special elevator designated for ministers. “So, what do you do?”, he would ask flabbergasted civil servants in the crowded lift. “That’s interesting. I’ll pop by later.” He often did.\n\nEven now, as prime minister, he frequently wanders over to the parliament to chat with party leaders. “You can’t imagine [Jan Peter] Balkenende or [Wim] Kok doing that,” says Max van Weezel, doyen of political reporters in The Hague, referring to Rutte’s detached predecessors.\n\nThis penchant for water-cooler hobnobbing may be a leftover from his years as a human-resources manager at Unilever, a role Rutte held from 1991 to 2002, when he first entered government. While at Unilever, he had served for four years as a member of the VVD’s national board, a position gained on the back of his leadership of the party’s youth wing while at Leiden university, where he studied history, a subject that he chose after briefly contemplating a career as a pianist.\n\nWhen Rutte became prime minister in 2010, his personable manner seemed to European politicians used to dealing with his wooden predecessor, Balkenende, to be a welcome change. But the Netherlands’ rejection of Bulgarian and Romanian accession to the border-free Schengen zone and Rutte’s refusal to condemn an anti-Polish website set up by Geert Wilders’s Freedom Party (PVV) have damaged the country’s reputation. In Brussels, Rutte appears inflexible in negotiations, having to confer with The Hague on trifling issues and seemingly kept on a short leash by Wilders, on whose votes Rutte’s minority government relies to win major votes.\n\nThe big question is how beholden Rutte is to this alliance. Wilders was in the VVD until 2004 and is a natural VVD ally on crime and immigration, issues important to the party’s conservative wing. Until recently, however, Rutte was seen as one of the party’s ‘social liberals’, who support the welfare state, hold progressive values on abortion, euthanasia and gay marriage, and look back nostalgically to Kok’s long-lived (1994-2002) ‘purple’ coalition with the PvdA and the left-liberal party D66.\n\nAt the start of his 2006 campaign for the party leadership, a bid made after just four years as a junior minister, Rutte complained that the VVD had become “a bland brand”, too much the party of the rich and “pearl necklaces”, and too little that of welfare mums. His left-wing reputation almost cost him victory when Rita Verdonk, the then hard-line immigration minister, entered the fray. In the evenings, they would battle it out in front of local party members and then go out for a bite to eat together. “The mood was very gezellig,” says Verdonk’s campaign manager, Kay van der Linde.\n\nThe cosy – gezellig – atmosphere changed after Rutte’s narrow victory in May 2006. Urged on by VVD grandees, 51% of ordinary VVD members voted for Rutte. Six months later, in parliamentary elections, voters gave Verdonk, number two on the party’s list, 70,000 more votes than Rutte. This effectively meant that core VVD voters preferred Verdonk, who had appropriated the populist heritage of Pim Fortuyn, who was assassinated in 2002. An emboldened Verdonk criticised Rutte’s leadership, claiming he was “not really right-wing”, until he ejected her from the party in September 2007.\n\nThe struggle with Verdonk strengthened Rutte’s pragmatic streak. “It made him the broad-oriented politician he is today,” says a close personal friend. It heightened his concerns about competition from Wilders and helped him gravitate towards conservatives in the party such as Uri Rosenthal and Ivo Opstelten, both now ministers. In 2010, Rutte led a successful election campaign promoting traditional VVD issues: fighting crime, raising speed limits and improving public finances. It won the VVD 31 out of 150 seats, making it the largest party for the first time and cementing Rutte’s position as party leader.\n\nAs a negotiator, Rutte first explored forming a government that he might have favoured earlier: a ‘purple plus’ coalition with the PvdA, D66 and GroenLinks, the green party. “Rutte’s chemistry with, in particular, D66-leader Alexander Pechtold and GroenLinks leader Femke Halsema was very good,” says a source close to the negotiations. “But he returned tight-lipped after conferring with the VVD parliamentary group.” Conservative VVD MPs grumbled; others feared such a coalition would strengthen the challenge posed by Wilders in the 2014 elections. In the end, the talks collapsed because the PvdA refused to agree to further budget cuts.\n\nRutte did not seem too disappointed. He formed a minority government with the Christian Democrats (CDA), tolerated by Wilders, dubbing the result “finger-lickingly good for the right”. A former party leader, Joris Voorhoeve, and Gijs de Vries – a former interior minister, member of the European Parliament and EU counter-terrorism co-ordinator – defected to D66 in disgust. Others on the party’s left have gritted their teeth and are hoping for better times. These may come soon, now that Hero Brinkman, a senior PVV politician, has abandoned Wilders and the VVD-CDA-PVV majority of one has disappeared. To ensure the government’s survival, Rutte now has to turn to the SGP, a conservative Christian party with two seats in parliament.\n\nRutte’s concessions to the SGP are often symbolic. Under SGP pressure, the VVD now protects refusenik registrars who object to tying gay marriages. This upsets liberals, but it also enables Rutte to pursue the VVD’s holy grail, of curbing the deficit. VVD insiders see Rutte as a pragmatist who wants his present government to succeed, but will have no qualms about ruling with the PvdA to ensure a second term in office. He does not have grand visions, but leads through his charm and skill at handling people. His supporters believe he can displace the CDA as the central force in Dutch politics, transforming the VVD into a party that can rule with both left and right. That is a goal attractive to VVD politicians of all convictions."
