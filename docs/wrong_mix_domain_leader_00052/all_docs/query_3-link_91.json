        "text": "Riley\n\nThis is the Madeleine Albright interview as a part of the Clinton Presidential History Project. Again, I want to express my appreciation for your agreeing to come down and visit with us. I know you’ve been—I was going to say on the road, but in the air an awful lot.\n\nAlbright\n\nIn the air.\n\nRiley\n\nIt’s very good of you to make time in your schedule to be with us. We had a brief conversation about ground rules before we came on tape. The one thing that I want to repeat for the record is that everyone at the table has been advised that the proceedings are being conducted under a veil of confidentiality. You’re the only person at the table who’s allowed to repeat what occurs in the room. We do this to encourage you to speak candidly to history.\n\nOne of the things that we also do at the beginning of an interview, to help the transcriber, is a voice identification, so I’m going to go around the room and ask everybody to say a couple of words and identify himself or herself to aid the transcriber. I’m Russell Riley, Associate Professor here at the Miller Center, and I’m heading up the Clinton Presidential History Project.\n\nAlbright\n\nI’m Madeleine Albright, the victim.\n\nStrong\n\nBob Strong from Washington and Lee University, formerly of the Miller Center. I was actually here for the [Zbigniew] Brzezinski interview.\n\nChidester\n\nI’m Jeff Chidester, research director for the Clinton project.\n\nSmith\n\nJamie Smith; I’m with Secretary Albright.\n\nKnott\n\nI’m Stephen Knott, Associate Professor and co-chair of the Oral History Program with Russell.\n\nRiley\n\nA couple of things I should say also at the outset. One is we have read your memoir and you’ve done quite a service to history by taking the time to create this kind of record. I had reported to Jamie last week something that I very infrequently do, which is to send a note telling her how much I enjoyed reading this book. It is truly an exceptional read, not just because of the factual content, but also because of your own personal story. It was a real pleasure to spend several days preparing with this book.\n\nWhat the book does for us is it actually is a little bit liberating, because what tends to happen in these oral history interviews is we will spend a lot of time recapitulating narratives and timelines, and there will be some of that I’m sure as we go through the day. But we really can deal with much broader thought questions and things of that nature than having to stay overly wedded to the narrative.\n\nThe other thing is that we were just reflecting on the fact that you were here almost exactly 25 years ago as a part of the [Jimmy] Carter project. You’re sitting in exactly the same room that you were sitting in before. One of your interviewers will be with us at lunch today—Jim Young, who has been the director of the program. So for us—\n\nStrong\n\nThe room is better decorated.\n\nRiley\n\nThe room is better decorated, and the building is about twice or three times as large as it was before. I wanted to begin by talking a little bit about your Carter experience because it is always helpful for those of us who study institutions to get a sense of how those institutions have evolved over time. You’ve had an interesting window into Washington politics generally, and the Presidency in particular, over time. I’m going to start by taking us into deep water rather than asking you to recap your own biography, because we already have it here.\n\nI’m wondering if you could talk for a little bit about the basic differences in Washington and life in Washington, and something about the institutions in the time that you served with President Carter and at the point you come back and begin serving with President Clinton. I know this is a very broad question, but let me throw that out and see if you could reflect on that a little bit. Maybe Bob and others here will help refine my question as we go along. Let’s start there as a way to build on it.\n\nAlbright\n\nThat’s a very interesting way to begin. First of all, there’s no question I saw it from a very different angle. I was a lower-level staffer on the National Security Council. I had worked on Capitol Hill for Senator [Edmund] Muskie, so I had a very good sense of Congress and executive-legislative relations. I have always thought that the executive-legislative relationship is the most interesting aspect of American government. In the in-between years I actually taught courses on executive-legislative relations.\n\nIt made me reflect a bit more on what had happened during the Carter administration, especially in terms of the way decisions were taken on, for instance, the Panama Canal treaty, which was something that I had worked on for Senator Muskie, and then was in the White House for Carter when it actually got approved.\n\nIn both administrations a great deal of time was spent on how you deal with Congress. So for me, the difference was the caliber of the members of Congress. I’m prejudiced about this. I worked for one of the giants in Ed Muskie, who was not only—well, he was Chairman of the budget process as it went into place. Then he had done all the environmental legislation and had been on the Foreign Relations Committee. So he was really a big guy.\n\nOne thing I learned in the Clinton administration is that you spend a lot of time on the Hill as a Cabinet member testifying. I did that both as UN [United Nations] Ambassador and as Secretary of State. I used to say all the time that they weren’t hearings, they were yellings. What would happen is the members of Congress, more on the House than on the Senate side, would make their statement, yell at you, and not really listen to the answers. It was different, I thought, from what I had seen working for Ed Muskie. For me the major difference between the 1970s and the 1990s would be the caliber of the members of Congress. Perhaps it was made more complicated by the fact that, after 1994, we had a Republican Congress and a Democratic President.\n\nThe thing that had not changed—I think was very interesting, and we’ll obviously talk about this more—is the relationship between the Department of State and the National Security Council. From a personal perspective it was the most interesting thing because it was definitely where you stand is where you sit. When I worked for Brzezinski I really had a sense that the NSC [National Security Council] had a crucial role to play, that the State Department sent over reams of stuff that nobody read. The State Department didn’t have enough of a sense of how the White House operated.\n\nThen of course when I was at the State Department, I thought that the NSC was controlling and too operational, wasn’t doing its job, whatever. The institutional conflict is inevitable, so this magnifies the importance of personal relationships and of informal decision-making procedures. In the Carter administration the top officials had foreign policy breakfasts. I never was in them, but they had a lot of discussions. In my time, we had one breakfast a week, which was in Sandy Berger’s office, or before that (when I was UN Ambassador) with Tony Lake, in terms of State, Defense, CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], JCS [Joint Chiefs of Staff].\n\nWhen I was Secretary of State, then there would also be a weekly lunch, which was an Albright, Berger, [William] Cohen—ABC lunch, which was similar to what had happened during the Carter administration.\n\nStrong\n\nLots of things to follow up on. Vance had a daily letter or memo he gave to Carter directly. When you were Secretary of State, did you have a routine, direct communication with Clinton that didn’t go through Berger or the National Security Council? What was it? Is that an important mechanism, document?\n\nAlbright\n\nI did do night notes. I didn’t do them every night and I don’t know if Vance did or didn’t.\n\nStrong\n\nNot every night, but he was permitted to do—\n\nAlbright\n\nRight. And I was permitted to do that. I felt basically that I had good access to the President. I didn’t have to go around the NSC. Despite what I just said in terms of NSC-State relations, I think that probably Sandy and I had as good a relationship between a Secretary of State and National Security Advisor, except, as I often say in speeches, when [Henry] Kissinger was both.\n\nStrong\n\nHe had a good relationship with himself.\n\nAlbright\n\nI didn’t feel that I couldn’t get to the President either in person or on the phone. I could reach him whenever I needed to.\n\nStrong\n\nAnd in thinking about those relationships, is personality more important than institutional structures and prerogatives?\n\nAlbright\n\nI think personality has a lot to do with it. You obviously operate within the framework of the institutional aspects. But if you have a hostile relationship with whomever, it affects everything. And if you have a friendly relationship, then you can get around some of the institutional difficulties. To get down to specifics, Sandy Berger and I had been friends for— actually I think we first met during the Carter administration in a very limited way, because he was deputy director of policy planning and I was a staffer on the NSC. We later got to know each other better through all the losing Democratic Presidential campaigns we were involved in.\n\nHe had come on the airplane during the [Walter] Mondale-[Geraldine] Ferraro campaign in 1984. So we got to know each other then. Anyway, we’d known each other a very long time. When he was National Security Advisor, we would have our moments when he’d call up and say, What the hell is this in the newspapers? How did this get in here? Then I’d say something rude, and then we’d get over it. We’d say, This is ridiculous. We actually did things that probably two men would not do. We hugged each other, made up, moved on. So the friendship part of it was very important.\n\nThere were days when I tried very hard to dislike Sandy Berger and I couldn’t. So that puts it into the institutional thing, because the institutions do set it up that the staffers on both sides help to create some animosity. I’m convinced of that, on both sides. Some staffer would go and rev their principal up. That’s why Sandy and I—we must have talked 10 times a day, depending on what was going on. We’d say, That didn’t really happen. So that friendship, I think, overlies the institutional.\n\nStrong\n\nAnother question related to that. You did say that over the decades you observed it was harder to have those personal relationships between executive branch and members of the legislature. That did get strained. I want to come back and talk a little bit more about why— partisanship is part of it—but there may be other factors. Within the executive branch, are things harder now than they were in the 1970s? Harder to maintain those personal relationships?\n\nAlbright\n\nI can’t answer that very well because my level of operating was so different. There certainly was nothing harder than the Vance-Brzezinski relationship. That permeated everything. From the perspective of where I worked, in fact, some of the animosities from them carried over because the cast of characters was kind of similar. Actually, Sandy and I had very interesting discussions about the fact that—I think what did happen is that the NSC does get more and more operational because the White House gets more and more operational, whether it’s in domestic policy or whatever. That’s really off-putting, but in terms of my own personal relationships, I can’t speak to that. I had excellent personal relationships in the NSC. It may be true of other people, but I don’t think that that was an issue so much.\n\nI think there’s a certain amount of competition among Cabinet members no matter what. I saw it from a lower level in the Carter administration. I can’t remember whether we talked about it 25 years ago, but I had a bit of a problem in that I had worked for Ed Muskie and then he became Secretary of State. Ed Muskie gave his first interview with James Reston. I’ll never forget this. They asked him, How do you feel about the NSC? He said, Well, my former assistant, Madeleine Albright, is over there, it will be fine.\n\nI could not have survived a second term between those two, because Muskie would call me up and he’d say, Your friend, Zbig Brzezinski, in every one of these meetings with the President shows off what he knows about the number of tribes in Nigeria. Who cares? I said, Senator, he’s a professor, that’s what he’ll do. Then the next phone call would be from Brzezinski, and he’d say, Your friend, Ed Muskie, all he does in principals meetings is ask questions. I’d say, Zbig, he is a Senator. That’s what they do. This went back and forth. Then they’d argue about who was more Polish. Really. [laughter]\n\nRiley\n\nWho was more Polish?\n\nAlbright\n\nBrzezinski. And I said that to Muskie. I said, First of all, both his parents are Polish, he speaks Polish, he’s more Polish. It really was ridiculous. As far as I’m concerned, nothing could have been more complicated than those particular relationships. I really had a great vantage point on that.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there particular lessons that you drew out of the experience of the Carter years that you carried forward?\n\nAlbright\n\nYes, actually some of them very specifically. What happened to me, I was a professor for ten years. So I took the experiences of my time with the Carter administration and for ten years thought about them and taught about them. One of the things that I taught about a lot was the NSC system. I had, as a basis, something very interesting, which was that Bob Gates had first been an assistant to David Aaron, who had been Brzezinski’s deputy. He sat in the same rabbit warren that I did downstairs by the situation room. I had to give talks sometimes about how the NSC started to visiting students. So he wrote out for me a history of the NSC, which I still have. So that whole thing evolved for me about how the National Security Council system had started, how every President used it for his own purposes, and the whole history of it.\n\nI was very much aware of it and very much aware of the way Brzezinski had used it. So, in 1992, when I was asked to do the transition for the NSC, those were lessons that I really looked at in terms of how the committee system was going to work, what the working groups were going to be, the relationships, who was going to chair them. That had been the part that was really important in the Carter administration. There were two major—there was the policy review committee and the special coordination committee. Zbig chaired the special coordination committee, which always had to do with cross-cutting issues and crises.\n\nFor me, the interesting question always was, When does a crisis end? Because that was the way Zbig maintained power, which was to never end a crisis so that it wouldn’t go back to Vance chairing it or Brown chairing it. So we began to look at different ways the system would work. The role of the deputies committee was something different in the Clinton administration.\n\nSo to that extent there were lessons that I had taken from my working at the NSC and then my study of the NSC. Then obviously I looked at it during the [Ronald] Reagan administration. I remember one time I had to introduce Zbig during the Reagan administration. I said I would like to introduce President Carter’s only National Security Advisor, because by then the Republicans had had six. So I looked at how it operated, and then whether the NSC should have somebody who was responsible for Congressional relations. I really did think about it a lot.\n\nThe NSC is, for me—when I said executive-legislative relations are inter-branch matters, I think the NSC system is the most interesting foreign policy mechanism in the system.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there lessons about Congressional relations that you pulled out, either positive or negative lessons?\n\nAlbright\n\nMostly positive. As I said, I’m probably one of the—it’s probably not true now—but I was one of the few people in the Carter administration who had actually worked in the legislative branch, certainly in the NSC. There I spent my entire time always telling them, You have to respect Congress. They have a constitutional prerogative on foreign policy making. And Zbig, who was not supposed to go to the Hill, did in fact. He never appeared in a hearing, except I think on Billy Carter, but he’d want to go to the Hill. We’d go to the Hill and we’d sit there and wait for some Senator and he’d say, I don’t understand why I have to sit here and wait for this person and why I’m not meeting with ten people at the same time. I said, Because they’re elected and you’re not.\n\nSo I knew what my place was when as an official I went to the Hill and was respectful of the Senators and many members of the House. I took with me my background from having worked on the Hill more than I think most Cabinet members, except for Secretary Cohen. But I brought with me what I think was a lesson of respect for members of Congress, and I gave them the benefit of the doubt on many things. Also, I’d always take a phone call from a member of Congress. I think generally it was something that we instilled.\n\nI had a very strong Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs, Barbara Larkin. We spent a lot of time together and a lot of time getting ready for hearings. I often felt it was like studying for orals or something. I found it very hard—it’s fun to talk to other professors. Somehow it seems like cheating to go up there with a big book and actually look things up. So I thought I had to memorize all this or I had to know the answers to every budget question. They’d say, You don’t really need to do that; you can look it up.\n\nRiley\n\nWas there anything about—\n\nAlbright\n\nBy the way, is this too chatty?\n\nRiley\n\nAbsolutely not, it’s very rich, very rich. Were there any lessons about—I’m trying to figure out how to phrase this—Presidential power generally? You were watching President Carter up close and personal. Did you leave that experience going into the 1980s with a perception about how a President ought to behave, especially in foreign relations or in Congressional relations? There was this enduring sense that—bluntly—the Carter Presidency was a failure.\n\nAlbright\n\nI so disagree with that.\n\nRiley\n\nI’m throwing that out as a vein of conventional wisdom that is certainly debatable, but the question would be about what you learned about how Presidents deal with issues, or how Presidents behave, that you were bringing through into the ’80s and was informing your work later as you returned to a Democratic administration.\n\nAlbright\n\nWhat is interesting is that there truly is such power in the office of the Presidency that in many ways you imbue the person who is the President with all kinds of things that may or may not be true of that particular personality. But I was so awed by being at the White House the first time, the second time too, by the smallness of the building and the largeness of the post.\n\nI never forget going into my first meeting with President Carter. My job was that I would sit in on every meeting that the President had with members of Congress. But I had never been in a bureaucracy.\n\nRiley\n\nWas this only on foreign policy issues, or every meeting?\n\nAlbright\n\nNo, only on foreign policy. But I hadn’t been in a bureaucracy. So I didn’t know how to behave. The first meeting was actually on the Middle East arms sales, which is why they brought me in at that particular moment. There was a meeting with many members of Congress—ranking, and the Chairman, and the members of the Cabinet—and I was a staffer sitting in the back. I listened with great interest, and when Senator [Jacob] Javits or somebody wanted some information, I knew to write a note that I had to get that.\n\nWhat happened then was we went back to our offices. Brzezinski called me from his office and said, Would you please come up and read your notes to Secretary Brown, Secretary Vance, and me? I looked, and there’s nothing but a bunch of scratches and I thought, Okay, I’m going to lose my job over this. I went up there; it was awful. I said, I didn’t realize I was going to be a secretary. He said, You were the junior member in this meeting, right? That’s the job, for you to write things down. Anyway, there was this great awe of the Presidents.\n\nI think that what happened in the Carter Presidency is that I was not part—I was in all these meetings, but he didn’t strike me as a particularly approachable person, and therefore there was this thing about THE President. I think I took that thing with me to the Clinton administration. It would never have occurred to me to call the President anything but the President or to do anything other than stand up when he came into the room, which was not true of other staffers.\n\nI found that aspect very jarring, the lack of respect for the Presidency by some members of his immediate staff, which was not so evident in the Carter administration. I don’t know whether it had something to do with the age, because President Clinton really was a younger person. But what you do take—this is me; I’m such a sucker for American history—is great respect for the position. So you enhance the person with that, you imbue him with that power.\n\nRiley\n\nTo try to refine the question a little bit, was there any sense, in looking back at your experience with President Carter, places where you felt there might have been improved performance that would have gotten him re-elected? Were there lessons or reflections on what might have been instead of what happened?\n\nAlbright\n\nIt all has to do with the hostage crisis. I think we got totally mesmerized by the hostage crisis. Something in retrospect that should not have happened—it’s very hard, especially for an American President. I happen to think that Carter did an incredible amount for American foreign policy, with the whole human rights approach to it. It went back to a Woodrow Wilson kind of thing, but a different approach. He really was very humane and religious. So for him to have not paid attention to the lives of the hostages would have been antithetical to his character.\n\nWhat happened however, is that they became the central issue. Probably what should have happened is we should have gone on. We became hostages to the hostages. The combination of that and Ted Koppel and Nightline was paralyzing. It overshadowed everything that was going on. Then of course the rescue mission that didn’t work. I think that would have made a huge difference if it had succeeded. You look back at what Carter accomplished at Camp David and various things and the human rights policies and normalization with China, SALT [Strategic Arms Limitation Talks], reacting to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which I think were very far reaching.\n\nIt’s so hard for me to compare the two things because I really was just a staffer the first time. But the difficulty of making the decisions—Carter was decisive; at least he seemed decisive to me.\n\nThere was one weird thing about him. You had to know him in meetings to know that when he said, I agree, that meant he agreed. When he said, I understand, it meant he didn’t agree. After a while, listening to how he talked to members of Congress, you could tell what was going on, but you didn’t know at first. And he smiled at the wrong time. He smiled a lot when he wasn’t really smiling. He was much harder for me to read than President Clinton. But Clinton is ten years younger than I am. I was a Cabinet Secretary. So it’s a little hard to compare.\n\nRiley\n\nWe want to pick up on this, because there’s certainly some evidence that people would misread President Clinton in meetings also. Bob, go ahead.\n\nStrong\n\nI want to ask another comparative question and get back to the question of legislative- executive relations. Probably the hardest vote in foreign policy for Carter on Capitol Hill was Panama Canal. In your years, what was the hardest vote in foreign policy for the Clinton administration on Capitol Hill? Then I want to ask some more questions about the efforts that were connected with prevailing, or seeking to prevail on that vote.\n\nAlbright\n\nIf I can go back on something on the Panama Canal thing—this was something that was very interesting because I did play on both sides of that. It taught me a lesson. What happened on the Panama Canal—I was working for Muskie. I knew he was for it, and so I committed him very early, which was a terrible mistake from the perspective of a Senator because everybody else was getting something for their vote. At one stage I think somebody said, You must have been out of your mind. We could have gotten the Dickey-Lincoln dam. How could you have committed him so early?\n\nI said because he was for it. The relationships between Carter and somebody like Muskie were not good originally, mostly due to staff. If you remember, Carter considered Muskie for the Vice Presidency and then didn’t—I was the one who got the phone call. It was just nasty.\n\nMuskie’s staff—we were just awful, didn’t want to really do a good hearing for Bert Lance. It was embarrassing. Muskie brought us into the office and said, Look, we have only one President at a time. This one happens to be a Democrat and we are going to do everything we can to support him. So he was very forthcoming.\n\nWhat happened—I can’t remember all this exactly—but Carter’s people were not really good at Congressional relations. They had come in from Georgia. People didn’t like Hamilton Jordan, thought he was arrogant. They asked the Senate to vote on Paul Warnke’s confirmation for ACDA [Arms Control and Disarmament Agency] Director. Then came the Panama Canal and SALT II. Sequencing and spacing are important when you are trying to look for votes. So I did take that lesson with me.\n\nWhat was the hardest vote during the Clinton Presidency? I don’t know; there were a lot. We worked with a Republican Congress. I think probably votes that were on the Comprehensive Test Ban or the chemical weapons convention were hard to do. I can’t answer that very well. Certain votes on funding for Bosnia were very hard to do because they demanded of us—in order to get that vote, we had to promise to be out in a year, which was something that I think we thought we could live up to at the time we promised it, but couldn’t. So we were working on a whole host of votes that were very difficult. Do you have one that you think was the most difficult?\n\nStrong\n\nI thought you were going to say UN funding, but that’s really—\n\nAlbright\n\nIt was part of it. What was very interesting, that took a lot of work, was NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] enlargement. But we worked that very well. I really think that we had learned a lot of lessons.\n\nStrong\n\nThat one you won overwhelmingly.\n\nAlbright\n\nYes, but I think we set up this outside committee. We worked with Republicans on it. I set up this whole back and forth with [Jesse] Helms on it. We knew what we were doing on it. That was a sustained effort. It was hard, but we had a laid-out legislative strategy.\n\nOn UN funding, that’s part of a different issue, but it’s not one vote. In looking through your timeline, I see you spend quite a bit of time on peacekeeping operations. What happened was that there was a systematic kind of campaign on Congress’ part to limit the ability of the U.S. to participate in peacekeeping operations when I was at the UN. Every time I wanted to vote on a peacekeeping operation, we would had to have worked on it for weeks ahead of time, had the money lined up, and sometimes it was an emergency and it was difficult to do. It was all part of the UN funding, etc. But that was a series of votes, and it was very difficult.\n\nStrong\n\nWhat I wanted to get at—I think it’s fair to say in the 1990s there would have been more partisanship. It’s certainly a matter that Republicans gained control of the House and Senate. I think the life of members of the legislature is different than it would have been in the 1970s, and the hearings were more unpleasant. But I think Clinton actually does quite well in getting Congress to do what he sees needs to be done, at least in foreign affairs. I wonder—maybe it’s more unpleasant, and maybe there’s more acrimony in hearings, but is there really an issue in Congressional-Presidential relations that is a real deterioration?\n\nAlbright\n\nWell, maybe the way to put it—and again, I look at it from a different perspective. We spent an incredible amount of time massaging the feelings of members of Congress and going to nine zillion hearings and getting ready for them. I think various things that—as you prepare yourself for a job, how much time do you spend on Congressional hearings and how much time do you spend on your job as Secretary of State or the outward aspect of it? There just was a lot of time spent. We worked very hard on trying to get the votes that we had.\n\nIt’s interesting that you see it the way you do, because I think people now—I was reading the papers this morning, and our beloved Secretary of Defense is criticizing people for not knowing history, when I think he doesn’t. Votes taken that might undercut the morale of the military. They were constantly—the Republican Congress—saying that what we were doing in Bosnia and Kosovo was not appropriate, or threatening to cut funds, or making it very difficult. We had to work it and keep going, no matter what. So I think we were successful in getting some of the foreign assistance budgets that we needed, but never quite as much as we wanted. We couldn’t get the international criminal court or Kyoto. Those things.\n\nI couldn’t give it a percentage. I think we did pretty well on a lot of things, but not on everything that we wanted, obviously. Family planning.\n\nStrong\n\nCould we put a percentage on the amount of time a Secretary of State spends on Congressional relations? I’m sure it varies from day to day.\n\nAlbright\n\nIt varies because what you have is the budget cycle. You begin with the subcommittees, then move up. You do the authorizing and the appropriating, and then there would be special times. I’m not really good at—one of the reasons I can’t answer this question—if you were going to ask me the percentages, I think maybe somewhere between an eighth and a quarter. It takes quite a bit of time. Whether it’s specifically in getting ready for the hearings, or sometimes what would happen, you’d have the hearings and there would be a lot of outstanding questions, which are obviously not answered by the Secretary herself, but some of them have to be reviewed because they are sensitive. Thinking about legislative strategy, then dealing with members of Congress specifically, because if they wanted to talk or summon me to the Hill, you’d do that. The kind of things that you wouldn’t think of—going to give a speech for Jesse Helms in North Carolina or Mitch McConnell, or responding to something that they want, which may not be on your schedule. Then having them for lunch or whatever. So quite a lot of time, yes.\n\nRiley\n\nI want to ask one more question that is sort of the before and after, or the Carter and Clinton. I hope that as we go through the rest of the conversations today you’ll feel free to do the same thing when it comes to your mind. One of the things that we haven’t talked about is the fact that the Cold War ended, before and after, which is a big deal.\n\nI wondered—because a lot of what you’ve talked about relates to mechanisms and organizations. Is there something important for us to understand about the way the foreign policy process worked because the Cold War ended? We know that the sets of issues were very different, but is there something about the relative importance of the actors or the way that the actors are engaged in the process that we ought to pay attention to?\n\nAlbright\n\nFirst of all, I think there was a general sense that the national security agenda broadens, that it’s not a matter of just—this is reflected in the mechanisms, too—that it’s not just a matter of the Defense Department and the State Department, but ultimately that many departments are involved. Though I have to say that I had a preview of this during the Carter administration during the Mariel boatlift. There was a meeting in the situation room that I’ll never forget because there were so many more people in it than ever before. You had the Justice Department, and HHS [Health and Human Services], and all the various departments that in some way would be affected by people coming into the United States.\n\nSo rather than the narrower view, which was of the Cold War in which AID [Agency for International Development], etc., our assistance programs were directed at our competition with the Soviet Union, there would be much broader, more uncharted waters in terms of the issues that you dealt with. By statute the NSC consists of the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and CIA and Joint Chiefs as advisors. So when I was doing the NSC transition for Clinton, I pointed out that it might be necessary to broaden the list of principals by Presidential decision.\n\nSo the Secretary of the Treasury then came in as a regular participant, and the UN Ambassador, which, by the way, I recommended long before it ever occurred to me that I would be the UN Ambassador. Then the fact that Secretary of Commerce played a greater role. There would be many more discussions, for instance, with HHS if we looked at health issues. There was a much broader range of issues that became part of what was going on, and looking at 21st century institutions I think much more deliberately.\n\nAgain, on the Cold War, you have to understand where I sat during the Carter administration. I sat with Brzezinski for whom that was a major aspect. I think that probably some of the divisions that happened with Secretary Vance had to do with different views of how the Cold War should be handled. Obviously the relationships with the Chinese that were, from Brzezinski’s point of view, much more of a card to play against the Soviets. Vance wanted to concentrate on getting the SALT treaties done and had a much more lawyerly approach to it.\n\nI think in the Clinton administration we really did have a sense that we were working for the first real post-Cold War President, and that there were so many more issues that needed to be integrated into what we thought of as national security. There really was a sense that you had to look at foreign assistance from a different perspective. There were many more countries that you had to deal with on the basis of their own importance rather than how they played in some sort of a competition with the Soviet Union, much more emphasis on economics and on trade and the difficulty of integrating the international economic portfolios.\n\nThis is something that started during the Carter administration. Henry Owen was a person who worked at the NSC. His portfolio was international economics. You couldn’t quite figure out the chain of command and what he was doing and how that fit in with assistance programs. One of the things that developed was this whole thing of the NEC [National Economic Council] under Clinton. Then there still continued to be questions as to who really handled international economics, whether it was at the NSC or some interaction of the NSC and the NEC. But it was definitely a broader brush.\n\nStrong\n\nWhen was the first time you met Clinton? And was he someone you were paying attention to in those years in the ’80s when you were interested in various Democratic Presidential candidates?\n\nAlbright\n\nI can’t remember the exact first time I met him. I probably ran into him at various events. In my campaign life, one campaign led to another. What happened was that the people who had worked for Geraldine Ferraro, many of them—John Sasso and that group were from Massachusetts. So they began to be interested in [Michael] Dukakis in ’88. There was some thought among people—Sandy Berger, for instance, was a friend of Clinton’s from the [George] McGovern campaign. I had worked for Ed Muskie. I wasn’t that enthusiastic about McGovern, so I didn’t know a lot of the McGovern people. But Sandy and Clinton had known each other from that.\n\nIn ’84 I had been Mondale’s representative on the platform committee. I was so troubled by the fact that we couldn’t agree on anything. There were the [Gary] Hart people and the Mondale people, and we looked like crazies before we ever even got a candidate. I thought if we spent time together between Presidential campaigns, we might be able to develop some sort of coherent platform. So I began to invite people to my house for foreign policy dinners all the time. Sandy very early on made it clear that he thought that Clinton was really going to be the right person to run.\n\nStrong\n\nThis is before ’88?\n\nAlbright\n\nRight. But what happened is that it looked like Clinton might go in in ’88. Whether I actually physically met him before that I don’t know. But then he decided not to go in. People were very surprised that I chose Dukakis very early. I remember—\n\nRiley\n\nWhy did you do that?\n\nAlbright\n\nIt’s a very funny story. Part of it does have to do with the people around. I had met Dukakis for the first time in 1976 when he was chairman of the platform committee. I was asked by the DNC [Democratic National Committee] to go and be the staffer for a regional hearing in Denver. Dukakis was out there and I was very impressed with him. He did a great job in what he was doing. I’d followed him a bit. He’d been voted the best Governor, and I thought he was a really interesting person.\n\nJohn Sasso had been on the Mondale-Ferraro campaign. He wanted to talk to me about Dukakis and what Dukakis was like. We met in a hotel and Dukakis came in. He said, How’s my Secretary of State? I thought, That’s pretty good. I can’t remember who all the other candidates were; somebody called it Snow White—Pat Schroeder—and the seven dwarfs. There were a lot of people who didn’t impress me. I didn’t like [Richard] Gephardt’s view on some of the trade issues even then.\n\nStrong\n\n[Albert] Gore?\n\nAlbright\n\nGore was in it. Anyway, Dukakis appealed to me. There were discussions of Clinton at that stage. I think I probably shook hands with Clinton at the ’88 convention. That was my favorite convention because I did all the foreign policy stuff on the platform on the floor and I had a great time. But the time I really got to know Clinton was when he came up—frankly, many of us in the campaign didn’t like the fact that Clinton would not commit to Dukakis. There were a number of times there were discussions in which people would say, What is Clinton? Is he for Dukakis or not? I remember people saying he’s playing many sides here. But then he gave this endless nominating speech, which Sandy Berger wrote as I remember—it’s all very incestuous.\n\nRiley\n\nIt might have been possible to dislike Sandy in the middle of that speech. [laughter]\n\nAlbright\n\nIn conclusion— But I was so overtaken with my own importance at that convention.\n\nSo Clinton—we were getting ready for the debates. Various people were asked to brief Dukakis on taking various positions. A lot of different people came. Clinton came. He was brilliant. He was very good. Obviously he was committed by then. He gave very good advice. Then we all went out for dinner. Susan Estrich and Susan Brophy, a bunch of us went out to dinner with Clinton and he was great. He was very smart and funny and already what we knew that he was, kind of larger than life.\n\nAfter that campaign, we lost contact. But Clinton had been a student at Georgetown. He and I talked occasionally because he was on the board of overseers and various things. Then one of the more amusing things—somebody asked me to do a seconding letter for his nomination to the Council on Foreign Relations, which I did and still have, in which I basically say he might end up being a national leader, that he would definitely add to the level of discussion, that he liked to talk, or something like that. So I did that.\n\nWe stayed in touch. The truly ironic part is I have really worked in every Democratic Presidential campaign except in ’92. I was president of the Center for National Policy, which was a 501c3, so we offered various briefings to everybody, including Republicans. Obviously the Republicans didn’t pick up the offer, and other Democratic Presidential candidates did, primarily Bob Kerrey. I continued to have meetings at my house with various candidates, Tom Harkin. And Clinton, because he already had his own brain trust, actually did not call on us at all. I’d see him at various fundraisers or something like that, and it was really weird. Normally I had a straight path to whomever I thought was going to be the candidate. It was totally opposite of the Dukakis experience. So I really was not a part of it.\n\nAt the ’92 convention I was co-chair of the platform committee that time with Bill Richardson. We’d been in Santa Fe for the meetings. Already there seemed to be something I was quite uncomfortable with, which was what’s-his-name from the DLC [Democratic Leadership Council].\n\nRiley\n\nAl From?\n\nAlbright\n\nAl From had worked for Muskie too. We had known each other for a very long time. There was a little bit of competition between the Center for National Policy and the DLC. But I also found that all of a sudden the platform was going kind of anti-labor to me. Some of the discussions that we had in Santa Fe, the DLC line, was a little too centrist for where I was.\n\nRiley\n\nThis was on domestic issues.\n\nAlbright\n\nThis was domestic. When you’re co-chair of the whole thing—we had a lot of regional hearings and interesting things. I spoke at the ’92 convention from the podium, but I was not in the campaign. You may get sick of all these stories—\n\nRiley\n\nNo, they’re wonderful.\n\nAlbright\n\nWhat happened in ’88 was I really was queen of the floor on foreign policy issues. We were doing no first-use issues, Palestinian state, and the defense budget, and I was all over the floor of the convention, flak jacket and walkie-talkies. People would say, Go talk to X delegation, and I’d rush over there. In fact I was nicknamed R2D2. [laughter] Everybody had to talk to me. I was in the trailers and all that.\n\nThen in ’92, had it not been for my friend, Susan Brophy, I would have had nothing to do in the convention. But she asked me to go and stand next to some delegation and go like this when they were supposed to stand up.\n\nRiley\n\nRaising the hands and lowering them.\n\nAlbright\n\nThat was it. That was my only role, beyond speaking. I did speak from the podium. But in terms of real activity, I was totally out of it.\n\nBut what happened was, once he was the nominee, there were again—funny how life works. I had a student when I first started teaching at Georgetown—her name was Nancy Soderberg. Nancy had come to work for me when she was a student. This was in ’84. She said, Is there anything you can do to help me get into the campaign? I said, Why would you be asking me? She said, I know you’ve got political connections. So she started out being a delegate counter in the ’84 convention. She went to work for [Edward M.] Kennedy and then she came to work for Dukakis doing issues. She went back to Kennedy, and then she did issues for Clinton. She said, You’ve got to write some papers. Everything was happening in central and Eastern Europe, my area, some in the Balkans. I said, I’m still president of the Center for National Policy. She said, You just have to do these papers. So I did a series of papers for candidate Clinton on that. I never went to Little Rock during that campaign.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd you weren’t consulting routinely on the phone with anybody?\n\nAlbright\n\nNo, just through Nancy. Jim Steinberg was down there. Another friend of mine, Barry Carter, was down there. So there were people down there. I would see Clinton at things. He gave three speeches at Georgetown. I think they asked me to review the last one on national security. But you can imagine this was all a little frustrating, since I had been so much a part of everything. Then Sandy was put in charge of the whole national security cluster and he asked me to do the national security council transition.\n\nRiley\n\nThis was before or after the election?\n\nAlbright\n\nAfter the election. In fact, I didn’t go to Little Rock for the election night. I was really, in contrast—\n\nRiley\n\nYou had your nose pressed to the window.\n\nAlbright\n\nIt was very weird, it truly was. In fact, something happened that made me so mad. I’ll never forget it. During the campaign at some point Tony Lake and Sandy came to see me and they said, We just want you to know that you were in charge during the Dukakis campaign and we are in charge now. I said, I’m not asking to be in charge. But there was a very direct message to me that this was not my campaign.\n\nThen Sandy asked me to do the NSC transition—we clearly have a very yin-yang relationship. I think he might say the same thing about me, that he tried to dislike me and couldn’t. But he asked me to do this and I was thrilled. I loved the idea of doing it. So I was the first Clinton person to go back into the White House. I arrived in early November. I went up to the guard’s gate. I think this is in the book. I said, We’re back. I sat in an office that was about three feet from the office that I’d left in ’81. But the downstairs had all been redecorated and they used china cups instead of Styrofoam, and it was all mahogany. It was like going into the house that you owned and somebody had redecorated it and put all their own photographs around. It was a very strange feeling.\n\nI asked [Karl] Rick Inderfurth to join me. The job was to go and figure out what everybody at the NSC had been doing. It was the real handover. Then, because the NSC is as flexible as anybody wants, we really thought a lot about what the organization should be. It was at that stage that we thought about the fact that the UN was going to play a much greater role, which goes to your point about the end of the Cold War. The UN clearly was not an instrument that was of any use during that period, but we thought that it could and should be of much greater use.\n\nTherefore the decision was made. Jeane Kirkpatrick had been invited to principals meetings, but she was not a regular member. So we suggested that the UN Ambassador be a Cabinet member and a member of the Principals Committee.\n\nThe whole job was interesting. Literally we went around and interviewed everybody. Having been transitioned into before, it was very strange from the Carter to the Reagan administration, because a man called [James] Bud Nance, who ended up working for Jesse Helms, which was a weird connection, had come in and said that they had decided, because they thought that Brzezinski had too much power, that they would de-fang the National Security Advisor. The idea was that he would not have a press or Congressional relations person. I was one of the fangs.\n\nI knew what it was like to be transitioned into by unfriendly people. So I went around with Rick and we interviewed everybody. You make decisions about whom you are suggesting to keep, who are the political people, who are the professionals. It was at that stage that we decided that Dick Clarke should stay. But my strangest moment, having been there and everything, to go into an office that had been Ollie North’s. The offices in the Old Executive Office Building are very tall with high ceilings. Ollie North had created a whole second level in his office. They had built—he really was operating, I was surprised to see it—a little staircase inside. We presented all these suggestions.\n\nRiley\n\nWe being—\n\nAlbright\n\nRick and I. In written form, to Tony, about what could and should be done, what the size of the budget could be, how the NSC system would work, what its relationship might be with the new NEC. In the meantime you sat there and waited and you thought, Maybe somebody will call to offer me a job. It just kept taking longer and longer and nothing was happening. Then at some point Sandy called me in and said, We want to offer you— I had thought about what I wanted, and I wanted to be Deputy Secretary of State because no woman had had that job. I thought, If that doesn’t work, then Assistant Secretary for Europe.\n\nSandy called me in and said, We want you to be Ambassador to the UN. The first words out of my mouth were, Dick Gardner will kill me. Dick Gardner was a friend of mine from ages, from when he was in the [John F.] Kennedy administration. I knew that that was the one job in the world that he wanted. He had worked for Al Gore and Al Gore really liked him. So instead of saying, Yes, that’s great, those were literally my first words. Sandy said, Don’t worry, we’ll take care of that.\n\nAnyway, I said, Thank you. He said, Nothing is set. You just have to think about it and wait. So I waited and I waited and I waited. Finally in December I couldn’t stand it anymore. I went to my office on a Sunday and kept waiting and would call my machine and nothing would happen. I was writing memos. Finally around five o’clock there was a phone call from somebody saying, Warren Christopher’s office. I should check; the lawyers wanted to talk to me about getting vetted. I said, Well, they’re certainly going to give me some job.\n\nI put all my stuff together and then I got home. Warren Christopher called and he said, Come down to Little Rock, but don’t tell anybody. The night before, I had to go to Chuck Ruff’s to get vetted. He starts out by saying, You were born in the United States. I said, No, I wasn’t. We went through three o’clock in the morning, this endless story. Getting to Little Rock from Washington is like going to outer space. Also I had planned a Christmas party for the Center for National Policy, but I couldn’t tell anybody where I was going. So I had to go forward.\n\nI told the woman who worked with me that I had a family issue and she had to have the party at my house while I was gone. So I get to Little Rock. Fortunately I was on the airplane with Dick Riley’s wife. She said, You do realize that Dick sat in his hotel room the whole day waiting for this phone call. I sat there and sat there. Nancy Soderberg, who was down there, would call up and say, Everything is fine. He will see you; don’t worry about it. Finally, at eight o’clock at night, Christopher calls and says, The President-elect would like to see you later tonight. I said, Later tonight?\n\nI had been up—he said, Yes, but you and I can have dinner first. So we go and have dinner. We’re sitting in this dining room where there’s no other human being. He said to me, I’m going to tell you something. I’m going to be Secretary of State. I said, Chris, that’s so great. He said, Don’t show any emotion. There’s nobody in the whole place. He said, You’re going to go meet with the President-elect. So we went to the mansion. It was eleven o’clock at night, for the most important interview of my entire life.\n\nRiley\n\nAre you a night person?\n\nAlbright\n\nNo, I’m a morning person. Nancy in the meantime kept saying, Call your kids. They should be here because the announcement’s going to be tomorrow. I said, Nancy, there’s no reason to think I’m actually going to get this job. I don’t want to get them here and I’m not going to get it and whatever. She said, Go and see Clinton. So I get there and I sit in this kind of outer porch waiting. Chelsea [Clinton] is flitting around inside among boxes. Jim Woolsey walks out. He had had his interview.\n\nClinton was fantastic. He said, I want you to be the UN Ambassador. One of my questions, I said to Chris when I was having dinner with him, Is the UN job going to be a Cabinet-level job? He said, I don’t know, ask the President. So even before I open my mouth he said, It’s going to be a Cabinet-level job. We talked about the importance of the UN. It really was quite stunning. He said that he saw it as a very important organization. It was part of what he wanted to see in a post-Cold War world. He actually said, and I think he might have meant it, that if he weren’t going to be President, he’d love to be Ambassador to the UN.\n\nWe talked a lot about general foreign policy issues and the way that he saw the role of the United States and all of that. I get out of there and Nancy calls me and said she had arranged for the kids to come. Then I wake up in the morning and CNN [cable network news] says—Clinton had told me what the whole team was going to be. CNN says, Tom Pickering is going to be head of the CIA, a whole bunch of things that were totally different, and I believed CNN. [laughter] I just thought, If it’s on TV it must be true.\n\nThen we all get to the mansion for sort of a pre-announcement meeting, what kinds of things we were going to say. It was evident within five minutes that Jim Woolsey was on a totally different wavelength from everybody else. Just very interesting, kind of strange, a different approach to things. Then we have this announcement. My kids were so funny afterwards. They said, Mom, these are all the people who came to our house for dinner. Then everybody was very excited and very pleased. We were all going to leave Little Rock. Jim Woolsey, because he was going to be head of CIA, already had an airplane. The rest of us—Little Rock was fogged in and we had to stay.\n\nWe all went to dinner. It was very exciting at first. After a while, we all thought, Okay, we’ve got to get out of here, we have things to do. It got a little—everybody was tired. We went back to the hotel. I couldn’t sleep, finally took something. The phone rings and this man says, Ambassador Albright? I’d never been called that. He said, I’m the Ambassador from Bangladesh. I said, It’s one o’clock in the morning. He said, I just wanted to make sure you would never forget me. [laughter]\n\nRiley\n\nAnd it worked.\n\nAlbright\n\nThen we go back and it all starts.\n\nRiley\n\nI want to dial back on a couple of things. You okay to continue?\n\nAlbright\n\nI’m fine. Probably too chatty for history.\n\nRiley\n\nWe’ll take a break in a few minutes. I wanted to ask you a question about—\n\nAlbright\n\nCan I mention one thing? Nancy sent me something and said they had submitted a list to Clinton about people who should be in the administration, a long list of names. The only one that had a check mark by it in his left-handed way was my name and good written under it. I was very pleased with that.\n\nRiley\n\nYou touched a couple of times on these meetings you used to have at your home when the Democrats were in exile, so to speak. Can you tell us a little bit about that? What were these things like? They have a sort of aura and mystery from outside.\n\nAlbright\n\nWhat’s really funny is that people described it as a salon, which is a joke, because they were around my dining room table. I had a housekeeper who was not a great cook, so we just had casseroles or something. There would probably be about 12 people there. What we’d try to do—there were some professors from Georgetown, Sandy Berger, and various people who reappear. We’d usually have a subject we’d talk about and have a couple of people present some ideas and then have a discussion about it. The whole purpose, as I said earlier, was to get ourselves ready for having a united front doing the platform. But they were just good discussions.\n\nI remember one time in the paper they said after we had won that they were salons. Somebody said, Well, we certainly don’t go there for the food. I think that they were just really good discussions and we all got to know each other.\n\nStrong\n\nI have a follow up too. When that Democratic advisor circle was gathering, what was the most divisive issue?\n\nAlbright\n\nThe most divisive issue—well, it depended on the era. I think the most was the approach to the Soviet Union. There was hard-line versus—I was always much more hawkish than everybody. Something that started in the ’84 campaign and then went on was the use of force. Under what circumstances do you use force?\n\nThe Hart line—Gary Hart—that continued through was a discussion that then gets picked up at various times in every administration, whether or not you have very defined rules for the use of force. It had been something that [George] Shultz and [Caspar] Weinberger had fights over. The Shultz-Weinberger argument had originally been a Mondale- Hart argument. That was a very divisive thing, whether you had to go through a checklist of predetermined conditions or whether it was the job of the President to decide when to use force. It was all related then to the Cold War and the Soviets.\n\nKnott\n\nYou said you were hawkish and you mentioned earlier that you didn’t like George McGovern. Were you ever tempted at any point during these years to go the way of, for instance, a Jeane Kirkpatrick?\n\nAlbright\n\nNo.\n\nKnott\n\nWhy didn’t you go that way?\n\nAlbright\n\nBecause I’m not that hawkish. Also I was raised to be an anti-Communist; there’s no question about that. I had a different view of what the American role should be in terms of cooperation and partnership and alliances. I never had the view of America’s dominance. It has been harder to explain that than I ever thought it would be.\n\nI have said, and I stick by it, that America is the indispensable nation. But that does not mean that we should try to act alone, or that we don’t cooperate generally or are not part of institutions. I basically said it in order to rally the American people to realize that just because the Cold War had ended, that didn’t mean that we didn’t have international responsibilities. So I don’t have that We’re better than everybody else view, despite the fact that I do think we’re an exceptional nation.\n\nI think that the way I phrased it in my new book is, We are an exceptional nation, but we can’t ask that exceptions be made for us. So that’s really why I didn’t even go as far as being a Henry Jackson Democrat. I’m anti-Communist, but not close-minded I think.\n\nThe thing that I found hard—I always did find hard, and I mentioned this to a lot of my students—it’s very hard not to be part of whatever the mood of a campaign is. There were some Democrats who, for a long time, made fun of anybody who was—the post-Vietnam group was fairly derogatory about people who had hardline views about the Communists. With Dukakis for instance, I know now exactly why they brought me on. They thought he was too soft on some of the Russian things.\n\nRiley\n\nWho was that?\n\nAlbright\n\nDukakis and various people, Sasso. I remember having this ridiculous discussion with Dukakis when he said, I’ll get along with [Mikhail] Gorbachev because we’re both lawyers. So during the debate prep stuff, I was advising that we needed to at least have the capability to threaten force. I can’t remember what the issue was. I remember him saying in front of everyone, There you go again, my bomber. So I did have the reputation of being fairly hard line and anticommunist, but not so far to be in Henry Jackson or Jeane Kirkpatrick’s—\n\nStrong\n\nIn the conversation with Clinton in Little Rock, does he raise Somalia, Bosnia, any of the issues that are likely to be important for a UN Ambassador?\n\nAlbright\n\nI honestly can’t remember, because I was so overwhelmed.\n\nStrong\n\nSo it was a general discussion.\n\nAlbright\n\nA general discussion. We had had discussions about Bosnia. I remember, during the convention in New York, there were a couple of meetings of foreign policy people. There had been a discussion about the importance of being tough in Bosnia, which then leads to some questions about why we didn’t pursue a stronger policy at the beginning.\n\nChidester\n\nWhat were your perceptions of Clinton’s understanding of foreign policy issues? At this time he’s a Governor of a small state. He doesn’t have the best foreign policy credentials, but he’s also quite intelligent. From these general conversations, and also other early conversations, did you feel that he had a deep understanding of foreign policy issues?\n\nAlbright\n\nMy sense about him was, first of all, I thought he was—I’m just trying to remember. He was there a long time during the Dukakis debate prep stuff, and we clearly covered foreign policy issues. He showed a nuanced understanding of issues. Then in some of the conversations we’d had in the intervening years, mostly to do with Georgetown, we had had some foreign policy discussions. I did something probably by deduction, which is—he had gone to the School of Foreign Service, which is where I taught. I know what the students are like there. You don’t get people who aren’t—it’s a trade school in many ways. It’s part of special training; you take all kinds of courses that are very specific to international relations. So I knew what kind of background he had, which is quite a stunning background, I think, for an undergraduate.\n\nI think he had probably as good an understanding of foreign policy issues as most Presidents going in. There is no way to overstate to all of you how smart Bill Clinton is, what an incredibly absorptive mind he has, how curious he is, and how much reading he does. That was evident in every single meeting I ever had with him. He would always ask the next question or take the issue one level higher. I never had any question as to whether he was capable of it.\n\nThen the speech that he gave at Georgetown I think was very well informed, but speeches anybody can write. He did a good job on the Q and As. He did a pretty good job in the debate. We had just survived Reagan. I must say, my impression now of father [George H.W.] Bush is much higher than it was at the time. I regret every negative word I ever said about father Bush because he is a star in comparison to his son. I think he did have a good understanding of foreign policy, George Bush. I was pretty impressed with Clinton, but I have to admit some of it was deductive in terms of knowing what kind of students—the fact that this kid from Arkansas chose to come to Georgetown and had worked for [William] Fulbright and had pursued this education.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd had gone to law school.\n\nAlbright\n\nRight. So I didn’t have any concerns about that.\n\nRiley\n\nYou helped with debate preparation?\n\nAlbright\n\nNo, this was back when Clinton helped to prep Dukakis—\n\nRiley\n\nI misunderstood.\n\nAlbright\n\nI literally had nothing to do in 1992 beyond being in a couple of meetings and writing some papers.\n\nRiley\n\nThat’s what I thought I heard, but I wanted to make sure that was clear. I wanted to ask. Let me follow up with two or three quick questions and Bob, we’ll come back to you. One was, you had mentioned that very early on you detected in these conversations that Woolsey was not on the same wavelength as everybody. Can you elaborate on that? What is it—?\n\nAlbright\n\nWhat I think had happened here was that Woolsey had been chosen partially because, I don’t know what you call the neocons of the Democratic Party—the [Henry] Jackson wing of the Democratic Party had wanted to have somebody. Then the real problem was that Woolsey wanted to be Secretary of Defense. That was very evident in terms of his view of things, whatever interjections he made at meetings, the way he treated Les Aspin and things like that. He just had a different viewpoint.\n\nRiley\n\nTwo others. You told us a fair amount about your previous relationship with Sandy Berger, but Tony Lake is also important at this stage. Did you have a long working relationship with Tony?\n\nAlbright\n\nNot quite as much, because Tony lived in Massachusetts. I had known him, also. Let me back up on something. There was definitely animosity between State and Defense during the Brzezinski-Vance era. There’s no question about it. I had gone to work for Brzezinski right after we left the Carter White House. In fact, I helped him in putting his book together. There were people that had had a very hard time with. Brzezinski writes a lot about this, about his whole China initiative. We had Mike Oksenberg. He took the lead, and he and Dick Holbrooke at State argued constantly. So there was a sense, if you go back and look at Brzezinski’s memoirs, he has a few choice words.\n\nTony was there at State as the policy-planning guy, and I think was viewed a little bit as wishy-washy on some of the issues of the Cold War. But I don’t think I really knew Tony at that point. Then there were a variety of places that we saw each other, at conferences or at some Democratic events. During the Dukakis campaign, because he was at the University of Massachusetts, he would be a part of a few things, but not to the extent that a lot of people were. He kind of dipped in and out. Sandy is the one who brought Tony in because he had worked for Tony and they had been really good friends. Tony was definitely a central person in the Clinton campaign. Clearly we did not get along that well. Part of it had to do with, I don’t know what it had to do with, but we had issues.\n\nRiley\n\nYou’re suggesting the roots go way back.\n\nAlbright\n\nSome of it. I at various times would say either to him or later to Sandy, I’m not Brzezinski. This goes to some of the personal relationships. There is a history to various things. I actually thought I would get along better with Tony than I did because our views, later in terms of Bosnia and things, were very similar.\n\nI think one of the most interesting Washington developments, and very un-Washingtonian, is that Sandy could have been National Security Advisor at the beginning. He says this himself—he felt that he didn’t have the experience and so he suggested that Tony be National Security Advisor and that he be his deputy. Then Tony, who seemed like a very sweet guy, proved very controlling. He ran the principals meetings in a very different way from Sandy, much less effectively, and he was rude to me. There’s no other way to describe it.\n\nWe’ll probably get to this on Bosnia. First of all I felt very strongly about it. But being at the UN I think gave me a totally different view of foreign policy from other principals. As I’ve said in many places, I saw more different foreigners per square inch than any other American diplomat to get a sense of how other countries were reacting to America’s position. That was one of the reasons I thought, no matter who had the job, it was valuable to have the UN Ambassador on the principals committee, because you could bring a whole different view. Every time I would talk more than two minutes, Tony would start going like that [drumming fingers on table] or looking at his watch. So that got on my nerves.\n\nStrong\n\nThat recommendation that the UN Ambassador be Cabinet officer with status on the principals, did that mean that the UN Ambassador was going to have more staff? Did that mean the UN Ambassador was going to have an office in Washington as well as one in New York? Or was it just a question of status and duties?\n\nAlbright\n\nAt the time, when Rick and I recommended it, we didn’t fully understand that question. It was more originally that that voice needed to be heard in terms of what I just said, bringing an additional level of information and understanding to the table and then taking it back. What then happened, and it just shows my ignorance of this, I truly didn’t understand how U.S.-UN—which is the U.S. mission to the UN—operated.\n\nOne had the feeling from a lot of the reading that I thought I’d done, that it was almost like an agency. But the truth was, it was an embassy. It just happens to be in the United States. What we found out in the course of the transition was that there had been what was called USUNW, a Washington office for the UN Ambassador within the State Department that was associated with the bureau of international organization affairs but had its own office. The rumor was that Pickering, when he was UN Ambassador, got into trouble with Secretary of State James Baker. Baker was upset because Pickering was always on television during the Iraq crisis. So they decided to abolish the USUNW office.\n\nI thought that that was impossible. Given the fact that we had said there should be a principals’ role, there had to be a Washington office. Christopher was terrific. We talked about this. It was a very complicated organizational chart because I was an instructed Ambassador, but I had a dotted line to Christopher directly. Also, because of the principals committee setup, I felt comfortable talking to the National Security Council directly. Christopher was actually very generous because he said, You are an instructed Ambassador, but I expect you to express whatever views you want in the principals committee.\n\nIt was very interesting sitting in many places. But what we did do then was actually create a UNUSW office in which I had a Chief of Staff and some people who worked closely with the legal section and with the international organizations bureau, including David Scheffer and Jim O’Brien. So we developed a little place. It meant, physically, when I came to Washington, which I had to do—for some reason when this all started I thought the Clinton administration would be organized and there actually would be Cabinet meetings on Monday and we would have principals meetings at particular times. We practically never had Cabinet meetings. At the beginning the principals meetings happened constantly and I’d be going back and forth between New York and Washington. I thought, Okay, what would make sense is if I could spend the weekends in Washington. I didn’t give up my house. It was crazy.\n\nBut I did have a place in the building, in the State Department. It also meant—Christopher was great. He said, Whenever you’re in Washington I want you to come to my morning meetings. I was very much a part of what he was doing. I had a very good relationship with him. The Deputy Secretary, Cliff Wharton—at the beginning, I didn’t know him that well, but when Strobe [Talbott] became deputy, we spent a lot of time together. So I was more integrated, I think, into the building and also into the White House than previous UN Ambassadors.\n\nRiley\n\nOne more question and we’ll take a break. Dick Gardner ends up with a couple of nice diplomatic assignments, but doesn’t get an appointment at a very high level. What was the story behind that? You had seemed to think that he might have—\n\nAlbright\n\nI never quite understood this. I first met the Gardners in 1962. We were next door neighbors. He was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for IO. I thought that was the highest level diplomat I would ever meet. He was really, really smart about the UN and population issues. He’s an international lawyer. During the Carter administration, he was one of the three people who originally supported Carter—Vance, Brzezinski, and Gardner. He doesn’t quite make it. He’s Ambassador to Italy, but is not on the same level. I don’t know. I think that people—he’s full of himself, to a great extent. He’s his own worst enemy.\n\nI truly do think he is probably the most qualified person to be UN Ambassador ever of any of us. This is really indiscreet, but I think that what happened was he worked for Gore during the Gore-Dukakis thing. Then he just could not stand the fact that I, especially, who was just his wife’s friend, had all of a sudden all this power. During the Dukakis campaign, we made a real point of, once you’re the candidate, of bringing people in. So I met with him. I asked for a lot of papers about the UN. All of a sudden I get a call from the agents around Dukakis’ house saying there’s just been a FedEx package delivered here from Ambassador Gardner.\n\nI said, Hold it please. I called Dick and I said, What exactly do you think we were talking about? He said, That I’d do papers for the UN? Did I not say that they were to come to me? He said, Yes, but I know Governor Dukakis. I thought I’d send them to him directly. I said no. So this kind of thing has been going on for quite a while. But I do think that he would have been suited. He however did not think I was suited. I went around afterwards to people in the department and I said, We have to use Dick Gardner. Warren Christopher said to me, I don’t know why you’re being so nice to him, because he’s not being nice about you.\n\nSo then, in the second term, when we were considering who should be UN Ambassador, we were in an office with Vice President Gore and me and the President and a couple of other people and they said, Who do you think should be UN Ambassador? I said Dick Gardner. Vice President Gore said Dick Gardner and the President said no. He didn’t explain why. He just said no. We came out of the Oval Office and Gore turns to me and says, How are we going to explain to Dick Gardner that the Vice President and the Secretary of State think he should be UN Ambassador and he doesn’t get the job?\n\nAnyway, I do think that he is so smart and I think he would have made a brilliant UN Ambassador.\n\nRiley\n\nI appreciate the information. It’s a puzzle from the outside.\n\nAlbright\n\nI think it’s his personality. They have been—he was a brilliant Ambassador in Italy, and then we made him Ambassador to Spain, and I think people there think he was—he’s a brilliant man, smarter than most people we all know. I certainly feel very comfortable with the fact that despite all, I tried.\n\nRiley\n\nLet’s take a break.\n\nRiley\n\nThere were a couple of things that came up during the break that we might want to get on tape.\n\nAlbright\n\nMy course. I have developed a course called the National Security Toolbox. I always begin with the fact that foreign policy is just trying to get some other country to do what you want. That’s all it is. So what are the tools that exist? The reason that I came up with this goes back to the Carter administration and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nAfter the Soviets invaded, we had a very large interagency meeting. The various agencies were supposed to put on the table something that—we knew we couldn’t push the Soviets back right away, but how to punish them. So people sat around and tried to figure out what to do. It was pretty paltry. I mean, grain embargo, fishing, stopping some fishing, Olympics. I was just stunned. Here we were, the most powerful country in the world. There was a call-up of the reserves. But basically there was not a lot that we could do.\n\nSo when I was at Georgetown before, I team-taught a course that was kind of a capstone, an international relations course, and already began to put in certain elements of what the tools were. Then, when I was back in office, it was very evident to me again how few tools this country really has, or any country has. So in this course we start out with diplomacy, bilateral and multilateral, then sticks and carrots, looking at assistance programs and trade and sanctions and embargoes, then the threat of the use of force and the use of force. Intelligence and law enforcement. Then what is a lot of fun, I’m sure you do with your students, is play simulation games. We did North Korea for three years and I got sick of that. Now we’ve been doing Iran. I have set up a principals meeting. The students take different roles. I’m the President.\n\nThen in another room we have the friends of Iran, who then turn into the Security Council. What I do is—I’m not only President but I’m deus ex machina—and whenever they’re getting anywhere near something that they agree on, I bomb or something. But it’s a great way to teach. So I’ve enjoyed doing that course. I’ll send you the syllabus.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you want to say anything else? There was another comment you made off the tape about making some distinctions between some of your colleagues and their working styles as teachers. If you want to say, fine. If not, we can go on.\n\nAlbright\n\nThey’re interesting issues I think. People who go back and forth into the government from various roles—I think it’s interesting to look at the contrast of lawyers. There are a lot of lawyers who come. There are a lot of people who might have worked on the Hill at some time or other, and there are obviously a lot of academics. I think different ones look at it in different ways.\n\nThere are certain professors—I said I try very hard to analyze my relationship with Tony because I think that he was surprised that I wrote in my book that he was impatient with me. I think there are at least two kinds of professors. There are some who ask a question of their class and then wait for the students to come up with different views and try to understand where they’re coming from. Then there are others who have an answer in their heads and expect the students to guess what it is. Tony was the latter kind.\n\nAt times when you were on the wavelength that he wanted in a principals meeting, he encouraged discussion. But if you were not, he was not interested. First of all, this is a female thing. I’ve talked about this a lot. I get a lot of resonance when I talk to any group that has any women in it. Women in a meeting are quite different from men. Some of it has to do with first getting a sense of the room and knowing who’s who, then waiting to see what you might say when you can say it. Most of the time—and I can’t tell you how many times I get total agreement and head nodding from women about this—you wait and wait and you think, I can’t say that; that’s too stupid. Then some man says it and everybody thinks it’s brilliant. You’re really mad at yourself for not having spoken earlier.\n\nRiley\n\nIn my case with my wife, she says she has just had a conversation with the man who speaks up on that point who has just told her that that’s not a very good idea.\n\nAlbright\n\nThat happens, too. And women raise their hands. You don’t get called on until the point is no longer germane. When I teach, I have to say, my classes are a bit of a zoo. I tell people they can’t raise their hands; they have to interrupt. So my motto for women is you have to interrupt because I’m convinced that you listen differently if you’re going to interrupt than if you’re just—I don’t know if there’s such a thing as active and passive listening, but I created that.\n\nSo here I am, as UN Ambassador. There were no other women on the principals committee. I already had a rather strange experience in New York. It was the first time, and I do write about that, too. I had this real conflict of being a woman and yet also the representative of the United States. I’d go into my first Security Council meeting, which is not in that big room but in a small room, about the size of this, and there are 14 men of different races sitting there like this, looking at me. I think to myself, Okay, I’m going to wait and figure out where I am. All of a sudden I realize I can’t do that. I’m the United States, and if I don’t speak, at some point in this debate, even though it’s my first minute there, first day there, our voice will not be heard.\n\nSo I got very much used to saying what I had to say. I did feel very strongly about Bosnia. This was an issue that came up very early. In looking at your timeline I can see some of the directions you were going in. As I mentioned, during the campaign I really had a sense that the Clinton campaign people, of which I was not one, were very proactive on Bosnia. They were very critical of the fact that the Bush administration had not done anything about it. There were questions already about why the Germans had been the ones to recognize Croatia, what direction it was going in.\n\nIt seemed to me that one of the things we were going to do was be proactive on Bosnia. What happened then was that other issues—I don’t know all the aspects of this, but clearly the gays in the military issue had a big effect on how Clinton dealt with the military. Some of the questions that had come up over his draft status in Vietnam played a role. The military, until now, has not particularly liked Democrats. So there was some tension in that regard.\n\nThere also was a huge economic agenda, and obviously the campaign had been about the economy stupid. There were a lot of things that happened. I felt that there was not enough happening on Bosnia. I sat up there every day with different sources of information, one of which was the Bosnians who were up there, [Muhamed] Mo Sacirbey and various people who were up there, very strongly saying the United States should do something. Then there were other members of the Security Council who felt we should do something. One of them was a very interesting man called Diego Arria from Venezuela, who was very proactive. I was getting a lot of information about what was going on there.\n\nI went to the principals meetings and it did not seem to me that we were where we should have been. I have to admit that at that stage I hadn’t learned to argue in a way that didn’t strike Tony as being emotional, which is the best way to put a woman down. I remember one time I said something like, Gentleman, history is going to judge us very badly if we don’t do something. Our main problem, in addition to everything else, was Colin Powell. I say this with a lot of regret, because Colin and I are very good friends.\n\nI had first talked to Colin when he was Deputy National Security Advisor during the Dukakis campaign because the campaign is entitled to an intelligence briefing and I was the one who set it up. So Colin and I started talking at that stage. So here he is. Except for Powell, we were all brand new.\n\nYou have a huge agenda at the beginning of an administration, some of which was in the books that we prepared, Rick and I, for the transition. You begin a whole series of principals meetings. It’s always the same people. You are working your way through problems and trying to figure out each other’s personality and what your job is and everything. Colin was the grownup. Here he was; he’d done it before. There is something about arriving in a meeting with medals from here to here and having just won the Gulf War and having been National Security Advisor and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. If you’re going to do military action, you’re dependent on the military. You have a new Secretary of Defense who is being mau-maued by the new CIA director, and I mean there are a lot of strange things going on.\n\nSo the thing that would happen on a regular basis would be that Tony or Les Aspin would say, We need a plan from the Joint Chiefs about under what circumstances we could use the military. On a regular basis Colin would come in and do a presentation. He is a brilliant briefer, and the Pentagon is really good at pictures and charts and 3-D things. Colin had a little red pointer and he’d go through this and say, We can take that hill and we can do that and we can do this. You know we have the best military in the world, but it’s going to take 500,000 men and $500 billion and 50 years. What are you going to say to Sergeant Slepchok’s mother when he dies from having stepped on a land mine? So he’d lead you up the hill of possibilities and then drop you off the other side, and you’d end up with no options.\n\nAt one stage I did say, You know, Colin, what are you saving this incredible military for? He did get mad at me. But then he reached the end of his term and General [John] Shalikashvili comes in, who is a very different kind of a Chairman, somebody who had worked with the UN and on Operation Provide Comfort in Iraq. Also, he was a European. He just had a different approach. He began to point out what could be done. Also, at that stage, President [Jacques] Chirac was very helpful, and we actually took on a military operation in Bosnia and won.\n\nSo when Colin wrote his book, he wrote that I practically gave him an aneurysm when I suggested this, and he had to explain patiently to Ambassador Albright that our military were not toy soldiers. One of the problems with writing a book is it always takes a while to get it out. Somebody from the New Yorker I think called me up and said, Have you read Colin Powell’s book? I said no. So I thought, What the hell. I called him up and said, Colin, ‘patiently?’ He said, I did have to explain it to you patiently. You didn’t understand anything about the military. So he sent me his book and he signed it, To Madeleine, with love, admiration, etc. He signed it, Patiently, Colin.\n\nI sent him back a note and said, Dear Colin, thanks for the book. With love and admiration. I signed it, Forcefully, Madeleine. But he did play this role of somebody who was, as I said, the grownup. So it limited, I think, to a great extent, what we were doing initially in Bosnia. I think Christopher also was slower on it. Tony and I were for it. On that issue, over time, Tony and I were able to develop a good relationship.\n\nKnott\n\nHe never really answered your question, What do you have this military for?\n\nAlbright\n\nNo. He never did. I must say I would have asked him the same question as Secretary of State: What are you saving your political capital for?\n\nRiley\n\nCould you go through person by person? We’ve begun doing this already with Powell, but with each of the members of the foreign policy team? I’m using that term deliberately and certainly stand to be corrected if team is not the right term here. But tell us a little bit about what the President saw in each of these people, what he or she would bring to the table in terms of the development of foreign policy. I know this is complicated, because people start developing attachments to where they’re sitting. But it’s also the case that people have different skill sets; they have different sets of visions. We’d be interested in knowing how these pieces of the puzzle fit together.\n\nAlbright\n\nI think that they evolve as Clinton gets more and more into being the President and develops some of his own views. But I think somebody who was key on the team was Vice President Gore, who I think was, is, a truly knowledgeable person on a lot of issues. He was somebody who had been a Senator and had been very involved in arms control issues and obviously had voted in what was viewed as the right way on the Iraq war by then. I think Vice President Gore is a really serious student and a very smart man. So he was, I think, the key member. The President really looked to him for a lot of things. When we talked about Bosnia or whatever, there’s no question about that. Gore was very much a partner in all of it. He was not in the principals meetings—the person who was there was his National Security assistant, Leon Fuerth. At that stage I don’t think he was written into the system, but he was in every one of the meetings. Because the Vice President was so respectful of Leon, the President also was.\n\nIt was very interesting. Leon is a peculiar human being. He’s exceptionally smart and also somebody who is very interesting in meetings. Either because he’s really like this or he knows it’s a good act, he sits there for a long time and says, I want to say something. Then he waits, and you wait. So there’s much more a sense of arrival and anticipation. He thinks in very interesting ways. He began to be absolutely key on issues to do with sanctions because he had done a big study of all the various roles of sanctions. The President liked Leon. Leon wouldn’t often talk, and then the President would call on him. So he had an interesting role to play.\n\nThen Tony, the National Security Advisor—when you go into the meeting with the President, the National Security Advisor is the President’s staffer. He runs the meetings; he sets them up and provides a framework for them. So Tony obviously played a very important role in creating the framework and then calling on people to speak. The President listened to Tony, there’s no question. I don’t know what happened behind the scenes.\n\nLes Aspin, at the beginning—Les also was a really smart guy, but he was a former member of Congress. I don’t think he had an easy time adjusting to the job of an executive, to run a department. I think Bill Perry, as his Deputy, did a lot of hard work on it. People thought that Les was a little—it must have been the same feeling that Brzezinski had about Muskie, something about a former Congressman in this context is different, not being hard-headed enough about decisions, asking more questions—I think people didn’t know what to do with him. At the same time, as I said, Woolsey was on his case all the time, so that dynamic was interesting.\n\nThe dynamic also that ended up being interesting was the Sandy-Tony dynamic. I think, don’t know, you’ve had Sandy here, right?\n\nRiley\n\nYes.\n\nAlbright\n\nHave you ever asked him—this is confidential—but anyway, I think that Sandy very soon began to regret his decision, because Tony did not treat him with enough respect. At later stages Sandy and I talked about the fact that I thought Tony always looked at his watch when I started speaking. He said, You think you felt that way, I certainly felt that way. So I was not the only one that had this reaction to Tony. But Sandy, ultimately, if you were to talk to Warren Christopher, he would say that Sandy made the system work then through the deputies committee. Christopher and Tony did not get along.\n\nChristopher, who seems like a very quiet soul, actually can get his back up pretty much. I think he felt that Tony didn’t treat him with the proper respect, that he didn’t always have the access he wanted to the President. I don’t know if he did night notes or not. But Christopher is such an incredible gentleman. You could tell when he’d get mad, and later, as he and I have talked, I think he felt that Tony was very controlling. Had it not been for Sandy, there would not have been any possibility at all for really operating. So there really was the system, the teamwork through the deputies as much as anything.\n\nRiley\n\nYour experience with National Security Advisors apart from Lake tells you that it’s not—the National Security Advisor doesn’t have to behave that way. It’s not an institutional necessity that a National Security Advisor be controlling and—\n\nAlbright\n\nI think the truth is he doesn’t, or she doesn’t. It’s a fascinating job and a fascinating relationship. It all depends on the President. The President can have whatever he wants. I would say, if I were to write a psychobabble book about National Security Advisors, they react against what their predecessors did, to a great extent. I think [Henry] Kissinger is the prototype National Security Advisor.\n\nWhat he did was set up a system that he ran totally. The NSC at that stage had six committees that operated and he was chairman of all of them. He really intellectually dominated everybody. As I said, the rumors were that he had a terrible temper. I know this for a fact, that when the Carter people came in, they deliberately didn’t want to have an NSC like Kissinger’s. But Kissinger and Brzezinski have always had a competitive relationship from when they were at Harvard, or whatever they do. You could write a book about that.\n\nEven though Carter said he didn’t want to have a National Security Advisor like that, Brzezinski was damned if he wasn’t going to be the world’s greatest National Security Advisor. So he, through the system that was set up, was really the brains of the operation. Vance played into it in some ways. If you go back and look at that period, Vance would come out of meetings and never really discuss substance. It was all about process. The truth is the National Security Advisor should be behind the scenes.\n\nBut Vance was not really good on Meet the Press or whatever and Brzezinski speaks in perfect paragraphs and never uses a word wrong. So he started taking over more and more of the media role. The question became later, should the National Security Advisor ever be on television? During the Carter administration it was evident that Zbig was doing more and more. Senator [Edward] Zorinsky of Nebraska offered an amendment to get the National Security Advisor to be confirmed, which was anathema, obviously, to the State Department. Zbig thought it was great.\n\nI think in many ways, the ideal National Security Advisor was Brent Scowcroft, who was somebody who felt great confidence and had a close relationship with President Bush. Scowcroft has an ego, but it’s not his controlling factor. He was really an honest broker, ran a system that seemed to work, and was not out there all the time. So the question was what Clinton’s National Security Advisors would look like.\n\nTo some extent, I think the President didn’t ask Tony to stay for a second term, so you know something about the system wasn’t quite the way he liked it. I think Sandy was some mixture of these things. He clearly was smart; he was really fair in principals meetings. People say there were disagreements. Of course there have to be disagreements. That’s what the system is based on. If every Secretary says the same thing, then you’re not getting a range of advice.\n\nI always described principals meetings as the National Security Advisor has to make sure that the eggs are broken and then make an omelet out of them. You have to elicit views from all the people, and you have to have a meeting in which there’s not personal animosity but you’re called on, you state the position of your department and then you have an open discussion. If you can’t agree, then it goes to the President, but what you’re trying to do is get agreement.\n\nA National Security Advisor, a good one, is somebody who is good at eliciting the views, making people feel comfortable in stating them, not making them think that they’ve talked too long and allowing some back-channel stuff, obviously at various times. The only problem with Sandy was that he did go operational a number of times. Again, we did argue about this because this was mostly on the Middle East. I went in there and said, You can’t do this. He said, But Brzezinski went to China. I said, You’re not Brzezinski, and I’m certainly not Vance.\n\nThe job of National Security Advisor kept getting bigger and bigger. This has something to do with, as I said earlier, the White House. I think if you talk to any Cabinet Secretary now, they begin to feel that the White House is into too many things.\n\nFor instance, my business partner—Carol Browner, who was head of the Environmental Protection Agency, she had problems. You know she had worked for Al Gore. There were real questions about how the White House controlled them, or HHS, whatever the department. There was a sense that the White House, the inner White House, keeps growing, trying to control more and more of everything that goes on in the executive branch. So Sandy would—if I go back and I see what the mistakes were on Camp David, a lot of them were that the White House kept agitating. So that’s it.\n\nRiley\n\nOkay, thanks.\n\nChidester\n\nYou said that President Clinton began to develop his own foreign policy vision as the first term progressed. Can you tell us some of the other competing strategies going on within the foreign policy team?\n\nAlbright\n\nI think the real question was the same old question, which is how you use force and what America’s obligations are. And Somalia, we can talk about that. There were several things going on simultaneously. We had the problem of Bosnia. Somalia had started out as a humanitarian mission and was started during the transition. I think probably, I don’t know enough about this story, but the decisions made by Brent Scowcroft, particularly to go into Somalia, how much consultation he actually had with the Clinton people. I was doing process; I wasn’t doing that issue as much, but it’s a real decision for someone to launch a big thing like that in the middle of a transition.\n\nThen obviously that mission changed. There was a question about what resources one would use for that. Then there was Haiti. Haiti was a very imminent thing because migrants were coming by boat and raft toward our shores. Also, I have always thought this was very interesting—there’s a connection between the Mariel boat lift and the Haiti people and Clinton. What happened was when Carter had said in 1979, You all come and the Mariel boatlift started, a lot of Haitians who came were picked up and sent into Arkansas. They were at whatever fort—\n\nRiley\n\nFort Chaffee.\n\nAlbright\n\nWere there, and overran the place, and Clinton lost his Governorship over that as much as anything. So he was very sensitive to what was happening when the Haitians started coming in on rafts and how that whole situation should be handled. So to go back—we were out of the Cold War. There were real questions about the size of the defense budget. There were issues about how to get some control over the deficit. There was the fact that it’s the economy, stupid. There was the weird relationship with the military over the gay issue. There was Colin Powell, who was viewed, as I said, as the hero of the western world. There were all these new issues on the table, plus 12 years of a Republican Presidency.\n\nSo there were a lot of different things going on, and some of them had to do with the larger issues about the role of the United States. My sense always was that Clinton was somebody who saw a large role for the United States in a kind of principled way, but when it came to trying to figure out what the steps were, he knew, we all began to realize—the difference frankly between being an academic and being a policy maker is you all of a sudden have to put your money where your mouth is.\n\nMoving a process forward is so much harder than anybody thinks. The competing issues were money, budget issues, and the fact that nobody has a military except the Defense Department, and how you deploy that force. Who gives the orders? How do you operate within a peacekeeping operation?\n\nChidester\n\nYou touched on this when you said America’s role in the world, more broadly. This is what I was trying to get at. With Reagan you knew exactly where the administration stood as far as strategy. With Bush Senior, he always suffered from this so-called vision thing. As basically the first post-Cold War Presidency, you could go any number of ways; that was the broader question I was getting at. You can go with enlargement. You can go with this or that. I’m wondering, what ways did different top-level foreign policy members push President Clinton if he doesn’t have this—\n\nAlbright\n\nI think he did have a vision. We did a lot of kidding about enlargement not being a great word. So integration, globalization. I came up with something that he liked, which had to do with the fact that when I came to the UN, there were 183 countries. Being a professor, I had to get an intellectual construct for what I was seeing. I decided in my head that I would divide the countries into four general groups. The largest was countries that believed in an international system of some kind, negotiated treaties, lived up to them, had diplomatic relations, believed in alliances, etc. That was the largest group. While we didn’t necessarily agree with everything everybody did, we agreed that there ought to be a system.\n\nThe second group was of the newly democratic countries that wanted to be part of the first group but didn’t have the infrastructure yet to be a part of it. The third group we called the rogues until we got more polite and started calling them states of concern. They had the opposite view. They wanted to destroy the system. They had no stake in it. The fourth group were the basket cases, the countries that had no infrastructure literally and figuratively. The point of what we were trying to do was to strengthen the first group, which is why you have NATO enlargement and the War Crimes Tribunal, and negotiation on arms control treaties and strengthening an international system.\n\nThe second group we decided we needed to help, so there were plans to help in democracy development, economic development. The third group, the"
