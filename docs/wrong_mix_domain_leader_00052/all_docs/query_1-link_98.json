        "text": "Page 22 →Two The Constraints and Opportunities of Coalition Foreign Policy Moving beyond the Dichotomy\n\n61 For a four-party coalition, Bishop’s government was surprisingly successful at engaging in a variety of high-commitment behaviors in the international arena. Indeed, these behaviors required strong verbal assurances from the government as well as the substantial use of the country’s material resources.\n\nPage 23 →Halfway across the globe, the foreign policy prospects were not as bright for another four-party coalition. The 2017 parliamentary elections in the Netherlands produced a highly fragmented legislature of thirteen political parties without a single party assuming a majority.62 The incumbent People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) had won the largest number of seats, but nonetheless ended up forming a coalition with three other parties from diverse ends of the political spectrum: the liberal Democrats 66 (D66) alongside the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and Christian Union (CU). Analysts commented on the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte’s delicate balancing act in his new government, asking how he could “hold together a razor thin majority at home while maximizing the country’s influence on the international stage.”63 And there it was: another four-party coalition, but with a much bleaker prospect of high-caliber, assertive foreign policy.\n\nClearly, multiparty governments vary in their ability to act abroad. Although “disunity and paralysis”64 are not necessarily the only outcomes in coalition foreign policy as it has been recently observed in Australia, not every coalition—certainly not Rutte’s—performs similarly. What explains this variation? Why are some coalitions able to assert themselves in the international arena while others fail to do so? Why is it easier for some coalitions to project their countries’ presence abroad through signing trade agreements, forging stronger diplomatic relationships, or sending foreign aid? Why is it more difficult for other coalitions to act with such commitment in foreign affairs? These are important questions for both the scholars and practitioners of foreign policy. Answering them should not only shed greater light on the academic debate on the relationship between domestic politics and international outcomes, but also help analysts and policymakers toward making more informed observations and decisions when dealing with coalition governments in the international arena.\n\nTo answer these questions, this book focuses on the politics of coalition governance by taking political parties as its key constitutive unit. The debate takes two forms among those interested in explaining the policymaking dynamics of coalitions. The first focuses on the constraints that coalitions impose on the decision makers. Having too many political parties in government increases the amount of deliberations necessary to finalize a policy decision and even runs the risk of deadlock when an Page 24 →agreement cannot be reached. As a result, coalitions are often considered cumbersome, prone to stalemate and political crisis.\n\nThe flip side of this debate focuses on the opportunities that coalition governments present to the decision makers, specifically, decreased levels of accountability for the parties that participate in the government. Voters have the easiest time identifying who is to blame when a single party is in charge: if they are not happy with the government’s policies, they simply cast their vote for another party at the next election. Coalition governments, by way of having several political parties in the decision-making process, thwart this process. As coalitions make it more difficult for voters to hold parties responsible come election time, these governments lead to lower levels of ex post accountability. The effect is greater leeway for the decision makers: if at the end of the day voters are unable to assign blame to them, the parties in government will enjoy lower barriers against acting in costly and risky ways that would have otherwise jeopardized their electoral prospects. These include behaviors in the international domain, where voters might already have weaker incentives and fewer resources to monitor their government’s activities.\n\nThe international relations literature mirrors this debate by focusing predominantly on the dichotomy between single-party and multiparty governments and the constraints generated by each to explain why parliamentary democracies behave the way they do abroad. It has failed, however, to systematically account for the variation that exists within coalitions. We can identify this variation along two dimensions. First, from a structural standpoint, coalitions vary based on the individual contributions of each party to the coalition’s parliamentary size. Second, from a situational standpoint, they vary based on the ideological heterogeneity introduced by the governing parties.65 Furthermore, minority coalitions constitute a special case of multiparty governments that researchers have yet to investigate in the foreign policy domain. Although these coalitions are structurally constrained vis-à-vis the opposition given their seat share in the parliament, they might enjoy situational opportunities to make commitments in foreign policy if they prevent the materialization of a credible policy challenge from the opposition parties in the parliament.\n\nThree competing theories in the study of coalitions frame and elucidate this discussion. While the veto players theory highlights the constraints coalitions have to endure to make policy and act on it, the clarity of responsibility theory suggests that coalitions may enjoy greater freedom to embark upon costly policies since retrospective voter accountability is compromised as a Page 25 →result of responsibility diffusion in the government. The policy viability and fragmented opposition explanations complement these theories by shedding more light on the policymaking capabilities of minority coalitions. As a result, identifying the structural and situational variation among coalitions provides a more thorough treatment of these theories and generates new hypotheses that highlight the different directions in which coalitions can influence the international commitments of parliamentary regimes.\n\nIn this chapter, I drive this point home. I introduce greater nuance to how we treat the explanatory power of these competing theories in order to explicate coalition foreign policy. In so doing, I argue that the ability of coalition governments to engage in international commitments depends on three key factors: the type of the coalition, which is captured by the individual contribution of each party in the coalition to the government’s parliamentary strength; the degree of ideological cohesion inside the coalition; and the coalition’s interaction with the parliamentary opposition, especially when it does not enjoy legislative majority. In what follows, I first provide an overview of the existing debates and then discuss how we can improve their findings through a more careful analysis of how coalition governments are organized. Next, I develop a series of hypotheses to test my coalition politics framework of foreign policy. I conclude with a discussion of some key alternative explanations that could further influence the commitment behavior of parliamentary democracies.\n\nConstraining or Enabling? How Coalitions Influence Foreign Policy\n\nCoalition politics began receiving greater attention from international relations scholars when the empirical debate over the democratic peace theory evolved into an investigation of the differences in the foreign policy behavior of democracies, often construed in terms of interstate conflict. Several studies in this research program have focused on the structure of the executive branch as a key source of domestic-institutional variation, asking whether it constrains or enables the regime’s ability to engage in belligerence abroad.\n\nSome in this debate argue that coalitions are more constrained in foreign policy than single-party governments and therefore decrease the likelihood of conflict behavior, because the presence of multiple parties involved in decision making creates higher barriers against acting abroad.66 Page 26 →In effect, coalition governments make “middle-of-the-road” foreign policies, suggesting more moderate behavior than one would expect under a single-party government.67 In this vein, Maoz and Russett expect coalitions to be more peaceful abroad than single-party governments; similarly, Leblang and Chan hypothesize that single-party governments have a greater tendency for war involvement than do coalitions.68 Testing for a series of alternative hypotheses, Palmer and his coauthors claim that single-party governments are more heavily involved in international disputes since they are harder to remove from power than are coalitions.69\n\nOthers reject these expectations, arguing that coalitions in fact enjoy greater room for costly and risky policies, including war involvement. From a comparative politics standpoint, Strøm claims that single-party governments face greater constraints against policymaking than do coalitions since it is easier for opposition forces to organize an effective challenge to a single party than to a government of multiple parties.70 Brandon Prins and Christopher Sprecher invoke retrospective accountability as a key explanation to probe into the international behavior of coalitions. They argue that “with coalition governments, the voting public may be less able to attach responsibility to any one party for policy failures,” which might encourage these governments to “be more willing to reciprocate militarized disputes.”71 Following a similar vein, Palmer and coauthors expect that once involved, single-party governments will be more constrained domestically and therefore less likely to escalate their international disputes than will coalitions.72\n\nBased on these studies, it is difficult to conclude what the precise effect of coalitions is on foreign policy. Some find that larger coalitions are more likely to be involved in international disputes than single-party governments.73 Others detect no relationship between conflict initiation and the number of parties in government, suggesting that single-party governments are not significantly different than coalitions.74 Leblang and Chan Page 27 →have argued that single-party governments enjoy more political certainty and security than their multiparty counterparts and, as a result, should be more likely get involved in wars. They found out, however, that this broad distinction did not explain war involvement, indeed a prime example of high-commitment behavior that requires not just strong speech acts that communicate resolve but also the use of substantial material capabilities.75\n\nA more recent wave of research has gone beyond international conflict and incorporated events data to identify how exactly coalition governance influences foreign policy.76 In a series of contributions, Juliet Kaarbo and Ryan Beasley test whether the number of parties in government and its parliamentary seat share influence international behavior in democratic regimes.77 Contrary to the findings of previous studies, they conclude that coalitions act more extreme, or, in other words, with greater commitment, when they control slimmer majorities in the parliament. The authors find that coalitions also act more conflictually when more parties participate in the government.78 Coalitions “are prone to deadlock and delay. But they also show signs of good decision,” Kaarbo argues, suggesting that there is no conclusive evidence for the constrained nature of coalitions in foreign policy.79\n\nTo be sure, not all studies simply count parties and parliamentary seats to explain coalition behavior. Many foreign policy analysts treat coalition governments as distinct decision units, whose policymaking processes deserve closer and more substantive attention. According to that body of work, coalitions are defined first and foremost by their key decision rule, namely, that they lack an actor “which by itself has the ability to decide and force compliance on the others.”80 If coalitions have to make decisions collectively given this rule, then the natural next step is to investigate which factors about this unit facilitate or endanger collective decision making.\n\nHagan and his colleagues emphasize the party-political nature of coalitions to find out. They ask “what conditions lead often contending actors Page 28 →to achieve agreement on foreign policy.”81 The answers they propose borrow substantially from some of the classic work in political science on coalition theory, including the ideological distance between and preference distribution among the parties that make up the coalition, their willingness to engage in quid pro quo and clip together each other’s policy interests, and whether their national political contexts encourage consensus over competition among the decision makers.82 Several qualitative case studies have utilized the decision units framework to scrutinize how policymaking and implementation takes place in coalitions.83 But they fall short of a systematic identification and analysis of the elements that shape coalition governance and how these affect the coalitions’ ability to engage in foreign policy. As a result, the party-political factors that influence coalition foreign policy remain undertheorized.\n\nEssentially, then, there is a disconnect in the literature on coalition politics and foreign policy. Coalitions are either quantified using simple measures such as the number of parties and the government’s parliamentary seat share, which has led to an array of disjointed findings, or they are dissected qualitatively to the point where their systematic analysis is either not feasible or not conducive to rigorous theorizing and empirical testing. Further, the quantitative literature has primarily focused on whether coalitions categorically constrain or enable policymakers’ ability to act assertively abroad (and this outcome of choice is usually operationalized as conflict involvement). The fact that there is structural and situational variation among coalitions, which alters the extent to which they introduce constraints or opportunities to the decision makers, has largely been overlooked.\n\nTaking a party-level approach to conceptualizing coalition governance makes it possible to identify these structural and situational sources of variation. Indeed, if we are to make competing claims on the impact of coalitions on foreign policy behavior, then the justification for these claims has to be embedded in the ways in which coalitions are structured domestically, as the “decision units” literature has proposed. That said, any systematic analysis of this phenomenon needs more nuanced theorizing and careful Page 29 →identification of the key variables. This is where turning to the veto players and clarity of responsibility theories as competing explanations becomes useful for addressing these issues.\n\nContending Approaches to Theorizing Coalition Foreign Policy\n\nThe debate over whether coalitions engage in more or less assertive, or extreme, international behavior, including involvement in conflict, than single-party governments can be resolved only if we start by acknowledging that a categorical understanding of coalitions overlooks the variation within them. The existing theories on coalition politics, retrospective voting, and executive-legislative relations help us capture those variations.\n\nThe argument that coalitions curtail foreign policy decision making, produce less effective outputs, and ultimately decrease the likelihood of assertive foreign policy behavior echoes the logic of veto players. Veto players are defined as “individual or collective actors whose agreement is necessary for a change of the status quo.”84 Echoing precisely the decision units approach in the literature, government by coalition according to this theory implies the presence of multiple veto players, all of whom must agree to make policy decisions and implement them.85 Increasing the number of parties in a government increases the number of veto players, making it more difficult to reach any decision, especially those decisions that signal commitments, which require the deployment of significant political and material resources.\n\nEmpirical tests of the veto players theory suggest that the government’s ability to move away from the status quo is obstructed as the number of veto players increases. Nouriel Roubini and Jeffrey Sachs, for instance, show that having multiple parties in government acts as a barrier against decreasing budget deficits.86 George Tsebelis, the political scientist who developed the veto players model, finds that the likelihood of producing labor law decreases when the number of veto players increases among European governments.87 Invoking the same argument, Franzese concludes that the probability of introducing changes to budgetary policy decreases when the government is a coalition.88 These findings resonate Page 30 →in the foreign policy domain. Coalitions are expected to constrain decision making because the veto players in government resist changing the existing policy. An implication of the veto players argument is that it leads to foreign policies that are diluted so as not to provoke any government partners or significantly challenge their preferences.\n\nWhat is crucial to note, however, is that the veto players model goes beyond the number of veto players to assess the likelihood of policy change. It expects that the stalling effect of veto players on policy may be conditioned by two additional factors. These include, first, whether there is preference homogeneity among the veto players, that is, whether these actors share similar preferences to facilitate any change in policy, and second, whether the veto players actually have the incentive to use their veto power to prevent such a change.89 Indeed, in his study of labor law, Tsebelis demonstrates that the ideological heterogeneity of a coalition further impedes policy change; coalitions with a wider ideological range are much more constrained in producing laws compared to their ideologically more compact counterparts. Similarly, others have argued that economic growth rates and the ability to manage healthcare costs in democracies are negatively affected by the limitations exerted by both the size of the government and the distribution of political preferences inside it.90\n\nTherefore, the veto players approach concludes that coalitions might be more constrained in policymaking than single-party governments, but with the caveat that this expectation requires further qualification. Specifically, the presence of multiple political parties in government, the extent to which they have incentives to use their veto power, and the degree of ideological heterogeneity among them together condition their ability to make policy, including foreign policy. This argument aligns closely with the “decision units” approach as I introduced above. But it is fundamentally more nuanced than the existing quantitative treatment of coalitions in the international relations literature, which focuses predominantly on the first condition, namely, that the government includes multiple political parties, all of which are considered veto players and expected to stall decision making. Therefore, we need to take a closer look at coalitions and their precise composition in order to qualify the veto-oriented argument that they constrain the commitment behavior of parliamentary democracies.\n\nPage 31 →There is still another side to this debate. Contrary to the veto players logic, the clarity of responsibility theory predicts an opposite effect for coalition governments on policymaking.91 Researchers have argued that in proportional representation systems with coalition governments, if voters cast their votes based on the parties’ past performance (i.e., retrospective voting) rather than on their expected future performance, their evaluations will be “compromised because the lines of responsibility will be blurred [for the coalition parties].”92 In other words, when policy is made by a body of multiple parties, it gets more difficult for voters to identify which party should be held responsible for it. Quantitative tests of this theory have shown that “when clarity of responsibility is obscured and when the level of responsibility is low, governing parties are less affected by how citizens evaluate the nation’s economy.”93 More recent studies look at the growth of the public sector and corruption levels to argue that increasing the number of parties in government leads to larger public sectors and higher levels of corruption, respectively, which supports this theory.94\n\nThese studies all point to a decisional environment where accountability is compromised, concluding that governments that are less likely to be held accountable will enjoy greater room to pursue policies without fearing an electoral backlash. Therefore, they suggest the opposite of what was proposed by the veto players approach: coalitions suffer from less scrutiny than do single-party governments and thus can make riskier and more costly foreign policies that do not have to be moderate, and, should they fail, the electoral punishment will not be too high.95 For this reason, some researchers claim that single-party governments are more constrained and cautious than coalitions “because they are reluctant to invite domestic political challenge, perhaps to the point of forcing an election.”96 According to this logic, then, we should expect coalition governments to circumvent the domestic costs of their policies, including foreign policy, more effectively than single-party governments. They should act with greater Page 32 →assertiveness in international affairs, making more forceful statements, taking more risks, and spending greater resources.\n\nThe preceding discussion on the veto players theory, however, gives us reasons to consider that the variation within coalition governments should also affect the degree of responsibility diffusion, and, as a result, influence their policy behavior. Coalitions might well engage in more committed foreign policy endeavors knowing that they could overcome the electoral risks associated with such policies at the ballot box. This argument assumes two additional conditions, however. First, it assumes that the coalition is big enough to obscure responsibility and diminish the voters’ ability to hold them accountable. Second and equally important, it assumes that these parties are already in agreement to make the foreign policy commitment, suggesting that the governing parties enjoy some degree of preference homogeneity. We have yet to learn what happens to the explanatory power of the clarity thesis when we relax these assumptions. Do some coalitions engage in more assertive commitments because they are big enough to diffuse responsibility effectively? And even when the coalition is big enough, do we still observe committed behavior if it is also burdened by the incompatible policy positions of its constituent parties? Only when we unpack coalitions can we address these questions effectively.\n\nThis is precisely why we should dig deeper into the specific composition of coalitions to test the expectations of these two competing theories on foreign policy commitments. Explicating coalitions along the size dimension allows us to tease out the structural variation among them and identify which types of coalitions maximize the governing parties’ incentives to utilize their veto power. To the extent that veto incentives are distributed differently across different types of coalitions, the explanatory power of the veto players thesis on foreign policy commitments should vary. Similarly, the coalition’s ability to diffuse responsibility for its constituent parties should vary with its size. Dissecting coalition governments along the ideology dimension explicates the situational variation among coalitions by capturing the degree of cohesiveness between the governing parties. Are the barriers against assertive foreign policy behavior higher for coalitions with greater ideological diversity? And does ideological dispersion inside some coalitions decrease their ability to act abroad, which they would have otherwise done due to responsibility diffusion and the opportunity to avoid electoral blame that comes with it? The discussion I have presented so far suggests for both theoretical perspectives that the degree of ideological cohesiveness inside the coalition should condition the effect of its structure on foreign policy behavior.\n\nPage 33 →A final assumption in this debate concerns the majority status of the coalition in the parliament. Both the veto players and clarity of responsibility theories share this assumption. The constraints or opportunities these theories focus on have to do with the dynamics taking place inside the coalition: the governing parties can utilize their veto power to stall, water down, or block decisions, or they enjoy diffusion of responsibility vis-à-vis the electorate and make more assertive commitments abroad. Since the parliamentary opposition does not present an impediment for these governments, their policymaking processes are influenced by what takes place inside them.\n\nConstraints and opportunities take on an entirely different meaning for minority coalitions, however, because their existence hinges on their relationship with the parliamentary opposition holding the majority. Indeed, according to many, this key structural weakness leaves them at the “mercy of the legislature,”97 constrains policymaking, and translates into “moderate policy.”98 As a result, the dynamics between the government and the parliament become as important as those taking place inside the coalition. How does the intensity of foreign policy commitments change when the government now has to consider both the executive and legislative contexts? Minority coalitions constitute a unique type of multiparty government that raises this question. Their ability to commit in foreign affairs should be influenced not only by the degree of ideological heterogeneity among the governing parties, but, as I explain further below, also by how they interact with the parliamentary opposition.\n\nThe veto players and clarity of responsibility theories therefore provide useful explanatory approaches to further theorize coalition foreign policy. They ensure the development of more refined hypotheses, but they should be further complemented by other theories that consider coalitions lacking parliamentary support. Unpacking coalition governments along the dimensions of size and ideological heterogeneity provides a more thorough assessment of both of these theories. It also highlights where these theories fall short, especially when it comes to explaining the foreign policies of minority coalitions. To address that gap, we need to consider a third dimension, namely, their relationship with the parliamentary opposition. In the next section, I provide a discussion of these dimensions to develop my hypotheses.\n\nPage 34 →The Missing Link: The Type of Coalition, Its Ideological Cohesiveness, and Relations with the Parliament\n\nHow can we identify the structural variation within coalitions to assess their foreign policy behavior? The preceding review demonstrated that two alternatives exist, namely, the number of parties in the government and its total parliamentary seat share. Researchers use these formulations to measure the size and the strength of the coalition: larger coalitions include more parties and stronger coalitions enjoy greater seat shares in the legislature. But are these measures sensitive enough for capturing the variation within coalitions in order to test the constraining and enabling effects of these governments on international commitments?\n\nLet us consider the following example to answer this question. The Dutch Labor Party (PvdA) won the parliamentary elections in 1994 with the largest number of seats in the parliament. Having failed to secure a single-party majority, however, the PvdA brought together two other parties, the Liberal Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the Democrats 66 (D66) to form a coalition government. When the party got re-elected in 1998, but once again with only a plurality of seats in the parliament, Prime Minister Willem “Wim” Kok decided to form the incoming coalition with his old partners VVD and D66. Table 2.1 shows that the three parties captured nearly the same combined percentage of seats in the 1998 elections as they did in 1994.\n\nIs there anything fundamentally different between these two governments? Not really, according to the existing foreign policy literature. If we measure the size and strength of these coalitions by following the previous works, we will find no difference. They have the same number of parties, and collectively, they enjoy almost identical seat shares in the parliament. In quantitative studies, we would assign the same values to these governments, coding them as majority governments, majority coalitions, or as governments with three parties.\n\nTable 2.1. Why Coalition Types Matter: Counting the Parties and Seat Shares\n\nParties in Government (%)\n\nDutch Tweede Kamer (150 seats)\n\nPvdA\n\nVVD\n\nD66\n\nTotal Seat Share\n\nCoalition I: Wim Kok (1994–1998)\n\n24\n\n20\n\n15.5\n\n59.5\n\nCoalition II: Wim Kok (1999–2002)\n\n29\n\n24.7\n\n9\n\n62.7\n\nSource: European Election Database.\n\nPage 35 →In reality, however, these coalitions are significantly different from each other. What is the source of this difference? Let us look at how each party contributes to the government’s stability in the parliament to find out. In Coalition I, all three parties are necessary to maintain the coalition’s parliamentary majority. Given their individual seat shares, the PvdA needs both the VVD and D66 to keep the majority intact: if either of these parties decides to leave, the government would lose its parliamentary advantage and be exposed to instability. Coalition II is different: although it includes the same number of parties and controls almost the same percentage of seats, not every party in this government enjoys the same degree of indispensability. In the early 1990s, the D66 controlled 16 of the nearly 60 percent of the government seats in parliament and had the power to bring the coalition down on its own by leaving it. By 1999, however, the party had become superfluous, contributing seats to a coalition that had already cleared the parliamentary majority threshold without the D66. As far as the government’s stability is concerned, the PvdA-VVD coalition could do just as well in the parliament without the D66 given its combined seat share. That was, of course, bad news for D66: it had lost its bargaining power, or what some foreign policy scholars call its “blackmail potential,” to influence the government’s decision-making process99 in the second Kok government.\n\nThe example in table 2.1 shows that neither the number of parties nor the parliamentary seat share of the coalition constitutes sensitive enough measures to identify the variation between these coalitions, because they overlook how each political party in the coalition contributes simultaneously to its size and strength. This is an important aspect of coalitions that has a direct influence on their policymaking capability. Indeed, the government’s parliamentary seat share is a weak measure particularly under proportional representation systems (PR), where parties are more disciplined, cohesive, and act as blocs.100 To be sure, this is not just the case in the Netherlands. We also know from Denmark, a country under PR, that “all coalitions are based on the understanding that . . . party cohesion is generally very high.”101 An individual-based measure such as the government’s seat share is thus inadequate to capture its legislative strength if Page 36 →the members of the parliament (MPs) belonging to the same party are expected to vote in the same direction or to defect and leave the government as a bloc. Counting the MPs to measure the coalition’s strength, say, toward voting for an overseas military operation is irrelevant if we know that party discipline will compel all the MPs from the same party to reject or support the proposal.\n\nThe governments of Wim Kok illustrate, though, that counting the number of parties is not necessarily more helpful either. For one, it does not always tell us whether the coalition is a majority government or not. Coalitions can have anywhere between two (e.g., Ireland) or seven (observed often in Italy) parties and still lack a parliamentary majority. A party-count approach to measuring coalition size assumes that more is bigger and stronger, but many contradictory cases also exist. More importantly, counting the parties washes away the bargaining power that D66 had in Coalition I but lacked in Coalition II. Thus, a more sophisticated way of conceptualizing coalitions is necessary to capture their size and strength simultaneously, as well as to identify whether they can survive defections (in other words, highlighting the parties’ uneven incentives to use a veto). Identifying coalitions based on how the governing parties contribute to their overall strength and stability is far more useful for capturing these nuances.\n\nThe literature on coalition politics provides us with a well-established typology to accomplish just that. Coalitions that are minimalist, or minimum-winning, include just enough number of parties to clear the majority threshold in the parliament, but not more. In effect, minimum-winning coalitions provide each governing party with the power to obstruct decision making and bring the government down. Oversized or surplus coalitions, on the other hand, have at least one extra party that is not necessary to maintain the majority.102 Minority coalitions include multiple parties but cannot attain a parliamentary majority at all.\n\nThis typology is useful for a number of reasons. First, it conceptualizes coalitions to capture precisely the variation I have been emphasizing so far. It considers not just the multiparty status of these governments but also how much each party contributes to their strength and stability. Second, it brings the foreign policy research on coalitions closer to the existing work on the domestic politics and processes of multiparty governance in political science, where this typology remains the gold standard. Foreign Page 37 →policy scholars increasingly emphasize that “the main difference is between coalitions with the minimal number of parties required for a parliamentary majority (‘minimal winning’) and those with either too few (‘undersized cabinets’) or more (‘oversized coalitions’) members than are necessary,” referring to classic work by Riker and Dodd.103 It is time to put that difference to test. Third and most importantly, this typology makes better theorizing possible.\n\nLet me revisit the veto players debate to show how. I pointed out earlier that this theory considers the government’s policymaking ability to be conditional not just on the number of veto players, but also on their incentives to utilize their veto power. The qualitative distinction between minimum-winning and oversized coalitions captures this variation in incentive distribution. According to both the veto players and the decision unit perspectives, every party in a coalition is a veto player. The coalition typology suggests, however, that some parties may lack veto power in certain types of coalitions. In a minimum-winning coalition any party can use its veto power and block proposals or pull the government to its own policy position by threatening to leave. This is a credible threat: if the party defects, the government loses its parliamentary majority, gets exposed to opposition challenge, and faces new elections. Given the potential damage it can incur on the government, every party in a minimum-winning coalition has incentives to use their veto power to influence policy. The incentive comes from the party’s ability to single-handedly bring the government down. We should therefore observe the veto players logic influencing the foreign policy process especially in minimum-winning coalitions, stalling decision making, and ultimately leading to weaker foreign policy commitments.\n\nThis may not be the case for oversized coalitions, however, which includes parties that cushion the government against defections but are not vital for maintaining the government’s majority status. Put differently, these parties are not true veto players since their rejection of government policy is not relevant for steering the policy process; the government would remain intact in the parliament and pursue those policies just as well without them.104 Therefore, the incentive to use veto power is distributed more unequally across parties in oversized coalitions than it is for minimum-winning coalitions. This should weaken the explanatory power of the veto Page 38 →players thesis in oversized coalitions. Why would the extra (or surplus) parties in oversized coalitions want to weaken their role in the government by opposing a policy proposal if such opposition really has no teeth? As we shall see in chapter 6, this was precisely the rationale that two surplus parties adopted in the run-up to Finland’s eurozone membership decision. This is also the reason why Israeli leaders constantly seek to add new partners to their coalitions. Doing so prevents the government from getting hijacked by the existing junior parties in the government and strengthens its parliamentary presence while appeasing the smaller parties by folding them into the executive branch.105\n\nInstead, a different consideration might be at play for oversized coalitions. These coalitions are larger than necessary by definition, which can make responsibility diffusion far easier and therefore create stronger opportunities for the governing parties to circumvent the electoral costs associated with their policy decisions. This brings us back to the clarity of responsibility logic. It encourages us to test whether diffusion promotes commitment behavior if there is a multiparty government, particularly when the government is bigger than necessary. To the extent that coalitions with more parties and a stronger legislative presence are more capable of diffusing responsibility than coalitions with fewer parties and weaker support in the parliament, oversized coalitions might enjoy weaker voter accountability and make more assertive commitments in foreign policy, which require greater use of the regime’s material and political resources. This mechanism would also help those surplus parties that might disagree with coalition policy but choose to go along with it: the diffusion of responsibility would allow them to overlook their voters’ preferences and align with the rest of the government. If this argument holds, then we should observe foreign policy behaviors to become more extreme, or elicit greater commitment, when the government is an oversized coalition that enjoys a strong and stable majority in the parliament.\n\nHow does the situational variation within coalitions—the degree of ideological diversity among their constituent parties—influence these relationships? We know that issues in foreign policy can be as ideologically contentious as those in domestic politics.106 So there is reason to expect that the ideological constellation of coalition parties can influence foreign policy considerations just as much as they do in the domestic policy domain.\n\nTo be sure, foreign policy scholars do not disregard the role of ideologyPage 39 → in decision making altogether. The decision unit researchers have argued that one key characteristic of coalitions concerns “the effects that each actor’s constituencies can have on the members of the decision unit.”107 Constituencies expect their governing parties to act in line with their positions already determined along the political spectrum. These positions constrain and guide the decision makers and are often conceptualized in the form of ideologies.108 Joe Hagan underscores the role that ideological differences among the coalition partners play on their policymaking capabilities. He suggests that “there is little long-term interest shared in sustaining the unsatisfactory compromise agreement of a multi-party coalition”109 if these parties are far from each other in the first place. When coalition parties come from diverse ideological backgrounds, we expect these differences to impede their willingness to govern together, let alone act assertively abroad.110 Koch sums it up nicely: ideological diversity “is the degree to which parties in government have similar or different ideological, or policy, preferences.”111\n\nExisting research shows that party ideology captured along the left-right spectrum provides a good proxy for understanding the parties’ foreign policy preferences across a host of issue areas, such as participation in military operations, foreign aid allocation, or support for diplomatic engagement over the use of force.112 So we can expect that when coalition Page 40 →parties are closer to each other on the ideological spectrum, they should enjoy greater preference homogeneity and therefore should be more likely to reach agreement on foreign policy, enabling them to act abroad. In an ideologically diverse coalition, the desire to commit the regime’s political and material resources to a foreign policy issue should be low, thus resulting in weaker commitments at the international arena.\n\nDoes the evidence support this expectation? Current research paints an incomplete picture. Many studies have thus far focused on how the government’s overall political orientation influences its international behavior.113 They find, for instance, that left-leaning governments elicit more dovish and peaceful behavior, whereas right-leaning governments act with greater hawkishness and belligerence.114 Others focus only on the relative positions of coalition partners to demonstrate how an outlier party may influence foreign policy outcomes. Kaarbo and more recently Coticchia and Davidson focus on the critical junior partner—the party that can bring down the government on its own—to assess how its position influences the coalition’s foreign policy choice.115 Joe Clare demonstrates that the probability of initiating international conflict is similar across coalitions and single-party governments when the former is more compact, which he measures by the presence or absence of an ideologically distant critical junior party in the coalition.116 Focusing on the parties’ relative positions could be misleading,117 however, and presents an incomplete assessment of how partisan discord affects policy outcomes. Any explanation that focuses on the critical junior partner becomes significantly more difficult to test empirically when the government includes several of these parties, and it fails to explain foreign policy choices altogether when the government is oversized and may lack a critical junior partner.\n\nPage 41 →Considering that a key factor in coalition politics and policymaking concerns the government’s degree of preference homogeneity, theorizing the role of ideology using the coalition’s overall ideological cohesiveness should better inform coalition foreign policy. As I explained earlier, the veto players approach to coalition foreign policy remains incomplete without incorporating the government’s overall ideological cohesiveness as a conditioning factor. The ideological positions of parties should matter the most in a minimum-winning setting where their veto incentives are the strongest. These coalitions are likely to end up in deadlock when ideological heterogeneity exists, possibly causing the government to dissolve, as illustrated by the 2010 episode over the deployment of Dutch troops to the mission in Afghanistan.118 Alternatively, the parties in these coalitions may choose the middle road and refrain from taking any assertive action abroad in order not to antagonize any coalition partner, as Elman contends.119 In so doing, they avoid putting the government’s survival at risk. The Dutch debate over the stationing of NATO’s cruise missiles introduced in chapter 1 is a good example. Since the governing parties at the time could not agree, they chose not to commit and instead postponed their decision for several years.\n\nSimilarly, I will examine whether those coalitions that enjoy responsibility diffusion and are therefore susceptible to making more assertive commitments abroad actually fail to do so when they suffer from ideological rifts inside. If the clarity of responsibility theory holds true as it stands, coalitions—especially oversized coalitions—must enjoy diffusion and survive the future electoral consequences of their international commitments regardless of the ideological differences inside them. If not, accounting for the degree of ideological disparity among coalition parties should reveal when diffusion gives way to discord, deadlock, and even dissolution. Examples from Israel are telling. An oversized coalition led by Yitzhak Shamir had been stuck in a deadlock for three weeks over the peace initiatives of 1989, suggesting that disagreement counteracts diffusion. Nearly two decades later, another oversized coalition, this time led by Ariel Sharon, was deadlocked over his 2004 proposal to dismantle the Jewish settlements in Gaza. The deep disagreements among the coalition parties led to their gradual departure over the next six months, ultimately leaving the senior party Likud alone.120 When the ideological differences among parties in oversized coalitions are hard to reconcile, these governments become even harder to maintain. This should further weaken their ability to act abroad.\n\nPage 42 →Then there is the minority coalition, the one that some political scientists disagree on how to best categorize. For some, they are “majority governments in disguise” since they receive outside support from opposition parties in the parliament.121 Arendt Lijphart doubles down on this viewpoint, suggesting that we should treat them as oversized coalitions.122 These scholars imply that the same explanations we use to identify policymaking in majority coalitions can be applied to minority coalitions. Empirically, this is hardly plausible. If minority coalitions truly resembled majority coalitions, let alone oversized coalitions, we would first expect them to be as durable. We know, however, that they are not. On average, majority governments last longer than minority governments.123 Conrad and Golder show that post–Cold War minority coalitions in central and eastern Europe last for only 364 days on average, whereas oversized coalitions live nearly twice as long (608 days).124 Others corroborate these findings and conclude that majority coalitions enjoy longer lifespans than minority coalitions.125 Instead, we should study them for what they are: multiparty governments that are also particularly vulnerable in the parliament.\n\nMinority coalitions are unique precisely because unlike minimum-winning and oversized coalitions, these governments exist as long as the parliamentary majority allows them to.126 Minority coalitions are structurally the weakest of all coalition types for this reason and face significant constraints against acting assertively abroad. As a result, we study their relations with the parliament far more closely than we study those of majority coalitions. But there is a catch here. Specifically, the placement of the opposition parties along the ideological spectrum now becomes important to assess the coalition’s policymaking capacity because the opposition outnumbersPage 43 → the coalition: if the opposition parties cannot come together to level an effective rebuttal against its policies, then the coalition will be in a much safer place politically.\n\nLuckily, political scientists have already provided us with leads to take this inquiry further. Writing more than two decades ago, Michael Laver and Ian Budge discussed this phenomenon by invoking the term “policy viability.” They argue that governments are policy-viable when their “policy position is such that there is no alternative executive coalition that can put forward a credible policy position that is preferred to the incumbents by a majority of legislators.”127 Simply put, if the government positions itself such that it prevents the formation of any alternative majority in the parliament, it will be safe. In the case of minority coalitions, the authors expect that governments that include the core party will not be defeated by the parliament.128 In subsequent work, Michael Laver and Norman Schofield extend this debate further. They argue that if governments can “divide the opposition by putting forward policy packages at the ‘centre’ [sic] of the policy space,” they should be able to obstruct “the opposition to agree on an alternative,” thereby “allowing the government to manage with much less than a majority.”129 As Rasch summarizes, “if minority governments are centrally located and the opposition divided ideologically or in policy terms, the government has more than one way of building majorities behind its proposals. If, however, the opposition is easily united and can confront the cabinet en bloc, effective policy-making virtually becomes impossible.”130 This explanation is also known in the literature as the positional agenda power theory.131\n\nAlong similar lines, Hagan has proposed a fragmented opposition explanation to shed light on the foreign policy making capacity of democracies. Hagan argues that “like the regime’s [strength] itself, strength of party opposition depends upon its internal cohesiveness. If a sizeable number of opposition seats are controlled by different parties, then it is less likely that they will be able (or even willing) to work together to mount an effective assault on the regime and its policies.”132 Minority coalitions—a special case Page 44 →of minority governments—provide a plausible setting where this kind of fragmentation is possible.\n\nThe question then becomes: How can the government ensure that the opposition seats belong to parties as far away from each other along the political spectrum as possible to diminish their ability to challenge? The answer lies in the composition of the government itself: To the extent that the ideological composition of the minority coalition leaves the opposition fragmented, the former will enjoy the room to govern, including in the foreign policy arena. The opposition parties, in this case, would lack the willingness to work together and confront the government.\n\nI build on these studies to argue that given the structural vulnerability of minority coalitions, their ability to act in foreign affairs depends primarily on whether they can prevent the formation of a credible parliamentary opposition. Assuming that parties on the same side of the political spectrum are more likely to work with each other with fewer frictions than with parties on the opposite side, the best course of action for a minority coalition would be to bite the bullet and introduce some ideological heterogeneity to its own ranks in order to prevent the natural formation of an ideologically unified majority opposition. Doing so requires a careful tailoring of the coalition itself, where incumbent parties reach across the proverbial aisle and govern with parties on the opposite side of the political spectrum. The conditioning impact of intragovernmental partisan discord on the foreign policy behavior of these coalitions should not be linear, then, precisely because the government’s ideological setup can obstruct the unity of the opposition. This is another reason why minority coalitions and their ideological composition should be investigated separately from other types of coalitions.\n\nFigure 2.1 provides a simplified illustration of my argument. Imagine five political parties occupying a parliament of 100 seats. Party A has 18 seats, B 21, C 20, D 23, and Party E has 18 seats. These parties are distributed along the left-right political spectrum such that Party A is at the far left, C is at the center, E is at the far right, and Parties B and D are in between. In this scenario, a government formed between Parties B and D would result in a center-left/center-right minority coalition, holding 44 percent of the seats.\n\nNow let us pay attention to what the BD government does to the parliamentary opposition. They have created an ideological wedge inside the opposition. Although they have the majority, the ACE opposition is unlikely to challenge this government. Consider, for instance, Party C’s alternatives. To build a credible opposition against the coalition’s policies, Page 45 →Party C has to convince both Party A and Party E, which are at the opposite ends of the political spectrum, to work together. This is much more difficult to achieve compared to an alternative scenario, where the BD government tailors its own policy position to converge to Party C’s preference point. After all, the figure shows that crossing the center of the political spectrum expands the BD government’s ideological range such that it now includes the preferences (as proxied by party ideology) of the party that falls within it (that is, Party C).\n\nThis scenario echoes the ideological proximity theory, which argues that a minority government’s ability to implement its policy should increase if the ideological distance between the governing and opposition parties decreases.133 Indeed, the BD government can offer much smaller concessions to Party C than either to Party A or E given this proximity.134 Likewise, for Party C, negotiating a compromise with the BD government while remaining outside its ranks could be far more cost-effective and politically beneficial than building a highly unstable bridge across Parties A and E to mount a challenge against it. The party would do this either by acting as what the literature calls a “support party,” or strictly as an opposition party but still “making issue-by-issue deals with the government.”135\n\nIn sum, minority coalitions hinder the chances of a unified parliamentary opposition to challenge by creating an ideological wedge when they include parties from both sides of the political spectrum.136 Although minorityPage 46 → coalitions should otherwise commit less in the foreign policy domain, we should therefore expect those making this leap across the aisle to face fewer domestic constraints and engage in more assertive commitments abroad. We shall see in chapter 4 that doing so was highly advantageous for the minority coalition in Denmark, especially when the opposition’s support was necessary to commit the regime’s resources to an overseas military operation in Iraq in 1990.\n\nHypotheses\n\nThe above discussion brings me to the hypotheses I will examine in the remainder of the book. The two contending theories that I have presented in this chapter lead to two broad hypotheses. First, if the veto players theory explains the commitment behavior of coalitions in foreign affairs, then we should expect the intensity of commitments to decrease when the government is a majority coalition, regardless of its structural (minimalist or oversized) or situational (ideologically cohesive or dispersed) characteristics. In contrast, if the clarity of responsibility theory explains their behavior, then this relationship should be positive. Here, I isolate majority coalitions per the preceding discussion. This exercise provides a good starting point to engage with the existing studies.\n\nHypothesis 1 (Veto Players): Majority coalitions decrease the intensity of foreign policy commitments.\n\nHypothesis 2 (Clarity of Responsibility): Majority coalitions increase the intensity of foreign policy commitments.\n\nThe following hypotheses refine both the veto players and clarity of responsibility approaches in the literature by accounting for the structural and the situational variation among coalitions. To start, the veto players theory suggests that we should expect minimum-winning coalitions to lead to less intense foreign policy commitments. Since the incentive to use veto power is distributed uniformly across the parties in minimum-winning settings, these coalitions face significant constraints against engaging in assertive international behavior.\n\nPage 47 →As for oversized coalitions, however, I expect responsibility diffusion to be at work. These coalitions not only distribute the veto incentive unevenly across the governing parties, but they are also larger than necessary. Together, these characteristics should allow them to act more forcefully in the international arena: they can diffuse responsibility among the governing parties better than the minimally organized coalitions, and those parties without veto power may choose to go along with the government because they anticipate low levels of electoral punishment anyway. If this second expectation, laid out in Hypothesis 4 below, is defeated by the data, then it would point to a stronger support for the veto players thesis and the constraining effect of majority coalitions in foreign affairs.\n\nHypothesis 3: Minimum-winning coalitions engage in weaker commitments.\n\nHypothesis 4: Oversized coalitions engage in more intense commitments.\n\nTo the extent that the “size” and “ideology” dimensions of coalitions “form the core of the coalition theory,”137 the effect of coalition governance on foreign policy should depend on their interplay. The hypotheses I have laid out do not yet account for the ideology dimension that further differentiates these coalitions, however. This brings me back to identifying the situational variation among them. The veto players theory implies that the negative effect of minimum-winning coalitions on commitments should be further amplified when the coalition is ideologically loose and dispersed. Although oversized coalitions should enjoy diffusion on average, they should also be prone to the negative effect of ideological rifts on commitment behavior, generating discord and weakening the behavioral advantages of diffusion. Even if the surplus parties in oversized coalitions have weaker incentives to disrupt the policymaking process and influence commitments, deeper rifts inside these large coalitions could lead to lengthier and more contentious debates among all the governing parties. Some smaller parties might even attempt to save electoral face precisely by engaging in such debates. Indeed, one such attempt to save face is “negative campaigning,” where governing parties criticize each other to differentiate their own policy platforms in an effort to attract votes.138 Therefore, at Page 48 →increasing levels of ideological disunity, I expect both minimum-winning and oversized coalitions to make weaker foreign policy commitments compared to single-party majority governments.\n\nHypothesis 5: Minimum-winning coalitions engage in weaker commitments as ideological dispersion among the governing parties increases.\n\nHypothesis 6: Oversized coalitions engage in weaker commitments as ideological dispersion among the governing parties increases.\n\nFinally, I test the effect of minority coalitions on commitment behavior. I expect that their structural vulnerability in the parliament should impose a negative effect on their commitment intensity on average. That said, building on the policy viability and fragmented opposition explanations, I expect minority coalitions that include parties from both the left and the right sides of the political spectrum to moderate this relationship by ideologically fracturing the “alternative majority” in the parliament, acting with greater commitment abroad as a result.\n\nHypothesis 7: On average, minority coalitions engage in weaker commitments abroad.\n\nHypothesis 8: When minority coalitions include parties from both sides of the political spectrum, they engage in more assertive commitments abroad.\n\nWhat Else Can Influence Governing Abroad?\n\nIt makes sense to focus on the government’s structure in parliamentary regimes both internally and vis-à-vis the legislature to explain its international commitment behavior. After all, the foreign policy authority in parliamentary systems belongs to the executive branch, which stems from within the ranks of the parliament. Further, governments in these regimes are often conceived as coalitions of multiple political parties. It is therefore meaningful and necessary to scrutinize the coalition itself as well as its standing in the parliament to illuminate its behavior abroad.\n\nThis chapter has argued for the need to move beyond a dichotomous treatment of governments and has provided explanations for why coalitions are far more heterogeneous than we often portray them to be. These governments vary based on how the incumbent parties contribute to the Page 49 →government’s strength and stability, how far these parties are from each other along the ideological spectrum, and how successful the coalition is in fragmenting the opposition when it lacks majority support. My argument has so far concentrated on two opposing logics—veto players and clarity of responsibility—as well as the policy viability and fragmented opposition theses to elucidate the different directions coalition foreign policy can take. Building on these theoretical foundations, I argue that the reason some coalitions act more assertively abroad, while others do not, has to do with the ways coalitions are organized.\n\nTo be sure, a valid counterpoint is that the way coalitions are organized is hardly the only factor that explains their international behavior. If the foreign policy commitments of these governments were simply a function of their composition, then world leaders, researchers, analysts, or pundits would not have needed to pay attention to the plethora of information that makes its way into policy briefs, intelligence reports, or news stories on a daily basis, including international shocks, changes in leadership, or fluctuations in the public’s approval of the government and its policies. In other words, explaining and intelligently responding to the foreign policy of parliamentary governments, and coalitions in particular, is possible when we situate coalition politics in the context of the international system, domestic politics, and the individual dispositions of the decision makers.\n\nDecades of research in international relations and foreign policy analysis concurs with this approach. Several studies highlight how foreign policy gets shaped by the powerful countercurrents that exist between political parties that defy our expectations, major international systemic events that might constitute exogenous shocks to the regime, influential decision makers in the regime who might shape the policymaking process in their own images, as well as what the masses think about their governments and the foreign policy issue itself. In this section, I discuss these factors. They clarify the pathways that connect democratic governments to their foreign policy outputs, and they perform as the conditions that inhibit, reinforce, or facilitate their international behavior. I then take each of these elements into account in the subsequent case study chapters of the book.\n\nLet us start with the same actors around which I have built my argument: the political parties. Although ideological rifts and disagreements are known to be the main culprits of government instability and breakdown,139 Page 50 →there is no denying that political parties also love to help each other despite their differences, specifically when they know they will get something in return. Logrolling is a key mechanism that allows for precisely this. Hagan and his colleagues define logrolling as the “willingness of one group to accept side payments.”140 Others emphasize more broadly that logrolling arrangements produce “voting alliances” in the parliament,141 ensuring that the policy proposals that require parliamentary consent achieve it. “Explicit compromises” often take place among political parties, which end up submitting to otherwise contentious policies in return for government seats.142 These seats are often offered to opposition parties by the government to further sweeten the deal and secure their support for policies.143 In sum, then, logrolling as a mechanism for facilitating policymaking counteracts the effect of interparty conflict that could otherwise lead to deadlock. The nature of multiparty governance in particular proliferates the conditions for making mutual concessions among parties inside and outside the government, since no party single-handedly controls the executive and enjoys majority support in the parliament.144 As a result, logrolling becomes a powerful dynamic that enables ideologically contentious parties to overcome their differences and govern together at home and abroad.\n\nIn the foreign policy domain, too, governments overcome deadlocks by offering side payments to those with the incentives to defect. These come in the form of office seats or promises for future policies in return.145 This quid pro quo that parties enter into might also explain how coalitions end up acting more assertively than we expect them to. Kaarbo’s study provides insights into how this is possible in contexts where the veto incentive is strong.146 The critical junior parties, whose support is vital to the maintenance of the coalition and to its policymaking capability, are especially well-suited to get what they want in return for cooperating with the rest of the government on contentious policy proposals.\n\nLogrolling thus constitutes a strong alternative explanation for assertivePage 51 → behavior, especially in ideologically contentious minimum-winning coalitions, where the parties are not only less likely to agree on each other’s policy preferences, but also have the strongest incentive to utilize their veto power or at least threaten to do so to sway the government. It diminishes the negative effect of these factors on policymaking, particularly when it comes to committing the regime’s political and material resources. By attaching future policy goals or office seats to their support for the government’s policy, the parties that are necessary to keep the government intact pursue their agenda and goals more effectively. In chapter 5, I show how logrolling took place among Dutch political parties and its foreign policy consequences by analyzing this country’s decision to participate in the 2003 Iraq war.\n\nLogrolling also explains how minority coalitions manage to pull their countries into costly international pursuits even though they fail to divide and conquer the opposition ranks. Evidence shows that minority coalitions that are ideologically compact and are therefore exposed to the opposition can still commit assertively abroad when they logroll with it. We will observe this mechanism at work in chapter 4, where I investigate Denmark’s decision to join the 2003 Iraq war.\n\nVoters are integral to a functioning democracy, but are they to foreign policy? Do our opinions on foreign affairs matter to our governments when they engage in foreign policy? Perhaps we should start by asking whether citizens even care enough about foreign affairs to develop opinions, or if they just follow the cues they receive from the leaders.147 One of the oldest and longest debates in international relations research continues to be the role of public opinion on foreign policy.148 Can governments still make assertive commitments abroad even if they do not have the public’s support behind them? Some political scientists argue that the masses hardly influence foreign policy decisions. Rather, the relationship takes place in the opposite direction and echoes the cue-taking logic: how the government formulates and implements foreign policy influences the public’s opinions on it instead.149 Others find that public support does not explain why governments follow through with their commitments once they verbally bind themselves.150 Still other political scientists qualify their claims, explaining that public support has to be specific and targeted on the foreign policy Page 52 →issue to have any influence on the government’s international behavior.151 Everts and Van Staden warn that public support “is only one of the factors shaping the outcome of the political process, and one cannot easily isolate the impact of one factor from that of others,”152 encouraging us to consider public opinion in the context of the other factors that influence foreign policy making.\n\nUltimately, there is reason to expect that capturing the role of public opinion on foreign policy is possible through a closer investigation of the issue itself as well as the domestic and international political context within which it is embedded. This is especially important in the context of oversized coalitions, where diffusion hinges on the government’s ability to overlook and circumvent public opinion. I take on this challenge in the subsequent case study chapters of the book. I investigate whether a strong public opinion exists for or against the respective foreign policy issues in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Finland and to what extent it influences the coalition’s commitment behavior beyond what is predicted by its composition.\n\nMoving beyond the domestic political environment, factors that pertain to the international system also matter in shaping foreign policy behavior, as they introduce exogenous shocks to the government’s decision-making processes. Threat to the survival of the regime is an alternative explanation of this sort that can outweigh the effects of government composition on international commitments. External threats, including terrorist attacks, trigger national security and survival, which encourage politicians to ignore domestic rivalries and push their disagreements aside.153 Auerswald argues that while coalitions should be less likely to use force than would single-party majority governments, this “should hold true as long as the national survival of the democracy is not threatened.”154\n\nThe 1995 Kardak crisis between Turkey and Greece illustrates how national security trumps partisan discord. Unstable and short-lived coalition governments had been the defining feature of Turkish politics throughout the 1990s. Comprising the center-right True Path Party (Dogru Yol Partisi—DYP) and the social democratic Republican People’s Party (Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi—CHP), the caretaker government led by Page 53 →Prime Minister Tansu Çiller was one of those fragile coalitions.155 Although it was fraught with infighting at the time, the coalition had to put all that aside when a Turkish freight ship ran aground on an islet known as Kardak (Imia), which Greece claimed as its sovereign territory. The Çiller government showed notable cohesiveness and declared in response that Kardak was within Turkey’s sovereign jurisdiction instead.156 Turkey went further and soon sent its commando units to the islet157—an example of intense commitment in the form of military force deployment—to further cement its claims despite the ongoing clashes between the country’s two governing parties. The Kardak episode illustrates that elites can still work together to respond to national security threats despite the frictions that otherwise pervade their policymaking ability. Threats to the regime and national survival should thus be accounted for as a contextual condition that can influence the foreign policy commitments of any government, regardless of its composition. The impact of coalition dynamics on the government’s international behavior should be minimal where the issue invokes threats to national security.\n\nLast but hardly least, we must consider the role of individuals in foreign policy. Kuperman looks at Israeli foreign policy as early as the 1950s to argue that the prime minister’s position prevails over those of other ministers or the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).158 Fast forward some fifty years and there is no doubt we are now in an age of personalized politics. Some argue that it is “presidentialized,” suggesting that leaders are now less constrained by their domestic institutions and enjoy greater control over the policy process.159 Considering the ever-increasing spotlight that leaders receive on a daily basis—especially in the international arena—it is important to investigate if political leaders play an independent role in shaping their government’s international behavior beyond what its composition predicts.\n\nSurely, much ink has been spilled on the influence of leaders in foreign policy. The leader’s unique interest in foreign affairs, her previous experience in a given foreign policy area, or her psychological traits are some of the individual-level factors that could influence decision making.160 To Page 54 →the extent that individuals impose an independent effect on the regime’s foreign policy, they might further amplify or moderate the effects of government composition on international commitments. Lantis explains that Helmut Schmidt’s leadership was a key element behind Germany’s decision to join the European Monetary System in 1978, for instance, when he was leading a coalition government comprising the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats.161 Leaders may often play key roles in striking compromises between parties both inside and outside the coalition in an effort to circumvent the structural and situational constraints of parliamentary governance.\n\nMoreover, “the strong tendency for a contraction of authority to the highest levels of government” during international crises could also push leaders to overcome the institutional constraints imposed by the structure of the government, resulting in leader-driven behaviors at the international level.162 The decision units research program contends that the contraction of authority to the leader in times of crisis could be observed even in coalitions, where no single actor could shape the decision-making process.163 Exogenous shocks such as threats to national security would not only shape the government’s behavior, but they could also highlight the role of the leader along the way. Together, these factors compel us to consider the role of key leaders in the foreign policy apparatus, such as prime ministers or foreign ministers. We should investigate how leaders navigate the constraints as well as the opportunities imposed by their governments and how these interactions influence the international commitments of their regimes.\n\nConclusion\n\nStudying the factors that increase democracies’ likelihood of using military force abroad, Auerswald argues that “coalition premiers will only reluctantly use force, as they must pay particular attention to achieving immediate success or risk a parliamentary revolt, especially if the governing coalitionPage 55 → is fragile.”164 What fragility entails, however, remains unknown. It can emanate from the structural or situational characteristics of coalitions, or both. From a veto players logic, coalitions are fragile because they include multiple veto players. Still, the power of the veto over policy outputs is conditional upon the distribution of the veto incentives among the parties as well as their ideological proximity to each other. Furthermore, coalitions can be surprisingly resilient and assertive in the international arena if they are big and compact enough to avoid electoral blame, or small but ideologically diverse enough to avoid a successful offense from the parliamentary opposition.\n\nTo summarize, the constraints and opportunities that coalition governments enjoy in the foreign policy domain are part and parcel of their structural and situational features. Not all coalitions are fragile or unconstrained. Rather, their room for maneuver is fundamentally shaped by how they are organized, which then influences their ability to make international commitments. In the next chapter, I present a series of quantitative analyses using post–Cold War foreign policy events to show these relationships at work."
