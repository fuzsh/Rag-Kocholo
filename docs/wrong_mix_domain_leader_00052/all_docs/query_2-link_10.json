        "text": "The European Commission president, Jacques Santer, will tonight try to beat back the European Parliament's threat to sack him by promising a strict new code of conduct for commissioners and officials.\n\nIt may already be too late. The solidarity of European Union governments behind the commission began to crumble yesterday when the Dutch prime minister, Wim Kok, said commissioners should resign if a majority of the parliament voted against one or all of them in this week's historic censure motion.\n\nThe motion follows the submission of a 34-page dossier to the parliament by an EU assistant auditor who alleges widespread fraud and mismanagement, and repeated efforts by top commission officials to suppress his investigations. The auditor who leaked the documents has been suspended on half pay and banned from his office.\n\nDowning Street, while alarmed that the commission may now be so wounded it cannot push through the ambitious Agenda 2000 reform programme of Europe's budget and policies this spring, also backed the parliament.\n\n\"The European Parliament is acting as it should, as a check on the commission, holding them to account and demanding a proper follow-up to the repeated Court of Auditors' reports on fraud and mismanagement,\" a spokesman said.\n\nMr Santer will promise to cut back national influence on the commissioners and propose an ethical code to stop nepotism, with strict limits on job appointments and contracts for friends and families of top officials.\n\n\"Santer has to give the speech of his life if he is to win back the confidence of parliament this week,\" said Alan Donnelly, the leader of the 60-strong Labour MEPs. \"He has to promise real and urgent action\".\n\nMr Donnelly will tomorrow call on Mr Santer to accept the appointment of a new parliamentary select committee with a right \"to go anywhere and see any document inside the commission\".\n\n\"It is important Santer agrees to this,\" Mr Donnelly said, noting that one of the parliament's main complaints is that the commission has withheld internal reports on fraud and mismanagement.\n\nBritish MEPs, the largest single group in the Socialist block, are trying desperately to come up with a formula to convince the parliament that the commission's bureaucratic and secretive culture is changing, while keeping the commission in place to enact the EU's budget reform before the end of March.\n\n\"There is a very big agenda in Europe this year, and we need a commission that can deliver and work in partnership with the member states to push it through,\" the Downing Street spokesman said.\n\nAll 20 commissioners, led by Mr Santer, gather in Bonn today to try and convince the German government, the current holder of the EU presidency, that they can survive the censure vote and keep the Agenda 2000 process on track. The commissioners will then fly to Strasbourg for tonight's opening of the censure debate.\n\nGermany, governed by a Social Democrat-led coalition with the Greens, is the key to the commission's survival. It fields the largest single national group in parliament, with 99 MEPs compared to the 87 for France and Britain.\n\nThe 40 Social Democrat MEPs are divided, but at least half seem ready to vote against the commission. Germany's 17 Green MEPs are determined that France's Edith Cresson and Spain's Manuel Marin deserve to be forced from office."
