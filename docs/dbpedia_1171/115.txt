Carl W. Stalling was a noted twentieth century American music composer and arranger. He is most noted for his musical scores for the "Looney Tunes," a popular Warner Brothers animated cartoon series. Among the most famous of these musical pieces is "What's Up Doc," the Bugs Bunny theme song. Stalling also produced musical scores for Walt Disney productions, and he was a silent film piano and organ player. Stalling received a U.S. patent in 1924 for his tick method of recording and depicting motion pictures. This method became a motion picture industry standard. Stalling was born in Lexington, Missouri, in 1891. He studied at the Kansas City Conservatory of Music, and it was here where he met his wife, Gladys Baldwin. He died in 1972, in Hollywood, California.
