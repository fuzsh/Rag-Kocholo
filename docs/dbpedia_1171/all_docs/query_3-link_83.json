        "text": "All products and services featured are independently chosen by editors. However, Billboard may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.\n\nEyewear doesn’t have to be boring. Keke Palmer dropped a colorful new collection with Zenni eyewear featuring bold and vibrant shades made to pair with your everyday look.\n\nReleased on Monday (Aug. 5), the “Vivid Remix” collection is a mix of round, square, oval and cat-eye frames. The collection channels Palmer’s “playful attitude, elegance and unbreakable confidence” according to a news release sent to Billboard.\n\nIncluded in the eyewear roundup are perfect-for-any season picks such as the Tortoiseshelle Square Glasses ($12.95), Lilac Cat-Eye Sunglasses ($25.95) and other designs like the geometric frames ($27.95) and round glasses ($32.95) featured below.\n\nThe “Vivid Remix” collection is the latest in Palmer’s ongoing partnership with Zenni, an eyewear brand that offers a range of frames at an affordable price. Palmer’s previous collections with Zenni include Board Certified and Cool Glam.\n\nThe 30-year-old mom, actress and singer has another release on the way — one that will pair nicely with any of the glasses from her Zenni collab. Fans can shop the eyewear collection and pre-order her upcoming memoir, Master of Me: The Secret to Controlling the Narrative. The book hits shelves in November.\n\n“This book means growth to me,” the Chicago native shared with People in April. “It signifies the next chapter of my life. It imparts the wisdom I’ve learned with the earnesty of knowing that I’m still changing.”"
