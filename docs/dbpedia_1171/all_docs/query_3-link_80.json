        "text": "A Very Important Guide to Podcast Music\n\nThere’s no denying it: the podcast medium is having its moment in the spotlight.\n\nLike YouTube videos and vlogging, podcasting has experienced a dramatic improvement in production value to accompany it. Music is the most noteworthy upgrade. As podcasting steps in to the limelight, podcast music is there, adding depth and nuance to the scene.\n\nIn fact, that's the most important thing to remember: Podcast music should be used to enhance the existing content and improve the listener experience. It's a tool to make things better, not distract people from what they came to hear.\n\nSo it’s no coincidence that the most famous podcasts in recent memory also have the most compelling music — music that’s often created by recognizable recording artists.\n\nSerial is the most obvious example. By taking an episodic approach to investigative journalism, Serial hooked millions of listeners and won numerous awards.\n\nBut listen closely, and you’ll notice Serial did something else too: it introduced us to a score that was just as dramatic as the content of the show. Give the intro a listen if you haven’t heard it before (or even if you have, it’s worth another go):\n\nThe music is so good because the producers enlisted professional help. The entire score for Serial was composed by Nick Thorburn of indie stalwarts Islands.\n\nSerial isn’t the only show that’s turning to established musicians to compose music to support the content. WNYC, the New York City affiliate for NPR, maintains an entire roster of composers who create music for the station’s shows. Andrew Dust from fun. worked on the theme for Women of the Hour.\n\nThe standard of podcast music is improving dramatically. In concert, so are the expectations of listeners.\n\nYou only get one chance to make a good first impression, and that's exactly why we've created this guide to help you find professional-grade (and affordable) music for your podcast.\n\nBefore getting into the nitty gritty of podcast music licensing, let's start with what you came here for: The music.\n\nCurated Playlists for Podcasters\n\nPodcast: Top Hits\n\nListen and license here.\n\nPodcast: Let’s Talk\n\nListen and license here.\n\nPodcast: Corporate Cast\n\nListen and license here.\n\nPodcast: Energetic Intros\n\nListen and license here.\n\nPodcast: Electronic\n\nListen and license here.\n\nOur Top 10 Trending Songs for Podcasts\n\n1. “Dynamo Roadshow” by Kristian Leo\n\nGenre: Rock\n\nInstruments: Electric guitar and guitar\n\nListen and license here.\n\n2. “Clouds” by Acreage\n\nGenre: Cinematic\n\nInstruments: Piano and strings\n\nListen and license here.\n\n3. “We Can Begin Again” by Joshua Spacht\n\nGenre: Ambient\n\nInstruments: Piano and ambient tones\n\nListen and license here.\n\n4. “Hope” by Fair Frame\n\nGenre: Ambient\n\nInstruments: Piano and ambient tones\n\nListen and license here.\n\n5. “Talk To Me” by Mikey Geiger\n\nGenre: Electronic\n\nInstruments: Drums and synth\n\nListen and license here.\n\n6. “Bitz” by Famous Cats\n\nGenre: Electronic\n\nInstruments: Electric guitar and synth\n\nListen and license here.\n\n7. “Got You Too” by Daniele Musto\n\nGenre: Electronic\n\nInstruments: Drums and synth\n\nListen and license here.\n\n8. “A Day Without Rain” by Stephen Keech\n\nGenre: Ambient\n\nInstruments: Piano and ambient tones\n\nListen and license here.\n\n9. “Rejuvenation” by Cody Martin\n\nGenre: Cinematic\n\nInstruments: Piano and electric guitar\n\nListen and license here.\n\n10. “Simple Song” by Fantoms\n\nGenre: Alternative\n\nInstruments: Electric guitar and guitar\n\nListen and license here.\n\nWhy good podcast music matters\n\nContent will always be the most important part of any podcast.\n\nShows that interview intriguing guests or telling arresting stories better than the competition will always attract more listeners.\n\nBut the sounds that accompany the content are important, too.\n\nThe right intro music for podcasts can hook new listeners as soon as they press play. Instead of waiting for the story to build some momentum, they’ll be instantly engaged by the music.\n\nUsing the same music for every show can also tap into the Familiarity Principle, a psychological phenomenon by which people develop a preference for something simply by being exposed to that same thing multiple times. Just having consistent royalty free podcast music will make your show more enjoyable to listeners.\n\nThese production details matter because everyone needs a plan to grow their audience.\n\nAt its core, music can not only help you develop a more distinct brand for your show, but can also help your content stand out against the ever-growing list of podcasts you’re competing against for listeners.\n\nThe 3 Types of Podcast Music\n\nIt’s tempting to think the music for your show needs to be attention-grabbing, like what you’d hear on the radio. If all of your listeners are operating on 5 second attention spans, shouldn’t your intro hook them with an irresistible beat?\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nIn Pitchfork’s interview with multiple podcast producers and musicians, one theme became particularly clear: podcast music isn’t supposed to be overtly catchy.\n\nThe primary responsibility of this music is to enhance your content, not compete with it. Or as the article eloquently states: “At best, podcast music amplifies not only what’s being said, but the act of saying.”\n\nSo does that mean you want to pick an intro that’s droll? Absolutely not. It means that you should think of your intro music (and the segment breaks and the outro) as a segue to the main course of your show, the content.\n\nThe music isn’t content itself; it exists to serve and enhance your dialogue.\n\nHow to find your sound\n\nDespite not being the main draw, royalty free podcast music can set the stage for your story. How well it does so depends on how effectively the tracks you choose match the tone of your content.\n\nThis might sound intimidating at first. After all, there are producers who do this stuff for a living.\n\nLuckily, there’s a simple method to find podcast sound effects and music with just the right tone for your show. Just think of three words that describe the content of your podcast, and then find tracks that match some (or all) of these three adjectives.\n\nLet’s use Serial as an example.\n\nSince this show deals with investigative journalism, it could be described as serious. Most investigations are told as mysteries, so you could also describe the show as suspenseful.\n\nHowever, the show never dips into horror. It remains accessible to most listeners — Serial is journalism, not Jaws.\n\nIf you were choosing the music for Serial, you could use those three adjectives to help judge which music is appropriate for the show. Is this the most sophisticated method for scoring podcasts? No. But does it work? Absolutely.\n\n3 types of podcast music you need for your show\n\nMusic does three basic jobs in podcasts: it helps with the intro, lives in the background of certain segments, and closes the show.\n\nThis section provides some context for each type of royalty free podcast music and provides some guidance for choosing the right tunes.\n\n1. Podcast Intro Music\n\nIf there’s one place to really focus on hooking listeners with just music, it’s the introduction to your show.\n\nListening to podcasts is a private experience. When people put on headphones and tune in to your show, they’re actually tuning out everything else.\n\nTo that end, your podcast intro music should be compelling enough to seize listeners’ attention and focus them on the opening words of that episode.\n\nUse the model we discussed in the last section to narrow down the style of music you’re looking for, and then look for something that just feels right. Podcast intro music typically lasts 15 to 30 seconds long, so you’ll always want to make sure the song you choose has it’s best hook in that time frame.\n\n2. Background music\n\nAt certain points in the show, there will be moments when you want to highlight a particular piece of dialogue.\n\nThe obvious way to do this is to introduce background music to frame the content and provide guidance to the listener about how they should feel at that particular moment.\n\nThis needs to be done with care, or else the music will leap out of the background and push the content — the stuff you really want people to hear — into obscurity. Obviously, that’s not the result you or the audience wants, so a good best practice is to keep background music extraordinarily simple.\n\nThis is typically a good use for song STEMS, or the individual pieces of a song. Instead of putting a multi-instrument track behind the dialogue, you could use a single guitar rift or drum fill.\n\nBackground music also comes in to play when there are no words being spoken, when you’re giving the audience a bit of breathing room to digest what they just heard. The background music of transitions adheres to most of the same rules we just outlined — you want transitions to be moments of reflection, not interruptions that drag the audience out of focus.\n\n3. Podcast Outro Music\n\nThe ending of your show is nearly as important as the beginning.\n\nLike it or not, the way you end a show will have a heavy influence on how listeners feel about the episode as a whole. Did you tie the story up? Did you recap what happened and synthesize it in a satisfactory way?\n\nMusic can certainly help you close the show, but like background music, outro music needs to take a backseat to the dialogue. An easy way to do this is to use your intro music, but reduce the volume so it plays second fiddle to the closing thoughts you’re leaving your audience with.\n\nII. How to License Podcast Music\n\nNow for the difficult part. Where, exactly, are you going to find royalty free podcast music to use in your show?\n\nUnless you find music that’s completely free, you’re going to have to license some songs. Sure, free music exists, but it’s almost always subpar and overused. The entire point of using music in your podcast is to increase the production value, and free music works against that goal.\n\nThat leaves music licensing.\n\nWhy you need to license music\n\nMusic licensing is complicated. Entire books have been written about the intricacies of copyright law and the many moving parts involved in licensing a song.\n\nStill, music licensing is something you need to understand, because copyright violations can cost you.\n\nPeloton is a good example. The company makes workout bikes, but they also provide workout classes that customers can follow when they work out. And those classes have music playlists.\n\nPeloton loaded those playlists up with famous songs, which people loved. But the company forgot to license the rights to all of those songs, which made some organizations pretty upset. Eventually, a group of music publishers sued Peloton for $150 million due to copyright infringement.\n\nNow, if you use a song without licensing it, will you get sued for $150 million? No. But you could be forced to take down any episodes in which the offending music was used. In more severe cases, you could be fined. Or if you have a video podcast on YouTube, your content can be demonetized.\n\nBy the way, don’t be swayed by myths like the 10 Second Rule or the idea that if your podcast doesn’t make money, you don’t need to license the music you use.\n\nThose are myths, and they can get you sued.\n\nSo, it’s always better to just license the music. Here’s how that works.\n\nHow music licensing works\n\nEvery piece of music consists of two parts: the song / composition and the sound recording.\n\nThe songwriters and publishers own the rights to the song, while the label and artists (the people who perform the song, not necessarily the people who wrote it) own the rights to the sound recording.\n\nIf you want to use a song in your podcast, you need to get legal permission to do so. That means obtaining a license, which is a legal agreement between the rights holders and you.\n\nLicensing fees are one of the main ways artists, labels, songwriters, et al get paid. So it’s a fundamental part of the music business.\n\nTo use a song, you need to get permission from every right holder. If even one says no — either because they don’t like how you’re going to use the music or don’t agree to the fee you’ve offered — then you can’t license the song.\n\nNow consider that there could be multiple songwriters or multiple artists involved in one song. And you need to get all of their permission. Intense, right?\n\nBut wait there’s more.\n\nThere are multiple types of licenses, and they vary by use case.\n\nFor podcasting, you need to obtain a sync license — so called because it was first introduced as a license for “syncing” music to video. A sync license includes usage rights to the sound recording and the composition.\n\nThe question is: How do you do so without starting a letter writing campaign to 7 copyrights holders?\n\nWhere to Find Royalty Free Music for Podcasts\n\nIf you’ve read any of what I’ve just written, or even worse, tried to license music firsthand, you know the current processes just don’t work for creators.\n\nWhether it’s the time commitment of negotiations or the actual cost of paying for the music license, there are too many barriers between podcasters and quality royalty-free music.\n\nThese obstacles can be even more complex for podcasters, because you may need to obtain a more expensive license to use a song in multiple episodes of your show.\n\nHere’s the good news: The entire reason Soundstripe exists is to give you easy and affordable access to quality music for your projects.\n\nHow our audio library works\n\nTo access our music library, all you have to do is subscribe to one of our plans.
