        "text": "If you grew up in the 90s, you know Powerline. If you’re honest with yourself, you love Powerline. You might even be obsessed with Powerline, one of the greatest fictional musicians ever to grace the stage.\n\nFor those of you who may not have come of age at the end of the 20th century, Powerline is the band at the center of 1995’s A Goofy Movie. As Max Goof explains in the film, he is, “The biggest rockstar on the planet.” Inspired by artists like Prince and Michael Jackson, he was brought to life by R&B star Tevin Campbell.\n\nI2I\n\nOne of the highlights of the movie, was Powerline’s performance of the song “I2I,” whose lyrics were written by Roy Freeland, with music by Patrick DeRemer (with a title that owes a clear debt to Prince’s “I Would Die 4 U”).\n\n“The way we usually worked was that I would deliver a rough demo of the music with a gibberish-type lyric so I could communicate the melody to [Roy], and then he would do his wizardry and write an amazing lyric,” DeRemer recalled in a 2020 interview.\n\nBambi Moé, the associate producer of music for the film, talked about how Campbell got involved in the project, stating, “I was at Capitol Records at a session for another project, and I heard this singer singing in another studio. The singer was Tevin Campbell. I said, “Oh my God.” Nobody really knew who Tevin Campbell was – some people, but he certainly wasn’t as popular as he became. I loved the voice…he was Prince’s protege and he was discovered by Quincy Jones.”\n\nThe movie, and Powerline’s performance in it, became cult favorites. In 2015, at the D23 Expo, the film’s 20th anniversary panel drew over 1,000 Guests, the most of any at the event, and the movie has been cited as an inspiration on cartoons like Gravity Falls and films like Pixar’s Turning Red.\n\nMagnolia Park\n\nIn late July of 2024, a brand new version of “I2I” was released ahead of Disney’s A Whole New Sound album. It was the album’s second single, preceded by A Simple Plan’s cover of “Can You Feel the Love Tonight.”\n\nFormed in Orlando, Florida in 2018, Magnolia Park, the band started as your standard pop punk band, but that didn’t last. As front man Joshua Roberts recalled, “A couple of the guys came to the rest of us and said, ‘Hey, we’ve been working on some stuff that’s a little different and we want to know what you think. Up until that point we were just a little pop-punk band with no layers underneath the songs and nothing auxiliary in there to augment the music – it was real bare-bones stuff. But then we started doing something that was completely different to what other bands were doing at the time.”\n\nAlong with developing a unique sound that began pushing pop punk into unexplored territory, the band was also breaking ground for their diversity, including members of a variety of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Roberts noted “There are minorities in Magnolia Park that weren’t represented in the scene or the world at large, so the fact that we’re now able to make music that resonates on that deeper level is very important to us. We all grew up with this music and we all have those songs that touch our hearts. Now, I want to create those songs for others.”\n\nThe band also credit their background with their desire to perform Powerline’s Disney classic. In a statement at the time of the song’s release, the band stated, “‘I2I’ is a huge part of black history and inspired all of us as kids to make music. The message of the song of all of us coming together is something we all stand by.”\n\nFrom Disney’s side of things, the company notes that it was important to include new voices as part of the A Whole New Sound project, with director of brand marketing Tim Pennoyer stating, “It was important to me to have some up-and-coming bands on the album since part of the fun of the legendary ‘Punk Goes Pop’ series in the early 2000s was discovering new bands. After the release of the first single from A Whole New Sound, ‘I2I’ was the most requested Disney song by fans on social media to be covered next.”\n\nWhile we’re still waiting for the release date of A Whole New Sound, the two singles we’ve heard so far promise an album that should be blasted at full volume and listened to on repeat. I can’t wait to hear what comes next.\n\nThere is a yellow brick road that now connects the worlds of Pride Rock, Scooby Doo, and the legendary Vans Warped Tour. That’s because pop punk darlings Simple Plan just released their cover of Elton John’s classic “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” from Disney’s The Lion King.\n\nThe song was released to celebrate the 30th anniversary of The Lion King which hit theaters on June 15, 1994. Its debut also helps promote the upcoming Disney album, A Whole New Sound. The record will feature a variety of pop-punk bands performing classic Disney Hits.\n\nA press release from The Walt Disney Company explained, “As a huge music fan, Mickey has an extensive record collection—which gave him the idea for a new album made for fans of all generations. Mickey and his Friends brought together some of their favorite alternative, rock, and pop-punk bands to reimagine popular Disney songs for A Whole New Sound, and the full album and vinyl will be available later this year.”\n\nFormed in 1999, Pierre Bouvier formed Simple Plan with high school friends Chuck Comeau, Jeff Stinco, and Sébastien Lefebvre, taking their name from the 1998 crime thriller A Simple Plan, directed by Sam Raimi.\n\nThe band’s debut album, No Pads, No Helmets…Just Balls was released in 2002. It included the singles “I’m Just a Kid,” “I’d Do Anything,” “Addicted,” and “Perfect.” During this time, Simple Plan toured with groups like Good Charlotte, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and Avril Lavigne.\n\nThat year, Simple Plan also recorded the new theme song for the newest installment of the long-running Scooby Doo franchise. The song (and the cartoon) was titled “What’s New Scooby Doo?”\n\nIn addition to the group’s six studio albums, the members also founded the Simple Plan Foundation. As they explained, “The foundation’s aim is to help young people in need, by easing their difficult passage to adulthood and by supporting the victims of life-threatening illnesses. The foundation also believes that the practice of music can be a privileged tool to help them find a passion in life, keeping them away from street gangs and criminality, and preventing school dropping.”\n\nIn the official press release from Disney, Simple Plan stated, “We grew up watching Disney movies with our families and now we get to enjoy them with our own kids, so it’s pretty amazing to have been invited to be on this album.”\n\nThey elaborate on this in an interview with Billboard saying, “When Disney reached out to us to be a part of this project, it was a bit overwhelming because there are so many amazing Disney songs. But it became obvious pretty quickly that The Lion King song book, and especially ‘Can You Feel the Love Tonight,’ stood out from the rest…The song just has such a classic feel, and the melodies are so memorable and timeless. We also felt like it would lend itself really well to our style and would sound awesome as a pop-punk version. Finally, the fact that the movie celebrates its 30th anniversary this year was just the icing on the cake! It’s such an honor to offer our own version of this song and to cover such an iconic artist like Sir Elton John. We’re not sure if he heard the song or not, but we hope he will enjoy this new version and feel like we did it justice.”\n\nIt was also announced that the band will perform their rendition of the song at D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event on August 9, 2024. While Disney has yet to announce the full track list for the album, we do also know that Magnolia Park has recorded a cover of “I2I” from A Goofy Movie. While we wait for the record to drop, here’s Simple Plan’s music video for “Can You Feel the Love Tonight.”\n\nMy love for the original Country Bear Jamboree is fairly well documented. In the past I’ve written about Big Al and the song “Blood on the Saddle,” the sultry sounds of Teddi Barra crooning “Heart, We Did All That We Could” and even the “I know I shouldn’t be laughing at this, but here we are…” feeling of listening to Wendell and Henry singing “Mama, Don’t Whoop Little Buford.” It has been a longtime favorite and will always hold a special place in my heart.\n\nI’ve got a laundry list of memories associated with the original that I’ll cherish forever. But change is a constant when it comes to Disney Parks, and luckily Imagineers know how to work magic. So, I was optimistic that the new show, which is titled The Country Bear Musical Jamboree, would be a charming and fun update of the original classic. I’m happy to say that this optimism was well founded.\n\nThe new show had its soft opening on July 10, 2024, bringing the County Bears into the 21st century with updated costumes, animatronics, and music, while holding onto the familiar characters and humor that fans have come to know and love over the years. The whole gang has retuned for the new show, though one of them comes with a new name. After half a century, Liverlips McGrowl has been re-dubbed Romeo.\n\nThe most significant change to the show involves the music. In the original, the members of the Country Bears sang established country numbers that were originally performed by the likes of Tex Ritter, Wanda Jackson, and Jean Shepherd. This time around, our ursine friends are performing country-fied versions of Disney classics (with the exception of the show’s opening number, “Country Bear Musical Jamboree,” which is a new original song, and “Come Again,” which is the song that has always closed the show).\n\nLet’s take a look at the songs included:\n\nCountry Bear Musical Jamboree\n\nTry Everything (Zootopia)\n\nKiss the Girl (The Little Mermaid)\n\nSupercalifragilisticexpialidocious (Mary Poppins)\n\nA Whole New World (Aladdin)\n\nFixer-Upper (Frozen)\n\nRemember Me (Coco)\n\nYou’ve Got a Friend in Me (Toy Story)\n\nThe Bare Necessities (The Jungle Book)\n\nCome Again\n\nMac McAnally, a singer-songwriter and longtime member of Jimmy Buffet’s band, served as the producer and arranger for all of the pieces in the show, as well as lending his voice to the songs “Fixer-Upper” and “The Bare Necessities.”\n\nSpeaking of his involvement, McAnally said, “I first saw the Country Bears as a teenage musician and it bolstered my pride in the acoustic musical heritage of the rural South. I next saw the show with my own kids and sat amongst multiple generations of families from all over and felt that common bond that lasts a lifetime. It is my great blessing to get to be a part of the continuation of the tradition and I have done my best to honor the spirit of the Bears and the great Disney songbook as well as the heart and soul that runs through the veins of country music. And just maybe it explains why I’ve been singing in a Bear voice for several decades before this opportunity came up.”\n\nMcAnally isn’t the only notable musician involved in the new show. Singer Emily Ann Roberts, who competed on Season 9 of The Voice as part of Blake Shelton’s team, provides the voice of Trixie for the song “Try Everything.”\n\n“It’s so crazy seeing Trixie singing with my voice coming out,” Roberts said. “It’s something that I never, ever dreamed would be a reality in my life…Y’all can tell by the way I talk that I don’t sound anything like Shakira. When I was approached to record the song for Country Bear Musical Jamboree, I thought, ‘OK, we’re going to really have to put our East Tennessee into this.’ When I heard the new [country arrangement], it was so easy for me to get in the zone. I was so excited when I got into the studio and everybody told me to just sing it the way I would. I got to lean into my Appalachian and country music roots and just let her fly.”\n\nThe song “A Whole New World” is brought to life by the duo of Allison Russel and Chis Thile, performing as Teddi Barrra and Wendell respectively. Formerly of groups like Po’ Girl, Birds of Chicago, and Our Native Daughters, Russel has also released a pair of solo albums and earned a total of 8 Grammy Award nominations with one win (taking the trophy for “Best Americana Roots Performance” for her song “Eve was Black.”)\n\nFor his part, Thile broke into the music world at the age of 12 when he released an album with the group Nickel Creek (1993’s Little Cowpoke). Since that time he has won four Grammy Awards, a MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” Fellowship, and served as the host of the American Public Media show Live from Here. In addition to his work with Nickel Creek, he has recorded music as part of the Punch Brothers, as well as solo albums and collaborations with musicians such as Bela Fleck, Dolly Parton, Yo-Yo Ma, Edgar Meyer, and others.\n\nWith such an incredible roster of musicians involved in the project, it’s no surprise that the musical performances shine. McAnally’s arrangements brilliantly bring Disney favorites into the world of country music while holding true to the original compositions. Two personal favorites include the Elvis Presley/Sun Records musical treatment given to “Kiss the Girl” and Big Al’s mournful performance of “Remember Me.”\n\nWhile I’ll always love and miss the original, The Country Bear Musical Jamboree is a worthy heir and is sure to delight new generations of Disney fans for years to come. Here’s hoping that I’ll see y’all in Grizzly Hall. It’s time for foot stompin’, hand clappin’, heart warmin’ sing-along.\n\nMusic is the beating heart of New Orleans. It’s the mojo that runs through the murky waters of the Louisiana bayous and lights up the streets of the cities. The list of musicians that have called Louisiana home is breathtaking. Here’s a small look: Louis Armstrong, Allen Toussaint, Dr. John, Stanley ‘Buckwheat’ Dural Jr., Buddy Bolden, Fats Domino, Jelly Roll Morton, Jerry Lee Lewis, King Oliver, Huddie Ledbetter, Lil Wayne, Louis Prima, Lucinda Williams, Mahalia Jackson, Professor Longhair, Sidney Bechet, Wynton Marsalis, Aaron Neville, Tim McGraw, Harry Connick Jr., Master P, Big Freedia, Michael Doucet, and Terrance Semien, and that just scratches the surface.\n\nNew Orleans is the birthplace of jazz. The city sits in the Mississippi Delta, placing it squarely in the heart of the land that gave birth to the blues, tying it inextricably to the creation of rock and roll as well. The state’s fertile musical soil gave rise to zydeco and Cajun music, not to mention a rich history in the country and hip-hop genres. So, it should come as no surprise that when Disney decide to make a movie set in the Pelican State, music would play a substantial role.\n\nFor the film’s soundtrack, Disney turned to Randy Newman, who spent much of his childhood in the Crescent City. They also invited a host of New Orleans and Louisiana luminaries to perform, such as Dr. John and Terrance Semien. The album produced immediate classics like “Ma Belle Evangeline,” “Friends on the Other Side,” “Almost There” and “Down in New Orleans.” The latter two were nominated for Best Original Song at the 82nd Annual Academy Awards.\n\nWhen Disney decided to build an attraction based on the beloved film, it only made sense for the company to include music from the film as part of the experience. Tiana’s Bayou Adventure, which opened on June 28, 2024, at the Magic Kingdom and has yet to open in Disneyland, features four songs from the film: “Down in New Orleans,” “Almost There,” “Gonna Take You There,” and “Dig a Little Deeper.” But they didn’t stop with familiar favorites. As part of the attraction’s grand finale, Disney has introduced a brand-new musical number that is sure to become a classic.\n\nSpecial Spice\n\nThe song in question is titled “Special Spice” and was written and produced by the New Orleans born, Grammy Award winning musician and producer PJ Morton. In addition to performing as the keyboardist for the band Maroon 5, Morton has released several solo EPs and nine studio albums.\n\nCreating a song for the attraction fulfilled one of two lifelong dreams for Morton. The first was a desire to work with Stevie Wonder. The other was to write music for Disney.\n\nSpeaking with Ebony, Morton explained how he was brought into the project, which he states ended up taking roughly three years.\n\n“Someone I knew reached out to me,” he said. “He [said], there’s a secret project and it involves New Orleans and Disney. And I [said], ‘Man, you’ve got to tell me more,’ and they explained the vision…The idea was that Tiana’s story would continue after [The Princess and The Frog]. Now, she’s married, has her own restaurant in New Orleans and she’s thriving. What does a song sound like for Tiana right now? She’s trying to put a band together for this big party.”\n\nHe went on to explain that there were several songs created before settling on “Special Spice.”\n\n“As a songwriter and a creative, it’s just inspiring to be able to figure it out,” he said. “I’ve wanted to write for Disney since I was a kid, since The Little Mermaid. It was truly a dream come true. I was super honored and I rode it with my family. My 11-year-old daughter got to [witness] the first Black composer to write an original song for the first Black Disney princess.”\n\nAnika Noni Rose, the voice of Tiana, returned to the role for Tiana’s Bayou Adventure and performed Morton’s song. A Disney Legend since 2011, Rose was thrilled to learn that Disney was continuing Tiana’s story, and the idea that the attraction would involve Mardi Gras. As she related in a 2020 interview, “Anytime you talk about Mardi Gras, the music has to be fantastic…It should be a little thrilling, but it also should be just a whole lot of fun.”\n\nThe music and lyrics of the song perfectly capture that exuberant feeling of fun. Take a look at the words:\n\nCome on in! I’m glad you made it!\n\nYou’re all my friends. Let me just say this:\n\nThe only thing required is to be true\n\nto the very unique thing that makes you, you.\n\nToss your talent in like making gumbo.\n\nYou stir it all in to make the perfect combo.\n\nNothing is wasted. It all gets used\n\nlike when we play together, we just can’t lose.\n\nIt’s a joyful celebration!\n\nYou don’t need an invitation.\n\nIt’s joyful; now everyone can see\n\nyour very special spice makes us complete.\n\nThere’s hidden treasure here in the bayou.\n\nKeep yourself open; life can float right by you.\n\nIt may surprise you what you can find\n\nunderneath the surface with an open mind.\n\nIt’s a joyful celebration!\n\nYou don’t need an invitation.\n\nIt’s joyful; now everyone can see\n\nyour very special spice makes us complete.\n\nSometimes it’s hard to believe that the very thing\n\nwe were looking for was right here all along.\n\nLet’s not waste any more time doubting what’s inside.\n\nEveryone can sing the song!\n\nCome on, everybody!\n\nIt’s a joyful celebration!\n\nYou don’t need an invitation.\n\nIt’s joyful; this band just can’t be beat\n\nbecause your special spice makes us—\n\nbecause your unique spark makes us—\n\nbecause your special spice makes us complete.\n\nBecause your special spice makes life complete.\n\nDaydreaming about the future of the piece, Rose told The Source that she’d love to hear Bruno Mars create a remix of the song.\n\n“I know he would put some stank on it,” she said.\n\nWhether or not that ever comes to be remains to be seen, but what’s without doubt is that Disney has created another musical gem in “Special Spice,” one that’s sure to fill Disney fans with joy for years to come.\n\nJoin us again next week when we take a look at the music of the brand-new Magic Kingdom show Country Bear Musical Jamboree. And in two weeks, we’ll dive back into our exploration of the music of Disney’s Silly Symphonies.\n\nIn a 2019 article, Disney historian and composer Ross Care noted that the early Silly Symphonies were generally, “content to explore the novelty of animation cleverly joined—one could say “choreographed”—to pastiche scores.” The Merry Dwarfs, which debuted on December 19, 1929, continued this trend.\n\nThe film was directed by Walt Disney, and as with the previous Silly Symphonies, Carl Stalling provided the music. It was a winning combination that would soon come crashing to a halt. Less than a month later, animator Ub Iwerks would leave Disney to start his own studio and on January 22, Stalling followed him.\n\nThat said, Iwerks and Stalling’s contributions would appear in two more Silly Symphonies after The Merry Dwarfs (those being Summer and Autumn, released in January and February of 1930 respectively). But all of that was in the future and unexpected when The Merry Dwarfs was released.\n\nIn terms of plot, it’s fairly simple. There are dwarfs with long, white beards. They work. They dance. They drink a lot of booze. That’s about it. Don’t underestimate just how much beer these dwarfs drink. The last 30 seconds or so of the film are seen as though the viewer was sporting beer goggles, the screen swaying and distorting after two of the dwarfs fall into a barrel of ale.\n\nThe bulk of the film’s music is drawn from Guiseppi Verdi’s opera Il Trovatore. More specifically, it makes use of the well-known “Coro di Zingari,” more commonly known as the “Anvil Chorus.”\n\nItaly’s greatest 19th century composer\n\nVerdi was born in October of 1813 near Busseto, Italy, a northern village that was considered part of the First French Empire at the time. His birth certificate noted that his parents were employed as an “inn keeper” and a “spinner.” They were part of a landowning family, despite the fact that he would later portray his heritage as that of uneducated peasants.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable aspect of his birth certificate is that it lists his date of birth as “born yesterday.” Not only does this mean that scholars are not quite sure the exact date of his birth, but it meant that Verdi was never able to angrily declare, “What? Do you think I was born yesterday?” This fact does not seem to have impacted his life to any particular degree.\n\nA village school master named Bastriocchi began teaching a four-year-old Verdi, which included instruction in the organ. He was so taken with music that his parents bought him a spinet, and when Bastriocchi died, Verdi took over the paid position as church organist, despite being a mere eight years old.\n\nAt the age of 12, he began his formal music education, studying under Ferdinando Provesi. Speaking of this time, he later recalled, ‘”From the ages of 13 to 18 I wrote a motley assortment of pieces: marches for band by the hundred, perhaps as many little sinfonie that were used in church, in the theatre and at concerts, five or six concertos and sets of variations for pianoforte, which I played myself at concerts, many serenades, cantatas (arias, duets, very many trios) and various pieces of church music, of which I remember only a Stabat Mater.”\n\nHis first opera debuted in 1839, earning him a contract for three additional works. Tragically, while working on his second opera, his wife Margherita Barezzi died at the age fo 26 from encephalitis. She’d been preceded in death by their two children, both of whom died at just over one year in age.\n\nThe opera, Un gionro di regno, was considered a failure and Verdi was said to have sworn off composing forever. However, the resolve did not last. His next opera, Nabucco, was a success and launched Verdi into stardom. Work on Il Trovatore began in 1850, but the opera would not debut until three years later. Work on Rigoletto and others fed the delay.\n\nThe “Anvil Chorus” appears in the first scene of act 2 in the opera and takes place at a Romani camp. The lyrics to the piece are an ode to the value of hard work and wine. While the words are not used in “The Merry Dwarfs,” the lines seem as though they could have easily been a part of the Disney short as well. Consider these lyrics:\n\nFill up the goblets! New strength and courage\n\nflow from lusty wine to soul and body.\n\nSee how the rays of the sun play and sparkle\n\nand give to our wine gay new splendor.\n\nSo, to work now!\n\nLike many of the other classical pieces used in the Silly Symphony series, the “Anvil Chorus” is a piece whose melody you likely recognize, even if you aren’t sure where it is from. The melody has been used in The Muppet Show, Sesame Street, Babe: Pig in the City, and Bad Santa to name just a few instances. It was parodied by Gilber & Sullivan in The Pirates of Penzance, and was also frequently spoofed in the classic 90’s cartoon Tiny Toon Adventures.\n\nThe Clarinetist\n\nWhile the “Anvil Chorus” is the principal piece of music featured in The Merry Dwarfs, the cartoon also makes use of “Jolly Fellows Waltz” by Robert Vollstedt.\n\nThough Vollstedt is not as highly regarded or remembered as Verdi, he did compose over 400 pieces in his lifetime. The majority of these were intended for dancing, though he also wrote a significant number of marches.\n\nBorn in Meldorf, Germany in 1854, there is little known about his musical education. Aside from composing, he spent most of his life as the principal clarinetist for the Hamburg Opera House, and even wrote a musician’s manual on the instrument.\n\n“Jolly Fellows Waltz” was his most successful piece and was even selected by John Philip Sousa to be played at the opening of the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. As an aside, Walt Disney’s father, Elias Disney, worked as a carpenter for the exposition.\n\nThe song was also one of the earliest waltz shellac recordings and was a standard in the repertoire of the Boston Pops orchestra for over half a century.\n\nSpecial Spice\n\nNext week, we’ll be taking a brief break from our Silly Symphony series to take a look at the new Disney song “Special Spice” from the all-new Disney attraction Tiana’s Bayou Adventure. Make sure to stop back for a musical taste of New Orleans. In the meantime, check out this old post “Gonna Take You There: Zydeco on the Bayou.”\n\nLet’s begin this post with a clarification. This will not, in fact, be about the opening track from AC/DC’s seminal 1980 hard rock album Back in Black. We will not be discussing the vocal qualities of Brian Johnson or engaging in an in-depth analysis of how they compare to the late Angus Young’s voice. Nor will we be contemplating the school boy fashion stylings of Angus Young. If you clicked into this piece hoping to find yourself on the Highway to Hell, you have my apologies. But stick around anyway.\n\nIn this instance, Hell’s Bells refers to the fourth Silly Symphony. It was the first of the series to be directed by Ub Iwerks and was released less than a month after Springtime. The film stands in stark contrast to its predecessor, and almost feels more akin to the shorts that were produced by Fleischer Studios. Set in the depths of Hell and peopled by the Devil and an army of demons, it would fit in nicely as a companion to the beautifully bizarre Swing You Sinners! released in 1930, or Red Hot Mama featuring Betty Boop.\n\nIn a way, it could be seen as a sort of spiritual successor to Disney’s The Skeleton Dance, but the tone is darker. In a review of the piece, Variety provided a brief description of its plot writing, “Moving cartoon picturing Hades as the weirdest of places with its inhabitants in odd animal forms. All comedy of the ghost-story type. Such as one musician using the backbone and hips of a human as his cello. Another instrument in this band is a pool of bubbling lava, one of the devils piercing the bubbles with his spiked tail to make music. While Satan drinks his white-hot milk direct from the udder of a dragon cow.”\n\nAs with all of the previous Silly Symphony shorts, Carl Stalling was responsible for the music, and as he’d done in the previous pieces, he drew from the classical cannon to provide the soundtrack.\n\nIn the Hall of the Mountain King\n\nOne thing that becomes apparent over the course of the first few Silly Symphonies is that Carl Stalling seemed to have an affinity for the music of Edvard Grieg. His music was featured in The Skeleton Dance and Springtime. Hell’s Bells would mark the third time in four shorts that Disney would use Grieg’s music, and like the piece from Springtime, this short would make feature a composition from the play Peer Gynt.\n\nIn this case, the song is “In the Hall of the Mountain King” from the sixth scene of act 2. The name is an inexact translation, with the Norwegian title being, “I Dovregubbens hall.” “Dovre” refers to a mountainous area in Norway, and “gubbe” means “old man,” but was frequently used to refer to a male troll.\n\nIntroducing the scene in the play, Henrik Ibsen wrote, “There is a great crowd of troll courtiers, gnomes and goblins. Dovregubben sits on his throne, with crown and sceptre, surrounded by his children and relatives. Peer Gynt stands before him. There is a tremendous uproar in the hall.”\n\nIt’s appearance in Hell’s Bells occurs around the five minute mark in the short. The devil has demanded a demon come to him so he can be fed to his three headed hound, and the demon refuses. This leads to a wild chase through hell as Grieg’s music plays, ultimately ending when the devil falls off of a cliff and into the waiting flames below, leaving the disobedient demon triumphant.\n\nIt’s a piece that should be instantly recognizable, having made appearances in countless films, cartoons, video games and more. Several notable instances include Fritz Lang’s 1931 film M, the Oscar winning documentary Man on Wire, as the unofficial theme for the theme park Alton Towers, and even in an episode of Courage the Cowardly Dog.\n\nSpeaking of the composition, Grieg noted, “For the Hall of the Mountain King, I have written something that so reeks of cowpats, ultra-Norwegianism, and ‘to-thyself-be-enough-ness’ that I cannot bear to hear it, though I hope that the irony will make itself felt.”\n\nFuneral March of a Marionette\n\nAnother instantly recognizable piece of music featured in the short of Charles Gounod’s “Funeral March of a Marionette.” It’s a piece most associated with legendary film director Alfred Hitchcock, as it served as the theme music to his television program Alfred Hitchcock Presents.\n\nBorn in Paris in 1818, Gounod studied under Anton Reicha, a friend of Beethoven’s and a man described as “the greatest teacher then living.” He then attended the Conservatoire de Paris and won the highly prestigious Prix de Rome in 1839. After winning the award, he lived in Rome where he met pianist Fanny Hestel, who would eventually introduce Gounod to her brother, the composer Felix Mendelssohn.\n\nSpeaking of Mendelssohn (whom we’ll return to again later), if you read our previous post, The Music of El Terrible Toreador (Part 2), you may recall that the opening notes of his “Spring Song” were used in the short. At around the 1:15 mark of Hell’s Bells, the opening strains are used again in a “blink and you’ll miss it” passage when a serpent sprouts wings and flies away.\n\nWhile living in Prussia, Mendelssohn would heap praise on one of Gounod’s compositions, leading Gounod to say, “Words like this from such a master are a true honour and one wears them with more pride than many a ribbon.”\n\n“Funeral March of a Marionnete” was not written until many years later. Gounod originally intended it to be part of a larger work called Suite Burlesque. The “Funeral March…” was the only piece completed, and he later orchestrated it as a standalone, becoming one of the most popular compositions of his career.\n\nHebrides Overture\n\nIn our second post on the music of “El Terrible Toreador” we talked at length abot the life and career of Felix Mendelssohn, so we’ll avoid the biographical detail in this post. As mentioned above, a brief strain from “Spring Song” is used in Hell’s Bells, but it is not the only Mendelssohn composition to appear in the short.\n\nAt the 4:30 mark in the film, the Devil has just eaten a fiery meal and reaches out to snatch a demon and feed it to his dog. The music in this scene features the opening notes of Mendelssohn’s “The Hebrides (Overture).” They play as the first demon is eaten, and as the second demon refuses his fate, setting the scene for the transition into Grieg’s “In the Hall of the Mountain King.”\n\nComposed in 1830, the piece is an early example of a “tone poem,” a type of composition defined as “a piece of orchestral music, usually in a single continuous movement, which illustrates or evokes the content of a poem, short story, novel, painting, landscape, or other (non-musical) source.”\n\nIt was inspired by a visit to the Scottish Island of Staffa, and in particular by a visit to a location known as Fingal’s Cave. Mendelssohn originally titled the piece “To the Lonely Island” and it would later be printed under the name “Fingal’s Cave.”\n\nSpeaking of it, Johannes Brahms would declare, “ “I would gladly give all I have written, to have composed something like the Hebrides Overture.”\n\nMusical Dwarfs\n\nNext week, we’ll take a dive into Disney’s fifth Silly Symphony: “The Merry Dwarfs.” In a somewhat surprising twist, the short features neither the music of Grieg nor Mendelssohn. Tune in next Monday to discover the other classical composers that guided Carl Stalling and Walt Disney as they continued to create this legendary series of cartoons.\n\nIn the meantime, here’s where you can watch Hell’s Bells.\n\nClassical music can seem intimidating. It’s easy to view it as a musical form most suited to the ivory tower, reserved as it often is for concert halls. Not to mention that it is so frerquently treated as sacrosanct in comparison to more popular musical forms. But this often has less to do with the music itself than the atmosphere created around it.\n\nThe Silly Symphony series by Disney provide a perfect example of why. The cartoons made use of classical music, stripping the genre of its pretensions and placing it squarely in the world of popular entertainment.\n\nThe brainchild of Carl Stalling, the series helped revolutionize animation and is even responsible for rival studio Warner Bros. creating its Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series.\n\nSpringtime was the third film in the Silly Symphony series. Last week, we delved into the music of Edvard Grieg and Franz von Blon that appeared in the short, but they weren’t the only two pieces of classical music featured. Viewers were also treated to Amilcare Ponchielli’s “Dance of the Hours.”\n\nDance of the Hours\n\nA little over two minutes into the short, a rainstorm explodes on the scene pouring water onto the earth below. A tree bathes and dances in the shower before getting struck by lightning. We then see a pair of mushrooms that are revealed to be serving as umbrellas for two grasshoppers. As the last few drops of rain fall, the grasshoppers close their “umbrellas” and begin to dance. The music continues to accompany the action as the grasshoppers are eventually eaten by a frog, who then begins using cattails to recreate the melody and rhythm on the shells of turtles.\n\nThe music accompanying their frolic is a portion of Ponchielli’s “Dance of the Hours.” Those of a certain age will likely instantly recognize the tune as being the melody to Allan Sherman’s 1963 novelty hit “Hello Mudda, Hello Fadduh (A Letter from Camp)” as well as its sequel, “Return to Camp Granada” (released on 1965).\n\nOver the years the piece has been lovingly parodied and referenced in countless works. In 1940, Disney would again make use of it by including its entirety in a segment of the film Fantasia. A few years later, Al Sherman (father of Disney Legends Richard and Robert Sherman) would use segments of the piece for the song “Idle Chatter” which was recorded by the Andrews Sisters.\n\nDisney’s treatment of the song in Fantasia is of particular note because it is simultaneously a parody of classical ballet and a celebration of the art form. Disney animators used ballerinas as reference for their animation, including including Russian prima ballerina Irina Baronova.\n\nThe “Dance of the Hours” was written as a short ballet for the Act 3 finale of Ponchielli’s opera La Gioconda, which originally debuted in 1876. It had been commissioned two years prior by Giulio Ricordi of Casa Ricordi, a music publishing firm founded in 1801.\n\nBorn in 1834 in Paderno Fasolaro, Italy, Ponchielli earned a scholarship to the Milan Conservatory at the age of 9 and wrote his first symphony by age 10. A few years after leaving the conservatory he would compose his first opera, and would publish his second opera (I Promessi Sposi) when he was only 22. Despite this, he would not find any true musical success until he revised I Promessi Sposi in 1872 at the age of 38.\n\nFor La Gioconda, Arrigio Boito was asked to write the libretto with Ponchielli providing the music. However, Boito would write the text using the pseudonym Tobia Gorrio, an anagram of his actal name. The opera’s first performance was held at Teatro alla Scala in Milan, though Ponchielli would continue to revise the piece until 1879, when his fourth and final version debuted.\n\nPonchielli died seven years later at the age of 51, and the majority of his works would go unremembered (despite immense success during his lifetime). However, La Giaconda continues to be regularly performed and “Dance of the Hours” has become instantly recognizable, even to those generally unfamiliar with the opera.\n\nTo Offenbach or not to Offenbach?\n\nWhile researching this blog post, I came across several references that suggested that the short also incorporates music from Offenbach’s Gaîté Parisienne, a classic ballet perhaps best remembered for its lively can-can.\n\nBased on my own personal viewings of the film and consulting with others who have watched it, I was unable to identify any music from the ballet within Springtime. While I could be mistaken, due to an inability to find any specific reference to which piece from Gaîté Parisienne was used, or where in the short it may have appeared, I have decided to leave it out. Should I find any more detail in the future the substantiates the claim, I am happy to revise and include notes on the piece.\n\nOne month after the release of El Terrible Toreador, Disney released its third Silly Symphony. Titled Springtime, it received immediate praise with The Film Daily declaring, “This is called a Disney Silly Symphony, and it is a corker. The cartoon work is about the best that has ever been seen in the animated field, the expressions and general antics of the animals being unusually clever as well as true to life.” Variety was equally effusive in its praise, declaring, “In Springtime Disney has sought to express that vernal feeling of animated insect, animal and flower characters in novel dance routines set to intriguing musical numbers. Timing of the dances, the accompanying taps, etc., is so perfect that the rhythm alone imparts rare entertainment value to this new one in the Silly Symphony series. Every opportunity to inject comedy for laughs has also been seized.”\n\nIn terms of plot, the short has more in common with The Skeleton Dance than its immediate predecessor, which is to say that there’s no real plot to speak of. Though the plot of El Terrible Toreador was fairly thin, it at least hinted at the story of Bizet’s Carmen. In contrast, and like The Skeleton Dance, Springtime was more evocative of a mood and a moment in time than a true story. While The Skeleton Dance suggested the events of a dark October night, Springtime evokes the season it was named after.\n\nMorning Mood\n\nThe film opens with an idyllic scene. Trees and flowers are dancing in a field while butterflies flit about. In the background, a waterfall feeds into a stream. In the background, we hear the sound of birds chirping mixed with the opening strains of Edvard Grieg’s “Morning Mood.”\n\nThe film marked the second time in three cartoons that Carl Stalling and the Silly Symphony team at Disney had used the music of Grieg. His “The March of the Dwarfs” provided the soundtrack to The Skeleton Dance earlier in the year.\n\nThe song “Morning Mood” was written as part of Grieg’s work composing music for his friend Henrik Ibsen’s five-act play Peer Gynt (which was written in verse). While Grieg was honored to take part in the project, he found it particularly challenging, telling a friend, “Peer Gynt progresses slowly and there is no possibility of having it finished by autumn. It is a terribly unmanageable subject.”\n\nThe work seemed to affect him deeply, and his wife noted, “the more he saturated his mind with the powerful poem, the more clearly he saw that he was the right man for a work of such witchery and so permeated with the Norwegian spirit.”\n\n“Morning Mood” was written for the fourth scene of act four which finds the play’s titular character stranded in the desert in Morocco. Speaking of the piece, Grieg visualized, “the sun breaking through the clouds at the first forte.” As noted in the liner notes for Naxos’s release of the music, “This produces an unusual musical form: the climax comes early on, and the day then settles down to rest. Towards the end we hear imitations of birdsong. The incessant flowing figures suggest associations with waves on the seashore, or with wind. Or they could be sounds in Peer Gynt’s head. Grieg asked that the piece ‘be treated as pure music’, and as such it has a unique place in the drama.”\n\nThe piece is used for no more than a few seconds in Springtime, just long enough to evoke the feeling of a new day before the music gives way to Franz von Blon’s “Whispering Flowers (Blumengeflüster).”\n\nWhispering Flowers\n\nWith the idylls of the new day past, the plants and animals set about their daily activities. It starts innocently enough, with a trio of flowers dancing across the screen in unison and a pair of ladybugs dancing together atop an open flower. We then see a caterpillar hopping and dancing along the ground, until he is somewhat unceremoniously eaten piece by piece by a crow in a stovepipe hat.\n\nThis dynamic plays out through the remainder of the short, with animals enjoying a peaceful and charming life out in the wild only to be promptly devoured by a predator who then goes about it’s own day, enjoying the beauty and freshness of a spring morning, all while Blon’s jaunty melody plays in the background.\n\nBorn in Berlin, Germany in 1861, Blon began playing the violin at a young age and attended Stern’s Conservatory of Music. It was a great testament ot his skill, and he was one of only 6 students accepted out of 123 who applied.\n\nFrom 1880-1883, he fulfilled his military obligations as part of the 12th Infantry Regiment at Frankfurt. It was during this time that he began composing. He would later become konzertmaster at the Hamburg Municipal Theatre before founding the Berlin Philharmonic Wind Orchestra. The group became quite famous, and he toured with them internationally, including a performance at the 1904 St. Louis World’s Fair.\n\nWhile he was primarily known for composing marches, he did create other pieces of music, including “Whispering Flowers (Blumengeflüster).” The piece was first published in 1894 and alternates between moments of slow, serene beauty and an uptempo, playful melody. It’s a perfect compliment for the onscreen action.\n\nOffenbach and Beyond\n\nIn addition to the work of von Blon and Grieg, Springtime also features music by Amilcare Ponchielli (who would also be featured in Disney’s 1940 animated masterpiece Fantasia).\n\nNext week, we’ll wrap up our dive into Springtime by taking a look at Ponchielli’s contributions to the piece.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that you could pack the highlights of an opera, an Italian ballad, an old folk song, and a masterpiece of German classical music into a single cartoon short, but Disney managed to do just that in El Terrible Toreador, not to mention some incidental music composed by Carl Stallings.\n\nLast week, we talked about the music of George Bizet’s Carmen and Alberto Pestolazza’s “Ciribiribin,” both of which are featured in the short (which was Disney’s second Silly Symphony). But the music doesn’t stop there. The short also contains very brief references to two other well-known pieces of music, though they’re such tiny moments in the film that you’d be forgiven for missing them.\n\nYankee Doodle Went to Town\n\nThe melody to the classic folk tune “Yankee Doodle” somewhat inexplicably appears in the cartoon as the toreador and the soldier bicker over the affections of Carmencita. After the toreador blows foam from a stein of beer into the soldier’s face, the soldier grows so angry that his shirt and pants burst open, revealing his underwear. The bullfighter and Carmen begin laughing at the soldier, and the tune of their laughter is the song “Yankee Doodle.”\n\nIt’s hard to think of a reason why this particular tune is included in the short, which is set in Spain. The traditionally accepted origins of the song date back to the days of Colonial America. The melody was already well known, but the words that are known today were penned by a doctor named Richard Shuckberg. The term “Yankee Doodle” was meant to be derisive. As the Kennedy Center notes in a piece about the songs history, “In the song, Schuckberg referred to the American fighter as both a ‘doodle’—a country hick, and a ‘dandy’—a conceited jerk. No one has ever figured out exactly where the term “Yankee” comes from. One guess is that “Yankee” started as the nickname “Little Jan” used by Dutch settlers at the time. But the Brits used it to mock all American colonists.”\n\nThe song was played by British soldiers as they marched along the colonial countryside during the American Revolutionary War. As the story goes, after repelling one attack by the British, American militiamen sang the song as the British soldiers retreated, even calling out “ “How do you like us Yankee doodles and dandies, now?”\n\nAll of which is great history, but does very little to clear up why it was included in a short set in Spain. Unfortunately, a deeper dig into the song doesn’t yield many answers.\n\nWhile the lyrics were written around 1755, the melody is said to be much older. Some musical scholars have asserted that it stems from an Irish tune known as “All the Way to Galway,” whose history is said to be Jacobite in origin (a political movement that lasted from the late 17th century through the mid-18th).\n\nThis still doesn’t capture the whole story, as the earliest known lyrics date all the way back to a Middle Dutch harvest song that traces its origins all the way back to Holland in the 15th century. None of which tells us how it ended up being used as a taunt in a 20th century cartoon set in Spain.\n\nSongs Without Words\n\nThe next musical inclusion in the film is Felix Mendelssohn’s “Spring Song” or “Song Without Words, Op. 62 No. 6.” Its appearance in the short may take up even less screen time than the brief reference to “Yankee Doodle,” lasting only a few seconds near the very end of the film.\n\nIt happens during the bull fight scene. The character of Carmen has just tossed the toreador a bouquet of flowers, unaware that the soldier has spiked the flowers with black pepper. The bullfighter and the bull both take a deep whiff of the flowers, which causes the bull to sneeze so hard that his teeth fall out of his mouth. As the pair inhale, the opening notes Mendelssohn’s “Spring Song” play.\n\nBorn Jakob Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy in 1809, Mendelssohn was the grandson of Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, and the brother of composer and pianist Fanny Mendelssohn.\n\nHe began studying music at the age of six, and at seven entered the tutelage of pianist and composer Marie Bigot. He would later study under Ludwig Berger and Carl Friederich Zelter. His first public performance came at the age of nine, and he was already composing with great regularity by the time he was a teen. Between the ages of 12-14, he wrote 13 string symphonies. A few years later, he composed his “String Octet in E Flat major” and an overture inspired by Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream.\n\n“Songs Without Words” was a series of short, lyrical piano pieces which Mendelssohn wrote between 1829 and 1845. “Spring Song” was part of Book 5, Opus 62 which was published between 1842-1844. It was also known as “Camberwell Green” for a location in London where he stayed while writing the piece.\n\nSadly, his life would be almost as brief as George Bizet’s, living a mere two years longer. Mendelssohn died at age 38 after a series of strokes.\n\nIt seems odd to end our trip into the second Silly Symphony on such a grim note, but for a cartoon that ends with the evisceration of a bull, maybe it’s just as well. A dark ending for a surprisingly dark cartoon.\n\nNext week, we’ll jump into the music of the third Silly Symphony simply titled Springtime, which the Film Daily referred to as, “ …about the best that has ever been seen in the animated field.”\n\nThe Music of El Terrible Toreador (Part 1)\n\nDisney’s second Silly Symphony, the six minute short El Terrible Toreador debuted in September of 1929, just one month after the release of the ground breaking film The Skeleton Dance. It’s a peculiar piece of cinema with a particularly gruesome ending, but it’s still an entertaining watch with some interesting musical moments.\n\nAs with The Skeleton Dance, Carl Stalling worked on the film’s music. He had joined the company in 1928 as its first music director. Stalling created the score, blending music penned by composers Georges Bizet, Alberto Pestalozza, and Felix Mendelssohn, as well as the brief use of a classic folk melody. The soundtrack was then recorded in Los Angeles, a change from the first Silly Symphony, whose soundtrack had been recorded in New York.\n\nThe film’s story is, at least loosely, inspired by George Bizet’s opera Carmen. That said, it only has the vague hint of a plot. It features a voracious soldier and a bull fighter (whose physical depiction is said to have been inspired by Walt Disney) duking it out over the affections of a woman. There is also a bull fight. Unlike the opera, our female protagonist does not end up dead. The bull is not so lucky. Though he isn’t struck by the sword, as is the tradition in bullfighting, he ends up being pulled completely inside out. It’s a shockingly gory end and serves as the film’s final image.\n\nMotion Picture News reviewed the film stating, “O.K. For Laughs. This is a cartoon burlesque of Carmen in tabloid form. The music of the opera is used for the accompaniment. Filled with laughs, the bull wrestling and throwing which is the final touch is sure to get over. Go to it on this one.” Heaping higher praise on El Terrible Toreador, The Film Daily referred to it as, “almost a continuous riot from start to finish.”\n\nThe Composer\n\nBorn in 1838 in Paris, France, Bizet was a Romantic composer of middling success until the release of Carmen. That all changed when it was suggested that Bizet work with librettists Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy.\n\nBizet suggested that they create an opera built around the novella Carmen by Prosper Mérimée (which itself may have been inspired by Alexander Pushkin’s poem “The Gypsies”). Right away, he realized that he had created something special, stating, “They make out that I am obscure, complicated, tedious, more fettered by technical skill than lit by inspiration. Well, this time I have written a work that is full of clarity and vivacity, full of colour and melody.”\n\nUnfortunately, critics hated the piece, referring to it as vulgar, and Bizet died a few months after its debut believing the piece to be a failure. Little did he know that within a few years, the piece would be appearing in almost every opera house of note throughout the continent. To this day, it remains of the most popular and oft performed operas ever written.\n\nDisney Goes to the Opera\n\nThe cartoon opens with the melody of “Votre toast, je peux vous le rendre” or the “Toreador Song,” one of the most popular pieces from Bizet’s Carmen. Tunes from the opera are peppered throughout the short, but this seems a fitting introduction with its jaunty, up-tempo praise of the classic opera’s bullfighter. The piece appears again in the cartoon during the introduction of the bullfighter.\n\nAs the film moves from its title screen to its opening sequence, a waitress carryies a tray with a stein of beer while the music transitions into “L’amour est un oiseau rebelle,” more commonly known as the “Habanera.” Fans of classic cartoons have likely heard the song countless times, even if they didn’t know it by name.\n\nThe common name “Habanera” refers to a popular type of music (also known as the contradanza or country danse) popular in the 18th century. Though it is one of Bizet’s best known pieces, the melody is not actually his. He adopted the tune from the piece “El Arreglito ou la Promesse de mariage” by Spanish composer Sebastián Yradier.\n\nAt the time of composition, Bizet believed the melody to be a folk tune, only to later learn that it had been originally published in 1863. Yradier had only died a mere decade before the debut of Carmen. Upon learning this, Bizet added a note to his publication of the vocal score indicating the tunes origins.\n\nLater in the short, we also hear pieces of Carmen’s “Overture,” another recognizable piece that is used to introduce the bullfight in the cartoon.\n\nA Merry Piedmontese Ballad\n\nThe next piece of music featured in the short is the Italian song “Ciribiribin.” It is used briefly as our waitress character, Carmencita, begins dancing for the soldier. She hums the song’s melody while hitting herself on the head and posterior with her drink tray. When she’s finished, the soldier bursts out with applause before tossing her a coin.\n\nOriginally written in 1898, the song was composed by Alberto Pestalozza with lyrics by Carlo Tiochet. Its original language was Piedmontese from the Piedmont region in Italy. Despite occasionally being mistaken for an Italian dialect, linguists actually consider it a unique language of its own.\n\nTiochet (born Carlo Alfredo Occhetti) was born January 1, 1863 and moved to Turin (the capital of the Piedmont region). He learned the language and began writing in it. He became so comfortable in it that he jokingly referred to himself as, “Tuscan by mistake.”\n\nHe founded a weekly known as “La birichina” while also writing comedies and song lyrics, including collaborations with Alberto Pestalozza.\n\nFor his part, Pestalozza was born in Turin in 1851. He studied at the Music Institute of the City of Turin and then began writing musical comedies and operettas.\n\nBoth men would be primarily remembered for “Ciribiribin,” which was published by Edizioni musicali Carisch, an Italian music publishing company. The song was an immediate success, particularly due to a performance by Austrian soubrette Mitzi Kirchner.\n\nOver the years, the song has been recorded by Italian artists like Renato Carosone and Mario Lanza, as well as international musicians such as Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters, Frank Sinatra, and many more.\n\nIt’s a bit of a curious inclusion in the cartoon, given that the cartoon is ostensibly set in Spain. But two of the remaining musical selections in the piece were even more unusual. In next week’s blog post, we’ll take a look at how a German composer and a centuries old folk tune from Ireland entered the picture as well."
