        "text": "For the one person or so who is still following this blog, I just thought I’d let you know that the collaborative blog On the Ones is indeed active again, under my supervision, and this blog is henceforth extinct. I have posted the first part of my write-up on Czech animation master Břetislav Pojar, along with the first part of an interview with the legendary animator Sadao Tsukioka in which he talks about early anime and limited animation, in the process bringing up American animation.\n\nLots more exciting things to come on the ones, not just from me but from others!\n\n-Toadette 😉\n\nFrédéric Back is easily one of the most distinctive filmmakers to have arisen in animation in the past century. Unlike other independent animators in Canada, he did not work for the National Film Board of Canada, but for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, specifically its French-language branch Radio-Canada, creating nine films over a period of roughly 25 years; in his first several films, Back never stuck to one animated medium, changing mediums from film to film out of both necessity and experimentation. He would adapt his trademark technique of drawing on frosted cels beginning with Tout rien in 1978.\n\nI admit I am somewhat ambivalent about Back’s films. I love their artistry, and I appreciate the sincerity, humanity, and love of the natural world that drives them; yet at the same time, I can’t say I agree wholeheartedly with the overt environmentalism on display in them, especially in the earlier films up to Tout rien. In that regard, those early films often feel didactic, at times even patronizing, and it doesn’t rub me quite right.\n\nBack finally struck excellence in his last few films, expressing his worldview in poetic ways that, perhaps, will remain unparalleled in animation for decades to come. His hand is fully present in these last few films in a way matched by few other animated films; through their gorgeous, transformative animation, these masterworks capture the beauty of nature and of humanity, but are not afraid to indict the latter for its vices against the former or even itself.\n\nThe first film of his late period, Crac, is an impressionistic, nostalgic ode to the unique Quebecois culture of his adapted country, largely abandoned in the face of modernization. It was inspired by a story written as a French homework assignment by his then ten-year-old daughter Süzel, about a old rocking chair that is no longer appreciated. Continue reading →\n\nToo often in animation, the parts are better than the whole. Too often, animated art films come off self-indulgent in their attempts to be artistic. Osamu Tezuka’s Mermaid, one of several experimental cartoons Tezuka made from the 1960s onward, strikes me as a good example of both these problems; it has the makings of a potentially great cartoon, but the execution only highlights how incongruous those parts are in general, and results in a cartoon that, while interesting, is not particularly great overall.\n\nThe film has as its theme the power of imagination as opposed to stark, mind-stifling totalitarianism: a boy saves a fish that becomes a mermaid and falls in love with her, but his parents see only a fish, and from there he is shipped off to a reeducation camp; when he escapes back to his house, he initially discovers to his horror that the mermaid is just a fish—but miraculously, as he returns the fish to the sea, it turns back into a mermaid, much to the astonishment of the reeducation camp officials gathered on the beach. Unfortunately, Tezuka chose to set the film to Debussy’s Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun, a tone poem that, while certainly touching and evocative, is not quite suited to the subject matter. The result is that, for much of the film, the music plays a superfluous role, droning on as a boy is brainwashed, tickle-tortured, and made to look at mermaids with nonhuman upper bodies, seemingly there just to lend the film an affected air; only in the film’s more poetic sequences on the beach, particularly involving the courtship between the boy and the mermaid, does Debussy’s lulling, romantic music truly shine, and even then the lack of synchronization in the animation can be off-putting, like when the boy smashes into a seashell while playfully chasing the mermaid in the ocean.\n\nThe production design only adds to the film’s sense of incongruous pretentiousness. The (literally) transparent character designs go beyond the UPA studio in terms of stylization, to the point that they basically are arrangements of polygons; I am not against extreme stylization on principle, but, taken on their own, the designs strike me as cold, almost emblematic of the inhuman mentality the film ostensibly protests against. Only through Shigeru Yamamoto’s at times lively animation (assisted by Kiyomi Numamoto) are the designs imbued with any warmth; he manages to squeeze out a few lovely moments of character animation, yet ultimately they are never quite enough to overcome the coldness of the designs or even of the film in general. The visual experimental confusion is reinforced in the backgrounds, which range from minimalistic and abstract (rooms constructed entirely of lines with one or two colors, the dry-brushed beaches and skies) to comparatively lavish (the underwater world, the boy’s neighborhood).\n\nMermaid begs to be judged by high standards for an animated film, and by those standards, it is a failed experiment. There is the sense that it could have been a better film had Tezuka integrated its elements more tightly into a satisfying whole, rather than pretentiously presenting them as if art music and artistic design/animation tied together by a timely theme add up to greater art on principle. While I do not hate the film—certainly it deserves more respect than the reams of truly bad pretentious animation out there—it is nevertheless a case where artistic indulgence can cause what could have been an effective film to suffer.\n\n(Originally published on the now-defunct collaborative blog On the Ones around 10:33 PM Central Time, on 7 August 2016.)\n\nPinscreen animation is not well-known among most animation fans, understandably: not very many films have been made using the painstaking medium to begin with, and even then they are far removed from standard mediums of animation aesthetically and thematically. But anyone who seeks the best of them out will be rewarded with surreal, often impressionistic gems that open up new possibilities for animated expression.\n\nThe pinscreen is a device consisting of several (as in, up to over a million) small pins in holes; with some effort, the pins can be pushed into and out of their holes. The screen is then lit from an angle such that the pins create varying shadows, depending on how much they protrude from the screen; taken together, the shadows can create images that resemble engravings, complete with chiaroscuro (striking use of light and dark shadings). As the images are viewed directly at the front of the screen, the pins themselves do not affect any one given image more than they do another, no matter how far out they stick.\n\nThere is one big problem, though: it is difficult and time-consuming to manipulate the pinscreen in order to create the desired images, let alone animate them. The device was created by Alexandre Alexeieff and Claire Parker in the early 1930s, and they would create a number of interesting films over a span of several decades, two of the most notable being Night on Bald Mountain (set to Mussorgsky’s famous piece as arranged by Rimsky-Korsakov) and The Nose (from the Gogol short story of the same name). In 1972, the National Film Board of Canada acquired a pinscreen, and Alexeieff and Parker were invited to demonstrate the device to the animators there.\n\nHowever, only UCLA-returned newcomer Jacques Drouin, who had been acquainted with pinscreen animation since seeing The Nose at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in the 60s, would use the pinscreen regularly and explore its capabilities. Carrying on Alexeieff’s legacy, between 1974 and 2004 Drouin made six films at the NFBC using the pinscreen (one, Nightangel, in collaboration with Czech stop-motion animator Břetislav Pojar), as well as a segment for Kihachiro Kawamoto’s collaborative film Winter Days.\n\nPerhaps his most well-known film, if not his masterpiece, is Mindscape, released in 1976.\n\nContinue reading →\n\n(Originally published on the now-defunct collaborative blog On the Ones around 11:32 PM Central Time, on 15 July 2016.)\n\nAnyone who is even slightly familiar with American animation history has probably heard the name of Chuck Jones. One of the most distinctive and recognizable filmmakers to arise during the Golden Age of American animation, during the 1940s and 50s Jones put out a slew of often truly great shorts at the Warner Bros. cartoon studio, including several of the most well-known WB shorts (The Dover Boys, Haredevil Hare, Rabbit Hood, Long-Haired Hare, Barber of Seville, Rabbit Seasoning, Bully for Bugs, Duck Amuck, Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2th Century, One Froggy Evening, What’s Opera, Doc?, and the Road Runner cartoons, to name just a few). What makes Jones’s best films stand out are their impeccably-drawn-and-animated characters, the characters’ own animated humanity as sharply expressed in their poses and facial expressions, the cinematic layouts (most likely inherited from fellow WB director Frank Tashlin), a willingness to experiment with any element of a film, and a subtle sense of both sophistication and cynicism.\n\nIn addition to working with (and often tweaking) established characters like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, Jones and his collaborator, writer Mike Maltese, came up with several of their own memorable characters, some more well-known than others (the aforementioned Road Runner and his nemesis, Wile E. Coyote, being two of the most well-known). These characters generally starred in their own cartoons, or co-starred with the more established characters, or (in the case of Jones’s dysfunctional Three Bears) even both. At times, these “lesser” characters could even co-star with each other.\n\nChuck Jones’s 1954 classic, Feline Frame-Up, is not only a great example of the latter, but also a great example of Jones’s 1950s films in general.\n\nContinue reading →\n\n(Originally published on the now-defunct collaborative blog On the Ones around 12:16 AM Central Time, on 5 July 2016.)\n\nTadanari Okamoto was one of the greatest Japanese independent animators, although he remains largely unknown outside Japan. Through his production company Echo Inc., he and his dedicated staff made several films in which he, though mostly known as a stop-motion animator, constantly experimented with the capabilities of animation, changing the medium or type of animation he used in each film. What made his films particularly special, however, was that they were not purely experimental; he sought to make animated films, making sure that all the elements, like the animation type, the story, and the music, cohered to make something greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nOkamoto made a fair number of masterpieces, most notably The Monkey and the Crab, Praise Be To Small Ills, The Water Seed, Towards the Rainbow, The Soba Flower of Mt. Oni, The Magic Ballad, and The Restaurant of Many Orders (completed posthumously by his colleague Kihachiro Kawamoto, a famed stop-motion animator in his own right), though practically all his films are worth watching for the artistry and stories. In the latter regard, several of his films, including all the films listed above, were based on folktales or stories written by others; a number of his films do have original stories by himself, however.\n\nAn original story is just one of the many unique elements that comprise The Forgotten Doll, an offbeat film that Okamoto produced in 1980.
