It was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. The shorts were initially produced by Leon Schlesinger and animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising until 1933. It ran concurrently with its sister series Merrie Melodies from 1931 onward. Schlesinger assumed full production under Leon Schlesinger Productions from 1933 until 1944, after which he sold it to Warner Bros. and renamed to Warner Bros. Cartoons.\n\nLooney Tunes was an important part in forming what would become known as the Golden Age of animation, developing and/or creating a legacy of memorable and enduring characters such as Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, Sylvester, Tweety, Granny, the Tasmanian Devil, Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, Pepé Le Pew, Foghorn Leghorn, Speedy Gonzales; and last but certainly not least, Bugs Bunny.\n\nFollowing its revival in 1987, new theatrical shorts continue to be released sporadically. The main Looney Tunes cast, dubbed simply as \"the Looney Tunes\" themselves, have also crossed over into other media, such as television series and specials, full-length direct-to-video and theatrical films, comic books, and video games.\n\nProduction\n\nMusic\n\nThe music was composed by a number of artists including Carl W. Stalling, who scored it from 1936 to 1958, in addition to orchestrations by Milt Franklyn; the latter took over as musical director after Stalling's retirement. When Franklyn died in 1962, William Lava took over until the end of the series's original run in 1969. Some of the other composers in the series include Bernard B. Brown, Norman Spencer, Eugene Poddany, John Seely, Walter Greene, Richard Stone, and Christopher Lennertz.\n\nBeginning in 1937, the primary theme music for the series was \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\" by Cliff Friend and Dave Franklin.\n\nShorts\n\nSinkin' in the Bathtub -
