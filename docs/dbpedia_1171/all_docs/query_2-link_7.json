        "text": "Welcome to Toonheads! This week, we take a look at \"Feline Frame Up\" (1954), for a sort of continuation of this Chuck Jones theme that has carried on for the last two discussions. In this cartoon, Chuck Jones pairs Marc Anthony and Pussyfoot (see: \"Feed the Kitty\", \"Kiss Me Cat\") with Claude Cat. Claude is less of a cowardly neurotic and more of a jealous troublemaker in this cartoon, as he competes with the dog and kitten for the right to sleep on a soft, cozy pillow.\n\nIn my opinion it's one of the greatest Looney Tunes ever made, and it's certainly in my top ten favorites list...high up there. What do YOU think?\n\n-Matthew\n\nI'm not sure but isn't this the verst cartoon where Claude Cat speaks?\n\n\"Just one of those days I guess!\"\n\nI remember when Nickelodeon used play this a lot. It was an okay cartoon. I like Feed the Kitty better though.\n\nAnother great one!\n\nI particularly enjoy the scene that the picture above is from. Watching Mark Anthony trying to get away with everything he can possibly do to Claude before letting him go is hilarious.\n\nI like all the Marc Antony/Pussyfoot cartoons very much, except for the lackluster series closer \"Cat Feud\". \"Feline Frame-Up\" shows NO sympathy for Claude Cat; this is his most villainous role, I'd say.\n\nHere's a recent piece from an Australian film journal that discusses the film (as well as \"What's Opera, Doc?\" and \"Rabbit Fire\"):\n\nhttp://www.sensesofcinema.com/conte...ats_opera_doc_rabbit_fire_feline_frameup.html\n\n\"But with its themes of overwrought domestic violence and suppressed sexual malaise and the use of elaborate frame-within-frame compositions, Feline Frame-up ought to be considered alongside the great 1950s Technicolor melodramas of Minnelli, Ray and Sirk.\"\n\nI also contributed a humble piece to the issue, which was featuring a focus on Chuck Jones:\n\nhttp://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/03/28/cteq/chuck_jones/scarlet_pumpernickel_steal_wool.html\n\nEnjpyable use of Marc A., Claude, Pussyfoot AND a shared master (no housewife though, and his face gets to appear). The pet-owner constantly throws M.A. out (so he has someone ELSE besides Claude to deal with). But Marc A.does get Claude to sign a confession and either M.A., the master or both kick him out but one thing is clear--the bu8lldog and kitten stay with the matser,Claude doesn'ty. (The master's voice is courtesy of Robert C.Bruce, who usually narrated cartoons but also did some onscreen character voices as well.)\n\nThe theme music (don't know the name) is also heard in many 40s cartoons incl. \"A Tale of Two Mice\" (1946).\n\nWell constructed, beautiful timing, and violent gags. Claude really gets the hell beat out of him in this one! Jones is in top form.\n\nI especially like how M.A. uses a balloon to unlock the door to regain entry, as Claude watches.\n\nI haven't seen this cartoon many times, and I had to watch my copy before I can post any comments on it. Although it is not one of my favourite Chuck Jones cartoons, it is funny. Great gags, good timing, and a fine story.\n\ncabe624 said:\n\nThe scene where Claude is making faces at Marc Anthony, so Anthony slams his foot on a board, launching Claude into the ceiling inside is, to me, laugh out loud hilarious.\n\nI agree. That was the funniest scene in the cartoon.\n\nLet's inject some trivia!\n\nOK, Howcome, when Marc Anthony steps off the distance between Claude and the side of the house, then re-steps that distance in the basement, does the circle he cuts in the floor end up getting the master instead of Claude?\n\nThis time. there really IS a logical explanation - an oddity for a cartoon, but there it is!\n\nbtw - I love it - both Marc Anthony/Pussyfoot AND Claude (now, if he'd just worked in Hubie/Bertie and Frisky Puppy...)\n\nSo much for trying to pique this group's curiosity\n\nAnyway, the answer is:\n\nThe basement stairs run along the line he wants to measure - therefore, when he starts to pace off the distance in the basement, he should have started at the exterior wall - but he started at the bottom of the stairs.\n\nHis location was off by the length of the run (horizontal dimension) of the stairs.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nI will now yield the floor back to the crickets\n\nBrandon Pierce said:\n\nI'm not sure but isn't this the verst cartoon where Claude Cat speaks?\n\n\"Just one of those days I guess!\"\n\nI remember when Nickelodeon used play this a lot. It was an okay cartoon. I like Feed the Kitty better though.\n\nActually, Claude spoke before, particularly in \"The Hypo-Chrondiac Cat\" and \"Cheese Chasers.\""
