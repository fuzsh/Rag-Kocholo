        "text": "The Queen’s Cartoonists bring cartoons, music, and comedy to the Scherr Forum, Wednesday, March 22, 2023, at 7:00 pm.\n\nThe Queen’s Cartoonists (TQC) perform music from cartoons! Pulling from over 100 years of animation, TQC’s performances are perfectly synchronized to the films projected on stage. The band matches the energy of the cartoons, leading the audience through a world of virtuosic musicianship, multi-instrumental mayhem, and comedy.\n\nProjections of animated films dazzle the audience, while the band re-creates original soundtracks note-for-note, or writes their own fresh compositions to modern pieces, all the while breathing new life into two uniquely American forms of art: jazz and animation. Tying everything together is the TQC brand of comedy – anecdotes about the cartoons and their composers, stream-of-consciousness humor, and elements of a musical circus.\n\nWatch your favorite classic cartoon characters interact with the musicians on stage and expect the unexpected from the Golden Age of Animation, cult cartoon classics, and modern animated films. Inspired by the cross-roads of jazz, classical music, and cartoons, TQC features Jazz Age composers like Carl Stalling, Raymond Scott, and Duke Ellington, alongside classical giants Mozart, Rossini, and R. Strauss (to name just a few).\n\nSince their inception in 2015, the band, hailing from as far away as Australia, Bulgaria, and Washington, D.C., now all reside in Queens, New York, and are a creative part of the New York jazz scene. The band has brought their unique concert experience to performing arts centers, clubs, and festivals across the United States and Europe.\n\nSingle tickets are on sale and priced at $50 – $60. Tickets are available from online at www.ticketmaster.com, or through the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza Box Office, located at 2100 Thousand Oaks Boulevard.
