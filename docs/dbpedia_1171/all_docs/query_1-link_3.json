        "text": "Carl W. Stalling was a noted twentieth century American music composer and arranger. He is most noted for his musical scores for the \"Looney Tunes,\" a popular Warner Brothers animated cartoon series. Among the most famous of these musical pieces is \"What's Up Doc,\" the Bugs Bunny theme song. Stalling also produced musical scores for Walt Disney productions, and he was a silent film piano and organ player. Stalling received a U.S. patent in 1924 for his tick method of recording and depicting motion pictures. This method became a motion picture industry standard. Stalling was born in Lexington, Missouri, in 1891. He studied at the Kansas City Conservatory of Music, and it was here where he met his wife, Gladys Baldwin. He died in 1972, in Hollywood, California.\n\nThe Carl W. Stalling Papers contain original music scores and cue sheets done by Stalling for Warner Brothers cartoons and for Walt Disney productions. Also contained in the collection is published music from various composers, much of which is sheet music from the 1920s and 1930s. There are photographs, mostly from the 1940s and 1950s, of celebrities that Stalling associated with, and there are some subject files related to the music industry. A small amount of correspondence and biographical material is included."
