        "text": "With cats having been adored for many millennia, it’s no surprise that there are numerous songs dedicated to them. You can find all sorts of songs throughout the decades that describe many people’s experiences with cats. Some people write about how beautiful their cats are, while others will sing about how unpredictable they can be.\n\nIt’s impossible to mention all the existing songs about cats, so we’ve compiled a list that contains a wide variety of cat songs written and produced by all kinds of artists. Here are some wonderful songs about cats that you’ll love listening to with your cat this year and beyond.\n\nTop 20 Songs About Cats\n\n1. “The Love Cats” by The Cure\n\nThis song was written by Robert Smith and was first created as a parody song. However, it became very successful and ended up being number 7 in the Top 10 hits in the UK. The song is a mix of jazz, new wave, and pop, and it has a catchy, upbeat tone.\n\nCat fans will love this song even more when they watch the music video. There are multiple cats in every frame, and the band members are also seen dancing around in cat costumes.\n\n2. “Kitty” by The Presidents of The United States of America\n\n“Kitty” was supposedly inspired by a real cat that Chris Ballew used to live with at his apartment in Boston. The song talks about a man wanting to pet an outdoor cat. However, the cat scratches him, and the cat is left to spend the night outside.\n\nThe music video was shot from a cat’s perspective. It starts with a cat running around the neighborhood and ends with one of the band members giving them cat food before they run off again.\n\n3. “Cat People (Putting Out Fire)” by David Bowie\n\nThis song was released in 1981 and faced commercial success. It topped music charts in the UK, US, New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden. It’s also considered to be one of the best recordings by David Bowie in the 1980s. The song was edited several times, and you can find several different versions of it.\n\n4. “Pads, Paws & Claws” by Elvis Costello\n\nThis song was written by Elvis Costello and Paul McCartney and was recorded and released in 1989 in Costello’s album Spike. The album was Costello’s 12th studio album, and it was the top fifth album on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nDespite being an upbeat song, the lyrics of “Pads, Paws & Claws” talk about a tumultuous relationship. If you like the song, you may appreciate listening to its extended version.\n\n5. “Satellite Moments (Light Up the Sky)” by Charlie Fink\n\n“Satellite Moments (Light Up the Sky)” doesn’t explicitly mention anything about cats, but it was written and recorded for the original motion picture soundtrack of A Street Cat Named Bob. This movie was based on a memoir written by author James Bowen.\n\nBowen and Bob’s story is a classic case of a cat adopting a human. Bob kept returning to Bowen’s apartment until Bowen officially took him in. Bob and Bowen became well-known on the Internet, as multiple videos of them busking in Covent Garden were uploaded.\n\n6. “Stray Cat Strut” by Stray Cats\n\n“Stray Cat Strut” was released in the UK in 1981 and in the US in the following year. It just missed placing in the Billboard Hot 100 chart by landing at number 109. However, Stray Cats’ next single, “Rock This Town,” made the top 10, and the band’s record company decided to re-release “Stray Cat Strut.” The song’s second release debuted at number 43 and peaked at number 3.\n\n7. “My Cat’s Name Is Maceo” by Jane’s Addiction\n\nThis song was inspired by Perry Farrell’s cat, Maceo. It’s a playful song about their bond and describes how Farrell first met Maceo and what life with Maceo is like.\n\nMaceo was named after jazz horn player Maceo Parker. When Jane’s Addiction decided to update the demo version of this song, they enlisted the help of Maceo Parker. The horn instrumentals that you hear in this version were played by Maceo Parker himself.\n\n8. “Everybody Wants to Be a Cat” from The Aristocats\n\nThis song is a classic and beloved by Disney fans and cat fans alike. Its jazzy, upbeat tune accurately depicts how carefree and playful cats can be. The bright and fun music and animation are also a welcome break from the cats navigating the streets while trying to return home. Once you listen to this song, it’ll be difficult to get its catchy chorus out of your head.\n\n9. “Cool Cat” by Queen\n\n“Cool Cat” was released in 1982 and was included in one of Queen’s most experimental albums, Hot Space.

The song’s lyrics are open to interpretation, but Freddie Mercury did state that the song was inspired in part by his love for cats.\n\n10. “The Rum Tum Tugger” by Andrew Lloyd Webber\n\nThere are many hits from the musical Cats, but many fans appreciate “The Rum Tum Tugger” because of its playful lyrics. Many cat owners have experienced the fickle nature of their cats, but they still find them to be charming and love them anyway.
