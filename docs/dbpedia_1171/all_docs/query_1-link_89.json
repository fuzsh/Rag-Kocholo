        "text": "On the MGM side, \"Sing Before Breakfast\" is one of the catchiest songs used in Tom & Jerry.\n\nOn the WB side:\n\n-\"That Was a Big Fat Lie\" - \"Bell Hoppy\", \"Bone for a Bone\", \"Muzzle Tough\", \"A Peck o' Trouble\".\n\n-\"Down in Nashville, Tennessee\" - Only used a couple times but I wish it was used more.\n\n-\"In a Little Red Barn on a Farm Down in Indiana\" - again, only heard in a couple cartoons but still catchy.\n\n-\"I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover\" - favorite arrangements: \"Fast and Furry-ous\", \"Daffy Dilly\", \"There Auto Be a Law\"\n\nOriginally Posted by: Ian L.\n\n^ I don't know if it was written just for the cartoon, but it wasn't a Carl Stalling creation. It was written by Joseph Meyer and lyrics were by Al Stillman.\n\nOriginally Posted by: Ian L.\n\nJust wondering, Ian, which MGM cartoons does \"Sing Before Breakfast\" play in? I wanna say it's the piece that plays during the breakfast scene in \"The Truce Hearts\" for obvious reasons, but not sure.\n\nOriginally Posted by: OutOfOdor"
