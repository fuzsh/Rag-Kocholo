        "text": "If you're a fan of prestige TV and blockbuster cinema, you've likely heard the works of music composer Ramin Djawadi. The two-time Emmy Award-winner and three-time GRAMMY nominee has crafted scores for \"Westworld,\" \"Iron Man,\" \"Eternals,\" \"Uncharted,\" and dozens of other celebrated shows and films, with more to come. But those who have journeyed to Westeros know Djawadi for his opus: that's right, he's the man behind the music of \"Game of Thrones.\" .\n\nNow, the sonic call to arms is experiencing a second life as the central theme for \"House of the Dragon\" — the latest installment in George R.R. Martin's \"Game of Thrones\" universe, set 200 years before the events of the original series.\n\nA musical chameleon — who has collaborated with mega talents like Hans Zimmer, Wu Tang's RZA, and Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello — Djawadi has returned to compose music for the highly anticipated prequel series, which is wrapping its debut season this Sunday on HBO. Ahead of the finale, GRAMMY.com spoke with the composer about crafting musical cues and themes for the characters of Westeros, his love of '80s metal and the possibility of a \"House of the Dragon\" live concert experience. The discussion below contains mild spoilers.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nEarlier in your career, you collaborated with Hans Zimmer on \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" Did your experience working on that score inform your later work? And what insights did you gain from him?\n\nWorking with Hans has been absolutely incredible. He has been such a good mentor and friend. Looking back on those times, I was fresh out of college and felt ready to become a composer. But I didn't realize how much more there was to the role than just writing, which is hard enough.\n\nWorking closely with Hans, I got to see his organizational process and how he works with collaborators and runs meetings. Obviously, there are a lot of pieces of music to write and keep track of, and you also have to stay on top of the recording sessions. Being able to see this on a massive project like \"Pirates\" was incredible.\n\nYou've spoken about the decision to use GoT's main theme for \"House of the Dragon\" to keep the shows connected. Are there any plans to compose an original HOTD theme for future seasons?\n\nHonestly, at this point, there haven't been any discussions about season 2 yet, so it's too early to tell. For the first season [of HOTD], the decision was made to use the theme to tie the show to \"Game of Thrones,\" which has been off the air for a while. It was meant to make a statement about connecting these shows and giving this overarching theme. That's how we always saw the original theme in the \"Game of Thrones\" episodes: It belongs to everyone. It summarizes the movement of the show, so that's why the decision was made to keep it for the new series.\n\nWhere do you find inspiration for the different musical ideas and motifs in the series? What are some of your reference points?\n\nNumber one, talking with the showrunners, Miguel [Sapochnik] and Ryan [Condal]. They've guided me through the show, as they understand where things are heading. So I've followed that very closely when I set up a theme. And then they'll tell me, \"Look, later on, this needs to be able to do this. And can it be mysterious but also epic?\" So I pay close attention to their guidance.\n\nI'm also very inspired and influenced by visuals. When I get the episodes — even if I don't write to picture — I like having the episode running in the background. Seeing those amazing costumes and set design — all of that inspires me.\n\nYou recently revealed that you were a metalhead when you were younger. Has that genre influenced your work on this series or GoT?\n\n[Laughs] Absolutely. I won't deny it. Rock and metal have always been a big part of my influence. As a teenager, I had long hair and was a shredder on the guitar. I was inspired by all those great '80s metal bands: Metallica, Anthrax, Slayer; I can go on and on. Metal had a great run during that whole time period. There was one amazing band after another.\n\nThe genre has really influenced my writing. In fact, when we did the second \"Game of Thrones\" tour, my wife suggested adding guitar to the mix. And I actually pushed back, but she said to put this cue on and play along with the guitar. And I did it and thought, Oh my god. And I realized how guitaristic the lines were and how well it fit on the guitar, so we made that part of the show. A lot of things that I write translate well on the guitar.\n\nThough the genres seem disparate, I've heard there's a connection between classical music and metal.\n\nYou're absolutely correct. When I was a teenager playing all this rock stuff, there were all these neo-classical guitar players, like Yngwie Malmsteen, for example. He was crossing over from rock and metal into classical music. And I played that stuff all day long. I would take Paganini pieces and play them on the guitar. That type of crossover was popular during that time frame. Guitar players would play Bach pieces on the guitar. So there's definitely a connection.\n\nCan you talk about the process of scoring a scene for the show? Is there a brief or a discussion beforehand?\n\nIt's called a spotting session. I sit down with the showrunners, Miguel and Ryan, and we watch the whole episode together. Then we decide where music should start and where it should stop. And then we talk about those moments. What theme could we use? What should the mood be?\n\nSometimes we get into great detail, and sometimes we don't. We have to figure out the right instrumentation when there's a turning point, so they'll give me more inspiration and direction. And then, I write all the music and create these digital demos, which I play for them. Then, we'll watch the picture with the music together and see what works and what doesn't. Do we need to tweak it more or not? Once we all agree on the music, I record it.\n\nIt's important to point out that it's a collaboration. I don't just write whatever I want. The showrunners have a clear vision. For example, they knew that we were going to use the piano again at the end of the first [\"House of the Dragon\"] episode. It has always been a big thing to use the piano in GoT, and we didn't do that until the sixth season.\n\nSo now that we've introduced that piano sound, we might as well drop it in the first episode [of this new series]. It's a crucial point in the plot, so we decided to use it. So I write the piece with the piano and then play it for the showrunners. They might have some thoughts, but they might not. Ultimately, it's a collaboration, and you want everyone to love it, so you have to explore this together.\n\nHow do you determine which characters get a theme or multiple themes?\n\nThat's a great question. It just kind of happens organically as we move through the episode. Some are more obvious than others. In one episode, Rhaenys, Alicent and Viserys may need themes.\n\nOr Rhaenyra, for example, there are several themes for her that just kind of happened to come out of different scenes. Like there's one that is more of an emotional theme for her. Then there's the other one with the vocal in episode 3 when she returns to the camp. It's fun to combine them, depending on what the story does.\n\nAs a viewer, I love how the musical cues in both series are always deployed with such precision, at just the right emotional moment. And I've noticed how the absence of music in certain scenes can trigger deeper emotions. How do you and the creatives decide when a scene or moment can benefit from a cue and when to hold back?\n\nI feel it's very hard to do. And again, this all happens in the spotting session, where you decide where music should and should not be. But we tweak right up until the very end when the show has to be finalized because most times when we discuss the music, the visuals are not finished. The visual effects, the sound effects. Everything happens in parallel. So sometimes you wind up doing what we call overscoring, where you put too much music in the show. When the visuals come together later, you realize, \"Wow, now that the final sound effects are here, let's pull back on the music because the dragons are so loud. We don't need music here right now to compensate for them.\"\n\nYou make these decisions until the very end. And it's always a tricky thing to get the balance just right. I think it's really well done in \"House of the Dragon\" and \"Game of Thrones.\" Like you said, sometimes, having no music can be more powerful than actually playing something because music always enhances things. Sometimes, not enhancing a scene can make it more awkward, more scary or more emotional.\n\nWhen composing the music for a scene, do you prioritize syncing sounds to actions and movements or creating a mood?\n\nFor this particular show, we usually focus on capturing the mood rather than syncing to movement. It's more about storytelling with the thematic material. A lot of it is broader strokes. And that's always what has worked really well for the show.\n\nRhaenys' grand entrance during the coronation features one of my favorite musical moments of the show so far. You took us from celebration mode to pure chaos in an instant. Then the music syncs as Alicent's eyes close, and there's no doubt that everyone on that stage is toast — but our expectations are subverted. What went into creating that epic piece?\n\nIt's a big, big moment. And that's a good example of a time when we played with the balance of sound effects — where not to have music and where to introduce it and pull it when you think they are all gonna die now. I actually dropped a little bit of the \"Main Title Theme\" in there because, historically, that's always what we have done. Towards later episodes, we saw that this overarching main theme could stand for all.\n\nThe realm is on the cusp of civil war as the first season comes to an end. Can you talk about any of the themes or cues we'll hear in this Sunday's finale? Will the piano return?\n\n[Laughs] I'm not sure how much I can say, but it's gonna be an epic finale. I think it's really, really great. I'm trying to think if there is any piano in it. I don't remember now, actually.\n\nA few years ago, you created the \"Game of Thrones\" Live Concert Experience and toured the world playing the sounds of Westeros. Do you plan to develop a \"House of the Dragon\" live show?\n\nPossibly, but it's a little bit too early to tell. On \"Game of Thrones,\" we didn't do a tour until after season 6, actually. [HOTD] is still in its first season, but there's certainly plenty of material; it could definitely fill a concert. And I absolutely enjoyed those concerts.\n\nIf my schedule allows, I'm more than happy to tour again because it was very special to connect with the audience. I'm always in my studio by myself, and being out there and seeing the reactions from the crowd when you play those epic scenes along with the music was fantastic.\n\nMeet Sherri Chung, The Score Composer Shaking Up The Television Academy\n\nLiving Legends is a series that spotlights icons in music still going strong today. This week, GRAMMY.com spoke with Billy Idol about his latest EP, Cage, and continuing to rock through decades of changing tastes.\n\nBilly Idol is a true rock 'n' roll survivor who has persevered through cultural shifts and personal struggles. While some may think of Idol solely for \"Rebel Yell\" and \"White Wedding,\" the singer's musical influences span genres and many of his tunes are less turbo-charged than his '80s hits would belie.\n\nIdol first made a splash in the latter half of the '70s with the British punk band Generation X. In the '80s, he went on to a solo career combining rock, pop, and punk into a distinct sound that transformed him and his musical partner, guitarist Steve Stevens, into icons. They have racked up multiple GRAMMY nominations, in addition to one gold, one double platinum, and four platinum albums thanks to hits like \"Cradle Of Love,\" \"Flesh For Fantasy,\" and \"Eyes Without A Face.\"\n\nBut, unlike many legacy artists, Idol is anything but a relic. Billy continues to produce vital Idol music by collaborating with producers and songwriters — including Miley Cyrus — who share his forward-thinking vision. He will play a five-show Vegas residency in November, and filmmaker Jonas Akerlund is working on a documentary about Idol’s life.\n\nHis latest release is Cage, the second in a trilogy of annual four-song EPs. The title track is a classic Billy Idol banger expressing the desire to free himself from personal constraints and live a better life. Other tracks on Cage incorporate metallic riffing and funky R&B grooves.\n\nIdol continues to reckon with his demons — they both grappled with addiction during the '80s — and the singer is open about those struggles on the record and the page. (Idol's 2014 memoir Dancing With Myself, details a 1990 motorcycle accident that nearly claimed a leg, and how becoming a father steered him to reject hard drugs. \"Bitter Taste,\" from his last EP, The Roadside, reflects on surviving the accident.)\n\nAlthough Idol and Stevens split in the late '80s — the skilled guitarist fronted Steve Stevens & The Atomic Playboys, and collaborated with Michael Jackson, Rick Ocasek, Vince Neil, and Harold Faltermeyer (on the GRAMMY-winning \"Top Gun Anthem\") — their common history and shared musical bond has been undeniable. The duo reunited in 2001 for an episode of \"VH1 Storytellers\" and have been back in the saddle for two decades. Their union remains one of the strongest collaborations in rock 'n roll history.\n\nWhile there is recognizable personnel and a distinguishable sound throughout a lot of his work, Billy Idol has always pushed himself to try different things. Idol discusses his musical journey, his desire to constantly move forward, and the strong connection that he shares with Stevens.\n\nSteve has said that you like to mix up a variety of styles, yet everyone assumes you're the \"Rebel Yell\"/\"White Wedding\" guy. But if they really listen to your catalog, it's vastly different.\n\nYeah, that's right. With someone like Steve Stevens, and then back in the day Keith Forsey producing... [Before that] Generation X actually did move around inside punk rock. We didn't stay doing just the Ramones two-minute music. We actually did a seven-minute song. [Laughs]. We did always mix things up.\n\nThen when I got into my solo career, that was the fun of it. With someone like Steve, I knew what he could do. I could see whatever we needed to do, we could nail it. The world was my oyster musically.\n\n\"Cage\" is a classic-sounding Billy Idol rocker, then \"Running From The Ghost\" is almost metal, like what the Devil's Playground album was like back in the mid-2000s. \"Miss Nobody\" comes out of nowhere with this pop/R&B flavor. What inspired that?\n\nWe really hadn't done anything like that since something like \"Flesh For Fantasy\" [which] had a bit of an R&B thing about it. Back in the early days of Billy Idol, \"Hot In The City\" and \"Mony Mony\" had girls [singing] on the backgrounds.\n\nWe always had a bit of R&B really, so it was actually fun to revisit that. We just hadn't done anything really quite like that for a long time. That was one of the reasons to work with someone like Sam Hollander [for the song \"Rita Hayworth\"] on The Roadside. We knew we could go [with him] into an R&B world, and he's a great songwriter and producer. That's the fun of music really, trying out these things and seeing if you can make them stick.\n\nI listen to new music by veteran artists and debate that with some people. I'm sure you have those fans that want their nostalgia, and then there are some people who will embrace the newer stuff. Do you find it’s a challenge to reach people with new songs?\n\nObviously, what we're looking for is, how do we somehow have one foot in the past and one foot into the future? We’ve got the best of all possible worlds because that has been the modus operandi of Billy Idol.\n\nYou want to do things that are true to you, and you don't just want to try and do things that you're seeing there in the charts today. I think that we're achieving it with things like \"Running From The Ghost\" and \"Cage\" on this new EP. I think we’re managing to do both in a way.\n\n**Obviously, \"Running From The Ghost\" is about addiction, all the stuff that you went through, and in \"Cage\" you’re talking about freeing yourself from a lot of personal shackles. Was there any one moment in your life that made you really thought I have to not let this weigh me down anymore?**\n\nI mean, things like the motorcycle accident I had, that was a bit of a wake up call way back. It was 32 years ago. But there were things like that, years ago, that gradually made me think about what I was doing with my life. I didn't want to ruin it, really. I didn't want to throw it away, and it made [me] be less cavalier.\n\nI had to say to myself, about the drugs and stuff, that I've been there and I've done it. There’s no point in carrying on doing it. You couldn't get any higher. You didn't want to throw your life away casually, and I was close to doing that. It took me a bit of time, but then gradually I was able to get control of myself to a certain extent [with] drugs and everything. And I think Steve's done the same thing. We're on a similar path really, which has been great because we're in the same boat in terms of lyrics and stuff.\n\nSo a lot of things like that were wake up calls. Even having grandchildren and just watching my daughter enlarging her family and everything; it just makes you really positive about things and want to show a positive side to how you're feeling, about where you're going. We've lived with the demons so long, we've found a way to live with them. We found a way to be at peace with our demons, in a way. Maybe not completely, but certainly to where we’re enjoying what we do and excited about it.\n\n[When writing] \"Running From The Ghost\" it was easy to go, what was the ghost for us? At one point, we were very drug addicted in the '80s. And Steve in particular is super sober [now]. I mean, I still vape pot and stuff. I don’t know how he’s doing it, but it’s incredible. All I want to be able to do is have a couple of glasses of wine at a restaurant or something. I can do that now.\n\nI think working with people that are super talented, you just feel confident. That is a big reason why you open up and express yourself more because you feel comfortable with what's around you.\n\nDid you watch Danny Boyle's recent Sex Pistols mini-series?\n\nI did, yes.\n\nYou had a couple of cameos; well, an actor who portrayed you did. How did you react to it? How accurate do you think it was in portraying that particular time period?\n\nI love Jonesy’s book, I thought his book was incredible. It's probably one of the best bio books really. It was incredible and so open. I was looking forward to that a lot.\n\nIt was as if [the show] kind of stayed with Steve [Jones’ memoir] about halfway through, and then departed from it. [John] Lydon, for instance, was never someone I ever saw acting out; he's more like that today. I never saw him do something like jump up in the room and run around going crazy. The only time I saw him ever do that was when they signed the recording deal with Virgin in front of Buckingham Palace. Whereas Sid Vicious was always acting out; he was always doing something in a horrible way or shouting at someone. I don't remember John being like that. I remember him being much more introverted.\n\nBut then I watched interviews with some of the actors about coming to grips with the parts they were playing. And they were saying, we knew punk rock happened but just didn't know any of the details. So I thought well, there you go. If [\"Pistol\" is] informing a lot of people who wouldn't know anything about punk rock, maybe that's what's good about it.\n\nMaybe down the road John Lydon will get the chance to do John's version of the Pistols story. Maybe someone will go a lot deeper into it and it won't be so surface. But maybe you needed this just to get people back in the flow.\n\nWe had punk and metal over here in the States, but it feels like England it was legitimately more dangerous. British society was much more rigid.\n\nIt never went [as] mega in America. It went big in England. It exploded when the Pistols did that interview with [TV host Bill] Grundy, that lorry truck driver put his boot through his own TV, and all the national papers had \"the filth and the fury\" [headlines].\n\nWe went from being unknown to being known overnight. We waited a year, Generation X. We even told them [record labels] no for nine months to a year. Every record company wanted their own punk rock group. So it went really mega in England, and it affected the whole country – the style, the fashions, everything. I mean, the Ramones were massive in England. Devo had a No. 1 song [in England] with \"Satisfaction\" in '77. Actually, Devo was as big as or bigger than the Pistols.\n\nYou were ahead of the pop-punk thing that happened in the late '90s, and a lot of it became tongue-in-cheek by then. It didn't have the same sense of rebelliousness as the original movement. It was more pop.\n\nIt had become a style. There was a famous book in England called Revolt Into Style — and that's what had happened, a revolt that turned into style which then they were able to duplicate in their own way. Even recently, Billie Joe [Armstrong] did his own version of \"Gimme Some Truth,\" the Lennon song we covered way back in 1977.\n\nWhen we initially were making [punk] music, it hadn't become accepted yet. It was still dangerous and turned into a style that people were used to. We were still breaking barriers.\n\nYou have a band called Generation Sex with Steve Jones and Paul Cook. I assume you all have an easier time playing Pistols and Gen X songs together now and not worrying about getting spit on like back in the '70s?\n\nYeah, definitely. When I got to America I told the group I was putting it together, \"No one spits at the audience.\"\n\nWe had five years of being spat on [in the UK], and it was revolting. And they spat at you if they liked you. If they didn't like it they smashed your gear up. One night, I remember I saw blood on my T-shirt, and I think Joe Strummer got meningitis when spit went in his mouth.\n\nYou had to go through a lot to become successful, it wasn't like you just kind of got up there and did a couple of gigs. I don't think some young rock bands really get that today.\n\nWith punk going so mega in England, we definitely got a leg up. We still had a lot of work to get where we got to, and rightly so because you find out that you need to do that. A lot of groups in the old days would be together three to five years before they ever made a record, and that time is really important. In a way, what was great about punk rock for me was it was very much a learning period. I really learned a lot [about] recording music and being in a group and even writing songs.\n\nThen when I came to America, it was a flow, really. I also really started to know what I wanted Billy Idol to be. It took me a little bit, but I kind of knew what I wanted Billy Idol to be. And even that took a while to let it marinate.\n\nYou and Miley Cyrus have developed a good working relationship in the last several years. How do you think her fans have responded to you, and your fans have responded to her?\n\nI think they're into it. It's more the record company that she had didn't really get \"Night Crawling\"— it was one of the best songs on Plastic Hearts, and I don't think they understood that. They wanted to go with Dua Lipa, they wanted to go with the modern, young acts, and I don't think they realized that that song was resonating with her fans. Which is a shame really because, with Andrew Watt producing, it's a hit song.\n\nBut at the same time, I enjoyed doing it. It came out really good and it's very Billy Idol. In fact, I think it’s more Billy Idol than Miley Cyrus. I think it shows you where Andrew Watt was. He was excited about doing a Billy Idol track. She's fun to work with. She’s a really great person and she works at her singing — I watched her rehearsing for the Super Bowl performance she gave. She rehearsed all Saturday morning, all Saturday afternoon, and Sunday morning and it was that afternoon. I have to admire her fortitude. She really cares.\n\nI remember when you went on \"Viva La Bam\" back in 2005 and decided to give Bam Margera’s Lamborghini a new sunroof by taking a power saw to it. Did he own that car? Was that a rental?\n\nI think it was his car.\n\nDid he get over it later on?\n\nHe loved it. [Laughs] He’s got a wacky sense of humor. He’s fantastic, actually. I’m really sorry to see what he's been going through just lately. He's going through a lot, and I wish him the best. He's a fantastic person, and it's a shame that he's struggling so much with his addictions. I know what it's like. It's not easy.\n\nMusically, what is the synergy like with you guys during the past 10 years, doing Kings and Queens of the Underground and this new stuff? What is your working relationship like now in this more sober, older, mature version of you two as opposed to what it was like back in the '80s?\n\nIn lots of ways it’s not so different because we always wrote the songs together, we always talked about what we're going to do together. It was just that we were getting high at the same time.We're just not getting [that way now] but we're doing all the same things.\n\nWe're still talking about things, still [planning] things:What are we going to do next? How are we going to find new people to work with? We want to find new producers. Let's be a little bit more timely about putting stuff out.That part of our relationship is the same, you know what I mean? That never got affected. We just happened to be overloading in the '80s.\n\nThe relationship’s… matured and it's carrying on being fruitful, and I think that's pretty amazing. Really, most people don't get to this place. Usually, they hate each other by now. [Laughs] We also give each other space. We're not stopping each other doing things outside of what we’re working on together. All of that enables us to carry on working together. I love and admire him. I respect him. He's been fantastic. I mean, just standing there on stage with him is always a treat. And he’s got an immensely great sense of humor. I think that's another reason why we can hang together after all this time because we've got the sense of humor to enable us to go forward.\n\nThere's a lot of fan reaction videos online, and I noticed a lot of younger women like \"Rebel Yell\" because, unlike a lot of other '80s alpha male rock tunes, you're talking about satisfying your lover.\n\nIt was about my girlfriend at the time, Perri Lister. It was about how great I thought she was, how much I was in love with her, and how great women are, how powerful they are.\n\nIt was a bit of a feminist anthem in a weird way. It was all about how relationships can free you and add a lot to your life. It was a cry of love, nothing to do with the Civil War or anything like that. Perri was a big part of my life, a big part of being Billy Idol. I wanted to write about it. I'm glad that's the effect.\n\nIs there something you hope people get out of the songs you've been doing over the last 10 years? Do you find yourself putting out a message that keeps repeating?\n\nWell, I suppose, if anything, is that you can come to terms with your life, you can keep a hold of it. You can work your dreams into reality in a way and, look, a million years later, still be enjoying it.\n\nThe only reason I'm singing about getting out of the cage is because I kicked out of the cage years ago. I joined Generation X when I said to my parents, \"I'm leaving university, and I'm joining a punk rock group.\" And they didn't even know what a punk rock group was. Years ago, I’d write things for myself that put me on this path, so that maybe in 2022 I could sing something like \"Cage\" and be owning this territory and really having a good time. This is the life I wanted.\n\nThe original UK punk movement challenged societal norms. Despite all the craziness going on throughout the world, it seems like a lot of modern rock bands are afraid to do what you guys were doing. Do you think we'll see a shift in that?\n\nYeah. Art usually reacts to things, so I would think eventually there will be a massive reaction to the pop music that’s taken over — the middle of the road music, and then this kind of right wing politics. There will be a massive reaction if there's not already one. I don’t know where it will come from exactly. You never know who's gonna do [it].\n\nLiving Legends: Nancy Sinatra Reflects On Creating \"Power And Magic\" In Studio, Developing A Legacy Beyond \"Boots\" & The Pop Stars She Wants To Work With"
