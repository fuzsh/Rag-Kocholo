        "text": "\"We still use the xylophone for an eye blink and we still play 'The Lady in Red' when a character wears a red dress. We do this to honor Carl Stalling, but also to keep conversant with the Warner Bros. tradition.\"\n\nAlthough faithful to the Stalling legacy, he also incorporated elements of jazz, Broadway, country and rock music into his work.\n\nStone really liked his work. \"It's wonderful,\" he said of serving as supervising composer for Animaniacs in a 1993 interview in the Cleveland Plain Dealer. \"I grew up watching classic Looney Tunes. They were always a big part of my life, and now to stand there on that stage and to conduct that orchestra is almost a religious experience for me. This is the zenith, the high point of my career.\"\n\nNew scores were written for every show. They were performed by a 30-piece orchestra made up of studio musicians. In the Stalling tradition, Mr. Stone would quote from melodies in the public domain such as \"I've Been Working on the Railroad\" and classical pieces to create scores that were intricately synchronized to the animation and peppered with musical puns.\n\n\"We'll go from Wagner to bluegrass in the same five seconds,\" he said in a 1998 interview in Daily Variety, the entertainment trade publication. \"If you see a boulder fall on somebody, it's a lot funnier if there's a piano glissando and a big timpani hit.\"\n\nStone had a dry wit. His brother David said that Mr. Stone once interviewed television chef Graham Kerr for a school project. He asked him whether his nickname, the \"Galloping Gourmet,\" had anything to do with prunes.\n\nHe grew up in Philadelphia watching \"Looney Tunes\" cartoons. He was exposed to music through his father, who played the piano, and his maternal grandfather, a music critic for the Philadelphia Inquirer."
