        "text": "Taylor Swift's latest music video for her single \"Bejeweled\" is truly a sparkling treasure trove of Easter eggs.\n\nFresh off the release of her record-breaking album Midnights, the \"Anti-Hero\" singer visited The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon last night to reveal that she would be releasing a dazzling second music video for her song \"Bejeweled.\"\n\nWritten and directed by Swift, the vibrant visual is \"a little twist on a Cinderella story\" that she said was created \"just for the fans who like certain things like glitter and Easter eggs and lots of little cameos.\" The end result features a truly \"psychotic amount\" of references that even Swift had a difficult time keeping up with.\n\n\"We have a PDF file for the Easter eggs in this video,\" she joked, \"because there are so many that we could not keep track.\"\n\nBelow, EW breaks down all the little Easter eggs, throwbacks, and familiar faces — complete with timestamps for easy reference — that you might have missed in the shining, shimmering, splendid new video. Ready for it? Let's go!\n\n\"Bejeweled\" and Speak Now, :00\n\nYes, even before pressing play, there's an Easter egg. The \"Bejeweled\" music video was released on Oct. 25, which is the 12th anniversary of Swift's third album, Speak Now. The video itself is jam-packed full of references to Speak Now in particular, prompting fans to believe it might be the album that she re-records next.\n\nEste, Danielle, and Alana Haim as the evil step-siblings, :05\n\nSwift's best friends Este, Danielle, and Alana Haim (a.k.a. the band Haim) feature in the video as the her evil step-siblings. She and the sisters share a long-documented friendship: they make TikToks together, collaborated on her 2020 song \"no body, no crime,\" and Swift recently joined Haim onstage over the summer at a London concert.\n\n\"Enchanted\" instrumental, :15\n\nAs the Haim sisters share their excitement about the prince and the upcoming talent show, an instrumental version of Swift's song \"Enchanted\" from her album Speak Now can be heard playing in the background.\n\nLaura Dern as the evil step-mother, :15\n\nLaura Dern delights as the greedy step-mother, who encourages her three children to win over the affections of the prince for their own financial and political gain.\n\nMarriage, :40\n\nDuring her brief appearance, Dern's character saccharinely describes marriage as \"the single most defining thing a lady could hope to achieve in her lifetime.\" Marriage rumors have followed Swift and her partner, Conversations With Friends actor Joe Alwyn, since they first began dating back in 2016. Dern's quick comment was the perfect way to dismiss the speculation and remind viewers that there's more to Swift than just her love life — like, you know, breaking records!\n\n\"Speak Not, tired tacky wench,\" 1:14\n\nA cheeky third nod to Speak Now.\n\n\"He tired of her quite quickly,\" 1:25\n\nAnother slight toward Swift's dating life and the way that she was publicly perceived as someone who was unable to keep a boyfriend around for a long period of time. She makes multiple references this framing throughout her discography, including in 2014's \"Shake It Off\" when she sings, \"I go on too many dates / But I can't make them stay / At least that's what people say.\"\n\n\"Or should I say… Swiftly?\" 1:30\n\nA swift play on Swift's surname.\n\n\"You've been exiled here,\" 1:40\n\nA nod to Swift's 2020 Folklore single \"Exile,\" which featured Bon Iver.\n\n\"Bye, snake!\" 1:54\n\nSwift was labeled a \"snake\" by Kim Kardashian amidst a feud between her and Kanye West back in 2016. She reclaimed the title in her music video for the 2017 single \"Look What You Made Me Do\" from her album Reputation, which featured the aforementioned serpents slithering up her throne.\n\nPrince Jack Antonoff, cats, and the spinning wheel, 2:14\n\nSwift's long-time producer and collaborator Jack Antonoff makes his first appearance as the video's highly sought-after royal in a portrait that sees him, in true Swift style, surrounded by cats. Swift owns three cats — Meredith Grey, Olivia Benson, and Benjamin Button — the latter of which she adopted on the set of her 2019 music video \"Lover.\" In the corner of the frame, viewers can spot a spinning wheel, a reference to another fairytale, Sleeping Beauty.\n\n\"Exile ends,\" 2:22\n\nSwift opens a magical pocket watch that reads \"exile ends\" with a countdown, signifying that her Folklore/Evermore era is officially over and that it is Midnights time to shine.\n\n\"...Ready For It?\" robe, 2:29\n\nWhen she enters the elevator, Swift can be seen sporting a black cloak that appears similar in style to the one she wore in the music video for her 2017 single \"...Ready For It?\" This time, however, it is aptly covered in jewels.\n\n13 floors in the elevator, 2:40\n\nAs Swift fans know, 13 is the singer's lucky number. When she enters the elevator, there are 13 floors — each with their own signature color — that she can choose from that corresponds with an album in her discography.\n\nThird Floor is Speak Now, 2:56\n\nYes, we're on our fourth reference to Speak Now! Swift presses the third floor and enters into a world of glittering gemstones inspired by her third album.\n\nFifth Floor is 1989, 3:32\n\nIt's been waiting for you! Once she's sufficiently sparkling, Swift sashays up to the fifth floor — inspired by her fifth album 1989 — and steps out of the elevator in a new ensemble that looks reminiscent of her high society looks from the music video for \"Blank Space.\"\n\nDita Von Teese is the fairy goddess, 3:36\n\nModel and burlesque dancer Dita Von Teese is waiting for Swift on the fifth floor as her \"fairy goddess.\" As Swift told Jimmy Fallon, \"[Von Teese] is, I think, one of the most iconic performers and it's so exciting to get to see her do what she does in this.\" Von Teese teaches her a few tricks of the trade — including performing in a martini glass — so that Swift is ready to steal the show.\n\nSwift is sitting at 3 on the clock, 4:29\n\nAfter arriving on the 13th floor, the hands of the clock that Swift is lowered down on are pointed at three o'clock — a fifth nod to Speak Now.\n\nZoë Kravitz, Sam Dew, and Pat McGrath as the royal family, 4:57\n\nA few of Swift's songwriting partners — and legendary makeup artist Pat McGrath — get a nice mention toward the end of the video too. Zoë Kravitz, who helped Swift pen her recent Midnights tracks \"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma,\" is seen in one portrait behind McGrath. Sam Dew — who co-wrote \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" with Swift and Antonoff — is featured in the second portrait.\n\nSpeak Now hairpins, 5:08\n\nAs she poses for her royal portrait, keen-eyed viewers can spot the two heart pins in Swift's hair have the letters 'S' and 'N' featured on them. Speak Now if you have any guesses on what those could be hinting toward!\n\n\"Long Live\" instrumental, 5:12\n\nAt the end of the video, as Swift gazes over her dreamy new (and rapidly crumbling) castle, an instrumental version of her song \"Long Live\" from Speak Now can be heard in the background.\n\nThree dragons on the castle, 5:32\n\nSwift's new home is guarded by three dragons — there's that number three again — who are destroying its foundations. In the song \"Long Live,\" Swift makes a reference to dragons, singing, \"I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you.\"\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nRelated content:"
