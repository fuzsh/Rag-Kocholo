        "text": "(music: Stephanie Mills â âWhat Cha Gonna Do With My Lovinââ / applause)\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nWhatâs your strategy with dealing with vocalists? Do you have a go to philosophy, that you adhere to that works, or is it a case-by-case basis? Thatâs Stephanie Mills by the way, I didnât say who it was. âWhat Cha Gonna Do [With My Lovinâ].â\n\nMtume\n\nWell I think one of the keys that you need to establish, is what kind of voice you pull toward. Which one are you drawn... Iâve always been closer to the female voice. I feel that. An important thing to understand with a vocalist, donât over produce the vocalist. Be a guide because a lot of times, a singer can get stuck, they donât know where to go. Be there for that. But you got to know what youâre doing â you know what I mean â if youâre guiding somebody. But donât get in the way of an artist.\n\nWhen an artist is free to do what they do best, thatâs when you get the best performance. When you trying to [bring structure to] every line â no. The thing is hereâs the line and sometimes you have to adjust. Maybe the melody you had in your head doesnât work with that artist. You heard it perfectly when youâre doing it, but you not the recording artist. At the end of the day, to answer your question, what you go for: what feels right. Sometimes what you wrote is not going to work when you record it. I canât tell you how many songs I thought were great, and then the next day you record it you say, âWhat, am I kidding?â You know, donât get in the way of your artist be there to shape and direct where theyâre going. A lot of times people, you know, theyâre frustrated artists themselves. You know, âSay it like this.â No, it donât work like that let them be free, let them be free.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nWhat are your recollections of working with Donny Hathaway and Phyllis Hyman? Two supremely talented but obviously tortured, artists.\n\nMtume\n\nItâs very interesting you bring that up. As a matter of fact, as soon as I get back to New York, thereâs a cat from Holland whoâs doing a documentary on Donny. Heâs in New York right now, and Iâm going to put my part on it. Thatâs very heavy for me because the last two songs Donny Hathaway ever sang were two songs that I did. âThe Closer [I Get to You]â and another song called âBack Together Again.â As a matter of fact, thatâs the night he died.\n\nI know he killed himself that night. We recorded his song and it was a Saturday night. He had a breakdown in the studio and as a result he couldnât continue. I said, âItâs cool, Donny, weâll finish it Monday.â About five o clock in the morning, which would have been Sunday morning, my phone was ringing. You know when itâs early like that, you know thatâs weird. I picked it up, and it was someone crying and I said, âWho is this?â And she said, âThis is Roberta.â She said, âMtume, Donnyâs dead.â Itâs strange every time I hear âBack Together Again.â Iâm both proud that he was such a great artist and that you had the opportunity to do a couple of his songs.\n\nDonny was troubled as was Phyllis Hymen. Donny didnât leave a note. Phyllis did leave a note and a dear friend of mine, Kenny Gamble, Gamble and Huff, he called me. And when he had the note, he read it to me. She was really troubled with new artists coming along and she felt... I mean, if you can imagine this. She felt she was too old. And Iâm like, âOne of the greatest voices ever...â But people have their own insecurities. And she ultimately took her life while she was in the middle of a week of performances at the Apollo Theater with the Whispers.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nBut you have other recollections of working with Phyllis though. What kind of stands out?\n\nMtume\n\nFirst of all, the voices. I always say everythingâs about the voice. Phyllis had one of the most interesting tones for a female. She had a low register that just ran through you. I enjoyed it because she cussed like I did. She was a sailor. âF you.â I said, âYeah, F you, too.â Thereâs a section on one of the songs, âYou Know How to Love Me,â where she sings this long note and I had to do it over and over until it was right. So right after that she said, âF you.â I said, âOkay, cool.â So she strolls out. I say, âLetâs take a dinner break.â So while she goes out, I have one of the cats go out and get a dozen roses, tie them around the microphone. She comes back. I say, âOkay, we ready?â She said, âYes.â She walks out. I had the lights out in the recording [booth] where the microphone was. I put the lights on. She standing in front of the roses and she broke down crying. I mean, thatâs the kind of sensitivity it was. I just loved her. I loved her, man. Phyllis was great.\n\nMtume\n\nIs it tough to resolve these kind of conflicts in the studio? I mean, everybody here is working together in close proximity.\n\nMtume\n\nYeah. Iâve never had... [laughs] Thou speaketh too soon. [laughs] I had one bad experience. The studio is where you check your ego at the door. That means for the producers and the artists. And I had one bad ... Iâm not even gonna mention the name because itâll probably make me mad again. But he was a drag. Just one.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nAlright. So that was the only unresolvable situation. But â\n\nMtume\n\nI quit. I quit.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nBut hopefully everything is resolvable at some point.\n\nMtume\n\nOh, I know. Thatâs the happiest place in the world to be, in the studio. The one thing I never worked... If Iâm working in the studio, I never allow guests. The artistsâ guests or my personal guests. Anybody. They have to wait outside. Because if an artist is singing, sheâs looking from that room looking into the control room and if you got these people sitting there, it turns into a performance. You see, you canât help it. If Iâm singing, itâs a performance because we made a connection. So you take that out, and everything is here. Itâs like being under a microscope, and Iâve always felt you get the best performance when thereâs no audience. Weâre just in there, just me and the engineer. Thatâs how Iâve always worked. Everybody has their own way.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nSo then you mentioned a little bit earlier how Mtume, the band, formed. Can you, as a sort of a thing when the other sessions werenât happening, what did you envision for the band Mtume that was different from what you were doing on these productions?\n\nMtume\n\nWell like I said, the first two albums were just, âHey, letâs do an album.â We had this deal. I had to fill it. I had to deliver an album. I didnât take the band serious until, as I talked earlier, when I had that moment I had to confront. I was doing the same thing. And at that time, I decided I wouldnât produce anybody else. I didnât produce anybody. I said, âIâm gonna take a year, put another band together, find a studio.â Because the studio is the other musician. The studio is a sound. And an engineer... And I took off a year. I only worked in one room in New Jersey, a place called E.A.R.S. And that was the Juicy Fruit album. And I didnât do anything else. And thatâs when I found out what my vision was for the band. I really didnât have a vision. I had just a reason to fill a contract. But on that album, I said, âNo. Weâre going to do this, and Iâm going to do it.â I didnât think, âIâm going to change the direction.â But I said, âIâm gonna do something where itâs a new sound.â Again, like you said, not radical, but it was definitely a departure from everything else that was out there.\n\nSo, I take the record to Epic. Theyâre into... âWe canât put this out.â Iâm like, âWhy?â They said, âItâs too slow.â Because they were dealing with beats per minute. I donât know who came up with that madness.\n\n[laugher]\n\nBeats per minute? I said, âI write from my heart, not from my head.â And they said, âItâs too slow, but the other thing, itâs risque.â Now, you gotta take yourself back. This is 1983. Thatâs âLike a Virginâ now, with some of the stuff thatâs on records now. But at that time, they didnât want to put it out. So this is what they did. This was their negotiation with me. âAlright, okay, weâll put it out since youâre insisting. But weâre not gonna release it for daytime play.â So it was only initially released for night, after 12 oâclock formats. After one week they were getting so many calls from around the country. They said in the report they kept getting was, it was probably the first record that anybody remembered where you knew the song by the beat. So obviously they did finally have to acquiesce to get in that money. It wasnât like they loved it. They hated it. But money heals all things.\n\n[laughter]\n\nSo obviously I become one of their favorite. But that was that story. So when I hear that line... Oh, also I got sued, I forgot, by Juicy Fruit gum, Wrigleyâs.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nRight, so what happened there?\n\nMtume\n\nKeep this right here, donât let that out of the room. So, I get called in, I have to take a deposition, right? So roll in, I forgot, some big, huge, humongous law firm in New York. And I go in. So Iâm this black guy walking in amazed at one of the longest tables Iâd ever seen, with all these elderly white guys sitting around, and Iâm taking a deposition. So it finally gets down to, I knew ultimately itâs gonna come to this. âWell, Mr. Mtume, what do you mean by you can lick me everywhere?â So I knew I had them then. So I rolled back. Well I said, âObviously itâs not about gum.â\n\n[laughter]\n\nI said, âItâs about oral sex.â And you should have seen the looks that came... I donât think anybody in that room was under 70, you know what I mean? [laughs] But thatâs the great story I have. I donât think Iâve ever told it public. âWhat do you mean by you can lick?â I mean, what kind of question is that, first of all?\n\n[laughter]\n\nSo thatâs why I laughed, yâall..\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nSo how did the beat come to be, then?\n\nMtume\n\nWhat happened, as I said earlier, I was working... we were just dedicated to this album. So we had finished one of the sessions. It was about two in the morning. Everybody left, but I had this thing in my head. So I sat down, and the LinnDrum had kind of just came out and it wasnât really being used that much in R&B. So I just sat down. [mimicks the beat] And I said, âThat feels interesting.â So I laid it. I didnât quantize it. Thatâs why itâs slightly off. It has more of a human thing to it because sometimes when you quantize, to me, something being exact is not cool. Because the humanity is sucked out. So I recorded like that. I called everybody back to the studio. So the guys get back at about three in the morning. We laid the track. Tawatha was on tour with Roxy Music. She was in Europe. She had two days off, flew her back. We recorded... Iâm writing the lyrics as sheâs recording them. And got her back on a plane so she could meet Roxy Music and finish. And thatâs how that went.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nSo how did you take to drum machine hardware as a percussionist yourself? I guess this is whatâs even more interesting as record for you personally is the drum machine is the thing thatâs pushing this record through. Is that counter intuitive for you as a musician because youâre used to doing it yourself with your own hands?\n\nMtume\n\nNot at all. Again, be like water. That was the shape I was pouring it in. Iâm not threatened by a technology. I welcome it. I digest it. But I also try to humanize it. When you just depend on technology, but you have no musical understanding, thatâs the first thing you lean on, is making everything perfect. Itâs like, I can do this all day. The trick is, do I know how to do that? To make it lean, to curve the thing. Itâs a combination of intuition, intellect, and technique. You gotta know what those things are. But if youâre just sitting at a machine and donât know those other intricacies of what it is to deal with music or any art form. So yeah, no. Iâm not threatened by technology. If that was the case, I wouldnât use lights.\n\n[laughter]\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nWell that was always the counter-argument to the radical Miles Davis music as well, right? Because the critics were like, âWhy are you playing this dissonant electric music? Why isnât Miles playing acoustic music?â\n\nMtume\n\nBecause thatâs where he was, and that bridge was already burned. You see, sometimes people are really offended when you move on. Itâs like a relationship. How dare you? [laughs] You moved on. But if you donât follow your instinct, and your intuition, then you never know what the... You never experience the joy of really being creative because youâll be stuck in that quicksand, scared to do something different. And the least of all, I donât care what anybody thinks. If I think itâs cool, try it. That doesnât mean you donât listen to other opinions, then thatâs arrogance. But I mean, like I said, too much now...\n\nIf I can [digress] just for a second. Branding. People donât talk about the music somebodyâs creating, they talk about their brand. And somebody suffers when that happens. And who suffers more often than not is the listener and the fan because youâre going to get the same bullshit in a different cup, in a different package. âOh, but because thatâs so-and-so it must be good.â What? No. Is it good based on the fact that itâs good? So you see a lot of stuff. People put out the same album 12 times over and everybodyâs, âOh, the new so and so, oh itâs great.â Why? You scared to have an opinion because some of the stuff is really bad. Some of itâs really great. But youâre branding. And like in boxing, I see this. Right after music, boxing is just my second favorite thing in the world. But I see fighters who donât fight to defend the title, they fight to protect it. So your brand. So you donât fight Pacquiao, OK? But then the whole boxing game get turned ... Because itâs about the best meeting the best. And in music, thatâs starting to happen. Branding. Thatâs why you only have two or three major stars. When did that happen? I knew 50 great female singers, 50 great saxophonists. What is this thing we got? One or two of this, one or two of that. When did that happen? Branding is a dangerous thing because it puts brakes on the creative process because you know you can sell by just putting it out because your name. No, you have to earn the right for people to love your music.\n\n[clapping]\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nYou mentioned at the top of the conversation that scoring was one of your passions. This point in your career, the technology and scoring came together a little bit, and it sounded a little like this, right?\n\n(music: DâAngelo â âGirl You Need a Change of Mindâ / applause)\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nWho was that?\n\nMtume\n\nDâAngelo, my man.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nThis was just a one ... was it a soundtrack or a cover?\n\nMtume\n\nYes, he called and asked me to produce that track. It was an old Eddie Kendricks track. It was for Get on the Bus. Yes, Get on the Bus soundtrack.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nHeâs mentioned you as a mentor of sorts. Is it fun just this experience of working together or...\n\nMtume\n\nWell, actually no. I had forgotten this, and he reminded me. When he was doing his first album, Brown Sugar, I was in the studio next door. He came over when he found out I was there and he was having some difficulties navigating through some parts. I actually did that with him and helped him through. Then there was another time I was in the studio, so there was a couple times. Before that I always told him, you know when we would talk, youâve got something special and youâve just got to keep pushing, keep pushing and he reminded me of it. Heâs always been one of the young cats that Iâve always felt very close to.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nWhat did you tell him that day?\n\nMtume\n\nDonât be scared to be you. Thatâs the only thing that you can tell any artist, because, you know what, when you say that thereâs certain truths that you got to face. Maybe you donât have it. You know a lot of people are great in the mirror. But at the end of the day, you got it or you donât. If I donât have it at least I... if Iâm going to go down in flames, itâs going to be with my own matches. I donât need you to light me. Be you and if it happens, great and if it donât, think of something else.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nRight. You did step away from music, is that fair to say?\n\nMtume\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nWhy?\n\nMtume\n\nI didnât feel it. I didnât feel it. Thatâs a delicate place to be. That doesnât mean that I wonât, look, I might wake up tomorrow and feel it. That thing doesnât leave you. More importantly, you leave it. The thing, or as Miles used to say, the thang, the thang is always there, but you got to surrender something to bring something to that. What you surrender, thereâs no room for BS. You have to be committed to that. The other thing, you and I talked about this, I mean, we sit up here talking man. We went through damn near 40 years of music, easy, and I played a lot of different types of music. Itâs not like most people spent pretty much their career in one or two genres. I havenât done it all. Thereâs no such thing. I was a musician. Then I said I wanted to be a writer. Then I said I wanted to produce. Then I said I wanted to put a band together. Then I said I wanted to score. I think, for me now, something I would love to do, I would love to do Bonnie Raitt. Something just that would pull like all of it, itâs been here or here. Iâm not really touched by... I appreciate what I hear but I would need a challenge.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nRight. And youâre return to activism as well.\n\nMtume\n\nYes. The last 20 years I spent on New York radio on a political talk show called Open Line. All the politicians came through. Iâve traveled on several delegations to Cuba, Libya, Sudan, Ghana, South Africa. Pretty much, thatâs the water, thatâs the shape that... When I say I left music, I just started pouring it into some other things. I think, as you and I were talking earlier, I think right now the first interview I did of any serious consequence was with you and Red Bull, when my son hooked it up. This is the second one. I havenât talked about music in 20 years. Not like this. I feel, at this age, I have a lot that I can give. You know experiences, or how this goes, how that goes. Itâs time for me to give that because, you know, once you split, thatâs it. He was cool but he didnât leave us any information.\n\nI used to always joke with people, they say, âMethuselah lived to be 900,â and I say, âYeah, well what else did he do? Yeah well he lived, but what did he do?â âOh, I donât know that.â Iâm glad to be here and anything that I can do to and be of help to about, you got it. Iâm about giving this information to the next generation. Thatâs what itâs about.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nBefore we open it up to questions, I just wanted to know if you thought there was a... through all the different facets of your career, the different phases, is there was a thread that you see that connects them in some way?\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nIf there is any thematic fiber in my career, or that one thing that you could point to, that goes back to what I said earlier: I never lied to the music, and the music never lied to me. When youâre finished with a phase, move on. Move on. Thatâs the only way you expand the music, and being open. Iâve never been one of the old heads that was, âThat ainât nothing because itâs new.â You donât understand it. Well then learn it. Iâve never been threatened by something new. Thatâs what I live for. I live to be inspired by something I havenât heard. How else do you grow? Thatâs why we got too many midgets. We got too many midgets in the world right now. They donât want to grow. Yeah, midget music.\n\n[laughter]\n\nAlways be open to the next thing. I have an 11-year-old granddaughter. She might come up with something next year that Iâve never heard, and you know what, Iâm going to be right at the crib, âAyah, how did you get that sound?â I come out of jazz, and you have to understand in jazz everybody shared. Thatâs the other thing, everybody shared. I had a problem once with some rhythms, odd time signatures. I called Max Roach, a master. You donât have that now. These cats hold on like they got the secret to cancer. You know what Iâm saying? âHow did you get that symbol sound?â or âWhat cord did you play?â You donât grow the music by the music by doing this. [holds his hands to his stomach and crouches] You grow it by that. [spreads his arms apart] If you donât get anything from what Iâm telling you, everything I arrived at, I arrived at because somebody showed me something that I could add to it, but you got to share. Thatâs what I love about when weâre taking the studios rooms. You guys are working together. Youâre sharing. It canât grow by itself. It grows with expanding the sphere of information. Bam, there it is.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nThere it is.\n\n[applause]\n\nAll right, who has a question for Mr. Mtume? Please wait for the microphone.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHey man, nice to meet you. Thank you for being here.\n\nMtume\n\nThank you.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI have a bunch of questions to ask you of course. âRated Xâ sounded amazing on the speakers. Everything sounds incredible. When you were working with Miles, [John Coltrane] obviously passed away in â67, did he express anything... I mean, you said he had a very close relationship with him, did he express anything â\n\nMtume\n\nNo. No. Not with Trane.\n\nAudience Member\n\nNo, with Miles. Did Miles ever express to you anything about Trane?\n\nMtume\n\nOh, thatâs a great question. Iâll tell you one story Miles told me. When he knew Coltrane had to leave the band, they were playing a gig in Philly, and Miles said ... because you know Miles never stayed on the stage, when he finished his solo, he walked off the stage. He said he thought it was the corniest thing for someone to do a solo and stand there. He just got off the and he said... this was after the Kind of Blue album and they were playing all blues, and he went and sat at the bar and was watching Trane, and he said, âIt just kept building and building.â And Miles said he sat there, and he had a drink, and he just started crying, at the bar. He said the reason he started crying, he said, âHeâs got to go. This band canât contain him anymore.â He cried because he knew Trane had to leave.\n\nOne other quick caveat, Trane played one night so long, the cats on the band was like, âOkay man.â You know, because he was trying to find it. So Miles said, âWhyâd you play so long?â Trane said, âMan, I didnât know how to get out of the song.â So Miles said, âTake the horn out of your mouth.â\n\n[laughter]\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nWho else has a question? Wait for the microphone.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHi.\n\nMtume\n\nHi. How are you doing?\n\nAudience Member\n\nGood. Thank you so much. Itâs been wonderful. Okay, this is going to be a little bit hard for me because I have to make the connection. Okay, so you were talking about writerâs block in the beginning... Itâs kinda going to be a couple questions. How old were you when that happened and were any of your peers experiencing the same thing around the same age? And how did you come out of that, like, did you ever have writerâs block again or was it this extreme realization for you?\n\nMtume\n\nIt was a revelation. I had to be 30 something. I donât remember which part in the equation of â30s, but it was somewhere in there. Let me answer the next... Did any of my peers experience it? Iâve never had that discussion, but I know they have, because if youâre in this long enough, youâre going to experience that. If you donât experience it, then that says more about you. You know what I mean? That means that youâre not trying to go somewhere. Youâre not challenged by the fact that youâre not moving. You get out of it simply by burning the bridge. Starting over. Iâm not going to use those cords. Or Iâm not going to use that band structure. You got to change something about the environment that you create in. Some people go away, but I always say thereâs no exit from your mind. I could go somewhere else and write, but that doesnât change the fact that Iâm challenged. Thatâs what I did. That was that period where I said, âYou know what? No more production. Let me concentrate on finding a sound for myself.â Thatâs when I had my greatest revelation musically.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThatâs cool. Thank you. The other part is, so Miles Davis, when he played Woodstock, he saw all the other bands getting more into funk or... he saw what the audience was reacting to and he knew he needed to make a change â\n\nMtume\n\nThatâs not true.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThatâs not true, okay.\n\nMtume\n\nThat was a quote [Wynton] Marsalis made on the Ken Burns talk, I know where you got it, and I hated it. I loved Ken Burns, but I hated it because they used two people, Wynton Marsalis and Stanley Crouch, who are diametrically against what Miles is doing. Wynton a lot less now, but at the time Stanley Crouch... as a matter of fact, I debated Stanley Crouch. Itâs on YouTube, on the subject of Miles and the electric period. I gave him an electric spanking.\n\n[laughter]\n\nBecause a lot of that stuff them guys have been saying â you have to understand Miles character. Miles wasnât about, âYou dogging me, thatâs okay, because Iâm going to give you more by responding to it.â He never said anything, but we had those conversations and how he felt. I knew where you got that, right, but thatâs not true. Miles was evolving. Itâs very interesting. Two things always happened when Miles made his musical change. He changed music maybe about four times, not just at himself, but the direction of music, three or four times. The two things you look at, he changes his woman and he changes the way he dressed. Iâm not even trying to be funny. If you listened to Around Midnight, and those pieces, Milestones, and then you go to the next period Miles in the Sky, heâs dressing differently. By the time we get to Bitches Brew and On the Corner, because he was changing. It had nothing to do with sitting up watching Sly Stone and them and saying, âOh, Iâm just a trumpet player.â I think thatâs how it was said. No, It was honest.\n\nSee, again, if you change because youâre changing to try and get an audience or youâre trying to... Thatâs not real change. Thatâs adaptation. Thereâs a distinction. He didnât adapt. He changed. Thatâs metamorphosis.\n\nAudience Member\n\nDo you know if there was ever any frustration for him in any of those changes or if it just seemed pretty seamless with him?\n\nMtume\n\nNo. I never... and we had hours, thousands of hours of conversation. You know, because Iâm like a sponge when Iâm around them cats. I remember, just quickly, I remember when we were in Brazil. The road manager came and got me, knocking on the door. It was maybe two in the morning. He said, âLook man, Miles needs you right now.â He said, âNo, just come.â I didnât know, so I put on my clothes and I went up. Miles was in the corner crying. He was actually torn, torn. I went over to him and said, âMiles, whatâs happening?â He just looked at me and said, âAll my friends are dead.â That ran through me. Heâs in the corner lamenting. He said, âColtrane, Cannonball [Adderley], you know, Fats Navarro, you know, all the cats. Wynton Kelly. Paul Chambers.â And he had survived, and thatâs what he was... âWhy me?â Iâm sorry. I didnât mean to go off but thatâs the kind of... No, he changed out of the need to change. Not, âOh man, I need to get some costumes and plug in.â No.\n\nAudience Member\n\nIâm sorry, one more question out of curiosity. You were talking about sitting at the table with Dizzy Gillespie and stuff, I was wondering if you ever had any experiences with Thelonious Monk or what was your take on his character?\n\nMtume\n\nThe first time I met Monk... First of all, I think he was the most unique human being Iâd ever been around. A lot of people said he was crazy. No, he was just on another sphere, well, the Thelonious sphere. I think heâs one of the true geniuses that we produced. A lot of people donât know the extent of Monkâs musical knowledge. I mean, Monk was in Julliard, I think in â41. Do you understand? This stuff just doesnât happen. Monk grows out of â he knew all of this music. Then out of that? Again, innovation. He came up with something. He was the architect for the chord structure in bebop.\n\nAudience Member\n\nYeah, heâs very, very spiritual. Seemingly [laughs]. Thank you so much.\n\nMtume\n\nThank you.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nAll right. Whoâs next?\n\nAudience Member\n\nThank you.\n\nMtume\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nAudience Member\n\nIâm fascinated by your interest in Swahili culture â\n\nMtume\n\nYes, sir.\n\nAudience Member\n\nâ because last year I was at a music show and I found a Herbie Hancock record. I saw all the Swahili names â\n\nMtume\n\nYes, sir.\n\nAudience Member\n\nâ and I just wanted to know what prompted that?\n\nMtume\n\nLike I said, I was a member of US Organization, that was a cultural nationalist organization. A lot of times, because I had relationships with these cats, when they come into LA to play, a lot of them would come over. We would have these sessions on Sunday, discussions on Sunday. Sonny Rollins would come through, Yusef, and then Herbie and them came through. They started coming through every time they were in LA, and Herbie and I really connected on the cut you played [on] Kawaida. We just were tight and then his band, I got very close to them. They came one day and just wanted some names. They came with what they felt their best quality was, and we just sat down and went through it and theyâve used it. Itâs just vibrations.\n\nAudience Member\n\nCool. Thank you.\n\nMtume\n\nThank you. I hope Iâm not boring you. Some of yâall might need a break. Go to sleep or something, I donât know. Iâm over here talking too long. Iâm sorry. [laughs]\n\nAudience Member\n\nHi, sir.\n\nMtume\n\nHow are you?\n\nAudience Member\n\nIâm good. Thank you for sharing your truths and your stories with us. My question is in regards to cinema and scoring.\n\nMtume\n\nYes, maâam.\n\nAudience Member\n\nBasically, the cinematic soundtracks, they got this super-clean quality to them â\n\nMtume\n\nIâm sorry. Super what?\n\nAudience Member\n\nClean.\n\nMtume\n\nYes.\n\nAudience Member\n\nâ and just super quality and real life is not super quality. Coming from a jazz background, do you ever get frustrated by it being so clean and not think to yourself and maybe if weâre pushing to do something different, why not make that guy walking down the street sound like that guy walking down the street â\n\nMtume\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nAudience Member\n\nâ really with the music. Just that way. Like, that experience as opposed to this escapist fantasy of what the viewer thinks of this guy walking down the street?\n\nMtume\n\nRight. I think thatâs an excellent question. For me, and I can only give you what I feel, like I said, you donât have to be locked into the time zone of the film that youâre watching. Musically, you can go anywhere. Iâll give you a perfect example. Star Wars. Okay? What was that? Was that future or was that old symphonic? [sings] Dun din dun, din dun. Okay? That worked, for some reason. Youâd be surprised at things youâve already digested that are examples of what Iâm talking about, but itâs not enough of them. Itâs not enough of them.\n\nYou know the ones I hate? I hate to see movies that were shot in another century and the music? Why you composing like that? Itâs also about being, again, that word, open. Music is as virtual as anything. You can put it anywhere if itâs right and if it works. Thatâs the key. If it works, itâs right. Why not try something? How about stumbling a couple of times? You stumble a couple of times, youâd be surprised what you stumble on. I do think thereâs this worship of exactness thatâs really a drag. We worship that. Cats go to school, learn how to play Coltraneâs solo on âGiant Steps.â So what? I can play every note. Okay. Thatâs what he did. What can you play?\n\nWeâre starting to, what I call, Mac music. We take these things and we just become carbon copies. Somebodyâs great because they can play like Sonny Rollins. Thatâs not a reason to be great. Youâre a drag, to me. Youâre just plain copying. Itâs like those paintings that you could buy â I donât know if they still have them â paint-by-numbers? When you follow the numbers, you come out with a portrait or something. You didnât paint it, you followed the numbers. Itâs copycatting. Too much copycat has been able to slide by as legitimate music and legitimate artists and theyâre not. Theyâre copycats, but yâall need to say that.\n\nThe problem is, the public that knows is scared to say something, because then youâre dogged. âOh, youâre playa hating.â No, Iâm not. This shitâs not good! Itâs not good. Yâall need to say more of that because too much is let by because celebrity worship. You gotta just call it out because it wonât move forward. Mac music. Five million served, nobody satisfied.\n\nAudience Member\n\nCool. Thank you so much.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI just had a question about when you stopped doing big arrangements and orchestration. You were talking about go to another place and minimize. When youâre writing those really minimal riffs, like the bass line in âJuicy Fruit,â is it a matter of sitting down and working over this riff until it becomes exactly every note is perfect, what you want it to be, or is it something where it just comes out the first time or is it different all the time?\n\nMtume\n\nWell, for me, and like I said, everybodyâs different. Thatâs a great question. For me, it was like coming from the big orchestration stuff to neo-minimalism. I mean, âJuicy Fruit,â thereâs only four instruments playing, maybe five. You mix it so it sounds bigger than whatâs actually there. You can personify instruments in the mix. In some ways, itâs more challenging to come down, because now, the bass lineâs gotta match something. If we took Juicy, the bass lineâs really not a bass line. Itâs more of a guitar line. [singing] Doo doo, doo doo, doo, doo, doo, bap. Doo doo, doo doo, doo, doo, bang. Doo doo, doo doo, doo, bop. Doo doo, doo doo, do you see? Then you got, little nursery rhyme. Dee, dee dee dee- Okay. Chords. Chords. Everythingâs riding on the inversion of that chord. If I play a different inversion on those chords, the melody doesnât work. Itâs very, very intricate.\n\nAudience Member\n\nDid you take a lot of time perfecting each of those riffs?\n\nMtume\n\nYes. I mean, I want to make sure I understand. Take a lot of time.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWhen youâre writing.\n\nMtume\n\nWhatâs a lot of time?\n\nAudience Member\n\nI donât know [laughs]\n\nMtume\n\nNo, no, no. Iâm not trying to be funny. Iâm just â Iâm trying to make sure Iâm answering your question. If I told you I wrote it in one night, is that a lot of time?\n\nAudience Member\n\nUm, no.\n\nMtume\n\nI had been thinking about it for weeks. See what Iâm saying? Conceptually, even though I said that I laid that drum pattern down, things really kind of opened up, but I had been working off those chords and that sound, Iâd been in there a year.\n\nAudience Member\n\nUh huh, but consolidated it in a night.\n\nMtume\n\nExactly. Exactly, and thereâs no reverb on that album. That was the first album I ever did like that.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThatâs so sick.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHow are you, sir?\n\nMtume\n\nYes, sir. How are you?\n\nAudience Member\n\nItâs a humbling honor to be able to communicate openly with you.\n\nMtume\n\nWell, thank you very much.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI find it perfect that you touched on this whole copycat thing because our good friend, Vince Wilburn has made us aware of a band, Mostly Other People, that made a verbatim-\n\nMtume\n\nThatâs the name of the band?\n\nAudience Member\n\nMostly Other People Do The Killing is the name of the band, and theyâve made a verbatim copy of Kind of Blue.\n\nMtume\n\nOh no!\n\nAudience Member\n\nYou havenât heard about this?\n\nMtume\n\nNo, sir.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThe Miles Davis Estate is vehemently opposing its release and not supporting it at all, but NPR has taken the liberty to showcase it and highlight it.\n\nMtume\n\nNow, let me make sure Iâm clear. They did the record and everybodyâs playing all the exact notes and everything?\n\nAudience Member\n\nThe drummer, every single thing. Every single thing. To the point where, the NPR show will play both recordings and swap between them â\n\nMtume\n\nAnd thatâs really cool?\n\nAudience Member\n\nUndiscernible difference â\n\nMtume\n\nOh my goodness!\n\nAudience Member\n\nâ between the two. I just find it very crazy that you had just mentioned that.\n\nMtume\n\nYeah.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThatâs whatâs going on right now and this band, they really donât understand why people arenât getting it, why people donât dig it.\n\nMtume\n\n[laughs] See, why do that? Why do that? I mean, unless you was doing this for Miles, but thatâs not what Miles wouldâve wanted. I canât even repeat on this mic what I know he would say. Then what are you doing? What are you doing? If itâs getting to that, thatâs kind of scary.\n\nAudience Member\n\nAll right. One other question â\n\nMtume\n\nI donât even like the title of the band.\n\nAudience Member\n\nRight. I didnât like it â\n\nMtume\n\nI ainât even with that.\n\nAudience Member\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nMtume\n\nI donât even have to listen to it. I canât even get past that! Other people, what? Killing, what?\n\n[laughter]\n\nAudience Member\n\nMy other question is more of a technical question, in particular, regarding the mix of Juicy Fruit. You may have been asked this before, especially since itâs your first non-reverb record, which is kind of a groundbreaking concept â\n\nMtume\n\nYes.\n\nAudience Member\n\nâ because we use reverb to hide imperfections, so to speak. But when everything drops out in the background vocals, you can lick me anywhere â\n\nMtume\n\nEverywhere\n\nAudience Member\n\nEverywhere, excuse me. Iâm a little nervous to ask you this question.\n\nMtume\n\nThere are some places you wonât lick.\n\n[laughter]\n\nAudience Member\n\nNo, no, no. Iâve been wanting to ask you this question for twenty years. The vocals get apparently louder. Almost to the point where you wonder, was that intentional?\n\nMtume\n\nYes.\n\nAudience Member\n\nOkay.\n\nMtume\n\nYes, sir.\n\nAudience Member\n\nYou just solved a mystery that is â\n\nMtume\n\nThatâs a legitimate question, because when it drops out, usually you can drop stuff out and then itâs there. I put that in your face.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI was thinking, maybe itâs a limiter. You pushed it.\n\nMtume\n\nI raised that. I want you to hear that.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThatâs very heavy. I want to commend you for that. Thank you. Itâs a great pleasure to talk to you.\n\nMtume\n\nHey man, itâs my pleasure.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nAlright. Who else has a question?\n\nAudience Member\n\nThis is a little bit convoluted, so bear with me. And thank you for being here as well, I should say to start off.\n\nMtume\n\nMy granddaughter loves your shirt. [laughs]\n\nAudience Member\n\n[laughs] Glad I could be of some service here today. When youâre talking about your use of the LinnDrum and itâs technology being a âI feel like this language is crudeâ but a human extension of your body â\n\nMtume\n\nYes.\n\nAudience Member\n\nâ then earlier, you were talking about the many trips you made to Japan with Miles. That idea in Japan in traditional art is very prominent, the idea that technology is an extension of the body. Was that something youâre absorbing consciously, then, on those trips? Was that something that came through later in your work or is this just a more universal concept for you?\n\nMtume\n\nI think itâs a combination of both. Youâre raising a very interesting question for me. As I think about it and ponder what youâre saying, yes, very definitely. You have to understand the context. That clip that you saw that was played? That was 1972 or â73. You can watch that now and it makes sense. This was completely off the wall back then. Not for the listeners. The people that would come, the young? They would be like, âIâve never heard anything in my life like that.â The critics? âThis is bullshit. Miles done lost his mind.â We had these two things, but Iâm watching the guy play the trumpet through a wah wah pedal. Do you understand? Just that alone, and weâre all electrified. All this is happening. My drums were hooked up. I had phase shifters and all. I had the same equipment the guitar players had. I could go [makes electrical sound] and all of a sudden, you watching me play the congas and they sound like something else. We were forging ahead. I must say, Iâve never been asked that question, but definitely. Remember, not just coming to Japan, but that was a working band. We were traveling all over. The idea that we were all these guys committed to this sound, you just have to be open. Youâve just got to be like this [spreads his arms apart] and then find out if youâve got it, or not. Again, because, ultimately, that question will be answered. You can only run but for so long, then your ego gets tired, then youâve got to say, âYo, maybe I donât have this.â Thatâs a great question. Thank you.\n\nAudience Member\n\nCan I ask you another question? Were you more, as far as your drumming and percussion, were you more in the â60s more on the Elvin Jones side?\n\nMtume\n\nWhere do you get these people, man? Thatâs a great question. Thatâs a great question because nobody has ever asked me that. I approached the instrument very differently. I donât like conga players because, I feel, again, theyâre so locked. Boom-boom-bop, boom-boom-bop, all that stuff. First of all, the cat that I come out of was a great percussionist, named Big Black. He used to play with Hugh Masekela, and Dizzy Gillespie, but the people that I molded my sound after was Elvin Jones and Tony Williams. so for you to go there, because most conga players donât play ... I mean I can play in 5, 4, 7, I can do all that, and play it approaching it like a trap drummer. A guy told me once that I was scrambling eggs, he said, âBut itâs the way you scramble them,â and Elvin was... you just play through it, modernize the instrument, modernize the approach. So, yes, I molded myself after Elvin and Tony Williams.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWere you into Rashied Ali, at all?\n\nMtume\n\nAbsolutely. Iâll tell you I was avant-garde, man. Iâve played gigs with more cats that was on the stage than was on the audience. Do you know what I mean? I mean itâd be four of us on the stage, and two of them in the audience, but you play to them like it was 2000. I really played that stuff. Some of it I donât even believe, when I think about it. This one guy we used to play with, named Cailo Cailo, for some reason the student unions loved him in LA, so we used to get all these gigs. He was a trumpet player, but his thing was taking bottles, and busting them, onstage, and the place would go crazy. Glass flying. I said, âWhat am I doing?â Glass was flying all past me, but I was out there. So yes, I loved all the cats.\n\nAudience Member\n\nRight on. One more quick question. What was it like for Dave Liebman and the Band, in the â70s, with all you guys? Was he like part of the crew, or was he more kind of like on his own?\n\nMtume\n\nNo, he wasnât ... you mean on his own like ... like was it apartheid?\n\nAudience Member\n\nYes. No. No, no, no. Was it like everyone was cool? Was everybody like friends, and stuff?\n\nMtume\n\nNo. Dave, look, I loved his playing. Dave never really bought into that sound, but he fit so well. He enjoyed playing it, just like Keith Jarrett loved it. He just lied about it, when he got out of the band, talking about, âI had to play this electronic ...â You look at YouTube, you look, heâs just smiling. Thatâs one other reason Iâm glad of YouTube, because he was a liar, and he was exposed. But Dave played his butt off, and I loved the way, but Dave was still coming more out of the traditional bebop. The rhythm section was totally behind trying to fulfill this dream, and this vision that Miles had.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThatâs what I meant. Thatâs why I ask, because you guys were really far out, and he had more of a, I guess, per se, traditional; but he was very chromatic, still, in his playing.\n\nMtume\n\nDave is a bad man.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nSorry to interrupt. How did you and Al Foster maintain the sonic space, because heâs the drummer, youâre the percussionist; how did you not get in each otherâs way?\n\nMtume\n\nWhen Al first joined the band, Al was not there. Al came in right after On the Corner, and Miles had a meeting with me and Al, and what Miles did, he switched the roles. He said, âYou follow Mtume.â I was the one that was free to play superimposed tempos, like sometimes weâre in four, I might play seven against it. I was totally free, and what he said was he said, âYouâre my Tony.â He was talking about Tony Williams. If you see, he had me next to him because we were playing off of each other. I could have never had that experience playing. I mean itâs Miles, and heâs giving a percussionist basically the direction to take it wherever I wanted to go. Thatâs another great question. Iâve always appreciated Al, because Alâs a hell of a drummer. But Miles was clear, he just wanted the two and four.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ\n\nWhoâs next?\n\nAudience Member\n\nThere was a time when Local 802 and 47 were trying to stop drum machines from replacing people. Any comments, any thoughts on that whole era, that whole time?\n\nMtume\n\nStupid.\n\nAudience Member\n\nStupid.\n\nMtume\n\nStupid. See, first of all, you donât fight technology â you embrace it. Itâs like fire, itâll burn you, or you learn how to cook with it. But you cannot avoid it. Technology is real. Everything is a combination, as Iâve always said, of art and technology. So why would you fight reality? As we speak, everything is moving. The world is actually moving right now. We donât feel it, but itâs on an axis, moving slowly, but everything is in motion. If you close yourself off to anything, how do you grow? Like I said, sheâs going to hear something that none of us in this room can imagine. What will the kids 30 years from now hear? Maybe music will just be [taps his hand on the table] and weâll all go, âDamn.â\n\n[laughter]\n\nAudience Member\n\nHow do we stop these crazy old men with huge funds? How do we stop them from imposing on our creative way of life?\n\nMtume\n\nI donât think you have to stop them. Look what youâre doing here. Look at Red Bull. I donât know, they might be some crazy guys, but look what they put together. Itâs where youâre coming from. This, to me, this is an extraordinary situation, and I was so happy. This is the man that quells my angst, because usually I get bored with interviews because they ask you stupid questions, âWhat color socks did you have on yesterday?â But â\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nIâm going to cross that one off the list, right now.\n\nMtume\n\n[laughs] But, again, they cannot fight change. Donât let that affect you. Are you a musician? What do you play?\n\nAudience Member\n\nI play drum set.\n\nMtume\n\nYou donât play oboe.\n\n[inaudible comment from audience member]\n\nMtume\n\n[laughs] Iâm just teasing.\n\nAudience Member\n\nIâm a producer, firstly.\n\nMtume\n\nFollow it, man. Itâs all this. [places his hand to his heart]\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nWho else has a question, in the back? Can we pass the mic, please?\n\nAudience Member\n\nThank you, so much, for being here. Itâs like the most insane body of work, ever. Just two things you touched on very briefly in the beginning, but the club scene, in New York, and things, and Iâm just wondering if you can share any stories from there, like, Larry Levan was brought up. Were there any DJs that you were looking for, and how was that whole movement for you, obviously coming out of this sort of jazz background and things like that?\n\nMtume\n\nI knew Larry, and then you had the Tunnel. There was a couple of different places. I was not a club guy. I went out occasionally to get a pulse to what people were listening to, but I was kind of at odds with the club scene because it was just getting, you know, New York had become so homogenized, man, and it was really effecting R&B. So, again, I wasnât joking about beats per minute. We were really, it was getting ... I hated that bass line. Doon-dah, doon-dah, doon-dah... aw, come on, man, and everybody was doing club records.\n\nYou know, âJuicy Fruitâ broke in the clubs. Whatâs the joint up in the Bronx? Disco Fever. I remember when we finished the mix, a gy named Scott Folks, who worked at Epic, we finished the 12â, he called me, on night. He said, âMan, I want to take you to this club. I want you to see the peopleâs response to âJuicy Fruit,ââ because I never thought ... thatâs the last thing I thought, was people would dance to it. He said, âOkay, Iâm going to pick you up.â I said, âWell, what time, at 9 or ten?â He said, âWhat?â He said, âIâll pick you up around three.â I said, âWhat do you mean?â He said, âThree in the morning.â He said, âIt ainât even really happening until then,â and he said they usually play âJuicy Fruitâ around somewhere between four and five. So I went with him, and I was just overwhelmed by the response because, again, when youâre creating something. Anybody that tells you, anybody tells you they know what a hit is, is a liar. You donât know. You can only hope that what you felt, and you put in that record, translates, and other people feel the same way. Because if anybody knew that secret, theyâd put it in a bottle, and sell it. You just know what you feel good about, but the club scene I really couldnât comment, other than Disco Fever, and that was more hip-hop.\n\nAudience Member\n\nAnother thing, just like when we were listening to âJuicy Fruitâ earlier reminded me of a track from Dr. John that heâd been playing at jazz set like a year later, in like 1984, and he obviously came from more of a blues background. Was he someone that you were familiar?\n\nMtume\n\nDr. John? Come on, man. Yes. Professor Longhair, Fats Domino, Allen Toussaint â come on now. Youâve got to go to all them schools, you know what I mean, with your ear. Iâm a nerd when it comes to the music. Itâs jazz, funk, R&B because the more you know, the more you can put in your box. Andd then when you put your thing on it, youâve got more to draw from, itâs more information.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI think when I said âfamiliar,â I mean I obviously knew that you had probably have heard of him. [laughs] I mean is he someone that like... Iâm just trying to piece it together in my head. Youâd sort of followed a similar path at that time with the drum machine, like embracing that kind of technology. Was that something that you were aware of?\n\nMtume\n\nThe first time I used the drum machine was actually in 1980 or â81 on an artist that we were doing, called Marc Sadane. That was the 808, the Roland 808; so I had been messing around. Also, I was always into the synthesizers, the Fair Light, stuff like that, that was coming along, all the polyphonic synthesizers. If you listen to all my records after with Juicy on, Iâve just always been, how do you not deny it, so Iâve just always been tried to be in tune with that technology, always.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThank you.\n\nMtume\n\nMy man. You all know Iâm old. Iâm going to have to take a nap, after this, man. [laughs]\n\nAudience Member\n\nOn the subject of technology, you guys were talking about how you enjoyed Stockhausenâs work, and I have a hard time picturing something further apart than Stockhausenâs workshop at the WDR, and, letâs say, Yusef Lateef playing at the [Village] Vanguard. How did you guys actually appreciate it, or what was the environment you would actually consume this music in?\n\nMtume\n\nSame environment I would consume Parliament Funkadelic; same environment I would consume Sam Cooke; same environment I would consume Modern Jazz Quartet. There is no separation, and thatâs a great point youâre making because, for me, Iâm shocked you would think it would require an environment. Itâs all one. Like I said, I can put up âTear the Roof off the Sucker,â and then put on Stravinsky, âRite of Spring.â Whatâs the difference?\n\nAudience Member\n\nWord. On that note ...\n\nMtume\n\nYes, you feel me? Whatâs the difference?\n\nAudience Member\n\nThatâs you saying it.\n\nMtume\n\nThere you go.\n\nAudience Member\n\nYou also mentioned Parliament. You had some heavy good duty cats on personnel, on Juicy Fruit, like Bernie Worrell was playing on there, as well; sax player, Gary Bartz. What was the contribution of these people to the song?\n\nMtume\n\nFirst of all, I played with Gary Bartz in the NTU Troop. I played with Gary for about five years on and off, and heâs one of my favorite alto saxophones, period. Bernie Worrell and I became very good friends, and I actually started using Bernie on a Stephanie Mills project. These were not cats that I just called; these were cats that I admired, and I knew what they could bring to what I was trying to accomplish. Those were the connections on those, and I think you should always try to have heavyweights around you.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nYou produced Gary Barts, too.\n\nMtume\n\nYes, I forgot about that. I actually produced Music is My Sanctuary, I think. I forgot the name of the album.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nâKeep Going On,â right?\n\nMtume\n\nYeah. That song was on there.\n\nAudience Member\n\nIf youâre trying to work with heavyweight cats like that, is that work for hire, or is everyone having a share in the proceedings?\n\nMtume\n\nThey were never in the band. The key components in that phase of the Mtume Band was Tawatha Agee, who was our lead singer, myself, keyboardist Philip Field , and bassist Raymond Jackson. But I would occasionally use other cats who were friends of mine, and also great musicians.\n\nAudience Member\n\nOn the subject of heavyweights, though, for someone who has lived in the era, Smoking Joe, or Cassius Clay?\n\nMtume\n\nIâm from Philly.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThat answers that, I guess.\n\nMtume\n\nOf course, Iâve got to give Joe, but Ali. Not just because of his boxing prowess, but because of what kind of man he was. I lived through that period when he was castigated for his position on the Vietnam War, and the three most productive years of his life was taken from him. So weâll never know how great he really would have been, but what he left us was enough to study. Man, Ali. But Smoking Joe, man, youâre causing, Iâm having a little confusion, man, because thatâs hard. Thatâs hard. He was a great fighter, man.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThanks. Can we get some COD?\n\nMtume\n\nOh, my God. Can we deliver?\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nYou asked for it."
