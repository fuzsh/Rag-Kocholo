        "text": "I love reading the messages you send into the text line when I’m presenting Classic Breakfast. And I often get comments like this from you:\n\n\"I remember this from Bugs Bunny!\"\n\n\"Wasn't this in Tom and Jerry?\"\n\n\"This takes me back to watching Fantasia with my Gran!”\n\n\"KILL THE WABBIT!\"\n\nThroughout the history of cartoons, classical music has often appeared on the soundtracks.\n\nPractical beginnings\n\nMost early cartoons have no dialogue. The music has to do the bulk of the work in helping you interpret what you're seeing.\n\nTo start with, cartoon scores would be compilations of well-known tunes. This helped your ears pick out the story. If you heard a tune you knew, say, about love or war, you'd know more about what was happening on the screen.\n\nInevitably, classical music became an important part of this mix. It would add gravitas and emotion to the capers in the cartoon. But soon the cartoons themselves became built around the music, a lot of the time parodying the peculiarities of the classical music world and the business of going to a concert.\n\nTaking the Mickey\n\nOne of the first examples of classical music in a short cartoon was in 1929, Mickey Mouse in The Opry House. But soon after, that parody element took hold, championed by some of the greatest musical minds of Hollywood.\n\nScott Bradley — you might not have heard his name, but I bet you've heard his music. He was musical director for some of the greatest Tom and Jerry cartoons, and brought classical music to the animation world through such classics as Cat Concerto and Johann Mouse.\n\nOver at Warner Brothers, Carl Stalling was musical director of Looney Toons for nearly 30 years. During that time, he worked on over 600 cartoons. He collaborated with the likes of orchestrator Milt Franklin on such titles as Rhapsody Rabbit, The Rabbit of Seville and What’s Opera, Doc?.\n\nA classical music fantasy\n\nCarl Stalling had previously worked with Walt Disney, where he started a series called Silly Symphonies. And one of them gave rise to the greatest ever marriage of animation and classical music.\n\nIt was 1937 and Walt Disney felt that his star character, Mickey Mouse, needed a bit of a boost. So an elaborate Silly Symphonies episode was planned that used Paul Dukas's tone poem The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Disney had bumped into conductor Leopold Stokowski at a party and it was agreed that he'd conduct the music, with a full symphony orchestra.\n\nThe only problem? The budget was getting way out of control, and Disney knew he wouldn't make the money back on just a short cartoon. So the idea was expanded to a feature-length experiment in animation that included Bach, Beethoven and Stravinsky.\n\nClassical music in cartoons now\n\nThis tradition, it's alive and well, I'm very pleased to say. If you have kids or grandkids, you'll know all about Brisbane-produced show Bluey which is chock full of Beethoven, Bach, Mozart and Holst. Inspiring another generation of classical music lovers."
