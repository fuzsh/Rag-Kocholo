        "text": "Touring drummer April 2021 – Present.\n\nAppeared on BBC’s ‘The One Show” and ‘The Graham Norton Show’, Radio 2’s ‘Breakfast show with Zoe Ball’ and Chris Evans Virgin Radio Show. We’re touring throughout 2022.\n\nTouring drummer for KT Tunstall from Sep 2018 – 2021. Re-created her new album using samples for the live shows, I triggered multiple samples alongside playing drums. We toured UK, Europe, North America & Japan.\n\nI was the touring drummer for Mogwai between Sep 2017 & July 2018 standing in for their drummer Martin Bulloch who was ill. We did a full campaign; touring UK, Europe, Australia, North America, South America & Asia. See video’s ‘here’.\n\n“What. A. Fucking. Drummer. DANG Smash Cat, you SLAYED this tour! Thank you for forever keeping a badass groove on the best tour life evaaaa!”\n\n“Alex [Mackay], who’s been playing guitar, and Cat are amazing musicians. You only really need to show them how to play something once and they’ve got it”\n\n“The real hero of the evening was drummer Cat Myers, just along for the tour, who lashed away at the skins with the sincerity of a religious flagellant. Sweating like a racehorse, Myers’s fervency and precision didn’t seem to decline at all across a two-hour set that demanded energetic drum work on almost every track.”\n\n“Hey y’all! The young lady behind the drum kit is Cat Myers. She played on my recent UK tour and let me tell ya. . . she opened a 2 week can of serious whup ass!! Better hit da woodshed fellas, cuz this Gal can PLAY!!!”"
