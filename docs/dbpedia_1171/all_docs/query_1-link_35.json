        "text": "The music was not done first.\n\nThe animation and editing itself had its own timing grammar, frame tempos were used a lot, especially when it was obvious the music would have to be score with a regular beat, such as with characters marching, skipping, dancing, et cetera. They didn't go willy nilly since the whole affair is a synchronized ballet of sorts.\n\nThe M.E.'s delivered meticulous timing sheets and the composers used all the old school sync-scoring techniques.\n\nCues were split into manageable chunks at logical start-stop points, very roughly on average about 30 seconds.\n\nComposer's had sheets of music snippets that they traded with each other and used as quick references they would adapt as needs be to make the process more efficient.\n\nI am told it was not for the faint of heart, and some composers only did it once and that was enough. The style was restored back in the early 90's by Bruce Broughton and his crew on Tiny Toons.\n\nDo you know if there was back and forth between the composers and animators?\n\nI'm guessing back then, theater was a big deal for either motion pictures or plays. There was no color TVs in every living room and everyone used to dress up to go out to the theaters for entertainment. Even to watch cartoons. I grew up watching cartoons on black and white TVs. It's no surprise musicians put their backs into things back then we may take for granted today. Even doing the animation was super tedious I can imagine. But, I'm still trying to wrap my head around how it all came together from animation studio to the orchestra. Manageable chunks seems to make a lot of sense.\n\nDo you know if there was back and forth between the composers and animators?\n\nI'm guessing back then, theater was a big deal for either motion pictures or plays.

But, I'm still trying to wrap my head around how it all came together from animation studio to the orchestra. Manageable chunks seems to make a lot of sense.\n\nMost of what I know about this I learned from a composer I studied with a little more than a decade after he worked on the Tiny Toons series at Warner, which was straight-up Stalling style. He was Bruce's favorite and he scored a good number of episodes. There was another guy who did one episode and likened it to holy hell and never did another.\n\nBack in the 40's and 50's, all of the animation was done in Burbank. In the early 90's with Tiny Toons, key frames were done in Burbank, and tweening was done much less expensively by tweening houses in South Korea.\n\nThe composers will typically hit keyframes, not all of them, but many. The animation collective in Burbank (Warner, Disney, Hanna Barbera, etc.) had books of pretty well established standards they had to go by since the animation and the music were two sides of the same coin and it all had to fit like a unit. But sometimes they deviated for whatever reason, and it could cause problems.\n\nOne such time happened with Bruce himself, when there was an explosion and a bunch of houses were falling intact on the ground and forming a neighborhood as if by happenstance. The hit-gags he wrote for each house landing weren't lining up as well as the Bruce and the M.E. preferred and there was nothing to be done on the stage, so the hits were recorded separately then and there and layered in by the M.E.\n\nThe only music that was recorded before the animation was the musical set pieces where a known piece of music (Tom and Jerry's Liszt routine, etc.) or other source music was featured and the animation had to be synced to it. And for the marches and dances the animators had to make sure everyone was on the correct foot. Dialogue was of course recorded before everything.\n\nI see from this interview with Carl Stalling that the music was often recorded to a click track, sometimes before the animation was done, and sometimes afterwards. Obviously, if there was a pre-existing song a character was singing to, the timing was known prior to animating:\n\nMB: You invented the \"tick\" system of recording music for animated cartoons, didn't you? Do you recall the circumstances that led to that?\n\nCS: The \"tick\" system was not really an invention, since it was not patentable. Perfect synchronization of music for cartoons was a problem, since there were so many quick changes and actions that the music had to match. The thought struck me that if each member of the orchestra had a steady beat in his ear, from a telephone receiver, this would solve the problem. I had exposure sheets for the films, with the picture broken down frame by frame, sort of like a script, and twelve of the film frames went through the projector in a half second. That gave us a beat.\n\nMG: ... If you chose a twelve-frame beat. You had other beats, too.\n\nCS: Six, eight, ten, etc., depending on the kind of music used. We made recordings of \"tick\" sounds at different beats—a tick every eight frames, or ten frames, or twelve frames—and played this on a phonograph connected to the recording machine and to earphones. Each member of the orchestra had a single earphone, and listened to the clicks through that. It wasn't necessary for the conductor to give a beat, but I did, because one or two of the musicians didn't like to use the earphones. We had a woman 'cello player at Warner's, and she didn't like to use the earphones because they hurt her head or something. She was a fine 'cellist, so we couldn't criticize her too much, and she didn't get off the beat much.\n\nMG: Did you record before the animation was completed, or after?\n\nCS: Both, but usually before. The animators and I all worked from that same exposure sheet, and I just recorded from our beat, without seeing the picture. By the time they had the picture ready, I had the recorded music ready.\n\nUb Iwerks worked out a system that used a horizontal line before the click track was popularized:\n\nMB: Wilfred Jackson has said that there was another line system that Ub Iwerks worked out, based on your system. He said that Ub animated a horizontal line rising and falling, and that the line was photographed at different speeds so that the complete cycle of rising and falling took eight frames, or twelve frames, or whatever the beat happened to be. He said that these loops of film would then be projected on a screen that the orchestra could watch as they recorded the music.\n\nCS: Yes, we did that for a while. We used the line moving up and down for the fifth and sixth Mickey Mouse cartoons, The Op'ry House and When the Cat's Away, and then we started using the \"tick\" system on The Skeleton Dance.\n\nAs mentioned in other posts, cartoons were scored in sections. Carl Stalling noted that musicians seemed to look forward to scoring cartoons, as they tended to have some of the more interesting music:\n\nCS: The musicians said they enjoyed the cartoons more than anything else. They looked forward to coming down to record the cartoons. It was screwy stuff, you know. A cartoon score was usually made up of about ten sections. We'd run through a section once or twice—usually just once—and then record it. We had a wonderful orchestra at Warner's. It took about three hours to record a cartoon score.\n\nIncidentally, the term Mickey Mousing refers to a music score where the music is timed to match almost all the action happening on the screen. Disney pioneered this technique, but eventually the novelty wore off and it was generally avoided."
