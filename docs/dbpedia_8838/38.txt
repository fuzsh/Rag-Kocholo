BIO

The beginnings of Hollywood-based rockers The Flys lay in informal jam sessions between eventual members James Book (bass), Peter Perdischizzi (guitar), Adam Paskowitz (vocals), and Nicky Lucero (drums). Eventually another singer/rapper, Joshua Paskowitz joined the band. By merging alterna-rock with retro sounds, The Flys took a far more original approach than the majority of other late-90's alternative bands. The Flys are best known for their memorable smash hit single, "Got You Where I Want You" found on their Holiday Man cd.
