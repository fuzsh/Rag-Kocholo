        "text": "The Flys were a British punk rock band that originally formed in 1976 in Coventry, England. After the self-release of their initial EP, Bunch of Fives, they were signed by EMI Records. With EMI they released the albums Waikiki Beach Refugees and Own.\n\nIn 1980 they changed labels to Parlophone but soon disbanded. Flys evolved from a band from Coventry, England named Midnight Circus. Midnight Circus was composed of Dave Freeman (guitar, vocals), Joe Hughes (bass), Neil O'Connor (vocals, guitar, keyboard & brother of singer Hazel O'Connor), and \"a string of unnamed drummers\".\n\nIn 1976 their manager's brother, Pete King, joined in on drums and Flys were born. After a couple of albums and several singles, the band split up in 1980. David Freeman and Joe Hughes later formed The Lover Speaks in the mid 80's, which Annie Lennox did a cover of their song, No More 'I Love You's, which reached number 2 on the UK singles chart in 1995.\n\n[]\n\nThe band's second session in 1978 had a track called Name Dropping, which mentioned John Peel in the intro.\n\nOn his 18 October 1979 show, Peel mentioned that the Flys came to see him with a crate of ale, which led to him playing four tracks from their album, commenting afterwards that they sound a bit like Gary Numan.\n\nIn total, The Flys did three sessions for his shows. Peel also revisited the band in the 90's, when he played some tracks from them.\n\nSessions[]\n\n'Love And Molotov Cocktail' from #2 available on Various Artists: Movement: BBC Radio 1 Peel Sessions 1977-1979 2xCD, 2011 (EMI ‎– CDPEEL 7779)\n\n1.
