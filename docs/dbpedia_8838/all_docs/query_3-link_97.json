        "text": "At some point, everyone has had a peaceful moment indoors ruined by the sudden buzzing of a fly by their head. At that moment, you’re probably wondering “where did all of these flies come from?” It’s a valid question. Especially when it seems like your house is fly-free one moment and swarming with pests the next. This is a common insect problem people deal with, and it’s frustrating, to say the least. Luckily, we have the answer to this pervasive question, plus tips on how to help you end the suffering.\n\nFlies Breed… A Lot!\n\nFlies have a short lifespan, so what’s the point in trying to battle them, right? Wrong. While adult house flies only live an average of 15 to 30 days, they breed during their entire adulthood, laying more and more eggs in the short time that they’re alive. House flies typically lay over 100 eggs at once and can repeat this process 5 to 6 times during their adult lifespan. So, what started out as one little fly pestering you can quickly turn into hundreds. Now that you understand how quickly this problem can get out of control, it’s also important to understand why they show up in the first place.\n\nYou’re Accidentally Attracting Flies\n\nThere are many aspects of your home that are attractive to house flies. Like many flying insects, flies are drawn in by heat, light, and food. Read on to learn more about how and why these things attract flies to your home, plus tips on what you can do to reduce these attractants.\n\nHeat – Flies are attracted to homes and other buildings due to the heat they radiate. Once inside, the warm temperatures help flies breed. Fly eggs require warm conditions to develop into larvae. Temperatures of 75 degrees Fahrenheit and above give them the perfect environment to thrive. If you begin noticing flies indoors, try keeping the temperature in your home below this ideal zone. Cooler temperatures can help prevent eggs from hatching and worsening your problem.\n\nLight – You’ve most likely spotted flies (and other flying insects) fluttering around lights at night. This is because flies are positively phototactic insects, which means they are naturally attracted to light – even artificial ones. Bright lights being on at night can cause flies to enter your home. Try reducing the number of bright lights on after dark, or keep shades closed to avoid inviting them when the lights are on.\n\nFood – No surprise here! Like most insects, flies come inside because they’re looking for an easy meal. Flies are particularly on the hunt for rotting food matter. This can include food scraps in your trash can or even in your garbage disposal. Avoid keeping your garbage close to the entrances to your home or at least make sure to empty it often and clean the trashcan as needed. Check your disposal for leaks and make sure to sanitize it regularly.\n\nYou’re Letting Them In\n\nThis one might seem obvious, but it’s important not to overlook it. You may not be doing enough to keep flies from getting into the house. Easy openings into your home are an invitation to flies and any other insect that wants to come in and enjoy the many attractants listed above. Avoid leaving exterior doors open. Make sure all of your windows have screens and there are no holes in them. Check for gaps around the window and door frames. Sealing off entry points is half the battle!\n\nIf you’ve struggled with house flies, we’re betting you’re fed up. We don’t blame you! Chasing every fly around with a swatter just won’t cut it when your house is swarming with them. Who has that kind of time? It’s time to take action with TERRO®. Follow our tips and check out our solutions below to eliminate house flies from your abode once and for all.\n\nDiscreetly trap them indoors – When you’re battling flies inside your home, the last thing you want is to see dead flies everywhere. Enter: the TERRO® Discreet Indoor Fly Trap. This decorative indoor trap boasts an attractive design to effortlessly blend in with your décor. The simple pattern on the trap paired with the dark surface of the glue boards creates a high contrast that prevents you from having to see the trapped insects. The trap uses a food-based lure to attract flies into the trap housing. The lure, while tantalizing to flies, is odorless to humans.\n\nTarget your trashcans – As we already mentioned, one of the primary attractants for flies is your outdoor trashcan. TERRO® Garbage Guard® attaches discreetly to the underside of your outdoor garbage bin to protect against a variety of flying and crawling insects. Once inside, the pod releases an odorless vapor that deeply penetrates the enclosed space to kill visible and hiding insects, as well as prevent new infestations. No more maggots inside your bins! By preventing flies from breeding outside your home, you’ll have fewer to worry about indoors.\n\nBait them outside – Give flies a reason to stay outdoors! Stopping flies from entering your home in the first place is half the battle. TERRO® Wasp & Fly Traps attract and trap a variety of bothersome flying insects, including flies, wasps, yellow jackets, and fruit flies. The trap will allow flies to seek a tantalizing food source outdoors, rather than seeking one in your home. They’ll go into the trap expecting a treat, and find they are unable to leave!\n\nOnce you’ve gotten rid of the flies, it’s important to take preventative steps so new flies don’t come right back in. Check out our tips for preventing flies in your home.\n\nLearn More"
