        "text": "They had been around since the mid seventies in the guise of Midnight Circus but with the times a changing however, they wisely changed their name to the more punkish' The Flys'. Ironically they were signed by EMI who had rejected them as Midnight Circus!\n\nAs opposed to the more traditional 1234 buzzsaw style of punk The Flys come at it from a different angle while still retaining the sense of urgency. Sounding like the Cure or vice versa on the brilliantly entitled single Love & Molotov Cocktail / Can I Crash Here / Civilization (1978 EMI). Try also Waikiki Beach Refugees / We Don't Mind The Rave (1978 EMI). By then not a trace of punk as we know it Jim but catchy. In fact listen to it closely and hell, they could have flogged it to Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers! For what its worth Neil O'Connor was Hazel O'Connor's brother. Wow!"
