        "text": "Fruit Fly Biology\n\nIt can seem as if fruit flies come from out of nowhere to infest a home. This perception is due to the pests' quick breeding, development, and love of human foods.\n\nFruit flies typically lay their eggs directly on rotting fruits and vegetables or else inside drains that are not kept clean. The pests may produce up to 500 offspring during any mating season, and it only takes about a week for the entire life cycle to conclude. As such, fruit fly populations get out of hand fast.\n\nWhere Do Fruit Flies Come From in the House?\n\nInfestations have to start somewhere. Fruit flies move into kitchens, bathrooms, and basements if they sense a food source. Overripe fruit on the counter or any fermenting matter in drains, mops, and trash bins appeals to them. Unsuspecting homeowners may also bring these pests inside on garden crops.\n\nWhen Are They a Problem?\n\nThe smell of ripening fruit and decomposing produce attracts these insects. While fruit flies become a pest problem throughout the year, generally they are most likely to be an inside pest during the summer and fall if food is abundant. However, they can also be a problem year-round.\n\nFruit Fly Prevention & Removal\n\nDetermining where fruit flies come from helps with controlling an indoor infestation. To make homes less welcoming to the pests, remove fruit fly sources of food. Promptly dispose of old, decomposing produce, clean drains regularly, and wipe up drink spills.\n\nSince fruit flies spread disease-causing bacteria, issues with these insects be serious. Instead of attempting DIY control, residents should contact professionals. The expert staff at Orkin understands fruit fly management.\n\nFruit Fly\n\nColors\n\nFruit Fly Behavior\n\nFruit Fly Gnats"
