        "text": "American rock band\n\nThe Flys were an American rock band, formed in Hollywood[1] in 1994 by Adam Paskowitz and Josh Paskowitz. They are the sons of Doc Paskowitz, described by the New York Times as the \"First Family of Surfing.\"[2] The band has shared the stage and toured with many other well known acts and rock bands, but have been on indefinite hiatus since 2012.\n\nTheir 1998 alternative top five hit \"Got You (Where I Want You)\", was produced by Chris Goss, and the video featured actors Katie Holmes and James Marsden. \"Got You (Where I Want You)\" was on their second album Holiday Man in 1998 and appeared on the soundtrack for the 1998 MGM film Disturbing Behavior, starring Holmes and Marsden. The single reached No. 5 on the Modern Rock Charts and the album reached No. 109 on Billboard.\n\nA second single, \"She's So Huge,\" was featured in the 2001 film Sugar & Spice, and The Crow: Salvation soundtrack, along with \"What You Want.\" \"She's So Huge\" peaked at No. 32 on Modern Rock Charts.[3] In 2000, The Flys released their third album, Outta My Way. The album contained the single \"Losin' It\", as well as two samples from two songs by the Beach Boys from their Pet Sounds album, \"Here Today\" and \"Caroline, No\".[4][5]\n\nAround 2007, the band recruited actor/musician Jordan Lawson to play bass, Rob Jones to play drums, and George Castells to play guitar. In 2008, they announced on their MySpace page that they had returned with an iTunes single (a cover of the Beatles' \"Hey Jude\") along with a remake of their biggest hit, entitled \"Got You Where I Want You 2008.\" The Flys toured many times during the band's lifespan, opening for other well known groups. After their last tour, the band went on hiatus.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of studio albums, with selected chart positions Title Details Peak chart positions US\n\n[6] 25 Cents\n\nReleased: July 11, 1995[7]\n\nLabel: Raid America\n\nFormats: CD\n\n— Holiday Man\n\nReleased: August 25, 1998[8]\n\nLabel: Trauma\n\nFormats: CD, cassette\n\n109 Outta My Way\n\nReleased: April 11, 2000[9]\n\nLabel: Trauma\n\nFormats: CD\n\n—\n\nGuest appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nList of guest appearances, showing year released and album name Title Year Album \"Crazy Train\"[10] 1999 Universal Soldier: The Return \"What You Want\"[11] 2000 The Crow: Salvation\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\nList of music videos, showing year released and directors Title Year Director(s) \"Got You (Where I Want You)\" 1998 Wayne Isham\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
