        "text": "Flies are a vital part of our ecosystem, as they are scavengers that consume dead and decaying matter. While flies are essential, there’s nothing more annoying than hearing their buzzing wings flying around your head. Typically, flies live outdoors. However, flies can certainly make their way into your house through windows and doors.\n\nThough it isn’t unusual to see flies zooming or crawling around your house every once in a while, if you’re suddenly bombarded with flies, it can be a cause for concern. A fly infestation can be seriously problematic. Flies can carry disease, which can then spread throughout your home and potentially infect you and your loved ones.\n\nWhy Do I Suddenly Have So Many Flies in My House?\n\nUnderstanding Fly Behavior\n\nFlies are a diverse group of insects belonging to the order Diptera, characterized by having a single pair of wings. Understanding their behavior is crucial in addressing infestations. Flies are attracted to environments with ample food sources and suitable breeding grounds. Common indoor fly species include house flies (Musca domestica), fruit flies (Drosophila spp.), and drain flies (Psychodidae spp.).\n\nHouse flies are attracted to decaying organic matter and can lay hundreds of eggs in moist areas like garbage, pet waste, or compost. Fruit flies are drawn to ripe or fermenting fruits and vegetables, as well as sugary substances like spilled juice or soda. Drain flies thrive in moist environments such as clogged drains, sewage systems, or standing water.\n\nWhy Are There So Many Flies in My House?\n\nIf there are an overwhelming number of flies in your home, you’re probably wondering why. What attracts the flies or where do flies come from? There can be several reasons why you have many small flies in your home.\n\nBelow, we’ll cover some of the most common reasons why flies enter your home. And, provide solutions that you can use to get rid of flies in your home.\n\nDecaying Matter\n\nDecaying matter is one of the most common causes of a fly infestation in and around your home. As mentioned previously, flies are scavengers and eat dead and dying matter. When flies find decaying matter, they move in to consume them. Not only that, but adult flies lay their eggs in the matter as well – and they lay a whole lot of them.\n\nNeedless to say, when those eggs hatch, well, you’ll be inundated with flies. Therefore, if you find that you suddenly have a lot of flies in your house, chances are there’s decaying matter somewhere.\n\nNo matter how clean you keep your house, you probably have some rotting food somewhere. For example, garbage cans and garbage disposals. These spots are prime breeding grounds for flies.\n\nWarm Weather\n\nFlies need specific conditions to lay eggs that will survive. If those conditions are met, the eggs will grow into larvae. The larvae will grow into adult flies, and the life cycle continues. As mentioned earlier, flies lay their eggs in dead and decaying organic material.\n\nHowever, to survive, they also need warmth. Typically, temperatures of 75 degrees and higher are ideal for most fly species. If your home has been overrun with flies, look in your home for places that are favorable for fly eggs.\n\nA few examples of some of the spots that can offer ideal temperatures for fly growth are:\n\nBathrooms\n\nLaundry rooms\n\nAround appliances\n\nHot water heaters\n\nDishwashers\n\nFridges\n\nLong Lifespan and Fast Breeding\n\nBelieve it or not, the lifespan of a fly is a lot longer than you probably realize. The average fly lives between 15 to 30 days. They also breed very quickly. How does their long lifespan contribute to the sudden onslaught of flies in your house?\n\nIf you see a few or even just one fly buzzing around your house and you don’t swat it, it could lay eggs. Then, those eggs will hatch, and become adult house flies. Those adults will lay more eggs, and before you know it, the situation will worsen, and a cluster of flies will appear. Most importantly, you should know that all it takes is a single fly to cause a fly infestation.\n\nHelpful Tips to Combat Flies in Your House\n\nPreventing and controlling fly infestations requires a multi-faceted approach focused on sanitation, exclusion, and, if necessary, chemical control methods. Here are some practical measures to combat the fly problem around your home:\n\nKeep things clean! Not only should the trash be taken out frequently, but the trash cans should be cleaned out as well. Trash is one of the main food sources for flies.\n\nReduce the temperature in areas where the flies seem to be originating.\n\nInspect existing screens, install new screens, and don’t leave doors and windows open for a long time. Seal cracks, gaps, and openings in doors, windows, and walls to prevent flies from entering.\n\nStore food in sealed containers to prevent access to flies. Clean spills and crumbs promptly, especially in kitchen and dining areas.\n\nUse fly traps to catch them.\n\nRepair leaking pipes, faucets, and other sources of standing water. Ensure proper drainage around the home to eliminate breeding sites for flies.\n\nAct fast! If you see even just one fly, be sure to take care of it immediately.\n\nWhen to Seek Professional Help\n\nWhile many fly infestations can be effectively managed through proactive measures, there are instances where professional intervention may be necessary. Consider contacting pest control professionals if:\n\nThe problem persists despite efforts to control it.\n\nThe source is difficult to locate or inaccessible.\n\nThere are health or safety concerns associated.\n\nThe infestation involves potentially harmful or nuisance species of flies.\n\nProfessional pest control services can assess the severity of the infestation, identify contributing factors, and implement targeted strategies to eradicate flies safely and effectively. They may also provide guidance on preventive measures to reduce the risk of future infestations.\n\nAre you in need of fly control services in Omaha or surrounding areas?
