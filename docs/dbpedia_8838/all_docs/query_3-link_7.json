        "text": "What Are Fruit Flies?\n\nThe scientific name for the fruit fly is Drosophila melanogaster. The word âdrosophilaâ means lover of dew. The species needs access to plenty of water in order to survive.Â\n\nWhat do fruit flies look like? Adult fruit flies have the typical fly body plan â theyâre just much smaller than many other fly species. The average adult is 0.12 inches long and 0.08 inches wide.\n\nThe typical adult has a tan or black-brown body color and a rounded head. They have small antennae on their heads, three simple eyes, and large compound eyes. Their eyes are usually red.Â\n\nFruit flies only have a single set of wings that come from the center of their abdominal region.\n\nGnats vs. fruit flies. Gnats are also members of the fly family. Compared to fruit flies, they have thinner bodies. They're darker â gnats are all black.\n\nWhat do fruit flies eat? Fruit flies at all stages of development survive off of fruits. Adults also eat rotting plants. Freshly hatched larvae survive exclusively off of the food that theyâre laid on. This is one of the main reasons theyâre considered a common household pest.\n\nWhere Do Fruit Flies Come From?\n\nFruit flies originated in certain parts of the tropics. Human activity has spread them to every continent except Antarctica. They prefer temperate climates where they can access plenty of water.Â\n\nDuring colder months, you can find them trying to hide indoors, particularly in areas where you have a lot of food stored.\n\nWhy Do You Get Fruit Flies?\n\nYou likely have fruit flies because you have a lot of exposed food in an area. This is particularly true if you have fruit lying out in the open. Theyâre attracted to rotten and fermented fruits and vegetables as well as:Â\n\nWine\n\nBeer\n\nVinegar\n\nFruit juice\n\nEven unripened fruit is vulnerable to fruit flies. In fact, they prefer to lay their eggs on unripened fruit. This way, it will last until the eggs hatch.\n\nLife Cycle of Fruit Flies\n\nNo matter where in the U.S. you live, fruit flies can show up on your kitchen counters or inside your trash can. They are most common in the late summer and early fall. That's because they're attracted to ripe and rotting food.\n\nFruits and vegetables â especially bananas, melon, tomatoes, squash, and apples â are their favorites. Rotten onions and potatoes are also a big draw.Â\n\nAn adult female fruit fly can lay up to 2,000 eggs on the surface of anything that's moist and rotting. The eggs hatch into larvae, which eat the decayed food. The larvae mature into adults within a couple of days. Two days after they emerge as adults, they're ready to mate, and the females can lay more eggs.\n\nFruit fly lifespan. Several things influence the fruit fly life cycle, including the air temperature. Depending on conditions, an adult fruit fly can live as long as 30 days.\n\nHealth Risks of Fruit Flies\n\nResearch shows that fruit flies can transfer germs from a dirty surface onto a clean one. Some of the bacteria they may carry include salmonella,E. coli, and listeria. These three germs each cause food poisoning. Severe cases may put you in the hospital and can even be life-threatening.\n\nFruit flies can become a huge financial burden when they invade food storage facilities. A large infestation can consume and destroy a lot of food in a relatively short period of time.Â\n\nIn your own home, the main threat that fruit flies pose is in their ability to ruin your fruit.Â\n\nDo fruit flies bite? Fruit flies don't bite humans.Â\n\nHow to Get Rid of Fruit Flies\n\nTo get rid of all the fruit flies in your home, you'll need to find where they are breeding:\n\nFruit flies in the bathroom. Fruit flies lay their eggs in moist areas, which means they can show up in your bathroom. A mop or bucket that has wet residue can attract them. Flies may be getting into your house through window screens. You may need 16 mesh or finer to keep them out.Â\n\nFruit flies in drains. Drains are wet and may have scummy residue in them, which makes them an ideal fruit fly breeding spot. If you think a drain might be harboring fruit flies, tape a plastic food-storage bag over it and let the plastic sit overnight. If you find fruit flies trapped in the bag, the drain is infested. Clean your drains regularly and sanitize with boiling water. You may need to use a brush and industrial drain cleaner.\n\nFruit flies in plants. Dry the soil out to eliminate the breeding spot. Spreading sand on top of the soil may help.Â\n\nFruit flies in the kitchen. Get rid of produce â bananas and tomatoes are common culprits â that are attracting the flies. Inspect anywhere you store fruit or vegetables, including potatoes and onions. Fruit flies can breed in drawers where you keep produce. Check under your refrigerator for spills. Wipe down counters and all surfaces. You may need to empty your garbage each night and clean out the can. Do the same with recycling bins.Â\n\nFruit fly spray. You can buy sprays to kill fruit flies, but they will kill only the hatched adults, not the eggs or larvae. Look for products that contain pyrethrum.\n\nHow to Make a Fruit Fly Trap\n\nDo-it-yourself fly traps for fruit flies are very easy to make, and theyâre versatile, too. These homemade fly traps can be made from things you probably have at home already.\n\nSupplies youâll need:\n\nA glass or plastic cup or jar. A clear container is best so you can see how well itâs working and when itâs time to switch it out for a new one.\n\nA lid that fits snugly. This can be a plastic lid or some plastic wrap held on with rubber bands. The lid that typically comes with glass jars wonât work, as you need to be able to poke holes in it.\n\nRubber bands, if youâre using plastic wrap\n\nToothpicks or something equally thin and pointy\n\nA liquid to attract the fruit flies. Fruit flies are most attracted to fermenting things, so water with yeast in it or apple cider vinegar are both excellent options. You can also use wine or a piece of over-ripe fruit.\n\nFlypaper (optional)\n\nHow to make a fruit fly trap:\n\nSet out your jar or cup. If youâre using apple cider vinegar, fill it a few inches deep. If youâre planning to use yeast and water, pour a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of warm water and add a package of dry activated yeast. Add a teaspoon of sugar to activate the yeast and mix. In a few moments, youâll notice the mixture starting to foam. This is normal.\n\nIf youâd like, you can also add a piece of flypaper inside the jar. This helps trap the bugs and makes sure they canât escape.\n\nCover the lid with plastic. If youâre using a plastic lid, make sure itâs snug. If youâre using something like plastic wrap or a plastic bag, secure it with a rubber band. For glass jars, you can also use a canning ring.\n\nPoke small holes in the lid. These holes can't be bigger than an eighth of an inch, or the flies may be able to escape. Toothpicks are great for this, but you can also use things like sharp pencils.\n\nWait â the flies should arrive soon.\n\nThe fruit flies that crawl into your trap won't be able to get out. Some of the captured females may lay eggs, which will hatch.Â\n\nYour second-generation fruit flies will take about 10 days to mature. At this point, you may want to dump the contents of your trap. If you dump in down the drain, be sure to flush it with hot water.Â\n\nIf you still have fruit flies, make a new trap and start the process again.Â"
