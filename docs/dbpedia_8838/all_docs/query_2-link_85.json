You might not recall the name of the band or the song but, the melody or riff is something that has stuck in your head for a long time. One song that is like that for me is “Got You (Where I Want You)” by The Flys. I’ve always remembered the song title but never the band name. You might even recall the song being featured in the movie, Disturbing Behavior, starring Katie Holmes and James Marsden. No matter what, this is one of those 90’s songs that will always take you back to that time.\n\nThe Flys- Got You (Where I Want You):"
