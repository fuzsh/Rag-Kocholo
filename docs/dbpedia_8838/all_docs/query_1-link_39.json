        "text": "Instagram will instantly make videos out of your photos if you want. with an Instagram post, you can add 10 photos if you want to, but you can use an unlimited number of Photos if you want it to make a video. As long as you pick less than 18 photos, it will let you add music that it has to your videos and automatically does for you. If you want it to make a video instead of clicking post, click âreelâ. it will automatically then make a video out of your photos, and it will put them in the order in which you selected them. Here is a big tip once it makes the videos it gives you a list of suggested songs that would go well with your subject of photos. here is the bomb tip. Instead of picking one of those songs click the button that says skip and it will then take a screen that has a couple things you can do - click the circle at the top that has a âmusical noteâ in it. It will then open up a search box where you can type in absolutely any song that was ever recorded on the planet Earth it is unlimited. Sometimes I type in a song and it gives me a choice of up to 10 different artist that I didnât even know covered the song.\n\nNow I will be completely honest with everyone who reads this review\n\nWhoever is new coming to instagram be prepared for the difficult understanding of the app. I am a long time user of this platform and I believe there no problem with instagram besides one thing, itâs their making account process. I have been trying to make an back up account for myself for the last 2 hours and I have been getting to the same spot over and over. When I was making the account at first the app wasnât letting me make an account. So I decide to use their website and the website let me make the account and log into the account as well but the app it wouldnât let me make not log in. I have tried many different methods like changing the password, using the digital code(which is supposed to be 6 number digit but I got an email sent with 8 digits.) On top of that the link they sent didnât work as well. The only time I did log onto the account was when I had to go into the app and log on through the website on the app. When that happened I still couldnât get on the account and then I thought maybe the link would work since I already have the account connect to the meta thing. Then when I do that I get logged out of both of the account. This is totally unacceptable and unprofessional service from the developer behalf because making account is the main key of the whole instagram and it donât make sense why itâs so bugged.\n\nI don't wanna be mean but I have had an issue with your recent update, which allows users to put a 30 second music clip on their notes with that i a havenât even gotten the update to add notes which is such and inconvenience. I have not received this update, although all of my friends have. I have tried to be patient, & I have also tried fixing it. I restarted my phone, I updated my phone, I deleted the app, I logged out of my account, I tried updating the app multiple times, & nothing. No music option on my notes. I don't understand why I am being excluded. I am hurt, & overall shocked that Instagram could exclude someone like this. I would appreciate if you would give me this update. I don't find it nice to be excluding anyone from your updates, & I don't know why you chose me to exclude. But it is unfair, and I would like to receive this update as soon as possible. I think I deserve this. I have since gotten over it, but now I cannot let you exclude me any longer. Please give me this update, I do not deserve this. It's truly disgusting & rude of you to just leave me out. I really want this update, I am so mad you chose to leave me out of this update, out of all of the updates you have made. I love music, & I really would like to put it on my notes. I don't know why you're targeting me like this, but it needs to stop. Please provide me with this update, would love to put music on my notes."
