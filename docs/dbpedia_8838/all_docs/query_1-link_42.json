Flight One is the popular-music group and Spirit of Freedom is a brass ensemble with a percussionist and vocalist. Periodically, these groups combine to form the expanded Band of Flight.\n\nThe Band of Flight presents more than 250 performances annually, providing quality musical products for official military functions and ceremonies as well as civic events and public concerts. Under the command of Lt Col Amy Justus and the direction of CMSgt David McCormick, the band supports functions for the 88th Air Base Wing, Air Force Material Command and the state of Ohio.\n\nAir Force Bands inspire immediate, positive and long-lasting impressions of the United States Air Force and the United States of America in the hearts and minds of our audiences. As one of 10 active-duty Air Force and 5 Air National Guard bands, the Band of Flight is committed to supporting the mission and vision of the US Air Force through their musical and military endeavors.\n\nMission: To Fly, Fight, and Win... Airpower Anytime, Anywhere."
