        "text": "She (along with actresses Tangi Miller and Alyson Hannigan) is a spokesperson for breast cancer, and will appear in a new four page brochure (to be featured in Vogue, Glamour, Self, Mademoiselle, and Women's Sports and Fitness) to raise awareness about the disease. [May 2000]\n\nEducation: Professional Children's School N.Y. Coached by the great Ernie Martin\n\nDaughter of Lauralei Combs.\n\nHobbies include gardening and horseback riding.\n\nPets: 3 horses - Jake, Jezebel and Jesse. 4 fish - all un-named. 4 birds - only two of which are named, Lollie and Flower. 2 dogs - Travis and Lola. 2 Cats - Blue and Selena. 2 rabbits - Thumper and Jack. The cats and rabbits are the only pets that live indoors.\n\nWas engaged to Storm Lyndon but they split up late in 2000.\n\nIs on the board for Thursday's child, a charity for teenage runaways.\n\nWas a bridesmaid at the wedding of Alyssa Milano. [1999]\n\n#62 in FHM's 100 sexiest women countdown [2002]\n\n#78 in Stuff magazines 103 sexiest women countdown [2003]\n\nLiving with \"Charmed\" (1998) key grip David W. Donoho [2000-]\n\nSon, Finley Arthur Donoho, born 26 April 2004\n\nUpon Shannen Doherty's departure from \"Charmed\" (1998), Holly Marie Combs' character Piper became the oldest sister, despite being the youngest of all four actresses who have played Halliwell sisters in the series.\n\nThe scar in her eyebrow was caused by her walking into a marble table when she was learning to walk.\n\n\"I have no interest in a guy who doesn't know the right end of a screwdriver.\"\n\n[About having a child, shortly before getting pregnant] \"For some reason everybody on the set - except for me - thinks I should get pregnant for real. It's like they all got together and I've been nominated! Honestly, the thought of having a baby scares me!\"\n\n(About topless pictures of her on the internet.) \"I did one topless scene when I was 20. There was no thought in my mind that they could freeze that moment into 15 different pictures. The worst, I was thinking, was that stupid guy friends of mine could rewind it and play it again.\"\n\nI was the product of very young parents, and they had wild ways. My mother was in a punk band. Rebelling would have been learning to play piano.\n\n(On the miracle of motherhood.) Now, as an actress and a person, it has completely broadened my horizons because I have such a deep level of empathy for everyone. It opens you up and you're like a bleeding heart. It's funny, because you can be such a guarded person in your personal life and try to protect yourself from all these worries and hurts, but when you have a kid, you're suddenly this feeling being. When Finley gets his vaccinations, it kills me, and you can't protect yourself from that. My heart is being ripped out with every shot. It's a deeper level of emotion that I wasn't prepared to feel, but it's completely amazing. It has opened me up both as a person and as an actress. Everything has a deeper meaning now.\n\n(On her baby, Finley) Thank God, he's such a good traveler. He adapts so well. He can pretty much sleep anywhere. I was very, very worried about him having a normal kind of life and being comfortable and not carted around everywhere, but he's so good. We went on location in Las Vegas with my husband and we'd go out to the casino and he thinks there's just a lot of people in the living room. Like, wow, it's kind of loud and there's a lot of people here today.\n\n(On Alyssa & Rose's escapades with her baby, Finley) They take him in the makeup trailer and do bad things to his hair. The girls gave him a mohawk the other day. So I can't let him out of my sight for very long.\n\n(On motherhood) It's weird. When you become a mom you just learn how to function sleep deprived and you do get used to it. I came back to work when he was three months old and the first few months were rough. And then somehow you learn to exist on no sleep. And now when he does upon occasion sleep through the night, which is like a full six hours, you're pretty sure he's suffocating. So you don't sleep anyway.\n\n(On motherhood) It's changed just about everything about my life. It definitely puts everything in perspective. Things that were so important to you mean absolutely nothing and the status of his diaper means absolutely everything."
