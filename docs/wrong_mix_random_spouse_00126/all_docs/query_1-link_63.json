We left behind 16 small children and seven husbands to spend a week together celebrating our 20-plus-year friendship.

I begin this column on a somber note: Sadly, Echo Brown passed away on September 16 from kidney failure due to lupus. Originally from Cleveland, Ohio, Echo majored in government and was involved in the Rockefeller Center, serving as a Rockefeller leadership fellow. A natural storyteller, she wrote and performed in a successful and acclaimed one-woman show and published two young-adult novels. At the time of her death she was writing her third novel in collaboration with Tyler Perry. Her obituary was published in major media outlets, including The New York Times and The Washington Post. Amanda Prentice shared, “Echo was one of the bravest and most independent people those close to her ever met. She broke down barriers and overcame much adversity in her short life. We have no doubt that had she been granted a longer life, she would have continued to be a trailblazer in many ways.” If you would like to make a contribution to support Echo’s mother during this difficult time, you can reach out to Echo’s close friend, Cathy Mao, at cathyforecho@gmail.com, who has been helping the family with arrangements.\n\nJanna Johnson was recently promoted to associate professor and granted indefinite tenure at the University of Minnesota Humphrey School of Public Affairs.

Edwards School of Medicine in June. Later this year he plans to release a musical album, the first of several planned. Mats shares that his album is “Indie songwriter stuff inspired by the music I explored on my Dartmouth Partners in Community Service internship at Music Maker Relief Foundation in 2004, which sent me to McDowell County, West Virginia, and led me on the path to pursue a career in medicine.” You can follow him on social media (@psychflu).\n\nIn September Jessica (Saraceno) Carroll was honored as one of 40 attorneys under the age of 40 in New Jersey named a 2023 “New Leaders of the Bar” recipient by the New Jersey Law Journal.

She joins sister Parker and brother Hudson.\n\nIn October, Brad Heritage, Will Pierce, Alec Hufnagel, and Jamie Coffin played in a charity golf event to benefit Mike Rabil’s nonprofit, PLL Assists. “A tremendous day was had by all to help support and grow the game of lacrosse (and to assert former undergrad dominance),” Brad shared.\n\nPlease continue to share your news updates and have a great start to the new year!\n\n—Kate (Berry) Grace, c/o DAM, 7 Lebanon St., Suite 107, Hanover, NH 03755; dartmouth06classnotes@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’06s.\n\nCongratulations to Patty (Olszynski) Hanyen and her husband Greg.

She shares that, “Last November I hosted and produced the first ever Ivy League Summit for Women, where more than 250 Ivy League women gathered virtually to take off the veil of perfection and discuss the challenges we face as women. The global community, Ivy League Sisters, is now more than 750 women and they are gathering again this year on November 9.” To learn more and register for the free summit visit www.theivyleaguesummit.com.\n\nAlexis Lanzet recently moved to Toronto after living in Vancouver for 17 years.

In attendance were Brad Heritage, Jamie Coffin, Alec Hufnagel, Andrew Mayer, Dan Oberlin, Tom Pilla, Casey (Hazel) Nicholson with husband Matt ’05, Molly (Pierce) Daniels with husband Tom ’04, and Samantha (Lane) Gault with husband Mike ’03.\n\nSamantha (Lane) Gault also shares, “I feel fortunate that the kids and I have also recently hit the beach with Kate (Berry) Grace, the ski slopes with Kate (Hufft) Kelly and Matt Kelly, the Essex [Connecticut] steam train with Katie (Lang) Rotker, and the theater with Devika Bodas ’15, former Greenwich Academy student and recent New Canaan Country School colleague.”\n\nAfter working in fundraising for Dartmouth for the last 11 years, Alex Stein relocated from Hanover to Italy.

An accomplished athlete, Pete rowed crew at Dartmouth and was a walk-on to the team (he had never rowed before). After graduating from Dartmouth with a double major in government and English, Pete worked in consulting and earned an M.B.A. from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He then worked in financial services in New York City, Denver, and Sydney, Australia. Pete loved the outdoors, especially rowing, golf, and biking. If you would like to honor Pete, you may make a donation in his name to The Nature Conservancy or to a charity of your choice that helps the homeless in your community.\n\nI was in touch with several of Pete’s friends and teammates, including Robbie Carey, Nic Chu, Greg Bayard, Bob Blake, and Noah Riner, all of whom were able to attend Pete’s memorial service in February. Together, they shared the following memories of him: “We remember our typical Saturday mornings in Hanover—early morning practice on the river, followed by a trek up the hill from the boathouse for breakfast at Lou’s, and later pong in the Heorot basement. Outside of the weekend rhythm in Hanover, Pete was always making time for travel and adventure, which was perhaps best encapsulated by his move to Australia for two years to continue his work for Bank of America Merrill Lynch out of the Sydney office. In Hanover Pete always made time to serve the community, especially via COVER home repair. His commitment to service was steadfast and included a recent trip to Indianapolis to help facilitate a free health clinic, called Pathways to Health, that served more than 5,000 patients. Pete was consistently generous with his time and resources, was an exceptionally thoughtful friend and community member, and is deeply missed.”\n\nAli “Kat” Krzton has served on the faculty at Auburn University as the research data management librarian for the last five years. She has earned tenure this year and will be promoted to associate professor in the fall.

Emily lives in West Palm Beach, Florida, with her family and is the director of Acquavella Galleries in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nSebastian “Seb” Ruiz and his wife, Joanne Rispoli, recently moved from N.Y.C. to Weston, Massachusetts, and welcomed their first child, daughter Julia Michelle Ruiz.
