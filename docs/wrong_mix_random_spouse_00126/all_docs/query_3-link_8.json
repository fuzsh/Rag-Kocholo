        "text": "In modern high-throughput data analysis, researchers perform a large number of statistical tests, expecting to find perhaps a small fraction of significant effects against a predominantly null background. Higher Criticism (HC) was introduced to determine whether there are any nonzero effects; more recently, it was applied to feature selection, where it provides a method for selecting useful predictive features from a large body of potentially useful features, among which only a rare few will prove truly useful.\n\nIn this article, we review the basics of HC in both the testing and feature selection settings. HC is a flexible idea, which adapts easily to new situations; we point out simple adaptions to clique detection and bivariate outlier detection. HC, although still early in its development, is seeing increasing interest from practitioners; we illustrate this with worked examples. HC is computationally effective, which gives it a nice leverage in the increasingly more relevant “Big Data” settings we see today."
