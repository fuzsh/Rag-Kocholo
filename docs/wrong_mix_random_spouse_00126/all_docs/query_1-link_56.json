They can exist in any anatomical site and are responsible for neuropathic pain. Post-traumatic neuromas of the clitoris have been described as an uncommon consequence of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C). FGM/C involves partial or total removal of the female genital organs for non-therapeutic reasons. It can involve cutting of the clitoris and can cause psychological, sexual, and physical complications. We aimed to evaluate the symptoms and management of women presenting with a clitoral neuroma after female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C). We identified women who attended our specialized clinic for women with FGM/C who were diagnosed with a traumatic neuroma of the clitoris between April 1, 2010 and June 30, 2016. We reviewed their medical files and collected socio-demographic, clinical, surgical, and histopathological information. Seven women were diagnosed with clitoral neuroma. Six attended our clinic to undergo clitoral reconstruction, and three of these suffered from clitoral pain. The peri-clitoral fibrosis was removed during clitoral reconstruction, which revealed neuroma of the clitoris in all six subjects. Pain was ameliorated after surgery. The seventh woman presented with a visible and palpable painful clitoral mass diagnosed as a neuroma. Excision of the mass ameliorated the pain. Sexual function improved in five women. One was not sexually active, and one had not yet resumed sex. Post-traumatic clitoral neuroma can be a consequence of FGM/C. It can cause clitoral pain or be asymptomatic. In the case of pain symptoms, effective treatment is neuroma surgical excision, which can be performed during clitoral reconstruction. Surgery should be considered as part of multidisciplinary care. The efficacy of neuroma excision alone or during clitoral reconstruction to treat clitoral pain should be further assessed among symptomatic\n\n[Treatment of painful neuromas via end-to-side neurorraphy].\n\nPubMed\n\nAszmann, O C; Moser, V; Frey, M\n\n2010-08-01\n\nManagement of the painful neuroma has been subject to controversy since the earliest descriptions of this disabling problem. Today, treatment is limited to resection of the neuroma and implantation of the nerve in a muscle at a location where it is safe from irritation and trauma. This however is not attainable in many cases and it is our clinical experience, that nerves without a target remain a source of constant discomfort and pain. Recently we reported of the feasibility of neuroma prevention through end-to-side neurorraphy into adjacent sensory and/or motor nerves to provide a target for axons deprived of their endorgan. Here we report of our first clinical experience with this method in sixteen patients with longstanding upper and lower extremity neuromas. 16 patients were included in this study. All had neuromas of different sensory nerves of both the upper and lower extremity. 11 were of iatrogenic origin, 5 were caused by different traumas. 8 had previous attempts to surgically treat the neuroma. Finally, all were treated by end-to-side neurorraphy into adjacent nerves. Postoperatively quantitative sensorymotor testing was performed to evaluate possible changes of nerve function of the recipient nerves. Pain was evaluated by visual analogue score and changes in pain medication. In no patient a sensory or motor deficit or painful sensations were induced in the target area of the recipient nerve. Some had dysaesthesias for about 6 months, which finally subsided. All but 1 patient improved in their symptoms at a follow-up of more than 2 years. Previous experimental work and present clinical results suggest that axons of a severed peripheral nerve that are provided with a pathway and target through an end-to-side coaptation will either be pruned or establish some type of end-organ contact so that a neuroma can be prevented without inducing sensory or motor dysfunctions in the recipient nerve.

The most common symptoms include orofacial pain, facial paralysis, trigeminal neuralgia, tinnitus, hearing loss, and imbalance that result from compression of cranial nerves VâIX. Symptoms of acoustic neuromas can mimic and present as temporomandibular disorder. Therefore, a thorough medical and dental history, radiographic evaluation, and properly conducted diagnostic testing are essential in differentiating odontogenic pain from pain that is nonodontogenic in nature. This article reports a rare case of a young pregnant female patient diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma located in the cerebellopontine angle that was originally treated for musculoskeletal temporomandibular joint disorder.

A 67-year female patient, who was diagnosed as sarcoidosis previously, was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of dyspnea, chest pain and fatigue. Middle lobe atelectasis and endobronchial lesion were observed in thorax computed tomography (CT). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed polypoid lesions and histopathological examination of biopsy material showed clustered nerve bundles consistent with mucosal neuroma and non-necrotising granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis. Mucosal neuromas are pathognomonic features of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2B. But other components of MEN type 2B such as medullary tyroid carcinoma or pheochromocytoma were not detected in our patient. Hence, a diagnosis of solitary mucosal neuroma and sarcoidosis in the bronchi was made.\n\nUltrasound-guided Interdigital Neuroma Injections: Short-term Clinical Outcomes after a Single Percutaneous InjectionâPreliminary Results\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAdler, Ronald S.; Ciavarra, Gina A.; Pavlov, Helene\n\n2006-01-01\n\nPurpose To describe the procedure of ultrasound-guided Mortonâs neuroma and recurrent stump neuroma injections and early clinical outcomes after a single injection. Materials and Methods Retrospective review of 44 percutaneous ultrasound-guided neuroma injections in 24 patients who had completed clinical outcomes questionnaires. A 10-point pain scale [scale of 1 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain)] in a 7-day pain log format was distributed to patients at the time percutaneous neuroma injection was performed. Results Neuromas were clearly visualized with sonography as hypoechoic nodules and were distinguishable from other causes of forefoot pain, such as metatarsophalangeal joint synovitis and intermetatarsal bursae. The sizes of the neuromas injected ranged between 4 and 19Â mm. Postinjection, all neuromas displayed increased echogenicity and/or the appearance of fluid surrounding it, confirming localization of the therapeutic mixture. We arbitrarily subdivided the pain ratings into symptomatic (greater than 4) and asymptomatic (less than or equal to 4) for statistical analysis. Average pain level pre injection was 5.2 and average pain level was 3.7 at 7Â days post single injection, with 62% of the initially symptomatic patients asymptomatic on day 7 (pâ<â0.000001). Overall, 76% of the total number of neuromas injected once were asymptomatic on day 7. Conclusion Ultrasound can be used to accurately target Mortonâs neuromas and, therefore, appropriately direct therapeutic interventions, with good short-term clinical results.

We describe a patient with a large cystic tumor with associated trigeminal, facial, audiovestibular, and brainstem dysfunction, which was suspicious for acoustic neuroma on preoperative neuroimaging. Intraoperative investigation revealed a facial nerve neuroma located in the cerebellopontine angle and internal acoustic canal. Gross total resection of the tumor via retrosigmoid craniotomy was curative. Transection of the facial nerve necessitated facial reanimation 4 months later via hypoglossal-facial cross-anastomosis. Clinicians should recognize the natural history, diagnostic approach, and management of this unusual and mimetic lesion. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

They act as scaffolds to guide nerves to distal targets and play a key role in neurite outgrowth. Because there is evidence that laminin architecture affects nerve regeneration, we evaluated endoneurial tubules by examining the laminin structure in clinical samples from patients with nerve injuries. In a retrospective review of eight nerve injury cases, we evaluated nerve histology in relation to clinical history and injury type. The immunohistochemical delineation of the laminin structure in relationship with the neuroma type was performed. Five cases of upper-trunk stretch injuries-four from childbirth injury and one from aÂ motorcycle accident-and three cases of nerve laceration leading to neuroma formation were examined. In the upper-trunk stretch injuries, avulsed nerves demonstrated no neuroma formation with a linear laminin architecture and a regular Schwann cell arrangement, but increased fibrous tissue deposition. For neuromas-in-continuity after a stretch injury, laminin immunohistochemistry demonstrated a double-lumen laminin tubule, with encapsulation of the Schwann cells and axonal processes. Nerve laceration leading to stump neuroma formation had a similar double-lumen laminin tubule, but less severe fibrosis. In nerve injuries with regenerative capacity, endoneurial tubules become pathologically disorganized. A double-lumen endoneurial tubule of unclear significance develops. The consistency of this pattern potentially suggests a reproducible pathophysiologic process. Further exploration of this pathophysiologic healing may provide insight into theÂ failure of programmed peripheral nerve regeneration after injury.\n\nPathologic Remodeling of Endoneurial Tubules in Human Neuromas\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKarsy, Michael; Palmer, Cheryl A\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground: Laminins are extracellular matrix proteins that participate in endoneurial tubule formation and are important in the regeneration of nerves after injury.

Outcomes of conservative therapy are mixed and many patients undergo operative intervention. Radiofrequency ablation has recently gained favor as a treatment option, although the optimal regime is unknown. This study investigates the effectiveness of 2 versus 3 cycles of radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of Morton's neuroma. We surveyed a cohort of patients with Morton's neuroma who had progressed to radiofrequency ablation after failed conservative treatment. Patients received either 2 or 3 cycles of radiofrequency ablation by a single surgeon. We assessed patients based on their change in numerical pain rating scale, symptom improvement, complications, and progression to surgical excision through a series of telephone interviews. Outcomes between the 2 treatment arms were compared by parametric tests. Twenty-eight patients were included in the study. Eighteen patients with 21 neuromas received 2 cycles and 10 patients with 11 neuromas received 3 cycles. Mean time of follow-up was 12.9 months. Overall, 88% of patients were either very or moderately satisfied with their outcome. In patients who received 2 cycles mean numerical pain scores decreased from 7.9 Â± 1.1 to 3.4 Â± 2.4 postprocedure. Three patients progressed to operative excision. In patients who received 3 cycles, numerical pain scores decreased from 8.0 Â± 1.0 to 1.5 Â± 2.0 postprocedure. One patient progressed to operative excision. Patients who received 3 cycles had reduced medium-term pain postoperatively compared with 2 cycles (3.4 Â± 2.4 vs 1.5 Â± 2.0, P = .011). Radiofrequency ablation provides a high rate of patient satisfaction in the treatment of Morton's neuroma with few side effects. It appears that 3 cycles may be superior to 2 cycles but a randomized controlled trial will be required to confirm these results.

In addition, most of the studies related to it are case-control or retrospective case series. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness between corticosteroid injection associated with local anesthetic and local anesthetic alone (placebo control group) for the treatment of Morton's neuroma. Forty-one patients with a diagnosis of Morton's neuroma were randomized to receive 3 injections of either a corticosteroid plus a local anesthetic or a local anesthetic alone. The patients and the researcher who collected data were blinded to the treatment groups. The visual analog scale for pain and the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Score (metatarsophalangeal/interphalangeal score) were obtained at baseline, after each injection, and at 3 and 6 months after the last injection. There were no significant between-group differences in terms of pain and function improvement at 3 and 6 months after treatment completion in comparison with baseline values. At the end of the study, 17 (48.5%) patients requested surgical excision of the neuroma: 7 (44%) in the experimental group and 10 (53%) in the control group ( P = 1.0). The injection of a corticosteroid plus a local anesthetic was not superior to a local anesthetic alone in terms of pain and function improvement in patients with Morton's neuroma.

To report on a case of traumatic neuroma in the penis after selective dorsal neurotomy (SDN) to treat premature ejaculation. The penile traumatic neuroma was successfully removed by excision and confirmed by histopathology. A 55-year-old man who had had several painless, slow-growing nodules on his penis for 2 years presented to our hospital. He had no history of genital trauma, urinary tract infection, or penile surgery, except SDN to treat premature ejaculation. The nodules were excised and the final diagnosis was traumatic neuroma. No recurrence has been detected during 1 year of follow-up. The main complications of SDN are recurrence of premature ejaculation, pain or paresthesia on the glans penis, and erectile dysfunction. However, no traumatic neuroma has been reported as a complication. We report that a traumatic neuroma can occur after SDN. Copyright Â© 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, recently, some investigators have observed a progressive deterioration in pain scores for patients initially pain free after the treatment. The purpose of the present retrospective comparative study was to determine whether mechanical metatarsalgia is related to symptom recurrence. We included 104 consecutive cases of ultrasound-guided alcohol injection for Morton's neuroma in 92 patients. Of these 104 cases, 51 were in group A (49%; Morton's neuroma) and 53 in group B (51%; Morton's neuroma associated with mechanical metatarsalgia). We evaluated each patient using a visual analog scale and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society forefoot scale, and Johnson satisfaction scale, with a mean follow-up period of 24 (range 12 to 39) months. Concomitant functional and mechanical disorders have been identified and treated with orthopedic inserts. The present study compared the clinical results and recurrence of symptoms in patients with isolated Morton's disease or Morton's disease associated with mechanical metatarsalgia. Of the 104 cases, the patients for 93 cases (89%) were completely satisfied or satisfied with minor reservations. No major complications developed. Symptoms recurred in 6 patients (6%), in whom neuroma was associated with mechanical disorders (p = .0269). Ultrasound-guided alcohol injection of Morton's neuroma is a relatively safe and well-tolerated treatment. Symptom recurrence is often associated with mechanical metatarsalgia. The treatment of the concomitant anatomical and functional disorders that target the genesis of the neuroma has an important role in the prevention of recurrence of this pathology.

Clinical treatment of painful neuroma is unclear. Numerous treatment modalities have been introduced by experts in this field. However, there is still no single standard recognized treatment. Different forms of treatments have been tested in animals and humans, but pharmacotherapies (antidepressants, antiepileptics) remain the basis of traumatic neuropathic pain management. For intractable cases, nerve stump transpositions into a muscle, vein or bone are seen as traditional surgical procedures which provide a certain degree of efficacy. Novel surgical techniques have emerged in recent years, such as tube guided nerve capping, electrical stimulation and adipose autograft have substantially enriched the abundance of the treatment for traumatic neuropathic pain. Several treatments show advantages over the others in terms of pain relief and prevention of neuroma formation, making it difficult to pick out a single modality as the reference. An effective and standardized treatment for traumatic neuropathic pain would provide better choice for researchers and clinical workers. In this review, we summarized current knowledge on the treatment of traumatic neuropathic pain, and found a therapeutic strategy for this intractable pain. We tried to provide a useful guideline for choosing the right modality in management of traumatic neuropathic pain.

The anatomy of the radial nerve renders it prone to pressure paralysis as often called \"Saturday night palsy\". This problem is a transient nerve lesion and an acute one but the case presented here is very unusual in that it seems this entity can also occur as an acute on chronic situation with neuroma formation. A 61 year-old man presented with the chief complaint of inability to extend the wrist and the fingers of the left hand which began suddenly the night before admission, following a three-week history of pain, numbness and tingling sensation of the affected extremity. He had no history of trauma to the extremity. Electromyography revealed a severe conductive defect of the left radial nerve with significant axonal loss at the upper arm. Surgical exploration identified a neuroma of the radial nerve measuring 1.5 cm in length as the cause of the paralysis. The neuroma was removed and an end-to-end nerve coaption was performed. Complete recovery of the hand and finger extension was achieved in nine months.\n\n[Treatment of giant acoustic neuromas].\n\nPubMed\n\nSamprÃ³n, NicolÃ¡s; Altuna, Xabier; ArmendÃ¡riz, Mikel; Urculo, Enrique\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo analyze the treatment modality and outcome of a series of patients with giant acoustic neuromas, a particular type of tumour characterised by their size (extracanalicular diameter of 4cm or more) and high morbidity and mortality. This was a retrospective unicentre study of patients with acoustic neuromas treated in a period of 12 years. In our institutional series of 108 acoustic neuromas operated on during that period, we found 13 (12%) cases of giant acoustic neuromas. We reviewed the available data of these cases, including presentation and several clinical, anatomical, and microsurgical aspects. All patients were operated on by the same neurosurgeon and senior author (EU) using the suboccipital retrosigmoid approach and complete microsurgical removal was achieved in 10 cases. In one case, near total removal was deliberately performed, in another case a CSF shunt was placed as the sole treatment measure, and in the remaining case no direct treatment was given. One patient died in the immediate postoperative period. One year after surgery, 4 patients showed facial nerve function of iii or more in the House-Brackman scale. The 4 most important prognostic characteristics of giant acoustic neuromas are size, adhesion to surrounding structures, consistency and vascularity. Only the first of these is evident in neuroimaging. Giant acoustic neuromas are characterised by high morbidity at presentation as well as after treatment. Nevertheless, the objective of complete microsurgical removal with preservation of cranial nerve function is attainable in some cases through the suboccipital retrosigmoid approach.

Overuse of opiates may actually aggravate the pain, necessitating detoxification. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is helpful for conditions in which pain is localized, especially if there is a âtrigger areaâ or neuroma, or if paresthesias can be stimulated within the painful area. Local anesthetic injection, possibly with corticosteroid, relieves painful scars and neuromas, neuritis, and tender trigger points. Sympathetic blocks are used for post-herpetic neuralgia and sympathetic dystrophies. Relaxation therapy is a very useful psychological treatment.

To our knowledge, this is the first and only described case of traumatic neuromas arising as a late complication of otoplasty in the English literature. Traumatic neuroma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any nodular lesions that develop within the external ear in patients who have had otoplasty or any other form of external ear surgery or trauma.\n\nManual therapy in the management of a patient with a symptomatic Morton's Neuroma: A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nSault, Josiah D; Morris, Matthew V; Jayaseelan, Dhinu J; Emerson-Kavchak, Alicia J\n\n2016-02-01\n\nPatients with Morton's neuroma are rarely referred to physical therapy.

Few previous reports have discussed the role of occipital nerve injury in the pathogenesis of the postoperative headache noted to commonly occur following the retrosigmoid approach to acoustic neuroma resection. No studies have supported a direct etiologic link between the two. The authors report on a series of acoustic neuroma patients with postoperative headache presenting as occipital neuralgia who were found to have occipital nerve injuries and were treated for chronic headache by excision of the injured nerves. Records were reviewed to identify patients who had undergone surgical excision of the greater and lesser occipital nerves for refractory chronic postoperative headache following acoustic neuroma resection. Primary outcomes examined were change in migraine headache index, change in number of pain medications used, continued use of narcotics, patient satisfaction, and change in quality of life. Follow-up was in clinic and via telephone interview. Seven patients underwent excision of the greater and lesser occipital nerves. All met diagnostic criteria for occipital neuralgia and failed conservative management. Six of 7 patients experienced pain reduction of greater than 80% on the migraine index. Average pain medication use decreased from 6 to 2 per patient; 3 of 5 patients achieved independence from narcotics. Six patients experienced 80% or greater improvement in quality of life at an average follow-up of 32 months. There was one treatment failure. Occipital nerve neuroma or nerve entrapment was identified during surgery in all cases where treatment was successful but not in the treatment failure. In contradistinction to previous reports, we have identified a subset of patients in whom the syndrome of\n\nComputed tomography analysis of third webspace injections for interdigital neuroma.\n\nPubMed\n\nHembree, W Chad; Groth, Adam T; Schon, Lew C; Guyton, Gregory P\n\n2013-04-01\n\nInjection for interdigital neuroma (IDN) may not selectively target the common digital nerve. We investigated the anatomical localization and extent of extravasation with injection for IDN. Two fellowship-trained foot and ankle surgeons injected radiopaque contrast into the third webspace of 49 cadaveric specimens (29 with 2 mL and 20 with 1 mL). Computed tomography scan of each specimen was obtained. An independent blinded foot and ankle surgeon analyzed the scans. All injections were accurate. Contrast was found in the second (greater than 70%) and fourth (greater than 30%) webspaces in both injection volume groups. No contrast was found within the third metatarsophalangeal joint. Extravasation extent was significantly greater with 2 mL versus 1 mL of solution in the medial to lateral (27.9 [7.8] mm vs 23.7 [6.0] mm; P = .05) and distal to proximal (52.1 [13.7] mm vs 40.4 [16.1] mm; P = .01) planes. No differences were observed in extravasation extent between surgeons. Injection for IDN was accurate, and extravasation extended into adjacent webspaces in a large percentage of specimens with both solution volumes. Lower extent of extravasation with 1 mL of solution did not indicate better selectivity of injection. Steroid injections for interdigital neuroma were accurate for therapeutic purposes but not diagnostic, except potentially for distinguishing webspace pain from joint pain.\n\nUltrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of Morton's neuroma.\n\nPubMed\n\nFazal, Muhammad Ali; Khan, Ishrat; Thomas, Cherian\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography are used widely for the diagnosis of Morton's neuroma. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of these two modalities as diagnostic tools in Morton's neuroma. Fifty feet of 47 consecutive patients (39 women and 8 men; mean age, 46 years; age range, 36-64 years) who presented between January 1, 2005, and June 30, 2008, were included in the study. Twenty-five feet were investigated with ultrasonography and 25 with MRI. Morton's neuroma was confirmed surgically and histologically in all of the patients. A Student unpaired t test was applied. Twenty-two MRIs were diagnostic (sensitivity, 88%). Three patients with negative MRI findings underwent ultrasonography and were found to have a neuroma smaller than 5 mm. Twenty-four ultrasound scans demonstrated the neuroma (sensitivity, 96%), with five neuromas being smaller than 5 mm. Ultrasonography has a slightly higher sensitivity in the diagnosis of Morton's neuroma, particularly of neuromas smaller than 5 mm, and should be the preferred imaging modality in suspected cases, and MRI should be reserved for cases with equivocal diagnosis.\n\nDiagnostic Value of Elastography in the Diagnosis of Intermetatarsal Neuroma.\n\nPubMed\n\nOrmeci, Tugrul; GÃ¼ler, Olcay; Malkoc, Melih; Keskinbora, Mert; GÃ¼ngÃ¶ren, Fatma Zeynep; MahirogullarÄ±, Mahir\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe objective of the present study was to characterize the ultrasound and elastographic properties of intermetatarsal neuroma (interdigital neuroma) and their contribution to diagnosis. Eighteen patients with metatarsalgia, who had presented to an orthopedic clinic from April 2013 to February 2015, were diagnosed with 25 intermetatarsal neuromas (11 unilateral [61.11%], 7 bilateral [38.89%]). These patients underwent evaluation with ultrasonography and simultaneous ultrasound strain elastography to assess the elastographic properties of the tissues in the intermetatarsal space. The intermetatarsal neuroma diagnosis was confirmed by histopathologic inspection. The lesion contours, localization, dimensions, and vascularization were evaluated before surgical excision. The elasticity and strain ratio values were compared between the neuroma and adjacent healthy intermetatarsal space. Of the 25 intermetatarsal neuromas, 1 (4%) was not detected by ultrasonography (incidence of detection ofÂ 96%). The mean neuroma width was 6.35 (range 3.7 to 13) mm in the coronal plane, and the mean elasticity and strain ratio values were 3.44 (range 1.1 to 5.1) and 9.47 (range 2.3 to 19.3), respectively. The elasticity and strain ratio values were significantly greater in the presence of an interdigital neuroma than in the adjacent healthy intermetatarsal spaces (ZÂ =Â -3.964, pÂ =Â .0001 and ZÂ =Â -3.927, pÂ =Â .0001, respectively). The diagnostic cutoff values were calculated as 2.52 for elasticity and 6.1 for the strain ratio. Four neuromas (16%) were not demarcated, and the elasticity and strain ratio values for these were lower than those for neuromas with demarcated contours but were greater than those for healthy intermetatarsal spaces (pÂ <Â .006 and pÂ <Â .005, respectively). Patients with clinically suspected intermetatarsal neuromas that do not show demarcation and with smaller lesions might benefit from the use of ultrasound elastography for diagnosis.

These neuromas are often resistant to therapy, and excision of the neuroma frequently leads to recurrence. In this study, the authors present a novel surgical strategy to prevent neuroma formation based on the principle of centro-central anastomosis (CCA), but rather than directly connecting the nerve ends to an autograft, they created a loop using a 3D-printed polyethylene Y-shaped conduit with an autograft in the distal outlets. METHODS The 3D-printed Y-tube with autograft was investigated in a model of rat sciatic nerve transection in which the Y-tube was placed on the proximal sciatic nerve stump and a peroneal graft was placed between the distal outlets of the Y-tube to form a closed loop. This model was compared with a CCA model, in which a loop was created between the proximal tibial and peroneal nerves with a peroneal autograft. Additional control groups consisted of the closed Y-tube and the extended-arm Y-tube. Results were analyzed at 12 weeks of survival using nerve morphometry for the occurrence of neuroma formation and axonal regeneration in plastic semi-thin sections. RESULTS Among the different surgical groups, the Y-tube with interposed autograft was the only model that did not result in neuroma formation at 12 weeks of survival. In addition, a 13% reduction in the number of myelinated axons regenerating through the interposed autograft was observed in the Y-tube with autograft model. In the CCA model, the authors also observed a decrease of 17% in the number of myelinated axons, but neuroma formation was present in this model. The closed Y-tube resulted in minimal nerve regeneration inside the tube together with extensive neuroma formation before the entrance of the tube. The extended-arm Y-tube model clearly showed that the majority of the regenerating axons merged into the Y-tube arm, which was connected to the autograft\n\nNeuroma prevention by end-to-side neurorraphy: an experimental study in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nAszmann, Oskar C; Korak, Klaus J; Rab, Matthias; GrÃ¼nbeck, Matthias; Lassmann, Hans; Frey, Manfred\n\n2003-11-01\n\nThe successful treatment of painful neuromas remains a difficult goal to attain. In this report we explore the feasibility of neuroma prevention by insertion of the proximal end of a nerve through an end-to-side neurorraphy into an adjacent mixed nerve to provide a pathway and target for axons deprived of their end organ. Experiments were performed on a total of twenty 250-g Sprague-Dawley rats. Two groups of 10 animals were prepared. Group A served as an anatomic control. In group B the right saphenous nerve was transected and implanted end-to-side through an epineurial window into the tibial nerve distal to the trifurcation of the sciatic nerve. After 12 weeks the corresponding sensory neurons were identified by retrograde labeling techniques and histomorphometric analysis of the proximal and distal tibial nerve segments, and regular histology of the end-to-side site were performed. The results of the retrograde labeling of the corresponding sensory neuron pool of the saphenus nerve showed extensive labelling of the L1 to L3 spinal ganglions after intracutaneous tracer application of the planta pedis. The morphology of the end-to-side coaptation site and histomorphologic analysis prove that sensory neurons penetrate the perineurial sheath and axons regenerate along the tibial Schwann cell tubes toward their targets. Axons of a severed peripheral nerve that are provided with a pathway and target through an end-to-side coaptation will either be pruned or establish some type of end-organ contact so that a neuroma can be prevented. Whether these axons will lead to disturbing sensations such as paresthesia or dysesthesia in the newly found environment or remain silent codwellers, this experiment cannot answer. Long-term results of future clinical work will have to decide whether the prevention of the neuroma through end-to-side coaptation will be an appropriate therapy for this difficult problem.\n\nAcoustic neuromas in the elderly.\n\nPubMed\n\nPerry, B P; Gantz, B J; Rubinstein, J T\n\n2001-05-01\n\nTo determine if an \"observation\" protocol with serial scanning is a safe and effective management paradigm for acoustic neuromas in the elderly. A retrospective case review was performed. This study was performed in an academic, tertiary care center. Forty-one patients over the age of 65 years were identified with the primary diagnosis of unilateral acoustic neuroma, without prior treatment or observation. The patients were followed with serial, gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans performed at 6 months and then yearly, if no significant growth occurred. The patients were monitored for tumor growth, cranial nerve deficits, and hydrocephalus. The patients were followed for an average of 3.5 years (range, 6 months to 9 years). The average tumor size at presentation was 1.14 cm, with a range of growth rates from 0 to 1.2 cm per year. Twenty-one patients demonstrated tumor growth at an average rate of 0.322 cm per year. Only five patients (12%) required further intervention. Three patients underwent translabyrinthine excision, and two patients were treated with radiation. No patients developed significant complications during the observation period. Acoustic neuromas in the older population can be managed safely using serial MRI scanning. No correlation could be made between initial tumor size and subsequent growth rate.\n\nThe Top 50 Most-Cited Articles on Acoustic Neuroma.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlfaifi, Abrar; AlMutairi, Othman; Allhaidan, Maha; Alsaleh, Saad; Ajlan, Abdulrazag\n\n2018-03-01\n\nAcoustic neuroma is the most common extra-axial primary cerebellopontine angle tumor in adults. A plethora of studies have been published on acoustic neuroma, but none of the previous works have highlighted the most influential articles. Our objective was to perform a bibliometric analysis of the 50 most-cited articles on acoustic neuroma. We performed a title-specific search on the Scopus database using the following search terms: \"acoustic neuroma,\" \"vestibular schwannoma,\" and \"cerebellopontine angle.\" We recorded the 50 most-cited articles and reviewed them. The 50 most-cited articles had an average of 175 citations per article. All articles were published between 1980 and 2006, with 1997 the most prolific year, when 7 articles were published. The journals Neurosurgery and Laryngoscope published 10 and 8 of these articles, respectively. The most common study categories were nonsurgical management (17/50) and surgical management (13/50). Studies were predominantly published by otolaryngologists (22/50) and neurosurgeons (14/50). Douglas Kondziolka was the author with the highest number of contributions, with 7 publications. The majority of the articles were produced in the United States (64%). Identifying articles on acoustic neuroma with the most impact provides an important overview of the historical development of treatment methods and publication trends related to this condition. A finalized, comprehensive list of the most important works represents an excellent tool that can serve as a guide for evidence-based clinical practice. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The sex incidence was equal and the mean age at diagnosis was 26.2 years. The family history was positive in nine of the patients. Five patients have had incomplete surgical removal of acoustic neuromas on both sides. Two of them are completely deaf and the other three have severe sensorineural hearing loss in one ear and no hearing in the other ear. In five patients the tumour on one side has been operated on and the other side is being observed with at least short-term preservation of good hearing. The remaining two patients died of intra-cranial complications, one of them post-operatively. Four patients developed facial palsy immediately following surgery and one developed facial weakness 6 months after surgery. Guidelines are discussed for the care of these patients including the timing of surgery and alternative treatment options (observation, radio-surgery and chemotherapy). This is essentially a group of young individuals who have had multiple operations for bilateral acoustic tumours and associated manifestations and for whom the disease and the sequelae of treatment can be tragic.\n\nVestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) in patients with acoustic neuromas.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakeichi, N; Sakamoto, T; Fukuda, S; Inuyama, Y\n\n2001-05-01\n\nTo study the utility of VEMP (vestibular-evoked myogenic potential) in the diagnosis of acoustic neuromas. Eighteen patients with unilateral acoustic neuromas were subjected to this study. Myogenic potential responding to loud click stimuli was recorded at ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle. A normal range of VEMP was obtained from 20 controls. VEMP responses were compared with both, clinical symptoms and results of caloric tests. Thirteen out of 18 patients showed decreased responses of VEMP at the affected side. VEMP responses seemed to have little relation with dysequilibrium, spontaneous nystagmus, canal paresis and pure-tone hearing. VEMP is useful for detecting dysfunction of inferior vestibular nerve in patients with acoustic neuromas.\n\nBiliary stricture due to neuroma after an innocent blunt abdominal trauma.\n\nPubMed\n\nKatsinelos, P; Dimiropoulos, S; Galanis, I; Tsolkas, P; Paroutoglu, G; Arvaniti, M; Katsiba, D; Baltaglannis, S; Pilpilidis, I; Papagiannis, A; Vaslliadis, I\n\n2002-10-01\n\nA traumatic neuroma of the biliary tract is rarely associated with biliary obstruction. However, when it arises in the common bile duct (CBD) and is associated with obstructive jaundice, it is difficult to distinguish it from bile duct cancer. We describe a patient who developed obstructive jaundice and itching, due to CBD stricture, 8 years after innocent blunt abdominal trauma. The stricture was resected and hepatico-jejunal anastomosis was performed. Histological examination revealed a traumatic neuroma and a fibrous scar around the common bile duct. Symptoms disappeared following surgical removal of the lesion. Blunt abdominal injury may cause the late onset of a fibrous scar and traumatic neuroma in the common bile duct. To our knowledge, a traumatic neuroma of the biliary tract after blunt abdominal trauma has not been reported previously. We review the clinical picture of this relatively rare problem, along with its diagnosis, pathogenesis and treatment.\n\nFour cases of acoustic neuromas with normal hearing.\n\nPubMed\n\nValente, M; Peterein, J; Goebel, J; Neely, J G\n\n1995-05-01\n\nIn 95 percent of the cases, patients with acoustic neuromas will have some magnitude of hearing loss in the affected ear. This paper reports on four patients who had acoustic neuromas and normal hearing. Results from the case history, audiometric evaluation, auditory brainstem response (ABR), electroneurography (ENOG), and vestibular evaluation are reported for each patient. For all patients, the presence of unilateral tinnitus was the most common complaint. Audiologically, elevated or absent acoustic reflex thresholds and abnormal ABR findings were the most powerful diagnostic tools.\n\nPercutaneous alcohol injection under sonographic guidance in Morton's neuroma: follow-up in 220 treated lesions.\n\nPubMed\n\nPerini, Luciano; Perini, Claudia; Tagliapietra, Matteo; Varotto, Davide; Valcarenghi, Andrea; Postorino, Andrea; Volpe, Antonio\n\n2016-07-01\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous treatment of Civinini-Morton's syndrome due to solitary Morton's neuroma and analyze the effect of clinico-demographic factors on outcome. Alcohol injection was performed under sonographic guidance in 220 consecutive patients. Pain intensity using a numerical rating scale (NRS), pain features, limitation of everyday activities and comorbidity with other forefoot conditions were evaluated at presentation. Patients were reassessed for symptoms and the need of rescue therapy with neurectomy after a mean follow-up of 19.0Â months (range 15-24). We treated 220 patients (33 males, mean age 55.8Â years). Neuromas were located in the III intermetatarsal space in 85.5Â %, with a mean size of 5.4Â mm. When considering a reduction of pain intensity ofÂ â¥50Â % of NRS or a complete disappearance of the neuropathic features as a satisfactory clinical response, a 72.3Â % (pÂ <Â 0.001) responder rate was obtained, and only three patients relapsed (1.2Â %). An improvement in limitation of everyday activities was observed in 88.6Â % (pÂ <Â 0.001). No influence of clinico-demographic variables on outcome was found. No major complications occurred. Patients with unsatisfactory response had an overload-related comorbid condition in 20/61 (32.8Â %). Surgery was later performed in 14 non-responder patients. Ultrasound-guided alcoholization demonstrated a safe profile, relieved neuropathic symptoms in a majority of patients and improved their quality of life. Rescue therapy with surgery is feasible in patients with unsatisfactory response. However, a thorough evaluation for forefoot comorbidities should be obtained, as they may act as confounding factors.\n\nHydroxyapatite cement cranioplasty in translabyrinthine acoustic neuroma surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nArriaga, MoisÃªs A; Chen, Douglas A\n\n2002-05-01\n\nHydroxyapatite cement cranioplasty (HAC) after translabyrinthine resection of acoustic neuroma is a promising new technique for wound reconstruction. This study reviews the efficacy of HAC for the prevention of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and the long-term wound outcomes of HAC versus abdominal fat graft (AFG) reconstruction. This retrospective study of l08 consecutive acoustic neuromas operated on by Pittsburgh Ear Associates uses chart review, telephone interview, and mail questionnaire data. Fifty-four patients received AFG dural repair, and 54 patients received HAC. Seven AFG patients (12.5%) had CSF leaks versus 2 (3.7%) of the overall group of 54 HAC patients. However, none (0%) of the 47 HAC patients had CSF leakage with current HAC techniques. HAC also produced significantly less postauricular wound depression and superior cosmetic results in comparison with AFG. Although HAC patients experienced less postoperative discomfort, wound complications requiring medical or surgical intervention were extremely uncommon in both groups. HAC offers significant CSF leakage control and long-term cosmetic and comfort advantages over AFG alone. We recommend HAC as the standard closure technique for translabyrinthine acoustic neuroma surgery.\n\nVestibular Schwannoma (Acoustic Neuroma) and Neurofibromatosis\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... other brain tumors.

One potential cause of this dissatisfaction is residual pain secondary to neuroma formation in the sensory nerve branches that innervate the knee. We found, after performing a retrospective review, that up to 9.7% of patients following primary TKA and up to 21% of revision cases exhibited persistent knee pain attributable to neuroma formation. Despite the high incidence of this pathology, little is known about the effective diagnosis or treatment of neuroma formation following TKA. Between 2011 and 2014, 50 patients with persistent symptomatic neuroma pain following TKA underwent selective denervation. These patients had demonstrated the appropriate selection criteria and had failed conservative management. Patients were evaluated by the visual analog scale pain score and the Knee Society Score to determine the outcome of the described treatment. Thirty-two patients (64%) rated their outcome as excellent, 10 (20%) as good, 3 (6%) as fair, and 2 (4%) reported no change. The mean visual analog scale pain score was improved from 9.4 Â± 0.8 to 1.1 Â± 1.6 following surgery (P â¤ .001). The mean Knee Society Scores increased from 45.5 Â± 14.3 to 94.1 Â± 8.6 points (P â¤ .0001). Three patients (6%) required the second neurectomy due to recurrent pain and received excellent pain relief postoperatively. There were 2 complications of superficial skin peri-incisional hyperemia related to dressings. Average follow-up duration was 24 months (range, 16-38 months). Our study suggests that selective denervation provides an effective and long-lasting option for the management of this pathology. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The study also examined whether there was a relationship between foot type and the interspace affected with intermetatarsal neuroma, and whether ankle equinus or body mass index had an effect. In total, 100 participants were recruited from The University of Western Australia's Podiatry Clinic, 68 of whom were diagnosed with inter-metatarsal neuroma from 2009 to 2015. There were 32 control participants recruited from 2014 to 2015. The age of subjects was recorded, as were weight and height, which were used to calculate body mass index. The foot posture index and ankle dorsiflexion were measured using standard technique. Independent t-tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare differences in foot posture index, body mass index and ankle dorsiflexion between the inter-metatarsal neuroma and control groups. Multivariable logistic regression was also used to model relationships for outcome. The 68 intermetatarsal neuroma subjects had a mean age of 52Â years (range 20 to 74Â years) and comprised of 56 females and 12 males. The 32 control subjects had a mean age of 49Â years (range 24 to 67Â years) with 26 females and six males. There were no significant differences between the control and the intermetatarsal neuroma groups with respect to the mean foot posture index scores of the left and right foot ( pâ= â0.21 and 0.87, respectively). Additionally no significant differences were detected between the affected intermetatarsal neuroma interspace and foot posture index ( p â=â0.27 and 0.47, respectively). There was no significant difference in mean body mass index between the intermetatarsal neuroma (26.9âÂ±â5.7) and control groups (26.5âÂ±â4.1) ( p â=â0.72). There was, however, a significant difference in mean ankle dorsiflexion between the intermetatarsal neuroma and control\n\nTraumatic facial nerve neuroma with facial palsy presenting in infancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nClark, James H; Burger, Peter C; Boahene, Derek Kofi; Niparko, John K\n\n2010-07-01\n\nTo describe the management of traumatic neuroma of the facial nerve in a child and literature review. Sixteen-month-old male subject. Radiological imaging and surgery. Facial nerve function. The patient presented at 16 months with a right facial palsy and was found to have a right facial nerve traumatic neuroma. A transmastoid, middle fossa resection of the right facial nerve lesion was undertaken with a successful facial nerve-to-hypoglossal nerve anastomosis. The facial palsy improved postoperatively. A traumatic neuroma should be considered in an infant who presents with facial palsy, even in the absence of an obvious history of trauma. The treatment of such lesion is complex in any age group but especially in young children. Symptoms, age, lesion size, growth rate, and facial nerve function determine the appropriate management.\n\nResection planning for robotic acoustic neuroma surgery\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcBrayer, Kepra L.; Wanna, George B.; Dawant, Benoit M.; Balachandran, Ramya; Labadie, Robert F.; Noble, Jack H.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nAcoustic neuroma surgery is a procedure in which a benign mass is removed from the Internal Auditory Canal (IAC). Currently this surgical procedure requires manual drilling of the temporal bone followed by exposure and removal of the acoustic neuroma. This procedure is physically and mentally taxing to the surgeon. Our group is working to develop an Acoustic Neuroma Surgery Robot (ANSR) to perform the initial drilling procedure. Planning the ANSR's drilling region using pre-operative CT requires expertise and around 35 minutes' time. We propose an approach for automatically producing a resection plan for the ANSR that would avoid damage to sensitive ear structures and require minimal editing by the surgeon. We first compute an atlas-based segmentation of the mastoid section of the temporal bone, refine it based on the position of anatomical landmarks, and apply a safety margin to the result to produce the automatic resection plan. In experiments with CTs from 9 subjects, our automated process resulted in a resection plan that was verified to be safe in every case. Approximately 2 minutes were required in each case for the surgeon to verify and edit the plan to permit functional access to the IAC. We measured a mean Dice coefficient of 0.99 and surface error of 0.08 mm between the final and automatically proposed plans. These preliminary results indicate that our approach is a viable method for resection planning for the ANSR and drastically reduces the surgeon's planning effort.\n\nA late unusual complication after an open cholecystectomy: Amputation neuroma of the CBD causing obstructive jaundice.\n\nPubMed\n\nSleiman, Youssef A; Hassoun, Ziad A; Nasser, Haydar A; Abs, Leila; Allouch, Mustafa\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCholecystectomy is one of the most frequently done procedures in general surgery. There are few reports of amputation neuromas following this procedure. This presentation describes a case of obstructive jaundice due to amputation neuroma in a patient with a history of cholecystectomy. We report about a 53 y o lady who presented with obstructive jaundice, 8 years following open cholecystectomy. Paraclinical investigations were in favor of cholangicarcinoma, however the final pathology revealed an amputation neuroma of the CBD. Amputation neuromas are rarely seen in the era of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. They are benign reparative lesions of the CBD following surgery or manipulation of the extra hepatic biliary tree. It is very difficult to diagnose them pre-operatively. Surgical resection is the first choice of treatment. Traumatic neuromas should always be among the differential diagnosis, when assessing a CBD mass in patients with a previous history of open cholecystectomy or surgery to the gastrointestinal tract.

R.; Riley, D. A.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nHistochemical staining for carbonic anhydrase and cholinesterase (CE) activities was used to analyze sensory and motor axon regeneration, respectively, during neuroma formation in transected and tube-encapsulated peripheral nerves. Median-ulnar and sciatic nerves in the rodent model permitted testing whether a 4 cm greater distance of the motor neuron soma from axotomy site or intrinsic differences between motor and sensory neurons influenced regeneration and neuroma formation 10, 30, and 90 days later. Ventral root radiculotomy confirmed that CE-stained axons were 97% alpha motor axons. Distance significantly delayed axon regeneration. When distance was negligible, sensory axons grew out sooner than motor axons, but motor axons regenerated to a greater quantity. These results indicate regeneration differences between axon subtypes and suggest more extensive branching of motor axons within the neuroma. Thus, both distance from injury site to soma and inherent motor and sensory differences should be considered in peripheral nerve repair strategies.\n\nLong-term mobile phone use and acoustic neuroma risk.\n\nPubMed\n\nPettersson, David; Mathiesen, Tiit; Prochazka, Michaela; Bergenheim, Tommy; Florentzson, Rut; Harder, Henrik; Nyberg, Gunnar; SiesjÃ¶, Peter; Feychting, Maria\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThere is concern about potential effects of radiofrequency fields generated by mobile phones on cancer risk. Most previous studies have found no association between mobile phone use and acoustic neuroma, although information about long-term use is limited. We conducted a population-based, nation-wide, case-control study of acoustic neuroma in Sweden. Eligible cases were persons aged 20 to 69 years, who were diagnosed between 2002 and 2007. Controls were randomly selected from the population registry, matched on age, sex, and residential area. Postal questionnaires were completed by 451 cases (83%) and 710 controls (65%). Ever having used mobile phones regularly (defined as weekly use for at least 6 months) was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.18 (95% confidence interval = 0.88 to 1.59). The association was weaker for the longest induction time (â¥10 years) (1.11 [0.76 to 1.61]) and for regular use on the tumor side (0.98 [0.68 to 1.43]). The OR for the highest quartile of cumulative calling time (â¥680 hours) was 1.46 (0.98 to 2.17). Restricting analyses to histologically confirmed cases reduced all ORs; the OR for â¥680 hours was 1.14 (0.63 to 2.07). A similar pattern was seen for cordless land-line phones, although with slightly higher ORs. Analyses of the complete history of laterality of mobile phone revealed considerable bias in laterality analyses. The findings do not support the hypothesis that long-term mobile phone use increases the risk of acoustic neuroma. The study suggests that phone use might increase the likelihood that an acoustic neuroma case is detected and that there could be bias in the laterality analyses performed in previous studies.\n\n[Clinical and radiological evolution of a group of untreated acoustic neuromas].\n\nPubMed\n\nEscorihuela-GarcÃ­a, Vicente; LlÃ³pez-CarratalÃ¡, Ignacio; Orts-Alborch, Miguel; Marco-Algarra, Jaime\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe acoustic neuroma is a benign tumour that originates in the vestibular branch of the eighth cranial nerve. The main treatment is surgery, but many authors suggest that with elderly patients or in small neuromas we can opt for watchful waiting. This was a retrospective study from 2007 to 2013 that included 27 patients diagnosed of acoustic neuroma that had not been treated due to the size of the tumour, age and comorbidities, or by patient choice. We evaluated overall condition, hearing thresholds, degree of canal paresis and central disorders. After 6 years of follow up, clinical manifestations of 18 patients remained unchanged, 5 patients underwent hearing loss and developed tinnitus, 2 cases had more intense tinnitus and 2 cases had dizziness. The radiological controls by magnetic resonance imaging showed that the initial maximum diameters (5-16mm) increased by 1.7mm on average, with annual growth rates below 0.5mm. In selected cases, such as for small neuromas and in elderly patients, the conservative option of close monitoring with magnetic resonance imaging is an important alternative given that, in our cases, clinical features and radiological image did not suffer major changes. If there were any such changes, therapeutic options could be proposed. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L. y Sociedad EspaÃ±ola de OtorrinolaringologÃ­a y PatologÃ­a CÃ©rvico-Facial.

Prospective two-center study. Fifty-one patients (mean age, 53 years) diagnosed with unilateral acoustic neuroma on magnetic resonance imaging at two tertiary referral centers were studied. Preoperatively, each patient had sway patterns (with eyes open and with eyes closed, and standing on foam) recorded for 120 seconds by sway magnetometry. Path length for 30 seconds was calculated. The Romberg coefficient (path length with eyes open divided by path length with eyes closed) was calculated. Forty-four percent of patients had abnormal path lengths with eyes open, and 49% with eyes closed. The Romberg coefficients were significantly lower than normal (P <.001; 95% CI, 0.19-0.87). Mean Romberg coefficient was 0.59 (normal value = 0.73), and all patients had a coefficient of less than 1. Half of preoperative acoustic neuroma patients are unsteady, exhibiting abnormal sway patterns based on path length measurements. The increase in sway path length demonstrable in normal subjects with eyes closed was significantly exaggerated in patients with acoustic neuroma.\n\nPalisaded Encapsulated (Solitary Circumscribed) Neuroma of the Buccal Mucosa: a Rare Case.\n\nPubMed\n\nAtarbashi-Moghadam, Saede; Lotfi, Ali; Salehi Zalani, Saman; Mokhtari, Sepideh\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe rarity of oral soft tissue spindle cell tumors combined with overlapping microscopic patterns can make challenges in their diagnosis and treatment. Oral cavity palisaded encapsulated neuroma is an uncommon lesion which occurs often on the hard palate. It is essential for oral pathologists to be familiar with its histopathology of this lesion is essential since many lesions are probably diagnosed microscopically as neurofibroma or schwannoma. Here, we report a case of oral palisaded encapsulated (solitary circumscribed) neuroma in an unusual site.\n\nRecurrent neuroma formation after lateral arm free flap coverage with neurorraphy to the posteroantebrachial nerve.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeterson, Steven L; Gordon, Michael J\n\n2004-09-01\n\nWe report a patient with previous wrist trauma and development of a symptomatic neuroma of the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve. The patient had previously been successfully treated with lateral arm free flap coverage with neurorrhaphy to a segment of the posteroantebrachial cutaneous nerve carried with the flap. Two years following this procedure the patient experienced re-onset of symptoms prompting surgical exploration of the area. At the time of operation a recurrent neuroma was found at the free distal terminus of the transferred posteroantebrachial cutaneous nerve. The neuroma was repositioned into the distal radius via a burr hole with relief of symptoms.\n\nIncreased Hospital Surgical Volume Reduces Rate of 30- and 90-Day Readmission After Acoustic Neuroma Surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nBabadjouni, Robin; Wen, Timothy; Donoho, Daniel A; Buchanan, Ian A; Cen, Steven Y; Friedman, Rick A; Amar, Arun; Russin, Jonathan J; Giannotta, Steven L; Mack, William J; Attenello, Frank J\n\n2018-06-08\n\nHospital readmissions are commonly linked to elevated health care costs, with significant financial incentive introduced by the Affordable Care Act to reduce readmissions. To study the association between patient, hospital, and payer factors with national rate of readmission in acoustic neuroma surgery. All adult inpatients undergoing surgery for acoustic neuroma in the newly introduced Nationwide Readmissions Database from 2013 to 2014 were included. We identified readmissions for any cause with a primary diagnosis of neurological, surgical, or systemic complication within 30- and 90-d after undergoing acoustic neuroma surgery. Multivariable models were employed to identify patient, hospital, and administrative factors associated with readmission. Hospital volume was measured as the number of cases per year. We included patients representing a weighted estimate of 4890 admissions for acoustic neuroma surgery in 2013 and 2014, with 355 30-d (7.7%) and 341 90-d (9.1%) readmissions. After controlling for patient, hospital, and payer factors, procedural volume was significantly associated with 30-d readmission rate (OR [odds ratio] 0.992, p = 0.03), and 90-d readmission rate (OR 0.994, p = 0.047). The most common diagnoses during readmission in both 30- and 90-d cohorts included general central nervous system complications/deficits, hydrocephalus, infection, and leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (rhinorrhea/otorrhea). After controlling for patient, hospital, and payer factors, increased procedural volume is associated with decreased 30- and 90-d readmission rate for acoustic neuroma surgery. Future studies seeking to improve outcomes and reduce cost in acoustic neuroma surgery may seek to further evaluate the role of hospital procedural volume and experience.\n\nStereotactic Radiosurgery for Acoustic Neuromas: What Happens Long Term?\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRoos, Daniel E., E-mail: daniel.roos@health.sa.gov.au; University of Adelaide School of Medicine, Adelaide, South Australia; Potter, Andrew E.\n\n2012-03-15\n\nPurpose: To determine the clinical outcomes for acoustic neuroma treated with low-dose linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) >10 years earlier at the Royal Adelaide Hospital using data collected prospectively at a dedicated SRS clinic. Methods and Materials: Between November 1993 and December 2000, 51 patients underwent SRS for acoustic neuroma. For the 44 patients with primary SRS for sporadic (unilateral) lesions, the median age was 63 years, the median of the maximal tumor diameter was 21 mm (range, 11-34), and the marginal dose was 14 Gy for the first 4 patients and 12 Gy for the other 40. Results: ThemoreÂ Â» crude tumor control rate was 97.7% (1 patient required salvage surgery for progression at 9.75 years). Only 8 (29%) of 28 patients ultimately retained useful hearing (interaural pure tone average {<=}50 dB). Also, although the Kaplan-Meier estimated rate of hearing preservation at 5 years was 57% (95% confidence interval, 38-74%), this decreased to 24% (95% confidence interval, 11-44%) at 10 years. New or worsened V and VII cranial neuropathy occurred in 11% and 2% of patients, respectively; all cases were transient. No case of radiation oncogenesis developed. Conclusions: The long-term follow-up data of low-dose (12-14 Gy) linear accelerator SRS for acoustic neuroma have confirmed excellent tumor control and acceptable cranial neuropathy rates but a continual decrease in hearing preservation out to {>=}10 years.Â«Â less\n\nMorton neuroma: evaluation with MR imaging performed with contrast enhancement and fat suppression.\n\nPubMed\n\nTerk, M R; Kwong, P K; Suthar, M; Horvath, B C; Colletti, P M\n\n1993-10-01\n\nTo evaluate clinically suspected Morton neuroma with contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images. Fifteen patients with clinically suspected Morton neuroma underwent examination with conventional T1- and T2-weighted MR imaging and a combination of fat suppression and administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine. A T1-weighted spectral presaturation with inversion recovery sequence was used for fat suppression. In six patients, a tumor that conformed to the clinical findings was seen in the interdigital space; surgical findings in these patients correlated closely with the imaging findings in all patients. Patients without positive findings on MR images tended to have less typical clinical findings and received nonsurgical treatment. In all patients, the lesions were best depicted with the combination of contrast-enhanced imaging and fat suppression; conventional MR images either entirely failed to demonstrate the lesions or demonstrated the lesions less clearly. In patients who need imaging confirmation of a clinically suspected Morton neuroma, the combination of fat suppression and contrast enhancement provides reliable high-contrast images.\n\nConcomitance of cervical intramedullary traumatic neuroma and cervical cord herniation in a tetraplegic woman.\n\nPubMed\n\nSu, Hui-Yi; Wu, Yung-Tsan; Liu, Ming-Ying; Lin, Yu-Chun; Chu, Heng-Yi; Chang, Shin-Tsu\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe present the first case of concomitant intramedullary traumatic neuroma and spinal cord herniation. A 57-year-old woman injured her cervical spine with subluxation and cord compression at the C5-C6 level. After the operation, the patient received intensive rehabilitation for one year with well response. Unfortunately, she experienced weakness and progressive numbness extending to all the limbs later. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging revealed spinal cord herniation at the C5-C6 level and pathology proved intramedullary traumatic neuroma. After the second operation, the paresthesia over the trunk and limbs persisted, and the patient was nearly totally assisted in her activities of daily living. The intramedullary traumatic neuroma and spinal cord herniation are rare causes in patients with spinal cord dysfunction. The case presented here indicates the possibility of the coexisting conditions leading to progressive neurologic deficits in patients with old spinal cord injury.\n\nPathophysiology of Post Amputation Pain\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2012-10-11\n\nectopicÂ neuromaÂ andÂ DRGÂ dischargeÂ withoutÂ blockingÂ nerveÂ conduction.Â PainÂ 1992;48:261â8.Â 21.Â MelzackÂ R.Â PhantomÂ limbÂ pain:Â ImplicationsÂ forÂ treatment Â of...ofÂ SurgeryÂ 1938;37:353â70.Â 61.Â KallioÂ K.Â PermanencyÂ ofÂ resultsÂ obtainedÂ byÂ sympatheticÂ surgeryÂ inÂ theÂ treatment Â ofÂ phantomÂ pain.Â ActaÂ OrthopÂ Scand...66.Â BaronÂ R,Â MaierÂ C.Â ReflexÂ sympatheticÂ dystrophy :Â skinÂ bloodÂ flow,Â sympatheticÂ vasoconstrictorÂ reflexesÂ andÂ painÂ beforeÂ andÂ afterÂ surgical\n\n[True myelinic neuroma.

An exhaustive review of the literature on this subject, basically of the Bolande article is carried out by the authors. The mielinic neuromata are a partial aspect of the complexe neuro-crestopathic syndromes associating the cutaneous lesions to: 1) Medullary tyroid carcinoma, 2) pheocromocytoma and 3) neurofibromatous lesions. The observation related by the authors shows: 1) Ehlers-Danlos disease (not described previously), 2) skeletal abnormalities, 3) medullary tyroid carcinoma and 4) pheochromocytoma symptoms.\n\nAnthropogenic Radio-Frequency Electromagnetic Fields Elicit Neuropathic Pain in an Amputation Model\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJones, Erick; Romero-Ortega, Mario\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAnecdotal and clinical reports have suggested that radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMFs) may serve as a trigger for neuropathic pain. However, these reports have been widely disregarded, as the epidemiological effects of electromagnetic fields have not been systematically proven, and are highly controversial. Here, we demonstrate that anthropogenic RF EMFs elicit post-neurotomy pain in a tibial neuroma transposition model. Behavioral assays indicate a persistent and significant pain response to RF EMFs when compared to SHAM surgery groups. Laser thermometry revealed a transient skin temperature increase during stimulation. Furthermore, immunofluorescence revealed an increased expression of temperature sensitive cation channels (TRPV4) in the neuroma bulb, suggesting that RF EMF-induced pain may be due to cytokine-mediated channel dysregulation and hypersensitization, leading to thermal allodynia. Additional behavioral assays were performed using an infrared heating lamp in place of the RF stimulus. While thermally-induced pain responses were observed, the response frequency and progression did not recapitulate the RF EMF effects. In vitro calcium imaging experiments demonstrated that our RF EMF stimulus is sufficient to directly contribute to the depolarization of dissociated sensory neurons. Furthermore, the perfusion of inflammatory cytokine TNF-Î± resulted in a significantly higher percentage of active sensory neurons during RF EMF stimulation. These results substantiate patient reports of RF EMF-pain, in the case of peripheral nerve injury, while confirming the public and scientific consensus that anthropogenic RF EMFs engender no adverse sensory effects in the general population.

The small nerve diameter compromises their evaluation in image studies. To overcome this problem we propose a new electrophysiological test. We conducted a prospective case-control study performing a orthodromic electroneurography using subdermal electrodes in controls and patients to assess the validity. Additionally all patients were tested with magnetic resonance. Some patients required surgery and subsequent histological evaluation. The new ENG procedure showed higher sensitivity and specificity. Methodological standardization was easy and the test was well tolerated by the subjects. Our test demonstrated remarkable diagnostic efficiency, and also was able to identify symptomatic patients undetected by magnetic resonance, which underlines the lack of correlation between the size and intensity of the lesion. This new electrophysiological method appears to be a highly sensitivity, well-tolerated, simple and low-cost for Morton's neuroma diagnosis. Copyright Â© 2014 European Foot and Ankle Society.

Some get painful piercings and tattoos; others can not stand even a flu shot. Interindividual variability is one of the main characteristics of human pain on every level including the processing of nociceptive impulses at the periphery, modification of pain signal in the central nervous system, perception of pain, and response to analgesic strategies. As for many other complex behaviors, the sources of this variability come from both nurture (environment) and nature (genes). Here, I will discuss how these factors contribute to human pain separately and via interplay and how epigenetic mechanisms add to the complexity of their effects. PMID:24278778\n\nPain management: a fundamental human right.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrennan, Frank; Carr, Daniel B; Cousins, Michael\n\n2007-07-01\n\nThis article surveys worldwide medical, ethical, and legal trends and initiatives related to the concept of pain management as a human right. This concept recently gained momentum with the 2004 European Federation of International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Chapters-, International Association for the Study of Pain- and World Health Organization-sponsored \"Global Day Against Pain,\" where it was adopted as a central theme. We survey the scope of the problem of unrelieved pain in three areas, acute pain, chronic noncancer pain, and cancer pain, and outline the adverse physical and psychological effects and social and economic costs of untreated pain. Reasons for deficiencies in pain management include cultural, societal, religious, and political attitudes, including acceptance of torture. The biomedical model of disease, focused on pathophysiology rather than quality of life, reinforces entrenched attitudes that marginalize pain management as a priority. Strategies currently applied for improvement include framing pain management as an ethical issue; promoting pain management as a legal right, providing constitutional guarantees and statutory regulations that span negligence law, criminal law, and elder abuse; defining pain management as a fundamental human right, categorizing failure to provide pain management as professional misconduct, and issuing guidelines and standards of practice by professional bodies. The role of the World Health Organization is discussed, particularly with respect to opioid availability for pain management. We conclude that, because pain management is the subject of many initiatives within the disciplines of medicine, ethics and law, we are at an \"inflection point\" in which unreasonable failure to treat pain is viewed worldwide as poor medicine, unethical practice, and an abrogation of a fundamental human right.\n\nUnilateral deafness after acoustic neuroma surgery: subjective hearing handicap and the effect of the bone-anchored hearing aid.\n\nPubMed\n\nAndersen, Henrik Terkel; SchrÃ¸der, Stine Attrup; Bonding, Per\n\n2006-09-01\n\nTo evaluate the subjective hearing handicap in patients with unilateral deafness after acoustic neuroma surgery and the effect of the Bone-anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA) on test band. Fifty-nine consecutive patients with unilateral deafness after translabyrintine removal of an acoustic neuroma, treated in Denmark in 2001 and 2002, were included. The patients were asked to complete a questionnaire, which addressed the subjective handicap of unilateral deafness; 90% responded. These patients were invited to test the BAHA on test band, and the subjective and objective effects were recorded. Eighty percent of the patients thought that they had a subjective hearing handicap of some significance. However, only 50% accepted the invitation to test the BAHA. The overall subjective effect was positive, and a significant improvement in speech discrimination in noise with the BAHA was demonstrated. After the test, however, only about 50%, that is, 25% of all patients wished implantation for BAHA treatment. This study shows that unilateral deafness after acoustic neuroma surgery is thought as a handicap in most of the patients and confirms that treatment with the BAHA has positive subjective effects and improves speech discrimination in noise. However, only 25% of the patients wished implantation for BAHA treatment. The implications of these findings are discussed. Data from centers that perform simultaneous acoustic neuroma surgery and implantation for BAHA are necessary for firm conclusions.\n\nReexcision Perineural Invasion and Epithelial Sheath Neuroma Possibly on a Spectrum of Postinjury Reactive Hyperplasia Mediated by IL-6.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, James Y; Nuovo, Gerard; Kline, Mitchell; Magro, Cynthia M\n\n2017-01-01\n\nEpithelial sheath neuroma is a rarely recognized but established entity in the medical literature. First described in 2000 by Requena et al, there have only been 7 published cases to date, mostly in female patients and presenting as symptomatic solitary lesions on the back without a known history of trauma. In 2006, Beer et al described and reviewed a dozen cases in which epithelial sheath neuroma-like features were seen in the advent of a surgical procedure, which was termed \"re-excision perineural invasion\" and attributed to possible eccrine duct implantation during surgery. Our case is a 66-year-old male patient who underwent an excision of a melanocytic neoplasm in which a reactive epithelial sheath neuroma was incidentally discovered in the excision specimen, adjacent to the biopsy site cicatrix. Histologically, there was benign cutaneous nerve hyperplasia with a proliferation of squamous epithelium in intimate apposition to the nerve bundles in the superficial dermis. We postulate that the process active in the formation of re-excision perineural invasion is the same as in epithelial sheath neuroma and that minor trauma not appreciable on histologic examination is responsible in the latter entity. We performed IL-6 staining and documented that IL-6 was upregulated at the interface of the nerve and reactive epithelium, but was absent in nerves distant from the site of surgery, suggesting that IL-6 may be essential to the lesion's development. The recognition of reactive epithelial sheath neuroma including the subcategory of re-excision perineural invasion is crucial for the dermatopathologist to prevent mislabeling this reactive entity as a perineural squamous cell carcinoma, which has clinical consequences for the patient such as wider re-excision and radiation treatment. Additionally, we have identified a potential pathophysiologic basis for this lesion.\n\nTraumatic neuroma of the penis after circumcision--Case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nCardoso, ThaÃ­s AbrÃ£o; dos Santos, Karen Regina; Franzotti, Aline Martinez; Avelar, Juliana Centofanti Dentello; Tebcherani, Antonio JosÃ©; Pegas, JosÃ© Roberto Pereira\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTraumatic neuromas are tumors resulting from hyperplasia of axons and nerve sheath cells after section or injury to the nervous tissue. We present a case of this tumor, confirmed by anatomopathological examination, in a male patient with history of circumcision. Knowledge of this entity is very important in achieving the differential diagnosis with other lesions that affect the genital area such as condyloma acuminata, bowenoid papulosis, lichen nitidus, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, achrochordon and pearly penile papules.\n\nAcetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs interact with morphine and tramadol analgesia for the treatment of neuropathic pain in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nShinozaki, Tomonari; Yamada, Toshihiko; Nonaka, Takahiro; Yamamoto, Tatsuo\n\n2015-06-01\n\nAlthough non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen have no proven efficacy against neuropathic pain, they are frequently prescribed for neuropathic pain patients. We examined whether the combination of opioids (tramadol and morphine) with indomethacin or acetaminophen produce favorable effects on neuropathic pain and compared the efficacy for neuropathic pain with that for inflammatory pain. The carrageenan model was used as the inflammatory pain model while the tibial neuroma transposition (TNT) model was used as the neuropathic pain model. The tibial nerve is transected in the TNT model, with the tibial nerve stump then transpositioned to the lateral aspect of the hindlimb. Neuropathic pain (mechanical allodynia and neuroma pain) is observed after TNT injury. Drugs were administered orally. In the carrageenan model, all drugs produced anti-allodynic effects and all drug combinations, but not tramadol + indomethacin combination, produced synergistic anti-allodynic effects. In the TNT model, tramadol and morphine, but not acetaminophen and indomethacin, produced anti-neuropathic pain effects. In the combination, with the exception of morphine + acetaminophen combination, both acetaminophen and indomethacin reduced the 50% effective dose (ED50) of tramadol and morphine as compared with the ED50s for the single drug study in the TNT model. The ED50s of tramadol and morphine in the carrageenan combination test were not statistically significantly different from the ED50s in the TNT model combination study. The combination of opioids with indomethacin or acetaminophen produced a synergistic analgesic effect both in inflammatory and neuropathic pain with some exceptions. The efficacy of these combinations for neuropathic pain was not different from that for inflammatory pain.\n\nUnder Pressure: Applying Practice-Based Learning and Improvement to the Treatment of Chronic Neuropathic Pain in Patients with Burns.\n\nPubMed\n\nRapolti, Mihaela; Wu, Cindy; Schuth, Olga A; Hultman, Charles Scott\n\n2017-10-01\n\nChronic neuropathic pain after burn injury may have multiple causes, such as direct nerve injury, nerve compression, or neuroma formation, and can significantly impair quality of life and limit functional recovery. Management includes a team-based approach that involves close collaboration between occupational and physical therapists, plastic surgeons, and experts in chronic pain, from neurology, anesthesia, psychiatry, and physiatry. Carefully selected patients with an anatomic cause of chronic neuropathic pain unequivocally benefit from surgical intervention. Self-reflection and analysis yield improvement in both efficiency and effectiveness when managing patients with burns with chronic neuropathic pain. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Initial results emphasized the effects of oxytocin with respect to labor and breastfeeding. Diverse animals studies were also able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the peptide in attachment behavior and pain perception; however, it is still unclear how oxytocin affects pain perception in humans. The potential therapeutic effectiveness of oxytocin could be particularly important for primary and secondary treatment of pain patients because chronification of pain can occur more frequently in this area. For this review the databases PubMed, Medline und PsycINFO were searched using the terms oxytocin, pain, human and analgesic. The search resulted in aÂ total of 89Â original articles after excluding articles regarding labor pain, breastfeeding and animal studies. Only those studies were included which were carried out between 1994 and 2015. A total of 17Â articles remained for inclusion in this review and included 13 studies on the exogenous application of oxytocin and 4 on measurement of oxytocin levels in plasma. This review article gives a summary of the current state of research on oxytocin and its direct and indirect association with human pain perception and emphasizes its relevance for the multimodal management of pain.\n\nMeasuring empathy for human and robot hand pain using electroencephalography.\n\nPubMed\n\nSuzuki, Yutaka; Galli, Lisa; Ikeda, Ayaka; Itakura, Shoji; Kitazaki, Michiteru\n\n2015-11-03\n\nThis study provides the first physiological evidence of humans' ability to empathize with robot pain and highlights the difference in empathy for humans and robots. We performed electroencephalography in 15 healthy adults who observed either human- or robot-hand pictures in painful or non-painful situations such as a finger cut by a knife. We found that the descending phase of the P3 component was larger for the painful stimuli than the non-painful stimuli, regardless of whether the hand belonged to a human or robot. In contrast, the ascending phase of the P3 component at the frontal-central electrodes was increased by painful human stimuli but not painful robot stimuli, though the interaction of ANOVA was not significant, but marginal. These results suggest that we empathize with humanoid robots in late top-down processing similarly to human others. However, the beginning of the top-down process of empathy is weaker for robots than for humans.\n\nComplications of the Middle Cranial Fossa Approach for Acoustic Neuroma Removal.\n\nPubMed\n\nScheich, Matthias; Ginzkey, Christian; Ehrmann MÃ¼ller, Desiree; Shehata Dieler, Wafaa; Hagen, Rudolf\n\n2017-08-01\n\nTo analyze postoperative complications after microsurgery for acoustic neuroma (AN) via the middle fossa approach (MFA). In total, 203 consecutive patients of a tertiary skull base referral center at a university hospital were included in this retrospective chart and database analysis. All patients had undergone primary microsurgery at the Otorhinolaryngology department via MFA between December 2005 and October 2014. Postoperative complications were documented during the inpatient stay and outpatient follow-up. Overall, 41 complications were registered in 35 patients. The most common was cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage in 13% of the patients. Bleeding complications were documented in seven patients: two cerebellar bleedings, one subdural and one epidural hematoma, two hematomas of the skin, and one bleeding through the closed wound. Two patients experienced meningitis and one patient had a transient ischemic attack. Furthermore, three cases of deep vein thrombosis occurred, which led to a lethal pulmonary embolism in one case.
