        "text": "Byline: Marion McMullen\n\nName: Holly Marie Combs\n\nImage: Pretty, petite, brunette\n\nBest known for: Playing spell-casting Piper in the supernatural drama series Charmed\n\nEarly Life: Born December 3, 1973, in San Diego, California, to aspiring teenage actress Lauralei Combs.\n\nShe and her mother moved to New York in 1980 to pursue an acting career. Holly enrolled in New York's Professional Children's School and quickly landed jobs in TV commercials and print advertisements.\n\nCareer: At the age of 12, she starred in Walls of Glass alongside her mother and a host of famous faces, including Olympia Dukakis.\n\nSeveral other roles followed, but her big break came at 18 playing the part of Tom Skerritt's daughter in Picket Fences. The role won her a Young Artist Award in 1993.\n\nShe has since shot to fame globally as Piper Halliwell in glossy series Charmed, casting spells alongside her screen siblings Alyssa Milano, Rose McGowan, and Beverly Hills 90210's Shannen Doherty.\n\nLove life: Married to actor Bryan Smith for four years, but the couple divorced in 1997.\n\nShe has been linked since then to Storm Lyndon and Charmed's key grip David W Donoho.\n\nDon't mention: The nude photos of her doing the rounds on the internet.\n\nShe has appeared topless in one movie, but there are dozens of pictures which have been altered, placing her head on other women's bodies.\n\nThe situation is not one she likes, and she is frustrated because little can be done to prevent it.\n\nQuote: Referring to her youth: \"I was the angriest little person imaginable.\n\n\"I woke up with a frown every morning.\n\n\"I barely talked, wore black all the time, and had some serious teenage rebellion years.\"\n\nCatch her tonight in Charmed on Five.\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nSPELL-CASTING: Holly Marie Combs plays Piper in Charmed"
