        "text": "Deletion of alpha-synuclein decreases impulsivity in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeÃ±a-Oliver, Y; Buchman, V L; Dalley, J W; Robbins, T W; Schumann, G; Ripley, T L; King, S L; Stephens, D N\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThe presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein, associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD), plays a role in dopaminergic neurotransmission and is implicated in impulse control disorders (ICDs) such as drug addiction. In this study we investigated a potential causal relationship between alpha-synuclein and impulsivity, by evaluating differences in motor impulsivity in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) in strains of mice that differ in the expression of the alpha-synuclein gene. C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice differ from their C57BL/6J ancestors in possessing a chromosomal deletion resulting in the loss of two genes, snca, encoding alpha-synuclein, and mmrn1, encoding multimerin-1. C57BL/6J mice displayed higher impulsivity (more premature responding) than C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice when the pre-stimulus waiting interval was increased in the 5-CSRTT. In order to ensure that the reduced impulsivity was indeed related to snca, and not adjacent gene deletion, wild type (WT) and mice with targeted deletion of alpha-synuclein (KO) were tested in the 5-CSRTT. Similarly, WT mice were more impulsive than mice with targeted deletion of alpha-synuclein. Interrogation of our ongoing analysis of impulsivity in BXD recombinant inbred mouse lines revealed an association of impulsive responding with levels of alpha-synuclein expression in hippocampus. Expression of beta- and gamma-synuclein, members of the synuclein family that may substitute for alpha-synuclein following its deletion, revealed no differential compensations among the mouse strains. These findings suggest that alpha-synuclein may contribute to impulsivity and potentially, to ICDs which arise in some PD patients treated with dopaminergic medication. Â© 2011 The Authors.

Genetic variation in neuregulin 1 (NRG1) increases the risk of developing schizophrenia and may help predict which high-risk individuals will transition to psychosis. NRG1 also modulates sensorimotor gating, a schizophrenia endophenotype. We used an animal model to demonstrate that partial genetic deletion of Nrg1 interacts with stress to promote neurobehavioral deficits of relevance to schizophrenia. Nrg1 heterozygous (HET) mice displayed greater acute stress-induced anxiety-related behavior than wild-type (WT) mice. Repeated stress in adolescence disrupted the normal development of higher prepulse inhibition of startle selectively in Nrg1 HET mice but not in WT mice. Further, repeated stress increased dendritic spine density in pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) selectively in Nrg1 HET mice. Partial genetic deletion of Nrg1 also modulated the adaptive response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to repeated stress, with Nrg1 HET displaying a reduced repeated stress-induced level of plasma corticosterone than WT mice. Our results demonstrate that Nrg1 confers vulnerability to repeated stress-induced sensorimotor gating deficits, dendritic spine growth in the mPFC, and an abberant endocrine response in adolescence.

Midkine is a 13-kDa retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding growth factor involved in many biological processes in the central nervous system such as cell migration, neurogenesis and tissue repair. The abnormal midkine expression may be associated with neurochemical dysfunction in the dopaminergic system and cognitive impairments in rodents. Here, we employed adult midkine knockout mice (Mdk(-/-)) to further investigate the relevance of midkine in dopaminergic neurotransmission and in olfactory, cognitive and motor functions. Mdk(/-) mice displayed pronounced impairments in their olfactory discrimination ability and short-term social recognition memory with no gross motor alterations. Moreover, the genetic deletion of midkine decreased the expression of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra reducing partially the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in the olfactory bulb and striatum of mice. These findings indicate that the genetic deletion of midkine causes a partial loss of dopaminergic neurons and depletion of dopamine, resulting in olfactory and memory deficits with no major motor impairments. Therefore, Mdk(-/-) mice may represent a promising animal model for the study of the early stages of PD and for testing new therapeutic strategies to restore sensorial and cognitive processes in PD.\n\nPartial genetic deletion of neuregulin 1 modulates the effects of stress on sensorimotor gating, dendritic morphology, and HPA axis activity in adolescent mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nChohan, Tariq W; Boucher, Aurelie A; Spencer, Jarrah R; Kassem, Mustafa S; Hamdi, Areeg A; Karl, Tim; Fok, Sandra Y; Bennett, Maxwell R; Arnold, Jonathon C\n\n2014-11-01\n\nStress has been linked to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

Here, we assessed whether deleting PTEN in adult neurons post-SCI is also effective, and whether enhanced regenerative growth is accompanied by enhanced recovery of voluntary motor function. PTENloxP/loxP mice received moderate contusion injuries at cervical level 5 (C5). One group received unilateral injections of adeno-associated virus expressing CRE (AAV-CRE) into the sensorimotor cortex; controls received a vector expressing green fluorescent protein (AAV-GFP) or injuries only (no vector injections). Forelimb function was tested for 14 weeks post-SCI using a grip strength meter (GSM) and a hanging task. The corticospinal tract (CST) was traced by injecting mini-ruby BDA into the sensorimotor cortex. Forelimb gripping ability was severely impaired immediately post-SCI but recovered slowly over time. The extent of recovery was significantly greater in PTEN-deleted mice in comparison to either the AAV-GFP group or the injury only group. BDA tract tracing revealed significantly higher numbers of BDA-labeled axons in caudal segments in the PTEN-deleted group compared to control groups. In addition, in the PTEN-deleted group, there were exuberant collaterals extending from the main tract rostral to the lesion, into and around the scar tissue at the injury site. These results indicate that PTEN deletion in adult mice shortly post-SCI can enhance regenerative growth of CST axons and forelimb motor function recovery.

Frank; Dirksen, Robert T.; Thornton, Charles A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMyotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a genetic disorder in which dominant-active DM protein kinase (DMPK) transcripts accumulate in nuclear foci, leading to abnormal regulation of RNA processing. A leading approach to treat DM1 uses DMPK-targeting antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to reduce levels of toxic RNA. However, basal levels of DMPK protein are reduced by half in DM1 patients. This raises concern that intolerance for further DMPK loss may limit ASO therapy, especially since mice with Dmpk gene deletion reportedly show cardiac defects and skeletal myopathy. We re-examined cardiac and muscle function in mice with Dmpk gene deletion, and studied post-maturity knockdown using Dmpk-targeting ASOs in mice with heterozygous deletion. Contrary to previous reports, we found no effect of Dmpk gene deletion on cardiac or muscle function, when studied on two genetic backgrounds. In heterozygous knockouts, the administration of ASOs reduced Dmpk expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle byâ>â90%, yet survival, electrocardiogram intervals, cardiac ejection fraction and muscle strength remained normal. The imposition of cardiac stress by pressure overload, or muscle stress by myotonia, did not unmask a requirement for DMPK. Our results support the feasibility and safety of using ASOs for post-transcriptional silencing of DMPK in muscle and heart.

However, targeting genes in mice is sometimes difficult, especially for small genes, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and targeting genes in repeat sequences. Here we optimized the application of TALEN system for mice and successfully obtained gene targeting technique in mice for intergenic region and series of microRNAs. Microinjection of synthesized RNA of TALEN targeting each gene in one cell stage of embryo was carried out and injected oocytes were transferred into pseudopregnant ICR female mice, producing a high success rate of the targeted deletion of miRNA genes. In our condition, TALEN RNA without poly(A) tail worked better than that of with poly(A) tail. This mutated allele in miRNA was transmitted to the next generation, suggesting the successful germ line transmission of this targeting method. Consistent with our notion of miRNAs maturation mechanism, in homozygous mutant mice of miR-10a, the non- mutated strand of miRNAs expression was completely diminished. This method will lead us to expand and accelerate our genetic research using mice in a high throughput way.\n\nDeletion of Fanca or Fancd2 dysregulates Treg in mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDu, Wei; Erden, Ozlem; Wilson, Andrew; Sipple, Jared M.; Schick, Jonathan; Mehta, Parinda; Myers, Kasiani C.; Steinbrecher, Kris A.; Davies, Stella M.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder associated with bone marrow (BM) failure and leukemia. Recent studies demonstrate variable immune defects in FA. However, the cause for FA immunodeficiency is unknown. Here we report that deletion of Fanca or Fancd2 dysregulates the suppressive activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs), shown functionally as exacerbation of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in mice. Recipient mice of Fancaâ/â or Fancd2â/â BM chimeras exhibited severe acute GVHD after allogeneic BM transplantation (BMT). T cells from Fancaâ/â or Fancd2â/â mice induced higher GVHD lethality than those from wild-type (WT) littermates. FA Tregs possessed lower proliferative suppression potential compared with WT Tregs, as demonstrated by in vitro proliferation assay and BMT. Analysis of CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs indicated that loss of Fanca or Fancd2 dysregulated Foxp3 target gene expression. Additionally, CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs of Fancaâ/â or Fancd2â/â mice were less efficient in suppressing the production of GVHD-associated inflammatory cytokines. Consistently, aberrant NF-ÎºB activity was observed in infiltrated T cells from FA GVHD mice. Conditional deletion of p65 in FA Tregs decreased GVHD mortality. Our study uncovers an essential role for FA proteins in maintaining Treg homeostasis, possibly explaining, at least in part, the immune deficiency reported in some FA patients.

Genetic studies have indicated linkage of ErbB4 and type II diabetes and obesity, but its role in metabolic syndrome (MetS) has not been reported. In the current study, we found that compared to wild-type, mice with ErbB4 deletion developed MetS after 24 weeks on a medium-fat diet (MFD) as indicated by development of obesity, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance. ErbB4 deletion mice also had increased amounts of subcutaneous and visceral fat with increased serum leptin levels, whereas levels of adiponectin were not significantly different. Histologically, severe inflammation, indicated by F4/80 immunostaining and M1 macrophage polarization, was detected in both inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and epididymal WAT (eWAT) in ErbB4 deletion mice. ErbB4 expression decreased during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. Administration to 3T3-L1 adipocytes of NRG4, a specific ligand for ErbB4, had no effect on adipogenesis and lipolysis, but significantly inhibited lipogenesis, promoted browning, induced GLUT4 redistribution to cell membrane, and increased glucose uptake. NRG4 treatment also significantly increased glucose uptake in adipocytes isolated from wild-type mice, while those effects were significantly decreased in adipocytes isolated from ErbB4 deletion mice. In conclusion, our results indicate that ErbB4 may play an important role in glucose homeostasis and lipogenesis. ErbB4 deficiency-related obesity and adipose tissue inflammation may contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome.\n\nGenetic Deletion of Akt3 Induces an Endophenotype Reminiscent of Psychiatric Manifestations in Mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBergeron, Yan; Bureau, GeneviÃ¨ve; Laurier-Laurin, Marie-Ãlaine; Asselin, Eric; Massicotte, Guy; Cyr, Michel\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), found in three distinctive isoforms (PKBÎ±/Akt1, PKBÎ²/Akt2, PKBÎ³/Akt3), is implicated in a variety of cellular processes such as cell development, growth and survival. Although Akt3 is the most expressed isoform in the brain, its role in cerebral functions is still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the behavioral, electrophysiological and biochemical consequences of Akt3 deletion in mice. Motor abilities, spatial navigation, recognition memory and LTP are intact in the Akt3 knockout (KO) mice. However, the prepulse inhibition, three-chamber social, forced swim, tail suspension, open field, elevated plus maze and light-dark transition tests revealed an endophenotype reminiscent of psychiatric manifestations such as schizophrenia, anxiety and depression. Biochemical investigations revealed that Akt3 deletion was associated with reduced levels of phosphorylated GSK3Î±/Î² at serine 21/9 in several brain regions, although Akt1 and Akt2 levels were unaffected. Notably, chronic administration of lithium, a mood stabilizer, restored the decreased phosphorylated GSK3Î±/Î² levels and rescued the depressive and anxiety-like behaviors in the Akt3 KO mice. Collectively, our data suggest that Akt3 might be a critical molecule underlying psychiatric-related behaviors in mice.

Most genes underlying inherited cardiac arrhythmias, including KCNE3, are not exclusively expressed in the heart, suggesting potentially complex disease etiologies. Here we investigated mechanisms of KCNE3-linked arrhythmogenesis in Kcne3â/â mice using real-time qPCR, echo- and electrocardiography, ventricular myocyte patch-clamp, coronary artery ligation/reperfusion, blood analysis, cardiac synaptosome exocytosis, microarray and pathway analysis, and multitissue histology. Kcne3 transcript was undetectable in adult mouse atria, ventricles, and adrenal glands, but Kcne3â/â mice exhibited 2.3-fold elevated serum aldosterone (P=0.003) and differentially expressed gene networks consistent with an adrenal-targeted autoimmune response. Furthermore, 8/8 Kcne3â/â mice vs. 0/8 Kcne3+/+ mice exhibited an activated-lymphocyte adrenal infiltration (P=0.0002). Kcne3 deletion also caused aldosterone-dependent ventricular repolarization delay (19.6% mean QTc prolongation in females; P<0.05) and aldosterone-dependent predisposition to postischemia arrhythmogenesis. Thus, 5/11 Kcne3â/â mice vs. 0/10 Kcne3+/+ mice exhibited sustained ventricular tachycardia during reperfusion (P<0.05). Kcne3 deletion is therefore arrhythmogenic by a novel mechanism in which secondary hyperaldosteronism, associated with an adrenal-specific lymphocyte infiltration, impairs ventricular repolarization. The findings highlight the importance of considering extracardiac pathogenesis when investigating arrhythmogenic mechanisms, even in inherited, monogenic channelopathies.âHu, Z., Crump, S.

To critically evaluate whether the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) plays a role in postnatal refractive development in mice. Methods. Custom-built biometric systems specifically designed for mice were used to assess the development of relative myopia by examining refraction and biometrics in A2AR knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates between postnatal days (P)28 and P56. Ocular dimensions were measured by customized optical coherence tomography (OCT), refractive state by eccentric infrared photorefraction (EIR), and corneal radius of curvature by modified keratometry. Scleral collagen diameter and density were examined by electron microscopy on P35. The effect of A2AR activation on collagen mRNA expression and on soluble collagen production was examined in cultured human scleral fibroblasts by real-time RT-PCR and a collagen assay kit. Results. Compared with WT littermates, the A2AR KO mice displayed relative myopia (average difference, 5.1 D between P28 and P35) and associated increases in VC depth and axial length from P28 to P56. Furthermore, the myopic shift in A2AR KO mice was associated with ultrastructural changes in the sclera: Electron microscopy revealed denser collagen fibrils with reduced diameter in A2AR KO compared with WT. Last, A2AR activation induced expression of mRNAs for collagens I, III, and V and increased production of soluble collagen in cultured human scleral fibroblasts. Conclusions. Genetic deletion of the A2AR promotes development of relative myopia with increased axial length and altered scleral collagen fiber structure during postnatal development in mice. Thus, the A2AR may be important in normal refractive development.

In the present study, we crossed mice transgenic for loxP-Ikbk2 and human Gfap-cre to selectively delete IKK2 in CNS astrocytes. Unexpectedly, a subset of mice developed severe and progressive skin lesions marked by hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, dysplasia, inflammation, and neoplasia with a subset of lesions diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The development of lesions was monitored over a 3.5-y period and over 4 filial generations. Average age of onset of was 4 mo of age with 19.5% of mice affected with frequency increasing in progressive generations. Lesion development appeared to correlate not only with unintended IKK2 deletion in GFAP expressing cells of the epidermis, but also with increased expression of TNF in lesioned skin. The skins changes described in these animals are similar to those in transgenic mice with an epidermis-specific deletion of NFÎºB and thus represents another genetic mouse model that can be used to study the role of NFÎºB signaling in regulating the development of SCC.

The frequency of DNA deletions can be elevated by exposure to carcinogens or by mutations in genes involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity. The in vivo DNA deletion assay allows a visual detection of deletion events within the pink-eyed unstable (pun) locus in developing mouse embryos. A deletion of one copy of a duplicated 70-kb DNA fragment within the pun locus restores the pink-eyed dilute (p) gene, which encodes a protein responsible for the assembly of a black color melanin complex. Deletion events occurring in premelanocytes cause visible black patches (fur-spots) on the light gray fur of offspring and black pigmented cells (eye-spots) on the unpigmented retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In the fur-spot assay, 10-d-old pups are observed for black spots on the fur. In the eye-spot assay, mice are sacrificed at d 20, eyes are removed, and the wholemount RPE slides are prepared for eye-spot analysis. The frequency, size, and position relative to the optic nerve of the eye-spots are determined. This assay can be used to study the effect of environmental chemicals and physical agents as well as the genetic control of DNA deletions in vivo.\n\nSnoRNA Snord116 (Pwcr1/MBII-85) Deletion Causes Growth Deficiency and Hyperphagia in Mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDing, Feng; Li, Hong Hua; Zhang, Shengwen; Solomon, Nicola M.; Camper, Sally A.; Cohen, Pinchas; Francke, Uta\n\n2008-01-01\n\nPrader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the leading genetic cause of obesity. After initial severe hypotonia, PWS children become hyperphagic and morbidly obese, if intake is not restricted. Short stature with abnormal growth hormone secretion, hypogonadism, cognitive impairment, anxiety and behavior problems are other features. PWS is caused by lack of expression of imprinted genes in a â¼4 mb region of chromosome band 15q11.2. Our previous translocation studies predicted a major role for the C/D box small nucleolar RNA cluster SNORD116 (PWCR1/HBII-85) in PWS. To test this hypothesis, we created a â¼150 kb deletion of the >40 copies of Snord116 (Pwcr1/MBII-85) in C57BL/6 mice. Snord116del mice with paternally derived deletion lack expression of this snoRNA. They have early-onset postnatal growth deficiency, but normal fertility and lifespan. While pituitary structure and somatotrophs are normal, liver Igf1 mRNA is decreased. In cognitive and behavior tests, Snord116del mice are deficient in motor learning and have increased anxiety. Around three months of age, they develop hyperphagia, but stay lean on regular and high-fat diet. On reduced caloric intake, Snord116del mice maintain their weight better than wild-type littermates, excluding increased energy requirement as a cause of hyperphagia. Normal compensatory feeding after fasting, and ability to maintain body temperature in the cold indicate normal energy homeostasis regulation. Metabolic chamber studies reveal that Snord116del mice maintain energy homeostasis by altered fuel usage. Prolonged mealtime and increased circulating ghrelin indicate a defect in meal termination mechanism. Snord116del mice, the first snoRNA deletion animal model, reveal a novel role for a non-coding RNA in growth and feeding regulation.

A polymorphic variant in SLC30A8 is associated with altered susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Several groups have examined the effect of global Slc30a8 gene deletion but the results have been highly variable, perhaps due to the mixed 129SvEv/C57BL/6J genetic background of the mice studied. We therefore sought to remove the conflicting effect of 129SvEv-specific modifier genes. Methods The impact of Slc30a8 deletion was examined in the context of the pure C57BL/6J genetic background. Results Male C57BL/6J Slc30a8 knockout (KO) mice had normal fasting insulin levels and no change in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from isolated islets in marked contrast to the â¼50% and â¼35% decrease, respectively, in both parameters observed in male mixed genetic background Slc30a8 KO mice. This observation suggests that 129SvEv-specific modifier genes modulate the impact of Slc30a8 deletion. In contrast, female C57BL/6J Slc30a8 KO mice had reduced (â¼20%) fasting insulin levels, though this was not associated with a change in fasting blood glucose (FBG), or GSIS from isolated islets. This observation indicates that gender also modulates the impact of Slc30a8 deletion, though the physiological explanation as to why impaired insulin secretion is not accompanied by elevated FBG is unclear. Neither male nor female C57BL/6J Slc30a8 KO mice showed impaired glucose tolerance. Conclusions Our data suggest that, despite a marked reduction in islet zinc content, the absence of ZnT-8 does not have a substantial impact on mouse physiology.

Conversely, deleterious point mutations of this gene do not show any clinical phenotypes. The aim of this study is to generate mice carrying large deletions, duplications and inversions involving the Cntn6 gene as a new experimental model to study CNV of the human CNTN6 locus. To generate large chromosomal rearrangements on mouse chromosome 6, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 technology in zygotes. Two guide RNAs (gRNAs) (flanking a DNA fragment of 1137Â Mb) together with Cas9 mRNA and single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ssODN) were microinjected into the cytoplasm of 599 zygotes of F1 (C57BL x CBA) mice, and 256 of them were transplanted into oviducts of CD-1 females. As a result, we observed the birth of 41 viable F0 offspring. Genotyping of these mice was performed by PCR analysis and sequencing of PCR products. Among the 41Â F0 offspring, we identified seven mice with deletions, two animals carrying duplications of the gene and four carrying inversions. Interestingly, two F0 offspring had both deletions and duplications. It is important to note that while three of seven deletion carriers showed expected sequences at the new joint sites, in another three, we identified an absence of 1-10 nucleotides at the CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites, and in one animal, 103Â bp were missing, presumably due to error-prone non-homologous end joining. In addition, we detected the absence of 5 and 13 nucleotides at these sites in two F0 duplication carriers. Similar sequence changes at CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites were observed at the right and left boundaries of inversions. Thus, megabase-scale deletions, duplications and inversions were identified in 11Â F0 offspring among 41 analyzed, i.e., approximately 25% efficiency. All genetically modified F0 offspring were viable and\n\nCharacterization of a genetically engineered mouse model of hemophilia A with complete deletion of the F8 gene.\n\nPubMed\n\nChao, B N; Baldwin, W H; Healey, J F; Parker, E T; Shafer-Weaver, K; Cox, C; Jiang, P; Kanellopoulou, C; Lollar, P; Meeks, S L; Lenardo, M J\n\n2016-02-01\n\nESSENTIALS: Anti-factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitory antibody formation is a severe complication in hemophilia A therapy. We genetically engineered and characterized a mouse model with complete deletion of the F8 coding region. F8(TKO) mice exhibit severe hemophilia, express no detectable F8 mRNA, and produce FVIII inhibitors. The defined background and lack of FVIII in F8(TKO) mice will aid in studying FVIII inhibitor formation. The most important complication in hemophilia A treatment is the development of inhibitory anti-Factor VIII (FVIII) antibodies in patients after FVIII therapy. Patients with severe hemophilia who express no endogenous FVIII (i.e. cross-reacting material, CRM) have the greatest incidence of inhibitor formation. However, current mouse models of severe hemophilia A produce low levels of truncated FVIII. The lack of a corresponding mouse model hampers the study of inhibitor formation in the complete absence of FVIII protein. We aimed to generate and characterize a novel mouse model of severe hemophilia A (designated the F8(TKO) strain) lacking the complete coding sequence of F8 and any FVIII CRM. Mice were created on a C57BL/6 background using Cre-Lox recombination and characterized using in vivo bleeding assays, measurement of FVIII activity by coagulation and chromogenic assays, and anti-FVIII antibody production using ELISA. All F8 exonic coding regions were deleted from the genome and no F8 mRNA was detected in F8(TKO) mice. The bleeding phenotype of F8(TKO) mice was comparable to E16 mice by measurements of factor activity and tail snip assay. Similar levels of anti-FVIII antibody titers after recombinant FVIII injections were observed between F8(TKO) and E16 mice. We describe a new C57BL/6 mouse model for severe hemophilia A patients lacking CRM. These mice can be directly bred to the many C57BL/6 strains of genetically engineered mice, which is valuable for studying the impact of a wide variety of genes on FVIII inhibitor formation on a\n\nAcute morphine effects on respiratory activity in mice with target deletion of the tachykinin 1 gene (Tac1-/-).\n\nPubMed\n\nShvarev, Yuri; Berner, Jonas; Bilkei-Gorzo, Andras; Lagercrantz, Hugo; WickstrÃ¶m, Ronny\n\n2010-01-01\n\nSearch for physiological mechanisms which could antagonize the opioid-induced respiratory depression is of important clinical value. In this study, we investigated the acute effects of morphine on respiratory activity in genetically modified newborn (P2) mice with target deletion of the (Tac1 -/-) gene lacking substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA). In vivo, as shown with whole-body flow barometric plethysmography technique, morphine induced significantly attenuated minute ventilation during intermittent hypoxia in control animals. In contrast, knockout mice revealed significant increase in minute ventilation. In vitro, in brainstem preparation, knockout mice demonstrated greater changes in burst frequency during intermittent anoxia challenge. The data suggest that hereditary deficiency in tachykinins, SP and NKA results in more robust hypoxic response in newborn Tac1-/- mice during respiratory depression induced by morphine.\n\nDeletion of ultraconserved elements yields viable mice\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAhituv, Nadav; Zhu, Yiwen; Visel, Axel\n\n2007-07-15\n\nUltraconserved elements have been suggested to retainextended perfect sequence identity between the human, mouse, and ratgenomes due to essential functional properties. To investigate thenecessities of these elements in vivo, we removed four non-codingultraconserved elements (ranging in length from 222 to 731 base pairs)from the mouse genome. To maximize the likelihood of observing aphenotype, we chose to delete elements that function as enhancers in amouse transgenic assay and that are near genes that exhibit markedphenotypes both when completely inactivated in the mouse as well as whentheir expression is altered due to other genomic modifications.Remarkably, all four resulting lines of mice lackingmoreÂ Â» these ultraconservedelements were viable and fertile, and failed to reveal any criticalabnormalities when assayed for a variety of phenotypes including growth,longevity, pathology and metabolism. In addition more targeted screens,informed by the abnormalities observed in mice where genes in proximityto the investigated elements had been altered, also failed to revealnotable abnormalities. These results, while not inclusive of all thepossible phenotypic impact of the deleted sequences, indicate thatextreme sequence constraint does not necessarily reflect crucialfunctions required for viability.Â«Â less\n\nTargeted Deletions of COX-2 and Atherogenesis in Mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHui, Yiqun; Ricciotti, Emanuela; Crichton, Irene; Yu, Zhou; Wang, Dairong; Stubbe, Jane; Wang, Miao; PurÃ©, Ellen; FitzGerald, Garret A.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground While the dominant product of vascular cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, prostacyclin (PGI2), restrains atherogenesis, inhibition and deletion of COX-2 have yielded conflicting results in mouse models of atherosclerosis. Floxed mice were used to parse distinct cellular contributions of COX-2 in macrophages (Mac) and T cells (TC) to atherogenesis. Methods and Results Deletion of Mac COX-2 (MacKO) was attained using LysMCre mice and suppressed completely lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated Mac prostaglandin (PG) formation and LPS evoked systemic PG biosynthesis by â¼ 30%. LPS stimulated COX-2 expression was suppressed in polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) isolated from MacKOs, but PG formation was not even detected in PMN supernatants from control mice. Atherogenesis was attenuated when MacKOs were crossed into hyperlipidemic LdlR KOs. Deletion of Mac COX-2 appeared to remove a restraint on COX-2 expression in lesional non-leukocyte (CD45 and CD11b negative) vascular cells that express vascular cell adhesion molecule and variably, Î±-smooth muscle actin and vimentin, portending a shift in PG profile and consequent atheroprotection. Basal expression of COX-2 was minimal in TCs, but use of CD4Cre to generate TC knockouts (TCKOs) depressed its modest upregulation by anti-CD3Îµ. However, biosynthesis of PGs, TC composition in lymphatic organs and atherogenesis in LDLR KOs were unaltered in TCKOs. Conclusions Mac COX-2, primarily a source of thromboxane A2 and PGE2, promotes atherogenesis and exerts a restraint on enzyme expression by lesional cells suggestive of vascular smooth muscle cells, a prominent source of atheroprotective PGI2. TC COX-2 does not influence detectably TC development or function nor atherogenesis in mice.

We obtained a dominant cataract mouse model from a spontaneous mutation in the F1 hybrids of outbred strain ICR mice crossed to the inbred strain BALB/cJ mice. Heterozygous and homozygous mutants expressed a nuclear cataract in both eyes. In 8-day-old mice, histological analysis showed that polygon epithelial cells were in the equatorial region and cortex underneath, and vacuole and sponge-like degeneration were in the cortical area underneath the posterior lens capsule. The nucleus of the lens was a deeply stained pink, with the shorter fibers losing their normal arrangement. For the entire eye, there was a blank zone in the equatorial region in 8-day-old mice; however, there was a certain degree of atrophy in cornea tension and retina in the lens in 3-month-old mice. The lens had been serious damaged in the homozygous mutants. For mutation mapping, heterozygous carriers were mated to wild-type C3H/HeJ mice, and offspring (F1 generation) with cataracts were backcrossed to the wild-type C3H/HeJ mice again. N2 mice with cataracts were used for genotyping. Using genome-wide linkage analysis, the mutation was mapped to chromosome 1 and the Cryg gene cluster between two markers was confirmed as the candidate gene. After direct sequencing the cDNA of the Cryg gene cluster, a 1-bp deletion was found in exon 3 of the Crygc gene, leading to a stop codon at the 76th amino acid of exon 3 which results in production of a truncated protein in mutant mice (Leu160Stop). Bioinformatic analysis of the mutant gammaC-crystallin reveals that the COOH-terminal of the mutant protein deletes a beta-sheet, which affects the function of the lens proteins and leads to the development of cataracts.\n\nGenetic deletion of melanin-concentrating hormone neurons impairs hippocampal short-term synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent forms of short-term memory.\n\nPubMed\n\nLe Barillier, LÃ©a; LÃ©ger, Lucienne; Luppi, Pierre-HervÃ©; Fort, Patrice; Malleret, GaÃ«l; Salin, Paul-Antoine\n\n2015-11-01\n\nThe cognitive role of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons, a neuronal population located in the mammalian postero-lateral hypothalamus sending projections to all cortical areas, remains poorly understood. Mainly activated during paradoxical sleep (PS), MCH neurons have been implicated in sleep regulation. The genetic deletion of the only known MCH receptor in rodent leads to an impairment of hippocampal dependent forms of memory and to an alteration of hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity. By using MCH/ataxin3 mice, a genetic model characterized by a selective deletion of MCH neurons in the adult, we investigated the role of MCH neurons in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent forms of memory. MCH/ataxin3 mice exhibited a deficit in the early part of both long-term potentiation and depression in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) was diminished while synaptic depression induced by repetitive stimulation was enhanced suggesting an alteration of pre-synaptic forms of short-term plasticity in these mice. Behaviorally, MCH/ataxin3 mice spent more time and showed a higher level of hesitation as compared to their controls in performing a short-term memory T-maze task, displayed retardation in acquiring a reference memory task in a Morris water maze, and showed a habituation deficit in an open field task. Deletion of MCH neurons could thus alter spatial short-term memory by impairing short-term plasticity in the hippocampus. Altogether, these findings could provide a cellular mechanism by which PS may facilitate memory encoding. Via MCH neuron activation, PS could prepare the day's learning by increasing and modulating short-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.

We previously demonstrated that mice with genetic deletion of Rnd3 developed a markedly larger brain compared with wild-type mice. Here, we demonstrate that Rnd3 knockout mice developed an enlarged subventricular zone, and we identify a novel role for Rnd3 as an inhibitor of Notch signaling in neural stem cells. Rnd3 deficiency, both in vivo and in vitro , resulted in increased levels of Notch intracellular domain protein. This led to enhanced Notch signaling and promotion of aberrant neural stem cell growth, thereby resulting in a larger subventricular zone and a markedly larger brain. Inhibition of Notch activity abrogated this aberrant neural stem cell growth.\n\nGenetic deletion of keratin 8 corrects the altered bone formation and osteopenia in a mouse model of cystic fibrosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nLe Henaff, Carole; Faria Da Cunha, MÃ©lanie; Hatton, AurÃ©lie; Tondelier, Danielle; Marty, Caroline; Collet, Corinne; Zarka, MylÃ¨ne; Geoffroy, ValÃ©rie; Zatloukal, Kurt; Laplantine, Emmanuel; Edelman, Aleksander; Sermet-Gaudelus, Isabelle; Marie, Pierre J\n\n2016-04-01\n\nPatients with cystic fibrosis (CF) display low bone mass and alterations in bone formation. Mice carrying the F508del genetic mutation in the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (Cftr) gene display reduced bone formation and decreased bone mass. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to these skeletal defects are unknown, which precludes the development of an efficient anti-osteoporotic therapeutic strategy. Here we report a key role for the intermediate filament protein keratin 8 (Krt8), in the osteoblast dysfunctions in F508del-Cftr mice. We found that murine and human osteoblasts express Cftr and Krt8 at low levels. Genetic studies showed that Krt8 deletion (Krt8(-/-)) in F508del-Cftr mice increased the levels of circulating markers of bone formation, corrected the expression of osteoblast phenotypic genes, promoted trabecular bone formation and improved bone mass and microarchitecture. Mechanistically, Krt8 deletion in F508del-Cftr mice corrected overactive NF-ÎºB signaling and decreased Wnt-Î²-catenin signaling induced by the F508del-Cftr mutation in osteoblasts. In vitro, treatment with compound 407, which specifically disrupts the Krt8-F508del-Cftr interaction in epithelial cells, corrected the abnormal NF-ÎºB and Wnt-Î²-catenin signaling and the altered phenotypic gene expression in F508del-Cftr osteoblasts. In vivo, short-term treatment with 407 corrected the altered Wnt-Î²-catenin signaling and bone formation in F508del-Cftr mice. Collectively, the results show that genetic or pharmacologic targeting of Krt8 leads to correction of osteoblast dysfunctions, altered bone formation and osteopenia in F508del-Cftr mice, providing a therapeutic strategy targeting the Krt8-F508del-CFTR interaction to correct the abnormal bone formation and bone loss in cystic fibrosis.

It was recently reported that subjects harboring mutations in the NGLY1 gene exhibited severe systemic symptoms (NGLY1-deficiency). While the enzyme obviously has a critical role in mammals, its precise function remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed Ngly1-deficient mice and found that they are embryonic lethal in C57BL/6 background. Surprisingly, the additional deletion of the gene encoding endo-Î²-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Engase), which is another de-N-glycosylating enzyme but leaves a single GlcNAc at glycosylated Asn residues, resulted in the partial rescue of the lethality of the Ngly1-deficient mice. Additionally, we also found that a change in the genetic background of C57BL/6 mice, produced by crossing the mice with an outbred mouse strain (ICR) could partially rescue the embryonic lethality of Ngly1-deficient mice. Viable Ngly1-deficient mice in a C57BL/6 and ICR mixed background, however, showed a very severe phenotype reminiscent of the symptoms of NGLY1-deficiency subjects. Again, many of those defects were strongly suppressed by the additional deletion of Engase in the C57BL/6 and ICR mixed background. The defects observed in Ngly1/Engase-deficient mice (C57BL/6 background) and Ngly1-deficient mice (C57BL/6 and ICR mixed background) closely resembled some of the symptoms of patients with an NGLY1-deficiency. These observations strongly suggest that the Ngly1- or Ngly1/Engase-deficient mice could serve as a valuable animal model for studies related to the pathogenesis of the NGLY1-deficiency, and that cytoplasmic ENGase represents one of the potential therapeutic targets for this genetic disorder.

Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close after birth is termed patent ductus arteriosus and is one of the most common congenital heart defects. Mice with smooth muscle cell-specific deletion of Jag1, which encodes a Notch ligand, die postnatally from patent ductus arteriosus. These mice exhibit defects in contractile smooth muscle cell differentiation in the vascular wall of the ductus arteriosus and adjacent descending aorta. These defects arise through an inability to propagate the JAG1-Notch signal via lateral induction throughout the width of the vascular wall. Both heterotypic endothelial smooth muscle cell interactions and homotypic vascular smooth muscle cell interactions are required for normal patterning and differentiation of the ductus arteriosus and adjacent descending aorta. This new model for a common congenital heart defect provides novel insights into the genetic programs that underlie ductus arteriosus development and closure.

EGFR activation, the formation of homodimers or heterodimers (with the related ERBB2-4 receptors) and downstream signaling is initiated by the binding of a family of structurally related growth factors, the EGFR ligands. Genetic deletion experiments clarified the biological function of all family members except for the last characterized ligand, epigen. We employed gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells to generate mice lacking epigen expression. Loss of epigen did not affect mouse development, fertility, or organ physiology. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed increased expression of betacellulin and EGF in a few organs of epigen-deficient mice, suggesting a functional compensation by these ligands. In conclusion, we completed the genetic analysis of EGFR ligands and show that epigen has non-essential functions or functions that can be compensated by other EGFR ligands during growth and tissue homeostasis.

Invertebrate CELF is associated with translational control in fruit fly ovary epithelium and with neurogenesis and neuronal function in the nematode. Mammalian CELF4 is expressed widely during early development, but is restricted to the central nervous system in adult. To better understand the etiology of the seizure disorder of Celf4 deficient mice, we studied seizure incidence with spatial and temporal conditional knockout Celf4 alleles. For convulsive seizure phenotypes, it is sufficient to delete Celf4 in adulthood at seven weeks of age. This timing is in contrast to absence-like non-convulsive seizures, which require deletion before the end of the first postnatal week. Interestingly, selective deletion of Celf4 from cerebral cortex and hippocampus excitatory neurons, but not from inhibitory neurons, is sufficient to lower seizure threshold and to promote spontaneous convulsions. Correspondingly, Celf4 deficient mice have altered excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurotransmission as measured by patch-clamp recordings of cortical layer V pyramidal neurons. Finally, immunostaining in conjunction with an inhibitory neuron-specific reporter shows that CELF4 is expressed predominantly in excitatory neurons. Our results suggest that CELF4 plays a specific role in regulating excitatory neurotransmission. We posit that altered excitatory neurotransmission resulting from Celf4 deficiency underlies the complex seizure disorder in Celf4 mutant mice.

Moreover, P-gp is expressed on microglia, the brain's immune cells, which are activated by stressors and have an emerging role in psychiatric disorders. We therefore hypothesised that germline P-gp deletion in mice might alter the behavioral and microglial response to stressors. Female P-gp knockout mice displayed an unusual, frantic anxiety response to intraperitoneal injection stress in the light-dark test. They also tended to display reduced conditioned fear responses compared to wild-type (WT) mice in a paradigm where a single electric foot-shock stressor was paired to a context. Foot-shock stress reduced social interaction and decreased microglia cell density in the amygdala which was not varied by P-gp genotype. Independently of stressor exposure, female P-gp deficient mice displayed increased depression-like behavior, idiosyncratic darting behavior, age-related social withdrawal and hyperactivity, facilitated sensorimotor gating and altered startle reactivity. In addition, P-gp deletion increased microglia cell density in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, and the microglial cells exhibited a reactive, hypo-ramified morphology. Further, female P-gp KO mice displayed increased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in the hippocampus. In conclusion, this research shows that germline P-gp deletion affected various behaviors of relevance to psychiatric conditions, and that altered microglial cell activity and enhanced GR expression in the hippocampus may play a role in mediating these behaviors.

We recently demonstrated that deletion of Keap1, the endogenous inhibitor of Nrf2, in T lymphocytes significantly protects from AKI. In this study, we investigated the effect of Keap1 deletion on Nrf2 mediated antioxidant response in the renal tubular epithelial cells. We deleted Keap1 exon 2 and 3 in the renal tubular epithelial cells by crossing Ksp-Cre mice with Keap1 floxed (Keap1 (f/f)) mice. Deletion of Keap1 gene in the kidney epithelial cells of Ksp-Keap1 (-/-) mice and its effect on Nrf2 target gene expression was performed using PCR and real-time PCR respectively. Histological evaluation was performed on H&E stained sections. Complete blood count, serum and urine analysis were performed to assess systemic effects of defective kidney development. Student's T test was used to determine statistical difference between the groups. Ksp-Cre resulted in the deletion of Keap1 exon 2 and 3 and subsequent upregulation of Nrf2 target genes, Nqo1, Gclm and Gclc in the kidney epithelial cells of Ksp-Keap1 (-/-) mice at baseline. Renal epithelial cell specific deletion of Keap1 in Ksp-Keap1 (-/-) mice caused marked renal pelvic expansion and significant compression of medullary parenchyma consistent with hydronephrosis in both (3Â month-old) males and females. Kidneys from 6Â month-old Ksp-Keap1 (-/-) mice showed progressive hydronephrosis. Hematological, biochemical and urinary analysis showed significantly higher red blood cell count (pâ=â0.04), hemoglobin (pâ=â0.01), hematocrit (pâ=â0.02), mean cell volume (pâ=â0.02) and mean cell hemoglobin concentration (pâ=â0.003) in Ksp-Keap1 (-/-) mice in comparison to Keap1 (f/f) mice.

Fibroblast growth factor 22 (FGF22) is important for specifying excitatory synapses during development, including in the hippocampus. Mice with a genetic deletion of FGF22 (FGF22KO) during development subsequently have fewer hippocampal excitatory synapses in adulthood. As a result, FGF22KO mice are resistant to epileptic seizure induction. In addition to playing a key role in learning, the hippocampus is known to mediate mood and anxiety. Here, we explored whether loss of FGF22 alters affective, anxiety or social cognitive behaviors in mice. We found that relative to control mice, FGF22KO mice display longer duration of floating and decreased latency to float in the forced swim test, increased immobility in the tail suspension test, and decreased preference for sucrose in the sucrose preference test, which are all suggestive of a depressive-like phenotype. No differences were observed between control and FGF22KO mice in other behavioral assays, including motor, anxiety, or social cognitive tests. These results suggest a novel role for FGF22 specifically in affective behaviors. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Type II TRCs contain the calcium channel, calcium homeostasis modulator protein 1 (CALHM1), which releases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) transmitter to taste fibers. We have previously demonstrated with chorda tympani nerve recordings and two-bottle preference (TBP) tests that mice with genetically deleted Calhm1 (knockout [KO]) have severely impaired perception of sweet, bitter, and umami compounds, whereas their sour and salty tasting ability is unaltered. Here, we present data from KO mice of effects on glossopharyngeal (NG) nerve responses, TBP, food intake, body weight, and life span. KO mice have no NG response to sweet and a suppressed response to bitter compared with control (wild-type [WT]) mice. KO mice showed some NG response to umami, suggesting that umami taste involves both CALHM1- and non-CALHM1-modulated signals. NG responses to sour and salty were not significantly different between KO and WT mice. Behavioral data conformed in general with the NG data. Adult KO mice consumed less food, weighed significantly less, and lived almost a year longer than WT mice. Taken together, these data demonstrate that sweet taste majorly influences food intake, body weight, and life span.

Young (8-10 week) Mttp-IKO mice have improved survival when subjected to a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced sepsis. However, 80% of deaths in sepsis occur in patients over age 65. The purpose of this study was to determine whether age impacts outcome in Mttp-IKO mice subjected to sepsis. Aged (20-24 months) Mttp-IKO mice and WT mice underwent intratracheal injection with P. aeruginosa. Mice were either sacrificed 24 hours post-operatively for mechanistic studies or followed seven days for survival. In contrast to young septic Mttp-IKO mice, aged septic Mttp-IKO mice had a significantly higher mortality than aged septic WT mice (80% vs. 39%, pâ=â0.005). Aged septic Mttp-IKO mice exhibited increased gut epithelial apoptosis, increased jejunal Bax/Bcl-2 and Bax/Bcl-XL ratios yet simultaneously demonstrated increased crypt proliferation and villus length. Aged septic Mttp-IKO mice also manifested increased pulmonary myeloperoxidase levels, suggesting increased neutrophil infiltration, as well as decreased systemic TNFÎ± compared to aged septic WT mice. Blocking intestinal chylomicron secretion alters mortality following sepsis in an age-dependent manner. Increases in gut apoptosis and pulmonary neutrophil infiltration, and decreased systemic TNFÎ± represent potential mechanisms for why intestine-specific Mttp deletion is beneficial in young septic mice but harmful in aged mice as each of these parameters are altered differently in young and aged septic WT and Mttp-IKO mice.\n\nWhole-Retina Reduced Electrophysiological Activity in Mice Bearing Retina-Specific Deletion of Vesicular Acetylcholine Transporter.\n\nPubMed\n\nBedore, Jake; Martyn, Amanda C; Li, Anson K C; Dolinar, Eric A; McDonald, Ian S; Coupland, Stuart G; Prado, Vania F; Prado, Marco A; Hill, Kathleen A\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDespite rigorous characterization of the role of acetylcholine in retinal development, long-term effects of its absence as a neurotransmitter are unknown. One of the unanswered questions is how acetylcholine contributes to the functional capacity of mature retinal circuits. The current study investigates the effects of disrupting cholinergic signalling in mice, through deletion of vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) in the developing retina, pigmented epithelium, optic nerve and optic stalk, on electrophysiology and structure of the mature retina. A combination of electroretinography, optical coherence tomography imaging and histological evaluation assessed retinal integrity in mice bearing retina- targeted (embryonic day 12.5) deletion of VAChT (VAChTSix3-Cre-flox/flox) and littermate controls at 5 and 12 months of age. VAChTSix3-Cre-flox/flox mice did not show any gross changes in nuclear layer cellularity or synaptic layer thickness. However, VAChTSix3-Cre-flox/flox mice showed reduced electrophysiological response of the retina to light stimulus under scotopic conditions at 5 and 12 months of age, including reduced a-wave, b-wave, and oscillatory potential (OP) amplitudes and decreased OP peak power and total energy. Reduced a-wave amplitude was proportional to the reduction in b-wave amplitude and not associated with altered a-wave 10%-90% rise time or inner and outer segment thicknesses. This study used a novel genetic model in the first examination of function and structure of the mature mouse retina with disruption of cholinergic signalling. Reduced amplitude across the electroretinogram wave form does not suggest dysfunction in specific retinal cell types and could reflect underlying changes in the retinal and/or extraretinal microenvironment. Our findings suggest that release of acetylcholine by VAChT is essential for the normal electrophysiological response of the mature mouse retina.\n\nIncreased frequency of DNA deletions in pink-eyed unstable mice carrying a mutation in the Werner syndrome gene homologue.\n\nPubMed\n\nLebel, Michel\n\n2002-01-01\n\nWerner syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by genomic instability and the premature onset of a number of age-related diseases, including cancers. Accumulating evidence indicates that the WS gene product is involved in resolving aberrant DNA structures that may arise during the process of DNA replication and/or transcription. To estimate the frequency of DNA deletions directly in the skin of mouse embryos, mice with a deletion of part of the murine WRN helicase domain were created. These mutant mice were then crossed to the pink-eyed unstable animals, which have a 70 kb internal duplication at the pink-eyed dilution (p) gene. This report indicates that the frequency of deletion of the duplicated sequence at the p locus is elevated in mice with a mutation in the WRN allele when compared with wild-type mice. In addition, the inhibitor of topoisomerase I camptothecin also increases the frequency of deletion at the p locus. This frequency is even more elevated in WRN mutant mice treated with camptothecin. In contrast, while the inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity by 3-aminobenzamide increases the frequency of DNA deletion, mutant WRN mice are not significantly more sensitive to the inhibition of PARP activity than wild-type animals.\n\nBoth genetic deletion and pharmacological blockade of lysophosphatidic acid LPA1 receptor results in increased alcohol consumption.\n\nPubMed\n\nCastilla-Ortega, Estela; PavÃ³n, Francisco Javier; SÃ¡nchez-MarÃ­n, Laura; Estivill-TorrÃºs, Guillermo; Pedraza, Carmen; Blanco, Eduardo; SuÃ¡rez, Juan; SantÃ­n, Luis; RodrÃ­guez de Fonseca, Fernando; Serrano, Antonia\n\n2016-04-01\n\nLysophosphatidic acid species (LPA) are lipid bioactive signaling molecules that have been recently implicated in the modulation of emotional and motivational behaviors. The present study investigates the consequences of either genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of lysophosphatidic acid receptor-1 (LPA1) in alcohol consumption. The experiments were performed in alcohol-drinking animals by using LPA1-null mice and administering the LPA1 receptor antagonist Ki16425 in both mice and rats. In the two-bottle free choice paradigm, the LPA1-null mice preferred the alcohol more than their wild-type counterparts. Whereas the male LPA1-null mice displayed this higher preference at all doses tested, the female LPA1-null mice only consumed more alcohol at 6% concentration. The male LPA1-null mice were then further characterized, showing a notably increased ethanol drinking after a deprivation period and a reduced sleep time after acute ethanol administration. In addition, LPA1-null mice were more anxious than the wild-type mice in the elevated plus maze test. For the pharmacological experiments, the acute administration of the antagonist Ki16425 consistently increased ethanol consumption in both wild-type mice and rats; while it did not modulate alcohol drinking in the LPA1-null mice and lacked intrinsic rewarding properties and locomotor effects in a conditioned place preference paradigm. In addition, LPA1-null mice exhibited a marked reduction on the expression of glutamate-transmission-related genes in the prefrontal cortex similar to those described in alcohol-exposed rodents. Results suggest a relevant role for the LPA/LPA1 signaling system in alcoholism. In addition, the LPA1-null mice emerge as a new model for genetic vulnerability to excessive alcohol drinking. The pharmacological manipulation of LPA1 receptor arises as a new target for the study and treatment of alcoholism. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies have suggested a circadian variation in both drug and natural reinforcement, with each following its own time course. The goal of this study was to determine the role of the MT 1 and MT 2 melatonin receptors in palatable snack food-induced reinforcement, as measured by the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm during the light and dark phases. C3H/HeN wild-type mice were trained for snack food-induced CPP at either ZT 6 - 8 (ZT: Zeitgeber time; ZT 0â¯=â¯lights on), when endogenous melatonin levels are low, or ZT 19 - 21, when melatonin levels are high. These time points also correspond to the high and low points for expression of the circadian gene Period1, respectively. The amount of snack food (chow, CheetosÂ®, Froot LoopsÂ® and OreosÂ®) consumed was of similar magnitude at both times, however only C3H/HeN mice conditioned to snack food at ZT 6 - 8 developed a place preference. C3H/HeN mice with a genetic deletion of either the MT 1 (MT 1 KO) or MT 2 (MT 2 KO) receptor tested at ZT 6 - 8 did not develop a place preference for snack food. Although the MT 2 KO mice showed a similar amount of snack food consumed when compared to wild-type mice, the MT 1 KO mice consumed significantly less than either genotype. We conclude that in our mouse model snack food-induced CPP is dependent on time of day and the presence of the MT 1 or MT 2 receptors, suggesting a role for melatonin and its receptors in snack food-induced reinforcement.

Here, to clarify the pathophysiological role of PGIS, we investigated the phenotypes of PGIS and mPGES-1 individual knockout (KO) or double KO (DKO) mice. The results indicate that a thioglycollate-induced exudation of leukocytes into the peritoneal cavity was suppressed by the genetic-deletion of PGIS. In the PGIS KO mice, lipopolysaccharide-primed pain nociception (as assessed by the acetic acid-induced writhing reaction) was also reduced. Both of these reactions were suppressed more effectively in the PGIS/mPGES-1 DKO mice than in the PGIS KO mice. On the other hand, unlike mPGES-1 deficiency (which suppressed azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis), PGIS deficiency up-regulated both aberrant crypt foci formation at the early stage of carcinogenesis and polyp formation at the late stage. These results indicate that PGIS and mPGES-1 cooperatively exacerbate inflammatory reactions but have opposing effects on carcinogenesis, and that PGIS-derived PGI2 has anti-carcinogenic effects.\n\nModeling a model: Mouse genetics, 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome, and disorders of cortical circuit development\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMeechan, Daniel W.; Maynard, Thomas M.; Fernandez, Alejandra; Karpinski, Beverly A.; Rothblat, Lawrence A.; LaMantia, Anthony S.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nUnderstanding the developmental etiology of autistic spectrum disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia remains a major challenge for establishing new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to these common, difficult-to-treat diseases that compromise neural circuits in the cerebral cortex. One aspect of this challenge is the breadth and overlap of ASD, ADHD, and SCZ deficits; another is the complexity of mutations associated with each, and a third is the difficulty of analyzing disrupted development in at-risk or affected human fetuses. The identification of distinct genetic syndromes that include behavioral deficits similar to those in ASD, ADHC and SCZ provides a critical starting point for meeting this challenge. We summarize clinical and behavioral impairments in children and adults with one such genetic syndrome, the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome, routinely called 22q11DS, caused by micro-deletions of between 1.5 and 3.0 MB on human chromosome 22. Among many syndromic features, including cardiovascular and craniofacial anomalies, 22q11DS patients have a high incidence of brain structural, functional, and behavioral deficits that reflect cerebral cortical dysfunction and fall within the spectrum that defines ASD, ADHD, and SCZ. We show that developmental pathogenesis underlying this apparent genetic âmodelâ syndrome in patients can be defined and analyzed mechanistically using genomically accurate mouse models of the deletion that causes 22q11DS. We conclude that âmodeling a modelâ, in this case 22q11DS as a model for idiopathic ASD, ADHD and SCZ, as well as other behavioral disorders like anxiety frequently seen in 22q11DS patients, in genetically engineered mice provides a foundation for understanding the causes and improving diagnosis and therapy for these disorders of cortical circuit development.

It is well documented that GluN2B and ERK1/2 phosphorylation contributes to central sensitization. Striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) dephosphorylates GluN2B and ERK1/2, promoting internalization of GluN2B and inactivation of ERK1/2. The activity of STEP was modulated by genetic (STEP knockout mice) and pharmacological (recently synthesized STEP inhibitor, TC-2153) approaches. STEP61 protein levels in the lumbar spinal cord were determined in male and female mice of different ages. Inflammatory pain was induced by complete Freundâs adjuvant injection. Behavioral tests, immunoblotting, and electrophysiology were used to analyze the effect of STEP on nociception. Our results show that both genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of STEP induced thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, which were accompanied by increased pGluN2BTyr1472 and pERK1/2Thr202/Tyr204 levels in the lumbar spinal cord. Striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase heterozygous and knockout mice presented a similar phenotype. Furthermore, electrophysiological experiments showed that TC-2153 increased C fiber-evoked spinal field potentials. Interestingly, we found that STEP61 protein levels in the lumbar spinal cord inversely correlated with thermal hyperalgesia associated with age and female gender in mice. Consistently, STEP knockout mice failed to show age-related thermal hyperalgesia, although gender-related differences were preserved. Moreover, in a model of inflammatory pain, hyperalgesia was associated with increased phosphorylation-mediated STEP61 inactivation and increased pGluN2BTyr1472 and pERK1/2Thr202/Tyr204 levels in the lumbar spinal cord. Collectively, the present results underscore an important role of spinal STEP activity in the modulation of nociception.

Here, male and female B6C3F1 mice were given single or fractionated whole-body exposure(s) to a monoenergetic carbon ion radiotherapy beam at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba, Japan, matching the radiation quality delivered to the normal tissue ahead of the tumour volume (average linear energy transfer = 13 keV x Î¼m(-1)) during patient radiotherapy protocols. The mice were monitored for the remainder of their lifespan, and a large number of T cell lymphomas that arose in these mice were analysed alongside those arising following an equivalent dose of 137Cs gamma ray-irradiation. Using genome-wide DNA copy number analysis to identify genomic loci involved in radiation-induced lymphomagenesis and subsequent detailed analysis of Notch1, Ikzf1, Pten, Trp53 and Bcl11b genes, we compared the genetic profile of the carbon ion- and gamma ray-induced tumours. The canonical set of genes previously associated with radiation-induced T cell lymphoma was identified in both radiation groups. While the pattern of disruption of the various pathways was somewhat different between the radiation types, most notably Pten mutation frequency and loss of heterozygosity flanking Bcl11b, the most striking finding was the observation of large interstitial deletions at various sites across the genome in carbon ion-induced tumours, which were only seen infrequently in the gamma ray-induced tumours analysed. If such large interstitial chromosomal deletions are a characteristic lesion of carbon ion irradiation, even when using the low linear energy transfer radiation to which normal tissues are exposed in radiotherapy patients, understanding the dose-response and tissue specificity of such DNA damage could prove key to\n\nVIP Gene Deletion in Mice Causes Cardiomyopathy Associated with Upregulation of Heart Failure Genes\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSzema, Anthony M.; Hamidi, Sayyed A.; Smith, S.

Whether the left ventricle is also affected by VIP gene deletion is unknown.

One such oncogene, Musashi-1 ( Msi-1 ), regulates translation of target mRNAs and is implicated in promoting tumorigenesis in the colon and other tissues. Msi-1 targets include the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli ( Apc ), a Wnt pathway antagonist lost in â¼80% of all colorectal cancers. Cell culture experiments have established that Msi-1 is a Wnt target, thus positioning Msi-1 and Apc as mutual antagonists in a mutually repressive feedback loop. Here, we report that intestines from mice lacking Msi-1 display aberrant Apc and Msi-1 mutually repressive feedback, reduced Wnt and Notch signaling, decreased proliferation, and changes in stem cell populations, features predicted to suppress tumorigenesis. Indeed, mice with germline Apc mutations ( Apc Min ) or with the Apc 1322T truncation mutation have a dramatic reduction in intestinal polyp number when Msi-1 is deleted. Taken together, these results provide genetic evidence that Msi-1 contributes to intestinal tumorigenesis driven by Apc loss, and validate the pursuit of Msi-1 inhibitors as chemo-prevention agents to reduce tumor burden.

One such genetic disease is Î²-thalassemia major (Cooley's anemia). This disease is caused by either a point mutation or the deletion of several nucleotides in the Î²-globin gene, and it threatens the lives of millions of people in China. In the present study, we successfully generated iPSCs from fibroblasts collected from a 2-year-old patient who was diagnosed with a homozygous 41/42 deletion in his Î²-globin gene. More importantly, we successfully corrected this genetic mutation in the Î²-thalassemia iPSCs by homologous recombination. Furthermore, transplantation of the genetically corrected iPSCs-derived hematopoietic progenitors into sub-lethally irradiated immune deficient SCID mice showed improved hemoglobin production compared with the uncorrected iPSCs. Moreover, the generation of human Î²-globin could be detected in the mice transplanted with corrected iPSCs-derived hematopietic progenitors. Our study provides strong evidence that iPSCs generated from a patient with a genetic disease can be corrected by homologous recombination and that the corrected iPSCs have potential clinical uses.\n\n16p11.2 Deletion mice display cognitive deficits in touchscreen learning and novelty recognition tasks.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Mu; Lewis, Freeman C; Sarvi, Michael S; Foley, Gillian M; Crawley, Jacqueline N\n\n2015-12-01\n\nChromosomal 16p11.2 deletion syndrome frequently presents with intellectual disabilities, speech delays, and autism. Here we investigated the Dolmetsch line of 16p11.2 heterozygous (+/-) mice on a range of cognitive tasks with different neuroanatomical substrates. Robust novel object recognition deficits were replicated in two cohorts of 16p11.2+/- mice, confirming previous findings. A similarly robust deficit in object location memory was discovered in +/-, indicating impaired spatial novelty recognition. Generalizability of novelty recognition deficits in +/- mice extended to preference for social novelty. Robust learning deficits and cognitive inflexibility were detected using Bussey-Saksida touchscreen operant chambers. During acquisition of pairwise visual discrimination, +/- mice required significantly more training trials to reach criterion than wild-type littermates (+/+), and made more errors and correction errors than +/+. In the reversal phase, all +/+ reached criterion, whereas most +/- failed to reach criterion by the 30-d cutoff. Contextual and cued fear conditioning were normal in +/-. These cognitive phenotypes may be relevant to some aspects of cognitive impairments in humans with 16p11.2 deletion, and support the use of 16p11.2+/- mice as a model system for discovering treatments for cognitive impairments in 16p11.2 deletion syndrome.

The dystrobrevin-binding protein 1 (DTNBP1: dysbindin-1) gene is a major susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Genetic variations in DTNBP1 are associated with cognitive functions, general cognitive ability and memory function, and clinical features of patients with schizophrenia including negative symptoms and cognitive decline. Since reduced expression of dysbindin-1 has been observed in postmortem brains of patients with schizophrenia, the sandy (sdy) mouse, which has a deletion in the Dtnbp1 gene and expresses no dysbindin-1 protein, could be an animal model of schizophrenia. To address this issue, we have carried out a comprehensive behavioral analysis of the sdy mouse in this study. In a rotarod test, sdy mice did not exhibit motor learning whilst the wild type mice did. In a Barnes circular maze test both sdy mice and wild type mice learned to selectively locate the escape hole during the course of the training period and in the probe trial conducted 24 hours after last training. However, sdy mice did not locate the correct hole in the retention probe tests 7 days after the last training trial, whereas wild type mice did, indicating impaired long-term memory retention. A T-maze forced alternation task, a task of working memory, revealed no effect of training in sdy mice despite the obvious effect of training in wild type mice, suggesting a working memory deficit. Sdy mouse showed impaired long-term memory retention and working memory. Since genetic variation in DTNBP1 is associated with both schizophrenia and memory function, and memory function is compromised in patients with schizophrenia, the sdy mouse may represent a useful animal model to investigate the mechanisms of memory dysfunction in the disorder.\n\nImpaired long-term memory retention and working memory in sdy mutant mice with a deletion in Dtnbp1, a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTakao, Keizo; Toyama, Keiko; Nakanishi, Kazuo; Hattori, Satoko; Takamura, Hironori; Takeda, Masatoshi; Miyakawa, Tsuyoshi; Hashimoto, Ryota\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBackground Schizophrenia is a complex genetic disorder caused by multiple genetic and environmental factors.

Inactivity is associated with a loss of muscle mass, which is also reversed with isometric exercise training. The relationship between muscle mass and vascular function is poorly defined. The aims of the current study were to determine whether increasing muscle mass by genetic deletion of myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle growth, can influence vascular function in mesenteric arteries from obese db/db mice. Methods and Results Myostatin expression was elevated in skeletal muscle of obese mice and associated with reduced muscle mass (30% to 50%). Myostatin deletion increased muscle mass in lean (40% to 60%) and obese (80% to 115%) mice through increased muscle fiber size (P<0.05). Myostatin deletion decreased adipose tissue in lean mice, but not obese mice. Markers of insulin resistance and glucose tolerance were improved in obese myostatin knockout mice. Obese mice demonstrated an impaired endothelial vasodilation, compared to lean mice. This impairment was improved by superoxide dismutase mimic Tempol. Deletion of myostatin improved endothelial vasodilation in mesenteric arteries in obese, but not in lean, mice. This improvement was blunted by nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor lâNGânitroarginine methyl ester (lâNAME). Prostacyclin (PGI2)â and endotheliumâderived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)âmediated vasodilation were preserved in obese mice and unaffected by myostatin deletion. Reactive oxygen species) was elevated in the mesenteric endothelium of obese mice and downâregulated by deletion of myostatin in obese mice. Impaired vasodilation in obese mice was improved by NADPH oxidase inhibitor (GKT136901). Treatment with sepiapterin, which increases levels of tetrahydrobiopterin, improved vasodilation in obese mice, an improvement blocked by lâNAME.

Contrary to this understanding of TAK1âs role, we report a mouse model in which TAK1 deletion in the myeloid compartment that evoked a clonal myelomonocytic cell expansion, splenomegaly, multi-organ infiltration, genomic instability, and aggressive, fatal myelomonocytic leukemia. Unlike in previous reports, simultaneous deletion of TNF receptor 1 (TN"
