Liu);\n\nEigenEdge: github\n\nMethods for working with large random data matrices, including\n\nComputing eigenvalue distributions of covariance matrices (general Marchenko-Pastur distributions).\n\nOptimal statistics for testing in principal component analysis.\n\nTools for spiked covariance models: spike and cosine descriptors, optimal shrinkers.\n\npweight : github R. github Matlab\n\nP-value weighting techniques for multiple hypothesis testing. These can improve power in multiple testing, if there is prior information about the individual effect sizes. Includes the iGWAS method for Genome-Wide Association Studies."
