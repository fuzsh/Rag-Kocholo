        "text": "We are witnessing a changing social media environment with new actors, new influencers, and new challenges. Considering the changes on social media platforms, the rise of bots, and the increased participation of state actors, this thematic collection addresses the methodological, topical, and ethical issues of networked influence. The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal opened a new chapter to analyze what “influence” means in our current, complicated social media age. As discussed in the five papers stemming from the 2018 International Conference on Social Media & Society, this special issue introduces a wide array of interdisciplinary topics and approaches that highlight the rapid changes in social media environments, use, and users—with a focus on networked influence; by doing so, we attempt to answer some of the key research questions in this area, such as (1) how to identify and measure influence (broadly defined), (2) how to track propaganda campaigns, (3) how to effectively ...\n\nAbstract-One of the issues to be resolved in social recommender systems is the identification of opinion leaders in a network. Finding effective people in societies has been a key question for many groups; e.g., marketers. The research undertaken in this paper focuses on finding important nodes in a network based on their behaviour as well as the structure of the network. This paper views the propagation of information in a social network as a process of infection. The paper proposes an algorithm called the Probability Propagation Method for measuring the probability of infection of all the nodes in a network starting from a given node in the network. Then, assuming independence in activation of nodes in a network, a method is proposed for ranking nodes according to their capabilities in infecting a larger number of nodes in a network. These methods are validated using simulation software in which a non-deterministic model of information diffusion is simulated on several classes of network. Keywords: Modeling Influence, Social Network, Measuring Influence, Markov Chain Model, Propagation.\n\nIn this paper, we present a methodology both informal community construction and strength of impact between people advance continually, it expects to follow the powerful hubs under a unique setting. To resolve this issue, we investigate the Influential Node Tracking (INT) issue as an expansion to the conventional Influence Maximization issue (IM) under powerful interpersonal organizations. While Influence Maximization issue targets distinguishing a bunch of k hubs to boost the joint impact under one static organization, INT issue centers around following a bunch of persuasive hubs that continues to expand the impact as the organization advances. Using the perfection of the advancement of the organization structure, we propose a productive calculation, Upper Bound Interchange Greedy (UBI) and a variation, UBI+. Rather than developing the seed set from the beginning, begin from the compelling seed set we find beforehand and execute hub substitution to further develop the impact inclusion. Moreover, by utilizing a quick update technique by working out the minor addition of hubs, our calculation can scale to dynamic interpersonal organizations with a huge number of hubs. Exact examinations on three genuine huge scope dynamic informal communities show that our UBI and its variations, UBI+ accomplishes better execution with regards to both impact inclusion and running time."
