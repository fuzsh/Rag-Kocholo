Marble-topped bars, mosaic murals, a helipad-turned-dancefloor and one of the largest swimming pools found on a 255-foot yacht would typically satisfy most owners. Not for Ukrainian businessman and former vice prime minister Valeriy Khoroshkovskyi. He mandated a full-sized martial arts room with a large yellow-and-red interlocking mat floor before taking delivery of his full-custom Amels, Energy, in 2022. What form of martial arts he trains in is anyone’s guess—Combat Hopak, a Cossack martial art from Ukraine, perhaps?—but when he’s not practicing high-flying kicks, the space transforms into an indoor cinema.

With an interior volume of 2,885 GT, Energy has the equivalent gross tonnage of a 295-foot yacht. That abundance of space is felt across the Espen Øino–designed exterior deck areas and throughout the interior penned by Francois Zuretti, with superyacht amenities befitting of the yacht’s $215 million price tag.

The design brief was to defy convention and find ways to connect with the ocean. It’s evident in the sea-level gym with its own terrace, the bright and airy beach club at the stern, and the sweeping ocean views from the helideck. Yet it’s perhaps most successful in the wide sidedecks that double as private guest balconies for the two VIP bedrooms.

Seven cabins accommodate 14 guests, pampered by a crew of 27. That said, Khoroshkovskyi has only “lightly used” his private yacht in the past two years, most likely due to the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. The yacht is now jointly listed for sale with Burgess and Cecil Wright.
