THE UKRAINIAN WEEKLY Published by the Ukrainian Nati<strong>on</strong>al Associati<strong>on</strong> Inc., a fraternal n<strong>on</strong>-profit associati<strong>on</strong> Vol. LXXVII No.12 THE UKRAINIAN WEEKLY SUNDAY, MARCH 22, 2009 Ternopil Oblast Council electi<strong>on</strong>s held despite attempts to derail them by Zen<strong>on</strong> Zawada Kyiv Press Bureau KYIV – In defiance of attempts by Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko to derail the March 15 pre-term electi<strong>on</strong>s to the Ternopil Oblast Council, a majority of eligible voters came to the polls <strong>and</strong> cast the most votes, or 35 percent, for the Svoboda All-Ukrainian Uni<strong>on</strong>, <strong>Ukraine</strong>’s leading nati<strong>on</strong>alist force. Though the electi<strong>on</strong> held minimal c<strong>on</strong>sequences, even <strong>on</strong> a local level, it carried enormous symbolic value, drawing comparis<strong>on</strong>s <strong>with</strong> the 2004 Mukachiv mayoral electi<strong>on</strong> in which the presidential administrati<strong>on</strong> of Le<strong>on</strong>id Kuchma sabotaged the vote as part of a dress rehearsal for the presidential electi<strong>on</strong> that year. The chaos surrounding the Ternopil electi<strong>on</strong>, provoked by the Tymoshenko Bloc, not <strong>on</strong>ly reflected its desperati<strong>on</strong> amidst falling popularity to win at all costs – particularly by trying to cancel the vote just 12 days before it was to take place – but also signified the potential for similar mayhem in the January 17, 2010, presidential electi<strong>on</strong>. “It was a whole series of mistakes for the Tymoshenko Bloc – starting from provoking the electi<strong>on</strong> by blocking the work of the [Ternopil] Oblast Council, <strong>and</strong> then trying to cancel the electi<strong>on</strong> unsuccessfully,” said Volodymyr Fesenko, board chairman of the Penta Center for Applied Political Research in Kyiv, which is financed by political clients. “They stopped the pre-term parliamenta- by Zen<strong>on</strong> Zawada Kyiv Press Bureau KYIV – President Viktor Yushchenko <strong>on</strong> March 17 nominated <strong>Ukraine</strong>’s Ambassador to the U.S. Oleh Shamshur to replace the ousted Volodymyr Ohryzko as <strong>Ukraine</strong>’s foreign affairs minister, rejecting the de facto parliamentary coaliti<strong>on</strong>’s support for Borys Tarasyuk. Just hours after President Yushchenko announced the nominati<strong>on</strong> of Dr. Shamshur, a diplomat who favors <strong>Ukraine</strong>’s Euro-Atlantic integrati<strong>on</strong>, the pro-<strong>Russia</strong>n Party of Regi<strong>on</strong>s of <strong>Ukraine</strong> declared its oppositi<strong>on</strong>. It remained unclear whether Ambassador Shamshur’s nominati<strong>on</strong> would eventually gain the support of the de facto coaliti<strong>on</strong> – c<strong>on</strong>sisting of the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc, the Volodymyr Lytvyn Bloc <strong>and</strong> a slight majority of Our <strong>Ukraine</strong> deputies – which submitted its nominati<strong>on</strong> of Mr. Tarasyuk, who <strong>on</strong>ce held the post, <strong>on</strong> March 6.

Despite denials from the Tymoshenko Bloc of the electi<strong>on</strong>’s legitimacy <strong>and</strong> court decisi<strong>on</strong>s in its favor, most influential instituti<strong>on</strong>s have recognized its results, including the Presidential Secretariat, the Verkhovna Rada, the Party of Regi<strong>on</strong>s <strong>and</strong> the Committee of Voters of <strong>Ukraine</strong>, the coun- (C<strong>on</strong>tinued <strong>on</strong> page 18) “The coaliti<strong>on</strong> deputies are c<strong>on</strong>cerned that Bankova [the presidential administrati<strong>on</strong>] expresses its blatant disrespect to the nati<strong>on</strong>’s highest legislative organ, elected by the Ukrainian people,” said a March 17 coaliti<strong>on</strong> statement, issued after President Yushchenko ignored the nominati<strong>on</strong> of Mr. Tarasyuk <strong>with</strong>out offering an explanati<strong>on</strong>. President Yushchenko is unlikely to nominate Mr. Tarasyuk because he led the majority of the Our <strong>Ukraine</strong> parliamentary facti<strong>on</strong> in breaking allegiance <strong>with</strong> the Presidential Secretariat in December <strong>and</strong> aligning <strong>with</strong> Prime Minister Tymoshenko to form the de facto Coaliti<strong>on</strong> for Nati<strong>on</strong>al Development, Stability <strong>and</strong> Order. The coaliti<strong>on</strong> doesn’t have a majority <strong>and</strong> exists <strong>on</strong>ly because the president still chooses not to enforce his September 2008 decree dismissing Parliament. Meanwhile two days after Ambassador Shamshur’s nomina- PARSIPPANY, N.J. – A bipartisan commissi<strong>on</strong> of experts <strong>on</strong> March 16 released a report recommending that the new U.S. administrati<strong>on</strong> review its relati<strong>on</strong>s <strong>with</strong> <strong>Russia</strong> <strong>and</strong> rec<strong>on</strong>sider its support of NATO membership for <strong>Ukraine</strong> <strong>and</strong> Georgia. The report came a little over two weeks before President Barack Obama prepares to meet <strong>with</strong> <strong>Russia</strong>n President Dmitry Medvedev <strong>on</strong> April 2 in L<strong>on</strong>d<strong>on</strong>, during a summit of the Group of 20 industrialized <strong>and</strong> developing states. Brian Knowlt<strong>on</strong> of The Internati<strong>on</strong>al Herald Tribune wrote <strong>on</strong> March 16 that the commissi<strong>on</strong> recommended the Obama administrati<strong>on</strong> “reach out to <strong>Russia</strong> in a number of ways, putting NATO membership for Georgia <strong>and</strong> <strong>Ukraine</strong> <strong>on</strong> hold <strong>and</strong> taking ‘a new look’ at the planned missile shield in Eastern Europe, possibly even collaborating <strong>with</strong> Moscow <strong>on</strong> it.” Not ready for NATO Significantly, the report recommended that the Obama administrati<strong>on</strong> should “accept that neither <strong>Ukraine</strong> nor Georgia is ready for NATO membership” but that it should also work <strong>with</strong> NATO allies to find other ways “to dem<strong>on</strong>strate a commitment to their sovereignty.” It said the U.S. does not now have “a compelling security interest” in NATO membership for either country. The 30-page report was pepared by a panel headed by two former senators, Yushchenko nominates Shamshur as foreign affairs minister (C<strong>on</strong>tinued <strong>on</strong> page 19) $1/$2 in <strong>Ukraine</strong> <str<strong>on</strong>g>Experts</str<strong>on</strong>g> <str<strong>on</strong>g>focus</str<strong>on</strong>g> <strong>on</strong> U.S. relati<strong>on</strong>s <strong>with</strong> <strong>Russia</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Ukraine</strong> Yaro Bihun Gary Hart (D-Colo.) <strong>and</strong> Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.). Members of the panel include: Brent Scowcroft, nati<strong>on</strong>al security adviser to Presidents Gerald Ford <strong>and</strong> George H.W. Bush; Robert C. McFarlane, nati<strong>on</strong>al security adviser to President R<strong>on</strong>ald Reagan; former Sen. Sam Nunn, a Democrat; <strong>and</strong> Lee H. Hamilt<strong>on</strong>, a Democrat <strong>and</strong> former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “Engaging <strong>Ukraine</strong>” At about the same time, the Brookings Instituti<strong>on</strong> issued a report titled “Engaging <strong>Ukraine</strong> in 2009.” Its authors are: Steven Pifer, visiting fellow in foreign policy at Brookings’ Center <strong>on</strong> the United States <strong>and</strong> Europe; Anders Åslund, senior fellow, Peters<strong>on</strong> Institute for Internati<strong>on</strong>al Ec<strong>on</strong>omics; <strong>and</strong> J<strong>on</strong>athan Elkind, n<strong>on</strong>resident senior fellow <strong>on</strong> energy security issues at Brookings. Mr. Pifer is also a former U.S. ambassador to <strong>Ukraine</strong>. Dr. Aslund has served as an ec<strong>on</strong>omic advisor to the government of <strong>Ukraine</strong> in 1994-1997 <strong>and</strong> has written extensively about <strong>Ukraine</strong>. The policy paper – No. 13 in the Foreign Policy Paper Series – was presented <strong>on</strong> March 17 at the Washingt<strong>on</strong>based public policy organizati<strong>on</strong>. In its introducti<strong>on</strong> <strong>and</strong> summary, the paper notes: “<strong>Ukraine</strong> <strong>and</strong> Ukrainians will be tested over the course of 2009. The global financial <strong>and</strong> ec<strong>on</strong>omic crisis already has provoked a deep recessi<strong>on</strong> <strong>and</strong> falling living st<strong>and</strong>ards. Kyiv will need to make a real effort to strike a balance between integrati<strong>on</strong> into Europe <strong>and</strong> the Euro-Atlantic community <strong>and</strong> maintaining stable relati<strong>on</strong>s <strong>with</strong> <strong>Russia</strong>. Doing so will not be easy, as <strong>Russia</strong> regards <strong>Ukraine</strong>’s pro-Western policy as inimical to <strong>Russia</strong>n interests, <strong>and</strong> <strong>Ukraine</strong>’s politics are subject to influence from Moscow. In particular, <strong>Ukraine</strong> must address its energy security situati<strong>on</strong>, where it remains vulnerable to <strong>Russia</strong>n pressure.” The paper points out that “<strong>Ukraine</strong> is the most democratic state in the post- Soviet space, <strong>and</strong> its domestic debate is vibrant <strong>and</strong> open, but its politics are highly dysfuncti<strong>on</strong>al.” It goes <strong>on</strong> to urge the Obama administrati<strong>on</strong> to resist the temptati<strong>on</strong> “to wait for the leadership in Kyiv to get its act together, given how divided it is,” adding “Washingt<strong>on</strong> does not have the luxury of waiting; absent str<strong>on</strong>g U.S. engagement, the situati<strong>on</strong> in <strong>Ukraine</strong> will likely worsen <strong>and</strong> require greater American attenti<strong>on</strong> at a future point.” The paper’s authors write that “Washingt<strong>on</strong> should <str<strong>on</strong>g>focus</str<strong>on</strong>g> <strong>on</strong> four areas.” Following are excerpts of the report’s outline of those areas. • Structure a bilateral dialogue to have maximum influence <strong>with</strong> <strong>Ukraine</strong>’s lead- Ambassador Oleh Shamshuk, President Viktor Yushchenko’s nominee for minister of foreign affairs.
