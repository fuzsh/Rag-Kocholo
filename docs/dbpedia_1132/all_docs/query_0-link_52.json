On 22 February 2014 the channel normal programming was replaced, amid rumours of a possible attack or arson on its headquarters, by live broadcast of Parliamentary sessions. On 22 February 2014, as a part of the \"Maidan revolution\", President Viktor Yanukovych (the one the 16 journalist had complained about being forced to make propaganda for) was removed from office.\n\nEarly September 2016 the Inter studios where attacked and then blockaded for three days by volunteer battalion Saint Mary who accused it of being to pro-Russian amidst a Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCriticism\n\n\"Inter\" TV channel informational policy repeatedly caused negative reaction of society. There even was created a Facebook group \"Inter to ignoration\" (Ukrainian: «Інтер в ігнор»). Also Euromaidan activists have called for boycott of this TV channel and asked its employees not to lie in air. Censorship on \"Inter\" was reported earlier.\n\nRussian and Russian-language broadcasting content\n\nSince 2014 \"Inter\" was criticised for the broadcasting of Russian serials. According to results of monitoring made by \"Boycott russian cinema\" activists, in September \"Inter\" took 3rd place among top-10 nationwide TV-channels which demonstrate Russian films and serials. During the period from 8th to 14 September Russian content lasted in average 11 hours and 15 minutes per day. According to monitoring data of 27 September Russian content took already 67% on this channel.\n\nOn December 11, 2014 \"Boycott Russian Films\" activists were picketing \"Inter\" main office in Kyiv. During the action named \"Do not kill our protectors by Russian propaganda!\" young people placed photos of Ukrainian soldiers, killed during the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, on the main entrance. Activists claimed that \"Inter\" takes second place among TV channels concerning the amount of Russian origin content. Protesters announced that Russian films and serials on \"Inter\" glorify Russian armed forces, which is unacceptable during the war.\n\nAccording to monitoring results held from 1 to 7 December the amount of Russian origin content has increased up to 13 hours and 15 minutes per day.\n\nScandal on New Year's night TV shows\n\nFrom December 31, 2014 to January 1, 2015 during celebration of the New Year this channel broadcast New Year show \"Wait for me in the New Year\" (Russian: «Жди меня в Новый год») with Russian stars which have supported occupation of Crimea by Russia (Joseph Kobzon, Oleg Gazmanov, Valeriya, etc.). This event immediately caused a burst of resentment in Ukrainian blogosphere and social network. On January 1, a number of Ukrainian high-ranked officials, politicians and cultural workers reacted. Particularly, the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Oleksandr Turchynov announced that National Council of Television and Radio of Ukraine must consider about cancellation of channel's licence immediately. In the evening the news programm of the channel \"Podrobnosti\" publicly dissociated from New Year shows with Russian stars participating, and announced that the timetable of TV programms was changed incorrectly.\n\nMember of expert commission on distributing and showing films Serhiy Osnach claims that \"Inter\" violates regulation about compulsory 50% of Ukrainian content (article 9 of Law Of Ukraine \"About television and radiobroadcasting\"). From December 5 to 11, 2015 activists of \"Boycott Russian Films\" campaign have made a monitoring, results of which confirmed what expert said. Activists calculated that there is 17% of Ukrainian content on \"Inter\".\n\nOn January 15, 2015 National Council for Radio and Television of Ukraine gave a warning to \"Inter\" for program broadcasting."
