Good job for a complex issue. There\n\nare some additions that need to be made.\n\nAlso, there are a few places that need a scrub for bias. It is a natural\n\nbias of the pro-western Ukrainians you've been speaking to. Oh,\n\nUkrainians. Something to be mindful of now in training before you go.\n\n*The following is a compilation of my month-long project on Ukraine.\n\nEverything here is my summary/analysis of Ukraine's economic situation,\n\nincluding its relationship with Russia vs.EU, prospects for EU free trade\n\nagreement vs. customs, how Ukrainian oligarchs fit into this, and how\n\nenergy fits into this. I have also included a compilation of insight from\n\nmultiple sources that was useful for this deep dive, as well as a\n\nproto-bibliography on articles and in-depth reports I used for this\n\nresearch in case I need to go back for reference. I can formally present\n\nthis to the Eurasia team once Rodger is back and then we can talk about\n\nwhat we want to do with this in terms of publication for the future. I'm\n\nalso open to re-organizing this if needed since this is the first official\n\n1 month medium term project I have completed.\n\n--\n\nDiscussion:\n\nUkraine has become the center of a growing economic competition between\n\nRussia and the EU. As the country is being contested to join into a free\n\ntrade agreement with the EU on the one hand and a customs union with\n\nRussia on the other, a choice in either direction could significantly\n\nchange the balance of power (both economically and politically) in the\n\ncountry, an event that would have important regional implications. The\n\nfollowing is a dive into why Ukraine is important, the structure and\n\nimperatives of the Ukrainian economy, how this fits into the competition\n\nbtwn Russia and EU, and how this competition is likely to play out.\n\nWhy Ukraine is important economically\n\no Ukraine is the second largest economy in former Soviet Union and has\n\nthe second largest population, trailing only Russia in both categories\n\no Ukraine's economic important derives from its resources, as it is both\n\na major industrial and agricultural producer and exporter\n\no It is also important as a transit country, serving as a key energy hub\n\nfrom Russia to Europe\n\nCurrent state of Ukrainian economy/industry\n\no As mentioned, Ukraine is a resource producing country, and these\n\nresources (particularly heavy industry like steel, metals, chemicals)\n\nand agriculture is what drives their economy (but what is the state?)\n\no The country was hit hard by the global financial crisis, seeing double\n\ndigit contractions in GDP in 2009 how did it hit industry and ag?\n\no Now as global economy is recovering (albeit slowly), so is Ukrainian\n\nindustry and exports - GDP growth is expected to be 4-4.5% in 2011\n\nUkraine's #1 goal is macroeconomic stability and growth (every country has\n\nthis goal... instead, plug this into the geopol or pol)\n\no The way to achieve this goal is to have a good working relationship\n\nwith IMF, while balancing the relationship between EU and Russia to\n\nits advantage for economic gain not necessarily...can grow and be\n\nstable without EU or IMF or Russia... just not all 3... Ukr has to\n\nchoose or attempt a balance that is untenable\n\no Belarus is an example of what not to do - has isolated itself\n\npolitically and economically from the EU (and likely the IMF as well)\n\nwhile leaving itself vulnerable to Russia's economic designs\n\n(privatization program) for financial aid which has limited its\n\nautonomy the question is, is this a bad thing? (see it from all POVs)\n\no Therefore for Ukraine to preserve its autonomy, it is important to\n\nkeep its financial (IMF) and trade (EU and Russia) options open and\n\nplay them off to its own advantage good Ukr POV\n\nOn the first strategy (IMF), Ukraine has been relatively successful\n\no While the previous administration under Yushchenko was so fractured\n\npolitically that the IMF suspended its dealings with Ukraine on the\n\n$15 billion loan program that began in Jul 2010, Yanukovich has been\n\nable to consolidate the government and has re-started cooperation with\n\nthe IMF\n\no Talks are ongoing, and the IMF has praised Ukraine for its work on\n\nmaintaining health levels of budget deficit, forex, etc\n\no It is expected that Ukraine will begin to receive new disbursements\n\nbefore the end of the year to facilitate their macroeconomic stability\n\no However, there are still some uneasy and contentious reforms\n\nassociated with the program, such as raising household gas prices,\n\nwhich is politically an unpopular move for Yanukovich this is\n\nimportant and deserves more focus up in the \"state of econ\" section\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Ukraine - cite_note-34\n\nOn the second strategy (balance btwn Russia and EU), Ukraine has been\n\nsuccessful so far\n\no Up to this point, Ukraine's trade relationship with the EU and Russia\n\nhas been relatively balanced, and this is clearly reflected\n\nstatistically:\n\no Of Ukraine's exports - 25% went to EU, while 26% went to Russia (along\n\nwith another 6% to Belarus and Kazakhstan).\n\no Imports are slightly more in favor of Russia, as Ukraine imported 43%\n\nof its goods from Russia, compared to 37% from the EU.\n\no However, When breaking down Ukrainian imports and exports into\n\ncomponents, it becomes clear that the trade relationship between\n\nUkraine and Russia and Ukraine and EU are different in nature.\n\no Ukraine's relationship with Russia is dominated by\n\nsteel/machinery/industrial inputs exported to Russia, while energy is\n\nthe main commodity imported from Russia also important to dive into\n\nwhy the steel is exported to Russia... bc it is SUPER shitty... no one\n\nelse will take it.\n\no Meanwhile, Ukraine exported oil and gas (via transit) to EU along with\n\nsome steel and metals, while it imported mainly machinery and vehicles\n\nfrom EU\n\no This makes Ukr's economy look terrible. It is an energy transiter\n\n(reliant on someone else), it is a steel/industrial exporter\n\n(uncompetitive in the Continent and even really in Russia..... man,\n\nthey are bad off as far as a real econ base... they're nearly hallow.\n\no Need to add agriculture (and maybe fertilizer)... this could be the\n\nmore important sector\n\nBut things are starting to change and the competition over Ukraine is\n\nheating up\n\no Both the EU and Russia are currently looking for Ukraine to further\n\nintegrate into their respective economic blocs at the expense of the\n\nother, the former via a free trade agreement with the EU and the\n\nlatter via the Russia-Belarus-Kazakhstan customs union\n\no Ukraine has taken a careful approach in this, though it has repeatedly\n\nsaid the country's priority is the EU free trade agreement, taking a\n\nmore nuanced approach to the customs union by saying it would be\n\ninterested in joining into some relationship with the CU, but one that\n\nfalls short of full membership\n\nSo then which bloc serves Ukrainian interests?\n\no The general consensus is that the EU FTA is the more beneficial\n\nrelationship economically for Ukraine, as the EU is a larger and more\n\ndynamic market than Russia and a removal of duties on EU imports to\n\nUkraine would raise more cash for Ukraine (agree with this for the\n\nmost part... but there is still a lot of Rus-Ukr integration\n\neconomically, so maybe not...)\n\no Ukraine doesn't want to join the Customs Union, knowing it is a bloc\n\ndesigned to integrate economic systems to that of Russia. Ukraine\n\nsimply has too important of an economic relationship with the EU to\n\nre-orient its economy overwhelmingly toward Russia (this dynamic makes\n\nit different from Belarus and Kazakhstan). This is a bias\n\nbullet-revise.\n\no Many (largely from the west or pro-western side) argue that the short\n\nterm pain is worth it for the long term gain, saying that the opposite\n\nis true for Russia (short term gain vs. long term gain) no idea what\n\nyou are saying in this bullet\n\nBut the reality is more complicated:\n\no Many Ukrainian goods - particularly heavy industry which makes up a\n\nmajority of their major exports (and more specifically steel, which is\n\nabout 45% of total exports) - would be far less competitive when\n\nsubject to competition from EU countries\n\no There are also entrenched interests from the oligarch class in\n\nUkraine, many of which have complex ties to Russia, that are against\n\nthe creation of a FTA with the EU. Need to go into this economically\n\non top of your political points... the olis economically would benefit\n\nfrom the R agreement. This is complicated further by the fact that\n\nYanukovich's political stability (and perhaps survival) is dependent\n\non support from these oligarchs.\n\no Perhaps more importantly, there is the Russia factor - further\n\norienting its economy towards the EU leaves Ukraine subject to\n\neconomic and political responses/manipulation from Russia. Russia has\n\nexplicitly threatened economic retaliation against Ukraine were it to\n\njoin the EU fta, such as raising export duties on Ukrainian goods,\n\nwhich could severely damage Ukraine's macroeconomic stability (as seen\n\nwith Belarus). Also, Russia has proven that it can back up its threats\n\nbefore from multiple pipeline cutoffs to Ukraine during the Orange era\n\n(a threat that will be even more poignant when Nord Stream will come\n\nonline and replace a significant part of Ukraine's role as an energy\n\ntransit state).\n\no But Russia hasn't only leveraged threats against Ukraine, it has also\n\noffered carrots as well - According to insight we received a while\n\nback, Putin offered Ukraine a compensation package - one that includes\n\nmore than just financial incentives - to remind Ukraine of the\n\nbenefits of working with Russia and the consequences involved in going\n\nwith the Europeans\n\nNeed to go into how Russia really doesn't want Ukraine in CU. That it\n\nwould be a purely political move. That Russia wants a thriving econ in Ukr\n\n& why. There is a logic to Russia letting Ukr into EU pact... but only if\n\npol guarantee is in place.\n\nSo then what will Ukraine do?\n\no Ukraine is well aware of all these dynamics, and therefore if it were\n\nto join the EU fta, this would be a calculated risk\n\no Logically, Ukraine's imperative remains to balance both economic\n\nrelationships by advocating strengthening these relationships while\n\nnot fully integrating with either Russia or EU, knowing the risks\n\ninvolved with such a move\n\no However, at least officially, Ukraine is committed to completing free\n\ntrade talks with the EU before the end of the year. This could just be\n\nrhetoric in order to give itself room to manuever and Ukraine could\n\nfind reason to stall these negotiations. Or Ukraine could actually be\n\nserious about this, which according to most media and experts (and the\n\ngovernment itself), it is. So is this all a bluff or am I missing\n\nsomething here in the logic? Missing the logic of political vs.\n\neconomic guarantees with Russia.\n\n--\n\nFollow up questions to discussion:\n\nis FTA beneficial for Russia?\n\nOnly in case of EU-Russia FTA:\n\nClearly, closer trade integration between Russia and the EU would relieve\n\nUkraine from having to make a difficult choice with respect to the\n\ndirection of integration. For instance, should Russia and the EU enter a\n\nfree trade agreement, the possibility of which is envisaged in the current\n\nEU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), Ukraine's\n\nparticipation in both DCFTA and CU could become perfectly feasible. Of\n\ncourse, for that to become possible, a number of difficult problems would\n\nhave to be solved. First, in order to start free trade negotiations with\n\nthe EU, Russia will need to join the WTO first, although this target\n\nappears now realistic. Second, a free trade agreement with Russia would\n\nrequire also free trade with both Kazakhstan and Belarus, which in the\n\nlatter case appears particularly problematic, primarily (but not only) for\n\npolitical reasons. (this seems out of place in this discussion)\n\ntechnical/exceptions to FTA?\n\nIn fact, the preliminary EU-Ukraine DCFTA agreement envisages no import\n\nduties on the Ukrainian side, with the exception of the automotive\n\nindustry (and potentially agricultural products).\n\nImpact on naftogaz/gazprom talks?\n\nRussia has said it would be open to lowering gas price, but only in\n\nexchange for a Naftogaz/Gazprom merger so what is the impact on your\n\ndiscussion above?\n\n--\n\nOligarchs:\n\n*this section is more of a compilation than my analysis, with still some\n\nthings to weed through - comments welcome\n\nWhat is the role of Ukrainian oligarchs before/after Yanukovich?\n\nBefore\n\no Wealthy businessmen started gaining influence in the mid-to-late\n\n1990s, playing an important political role during the presidency of\n\nLeonid Kuchma. Although they were influential, Kuchma managed to keep\n\nthem under his control, guaranteeing the dominance-if only fragile-of\n\nnational interests over corporate ones. When Viktor Yuschenko came to\n\npower in 2005, however, he brought another group of big businessmen\n\ncloser to the circles of power, giving them access to assets earlier\n\ncontrolled by Kuchma's oligarchs.\n\nAfter\n\no In the first presidential election since Mr Yushchenko's Orange\n\nRevolution triumph ?? in 2004, the biggest beneficiary of billionaire\n\nbacking is Mr Yanukovich, the opposition leader then defeated by Mr\n\nYushchenko but now the clear frontrunner.\n\no He is supported by Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's richest man and president\n\nof Shaktar Donetsk, Ukraine's second most successful football club.\n\nBoth men hail from the east Ukraine steel belt, where Mr Yanukovich\n\nlaunched his career and Mr Akhmetov founded his fortune. His other\n\nbusiness backers include Dmitry Firtash, the gas trading billionaire,\n\nfor whom the election is particularly important.\n\no The greatest concentration of wealth lies within the Party of Regions.\n\nThis in itself is ironic, because the Party of Regions, like the\n\nUnified Russia party, has attracted a large proportion of former\n\ncommunist voters (in R, there is still a strong CP). Of the $112\n\nbillion total assets of Ukraine's 50 wealthiest, $35.4 billion or a\n\nthird of the total is held by members of the Party of Regions.\n\no Yanukovych has taken five steps to remove obstacles to the\n\nmonopolization of power. The first to go were parliament, which has\n\nbecome a rubber stamp institution, followed by television whose\n\noligarch owners rushed to prove their loyalty to the new regime. The\n\nthird, on October 1, was Ukraine's return to a presidential\n\nconstitution and a month later the Party of Regions won a majority in\n\nlocal councils in a bitterly contested election.\n\no While the older oligarchs maintained their position at the top, the\n\nappearance of new players began disrupting their monopolies. Under\n\nYanukovych, the older interest groups and some newer people close to\n\nhim are trying to reverse the Yuschenko-era developments, and to\n\nensure that their interests are not subject to the oversight of a\n\nrelatively strong president. In today's Ukraine the corporate\n\ninterests of a limited number of oligarchs prevail\n\no Kostyantyn Zhevaho is one of the last representatives of big business\n\nwho has not left [the opposition] faction of the Yuliya Tymoshenko\n\nBloc in parliament. All five businessmen made their profits mostly\n\nfrom metallurgy.\n\no But what is the state of the olis after?\n\nWhat is Yanukovich's relationship with the oligarchs?\n\no So far Yanukovich is balancing between two oligarchic groups - the\n\nso-called RosUkrEnergo group and the Donetsk clan. The big question is\n\nwhether he will continue to do so, or oust the oligarchs to build his\n\nown power hierarchy.\n\no The Ukrainian government has just been changed and slimmed down. In\n\nterms of structure, this makes much more sense. The balance between\n\nthe RosUkrEnergo camp (billionaire co-owner Dmytro Firtash, Energy\n\nMinister Yuri Boiko, presidential chief of staff Serhiy Lyovochkin and\n\nSecurity Service of Ukraine chief Valeriy Khoroshkovskiy) and the\n\nDonetsk group (wealthy and influential businessmen Rinat Akhmetov,\n\nAndriy Kliuev and Boris Kolesnikov) appears to be maintained, while\n\nSpeaker Volodymyr Lytvyn, socialist and Communist Party cronies are\n\ngone.\n\no The biggest question is whether Yanukovych will continue to balance\n\nthe big Ukrainian businessmen close to him who currently dominate his\n\ngovernment or whether he will take them out.\n\nOthers analysis:\n\no Akhmetov, who accumulated his business empire when Yanukovych was\n\nDonetsk governor in 1997-2002, has been sidelined from the\n\npresidential administration and Nikolai Azarov's government.\n\nMeanwhile, the influence of Firtash, the country's only Western\n\nUkrainian oligarch, has grown in both institutions.\n\no Boyko and Firtash have long-standing ties to the energy sector\n\ntogether with Levochkin and Security Service Chairman, Valeriy\n\nKhoroshkovsky. Khoroshkovsky and Firtash played a strategic role in\n\nYanukovych's election through their control of Inter, Ukraine's most\n\npopular television channel.\n\no In addition to the marginalization of Akhmetov, other oligarchs who\n\naligned with Viktor Yushchenko (Igor Kolomoysky) or Tymoshenko (Sergei\n\nTaruta, Vitaliy Haidiuk, and Konstantin Zhevago) have lost out.\n\nKolomoysky, often depicted in terms of business practices as Ukraine's\n\nmost odious oligarch, is in de facto exile in Geneva as he is seen as\n\nthe first likely casualty of a Putin-style attack on the oligarchs.\n\no Established in 2001, the Party of Regions has never been a uniform\n\nbody. Since its beginning, various industrial and territorial groups\n\nhave been vying for influence within the Party. Over time, new groups\n\nhave joined the struggle, including the powerful bureaucratic lobby\n\nand the influential Russophile intelligentsia circles. The arrangement\n\nof these groups and communities is fluid. Currently the most important\n\ncamps are those surrounding Rinat Akhmetov, Dmytro Firtash and Viktor\n\nYanukovych.\n\no Rinat Akhmetov is a major entrepreneur and an influential member of\n\nthe Party of Regions. He owns the SCM holding, one of Ukraine's\n\nbiggest business groups, and represents the Donetsk region, the\n\nmetallurgic industry, and to an extent the energy sector. Akhmetov is\n\ninterested in Ukraine entering the global markets, also as a\n\ncompetitor of the Russian economy. Even though he is a member of\n\nparliament, he does not publicly participate in politics though he\n\ndoes influence it.\n\no Akhmetov's main representative in the Azarov cabinet is Borys\n\nKolesnikov, formally the deputy PM in charge of preparations to the\n\nEURO 2012 football championship, and in reality, the person in charge\n\nof securing Akhmetov's interests. Andriy Kluyev, who aspires to\n\ncontrol the electricity sector in Ukraine and who is supposed to check\n\nthe influence of the energy minister Yuriy Boyko, also represents\n\nAkhmetov. In total, Akhmetov has eight representatives in the new\n\ngovernment, including three deputy prime ministers and one permanent\n\npresidential representative to the government (a very important\n\nfunction in the Ukrainian political system), Iryna Akimova; she is\n\nalso the first deputy of the Presidential Administration chief Serhiy\n\nLovochkin, and represents Akhmetov's interests in this body.\n\no Dmytro Firtash is not a member of the Party of Regions, but has a\n\ngroup of his supporters in the Party. A co-owner of RosUkrEnergo with\n\ndual (Ukrainian and Hungarian) citizenship, Firtash is mainly\n\ninterested in untransparent trade in Russian natural gas, and\n\ncurrently hopes to regain the positions he lost in 2009 in the\n\naftermath of the agreement between Vladimir Putin and Yulia\n\nTymoshenko, which eliminated intermediaries from the gas trade. He\n\nheld a major sway in President Yushchenko's circle (according to some\n\nsources, the president's brother Petro was one of his business\n\npartners).\n\no Firtash is present in politics through his representatives; the most\n\nimportant ones currently are the head of the Presidential\n\nAdministration Serhiy Lovochkin (who is also closely associated with\n\nYanukovych and the former president Leonid Kuchma) and Firtash's\n\nbusiness partner Yuriy Boyko (the energy minister) whom Firtash failed\n\nto have appointed as a deputy prime minister. Firtash also has\n\ninfluence over Valeriy Khoroshkovsky, a major entrepreneur and the new\n\nhead of the Security Service of Ukraine. In total, he has three\n\nrepresentatives in the government.\n\no The group surrounding Viktor Yanukovych consists mainly of members of\n\nthe state bureaucracy, as well as representatives of the Luhansk\n\nDistrict (the north-eastern part of the Donbas, whose elite has been\n\ncontinually struggling against the hegemonic ambitions of the Donetsk\n\ngroup). The Luhansk group includes deputy PM Viktor Tikhonov and the\n\nnew head of the Party of Regions parliamentary group Oleksandr\n\nYefremov. Some parts of the Russophile intelligentsia, represented in\n\nthe government by the (Kyiv-born) education minister Dmytro Tabachnyk,\n\nhave also been gravitating towards Yanukovych. Tabachnyk's influence\n\nin the group will be counterbalanced by the deputy head of the\n\nPresidential Administration Anna Herman, who is an advocate of balance\n\nbetween the Ukrainian and Russian-speaking components of Ukraine's\n\nsocial life.\n\nWhat is the relationship amongst Ukrainian oligarchs?\n\no Ukraine's oligarchs were never united as a group. Following\n\nYushchenko's election, they openly supported the orange camp.\n\no Pinchuk (Interpipe) and Kolomoysky (Pryvat) are Ukraine's second and\n\nthird wealthiest citizens but with far less wealth than Akhmetov, at\n\n$8.8 and $6.6 billion, respectively. Both have continued to fund\n\npolitical projects externally: Pinchuk in Viche and Kolomoysky in Our\n\nUkraine. Three Pryvat oligarchs in third, fourth and sixth places\n\ncontrol $17.7 billion.\n\no Other oligarchs also supported the orange camp. Petro Poroshenko\n\n($1.12 billion [22nd place]) was an ally of Yushchenko from 2001 when\n\nOur Ukraine was formed, and his Channel 5 was one of only two\n\ntelevision stations that gave coverage to the 2004 Yushchenko election\n\ncampaign. Kyiv Mayor Leonid Chernovetsky ($750 million [28th place])\n\nbacked Yushchenko in 2004 and has remained an ally.\n\no The former head of the 2004 Yanukovych campaign, Serhiy Tyhipko ($1.64\n\nbillion [17th place], who, like Pinchuk, left politics after the\n\norange revolution, has returned as head of the Tymoshenko government's\n\nCouncil on Investors. Another Pinchuk protege, Valeriy Khoroshkovskyi\n\n($1.55 billion [18th place]), is head of the State Customs.\n\no Meanwhile, Industrial Union of Donbas (ISD) oligarchs Serhiy Taruta\n\nand Vitaliy Haydiuk (worth $2.37 billion each [11th and 12th]) are\n\naligned with the Tymoshenko government. Konstantyn Zhevago ($5.2\n\nbillion [fifth]), the first and only Ukrainian businessman to float\n\nshares on the London Stock Exchange for his Ferrexpo company, is a\n\nTymoshenko bloc parliamentary deputy.\n\no A central figure contributing to ending Yanukovych's honeymoon with\n\nthe West (what does this mean?) is the Ukrainian Security Service\n\n(SBU) Chairman, Valery Khoroshkovsky. It is, therefore, surprising\n\nthat his protege, oligarch and Leonid Kuchma's son-in-law, Viktor\n\nPinchuk, a trailblazer in seeking to lobby a new and improved\n\ninternational image for himself, has remained silent. Khoroshkovsky\n\nwas propelled into Ukrainian politics in 2002 as a leader of the KOP\n\n(Winter Crop Generation) political party that Pinchuk funded as a\n\nrival to Viktor Yushchenko's Our Ukraine. I don't understand this\n\nbullet.\n\no In addition to Pinchuk, Khoroshkovsky is also tied to Dmytro Firtash\n\nthrough media interests in Inter, Ukraine's most popular television\n\nchannel, and seven regional channels. Inter, which is the dominant\n\nchannel in Russophone Eastern-Southern Ukraine, played a vital role in\n\nmobilising votes for Yanukovych in this year's presidential elections.\n\nFirtash, unlike Pinchuk, has no political ambitions beyond aligning\n\nwith Ukrainian politicians who do not intervene in his business\n\ninterests, particularly gas. Firtash has never run for parliament,\n\nunlike Pinchuk who did so in 1998 and 2002.\n\no Pinchuk, Firtash and other Ukrainian oligarchs would not wish to see a\n\nRussian-style authoritarian regime introduced into Ukraine as it would\n\nbe unpredictable in its relations with big business and would\n\nundermine European integration. Double check this... I think Pinchuk\n\nand Firtash have assets integrated into Russia... if so, then this\n\nassertion needs revising. Ukraine's oligarchs not all of them -\n\nrevise see as more important Kyiv signing a Free Trade Zone (FTZ) with\n\nthe EU over the amorphous CIS Single Economic Space. Nevertheless,\n\nUkrainian oligarchs have not followed some of their Russian\n\ncounterparts (Mikhail Khoroshkovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, and the more\n\ncontroversial Boris Berezovsky) in opposing authoritarianism, after\n\nVladimir Putin was first elected in 2000. Some Ukrainian oligarchs,\n\nsuch as Khoroshkovsky and Igor Kolomoysky, owner of 1+1 channel, have\n\nbeen accused by journalists of assisting in dismantling democratic\n\ngains by introducing censorship.

Russian Prime\n\nMinister, Vladimir Putin, chairs Vneshekonombank that purchased\n\nUkraine's Prominvestbank last year.\n\no Akhmetov sent a signal through his vote for parliament's establishment\n\nof an investigation commission into the RUE gas intermediary. The\n\ndecision by the Stockholm Arbitration Court in June against the\n\nTymoshenko government's confiscation of RUE gas ruled that Firtash/RUE\n\nshould receive $3.7 billion plus $600 million in damages from Naftohaz\n\nUkrainy, an amount that would infringe Ukraine's July agreement with\n\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF). Insiders told EDM that\n\nre-payment of the compensation could lead to conflict between\n\nYanukovych and Firtash.

My opinion is that the current crisis is twofold; on\n\nthe one hand, it's partly due to the exhaustion of both the\n\nadministrative resource and the symbolic capital of the country's\n\nauthoritarian leadership; Lukashenko simply can't get his country any\n\nfurther, he's worn-off, a horse to be shot. But Russia's role in\n\neroding the reserves of Belarus (by joggling with the prices etc) is\n\nalso quite significant. The thing is Lukashenko seems to be a chairman\n\nof kolkhoz when it comes to his psychology, as a Belarusian friend of\n\nmine likes to say. He cornered himself pretty much in the last 6\n\nmonths or so, and is now deprived of the little maneuver space he had\n\nto play with Europe as well as Russia.\n\nHowever obvious it all may seem, it's interesting that many people are\n\nspeaking about the same scenario of financial meltdown repeating in\n\nUkraine this fall. Although it seems fairly fantastic to me, with\n\nincomparably larger reserves and investment and greater openness of\n\nUkraine, it's interesting that the tensions with seemingly friendly\n\nRussians is developing similarly to how it has been in Belarus.\n\nYanukovych is also kind of cornering himself a lit bit with the human\n\nrights problems. See for instance the last report of the Freedom\n\nHouse. What do you think about these scenarios, are they absolutely\n\nfrom an alternative reality?\n\nBy the way, kudos to your permanent following of the cooperation\n\nbetween Russia and Germany.

Russia has\n\nalready penalized Ukraine twice on trade. The first time was on metals\n\nwhich the Ukrainian companies passed on to their Russian buyers. The\n\nsecond time was on caramel which hit Poroshenko. He's got 1 or 2 chocolate\n\nplants in Russia so he's hedged in okay for now. The kicker is many in the\n\nopposition and even foreign Ukrainian observers, some of whom are\n\ninfluential, want the EU to emphasize adherence to human rights (and all\n\nthat jazz) a la EU values as a strong precondition before Ukraine is\n\nallowed to freely trade with the EU. They want the EU to use carrots and\n\nsticks. The big picture still remains: EU is short term pain and long term\n\ngain while the opposite is true with a customs union with Russia. Ukraine\n\nis well aware of the consequences of joining Russia's union. They've seen\n\nBelarus' revenue from gas and car sales go to Moscow. They know what's up.\n\nWhich is why the Chinese president's visit is important. Nothing panned\n\nout for Yanukovych since last year's visit in terms of real investments\n\nbut experts say some bilateral agreements may be signed - don't know which\n\nones but could be in infrastructure and agriculture. The Chinese view\n\nUkraine as a window to Europe and European markets. They don't like seeing\n\nUkraine under Russia's sphere of influence. The big question is whether\n\nUkraine will act on its national interests and actually elevate its\n\ncooperation to a strategic level or cooperate along ideological lines i.e.\n\nauthoritarianism. The visit is scheduled for June 18-20. The Chinese\n\npresident will first arrive in Crimea and then will visit Kyiv.\n\nAnother round of gas talks possible with Russia.

In terms of EU, there's so\n\nmany\n\nstandards that need to be raised and legislation that need to be passed. I\n\nthink Ukraine can only export honey and some other minor products to the\n\nEU\n\n-- that 's all. All other products don't meet safety, inspection, quality,\n\netc. EU standards. It's a pipedream.\n\nThe EU will cease to exist by the time Ukraine will be ready to join the\n\nEU\n\nas a full fledged member anyhow.\n\nThat said, CIS markets are not the one a rational country looking out for\n\nits interests wants to join. Russia, as before, belongs to countries (its\n\nmarkets) that is susceptible to different types of fluctuations. I don't\n\nsee\n\nhow a customs union is beneficial to Ukraine. I'd also dispel the myth of\n\nsome kind of customs union with the EU. Although the EU would like to\n\nunload\n\nmore of its goods/services in Ukraine, the EU foremost needs reliable\n\nmarkets and that entails property protection/rights and strong\n\ninstitutions,\n\nboth of which Ukraine lacks. And this can't be rectified in one year.\n\nMoreover, any union with CIS markets will only complicate things,\n\nespecially\n\nwith integration efforts with EU structures. Conditions for a customs\n\nunion\n\nare different from EU entry conditions plus don't forget that Ukraine is a\n\nWTO members\n\nAny customs union with CIS will eventually run counter to Ukr's WTO\n\ncommitments,\n\nEU-integration commitments and its own national interests because Russia\n\nwill\n\ndominate the customs union.\n\nCODE: UA301\n\nPUBLICATION: Background/analysis\n\nATTRIBUTION: STRATFOR source in Kiev\n\nSOURCE DESCRIPTION: Confederation partner at Kyiv Post\n\nSOURCE RELIABILITY: B\n\nITEM CREDIBILITY: 2/3\n\nSUGGESTED DISTRIBUTION: Eurasia, Lauren\n\nSOURCE HANDLER: Eugene\n\nI'd like to still maintain a cautionary approach to describing the extent\n\nto which Moscow controls Akhmetov.\n\nAkhmetov's plants have (or had) a direct gas supply contract with Gazprom\n\n- true. Journalists joked that when Akhmetov allowed star footballer\n\nTimoshchuk to go to St. Petersburg's Zenit (owned by Gazprom) that it was\n\npart of their gas deal.\n\nBut Ukraine is Akhmetov's backyard. It was Akhmetov who swallowed up\n\n(Russian) Novinsky's SMART Group - I think Novinsky only has 25% of\n\nMetinvest. Akhmetov has good relations with Mittal Steel Kryviy Rih. He\n\ncontrols steel in Ukraine, period. He literally controls a quarter of the\n\nnation's industry and a majority of its lucrative metallurgical\n\nindustry.When examining the Donbas region, I don't see much Russian money.\n\nThey don't let in anybody - they're anemic to any kind of competition,\n\nincluding Russian.\n\nBut the More Akhmetov accesses foreign capital and opens up, the more his\n\nbusiness interests will run counter with how the current administration\n\nbehaves. Akhmetov (of all people) already cried foul when he criticized a\n\npro-presidential law on carbon credit trading on grounds that it would\n\nopen up loopholes for massive corruption in the sector. I don't recall the\n\nlast time Akhmetov was openly fighting corruption. Usually he is the\n\ntarget of corruption allegations.\n\nI believe it would be presumptuous to overstate Moscow's control over\n\nAkhmetov.\n\nFor the record, it was Firtash that kept Yushchenko from a Tymoshenko\n\npeace alliance. Firtash lobbied Yushchenko to form a coalition with Party\n\nof Regions.

I'm\n\nalso open to re-organizing this if needed since this is the first\n\nofficial 1 month medium term project I have completed.\n\n--\n\nDiscussion:\n\nUkraine has become the center of a growing economic competition between\n\nRussia and the EU. As the country is being contested to join into a free\n\ntrade agreement with the EU on the one hand and a customs union with\n\nRussia on the other, a choice in either direction could significantly\n\nchange the balance of power (both economically and politically) in the\n\ncountry, an event that would have important regional implications. The\n\nfollowing is a dive into why Ukraine is important, the structure and\n\nimperatives of the Ukrainian economy, how this fits into the competition\n\nbtwn Russia and EU, and how this competition is likely to play out.\n\nWhy Ukraine is important economically\n\n* Ukraine is the second largest economy in former Soviet Union and has\n\nthe second largest population, trailing only Russia in both\n\ncategories\n\n* Ukraine's economic important derives from its resources, as it is\n\nboth a major industrial and agricultural producer and exporter\n\n* It is also important as a transit country, serving as a key energy\n\nhub from Russia to Europe\n\nCurrent state of Ukrainian economy/industry\n\n* As mentioned, Ukraine is a resource producing country, and these\n\nresources (particularly heavy industry like steel, metals,\n\nchemicals) and agriculture is what drives their economy\n\n* The country was hit hard by the global financial crisis, seeing\n\ndouble digit contractions in GDP in 2009\n\n* Now as global economy is recovering (albeit slowly), so is Ukrainian\n\nindustry and exports - GDP growth is expected to be 4-4.5% in 2011\n\nUkraine's #1 goal is macroeconomic stability and growth\n\n* The way to achieve this goal is to have a good working relationship\n\nwith IMF, while balancing the relationship between EU and Russia to\n\nits advantage for economic gain\n\n* Belarus is an example of what not to do - has isolated itself\n\npolitically and economically from the EU (and likely the IMF as\n\nwell) while leaving itself vulnerable to Russia's economic designs\n\n(privatization program) for financial aid which has limited its\n\nautonomy\n\n* Therefore for Ukraine to preserve its autonomy, it is important to\n\nkeep its financial (IMF) and trade (EU and Russia) options open and\n\nplay them off to its own advantage\n\nOn the first strategy (IMF), Ukraine has been relatively successful\n\n* While the previous administration under Yushchenko was so fractured\n\npolitically that the IMF suspended its dealings with Ukraine on the\n\n$15 billion loan program that began in Jul 2010, Yanukovich has been\n\nable to consolidate the government and has re-started cooperation\n\nwith the IMF\n\n* Talks are ongoing, and the IMF has praised Ukraine for its work on\n\nmaintaining health levels of budget deficit, forex, etc\n\n* It is expected that Ukraine will begin to receive new disbursements\n\nbefore the end of the year to facilitate their macroeconomic\n\nstability\n\n* However, there are still some uneasy and contentious reforms\n\nassociated with the program, such as raising household gas prices,\n\nwhich is politically an unpopular move for Yanukovich\n\nOn the second strategy (balance btwn Russia and EU), Ukraine has been\n\nsuccessful so far\n\n* Up to this point, Ukraine's trade relationship with the EU and\n\nRussia has been relatively balanced, and this is clearly reflected\n\nstatistically:\n\n* Of Ukraine's exports - 25% went to EU, while 26% went to Russia\n\n(along with another 6% to Belarus and Kazakhstan).\n\n* Imports are slightly more in favor of Russia, as Ukraine imported\n\n43% of its goods from Russia, compared to 37% from the EU.\n\n* However, When breaking down Ukrainian imports and exports into\n\ncomponents, it becomes clear that the trade relationship between\n\nUkraine and Russia and Ukraine and EU are different in nature.\n\n* Ukraine's relationship with Russia is dominated by\n\nsteel/machinery/industrial inputs exported to Russia, while energy\n\nis the main commodity imported from Russia\n\n* Meanwhile, Ukraine exported oil and gas (via transit) to EU along\n\nwith some steel and metals, while it imported mainly machinery and\n\nvehicles from EU\n\nBut things are starting to change and the competition over Ukraine is\n\nheating up\n\n* Both the EU and Russia are currently looking for Ukraine to further\n\nintegrate into their respective economic blocs at the expense of the\n\nother, the former via a free trade agreement with the EU and the\n\nlatter via the Russia-Belarus-Kazakhstan customs union\n\n* Ukraine has taken a careful approach in this, though it has\n\nrepeatedly said the country's priority is the EU free trade\n\nagreement, taking a more nuanced approach to the customs union by\n\nsaying it would be interested in joining into some relationship with\n\nthe CU, but one that falls short of full membership\n\nSo then which bloc serves Ukrainian interests?\n\n* The general consensus is that the EU FTA is the more beneficial\n\nrelationship for Ukraine, as the EU is a larger and more dynamic\n\nmarket than Russia and a removal of duties on EU imports to Ukraine\n\nwould raise more cash for Ukraine\n\n* Ukraine doesn't want to join the Customs Union, knowing it is a bloc\n\ndesigned to integrate economic systems to that of Russia. Ukraine\n\nsimply has too important of an economic relationship with the EU to\n\nre-orient its economy overwhelmingly toward Russia (this dynamic\n\nmakes it different from Belarus and Kazakhstan).\n\n* Many (largely from the west or pro-western side) argue that the\n\nshort term pain is worth it for the long term gain, saying that the\n\nopposite is true for Russia (short term gain vs. long term gain)\n\nBut the reality is more complicated:\n\n* Many Ukrainian goods - particularly heavy industry which makes up a\n\nmajority of their major exports (and more specifically steel, which\n\nis about 45% of total exports) - would be far less competitive when\n\nsubject to competition from EU countries\n\n* There are also entrenched interests from the oligarch class in\n\nUkraine, many of which have complex ties to Russia, that are against\n\nthe creation of a FTA with the EU. This is complicated further by\n\nthe fact that Yanukovich's political stability (and perhaps\n\nsurvival) is dependent on support from these oligarchs.\n\n* Perhaps more importantly, there is the Russia factor - further\n\norienting its economy towards the EU leaves Ukraine subject to\n\neconomic and political responses/manipulation from Russia. Russia\n\nhas explicitly threatened economic retaliation against Ukraine were\n\nit to join the EU fta, such as raising export duties on Ukrainian\n\ngoods, which could severely damage Ukraine's macroeconomic stability\n\n(as seen with Belarus). Also, Russia has proven that it can back up\n\nits threats before from multiple pipeline cutoffs to Ukraine during\n\nthe Orange era (a threat that will be even more poignant when Nord\n\nStream will come online and replace a significant part of Ukraine's\n\nrole as an energy transit state).\n\n* But Russia hasn't only leveraged threats against Ukraine, it has\n\nalso offered carrots as well - According to insight we received a\n\nwhile back, Putin offered Ukraine a compensation package - one that\n\nincludes more than just financial incentives - to remind Ukraine of\n\nthe benefits of working with Russia and the consequences involved in\n\ngoing with the Europeans\n\nSo then what will Ukraine do?\n\n* Ukraine is well aware of all these dynamics, and therefore if it\n\nwere to join the EU fta, this would be a calculated risk\n\n* Logically, Ukraine's imperative remains to balance both economic\n\nrelationships by advocating strengthening these relationships while\n\nnot fully integrating with either Russia or EU, knowing the risks\n\ninvolved with such a move\n\n* However, at least officially, Ukraine is committed to completing\n\nfree trade talks with the EU before the end of the year. This could\n\njust be rhetoric in order to give itself room to manuever and\n\nUkraine could find reason to stall these negotiations. Or Ukraine\n\ncould actually be serious about this, which according to most media\n\nand experts (and the government itself), it is. So is this all a\n\nbluff or am I missing something here in the logic?\n\n--\n\nFollow up questions to discussion:\n\nis FTA beneficial for Russia?\n\nOnly in case of EU-Russia FTA:\n\nClearly, closer trade integration between Russia and the EU would\n\nrelieve Ukraine from having to make a difficult choice with respect to\n\nthe direction of integration. For instance, should Russia and the EU\n\nenter a free trade agreement, the possibility of which is envisaged in\n\nthe current EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA),\n\nUkraine's participation in both DCFTA and CU could become perfectly\n\nfeasible. Of course, for that to become possible, a number of difficult\n\nproblems would have to be solved. First, in order to start free trade\n\nnegotiations with the EU, Russia will need to join the WTO first,\n\nalthough this target appears now realistic. Second, a free trade\n\nagreement with Russia would require also free trade with both Kazakhstan\n\nand Belarus, which in the latter case appears particularly problematic,\n\nprimarily (but not only) for political reasons.\n\ntechnical/exceptions to FTA?\n\nIn fact, the preliminary EU-Ukraine DCFTA agreement envisages no import\n\nduties on the Ukrainian side, with the exception of the automotive\n\nindustry (and potentially agricultural products).\n\nImpact on naftogaz/gazprom talks?\n\nRussia has said it would be open to lowering gas price, but only in\n\nexchange for a Naftogaz/Gazprom merger\n\n--\n\nOligarchs:\n\n*this section is more of a compilation than my analysis, with still some\n\nthings to weed through - comments welcome\n\nWhat is the role of Ukrainian oligarchs before/after Yanukovich?\n\nBefore\n\n* Wealthy businessmen started gaining influence in the mid-to-late\n\n1990s, playing an important political role during the presidency of\n\nLeonid Kuchma. Although they were influential, Kuchma managed to\n\nkeep them under his control, guaranteeing the dominance-if only\n\nfragile-of national interests over corporate ones. When Viktor\n\nYuschenko came to power in 2005, however, he brought another group\n\nof big businessmen closer to the circles of power, giving them\n\naccess to assets earlier controlled by Kuchma's oligarchs.\n\nAfter\n\n* In the first presidential election since Mr Yushchenko's Orange\n\nRevolution triumph in 2004, the biggest beneficiary of billionaire\n\nbacking is Mr Yanukovich, the opposition leader then defeated by Mr\n\nYushchenko but now the clear frontrunner.\n\n* He is supported by Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's richest man and\n\npresident of Shaktar Donetsk, Ukraine's second most successful\n\nfootball club. Both men hail from the east Ukraine steel belt, where\n\nMr Yanukovich launched his career and Mr Akhmetov founded his\n\nfortune. His other business backers include Dmitry Firtash, the gas\n\ntrading billionaire, for whom the election is particularly\n\nimportant.\n\n* The greatest concentration of wealth lies within the Party of\n\nRegions. This in itself is ironic, because the Party of Regions,\n\nlike the Unified Russia party, has attracted a large proportion of\n\nformer communist voters. Of the $112 billion total assets of\n\nUkraine's 50 wealthiest, $35.4 billion or a third of the total is\n\nheld by members of the Party of Regions.\n\n* Yanukovych has taken five steps to remove obstacles to the\n\nmonopolization of power. The first to go were parliament, which has\n\nbecome a rubber stamp institution, followed by television whose\n\noligarch owners rushed to prove their loyalty to the new regime. The\n\nthird, on October 1, was Ukraine's return to a presidential\n\nconstitution and a month later the Party of Regions won a majority\n\nin local councils in a bitterly contested election.\n\n* While the older oligarchs maintained their position at the top, the\n\nappearance of new players began disrupting their monopolies. Under\n\nYanukovych, the older interest groups and some newer people close to\n\nhim are trying to reverse the Yuschenko-era developments, and to\n\nensure that their interests are not subject to the oversight of a\n\nrelatively strong president. In today's Ukraine the corporate\n\ninterests of a limited number of oligarchs prevail\n\n* Kostyantyn Zhevaho is one of the last representatives of big\n\nbusiness who has not left [the opposition] faction of the Yuliya\n\nTymoshenko Bloc in parliament. All five businessmen made their\n\nprofits mostly from metallurgy.\n\nWhat is Yanukovich's relationship with the oligarchs?\n\n* So far Yanukovich is balancing between two oligarchic groups - the\n\nso-called RosUkrEnergo group and the Donetsk clan. The big question\n\nis whether he will continue to do so, or oust the oligarchs to build\n\nhis own power hierarchy.\n\n* The Ukrainian government has just been changed and slimmed down. In\n\nterms of structure, this makes much more sense. The balance between\n\nthe RosUkrEnergo camp (billionaire co-owner Dmytro Firtash, Energy\n\nMinister Yuri Boiko, presidential chief of staff Serhiy Lyovochkin\n\nand Security Service of Ukraine chief Valeriy Khoroshkovskiy) and\n\nthe Donetsk group (wealthy and influential businessmen Rinat\n\nAkhmetov, Andriy Kliuev and Boris Kolesnikov) appears to be\n\nmaintained, while Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn, socialist and Communist\n\nParty cronies are gone.\n\n* The biggest question is whether Yanukovych will continue to balance\n\nthe big Ukrainian businessmen close to him who currently dominate\n\nhis government or whether he will take them out.\n\nOthers analysis:\n\n* Akhmetov, who accumulated his business empire when Yanukovych was\n\nDonetsk governor in 1997-2002, has been sidelined from the\n\npresidential administration and Nikolai Azarov's government.\n\nMeanwhile, the influence of Firtash, the country's only Western\n\nUkrainian oligarch, has grown in both institutions.\n\n* Boyko and Firtash have long-standing ties to the energy sector\n\ntogether with Levochkin and Security Service Chairman, Valeriy\n\nKhoroshkovsky. Khoroshkovsky and Firtash played a strategic role in\n\nYanukovych's election through their control of Inter, Ukraine's most\n\npopular television channel.\n\n* In addition to the marginalization of Akhmetov, other oligarchs who\n\naligned with Viktor Yushchenko (Igor Kolomoysky) or Tymoshenko\n\n(Sergei Taruta, Vitaliy Haidiuk, and Konstantin Zhevago) have lost\n\nout. Kolomoysky, often depicted in terms of business practices as\n\nUkraine's most odious oligarch, is in de facto exile in Geneva as he\n\nis seen as the first likely casualty of a Putin-style attack on the\n\noligarchs.\n\n* Established in 2001, the Party of Regions has never been a uniform\n\nbody. Since its beginning, various industrial and territorial groups\n\nhave been vying for influence within the Party. Over time, new\n\ngroups have joined the struggle, including the powerful bureaucratic\n\nlobby and the influential Russophile intelligentsia circles. The\n\narrangement of these groups and communities is fluid. Currently the\n\nmost important camps are those surrounding Rinat Akhmetov, Dmytro\n\nFirtash and Viktor Yanukovych.\n\n* Rinat Akhmetov is a major entrepreneur and an influential member of\n\nthe Party of Regions. He owns the SCM holding, one of Ukraine's\n\nbiggest business groups, and represents the Donetsk region, the\n\nmetallurgic industry, and to an extent the energy sector. Akhmetov\n\nis interested in Ukraine entering the global markets, also as a\n\ncompetitor of the Russian economy. Even though he is a member of\n\nparliament, he does not publicly participate in politics.\n\n* Akhmetov's main representative in the Azarov cabinet is Borys\n\nKolesnikov, formally the deputy PM in charge of preparations to the\n\nEURO 2012 football championship, and in reality, the person in\n\ncharge of securing Akhmetov's interests. Andriy Kluyev, who aspires\n\nto control the electricity sector in Ukraine and who is supposed to\n\ncheck the influence of the energy minister Yuriy Boyko, also\n\nrepresents Akhmetov. In total, Akhmetov has eight representatives in\n\nthe new government, including three deputy prime ministers and one\n\npermanent presidential representative to the government (a very\n\nimportant function in the Ukrainian political system), Iryna\n\nAkimova; she is also the first deputy of the Presidential\n\nAdministration chief Serhiy Lovochkin, and represents Akhmetov's\n\ninterests in this body.\n\n* Dmytro Firtash is not a member of the Party of Regions, but has a\n\ngroup of his supporters in the Party. A co-owner of RosUkrEnergo\n\nwith dual (Ukrainian and Hungarian) citizenship, Firtash is mainly\n\ninterested in untransparent trade in Russian natural gas, and\n\ncurrently hopes to regain the positions he lost in 2009 in the\n\naftermath of the agreement between Vladimir Putin and Yulia\n\nTymoshenko, which eliminated intermediaries from the gas trade. He\n\nheld a major sway in President Yushchenko's circle (according to\n\nsome sources, the president's brother Petro was one of his business\n\npartners).\n\n* Firtash is present in politics through his representatives; the most\n\nimportant ones currently are the head of the Presidential\n\nAdministration Serhiy Lovochkin (who is also closely associated with\n\nYanukovych and the former president Leonid Kuchma) and Firtash's\n\nbusiness partner Yuriy Boyko (the energy minister) whom Firtash\n\nfailed to have appointed as a deputy prime minister. Firtash also\n\nhas influence over Valeriy Khoroshkovsky, a major entrepreneur and\n\nthe new head of the Security Service of Ukraine. In total, he has\n\nthree representatives in the government.\n\n* The group surrounding Viktor Yanukovych consists mainly of members\n\nof the state bureaucracy, as well as representatives of the Luhansk\n\nDistrict (the north-eastern part of the Donbas, whose elite has been\n\ncontinually struggling against the hegemonic ambitions of the\n\nDonetsk group). The Luhansk group includes deputy PM Viktor Tikhonov\n\nand the new head of the Party of Regions parliamentary group\n\nOleksandr Yefremov. Some parts of the Russophile intelligentsia,\n\nrepresented in the government by the (Kyiv-born) education minister\n\nDmytro Tabachnyk, have also been gravitating towards Yanukovych.\n\nTabachnyk's influence in the group will be counterbalanced by the\n\ndeputy head of the Presidential Administration Anna Herman, who is\n\nan advocate of balance between the Ukrainian and Russian-speaking\n\ncomponents of Ukraine's social life.\n\nWhat is the relationship amongst Ukrainian oligarchs?\n\n* Ukraine's oligarchs were never united as a group. Following\n\nYushchenko's election, they openly supported the orange camp.\n\n* Pinchuk (Interpipe) and Kolomoysky (Pryvat) are Ukraine's second and\n\nthird wealthiest citizens but with far less wealth than Akhmetov, at\n\n$8.8 and $6.6 billion, respectively. Both have continued to fund\n\npolitical projects externally: Pinchuk in Viche and Kolomoysky in\n\nOur Ukraine. Three Pryvat oligarchs in third, fourth and sixth\n\nplaces control $17.7 billion.\n\n* Other oligarchs also supported the orange camp. Petro Poroshenko\n\n($1.12 billion [22nd place]) was an ally of Yushchenko from 2001\n\nwhen Our Ukraine was formed, and his Channel 5 was one of only two\n\ntelevision stations that gave coverage to the 2004 Yushchenko\n\nelection campaign. Kyiv Mayor Leonid Chernovetsky ($750 million\n\n[28th place]) backed Yushchenko in 2004 and has remained an ally.\n\n* The former head of the 2004 Yanukovych campaign, Serhiy Tyhipko\n\n($1.64 billion [17th place], who, like Pinchuk, left politics after\n\nthe orange revolution, has returned as head of the Tymoshenko\n\ngovernment's Council on Investors. Another Pinchuk protege, Valeriy\n\nKhoroshkovskyi ($1.55 billion [18th place]), is head of the State\n\nCustoms.\n\n* Meanwhile, Industrial Union of Donbas (ISD) oligarchs Serhiy Taruta\n\nand Vitaliy Haydiuk (worth $2.37 billion each [11th and 12th]) are\n\naligned with the Tymoshenko government. Konstantyn Zhevago ($5.2\n\nbillion [fifth]), the first and only Ukrainian businessman to float\n\nshares on the London Stock Exchange for his Ferrexpo company, is a\n\nTymoshenko bloc parliamentary deputy.\n\n* A central figure contributing to ending Yanukovych's honeymoon with\n\nthe West is the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) Chairman, Valery\n\nKhoroshkovsky. It is, therefore, surprising that his protege,\n\noligarch and Leonid Kuchma's son-in-law, Viktor Pinchuk, a\n\ntrailblazer in seeking to lobby a new and improved international\n\nimage for himself, has remained silent. Khoroshkovsky was propelled\n\ninto Ukrainian politics in 2002 as a leader of the KOP (Winter Crop\n\nGeneration) political party that Pinchuk funded as a rival to Viktor\n\nYushchenko's Our Ukraine.\n\n* In addition to Pinchuk, Khoroshkovsky is also tied to Dmytro Firtash\n\nthrough media interests in Inter, Ukraine's most popular television\n\nchannel, and seven regional channels. Inter, which is the dominant\n\nchannel in Russophone Eastern-Southern Ukraine, played a vital role\n\nin mobilising votes for Yanukovych in this year's presidential\n\nelections. Firtash, unlike Pinchuk, has no political ambitions\n\nbeyond aligning with Ukrainian politicians who do not intervene in\n\nhis business interests, particularly gas. Firtash has never run for\n\nparliament, unlike Pinchuk who did so in 1998 and 2002.\n\n* Pinchuk, Firtash and other Ukrainian oligarchs would not wish to see\n\na Russian-style authoritarian regime introduced into Ukraine as it\n\nwould be unpredictable in its relations with big business and would\n\nundermine European integration. Ukraine's oligarchs see as more\n\nimportant Kyiv signing a Free Trade Zone (FTZ) with the EU over the\n\namorphous CIS Single Economic Space. Nevertheless, Ukrainian\n\noligarchs have not followed some of their Russian counterparts\n\n(Mikhail Khoroshkovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, and the more\n\ncontroversial Boris Berezovsky) in opposing authoritarianism, after\n\nVladimir Putin was first elected in 2000. Some Ukrainian oligarchs,\n\nsuch as Khoroshkovsky and Igor Kolomoysky, owner of 1+1 channel,\n\nhave been accused by journalists of assisting in dismantling\n\ndemocratic gains by introducing censorship. The declining situation\n\nin the media has mostly contributed to tarnishing the Yanukovych\n\nadministration's image in Europe\n\nWhat is the relationship between Ukrainian oligarchs and Russian\n\noligarchs?\n\n* \"Pragmatic\" oligarchs have readily sold their assets (Industrial\n\nUnion of Donbas, Zaporizhstal) to unnamed Russian investors. Russian\n\nPrime Minister, Vladimir Putin, chairs Vneshekonombank that\n\npurchased Ukraine's Prominvestbank last year.\n\n* Akhmetov sent a signal through his vote for parliament's\n\nestablishment of an investigation commission into the RUE gas\n\nintermediary. The decision by the Stockholm Arbitration Court in\n\nJune against the Tymoshenko government's confiscation of RUE gas\n\nruled that Firtash/RUE should receive $3.7 billion plus $600 million\n\nin damages from Naftohaz Ukrainy, an amount that would infringe\n\nUkraine's July agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nInsiders told EDM that re-payment of the compensation could lead to\n\nconflict between Yanukovych and Firtash.\n\n--\n\nInsight:\n\nCODE: UA301\n\nPUBLICATION: Background/analysis\n\nATTRIBUTION: STRATFOR source in Kiev\n\nSOURCE DESCRIPTION: Confederation partner at Kyiv Post\n\nSOURCE RELIABILITY: B\n\nITEM CREDIBILITY: 2/3\n\nSUGGESTED DISTRIBUTION: Alpha\n\nSOURCE HANDLER: Eugene\n\nIt certainly looks like Ukraine will remain non-aligned in terms of\n\njoining anybody's custom union/free trade zone for quite some time now.\n\nRegarding oligarchs wanting to preserve the status quo and being afraid\n\nof competition, the EU's ambassador to Ukraine clearly stated this in\n\n2009 and made quite a news splash with his statement: \"Corruption, red\n\ntape, administrative obstacles of every kind. These are only things that\n\nserve the interests of those who today control the economy because they\n\ndo not want competition, they are allergic to competition\" -- Jose\n\nManuel Pinto Teixeira, European Union commission official, at Nov. 30,\n\n2009 press briefing.\n\nThe EU free trade agreement is very complicated from what people say.\n\nApparently, both sides have preliminarily agreed to some 90% of all\n\nitems. Many products will be phased in gradually over time to allow\n\nUkraine's producers of whatever products to catch up, get certified and\n\nto allow customs procedures to get streamlined.\n\nPeople say the EU is aware that Ukraine isn't ready but once deadlines\n\nare set with a clearly outlined action plan Ukraine is capable of\n\nfollowing a schedule.\n\nNevertheless, it's difficult ascertaining how sincere Ukraine is in\n\nentering into a FTA and whether it's still playing Russia and the EU off\n\none another. Please keep in mind many Ukrainian companies are doing\n\n\"self-regulation\" to get certified and enter the EU market without the\n\nFTA, mostly in the agriculture and food sector.\n\nIf Ukraine does enter the FTA before next year's parliamentary\n\nelections, look for a lot of spin and policy messaging on this from\n\ntheir side.\n\nSOURCE CODE: BY201\n\nPUBLICATION: analysis/background\n\nATTRIBUTION: STRATFOR source\n\nSOURCE DESCRIPTION: Analyst/Expert on Belarus and Ukraine\n\nSOURCE Reliability : n/a\n\nITEM CREDIBILITY: n/a\n\nDISTRIBUTION: Alpha\n\nSOURCE HANDLER: Eugene\n\n*To me, it would seem that carefully maneuvering between both blocs (EU\n\nFTA and Russia's customs union) while firmly committing to neither would\n\nbe the safest move for Yanukovych, yet he seems to be moving firmly in\n\nthe direction of the EU trade agreement - do you agree?\n\nYes, I agree that would certainly be the wisest route and it was one\n\nthat Kuchma handled superbly with his multi-vector foreign policy.\n\nYanukovych never struck me as a skilled negotiator, however, and may be\n\nhoping the Chinese option gives him another loophole if things go amiss\n\nwith Russia.\n\nSOURCE: N/A\n\nSOURCE DESCRIPTION: journalist on FSU/Eastern Europe at DW\n\nPUBLICATION: for background\n\nSOURCE RELIABILITY: A/B\n\nITEM CREDIBILITY: 1/2\n\nDISTRIBUTION: alpha\n\nSOURCE HANDLER: Antonia\n\nI've never been too much alarmist myself with regards to\n\nUkraine, speaking financially at least; but that's what I hear from\n\nthe country, and at some point I started thinking of it more, although\n\nstill as a fantasy rather than a possibility. But your view is quite\n\ninteresting in terms of linking the European integration success with\n\nthe possibility of a financial difficulties, provided Russia objects.\n\nActually, some early statements by Gazprom figures as well as Russian\n\nleadership imply next January there might be something similar to the\n\npreceding Russo-Ukrainian gas wars, at least because these statements\n\nindicate the possibility of the gas prices for Ukraine above 500 US.\n\nTaken along with the latest public statements of Ukraine's prime\n\nminister and top speakers from the ruling party that clearly signal\n\ndisappointment with the Russian reintegration projects, it makes me\n\nthink the coming fall and winter will see a true battle for Ukraine.\n\nAlso, quite interestingly, today a newspaper in Russia published an\n\narticle with some leaked information from the Ukrainian government,\n\nsaying that Yanukovych is dramatically intensifying cooperation with\n\nNATO. We have to be twice as careful given the origin of information,\n\nbut it's worth some consideration though.\n\nAll in all, I think you may find it interesting to consider at least\n\nthe perspectives of another gas war as a topic for discussion.\n\nThe visit of the Chinese president to Ukraine is also very interesting\n\nand looks like China is trying to do much the same thing as it does for\n\ninstance in Africa: offering grants, loans and investments. Of course,\n\nYushchenko with his democratization agenda was an obstacle to a closer\n\ncooperation with China that can develop now after long procrastination.\n\nOne may actually think that everything started symbolically with\n\nUkraine's quiet boycott of the Nobel prize ceremony last year because of\n\nthe award given to a Chinese dissident, I think you may remember this\n\nstory.\n\nPUBLICATION: analysis/background\n\nATTRIBUTION: STRATFOR source\n\nSOURCE DESCRIPTION: new source (no coding yet), fellow at Ukrainian\n\nthink tank\n\nSOURCE Reliability : n/a\n\nITEM CREDIBILITY: n/a\n\nDISTRIBUTION: Alpha\n\nSOURCE HANDLER: Eugene\n\nI would argue that the possibility of signing some 3+1 deal with the\n\nCU (Customs Union) is realistic as Russia is also interested in the\n\n\"second belt\" of\n\nfriendly states on which it may still project is influence, but the\n\nstates that are not closely integrated.

My opinion is that the current crisis is twofold; on\n\nthe one hand, it's partly due to the exhaustion of both the\n\nadministrative resource and the symbolic capital of the country's\n\nauthoritarian leadership; Lukashenko simply can't get his country any\n\nfurther, he's worn-off, a horse to be shot. But Russia's role in\n\neroding the reserves of Belarus (by joggling with the prices etc) is\n\nalso quite significant. The thing is Lukashenko seems to be a chairman\n\nof kolkhoz when it comes to his psychology, as a Belarusian friend of\n\nmine likes to say. He cornered himself pretty much in the last 6\n\nmonths or so, and is now deprived of the little maneuver space he had\n\nto play with Europe as well as Russia.\n\nHowever obvious it all may seem, it's interesting that many people are\n\nspeaking about the same scenario of financial meltdown repeating in\n\nUkraine this fall. Although it seems fairly fantastic to me, with\n\nincomparably larger reserves and investment and greater openness of\n\nUkraine, it's interesting that the tensions with seemingly friendly\n\nRussians is developing similarly to how it has been in Belarus.\n\nYanukovych is also kind of cornering himself a lit bit with the human\n\nrights problems. See for instance the last report of the Freedom\n\nHouse. What do you think about these scenarios, are they absolutely\n\nfrom an alternative reality?\n\nBy the way, kudos to your permanent following of the cooperation\n\nbetween Russia and Germany.

Russia has\n\nalready penalized Ukraine twice on trade. The first time was on metals\n\nwhich the Ukrainian companies passed on to their Russian buyers. The\n\nsecond time was on caramel which hit Poroshenko. He's got 1 or 2\n\nchocolate plants in Russia so he's hedged in okay for now. The kicker is\n\nmany in the opposition and even foreign Ukrainian observers, some of\n\nwhom are influential, want the EU to emphasize adherence to human rights\n\n(and all that jazz) a la EU values as a strong precondition before\n\nUkraine is allowed to freely trade with the EU. They want the EU to use\n\ncarrots and sticks. The big picture still remains: EU is short term pain\n\nand long term gain while the opposite is true with a customs union with\n\nRussia. Ukraine is well aware of the consequences of joining Russia's\n\nunion. They've seen Belarus' revenue from gas and car sales go to\n\nMoscow. They know what's up.\n\nWhich is why the Chinese president's visit is important. Nothing panned\n\nout for Yanukovych since last year's visit in terms of real investments\n\nbut experts say some bilateral agreements may be signed - don't know\n\nwhich ones but could be in infrastructure and agriculture. The Chinese\n\nview Ukraine as a window to Europe and European markets. They don't like\n\nseeing Ukraine under Russia's sphere of influence. The big question is\n\nwhether Ukraine will act on its national interests and actually elevate\n\nits cooperation to a strategic level or cooperate along ideological\n\nlines i.e. authoritarianism. The visit is scheduled for June 18-20. The\n\nChinese president will first arrive in Crimea and then will visit Kyiv.\n\nAnother round of gas talks possible with Russia. EU also will assess in\n\nSeptember Ukraine's fulfillment of the action plan with regard to visa\n\nfree regime.\n\nCODE: UA301\n\nPUBLICATION: Background/analysis\n\nATTRIBUTION: STRATFOR source in Kiev\n\nSOURCE DESCRIPTION: Confederation partner at Kyiv Post\n\nSOURCE RELIABILITY: B\n\nITEM CREDIBILITY: 2/3\n\nSUGGESTED DISTRIBUTION: Analysts\n\nSOURCE HANDLER: Eugene\n\nWhen the global financial crisis hit Ukraine, it greatly amplified to\n\nwhat\n\nextent Ukraine's economy is reliant on exports (mostly without added\n\nvalue\n\nproducts), its cheap labor force and its increasingly untrained and\n\nunqualified labor force.\n\nInstead of creating the necessary preconditions for stimulating the\n\nlocal\n\neconomy, Ukraine sat on its ass.\n\nJust look at the markets, they're not ready. In terms of EU, there's so\n\nmany\n\nstandards that need to be raised and legislation that need to be passed.\n\nI\n\nthink Ukraine can only export honey and some other minor products to the\n\nEU\n\n-- that 's all. All other products don't meet safety, inspection,\n\nquality,\n\netc. EU standards. It's a pipedream.\n\nThe EU will cease to exist by the time Ukraine will be ready to join the\n\nEU\n\nas a full fledged member anyhow.\n\nThat said, CIS markets are not the one a rational country looking out\n\nfor\n\nits interests wants to join. Russia, as before, belongs to countries\n\n(its\n\nmarkets) that is susceptible to different types of fluctuations. I don't\n\nsee\n\nhow a customs union is beneficial to Ukraine. I'd also dispel the myth\n\nof\n\nsome kind of customs union with the EU. Although the EU would like to\n\nunload\n\nmore of its goods/services in Ukraine, the EU foremost needs reliable\n\nmarkets and that entails property protection/rights and strong\n\ninstitutions,\n\nboth of which Ukraine lacks. And this can't be rectified in one year.\n\nMoreover, any union with CIS markets will only complicate things,\n\nespecially\n\nwith integration efforts with EU structures. Conditions for a customs\n\nunion\n\nare different from EU entry conditions plus don't forget that Ukraine is\n\na\n\nWTO members\n\nAny customs union with CIS will eventually run counter to Ukr's WTO\n\ncommitments,\n\nEU-integration commitments and its own national interests because Russia\n\nwill\n\ndominate the customs union.\n\nCODE: UA301\n\nPUBLICATION: Background/analysis\n\nATTRIBUTION: STRATFOR source in Kiev\n\nSOURCE DESCRIPTION: Confederation partner at Kyiv Post\n\nSOURCE RELIABILITY: B\n\nITEM CREDIBILITY: 2/3\n\nSUGGESTED DISTRIBUTION: Eurasia, Lauren\n\nSOURCE HANDLER: Eugene\n\nI'd like to still maintain a cautionary approach to describing the\n\nextent to which Moscow controls Akhmetov.\n\nAkhmetov's plants have (or had) a direct gas supply contract with\n\nGazprom - true. Journalists joked that when Akhmetov allowed star\n\nfootballer Timoshchuk to go to St. Petersburg's Zenit (owned by Gazprom)\n\nthat it was part of their gas deal.\n\nBut Ukraine is Akhmetov's backyard. It was Akhmetov who swallowed up\n\n(Russian) Novinsky's SMART Group - I think Novinsky only has 25% of\n\nMetinvest. Akhmetov has good relations with Mittal Steel Kryviy Rih. He\n\ncontrols steel in Ukraine, period. He literally controls a quarter of\n\nthe nation's industry and a majority of its lucrative metallurgical\n\nindustry.When examining the Donbas region, I don't see much Russian\n\nmoney. They don't let in anybody - they're anemic to any kind of\n\ncompetition, including Russian.\n\nBut the More Akhmetov accesses foreign capital and opens up, the more\n\nhis business interests will run counter with how the current\n\nadministration behaves. Akhmetov (of all people) already cried foul when\n\nhe criticized a pro-presidential law on carbon credit trading on grounds\n\nthat it would open up loopholes for massive corruption in the sector. I\n\ndon't recall the last time Akhmetov was openly fighting corruption.\n\nUsually he is the target of corruption allegations.\n\nI believe it would be presumptuous to overstate Moscow's control over\n\nAkhmetov.\n\nFor the record, it was Firtash that kept Yushchenko from a Tymoshenko\n\npeace alliance. Firtash lobbied Yushchenko to form a coalition with\n\nParty of Regions. Wikileaks has confirmed this as well.\n\n--\n\nReference:\n\nReports:\n\nhttp://carnegieeurope.eu/publications/?fa=42942\n\nhttp://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4cdba2132.html\n\nhttp://www.case.com.pl/upload/publikacja_plik/4931074_SA%20296last.pdf\n\nhttp://www.easternpartnership.org/community/debate/ukraine-s-economy-between-political-pressures\n\nhttp://www.easternpartnership.org/community/debate/eu-and-russia-both-important-ukraine\n\nhttp://0-www.eiu.com.library.lausys.georgetown.edu/index.asp?layout=displayVw&article_id=1738111558&geography_id=980000298&region_id=\n\nArticles\n\nhttp://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ab42016a-0174-11df-8c54-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1PC7V8smP\n\nhttp://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=33765\n\nhttp://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,UKR,4562d8b62,4c9b19992,0.html\n\nhttp://carnegieeurope.eu/publications/?fa=42942\n\nhttp://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4cdba2132.html\n\nhttp://www.kyivpost.com/news/opinion/op_ed/detail/95300/#ixzz1PqNaqRmG\n\nhttp://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/eastweek/2010-03-17/end-cohabitation-ukraine\n\n--\n\nLauren Goodrich\n\nSenior Eurasia Analyst\n\nSTRATFOR\n\nT: 512.744.4311\n\nF: 512.744.4334\n\nlauren.goodrich@stratfor.com\n\nwww.stratfor.com"
