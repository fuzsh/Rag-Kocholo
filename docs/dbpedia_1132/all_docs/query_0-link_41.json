THE UKRAINIAN WEEKLY Published by the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> N<strong>at</strong>ional Associ<strong>at</strong>ion Inc., a fr<strong>at</strong>ernal non-profit associ<strong>at</strong>ion Vol. LXXVIII No. 27 THE UKRAINIAN WEEKLY SUNDAY, JULY 4, 2010 $1/$2 in Ukraine <strong>Haydamaky</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>perform</strong> <strong>first</strong> U.S. <strong>concert</strong> <strong>at</strong> Soyuzivka’s <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Cultural Festival <strong>Haydamaky</strong> <strong>Haydamaky</strong>, Ukraine’s biggest ethno-rock band, will <strong>perform</strong> <strong>at</strong> Soyuzivka on July 17. by Zenon Zawada Kyiv Press Bureau KYIV – Rockers <strong>Haydamaky</strong> – the headliners <strong>at</strong> the upcoming 2010 <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Cultural Festival <strong>at</strong> Soyuzivka – were among the most fervent supporters of the Orange Revolution, having explored Europe and seen the benefits of Western society. The band describes itself as a <strong>Ukrainian</strong> musical form<strong>at</strong>ion th<strong>at</strong> thinks European. “It all began in the ‘90s, when we weren’t yet <strong>Haydamaky</strong>,” lead singer Oleksandr Yarmola <strong>to</strong>ld The Weekly during a recent interview <strong>at</strong> a pizza café situ<strong>at</strong>ed in the outer rings of Kyiv. “We then began <strong>to</strong> travel <strong>to</strong> Poland, then Germany, and opened for ourselves the Western world. We played on the streets, weddings, played in clubs, and in punk clubs, where the hardest punk was played.” The band became the <strong>Haydamaky</strong>, as its website notes, changing its name “in honor of those who fought in Haydamachyna (a peasant rebellion against foreign oppression in 18th-century Ukraine). The new name associ<strong>at</strong>ed the band’s music with ideas of freedom and justice, establishing an even tighter link with <strong>Ukrainian</strong> folk culture, and taking the band <strong>to</strong> a <strong>to</strong>tally new stage.” A decade l<strong>at</strong>er, <strong>Haydamaky</strong> have achieved worldwide admir<strong>at</strong>ion, <strong>perform</strong>ing their ethno-rock on the main stage of the August 2009 Sziget rock festival in Budapest, central Europe’s largest, and Toron<strong>to</strong>’s <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Festival in September 2009. After <strong>perform</strong>ing this year in places as diverse as Siberia, Switzerland and Slovakia, <strong>Haydamaky</strong> will venture in<strong>to</strong> the C<strong>at</strong>skill region of upst<strong>at</strong>e New York <strong>to</strong> <strong>perform</strong> their <strong>first</strong> U.S. <strong>concert</strong> <strong>at</strong> the Soyuzivka Heritage Center on July 17 during the fourth annual <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Cultural Festival. Given it will be their <strong>first</strong> time visiting New York City, Mr. Yarmola said the band welcomes any offers <strong>to</strong> show them around the city th<strong>at</strong> never sleeps. Afterwards, it’s on <strong>to</strong> Calgary and Edmon<strong>to</strong>n (Alberta), and then <strong>to</strong> Winnipeg and Canada’s N<strong>at</strong>ional <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Festival <strong>at</strong> Dauphin, (Mani<strong>to</strong>ba). “I had very pleasant impressions,” Mr. Yarmola said of his <strong>first</strong> trip <strong>to</strong> Canada last year. “It’s not like Europe <strong>at</strong> all. Well, perhaps Sweden and Scandinavia a bit. There are lots of forests, wide spaces and skyline there <strong>to</strong>o.” The band’s global acclaim is built upon a decade of experimenting with a multitude of different musical styles, blending reggae, punk and ska rhythms and be<strong>at</strong>s with <strong>Ukrainian</strong> melodies. Yet <strong>Haydamaky</strong> have demonstr<strong>at</strong>ed they’re perpetually experimenting, with some albums incorpor<strong>at</strong>ing styles as diverse as rap. Last year, <strong>Haydamaky</strong> produced an album with the Polish jazz-rock heroes Voo Voo. Its flexibility is made possible by the band’s seven-member form<strong>at</strong>, including drummer Sergij Borysenko, guitarist Oleksandr Demyanenko, bass Volodymyr Sherstyuk, trumpet player Sergij Solovij (Continued on page 13) The <strong>first</strong> 100 days: Yanukovych aims for <strong>to</strong>tal control of civil activity by Zenon Zawada Kyiv Press Bureau The <strong>first</strong> 100 days: The <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Weekly examines the activity of the administr<strong>at</strong>ion of President Vik<strong>to</strong>r Yanukovych in Ukraine’s cultural life, economy, and foreign and domestic policy. This is the fourth article in the series. KYIV – It was the former German Ambassador <strong>to</strong> Ukraine Ditmar Studemann who <strong>first</strong> publicly acknowledged th<strong>at</strong> authoritarianism had returned <strong>to</strong> <strong>Ukrainian</strong> government. “The domestic policy of Ukraine after the <strong>first</strong> 100 days of the new government can be characterized as concentr<strong>at</strong>ed on stabiliz<strong>at</strong>ion <strong>at</strong> least, but authoritarian all the same,” Mr. Studemann <strong>to</strong>ld the Deutsche Welle news agency in an interview published June 4. His cause for alarm was justified when three weeks l<strong>at</strong>er his fellow countryman, Niko Lange, the Kyiv direc<strong>to</strong>r of the Konrad Adenauer Fund, was held <strong>at</strong> Kyiv Boryspil airport for 10 hours after criticizing the administr<strong>at</strong>ion of <strong>Ukrainian</strong> President Vik<strong>to</strong>r Yanukovych. Both Germans warned the Yanukovych administr<strong>at</strong>ion th<strong>at</strong> Euro-integr<strong>at</strong>ion wouldn’t be possible for Ukraine if its government pursued authoritarian policies such as repressing and persecuting the opposition, abusing the law for political ends and imposing police st<strong>at</strong>e measures on a peaceful popul<strong>at</strong>ion. Ironically, the Yanukovych administr<strong>at</strong>ion reacted with the same neo-Soviet tactics of intimid<strong>at</strong>ion against Mr. Lange th<strong>at</strong> he warned against. As a result, any pretense th<strong>at</strong> the Yanukovych administr<strong>at</strong>ion wants <strong>to</strong> build a democr<strong>at</strong>ic, European Ukraine where the rule of law is paramount has evapor<strong>at</strong>ed. “Not understanding civilized conduct, the people in government will act very aggressively, like in African or Asian dicta<strong>to</strong>rships,” said Dr. Oleh Soskin, the direc<strong>to</strong>r of (Continued on page 22) Volodymyr Hontar/UNIAN The Yanukovych administr<strong>at</strong>ion keeps protesters under control, as in this June 10 demonstr<strong>at</strong>ion in Kyiv held under the slogan “No <strong>to</strong> a police st<strong>at</strong>e.” Is Kyiv’s foreign policy balanced by Zenon Zawada Kyiv Press Bureau Below is a continu<strong>at</strong>ion of last week’s article in “The <strong>first</strong> 100 days” series focusing on the foreign policy of the Yanukovych administr<strong>at</strong>ion. KYIV – Upon taking office in February, the Yanukovych administr<strong>at</strong>ion went <strong>to</strong> gre<strong>at</strong> lengths <strong>to</strong> cre<strong>at</strong>e an image as a balancer between Russian and European interests in Ukraine. As a symbolic step, President Vik<strong>to</strong>r Yanukovych’s <strong>first</strong> foreign visit was <strong>to</strong> Brussels. In April, a month after becoming prime minister, Mykola Azarov <strong>to</strong>ld Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt th<strong>at</strong> he set for his government the goals of achieving a European Union Associ<strong>at</strong>ion Agreement and a free-trade agreement by the year’s end. In June, he said <strong>Ukrainian</strong>s would have visa-free travel <strong>to</strong> Europe as early as 2011. An EU integr<strong>at</strong>ion action for 2010 was even drafted. Yet, veteran observers of the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> political scene are calling it all a bluff. Actions and trends reveal the (Continued on page 16)"
