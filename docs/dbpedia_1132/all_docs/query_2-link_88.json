        "text": "Khoroshkovsky completed a postgraduate economics study at Taras Shevchenko Kyiv State University in 1993.\n\nBusiness career\n\nIn 1994 Khoroshkovsky started a metal trading business in partnership with Vadym Gurzhos which he disbanded in 1995 to become active in banking. Since then Khoroshkovsky has been active in the furniture retail and trading business and has had stakes in dairy, soda, machinery and bus factories. In 2004 Khoroshkovsky sold his stake in Ukrsotsbank to Ukraine's second-richest businessman Viktor Pinchuk for an estimated $200 million.\n\nAfter Khoroshkovsky's resignation as Economics Minister in January 2004 he was appointed vice president of steel giant Evraz, becoming its head in April 2006 either because of his connections or his 13-year friendship with Alexander Abramov. In December 2006 Khoroshkovsky resigned as Chief Executive Officer of Evraz because of his appointment as the First Deputy Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2005 Khoroshkovsky paid about $250 million for a 61% stake in Inter TV, one of Ukraine's biggest television channels. In June 2007 he expanded his U.A. Inter Media Group Ltd with various other channels bought from Dmytro Firtash. After Khoroshkovsky was appointed as Head of the State Customs Service of Ukraine in December 2007 his wife became head of U.A. Inter Media Group.\n\nIn June 2010 both Kanal 5 and TVi accused Khoroshkovsky of abusing his power and influence to preserve monopoly control of Ukraine's media airwaves and limit objective news reporting. Khoroshkovsky replied (early June 2010) that he was ready to sell his media business to a willing buyer.\n\nKhoroshkovsky sold 100 percent of Inter Media Group Limited (back) to Firtash on 1 February 2013.\n\nPolitical career\n\nKhoroshkovsky was a member of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) from the Ukrainian parliamentary election of 1998 until 2002 after winning a seat in the Krasnoperekopsk constituency, representing the People's Democratic Party. As a lawmaker he voted for the removal of Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko from his office in May 2001 which resulted in the end of Yushchenko's prime ministership.\n\nAt the March 2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election Khoroshkovsky represented the Team of Winter Generation, which won no seats; he was a member of the Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party at the time.\n\nIn August 2002 Khoroshkovsky was appointed deputy head in the Presidential Administration of President Leonid Kuchma. Khoroshkovsky was appointed minister of economy in December 2002 in the new Viktor Yanukovych government on recommendation of Labour Ukraine. In 2003 he criticized Ukraine's economic policy and threatened to resign if Ukraine entered the common economic space with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Labour Ukraine immediately warned the minister that any minister who opposed the entry of Ukraine to this common economic space would be fired from the government. Khoroshkovsky resigned in January 2004, complaining that the Finance Ministry was preventing his Economic Ministry from drawing up long-term economic plans.\n\nIn December 2006 President Viktor Yushchenko appointed Khoroshkovsky as First Deputy Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, from which Khoroshkovsky resigned in May 2007. On 24 December 2007 Khoroshkovsky was appointed as Head of the State Customs Service of Ukraine. He was relieved of this post on 28 January 2009. The same day Khoroshkovsky was appointed First Deputy Chief of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). On 11 March 2010 Khoroshkovsky was appointed head of the SBU by the Ukrainian Parliament. On 19 April 2010 Khoroshkovsky was appointed a staff member of the National Bank of Ukraine by President Viktor Yanukovych. In 2010 he was also member of the Supreme Council of Justice, that appoints and fires judges, from 31 May till 16 December.\n\nThe SBU opened its Soviet Ukrainian archives in January 2009. Khoroshkovsky believes that the SBU should reduce public access to its archives and concentrate on its main task of being a secret service.\n\nAccording to Member of the European Parliament Elmar Brok (who met Khoroshkovsky when Khoroshkovsky hosted a luxurious dinner for MEPs in Brussels in November 2010) \"he doesn't seem to understand that threatening the independence of the judiciary is one of biggest mistakes you can make when you are trying to build a new state, he doesn't seem to understand what are the proper limits of his mandate.\"\n\nPresident Yanukovych conferred a rank of general to Khoroshkovsky in August 2011.\n\nWhen Minister of Finance Fedir Yaroshenko resigned on 18 January 2012 he replaced by Khoroshkovsky as the new Minister of Finance the same day.; Khoroshkovsky was dismissed as head of the Security Service of Ukraine. After Andriy Klyuyev had left the post mid-February 2012 Khoroshkovsky was tipped as the new First Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine. On 22 February 2012 he was appointed First Vice Prime Minister and dismissed as finance minister. Relations with the European Union is among his responsibilities. Unlike most Ukrainian officials he speaks good English.\n\nIn his interview to Deutsche Welle, Khoroshkovsky stated that Viktor Yanukovych is not being allowed to the European Union due to selective justice.\n\nKhoroshkovskyi resigned from the interim Azarov Government on 14 December 2012 (the day after the re-appointment of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov) because he \"considered Azarov incapable of carrying out economic reforms and defending our country's strategic course for European integration\".\n\nIn the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election Khoroshkovskyi tried to return to national politics when he was second on the party list of Strong Ukraine (after party leader Serhiy Tihipko). But in the election the party failed to clear the 5% election threshold (it got 3.11% of the votes) and thus Khoroshkovskyi was not elected into parliament."
