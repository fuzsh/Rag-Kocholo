        "text": "On November 30, 2013, our president Viktor Yanucovich turned into a new Ceausescu when he dispersed a peaceful rally, breaking 19-years-old students’ heads to blood. Those students were standing for support of collaboration between Ukraine and EU.\n\nReading materials in your medias, having personal talks with some of you, listening to yours “why do you want to EU , EU is not good at all, EU is terrible , you do not understand where you’re aiming”, I came to the conclusion that you do not understand what’s actually going on here.\n\nLet me to explain that to you.\n\nIt is not about EU. It’s not about your Schengen zone, not about European values and so on.\n\nIt’s about our freedom from Ukrainian mafia, proclaimed themselves a government. Mafia, who in 4 years succeeded to steal the motherland from 45 million of people.\n\nOur so-called “president” was twice imprisoned for robbery when he was young. Our prime minister doesn’t speak national language.\n\nThe raids are all over the country.\n\nYou say we chosed this president by ourselves. No. Elections had a huge number of violations. People in the eastern regions of the country were threatened with dismissal if they do not vote for Yanukovych. In some places, people were forced to make a picture of their bulletins, and then checked to see whether the person voted for Yanukovych or not.\n\nOur police rape women, kill people and never go to jail http://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-rape-draws-outrage-over-official-impunity-063508747.html\n\nSons of our deputies and the deputies themselves driving drunk, kill people on the roads. And they never end up in prison http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/deputy-in-second-fatal-auto-accident-19526.html\n\nAll the police on the roads take bribes: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul_yDZgFEDo\n\nThis is what this bunch of oligarchs made with my country.\n\nIn Scandinavia, the kings sometimes used to use a city bus or metro, your ministers ride bicycles.\n\nAnd that’s how our president and prime minister go to work: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eoa_6L-Osp8\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftnX_yN8SpU\n\nAll roads on their route are closed for 20-40 minutes . Other cars are pressed to roadsides and wait. This happens several times a day.\n\nWhen they cannot block the traffic , the guards of our Prime Minister yell on drivers and beat their cars: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtJGUkg0-vg\n\nWhat does Ukrainians do? They honk from their cars protesting: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94xXhGO7vAw Does this help? Of course not.\n\nYou say Ukraine is heavily dependent on Russia and its gas. Let’s count together.\n\nUkraine produces about 21 billion cubic meters of gas per year. For comparison, Poland uses less than 15 billion cubic meters per year. Ukrainian gas should be enough for Ukraine. Why do we buy more than 30 billion cubic meters of russian gas each year and where it’s all go, I dont know . Perhaps you should ask the monopolistic company “Naftogaz Ukraine” .\n\nYou say Ukraine is deeply dependent on exports to Russia. That s true. ¼ of all Ukrainian exports goes to Russia. Do you know where another ¼ of Ukrainian exports goes? To you. To the EU countries. This is why I am pretty sure, we can cope with the loss of trade relations with Russia. Especially since the trade agreement with the EU (which Yanukovich refused to sign) implies the expansion of trade with Europe. Poland coped with almost the same difficulties quite quickly.\n\nNow, let’s check the prices in Ukraine(comparing with europe):\n\nDRESS in Berlin – 50 euros – http://www.zara.com/de/de/damen/kleider/enges-kleid-c269185p1294905.html\n\nthe same dress in Kiev – 65 euros – http://www.zara.com/ua/en/woman/dresses/tube-dress-c269185p1294905.html\n\nCHEESE:\n\nFrance – 2 euros – http://www.auchandirect.fr/produits-laitiers,-œufs/fromages/pointe-de-brie/id1/466/16839\n\nUkraine – 7 euros – http://megamarket.ua/catalog/search.php?s=President&g=0&page=3\n\nMILK:\n\nPoland – 0.70 euro – http://www.fudi.pl/index.php?ktg=67&pytMarka&pytRodzaj&sstr=3\n\nUkraine – 1 euro – http://megamarket.ua/catalog/search.php?s=молоко+незбиране&g=0\n\nDo you want me to continue ?\n\nAnd now, let’s talk about SALARIES:\n\nThe average salary of a surgeon in Ukraine is less than 300 euros per month. And how many your surgeons earn? http://en.for-ua.com/news/2013/04/16/161041.html\n\nThe average salary in Ukraine 320 euros, and what is your salary?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ukrainian_oblasts_and_territories_by_salary.\n\nNow you will ask yourself “But Ukrainians are such a good workers, so where the hell all the money of the country go?” Let me show you where:\n\nAmong the many real estate of our president: the brand new, recently built house of Yanukovych not far from the capital. Several pools, lake, golf course. Area – 1.8 hectares:http://mignews.com.ua/ru/articles/106801.html\n\n+ 30 hectares of forest . From this house to Kiev our president has a dedicated lane on the road.\n\nAnd this is a “forest house” of Yanukovych in beautiful Crimea –http://censor.net.ua/photo_news/11757/villa_yanukovicha_v_krymu_fotoreportaj\n\nOur president has bought more than 3 hectares of national park “Cape Aya” for only $ 800 000. Omit the fact that you. cannot. sell. the. National. Parks!, you ask yourself why is it so cheap? (for instance, 100 square meters apartment in the nearby city of Sevastopol costs an average of $ 70 000 ) Well, I think that’s because he is “president” .\n\nAll our courts are corrupted and work for the interests of the Mafia goverment of Yanukovych. Even now, when the whole world are looking of Ukraine, the power hits peaceful protesters and drag them to courts. Now the government is trying to put these people in jail for FIVE years. Just because they were present at the rally. Here are our courts.\n\nAnd now Yanukovich tries to raid the country. The fight happened near President Administration was a provocation from our President and pro-russian Viktor Medvedchuk, they tried to escalate the conflict so that they could start the emergency state. People in masks were throwing the stones into the young policemen, and to those policemen someone “forgot” to give their shields.\n\nWe, the real protesters stood in a line between provocateurs and police to protect those young police guys. Provocateurs, who pretend to be a protesters, continued to throw the stones. Many of policemen suffered, provocateurs injured also some peaceful people. And when the wounded policemen were dragged away, the real special guard (Berkut) arrived, they pushed provocateurs out, and then beated up the people who remained, including journalists. ultra-right forces are trying to marginalize our peaceful protest. This is what is going on, when bandits in power try to win a throne.\n\nThis is only a small part of success of Yanukovych.\n\nI will not talk about the way Yanukovych clan removes its rivals and former friends. Google Yevgeny Cherban, Yevgeny Kushnarev, Georgy Kirpa, Zinoviy Kulik. And check how they died. Can not prove anything, but I do not insist.\n\nThe point is; Yanukovych is not the KGB guy, not Lukashenko, not Putin or Gaddafi. Yqnukovych s a bandit. Behind him is his “family” – Yanukovych Jr., Rinat Akhmetov, Valery Khoroshkovsky, Sergei Lyovochkin, Firtash etc. All of them steal from the Ukrainian budget billions of euros each year. All they are doing business in Ukraine, stealing businesses by raids and changing the Ukrainian laws every half a year. They dont need to expand to the European market. Therefore, they do not care about geopolitics , they do not make a choice – Russia or EU. Their aim is isolation of Ukraine. Because in the isolated country they can do whatever they want .\n\nNow Yanukovych set up Ukraine for an auction – the highest bidder, Russia or Europe, wins. Offering EU to invite Russia for negotiation of the Ukraine-EU trade association, Yanukovych actually admitted that Ukraine is not a sovereign state anymore, from now on it belongs to Russia, and Russia has to decide “how much”. For Yanukovych and his gang Ukraine – is not a country. Its a business project. Its a pump, pumping money into their pockets.\n\nNow you are probably asking yourself how do we survive. As you can see, we are fighting. I am fighting. Received a European education and working in France, I decided to return to Ukraine, because I love my country. In leadership positions of PR in the cultural field, I have a good income (by Ukrainian standards) and live quite well. I visit your “terrible , terrible” EU several times a year, but I always come back, trying to help my Ukraine. And so many people do. We are educated, we are good at work, hospitable, and extremely smart, when we know English)). And, what is the most important, we are not going to surrender our country. Because for us, Ukraine – not a business project . It is not a pump. It is our Motherland.\n\nTherefore we are protesting for these long days and nights to have your and the worlds attention.\n\nOur petition to U.S. goverment, demandeing to arrest the Yanukovych bank accounts gathered 100,000 signatures in less than 4 days – https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/impose-personal-sanctions-president-ukraine-viktor-yanukovych-and-cabinet-ministers-ukraine-members/h58Fz30V\n\nOn Sunday, we had more than 100 000 people on the protest named #Euromaidan or #Євромайдан –http://novostiua.net/main/48867-nochyu-miliciya-trizhdy-pytalas-razognat-evromaydan-v-kieve.html\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thKaZSxmd4I\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atg24ceVQrA\n\nAnd the government has brought to the city police from all over the country. The government brought several thousand sporty marginals. Each of them was paid 20 to 100 euro. And their task was to provoke a fights or simply beat up people . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw60LDMk5F8\n\nDuring the last few days they have beaten up lots of people including several journalists (particularly the Reuters correspondent) they even beated up two police officers who tried to protect the journalists.\n\nThis morning the Government, using extreme force, broke up a peaceful rally , most consisting of students – http://news.liga.net/video/politics/932675-video_krovavogo_razgona_lyudey_nochyu_na_maydane.htm\n\nSome people succeeded to escape to Monastery, but police have come for them, and now the unarmed people are trying to barricade from the hundred of special units –http://www.segodnya.ua/politics/pnews/aktivisty-evromaydana-stroyat-barrikady-478714.html\n\nThis is the country where I live in. This is my Motherland. The country, where 45 million of people cannot get rid of a handful of thugs, who seized the power.\n\nOur “president”, knowing that he would never win the election in 2015, now is struggling to usurp the power. His dream is to become the second Lukashenko. But neither Yanukovych nor Putin understand one simple thing: Ukrainians are not Russians or Belarusians. We don’t have an antiutopical fatalism as Russians do. We don’t have an excessive sufferance as Belarusians do. But, unlike Russia and Belarus, after USSR collapse, we were fortunate to experience a taste of real freedom. We knew what real liberty is, we won it once again in 2004 with our power of unity, and now we will not give up so easy.\n\nNow, my european friends, tell me, is our protest because we want to be closer to EU?\n\nNo, my dears. We are well aware of all the difficulties in your countries. We know very well how hard it will be for us to integrate in Europe. But for us, the trade agreement with the EU, was not a visa-free Schengen zone, it was not about high salaries, not about good medicine and education. For us, the agreement with the EU was a sign of change of the criminal system. For us this agreement was first of all – CONTROL by EU politics of ukrainian crimrnal power. That is the thing our “president” so afraid of. And that’s exactly what we want so badly.\n\nSo dear Europeans, please, watch your language, when you talk about your motherlands.\n\nAnd appreciate what you have – your freedom."
