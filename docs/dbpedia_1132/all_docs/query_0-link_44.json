The volume includes analyses of the conflicts, security issues, key political developments and transformations in the Middle East, Central Asia, East Asia and Caucasus.\n\nThe break-up of the Soviet Union ushered new political and economic dynamics in Eurasia. With Eurasia’s vast geography, and its potential to promote European energy security and democratic transformation, its promise for the future has captured the attention of world leaders like never before.\n\nThe current issue of the “Contemporary Eurasia” VII (1, 2) is devoted to the ongoing developments and processes in the Eurasia and their impact on the region. The volume includes analyses of the security issues, key political developments and transitions in the Middle East and Caucasus.\n\nThis textbook provides an introduction to Eurasian Studies. As the book is designed for undergraduate students, it delivers an overview of political developments in Eurasia. The study primarily addresses Eurasianism as a geopolitical concept to familiarize students with the region they are projected to deal with. Subsequently, it concentrates on the last years of the Soviet Union to elucidate the conditions under which modern Eurasia as a geopolitical space was shaped. Eventually, the book details a number of former Soviet republics, in particular the Russian Federation, to probe into the developments that take place in Eurasia."
