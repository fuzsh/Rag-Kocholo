$568 million Married with two sons and one daughter Interests: metallurgy and media

Like many government officials and lawmakers, Valeriy Khoroshkovsky is widely accused of never really leaving the boardroom – nor has he ever been far from the epicenter of political power.

His boyish good looks and charm, and fluent English, seem in contrast to the apparent flaw that dominates questions at his press conferences: “Does he not have a conflict of interests?”

Khoroshkovsky has traded metals, sold furniture, owned a bank and run a Russian steel company, and today controls U.A. Inter Media Group, which has nine TV channels under its control, including the nation’s main one – Inter.

He has also unsuccessfully and successfully run for parliament, served in a number of advisory roles, first to the cabinet, then as aide to a prime minister, was first deputy head of the presidential administration, economy minister, and head of the Ukraine’s customs service.

Today, he is the nation’s top spy as head of the Security Service of Ukraine and, until recently, sat on the High Council of Judges that appoints and fires the nation’s judges.

Conflict or not, Khoroshkovsky certainly has both money and power.
