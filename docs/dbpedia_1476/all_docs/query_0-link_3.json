Television and pop culture historian and author Herbie J Pilato has, and now takes readers on a provocative and entertaining look into the agenda behind TV shows and the resulting trends. Even when it seemed television programming was primarily mindless, there was serious thought behind what audiences were presented. The networks, after all, believe in giving the people what they want, even when the people should have known better. We've spent years of our lives in front of the tube; isn't it about time we found out what makes that tube tick? Retro Active Television will enlighten you.\" -- Marc Cushman (Screenwriter, Author)"
