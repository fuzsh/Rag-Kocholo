However, to be fair, television history is also rife with programs which didn’t quite achieve that same stature, longevity, or level of success. And yet, said shows were still “must-see TV” for a few million viewers each week, and are fondly remembered by them to this day. My purpose in this book is to shed new light upon those short-lived shows which have been shrouded in darkness for way too long. I focus on sitcoms of a very ﬁnite nature—those which lasted a single season. Many of these shows have never been made available for syndication, most haven’t been seen since their initial run, and only a select few have been singled out for release on DVD. If a show was invited back for a second season, no matter how brieﬂy, it will not be included in this volume (examples being Operation: Petticoat; Hey, Jeannie; Doc; The Bill Dana Show; Joe and Valerie; Colonel Humphrey Flack; The Practice; Szysznyk; The Good Guys; Detective School; Happy; Jamie; That’s My Boy; A Date with the Angels; The Corner Bar; Temperature’s Rising; The Governor and J. J.; and Busting Loose). Also missing are the animated sitcoms (even though they all had laugh tracks) such as Where’s Huddles?, Calvin and the Colonel, The Jetsons, Top Cat and Wait ’Til Your Father Gets Home, as well as the British sitcoms Father, Dear Father, Fawlty Towers, and No, Honestly, which I feel should be the subject of their own books. Are the single season sitcoms as historically signiﬁcant as The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Donna Reed Show, Leave It to Beaver, or The Beverly Hillbillies? Certainly not. And yet, as an impressionable youth of the 1960s and 1970s, I ﬁnd that many are permanently and pleasantly ensconced in my own memory banks. Some were my very own brand of “must-see TV,” albeit brieﬂy. My interest in these shows has never waned. Through the years I’ve come to the realization that I am not alone in my eccentric fascination with shows which had a short shelf life on network television. Considering their age, the fact that there are still so many extant episodes of shows many would consider to be “ﬂops” is nothing short of amazing. Oh, the long-running sitcoms will indeed be referenced in this book, but only where historically signiﬁcant. The focus is on their second cousins quickly-removed, the single season sitcoms. These shows came and went very quickly, and yet a choice few served as “stepping stones to stardom” for people like Barbara Billingsley (Professional Father, The Brothers), Natalie Wood (Pride of the Family, Mayor of the Town), Jack Lemmon (Heaven for Betsy, That Wonderful Guy), Marion Ross (Mrs. G. Goes to College), Carol Burnett (Stanley), Judy Carne (Fair Exchange, The Baileys of Balboa, Love on a Rooftop), Jack Klugman (Harris against the World) and Goldie Hawn (Good Morning, World). While very useful and very well-done, books such as The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows, by Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh, Total Television, by Alex McNeil, The Great TV Sitcom Book, by Rick Mitz, and The Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1925 –2010, by Vincent Terrace are limited to very brief entries because of the sheer number of shows covered. Lost Laughs of ’50s and ’60s Television, by David C. Tucker, while very informative, limits 1\n\nPreface\n\n2\n\nits scope to thirty sitcoms. My book takes on the unenviable task of covering every single season sitcom from television’s infancy (1948) through the 1970s (alphabetically). I chose 1948 as the starting point as that was the ﬁrst year the networks had a full slate of prime time programming. A goodly amount of the information in this book has been culled from my large collection of episodes of these hard-to-ﬁnd shows. Many gaps were ﬁlled at the UCLA TV Archives viewing rooms, as well as both of the Paley Centers for Media (New York and Los Angeles). The forum at www.sitcomsonline.com, and Desmond Martin’s “Classic TV Archive” website (www.ctva.biz/) were also useful. Still more valuable and unique information was garnered from interviews with cast members, writers, directors, producers, musicians, guest stars, and others associated with these series. For each of the shows contained in this book there is an overview of what it was all about, where it took place, the characters involved, time slot and network afﬁliation. In most cases, I was also able to supply the name of the production company, a list of important guest stars, directors and writers, sponsors, essential episodic information, and the number of episodes aired vs. number ﬁlmed or videotaped. Where available, cast pictures are included. Here, for the ﬁrst time, is previously unpublished information such as Doc Corkle’s ﬁrst name; Buddy’s real ﬁrst name on Bringing up Buddy; “Spider’s” real ﬁrst name on Karen; Celia’s last name on Stanley; the professional name actress Beverly Garland used on her ﬁrst show called Mama Rosa; Babbo’s real ﬁrst name on Bonino; the role Roger Perry gave up for a starring role in Harrigan and Son; the sponsor of the short-lived Honestly, Celeste; the legendary theme song that was ﬁrst heard on the 1957 sitcom called Sally; the story of how Carl Reiner got the lead role in Good Heavens; the surname of Cadet Monk on McKeever and the Colonel; the only known photograph from the short-lived DuMont series It’s a Business? and dozens upon dozens of more examples. At the end of the alphabetical descriptions of the programs is a litany of interesting lists, breaking the shows down into informative subsets. So whether you’re skimming through the book seeking out your own favorite short-lived sitcoms, or reading it from cover to cover, thank you for a shared interest in television history, and those single season sitcoms.\n\nSingle Season Sitcoms, 1948–1979 Accidental Family A Sheldon Leonard Pro-\n\nwith a small role, he got billing in the credits above other guest stars, but that was understandable—his dad, Joseph Bonaduce, wrote the episode. Actor David Fox, who had a big role in that same episode (Brian, the bossy head of the “junior gargoyles” kid’s club), told me, “I was amazed that Lois Nettleton would rehearse without make-up, and with her hair up in a kerchief. On the day of the ﬁlming, she was beautiful in full make-up, and her hair was done—we almost didn’t recognize her as the same woman.” Even as an 11-year-old boy, he said he realized that “the show wasn’t going to be a hit—it just wasn’t going anywhere.” David also told me that “whenever Sheldon Leonard was around, the entire cast was on its best behavior.” Sheldon made an uncredited cameo appearance in an episode called “The Making of a Vegetarian.” Jackie Joseph guest-starred in the episode titled “Sandy Gets Tough,” and it must have felt like she was surrounded by family because she told me that “Jerry Van Dyke’s manager, Richard Linke, was also my former husband Ken Berry’s manager. There were lots of parties back then—nice times. Dave Ketchum also guest-starred in that episode—he and his wife Louise were our closest friends in the mid sixties.” Directors included Bob Sweeney, William Wiard, and Earl Bellamy; writers included Sydney Zelinka, Treva Silverman, Jim Brooks, Mary Loos, Richard Sale, and Melville Shavelson. Sy Gomberg, who had previously worked on The Law and Mr. Jones, served as producer. Music was provided by Earle Hagen. Several episodes can be viewed in the UCLA TV Archives.\n\nduction. NBC. Friday nights at 9:30. September 15, 1967-January 5, 1968. 16 color episodes were produced with a laugh track. Sponsors included Playtex, Carnation Instant Breakfast, and Hai Karate cologne. This show opened with an animated slot machine and a jazzed-up version of “Old MacDonald Had a Farm” playing during the credits. The original working title was Everywhere a Chick Chick, but it became Accidental Family at the last minute. Jerry Webster, played by Jerry Van Dyke, was a recently widowed Las Vegas performer who got custody of his 8-year-old son, Sandy (Teddy Quinn), with a proviso that he was to secure a “non-show business environment” for the boy. Since Jerry was on the road performing so much, his farm in California’s San Fernando Valley sounded ideal. But on that farm he had a tenant—an attractive divorcee named Sue Kramer (Lois Nettleton) who wouldn’t leave. So a deal was struck that when Jerry was away, she became his son’s ward (and wouldn’t have to pay rent). Her very competitive daughter Tracy lived there, too, and was played by Susan Benjamin. The farm hand was a retired vaudevillian named Ben McGrath (Ben Blue); Jerry’s agent, Marty, was played by Larry D. Mann; and his friend Dewey Davis, an impressionist, was portrayed by John Byner in one of his ﬁrst recurring roles. Notable guest stars included Jim Backus as Uncle Henry in an episode called “What Is This, Thanksgiving or Nightmare?” John Aniston (father of Jennifer) and Ellen Corby appeared together in an episode called “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Playground”; Joyce Van Patten and Herb Edelman (later paired on The Good Guys) were teamed in an episode titled “If You Knew Martha”; and a very young Danny Bonaduce made his TV debut with a minor role in an episode called “Halloween’s on Us.” Even\n\nActor’s Hotel Productions for Television, Inc. ABC. Tuesday nights 10:30. September 25, 1951May 13, 1952. Broadcast live. Sponsored by Ronzoni Macaroni. William Edwards portrayed likable Carlo 3\n\nAdam’s Rib Corelli who, along with his Uncle Antonio (Alan Dale), managed a small boarding house in a rural area. Episodes of this live show involved their dealings with a wide variety of colorful, unpredictable folks (mostly out-of-work actors) who dwelt there. The premise for this show is similar to that of another single season sitcom, Mama Rosa. The program was produced by Carlo DeAngelo; the director was Ted Nathanson; and writers included Flora Frank and John Fleming. To my knowledge, no episodes exist.\n\nAdam’s Rib MGM Studios. ABC. Friday nights 9:30. September 14, 1973-December 28, 1973. 13 color episodes were ﬁlmed without a laugh track. Sponsors included Bristol Myers, Procter and Gamble, and The Gillette Company. With very few exceptions, successful movies didn’t translate well to the small screen—but that didn’t stop TV executives from attempt after attempt. The original 1949 movie version of Adam’s Rib, which starred Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn, was a whopping success. The television version only lasted 13 weeks. Ken Howard and Blythe Danner (Gwyneth Paltrow’s mom) took on the lead roles (as Adam and Amanda Bonner, respectively). He was a young, staid assistant district attorney. She was a maverick junior law partner. They would often meet in the courtroom on opposite sides of a case (and yet they would frequently meet discreetly under a table for a quick kiss or a smile during a trial). They had pet names for one another—sometimes he would call her “Pinkie” and she would call him “Cookie,” and then other times it was the exact opposite. Others in the cast included Dena Dietrich as Amanda’s secretary Grace Peterson; Edward Winter played her law partner Kip Kipple of the Kipple, Kipple and Smith law ﬁrm; Norman Bartold played district attorney Anthony Donahue; and Ron Rifkin was assistant district attorney Roy Mendelsohn. The program had a very large female staff behind-the-scenes, and they were represented in a lot of the episodes (with very noticeable women’s lib undertones). In the episode titled “Illegal Aid,” Amanda was upset about defending a prostitute in the courtroom. Amanda felt that the man involved was just as much to blame in this situation, but it was the woman who was arrested. While doing research on hookers in a seedy bar, Amanda herself was mistakenly arrested for soliciting, and husband Adam had to come to her rescue. In a very special hour-long\n\n4 episode titled “The Unwritten Law,” Adam and Amanda Bonner had their hands full with a case about a cheating husband and the irate wife who shot him. The show’s creator was Peter H. Hunt; the producer was William Froug; directors included Gary Nelson and Hunt; and writers included Peter Stone, Nora Ephron, and George Kirgo. The theme song, “Two People,” was written by Perry Botkin, Jr. and Gil Garﬁeld. A few episodes can be viewed in the UCLA TV Archives.\n\nThe Adventures of Hiram Holliday California National Productions. NBC. Wednesday nights 8:00. October 3, 1956-February 27, 1957. 27 black-and-white episodes were ﬁlmed with a laugh track, but only 20 aired. Sponsors included Jello, and Sanka Brand Coffee. After a nice run on the live sitcom Mr. Peepers, Wally Cox starred in this ﬁlmed sitcom about a polite, mild-mannered little nebbish named Hiram Holliday (based on stories by Paul Gallico) who could do practically anything. The opening credits showed Holliday in a suit of armor, and despite his meek persona, he was a master at fencing, he could also diffuse a bomb, ﬂy a plane, speak almost any language, scuba dive, and dance ﬂamenco. He was an expert on birds, animals, plant life, gems, rocks and art, and only the surface has been scratched. All of these and other amazing talents came into play and were very useful on his free trip around the world. Holliday was awarded this trip and a cash bonus by the newspaper for which he was employed, the New York Chronicle, because as a proofreader for the paper, he caught a misplaced comma in a story which, had it been printed as is, would have brought about a libel suit and cost the company millions. To accompany Holliday on his adventures was Joel Smith (Ainslie Pryor)—a reporter for the newspaper who was to write about each stop. Unfortunately, Joel either just missed each escapade, or had to promise those involved not to print their story. The lack of good stories angered the publisher of the newspaper, Harrison Prentice (Thurston Hall). There was one consistent thread through all of the episodes—Holliday somehow unwittingly became involved in international intrigue, the syndicate, and spy rings. He was also amidst jewel thieves and murderers, but always emerged unscathed (usually with the help of his trusty umbrella). The handle of that same umbrella tapped the inside of our TV sets, attached to a note saying things like, “A moment\n\n5 please—you’ll like what’s next,” just before commercial breaks. Among the episodes available is “Lapidary Wheel,” in which Holliday, on a train bound for Scotland, discovered the body of a passenger from India who had been stabbed alongside a venomous, hissing cobra. Upon alerting the authorities, both the body and cobra mysteriously disappeared. Initially, it was thought that Holliday was losing his marbles, but we would later ﬁnd out the disappearances were related to a valuable missing diamond. In “Sea Cucumber,” Hiram went looking for a rare plant in Hong Kong called the “sea cucumber,” but a spy ring suspected him of sinister intentions (blowing up an ocean liner). Sebastian Cabot appeared in that episode as the nefarious Monsieur Cerveaux (a recurring role). The program was produced by Philip Rapp; writers included Rapp, Joel Malcolm Rapp, Siegfried Herzig, Richard Powell, Bernard Drew, John Kohn and Doris Gilbert; and directors included Rapp, William J. Hole and George Cahan. A few episodes are available on DVD from the Cascadia Company.\n\nThe Adventures of Tugboat Annie Normandie Productions, Inc., Canadian Subsidiary of TPA, Television Programs of America/An Anthony Veiller Production. Filmed in Ontario, Canada. Syndicated. 1958. 39 black-and-white episodes were ﬁlmed with a laugh track. Sponsors included Lever Brothers. The story of Tugboat Annie has a long history. Her adventures were regular features in The Saturday Evening Post written by Norman Reilly Raine. Raine would also go on to write the screenplay for the 1933 Warner Brothers Tugboat Annie movie which starred Marie Dressler and Wallace Beery. There were a few movie sequels, and in 1958, Annie even got her own TV sitcom which opened every week with this dialogue: “Hi, Bullwinkle, you old baboon” (said by Annie), followed by, “Annie Brennan, I’ll get even with you if it takes the rest of my natural life” (said by Bullwinkle). The title of the show was written in letters made to resemble a ship’s rope. Annie was the skipper of a tugboat in the Paciﬁc Northwest named the Narcissus. Bullwinkle’s tugboat was called the Salamander. They were ﬁerce competitors, they fought a lot, and yet down deep they really did like one another. Annie was played by Minerva Urecal, and Captain Horatio Bullwinkle was played by Walter Sande. Each skipper had his or her own crew. Annie’s crew consisted of\n\nAES Hudson Street Don Orlando as Pinto (the cook) and Eric Clavering as Shiftless. Bullwinkle’s helper was Jake, played by James Barron. Episodes include “The Romance of Horatio Bullwinkle,” in which Bullwinkle’s new love interest named Lydia (Charmion King) turned out to be a con artist who, along with her real boyfriend, tried to trick Bullwinkle into transporting their stolen goods. In “Operation: Hotcake,” Annie suggested that timid Pinto ask the big boss Murdock Severn (Stan Francis) for a raise. When the suggestion backﬁred, Pinto decided to go into business for himself by opening his own diner (formerly Fogerty’s Beanery). In “The Sixth Santa,” Annie went all out to convince a fatherless young boy named Georgie Moore (Stephen Barrington) that there really was a Santa Claus, even though his friends tried to convince him otherwise. The program was produced by Leon Fromkess; writers included Milton Pascal, Earl Baldwin, Maurice Richlin, Fred Fox, Joel Rapp, Bill Freedman, and Larry Rhine; and directors included Leo Goodwins and Sam Newﬁeld. The theme song was the old traditional maritime classic “Sailor’s Hornpipe.” Several episodes are available for viewing at the Paley Center for Media.\n\nAES Hudson Street The Triseme Corporation/Four D Productions. ABC. Thursday nights 9:30. March 23, 1978-April 20, 1978. Seven episodes were videotaped before a live audience, only ﬁve aired. After successful supporting roles in Sanford and Son and Barney Miller, Gregory Sierra was tapped for his own sitcom. From Four D Productions, who gave us Barney Miller, came AES Hudson Street (AES meant Ambulance Emergency Service). Sierra portrayed frenzied Dr. Tony Menzies—the chief resident at a cash-strapped emergency ward in a rundown area of Hudson Street in New York City. J. Powell Karbo (Stefan Gierasch) was the difﬁcult hospital administrator; Dr. Glick (Allan Miller) was the hospital’s shrink; Rosa Santiago (Rosana DeSoto) was a nurse; Newton (Ray Stewart) was a male nurse; Foshko and Stanke (Susan Peretz and Ralph Manza, respectively) were ambulance workers; and Dr. Jerry Mackler (Bill Cort) was a surgeon. Episodes include one in which a schizophrenic man attempted to blend in with the staff, posing as a doctor. In another untitled episode, a blackout came at the most inopportune time— a woman was about to give birth, and a South\n\nAll’s Fair African man had a badly infected leg. In still another untitled episode, Tony found out that he was being considered for an administrative hospital job in beautiful Honolulu. The program was produced by Roland Kibbee; the executive producer and creator was Danny Arnold; writers included Arnold, Chris Hayward and Tony Sheehan; and directors included Noam Pitlik. Music was provided by Jack Elliott and Allyn Ferguson.\n\nAll’s Fair T. A. T. Communications. CBS. Monday nights 9:30. September 20, 1976-August 15, 1977. 24 episodes were videotaped before a live audience at KTTV Studios. Sitcom veteran Richard Crenna returned to prime time in this very topical, very political show set in Washington, D. C., which revolved around the problems of a May/December romance. Crenna portrayed political columnist Richard C. Barrington—age 49; and Bernadette Peters made her series debut as the “May” part of that romance—23-year-old Charlotte “Charley” Drake, a freelance photographer. He was very conservative, she was extremely liberal, and yet the romance worked. There were, however, numerous ﬂare-ups between them over politics, age, and marriage. Allen Brooks ( J. A. Preston) was Richard’s equally conservative African American assistant; Lucy Daniels (Lee Chamberlain) was Allen’s girlfriend and also a CBS News reporter; Ginger Livingston ( Judy Kahan) was Charley’s roommate, who was romantically involved with a married congressman; and Senator Wayne Joplin ( Jack Dodson) was a liberal friend of Richard’s who often sided with Charley. The show took a new direction midstream, as Richard became a special assistant to President Carter, and Ginger became his secretary. At that point, a new character, Lanny Wolf (Michael Keaton), was added as President Carter’s aide and joke writer. Episodes include “Strange Bedfellows,” in which Charley attempted to chronicle an average day in Richard’s life, but it turned out to be anything but average; in “Presidential Request,” Charley was outraged and dubbed Richard a sellout when he edited one of his articles to please President Carter; and in “Jealousy,” Richard was the jealous one when Charley allowed an old beau to brieﬂy stay in her apartment. Turnabout was fair play when Charley was jealous of Richard’s reunion with a French girl named Desiree (Andra Akers) in an episode titled “Remembrance.”\n\n6 The program was produced by Norman Lear; the creators included Rod Parker, Bob Schiller and Bob Weiskopf; writers included Parker, Albert E. Lewin, Howard Ostroff, Sybil Adelman, Michael Elias, Michael Loman, Tom Whedon, Bud Wiser, Don Hinkley, Ron Friedman, Peter Gallay, Dixie Brown Grossman and Robert Van Scoyk; and directors included Bob Claver and Hal Cooper. Richard Crenna later starred in yet another single season sitcom—It Takes Two, on which he was paired with Patty Duke.\n\nAngel Burlingame Productions/Desilu Studios. CBS. Thursday nights 9:00 (October 6, 1960December 1960), and Thursday nights 8:00 ( January 1961-April 1961), and Wednesday nights 9:00 (April 1961-September 30, 1961). 33 blackand-white episodes were ﬁlmed before a live audience. Sponsors included Post Cereals and Johnson’s Wax. Not to be confused with the later David Boreanaz show of same name, this was the sitcom called Angel. Angel was short for Angelique. Angelique was a young French girl (Annie Farge, who had understudied in the Broadway play The World of Susie Wong) who had recently married a successful American architect named John Smith (whom she called Johnny), played by Marshall Thompson (later of Daktari). He called her “Angel” most of the time (sometimes “Annie”), but it was always “Angelique” when he was angry. And he often had good reasons to be quite angry—Angel was very stubborn, and she had a ﬁery French temper (and a thick French accent). Most episodes revolved around her trouble with the English language and American customs. The Smiths set up house in Los Angeles, next door to future good friends George and Susie Carpenter (Don Keefer and Doris Singleton, respectively). Hanley Stafford played Johnny’s boss, Mr. Corwin, and Bella Bruck had a very funny recurring role as neighbor and friend, Mrs. Spiegelman. When the series began, the couple was already married. However, in a ﬂashback episode called “The Wedding,” we saw Angelique coming over on the boat to meet Johnny on their scheduled wedding day. After vouching for and sponsoring a couple of shady Hungarian men so the men could leave the ship, Angelique was then unable to ﬁnd her own passport and had to remain on board until it was found. All was well much later when she recalled that the passport\n\n7\n\nAnother Day\n\nwas sewn into her coat so that she wouldn’t lose it. This delay, however, caused her to miss the wedding. Meanwhile, something even worse had occurred—Johnny had been drowning his sorrows with the two Hungarian men, and was in no condition to be married. Somehow, Annie and the Hungarians propped Johnny up long enough for him to say his “I do” in front of a justice of the peace. Only moments later, he collapsed on the ﬂoor and spent his wedding night there. Guest stars included James Garner as himself in “The French Lesson.” Former Three Stooges member Joe Besser appeared in an episode called “The Museum.” Child actor Johnny Eimen was also in that episode and he told me, “Joe Besser was even funnier off camera than he was on camera.” However, Eimen also let me know that he himself was “scared to death of the live audience. Every sitcom I’d done up to that point had used a laugh track.” Joseph Kearns guest starred in “Voting Can Be Fun,” in which voting booths were set up in the Smith household; Alan Reed (Fred Flintstone) guested in “The Goat Dog” as zoning commissioner Stanley Pritchard who was attempting to get rid of Angel’s pet goat, which she was trying to pass off as a dog; Gale Gordon was Mr. Johnson in “Unpopular Mechanics,” in which Angel and Susie tried to repair an expensive and rare automobile, only to take the whole thing apart; and Mel Blanc made a cameo appearance in “Annie’s Temper.” Angelique always believed people were inherently good and trustworthy, but she got burned for her naïveté in “The Honest Man,” in which she posted a not-vague-enough ad in the newspaper about money she found in the grocery store parking lot. The ad led to numerous opportunists cashing in at the Smith’s front door. Most of the 33 episodes were directed by Ezra Stone, Lamont Johnson, or Jess Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer created the show and also wrote many episodes. Being a Desilu show, much of the transitional music between scenes is very similar to that used in other Desilu shows, including I Love Lucy, December Bride, and Those Whiting Girls.\n\nwith all of that history and success, somehow the TV sitcom version fell ﬂat. The title for the pilot was Anna and the King of Siam, much like the original Margaret Landon novel on which all versions were based. However, once it became a series, the title was shortened to Anna and the King. Yul Brynner reprised his role as stubborn King Mongkut. In the Anna Owens role was Samantha Eggar, hired as personal educator to the King’s many children. Anna had a child of her own—a 12-year-old son named Louis (Eric Shea) who came with his mother to live in Siam. Louis was able to handle himself very well in a ﬁght, and even gave a black eye to Crown Prince Chulalongkorn (Brian Tochi), which was a crime punishable by death—but luckily the charge didn’t stick. Anna proved to be as headstrong as the King, and wasn’t afraid to stand up to him and give her opinions, while others around her merely cowered or ran away. While the two lead characters did indeed have many conﬂicts, there arose a mutual respect and friendship (the King liked “skinny women”). The Anna Owens character was based upon the real-life experiences of Anna Leonowens. In the debut episode, Anna had signed an agreement to become the children’s teacher (replacing the King’s right-hand man, Kralahome, played by Keye Luke). There was an immediate breach of contract, however (the King demanded that Anna and her son live inside the palace, even though they were promised a house of their own). Just as Anna and Louis were ready to leave because of the breach, the King softened, agreed to the house, and the Owens family stayed. The program was produced by Bill Idelson; Gene Reynolds served as executive producer; writers included Bill Idelson, Harvey Miller, Lester and Tina Pine, Austin and Irma Kalish, Jim Fritzell, Jerry Mayer, Gene Thompson and Maurice Richlin; and directors included E.W. Swackhamer, Jeff Corey, Lee Philips, Michael Gordon, James Sheldon, Hy Averback, Terry Becker, Jack Donohue, and William Wiard. The theme music was by Jerry Goldsmith and Richard Shores.\n\nAnna and the King 20th Century–Fox. CBS. Sunday nights 7:30. September 17, 1972-December 31, 1972. 13 color episodes were ﬁlmed with a laugh track. The 1952 Broadway musical The King and I won a Tony; the 1956 movie musical version garnered Yul Brynner an Academy Award. Even\n\nAnother Day The Komack Company. CBS. Saturday nights 9:00. April 8, 1978-April 29, 1978. 13 episodes were videotaped before a live audience, only four aired. When Rhoda and Joe’s divorce became ﬁnal, David Groh was free to pursue other interests. CBS gave him a starring role in this ex-\n\nApartment 3 –C tremely short-lived sitcom from James Komack. Another Day was an attempt to showcase a new trend toward two-income families. Groh was cast as Don Gardner—a Los Angeles ad executive; Joan Hackett was his wife, Ginny, who worked for an insurance company; and Hope Summers played Don’s overbearing, meddling mother, Olive, who minded the kids while the couple was at work. Al Eisenmann portrayed painfully shy 11-year-old son Mark, and Lisa Lindgren played outgoing 16-year-old daughter, Kelly. The program was produced by Paul Mason and George Kirgo; the executive producer and creator was James Komack; writers included Charlie Hauck, Dinah Kirgo, Julie Kirgo, Carl Kleinschmidt, Bill Taub, and Lynn Phillips; and directors included Hal Cooper, Nick Havinga, Gary Shimokawa, Burt Brinckerhoff, and James Komack. Paul Williams performed and composed the theme song. David Groh died at the age of 69 early in 2008.\n\nApartment 3-C A Harvey Marlowe Production. First-run syndication. 1949. Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights 7:15. A 15-minute live show. This live early sitcom originated from WOR–TV in New York. This was the story of a couple of newlyweds—John and Barbara Gay (as themselves), who resided at 46 Perry Street in New York City in apartment 3-C. This was one of those seminal shows which helped set the standard for husband and wife sitcoms for decades. John Gay wrote every episode and, after a few months, his ideas began to dry up, and the ratings began to suffer. This was good practice for John, who later wrote episodes of Lux Video Theater, Playhouse 90, Kraft Television Theater, and The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters. For the silver screen, he was a contract writer for Run Silent, Run Deep and The Courtship of Eddie’s Father. In the October 22, 1949, edition of Billboard Magazine, the program was reviewed this way: “It’s a standard domestic situation comedy, well produced, with Barbara and John Gay. Direction, though, was bad. Both Gays spoke so loudly and so quickly that neither could be understood. Both walked on one another’s lines.” To my knowledge, no episodes exist.\n\nApple Pie T. A. T. Communications. ABC. Saturday nights 8:30. September 23, 1978-September 30, 1978. Seven episodes were videotaped\n\n8 at Metromedia Studios before a live audience, only two aired. The premise of this show sounded very promising and intriguing. Contrary to the old adage, “you can’t pick your family,” Ginger-Nell Hollyhock (Rue McClanahan) did just that. In the heart of the depression year of 1933, on Morning Glory Road in Kansas City, GingerNell placed an ad in the classiﬁeds to “assemble a family.” What she got was a houseful of zanies. Her husband “Fast Eddie” Barnes (Dabney Coleman) was a con man; her daughter was a tap dancer named Anna Marie (Caitlin O’Heaney); her son, Junior (Derrel Maury), wanted nothing more than to be a bird; and Grandpa ( Jack Gilford) was blind and very cranky. Qualifying as one of Norman Lear’s biggest ﬂops, seven episodes were videotaped but only two ever aired. Those two were the pilot and “Fast Eddie Slows Down.” Episode titles for those left in the can are “Ginger-Nell Goes Hollywood,” “Rich Man, Poor Girl,” “Ginger-Nell Loses Her Touch,” “A Man from Ginger-Nell’s Past,” and “They Walk Among Us.” The program was produced by Charlie Hauck; the creator was Norman Lear; writers included Sy Rosen, Arthur Julian, Bill Davenport, Charlie Hauck, Lawrence J. Cohen, and Fred Freeman; and the director of all episodes was Peter Bonerz. Apple Pie was loosely based upon a book called Nourish the Beast by Steve Tesich, who would later go on to win an Academy Award for Best Screenplay for Breaking Away.\n\nThe Associates John Charles Walters Productions/Paramount Studios. ABC. Sundays 8:30 (September 23, 1979-October 28, 1979), and Thursday nights 9:30 (March 27, 1980-April 17, 1980). 13 episodes were ﬁlmed before a live audience, only nine aired. This highly-touted sitcom came from the same folks who had given us Taxi. Critics loved it, but it was a colossal ﬂop with viewers. This was the story of three young law graduates who had just become part of the big Wall Street law ﬁrm of Bass and Marshall. Big-hearted Leslie Dunn (Alley Mills) was of working class stock and had a huge soft spot for the oppressed; Tucker Kerwin (Martin Short) was a bit nerdy and naïve, and yet quite charming; Sara James (Shelley Smith) was from Boston and was tall, blonde, sexy, bright and very conﬁdent. She was usually the target of the overtly testosteroneladen mailroom boy named Johnny Danko (Tim\n\n9 Thomerson). The ﬁrm’s obnoxious kiss-up of a junior partner was Elliott Streeter ( Joe Regalbuto), and the daft and forgetful Senior Partner was Emerson Marshall (British character actor Wilfrid Hyde-White). Episodes include “Elliott’s Deadly Serve,” in which the law ﬁrm was about to change its name to Bass, Marshall and Milestone—Mr. Milestone (William Prince) was to become a partner in the ﬁrm. The ever-opportunistic Elliott had done vast amounts of research on the man, and knew that he had a penchant for the game of squash. Elliott then challenged Milestone to a no-holds-barred game with a $135 bet, only to see the elderly gentleman die of a heart attack on the court. This particular episode was the ﬁfth episode of the series. Immediately after it aired, ABC put the show on hiatus until late March when another four new episodes debuted (now on Thursday nights). The show once again failed to catch on, and the remaining four episodes were kept in the can (guest stars included Georgia Engel and Danny DeVito). The program was developed by Michael Leeson; the executive producers were James L. Brooks, Stan Daniels, Charlie Hauck and Ed Weinberger; writers included John Steven Owen; and directors included Tony Mordente. The show’s theme song, “Wall Street Blues,” was written by A. Brooks, and performed by blues legend B.B. King. The Associates was loosely based upon the book of same name by John Jay Osborn, Jr. Reruns, as well as previously unaired episodes, were brieﬂy syndicated on the long-defunct cable channel, Entertainment.\n\nBaby, I’m Back Charles Fries Productions/ Lila Garrett Productions/Dewil Productions, Inc. CBS. Monday nights 8:30. January 30, 1978-August 12, 1978. 12 episodes were recorded before a live audience. After leaving Sanford and Son in a salary dispute (after six seasons), Demond Wilson came back in Baby, I’m Back. His return to television was short-lived. The story took place in a tough neighborhood on Richmond Drive in Washington, D.C. Demond portrayed Ray Ellis, a man who had abandoned his family seven years earlier and headed to sunny California. In the opening credits, his character, Ray Ellis, said his reason for leaving was that he “was supporting one wife, two kids, and three bookies—then one day my luck ran out, and like any right-thinking horse player, I ran with it.” Yes, Ray had a gambling\n\nThe Baileys of Balboa problem and owed a lot of people a lot of money. While away, his lovely wife Olivia (Denise Nicholas) had him declared legally dead, raised their two children Jordan (Tony Holmes) and Angie (Kim Fields), and hooked up with a new beau named Colonel Wallace Dickey (Ed Hall). Upon hearing of Olivia’s upcoming nuptials to Colonel Dickey, Ray suddenly returned to try to erase the past, halt the marriage, and prove he was the better father. In fact, he moved directly upstairs from Olivia (she was in apartment 1A, and he was in 2A). His biggest obstacle in picking up where he had left off was his acerbic mother-in-law Luzelle Carter (Helen Martin). In the opening credits, Ray stated, “Luzelle is French for killer. The day she moved in with us, the rats moved next door.” Episodes of note included “Pay or Die,” in which Ray was threatened by loan sharks who demanded payment or else. We found out later in the episode that the thugs were hired by Luzelle to give him a good scare, and hopefully put an end to his gambling problem. In “Olivia’s Job Offer,” the newly reunited family was on the verge of being separated once again as Olivia debated accepting a job offer on Guam. In “Survival of the Fittest,” the relationship between Ray and Luzelle turned even frostier as they found themselves stranded together in a blizzard. The program was created by Lila Garrett and Mort Lachman; producers included Sandy Krinski and Chet Dowling; writers included David Garber, Lila Garrett, Dowling, George Geiger, Kevin Hartigan, April Kelly, Lachman, Marion Freeman, Krinski, Bill Persky, April Kelly, and Mark Evanier; and directors included Dick Harwood, Mark Warren, and Nick Havinga. Music was provided by Jeff Berry. Reruns were shown on the BET Network.\n\nThe Baileys of Balboa Antelo Productions, Inc./Grandandy Productions, Inc./Richelieu Productions, Inc. CBS. Thursday nights 9:30. September 24, 1964-April 1, 1965. 26 black-andwhite episodes were ﬁlmed at CBS Studio City with a laugh track. Sponsors included Reynolds Metals, American Home Products, and Philip Morris Cigarettes. Keefe Brasselle was the executive producer (Richelieu Productions) for three single season shows which were greenlighted without pilot episodes—The Cara Williams Show, The Reporter, and this one, The Baileys of Balboa. It featured Paul Ford as widower Sam Bailey who owned the\n\nBall Four Island Princess (with CF 2122 AW on its side), a decrepit charter ﬁshing boat at Bailey’s Landing in Balboa Beach, California. Director Bruce Bilson told me, “They were looking for ocean front property for the series, and found it next to the Balboa Yacht Club, where they got permission to build a pier for location shoots.” The Balboa Yacht Club, headed by Commander Cecil Wyntoon ( John Dehner), considered the Island Princess an eyesore. Wyntoon did everything in his power to get the Baileys to leave. Yes, there were more Baileys—Sam’s beachcomber son, Jim (Les Brown, Jr.), and an occasional visitor such as genius cousin Chester Bailey (Michael J. Pollard). Sam’s best friend of 15 years was the inept and forgetful shipmate Buck Singleton (Sterling Holloway). Buck, however, was a very good cook, known for his pancakes. Neighbor kid, Stanley, was played by Clint Howard. To break up the all-male cast, Judy Carne was given a recurring role as Commander Wyntoon’s daughter Barbara—a love interest for young Jim Bailey (but she wasn’t in every episode). It was this romance which rendered the rift between Sam Bailey and Cecil Wyntoon a bit more civil. Also appearing frequently was John Banner as Hans, who worked for Wyntoon at the Yacht Club. Episodes include “Sam and the Invisible Man,” with guest star Raquel Welch as Beverly Johnson, a Yacht Club beauty pageant contestant who got engaged to cousin Chester. Cecil Wyntoon was dead set against the engagement and tried to get Chester sent back to his home in Muncie, Indiana. Chester then had them believing that he had created a potion in his lab which made him invisible so that they couldn’t send him home. This episode was directed by Bruce Bilson, who told me, “This was a very important show— it started my directorial career. Producer Bob Sweeney was my mentor.” Dick Gautier guest starred as Tani in the episode titled, “To Sam, He’s a Swimmer.” Dick recalled, “I was never really much of a swimmer. I got to use my friend Peter Marshall’s pool to rehearse in. I got diving down pretty well, but I had some trouble treading water. Somehow, with camera trickery, we managed to pull it off pretty well.” The program was produced by Bob Sweeney. Bruce Bilson remembered, “Antelo Productions was named for the street on which Sweeney lived.” Writers included Sid Morse and Arthur Julian; directors included Gary Nelson, Charles Barton, and Bruce Bilson. Bruce told me, “Because of this series, I’m still into boating to this\n\n10 very day.” The Baileys of Balboa was pummeled in the ratings by Peyton Place on ABC and Hazel on NBC.\n\nBall Four CBS. Wednesday nights 8:30. September 22, 1976-October 27, 1976. Seven episodes were videotaped before a live audience in New York City, only ﬁve aired. Based upon the very successful Jim Bouton book of the same name, CBS brought the sitcom version of Ball Four to its Wednesday night lineup in the fall of 1976, albeit brieﬂy. The program had the ideal time slot, tucked between Good Times and All in the Family. However, it only lasted ﬁve weeks. This was the story of relief pitcher Jim Barton ( Jim Bouton) who wore number 56 on his jersey and played for the Washington Americans baseball team (likely a play on the hapless and defunct Washington Senators). Also in the cast were number 41 Coach Pinky Pinkney (Bill McCutcheon); number 37 (the manager) Cap Capograsso ( Jack Somack); the massive and short-tempered Rhino Rhinelander (Ben Davidson)—the bullpen catcher who had a very soft spot for his mother; Lenny “Birdman” Siegel (who was always in the tub), played by Lenny Schultz (Gary Sandy in the unaired pilot); number 18 Rayford Plunkett who loved country music (Marco St. John); the oft-injured utility inﬁelder Orlando Lopez ( Jaime Tirelli); David James Carroll as rookie pitcher Bill Westlake; and outﬁelder C. B. “Cool Breeze” Travis (Sam Wright). Most of the action took place in the locker room. Because of its time slot (within the family hour), the sensors were very strict about what the guys could and couldn’t say, and realism suffered in the G-rated locker room dialogue. In the unaired pilot episode, Jim Barton was upset by cutbacks—the guys could only take three-minute showers, they assumed responsibility for lost baseballs and broken bats, and injured players were being denied coverage. The team held an election for a player representative and it went down to the wire between Plunkett and Barton, with Rhino casting the winning ballot for Barton. The program was produced by Don Segall; creators and writers included Jim Bouton, Marvin Kitman and Vic Ziegel; and directors included Noam Pitlik, Jay Sandrich, Peter Lewis, and Nick Havinga. Joe Raposo composed the theme, which was performed by Harry Chapin. Ball Four was one of only a handful of sitcoms produced in New York in the 1970s. The unaired\n\n11 pilot episode can be viewed at the Paley Center for Media.\n\nBarefoot in the Park Paramount Studios. ABC. Thursday nights 9:00. September 24, 1970-January 14, 1971. 12 color episodes were ﬁlmed with a laugh track. Sponsors included American Brands, General Foods, Lever Brothers, and Warner Lambert. On September 24, 1970, two hit Neil Simon plays which became hit Neil Simon movies debuted in sitcom form. The one at 9:30 (The Odd Couple) quickly settled in for a ﬁve-season run. The one which preceded it on Thursday nights on ABC only ran for 12 weeks—it was the TV adaptation of Barefoot in the Park, which starred Jane Fonda and Robert Redford on the silver screen. The 1969 TV pilot episode had a white cast and had been an episode of Love, American Style titled “Love and the Good Deal” (Skye Aubrey as Corey and Philip Clark as Paul). The series, however, was done with an African American cast, and Tracy Reed and Scoey Mitchlll (yes, he spelled it with three “Ls”) were the stars (as Corie and Paul Bratter, respectively). The Bratters were newlyweds, married only three weeks, and living in a run-down one room walk-up on the top ﬂoor of an old brownstone in lower Manhattan on West 10th Street. Paul Bratter had just landed a job (after six years of law school) at the prestigious ﬁrm of Kendricks, Keene and Klein (leading to several KKK jokes). Paul’s immediate boss, Arthur Kendricks, was played by Harry Holcombe; Vito Scotti portrayed the building’s klutzy superintendent, Mr. Velasquez; and Nipsey Russell played a friend of the Bratter’s named Honey Robinson, who was the proprietor of Honey Robinson’s Pool and Billiard Emporium. Honey had a crush on Corie’s sassy widowed mom, Mabel Bates (Thelma Carpenter), who was a maid for a wealthy Park Avenue family. In the debut, Paul reluctantly agreed to help out Corie and her mom at a posh dinner party. He later regretted this decision when Arthur Kendricks from his law ﬁrm showed up as a guest, and saw Paul serving food and drinks. Familiar sitcom faces Agnes Moorehead and Herbert Rudley guest starred in that debut. Other guest stars included Penny Marshall in “In Sickness and in Health;” Cindy Williams in “The Marriage Proposal;” boxing legend Sugar Ray Robinson in “Down with the Landlord;” and Huntz Hall and Jackie Coogan in “Disorder in the Court.”\n\nThe Betty Hutton Show The program was produced by William P. D’Angelo, and devised for TV by Bill Idelson and Harvey Miller; writers included Idelson, Miller, Jerry Belson, Garry Marshall, Susan Harris, William S. Bickley, Charles Shyer, Alan Mandel, Stanley Ross, Richard DeRoy, Jack Winter, David Ketchum, and Bruce Shelly; and directors included Bruce Bilson, Jerry Paris, and Charles R. Rondeau. Music was provided by Neil Hefti. The theme song was performed by Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductee, Darlene Love. Ten of the 12 episodes were rerun as part of Love, American Style’s 1971-1972 season. Cecil Smith of the Los Angeles Times called Barefoot in the Park “funny, young, bright, and quite delicious.” One episode aired on TV Land.\n\nThe Betty Hutton Show (a.k.a. Goldie) Desilu Studios/A Hutton Production. CBS. Thursday nights 8:00. October 1, 1959-June 30, 1960. 30 black-and-white episodes were ﬁlmed with a laugh track. Sponsors included Post Cereal and General Foods. The actress most famous for The Greatest Show on Earth and Annie Get Your Gun took a stab at TV stardom in this eponymous series, sometimes called Goldie. Goldie Appleby was a former showgirl-turned-manicurist-turned-legal guardian. She was mentioned in the will of one of her customers, a Mr. Strickland, who passed away suddenly. In fact, she got everything in the will—the estate (a Park Avenue duplex), and also Mr. Strickland’s three children: Roy, the youngest, who attended the Ezra Taft Preparatory Day School for Boys (Dennis Joel); Pat, the artist (Gigi Perrault); and Nicky, who loved sports cars (Richard Miles). Goldie also inherited the family’s lawyer Howard Seaton (Tom Conway, the actor who made another Tom Conway become Tim Conway). Goldie’s attempts to adjust to her newfound wealth, status, and three children were at times overwhelming. Whenever things were going well, however, Goldie would utter the word “cu-cu.” Goldie’s former roommates (appearing occasionally) were Lorna ( Joan Shawlee) and Rosemary ( Jean Carson). Episodes include “Art for Goldie’s Sake,” in which Goldie urged Pat to take up a hobby. Pat took Goldie’s suggestion a bit too seriously, and moved into a Greenwich Village apartment to study art amidst an amusing array of beatniks. Goldie kept tabs on Pat, however, by donning a long black wig and mixing in with the younger generation and their bohemian ways. In “Gullible\n\nThe Betty White Show Goldie,” the sob story of a crooked elderly couple posing as down-and-out managers of a children’s home, got Goldie in gear to raise money for them. Even the kids from the home were in on the ruse. Guest stars included a very young Don Grady as Joey Simpson who started a school ﬁght with Roy in the episode titled “Roy Runs Away;” Dennis Hopper portrayed Mike in the aptly titled “Goldie Meets Mike;” Phil Harris was Colonel Barker (an Elvis Presley send-off ) in the episode called “Rock and Roll;” and Cesar Romero played himself in the episode called “Goldie Without Men.” The program was produced by William Harmon; the creator was Stanley Roberts; directors included Jodie Copeland, Richard Kinon, Jerry Hopper, and Robert Sidney; and writers included Laurence Marks, Ed Jurist, Marvin Marx, Terry Ryan, Edward Ludwig, Jack Wilson, Bob Kaufman, Ralph Goodman, Philip Lloyd, and Kip King. The theme song (during which, the letters in the name “Goldie” descended a large spiral staircase) was written by Jerry Fielding. Several episodes can be viewed in the UCLA TV Archives.\n\n12\n\nThe Betty White Show MTM Productions. CBS. Monday nights 9:00 (September 12, 1977November 14, 1977), and 9:30 (December 12, 1977-January 9, 1978). 14 episodes were videotaped before a live audience at CBS Studio Center. This was the third time The Betty White Show was used as a program title—ﬁrst in 1954 on her daytime show, then on her 1958 prime time comedy/variety show, and once more in 1977 following a successful run on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. This new show was also an MTM production, and another MTM alumnus, Georgia Engel, came along for the short ride. Georgia played Mitzi Maloney, Joyce Whitman’s (Betty’s) best friend and roommate. Joyce ﬁrst met Mitzi at the unemployment ofﬁce (Mitzi worked there, but was now, ironically, laid off ). Here Betty portrayed a divorced, out-of-work actress with limited ability who got a break by being cast in a pilot episode for a possible series to be called Undercover Woman (somewhat of a parody of Angie Dickinson’s Police Woman). Just as things were looking up for Joyce, she got word that her ex-husband, the emotionless John Elliott ( John Hillerman), would be directing the series.\n\nThe Betty White Show—John Hillerman and Betty White (CBS).\n\n13 Even with their unceasing animosity for one another (she called him “pickle-puss” and made sport of his mustache), they agreed to work together amicably. It’s interesting to note that Joyce was making the pilot episode of Undercover Woman for CBS. While ﬁlming the pilot for this “show-within-the-show,” Joyce began to have feelings for John once again. When those feelings weren’t reciprocated it led to a funny scene in which Joyce, in a ﬁt of rage, destroyed all of the props on the set (most were irreplaceable). Others in the cast included Barney Phillips as Fletcher Huff, the nervous, insecure actor who portrayed the police chief on Joyce’s show. Caren Kaye was Joyce’s sexy and dimwitted co-star, Tracy Garrett—but that character’s name was Lisa Vincent (played by Carla Borelli) in the debut episode. Caren Kaye didn’t recall why that change was made, but told me, “I was working mostly for Paramount and Garry Marshall at that time, so perhaps great timing came into play.” Also in the cast were Charles Cyphers as Joyce’s “male stunt double” Hugo Muncy (he donned a dress and wig); and Alex Henteloff as Doug Porterﬁeld, a CBS Network liaison assigned to the series (his ofﬁcial title was Vice President in charge of prime time dramatic development, although prior to this he had been working in the mailroom). He was weak, ineffective, and never taken seriously. Undercover Woman became a series, and the love/hate relationship between Joyce and John was fodder for the remaining episodes of The Betty White Show. The program was created by Ed Weinberger and Stan Daniels (who also served as executive producers); the producer was Bob Ellison; writers included David Lloyd; and directors included Bill Persky, Doug Rogers, Harvey Medlinsky, Burt Brinckerhoff, James Burrows, Jay Sandrich, and Noam Pitlik. Music was provided by Dick DeBenedictis. Betty White would later have a long run in The Golden Girls, she’d host an episode of Saturday Night Live, and star in a new sitcom for TV Land called Hot in Cleveland. Caren Kaye’s memories of her co-stars are: “Love Betty White, and learned so much from this show, as well as John Hillerman. Georgia Engel is really that kind and sweet—a pure soul.” The program was rerun on Nick at Nite.\n\nThe Bickersons First-run syndication. 19511952. The Bickersons originated on radio and starred Frances Langford as the long-suffering\n\nThe Bickersons Blanche Bickerson and Don Ameche as her harried husband of too many unpleasant years, John Bickerson. This couple truly lived up to their surname—they bickered constantly. Unlike The Honeymooners who did indeed ﬁght a lot (and yet displayed great love and admiration for one another), the Bickersons’ love was rarely obvious. When The Bickersons came to TV, they were originally seen as a semi-regular live feature on the DuMont Network’s Star Time series. Frances Langford reprised her role as Blanche, but now in the role of John was comic Lew Parker (later Lew Marie on That Girl). These episodes are grainy kinescopes, most take place in the couple’s drab and barren bedroom (twin beds, or course), and most are about 17 minutes in length. The Bickersons did become a weekly single season syndicated ﬁlmed series in 1951, and again starred Lew Parker as John, but now Virginia Grey was Blanche (a prettier Blanche with less of an edge). These episodes are sometimes called It’s The Bickersons, and the opening credits featured two birds on a perch squawking at one another. The couple resided in apartment number 22, and had a cat named Nature Boy. Also in the cast were Blanche’s judgmental sister next door on Englewood Drive, Clara Gollup (Lois Austin), and her brother-in-law Barney Gollup (Sam Lee), who could never quite satisfy his appetite for food or gambling. These episodes were written and directed by Phil Rapp and produced by Jack Denove. Unlike the live episodes from Star Time, in these episodes the couple occasionally left the bedroom. They still threw barbs at one another on a consistent basis, but there was a palpable softening of the two main characters. This syndicated version of The Bickersons only lasted one season, but the story doesn’t end there. These unhappily marrieds surfaced as a semi-regular erratically-timed feature on variety shows through 1953—still with Lew Parker as John, but now with Betty Kean as Blanche. Sadly, it seems none of the Betty Kean episodes have survived. The Star Time kinescopes of The Bickersons, and the ﬁlmed syndicated single season sitcom series as It’s The Bickersons, are available in very inexpensive DVD box sets, which are available through the website www.bickersons.com. Common threads through all of the many incarnations of The Bickersons include his snoring, her mother, his drinking, her cooking, his cheapness, and her spending.\n\nBig Eddie\n\n14\n\nBig Eddie Persky/Denoff Productions. CBS. Saturday nights 8:30 (August 23, 1975-September 6, 1975), and Friday nights 8:00 (September 19, 1975-November 7, 1975). Ten color episodes were videotaped before a live audience at KTLA Stage Five. How ironic that Sheldon Leonard, who produced so many hit TV shows, was himself the star of such a colossal ﬂop. It seemed like the ideal vehicle for him, as he had a real knack for portraying New Yorkers, tough guys, and gangsters. As “Big Eddie” Smith, he was the owner and promoter of the Big E Sports Arena. A reformed gambler who had gone legit, he was seeking culture, intellect and better manners. He played a tough guy on the show, but it was often very evident that he had a soft side, too. His new wife, Honey Smith (Sheree North), had a colorful past; she was an ex-stripper. Together they resided on East 56th Street in Manhattan. Quinn Cummings played their perky granddaughter, Ginger; Billy Sands played Monte “Bang Bang” Valentine, the Smith’s cook; Alan Oppenheimer, who had previously played an accountant on He and She, played Big Eddie’s accountant and brother, Jessie Smith; and Ralph Wilcox was an African American employee of Eddie’s named Raymond McKay. The program got a jump on the fall TV season with an early start on Saturday nights beginning in late August of 1975, but when the program was placed into its regular Friday night slot against Sanford and Son, it spelled doom.\n\nEpisodes include “One Nation Invisible,” in which Eddie and his granddaughter ﬁled suit against a store who sold them a defective toy; in “Too Many Grandmothers,” Big Eddie’s ﬁrst wife (Eva Gabor) made a surprise visit and instantly locked horns with Honey; in “One of Our Red Shoes Is Missing,” the Smith family almost incited an international incident when they gave safe harbor to a defecting Soviet dancer. The program was created by Bill Persky and Sam Denoff; it was produced and directed by Hy Averback.\n\nBig John, Little John Redwood Productions and D’Angelo-Bullock-Allen Productions/NBC. Saturday mornings. September 11, 1976-September 3, 1977. 13 episodes were ﬁlmed with a laugh track. Once again, the great Sherwood Schwartz made the unbelievable very fun and funny. This was the story of a 45-year-old junior high school science teacher (Herb Edelman as “Big” John Martin) who, while on a vacation in Florida at Ponce DeLeon Park, drank a small handful of water from the same “fountain of youth” for which Ponce DeLeon had been searching. The tiny amount of water he consumed caused him to frequently change back into a youthful 12year-old John Martin (“Little” John, portrayed by Robbie Rist). The change, however, occurred at the most inopportune times. The only other people who knew about this were John’s wife, Marjorie ( Joyce Bulifant), and his 14-year-old\n\nBig Eddie—Unredeemed ticket to a taping.\n\n15 son, Ricky Martin (not to be confused with any other Ricky Martin), played by Mike Darnell. Olive Dunbar portrayed fellow teacher Miss Bertha Bottomly, who hadn’t taken a vacation in 22 years. She was not “in on” John’s secret, and she never did pick up on the running jokes that both Johns continually forgot her name (Miss Bottomly), and that they were never in the same room at the same time. The unpredictable change from “Big” to “Little” John, and vice-versa, created many a confused bystander, teacher, and student. The music always clued the audience into the fact that the “change” was coming. I asked Robbie Rist if wearing the oversized clothing whenever “Big John” became “Little John” ever caused him to trip and fall, and he said no: “In fact, the big clothes made my job easier. Every movement in those clothes was very funny. I didn’t have to do a lot to get laughs.” Robbie also recalled, “My natural eye color is green, and Herb Edelman’s were brown, so I had to wear very uncomfortable contact lenses to make my eyes appear brown. I’m usually seen wearing glasses, but since I had the contact lenses on, I didn’t wear glasses on this show.” Joyce Bulifant had an incredible memory about working with Sherwood Schwartz: “Up until the last possible moment, I was to be Carol Brady on The Brady Bunch. One of the powersthat-be at ABC wanted Florence Henderson in the role, and even though Sherwood Schwartz and others rallied for me, Florence got the role. I did get to do another show with Sherwood Schwartz, however, and this was it.” The debut, which explains the “growing” pains of the two Johns, was titled “A Sizeable Problem.” Other episodes include “Peter Panic,” in which both Johns were cast in a school production of “Peter Pan;” in “Big Shot, Little Shot,” it was a two-shot vaccination day at school for John Martin—both “Big” and “Little” John got one; in “Time for Change,” Big John thought he had ﬁnally ﬁgured out the schedule for his “changes” through a chemical equation, which proved grossly inaccurate. The program was created by Sherwood Schwartz and Lloyd Schwartz; the executive producer was Sherwood Schwartz; producers included William P. D’Angelo, R. S. Allen, Harvey Bullock, and Lloyd Schwartz; writers included Ron Friedman, William Freedman, Sherwood and Lloyd Schwartz, Albert A. Schwartz, Mark Fink, Sam Locke, Paul Roberts, Ben Gershman, Harry Winkler, Bruce Howard, David P. Har-\n\nBilly mon, Jerome Zucker, Davis Samuel Zucker, James S. Abrahams, Bruce Kalish, Ron Sellz, Herbert Finn, and Alan Dinehart; and directors included Gordon Wiles and Ross Bowman. The theme song was written by John Thomas Fox and Sherwood Schwartz, and performed by Jerry Whitman. Joyce Bulifant remembered, “Harvey Bullock and Ron Friedman became great friends of mine for many, many years.” All 13 original episodes are available in a DVD set from Fabulous Films, Limited, in the UK. Robbie Rist revealed, “The guy who played my older brother Ricky, Mike Darnell, is the same Mike Darnell who is now the President of Alternative Entertainment for the Fox Network. Mike is really the father of reality TV. He very much wanted to be a producer, and through his own persistence, began with When Animals Attack, and parlayed it into American Idol, Temptation Island, Joe Millionaire, X-Factor, Alien Autopsy, and So You Think You Can Dance? Quite an amazing success story.”\n\nBilly John Rich Productions/20th Century– Fox. CBS. Monday nights 8:30 (February 26, 1979-March 12, 1979), and Saturday nights 8:30 (March 24, 1979-April 28, 1979). Seven color episodes were ﬁlmed with a laugh track. This show, hastily selected to replace the abysmal lone episode of Co-Ed Fever on CBS, didn’t fare any better than its predecessor. The premise worked well in the movies with James Thurber’s The Secret World of Walter Mitty, and in cartoon form years later in Bobby’s World. In sitcom form, however, it didn’t jell. A young Steve Guttenberg portrayed Billy Fisher, a 19year-old who hated the job arranged for him by his dad at the Shadrack and Shadrack Funeral Home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As an escape, Billy liked to daydream, and envisioned great things in his future. The program was actually based upon a British play called “Billy Liar,” by Thomas Courteney, and “Billy Liar” was the name of one of the show’s episodes (in which Billy saw himself as a superstar guest on The Merv Grifﬁn Show). In the debut titled “The Letter,” Billy got an interview for a job with the local radio station (WBK), and so he imagined becoming a famous disk jockey and media mogul who hired Don Adams to star in a sitcom which tried to put “fun” in funerals. In another episode, “Brief Encounter,” Billy imagined himself as a famous athlete (NFL star Larry Czonka guest starred in this episode). In “The Prize,” Billy en-\n\nThe Billy Bean Show visioned himself taking Suzanne Somers to the annual Mortician’s Ball. The rest of the cast consisted of James Gallery as Billy’s disappointed father George Fisher; Peggy Pope played Billy’s mom Alice Fisher, and she was much more supportive of her son’s “exaggerations.” Also in the Fisher household was Gran, Billy’s frail, forgetful grandmother, played by Paula Trueman. At the funeral parlor was Billy’s co-worker and friend Arthur Milliken (Bruce Talkington) who was always trying to protect Billy from getting ﬁred—not an easy task. Billy’s boss was uptight funeral director Norville Shadrack (Michael Alaimo) who spoke slowly, always with perfect diction. Most of that perfect diction involved condescending remarks aimed at Billy for dereliction of duties. In the debut, Shadrack was angry with Billy because he used the company hearse to take a girl to a drivein movie, and came back with a big scratch on the rear bumper. The program was produced and directed by John Rich; writers included Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais (formerly of On the Rocks). Billy debuted on the same night as another short-lived CBS sitcom, Flatbush. This Billy is not to be confused with the short-lived 1992 sitcom of the same name which starred comedian Billy Connolly.\n\nThe Billy Bean Show ABC. Tuesday nights 9:00. 1951. Broadcast live. Extremely little is known about this live sitcom, except that it starred Arnold Stang as Billy Bean—a soda jerk; Phil Tead was his boss; and Billie Lou Watt was the boss’ daughter (on whom Billy had a schoolboy crush). Others in the cast included Harry Bellaver and Mort Stephens. The program was produced by Jeffrey Hayden, and directed by Sean Dillon. To my knowledge, no episodes exist.\n\nThe Bing Crosby Show Bing Crosby Productions/Desilu Studios. ABC. Monday nights 9:30. September 14, 1964-June 14, 1965. 28 black-and-white episodes were ﬁlmed with a laugh track. Sponsors included Mennen, Wisk, Lucky Whip, Pepto Bismol, Gillette, Imperial Margarine, Lever Brothers, and Ford-LincolnMercury. Recording and movie star Bing Crosby also had his own TV production company—BCP (Bing Crosby Productions), which gave us Ben Casey and Hogan’s Heroes. BCP also brought us\n\n16 Bing’s own eponymous short-lived sitcom. Bing was one of those stars who just couldn’t make the successful transition to the small screen. The ABC Monday night lineup looked good on paper, though—George Burns in Wendy and Me, followed by The Bing Crosby Show—but neither show went on to a second season. Bing portrayed Bing Collins, a once-successful crooner who left show business for a less hectic life as an electronics engineer (he had designed the recording studio for local Culver University) and family man. He also loved baseball and was often pictured in front of the TV set sporting a Pittsburgh Pirates hat (Bing was part owner of the Pirates in real life), even though the TV series was set on Valley Tree Lane in Los Angeles. Bing was often heard humming the seasonal favorite “Greensleeves” on the show year round. Beverly Garland played his wife Ellie. At least once an episode, Bing and sometimes even Ellie broke into song. The Collinses also had two daughters—a blonde boy-crazy 15-year-old named Janice (Carol Faylen) and a 10-year-old walking encyclopedia named Joyce (Diane Sherry). They also had the luxury of a live-in handyman named Willie Walters (Frank McHugh). Episodes include the debut “A Fine Romance,” in which Bing and Ellie’s marriage was called dull and predictable by their children, so the couple tried to get out of their rut by trying new things, only to discover it was the rut they liked best; in “Exactly Like Who?,” Bing’s reallife son, Gary, portrayed a wannabe singer/songwriter named Don, only to discover that the marketing of talent was really his bailiwick; in “The Test,” while teaching Janice how to drive, Bing found out the hard way that his own driver’s license had expired, necessitating his taking the driving test again; in “The Christmas Show,” of course, Bing got to sing his legendary “White Christmas.” Actress Kathy Garver recalled an episode on which she guest starred called “The Keefers Come Calling”: “I played a party guest having a great time with dreamy guest star Frankie Avalon. Singer Vikki Carr played his wife, and accompanied him to this party at Bing’s house. Together, they comprised the Keefers. I was going to UCLA at the time, and a chance to work not only with Bing Crosby, but also with my heartthrob, Frankie, was too good a role to turn down! The scenes went quickly—Bing was the ultimate pro.” The program was produced by Steven Gethers; writers included Dan Beaumont, Tom\n\n17 and Helen August, Jerome Ross, Irving Gaynor Neiman, and Jack Sher; and the director was James Sheldon. Music was provided by John Scott Trotter, and the theme songs “That’s Life” and “It All Adds Up to Love” (performed by Bing) were written by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen. Numerous episodes can be viewed in the UCLA TV Archives.\n\nBlansky’s Beauties Henderson Production Company, Inc./Miller-Milkis Productions, Inc./ Paramount Studios. ABC. Saturday nights 8:00. February 12, 1977-May 21, 1977. 13 color episodes were ﬁlmed before a live audience. Earlier in the TV season, Nancy Walker had her own eponymous sitcom from Norman Lear, which failed. This one didn’t fare much better. The original working title was Mrs. Blansky’s Beauties, but that was shortened. Walker portrayed Nancy Blansky, who was in charge of staging a crew of Las Vegas showgirls at the Oasis Hotel’s Major Putnam Spectacular every night. To cut expenses, Nancy and a few of the girls as well as some family members (this show had a huge cast) lived together in an apartment (number 7). Nancy’s roommates included bubbly Ethel “Sunshine” Akalino (Lynda Goodfriend) and daft blonde Bambi Benton (a take-off on Barbi Benton), played by Caren Kaye. Caren Kaye told me, “I was modeled to become the Fonz in this venue—a female Fonz.” Also in the cast were nephew Joey DeLuca (Eddie Mekka), the choreographer, and his younger brother, the girl-crazy 12-year-old Anthony DeLuca (Scott Baio). Singer Johnny Desmond played Emilio, the maître d (Nancy’s boyfriend) and George Pentecost played Horace “Stubbs” Wilmington, Nancy’s persnickety boss and costume designer. After the quick demise of his own sitcom, Mr. T. and Tina, Pat Morita joined the cast of Blansky’s Beauties midstream. He was back to playing Arnold and owned a Las Vegas coffee shop near the Oasis. Like Happy Days with its “Sit on it,” and Welcome Back, Kotter with its “Up your nose with a rubber hose,” this show, too had its own catch phrase: “Put a sock in it.” Even though this show was canceled after only 13 episodes, its story doesn’t end there. Apparently, Miller-Milkis Productions really thought they had something here keeping the show set in Las Vegas and a few of the cast members—Caren Kaye, Lynda Goodfriend, and Scott Baio. With a bit of re-tooling, they made a new pilot called Legs, which aired on ABC almost\n\nBlondie exactly a year after the demise of Blansky’s Beauties. In this show, Kaye and Goodfriend were once again Las Vegas showgirls with different character names. The pilot did well, and that led to a series with an additional element—the girls now had to look after younger siblings. This series ended up on NBC with a new title, Who’s Watching the Kids? All of the tweaking and retooling didn’t help very much, and it, too, only lasted 13 weeks. Blansky’s Beauties was created by Garry Marshall, Bob Brunner, and Arthur Silver; writers included Warren S. Murray, Joe Glauberg, Marc Sotkin, Judy Ervin, Roger Garrett, Chris Thompson, Robert Keats, Arnold Kane, Steve Zacharias, Toni DiMarco, and David Ketchum; and directors included Marshall, Alan Rafkin, and Jerry Paris. There were lots of guest stars from other Paramount sitcoms—Penny Marshall, Doris Roberts, Roz Kelly, and Phil Foster. Even the theme song, “I Want It All,” was performed by Cyndi Grecco, who also performed the Laverne and Shirley theme. Nancy Walker never again attempted sitcom success, but she did go on to direct a couple of episodes of 13 Queens Boulevard. Caren Kaye remembered Nancy Walker: “She was a pro but didn’t enjoy working with showgirls, children or dogs. She was very kind to me when my back went out from wearing those uncomfortable costumes and shoes.” Several episodes can be viewed in the UCLA TV Archives. One episode aired on TV Land.\n\nBlondie Hal Roach Studios/King Features. NBC. Friday nights 8:00. January 4, 1957-September 27, 1957. 26 black-and-white episodes were ﬁlmed with a laugh track. Sponsors included Toni Hair Care Products. This was TV’s ﬁrst version of Blondie. It was only marginally more successful than the second version in that it lasted for 26 episodes (the 1968 color version only lasted 13 weeks). It had the same identical theme song as the TV version of The Great Gildersleeve, which starred Willard Waterman, and was also ﬁlmed at Hal Roach Studios. Here again was that familiar story of Dagwood Bumstead (Arthur Lake, who had played Dagwood in the movies), and his lovely tow-headed wife Blondie (Pamela Britton), who lived at 4224 Shady Lane Avenue with their two children Alexander and Cookie (Stuffy Singer and Ann Barnes, respectively). In this version, their dog Daisy had a large litter of puppies (and all of the dogs were trained by Rennie Renfro).\n\nBlondie Dagwood’s boss at the Dithers Construction Company was cranky old Julius Caesar Dithers (Florenz Ames). Cora Dithers, his shrew of a wife, was played by two different women—Leal Bliss in the very early episodes, and Elvia Allman in the rest of the episodes. One of the biggest differences between this version of Blondie, and its color cousin a decade later, was the Woodleys— the Bumstead’s next-door neighbors. True to the comic strip, Herbert and Tootsie Woodley were a big part of this ﬁrst version of Blondie. Herbert was played by Harold Peary and wife Harriet “Tootsie” Woodley was played by Lois Collier in the very early episodes, and by Hollis Erving in the rest. Episodes include the debut, “Dagwood’s Ego for the Third Time,” in which Blondie wanted Dagwood to get a promotion (an ofﬁce with many windows was her gauge for success), so she cooked up a scheme to make him think he was a wealthy heir so that he’d think he had nothing to lose and would muster the courage to stand up to Mr. Dithers and demand the vice-presidency; in “I Spy,” Dagwood unwittingly got involved with the syndicate, who had placed sensitive microﬁlm in his hat as a hiding place. The hard part for these crooks was getting the hat back. In “The Quiz Show,” Dagwood got to show off his skilled number-crunching brain on a game show on which he became a “human adding machine” to win cash and prizes. The program was produced by William Harmon; the executive producer was Hal Roach, Jr.; directors included Hal Yates, Paul Landres, and Gerald Freedman; and writers included John L. Greene, Frank Gill, Jr., and George Carlton Brown.\n\nBlondie Paramount Studios/King Features. CBS. Thursday nights 7:30. September 26, 1968January 9, 1969. 14 color episodes were ﬁlmed with a laugh track, only 13 aired. This was the second unsuccessful attempt to bring Chic Young’s Blondie comic strip to the small screen. This version was much more colorful than its predecessor. Actual color Blondie comic strips were shown during the opening and closing credits. This was the story of the always hurried, always harried Dagwood Bumstead (Will Hutchins)—an architect at Dithers Construction Company; his lovely, understanding, spendthrift wife Blondie was played by Patricia Harty. Blondie and Dagwood had two young children—Alexander and Cookie (Peter Robbins\n\n18 and Pamelyn Ferdin respectively). Both lent their voices to Charlie Brown and Lucy in animated TV specials. The Bumsteads also had a dog— Daisy, played by Daisy. Dagwood’s boss, referred to as “Dithers, that screamer” in the opening credits, was portrayed by Jim Backus. Backus’s real-life wife, Henny, played his wife Cora. The debut, “Sayonara, Dagwood,” involved a misunderstanding. Dagwood’s plans were to be presented to the client, H.H. Hilton (Edward Andrews) at a Japanese restaurant called Chez Sukiyaki. Blondie got a glimpse of Dagwood entering the restaurant with Mr. Hilton’s wife, Honey (Melinda Fee) and thought he was cheating on her. Dressed as a Japanese waitress, Blondie managed to create quite a scene. However, Dagwood got his raise, and Blondie apologized for what she had been thinking. A young Pat Morita had a minor role in this episode as Manny, the host at the restaurant. The program was produced by Joe Connelly; writers included George Tibbles, Gary Belkin, and Danny Simon; and directors included Norman Abbott, Peter Baldwin, Gene Nelson, and Bruce Bilson. Music was provided by Bernard Green. Replacing this show was the equally short-lived The Queen and I, starring Larry Storch.\n\nBob & Carol & Ted & Alice Frankovich Enterprises, Inc./Screen Gems. ABC. Wednesday nights 8:00. September 26, 1973-November 7, 1973. 12 episodes were ﬁlmed before a live audience, but only seven aired. Sponsors included J. C. Penney. The 1969 movie version by Paul Mazursky and Larry Tucker was nominated for four Academy Awards. Every one of the four main characters in the movie version was played by a very well-known entity—Robert Culp was Bob, Natalie Wood was Carol, Elliott Gould was Ted, and Dyan Cannon was Alice. There were no slouches in the TV sitcom version either—ﬁlmmaker Bob Sanders was played by Robert Urich, Carol Sanders was played by Anne Archer, Ted Henderson was played by David Spielberg, and Alice Henderson was played by Anita Gillette. The TV version, however, was not a hit. Bob and Carol Sanders were in their twenties, progressive, and “with it,” while Ted and Alice Henderson were in their thirties, conservative, and “square.” Bob and Carol had a young son named Sean, played by Brad Savage, and Ted and Alice had a pre-teen daughter named Elizabeth played by\n\nBonino\n\n19 Jodie Foster. They were all neighbors in Los Angeles, and they were friends, but their vastly different moral values, and some generation gap issues were the fodder for most of the comedy. Episodes include “Nobody Wants to Talk About It,” in which Carol wanted her husband to join her in becoming an organ donor. She then went a step farther and wanted the Hendersons to designate the Sanders family as guardians for Elizabeth, should anything happen to them (and vice versa). In the pilot episode, free spirits Bob and Carol asked Ted and Alice to “go naked swimming with them.” The program was produced by Jim Henerson (Larry Rosen produced the pilot episode); writers included Henerson, David G. Lloyd, Bernie Kahn, Larry Tucker, Rick Mittleman, Gene Thompson, Karyl Geld, Ron Friedman, George Atkins, James Ritz and Michael Weinberg; and directors included Rick Edelstein and Leo Penn. Reruns were brieﬂy shown on Comedy Central.\n\nThe Bob Crane Show MTM Productions. NBC. Thursday nights 8:30. March 6, 1975-June 19, 1975. 14 color episodes were ﬁlmed before a live audience. After a successful radio career came a brief stint on The Donna Reed Show, and then the long-running Hogan’s Heroes, there were great expectations for this next venture in the career of Bob Crane—his own eponymous sitcom. And with the track record of success for MTM Productions, this seemed like “a sure thing.” In his new show, Bob portrayed Bob Wilcox, who had been a highly successful and well paid big-wig in the insurance industry. That is, until the day he realized he just wasn’t happy in his work. The opening credits explained it pretty well—Bob was on several phone lines at the same time and then mouthed the word “Stop!” In the next scene, he threw his briefcase into the lake. Even though he was now well into his forties, and much older than all of the other students, Bob decided to go to medical school to become a doctor. His wife Ellie Wilcox, played by Trisha Hart (formerly Patricia Harty), became the breadwinner (she was in real estate), and they, along with their seldom-seen daughter Pam (Erica Petal) moved from a glamorous home into a factory-turnedapartment in the old Star Trucking Company building in a less-than-desirable neighborhood. Apparently, Bob had also sold his car because he traveled everywhere by bicycle. Their landlord was a widower named Mr. Ernest Busso (Ronny\n\nGraham), who also owned the Busso and Petrie Toy And Novelty Company next door. Busso was always inventing new gag items, like toothpaste which turned your teeth black and itching bath salts. That was Bob’s home life. At City School of Medicine in Los Angeles, the assistant dean was the fastidious Dr. Lyle Ingersoll ( Jack Fletcher). Bob’s fellow students included Marvin Susman (Todd Susman), Lester Schmidt (Will Seltzer), and Jerry Mallory ( James Sutorious). Harold Gould had a recurring role as Dr. Strauss. Situations were derived from the family’s adjustments to the huge change in income status, and Bob’s attempts to ﬁt in with students half his age. Episodes include the debut “Mid-Term Blues” in which Bob had the sinking feeling that he failed his mid-term exam and considered returning to the insurance industry when he saw the impact his new life was having upon his family; in “But I Love My Wife,” Bob’s new study partner, Janet Whitehall (Trisha Noble), was a beautiful 23-year-old who had designs on Bob. It’s interesting to note that one year later, she’d reprise that role in another MTM show, The Mary Tyler Moore Show (as Whitney Lewis) in an episode titled “Ted’s Temptation,” and yet again she played a temptress (Carol Tyson) in an episode of Husbands, Wives and Lovers. The show’s 13th and ﬁnal episode, “Son of Campus Capers” was signiﬁcant mostly for its guest star— an up-and-coming John Ritter in rare form as Hornbeck, who had been sabotaging the other students’ lab experiments and book reports so that he could keep academic pace with them. The program was created by Norman S. Powell, Jim Allen, and Martin Cohan. Powell and Cohan also produced the show. Writers included Cohan, Martin Donovan, Lloyd Garver, and Ken Hecht; directors included Jay Sandrich, Buddy Tyne, and Jack Shea. In June of 1978, Bob Crane’s off-camera life caught up with him and he was found brutally murdered in a hotel room. David Pollock, who wrote for many of the MTM sitcoms told me, “Sadly, no one had any idea that Bob was leading this sordid double life.”\n\nThe Bob Cummings Show (see The New Bob Cummings Show)\n\nBonino A Fred Coe Production. NBC. Saturday nights 8:00. September 12, 1953-December 26, 1953. 16 live episodes were broadcast with a live audience. Sponsors included Philip Morris\n\nBoss Lady Cigarettes (Dunhill Cigarettes) and Lady Esther Cosmetics. Fortunato Bonino (Ezio Pinza) was, as in real-life, an opera singer who loved to perform, and he toured the world. Called “Babbo” by his kids, he was a widower with eight children, and was away from his large family for long periods of time. When he forgot his son Carlo’s birthday (Oliver Andes in the series, Jonathon Marlow in the pilot episode) because of a photo-op, he cut back performances in order to spend more time with his family. This decision greatly pleased Babbo’s daughter, Doris (played in the pilot episode by future star, Eva Marie Saint, but later by Lenka Peterson), who was about to be married. His eldest son, Edward (Conrad Janis) was attending college, and his ten-year-old son, Andrew, who felt he now had a real father, was portrayed by actor/musician Van Dyke Parks. Parks told me, “I was originally selected to be in four episodes ... getting $450 a week, plus $100 in expenses. However, I became a close friend of Ezio Pinza’s, and those four episodes expanded into the entire run of 16 episodes. Mr. Pinza took me out for my ﬁrst Italian meal—spaghetti. I also became friends with his real-life son, Peter Pinza. I used to stay at the Pinza house often. I loved that their doorbell played “Some Enchanted Evening.” Mr. Pinza drove a beautiful Kaiser and had a very beautiful wife, Doris, who had performed with the Ballet Russes.” Oliver Andes, who played Carlo agrees, “Mr. Pinza was a very warm and generous man. Although he was a famous opera and stage star, he didn’t act like one during rehearsals or the show. He gave the entire cast Christmas gifts at the end of the show, and mine was a gold Bulova Watch.” Also in the cast were Chet Allen as son Terry Bonino; Gaye Huston as daughter Francesca Bonino; Paul Jonali as son Michael; Lucille Graygor as daughter Angela; the ubiquitous Mary Wickes as Martha the maid; Mike Kellin as Rusty (Babbo’s valet and conﬁdant); and David Opatoshu as Babbo’s manager, Walter Rogers (Murray Matheson in the pilot episode). Oliver Andes recalled, “Mary Wickes left the show during the run to fulﬁll a movie contract which left a big void. Her character was very important to the whole series. She returned for one or two shows at the very end.” Unlike Life with Luigi, this show about an Italian-American family did not raise the ire of the Italian-American community, although its life in prime time was just as short. Ezio sang in each episode of the show, and\n\n20 Van Dyke Parks remembers, “I performed at least one duet with him on the show. In fact, our agent, Lucy Kroll, made sure to get kids who could act and sing for the Bonino show.” Oliver Andes recalled, “Anthony Eisley was brought in to play Doris’ boyfriend, John, and when they became engaged, it was the opportunity for Mr. Pinza to sing the ‘My Little Girl’ half of the soliloquy from Carousel.” Doing a live sitcom with eight children and several pets was really risky. Andes remembered an episode with a live parrot: “There was an actor off-stage who spoke for it, but at a dress rehearsal, the real parrot started to speak lines that were not in the script, so a stuffed parrot was quickly substituted. And we all held our breaths when a pony was brought on in the ﬁrst episode. We didn’t want it to have an ‘accident’ during the show.” The program was produced by Fred Coe. Bonino was performed live from the Hudson Theater on West 44th Street in New York City, where The Kate Smith Show was also done. Van Dyke Parks told me, “I was never intimidated by the live broadcast or the live audience. I was able to emote, learn my lines, cry on cue. I was a very obedient kid and was very aware of all the talent surrounding me on the show.” Oliver Andes concurred, saying, “You were only aware of the audience when they laughed or applauded.” Among the guest stars on the show were Reta Shaw and Brett Somers. The program was created by Thomas Phipps and Robert Alan Aurthur (who was also the writer); the director was Gordon Duff. A kinescope of the pilot is available for viewing in the New York City branch of the Paley Center for Media. This pilot episode is titled “I, Bonino,” a play on I, Pagliacci. In a New York Times review of Bonino, dated September 16, 1953, Jack Gould wrote, “Bonino is a program that obviously needs lots of work, and Saturday’s show perhaps should have been tried out ﬁrst on WNHC–TV in New Haven. A few more weeks may tell quite a different story.” Sadly, after those few more weeks, Bonino was gone from the NBC schedule.\n\nBoss Lady Wrather Television Productions, Inc. NBC. Tuesday nights 9:00. July 1, 1952-September 23, 1952. 13 episodes were ﬁlmed without a laugh track. Sponsors included Proctor and Gamble—Ivory, Lilt, and Duz. By the time this summer replacement series began, its star, Lynn Bari, had already spent two\n\n21 decades in show business—mostly in “B” movies for 20th Century–Fox. A beautiful, statuesque brunette, she was also frequently seen in pin-up girl poses. She also danced and sang, but usually played “the other woman.” Her move to the new medium of television did not prove to be an immensely successful one. In the summer of 1950, she co-starred with Donald Curtis in a CBS show similar to The Thin Man called Detective’s Wife. Two years later, she starred in yet another summer replacement series (for Fireside Theater) called Boss Lady, but this one was way ahead of its time. At a time when I Love Lucy couldn’t use the word “pregnant,” and most TV women were housewives, Bari portrayed Gwen F. Allen, the successful CEO of a California construction company known as Hillandale Homes. Not only was she in management, but she was in management in a very male-dominated business, at the most successful builder in the United States. Gwen’s inept father (Nicholas Joy) was the chairman of the board, and continually overstepped his bounds and interfered in his daughter’s work. The staff was always trying to ﬁgure out ways to get the old man to step down or take another job, but to no avail. Gwen had a female secretary named Aggie, played by Lee Patrick, a male assistant named Roger (Richard Gaines), and a boyfriend named Jeff Standish (Glenn Langan). Episodes include “Boss Vacations,” in which the vastly overworked Gwen was forced into taking a vacation by her co-workers, but had to come back early to salvage a deal which was almost ruined by her meddling dad’s silly invention called “the screenless window.” In an untitled episode, Gwen was interviewed for the cover of Executive magazine at a most inopportune time. She was just about to hire a new general manager, but behind-the-scenes at the ofﬁce, her reputation for hiring men who fell in love with her was leading to something resembling a mutiny. In another untitled episode, Gwen became a blonde in an attempt to get a construction contract with a Nicaraguan businessman who had an afﬁnity for towheads. The program was produced by Jack Wrather and Robert Mann; writers included Mann; and directors included William D. Russell. Several episodes can be viewed at both The Paley Center for Media and the UCLA TV Archives.\n\nBridget Loves Bernie Screen Gems/Douglas S. Cramer Company. CBS. Saturday nights 8:30.\n\nBridget Loves Bernie September 16, 1972-September 8, 1973. 24 color episodes were ﬁlmed with a laugh track. This program had a lot in common with Life with Luigi, which aired two decades earlier. In Luigi’s case, the show was doing well in the ratings, but because of pressure from the ItalianAmerican community (who were up-in-arms over their portrayal on the show), it was canceled. Bridget Loves Bernie suffered a similar fate. It was a sandwich hit, tucked in between All in the Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show on Saturday nights on CBS. However, the subject matter raised such an uproar that, despite its very decent ratings, CBS bowed to the pressure and Bridget Loves Bernie became a single season sitcom. The uproar arose, mostly from the Jewish community, because of the “condoned” marriage between Bridget Theresa Mary Coleen Fitzgerald (an Irish-Catholic fourth grade school teacher), played by Meredith Baxter, and Bernie Steinberg (a poor cabbie who drove yellow cab number 12, was an aspiring actor and writer, and was the son of Jewish delicatessen owners), played by David Birney. The young couple, who met and fell in love in Bernie’s cab, lived in the apartment above Steinberg’s Delicatessen, run by Sam and Sophie Steinberg (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald, respectively). Because of their proximity to the newlywed couple, they meddled a lot. Bridget’s parents meddled as well, and often dropped in unexpectedly (David Doyle played wealthy executive Walter “Walt” Fitzgerald, and Audra Lindley was his somewhat stuffy wife, Amy). The Fitzgeralds lived in a luxurious apartment at Central Park West. Not unlike Broadway’s runaway hit, Abie’s Irish Rose, the situations in this sitcom emerged from the star-crossed lovers and their families. How they adapted and adjusted along the way provided a seemingly endless array of script possibilities. Episodes include “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Vatican,” in which the Steinbergs bought rafﬂe tickets from the Fitzgeralds and won a trip to Rome (which included a private audience with the Pope). This was a prize the Fitzgeralds really wanted to win, so the Fitzgeralds bought round-trip tickets to Tel Aviv with the intention of trading. To avoid any hurt feelings, clever Uncle Moe Plotnick (Ned Glass) acted as a go-between, and made the switch, and all was well. In “Tis the Season,” the newlywed couple couldn’t decide which holiday to celebrate, Christmas or Hanukkah, for fear of offending one set of in-laws.\n\nBringing Up Buddy The show was created by Screen Gems staple Bernard Slade; the producers were Arthur Alsberg and Don Nelson; writers included Alsberg and Nelson, as well as John McGreevey, Elias Davis, Marty Roth, Bill Dana, Don Sherman, Howard Merrill, Slade, Jack Hanrahan, Jerry Mayer, Gordon Farr, Rick Mittleman, Warren S. Murray, Lloyd Turner, Gordon Mitchell, Joanna Lee, and Arnold Kane; and directors included Richard Kinon, Lee Philips, James Sheldon, Hal Cooper, Ezra Stone, Alan Rafkin, Coby Ruskin, Bill Bixby, and Ozzie Nelson. Ozzie also made a cameo appearance in the episode titled “With This Ring.” The theme song, “Love Is Crazy,” was written by Jerry Fielding with lyrics by Diane Hilderbrand. Those lyrics are performed at the beginning of the debut episode. This show was brieﬂy rerun on a shortlived cable channel called HA! in the early 1990s. After the show’s demise, David Birney and Meredith Baxter got married in 1973 in real-life. They divorced in 1989.\n\nBringing Up Buddy Kayro Productions, Inc./ Revue Studios in Hollywood. CBS Monday nights 8:30. October 10, 1960-September 25, 1961. 39 black-and-white episodes were ﬁlmed with a laugh track. Sponsored by Scott Paper Company. This sitcom starred Frank Aletter as investment counselor Richard David “Buddy” Flower who lived in the town of Bradley Falls. The original working title for the show was The Flower Girls, but that title would have proven confusing to viewers. Bachelor Buddy lived with his two spinster aunts—Iris Flower (Doro Merande of Our Town) and Violet “Vi” Flower (Enid Markey, who had been Tarzan’s ﬁrst Jane in vintage ﬁlms). Violet called everyone “Love.” It wasn’t a secret that Enid and Doro didn’t get along very well (this sitcom didn’t have the happiest set). Even though the aunts were never themselves wed, they were always playing matchmaker to get Buddy married off. Buddy was taken in by the aunts after his biological parents died in a car crash. Yvonne Lime portrayed Buddy’s secretary and frequent love interest, Penny. Episodes of note include “Cesare Comes Calling,” in which a visiting, down-on-his-luck opera singer took advantage of the good-natured aunts by borrowing money from them, much to Buddy’s dismay. In “Poppa’s Eagle,” Buddy tried not to look a gift eagle in the beak when a stuffed eagle heirloom was given to him by his aunts to\n\n22 spruce up his newly redecorated ofﬁce. This placed Buddy on the horns of a dilemma—the bird was an eyesore, and he was allergic to feathers. In “The Aunts Have a Baby,” an infant was abandoned in the backseat of the aunts’ convertible while they were shopping. A note afﬁxed to the baby’s blanket let the aunts know that the foundling’s name was Robert. With only that piece of information to go on, the aunts took care of the little guy until the mother could be tracked down. The hardest part was keeping it from Buddy. Guest stars included Aletter’s wife in real life, Lee Meriwether (playing a nurse named Gloria Arnold), in an episode titled “Buddy and the Amazon” (including a cameo by their new baby girl Kyle). Lee told me, “I was worried about keeping Kyle happy and quiet there on the set. Frank and I had to get her a Social Security card to appear on the show. That card still bears her teeth marks.” Lee also recalled, “Enid was just amazing, adorable, as sweet as can be. Behind-the-scenes, she reassured me that, being a new mother I shouldn’t worry—everything would be ﬁne. Doro was much more reserved, but she eventually warmed up to me. I remember her having a minor incident in her dressing room, something about someone having moved her bobby pins.” Other guest stars included Edgar Buchanan appearing in the episode called “Big Game Hunter” as Captain Cunningham, who was chosen to speak at a local women’s league function. The problem was that all of his big adventures were tall tales. Sherry Jackson had a crush on Buddy in the episode called “Buddy and Janie;” Arte Johnson appeared in “Auntie’s Cake,” in which the aunts endorsed a line of frozen desserts; Irene Ryan and George Chandler appeared together in the episode titled “Cynthia’s Boyfriend;” and Ryan reprised her role as Cynthia in an episode called “The Singer,” in which Buddy and a nightclub performer were trapped together in an elevator. The program was produced by Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher; the creator was George Tibbles; writers included the teams of Si Rose and Seaman Jacobs, Joe Connelly and Mosher, and Alan Lipscott, Bob Fisher and George Tibbles; and directors included David Butler, Sidney Lanﬁeld, and Andrew McCullough. The transitional music in this show is identical to that used in Leave It to Beaver. That’s very understandable—both were ﬁlmed at Revue Studios for Kayro Productions. The entire run of this\n\n23\n\nBroadside\n\nBringing up Buddy—Left to right, Enid Markey, Frank Aletter, and Doro Merande (CBS).\n\nseries is housed in the UCLA TV Archives.

September 20, 1964-September 5, 1965. 32 black-and-white episodes were ﬁlmed with a laugh track. Sponsors included Plymouth.\n\nThe Brothers In an experiment to release more men for combat in World War II, women were called upon as replacements for the motor pool in 1944. The action took place on Ranakai in the South Paciﬁc in this female spinoff of McHale’s Navy— thus the clever title of Broadside. Kathy Nolan, who for ﬁve seasons had been Kate on The Real McCoys, was the star of the show as Lt. Anne Morgan. She was one of ﬁve “women” newly stationed on Ranakai. The word “women” is in quotations for a reason to be explained later in this paragraph. Along with Anne Morgan were Waves Selma Ko"
