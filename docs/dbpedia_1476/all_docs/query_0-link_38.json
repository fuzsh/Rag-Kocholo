        "text": "By Todd Garbarini\n\nAnyone going into Dutch film director Rene Daalder’s 1976 film Massacre at Central High might very well be expecting an all-out slasher film. While the poster art might give this impression, audiences will be sorely disappointed as it is essentially a variant of Agatha Christie’s 1939 novel Ten Little Indians but with a much different tone. The opening credits and the strains of an inappropriate and perfunctory title song Crossroads (which is better suited to a made-for-television movie of the period) demanded by producer Harold Sobel to the consternation of the director immediately sends the wrong message to the viewer. Much of what has been written about the film over the years demonstrates the consensus that Massacre, the title of which appears to want to capitalize on the Tobe Hooper horror film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre from two years earlier, is a political allegory, and one can certainly analyze the film from that perspective, though it is doubtful that audiences at the time, especially those seeing the film at a drive-in of all places, looked so deeply into a film that on the surface looks to be a story about simple revenge.\n\nSet inside the battleground of Central High School in Southern California, David (Derrel Maury) is the new student and therefore automatically becomes a mark. He is no stud, but certainly not a pushover either. Mark (Andrew Stevens from Brian DePalma’s The Fury from 1977) is an old friend who owes David a favor from his past, one that we are not privy to, and appears to be willing to do whatever it takes to make David feel welcome. The ground rules for making it through Central High are simple: you’re either a somebody or you’re a nobody, to quote American Gangster’s Frank Lucas. Mark’s clique includes Bruce (the late Ray Underwood from Brice Mack’s Jennifer from 1978, another film about high school revenge), Craig (Steve Bond from Joel Bender’s Gas Pump Girls from 1979), and Paul (the late Damon Douglas of John D. Hancock’s Baby Blue Marine, also from 1976). These three bullies, for lack of a better word, essentially rule Central High which is presented as a seemingly insular world of jocks, jerks, and losers. For the first hour and a quarter of the film, adults are only spoken of and never seen onscreen. It is worth noting that Mark walks a tightrope in this film – his allegiance to David makes him hesitant to be included completely with this terrible triumvirate who harass pretty much anyone they want without fear of reprisal.\n\nDavid is subjected to seeing other students mercilessly harassed by the bullies, especially Mary (the late Cheryl Lynn “Rainbeaux” Smith) and Jane (the late Lani O’Grady) who are practically raped in a despicable sequence. David comes to their rescue and beats up their harassers, only to be partially crushed under his car by the group in an “accident” soon afterwards. Enraged, David single-handedly kills all three bullies in a fantasy right out of today’s high school killer headlines by sabotaging one’s hang-glider, one’s Dodge Tradesman 300’s brakes, and exploiting an empty swimming pool in a sequence almost too ridiculous to believe.\n\nThis scenario creates an interesting situation at the school as the once oppressed and harassed “losers” see the existence of a power vacuum and seize it, becoming bullies themselves and embodying everything they hated about their tormentors, Apparently, David is also well-versed in the art of bomb-making! What a coincidence. There is no mention of how he developed these skills (The Anarchist’s Cookbook, perhaps?), but he manages to come up with some fairly ornate methods of blowing away the new bullies, and they all go off without a hitch: (spoiler alerts!) one is blow away while at his locker; another is blown to Kingdom Come a la Sam Rothstein at the start of Martin Scorsese’s Casino (1995) but, unfortunately, no St. Matthew Passion for this guy; and last but not least Mary, Jane and their friend (Robert Carradine) are crushed by a rock in the middle of a threesome while in a tent (it comes out that police believe that they were involved in the killings – how convenient). I suppose this sequence gives new meaning to the term “die hard.”\n\nDespite all this mayhem, the school still moves ahead with a dance(!), and now the adults and police show up. David gets the idea to blow up the school – until Mark and his girlfriend Theresa (Kimberly Beck of television series fame), whom David fancies, tell him they are going to the dance. When he gets wind of this, David retrieves the bomb from the boiler room and, straight out of a James Bond film, makes it to the front lawn to save the day, but not without paying a price for his actions.\n\nThere seems to be a need to prop the film up in a bright light and look at it for evidence of it being a highly political film that is making a commentary on society and the members who dwell in it. I am unsure if that was the real motivation behind the film, however if one chooses to view it that way, the film is an interesting social commentary on what creates a bully or an oppressor, and how the oppressed end up taking over the positions of the long-gone bullies. The script is schematic, and the film is not particularly well-acted, but to be fair the director and crew had a 20-day shooting schedule on a modest $400,000 budget, so he certainly had his work cut out for him. The fight scenes suffer from performer restraint and the bullies are so annoying that the audience can only hope for a miserable end for all of them but when they come, the releases are more of a whimper than an all-out rise out of the seats that one would experience at the end of Steven Spielberg’s Jaws (1975) when the shark is finally killed.\n\nSynapse Films released a steelbook edition of this film in November 2020 and now it is available in a Standard Edition from the same company. The following extras are included:\n\nThe Projection Booth Podcast Interviews with Cast Members (87:00) – this is an audio playback that needs to be selected on the audio menu to access it and it can be listened to through the entire length of the film. This is a great listen as I was initially disappointed to see the absence of a commentary, but this is the next best thing. It is hosted by Mike White who speaks to Derrel Maury, Andrew Stevens, Robert Carradine, and Rex Sikes over the phone.\n\nAudio Interview with Director Renee Daalder (25:00) – likewise, this is an audio playback that needs to be selected on the audio menu to access it and it can be listened to through the first 25 minutes of the film, after which the film audio resumes. It is an audio interview with the director conducted by writer Michael Gingold and it is a wonderful record of their discussion as Mr. Daalder sadly passed away in 2019.\n\nHell in the Hallways (42:27) – this is a really nice look back at the making of the film, shot in high definition, with Derrel Maury, Tom Logan, Rex Sikes, Robert Carradine, Andrew Stevens, and Jeffrey Winner, in addition to some behind-the-scenes crew members who discuss how much fun and also how challenging it was to make. Tragically, Cheryl “Rainbeaux” Smith and Lani O’Grady both died way before their time. I recall seeing Lemora, A Child’s Tale of the Supernatural (1973) on October 24, 2002, as part of a “scary movies” retrospective at the Walter Reade Theater in New York, and wishing that I could interview Ms. Smith about her starring role in the film. Unbelievably, she passed away the very next day at age 47. Ms. Smith was 21 when she appeared in Massacre and is heartbreakingly beautiful, completely naked in her death scene that arrives 70 minutes into the film. She was a free spirit and appeared in some of the most interesting films of the 1970s and her presence brought something special to those films. Along with Candace Rialson, another performer from the 1970s who sadly died way before her time, they are two of my favorite actresses from this era.\n\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer (2:23) – this is in full-blown high definition and looks culled from the new master. The same cannot be said for the TV Spot (00:33), however, which is framed 1.33:1 and looks its age, beat up and contrasty. There is also a great-sounding Radio Spot (00:27) as well as a nice Still Gallery (3:14).\n\nClick here to order from Amazon\n\nBy Lee Pfeiffer\n\nMost rock 'n roll movies of the 1950s and 1060s were rightly regarded as disposable entertainment. With a few exceptions, they were low-budget attempts to cash in on the new fad before it might fade away. Elvis Presley's films were cinematic gold for a while but even they began to fade with the release of director Richard Lester's two Beatles films, \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Help!\", both of which brought innovation and style to the genre. The Monkees' feature film \"Head\" would also go boldly where no rock 'n roll flick would. \"The Cool Ones\", however, appears to have been made by people whose sensibilities were stuck in amber. Despite being released in an era when rock music was being defined by groups with a cutting edge, this musical comedy, released in 1967, has the hallmarks of similar films made a decade before. In short, it's a movie designed for hipsters but made by middle-aged squares.\n\nThe film centers on the adventures of Hallie Rodgers (Debbie Watson), a dancer seen on one of those \"Shindig\"-type TV series designed to appeal to teenagers by presenting musical groups performing their latest hits live on stage. Hallie feels she has true star power but the show's arrogant producer, played by Phil Harris, refuses to give her a chance to sing on the program. In an act of defiance on live TV, Hallie steals the microphone from guest performer Glen Campbell and belts out a song. As she is chased around the stage by production executives, she engages in wild mannerisms that the audience mistakes for a new dance. She's summarily fired but later learns she has gained a following and that her moves on stage are now the latest dance craze called \"The Tantrum\". (I'm not making this up, folks.) She then attempts to woo one-time teen idol Cliff Donner (Gil Peterson) to form a duo. Cliff has fallen on hard times and is currently performing in a failing nightclub run by avuncular British export Stanley Crumley (Robert Coote). The moody Gil is smitten with Hallie but is reluctant to try to regain his former stardom. Ultimately, he concedes when the sees the enthusiastic response from their duets, which help revive Stanley's nightclub. With Stanley as their manager, they set about promoting the act by performing The Tantrum in front of growing audiences. At this point, they are approached by Stanley's estranged brother Tony (Roddy McDowall), a legendary record producer who travels with his own posse and who enjoys a rabid fan base himself. Tony takes control of the act but his sheer narcissism and arrogance results in tension between Hallie and Gil, who break up and reunite more times than I can recount. The bizarre production gets even stranger with a closing act by Mrs. Miller, who was a sixtyish everyday woman whose cover version recording of Petula Clark's \"Downtown\" became a novelty hit that elevated her to temporary fame.\n\n\"The Cool Ones\" is awful on every level, but it's so awful it has the virtue to keep the viewer glued to the screen to see if it becomes even more awful. The songs are mostly awful despite being the creations of notable talents Lee Hazlewood and Billy Strange, although the best of the lot, \"This Town\", would be a well-received recording by Frank Sinatra a couple of years later. The depiction of teenagers is awful, presenting them as brain-dead zombies who instinctively embrace every new song and dance move they experience on a TV show and instantly turn into raving mobs of fans. Young people are presented in an inoffensive, sanitized manner. No one smokes (cigarettes or anything else) and they're all satisfied sipping tonics and sodas in nightclubs. Cripes, to think this film was sandwiched between the release of \"The Wild Angels\" and the Woodstock festival....The direction by Gene Nelson (who displayed some talent in other films and TV series) is awful and so are the performances, with Debbie Watson overacting and Gil Peterson, who looks like a human Ken doll, underplaying with predictably boring results. They make for the least erotic couple seen on screen since the Ma and Pa Kettle series. But the scene-stealing awful performance is provided by Roddy McDowall, who chews the scenery and everything else in sight while presenting an over-the-top caricature of a fussy, demanding gay man. But since film producers felt that teenagers shouldn't know that gay people exist, a plot device is inserted in which we learn Tony's unseen girlfriend is pregnant, which sends him into an even greater hissy fit that only reinforces the gay stereotype. Only dear old Robert Coote emerges with some dignity intact. The film does have colors that jump out of the screen and it is fun to see location footage of old L.A., which is marvelously photographed by legendary cinematographer Floyd Crosby, whose achievements include \"High Noon\". This would be his final film. The dance numbers are also well-choreographed by Toni Basil, who would go on to have the hit record \"Mickey\" in the 1980s. In the end, however, the movie makes those Frankie and Annette beach pictures look like biting social commentaries on life in the 1960s. I expected young Mickey Rooney to show up on screen shouting, \"Hey, kids- we can put the show on in the barn!!!\" The film was released as the bottom attraction on double features. There was probably no damage to anyone's career because few people saw it.\n\nIn viewing \"The Cool Ones\", I came to the conclusion that I had to disagree with Huey Lewis and the News in that it isn't hip to be square. The film is available on DVD from the Warner Archive. It's a nice transfer and includes the original trailer. The DVD is region-free so that bad movie lovers everywhere can enjoy the film.\n\nClick here to order from the Cinema Retro Movie Store\n\nRetro-Active: From the Cinema Retro Archives\n\nBy Lee Pfeiffer\n\nJustly acclaimed as one of the greatest film noir movies ever made, director Don Siegel's 1958 thriller The Lineup has been reissued by Sony as part of their burn-to-order DVD collection. The DVD carries over the bonus extras from the film's initial release in a Sony noir boxed set from 2009. Siegel makes the most of his modest budget, eschewing studio sets for actual San Francisco locations that add immeasurably the authenticity of the story and the action sequences, which are among the most ambitious of the era. The film derived from a popular TV series of the same name and features the star of the show, Warner Anderson, as a San Francisco detective, Lt. Ben Guthrie. His sidekick, Inspector Al Quine was originally played in the show by Tom Tully but the part in the film is played by Emile Meyer, whose mug perfectly suits the style of the movie. The \"Macguffin\" of this caper movie is an ornate doll loaded with heroin that has been carried into the United States by an innocent tourist (Raymond Bailey, the future Mr. Drysdale of \"The Beverly Hillbillies\".). The doll ends up in the hands of an equally innocent little girl and her mother who were on the same cruise ship. However, this is just a necessary plot device to present a fascinating character study of a team of criminals who are assigned to fly from Miami to San Francisco to claim the doll and deliver the drugs to a mysterious crime lord. Things go awry from the first few frames of the movie when an attempt to steal the tourist's luggage goes wrong, resulting in the death of a crime syndicate courier who bungles the first attempt to get the doll. The resulting action follows the desperate attempts by the Miami crooks to secure the missing drugs. Their lives depend on it because if they fail, the mob will suspect they have double-crossed them and kept the heroin for themselves. The criminal team is among the most psychotic ever seen on film. Dancer (Eli Wallach) is the younger man being groomed by his older mentor, Julian (Robert Keith, father of Brian Keith) to be his heir apparent. The two men are outwardly charismatic and friendly, but as the story progresses, we realize they are merciless sadists who will stop at nothing to get what they want. When they kidnap the young girl and her mother, we get a glimpse at exactly how devoid of human emotions they are.\n\nThe caper story, expertly penned by the great Sterling Silliphant, follows the efforts of the detectives to get to the drugs first-- but the cops are mere window dressing, as Siegel is clearly saving the best scenes for his hit men. Wallach and Keith rival that great pairing of Lee Marvin and Clu Gulager as the creepy criminal team in Siegel's memorable 1964 remake of The Killers. On one level, Keith is acting as a father to a younger man who might be seen as an adopted son. However, it doesn't take much to see that Siegel has introduced a very clear homoerotic element to the story which becomes even more apparent when the pair end up in a \"social club\" and hotel that very obviously caters to homosexual men. In case there is still too much subtlety for the viewer, the place is named the Seaman's Club! (In one of the film's best remembered sequences, Wallach \"offs\" a would-be lover in a steam room.) The film is packed with inventive sequences that are still somewhat shocking today. It's rather amazing that some of these scenes were not diluted by squeamish studio executives. A helpless woman and her young child are kidnapped and menaced, a man in a wheelchair is thrown to his death and any number of innocent people are put in harm's way by the relentless criminal's quest to secure the missing dope. Most impressive is the climax of the film wherein Siegel films an exciting car chase that culminates on an unfinished stretch of freeway. It will have you on the edge of your seat (look for an amazing bit of stunt work in which a car is driven at high speed within feet of dropping off the end of the construction site.) All the earmarks are evident for what would become trademarks of Siegel's films: the story moves quickly, there isn't a wasted frame and the performances are terrific.\n\nSony's DVD boasts an excellent transfer and some very interesting extras, though the studio once again undermines the latter features by not even bothering to mention them on the packaging. There is an interview with Christopher Nolan, who discusses the influence of noir films on his own work. There is also a feature length commentary track hosted by Eddie Muller of Turner Classic Movies and The Film Noir Foundation and bestselling crime novelist James Ellroy, whose work includes L.A. Confidential. Muller is extremely informative, conveying fascinating information about the film and the San Francisco locations. However, Ellroy, who describes himself as \"The White Knight of the Far Right\" wears out his welcome pretty quickly. His efforts to come across as politically incorrect become blatantly pretentious, as he peppers his comments with expletives and makes homophobic jokes with regularity. Even Muller seems a bit taken off balance by him. Nevertheless, Sony deserves kudos for allowing Ellroy's controversial commentaries to remain intact. If you can put up with Ellroy, you'll get some great insights into the film and Siegel's methods of working.\n\nThe Lineup is American film noir at its best.\n\n(This DVD is \"all region\", meaning it will play on any international system).\n\nClick here to order from the Cinema Retro Movie Store\n\nBy Hank Reineke\n\nRightfully or wrongfully, I’m going to concentrate this review of Mill Creek’s Sci-Fi from the Vault Blu on two of this Blu-ray set’s decidedly lesser films: Creature with the Atom Brain (1955) and The Thirty Foot Bride of Candy Rock (1959). This is partially due to the fact that the set’s two most prominent titles, 20 Million Miles to Earth and It Came from Beneath the Sea, were previously issued by Mill Creek back in 2014 on their twofer Ray Harryhausen Creature Double Feature from the same transfers. Though Creature with the Atom Brain is making its U.S. Blu debut on this set, the film has seen a previous Blu issue on the UK import Cold War Creatures: Four Films from Sam Katzman. So only The Thirty Foot Bride of Candy Rock is making a worldwide debut on Blu with this set.\n\nAll four films in this new set come, as per the title, from the vaults of Columbia studios. Creature earlier appeared on the commentary-free DVD set Sam Katzman: Icons of Horror Collection (2007). As I am not privy to the sales figures of that set, I can only surmise should Mill Creek release a Sci-Fi Vault Vol. 2 on Blu, we might see the “missing” Katzman titles sprinkled into a future U.S. set. This Mill Creek set is not an “all Katzman” edition (ala Icons). The workhorse producer has no connection to either 20 Million Miles to Earth or The Thirty Foot Bride of Candy Rock.\n\nIt’s with no disrespect to the late, great special effects wizard Ray Harryhausen that I’m not going to do a deep dive into 20 Million Miles to Earth and It Came from Beneath the Sea. Though these two films are genuine and iconic sci-fi classics, both have previously gotten the Mill Creek Blu treatment and also received transatlantic Blu releases as well. So I can’t imagine anyone interested in these Harryhausen-associated titles not already in possession of copies. Fair to say, if you own Mill Creek’s previously published twofer, their reappearances here are redundant.\n\nThis new set, priced at an MSRP of $29.99, is – happily - available far less expensively from any variety of on-line retailers. In some sense, it’s a bargain. This recent edition does offer a new and informative audio commentary on It Came from Beneath the Sea, courtesy of Justin Humphreys and C. Courtney Joyner. So if you’re an enthusiast of commentary tracks, that’s a checkmark in the plus column. On the other hand, there’s no audio commentary included on 20 Million Miles to Earth, a film no less deserving of annotation. So that’s a checkmark lost.\n\nOddly, Edward L. Chan’s Creature with the Atom Brain (1955), an arguably less-deserving film, does come with a commentary track – this time courtesy of film producer-writers’ Phoef Sutton and Mark Jordan Legan. It’s nice to have a commentary supplied by two established screenwriters since Creature producer Sam Katzman had conscripted the great Curt Siodmak (The Wolf Man) to script his low-budgeter. The often curmudgeonly Siodmak was a pretty productive scripter, memorably knocking off no fewer than nine sci-fi/horror programmers for Universal 1940-44 – and many other original scenarios for other studios.\n\nThough Siodmak provides a decent enough script for Creature, director Kahn’s film proves a B-film guilty pleasure a best. On their commentary, Sutton and Legan provide a breezy, lighthearted narration filled with the usual, occasionally colorful, anecdotes, often based on their rattling off resumes of the film’s various cast and crew member. To their credit, the two honestly acknowledge the film’s shortfalls, mulling that “the first four and a half minutes are the best thing about it.” The film is a bit of slow-going unless one has a sense of nostalgia about it.\n\nIt was late October 1954 when Variety reported that Katzman had tapped Kahn to direct Creature, the first of the producer’s first sci-fi feature film forays. News of actor Richard Denning signing on to star was reported the following week. Similar to Katzman, Kahn was a film industry workhorse, a director not identified with any one particular genre. In the 1950s, Kahn helmed war films, westerns, gangster pics and teenage melodramas. But he also managed to put the fright into the “Frightened Fifties,” cranking out no fewer than eight serviceable sci-fi pics in a four-year period: beginning with She Creature (1956) and finishing with Invisible Invaders (1959). Actor Denning provided a face familiar to 50’s sci-fi fans: the actor had lead roles in The Creature from the Black Lagoon, Target Earth and The Black Scorpion, to name only a few.\n\nIt was Columbia’s intention to bill the more pedestrian Creature as the supporting feature to It Came from Beneath the Sea. In June 1955 it was reported the double-bill was to be first rolled out to thirty-one theaters in and around the Los Angeles area. Both films would be produced under the aegis of Katzman’s Clover Productions. Though Kaufman’s low-budgeted independent offerings weren’t expected to bring in boffo box-office numbers, Columbia’s accountants were aware the absence of big name stars and inflated production costs brought better returns on investment.\n\nA trade paper reported bluntly that Columbia, “feels it’s better to make a 15% to 25% profit on a picture than to stand to lose 50% to 75% on a wholly-made studio picture.” While Katzman’s pictures for Columbia (Creature with the Atom Brain, The Giant Claw, Zombies of Mora Tau and The Werewolf) might not have produced great art, they did bring in worthwhile returns on investment. It Came from Beneath the Sea, the far stronger film (with a bigger budget) managed great business, helped in part by a combination of Harryhausen’s screen magic, word-of-mouth excitement and a supportive radio-television-print campaign of $250,000. Though It Came from Beneath the Sea was not the first “giant” monster movie of the 1950s, it was among the earliest, and this monstrous sci-fi sub-genre would blossom throughout the 1950s and well into the 1960s.\n\nWhich leads us into our discussion of the final “giant” film offered on this set. The working title of Sidney Miller’s The 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock was originally titled The Secret Bride of Candy Brock. The film’s co-screenwriter, Arthur Ross, was familiar writing for films featuring gargantuan(s): he had already helped craft the screenplay for Columbia’s The Three Worlds of Gulliver, a soon-to-be- released pic in 1960. But Candy Rock was to serve primarily as a vehicle for comedian Lou Costello. Though his 1940s heyday was behind him, the roly-poly actor had been introduced to a new generation of fans in the ‘50s through airings of The Abbott and Costello Show television series.\n\nThe 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock was to be the comedian’s first feature film project following the dissolution of his partnership with Bud Abbott in July of 1957. That pair’s final film, the saccharine comedy-drama Dance with Me, Henry (United Artists, 1956) was generally dismissed as a tired re-play of routines long gone cold. Now, as a solo player, Costello was hoping that Bride might reestablish his box-office prowess. This indie production, shot on the Columbia studios lot, saw Costello’s manager, Eddie Sherman, serving as the film’s executive producer. With such leverage Costello was even able to gift a small role to daughter Carole.\n\nProducer Lew Rachmil suggested to a reporter from London’s Picturegoer that Costello’s titular bride, Dorothy Provine (a 22 year-old blonde that stood 5’ 4” tall), was a “born comedienne – nearly as funny as Lou at times.” Provine was a relative newcomer to Hollywood, having worked only two studio soundstages, one for The Bonnie Parker Story and for a two- episode role as a twelve year old (!) on TV’s Wagon Train. Provine told gossiper Erskine Johnson that she hadn’t “missed a day’s work since I arrived in Hollywood, but I was always scared about every job being my last job.” She needn’t have worried, following Bride the actress was picked to star alongside Roger Moore as a regular character on the television series The Alaskans and would also have a prominent role in the 1963 Cinerama comedy It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.\n\nIn conception, Bride seems little more than Lou Costello’s attempt to lampoon the popularity of the ongoing “giant monster” craze. Whiling away his days in an amateur laboratory, Costello’s rubbish collector and would-be inventor Artie Pinsetter (‘a world-famous scientist who’s not famous yet”) is determined to unravel secrets: primarily he wishes to learn how the prehistoric beasts that once roamed a local region known “Dinosaur State Park” had achieved gargantuan sizes. He’s investigating an ancient Native American belief that these creatures achieved such measurement due to a mysterious stream of steam emissions emanating from a canyon cave.\n\nTo this end he has constructed an elaborate electronic contraption that he calls “Max.” His invention is part time machine – due to its ability for “changing time curves” - and part straight man. Pinsetter hadn’t needed to go through all the trouble of mechanical tinkering. Walking through the canyon, girlfriend Emmy Lou (Provine), accidentally walks through a plume of canyon steam and finds herself having gained an additional 25 feet in height. The steam, we are told, is the castoff of atomic energy escaping from the bowels of the earth.\n\nTo make matters worse for Pinsetter, we learn Emmy Lou is the niece of the town’s self-involved and self-important bank president/gubernatorial hopeful Raven Rossiter (Gale Gordon, of Our Miss Brooks fame). Rossiter doesn’t care much for Pinsetter, and his ill-tempered behavior provides much of the film’s lukewarm comic tension. But ultimately, the film’s concentration is whether or not the townies – and alarmed Pentagon officials – can escape the problems wrought by Costello’s foolish inventions or of his skulking thirty-foot bride.\n\nShot in the fanciful descriptions of “Wonderama” and “Mattascope,” Bride is not a great film by any measure. But having said this, it’s an innocuous 73-minute nostalgia trip that admittedly brought a number of head-shaking smiles to my face. The film is an innocent bit of nonsense, a “family-friendly” movie that I’m certain brought fun to kiddie audiences of its day. My favorite time capsule moment occurs when an airborne Costello nearly collides with the Soviet Union’s recently launched Sputnik 1 satellite.\n\nSadly, Lou Costello would not live to see the finished film released to the public. The legendary film star would die of a heart attack, just days shy of age 53, on March 3, 1959 – a mere ten weeks following his first day of shooting on Bride in November of 1958 (production wrapped a mere month later). On March 24, 1959, executives at Columbia announced the aforementioned title change. The film was still in editing by June of 1959 – as was the Three Stooges’ sci-fi comedy Have Rocket, Will Travel. In July Columbia shared plans to package Bride as a late summer trip bill of such other family fare films as Rocket and Ted Post’s The Legend of Tom Dooley.\n\nThere were studio previews as early as July 7, but when Bride finally was unleashed on movie screens it was not as one-third of the aforementioned package as scheduled - but rather as the under bill to Disney’s Darby O’ Gill and the Little People or Have Rocket, Will Travel. Though there were no critical raves for Bride – truthfully the film was undeserving of such praise – most reviewers found the film harmless and wholesome family entertainment. Which it was. I suppose it would have been in poor taste to completely dismiss the value of the final film of one of Hollywood’s most beloved – and successful – actor-comedians.\n\nIn any event, Mill Creek’s Sci-Fi from the Vault collection has made The 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock available for the first time on Blu-ray. Previously the film had only appeared on VHS by Columbia/Tri-Star in 1986 and – with a far lesser transfer - on the cheapie Good Times label in 1988. Its first digital appearance was a 2010 release as a DVD MOD from Sony/Columbia Screen Classics. So, regardless of merit, it’s nice to get this one on Blu. Its appearance here should interest fans of both Abbott and Costello-related productions as well as collectors of vintage 50s Silver Age sci-fi. There’s also a light-hearted but informative audio commentary for Bride provided by the Monster Party Podcast team. Think of a few wise-cracking - but informative - movie-buff friends sitting on the couch alongside you. The commentary adds a bit of color to an otherwise monochrome film.\n\nTo its credit, the set also includes two bonus features well worth a look: Daniel Griffith’s 25-minute doc They Came from Beyond: Sam Katzman at Columbia as well as his 14:30 minute doc Fantastical Features: Nathan Juran at Columbia. The former gives us a thumbnail tracing of Katzman’s career in film. The producer knocked out dozens of serials for Victory and Columbia - including Superman (1948) and Batman and Robin (1949) - from the mid-1930s on. He later moved on to producing features for Monogram – a studio described here as Hollywood’s “lowest echelon” - where he enjoyed the first of his feature film successes.\n\nKatzman’s films for Monogram and others were usually made on shoestring budgets with tight shooting schedules. The producer didn’t necessarily favor the horror sci-fi genre during his 40+ years working in Hollywood. But having employed Bela Lugosi on the 1936 serial Shadow of Chinatown, Katzman managed to bring the now underworked and underappreciated actor to Monogram for a series of guilty pleasure, fan-favorite cheapie horror-melodramas. But Katzman was not shy on capitalizing on whatever fad was capturing public fancy. His filmography included everything from ghetto dramas, gangster pics, East Side Kids/Bowery Boys comedies, westerns, sword and sandal epics, early rock n’ roll pics – even a couple of Elvis Presley films (Kissin’ Cousins (1964) and Harum Scarum (1965) .\n\nIn the mid-1950s, sensing sci-fi was proving popular with audiences, Katzman scored big as the Executive Producer on such less penny-pinching epics as It Came from Beneath the Sea and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956). Both of these films featured the completely amazing stop-motion special effects of the great Ray Harryhausen, with whom Katzman was happy to collaborate. In all likelihood, it’s the appreciative audience of so-called “Monster Kids” that continues to stoke interest in Katzman’s work.\n\nThe second bonus doc, Fantastical Features, has C. Courtney Joyner and Justin Humphreys taking a brief look at the films of the fast-shot flicks Nathan Juran directed for Columbia. Though not necessarily a horror/sci-fi film director, Juran had previously helmed The Black Castle (1952) for Universal and, more importantly, for that studio’s great giant insect epic The Deadly Mantis (1957). Once moving to Columbia, Juran managed a number of sci-fi/fantasy epics including such cinematic touchstones as 20 Million Miles to Earth, Attack of the 50 Foot Woman (1958) and The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958).\n\nFor the most part, all of these black-and-white films look great for their age, though they’re not entirely pristine: one can expect a few not terribly distracting scratches or speckling throughout. Personally, I’m not sure how many more times I will revisit Creature with the Atom Brain or The 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock – they’re not great films - but it’s still nice to add these titles to my ‘50s sci-fi film collection. You’ll have to decide if they’re worth adding to yours.\n\nClick here to order from Amazon and save 50% off SRP.\n\nAct Naturally: The Beatles on Film\n\nBy Steve Matteo\n\n344 pages• 978-1-4930-5901-0 • $24.95 • Paperback\n\nCinema Retro has received the following press release:\n\n“A terrific read that puts the Fabs’ films into an insightful and fact-filled context with a fresh perspective on just how important the movies were to their lasting legacy.” —Dennis Elsas, legendary WNEW FM and WFUV New York disc jockey and co-host of Fab Fourum on Sirius XM\n\n“With Act Naturally: The Beatles on Film, Steve Matteo provides readers with the definitive, go-to book for understanding the group’s cinematic forays.

Lon Chaney’s feature role casting was reported during the first week of September 1921, the film reportedly to be based on a scenario by Lucien Hubbard. The film was apparently still in production during late September/early October of 1921. Newspapers were reporting that immediately following Chaney’s completion of Wolf Breed, the actor “will appear in The Octave of Claudius for Goldwyn.” That film would in fact be made, but released as The Blind Bargain (1922), directed by Wallace Worsley - who would later helm Chaney’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Along with London after Midnight (1927), The Blind Bargain is inarguably the most sought after of the actor’s lost films.\n\nThe Trap, by any measure, is a more modest effort than any of the aforementioned trio of films. The photoplay features Lon Chaney as Gaspard the Good. His character is so named as he is a kind and gentle soul. He’s a simple-living, always smiling, bubbly effervescent personality - a man of good-standing in the small idyllic French Canadian mountain village of Grand Bellaire. But Gaspard’s usual pleasant demeanor will soon sour. Returning to the village from a recent trip, Gaspard discovers that he has not only lost his girlfriend Thalie (Dagmar Godowsky) to a seemingly well-to-do carpetbagger named Benson (Alan Hale), but also to his unregistered claim to his pappy’s hyacinth gemstone mine. Gaspard tries his best to sublimate his personal sorrows, one title card noting while “The morning sun was no more radiant,” the broken-spirited Gaspard managed to hold “no malice” within his heart. For a time, anyway.\n\nBut things change in the intervening span of seven – yes, seven – years. The cad Benson has suffered several reversals of fortunes, beginning with a calamitous cave-in dooming his mining operation. We also learn Benson has not been a particularly loving husband to sweet Thalie who we watch as she succumbs to a fatal illness. Her husband coldly dismisses his wife’s deathbed lethargy to “laziness.” Sitting astride Thalie’s bedside is her grieving five-year old son with Benson, “The Boy” (Stanley Goethals). Gaspard too has suffered a shocking reversal – a shift in personality as the last few years events have left him bitter. Though Benson’s recent streak of bad breaks should have brought Gaspard a measure of satisfying yin and yang closure, it’s simply wasn’t enough to erase the sting of his personal anguishes.\n\nSo seeking a more punishing revenge on Benson, Gaspard convinces a local tavern tough that the carpetbagger has been saying awful things about him. The enraged brute attempts to assail Benson who unexpectedly defends himself with a pistol shot – a crime for which he is sentenced to the gallows. But this sentence is later commuted to a prison sentence when the brute survives the shooting. In the interim, and as per Thalie’s deathbed wish, Gaspard has taken custody of her son - for whom the bitter ex-lover intends to administer a misplaced vengeance. But in short time the innocent “wee waif” reawakens the good in Gaspard’s heart who becomes a doting model foster parent to the child. But when Gaspard is informed that Benson has been released from prison with plans to collect his biological son, a distraught Gaspard - fearful of losing the boy - sets up a diabolical snare involving a trap door and a starving wolf lying in wait.\n\nIt’s a melodrama for sure. In its review of May 20, 1922, Billboard suggested while the storyline of The Trap was overly “trite,” the film itself was visually appealing with “most picturesque locations” and “photography showing some rare and perfect gems of outdoor beauty.” (The film was actually photographed not in the Canadian wilderness but in the tranquil and majestic canyons of Yosemite National Park). Chaney’s “remarkable impersonation” of the French-Canadian Gaspard was noteworthy, even though the review concedes “the vehicle is not sufficiently strong to do justice to the ability of the star.” This contrasts with the view of Variety’s critic who thought director Robert Thornby’s excessive use of full-frame close-ups of Chaney – which allowed a bit too much melodramatic over-emoting on the actor’s part – was nothing if not “tiresome.” Personally, I disagree with this assessment. Though there are no shortage of such close-ups, Chaney’s facial expressions on screen enable the actor to convey emotions of sorrow, joy, malice and anger in a visual manner that no title card could ever convey as successfully.\n\nThat said, The Trap was an idiosyncratic picture in some sense, and certainly an archetype of the tortured character roles Chaney would more famously play in the future. Many silent pictures of the day were structured around romantic angles in their scenarios. But following Gaspard’s loss of both mine and sweetheart Thalie (the actress being the daughter of the famed Lithuanian-American classical pianist Leopold Godowsky), the film drops any pretension of romantic conciliation or renewal. The movie instead focuses on Chaney’s dark, methodically-plotted and coldly calculated plan of revenge.\n\n“YOU CAN’T GET GOOD HELP THESE DAYS.”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nThese days, filmmaker Joseph Losey doesn’t get the acclaim he deserves. An American who showed great talent in Hollywood in the early 1940s and was well on his way to a lucrative and respectable career, got sidelined by HUAC—the House Un-American Activities Committee. Because Losey had ties with the early Communist Party in the U.S., he, along with many, many other artists working in Tinsel Town, was blacklisted. He fled his native country to the United Kingdom, where he remained until his death. Losey made films in England and France, many of which are admired films noir. In the 1960s and beyond he moved toward making provocative art films, working with writers such as Harold Pinter and generally pushing the envelope in the cinema.\n\nThe Servant (1963) is one of those art films that Losey made, and it was his first collaboration with playwright Pinter (they did three pictures together). Based on a 1948 novella by Robin Maugham, The Servant is also one of Pinter’s first attempts at screenwriting. Pinter had been enjoying some success in the theatre since the late 1950s but was still not yet a fully established theatrical superstar at that time (this would occur a couple of years later). His own adaptation of his play, The Caretaker, was also made in 1963. Pinter took Maugham’s novella and re-tooled it to emphasize the class warfare that is going on in the subtext of the story, as well as adding what can only be described as the Pinter’s Theatre of Menace—a sense of subtle, unnerving threat that exists in most all of his work.\n\nThe story is about a wealthy international real estate developer, Tony (James Fox, in a debut role), a bachelor who hires a manservant, Hugo Barrett (Dirk Bogarde). They get along splendidly at first, although Tony’s girlfriend, Susan (Wendy Craig), senses something off about Barrett and wants Tony to get rid of him. Tony refuses. Barrett one day convinces Tony to hire his sister, Vera (Sarah Miles), to be a maid. Vera seduces Tony one night when Barrett is away. But then one day Tony and Susan come home to the flat and find Vera and Barrett in bed together. Turns out they’re not brother and sister at all. And then the tale takes a sharp left turn into nightmare territory as relationships change and power dynamics are reversed. To reveal more would spoil the creepiness of what happens next.\n\nThe Servant is a powerful, disturbing film. The crowning touch is the superb, unsettling performance by Bogarde, who won the BAFTA award that year for Best Actor (the film was nominated for Best Picture). The movie was ignored by the Oscars, but Pinter did win the award for Best Screenplay by the New York Film Critics Circle. Today, the movie resides at #22 on the BFI Top 100 British Films of the 20th Century list.\n\nLosey’s perceptive direction masterfully uses mise-en-scène in a carefully staged sense of place that is claustrophobic and austere. He treats the theatre-of-the-absurd goings-on with absolute sincerity and realism… a perfect approach to Pinter’s exceptional dialogue and the mood established by the piece.\n\nThe Servant is very much an adult film, something that couldn’t have been made in America in 1963, and it’s a bit surprising that Britain’s censors weren’t all over it. But, then again, everything lies in the subtext. What you don’t see on screen can’t be censored, can it? The film is a brilliant display of shocking subject matter done in an ordinary, matter-of-fact presentation.\n\nThe Criterion Collection’s new Blu-ray release features a new 4K digital restoration with an uncompressed monaural soundtrack. It shows off the striking black and white cinematography by Douglas Slocombe, a longtime British DP who later won three Academy Awards (including one for Raiders of the Lost Ark).\n\nSupplements include a new, interesting overview of Joseph Losey’s career by film critic Imogen Sara Smith; a rare audio interview with Losey from 1976; a revealing 1996 interview with Harold Pinter; vintage interviews with actors Dirk Bogarde, Sarah Miles, James Fox, and Wendy Craig; and the theatrical trailer. The enclosed booklet contains an essay by author Colm Tóibín.\n\nThe Servant is for fans of Joseph Losey, Harold Pinter, and, especially, Dirk Bogarde, who owns this motion picture. His portrayal of Hugo Barrett surely upends the old adage that ‘you can’t get good help these days.’\n\nClick here to order from Amazon.\n\nBy Hank Reineke\n\nThe fifteenth annual New York City Independent Film Festival was held during the week of June 4 through 11 at Manhattan’s Producer’s Club on West 44th Street, a few blocks west of Times Square. The week-long festival would host the screenings of over two hundred indie films. Co-Directors John Anderson and Bob Sarles' absorbing and authoritatively assembled music doc Born in Chicago, screened on the festival’s final day, doesn’t pretend to serve as the definitive nor most academically-minded treatise on the history of blues music in America. Such studies as the seven-episode PBS series The Blues (2003) had already touched lightly on many aspects of multi-layered history of the blues in America. This film’s primary interest lies elsewhere.\n\nThe state of Mississippi, the birthplace of the blues and home of some of the music’s greatest practitioners is, of course, referenced early on in Born in Chicago. But the fertile musical and agricultural area surrounding the Mississippi Delta region serves merely as the pregnant preface of what’s to come. There’s no mention that I can recall of the high-end music of band leader W.C. Handy, the self-proclaimed “Father of the Blues,” or of Ma Rainy, “Mother of the Blues” or even of such a master figure as songster Charley Patton, the acknowledged progenitor of the rough and tumble country blues.\n\nAlan Lomax’s 1941-1942 Library of Congress recordings of one McKinley Morganfield (soon to be rechristened as “Muddy Waters”) down on Stovall’s Plantation near Clarksdale, MS is briefly referenced in Born in Chicago, but only in passing. The film recalls Waters as merely one of the many immigrant blues singers who, among non-musical travelers and those feeling racism and economic hardship, would abandon Mississippi - and neighboring states - to seek employment in Chicago’s burgeoning meat-packing and steel industries.\n\nThe blues singers arriving in the Windy City would often perform for pocket change on Chicago’s fabled Maxwell Street, and there’s a bit of historic film footage included in the film to document it. But ultimately Born in Chicago assumes that a knowledgeable blues aficionado is already conversant with the complex reasons that Chicago would birth the raw and immeasurably emotive electric blues. Born in Chicago soon time-jumps from a basic introductory primer to a particular moment in history – a period roughly encompassing 1964 through 1970 - when public interest in the blues music would peculiarly shift along color lines.\n\nThough the blues was created by black artists for a primarily black audience, by the mid-1960s it was lovingly embraced by a cabal of young, white and often gifted musicians. In some sense these mostly suburban youngsters were oddballs. Not only were they complete outsiders to African-American life and musical culture, but estranged from even their own middle-class heritages. The best of them were determined to apprentice with the real-deal blues masters whose recordings they had painstakingly studied and cherished.\n\nSuch Chicago blues artists as Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf (aka Chester Burnett), and Little Walter Jacobs were at their musical – if not money-earning career peaks – in the 1950s. Though Chicago boasted any number of record labels pressing 78 rpm discs of the talent grinding their music out almost nightly in such saloons as Pepper’s Lounge, Silvio’s, Smitty’s Corner, Big John’s, the Blue Flame Lounge, and Frost’s Corner, it was Chess Records that emerged the most important and iconic. Though label co-founder Leonard Chess appears in an archive footage interview alongside his son Marshall, Born in Chicago wisely chooses not to revisit the company’s backstory. That’s a tale already told in several docs as well as in Darnell Martin’s ill-disguised Chess-mirror fiction-feature Cadillac Records (2008).\n\nThere’s lots of archival footage threaded throughout Born in Chicago. Some of the film’s moodiest and most intimate saloon environ images come courtesy of several reels of silent B-roll 8mm color footage shot by drummer Sam Lay and his wife. Lay is an important figure here due to his key role in the blues tradition’s transition: he not only worked the South Side taverns with nearly all the blues giants but was also a founding member (along with bassist Jerome Arnold) in the inter-racial Paul Butterfield Blues Band.\n\nThough not a concert film by any means – all performances featured in Born in Chicago are offered in truncated form - there are extended clips of Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf to offer insight into the power of their stage presence and hypnotic powers. This inclusion is not unreasonable as the two singers were the figurehead totems of the Chicago blues scene of the 1950s. Muddy and Wolf were also among the most generous and least suspicious of interlopers. They were appreciative of the enthusiasm and interest of these young, white blues revivalists and allowed them to share the stage and showcase their talents.\n\nOf course, Muddy and Wolf didn’t singularly or together create the Chicago blues scene. During the course of Born in Chicago we’re briefly introduced to a number of the first and second wave Chicago’s bluesmen, as well as the iconic sidemen who helped create the sound: Otis Spann, Yank Rachel, Robert Lockwood, Willie Dixon, Junior Wells, Sonny Boy Williamson, Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, Hubert Sumlin, Magic Sam, Walter and Big Walter “Shakey” Horton all pass through the film in either image or musical snippet, all honorably referenced as “engines” of the scene.\n\nThough the blues was derived partly from African musical traditions, the blues as the world knows it today was birthed in the area of the Mississippi Delta. Chicago blues was, at the very beginning anyway, mostly an electric, highly amplified extension of that earlier homegrown music, improvised out-of-necessity to cut through the din of celebratory patrons gathered inside cramped and sweaty neighborhood taverns.\n\nThe 1950s was the decade Chicago’s blues scene was at its creative peak. The musicians who arrived in Chicago during the great migration from the southern U.S. quickly bonded to a natural audience. They were warmly embraced by audiences that were once – and now again - neighbors. The musicians and their fans shared similar customs, life experiences and musical interests, and such familiarity allowed Chicago’s blues scene to thrive during the 1950s.\n\nBut by the early 1960s, the musical tastes of black audiences began to shift, particularly among younger listeners. This group held no bonding memories or immediate connections to blues or rustic southern musical culture. The rhythm-and-blues and soul of Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, and James Brown was in emergence and such artists were now the most favored of black audiences. It wasn’t long until the Motown and Stax labels would supplant Chess as the recording mecca for black artists.\n\nBut just as black interest in blues was seemingly on the wane, there was a sudden curious interest in the art by young, rebellious and hip Midwestern middle-class whites. Their passion for the music was often ignited by their discovery of late-night broadcasts of blues and old-school R&B found on the far ends of their radio dials. Many of these disciples – which would include such 1960’s blues and rock luminaries as Barry Goldberg, Michael Bloomfield, Nick Gravenites, Paul Butterfield, Corky Siegel, Harvey Mandel, Charlie Musselwhite, Elvin Bishop, Steve Miller and Bob Dylan – are all featured in Born in Chicago. It could be argued they were actually re-born in Chicago.\n\nIn any case, this is the time period under analysis in Born in Chicago. Liberal and open-minded students attending (or merely hanging on the fringes) of the University of Chicago – the campus itself nestled within the city’s Southside – played a role in the blossoming blues revival. Through the interventions of on-campus folk music clubs Chicago U. would stage not only small folk-music gatherings but several important folk music festivals – several showcasing such blues artists as Willie Dixon, Memphis Slim, Big Joe Williams and blind street singer Arvella Gray. This new interest in folk-blues music brought many students and scene hanger-on’s to Chicago’s pawn shops in search of guitars and friends and subsequent musical fellow travelers.\n\nThe most dedicated – and talented of these musicians – would reverse “integrate” these black-only Southside blues taverns - often under the suspicious and unwelcome gaze of black patrons in attendance. But both Muddy and Wolf and their respective band members would embrace such musicians as guitarist Michael Bloomfield and blues harpist Paul Butterfield et.al. once they realized these searching white youngsters – many demonstrating superlative musical talent – were looking to absorb, as best they could, the essence and emotional comport of the blues.\n\nBy Doug Oswald\n\nLee Marvin is an American soldier suspected of aiding the enemy during the Korean War in “Sergeant Ryker” released on Blu-ray by Kino Lorber. Shortly after the release of the “The Dirty Dozen” in 1967, Universal saw fit to repackage a two-part 1964 Kraft Suspense Theatre courtroom drama “The Case Against Paul Ryker” and release it as feature film in theaters. As can be seen from the art reproduced on the Blu-ray cover, Universal was selling the release as an action-packed military movie not unlike “The Dirty Dozen” which was a big hit for MGM. Marvin also won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for 1965’s “Cat Ballou,” and became an in demand A-list star in a series of popular movies that followed. “The Dirty Dozen” pushed him into superstar status and one can hardly blame Universal for cashing in by repurposing the two-part TV episode as a theatrical release.\n\nThe production follows the trial of Sergeant Paul Ryker in 1951 during the Korean War. Ryker’s just been found guilty of treason and is sentenced to death for collaborating with the Chinese. He returned to his unit with the fantastic story of being sent on a secret mission behind enemy lines to gather information. The problem is the general who allegedly sent him on the mission died while Ryker was gone and a mysterious letter left by the general was never found. What follows are attempts by his wife and defense attorney to gather evidence after being granted a retrial. Most of the “action” is limited to Ryker’s jail cell in Tokyo and consists mostly of courtroom drama and in a flashback the one action scene involving his wife and lawyer.\n\nMarvin, no stranger to portraying military characters, served in the Marine Corps during WWII and was wounded during the Battle of Saipan in 1944. He’s very good here as Ryker and there are a couple of scenes when Marvin is about to jump out of the screen going from calm to crazy and back again in a matter of seconds. Marvin died way too young at age 63 leaving many memorable classic movies in his list of credits.\n\nThe production also features top notch performances from Bradford Dillman as Captain David Young, Ryker’s defense attorney, Peter Graves as Major Frank Whittaker, the prosecutor, and Vera Miles as Ann Ryker, the estranged wife of Sergeant Ryker. The cast also features a fine cast of character actors who will be familiar to anyone who watched broadcast TV and movies in the 60s and 70s including Lloyd Nolan, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell to name just a few.\n\nBuzz Kulik, a veteran television director with a few feature films to his credit, directed the original “Kraft Suspense Theatre” two-part episodes which was originally broadcast on October 10th and October 17th of 1964. Kraft Theatre lasted for two seasons from 1964 to 1966 spanning 59 episodes, filmed at Universal Studios and broadcast on NBC. Interestingly, a spinoff series released by ITV titled “Court Martial” featured Dillman and Graves in their “Ryker” roles as military lawyers and it ran for 26 episodes from 1965 to 1966 with the setting changed from the Korean War to WWII Europe.\n\nThe 1968 movie release does not fulfill the promise made on the poster art: “Lee Marvin Explodes into action as Sergeant Ryker.” We do see plenty of Ryker getting angry while sitting in his jail cell and in the courtroom. The bulk of the action consists of his lawyer and his wife riding in a Jeep and attacked by the enemy in Korea as they search for evidence in Ryker’s case. The movie, which clocks in at 85 minutes, would be easy to dismiss as a theatrical release, but it plays rather well on the small screen. The Blu-ray looks and sounds terrific and a nice surprise for me was the score by John Williams.\n\nExtras include the trailer for this and other Kino Lorber releases. Also included is a fascinating audio commentary by film historian and filmmaker Daniel Kremer who details the history of made-for-television productions which were released theatrically. The Blu-ray is worth the purchase for the audio commentary alone. What would have been nice is the option to watch the made for television version, but I’m happy to see this version on Blu-ray. Highly recommended.\n\nClick here to order from Amazon\n\nRETRO-ACTIVE: FROM THE CINEMA RETRO ARCHIVES.\n\n\"BIG TOP HILARITY\"\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nFinally! Chaplin fans can rejoice that The Criterion Collection has at last released the long-awaited missing entry in their run of excellent Blu-ray and DVD editions of the filmmake's feature films. For a while it appeared that The Circus, one of the auteur's best and certainly, arguably, his funniest picture, was forgotten, as it's been a few years since Criterion's last Chaplin release. Now, here it is. (The only features that remain to be given the Criterion treatment are A Woman of Paris from 1923, which didn't star Chaplin, and A King in New York, from 1957, his last starring vehicle. A Countess from Hong Kong, from 1967, perhaps doesn't count.)\n\nThe Circus was made just as Hollywood was beginning the transition from silents to talkies. There were still plenty of silent pictures being produced in 1928, and the move to sound wouldn't be seriously completed until 1930 (or, in some rural areas of the country, 1931!). Ironically, Chaplin chose to make an additional silent comedy in 1931, City Lights, and a semi-silent movie, Modern Times, in 1936!\n\nCharlie is The Tramp, of course. Broke and penniless, he wanders near a traveling circus and, while eluding the police who mistakenly suspect him of being a pickpocket, accidentally finds himself in the Big Top ring in front of an audience. They find his antics hilarious, and the cruel and greedy proprietor/ringmaster (Al Ernest Garcia) hires him on the spot, mainly to take advantage of him. The Tramp does not realize he's funny and how much he's worth! Then there's the bareback rider (Merna Kennedy), with whom Charlie falls in love. He sets out to protect her from the abuse inflicted by the boss.\n\nThat's the story in a nutshell, but it's the collection of hilarious set pieces that make this film a classic. The opening pickpocket/sideshow/fun house sequence is inventive and clever. Charlie's introduction into the circus, and especially his unwitting messing up of the magician's act, provides belly laughs. But the real stroke of brilliance is the climax of the movie, when Charlie attempts a tightrope act and is beleaguered by a group of monkeys that have gotten loose. One of these primates, an impish cutie named Josephine, appeared in many movies of the period. How her trainer got her to bite Charlie's nose without hurting him is a marvel.\n\nIt's interesting to note that The Circus practically disappeared for decades until Chaplin dug it out again in the 1960s to provide the original score and title song, restore the feature, and re-release it. It had a reputation of being a lesser work, mainly because it had been made during a painful time in Chaplin's personal life and he may have suppressed it. The truth is that the film is underrated -terribly so. It's one of the genius's masterworks.\n\nCriterion's new 4K digital restoration of the 1969 re-release version (the only one we can get, I presume) is beautifully presented with an uncompressed monaural soundtrack. Chaplin's own original score, complete with a vocal title song (\"Swing Little Girl\", sung by Chaplin himself) sounds terrific. A new audio commentary by Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance accompanies the feature.\n\nSupplements abound. New to the Criterion edition include a fascinating interview with Chaplin's son Eugene (complete with home movies); a wonderful and eye-opening examination of the visual effects and production design of the film with film scholar Craig Barron (\"In the Service of the Story\"); footage of 1969 interviews on Chaplin's Swiss estate; an audio interview from 1998 with musical associate Eric James; and newly discovered outtakes of the Tramp and the Bareback Rider. There is also a nearly half-hour documentary from 2003, \"Chaplin Today: The Circus\", that provides insight into the troubled production; unused sequences with a new score by Timothy Brock and related outtakes; excerpts from the recording session of \"Swing Little Girl\"; footage from the 1928 Hollywood premiere with appearances by many celebrities; and re-release trailers. The package booklet sports an essay by critic Pamela Hutchinson.\n\nThe Circus demands to be reevaluated and cherished as a treasure from one of cinema's most important creative artists. This one's a must.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER FROM AMAZON\n\nBy Lee Pfeiffer\n\nBy the year 1972, the esteemed Billy Wilder was licking his wounds over the boxoffice debacle that was \"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes\". Wilder's revisionist depiction of the legendary sleuth is precisely what Holmes fan clamor for today, but to a generation that defined the depiction of Holmes and Watson by the low-budget film series starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, there was little enthusiasm to see an all-too human Holmes with all-too-human failings. Wilder blamed the poor reception for the film on the fact that the studio had overridden his objections and made major cuts to the movie. Years ago, some of the missing footage was discovered and the altered film was accepted favorably by reviewers and retro movie lovers. Still, at the time, Wilder was not used to suffering the humiliation of public rejection of one of his movies. After all, he had given us classics such as \"Some Like It Hot\", \"The Apartment\", \"Sabrina\", \"Double Indemnity\" and \"Stalag 17\". Wilder was eager to return to his comedic roots and for his next film, \"Avanti!\" and he enlisted long-time collaborator Jack Lemmon to star and his esteemed writing partner I.A.L. Diamond to co-author the script with him. The stars seemed be aligned for another Wilder comedy hit, but it didn't work out that way, to put it mildly. \"Avanti!\" was another critical and commercial failure and this time it really hurt. Henceforth, the few films Wilder would direct would all be bombs, marking an inglorious end to an otherwise glorious career. Yet, \"Avanti!\" deserved a better fate. It's certainly Wilder in an inspired mode even if the inspiration came from a flop Broadway comedy production that he and Diamond kept the basic plot premise of but otherwise rewrote.\n\nWilder and Lemmon had enjoyed such audience-pleasing hits as \"Some Like It Hot\", \"The Apartment\", \"Irma La Douce\" and \"The Fortune Cookie\". Lemmon is well-cast as Wendell Armbruster, Jr., the son of a titan of American industry who has just died in an automobile accident in Italy where he went every year for a month-long personal sabbatical to cleanse his body and soul. Wendell is already in a state of nervous panic when we first see him on board the flight to Italy. He has just a few days to arrange to bring his father's body back to Washington, D.C. where a high profile televised funeral will take place with the President and other world dignitaries in attendance. (It's never explained why the Armbruster family self-imposed such a tight deadline for retrieving the body and staging the funeral.) Wendell idolized his father as the symbol of American family values and conservative political doctrine; a robust Republican who socialized with Henry Kissinger and who was devoted to Wendell's mother. Upon arrival in the quaint coastal town where his father died at his favorite small hotel, Wendell is greeted by the manager, Carlo Carlucci (Clive Revill), an unflappable local \"Mr. Fix-It\" with a penchant for reassuring words and an ability to move mountains to carry out impossible tasks. However, Wendell is in for a shock when he meets Pamela Piggott (Juliet Mills), a working class girl from East London whose mother also died in the same car crash as Wendell Sr. Turns out the two were lovers who met for the past ten years at the hotel, where they were adored local legends. Thus begins a madcap farce in which Wendell has to deal with the emotional revelation that his father was an adulterer while at the same time keeping family members and the public in the dark about the scandal. Pamela has a different attitude. Unlike Wendell, she knew of the affair long ago and assures Wendell that the two were madly in love and could fulfill their fantasies through their annual reunion. Wendell also learns that his ultra conservative father would join his lover for daily nude swim.\n\nIf the conventional wisdom in Hollywood is that comedies must run under two hours, Wilder was happy to ignore it. \"Avanti!\" clocks in at 144 minutes. It's as though he was celebrating the leisurely Italian lifestyle depicted in the film, a lifestyle that can be both simultaneously maddening and idyllic. Do we have to tell you that Wendell and Pamela lock horns only to become lovers themselves, even going so far as to replicate the dear departed's daily nude swim in the best-remembered scene from the movie? Despite the lengthy running time, the film is never boring and the performances are all top-notch with both Lemmon and Mills in fine form. However, the scene-stealer is Clive Revill in a remarkably funny performance. You'll swear you're watching an Italian actor instead of a native New Zealander who made his mark in British film and stage productions. The movie is peppered with some genuine Italian character actors, as Wendell becomes embroiled with a local group of poverty-row mobsters. Wilder and Diamond also mix in an amusing murder and blackmail plot. There is a late appearance by the marvelous Edward Andrews as a U.S. State Department official who arrives to resolve Wendell's problem of getting his father's body back home in time for the funeral. For all the laughs, however, there is a poignancy to the story, as Wendell learns to love and admire Pamela, who has initially disparages because of her \"weight problem.\" This is an uncomfortable aspect of the movie not only because Juliet Mills most decidedly did not have a \"weight problem\", but she endures (as women did during this era) constant barbs and insults and even makes self-deprecating jokes about her non-existent girth.\n\n\"Avanti!\" may not be classic Wilder, but it's very good Wilder and that's enough to merit a \"highly recommended\" designation.The film is currently streaming on Screenpix, which is available to Amazon Prime subscribers for an additional fee of $2.99 a month.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER KINO LORBER BLU-RAY FROM AMAZON\n\nSUPERMAN Web3 Movie Experience\n\nIconic DC Super Hero Film Being Released as a Multimedia Living Movie Experience from Warner Bros.

Whalen\n\nBurt Reynolds was a movie star who became a “Hollywood Legend” the hard way—he earned it. He started out in small roles on TV in the 50s and 60s, went to Europe and made some spaghetti westerns, just like his pal Clint Eastwood. He had his own TV series (“Hawk” and “Dan August”) and gained stardom on the big screen after playing Lewis, one of the four guys in “Deliverance,” who run into bad luck at the hands of some good ol’ boys in the Tennessee backwoods. He became a superstar with the release of “Smokey and the Bandit” (1977), which he starred in with Sally Field and Jackie Gleason. His career ended with “The Last Movie Star,” (2017), where he basically played himself, a faded legend, who still manages to hold onto his dignity. He was about to play a small role in Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood (2019)” but died in 2018 before filming began.\n\nHis career had a lot of peaks and valleys. “Heat” (1986), now available on Blu-Ray from Kino Lorber, while an entertaining movie with Reynolds at his charismatic best, was definitely not one of the peaks. Considering it was written by Oscar-winning writer William Goldman, (“All the President’s Men” and “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,”) and directed by Dick Richards (“Farewell My Lovely”), it should have been a lot better than it is. Reynolds plays Nick Escalante (also known as “Mex”), a Las Vegas bodyguard who dreams of one day leaving the rat race in the States and going to Venice, Italy to enjoy La Dolce Vita. Hmmm. That sort of reminds me of another guy William Goldman wrote about once, only he wanted to go to Bolivia. Anyway as “Heat” begins, Mex takes on a couple of jobs that he probably should have known better than to accept. One has him protecting a nerdy dude by the name of Cyrus Kinnick (Peter McNichol), who thinks he needs a bodyguard in case he wins big at the casino. Mex doesn’t last long on the job when he discovers Kinnick’s idea of big winnings is $50, and he quits. The other is a call for help from Holly (Karen Young) a Vegas hooker, an old friend of his, who was beaten and raped in a casino hotel room by three guys. She asks him to help her get revenge.\n\nMex (you probably couldn’t use that nickname today) finds out the rapist is a punk Mafioso by the name of Danny DeMarco (Neill Barry), who has two musclebound bodyguards of his own. Mex never carries a gun, but he’s known for being an expert with anything that has a sharp cutting edge. He pays them a visit and takes all three of them down with nothing more than the sharp edge of two credit cards and a few flying kicks, a-la Bruce Lee. He calls Holly up from the lobby and she takes a pair of scissors out of her purse and leaves Danny with a little souvenir on his private parts. She finds $20,000 that Danny had flashed around to tease Mex with earlier and offers half to him. He turns it down and tells her to leave town. It turns out Danny is connected to a local Mafia boss by the name of “Baby.”\n\nHolly leaves town but manages to get 10 grand to him, which becomes a plot device that reveals that Mex has a gambling addiction problem. He takes the money, turns it into $100,000 at the Blackjack table run by a dealer named Cassie (Diana Scarwid), and ends up losing it all. So now we know why Mex has trouble paying the airfare to Venice. Kinnick shows up again and asks if he can just hang out with him so he can learn how to be a cool tough guy like him. Sounds dumb, doesn’t it? It is. Somehow, even though there’s a meeting with “Baby,” and later an action setpiece with Danny and some new goons he’s hired, the story loses momentum.\n\nPart of the problem is Goldman’s script, which is all over the place, with enough story elements for at least two different movies. Or maybe they planned to spin it off into a TV series. But the biggest problem with “Heat” is what was happening behind the scenes during production. “Heat” was originally to be helmed by Robert Altman. That deal fell through, so they brought in Dick Richards to direct and for some reason Richards and Reynolds didn’t get along. It got so bad that a fight erupted and Reynolds punched Richards in the face. Richards left the picture after directing only 13 percent of it and sued Reynolds. “That punch cost me half a million,” Reynolds said. Television director Jerry Jameson was brought in to finish the picture without receiving a credit.\n\nIt’s too bad in a way that Altman didn’t take the job after all. Goldman’s screenplay, with all the various story ideas bouncing around in it, would probably have been right up Altman’s alley. He might have come up with something on the order of his earlier hits “The Long Goodbye” (1973) or “California Split” (1974).\n\nKino Lorber presents “Heat” in its original 1.78:1 aspect ratio in a very clean 1920x1080p transfer. A rollicking audio commentary is provided by action film historians Brandon Bentley and Mike Leeder. The disc also contains previews of a number of Burt Reynolds films available from Kino Lorber. In case you’re wondering if Mex ever get to Venice… I’ll never tell. But, if he did, let’s hope he made out better than that other guy did in Bolivia. Recommended primarily for Burt Reynolds fans.\n\nClick here to order from Amazon\n\n(John M.

He was dispatched to Palermo in Sicily in the mid-1920s with the specific task of destroying the power and influence of the Mafia, who held a vicious and all-controlling stranglehold on the island. The Mafia were responsible for hundreds of brutal murders every year, bribed officials, and were a prime reason why so many lived in poverty. Mori was a man on a mission, and would stop at nothing to break this criminal organisation. He was extraordinarily successful. His reasoning was that it was not enough to simply arrest people: The citizens of Sicily had to see that the authorities could help them and that they no longer needed the Mafia for protection.\n\nFollowing his promotion to the senate, where ultimately he fell afoul of Mussolini after expressing concern over Italy’s relationship with Hitler, he wrote his memoirs about the role he played in breaking the Mafia, and it was this that inspired the 1977 production of The Iron Prefect, starring Giuliano Gemma in the title role. Gemma was well-known to audiences thanks to his role in such Spaghetti Westerns as A Pistol for Ringo (1965, Duccio Tessari) and Day of Anger (Tonino Valerii, 1967) and he would even appear in Dario Argento’s Tenebrae a few years later in 1982. Despite being around twenty years younger than the actual Mori, he creates a believable, authoritative character, and one can see why the Sicilian police were willing to follow his sometimes-unorthodox methods. The film features Claudia Cardinale in a supporting role as the struggling mother of a young boy whose father was an influential leader of the Mafia, but having had enough, she wants to try and secure a better life for the boy away from Sicily. It was ably directed on location by Pasquale Squitieri, who was himself no stranger to the Western, and had also made other films about organised crime and the Mafia, including Camorra (1972) and The Climber (1975).\n\nIt’s an easy comparison to make, but one can’t help but think of the Sicilian section of The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972), and this film makes an excellent companion piece to that: Sicily is hot, dry and crumbling, where peasants are armed with shotguns and the authorities are powerless to do anything about the criminal gangs who brazenly murder entire families to maintain control, until Cesare Mori arrives of course. The Iron Prefect has been restored in 2K from the original negative and is available here from new boutique label Radiance Films with new and archival extras. As Squitieri and Gemma are sadly no longer with us, an archival interview with them both recorded in 2009 provides fascinating insight, and there is also a new interview with Squitieri’s biographer Domenico Monetti. My favourite bonus feature here is an appreciation of Giulliano Gemma by writer, director and western fan Alex Cox who goes into detail and brings wit and style to the piece. If Alex Cox, host of the important Moviedrome series of film screenings on British television in the late nineties, could shoot videos like this for all of Radiance’s releases, I for one would be very happy. The limited edition of The Iron Prefect comes with a booklet featuring new writing by Italian cinema expert Guido Bonsaver and an original article on the real-life Cesare Mori and his Mafia raid as depicted within the film.\n\nThis is another excellent release from Radiance, who have rapidly become a popular and collectible label with an eclectic mix of world classic and cult cinema. Cinema Retro recently interviewed founder Francesco Simeoni about the label.

He was 94 years old. Maharis had a multifaceted career, starring on TV, stage and motion pictures. He also found some success as a singer in the 1960s. Maharis,a native of Queens, New York, studied at the Actors Studio and became a popular presence on American television, guest starring on many hit shows. His popular role on \"Route 66\" ended before the third season had concluded. It was said that the producers of \"Route 66\" released him from the show because of suspected homosexuality in an era that was intolerant towards gays in the film industry, though other variations of his departure centered on his health and his desire to leave TV for motion pictures. He parlayed his popularity on TV into modest stardom on the big screen. Among his films: \"Exodus\", \"Sylvia\", \"The Satan Bug\" and \"The Happening\". Maharis was not without controversy. In 1967, he was arrested for engaging in \"lewd conduct\". He appeared nude in \"Playgirl\" magazine in 1973.The following year, he was arrested on charges of soliciting sex. The case was widely reported in the media and arguably had a negative impact on Maharis's career.\n\nMaharis, who was of Greek heritage, boasted the kind of good looks that made him a heart throb at the height of his career. His last screen credit was the suspense thriller \"Doppelganger\" in 1993, after which he retired from show business.

What a time it was, with so many eclectic films playing simulataneouosly. Enjoy this trip down memory lane.\n\nREVIEW: \"TRUCK TURNER\" (1974) STARRING ISAAC HAYES AND YAPHET KOTTO; BLU-RAY SPECIAL EDITION FROM KINO LORBER STUDIO CLASSICS\n\nBy Lee Pfeiffer\n\nIt's easy to look back on the Blaxploitation film craze of the 1970s as a short-lived period that spawned some cinematic guilty pleasures. However, time has been kind to the genre and if retro movie buffs view some of the films that emerged during this era they will undoubtedly find more artistry at work than was originally realized. Case in point: \"Truck Turner\", a 1974 action flick released at the height of the Blaxploitation phenomenon. I had never seen the film prior to its release on the new Blu-ray special edition from Kino Lorber Studio Classics. It's a violent, brutal film filled with ugly characters and \"heroes\" who deserve that moniker only because they aren't quite as abhorrent as the cutthroat antagonists they face. Yet, there is something special about \"Truck Turner\". Amid the carnage and frequent, extended action sequences, there is real talent at work here. Most of it belongs to Jonathan Kaplan, the director who ha"
