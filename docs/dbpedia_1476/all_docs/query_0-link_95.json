        "text": "Chronicling the ongoing disaster that is the Trump (mis)administration, proving the educator maxim: \"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.\"\n\nThe Trump administration is The Bog of Eternal Stench...\n\nThe 1986 movie Labyrinth had one very colorful and memorable element: The Bog of Eternal Stench. The bog regularly emits unpleasant gurgles, belches, and other noises, and sends forth a repulsive odor. (Sound familiar?) Legend has it that if you put so much as one toe in the Bog you will smell bad....forever. This is the fate which has befallen all of those who have associated themselves with this White House occupancy. They have fouled themselves. Even the once respectable H.R. McMaster has taken on the stench, having multiple times abandoned all self-respect to go forth to mislead, excuse, and explain away any mis-deed of those in Trump's circle. While Trump wanted to go to Washington to \"drain the swamp\", he has created his own there.\n\nParty over country (again): monumental Republican hypocrisy on full display\n\nTuesday October 5, 2021: As dubious as it is, there is an established congressional ritual of raising the debt ceiling as needed. The purpose is not to pay for new spending, but to cover past spending. Failing to raise the debt ceiling can be as disastrous to the national economy as to international finance. Among the detrimental effects is the government's inability to pay its bills and suspension of Social Security payments and paying our military members.\n\nNow that Democrats dominate the presidency and Congress, Republicans have decided to refuse to raise the debt ceiling this time. Why? Purely for political fodder in the 2022 elections, where they can blame the \"irresponsible\" Democrats for that horrible national debt, thus playing into Trump's Save America crap. As you could predict, the master of obstruction, Mitch McConnell, is leading Senate Republicans to withhold every vote on this issue. McConnell is shameless, doing everything possible to block every initiative that Democrats pursue to improve the country.\n\nHere's the hypocrisy: Democrats have cooperated with past Republican administrations to raise the debt ceiling. Democrats cooperated to raise the debt ceiling three times during the Trump presidency...when Republicans drove up the debt 7.8 trillion dollars. Now, raising the debt is not to pay for current spending proposals, but to pay for the excesses of the Trump period. (98% of the number was incurred by Trump and his Republican enablers, who happily raided the Treasury to further enrich the rich.) As usual with today's alleged \"Republicans\", it's all about party...the country be damned.\n\nThe Arizona fraudit that Trump was promoting to his followers backfires on him, declaring him a loser\n\nFriday September 24, 2021: Trump had been depending upon the Arizona fraudit as the major event to fabricate evidence to support his Big Lie about the 2020 election, to the extent that he was routinely putting out formal statements telling his supporters to look forward to the results of the Cyber Ninjas \"audit\" of the Maricopa county ballots as an upcoming watershed moment in the propagation of that self-serving lie.\n\nAfter many months and six million dollars of blatantly partisam ballot \"auditing\", the Ninjas delivered their preliminary report today. It not only verified that Biden had won Arizona, but that Biden got even more votes than even originally counted (at least as tabulated by this amateurish effort). Trump had to be beside himself...and in being defined a loser even by his most stalwart supporters, he would be enraged. Unsurprisingly, Trump attacked media reporting of the fraudic conclusions, saying: \"I have heard it is far different\" than what has been reported; and Trump took to even lying about the results of the fraudit, falsely claiming that it found \"significant and undeniable evidence of FRAUD!\" (A spokesperson for Cyber Ninjas told an NPR affiliate in Arizona: \"Was there massive fraud or anything? It doesn't look like it.\") Countering Trump's assertion was a statement from the corrupt Republican politician in Arizona who commissioned the fraudit: in a hearing Friday afternoon, Republican Senate President Karen Fann acknowledged that Cyber Ninjas' final vote totals were close to the official Maricopa County tally.\n\nIt should be noted well that, despite his protestations and allusions to the contrary, Donald Trump is indeed a loser: he was soundly rejected by the voters in both of the elections he entered, in 2016 and 2020.\n\nComplicit with Trump's campaign against democracy, Texas governor Greg Abbott happily casts doubt on the 2020 election\n\nThursday September 23, 2021: So, Trump sends a letter to Texas governor Greg Abbott calling for an audit in Texas. In the letter, Trump says: \"Let's get to the bottom of the 2020 Presidential Election Scam!\" And so it came to be that Texas' secretary of state announced that its office was reexamining the results in the counties of Dallas, Collin (which includes part of the city of Dallas), Harris (where Houston is located), and Tarrant (where Fort Worth is located). This is an election that was meticulously counted, certified, and is irrecovable; and yet this sham is initiated...on the heels of the fraudit in Arizona. Moreover, this is a state that Trump won in 2020.\n\nWhy on earth would Trump dictate an audit of the Texas election? Because it is his nature to disrupt, and to cast doubt on everything, because it then allows him to exploit fear. Trump is currently engaging in his latest con-job, under the ingenuine banner of Save America. As anyone with half a brain would understand, this has nothing to do with America — it is all about Trump, to further his self-enrichment, with the side goal of seeking the protection of the presidency once again, to shield himself against the mounting, costly lawsuits against him, current and likely. This is Trump, exploiting fear, out of fear.\n\nDonald Trump is flailing, and lashing out indiscriminately\n\nWednesday September 22, 2021: A demented Donald Trump has continued to push his Big Lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him...such that he, not Joe Biden, is the legitimate president. Excerpts from the Woodward & Costa book \"Peril\" have revealed how Trump had indeed been pursuing a coup to subvert democracy and stay in office, election results be damned. With vindictiveness being at the core of Donald Trump's being, it was hardly suprising that, today, Trump put out a statement lashing out at even his most ardent senatorial supporters, Mike Lee and Lindsey Graham, blasting them for not fighting harder to find election fraud, saying in a statement:\n\n\"Lindsey and Mike should be ashamed of themselves for not putting up the fight necessary to win\".\n\nFurther: \"Mike Lee, Lindsey Graham, and all of the other Republicans who were unwilling to fight for the Presidency of the United States, which would have included at least an additional four Republican Senators, two in Georgia, one in Michigan, one in Arizona, are letting the Democrats get away with the greatest Election Hoax in history — a total con job!\"\n\nOf course, this has nothing to do with the presidency itself: it is all about Trump's boundless ego, and his insistence upon the abject loyalty of everyone around him to support that ego.\n\nTrump's attack is just further evidence that Trump will turn on anyone unwilling to sacrifice their own personal integrity or future to support the corruptions of Donald Trump. The Republican Party had been repeatedly warned that Trump would drag the party down into the mud if they put their faith and support into Donald Trump, and yet they did it anyway. Here, Trump is cementing a public perception that he is a raving old fool who is obsessed with living in a past of vindictiveness. A Republican Party that subscribes to this pathology and failing to address concerns of the present is not going to win general elections...without cheating; and they are going further down the Trump rabbit hole to adhere to that pathology, but adopting a party-wide strategy of declaring elections being rigged against them — even pre-emptively.\n\nA rally for those poor, poor January 6th rioters\n\nSaturday September 18, 2021: Matt Braynard, a former Trump campaign staffer, is the organizer of today's \"Justice fof J6\" rally. His objective: \"push back on the phony narrative that there was an insurrection”, as Braynard told former White House strategist Steve Bannon, adding: \"We're going back to the Capitol, right where it started. And it's going to be huge.\" In interviews, Braynard perpetrated inflammatory lies, making it seem that all the Capitol invaders were just \"demonstrators\", were all emprisoned, and also being deprived of needed medical care in prison. This is purposeful misrepresentation of reality — the signature of Trump and his Republican enablers — fabricated to keep the Trump core of crazies inflamed and engageable as violence-inclined soldiers awaiting orders.\n\nThe rally turned out to be a poorly attended, inconsequential event, with approximately 450 people takng part.\n\nOh, those poor, poor January 6th rioters\n\nThursday September 16, 2021: Trump and the rest of the Republican leadership who have encouraged self-serving attacks on Democracy have continued to encourage insurrection, either actively or passively. Trump in particular sees the criminals of January 6th as his allies, as he values anyone who exhibits loyalty to his corrupt objectives. This statement from Trump today:\n\n\"Our hearts and minds are with the people being persecuted so unfairly relating to the January 6th protest concerning the Rigged Presidential Election. In addition to everything else, it has proven conclusively that we are a two-tiered system of justice. In the end, however, JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL!\"\n\nThis is the ever-lying Trump attempting, as usual, to rewrite history to serve his self-centered goals. The whole world saw the videos of Trump's rioters invading the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, assaulting police and trying to hunt down any congress-people they could find — and in particular seeking to hang Mike Pence. These were violent insurrectionists, the core being white supremacists. They are not \"political prisoners\" as so many radical Republican leaders attempt to portray these criminals.\n\nMike Lindell's Trump reinstatement day is today\n\nFriday, August 13, 2021: Delusional MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell defined today as the day that the Biden Administration will resign and that Trump will be reinsteated as rightful president. This kind of relentless lying is precisely what foments violent behavior by the weak-minded portion of the population that the Trump cult depends upon.\n\nMike Lindell's Cyber Symposium spends 72 hours presenting nothing\n\nThursday, August 12, 2021: For weeks, raving Trump lunatic Mike Lindell (MyPillow CEO) was telling everyone that he would (finally) be presenting definitive evidence that China hacked the 2020 election, stealing it from Donald Trump. He would present the evidence in a dramatic Cyber Symposium, where the evidence would come from the \"37 terabytes\" of \"irrefutable\" evidence that hackers backed by China broke into election systems and switched votes for Biden. Held in Sioux Falls, South Dakota from August 10–12, the event garnered a small audience, hoping to actually hear something of substance after Lindell going on and on for months claiming that he had proof of election meddling...in an effort to support the Big Lie that Trump himself was peddling. As a sign of his imbalance, Lindell vowed to stay awake for the 72 hours to assure that his crusade sealed the deal. As the event started on the 10th, there was an hour delay due to inability to stream the event — which Lindell claimed (without evidence, of course) that it was due to being hacked. (This, despite Lindell supposedly having cyber experts on site.)\n\nOne of Lindell's zealots who took the stage actually said this:\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not a computer guy... I don't know what most of this stuff means. But I've been researching this election since November 3rd. But the CNNs of the world: You guys need to start reporting this and stop fact-checking it!\"\n\nSo there's your admission right there that facts don't matter.\n\nLindell hand-picked a cyber security expert, Josh Merritt, to review the \"evidence\". Unfortunately for Lindell, this expert wanted to preserve his reputation rather than lie for Lindell, and on Wednesday declared that the key data underpinning the China hack theory \"is illegitimate\". Lindell claims that the data consists of network data captures collected by hackers, which could be unencrypted to reveal that a cyberattach had occurred. As you would expect with encrypted packets, Merritt informed that data in such packets is unrecoverable, and thus this data cannot prove a China attack. Merritt: \"So our team said, we're not going to say that this is legitimate if we don't have confidence in the information.\" Merritt added: \"We were handed a turd.\" All this begs the question as to where the terabytes of data actually came from. Merritt revealed that the data came from Dennis Montgomery. Montgomery is a con-man who set himself up as a government contractor and swindled large sums of tax payer money. Among other cons, Montgomery duped the CIA into believing that he had the ability to decode secret al-Qaida messages embedded in Al Jazerra broadcasts.\n\nThe event was a vacuous fiasco, with no evidence presented. It was full of people talking, displays of meaningless data on the big screen, and MyPillow product promotions. Attendees were not happy to have their time and money wasted like this. CNN brought a real cyber expert (Harri Hursti) to the event and had him evaluate what was being presented. His conclusion: what was presented was meaningless; there was nothing there. Asked why he didn't simply present his evidence to cyber security experts in the first place, Lindell said because they would doctor the data and then report that there was no evidence as claimed. Now Lindell is saying that his proof will be in a case to the Supreme Court.\n\nLike Rudy Giuliani, Lindell has through repeated performances demonstrated himself to be a buffoon...yet another absurd side show character in the Donald Trump tent of the deranged. As with Giuliani, no one wants to be around Lindell, either, now. Note also that, like Giuliani, Lindell is the subject of a multi-billion-dollar defamation suit filed by Dominion Voting Systems, which Lindell, Giuliani, and former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell continually claimed had their voting machines switch Trump votes to Biden — without evidence, as usual. (Federal judge Carl Nichols of the DC District Court yesterday ruled against these three yahoos, who were attempting to defend their false statements as \"free speech\", and claiming that the Dominion suit was \"another act of intimidation by the hate-filled left-wing\" intended to silence them. Those cases are now clear to go forward — which will be a particular legal defense challenge for Giuliani, who is out of money.)\n\nRight wing media: dedicated to keeping 30% of our country ignorant and stupid\n\nFriday, August 6, 2021: It's well known that right wing media is a perpetual fount of misinformation, hiring professional liars to spew verbal garbage. I happened to land on the One America News channel this evening, and was stunned at the lies that their Pearson Sharp is feeding to the ears of America's fools. Railing against the COVID vaccine, Sharp followed Trump's lead in referring to COVID as \"the Chinese virus\" (just to make sure that attacks on Asian Americans continue). Sharp proffered that those who get the vaccine, get sick; and that the CDC is pushing the vaccine to \"make sure that 100% of vaccinated people can get sick\". Then he claimed that Dr. Anthony Faucci said that \"vaccinated people are as likely to catch the delta variant as normal people\". He spewed on: \"And don't pay attention to the doctors who have successfully treated and cured tens of thousands of China virus patients using nothing more than hydroxychloroquine — a simple, safe, and effective medicine that has been widely available for the past 65 years...and also costs a fraction of the price that Phizer and Moderna are charging the government for their own vaccine\". So, avoid this \"useless vaccine\"...which is \"experimental\" and \"unproven\".\n\nIn addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have this additional epidemic of delusion and stupidity. Republicans are forever sanctimoniously promoting themselves as the right-to-life party and here they are promoting death of people in their own party! How obliviously self-defeating can you get? Well, one thing is for sure: there are going to be fewer and fewer Trump voters over time.\n\nPressed to directly answer about January 6th, Jordan is as jittery as yesterday, again attempting evasion\n\nWednesday, July 28, 2021: Rabid Trump apologist Jim Jordan was interviewed via Zoom by Spectrum News. Their reporter Taylor Popielarz pressed Joran on what he said in yesterday's Fox interview, with host Bret Baier, where he alluded to speaking with Trump. Again, Jordan was jittery and evasive.\n\nPopielarz: \"First off, yes or no — did you speak with President Trump on Jan. 6?\"\n\nJordan: \"Yeah I mean — I spoke with the president last week, I speak with the president all of the time. I spoke with him on Jan. 6. I mean, I talked with President Trump all the time and that's ... I don't think that's unusual. I would expect members of Congress to talk with the president of the United States when they're trying to get done the things they told the voters in their district to do.\"\n\nPopielarz: \"On Jan. 6, did you speak with him before, during, or after the Capitol was attacked?\"\n\nJordan: \"I spoke with him that day, after? I think after. I don't know if I spoke with him in the morning or not. I just don't know ... I don't know when those conversations happened.\"\n\nJim Jordan nervously tries to dodge an answer to whether he spoke with Trump during the Capitol insurrection\n\nTuesday, July 27, 2021: Jim Jordan appeared on today's Fox Special Report, where host Bret Baier asked Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) if he spoke with then-President Donald Trump on the day of the Capitol riot on January 6. The normally forceful Jordan was uncharacteristically nervous and scattershot, responding in this interchange:\n\nJORDAN: \"I've talked to the former president umpteen times, thousands. I mean, not thousands—\"\n\nBAIER: \"I mean on January 6th.\"\n\nJORDAN: \"I talked to the president. I never talk about what we talk about. I just don't think that's appropriate, just like I don't talk about what happens in Republican conferences. So I talked to the president numerous times. I continue to talk to the president.\"\n\nBAIER: \"No, no. I mean on January 6th, congressman?\"\n\nJORDAN: \"Yes. I mean I've talked the president so many — I can't remember all the days I have talked to him, but I have certainly talked to the president.\"\n\nBAIER: \"And on that day, can you share any of the insight of what he was thinking about that day?\"\n\nJORDAN: \"Bret, the people we need to come testify are the people who can testify to the fundamental questions. Why didn't the United States Capitol — the people's house — have an appropriate security posture on that day and what have we done? Those are the people we need to hear from. That's the information and testimony we need to get. That's what we should focus on.\"\n\nClearly, this is Jordan being as evasive as possible, feeling the heat that is descending upon all those who did everything they could as co-conspirators in Trump's Big Lie about a \"stolen\" election. And clearly: anyone in Congress will vividly remember where they were and what they did on that infamous day; so Jordan's fake amnesia act doesn't work. Jordan is seen here trying to uphold the party line of \"let's ignore the riot and try to blame anyone else for what happened that day\".\n\nDOJ tells Mo Brooks to go take a hike\n\nTuesday, July 27, 2021: The Department of Justice this evening issued a formal rejection to the request from Alabama Republican Rep. Mo Brooks for legal protection in court against a lawsuit linking him to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. This is Brooks arrogantly having poured verbal gasoline on the January 6th mob and now pleading for protection from accountability, vacuously claiming that his inflammatory speech that day were within the scope of his duties as a House member. (That was the vitriolic speech in which Brooks told the mob: \"start taking down names and kicking ass.\") The statement from the DOJ was wonderful in slamming Brooks down. In their brief, DOJ wrote:\n\n\"The Department has declined to issue a certification because it cannot conclude that Brooks was acting within the scope of his office or employment as a Member of Congress at the time of the incident out of which the claims in this case arose,\"\n\n\"The record indicates that Brooks's appearance at the January 6 rally was campaign activity, and it is no part of the business of the United States to pick sides among candidates in federal elections. Members of Congress are subject to a host of restrictions that carefully distinguish between their official functions, on the one hand, and campaign functions, on the other.\"\n\n\"Brooks cannot show that his actions in inciting a deadly riot were somehow within the scope of his federal employment.\"\n\nBrooks certainly knew that he was dealing with a dangerous mob on January 6th: he has admitted that he was wearing body armor as he stood on that podium that day. Remember how outsized that windbreaker looked on him that day? Voila. In an interview with Slate, Brooks said:\n\n\"I was warned on Monday that there might be risks associated with the next few days. And as a consequence of those warnings, I did not go to my condo. Instead, I slept on the floor of my office. And when I gave my speech at the Ellipse, I was wearing body armor.'\"\n\nMeasuring Trump's influence: the candidate he backed in Texas loses\n\nTuesday, July 27, 2021: Rep. Ron Wright (R-Texas) died in February after contracting the coronavirus. His wife, Susan Wright, entered the special election for his seat and got as far as a run-off, against State Rep. Jake Ellzey. Trump endorsed Susan Wright in the final days before the May 1 election, then as the runoff approached, he got more involved. Trump issued three statements reiterating his endorsement, starred in a robocall for her, and headlined a telephone rally for her Monday night. She lost. Ellzey got a reported 53% of the vote, Susan Wright 47%,\n\nGosh, how could a Trump-backed candidate ever lose?? What this election rigged?? Stolen?? Thousands of dead voters?? Ballots in suitcases?? Call the Cyber Ninjas!! Look for bamboo fibers in ballots!! Round up all the routers!!\n\nEgocentric con-man Trump, ever portraying himself as infallible, attempted to portray this as anything but a weakness on his part: \"... this is not a loss, again, I don't want to claim it is a loss, this was a win.\"\n\nThe lunatic Trump is out fomenting more violence with his Big Lie\n\nSaturday, July 24, 2021: The dementedly dangerous Donald Trump is in Phoenix, Arizona today, speaking at the TPUSA event, going through his standard litany of grievances, with emphasis on the election that he claims to have won, but was stolen from him. Claiming election fraud, as usual, he said that \"The evidence is monumental.\" Just like his violence fomenting at his January 6th crowd, today Trump incited his weak-minded followers saying: \"We have to fight.\" He went on an on about the election, with lie after contrived lie about \"fraud\" (like his favorite \"ballots in suitcases\")...that he had no evidence of in all the election lawsuits. Not to be overlooked, he emphasized that China is responsible for the pandemic...and should be pressed for retribution. Trump also decried the crime in New York City. (This is the city he abandoned to go live in Florida. And he doesn't mention how much of that crime is violence against Asian American...that he has persistently encouraged.)\n\nTrump attacked Democrats in general with this gem: \"There's no way they win elections without cheating.\" So many of Trump's attack statements are actually confessional. It's very well documented that, as an increasingly desperate, shrinking party, it is Republicans who notoriously do everything possible to cheat in order to win elections.\n\nThis is Trump deliberately fomenting unrest and division in our country, just as in the past. This is where the epidemic of violent attacks against Asian Americans comes from. This is Trump programming his simpletons to send him millions of dollars to purportedly make America great again, or secure election integrity, when of course he will pocket all the money, with not a dollar going to the crusading he purports. (Scamming people is easier than competently running a business.)\n\nOh, and it goes without saying that this Trump rally was a coming together of the stupid and ignorant, in a county which is just 36% vaccinated. With 100% predictability, not one attendee wore a mask, as all of them crowded together, yelling and cheering and spreading the very contagious delta variant throughout the auditorium. Make America Sick Again!\n\nWe hear Trump lying about the January 6th insurrection\n\nThursay, July 22, 2021: In researching for their book \"I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump's Catastrophic Final Year\", Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post journalists Carol Leonnig and Philip interviewed Donald Trump, for two hours, making an audio recording. They have been releasing excerpts over recent days, and today released what Trump said about the January 6th fatal insurrection. To wit:\n\n\"I think it was the largest crowd I've ever spoken before. It went from that point — which is almost at the White House — to beyond the Washington monument. It was — and wide. And it was a loving crowd, too, by the way. There was a lot of love. I've heard that from everybody. Many, many people have told me that was a loving crowd.\"\n\nTrump actually blamed the Capitol Police for the behavior of his mob: \"They were ushered in by the police. The Capitol Police were ushering people in, the Capitol Police were very friendly;\" and that the Capitol Police were \"hugging and kissing\" them and were \"very friendly\". Trump also claimed of the Capitol Police: \"They were hugging and kissing, you don't see that. But, there's plenty of tape on that too.\" The interviewers asked Trump what he sought to accomplish by sending the mob to the Capitol. Rather than answer, he distracted. So they pressed Trump on this. He would only answer: \"What I wanted is what they wanted.\" Here's the obvious thing: What they wanted is what Trump incited them to want, by lying since the November election. So, what Trump wanted what he as the coward agitator always wants: others to do battle for him.\n\nThis is classic Trump, shirking responsibility for anything negative, no matter how culpable he is. (\"That wasn't my rally, per se.\") Con-man Trump is completely shameless, unhesitatingly perpetraying a portrayal of January 6th that is completely contrary to thoroughly documented reality.\n\nPredictably, Trump could not help but perpetuate The Big Lie during the interview: \"What I wanted was what they wanted. They showed up just to show support because I happen to believe the election was rigged at a level like nothing has ever been rigged before. There's tremendous proof. There's tremendous proof. Statistically, it wasn't even possible that (Biden) won. Things such as, if you win Florida and Ohio and Iowa, there's never been a loss.\"\n\nThis, of course, is just Trump's perpetual ego-serving delusion. If Trump had \"tremendous proof\", the place to pursue it would have been in the dozens of lawsuits that his unscrupulous lawyers filed in numerous states...none of which presented any substantive evidence of fraud.\n\nFederal prosecutors are draining Trump's swamp of corruption\n\nTuesay, July 20, 2021: Donald Trump notoriously surrounded himself with corrupt individuals, who would unquestioningly do as he wanted, at the same time lining their pockets. One of those people was Tom Barrack, the real-estate investor and a longtime ally of former President Trump, who directed Trump's inaugural committee (infamous for padding expenses). Barrack was arrested Today in Los Angeles on charges that he acted as a foreign agent of the United Arab Emirates and lied to federal investigators. A seven-count indictment filed by the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, N.Y., alleges that Mr. Barrack, along with a former employee and an Emirati businessman, acted at the direction of senior Emirati officials to influence Trump's policy positions and to influence public opinion in favor of U.A.E. interests. The 74 year old Barrack was also charged with obstruction of justice and making false statements during a June 2019 interview with federal law-enforcement agents.\n\nTrump adds to the right wing whitewashing of the January 6th insurrection\n\nSunday, July 11, 2021: The right wing enemies of democracy have been conducting a shameless campaign to minimize the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol, as incited by our traitorous former president, Donald Trump. Speaking on \"Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo\" on the Fox News Channel, Trump continued his whitewashing the deadly attack that he incited. Said Trump: \"The crowd was unbelievable and I mentioned the word 'love,' the love in the air, I've never seen anything like it. That's why they went to Washington. Too much spirit and faith and love, there was such love at that rally, you had over a million people.\" (Once again with the ego-inflation of crowd size.) Trump, the habitual liar and con-man, once again spews self-serving verbal tripe to attempt to portray the Capitol attack as though it was a Woodstock event in Washington...despite the horrific videos we all saw chronicling the violence perpetrated by Trump's crazies.\n\nAnother CPAC, another cavalcade of lies\n\nSunday, July 11, 2021: Starting Friday and running through Sunday, the Conservative Political Action Conference conducted its annual meeting in Dallas, Texas. As usual, it was an extravaganza of propaganda, dogma, cultism, and of course, lies. Blowhard Donald Trump spoke to the assemblage of doting cultists on Sunday, and fully exposed his reflexive reaction to polls involving him: \"Now, if it's bad, I just say it's fake. If it's good, I say that's the most accurate poll, perhaps ever.\" Trump decried violent crime...as if it were something that began on January 20, 2021; but it was just the same on Jan 20, 2017, when Trump in his inauguration speech pontificated: \"This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\" In four years, what did Trump do about it? Nothing. Trump's time went to watching TV, criticizing football players and railing against his enemies. It goes without saying that Trump brought his standard grievances to the gathering, with \"the stolen election\" being chief among them. Fox News covered Trump's sppearance. As he spewed his lies about the election, Fox News put this disclaimer, in all caps, at the base of the video feed: \"THE VOTING SYSTEM COMPANIES HAVE DENIED THE VARIOUS ALLEGATIONS MADE BY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS COUNSEL REGARDING THE 2020 ELECTION.\" (Being sued allows rays of reality to creep into the darkness of delusions.)\n\nTrump exposes his lying regimen\n\nSaturday, July 3, 2021: Speaking to a rally of his deplorables in Sarasota, Florida today, Trump boldly exposed his strategy of lying:\n\n\"If you say it enough and keep saying it, they'll start to believe you.\"\n\nThere you have it...right out there. And despite Trump openly revealing his lying behavior, these fools believe whatever he tells them.\n\nThe Trump organization and its CFO are criminally charged\n\nThursday, July 1, 2021: The first indictments have been issued in the Manhattan District Attorney's criminal investigation of Trump Organization. The Trump Organization and its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, were charged in what prosecutors said was a \"sweeping and audacious\" 15-year scheme to compensate top executives \"off the books\" and help them avoid paying taxes. Prosecutors explained: \"Contrary to today's assertion by the company's former CEO, this is not a 'standard practice in the business community' nor was it the act of a rogue or isolated employee, Instead, it was orchestrated by the most senior executives, who were financially benefiting themselves and the company by getting secret pay raises at the expense of state and federal taxpayers.\" The behavior of the Trump Organization is consistent with Donald Trump's evidenced attitude that only fools pay taxes. A fool is someone who taunts the prosecutors pursuing him: on Monday June 28, Trump called the prosecutor \"rude, nasty and totally biased\".\n\nThe Trump Organization, despite its name, is an organization only in Trump's mind. As people who have probed it found, \"it's a hodgepodge of his own passions and interests, untethered from sophisticated strategic thinking,\" as Trump biographer Tim O'Brien puts it. Donald Trump is essentially a child, and this \"organization\" is like a child playing make-believe; and in your make-believe construct, you don't pay taxes.\n\nPredictably, Eric Trump, who has supposedly been running the Trump organization while his father was grifting in Washington, was indignantly railing against the charges made against his company. Ever oblivious to irony, Eric bitched about law enforcement pursuing what he characterized as the trivial charges filed against the company instead of attending to what's happening in New York city, where he says \"crime is rampant\". Yes: and the Trump organization is in New York city and crimes are being committed in your organization, and the authorities are pursuing that.\n\nThe Trump organization notified of potential criminal charges\n\nFriday, June 25, 2021: The Manhattan District Attorney's Office has officially informed lawyers for the Trump Organization that it could face criminal charges in connection with benefits it has provided to company employees. This is the result of one of two major legal investigations of expected violations of law by Trump's empire, obviously in concert with Donald Trump's contempt for the law as an impediment to his greed.\n\nTrump's corrupt lawyer officially declared a liar by the New York State appellate court\n\nThursday, June 24, 2021: In a decision rendered today, the New York State appellate court suspended Rudy Giuliani's license to practice law. In the opening statement, the court wrote: \"we conclude that there is uncontroverted evidence that respondent communicated demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers and the public at large in his capacity as lawyer for former President Donald J. Trump and the Trump campaign in connection with Trump's failed effort at reelection in 2020. These false statements were made to improperly bolster respondent's narrative that due to widespread voter fraud, victory in the 2020 United States presidential election was stolen from his client. We conclude that respondent's conduct immediately threatens the public interest and warrants interim suspension from the practice of law, pending further proceedings before the Attorney Grievance Committee (sometimes AGC or Committee).\"\n\nLater in their statement: \"The seriousness of respondent's uncontroverted misconduct cannot be overstated. This country is being torn apart by continued attacks on the legitimacy of the 2020 election and of our current president, Joseph R. Biden. The hallmark of our democracy is predicated on free and fair elections. False statements intended to foment a loss of confidence in our elections and resulting loss of confidence in government generally damage the proper functioning of a free society. When those false statements are made by an attorney, it also erodes the public's confidence in the integrity of attorneys admitted to our bar and damages the professi on's role as a crucial source of reliable information. It tarnishes the reputation of the entire legal profession and its mandate to act as a trusted and essential part of the machinery of justice.\"\n\nAs we all witnessed, Giuliani was an enthusiastic liar for his boss, the monumentally corrupt Donald Trump. At the same time, Trump was contemptuous of Giuliani, says Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender in his new book. Trump frequently mocked Rudy Giuliani, called him \"pathetic,\" and said he \"sucked\". And yet Giuliani persisted, as a professional sycophant, denying and forsaking the laws he should have been upholding. Now Giuliani is paying the price for blind loyalty to a man who cares only about himself.\n\nTexas Republican legislators define themselves as lying, racist enemies of democracy\n\nSunday, May 30, 2021: Texas Democrats walked out of the Texas state house to prevent voting on Senate Bill 7...probably the most notorious of the anti-democracy pieces of legislation being put forth in state governments across the country to suppress voting...for the other party. This, in Texas — the state that already has the most repressive voting restrictions in the country. (No surprise — it's Texas, after all.) Texas Republicans are in lock-step with the general mission of the Republican Party now, to sabotage election laws and rules to assure that none of their candidates can possibly lose elections by having it \"stolen\" — the big lie that loser Donald Trump continues to propagage in his Big Lie. The Texas Republicans claim they are taking this legislative action to \"assure election integrity\". This is an outright lie: claiming they are working to solve a problem...that doesn't exist. To the chagrin of these Republican liars, the Texas Secretary of State and her deputy — both Republicans themselves — have both testified that the last election was both successful and secure.\n\nWhat's in this Texas SB 7 bill: Known as the Election Integrity Protection Act, it would, among other things:\n\nban 24-hour voting and drive-thru voting\n\nmake it a crime to aggregate ballots for a candidate, also known as vote harvesting\n\ncreate at least 10 categories of new or enhanced criminal penalties related to elections\n\nprotect partisan poll watchers by criminalizing elections officials who reject a designated watcher\n\ndefine a higher threshold for who can qualify to vote by mail based on a disability\n\nban after-hours voting\n\nmandate that all weekday early voting take place sometime between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.\n\nmake it illegal for elections officials to send applications to vote by mail to people who did not request one\n\nmake it easier to overturn an election, allowing courts to throw out results if enough ballots were cast illegally that it could have made a difference...without needing evidence that fraud actually altered the outcome of a race\n\nblock Sunday voting before 1 p.m.\n\nBlatant racism is evident in prohibiting Sunday morning voting: this is directly targeted at people of color, who have had a tradition of voting after Sunday morning church services. Their voting contributed to the state having seen the highest turnout in decades in 2020. That can't be allowed to happen in the state of Texas, say the Republicans there. That principal enemy of democracy, Texas governor Greg Abbott, was outraged at the vote on SB 7 being thwarted: he has threatened to withhold legislator's salaries if they don't vote on (and, obviously, pass) this onerous bill. Moreover, Abbott vowed to schedule a special session of the legislature to do it. So, this is some kind of emergency? Note well that Abbott didn't think that any past calamties, such as last winter's weather crisis in Texas, were serious enough to call a special session. Here you are seeing monumental hypocrisy, exposing the partisan motives underlying what Republians across the country are doing.\n\nAlleged House Republican Minority \"Leader\" Kevin McCarthy doesn't want the January 6th truths to be explored\n\nTuesday, May 18, 2021: Feckless Kevin McCarthy is again demonstrating his unfitness for any position in our nation's government. House members have been laboring to form a bi-partisan commission to fully explore and document what went on in the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump crazies. McCarthy had submitted a letter of requirements for such a commission to the organizers, apparently hoping those would not be met; but they were. With that excuse gone, McCarthy today contrived the fake excuse that the January 6th event should not be examined unless random events by the Left are also examined. It's completely transparent what McCarthy is up to: he is desperate to do anything and everything he can to avoid having to give sworn testimony regarding his actions and what he saw on January 6th. Why? McCarthy is, like so many Republicans in Washington, obsessed with power. McCarthy wants absolutely nothing to interfere with becoming Speaker of the House — as if he he has the qualifications or integrity for the position. McCarthy in no way resembles a leader of any type: he is a weak supplicant who has no respect for his oath of office or the Constitution or the institution of democracy.\n\nThe deposed professional liar continues to spew crap to undermine democracy\n\nSaturday, May 15, 2021: As Trump spends the rest of his life stewing about losing the election, and looking for ways to lash out at anyone and anything that could have contributed to that (except for his own undesirability), Trump spewed this latest garbage:\n\n\"The entire Database of Maricopa County in Arizona has been DELETED! This is illegal and the Arizona State Senate, who is leading the Forensic Audit, is up in arms. Additionally, seals were broken on the boxes that hold the votes, ballots are missing, and worse. Mark Brnovich, the Attorney General of Arizona, will now be forced to look into this unbelievable Election crime. Many Radical Left Democrats and weak Republicans are very worried about the fact that this has been exposed. The DELETION of an entire Database and critical Election files of Maricopa County is unprecedented. Many other States to follow. The Mainstream Media and Radical Left Democrats want to stay as far away as possible from the Presidential Election Fraud, which should be one of the biggest stories of our time. Fox News is afraid to cover it — there is rarely a mention. Likewise, Newsmax has been virtually silent on this subject because they are intimidated by threats of lawsuits. One America News (OAN), one of the fastest growing networks on television, and the 'hottest', is doing a magnificent job of exposing the massive fraud that took place. The story is only getting bigger and at some point it will be impossible for the weak and/or corrupt media not to cover. Thank you to OAN and other brave American Patriots. It is all happening quickly!\"\n\nSo, here is another contrived lie as Trump tries to manufacture false \"evidence\" of conspiratorial actions taken against him. As always, not a shred of anything to back up his claims — just the usual incendiary statements intended to blow up the foundations of democracy.\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer was sitting in his office when this Trump grenade landed in his domain. As Richer said, on his terminal at that very moment was the database that Trump flamingly claimed was deleted. Richer was understandably outraged, all the more so as state officials, taking this Trumpcrap at face value, started accusing his office of unlawfully deleting evidence. Writing on Twitter, Richer pushed back on this insanity:\n\n\"Wow. This is unhinged. I'm literally looking at our voter registration database on my other screen. Right now. We can't indulge these insane lies any longer. As a party. As a state. As a country.\"\n\nMaricopa County's top officials (most, Republicans), on Monday blasted the GOP state Senate president and the auditors she hired to run an unprecedented, partisan recount in the county. Board of Supervisors Chairman Jack Sellers, a Republican, said Karen Fann is making an \"attempt at legitimatizing a grift disguised as an audit.\"\n\nThe \"Big Lie\" is not exclusive to Trump: Republicans are infamous for big-lying\n\nFriday, May 7, 2021: The Republican party is notorious for foisting big lies on our nation. In the 1930s, Republican president Herbert Hoover devised the lie of trickle-down economics as an excuse to enrich the rich, where lavishing tax breaks on corporations and the wealthy would (somehow) \"trickle down\" to the lesser inhabitants of the country. (It would, as usual, take a succeeding Democratic president to fix the country thereafter.) In the 1980s, Republican president Ronald Reagan repeated the same, big lie with his \"Reaganomics\", with the same false idea that giving tax cuts to the wealthy would create economic growth in society. Trump's 2017 Big Lie was in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), in his next Republican iteration of trickle-down economics, giving huge tax breaks to corporations and the rich on the pretense that they would, among other things, pay their employees more. That certainly didn't happen: instead, CEO pay continued to escalate into stratospheric levels, companies continued to oppose raising minimum wage levels, and corporations increased their cash piles and pursued stock buy-backs. In March of 1989, president George H.W. Bush established the Council on Competiveness to reduce the alleged burden of regulations on business, to be administered by his ethically challenged vice president Dan Quayle. This was nothing more than an arrogant short-circuiting of environmental protections and employee protections where any company could pay a visit to Mr. Quayle and have inconvenient regulations nullified in the name of profits. Then, of course, there was the younger George Bush, who with VP Dick Cheney fabricated the big lie of \"weapons of mass destruction\" in Iraq to justify a second invasion of that country. (Republicans impeached Bill Clinton for lying about an affair, while George Bush was not impeached for an enormous lie that resulted in about 100,000 people losing their lives, environmental devastation in Iraq, and over a trillion dollars of our nation's wealth being wasted in an elective war instead of manifest national needs.)\n\nBig lies are a tradition in the Republican party.\n\nThe cult of Trump seeks to shove truth-speaker Liz Cheney aside\n\nWednesday, May 5, 2021: The corrupt Republican party has been intent on punishing every Republican principal who either voted to impeach Donald Trump or criticized Trump as inciter of the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Liz Cheney, in the third leadership Republican position in the House of Representives, is the conspicuous target of the Trump cultists as Cheney refuses to subscribe to the doctrine of lies that constitute today's perverse Republican party. In a Washington Post op-ed today, Cheney wrote: \"In public statements again this week, former president Donald Trump has repeated his claims that the 2020 election was a fraud and was stolen. His message: I am still the rightful president, and President Biden is illegitimate. Trump repeats these words now with full knowledge that exactly this type of language provoked violence on Jan. 6. And, as the Justice Department and multiple federal judges have suggested, there is good reason to believe that Trump's language can provoke violence again. Trump is seeking to unravel critical elements of our constitutional structure that make democracy work — confidence in the result of elections and the rule of law. No other American president has ever done this.\"\n\nTrump cultist Kevin McCarthy was caught on an open mic yesterday, ahead of a \"Fox and Friends\" interview, grousing about Liz Cheney, and about getting rid of her: \"I think she's got real problems. I've had it with ... I've had it with her. You know, I've lost confidence. ... Well, someone just has to bring a motion, but I assume that will probably take place.\" Who to replace Cheney? New York representative Elise Stefanik is apparently poised to become the next House Republican conference chairwoman. Because she is such a great conservative? No. She has a 48% rating for conservative voting and stances, while Cheney has an 80% rating. A furher irony is that Stefanik had been a Trump critic, but has since succumbed to a lust for power, prostituting herself to become a Trump loyalist and dedicated subscriber to all the lies.\n\nDonald Trump is the Jim Jones of the Republican party.\n\nGiuliani's actions in Ukraine further exposed\n\nWednesday, May 5, 2021: MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell is in Ukraine, and interviewed Igor Novikov, former adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Novikov was asked to listen in to a call with Giuliani in July 2019, where Novikov expected it to be just the usual good relations call. He said he was shocked at what he heard in this 39-minute call. Giuliani began by introducing himself as President Donald Trump's personal lawyer but also implied that he was a policy adviser. Rudy Giuliani heavily pressed the Ukraine president's office to destroy Joe Biden as he began his presidential campaign in July 2019. Giuliani in the call: \"All we need from the president [Zelensky] is to say: 'I'm gonna put an honest prosecutor in charge, he's gonna investigate and dig up the evidence that presently exists, and is there any other evidence about involvement of the 2016 election [...] and then the Biden thing has to be run out.'\" Giuliani was also looking for the Ukranians to assert that it was Ukraine, and not Russia, that meddled in the 2016 election. (The full transcript of the call can be found online.)\n\nFacebook continues Trump's suspension\n\nWednesday, May 5, 2021: Facebook today rendered the decision of their oversight on the prevailing suspension of Trump's ability to participate in their platforms, based upon his seditious behavior. The decision was to continue the suspension, but in a rather gutless way, saying that the company was wrong to make the suspension indefinite and gave it six months to determine a \"proportionate response.\"\n\nTrump being Trump, he jumped to lash out, with this written statement:\n\n\"What Facebook, Twitter, and Google have done is a total disgrace and an embarrassment to our Country. Free Speech has been taken away from the President of the United States because the Radical Left Lunatics are afraid of the truth, but the truth will come out anyway, bigger and stronger than ever before. The People of our Country will not stand for it! These corrupt social media companies must pay a political price, and must never again be allowed to destroy and decimate our Electoral Process.\"\n\nLaughably, this is Trump himself demonstrating why his suspension should continue. So-called \"conservatives\" are forever decrying \"liberals\" suppressing the voices of \"conservatives\". The reality is that people who care about the truth and facts are in firm and justified opposition to concerted lying.\n\nTrump keeps his Big Lie alive\n\nWednesday, April 28, 2021: At Mar-a-Lago, Trump appeared at an event to endorse Rep. Billy Long, announcing that he's vacating Mar-a-Lago for the summer (to escape the heat): \"So I just want to thank everybody, this is sort of a closeout. Now we go through the summer... we'll be back in October, maybe a little bit sooner.\" (He's heading for his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.) But what post-election address by Trump would be complete without reinforcement of his Big Lie that he actually won the election... \"Watch Arizona. Some very interesting things are happening in Arizona,\" referring to the perverse GOP recounting of the Maricopa county ballots there. \"Let's see what they find. I wouldn't be surprised if they found thousands and thousands and thousands of votes; so we're going to watch that very closely and, after that, we'll Pennsylvania, we'll watch Georgia, and you're going to watch Michigan, and Wisconsin, and you're watching New Hampshire. They found a lot of votes up in New Hampshire. This was a rigged election, everybody knows it, and we're going to be watching it very closely.\"\n\nTrump would be pathetic, raving like the old fool he is, execept that he is so dangerous to democracy because there are so many fools like him who subscribe to blatant lies.\n\nAn FBI raid on Rudy Giuliani\n\nWednesday, April 28, 2021: The FBI today executed a search warrant on Rudy Giuliani's New York City apartment and office, seizing his electronic devices. Giuliani was, of course, disgraced Donald Trump's personal lawyer whom Trump sent to Ukraine to try to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and his son in advance of the 2020 election: in other words, to solicit a foreign government for material aid in undermining the election...which is a violation of campaign finance laws. In a related move, the FBI arrived at the Washington, DC home of Trump lawyer Victoria Toensing to take her smartphone into evidence. All this is part of a years-long investigation into apparent illegal activity surrounding the Ukraine escapades directed by Trump. Recall what precipitated his first impeachment. The FBI had wanted to pursue this earlier, but Trump's DOJ stooge William Barr kept that from happening, to protect Trump. This is the second investigation of a Trump lawyer: Michael Cohen was investigated, pled guilty, and went to prison, later cooperating with the federal government and the NY prosecutor to provide an abundance of evidence on how the Trump organization has been operating.\n\nGiuliani was deeply immersed in the Ukraine, puffed up as being on a mission for president Trump, meeting with government officials as though he was an official representative of the U.S. government. Giuliani bragged that he was instrumental in the abrupt ouster of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch — a dedicated foe of the corruption that had become the hallmark of Ukranian officials. Investigators now are pursuing exactly why Giuliani was so dedicated to the removal of Yovanovitch. Clearly, she was an obstacle to the sordid Trump mission to scour Ukrain for dirt on the Bidens, and get the Ukranian president to purport that his government was investigating the Bidens. She was also an extreme irritant to corrupt Ukranian officials, where the suspicion is that funds or favors were being exchanged for Giuliani getting Yovanovitch out of the way. Recall that Trump defined that Barr's State Department have a channel open to receive all the \"goods\" that Giuliani would be sending. You can believe that Putin's FSB was absolutely thrilled to have Giuliani so close by, where they could feed him engineered misinformation that would be conveyed directly into the bowels of the U.S. government. Giuliani was so full of himself that he openly bragged that he was assigned to do this by Trump. Just as predictably, Trump covered himself, falsely claiming that he had nothing to do with Giuliani's Ukraine exloits. Obviously, assigning a private citizen to effectively take the place of the State Department in interacting with a foreign government is highly problematic, if not illegal. This whole affair is just so underhanded and sleazy that it smacks of Trump's usual method of operation. As Giulini is pressed by prosecutors, Trump has reason to be worried.\n\nSo eager to malign Biden, Republicans run with any any misinformation or lie that they think serves them\n\nTuesday, April 27, 2021: The Republican habit continues, of fabricating and promoting lies about their political adversaries. With little of real substance to criticize president Biden about, they are resorting to flinging crap against the wall in hopes that it sticks. Rabid Republicans are doing everything they can to incite culture wars toward their own ends. What are they lying about now?\n\nThey have invented and are propagating the lie that the Biden administration intends to all but completely deny Americans access to beef as a means of reducing climate change. The reckless Larry Kudlow said over the weekend: \"No burger on July 4. No steaks on the barbecue.\" Predictably, right-wing \"news\" outlets are propagating this false information. Then there was the ever-dismaying Kevin McCarthy, buying into the lie, saying: \"He's going to control how much meat you can eat! Can you imagine that?\" The USDA had to refute this nonsense, saying: \"This is a fabrication. There is no such effort or policy that exists by this Administration. It's not a part of the climate plan nor the emissions targets. It is not real.\"\n\nNext there is the Fox News yahoo Tucker Carlson who, for apparently lack of anything substantive to fill his show, decided to attack mask-wearing, claiming it to represent child abuse: if you see a child wearing a mask outside, \"Call the police immediately.\" He went on: \"As for forcing children to wear masks outside, that should be illegal. Your response when you see children wearing masks as they play should be no different from your response to seeing someone beat a kid in Walmart. Call the police immediately, contact child protective services. Keep calling until someone arrives. What you're looking at is abuse, it's child abuse, and you are morally obligated to attempt to prevent it.\" A deluge like this is the last thing the police need to contend with. He should be sued for this crap.\n\nIn a further display of right-wing misrepresentation-to-smear, the New York Post on Saturday published a completely misleading story insinuating that taxpayer money was being used to buy thousands of copies of Kamala Harris' 2019 book \"Superheroes Are Everywhere\" for distribution at border migrant centers. The front page featured a large photo showing a copy of that book propped up on a table, supposedly at such a center. Facts? Substantiation? None. This was crap. These centers receive donations from the public, and this one copy of the book happened to be one of those donations. Laura Italiano, the Post reporter who wrote that story resigned, tweeting: \"The Kamala Harris story - an incorrect story I was ordered to write and which I failed to push back hard enough against - was my breaking point.\" She tweeted on 4/27: \"Today I handed in my resignation to my editors at the New York Post.\" After the Washington Post exposed the NY Post story to be a lie, the NY Post then put this admission-of-lie onto a page of their 4/27 issue: \"Editor's note: The original version of this article said migrant kids were getting Harris' book in a welcome kit, but has been updated to note that only one known copy of the book was given to a child.\"\n\nAgain, this is about right-wingers doing everything they can to divide the country by feeding lies to the millions of irresponsible, feeble-minded consumers of this crap who eagerly consume it without question. Fox News and and other purveyors of the truly \"fake news\" abandon all integrity to keep pushing lies like this, and without hesitation undermine democracy at every opportunity.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene's America First Caucus, promoting racial purity\n\nFriday, April 16, 2021: Every so often, evidence of the deep-seated racism of the modern Republican Party bubbles up to the surface, in full rank repulsiveness. That's what happened today, in a release from Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's office announcing a new \"America First Caucus\" being formed by Greene and other hard-right GOP lawmakers such as Rep. Paul A. Gosar of Arizona. Rabid Trump supporter Representative Matt Gaetz wasted no time in expressing his zeal to join the caucus.\n\nSo what did this lanuch document proclaim? First and foremost, to follow in President Trump's footsteps, and potentially step on some toes and sacrifice sacred cows for the good of the American nation. [As though Trump is still president.] Its first objective is to deal with — you guessed it — Election Fraud. In conformance with Trump's Big Lie as an unproven premise, the document says: \"Recent election results demonstrate a compromised integrity of our elections and made our election system a subject of global mockery. Across the country federal elections have been undermined by using voting machines that are readily compromised and illegally accessed whereby results appear manipulated, voters are disenfranchised, and faith in our system eroded. Mail-in voting, long recognized as subject to fraud, has become normalized. We will work towards an end to mail-in voting, implementation of national voter ID and substantive investigations into mass voter fraud perpetrated during the 2020 election.\" Next, the document rails against \"deep state actors\": you know, the career government professionals who, in carrying out their work, were impeding Trump's goal of becoming Dictator of The United States. Then Big Tech is targeted: these are the companies who moderated Trump's caustic, lying tweets as he attacked everyone who opposed him. Ah, Immigration...the big one, where the goal of racial purity is under threat: \"America is a nation with a border, and a culture, strengthened by a common respect for uniquely Anglo-Saxon political traditions.\" Cited is the enduring myth that these undesirables must be kept out and prevented from taking American jobs...when in fact disadvantaged immigrants have always labored in jobs that established Americans do not want to do.\n\nRemember Adolph Hitler's dream of, after a victorious war, creating a grand new city in Germany to serve as the seat of the Nazi party and be the capital of the conquered world? Greene and her authoritarian aspirees have much the same dream, once they take over the United States as a dictatorial force: \"The America First Caucus will work towards an infrastructure that reflects the architectural, engineering and aesthetic value that befits the progeny of European architecture, whereby public infrastructure must be utilitarian as well as stunningly, classically beautiful, befitting a world power and source of freedom.\" The document complains that \"our domestic infrastructure is failing, crumbling and decaying\". No mention, of course, that in four years as president, Donald Trump took no action on that crumbling infrastructure, despite promising to do so at the outset of his administration. (That would have involved personal effort.)\n\nNikki Haley — hypocritical enemy of American democracy\n\nMonday, April 12, 2021: Interviewed today, former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley was asked if she would support Donald Trump running again for president in 2024. She responded, \"Yes\".\n\nIn February, Haley conformed to the voices of outrage at Trump having incited the Capitol riot of January 6th. Speaking to Political, Haley said: \"We need to acknowledge he let us down. He went down a path he shouldn't have, and we shouldn't have followed him, and we shouldn't have listened to him. And we can't let that ever happen again.\" That, of course, would include depriving Trump of the powers of presidency that he so flagrantly abused over the past four years.\n\nHaley had been weighing a run for president herself, but today completely contradicted her February outrage, in her response when asked by The Associated Press if she would support a second bid by Trump: \"I would not run if President Trump ran, and I would talk to him about it. That's something that we'll have a conversation about at some point, if that decision is something that has to be made.\" This is not the stance of someone who treasures democracy. This is fealty by a Trump loyalist, who would readily allow, and presumably support, resumption of the Trump tyranny.\n\nRepublican unity? Not in Trump's world\n\nSaturday, April 10, 2021: There was a GOP donors meeting at Mar-a-lago today, partly to further enrich Donald Trump, and to submit themselves to the erratic behavior of Trump, who was to deliver the keynote speech. Well, predictably, Trump deemed his prepared speech as \"boring\" and went off script to vent his grievances. He called Mitch McConnell a \"stone cold loser\". There were reportedly gasps from the attendees as Trump added that McConnell was a \"dumb son of a bitch\". McConnell's wife, former transportation secretary Elaine Chao, has also been in Trump's extensive catalog of targets for retribution, which Chao earned when she resigned in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection; so Trump mocked her. Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, is also solidly in Trump's retribution catalog for failing to stop the counting of electoral votes on January 6th. Trump's mob failed to get their hands on Pence on that day, to hang him, so Trump renewed his targeting of Pence by criticizing Pence again. And what Trump rant is complete without claims that the election was stolen from him.\n\nThis was a further reminder of how toxic Trump (still) is. He's a chronically hate-filled, utterly self-centered, mentally ill old man who clings to the past and revels in exacting revenge on an ever-growing number of people he perceives as having slighted him. One of the attendees of this event said: \"It was horrible, it was long and negative. It was dour. He didn't talk about the positive things that his administration has done.\" Large swaths of the Republican Party have had their fill of Trump and just want him to go away.\n\nGaetz in trouble\n\nWednesday, March 31, 2021: Rabid Trump supporter, Republican House of Representatives member Matt Gaetz is being investigated for possible sex trafficking and prostitution, as reported by the New York Times last night. In an investigation begun in the William Barr DOJ era, the Justice Department is investigating allegations that two years ago, Gaetz had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl whose travel he allegedly paid for. Should that travel involve travel across state lines, federal charges become even more serious. In denying the charges, Gaetz claims that beyond the allegations being false, that they are part of an elaborate $25 million extortion scheme being perpetrated by people including a former DOJ official. Gaetz claims that the $25 million to be paid would make the investigation go away...and be used to pursue the release of an American being held in Iran. In an interview on Fox News Tuesday evening, Gaetz said of the purported 17-year-old: \"The person doesn't exist.\" Gaetz told Axios: \"I believe that there are people at the Department of Justice who are trying to criminalize my sexual conduct, you know, when I was a single guy.\" (Note that Gaetz is on the House Judiciary Committee...which oversees the very agency that is investigating him.)\n\nGaetz told Fox that the former DOJ employee in the extortion plot is David McGee, now a lawyer at Beggs & Lane. McGee was interviewed by The Daily Beast late Tuesday night, saying that any reports of extortion involving him or his firm were \"completely, totally false.\" McGee added: \"This is a blatant attempt to distract from the fact that Matt Gaetz is apparently about to be indicted for sex trafficking underage girls.\" Neither the FBI nor DOJ will comment on this matter.\n\nEveryone hearing this story judges it as bizarre. Indeed, the alleged extortion plot basis makes no sense as related by Gaetz. Even Tucker Carlson said that his interview with Gaetz was one of the weirdest he ever conducted, particularly after Gaetz claimed that Carlson and his wife were at a restaurant with Gaetz, joined by a woman who was being threatened by the FBI to come up with evidence against Gaetz: \"I can say that actually you and I went to dinner about two years ago, your wife was there, and I brought a friend of mine — you'll remember her — and she was actually threatened by the FBI, told that if she wouldn't cop to the fact that somehow I was involved in some pay-for-play scheme, that could face trouble.\" (Carlson was reportedly livid that Gaetz was trying to drag his family into this mess.) Note the apparent Gaetz gaffe here, in citing yet another potential jeopardy item for himself: a political pay-for-play scheme of two years ago, which by definition means doing political favors for individuals or companies who pay the politician for carrying out the favors — which is often at odds with their oath of office and/or direction of the district involved. Gaetz is clearly operating in panic mode, rushing to get on TV to deny and distract, in an effort which gives the appearance of consciousness of guilt. Legal experts observed that Gaetz should be having a good lawyer advising him, rather than running his mouth in the face of a federal investigation. Note an extreme irony: Gaetz was the only Republican to vote against an anti-sex trafficking bill in 2017. (Ponder that, in this context.) All this demonstrates that wisdom is still not a Gaetz quality.\n\nSo, how did this investigation originate? It started with a federal investigation of Florida official Joel Micah Greenberg. Greenberg was elected in 2016 as Tax Collector in Seminole County. It would quickly become evident that Greenberg was an utterly corrupt yahoo. Soon after taking that office, Greenberg mandated that office employees carry firearms on their hips. He then took to wearing his tax collector badge as though it signified him being a law enforcement officer, using that to intimidate a female motorist whom he stopped for speeding. He gave government contracts and salaries to close friends and business partners including up to six people who were part of his wedding party in 2016. He used public funds to buy body armour, firearms, ammunition, and a drone. Greenberg then spent $66,000 more of public funds to purchase computer servers in a county office room where he intended to generate cryptocurrency monies for himself in a company he founded called Government Blockchain Systems LLC...and he amateurishly installed the servers such that they overloaded a circuit breaker, causing a fire in that uninsured structure. He made a habit of identity theft, using county facilities to steal IDs. He used Florida database facilities to pursue under-age females with whom he was conducting \"sugar-daddy\" relationships. He conducted a smear campaign against his next political rival, using fake identities to accuse that person of illegal activities. Arrested at his home, federal authorities found numerous IDs of Florida citizens and evidence of sex-trafficking a child. Greenburg is now in very serious trouble, his trial scheduled for June. This is the person whom Matt Gaetz regarded as a close friend and political ally, whom Gaetz even took the the White House. This is the linkage that led to Gaetz being investigated. Gaetz is now in jeopardy of his corrupt friend cooperating with federal authorities in the Gaetz investigation.\n\nIf you think that Matt Gaetz is above the behavior alleged, then you are unfamiliar with his pattern of his behavior — and resulting reputation. Gaetz is reviled, even by Republicans. He is known in Congress for bragging of his sexual expoloits, going so far as to show the naked pictures and videos of the women he has \"conquered\" to his congressional colleagues — even on the floor of the House of Representatives. (Note, here, this example of Republican hypocrisy, portraying theirs as \"the party of family values\", and doing nothing about egregious behavior like this from fellow Republicans.) Gaetz's high school classmates are not surprised at his current situation. Erin Scot, former friend and debate team partner, wrote in her blog in 2010: \"While the rest of us grew up, Gaetz stayed the same. He may have gotten his law degree and put on a suit and tie, but behind all that he's still the same guy who takes out his cell phone to show friends naked pictures of the women he's recently bedded. He can come and knock on your doors, smile for your photo ops, and hold all the babies he wants, but the fact of the matter is that Gaetz is a smarmy womanizer with no intention of doing anything for the district that doesn't first and foremost advance his political career.\" Like his mentor, Donald Trump, Gaetz views himself as a privileged elitist, increasingly emboldened by what he has gotten away with thus far, and will attempt to portray himself as victim when he gets caught doing something nefarious. As David Jolly said this week, we'll find out if Gaetz is just a dirt-bag...or a criminal. (Gaetz's communications director, Luke Ball, had enough and quit Gaetz's team.)\n\nTrump crashes a wedding to air his grievances\n\nSaturday, March 27, 2021: As captured on video footage, on Saturday night, Trump inflicted himself upon a wedding reception being held at Mar-a-Lago to purport to anyone who would tolerate him that Joe Biden is a lousy president, and that election vote counting should end when a threshold is reached. He droned on as follows:\n\n\"Y'know, I just got, I turned off the news, I get all these flash reports, and they're telling me about the border, they're telling me about China, they're telling me about Iran — how're we doing with Iran, howdya like that? Boy, they were ready to make a deal, they woulda done anything, they woulda done anything, and this guy goes and drops the sanctions and then he says, 'We'd love to negotiate now,' [and Iran says], 'We're not dealing with the United States at all,' oh, well, they don't want to deal with us. And China, the same thing, they never treated us that way, right? You saw what happened a few days ago, was terrible, and uh, the border is not good, the border is the worst anybody's ever seen it, and what you see now, multiply it times 10, Jim [who?]— he's the only one I know who would handle the border tougher than me. We have to, and the tough is...in the most humanitarian way, because that's what it is. What's happening to the kids, they're living in squalor, they are living like nobody has ever seen anybody, there's never been anything like what's, and you're gonna have hundreds, and you have it now, they have the airplane photos, the shocks, and they call 'em shocks, and these things are showing thousands and thousands of people coming up from South America and it's gonna be, it's just uh, look, it's a disaster. It's a humanitarian disaster from their standpoint, and it's gonna destroy the country, and frankly, the country can't afford it because you're talking about massive, just incredibly massive amounts. Our school systems, our hospital systems, everything. So it's a rough thing, and I just say, 'Do you miss me yet?' We did get 75 million votes, nobody's ever gotten that. They said, 'Get 66 million votes, sir, and the election's over.' We got 75 million and they said...but you know, you saw what happened, 10:30 in the evening, all of a sudden I said, 'That's a strange thing, why are they closing up certain places, right?' Now, a lot of things happening right now, I just wanted to say, it's an honor to be here, it's an honor to have you at Mar-a-Lago, you are a great and beautiful couple.\"\n\nNow, we clearly know that Trump cares nothing about \"humanitarian\" issues, given his zeal for separating children from their parents at the border and throwing them into detention pens as a deterrent to the non-white people trying to get into the United States from southern countries. Standard Trump xenophobia is on display here.\n\nAsian-Americans suffering the xenophobic racism that Trump fostered\n\nFriday, March 19, 2021: In addition to the pandemic, there is an epidemic of relentless attacks on Asian-Americans. This, of course, is the result of Trump habitually targeting this population at every opportunity. Trump was counted having blamed the Chinese for the coronvirus over 400 times, using denigrating phraseology \"China virus\", \"China plague\", \"kung flu\", and other negative terms whenever he talked about the virus — of course that intended to be a distraction from his negligence and overall lack of leadership which allowed the virus to rapidly claim victimes in the United States. The large number of weak-minded people in the country who took their cues from Trump naturally regarded all this as explicit targeting that they should act upon. In conducting this latest racist campaign, Trump further cemented his reputation as the worst president in U.S. history.\n\nTrump continues to concoct big lies\n\nSunday, February 28, 2021: Following his appearance at CPAC, former President Trump told Fox News' \"The Next Revolution With Steve Hilton\" that he claimed that he was concerned about the crowd size near the Capitol, days before the notorious January 6th invasion of that building, and because of that personally requested that 10,000 National Guard troops be deployed. Trump claimed that, before January 6th, his team alerted the Department of Defense about the crowds, which could be of excessive size, and that that manu guardsmen should be prepared to deploy. Trump further claimed that he passed a warning about this to leaders at the Capitol, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and received feedback that the troop request was rejected because those leaders were put off by the thought of so many troops ringing the Capitol.\n\nOkay, this claim doesn't even pass the initial sniff test. It is very well established that Trump loves to brag about crowd sizes for his events, and would never do anything to deter numbers — particularly after some crowd size failures that greatly embarassed him. Further, this was a rally where he specifically called for big numbers in his December 19th invitation for his crazies to amass in Washington: \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\" In the Fox interview, Trump claimed that he \"hated\" to see what happened on Jan. 6 at the U.S Capitol — a claim directly refuted by eyewitness accounts of him gleefully watching the riot on TV, and refusing to take any action as Capitol defenders were being attacked and the building desecrated. Subsequent hearings about the riot produced no evidence that indicated Nancy Pelosi had anything to do with the decision of how or when to deploy National Guard troops, either before or during the riot. There is no evidence that Trump took any initiative to have any troops guard the Capitol during his rally. Now the blatantly obvious fact: Trump addressed and agitated that crowd on the morning of January 6th. He saw how large the crowd was. And he directed them to go to the Capitol, where the election was being \"stolen\", saying that he would march with them (his lie to them). The manifest reality is that Trump fomented the crowd, after two months of lying to his base about \"widespread voting fraud\", and sent them to the Capitol to keep the disloyal Pence and weak Republican senators from affirming Biden as the winner of the election. For his many months of lies undermining the election, the rule of law, and the Constitution, Trump was impeached a second time...and in the Senate there was the most bi-partisan vote to convict of any impeachment. Trump's fiction about troops for the Capitol is yet another concoction to try to absolve himself from responsibility for whatever goes wrong around him.\n\nTrump appears at CPAC, repeating his big lie\n\nSunday, February 28, 2021: It's Conservative Political Action Conference time, when the delusional usurpers of the Republican Party get together to reinforce their extreme distortion of reality and assure that everyone is up on the latest fabricated doctrine and in sync with the current lies. This year, CPAC featured a roughly 78\" tall shiny gold fiberglas sculpture of Trump holding a magic wand, made by artist Tommy Zegan. This succinctly summarizes today's Republican Party: a cult worshiping its cult leader, as devoid of principles and policies as CPAC itself. In contrast to the golden calf of the Bible, in this party we have mock conservatives worshiping a bloated con-man.\n\nTrump took to the stage to address these fake Republicans and claim that he isn't going to start another political party (though he actually is the leader of The Trump Party). He teased running again in 2024, saying: \"I may even decide to beat them for a third time\" — which is perpetuation of his big lie that he won the 2020 election, and that it was stolen from him. Of course, Trump's reality in 2024 is likely to be a full time effort to defend himself in a raft of criminal and civil prosecutions.\n\nSpeaking of CPAC: If you want to understand the objectives of right wing extremist groups like this, just examine the demographics of the attendees. You can also observe the complexions of the fully qualified candidates that President Biden put before the Senate, and the Republicans in that body going out of their way to publicly brand them as \"dangerous\".\n\nHe packed the Supreme Court solely to protect himself — but to no avail\n\nMonday, February 22, 2021: The U.S. Supreme Court today rejected Trump's last attempt to shield his tax and other records from prosecutors in New York; this, in a one-sentence order with no recorded dissents. Over many years, Trump has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep his financial records secret (just like his academic records) so that he could brag about being boundlessly wealthy without having to produce proof — Trump's perpedual modus operandi to make claims without basis. The Trump habit of deceit. You may remember Trump having invented the fiction of \"absolute immunity\" to try to shield himself against everything while he was president. The Supreme Court did not at all agree with that philosophy, though Trump's so-called Justice Department under his stooge Bill Barr endeavored to regard Trump as all-powerful and immune. As many have said, once Trump was out of office, he would be subject to many investigations and law suits, and that is what is happening now. Hooray.\n\nA seriously rattled Trump, perceiving the legal system coming for him, predictably lashed out, having yet another grievance for his thick catalog of grievances, issuing the following statement today (while portraying himself as still being president):\n\n— February 22, 2021 —\n\nStatement on the Continuing Political Persecution of President Donald J. Trump\n\nThis investigation is a continuation of the greatest political Witch Hunt in the history of our Country, whether it was the never ending $32 million Mueller hoax, which already investigated everything that could possibly be investigated, \"Russia Russia Russia,\" where there was a finding of \"No Collusion,\" or two ridiculous \"Crazy Nancy\" inspired impeachment attempts where I was found NOT GUILTY. It just never ends!\n\nSo now, for more than two years, New York City has been looking at almost every transaction I've ever done, including seeking tax returns which were done by among the biggest and most prestigious law and accounting firms in the U.S. The Tea Party was treated far better by the IRS than Donald Trump. The Supreme Court never should have let this \"fishing expedition\" happen, but they did. This is something which has never happened to a President before, it is all Democrat-inspired in a totally Democrat location, New York City and State, completely controlled and dominated by a heavily reported enemy of mine, Governor Andrew Cuomo. These are attacks by Democrats willing to do anything to stop the almost 75 million people (the most votes, by far, ever gotten by a sitting president) who voted for me in the election — an election which many people, and experts, feel that I won. I agree!\n\nThe new phenomenon of \"headhunting\" prosecutors and AGs — who try to take down their political opponents using the law as a weapon — is a threat to the very foundation of our liberty. That's what is done in third world countries. Even worse are those who run for prosecutorial or attorney general offices in far-left states and jurisdictions pledging to take out a political opponent. That's fascism, not justice — and that is exactly what they are trying to do with respect to me, except that the people of our Country won't stand for it.\n\nIn the meantime, murders and violent crime are up in New York City by record numbers, and nothing is done about it. Our elected officials don't care. All they focus on is the persecution of President Donald J. Trump.\n\nI will fight on, just as I have, for the last five years (even before I was successfully elected), despite all of the election crimes that were committed against me. We will win!\n\nWhat has to be additionally rattling Trump is that Manhattan's district attorney Cyrus Vance has brought in top prosecutor Mark Pomerantz to join its Trump investigation. Pomerantz is expert in pursuing white collar and crime boss cases. He will be investigating the highly suspect Trump Organization for having committed insurance and tax fraud.\n\nJust hours after the Supreme Court statement, the subpoenaed tax records were turned over the New York District Attorney's office. The material reportedly consisted of millions of pages of documents spanning from January 2011 to August 2019, as well as financial statements, engagement agreements, documents relating to the preparation and review of tax returns, and work papers and communications related to the tax returns.\n\nGreg Abbott demonstrates how much Republicans love to lie\n\nWednesday, February 17, 2021: Texas has been in disaster state this week as deep cold and snow descended from the arctic, resulting in state-wide loss of electrical power...including at water purification and pumping stations. The population has been enduring single-digit freezing cold with no water...and with no water, no way to allow faucets to drip to prevent freezing pipes. This, while adjacent Arkansas had no such problems. What gives here? This is the result of Texas going it alone, refusing to join the eastern or western U.S. grids as all other states do. Texas went through similar situations in 2008 and 2011. After the 2011 event there was a study as to what needed to be done to keep this from happening again, where the recommendations were to weatherize, insulate, and otherwise protect the major components of the electrical infrastructure. The situation repeated itself in this arctic plunge because state leadership continued to take the tack of doing nothing, letting the least regulation of any state prevail, so as to maximize corporate profits by skimping on infrastructure.\n\nIn the midst of this emergency, Texas governor Greg Abbott went on Fox News to blame the outage on Democrats and their Green New Deal — despite no aspect of Green New Deal anywhere near implementation. Talking with Fox News's Hannity, Abbott proclaimed:\n\n\"This shows how the Green New Deal would be a deadly deal for the United States of America. Our wind and our solar got shut down, and they were collectively more than 10 percent of our power grid, and that thrust Texas into a situation where it was lacking power on a statewide basis. ... It just shows that fossil fuel is necessary.\"\n\nObserve the magnitude of that lie: that it was the wind and solar units by themselves caused the entire electrical system to fail. That's absurd and completely untrue. Abbott took the opportunity to lie to the nation as to the cause of the failure of the state electrical system. Interestingly, minutes earlier, Abbott was on local TV explaining that the failure was due to frozen gas supply infrastructure as feeds the power plants. This defines Abbott as an opportunistic liar. And, like liar Trump, he takes no responsibility for what happened in his state. Standard procedure for Republicans, where the buck always stops somewhere else.\n\nOh... And what about that self-righteous, loud-mouthed, and Senate-hated Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz? What's he doing to help his state in this emergency? He was caught quietly flying down to sunny, warm Cancun, to stay at the Ritz-Carlton (where his wife says they have stayed \"many times\") at the same time that his fellow Texans were literally freezing. Abandoning the people who voted for you is a huge political \"don't\". But, of course, those are just \"the little people\", as the elite view the public. Ted's office had nothing to say about this disappearing act. (And some in his office weren't even informed that he was going to Mexico.) As word of Ted's exploit spread and his trip became untenable, Cruz boarded a standby flight to return to Texas. His office would then be able to say that a concerned Ted was on the job, and avoid questions on where he had been. Cruz then lied about this travesty, first concocting the story that he was just escorting his children to the Mexico resort, then when that was found to be a lie, he admitted that he actually intended to stay in Mexico through the weekend. What a shithead. The Republican leadership in Texas is thoroughly corrupt, convinced that they are entitled, and don't have to answer to anyone. Texas: You should have voted for Beto O'Rourke...a guy who takes public service seriously and isn't obsessed with himself.\n\nTrump casts Giuliani adrift\n\nTuesday, February 16, 2021: Senior Trump adviser Jason Miller today said that former President Donald Trump's longtime personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, is \"not currently representing President Trump in any legal matters.\" Chalk it up to Trump's poor judgement to have retained the Giuliani clown show as long as he did. Well, Giuliani is now free to pursue other clients (maybe Four Seasons Total Landscaping?).\n\nTrump attacks McConnell (again)\n\nTuesday, February 16, 2021: Trump, the juvenile bully, launched into another attack today, his target being Mitch McConnell...in retribution for McConnell having proclaimed Trump responsible for what happened at the Capitol on January 6th. Trump issued this missive today:\n\n\"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America\n\nThe Republican Party can never again be respected or strong with political leaders\" like Sen. Mitch McConnell at its helm. McConnell's dedication to business as usual, status quo policies, together with his lack of political insight, wisdom, skill, and personality, has rapidly driven him from Majority Leader to Minority Leader, and it will only get worse. The Democrats and Chuck Schumer play McConnell like a fiddle — they've never had it so good — and they want to keep it that way! We know our America First agenda is a winner, not McConnell's Beltway First agenda or Biden's America Last.\n\nIn 2020, I received the most votes of any sitting President in history, almost 75,000,000. Every incumbent House Republican won for the first time in decades, and we flipped 15 seats, almost costing Nancy Pelosi her job. Republicans won majorities in at least 59 of the 98 partisan legislative chambers, and the Democrats failed to flip a single legislative chamber from red to blue. And in \"Mitch's Senate,\" over the last two election cycles, I single-handedly saved at least 12 Senate seats, more than eight in the 2020 cycle alone and then came the Georgia disaster, where we should have won both U.S. Senate seats, but McConnell matched the Democrat offer of $2,000 stimulus checks with $600. How does that work? It became the Democrats' principal advertisement, and a big winner for them it was. McConnell then put himself, one of the most unpopular politicians in the United States, into the advertisements. Many Republicans in Georgia voted Democrat, or just didn't vote, because of their anguish at their inept Governor, Brian Kemp, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, and the Republican Party, for not doing its job on Election Integrity during the 2020 Presidential race.\n\nIt was a complete election disaster in Georgia, and certain other swing states. McConnell did nothing, and will never do what needs to be done in order to secure a fair and just electoral system into the future. He doesn't have what it takes, never did, and never will.\"\n\nSo, here is Trump once again propping up his big lie that the election was rigged, that he was entitled to win, and that Republican leaders failed to negate the legitimate results of the election to keep Trump in office.\n\nMitch McConnell delivers damning statement on Trump's responsibility in the January 6th Capitol attack\n\nSaturday, February 13, 2021: Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell stood on the floor of the Senate after the Senate vote to acquit Trump in his impeachment trial and delivers this speech assigning blame for the Capitol attack squarely on Trump:\n\n\"January 6th was a disgrace. American citizens attacked their own government. They used terrorism to try to stop a specific piece of democratic business they did not like. Fellow Americans beat and bloodied our own police. They stormed the Senate floor. They tried to hunt down the Speaker of the House. They built a gallows and chanted about murdering the Vice President. They did this because they had been fed wild falsehoods by the most powerful man on Earth — because he was angry he'd lost an election. Former President Trump's actions preceding the riot were a disgraceful dereliction of duty. The House accused the former President of, quote, 'incitement.' That is a specific term from the criminal law. Let me put that to the side for one moment and reiterate something I said weeks ago: There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day. The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their President. And their having that belief was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories, and reckless hyperbole which the defeated President kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet Earth. The issue is not only the President's intemperate language on January 6th. It is not just his endorsement of remarks in which an associate urged 'trial by combat.' It was also the entire manufactured atmosphere of looming catastrophe; the increasingly wild myths about a reverse landslide election that was being stolen in some secret coup by our now-President. I defended the President's right to bring any complaints to our legal system. The legal system spoke. The Electoral College spoke. As I stood up and said clearly at the time, the election was settled. But that reality just opened a new chapter of even wilder and more unfounded claims. The leader of the free world cannot spend weeks thundering that shadowy forces are stealing our country and then feign surprise when people believe him and do reckless things. Sadly, many politicians sometimes make overheated comments or use metaphors that unhinged listeners might take literally. This was different. This was an intensifying crescendo of conspiracy theories, orchestrated by an outgoing president who seemed determined to either overturn the voters' decision or else torch our institutions on the way out. The unconscionable behavior did not end when the violence began. Whatever our ex-President claims he thought might happen that day... whatever reaction he says he meant to produce... by that afternoon, he was watching the same live television as the rest of the world. A mob was assaulting the Capitol in his name. These criminals were carrying his banners, hanging his flags, and screaming their loyalty to him. It was obvious that only President Trump could end this. Former aides publicly begged him to do so. Loyal allies frantically called the Administration. But the President did not act swiftly. He did not do his job. He didn't take steps so federal law could be faithfully executed, and order restored. Instead, according to public reports, he watched television happily as the chaos unfolded. He kept pressing his scheme to overturn the election! Even after it was clear to any reasonable observer that Vice President Pence was in danger... even as the mob carrying Trump banners was beating cops and breaching perimeters... the President sent a further tweet attacking his Vice President. Predictably and foreseeably under the circumstances, members of the mob seemed to interpret this as further inspiration to lawlessness and violence. Later, even when the President did halfheartedly begin calling for peace, he did not call right away for the riot to end. He did not tell the mob to depart until even later. And even then, with police officers bleeding and broken glass covering Capitol floors, he kept repeating election lies and praising the criminals. In recent weeks, our ex-President's associates have tried to use the 74 million Americans who voted to re-elect him as a kind of human shield against criticism. Anyone who decries his awful behavior is accused of insulting millions of voters. That is an absurd deflection. 74 million Americans did not invade the Capitol. Several hundred rioters did. And 74 million Americans did not engineer the campaign of disinformation and rage that provoked it. One person did. I have made my view of this episode very plain. But our system of government gave the Senate a specific task. The Constitution gives us a particular role. This body is not invited to act as the nation's overarching moral tribunal. We are not free to work backward from whether the accused party might personally deserve some kind of punishment. Justice Joseph Story was our nation's first great constitutional scholar. As he explained nearly 200 years ago, the process of impeachment and conviction is a narrow tool for a narrow purpose. Story explained this limited tool exists to \"secure the state against gross official misdemeanors.\" That is, to protect the country from government officers. If President Trump were still in office, I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge. By the strict criminal standard, the President's speech probably was not incitement. However, in the context of impeachment, the Senate might have decided this was acceptable shorthand for the reckless actions that preceded the riot. But in this case, that question is moot. Because former President Trump is constitutionally not eligible for conviction. There is no doubt this is a very close question. Donald Trump was the President when the House voted, though not when the House chose to deliver the papers. Brilliant scholars argue both sides of the jurisdictional question. The text is legitimately ambiguous. I respect my colleagues who have reached either conclusion. But after intense reflection, I believe the best constitutional reading shows that Article II, Section 4 exhausts the set of persons who can legitimately be impeached, tried, or convicted. The President, Vice President, and civil officers. We have no power to convict and disqualify a former officeholder who is now a private citizen. Here is Article II, Section 4: The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. Now, everyone basically agrees that the second half of that sentence exhausts the legitimate grounds for conviction. The debates around the Constitution's framing make that clear. Congress cannot convict for reasons besides those. It therefore follows that the list of persons in that same sentence is also exhaustive. There is no reason why one list would be exhaustive but the other would not. Article II, Section 4 must limit both why impeachment and conviction can occur... and to whom. If this provision does not limit the impeachment and conviction powers, then it has no limits at all. The House's 'sole power of Impeachment' and the Senate's 'sole Power to try all Impeachments' would create an unlimited circular logic, empowering Congress to ban any private citizen from federal office. This is an incredible claim. But it is the argument the House Managers seemed to make. One Manager said the House and Senate have 'absolute, unqualified... j"
