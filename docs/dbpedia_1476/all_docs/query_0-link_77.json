But with limited cooking experience and dwindling funds, this restaurant quickly becomes unlike any other with the entire team of chefs consisting of Italian grandmothers. The Italian nonnas make their Sunday dinners every day of the week (except Christmas and Easter) for anyone who needs to feel at home. Through the nonnas guidance, Joe finds a new purpose, community and love interest, and discovers it’s never too late to start again. The film was written by Liz Maccie and directed by Stephen Chbosky, who has wrote and directed on many other big films such as “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” and “Wonder.” Among those joining Tammy in the film, which wrapped up production right before the actor’s strike last summer in New Jersey, are some big names in the industry including Vince Vaughn (the main character), Susan Sarandon, Linda Cardellini, Joe Manganiello, and Stanley Tucci. In an exclusive interview with Happenings, Tammy divulged that she originally auditioned online for an entirely different part, which was ultimately given to another actress. Just as she was moving on from this decision, she received a call that they wanted her for a smaller part, Vince Vaughn’s cousin. Although this new role was only 3-lines, Tammy was more than willing to accept. “Vince is such a great improv actor that my original one-day scene stretched into four days of filming, and it was just such a fun experience! Although who knows how much of my character will actually make it in the movie, actors are always the last to know anything until the film gets released,” said Tammy. The release date for the film has yet to be announced but will be followed by a social impact campaign put on by the production and co-finance company 1Community, which will aim to protect and strengthen “the programs that help us age well.” Nonna’s unites entertainment company Madison Wells and 1Community who worked in close partnership with Maccie and began developing the project after purchasing Scaravella’s life rights. Tammy has only been serious in the acting scene since 2020, starring in multiple productions including the TV series “Blue Bloods,” and multiple films including “That’s Amore” where she played the loveable lead. But Tammy’s true passion lays in stand-up, which she’s been doing for decades. Her comedic career really took off after appearing on NBC’s “Last Comic Standing” in 2004 and making it as a finalist. “Don’t get me wrong, I really love acting and would never turn an opportunity for a role down, but I will never stop being a stand-up. There’s something so freeing and honest about performing in front of an audience, and at this point I’m a veteran in the industry and have done everything there is to do. I know what I bring to the table in that field, but in acting I still feel like a freshman,” said Tammy. Tammy has had an extremely successful career in stand-up, being known as the hardest working woman in comedy. But she attributes her biggest accomplishment to still being around. “When the Covid lockdown happened people who had been entertaining for decades were knocked down to the bottom of the barrel, so the fact that I am still kicking it and getting offers for new comedy specials and acting roles is a huge deal,” said Tammy. “I’ve been so fortunate to make a career out of this and I don’t plan on stopping anytime soon.” By Elaina Myers Veteran comedian Tammy Pescatelli to play Cousin Tammy in upcoming film ‘Nonna’s’ Tammy Pescatelli will undoubtedly bring brassy sexiness with a bold voice of witty sarcasm to the audience when she takes the stage at the Kenosha Comedy Club May 31st & June 1st Born Tamerisk Gillespie May 15th, 1969 (55 years old) Perry, Ohio She graduated from Kent State University with a degree in fashion design that she never ended up using because after graduation fate intervened in the form of a summer with her parents in Iowa, where she secured a gig at the local comedy club for some laughs and extra cash. About two weeks into the job a woman comic performed, which wasn’t common at that time, and sparked the desire in Tammy. Tammy has performed on various talk shows such as “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno” (x4),“The Talk” (2010), and “The View” (1997). She has also been a guest a number of times on endless comedy programs including “Comics Unleashed” (2006) and even won Comedy Central’s “Stand-up Showdown” in 2010. She co-created, wrote, produced and starred in the reality television show on WEtv called “A Stand Up Mother” in 2011. The show related to her life as a mother, wife and comedian after leaving Hollywood and starting a “quieter” life in Meadville, PA. In 2013, Netflix released her first comedy special “Finding the Funny,” which was selected ‘New and Noteworthy’ by iTunes and hit number 3 on their charts. In 2020, Tammy released her second comedy special called Way After School Special on Amazon Prime which was filmed at her former high school in Perry, Ohio. In 2023, Tammy started “The Cop and The Comedian” podcast with her lifelong friend Laura Park who is a retired law officer. The two talk about crime in comedy, using the knowledge that only 2 experts in each field would have. They plan to record the next season of the podcast soon.

In nearly all commercial products, from athome strips to mouthwashes, the key ingredient is hydrogen peroxide, which is generally safe but should be used with a few caveats. First, hydrogen peroxide's effectiveness depends on how long it remains on your teeth, its concentration and the source of the dental discoloration. Whitening with hydrogen peroxide is a temporary effect, but long-term use of the chemical is not recommended because constant, consistent exposure can cause gum irritation and pain. Hydrogen peroxide only eliminates superficial discoloration. Do alternative \"natural\" remedies, such as charcoal or concoctions like strawberries and baking soda (once touted by TV docs), work? In a word, no. Charcoal is mildly abrasive and can absorb surface stains to a degree, but there is no evidence that it removes stains below a tooth's enamel or dramatically whitens teeth. In experiments, the strawberry/baking soda remedy actually harmed teeth because malic acid in the berries eats away at tooth enamel. Regular, twice-a-day brushing and flossing remain the two most reliable and long-term ways to keep your teeth white and, more importantly, just keep them.

Observation \"I walk around like everything's fine, but deep down, inside my shoe, my sock is sliding off.\" — Anonymous Medical History This week in 1796, English physician Edward Jenner administered the first vaccination against smallpox to an 8-year-old boy. Jenner inoculated young James Phipps with material from the sores of dairymaid Sarah Nelmes, who had developed a mild case of cowpox. A few weeks later, Jenner tested the boy's resistance to smallpox by inoculating him with the more deadly smallpox virus. The immunization had been successful, supporting conventional wisdom that those who survived cowpox seemed to be immune to smallpox disease. Jenner's work was rapidly taken up in Europe and America. Perishable Publications Many, if not most, published research papers have titles that defy comprehension. They use specialized jargon, complex words and opaque phrases like \"nonlinear dynamics.\" Sometimes they don't, yet they're still hard to figure out. Here's an actual title of actual published research study: \"A mathematical model of Bieber Fever: The most infectious disease of our time?\" Published by Transworld Research Network in 2012, this tongue-in-cheek study by a pair of Canadian scientists equated contagious, growing public adoration for the Canadian pop singer Justin Bieber with the possible demise of an entire generation of young minds. Med School Q: What is a cholecyst? A: It's the medical term for gallbladder. Chole refers to bile; cyst is another word for bladder. Thus, \"bile bladder.\" Bile, which is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, aids digestion by breaking down fats into fatty acids that can be more easily used by the body.

Boesky reportedly died in his sleep at home in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, his daughter Marianne Bosky told The New York Times. Boesky, born in 1937 in Detroit, Mich., to Russian Jewish immigrants, was Wall Street's richest and best-known stock speculator when he pleaded guilty in November 1986 to insider trading and agreed to pay $100 million in penalties. Barred from the securities industry for life, Boesky, then age 50 in April 1987, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate securities laws. Lionel Messi's napkin agreement sells for nearly $1 million The napkin that then 13-year-old Lionel Messi signed as part of an initial agreement to join FC Barcelona sold for nearly $1 million in an auction Friday, British auction house Bonhams announced. A buyer purchased the keepsake for about $968,000 in the online sale. The starting bid was about $381,150. \"Since the sale was first announced. it captured international attention and fans all over the world have anticipated this day,\" Bonhams New York's head of fine books and manuscripts Ian Ehling said in a news release. \"What a wonderful result for one of the most thrilling items I have ever handled.\"Yes, it's a paper napkin, but it's the famous napkin that was at the inception of Lionel Messi's career. It changed the life of Messi, the future of FC Barcelona, and was instrumental in giving some of the most glorious moments of football to billions of fans around the globe.\" 'Gathering of Kyles' fails to earn Guinness World Record in Texas It's a sad day in Kyle, Texas, as the city's annual Gathering of Kyles once again failed to earn a G u i n n e s s World Record. The Gathering of Kyles, part of the annual Kyle Fair, aimed to break the Guinness World Record for the largest same-name gathering. Organizers counted 706 Kyles in attendance, falling far short of the number needed to beat the current record of 2,325, which was set at a gathering of people named Ivan in 2017. The total even fell short of last year's Texas event, which counted 1,490 Kyles in attendance. Organizers have not yet announced whether there will be another attempt in 2025. Red Lobster files for Chapter 11 after restaurant closures Red Lobster, one of the largest seafood restaurant chains in the country, officially filed for bankruptcy protection. The chain said it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, for now it will continue to operate through the bankruptcy but will reduce its locations and pursue a potential buyer. The chain closed 50 stores this month as rumors reported by Bloomberg and other news outlets swirled about bankruptcy. Red Lobster said it has entered into \"a stalkinghorse purchase agreement to which Red Lobster will sell its business to an entity formed and controlled by its existing term lenders.\" Red Lobster said it has been in communication with its vendors to make sure the running of its remaining restaurants remain smooth during the bankruptcy. It said the company has received a $100 million debtor-in-possession financial commitment from its existing lenders. Red Lobster lost $73 million last year, part of that on its regular \"endless shrimp\" promotion that went bad when the company changed the offering from once a week to daily in an illfated effort to boost sales in the second half of 2023. Daredevil walks tightrope between Los Angeles skyscrapers A daredevil risked his life -- and arrest -- when he walked a t i g h t r o p e s u s p e n d e d between a pair of graffiti-covered skyscrapers in downtown Los Angeles. Ben Schneider, 28, aka Reckless Ben on YouTube, posted a clip showing him walking the tightrope suspended between the two skyscrapers at Oceanwide Plaza, a vacant development that has become known as the graffiti towers due to the artwork covering the buildings. Schneider said he and his friends used distraction techniques to gain access to the buildings.' \"We pretended we were a religious cult and we got 20 people to all hold signs saying 'Jesus Saves' and the signs were blocking the police's point of view so we just hopped the fence,\" he told KTLA-TV. Schneider, who wore a safety harness during the stunt, crossed the nylon rope in about 2 minutes. Police said they are investigating the incident, but it was not clear if Schneider would face any charges. coast to coast U.S. hasn't seen an EF5 tornado in 11 years, longest gap An EF5 tornado is one of the most catastrophic weather events on Earth. Monstrous twisters of this magnitude can destroy entire neighborhoods in the blink of an eye, grow to be more than a mile wide and pack winds over 200 mph -- stronger than any Category 5 hurricane on record across the Atlantic basin. On May 20, 2013, an extremely powerful tornado destroyed a huge part of Moore, Okla. Eleven years later, it remains the most recent tornado to be rated EF5, the strongest possible rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. The 11-year gap is the longest since official U.S. records began in 1950. Meteorologist Bob Henson said in 2023 that the current EF5 \"drought\" is hard to explain since damage estimates can be subjective. Damage to a \"wellconstructed building\" is the most common factor that helps the National Weather Service (NWS) confirm an EF5, yet many homes in the U.S. do not meet that criteria. The Enhanced Fujita system is not likely to change from a ground-damage-based scale, Henson says, but new standards may be implemented to improve rural damage assessments based on damage to wind turbines, irrigation systems, farm silos, churches and passenger vehicles. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program at NIST is developing these standards, which would have to be adopted by NOAA's Storm Prediction Center to change the Enhanced Fujita Scale. scan for link Jake Hoey is a freelance meteorologist who graduated from the University of Oklahoma and has been operating “Jake’s Kenosha Area Weather Page” on Facebook for over 10 years!

Before you go, check out Visitstockholm.com and then consider whether to buy a Go City Pass ( www.gocity.com/stockholm ) – it covers a number of sights and includes bus and boat tours. And when you arrive, use the excellent public transportation system or taxis to get around. (Only a Swedish meatball would drive his car in Stockholm; park it in one of the park-and-ride lots that ring the city.) Stockholm, with more than 2 million people, is built on an archipelago of 14 islands woven together by 54 bridges. Gamla Stan, the city’s historic island core, is an Old Town of winding, lantern-lit streets, antiques shops, and classy cafés clustered around the Royal Palace. The palace hosts a fun, spirited Changing of the Guard ceremony. Of course, Stockholm has plenty of sights to keep tourists busy. Skansen is Europe’s original and best open-air folk museum. This huge park, with more than 150 historic homes, shops, churches, and schoolhouses transplanted from all corners of Sweden, makes for a fun trip back in time and brings Swedish traditions to life. The old interiors are wonderfully furnished, complete with guides dressed in traditional outfits. There’s fiddling, folk dancing, and public dancing to live bands on summer weekends. Think of it as Swedishculture-on-a-lazy-Susan, where visitors can sweep through the countryside and centuries of lifestyles without leaving the capital. Near Skansen, the mighty 17thcentury warship Vasa is chemically petrified and housed in a state-of-the-art museum. Heralded as the ultimate warship of her day, the Vasa sank just minutes into her maiden voyage, with 450 crew members on board. The year was 1628. The ship was top-heavy, with an extra row of cannons tacked on above and not enough ballast below. A breeze caught the sails and blew the ship over. The wreck spent more than 300 years at the bottom of Stockholm’s harbor before being dredged up in 1961. And the city managed to turn this titanic flop into a brilliant museum and one of Scandinavia’s great sightseeing attractions. While churches dominate cities in southern Europe, in the Scandinavian capitals, city halls take the lead. It’s clear that Stockholm’s City Hall rules the city. Constructed in 1923, it’s an amazing mix of eight million bricks and 19 million chips of gilt mosaic. To see the interior, take the entertaining tour. And for the best city view, climb the 348-foottall tower (an elevator takes you about halfway up). Stockholm’s dazzling Nobel banquet commences every December in City Hall, where the Nobel committee awards its prestigious prizes for chemistry, medicine, physics, economics, and literature. At the Nobel Prize Museum, portraits of all 700-plus winners hang from the ceiling, shuffling around the room like shirts at the dry cleaner’s. The museum’s Viennese-style café is the place to get creative with your coffee … and sample the famous Nobel ice cream. All Nobel laureates who visit the museum are asked to sign the bottom of a chair in the café. Turn over your chair to see who warmed the one you’ve been sitting on. If you just want to put on a heavy coat and drink a fancy vodka in a modern-day igloo, consider the fun, if touristy, Icebar. The room, windows, bar, and even the glasses are literally made out of ice. While modern and progressive, Stockholm reveres its traditions. Whether you’re celebrating ingenuity at the Nobel sights, strolling through the cobbled Old Town, grooving to ABBA, or crawling through Europe’s bestpreserved warship, you’ll be amazed both by Stockholm’s stunning past and its vibrant present. By Rick Steves Stockholm’s delights span the ages travel The reward for climbing the 348-foot-tall City Hall tower is a classic Stockholm view of the historic quarter of Gamla Stan, with the rest of the green and watery city spread out around it.

The game show, based on a U.K. format, asks 100 contestants a series of increasingly difficult questions. Wrong answers get contestants eliminated until the winner answers the final question. \"This is more about how your brain logically puts questions together,\" Oswalt, 55, told UPI in a recent interview. \"Everyone has different brain chemistry and structures.\" Easier questions involve spotting the difference between two pictures. More difficult ones involve mathematical word games. \"The phrasing, the intent, the context, all of those matter in the clues,\" Oswalt said. Joking with contestants The pool of contestants also gives Oswalt 100 people with whom to converse. Oswalt said he is often surprised by quieter contestants he has not spoken to until the last question. \"I haven't interacted with them and they've just been quietly getting it right,\" Oswalt said. \"They're just silently playing the game, silently destroying and we realize oh, you've been a contender this whole time and we didn't even know.\" Before the final question, the contestants have a chance to walk away with up to $10,000 split with other contestants who made it that far. But, if they answer the last question, they win $100,000. \"I was actually impressed by how many people had already built up a nice little pile and said, 'I don't care, I'm going for the hundred grand,'\" Oswalt said. \"That, to me, was constantly surprising and kind of inspiring. \" Oswalt said he enjoyed interacting with the contestants as the game went on. Oswalt said he kept those interactions improvisational, because prescripted banter \"comes out so stale and so cold.\" He said he considered the contestants his audience, like when he performs stand-up comedy. He said he even made up a song on the spot about one contestant. \"I made it into like a song you would sing about Frodo or Conan,\" Oswalt said. \"There are so many genuinely original personalities you meet.\" Trivia and history buff Oswalt said he can relate to the contestants because he plays along with game shows like Jeopardy! at home, adding that trivia games like that suit his mental process. \"If there's a factoid that will never benefit me in any way, that's going to stay in my head,\" Oswalt said. \"Phone numbers and cooking instructions and stuff that would actually make my life better, those do not stay there ever.\" Likewise, Oswalt said he cannot remember his online passwords, either. \"I am a password-free zone in my head,\" Oswalt said. \"Those have to be written down.\" With his first game show hosting role, The 1% Club follows another new sort of role in Oswalt's career. He appeared in the historical drama, Manhunt, playing Det. Lafayette Baker in the search for John Wilkes Booth. Oswalt said it was his dream to do a period piece, but compared its fulfillment to the monkey's paw curse. In this case, his period piece dream punished Oswalt with a heavy costume in a hot and humid environment. \"I ended up down in Savannah [Ga.] in July and August in a really heavy beard and a heavy wool union officer outfit,\" Oswalt said. \"So it's like OK, well, here's your costume drama, you dummy.\" Last year, Oswalt also got to see a live-action rendition of his animated character, Marvel's M.O.D.O.K. He voiced the floating head in a Hulu animated series in 2021, but Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania made Cory Stoll a live-action M.O.D.O.K. \"I have a lot of sympathy for Cory Stoll,\" Oswalt said. \"Not only is he doing motion capture of just his face, [but] they're also distorting his face. I don't think he gets enough credit for doing as good a job as he was able to do.\" Motion capture records an actor's performance and translates it into a computer-generated character in the film, like the Avatar characters or Planet of the Apes primates. Oswalt said he was actually touched by Stoll's performance in the film. \"He had to do all that acting, probably just sitting against a background while they're filming him,\" Oswalt said. \"I think that's a testament.\" In the future, Oswalt has standup dates booked through November and a recurring role in the upcoming Netflix series The Abandons. He said he also hopes to get to do another season of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The third season of the MST3K revival aired in 2022, and creator Joel Hodgson attempted to fund a fourth via Kickstarter last year. \"I just want more riffing over movies,\" Oswalt said. \"That's all I want.\" Oswalt is not one of the comedians or puppeteers who comment on movies as they play. He plays one of the evil villains who subject the heroes to bad movies in live-action segments. \"I'm setting up the riffing,\" Oswalt said. \"When I rewatch the shows, I just want to watch all the riffing.\" By Fred Topel Patton Oswalt: '1% Club' rewards 'different brain chemistry' Patton Oswalt now hosts his first game show with \"The 1% Club.\" After making his acting debut in the 1994 “Seinfeld” episode The Couch, he has appeared in a variety of television series, such as “Parks and Recreation,” “Community,” “Two and a Half Men,” “Drunk History,” “Reno 911!,” “Mystery Science Theater 3000,” “Archer,” “Veep,” “Justified,” “Kim Possible,” “Modern Family,” and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.” He also portrayed Principal Ralph Durbin in “A.P.

I know, I know, this isn't an airport, I don't need to announce my departure. I just know how some of you worry about me if I don't post often enough. But, I'm good. Honest. Taking a little social media cleanse/detox and a mental health break is a good thing, and I'm grateful I'm at a place in my life where I'm aware enough to know when I'm overwhelmed and mentally/emotionally exhausted. Y'all take care of yourselves. I'll be back before you know it.\" While on the promotion trail for her new book,Indulge: Delicious and Decadent Dishes to Enjoy and Share, Valerie Bertinelli announces on Instagram that she is taking a break from social media. \"It's been a year. Folks expect your life to change in some radical way, and it doesn't. It just changes that you get a level of freedom that you're happy with. No one's going to throw me a parade. It's more about me being happy.\" A year after he announced that he was pansexual, actor Wayne Brady says life doesn’t look all that different.

You gotta oil the muscles again and get everything working again. You go through that a couple of shows, and you get your legs. I wouldn't say nervous anymore. I think it's more that I get excited. I just love doing stand-up.\" Which long time comedian recently talked about returning to their stand-up roots with a US tour this summer? For the answer, visit hap2it.com! A. Eddie Izzard B.

Spur of the moment outings might be exciting and fun for you to experience. You might find something unusual or original that suits your taste and style at a thrift store or unique market. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): You might yearn for something more exciting than the typical escape but may settle for being the life of the party. A little compromise and openness may attract a new opportunity to collaborate with someone. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Your mind is yours to command; you can steer it any way that you choose by using your imagination. Thoughts can be a tool that can help to mold the experiences you attract, do your best to remain optimistic and cheerful. CANCER (June 21-July 22): Organize your devices or tackle your to do list; get everything sorted when you have a chance. Making new contacts and scheduling in time for networking could help you achieve your ambitions in the week to come. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): There is never a dull moment within your inner circle. You may have exquisite taste especially when it comes to your environment. You may uncover advantageous information that could give your bank account a much-needed boost. VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): You could be attracted to items of quality, so consider making a purchase that catches your eye today. You may open yourself up to make a few extra dollars this week by tapping into your skillset and desire to succeed. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Today may bring several exciting things to do beyond your typical activities. You may feel called to spend time with a friend or take a day trip to a local attraction. There could be an opportunity to apologize or mend fences with someone. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): You might be deeply touched by someone who may possess seemingly angelic qualities, someone who is generous with their praise and support could lift up your spirits. This may be a good day to make amends in strained relationships. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): What attracts your attention now may not seem quite as fascinating next week. That is why it may be useful to seize any opportunity to indulge in some momentary pleasures. Ground yourself and live in the moment. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): New friends could add some excitement to your day by inviting you to participate in unusual activities. You might be faced with making major changes, consider opting for temporary measures as they could be the safest bet. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): our determination and stamina is valuable, but it’s important to take a break from time to time. Cherish moments surrounded by your support system and put your ambitions on the back burner for some much-needed relaxation. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Engaging in group outings or local community events could be more enjoyable than staying home alone. However, it might be wise to prioritize politeness and avoid discussions that might clash with any popular opinions.
