Children's TV kept Valentine busy, casting him as Humphrey Beverley in The Children of the New Forest (1955), JO Stagg in Rex Milligan (1956) and Lord Mauleverer (1955), then Harry Wharton (1956-57), in Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School. He also sang in the children's magazine show Whirligig  accompanied by Steve Race on the piano  and for two seasons in operas at Sadler's Wells Theatre.\n\nBut he came into his own as Edward Woodwards fellow Secret Service agent and rival Toby Meres in the first two series of Callan (ITV, 1967-69), a character he brought to life as a supercilious upper-class thug whose urbane demeanour somehow fails to conceal his total lack of moral compass.\n\nHe became a household name as the sadistic German Luftwaffe officer Major Horst Mohn in the BBC series Colditz (1972-74) and was the gentleman jewel thief and ladies man in the Yorkshire Television hit series Raffles (1977).\n\nValentines other television credits included Dr Finlays Casebook, Softly Softly, Lovejoy, The Detectives, Tales of the Unexpected and Robin of Sherwood (ITV 1984-86). more....\n\nRedvers Kyle, television announcer, has died aged 85(27 November 2015)\n\nRedvers Kyle arrived in England in 1952 from his native South Africa, and spent a year teaching in a south London school before becoming a freelance radio and television broadcaster for the BBC.\n\nWith the arrival of Independent Television in 1955 he switched to ATV London as a presenter and also joined ITN News. The following year he moved to Associated-Rediffusion (until 1968). In addition to Looking and Seeing, he worked on several other programmes including the childrens show Tuesday Rendezvous.\n\nIn 1968 he moved as chief announcer to the new Yorkshire Television in Leeds, becoming one of the best-known voices on the station, where he remained until his retirement in 1993. more....\n\nHazel Adair, writer of Crossroads and other television and radio soap operas, has died aged 95 (23 November 2015)\n\nHazel Adair was a pioneer of soap opera on British television. She was the co-creator of Sixpenny Corner, Britains first daily soap; Compact, the first serial to feature a regular black character; and, most famously, Crossroads.\n\nAdair wrote scripts for two series, At Your Service, Ltd (1951), with Robert Tronson, and Stranger from Space (1951-53), with her husband Ronald Marriott.\n\nShe also became a scriptwriter on the weekday radio serial Mrs Dales Diary, alongside others such as Peter Ling and its lead writer, Jonquil Antony. This led her to create, with Antony, ITVs first soap opera, Sixpenny Corner (1955-56): the first on British television to run five days a week.\n\nFrom 1957, when the hugely popular Emergency  Ward 10 was launched, Adair wrote episodes of the hospital serial. She also co-wrote the spin-off film, Life in Emergency Ward 10 (1959), and the 1961 comedy Dentist on the Job.\n\nAlso a writer for magazines, Adair was sitting in the offices of Womans Own waiting to deliver a feature when she had the idea for Compact (1962-65), a serial based in the world of magazine publishing.\n\nIn 1967, Adair and Peter Ling devised Champion House (1967-68), a BBC drama series about a family-run textile firm. more....\n\nPeter Dimmock, TV broadcaster and producer, has died aged 94(22 November 2015)\n\nPeter Dimmock became the face of BBC Sport in the 1950s, having already made his reputation as a gifted television producer by organising coverage of the Queens Coronation in 1953, the moment the fledgling medium came of age. Dimmock had spent a year planning coverage of the day and, with technical skill and stylish aplomb, had succeeded in capturing the majestic drama as it unfolded live in front of a watching audience of more than 20 million in Britain  nearly half the population  and many millions more worldwide.\n\nNo television broadcast had been so prepared and so polished, and for this Dimmock deserved a large share of the credit. As the director as well as the producer, he displayed an intuitive eye for delivering pictures that he knew the public wanted to see.\n\nIn 1948 Dimmock had helped to organise the BBCBBC record. After s coverage of the London Olympics. In the course of 15 days he oversaw 70 hours of television coverage, a commentating on the 1949 Boat Race, he produced the BBCpictures to Britain s first televised Test match from Trent Bridge in 1950, and organised the first relay of live television from Calais in the same year.\n\nIn February 1952 Dimmock arranged television coverage of the funeral of King George VI. The sombre images of Queens at the door of Westminster Hall were three black-veiled more eloquent of the passing of an era than any spoken commentary.\n\nDimmock began to carve out a parallel on-screen career as the anchorman of the BBCprogramme switched from Thursday to a peak slot on Wednesday nights in August 1955, 21 per cent of the adult population regularly tuned in. In the lahost of Grandstand, before handing over the reins to David Coleman. Sportsview ran until 1964. s first the first regular sports magazine programme Sportsview, launched in April 1954.\n\nIn the meantime Dimmock had produced and directed the State Opening of Parliament in 1958 and, two years later, the first televised Grand National. In the same year Dimmock supervised television coverage of the wedding of Princess Margaret to Anthony Armstrong-Jones, later Lord Snowdon. From 1963 until the Queens silver jubilee in 1977, he was the BBCs liaison executive with the Royal family.\n\nMore than any other individual, he could be said to have single-handedly created the corporations outside broadcast department, having produced, directed and commentated on virtually every important event in the 1940s and early 1950s . Dimmock was also a great discoverer of television talent, and launched the broadcasting careers of Harry Carpenter, Peter OSullevan and Eddie Waring, among others.\n\nIn 1972 he was appointed general manager of BBC Enterprises, the corporations commercial arm.\n\nHe was wounded and disappointed when the BBC failed to invite him to the service at Westminster Abbey in June 2013, attended by the Queen, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Coronation.\n\nHe was appointed OBE in 1961 and CVO in 1968. In 1977 he was made a Freeman of the City of London, and the following year was elected a Fellow of the Royal Television Society. more....\n\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/peter-dimmock-pioneering-broadcaster-and-producer-who-played-a-pivotal-role-in-the-growth-of-a6744231.html\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/22/peter-dimmock\n\nJoy Beverley, singer, has died aged 91(1 September 2015)\n\nJoy Beverley was the eldest of the Beverley Sisters, the close-harmony trio whose novelty songs became hits in the 1950s who found fame in the pre-rock and roll era with novelty songs such as I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus and Little Drummer Boy.\n\nDuring the war, the girls were evacuated together to Leicestershire and Northamptonshire, where they amused themselves by singing close harmony. Spotted by a man recruiting for the Ovaltinies, the harmony-singing advert for Ovaltine on Radio Luxembourg, they soon caught the eye of Glenn Miller and went on to record with his orchestra. Having signed their first contract, with Columbia Records, in 1951, by 1952 they were starring at the London Palladium. The following year they had their first Top 10 hit with I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus, which reached No 6 in the charts.\n\nAs well as pop hits, for seven years during the 1940s and 1950s they had their own BBC television series , and they frequently topped the bill at the London Palladium, alongside such stars as Danny Kaye, Bob Hope and Max Bygraves, taking part in several Royal Command performances. more....\n\nGeorge Cole, actor, has died aged 90(6 August 2015)\n\nGeorge Cole was a comic actor who excelled at playing shifty 'spivs such as the roguish Arthur Daley in Minder.\n\nHe appeared in a couple of films before joining the RAF in 1943. After the war Cole returned to acting, appearing in a variety of mediocre films including My Brothers Keeper (1948), The Spider and the Fly (1949) and Gone to Earth (1950). He had greater success with Alastair Sim in the classic comedies Laughter in Paradise (1951) and Scrooge (1952).\n\nOver the next decade, Cole and Sim repeated their screen partnership in a string of films, the most successful of which were the St Trinians series, directed by Frank Launder. In the first, The Belles of St Trinians (1954), Cole (as the spiv Flash Harry) received third billing after Sim and Joyce Grenfell. The film was extremely successful and was followed by five more, including Blue Murder at St Trinians (1958) and Coles only film in the series without Sim, The Pure Hell of St Trinians (1961).\n\nBetween films, Cole starred as the bumbling bachelor David Bliss in the long-running BBC radio series A Life of Bliss (118 episodes, 1952-67). The show was broadcast on Sunday afternoons. Cole recalled it as wholesome to the point of nausea, and insisted that the best part of the show had been Percy Edwardss performance as Psyche the dog. more....\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11710589/George-Cole-actor-obituary.html\n\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/george-cole-treasured-comic-actor-who-starred-as-the-lovable-rogue-arthur-daley-in-minder-10444193.html\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/aug/06/george-cole\n\nVal Doonican, singer, has died aged 88(3 July 2015)\n\nVal Doonican, the Irish singer who has died aged 88, rose to fame in the early 1960s when he appeared in Sunday Night at the London Palladium; his relaxed manner and easy charm made him extremely popular with family audiences, who appreciated his whimsical renditions of folk songs such as Paddy McGintys Goat, ORaffertys Motor Car and Delaneys Donkey.\n\nDoonican distinguished himself from other performers at that time by sporting a range of knitwear more usually seen in Lapland and by performing many of his songs while sitting in a rocking chair.\n\nIn 1951 Val Doonican moved to London and made his radio debut as a member of the Four Ramblers on Riders of the Range. He played one of a number of bunk-house boys who were heard crooning cowboy songs in the gaps between the action. At the same time he was supplementing his income by writing musical accompaniments for Tex Ritter.\n\nWhen not performing as cowboys, the group toured Britain, appearing at various variety venues. By 1953 they were working regularly in cabaret, performing at American Air Bases.\n\nIn 1959 Val Doonican auditioned as a solo performer with BBC radio and was offered a spot on Dreamy Afternoon which led to his own show, Your Date with Val. Doonicanss mix of songs and stories proved popular and the following year he was touring the country with his own show. In 1964 Val Doonican was offered a spot on ITVs Sunday Night at the London Palladium and was acclaimed as an overnight star. Within a year he was appearing on BBC television in The Val Doonican Music Show and was voted BBC Personality of the Year (an award he won three times altogether). more....\n\nMarguerite Patten, food writer and broadcaster, has died aged 99(10 June 2015)\n\nMarguerite Patten helped the nation to feed itself through the war years and for the next half century taught the British how to cook \"sensible food in an appetising manner\".\n\nAs a home economist with the Ministry of Food during the war, Marguerite Patten showed housewives how to get by with a tin of Spam and a ration book. She rose to prominence in the post-war years, becoming one of the BBCs first food broadcasters, on Kitchen Front and then on Womans Hour.\n\nMarguerite Patten predated Philip Harben, the Cradocks and Elizabeth David and endured for decades longer. She was the most prolific cookery writer ever, the author of more than 165 cookery books, which sold over 17 million copies worldwide. She was also one of the few people ever to have been decorated for their services to cookery.\n\nFrom 1947 Marguerite Patten was the BBCs first regular television cook, on Kitchen Front. She gave recipes on Womans Hour from its second day, and even starred in cookery shows at the Palladium. In 1952, she wrote a regular column for The Daily Telegraph called Merry-go-round of Meals.\n\nOver the next 40 years, as Britain moved from being the nation with the reputation for the worst cooking in Europe to the most cosmopolitan food culture on earth, Marguerite Patten played a full part in showing the amateur cook how to get to grips with the huge new range of ingredients and fashions. more....\n\nPeter Howell, stage and screen actor, has died aged 95(11 May 2015)\n\nPeter Howell found himself catapulted into the spotlight  and up to 24 million viewers homes  when he played Dr Peter Harrison in British televisions first medical soap, Emergency  Ward 10. Howell joined the twice-weekly serial in 1958, a year after it began, and appeared in 111 episodes through most of its 10-year history. Although he left in 1964, when audience figures were starting to slip, he returned for a short run two years later and a special appearance in the final episode, in 1967.\n\nHis West End stage plays included The Affair (Strand theatre, 1961), The Doctors Dilemma (Theatre Royal, Haymarket, 1963), Little Boxes (Duchess theatre, 1968) and Conduct Unbecoming (Queens theatre, 1969).\n\nAmong Howells dozens of television roles were Lord Howard in Elizabeth R (1971), Julius Caesar in Heil Caesar! (1973), Francis Knollys in Edward the King (1975), Uncle Glegg in The Mill on the Floss (1979) and Sir William Lucas in Pride and Prejudice (1980), as well as various priests, detectives, lawyers, judges, headmasters and army officers. more....\n\nPamela Cundell, actress, singer and comedian, has died aged 95(8 May 2015)\n\nShe was best known on television for her regular appearances as the spoony, matronly-built Mrs Fox in Dad's Army, smothering American soldiers with her affections and flirting her way into getting an extra sausage off the ration from the meek butcher Corporal Jones (Clive Dunn).\n\nFull of life, and habitually bursting into rehearsals with a flourishing \"hello darlings!\", Pamela Cundell's music-hall sense of showmanship cast her first and foremost as a comedy player.\n\nIn the final days of music hall she appeared as a singer and comedian alongside such stars as Jimmy Jewel, Terry Scott and Sid Millward and His Nitwits. Throughout the 1950s, alongside Dick Emery, she was a regular on BBC Radio's Workers' Playtime.\n\nShe appeared regularly in seaside revues such as Between Ourselves, which toured the east coast in 1955, and began her association with the gloriously bovine Bill Fraser, through whom she made her first television appearances in 1961 in the sitcom Bootsie and Snudge, a civvy street spin-off from The Army Game that starred Fraser and Alfie Bass. more....\n\nRonnie Carroll, Eurovision singer, has died aged 80(14 April 2015)\n\nAfter Carroll appeared in a BBC television talent show, Camera One in 1956, positive reaction to his warm baritone led to a recording contract with Philips and to frequent radio appearances on the Light Programme and Radio Luxembourg. Carroll was also a guest on the television shows of Morecambe and Wise, Bruce Forsyth, Kathy Kirby and others.\n\nAlso in 1956 his first hit record, Walk Hand in Hand, reached No 13 and the following year The Wisdom of a Fool entered the top 20. Further records were less successful, until in 1962 Carroll had a top 10 hit with Roses Are Red (My Love).\n\nIn 1962 Carroll was also chosen as the national standard bearer for that years Eurovision song contest. His song, Ring-a-Ding Girl, came a creditable fourth, a good enough position to ensure that Carroll became the first vocalist to represent Britain in the contest for two years running. His 1963 entry, Say Wonderful Things, composed by Norman Newell, also achieved fourth place. more....\n\nShaw Taylor, television presenter, has died aged 90(18 March 2015)\n\nAfter the War, a London County Council grant afforded him two years at Rada, where a heavy Cockney accent was ironed out of him. Work on stage in the West End and small parts in films and television dramas followed throughout the 1950s.\n\nAfter standing in for six weeks as a relief announcer at ATV in the summer of 1957 Taylor was offered a staff job at the station. Tired of the thespian life and describing himself as an actor of no consequence, he decided on a change of direction and began his career in broadcasting.\n\nHe quickly became one of the stations best-known faces, and was in demand as a quizmaster on shows like Tell the Truth, Pencil and Paper and Password and Dotto. He also commented on royal occasions and on ITVs coverage of the Cenotaph ceremony, and worked as a sports commentator for the channel.\n\nBut it was as the host of Police 5 that Taylor found sustained success. The show was the brainchild of Steve Wade, the head of outside broadcasts at ATV. It was commissioned by the ATV boss Lew Grade in June 1962 and devised to fill a gap left by an American import that ran for 55 minutes instead of the required 60 minutes. more....\n\nGerry Wells, radio enthusiast, has died aged 85(December 2014)\n\nGerry Wells was a self-confessed obsessive whose life was dominated by his fascination with radio apparatus.\n\nBy the time of his death he had amassed a collection of more than 1,300 radio and television sets and associated equipment, covering the entire pre-transistor history of broadcasting. This had become the British Vintage Wireless and Television Museum, and today it occupies his lifelong home, a substantial Edwardian house in Dulwich, south-east London. The collection contains many working examples, most of them found and brought back to life by Wells himself. Visitors can have the unique and somewhat unsettling experience of watching live television programmes in the old 405-line, black-and-white format, abandoned in 1984. more....\n\nhttp://bvwm.org.uk/\n\nPauline Yates, stage and screen actor, has died aged 85(21 January 2015)\n\nPauline Yates was a spirit of domestic calm when she played his wife in the mayhem led by Leonard Rossiter as the erratic Reggie Perrin, whose bizarre behaviour she treated as normal and in need of no explanation.\n\nYatess looks and ability to learn lines quickly, a trick perfected during her years in rep, made her a popular choice for TV casting directors. In 1957 she appeared in one of the first hospital soap operas, ITVs Emergency Ward 10, and she appeared in the BBC police series Z Cars and Softly Softly, and, on a number of occasions, in ITVs Armchair Theatre, for which her husband Donald Churchill wrote several plays.\n\nYatess career path was almost like a route map through British TV comedy in the 70s and 80s. She was a consummate comic foil, appearing in The Ronnie Barker Playhouse on ITV in 1968, but also taking on central roles as the Tory MP in the BBCs My Honourable Mrs (1975), opposite Derek Nimmo, and the divorcee finding a new life after marriage in Thames TVs Harriets Back in Town (1972). more....\n\nLotte Hass, model and undersea film-maker, has died aged 86 (14 January 2015)\n\nLotte Hass was an underwater photographer and model who, with her husband Hans, produced pioneering films of the sea depths during the 1950s.\n\nShot on early watertight cameras, the Hasses footage offered viewers a glimpse of an underwater world unparalleled in its intimacy  at considerable personal risk to Lotte, who dived using a lightweight rebreather and a fashionable swimsuit that afforded her little protection from aquatic predators.\n\nThe couples commercial success allowed Hass to purchase a 170-foot hull, the Xarifa, and Lotte accompanied him on expeditions to the Caribbean and Galapagos islands, where they shot Under the Caribbean (1953).\n\nDiving To Adventure, the couples 1956 BBC series, was the first of its kind for British television, proving a great hit with critics and viewers alike. more....\n\nRonnie Ronalde, artiste famous for his whistling and yodelling, had died aged 91 (13 January 2015)\n\nIn 1950 the EMI record producer Norman Newell was in a pub on the Edgware Road when Ronalde performed \"If I Were A Blackbird\" on the radio. As the customers were silent as he performed, Newell realised that this could be a hit record. That and \"In A Monastery Garden\" became best-selling records and favourites on the BBC programme Housewives' Choice.\n\nHe recorded the songs of the day, singing and whistling his way through \"Hair Of Gold, Eyes Of Blue\" and \"Mocking Bird Hill\". He discussed bird song with the ornithologist Percy Edwards and when he recorded \"Ballad Of Davy Crockett\" he made sure that his choice of birds was right for the area. He could mimic flutes and violins, while his version of \"I Believe\" highlighted his commanding tenor voice.\n\nRonalde was a major attraction and audiences marvelled at his lightning-fast versions of \"Tritsch Tratsch Polka\" and \"Can-Can\". He hosted variety series for the BBC and ITV, but in the late 1950s there was a decline in variety acts and he was seen as an anachronism. more....\n\nRoberta Leigh, Children's author and puppeteer, has died aged 87(27 December 2014)\n\nRoberta Leigh wrote romantic novels and childrens stories under a variety of noms de plume and in the 1960s was successful as a creator and producer of popular puppet series on ITV.\n\nAfter the publication of her first romantic novel, In Name Only, by Harlequin books in 1950, Roberta Leigh published more than 10 novels over the next decade and branched out into childrens writing, magazines, newspaper columns and television.\n\nRoberta Leigh began her television career with The Adventures of Twizzle in 1957, which was turned into her first childrens book in 1960. She created, produced, scripted, and wrote the music and lyrics for the puppet series (and then for a further seven puppet film series), all shown on ITV.\n\nAs well as Sara and Hoppity (1962-63), a 50-episode television series about a little girl and her mischievous doll with one leg shorter than the other and Space Patrol (1963, Planet Patrol in America), a 39-episode science fiction series incorporating elements of Gerry Andersons Supermarionation techniques, these included Torchy the Battery Boy; Wonder Boy and Tiger; Send for Dithers; and Picture the Word (52 animations for a Fun to Learn series).\n\nTo make the films, she acquired the Soho-based National Interest Pictures and a second film studio in Harlesden, becoming the first woman producer in Britain to have her own film company. more....\n\nJohn Freeman, Soldier, MP, diplomat and broadcaster best known for his series of interviews, Face to Face, has died aged 99(20 December 2014)\n\nJohn Freeman was offered work by the BBC, first as a freelance current affairs reporter on Panorama, then on Press Conference, a political discussion programme. On Panorama he conducted a merciless interview with Frank Foulkes, the Communist President of the Electrical Trades Union, who had been accused of rigging the union ballot.\n\nCross-examination was his forte  a skill he may have acquired from his father. It reached its flowering in Face to Face, a series that began in 1959. Until then, there had been few instances of the hard-hitting, confrontational TV interview. Public figures were given a fairly easy ride by broadcasters, with any hint of potential embarrassment scrupulously avoided.\n\nFreeman recognised that provocation would generally draw out more truth from interviewees than politeness. Sitting with the back of his head towards the camera, and with the victims face in close-up, he turned the programmes into gladiatorial contests. In an unemotional, forensic style, he would nag away at any weaknesses he perceived in his subjects defences. In one notorious programme, the game show panellist Gilbert Harding was reduced to tears during a relentless interrogation about his family history. The series was immensely popular and in 1960 Freeman was named television personality of the year. more....\n\nRex Firkin, television producer, has died aged 88(7 December 2014)\n\nThe producer and director Rex Firkin described himself as being \"in the engine room of commercial television\" at its inception in Britain. Starting in 1955, when Lew Grade's ATV opened, he spent more than 30 years at ITV, made some of its biggest popular and critical successes and brought others to the screen himself after becoming head of drama at LWT.\n\nIn 1953, Firkin looked for work in television, but a string of job applications to the BBC were rejected. A meeting with Norman Collins, who became a founder of ATV, led to his becoming a trainee programme director in 1955 when the commercial channel opened. His first work was directing The Adventures of Noddy, Theatre Club, the live drama serial One Family and the advertising magazine Home with Joy Shelton.\n\nHe directed (1957-60), then produced (1959-60), Emergency  Ward 10, television's first occupational soap, following the lives of doctors and nurses at the fictional Oxbridge General Hospital. It was watched by up to 24 million viewers and won a 1957 Society of Film and Television Arts Merit Award.\n\nWhile continuing to direct occasionally, he spent the next quarter of a century as a producer. He began with the Ward 10 spin-off Call Oxbridge 2000 (1961-62), then made the second and third series (1961) of the newspaper drama Deadline Midnight and the final run (1962) of Probation Officer.\n\nAs a producer, Firkin then created, with Wilfred Greatorex, another drama set in the workplace. Against the wishes of ATV's casting department he hired Patrick Wymark to star in The Plane Makers (1963-5) as the bullying aircraft factory boss John Wilder, locked in battles with unions on the shop floor and management in the boardroom. more....\n\nCherry Wainer, pianist hailed as the female Liberace, has died aged 78(14 November 2014)\n\nWainer first appeared on ITVs Lunch Box, the lightest of light entertainment shows.\n\nIt was through one such appearance that along with her future husband, Don Storer a highly paid jobbing drummer, she came to the attention of Jack Good, who had been commissioned to produce the first series of Oh Boy!\n\nDuring live broadcasts of Oh Boy! on ITV in the late 1950s, screams became cheers for Cherry Wainer, seated at an upholstered Hammond organ as part of the programmes house band, Lord Rockinghams XI.\n\nJack Good also brokered a recording contract for Wainer. Her output was to include Money (1960), historically the first Tamla-Motown number to be covered in the UK.\n\nWhile chart entries proved elusive for Wainer in her own right, a maiden Rockingham single, Fried Onions, made the US Hot 100. Hoots Mon, the follow-up, was a domestic No 1  and was heard on a section of Oh Boy! featured in the 1959 Royal Command Performance. Wainer became the focal point of the band  publicised as the female Liberace  with solo spots as both a singer and instrumentalist.\n\nAfter the final edition of Oh Boy! in 1959, Wainer went on to star in another ITV series, Boy Meets Girls, which was aimed at a wider audience. more....\n\nAngus Lennie, actor, has died aged 84(14 September 2014)\n\nOn television, he was in Armchair Theatre, \"The Mortimer Touch\" (ABC, 1957), during its earlier, less adventurous period, in this case a stage play by Eric Linklater. By contrast, Lennie appeared in Mario (BBC, 1959), for the experimental drama movement the Langham Group, employing montages and still photography in adapting a short story by Thomas Mann. More in character was Para Handy  Master Mariner (BBC, 1959-60), as Sunny Jim, deckhand on the Vital Spark, commandeered by lean, craggy-faced Duncan Macrae in the title role.\n\nAfter The Great Escape, Lennie stayed in RAF uniform for 633 Squadron (1964), chiefly remembered for Ron Goodwin's stirring score, and was directed by Attenborough in the panoramic Oh! What A Lovely War (1969). more....\n\nSir Donald Sinden, actor, has died aged 90(12 September 2014)\n\nDonald Sinden joined the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford-on-Avon for the 1946-47 season. In October 1947 he made his West End debut as Aumerle in Richard II, and in 1948 joined the Bristol Old Vic. He left Bristol to appear as Arthur Townsend in The Heiress, an adaptation of Henry Jamess Washington Square. Sinden had nine lines and appeared in all 644 performances of the show.\n\nDuring the 1950s, he immersed himself in cinema work, appearing in more than 20 films, including The Cruel Sea (1953), in which he shared top-billing with Jack Hawkins, and Mogambo (1954), a huge safari epic in which Sinden received fourth billing after Clark Gable, Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly, as Kellys cuckolded gorilla-hunting husband.\n\nAfter playing Tony Benskin, a womanising medical student in Doctor in the House (1954), Sinden began to find himself being typecast in comic roles. He played Benskin and characters like him for the next eight years.\n\nWhen the British film industry began to falter in the early Sixties, Sindens film career ended.\n\nSinden went on to make a name for himself as a comedian and farceur. He appeared as Robert Danvers in Theres a Girl in My Soup at the Aldwych in 1966, and won Best Actor awards for his appearances in the Ray Cooney farces Not Now, Darling (1967), Two into One (1984) and Out of Order (1990). In 1976 he was nominated for a Best Actor Tony Award for his performance on Broadway as Arthur Wicksteed in Alan Bennetts Habeas Corpus. more....\n\nBill Kerr, Australian actor, has died aged 92 (30 August 2014)\n\nBill Kerr made his name on the radio in Britain in the 1950s, becoming particularly well-known for his role (alongside Sid James and Hattie Jacques) as one of Tony Hancocks three cronies in Hancocks Half Hour.\n\nBut Kerr was also a character actor of distinction, giving memorable performances as a racketeer in My Death is a Mockery (1952); as the bomber pilot Micky Martin in The Dam Busters (1955); and as a mentally disturbed crook in Port of Escape (1956), co-starring Googie Withers and Joan Hickson. His other films of this period included Appointment in London (1952), You Know What Sailors Are (1954) and The Night My Number Came Up (1955).\n\nIn 1954 he joined Hancocks Half Hour, which ran on the radio for six series and later moved on to television. As Hancocks Australian lodger at the dilapidated 23 Railway Cuttings, East Cheam, Kerr appeared as the gormless, slow-on-the-uptake butt of his landlords humour. The role made Kerr a household name in Britain, and he later resumed his partnership with Sid James in the first series of the television comedy Citizen James (1960). more....\n\nLord Attenborough, actor and director, has died aged 90(24 August 2014)\n\nRichard Attenborough was one of the pillars of British cinema, originally as an actor and subsequently as an Oscar-winning director; his 1982 biopic, Gandhi, won best film of the year in the annual Academy Awards, Attenborough himself being named best director and Ben Kingsley best actor in the title role.\n\nHaving first made his name on screen in his student days, playing a Navy stoker, terrified under fire, in the war film In Which We Serve (1942), Richard Attenborough was just 24 years old at the time of filming his standout role as Pinkie Brown, the adolescent gangster of Brighton Rock.\n\nIn later years his own warmth of personality came to the fore, and with Jurassic Park (1993) he endeared himself to a whole new generation of fans, playing an avuncular professor whose naivety almost proves fatal when things go awry at his dinosaur-filled island theme park.\n\nBut it was Gandhi that was the apex of Richard Attenboroughs career and displayed a facility, unsuspected in his acting days, for handling large casts and epic, sweeping narratives. more....\n\nJuno Alexander, actress, broadcaster and local politician, has died aged 88(2 August 2014)\n\nJuno Alexander was the older sister of the Conservative politician Lord St John of Fawsley (Norman St John Stevas) and the first wife of the actor Terence Alexander; she made a name in her own right as an actress, broadcaster and local politician - and as a woman of idiosyncrasy and verve.\n\nDuring the war she joined the Free French and worked with the Resistance; later she served as a Conservative councillor on Richmond council, south-west London.\n\nFrom the late 1940s to the 1960s, Juno Alexander made frequent appearances on television, in programmes such as The Alfred Marks Show, The Max Miller Show and The Eamonn Andrews Show. After the births of her children, she did less work, but still had small parts in films and in television series, among them Compact and Garry Halliday (a precursor to Dr Who in which she appeared with her husband as his air stewardess girlfriend), and also appeared in series such as Harpers West One (1961) and Love Story (1963), She also appeared on television and radio panel shows including Petticoat Line, with Anona Wynn, Just A Minute and Going for a Song. more....\n\nNeal Arden, actor and one of the voices behind Housewives Choice, has died aged 104 (1 August 2014)\n\nNeal Arden was for more than 20 years one of Britains favourite presenters on Housewives Choice, the popular record request programme broadcast every morning, six days a week, from 1946 to 1967 on the BBC Light Programme.\n\nIn a long and varied career in theatre, film, radio and television, Arden worked with many of the leading stars of their day, from Richard Tauber, Leslie Henson, Trevor Howard and Dulcie Gray to Roger Moore, Harry Secombe, Prunella Scales, Donald Sinden and Doris Day. He was an assiduous fundraiser for charity and, as an actor, took numerous supporting roles both on stage and in television series such as Maigret, Ivanhoe, Z Cars, Dixon of Dock Green and I, Claudius. He also wrote songs, plays and film and television scripts.\n\nHe made his screen debut in the 1934 film Princess Charming. Other film credits over the years included the wartime anti-Nazi thriller Pimpernel Smith (1941); John Wesley (1954); and The Shakedown (1960). His most substantial role was in Norman Walkers Life of St Paul (1938), in which he played the saint from beardless youth to bewhiskered old age.\n\nHis early theatrical credits included Toad of Toad Hall (Royalty, 1933); Blossom Time (1942, with Richard Tauber, Lyric); Night of the Garter (Strand, 1942); and The Lilac Domino (His Majestys, 1944).\n\nIn the 1950s Arden wrote many scripts for the new Independent Television and record reviews for newspapers and magazines. more....\n\nDora Bryan, actress and comedienne, has died aged 91(23 July 2014)\n\nDora Bryan was one of Britains most versatile performers; she was at home in revues, restoration comedies and musicals and equally comfortable in dramatic roles, most notably in the film A Taste of Honey (1961), in which she played Rita Tushinghams slatternly mother and for which she won a Bafta award for best actress.\n\nWith her tiny frame, round, friendly and mobile face, her warm-hearted grin and Lancashire gurgle, Dora Bryan had the gift of appealing to every audience as soon as she appeared. To all her work she was able to bring a breezily adaptable and engaging personality.\n\nShe starred in several television series designed to showcase her talents, including Our Dora (1968), According to Dora (1968) and Dora (1972), in all of which she played various hapless, apparently simple-minded characters.\n\nDora Bryan made her screen debut in the late Forties, appearing in a variety of films, including Odd Man Out (1947), The Fallen Idol (1948) and in The Cure for Love (1949), in which she co-starred with Robert Donat. Her versatility was demonstrated by her taking roles in films as diverse as the old-fashioned police thriller The Blue Lamp (1950) and the madcap comedy Mad About Men (1954). more....\n\nJames Garner, actor and producer, has died aged 86(20 July 2014)\n\nJames Garner made his reputation in the late 1950s as the shrewd, anti-heroic gambler Bret Maverick in the iconoclastic Western series of the same name  and sealed it as the 1970s private investigator Jim Rockford in The Rockford Files.\n\nIn 1955, Warner Brothers hired him for small roles in Cheyenne, one of the western series infesting television, and advanced him to Marlon Brando's buddy in the movie Sayonara (1957).\n\nThen, after appearing in Towards the Unknown in 1957, Garner was offered the lead in a new television Western series, Maverick. He accepted because he was eager to play characters that upset traditional models: At that time all cowboys were tough and spent their time shooting one another. Maverick was different because he avoided trouble wherever possible. He hardly shot anyone and he was always on the look-out for a fast buck. The series was an immediate success and prompted one critic to claim that James Garner defined 'cool for a whole generation.\n\n\"We nearly killed the cowboy shows,\" said Garner. \"It was hard after Maverick to see those guys go around being brave without laughing.\" Maverick was the hottest show from 1957 to 1959; it reinforced ABC when the network was struggling, and won a 1959 Emmy. more ....\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10978889/James-Garner-obituary.html\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jul/20/james-garner\n\nFrank Mumford, master marionettist, has died aged 95(13 July 2014)\n\nFrank Mumford, who has died aged 95, was a master of marionettes whose career in variety spanned eight decades.\n\nAfter the Second World War, he and his wife, Maisie, created a speciality act featuring 2ft-tall puppets with large heads and scaled-down bodies. Their line-up included hippos, skating cats, skeletons, dancers , a matador and bull  and their most famous creation, Mademoiselle Zizi, a diminutive chanteuse based on Lana Turner and Gypsy Rose Lee.\n\nThe Mumfords played top London nightspots - including the Coconut Grove, Grosvenor House, Ciros, the Embassy and the Dorchester - and variety shows and cabarets around the world .\n\nThe Mumfords made many television appearances in Britain, working at Alexandra Palace in the early days of childrens television . Mumford carved the early versions of the Watch with Mother puppet character Andy Pandy and also featured in Time for Tich (1963-4) alongside the ventriloquist Ray Alans dummy Tich and his pet duck Quackers.\n\nMumfords last public appearance was in 2004 - 72 years after he had first appeared on stage with his creations aged 14. more....\n\nDickie Jones, child star of cowboy films and rodeos, has died aged 87(9 July 2014)\n\nRichard 'Dickie' Jones hit the big time - aged 13 - when he voiced Pinocchio for Disneys 1940 classic animated feature film.\n\nJones excelled as the voice of the mischievous marionette whose dreams of becoming a real boy are hampered by a propensity for telling tall tales - until, that is, his nose points him in the right direction.\n\nJones began working at rodeos at the age of six, billed as The Worlds Youngest Trick rider and Roper. He was soon discovered by Hoot Gibson, an actor and rodeo champion. Film work followed. He played opposite Al Jolson in Wonder Bar (1934) and James Stewart in Mr Smith Goes to Washington and Destry Rides Again (both 1939).\n\nIn the Forties and Fifties he appeared in a series of film and television westerns (including a number of Gene Autry features). He had his own short-lived series, Buffalo Bill Jr, from 1955 to 1956. He also starred as sidekick Dick West in The Range Rider western series alongside Jock Mahoney. more....\n\nFrancis Matthews, glamorous star of the BBC's Paul Temple and voice of Captain Scarlet, has died aged 86(14 June 2014)\n\nFrancis Matthews' television debut, for the BBC in its single-channel days, was in Prelude to Glory (1954). For Durbridge, he first did My Friend Charles (1956), as a seemingly affable fellow revealed in the last episode to be a drug-dealing villain.\n\nTall, slender and with a quietly amused expression, Francis Matthews was ideally suited to play Francis Durbridge's gentleman sleuth Paul Temple, in the popular television adaptations of the 1960s and 70s. But his 60-year career also spanned horror films, comedy and modern classics, and as the voice of Captain Scarlet he reached a new generation of admirers.\n\nMatthews's first film was the Raj tale Bhowani Junction (1956). His clean-cut qualities were also at work in several horror movies. He was an eager assistant to Peter Cushing in Hammer's The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958), then played Boris Karloff's son in Corridors of Blood (1958), with Christopher Lee. Matthews grappled with Lee, on the same sets, in Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1965) and Rasputin the Mad Monk (1966).\n\nPaul Temple, which started in 1969 and ran for 64 episodes, was one of BBC1's first colour series. It enabled extensive film sequences and overseas locations, the glamour of which transferred to Matthews and his co-star Ros Drinkwater, playing his wife, Steve. The couple appeared almost impossibly elegant to television audiences of the day, George Sewell as their down-at-heel sidekick helping to underline their suavity.\n\nOverhearing an interview in which Matthews did a jokey impression of Cary Grant, the producer Gerry Anderson cast him in his puppet saga Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons (ATV, 1967-68). more....\n\nJoy Laurey, puppet maker and puppeteer, has died aged 90 (2nd June 2014)\n\nJoy Laurey was born the great grand daughter of the famous Drury Lane clown Sam Laurey.\n\nShe started her professional career with E.N.S.A. during the Second World War with her sister and mother making up the Laurey Puppet Company. They entertained troops with puppet shows up and down the country in a wide variety of locations from Balloon sites on the mainland, to H.M.S. Bulldog at the time of the official announcement that it had liberated Guernsey.\n\nAt the end of the war, Joy continued entertaining with puppets, although concentrating the focus on children's entertainment, performing regularly at such venues as the Lord Mayor's Children's Party held at the Mansion House London, appearing with the Laurey Puppet Company regularly for summer seasons at seaside resorts, and representing Britain in puppet festivals in countries such as Rumania.\n\nDuring the early 50's Joy Laurey was offered an opportunity to make a puppet character for a one-off television show called \"Whirligig\". She made a puppet based on a vegetable, and it was named \"Mr Turnip\". The pilot show proved so successful that it went on to run for over 6 years and Mr Turnip was one of the very first television puppets ever to become a celebrity in his own right. Mr Turnip was so popular in his day that there was great demand for Mr Turnip toys, dolls, games and even toiletries such as Mr Turnip soap. Cardboard cut outs were printed on the back of cereal boxes and even fleecy material was printed with Mr Turnip on it for making children's pyjamas. The programme \"Whirligig\" was the first \"magazine\" type children's programme ever to be produced by the B.B.C. and featured appearances from many famous names such as: Humphrey Lestocq, Steve Race, Peter Butterworth, Francis Coudrill with his puppet \"Hank\", and Rolf Harris. more....\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/11/joy-laurey\n\nhttp://www.gerryanderson.co.uk/joy-laurey-puppeteer-1924-2014/\n\nhttp://bearalley.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/joy-laurey.html\n\nhttp://www.essexcountystandard.co.uk/news/11262630.Creator_of_Whirligig_s_Mr_Turnip__Ardleigh_s_Joy_Laurey_died_aged_90/\n\nSir Jack Brabham, World champion racing driver and constructor, has died aged 88 (19 May 2014)\n\nJack Brabham was three-time Formula One World Champion Driver and two-time Formula One World Champion Constructor, becoming the first driver to win the title in a car of his own making.\n\nBlack Jack Brabham, an Australian, proved that the pre-requisites of the racing star  quick judgment, lightning reflexes and exuberant dash  are not exclusive to youth. He was past 30 when he started to race Formula One cars, making his debut at the British Grand Prix in 1955 at Aintree, driving a Cooper that he had built himself, before returning home where he won the Australian Grand Prix. The next season, he was signed by John Cooper for his Cooper Car Company team.\n\nOver the next few years, Brabham shone in minor formula races while gradually gaining experience in Formula One. He won his first three World Championship points in 1958, and then at the start of the 1959 season won the Monaco Grand Prix in a works Cooper car, setting a new course record. He followed this with a second place in Holland, a third in France and Italy, and victory in the British Grand Prix.\n\nHe was in his 34th year when, in 1959, he first won the World Championship. When, the next year, he won the World Championship again, he told his family that he might give the sport a further two years. However, he was still racing as hard as ever, and successfully, after becoming World Champion for a third time in 1966, when he had turned 40. more....\n\nEli Woods, comedian who was a stuttering stooge to the great Jimmy James, has died aged 91(16 May 2014)\n\nEli Woods was one of the last links to the great era of twice-nightly British variety theatre. A stooped and gangling figure with a long, lugubrious face and permanently gaping mouth, clad in flapping trousers, too-tight jacket and deerstalker hat, he had a stammer which he exaggerated to tremendous comic effect. Woods spent his early career as a stooge for his uncle, Jimmy James, the innovative music-hall comedian who eschewed traditional jokes in favour of elaborate and surreal flights of fancy and was revered in the business as \"the comedian's comedian\".\n\nJimmy James, a Northumberland comedian, was renowned for his drunk routines  \"The Spare Room\", \"His First Night\", \"Sober as a Judge\". The most enduring was \"In the Box\": James was the vaguely inebriated gent who falls into conversation with two idiots named Hutton Conyers and Bretton Woods. The lanky Woods, inhabiting a suit that had long ago parted company with sartorial logic, would stand next to James as though in a stupor, jaw agape, struggling to follow a bizarre exchange about the contents of a shoe box.\n\n\"In the Box\" evolved through several changes of personnel. Jimmy James' real surname was Casey, and it was his nephew James (Jack) Casey who became the definitive Bretton (later Eli) Woods. From 1948 the young Casey was employed as James' driver, until they arrived in Preston to find that one of the stooges would not be able to make the performance. Casey became Woods, and was persuaded to stay.\n\nHutton Conyers was first played by James' brother-in-law Jack Darby, later by Dick Carlton, and for three years (1956-59) by Roy Castle, who had temporarily abandoned his own act to perfect his comic timing under the acknowledged master. more....\n\nEfrem Zimbalist, star of 77 Sunset Strip, has died aged 95 (2 May 2014)\n\nEfrem Zimbalist played leading roles in two of American televisions most celebrated crime dramas, 77 Sunset Strip (1958-64) and The FBI (1965-74).\n\nThe first of these featured a pair of former government agents (Zimbalist as Stu Bailey, Roger Smith as Jeff Spencer) who set up as private detectives with an office on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. They were assisted in their investigations by Kookie (played by Edd Byrnes), a hip car-parking valet. Introduced by a catchy theme song, the series had a breezy, light-hearted edge that prefigured similar television dramas that would become popular throughout the Sixties.\n\nDuring summer breaks between 77 Sunset Strip and The FBI, Warner Bros cast Zimbalist in several feature films, including Too Much Too Soon, Home Before Dark, The Crowded Sky, The Chapman Report and Wait Until Dark (in which he appeared alongside Audrey Hepburn). His other films included By Love Possessed and Airport 1975. In the 1990s he recorded the voice of Alfred, the butler, in the cartoon Batman series. more....\n\nSir Christopher Chataway, record-breaking athlete, broadcaster and government minister, has died aged 82(19 January 2014)\n\nIn the 1952 Helsinki Olympics he tripped going for the lead in the 5,000 metres, recovering to finish fifth, 12 seconds behind Emil Zatopek. In his last year at Oxford, in the Varsity match, he cut his best for the mile to 4 mins 8.4 sec, then the third fastest by a Briton. In May 1953 Bannister set his record of 4 mins 3.6 sec, paced by Chataway.\n\nFor Chataway, the bridge from athletics to politics was television. Chataway joined ITN two months before ITV went live. The reader of ITNs first bulletin on October 11 1955, he was one of a cluster of contemporaries who became household names: Robin Day (with whom he shared ITNs debut), Ludovic Kennedy and Geoffrey Johnson Smith. He excelled, but wanted to do more reporting  and in 1956 he moved to the BBC as an interviewer with Panorama.\n\nAfter winning the June 1970 election, Heath made Chataway, not yet 40, Minister for Posts and Telecommunications. He came under immediate pressure from Mary Whitehouse to \"clean up\" programmes, and from colleagues to stop jamming pirate stations such as Radio Caroline and to legalise commercial radio. Setting up commercial radio as Minister for Posts and Telecommunications, he spent 12 years with the medium as chairman of LBC. more....\n\nGeoffrey Wheeler, presenter of Songs of Praise and Top of the Form, has died aged 83(2 January 2014)\n\nGeoffrey Wheeler began making radio programmes for the BBC while studying Law at Manchester University and in 1954 was appointed the Corporations radio producer for the northern region.\n\nHe cut his teeth on variety shows, working with such entertainers as Ken Dodd, Benny Hill and Morcambe and Wise.\n\nAs the smartly-blazered, avuncular question master on Top of the Form from the early 1960s to 1975, Wheeler earned a place in the cultural hinterland of a generation of vaguely bookish, mostly middle-class, viewers of the sort who now do sterling service as members of pub quiz teams.\n\nThe show began in 1948 on the BBCs Light Programme and Wheeler joined as co-question master with Paddy Feeny. Each would present his half of the show from a different school hall, the two being connected by a then state-of-the  art (for the BBC) landline.\n\nIn 1962 the show transferred to television, slimmed down to a single location and with Wheeler as its sole presenter.\n\nWheeler went freelance in 1963 and as well as presenting Top of the Form, appeared as a panellist on Call my Bluff, as a story teller on Jackanory, and spent 21 years as a regular presenter of Songs of Praise, now the worlds longest-running television religious programme. more....\n\nDavid Coleman, Sports |Commentator, has died aged 87(21 December 2013)\n\nDavid Coleman was the face and voice of BBC Television sport for 40 years, the anchorman for the flagship Grandstand programme on Saturday afternoons and later the affable host of the popular quiz A Question Of Sport.\n\nIn 1953 he started freelance radio work in Manchester and the following year joined the BBC in Birmingham as a news assistant. Having made his first television broadcast on Sportsview in May 1954 on the day Roger Bannister became the first runner to break the four-minute mile, Coleman was appointed sports editor, Midland Region, in November 1955. After the editor of Sportsview, Paul Fox, had seen him interview the footballer Danny Blanchflower on regional television, Coleman transferred to London. In 1958 the BBCs Head of Sport, Peter Dimmock, offered Coleman the frontmans job on the new sports magazine programme, Grandstand.\n\nHe made his name on the programme where his ad libs and mastery of football trivia standing alongside the teleprinter as the football results came in revealed remarkably acute and detailed research. But he became frustrated by being always studio-bound and yearned for a new challenge. In 1967, however, after repeated wooing by ITV, he signed a new seven-year BBC contract at £10,000 a year, making him the highest-paid broadcaster in television sport. more....\n\nJean Kent, actress, has died aged 92(1 December 2013)\n\nJean Kent adopted a variety of stage names. At different times she was Peggy Summers and Jean Carr, finally adopting the name Jean Kent in 1943 in Its That Man Again, a film version of the popular radio show ITMA, starring Tommy Handley.\n\nHer big break came when she was hired as a dancer and understudy in the Max Miller show Apple Sauce (1941) at the Palladium. During rehearsals one of the leading ladies was sacked and Jean was asked to replace her at short notice. She was then spotted by Weston Drury, casting director at Shepherds Bush studios, and signed to a contract with Gainsborough Pictures.\n\nShe landed her first leading role, in Caravan (1946). In the interim, she had played supporting parts in such pictures as Champagne Charlie (1944), a Tommy Trinder musical about the heyday of music hall, Madonna of the Seven Moons (1944) and The Wicked Lady (1945).\n\nThrough much of the Fifties, Jean Kent concentrated on the theatre, appearing in plays and pantomimes (notably a Prince Charming in Cinderella) for which she had hitherto had little time.\n\nIn later years she was seen more frequently in television. She played Good Queen Bess in a 1962 series based on the life of Sir Francis Drake and subsequently appeared in such long-running series as Emergency Ward 10, Up Pompeii, Crossroads, Lovejoy and Shrinks. more....\n\nStan Stennett, comedian, actor and pantomime veteran, has died aged 88(26 November 2013)\n\nWith his doleful face, good-natured smile and ever-gleaming teeth, the stalwart entertainer Stan Stennett was a favourite in pantomimes and seaside shows around the UK for decades. After starting out as a musician, he found success at the BBC, cracking jokes on the radio series Welsh Rarebit and compering The Black and White Minstrel Show on television in the 1960s.\n\nStennett's period with The Black and White Minstrel Show did not endear him to the younger and more politically correct generation of TV comedy producers who later took charge. Stennett argued that when the clever satirists took over, audiences tended to stay away. He revered comedians such as \"Laurel and Hardy, Mack Sennett, Buster Keaton  these were the gods We are trying feebly to imitate these people.\" more....\n\nJack Alexander, singer and musician, has died aged 77(13 November 2013)\n\nJack Alexander was the singer and pianist with the Alexander Brothers, the duo he formed with his elder brother Tom. They were two of Scotlands best-loved entertainers, and during a career lasting five decades they toured the world with their versions of traditional Scottish songs, releasing more than 50 albums.\n\nTheir big break came in 1962, when the songwriter and producer Tony Hatch saw them perform at the Metropolitan Theatre, Edgware, and suggested that they record an album. Hatch, who had begun his career working with Petula Clark, immediately understood the potential for an act playing traditional Scottish tunes.\n\nTheir first album, Highland Fling, was recorded in London, and included favourites such as A Scottish Soldier and Scotland the Brave, becoming an enormous success. They followed the success of Highland Fling with the single Nobodys Child, which topped the charts in Scotland in 1964, outselling the Beatles that year.\n\nThe following year, inspired by the reception of the single, Andy Stewart invited the brothers to tour with him in Canada and the US. They performed alongside Shirley Bassey on the television variety show Sunday Night at the London Palladium and by 1965 had been given their own show on STV and had become a mainstay of The White Heather Club, the yearly televised Hogmanay celebrations. more....\n\nGraham Stark, actor who was frequently cast in supporting roles in comedy films starring his close friend Peter Sellers, has died aged 91 (31 October 2013)\n\nAfter the war Stark joined the bohemian coterie frequenting the ornate Grafton Arms pub in Victoria where up-and-coming entertainers like Terry-Thomas, Jimmy Edwards, Tony Hancock, Dick Emery and Alfred Marks held court. It was in the Graftons back bar that Stark renewed an RAF friendship with Peter Sellers while Sellers and Spike Milligan experimented with material that, in 1951, would metamorphose into The Goon Show.\n\nAs well as providing madcap voices for The Goons, Stark also appeared in other popular radio shows of the day, notably Educating Archie, with the ventriloquist Peter Brough, and Rays A Laugh, starring the Liverpool comedian Ted Ray.\n\nWhenever Spike Milligan failed to turn up for a Goon Show recording, Stark would stand in for him; and when Milligan and Sellers moved into television with A Show Called Fred in 1956, Stark joined the cast.\n\nIn 1964 Stark starred in his television comedy sketch series, The Graham Stark Show, which  although written by Johnny Speight, later to create Till Death Us Do Part  proved a flop. more....\n\nSinger Joan Regan, who had chart success in the late 50s and early 60s, has died aged 85(15 September 2013)\n\nJoan Regan had a number of hit records, including Ricochet, May You Always and If I Give My Heart to You.\n\nRegan also had her own BBC television series, Be My Guest, for several years.\n\nThe singer starred on both sides of the Atlantic with artists such as Perry Como, Max Bygraves and Cliff Richard.\n\nRegan, who was born in 1928 in Romford in Essex, was one of the most popular British singers of her era and appeared regularly on radio and TV.\n\nHer career took off after theatrical impresario Bernard Delfont heard her recordings and signed her up with his agency.\n\nRegan soon won a recording contract with the British record label, Decca Records, although only for a trial period of three records, which by her own admission \"didn't exactly set the hit parade alight\".\n\nHowever, Decca released a recording she had made some months earlier of a song called Ricochet.\n\nThe record paved the way for theatre, radio and television engagements.\n\nRegan was later to feature on American television with major performers including Eddie Fisher, Tennessee Ernie Ford and Perry Como.\n\nShe appeared at the London Palladium many times, with other entertainers such as Max Bygraves, Cliff Richard, Russ Conway and Edmund Hockridge.\n\nIn 1984, she hit her head in the shower causing a blood clot on the brain which left her paralysed and without speech.\n\nBut after therapy she made a complete recovery, singing again in Britain on radio and in concerts. more....\n\nDavid Jacobs, actor and radio and TV broadcaster, has died aged 87(3 September 2013)\n\nDavid Jacobs' first acting role was as Laurie in the BBC's first TV adaptation of Little Women (1950-51). When Charles Chilton's Journey into Space proved to be a great radio hit in the 1950s, Jacobs introduced it and took 22 roles.\n\nAfter a period on Radio Luxembourg he was offered the freelance job of disc jockey on the radio programme Housewives' Choice, on which Jacobs had to play record requests and punctuate them with anodyne chat.\n\nHe was perfect for the job. It was a natural progression when he took over Juke Box Jury on TV, chairing a celebrity panel as they assessed likely chart hits  hailed with a hotel-reception-counter bell  or misses  dismissed with a hooter. At one time Jacobs seemed to be always on television whenever the on-switch was turned, with appearances on What's My Line, Top of the Pops, the Eurovision Song Contest, Come Dancing, Miss World and many more.\n\nWhen a senior BBC executive advised him that it was all too much, he reinvented himself as a player with more gravitas, to succeed Freddy Grisewood on Any Questions? Having conceded that he was \"too square for the pop scene\", Jacobs became a stalwart of Radio 2, presenting music programmes in a succession of formats right up until a few weeks before his death. more....\n\nMike Winters, straight man to his goofy-toothed brother Bernie, has died aged 82 (27 August 2013)\n\nThe brothers were pioneers of television comedy, first appearing on Britains screens in 1955 on the BBC show Variety Parade after which they moved to ITVs Sunday Night at the London Palladium, supporting Shirley Bassey.\n\nIn 1965 they won their own comedy show on ITV which ran for eight years, regularly reaching the top three in the ratings and attracting guest stars such as Tom Jones and The Beatles, who appeared on the programme three times. They did pantomimes in Cardiff, cabarets in Sheffield and summer seasons in Yarmouth where, in 1967, despite the resort also boasting Rolf Harris, Morecambe and Wise and Val Doonican, each in their own their rival shows, Mike and Bernie broke all box-office records for the season  an achievement that still stands. In 1962 the brothers starred at a Royal Variety Performance and the following year they starred with Frankie Howerd and Tommy Cooper in Michael Winners film The Cool Mikado.\n\nBut in 1978 they fell out, and Mike abandoned showbusiness and emigrated to Florida where he became a successful Miami nightclub owner, did much work for charity and wrote several books including a memoir, The Sunny Side Of Winters (2010). He eventually retired to Gloucestershire. more....\n\nJeremy Geidt, presenter of Childrens's TV Caravan in the 1950s, has died aged 83(17 August 2013)\n\nJeremy Geidt acted in London, moving to the USA in 1961 where he acted at Yale Repertory Theatre before helping to start the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He also taught at Harvard University.\n\nThe Children's Television Caravan was an Outside Broadcast unit which traversed the British Isles during the summer for five years starting in 1956. It utilised a very large vehicle which, by letting down one of its sides, formed a miniature stage on which a team made up of a compere and master of ceremonies, two clowns, a pianist, and a drummer provided continually changing entertainment. Local children, chosen for their talent, appeared in this caravan theatre as a regular part of the programme. It was compered by Jeremy Geidt with resident artists Clive Dunn (as Mr. Crumpet) and Elton Hayes.\n\nmore....\n\nAlan Whicker, interviewer and documentary maker, has died aged 87 (13 July 2013)\n\nAlan Whicker was the quintessence of the glory days of British television, the time between the late 1950s and the late 1970s when there were no more than two or three channels and any notable programme would be seen by more than half the population.\n\nHe was doing odd jobs for BBC radio when Alasdair Milne, then working for its flagship current affairs programme Tonight, spotted his ability to ask \"impertinent\" questions without giving offence.\n\nIn 1957 Whicker was invited to join the BBCs early evening magazine programme Tonight, presented by Cliff Michelmore. His first story was about Ramsgate landladies. Nine reports from Northern Ireland about the uneasy truce between Catholics and Protestants went unused after vociferous complaints about his deadpan, even-handed approach from the local BBC controller and the Bishop of Derry. From then on Whicker insisted on seeing the footage first, then writing his own commentary. The technique served him well as he looked all over the world for kinks in human character and behaviour for Whicker's World.\n\nIn the 1960s he got his own show, Whickers World, which allowed him to travel continually around the globe from Alaska to the Outback and turned him into a household name. By the 1970s Whickers World was coming top in the ratings, beating Coronation Street. He worked seven days a week, meeting luminaries such as John Paul Getty, Papa Doc Duvalier, Peter Sellers, Luciano Pavarotti, Sean Connery, Salvador Dali and the Sultan of Brunei. It was a frenetic pace, belied by the smooth, dapper and unruffled persona on screen.\n\nIn 1993 Whicker was the first to be named in the Royal Television Society's Hall of Fame for an outstanding creative contribution to British TV. A fanclub was formed, consisting of members who dressed up as Whicker and discussed their hero once a month. His singular style also gave rise in 1972 to Monty Python's celebrated Whicker Island sketch, with all of the team doing impressions.\n\nWhicker remained active into old age, continuing to make TV and radio series until recently, and publishing volumes of memoirs. He had become wealthy, with a Nash flat in Regent's Park and a handsome home in Jersey. In 2005 he was appointed CBE. more....\n\nHans Hass, marine biologist, oceanographer and zoologist, has died aged 94(25 June 2013)\n\nHans Hass was a pioneer - with his wife Lotte - of spectacular films of the sea depths, and in the mid-1950s shot the first underwater footage for the BBC.\n\nThe Hasses first BBC series, Diving To Adventure, largely filmed in the Aegean, was screened in 1956. The programmes proved hugely popular and the couple returned to the screen two years later with another series, The Undersea World of Adventure, shot in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean and the Red Sea.\n\nThe couples exploits beneath the sea, filmed on comparatively primitive cameras and broadcast in black and white, thrilled television audiences throughout the late 1950s and 1960s by opening a window on to a breathtaking and hitherto unseen world. Rivalled only by Jacques Cousteau, Hass and his wife managed - often in perilous circumstances - to capture the habits and activities of a range of deep-sea creatures including dangerous sharks, barracuda and giant manta rays.\n\nThe pictures he brought back also helped to inject the emerging sport of scuba-diving with some much-needed glamour, as did the television series Sea Hunt, launched in 1958 and starring the actor Lloyd Bridges. more....\n\nFrank Thornton, actor, has died aged 92(18 March 2013)\n\nFrank Thornton was conscripted into the air force as a navigator in 1943 and, after the end of the war, remained in the RAF entertainment unit where, among his charges, were Dick Emery, Peter Sellers and Tony Hancock.\n\nHe appeared in the Edgar Lustgarten-hosted series The Silent Witness in 1954 and, a year later, was credited in the part of Inspector Finch in the British film Radio Cab Murder.\n\nThe next 15 years saw him appearing in a wide range of small character parts in films and TV series including The Avengers and Danger Man.\n\nHe also appeared in various comedy programmes such as It's a Square World, Hancock's Half-Hour, The Benny Hill Show, Sykes and Steptoe And Son, as well as movie spin-off Steptoe And Son Ride Again.\n\nBut it was in 1972 when he took the role of the officious Captain Stephen Peacock in the comedy series, Are You Being Served? that he became known to millions. Frank Thornton played the lugubrious, disdainful and immaculately tailored Capt Peacock in the long-running BBC Television sitcom for 12 years. more....\n\nDale Robertson, Western film and TV actor, has died aged 89 (27 February 2013)\n\nDale Robertson was a skilled rider at the age of ten and training polo ponies by the time he was a teenager. He often said that the only reason he acted professionally was to save money to start his own horse farm in Oklahoma, which he eventually did.\n\nIn the movies he was a ruggedly handsome counterpart to leading ladies like Betty Grable, Mitzi Gaynor and Jeanne Crain. On television he had starring roles in popular westerns like 'Tales of Wells Fargo' which appeared from 1957 to 1961; 'Iron Horse' from 1966 to 1968; and 'Death Valley Days' which he hosted from 1968 to 1972.\n\nHe developed, owned and starred in the Wells Fargo series, playing Jim Hardie, a troubleshooter for the stagecoach company. To make the character distinctive, he had the right-handed Hardie draw his gun and shoot left-handed.\n\nWells Fargo was originally shown in black and white and in half-hour episodes. In 1961, however, the producers wanted to turn it into a full-hour show, broadcast it in color and expand the ensemble of characters. Mr. Robertson refused and sold the show to them.\n\nIn 1981 he played an oil wildcatter in early episodes of 'Dynasty'. The next year he had a recurring role in another glitzy nighttime soap opera, 'Dallas'. more....\n\nReginald Turnill, the BBCs former air and aerospace correspondent, has died aged 97(13 February 2013)\n\nTurnill covered the golden age of post-war aviation from jet power to the Space Shuttle; though he reported on the success of the first Moon landing, his most celebrated story was the scoop that Apollo 13 was in difficulties.\n\nTurnill joined the BBC in 1956. There he became assistant industry correspondent. After covering Sputnik in 1957, however, he was so enthralled with space that, in 1958, he agreed to become the corporations air and space correspondent, with a brief to cover defence. As a result he covered bombing raids over Vietnam  only to irritate the US Air Force by pointing out their inaccuracy.\n\nAs the public enthusiasm for the Moon declined after the first landing, the BBC grumbled about Turnill still wanting to go to America. But he proved his value with the Apollo 13 trip in 1970. After the astronauts safe return, there were no more demands that he remain in London, and his wife received $75 for being his editorial assistant.\n\nOn October 4 1957, Turnill was on hand to announce the starters pistol for the race to the Moon  the Soviet launch of Sputnik. He covered the space race in its entirety, travelling first to Moscow to describe Yuri Gagarins guarded press conference after the cosmonaut became the first man in orbit in 1961, and then to Cape Canaveral for Alan Shepherds account of his 15-minute sub-orbital lob.\n\nDuring the periods between launches Turnill found plenty to occupy him, notably the joint development of Concorde by Britain and France, with its mixture of scientific difficulties, national pride and astronomic costs. But it was undoubtedly the pictures beamed from the surface of the Moon in 1969 that proved the most intoxicating story of all. more....\n\nPeter Gilmore, actor and star of The Onedin Line, has died aged 81(9 February 2013)\n\nGilmore began his stage career as a vocalist, appearing with the George Mitchell Singers in summer seasons with Harry Secombe and the comedian Al Read. Between 1954 and 1956 he played in the popular Crazy Gang revue Jokers Wild (Victoria Palace). From the mid-1950s he also made television commercials in Germany, Ireland and the United States.\n\nAfter working in provincial stage productions, with occasional London dates, stardom beckoned in 1958 when he was cast as Freddy Eynsford Hill in the West End production of My Fair Lady (Theatre Royal, Drury Lane). At the last minute, however, he was replaced because he was a baritone and the score called for a tenor.\n\nHis big television break came the same year in the ITV series Ivanhoe, in which he worked with the executive producer Peter Rogers, later to develop the Carry On comedy canon. Gilmore made several appearances in Carry On films, including Carry On Jack (1963) and Carry On Cleo (1964), both of which afforded him seaborne roles, as well as Carry On Up The Khyber (1968) and Carry On Henry (1971). more....\n\nRobert Kee, writer and broadcaster, has died aged 93 (12 January 2013)\n\nRobert Kee was well known as the presenter of such programmes as Panorama, This Week, Yorkshire Televisions Various Faces of Communism, and ITNs lunchtime news programme, which he launched in 1972; he was, however, probably most famous, both as a presenter and writer, as a historian of Irish nationalism.\n\nIn 1958 Kee joined the BBC to report on the Algerian war for Panorama, helping to set new standards for television reportage. In a series of vivid on-location reports, he gave the viewers a sense of being in the thick of the action.\n\nIn 1962 he left the BBC to become one of the founders of a freelance agency, Television Reporters International. When that did not get off the ground, he accepted Jeremy Isaacss invitation to join Associated Rediffusions This Week. For the next 14 years he worked on and off for various other independent television companies, most notably, from 1972, as presenter of First Report, ITNs first lunchtime news programme, for which he won the Bafta Richard Dimbleby Award. In 1978 he returned to the BBC to work on the Ireland series. Three years later he replaced David Dimbleby as presenter of Panorama.\n\nKee specialised in strife. For television he reported on conflicts in Algeria and the Congo, as well as the Prague Spring; as a historian, he also chronicled the key years of the Second World War. His interest in the troubled history of Ireland developed in the 1950s, when he embarked on a three-volume study which eventually saw the light of day in 1972 as The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism. more....\n\nAlasdair Milne, the only Director-General of the BBC to be dismissed from office, has died aged 82 (9 January 2013)\n\nAlasdair Milne joined the BBC as a general trainee in 1954, being one of two selected from 1,110 applicants (the other was Patrick Dromgoole, later managing director of HTV).\n\nBy February 1957 he was one of the architects (later he became editor) of BBC Televisions nightly news and current affairs flagship Tonight, in charge of a team which included such future stars as Cliff Michelmore, Alan Whicker, Geoffrey Johnson Smith, Macdonald Hastings, Fyfe Robertson, Derek Hart and Kenneth Allsop. It went on air every weeknight at 6.05pm.\n\nThe vigorous, young Tonight team aimed for a new, more incisive style of interviewing that, in Milnes words, would test the ability of politicians to think on their feet. When ITV presented the Corporation with its first-ever competition, the BBCs overall audience share plunged to an all-time low of 28 per cent; Tonight, however, succeeded in maintaining its nightly viewing figure of between eight and 10 million.\n\nWhen his boss, Donald Baverstock, was promoted to Assistant Controller of Programmes, Milne took his place. Under his editorship, the programme spawned Tonight Productions, a stable which included Whicker Down Under and the memorable 26-part documentary series The Great War. more....\n\nDaphne Oxenford, Radio presenter and actress, has died aged 93(4 January 2013)\n\nKnown to millions as the voice of Listen With Mother, Daphne Oxenford would open each programme by asking: \"Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin.\"\n\nShe was also one of the original cast members of Coronation Street, playing Esther Hayes, and was a cast member of Midsomer Murders until 2008.\n\nDebuting in 1950, Listen With Mother consisted of stories, songs and nursery rhymes for children under the age of five. It began at 1:45pm every weekday, to coincide with the end of children's lunchtime meal. At its peak, it had an audience of more than a million.\n\nOxenford narrated the programme from 1950 to 1971, and her meticulously modulated opening phrase was eventually included in the Oxford dictionary of quotations.\n\nBut regular listeners will also recall the words that would precede her arrival: \"And when the music stops Daphne Oxenford will be here to tell you a story\". more....\n\nGerry Anderson, pioneer of TV puppetry, has died aged 83(26 December 2012)\n\nGerry Anderson entertained generations of British children with a string of futuristic puppet series for television in the 1960s, including Thunderbirds, Joe 90 and Fireball XL5.\n\nUntil his arrival, televised puppets ran the brief gamut from Andy Pandy to Bill and Ben. Anderson was struggling to find work until the childrens writer and animator Roberta Leigh, who was pitching ideas to ITV, asked him to make The Adventures of Twizzle, about a toy who gathers and befriends other unwanted toys.\n\nIn 1956, with his business partner Arthur Provis, he moved into film production and formed AP Films in the hope of making a classic epic  but the opportunities were not forthcoming. So, after Twizzle, the company went on to make Torchy The Battery Boy and Four Feather Falls, a Western series in which the puppets (unable to draw their guns) had to swivel their holsters to fire.\n\nThese early efforts convinced Anderson of the potential of puppet series as an entertainment form, and his 1960 series Supercar was the first successful science-fiction format to reflect the growing interest among children in futuristic technology. He followed it with the more sophisticated Fireball XL5, 26 episodes featuring the hero Steve Zodiac, and timing it to coincide with increased interest in the space race. more....\n\nChildren's television: Final broadcast on BBC One(21 December 2012)\n\nChildren's television will no longer be aired on BBC One after today with programmes moving to the dedicated CBBC digital channel.\n\nThe changes are part of BBC-wide cost cutting but investment in children's programming will remain the same.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20815625\n\nKenneth Kendall, the first BBC newsreader to appear on television, has died aged 88(14 December 2012)\n\nKenneth Kendall's long association with the BBC began in 1948, when he became an announcer on the Home Service. He transferred to Television News in 1954, presenting with Richard Baker.\n\nAt first the newsreader did not appear in vision, for fear that facial expressions would suggest that he had opinions of his own. Instead briefings were read over a series of still images and maps. Only in 1955, with the imminent launch of ITN promising a less formal news service, did the BBC decide to take a risk; Kendall became the first \"in-vision\" newsreader, broadcasting from Alexandra Palace on September 4.\n\nHe stayed with BBC News on and off for three decades, gaining a reputation for his immaculate appearance, clear diction and unflappability.\n\nIn the end, however, his firm adherence to Reithian values led to clashes with his producers, and in 1981 he left the BBC, three years before he was due to retire, complaining about the sloppily written and ungrammatical stories he was expected to broadcast. more....\n\nRonald Moody who played 'Hurry Ramset Jam Singh' in the '50s TV series of Billy Bunter has died aged 75(13 December 2012)\n\nRonald Moody, was born on 27th May 1936, in Calcutta, India and died in October 2011. He had a brief acting career, with the BBC at Limegrove Studios, in the early 1950s. He played an asian charactor called Puffin, in the BBC production of 'The Windmill Family' and another asian charactor called Hurry Ramset Jam Singh in the BBC production 'Billy Bunter' from 1954 to 1956. He had been discovered by producer Joy Harrington while working at the Great Eastern Hotel, London as a Bell Boy/Luggage Attendant in his late teens.\n\nOther famous people, who started their careers at Limegrove Studios, at about the same time, were Anthony Valentine, Melvyn Hayes and Cliff Richard. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1632065\n\nSir Patrick Moore, amateur astonomer and TV presenter, has died aged 89(9 December 2012)\n\nPatrick Moore did more than anyone, with the possible exception of Arthur C Clarke, to educate the British public about astronomy and space travel. A genuine eccentric who never took himself too seriously, Moore played up to his image as a mad professor, and wrote more than 100 books - most of them about astronomy for a popular audience. Meanwhile, his monthly Sky at Night programme - launched on BBC Television in April 1957 - attracted millions of viewers. Moores extended tenure made him the worlds longest-running presenter of a single television show. He became celebrated for the thunderous fervour with which he would utter the words: \"We just dont know!\" to emphasise that our comprehension of the universe is incomplete. He was noted also for his piercing gaze, the machine-gun pace of his speech, his wildly untidy hair and his oversized suits.\n\nYet there were many other sides to Moore besides astronomy. He was a connoisseur of music, and sometimes played a xylophone on television. He also wrote the score for an opera about Theseus and the Minotaur, and appeared in the chorus as a hairy-chested, armour-vested, double-breasted, great red-crested man of the Cretan guard. more....\n\nClive Dunn, actor who specialised in playing dotty old gents, has died aged 92(7 November 2012)\n\nClive Dunn, the actor, who has died aged 92, was best known as Lance-Corporal Jones, the zealous old soldier in Dads Army celebrated for the catchphrases Dont panic! and They dont like it up em!.\n\nClive made his first screen appearance  as a schoolboy extra in the film Boys Will Be Boys (1936), for the fee of a guinea and a lunch box from Lyons Caterers. His first professional stage booking came in the same year, at the Holborn Empire, in Where the Rainbow Ends, a production in which he excelled as a dancing frog.\n\nAround 1951 Dunn appeared in Buckets and Spades, the first childrens variety show on television. He sang The Galloping Major while cavorting fully padded and breeched around the Lime Grove studio to musical accompaniment.\n\nHe also appeared regularly on the live BBC show 'The Children's Television Caravan' which was a travelling variety show.\n\nAs his career gathered pace during the 1950s, Dunn worked with stars such as Peter Ustinov, Peter Sellers and Tony Hancock. He also appeared in a number of shows including Treasure Island, in which he played Ben Gunn. But it was with the anarchic Michael Bentine that Dunn was most successful, and he played in many episodes of the madcap sketch show Its a Square World, which ran from 1960 to 1964.\n\nDunn was beginning to acquire national recognition, not only for Its a Square World, but also for the part of Old Johnson in Granada Televisions Bootsie and Snudge, which starred Alfie Bass. At that stage Johnson was the most famous of Dunns repertoire of old men. more....\n\nDaphne Slater, actress who played the first television Jane Eyre has died aged 84(31 October 2012)\n\nSlater's acting talents were transposed to BBC television as it began to dramatise the English literary canon in serial form. In 1952 she played Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, with Peter Cushing as Mr Darcy (he was then considered as good casting for a dashing gentleman). Four years later, in another serialisation, she became the small screen's first Jane Eyre, in a performance brimming with passion, with Stanley Baker playing Mr Rochester.\n\nShe played Prue Sarn in Precious Bane (1957), Portia in Julius Caesar (1959) and Anne Elliot in Persuasion (1960). After retreating to small character parts on television during the 1960s, she proved a commanding presence when she finally returned to period drama as Mary Tudor in Elizabeth R (1971), well able to stand up to Glenda Jackson as her sister. more....\n\nMax Bygraves, singer and comedian, has died aged 89(1 September 2012)\n\nMax Bygraves became famous for his stage performances, notably in 19 Royal Variety Performances, and went on to lead the market in the kind of foot-tapping nostalgia which characterised his Singalongamax recordings.\n\nHe had spent the war as a fitter in the RAF, and in 1945 went to work as a carpenter in East Ham when a chance meeting with an RAF contact  outside the London Palladium  secured an appearance in the BBC variety show 'Theyre Out'.\n\nThe bandleader Jack Payne heard the programme, and this led to a spot in a new show, 'For the Fun of It', in which Bygraves starred with Donald Peers and a young Frankie Howerd. In 1950 Jack Parnell and Cissie Williams hired him as a replacement for Ted Ray at the Palladium, a role he filled so successfully that he was back in Argyll Street a few weeks later, appearing with Abbott and Costello at the theatre which was to become, for a number of years, his second home.\n\nHe gave his first Royal Variety performance in November 1950, and was invited to join the radio ventriloquist Peter Brough in 'Educating Archie', the show which \"launched\", among others, Tony Hancock; Bygraves then scriptwriter, Eric Sykes; and 14-year-old Julie Andrews, who was ousted from her singing spot when Bygraves arrived.\n\nDuring the 1950s there were numerous stage appearances in Britain, notably in 'Wonderful Time', and in 'Were Having a Ball', which also starred the Kaye Sisters and Joan Regan. Bygraves took some time off from having a ball to write You Need Hands, a song which ran for several months in the Top 20. more....\n\nAlf Pearson, singer who moved successfully from music hall and variety to radio and television, has died aged 102(7 July 2012)\n\nThe brothers Bob and Alf Pearson were one of the most popular music hall acts of the 1930s and 1940s and, after the war, they found national fame as part of Ted Ray's radio series, Ray's a Laugh. They would introduce themselves with the words, \"We bring you melodies from out of the sky, my brother and I\" and would harmonise popular songs to Bob's piano accompaniment.\n\nRecording for a variety of labels, the brothers made an impact with \"Ro, Ro, Rollin' Along\", \"Great Day\" and \"When You're Smiling\". They worked with Sir Harry Lauder and Gracie Fields and toured with both Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong. They were the first duo to appear on TV, although as Alf said, \"There were only about 400 sets in the country and the picture was the size of a cigarette card.\"\n\nIn Ted Ray's series, Bob performed as a variety of characters. Alf recalled: \"Ted would say, 'Why, it's a little girl, what's your name?' and Bob would say, 'Jennifer' and there would be a comedy routine.\" The brothers toured on the strength of Ray's a Laugh and had dolls made that they would give to girls called Jennifer.\n\nThey toured in a stage show for another radio success, Take It From Here, and had some of the biggest-selling records for Parlophone, sometimes working with a young George Martin. Their singles included \"Red Roses For a Blue Lady\", \"Careless Hands\" and a song for the Coronation, \"In a Golden Coach\". The work dried up with the advent of rock'n'roll but during the 1970s they became involved in music hall revivals. In 1985 they appeared on Highway with Harry Secombe. more....\n\nErnest Borgnine, actor who was one of Hollywoods most popular villains, has died aged 95 (9 July 2012)\n\nOnce described as having an executioners grin, he specialised in playing sadistic bullies, and is best remembered for performances such as the brutal sergeant Fatso Judson in From Here to Eternity (1953), and as an ageing outlaw in Sam Peckinpahs bloodthirsty epic The Wild Bunch (1969).\n\nIn the early 1950s Borgnine moved to Hollywood where, after several minor film roles, he gave an excellent performance as the sadistic Fatso Judson in From Here to Eternity. He followed this with another memorable appearance, as the snakelike villain in Bad Day at Black Rock (1954), taunting the one-armed Spencer Tracy.\n\nHis sensitive portrayal of a loveless butcher in Marty (1955) brought him film star status. Written by Paddy Chayefsky and directed by Delbert Mann, the film won Oscars for best actor (Borgnine), best director (Mann) and best screenplay (Chayefsky).\n\nBorgnine followed his first major success with two more leading roles. He was perhaps ill-advised in his choice of scripts, making little impact in The Best Things In Life Are Free (1956) and Wedding Breakfast (1958). The former dealt with the biographies of the songwriting trio De Sylva, Brown and Henderson; the latter (co-starring Bette Davis) told the story of a family preparing for a wedding. Later the same year he appeared (opposite Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis) as the rotund warrior Ragnar in The Vikings. more....\n\nEric Sykes, comedian, actor and scriptwriter, has died aged 89 (4 July 2012)\n\nSykes became a national figure through his long-running television partnership with Hattie Jacques. The series, entitled either plain Sykes or Sykes and a [whatever was the theme of that weeks episode], ran from 1960 to 1965 - at which point Sykes announced that he was finished with it for ever - and then from 1972 to 1979.\n\nIn 1941, four days before his 18th birthday, he joined the RAF. Trained as a wireless officer, he served on the beaches of Normandy (where the noise of the guns affected his hearing) and at the siege of Caen, and was present at the German surrender on Luneberg Heath.\n\nSykes also had the opportunity to join an entertainments section run by the actor Bill Fraser, later Snudge in the television series Bootsie and Snudge.\n\nAfter the War, Frankie Howerd invited him to provide material for the radio show Variety Bandbox. Sykes was soon working for Tony Hancock and Hattie Jacques, both of whom he met on the Educating Archie series. He was also occasionally called upon to emulate Spike Milligan as scriptwriter for The Goon Show. Nevertheless, he always longed to perform on his own account.\n\nHe directed a number of films with an emphasis on visual humour, notably The Plank (1979), with Arthur Lowe and a cameo role for Frankie Howerd, and Rhubarb (1969), which featured Harry Secombe, Jimmy Edwards and Hattie Jacques.\n\nSykes had long acted in the cinema, and was especially good as a gipsy in Heavens Above (1963) and as Terry-Thomass factotum in Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965). His other film credits included The Bargee (1963), One-Way Pendulum (1964), Rotten to the Core (1965), Shalako (1968), Monte Carlo or Bust (1969) and The Boys in Blue (1983). more....tribute....\n\nJean Morton, known as Auntie Jean to fans of the popular 1960s ITV childrens programme Tingha and Tucker, has died aged 91(26 May 2012)\n\nJean Morton was a British television announcer. She served as continuity announcer from the launch of the original Midlands regional independent television station, ATV. She was one of four original announcers, the others being Arthur Adair, Peter Cockburn and Shaw Taylor.\n\nFor a generation of children Jean Morton was simply Auntie Jean of the popular ITV childrens programme Tingha and Tucker.\n\nThe launch of Tingha and Tucker, which brought her national fame, happened by chance after a viewer sent in two toy koala bears which appeared on screen as a time-filler between programmes.\n\nThe instant response saw Australian producer Reg Watson, who went onto create soap opera Neighbours, suggest a short childrens programme based around the koalas and Jean.\n\nIt hit the Midlands ITV schedules five days a week, later airing across the whole of the network.\n\nJean also hosted many other programmes from ATV in Birmingham before taking on an executive role behind the scenes in the mid-1970s. more....\n\nRonan O'Casey, actor and playwright, has died aged 89(10 May 2012)\n\nRonan O'Casey found early success as a stylish character actor in the postwar films such as The Mudlark (1950), Talk of a Million (1951) and Norman Wisdom's Trouble in Store (1953), going on to play the prisoner of Room 101 in 1984 (1956) and the sergeant in Nicholas Ray's war film Bitter Victory (1957). While starring in the West End in Detective Story he met my mother, the actor and singer Louie Ramsay, whom he married in 1956.\n\nCasey's comedy talents then brought him his best known role, as Jeff Rogers, Canadian son-in-law of Peggy Mount, in the sitcom The Larkins (1958-64). He also became host of ITV's charades gameshow Don't Say a Word (1963), before being cast as Vanessa Redgrave's lover, the \"blow-up\" of Antonioni's Blow-Up (1966). more....\n\nBert Weedon, guitarist, has died aged 91(20 April 2012)\n\nHis big musical break came after the war, when he joined Stephane Grapellis group as a replacement for Django Reinhardt, then progressed through the rhythm sections of various popular dance bands of the day, including those of Harry Leader, Lou Praeger and Harry Gold. By the early Fifties, Weedon was resident guitarist with the BBC Showband under Cyril Stapleton and worked on regular radio sessions.\n\nSigned to EMIs Parlophone label as a solo artist, Weedons first record, Stranger Than Fiction, was released as a 78rpm single in 1956.\n\nWeedon also became a prolific broadcaster, appearing regularly on childrens television shows such as Tuesday Rendezvous and Five OClock Club, as well as on radio and fronting his own long-running ITV series.\n\nThrough his skimpy 'Play-in-a-Day' manual, which first appeared in 1957, Weedon introduced aspiring musicians to the three basic chords that underpinned most of the simple rock and roll hits of the Elvis era, and explained what to do next. more....\n\nPeter Halliday, actor, has died aged 87 (16 March 2012)\n\nAs the young, idealistic scientist Dr John Fleming, he was the star of A for Andromeda (1961), decoding radio signals from a fictional galaxy in outer space and discovering them to be instructions for building a super-computer that can generate human life.\n\nHe made his screen debut in the 1954 B-film Fatal Journey, in the Scotland Yard series of crime dramas, and was later seen on the big screen in pictures such as The Battle of the River Plate (1956), Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971) and The Remains of the Day (1993).\n\nBut Halliday found more rewarding roles on television  almost 100 in all, in programmes ranging from The Count of Monte Cristo (1956) and Danger Man (1965) to The Sweeney (1975) and occasional sitcoms, including Goodnight Sweetheart (1997). Whereas in his early days he was often cast as police officers, in later years he frequently found himself playing priests.\n\nHalliday appeared on the London stage in The Dark is Light Enough (Aldwych Theatre, 1954), the musical Chorus Girls (Theatre Royal, Stratford, 1981), Exclusive (Strand Theatre, 1989) and For Services Rendered (Old Vic Theatre, 1992-93). He took over the role of Roy Jenkins in the John Wells satire Anyone for Denis? (Whitehall Theatre, 1982), in which the politician was cast as butler to Margaret and Denis Thatcher. more....\n\nLouise Cochrane, the creator of Rag Tag and Bobtail has died aged 93(8 March 2012)\n\nRag, Tag and Bobtail were three puppet characters (Rag was the hedgehog, Tag the mouse, and Bobtail, the rabbit) whose innocent woodland capers delighted children in that remote period when only one-third of homes had a television and screens went blank between 6 and 7pm so that small children could be put to bed . To those brought up in the early 1950s, the Watch With Mother line-up - Picture Book on Monday; Andy Pandy on Tuesday; The Flowerpot Men on Wednesday; Rag, Tag and Bobtail on Thursday; and The Woodentops on Friday, is probably more familiar than memories of their first school.\n\nIn 1948 Louise Cochrane joined the BBC as a producer of current affairs programmes for schools.\n\nAs well as Rag, Tag and Bobtail, for which Louise Cochrane wrote her first episode in 1953, she published a series of career advice books such as Sheila Goes Gardening (1957) and Social Work for Jill (1959). more....\n\nRobert Easton, actor, has died aged 81(26 January 2012)\n\nAfter an appearance in the John Huston-directed Civil War drama The Red Badge of Courage (1951), the 6ft 4in actor legally changed his name, dropping his father's surname to become Robert Easton  sometimes credited as Bob Easton. He was rarely out of work and soon in demand on television, too, taking one-off roles in series such as The Adventures of Superman (1953) and Gun Law (1955) before a run as the college student Brian McAfee in The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show (1957-58).\n\nTo branch out from the country-bumpkin roles in which he was becoming typecast, Easton decided he must learn other accents. He studied phonetics at University College London, which enabled him to add European dialects to his repertoire. While there, he acted alongside Steve McQueen in the film The War Lover (1962), about the effects of combat on young men at a USAF base in Cambridgeshire, and appeared in the comedy Come Fly with Me (1963). He also had a small role in the television series The Saint (1962). more....\n\nHarry Fowler, 'Cheeky cockney' character actor has died aged 85(5 January 2012)\n\nHarry Fowler never attained star status but created a gallery of sparky characters, including minor villains, servicemen, reporters and tradesmen enriched by an ever-present cheeky smile and an authentic cockney accent. He was Smudge or Smiley, Nipper or Knocker, Bert or 'Orace, as part of an essential background  an everyman for every occasion.\n\nAlthough he was called up and served in the RAF, he was given leave to appear in eight films, including Alberto Cavalcanti's anti-fascist Went the Day Well? (1942), then again as an evacuee in The Demi-Paradise (1943). He was also in the modest semi-documentary Painted Boats in 1945, directed by Charles Crichton.\n\nOn television, Fowler could be seen in series such as Dixon of Dock Green and Z-Cars, but his big break came with three years' duty in Granada's popular comedy The Army Game (1959-61) and later as Harry Danvers in the heaven-sent Our Man at St Mark's (1965-66). These and later series including World's End (1981) and Dead Ernest (1982) brought lucrative employment, as did commercials.\n\nHe still accepted cameo roles in films, including Doctor in Clover (1966), recalling the advice that \"each appearance was an advertisement for the next\". He turned up as a milkman delivering to a home tyrannised by Bette Davis in Seth Holt's fine chiller The Nanny (1965), drove a cab in Lucky Jim (1957), and featured in the film of George and Mildred (1980), as he had in the TV series. more....\n\nRonald Searle, artist and author, has died aged 91(4 January 2012)\n\nAfter the war, Searle worked as a graphic artist for advertisers; created St Trinians (based on his sisters school and other girls schools in Cambridge); collaborated with Geoffrey Willans on the Molesworth books (Down With Skool!, 1953, and How to be Topp, 1954); and produced an extraordinary volume of work for magazines and newspapers, including drawings for Life, Holiday and Punch and cartoons for The New Yorker, The Sunday Express, the News Chronicle and Tribune.\n\nHe also designed posters, illustrations for travel books and the title backgrounds for the Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder film The Happiest Days of Your Life (1950).\n\nSearle attempted to kill off St Trinians in 1953 to concentrate on what he considered to be his more serious work. But, much to his annoyance, a series of film adaptations meant that the spindly stockinged legs and dastardly schemes of his St Trinians girls remained his most distinctive trademark in Britain.\n\nAs the sadistic minxes of the school and their male counterparts, the illiterate \"skoolboys\" of St Custards, continued to delight generations of British schoolchildren, Searle complained of being trivialised and typecast in his homeland. more....\n\nRonald Wolfe writer of Educating Archie, The Rag Trade and On The Buses has died aged 89(20 December 2011)\n\nRonald Wolfe was a cousin of the actor Warren Mitchell. He worked as a radio engineer for Marconi before contributing scripts to BBC radio series and writing material for Beryl Reid's stage shows. In 1953, a year after Reid joined the radio comedy Educating Archie, starring the ventriloquist Peter Brough and his schoolboy puppet, he was asked to produce scripts for it and eventually became head writer. The programme also featured Ronald Chesney performing his \"talking harmonica\" novelty act and at times included Benny Hill, Dick Emery and Bruce Forsyth.\n\nWolfe and Chesney continued in the same roles for a 1956 BBC television special and the 1957 series Archie in Australia but, when ITV launched Educating Arch"
