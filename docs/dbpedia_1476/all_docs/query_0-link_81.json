Actually, and almost unthinkably, there were two variety shows called Saturday Night Live scheduled to premiere on U.S. TV in 1975. One had Bill Murray and Christopher Guest as regulars; the other one would as well, but not initially. The first show to arrive that year, in prime time on ABC, was Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell. Hosted by the abrasive co-host of ABC’s Monday Night Football and emanating from the same theater that until recently had housed The Ed Sullivan Show, this Saturday Night Live variety series counted Murray and Guest among its repertory company and premiered on September 20, 1975.\n\n…\n\nHe’s trying, he’s experimenting, he’s pushing himself,” Groening concludes, “and it just feels very cinematic.” 3 VARIETY/SKETCH KEY EVOLUTIONARY STAGES Toast of the Town/The Ed Sullivan Show 1948–71, CBS Your Show of Shows 1950–54, NBC The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour 1967–69, CBS The Carol Burnett Show 1967–78, CBS Saturday Night Live 1975–, NBC Of all the TV genres considered in this book, variety may be the hardest to define and pin down. What is a TV variety show? A parade of talented acts, presided over by a host such as Ed Sullivan? Sure. Then is American Idol a variety show? And musical showcases, from American Bandstand to Shindig! and Hullabaloo? What about sketch shows, like Your Show of Shows and Saturday Night Live? And late-night talk shows that feature comedy sketches, from Steve Allen to Jimmy Fallon?\n\n…\n\nWhen I teach my TV History and Appreciation class at Rowan University and get to Your Show of Shows, I begin by asking my twentysomething students what TV series comes to mind, based on the following clues: It’s a weekly TV show broadcast live on NBC on Saturday nights, ninety minutes long, featuring different musical guests and guest hosts each week with a regular repertory cast of comic actors. The overwhelming consensus answer is Saturday Night Live, but the answer, because we’re studying TV of the 1950s, is Your Show of Shows, which, I tell my students, was essentially Saturday Night Live more than sixty years ago but in prime time and without cue cards. They seem amazed by the thought, then, after sampling such sketches as “This Is Your Story” (a brilliant parody of the NBC ambush biography show This Is Your Life) and “The Clock” (the core acting quartet as mechanical figures in a malfunctioning Bavarian clock), they seem both amazed and amused.\n\nIs Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns) by Mindy Kaling\n\nBerlin Wall, Burning Man, Donner party, East Village, financial engineering, illegal immigration, index card, medical residency, pre–internet, rent control, Saturday Night Live, Triangle Shirtwaist Factory\n\nIn my imagination, I am, of course, one of the ghostbusters, with the likes of say, Emily Blunt, Taraji Henson, and Natalie Portman. Even if I’m not the ringleader, I’m definitely the one who gets to say “I ain’t afraid a no ghost.” At least the first time. Contributing Nothing at Saturday Night Live I WAS A dreadful guest writer on Saturday Night Live. Not like, destructively bad or anything, just a useless, friendly extra body in the SNL offices eating hamburgers for free, like Wimpy from Popeye. I came into the show during the hiatus between seasons two and three of The Office. My friend Mike Schur, who had worked at SNL before The Office, recommended me to Mike Shoemaker, a producer over there.\n\n…\n\nWe were walking by the reservoir one beautiful late-spring afternoon eating ice-cream cones and he was suddenly shot in the back of the head by a deranged man wearing an Antonin Scalia mask. “Scalia” runs away, cackling like the Joker, and hops into an Escalade and peels off. My handsome, innocent husband dies in my arms, the very night he was going to host Saturday Night Live for the first time. (Oh, yes, in this fantasy, my husband is a star point guard for the team that just won the NBA Finals.) They get Jon Hamm to host a very somber Saturday Night Live that night. I can barely do the cameo I was going to do on Weekend Update. Yes, I still do the cameo. I’m sad, but come on—SNL cameo. Seth Meyers can’t muster up the cheerfulness he usually has, either.\n\n…\n\n(Or, How I Made My First Real Friend) I LOVE NEW YORK AND IT LIKES ME OKAY Failing at Everything in the Greatest City on Earth The Exact Level of Fame I Want Karaoke Etiquette Day Jobs Best Friend Rights and Responsibilities Matt & Ben & Mindy & Brenda HOLLYWOOD: MY GOOD FRIEND WHO IS ALSO A LITTLE EMBARRASSING Types of Women in Romantic Comedies Who Are Not Real All About The Office Franchises I Would Like to Reboot Contributing Nothing at Saturday Night Live Roasts Are Terrible My Favorite Eleven Moments in Comedy How I Write The Day I Stopped Eating Cupcakes Somewhere in Hollywood Someone Is Pitching This Movie THE BEST DISTRACTION IN THE WORLD: ROMANCE AND GUYS Someone Explain One-Night Stands to Me “Hooking Up” Is Confusing I Love Irish Exits Guys Need to Do Almost Nothing to Be Great Non-Traumatic Things That Have Made Me Cry Jewish Guys Men and Boys In Defense of Chest Hair Married People Need to Step It Up Why Do Men Put on Their Shoes So Slowly?\n\nAnd Here's the Kicker: Conversations with 21 Top Humor Writers on Their Craft by Mike Sacks\n\nAlbert Einstein, Charles Lindbergh, Columbine, David Sedaris, Donald Trump, Dr. Strangelove, Exxon Valdez, fake news, fear of failure, game design, illegal immigration, In Cold Blood by Truman Capote, index card, Joan Didion, Martin Parr, Norman Mailer, out of africa, pre–internet, Ronald Reagan, Saturday Night Live, upwardly mobile\n\nShow with Bob and David) TODD HANSON (The Onion) MARSHALL BRICKMAN (The Tonight Show, Annie Hall, Manhattan, The Muppet Show) Quick and Painless Advice for the Aspiring Humor Writer, Part Four: Getting Your Humor Piece Published in The New Yorker MITCH HURWITZ (Arrested Development) Quick and Painless Advice for the Aspiring Humor Writer, Part Five: Acquiring an Agent or Manager for Your Script DAVID SEDARIS (Naked, Me Talk Pretty One Day) GEORGE MEYER (Army Man, The Simpsons) AL JAFFEE (Mad's Fold-In, “Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions”) ALLISON SILVERMAN (The Daily Show, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Colbert Report) Quick and Painless Advice for the Aspiring Humor Writer, Part Six: Getting a Job as a Writer for Late-Night Television ROBERT SMIGEL (Saturday Night Live, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, “TV Funhouse”) DAVE BARRY (Dave Barry's Guide to Marriage and/or Sex) DICK CAVETT (The Tonight Show, The Dick Cavett Show) LARRY WILMORE (In Living Color, The Bernie Mac Show, The Daily Show, The Office) JACK HANDEY (Saturday Night Live, The New Yorker) LARRY GELBART (Caesar's Hour, M*A*S*H, Tootsie) Quick and Painless Advice for the Aspiring Humor Writer, Part Seven: Getting Your Comic Book or Graphic Novel Published ROZ CHAST (The New Yorker) Quick and Painless Advice for the Aspiring Humor Writer, Part Eight: Getting a Book of Humor Published DANIEL HANDLER (A Series of Unfortunate Events) Quick and Painless Advice for the Aspiring Humor Writer, Part Nine: Selling Your Movie Script to a Studio Executive BRUCE JAY FRIEDMAN (Stir Crazy, Splash) DANIEL CLOWES (Ghost World, Esquire, New York Times Magazine) Canned Laughter: A History Reconstructed Recommended Reading Foreword by Adam McKay There are a few ways that you, the reader, have come to this book.\n\n…\n\nWe tried to write a lot of material that was outrageous for its own sake. But the Lampoon material I really enjoyed was the more subtle work. John Belushi left to do Saturday Night Live in 1975. Were you ever asked to join that show? Lorne Michaels offered me a job after the first year, but I was already writing and performing on SCTV. Lorne didn't offer me a guarantee to perform on SNL — only to write. But I was happily doing both at SCTV. And in a way, and this sounds odd to say, I didn't like Saturday Night Live that much. Really? Why? The people I knew on the show, I'd seen them all do better work. I also thought the writing was a little weak and gratuitous in a lot of ways.\n\n…\n\nAnd my characters, such as the Guy Under the Seats and the Panicky Guy, and all the “guys” for that matter were basically poking fun at the running characters that were the staples of shows like Saturday Night Live. It was all very anti-performance oriented, but at some point the audience did start laughing, and I gradually evolved into the kind of running character that I was making fun of in the first place. How well did you know Andy Kaufman? He was one of the first people I met when I moved to L.A. in 1977. I had seen him on Saturday Night Live and related to him in a big way, because his pieces seemed so art school — esque to me. So we hung out a little. He had started to do a weekly midnight talk show at the Improv in L.A., which he was calling “Midnight Snacks.”\n\nSmarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg\n\nAir France Flight 447, Asperger Syndrome, Atul Gawande, behavioural economics, Black Swan, cognitive dissonance, Daniel Kahneman / Amos Tversky, data science, David Brooks, digital map, epigenetics, Erik Brynjolfsson, framing effect, high-speed rail, hiring and firing, index card, John von Neumann, knowledge worker, Lean Startup, Malcom McLean invented shipping containers, meta-analysis, new economy, power law, Saturday Night Live, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley startup, statistical model, Steve Jobs, the scientific method, the strength of weak ties, theory of mind, Toyota Production System, William Langewiesche, Yom Kippur War\n\nThis became one of our five key themes, along with dependability, structure/clarity, job meaning, and impact.” would never stop For my understanding of the early days of Saturday Night Live, I am indebted to those writers and cast members who were willing to speak with me, as well as Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller, Live from New York: An Uncensored History of “Saturday Night Live” (Boston: Back Bay Books, 2008); Ellin Stein, That’s Not Funny, That’s Sick: The National Lampoon and the Comedy Insurgents Who Captured the Mainstream (New York: Norton, 2013); Marianne Partridge, ed., “Rolling Stone” Visits “Saturday Night Live” (Garden City, N.Y.: Dolphin Books, 1979); Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad, Saturday Night: A Backstage History of “Saturday Night Live” (San Francisco: Untreed Reads, 2011).\n\n…\n\nAll of these people created the first season of Saturday Night Live. Howard Shore, the show’s music director, had gone to summer camp with Michaels. Neil Levy, the show’s talent coordinator, was Michaels’s cousin. Michaels had met Chevy Chase while standing in a line in Hollywood to see Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Tom Schiller, another writer, knew Michaels because they had gone to Joshua Tree to eat hallucinogenic mushrooms together, and Schiller’s father, a Hollywood writer, had taken Michaels under his wing early in the young man’s career. The original cast and writers of Saturday Night Live hailed largely from Canada, Chicago, and Los Angeles and all moved to New York in 1975.\n\n…\n\n(They tend to get complicated, because Michaels was married to writer Rosie Shuster, who eventually ended up with Dan Aykroyd, who had dated Gilda Radner, who everyone suspected was in love with writer Alan Zweibel, who later wrote a book explaining they were in love, but nothing ever happened and, besides, Radner later married a member of the SNL band. “It was the 1970s,” Miller told me. “Sex was what you did.”) Saturday Night Live has been held up as a model of great team dynamics. It is cited in college textbooks as an example of what groups can achieve when the right conditions are in place and a team intensely bonds. The group that created Saturday Night Live came together so successfully, this theory goes, because a communal culture replaced individual needs. There were shared experiences (“We were all the kids who didn’t get to sit at the popular table in high school,” Beatts told me); common social networks (“Lorne was a cult leader,” said writer Bruce McCall.\n\nGirl Walks Into a Bar . . .: Comedy Calamities, Dating Disasters, and a Midlife Miracle by Rachel Dratch\n\nBurning Man, Chuck Templeton: OpenTable:, East Village, Haight Ashbury, off-the-grid, rolodex, Saturday Night Live, the High Line\n\nHow to answer this question: What happened to me? Where have I been since you last saw me on TV? I know where I’ve been. My friends know where I’ve been. They see me all the time. But, to the comedy-viewing public—Where have I been? Sometimes people think I’m still working, because they see me on reruns of Saturday Night Live or King of Queens. People think if they see you on reruns, that means you’re working. No. You are sitting in your apartment watching Judge Mathis. That’s what you are doing. Don’t get me wrong. I’m still a vibrant part of the showbiz community. My agent still calls with offers for work. It goes like this: RRRIIIINNG!\n\n…\n\nIn the narrow lens of Hollywood, which wants to give the instant stereotype viewers can zone into, I belong in the lesbian parts. Trolls, ogres, and woodland creatures can be done with CGI, so that leaves yours truly to play the bull dykes. That’s the very quick answer to the question “What happened to me?” But read on—I’ll tell you some more. We’re Going in a Different Direction I was a cast member on Saturday Night Live for seven years. Then my contract was up. I was going to be starring in a new show called 30 Rock in the role of Jenna. Have you guys seen 30 Rock? Yeah … I’m not Jenna. That was back in 2006 and strangers still ask me, “Why aren’t you on 30 Rock?” “What happened with 30 Rock?” “Are we gonna see you on more 30 Rock?”\n\n…\n\nOf course, if you don’t have a television, then none of the following will matter to you, but let me tell you, this is the very important stuff you are missing while you are playing the fiddle or telling stories by firelight or whatever it is you do instead of watching TV. 30 Rock is a show about the backstage happenings at an SNL-type comedy show called The Girlie Show. Created by and starring Tina Fey. Produced by Lorne Michaels (who, for you actively non-TV people, is also the creator and producer of Saturday Night Live). Also starring Alec Baldwin and four other actors Tina had worked with previously—Tracy Morgan from SNL, Jack McBrayer and Scott Adsit from Second City, and, briefly, me from both SNL and Second City. After we shot the pilot, I got a call from my agent. “They’re changing the show.” Or he may have said, “They’re going in a different direction.”\n\nYes Please by Amy Poehler\n\nairport security, Albert Einstein, blood diamond, carbon footprint, David Sedaris, do what you love, Donald Trump, East Village, gentrification, Google Hangouts, Pepto Bismol, Saturday Night Live, Sheryl Sandberg, Skype, the medium is the message\n\nIt’s a privilege if a clear path is laid out that will take you to another work environment. It’s rare that someone builds a bridge to the next great thing. After Saturday Night Live my bridge was Michael Schur. The next great thing was Parks and Recreation.1 1 Note from Mike: My grandmother wanted me to be an engineer; being called a “bridge” is the closest I will ever get, and so I thank you. Mike and I were friends and coworkers at Saturday Night Live. He was a writer before I got there and ran “Weekend Update” during the Tina Fey/Jimmy Fallon years. Mike is a whip-smart Harvard grad who manages to be as compassionate as he is funny.\n\n…\n\nI told her that I loved everything about that show: how it represented time spent with my mother, how it reminded me of myself as a young woman learning to love comedy, how when she took off her makeup and answered questions at the end of the show it was such a generous act because she seemed like one of us. She said, and I quote, “Oh, Amy, you are my new best friend!” It’s in print, I swear. A lot of people ask me if I always knew I was going to be on Saturday Night Live. I think the simple answer is: yes. I don’t mean to sound cocky. I didn’t know if I had the talent or drive, I just had a tiny little voice whispering inside of me. That same voice would tell me I would meet Carol Burnett someday, I would find love, I would be okay. We all have a tiny whispery voice inside of us, but the bad ones are usually at a lower register and come through a little clearer.\n\n…\n\nI don’t know where the good voice came from. It was a mix of loving parents, luck, and me. But ever since I was a small child, I would look at places where I wanted to be and believe I would eventually be on the other side of the glass. I believed that someday in the future, I would be rehearsing onstage at Saturday Night Live while a gaggle of sophomore girls would be waving to me. All of them wearing cooler outfits than my classmates and I wore that day. My high school musical did not offer a shirtless Zac Efron, but it did provide me with many lessons. I learned that I loved being in a theater, attending rehearsals, and building sets.\n\nSmartcuts: How Hackers, Innovators, and Icons Accelerate Success by Shane Snow\n\n3D printing, Airbnb, Albert Einstein, Apollo 11, attribution theory, augmented reality, barriers to entry, conceptual framework, correlation does not imply causation, David Heinemeier Hansson, deliberate practice, disruptive innovation, Elon Musk, fail fast, Fellow of the Royal Society, Filter Bubble, Ford Model T, Google X / Alphabet X, hive mind, index card, index fund, Isaac Newton, job satisfaction, Khan Academy, Kickstarter, lateral thinking, Law of Accelerating Returns, Lean Startup, Mahatma Gandhi, meta-analysis, Neil Armstrong, pattern recognition, Peter Thiel, popular electronics, Ray Kurzweil, Richard Florida, Ronald Reagan, Ruby on Rails, Saturday Night Live, self-driving car, seminal paper, Sheryl Sandberg, side project, Silicon Valley, social bookmarking, Steve Jobs, superconnector, vertical integration\n\nHe fixated on the careers of comics like Sandler and Spade and tracked the movements of their management teams, agencies, films, and TV shows as if he was earning school credit for it. Jimmy’s goal since childhood, he explained to Siegel, had been to join the cast of Saturday Night Live. He was endearing. After a two-hour call, Siegel offered to represent him. She had one question, however. “Why don’t you stay and graduate?” Jimmy was a semester shy of a degree. Siegel suggested that they get started in the summer, so he’d have a bachelor’s degree to fall back on, just in case. “No, no,” Jimmy insisted. “I need to get on Saturday Night Live, and you’re going to make it happen, because you know Adam Sandler! I don’t want to do anything else.” Siegel knew this was a long shot—and a long-term endeavor—especially for an out-of-town kid with zero acting credits.\n\n…\n\nAfter two dozen attempts to recontact her by phone, e-mail, and LinkedIn, and at least one attempt to smooth talk my way past security at 30 Rock, I gave up.

The first section of this book discusses how some people use such “hacker” thinking to shorten paths to success. It’s how some people take a few years to become president while others spend 30. It’s how unknown comedians get on Saturday Night Live and Internet companies get to millions of users in months. Lateral thinking doesn’t replace hard work; it eliminates unnecessary cycles.

It was there, on the night of October 11, 1975, that I turned on the TV and watched the premier episode of Saturday Night Live. “Fuck,” I thought, “they did it.” The new comedy had been brought to the airwaves in New York by people I didn’t know, and they were incredibly good at it, too. The show was a heavy blow to my inner belief that I alone was leading the cavalry and carrying the new comedy flag. Saturday Night Live and I, however, were destined to meet. My performing roll continued. Dave Felton, a highly regarded rock-and-roll journalist, interviewed me for an article in Rolling Stone.\n\n…\n\nWhen the car got up to speed, the driver pushed him out of the moving vehicle, and he rolled onto the rainy streets of Manhattan. I pictured Danny bouncing down the wet pavement and then said the only thing that came to mind. I asked him if he wanted to go to Saks and shop for clothes. He said, as friendly as he could, “Uh, man, that’s not my thing.” We liked each other, but we were different. I first appeared on Saturday Night Live in October 1976. I felt powerful butterflies just prior to being introduced, especially when I reminded myself that it was live, and anything that went wrong stayed wrong. But it is possible to will confidence. My consistent performing schedule had kept me sharp; it would have been difficult to blow it.\n\n…\n\nMy physicality intensified and compressed—smaller gestures had greater meaning—and my comedy became more potent as I settled deeper into my own body. I opened the show with this line: “I have decided to give the greatest performance of my life! Oh, wait, sorry, that’s tomorrow night.” My fame knocked on my parents’ door. They couldn’t help hearing about their son. My father, though, was not impressed. After my first appearance on Saturday Night Live, he wrote a bad review of me in his newsletter for the Newport Beach Association of Realtors, of which he was president: “His performance did nothing to further his career.” Later, shamefaced, my father told me that his best friend had come into his office holding the newsletter, placed it on his desk, and shaken his head sternly, indicating a wordless “This is wrong.”\n\nYou're a Horrible Person, but I Like You: The Believer Book of Advice by The Believer\n\nblood diamond, Burning Man, haute cuisine, Kickstarter, Mahatma Gandhi, McDonald's hot coffee lawsuit, nuclear winter, Saturday Night Live\n\nJudd Fred Armisen Dear Fred: What do you think is the best way to tell my dad I’m a lesbian?

But again, his number, please. Fred … Dear Fred: Which is better for cannabis, the cookie or the brownie?\n\n…\n\nHave you ever been to a Cubs game? Try the deep-dish. Do you like white people playing the blues? How about white people listening to the blues? If “yes,” you’re all set. If “no,” you gotta go. I lived in Chicago and had some good times there. I also felt alienated by the “Da Bears” mentality. Sorry to bring up that Saturday Night Live sketch I helped write. Who invented the phrase “my bad”? That was “their bad” for sure. Bob … Dear Bob: I’m a Jew who doesn’t agree with the politics in Israel. When I explain this to my Jewish friends, they say I’m a self-hating Jew and anti-Semitic. But isn’t that as absurd as calling somebody unpatriotic for not blindly supporting the Bush administration?\n\n…\n\nHe’s also one-third of MTV’s hit sketch comedy series Human Giant. Judd Apatow wrote and directed the films Knocked Up and Funny People and was the cowriter and director of The 40-Year-Old Virgin.

In August, then, Jim began meeting regularly with Michaels’s writers in preparation for the weekly late night series Jim referred to on his desk calendar only as the “NBC Show,” but which Michaels was calling Saturday Night—and then, eventually, Saturday Night Live. Saturday Night Live was a comedy variety show, but, as envisioned by Michaels and his scrappy team of writers, one unlike any variety show that had ever been seen before. “We wanted to redefine comedy the way the Beatles redefined what being a pop star was,” Michaels said later. The very idea of it—an unpredictable live show unafraid of taking on politicians, presidents, or pop culture—terrified the network even months before it ever went before the cameras.\n\n…\n\nHe was accustomed to working hard for his clients and determined never to take no for an answer. Brillstein would eventually become one of the most powerful and respected agents, managers, and producers in show business, with an A-list roster of celebrity clients, including, it seemed, nearly the entire cast of Saturday Night Live. In 1960, however, as head of William Morris’s commercial office, his job was recruiting and representing talent for television commercials. Brillstein, an early fan of television, quickly put to rest the showbiz aphorism that television commercials were for has-beens or the hard up, assembling a stable of top-tier clients like Zsa Zsa Gabor, Harpo Marx … and Burr Tillstrom.\n\n…\n\nAnd as Jim and his team packed up their boxes to leave, Eisner gave them the go-ahead for a Muppet-related pilot. At last, Jim had yes for an answer—and now that he had ABC on board to produce a pilot, Jim was certain a weekly Muppet television show was a sure thing. He would be wrong.

It had to do with demographics. At that point, there was no television aimed at the twelve- to thirty-four-year-old demographic. Half of the Saturday Night Live audience was over thirty-five. If you were an advertiser buying time on Saturday Night Live to reach young adults, half your money was wasted on thirty-five-plus. We said, If this music channel reaches twelve to thirty-four year olds, we can deliver an audience for advertisers they can’t get through broadcast television. Cable providers would sign up new subscribers, because this would be available only on cable.\n\n…\n\nWhen I got there, she said, “I’m watching this new channel, MTV.” What a weird thing. What do you mean, they’re showing music videos? What’s a music video? Why would you show that? I can’t stop watching! We watched for six hours. It’s one of those things you can’t describe to anyone who’s younger than you, like the first year of Saturday Night Live. It was like a comet streaking across the sky. DAVE MUSTAINE, Megadeth: My mom moved out when I was fifteen, so I’d been living alone in my apartment for a few years. People would ditch school, come over, buy pot from me, and watch MTV. I’m telling you, man, I had the coolest house in the town.\n\n…\n\nLEE MASTERS, MTV executive: Bob and I met in 1972, when we were both teenage disc jockeys, working in the South. A few years later, Bob hired me to work for him at WNBC as on-air talent, and we did Album Tracks together, which was a precursor to MTV in many ways. There weren’t many outlets for music videos, so Bob had an idea for a show that would run after Saturday Night Live on NBC stations in New York, Chicago, Washington, and LA. We wrote the show and we were the on-camera talent, so to speak. We showed “Paradise by the Dashboard Light” and some Styx clips from The Grand Illusion. It was always album rock.

That could have been a cheap laugh— and probably wouldn't have been acceptable to NBC censors—but Zeibel finessed that by referring to buildings and monuments. The audience got the point immediately, and the laughter was even louder because the implicitness of the joke made them feel more comfortable.\n\nThe Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee by Sarah Silverman\n\nhaute couture, index card, Nelson Mandela, Saturday Night Live, Skype\n\nSo a heartfelt thanks to Kerry--the friend I deeply adore but get to enjoy only on special occasions. LIVE FROM NEW YORK, YOU'RE FIRED * * * The Happiest I Have Ever Been in a Public Toilet * * * In 1993, when I was twenty-two, I flew to Los Angeles to meet with Jim Downey and Lorne Michaels (the executive producer and head writer nonrespectively, of Saturday Night Live). They were looking to hire new writer-performers for the upcoming season, and I was one candidate among many to be interviewed. To the meeting, I wore my hair mostly down, with two small ponytails pulled off my face, mimicking a picture of Gilda Radner that had always stuck in my mind. Later that night, I was invited to the Coneheads premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and that's where my manager informed me that I'd gotten the job.\n\n…\n\nInstead, I hugged him. The only thing that kept me from melting to the floor was the fact that I was bouncing up to the ceiling. I could not believe it. I wanted to tell everyone. Nothing in the world--at least for a comedian--could be better than telling your friends that you're going to be on Saturday Night Live. Telling those very people with whom you reenacted all the \"Sweeney Sisters\" musical numbers, telling your mother who never said \"cheeseburger\" or \"Pepsi\" the same way after 1975. I don't know what to compare it to. I guess if you fixed clocks for a living, it'd be like getting to fix Big Ben.\n\n…\n\nStill, I was able to show some prowess on the court, and I piqued Garry's interest enough that he came to see me do stand-up. About a year or so later, he and writer Alan Zweibel created a role for me on an episode of The Larry Sanders Show as one of the writers on the show-within-the-show. It was probably my biggest career thrill since getting hired to be an actual writer at Saturday Night Live. There was just one thing standing between me and a whole new level of career prestige: my agent. I got a call from Justin, the writers' assistant at Sanders, whom I knew from basketball at Garry's house. He said, \"You should know this. I was asked to call your agent at CAA to get tape on you, so that the other writers here could get familiar with you and write the part in your voice.\n\nSimple Rules: How to Thrive in a Complex World by Donald Sull, Kathleen M.

The form of improvisation pioneered at The Second City inspired influential U.S. television shows including Saturday Night Live, Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and too many movies to mention. In contrast to standup comedians, who succeed or bomb alone onstage, improvisation is a team effort where it is hard to look good unless everyone else does. Few tasks are as daunting as getting onstage with a group of actors whom you may barely know and making up a performance as you go along, with the proviso that your performance must be hilarious.\n\n…\n\nCODIFYING PERSONAL EXPERIENCE In a comedy hall of fame, Tina Fey would be a first-ballot inductee. Her stats—eight Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards—speak for themselves. After starting her career as an improvisational comedian at The Second City, Fey took a job writing, and then performing, for Saturday Night Live. There, she became the first female head writer in a profession dominated by men. She went on to produce and star in the highly acclaimed 30 Rock, a show loosely based on her time as head writer. Fey is noteworthy not only for her successes, but for the variety in her career. In the span of two decades, she moved through a series of diverse roles including standup comedy, writing, leading a team of writers, producing a show, and starring in feature films.\n\n…\n\nIn the span of two decades, she moved through a series of diverse roles including standup comedy, writing, leading a team of writers, producing a show, and starring in feature films. Fey is an incredibly talented comic, yet simple rules also play a role in her success. In an insightful article, Fey distilled what she learned from her experience with Lorne Michaels, the legendary producer of Saturday Night Live. She articulates nine rules for managing a comedy show, five of which deal with handling extremely creative people. Rule number 4 states, “When hiring, mix Harvard nerds with Chicago improvisers and stir.” The Harvard Lampoon alumni bring logic and sophistication to the humor, while veterans of improvisation know what will work in front of a live audience.\n\nFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff\n\nAffordable Care Act / Obamacare, barriers to entry, Bernie Sanders, Biosphere 2, Carl Icahn, centre right, disinformation, disintermediation, Donald Trump, drone strike, Edward Snowden, Elon Musk, fake news, false flag, forensic accounting, illegal immigration, impulse control, Jeff Bezos, Jeffrey Epstein, obamacare, open immigration, opioid epidemic / opioid crisis, Paris climate accords, Peter Thiel, Renaissance Technologies, ride hailing / ride sharing, Robert Mercer, Ronald Reagan, Russian election interference, Saturday Night Live, self-driving car, Sheryl Sandberg, Silicon Valley, single-payer health, Steve Bannon, Travis Kalanick, WikiLeaks, zero-sum game\n\nThe president and First Family are not, at least not usually, subjected to the sort of paparazzi pursuit that in celebrity media results in unflattering to embarrassing to mocking photographs, or in endless speculation about their private lives. Even in the worst scandals, a businesslike suit-and-tie formality is still accorded the president. Saturday Night Live presidential skits are funny in part because they play on our belief that in reality, presidents are quite contained and buttoned-down figures, and their families, trotting not far behind, colorless and obedient. The joke on Nixon was that he was pitiably uptight—even at the height of Watergate, drinking heavily, he remained in his coat and tie, kneeling in prayer.\n\n…\n\nAlong with highlighting White House announcements—separating the trivial from the significant—the paper would also highlight, often in front-page coverage, the sense of the absurd, the pitiable, and the all-too-human. These stories turned Trump into a figure of ridicule. The two White House reporters most consistently on this beat, Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush, would become part of Trump’s constant refrain about the media being out to get him. Thrush would even become a fixture in Saturday Night Live sketches that mocked the president, his children, his press secretary Sean Spicer, and his advisers Bannon and Conway. The president, while often a fabulist in his depiction of the world, was quite a literalist when it came to how he saw himself. Hence he rebutted this picture of him as a half-demented or seriously addled midnight stalker in the White House by insisting that he didn’t own a bathrobe.\n\n…\n\nTrump demanded and repeated the question, and then repeated the answer: “Zero! Zero!” And that went for his son-in-law, too, who had a lot to learn. The media was not only hurting him, he said—he was not looking for any agreement or really even any response—but hurting his negotiating capabilities, which hurt the nation. And that went for Saturday Night Live, too, which might think it was very funny but was actually hurting everybody in the country. And while he understood that SNL was there to be mean to him, they were being very, very mean. It was “fake comedy.” He had reviewed the treatment of all other presidents in the media and there was nothing like this ever, even of Nixon who was treated very unfairly.\n\nPowerhouse: The Untold Story of Hollywood's Creative Artists Agency by James Andrew Miller\n\nAffordable Care Act / Obamacare, Airbnb, Albert Einstein, Bonfire of the Vanities, business process, collective bargaining, corporate governance, do what you love, Donald Trump, Easter island, family office, financial engineering, independent contractor, interchangeable parts, Joan Didion, junk bonds, Kickstarter, Kōnosuke Matsushita, Larry Ellison, obamacare, out of africa, rolodex, Ronald Reagan, Saturday Night Live, Silicon Valley, Skype, SoftBank, stem cell, Steve Jobs, traveling salesman, union organizing, vertical integration\n\nThis book is the product of both years and decades of work. The interviewing process began several years ago, but CAA has been part of the fabric of two prior books, reporting for which began around the turn of the millennium. Those two books—Live from New York and Those Guys Have All the Fun—were histories of Saturday Night Live and ESPN, respectively. Saturday Night Live is, of course, a television show, and ESPN a network. Both were born in the ’70s and both became world-famous brands. CAA was also a child of the ’70s, and while its initials are not as well-known as SNL’s or ESPN’s, CAA’s breadth and scope are far greater than either.\n\n…\n\nSo I went over there to meet him, and he introduced me to Jack Gilardi, who was married to Annette Funicello of the Mouseketeers. We sat there in Gilardi’s office for a while, and then he stood up and said, “Well, okay, let us know when you get work.” I was kind of amused by that. Three days later, I got the Saturday Night Live job and completely forgot to call him back and say I got work. What a drag. RON MEYER: Marty had gotten us into the film business when he came over, and we all had made the decision that when the TV business was strong enough that it was generating serious revenues, Mike and I would focus entirely on the movie business, and that’s what happened starting late in 1979.\n\n…\n\nI signed Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Albert Brooks, and many others, and for the next two years, all we did was put comedies together. Here’s the killer: Everyone scoffed at us. We got bad press. Sue Mengers laughed at us. She didn’t want any of these people. Old-fashioned and arrogant movie businesspeople were saying movies like Meatballs and Caddyshack would fail, and that movies with Saturday Night Live people in them wouldn’t work because, as they said, “Why would people pay to see things they could see for free?!” There was even an article calling us idiots. I’ll tell you when people all of a sudden woke up: They woke up on Stripes.

Blige, Stephen Baldwin, Paris Hilton, Anna Wintour, and NBA star Kevin Garnett, as well as Cochran. J.Lo was notably absent, fueling rumors that her relationship with Combs was on the skids, but Combs’s publicist explained that she was hosting Saturday Night Live that same night. Nevertheless, Combs made certain her presence was felt—just as if she were in the front row. In the printed show program, he dedicated the show to her: “Jennifer, thanks for showing me life.” J.Lo also made an unexpected cameo in the video reel that ran throughout the fashion show, projected on a huge screen as the backdrop for the runway.\n\n…\n\nThe hip-hop kids went nuts when they saw rapper LL Cool J decked out in one onstage. Rapper Grand Puba wore a dark green Tommy jacket and Tommy T-shirt on his 2000 CD cover. Then came the ka-ching! moment in 1994, when Snoop Dogg wore a rugby shirt with TOMMY across the front and HILFIGER across the back on Saturday Night Live. Retailers from coast to coast called the following Monday morning begging for those rugbys. Tommy was officially on fire. Hip-Hop Santa Claus Such fortuitous plugs were part organic, part staged, and worth millions of dollars in publicity—and cost the company hardly anything. It was the power of the giveaway, peddled by Tommy’s brother Andy Hilfiger, who was living in East Harlem, working as a lighting man for rock bands and music videos.\n\n…\n\nCheeky, with an edgy, asymmetrical haircut, Siriano became famous for his sassy lexicon: “fierce” for ultracool, and “you’re a hot tranny mess” when your look isn’t working. Siriano became the youngest winner and the biggest breakout star of Project Runway since the show’s inception in 2004. Actress Amy Poehler played him in a Project Runway parody called “Fierce: The Hot Mess Makeover Show” on Saturday Night Live, while Siriano, as a guest star on the sitcom Ugly Betty, hammed it up playing himself, making his entrance with three dolled-up models, declaring, “The house of Siriano has arrived. Worship me, bitches!” Siriano’s fame emanated from his mass-market relatability—that was out of reach to new designers too bland or anonymous to be well known.\n\nNothing But Net by Mark Mahaney\n\nAirbnb, AltaVista, Amazon Web Services, AOL-Time Warner, augmented reality, autonomous vehicles, Big Tech, Black Swan, Burning Man, buy and hold, Cambridge Analytica, Chuck Templeton: OpenTable:, cloud computing, COVID-19, cryptocurrency, discounted cash flows, disintermediation, diversification, don't be evil, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, financial engineering, gamification, gig economy, global pandemic, Google Glasses, Jeff Bezos, John Zimmer (Lyft cofounder), knowledge economy, lockdown, low interest rates, Lyft, Marc Andreessen, Mark Zuckerberg, Mary Meeker, medical malpractice, meme stock, Network effects, PageRank, pets.com, ride hailing / ride sharing, Salesforce, Saturday Night Live, shareholder value, short squeeze, Silicon Valley, Skype, Snapchat, social graph, Steve Jobs, stocks for the long run, subscription business, super pumped, the rule of 72, TikTok, Travis Kalanick, Uber and Lyft, uber lyft\n\nIt started generating 20%+ premium revenue growth for over a decade starting in 2009, with an accelerating number of new subscribers every year from 2009 to 2019—with the exception of 2011–2012, when a completely botched effort to materially raise fees and spin off its DVD business (the Qwikster catastrophe) stunted subscriber and revenue growth for 12 months (see Table 5.1). Harvard Business School was going to do a case study on the Qwikster disaster, but Saturday Night Live beat them to the punch with one of the greatest corporate spoof skits of all time. Netflix streaming became so successful that it caused arguably the world’s greatest entertainment company (Disney) to completely upend its business model in search of streaming (Disney+). And NFLX became the single best performing stock of the decade.\n\n…\n\nThis ended up being the “New Coke” moment of the Internet era—a horrifically botched product decision. The result was subscriber outrage, the loss of 800,000 customers during the September 2011 quarter, and damage to the brand that took over a year to repair. When the company announced that 800,000 sub loss on October 24, 2011, the stock tanked 35% in one day from $17 to $11. Saturday Night Live did a wonderful satire of this, cementing this fiasco into the tech history books. A few months after the Qwikster fiasco, I had dinner with one of the Netflix board members. I asked him how the board could have signed off on what seemed like—with 20/20 hindsight—such a terrible idea. His response illustrated the power of founders.\n\n…\n\nS&P, 281t, 282t and pricing power flywheel, 194–197, 195f product innovation, 119–123 and Qwikster, 206–208 revenue, 97–102 rise of, 5 sell-offs

Would Albrecht like to buy 25 percent of the Improv in New York for twenty-five thousand dollars? Albrecht borrowed money from his grandmother and bought in. He was in the right place at the right time. In 1975, Saturday Night Live debuted on NBC and turned into a national phenomenon. A new wave of young comedians from SNL and National Lampoon frequently came by the Improv to perform and party. Albrecht played the accommodating host to John Belushi, Andy Kaufman, Gilda Radner, and Garrett Morris. It was a bacchanalian, anything-goes scene, fueled by liquor and cocaine.\n\n…\n\nTo help him get back on his feet, HBO signed the comedian to a development contract, which paid the comedian “somewhere between fifteen thousand and twenty-five thousand dollars,” according to Albrecht. Rock returned to the clubs and kept refining his material. In 1990, Rock was invited to join the cast of Saturday Night Live, his biggest job yet. But SNL was just entering a boorish phase, one that would be dominated for the next several years by blunt physical comics like Chris Farley and Adam Sandler playing loutish, thickheaded simpletons. The things that made Rock a growing legend in comedy clubs—brutally honest dissections of race, and gender, and money—had little place on the show, and he was largely relegated to the sidelines.\n\n…\n\nThe things that made Rock a growing legend in comedy clubs—brutally honest dissections of race, and gender, and money—had little place on the show, and he was largely relegated to the sidelines. HBO quickly proved to be a much better forum for Rock’s particular talents. For viewers and critics who mainly knew him for his brief goofy segments on Saturday Night Live, Rock’s 1994 stand-up performance on HBO was a revelation. For Rock and HBO, it was just the start of big things to come. * * * • • • IN THE SPRING OF 1995, Michael Fuchs received a big promotion at Time Warner. Gerald Levin, now the chairman of the entire mega-conglomerate, announced that Fuchs would be taking over as the new head of Warner Music, by far the largest record company in the world.\n\nOriginals: How Non-Conformists Move the World by Adam Grant\n\n\"World Economic Forum\" Davos, Abraham Maslow, Albert Einstein, Apple's 1984 Super Bowl advert, availability heuristic, barriers to entry, behavioural economics, Bluma Zeigarnik, business process, business process outsourcing, Cass Sunstein, classic study, clean water, cognitive dissonance, creative destruction, cuban missile crisis, Daniel Kahneman / Amos Tversky, Dean Kamen, double helix, Elon Musk, emotional labour, fear of failure, Firefox, George Santayana, Ignaz Semmelweis: hand washing, information security, Jeff Bezos, Jeff Hawkins, job satisfaction, job-hopping, Joseph Schumpeter, Kevin Roose, Kickstarter, Lean Startup, Louis Pasteur, Mahatma Gandhi, Mark Zuckerberg, meta-analysis, minimum viable product, Neil Armstrong, Nelson Mandela, Network effects, off-the-grid, PalmPilot, pattern recognition, Paul Graham, Peter Thiel, Ralph Waldo Emerson, random walk, risk tolerance, Rosa Parks, Saturday Night Live, Sheryl Sandberg, Silicon Valley, Skype, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Steven Pinker, TED Talk, The Wisdom of Crowds, women in the workforce\n\nIf you think, “That can’t possibly work because that producer doesn’t have enough experience, or no idea like that has ever worked”—if you have those kinds of roadblocks in your head, you’re going to miss something. One of the best things that I had going for me was the fact that I had never developed a primetime situation comedy, but I was accustomed to offbeat, off-kilter ideas. I could see what worked, and what didn’t work. The time I spent reading Saturday Night Live scripts made me more open to the offbeat storylines that are now legendary on Seinfeld. This unique combination of broad and deep experience is critical for creativity. In a recent study comparing every Nobel Prize–winning scientist from 1901 to 2005 with typical scientists of the same era, both groups attained deep expertise in their respective fields of study.\n\n…\n\nThen, instead of hiding Dalio’s shortcomings or attacking the author of the note, Bridgewater’s co-CEO copied the email trail to the entire company so that everyone could learn from the exchange. In many organizations, people give negative feedback only behind closed doors. As Jack Handey advised in one of his “Deep Thoughts” on Saturday Night Live, before you criticize people, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way, when you criticize them, you’re a mile away and you have their shoes. At Bridgewater, employees are expected to voice concerns and critiques directly to each other. “Don’t let ‘loyalty’ stand in the way of truth and openness,” Dalio writes in the principles.\n\n…\n\nBridgewater has prevented groupthink: Personal interviews with Zack Wieder and Mark Kirby, June 24, 2014; personal interviews with Zack Wieder, January 12, February 9 and 16, and April 16, 2015; personal interviews with Ray Dalio, July 31, 2014, and February 12, 2015; and many hours of additional interviews, observations, videos, and cases from current and former Bridgewater employees between June 2014 and January 2015; Ray Dalio, “Principles,” www.bwater.com/home/culture—principles.aspx; Robert Kegan, Lisa Lahey, Andy Fleming, and Matthew Miller, “Making Business Personal,” Harvard Business Review, April 2014, 45–52; Kevin Roose, “Pursuing Self-Interest in Harmony with the Laws of the Universe and Contributing to Evolution Is Universally Rewarded,” New York Magazine, April 10, 2001, http://nymag.com/news/business/wallstreet/ray-dalio-2011-4/; Jeffrey T.

(Although there’s one source of energy that may well outcompete fossil fuels in three to five decades—stay tuned.) A brilliant illustration of this appeared on, of all places, Saturday Night Live a few years ago. The host of the “Weekend Update” segment at the time, Jimmy Fallon, commented on a plan to use oil derived from hazelnuts to power a car. I have no doubt that this could work technically—vegetable oil and petroleum oil are extremely similar chemically. But I wasn’t excited, and neither was Fallon: New Scientist magazine reported that in the future, cars could be powered by hazelnuts.\n\n…\n\nMilton Friedman and Rose Friedman, Free to Choose: A Personal Statement (San Diego: Harcourt Brace, 1980), 148. 7.

It had The Today Show in the morning, The Tonight Show in the evening, an unbeatable lineup of sitcoms for Thursday night, and Saturday Night Live every weekend. For some of that time it also showed Major League Baseball, NFL football, NBA basketball, and the Olympics. The network earned its ratings by pushing the boundaries of television: Miami Vice brought MTV visuals to the police drama, Hill Street Blues incorporated gritty realism, and Seinfeld brought self-awareness to sitcoms at a time when most half-hour shows still ended with a hug.\n\n…\n\nThese shows made NBC one of the most profitable divisions of General Electric,1 to which the network returned $800 million in profit in 2003.2 In 2010—just seven years later—the network expected to lose more than $100 million.3 When Comcast agreed to acquire 51 percent of NBC Universal, it was mostly interested in the company’s cable channels—Bravo, Syfy, and others.4 The proposed deal assigned the broadcast network an on-paper value of zero.5 As NBC has faltered, other companies that rely on its programming have thrived. In early 2006, more than five million people watched the famous “Lazy Sunday” Saturday Night Live sketch on YouTube, which was bought for $1.65 billion by Google later that year.6 Heroes, one of the network’s recent hits, became one of the most popular shows on file-sharing services.7 And telecom companies built empires selling bandwidth that lets consumers download or stream pirated television shows without commercials.\n\n…\n\nYouTube is now considered a respectable business, the go-to Web site for viral videos, independent art, and even presidential speeches. But the site became famous—and attracted enough viewers to be sold to Google for $1.65 billion in November 2006—partly for hosting copyrighted clips like music videos and the famous “Lazy Sunday” skit from Saturday Night Live. Although YouTube’s motto is “Broadcast Yourself,” the site used to show plenty of content to which it didn’t have rights. And the company has been sued for copyright infringement by Viacom, as well as by several other companies. “I don’t think anyone anticipated something like YouTube,” says Verizon’s Sarah Deutsch, whose company obviously also benefited from the law.\n\nGonzo: The Life of Hunter S.

It was wonderful to witness this, but it wasn’t conversation like the old days. It was a monologue. Nobody could match those stories, or the personality behind them. LAILA NABULSI was a production assistant on Saturday Night Live in 1976. John Belushi was my best friend. One night just before the show I went into John’s dressing room—it was just a little room with a couch—and someone was lying there. I could see the shorts and the long legs and the sneakers. It could have been the pot dealer. You never knew who was going to be around.\n\n…\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT Wreckage in the Fast Lane Hunter was working on Songs of the Doomed and got in a fight with his editor over some insanely minor point. He went ballistic in the middle of the night and destroyed a typewriter—just beat it to death with a phone. There was metal Selectric shrapnel flying all over the kitchen. LAILA NABULSI Every year at Saturday Night Live they had a Seder. Being Palestinian, I never went. But one year Paul Schaffer made me go, and Bill Murray came running up to me and said, “Oh, my God—you’re alive! I talked to Hunter last night, and he said he heard you were dead. He’s staying at the Coconut Grove Hotel in Miami.” I started laughing and said, “Well, thanks.\n\n…\n\nMITCH GLAZER was a twenty-two-year-old writer for Crawdaddy when he met Hunter through John Belushi. Hunter’s presence is so strong that it fucks actors up. When they do him, an interesting thing happens. I was around Billy a lot right after he did Where the Buffalo Roam. I’d see him do sketches on Saturday Night Live and not be able to shake Hunter. People were coming and talking to him about it. And then when we did Scrooged, years later, there were still scenes where I’d see Billy doing Hunter. The difference between Murray and Belushi or Hunter is that Billy would take no for an answer. They wouldn’t.\n\nTough Sh*t: Life Advice From a Fat, Lazy Slob Who Did Good by Kevin Smith\n\ndo what you love, glass ceiling, Kickstarter, McJob, Saturday Night Live, short selling, zero-sum game\n\nOne sounds like it should be banned in a few countries, the other sounds like you could take your grandma to see it. I’d argue that we didn’t need primetime spots, anyway, because the hard-core subject matter meant the mallrats couldn’t even buy tickets to something else and sneak into our flick. One night, while watching Saturday Night Live, the spot that ran wasn’t even for Zack and Miri Make a Porno. It was straight-up Zack and Miri. Friends who marketed for competing studios would send me e-mails warning against the almost weekly changes in the selling approach. They said it was clear we were searching for a story, but if we didn’t pick one, we couldn’t educate the public about the concept.\n\n…\n\nSo even though we were a church-every-Sunday Catholic family of five, here was my father suborning subversion. And with good reason: As I spun Class Clown for the first time, I was transfixed. This man Carlin spoke the truth, but more important, he was hysterical while doing so—a funny prophet. FM & AM and Class Clown became as memorized and shared in my world as any Monty Python routine or Saturday Night Live sketch. And in the Catholic school world of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, being able to quote a Carlin bit was pure pop-culture currency. In 1982, HBO aired the Carlin at Carnegie stand-up special. A commercial for the premiere featured a clip of Carlin talking about the clichéd warning to criminals, “Don’t try anything funny …” “When they’re not looking,” he added mischievously, “I like to go …” BOOM!\n\n…\n\nI was staying at the Bel Age Hotel off Sunset. My Friday was devoted to rehearsing with Rock, interviewing with USA Today, and maybe seeing my ex-girlfriend for dinner. Rock came over around noon, and we ran through the entire script together for two hours, stopping only to have getting-to-know-you chitchat about pussy and Saturday Night Live. I said I was hoping to have dinner with my ex-girlfriend, which Rock insisted was a bad idea. She’d moved on, he guessed; better to instead just get laid in L.A. by anybody but my ex—that way, I’d get on with my life. We all know Chris Rock’s hysterical, but few realize he’s also pretty insightful when it comes to relationships.\n\nSarah Millican--The Queen of Comedy by Tina Campanella\n\ncall centre, Desert Island Discs, fake news, Russell Brand, Saturday Night Live, side project, Skype, Stephen Fry, upwardly mobile\n\nNotorious comedy drinkers have included dark poet Bill Hicks, who was described as a ‘hard-drinking, chain-smoking ball of angry energy’, and Animal House bad boy John Belushi, whose manic comic presence many agree was mainly fuelled by his propensity for alcohol. In 2006 it was widely reported that Robin Williams checked himself into rehab to deal with his addiction to alcohol, which had become all-consuming for the comedian and actor. American Saturday Night Live cast member Tracy Morgan’s struggles with alcohol have also been well documented. He was reportedly arrested for drink driving in both California and New York and even had to wear a SCRAM – a Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitoring – device for nearly 150 days to try and save him from the perils of over-boozing.\n\n…\n\nShe decided to call herself The Sea Monster, to preempt the inevitable abuse about her weight, but still faced, during her early appearances on the alternative comedy circuit, having a pint of beer thrown at her, having her face slapped and being pelted with food. Despite that, she persevered and by the late 1980s, had a regular slot on Channel 4’s Saturday Night Live, which had been started a few years earlier as a springboard on to TV for alternative comedians. She then went on to have her own show, Through The Cakehole, and thereafter made regular appearances on panel shows through the 1990s and into the noughties. The fact that Jo, a large woman with a laid-back laconic style, could survive in the quick-fire world of male-dominated comedy, proved a spur for many woman who looked at her and said to themselves, ‘If she can do it, maybe I can too’.\n\n…\n\nIn 1970s America, during the country’s last bad recession, comedians were king. The stand-ups of the time, like Robin Williams, Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby, were among the first to make the move from the theatre to film and television. Many others began appearing on mainstream TV, on late night shows like The Tonight Show or Saturday Night Live. While these programmes were incredibly popular when they first started, eventually the audience began to tire of seeing the same old formats and increasingly similar jokes. The comedians listed above made millions in the 1970s and 80s. With a handful making so much, soon, everyone was wondering if they could make a fortune as a stand-up.\n\nThe Red and the Blue: The 1990s and the Birth of Political Tribalism by Steve Kornacki\n\naffirmative action, Alan Greenspan, Alvin Toffler, American Legislative Exchange Council, Berlin Wall, computer age, David Brooks, Donald Trump, employer provided health coverage, ending welfare as we know it, facts on the ground, Future Shock, illegal immigration, immigration reform, junk bonds, low interest rates, mass immigration, off-the-grid, Oklahoma City bombing, power law, Ralph Nader, Robert Bork, Ronald Reagan, Saturday Night Live, Savings and loan crisis, The Bell Curve by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, Thomas L Friedman, Timothy McVeigh, trickle-down economics, union organizing, War on Poverty, women in the workforce\n\nWhen Mitchell appeared on Meet the Press at the end of March and said he’d like to be president someday, but not in 1992, David Broder called it the unofficial start of the 1996 campaign. Since “the odds now strongly suggest” a Bush win in ’92, Broder argued, the smart play for Democrats was to sit out the cycle and wait for an open seat four years later. Soon enough it was fodder for Saturday Night Live, which aired a send-up of a Democratic presidential debate. Instead of spoofing the actual candidates running, the sketch—titled “The Race to Avoid Being the Guy Who Loses to Bush”—featured all the noncandidates pleading with their party to choose someone, anyone other than them. Mario Cuomo won a third term in 1990 and raised eyebrows by refusing during the campaign to rule out a White House bid.\n\n…\n\nFour commentators from across the spectrum would analyze a series of topics while McLaughlin, seated in the moderator’s chair, listened impatiently, pouncing at any opinion he deemed ill supported. The pace was quick, the arguments intense, and the energy frenetic. McLaughlin was the star, but Buchanan was along for the ride, too, a fixture in the rightmost seat. Hundreds of stations began carrying the show, and by the end of the decade Saturday Night Live was parodying it, with Dana Carvey playing McLaughlin and Phil Hartman as Buchanan. Without ever running for office, Buchanan had become one of the best-known conservatives in America. He looked at the Republican presidential race in 1988, but chose not to enter. The field was crowded and he would have had lots of company on the right.\n\n…\n\nLiberals and gay groups had Clinton’s back, and found some surprise allies here and there, including the now eighty-four-year-old Barry Goldwater, who said he had no problem with gay soldiers as long as “they shoot straight.” Christian conservatives, meanwhile, were joining forces with veterans groups. The Southern Baptist Convention, the American Legion, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars pooled their resources to launch a campaign to keep the ban in place. The debate entered popular culture. Saturday Night Live featured a sketch set in the Civil War about a fictitious all-gay unit, “the Gloria Brigade,” a collection of effeminate men who minced around their encampment talking about fashion and design and trading catty insults.
