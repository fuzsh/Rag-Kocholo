1. outline

One of a kind of cube puzzle . Larry Nichols first invented it, but never patented it.

Also known as pocket cubes or mini cubes. It is a cube divided into 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 blocks with two blocks per side. [1] All blocks are made of corner pieces , so the matching solution is also simple. See the 2×2×2 cube solution document for the solution .

The size is 50mm for cubes coming out these days, and Rubiks brand products or Dayen 's mini 2×2×2 cubes are 46mm.

2. world record

Since the minimum rotation is 4 rotations and the maximum rotation is 11 rotations, if you know how to rotate the cube 4 times to make it fit, the next step is a quick hand fight.

single

Teodor Zajder's 0.43 seconds

Guanbo Wang's time of 0.47 seconds, which no one expected to break, was broken.

The average world record is 1.01 seconds by Zayn Khanani.

3. etc

Because it's simple, there are a lot of products with things like Homer Simpson, Gundam, and Hello Kitty on the surface. If you mix them, your face will break into pieces. It's scary. Hello Carbot!

When opened, the structure is identical to that of a 3×3×3 cube . After making a spherical 3×3×3 cube, make the corner pieces larger to cover the entire cube. However, some pieces are stuck together, which makes it impossible to rotate the middle layer of a 3x3x3 cube. The structure to which this piece is attached is the same as the Fused Cube, a type of Bandage Cube.

In addition, the 2×2 that came out in the past has a rail structure covering the corners on top of a round cross core similar to a ball core. ( # ) In this case, corner cutting is not possible and jamming is very severe. Like a 6x6 or larger big cube, the rows and columns must fit together to rotate. Shinkwangsa Edison and Wolseong Industrial Co. are representative rail structures of 2×2 . In particular, Wolseong 2×2 is known as the most annoying cube when spinning Edison, Rubiks, and Nobel 3×3, and Shingwangsa Edison boasts an insane rotational power of 1000 degrees .

In the United States , it is also made with paper and thread.

When you bring it to school, your friends say they will match the newborn baby, but you can't match the cube~~ Is this real?

As an aside, Bandai once made a 2X2X2 cube with the head of the Strike Gundam . When using it as a cube, remove the horn, which is a fixture, and turn it.

It is a surprisingly helpful tool if you study substitution of symmetric groups . In the first place, the Twisty puzzle itself is an example of a symmetric group materialized.

In addition to the 3×3×3 cube, it is often combined with other cubes.

Representative examples include Super Z combined with Scube, Super X combined with Dino Cube, and Clover Plus combined with Clover Cube.

4. Recommended cube for speed cubing

After the highest record in 2016, the popularity of the 2×2×2 cube event itself waned, and a dark period continued, such as no new products being released for a while. It is also showing signs of recovery, such as launching a new 2×2×2 product.

4.1. QiYi

4.1.1. Valk 2m

It has the best reviews.

It is currently in a discontinued state.

4.1.2. XMD Flare

It is said that the speed of the cube is fast.

4.2. MoYu

4.2.1. Waypo WRM

4.2.2. RS2M evolution

It is rated as very good value for money at an affordable price.

The sound is not loud compared to other cubes.

4.3. YJ

4.3.1. MGC ELITE

Among the 2x2 cubes, in terms of performance, it forms the two major mountain ranges with the GAN 251m Pro.

Usually, I recommend this cube a lot because of the price.

4.3.2. MGC

J Perm's main cube.

It is a very good cube for beginners, and many people use it as a main.

4.4. GAN

There is the 251m series and it shows quite decent performance.

There are Air, Pro, and Leap series, and I usually buy a lot of Pro versions.

Along with YJ's MGC Elite, it has the best performance among 2x2 cubes.

There is an older version called GAN 251 m.

discontinued

Additionally, GAN 251 V2, GAN 249 V2

There is

Neither of them have magnets, so I don’t recommend them.

4.5. Dayan

4.5.1. Tengyun m

Cube praised by J Perm .

4.5.2. Tengyun plus m

5. 2x2x2 cube solution

There are LBL, XLL (Otega), CLL (EG-0), and EG solutions.

Of these, EG is the fastest.

And because the EG solution is easy to use with 1 LOOKING, famous 222 cubers use the EG solution.

Fastest in the following order: EG > CLL (EG-0) > XLL (Otega) > LBL

5.1. Ortega (XLL)

This is the first solution you learn once you know how to put together a 2x2x2 cube.

step is

1. Layer (match the bottom to the color of the side)

2. OLL (matching the top to the color of the side)

3. PBL (Fit Entire Cube)

Consists of

If you know how to do it to some extent, you can do color neutral (matching the bottom color regardless), OLL prediction, and additional PBL memorization.

There are 12 formulas in total, and if you already know the 2Look CFOP solution, you only need to memorize a total of 4 formulas, 1 formula in OLL and 3 formulas in PBL.

It is classified as an advanced solution, but the difficulty is very easy because there are few formulas to memorize, and you can think of it as an intermediate solution before learning the EG solution.

5.2. EG

Depending on the condition of the bottom, it is divided into EG-0 (CLL), EG-1, and EG-2.

The official number is 128 in total.

In addition, there is a LEG-1 with the bar of EG-1 on the left.

All of the world's cubers use the EG solution.

Among the EG solutions, EG-2 is made into EG-0 (CLL) with the R2 F2 R2 move.

You can use it, or you can use the short formula R2 F2 R2 after doing ANTI CLL, so there is no need to memorize it.

There are so many formulas that it may be difficult to memorize them.

For EG-2, if you do R2 F2 R2 after ANTI CLL, there is no need to memorize the formula, so 0

There is a mirrored formula among EG-0 and EG-1.

Excluding these, there are approximately 60.

5.3. CLL(EG-0)

It is faster than the Otega solution, but slower than the EG solution.

1. Match the bottom (the color of the sides must also match).

2. Match OLL and PLL simultaneously with the CLL formula.

[1] Total number of pieces is 8
