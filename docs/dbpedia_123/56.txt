The 2x2 Rubik's Cube, also known as the Pocket Cube or Mini Cube, is a smaller version of the classic 3x3 Rubik's Cube. It consists of 8 corner pieces without any edge or center pieces.

A 2x2 cube has only 8 corner pieces, while a 3x3 cube has 8 corner pieces, 12 edge pieces, and 6 center pieces. The solving process for a 2x2 cube is simpler and quicker compared to a 3x3 cube.

The basic steps include solving the first layer, orienting the last layer, and then permuting the last layer pieces into their correct positions (to solve a 2x2 using the beginners method you need to learn less than 10 algorithms in total).

Advanced methods include the Ortega Method and the CLL (Corners of the Last Layer) Method, which allow for faster solving times. You can also learn EG-1 and EG-2

In Ortega we orientate one layer (not worrying if the pieces are in the correct spot), then we orientate the top layer, we then permute the top and bottom corners in one go. In total we need 12 algorithms to solve using Ortega.

The CLL Method involves solving the first layer and then using a set of algorithms to solve the entire last layer in one step, focusing only on corner pieces.

Lookahead involves planning your next moves while executing the current ones. To practice, try solving the cube slowly while focusing on tracking the pieces' positions and planning subsequent moves.

No, parity errors are specific to larger cubes like the 4x4 and 5x5. The 2x2 cube does not have parity errors because it only consists of corner pieces.

If your cube appears unsolvable, it might have been disassembled and reassembled incorrectly. Ensure all pieces are correctly oriented and positioned before solving.

Regularly clean and lubricate your cube to ensure smooth turning. Adjust the tension of the screws if necessary to optimize performance. We recommend using KewbzUK Lubricant such as Dash or Blitz in your 2x2.
