[edit]Permutations[]

[1][2][3]Pocket Cube in different forms. From top (to bottom): i. Solved pocket cube. ii. Scrambled pocket cube.

iii.P ocket cube with one side tilted.

Any permutation of the eight corners is possible (8! positions), and seven of them can be independently rotated (37 positions). There is nothing identifying the orientationof the cube in space, reducing the positions by a factor of 24. This is because all 24 possible positions and orientations of the first corner are equivalent due to the lack of fixed centers. This factor does not appear when calculating the permutations of N×N×N cubes where N is odd, since those puzzles have fixed centers which identify the cube's spatial orientation. The number of possible positions of the cube is 3,674,160.

The maximum number of turns required to solve the cube is up to 11 full turns, or up to 14 quarter turns.[1]

The number f of positions that require n full twists and number q of positions that require n quarter turn twists are:

n f q 0 1 1 1 9 6 2 54 27 3 321 120 4 1847 534 5 9992 2256 6 50136 8969 7 227536 33058 8 870072 114149 9 1887748 360508 10 623800 930588 11 2644 1350852 12 0 782536 13 0 90280 14 0 276

Maciej Czapiewski holds the current world record of solving the Pocket Cube in competition, with a time of 0.49 seconds set at the Grudziądz Open 2016.2][3] For the best average time of 5 solves, Feliks Zemdegs holds the world record with a time of 2.12 seconds set at Melbourne Cube day 2010.[3]

[edit]Variants[]

At Rubik's online store, an easier version of the Pocket Cube exists, dubbed the "Junior Cube". This version has only two colors, with a picture of a monkey on one face.

The Rubik's Ice Cube is a version of the Pocket Cube with transparent plastic and translucent stickers. It comes with a clear blue, ice-like display base.

The Eastsheen company produces a variation as well. It has a different turning mechanism and is noticeably larger (5 cm (2.0 in)) than the original.

Verdes Innovations has released the V-Cube 2, which is available in two shapes. The flat-sided V-Cube 2 is roughly the same size as the Eastsheen cube. The V-Cube 2b has a rounded shape like the V-Cube 7.

[edit]Methods[]

The most common beginner method is a layer-by-layer solution. Popular methods among speedcubers are: Ortega, Cll, Guimond and EG. Links can be found on the bottom of this page.
