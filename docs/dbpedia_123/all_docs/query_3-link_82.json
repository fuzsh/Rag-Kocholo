        "text": "\"I-I love the idea of building it in the giant's Rubik cube, I think that... the Rubik's cube does sort of... I dunno, it just works really well for Minecraft and it's just... quite a cool place for... it to be in. And there's no real reason, because... like, this game doesn't have anything to do with Rubik's cubes, it's just... I dunno, it just kind of works with the different colours of the teams, I guess, is sort of... uh, th-the best way to make it relevant, but... it's more just a cool-looking thing, you know?\" â€” Stampy on his motive for making the sheep-shearing mini-game inside of a giant Rubik's cube.\n\n\"Giant Rubix Cube\" is the 87th episode of Stampy's Lovely World. In this episode, Stampy and his helpers continue building a sheep-shearing mini-game.\n\nPlot[]\n\nEnder dragon-squid-robin-bear hybrid thingy[]\n\nStampy opens the episode, introducing another time where he doesn't seem to have a Sun in his world, anticipating it to be rising before remembering that it's on the opposite side. Returning back into his bedroom, Stampy introduces L for Leeeee x, frogangel666, and Afro Dan91, who he notes to be dressed as an ender dragon, all three of them entering via the left door, as well as iBallisticSquid, who Stampy finds to be doing a \"dramatic\" entrance by dropping through his bedroom ceiling, admiring it as a \"Mission Impossible\" style of entrance. Everyone joins together in the far right corner of Stampy's bedroom by Stampy's order, and Stampy tries to fit iBallisticSquid in with them all. He advises him to sprint in, noting everyone's skin being combined as \"a weird ender dragon-squid-robin bear mixture\", asking if they could line their faces up. Stampy sees the amalgamation of characters as \"weird\", deciding he should join in with the chaos himself, finding the inside of someone else's skin to be a weird sight. With L for Leeeee x being the only one left out, Stampy urges him to enter, only for him to be physically unable to as he sees the amalgamation of himself and his helpers from the third-person perspective.\n\nIn regards to the actual episode itself, Stampy decides he has to actually get on with the video, though not before eating a cake that L for Leeeee x had placed down as he has to eat due to it being part of a \"5-a-day\", as in \"5 cakes that he has per day\". Stampy excuses that he has cherries on top of the cake and that it makes the cake healthy, or at least it's what he he tells his parents. Stampy proceeds to his Love Garden, explaining that it's a place where he gives someone a shoutout for something, and he is giving a shoutout to \"MCmiricle\", who is a YouTuber like him, as well as a map builder, having built the Walls map he had played with iBallisticSquid, as well as an adventure map that he will also play, which should eventually be seen on his channel. Taking entry into the doghouse, Stampy suddenly drops down into a pit trap set at the entrance to the doghouse, realising it came from L for Leeeeee x, wondering why he trapped him. Stampy is now stuck, and asks if someone has a rope to let him out of the trap. Stampy wonders if it's retribution for him not being allowed in the corner, eventually escaping along with iBallisticSquid who had also fallen down with him.\n\nNow out of the trap, Stampy says that he had forgotten the topic he was discussing previously, apologising for if it was interesting, though he doubts it was due to it being said by him. Stampy sees the doghouse area is empty, wondering where his dogs went, speculating them to have somewhere where they have parties, deciding to take Barnaby, defining him as the one who has the red collar on. Stampy sees iBallisticSquid on the bridge within the doghouse having drunk multiple potions, and he asks him to share the bottle with everyone. Stampy then supplies himself with porkchops due to lacking some in current time, recalling when he actually built the system and was proud of the redstone, even though it's simply a trail of redstone from button to dispenser, happy that he had actually made something work, though he hasn't got much better but still continues to try to be adventurous, needing a redstone expert to accomplish even that, however.\n\nVisiting his minecart track, Stampy takes out a minecart and places it down on the track as he explains that he is building what he was in the last video, and upon seeing Barnaby block the minecart, he offers him to take the one has only to decide to just use the one he is currently using instead, eventually journeying over to the next station as he explains he was building a giant Rubik's cube in the previous episode, and has now finished the full structure with assistance from L for Leeeee x, meaning the main Rubik's cube is now finished on the exterior.\n\nShowing the finished Rubik's cube & starting the team platforms[]\n\nArriving at Stampy's Funland, he continues that in regards to the interior, he will start building it in the present episode for a sheep-shearing mini-game, which he tries to describe in the previous episode in absolute detail. However, he thinks he explained it badly, and will just build it and play it upon completion, since it's not even a proper mini-game and it's something he had just created for himself, though he likes it that way due to it being more original, though he thinks someone would've already built something similar. In the distance, Stampy walks over to the finished Rubik's cube exterior, admiring how it looks, though he wishes there weren't torches on it as it ruins the design. However, he thinks it looks appealing lit up at night regardless. Stampy shows each side of the cube from the sides, showing the front blue, the left red, the back yellow, the right green, to which Stampy comments that it's annoying how only two sides can be seen at a time. When above it, however, there is a better view, additionally stating that the top is orange and the bottom is white.\n\nOn the interior, Stampy sees that Afro Dan91 is halfway through writing \"DAN = AWESOME\" with blue wool, apologising for interrupting before he could finish. Stampy comments on how his skin is that of an ender dragon, not liking his appearance, thinking it looks weird and goofy than menacing, thinking it looks silly. Stampy assures him at the last second that it actually suits him, and then laughs at how he was given some rotten flesh by Afro Dan91 proceeding the statement. On the topic of what he will do in the episode, Stampy plans to build the majority of the interior, with platforms on the corners to serve as each team's base, and a platform in the middle to contain sheep, which he hopes should make sense eventually.\n\nBuilding team platforms for a sheep-shearing mini-game[]\n\nSeeing L for Leeeee x building a platform between the green and blue corner, Stampy decides to start building a platform in between the red and blue corner. The basic layout is going to be a platform in the middle, and Stampy starts to prepare for in case he places something incorrectly by preparing his shears, since it will be a case of trial-and-error to make it look appealing. He had a mockup prior to the video to determine its final appearance, but prefers to simply improvise. Stampy explains the basic concept in that there will be a platform on each side, checking if his platform is the same height as L for Leeeee x's. It turns out not to be, and he begins to rise it upwards. Stampy also explains that the main platform will be full of dirt, requiring him to trail dirt to the interior of the game to make it so there is grass instead of dirt, so when he gets sheep onto each platform, they will be able to eat the grass and will regrow their wool, which he finds to be cool. Stampy extends the platform up again, dismissing that his errors don't matter, and continues that he also needs a wall around the outside to confine the sheep, planning to have a two-block high barrier to block the sheep, and will also plan to have a colour-coordinate block in the middle of each platform depending on the team so the player can jump on the block to escape. Stampy decides he should stop discussing it and allow the viewers to simply see it how it is.\n\nStampy starts to add dirt to the platform, determining the height, deciding to make the level on the third block down, or rather the fourth block up, and upon determining it, Stampy now has to surround the floor with dirt, and decides to assign the colour of the base he is building to be red since L for Leeeee x is doing the red base. He continues that the basic plan for the mini-game is that each player starts in a corner with one sheep to shear immediately, and then make a debate between staying for the sheep to grow its wool, or jump to the middle platform where there will be a gap. The platform in question will contain four-to-five sheep that have to be dyed the sheep's colour so they can then be sheared in order to gain 15 pieces of wool, and then nerdpole up with said wool to press a button in order to trigger a tune with note blocks, establishing the player has won. The challenge primarily comes to whether or not the player wants to dye their sheep immediately, or save it so another player doesn't override the sheep pattern, an explanation he hopes should make sense eventually.\n\nNow having completed the basic design of the platform, Stampy adds red wool to the middle with a raised area. This assures that the sheep can't escape while the player can jump on top of the edge and escape, which he attempts to demonstrate the abilities of, failing completely. Stampy sees L for Leeeee x designing his platform with the bottom extending all the way to the floor, which Stampy tells L for Leeeee x not to do as to make the platforms simply float, and make the only access point the ladder. He proceeds to regain his health via porkchops, giving Barnaby one as well, and then plans for a platform to be in every corner. To accomplish this, Stampy decides he should demonstrate via the main platform he is doing to complete this task quickly by having his helpers copy him. Stampy plans to have a checked pattern, like L for Leeeee x is demonstrating, admiring how the mini-game is in a giant Rubik's cube in how it works well for Minecraft and is a cool place for the mini-game to be in. Stampy clarifies that there isn't an actual reason for the design choice as it is unrelated to Rubik's cubes, and it works with the team's different colours, though it's more a simple cool structure. Stampy sees most of his blocks being filled in for him, and he wonders who is helping him, finding out that it's actually iBallisticSquid, having seen what he and his helpers are doing.\n\nStampy extends the platform to line up with the dirt, planning to also add a ladder in the style that L for Leeeee x has added in the form of a pillar made out of black wool. Stampy realises that he doesn't have any ladders in his possession, crafting a crafting table, commenting on the irony of how he usually places down a crafting table first upon taking entry into a particular location. Having crafted some ladders, Stampy adds them to the top, and then revises the basic concept of how each player roams the mini-game in that people enter through and climb into their bases, requiring a countdown to start. In the middle of the room, Stampy sees a tower made out of spiraling green, yellow, blue red going upwards, which he admires as the tower in the middle leading to the top. Underneath the platform, Stampy simply fills everything in with black wool due to there not being a need for a checkered pattern, informing his helpers do the same.\n\nBuilding the middle platform for a sheep-shearing mini-game[]\n\nStampy jumps onto the red base he had built and extends the platform from the middle tower out as one ring, making the player jump two forward and one up, which Stampy finds a relatively easy jump unless the player is under pressure, accounting for it as a jump he could miss easily. Stampy also advises his viewers that the player must also not die as it also means that the player is out of the game, and that the player has to be careful not to fall down, though the player can return back to the base, even with it being a risky move. Stampy crafts some ladders to lead to the platform at the top, and then notes that he can see the night outside, but thinks he will be fine on the interior and doesn't think he needs a bed, only to accidentally craft one anyway.\n\nNow with a bed, Stampy thinks to set his spawn in the event of something happening, and then continues building by crafting a set of ladders, planning for the pillar to be littered with ladders, finding it comedic to watch the possibility of his helpers clamouring to access the top. Stampy jumps back onto the tower, and then starts to add the ladders to lead up to a raised area at the top, though it won't be significantly high. Afterwards, he has to add a platform in the middle, though he is unsure what colour he should make it with, if not add any colour at all, thinking to a black ring outside with the corners corresponding to the teams. Determining the height, Stampy decides to add the platform on the fifth block, though he is unsure of how to add it and position himself on top. Stampy adds a single block, and then raises the level up to the sixth block, deciding to make the entire structure black wool to test the appearance. Seeing Afro Dan91 act cautious around the edge as he builds it, Stampy comments that, since he is en ender dragon, he can simply glide down, whiile Stampy will simply plummet down to the ground.\n\nSurrounding the main floor, Stampy explains that the platform will be bigger than the others, planning to also make the bottom completely black wool with dirt. Stampy is aware of the fact that he has to add grass, and is unsure of what possible method he could use to accomplish it as dirt will stay as dirt unless grass is next to it, meaning that they have to be next to each other for the grass to spread across. Building the platform out by three, Stampy sees Afro Dan91 attempting to push him off, which he accuses him of doing and he denies that he is doing. Stampy doesn't believe it since no one wants to be close to him, and that he knew he would try to push him off, which is why he is crouching for careful. Stampy explains that he still has the cake from the anniversary, but it doesn't work to turn people into superheroes, finding it cool if it did if everyone had superpowers for the week. Seeing the platform, Stampy decides he should expand it out by three, thinking to expand it out by four to widen it completely, only to be knocked off by Afro Dan91 and into the green team base, much to his annoyance.\n\nStampy scolds Afro Dan91 for saying that he didn't want to push him off of the platform, looking up to see him building the main platform for himself, thinking him to be annoyed because he took the tower that he created. Stampy sees everyone else's work from the position he dropped into, admiring it and saying that everyone isn't far from completing it, saying that he hopes his viewers will understand the final product of the interior. Stampy breaks open holes for players to reach the primary tower in the middle, and then hears an explosion within the structure, finding out that a creeper was the cause and informing his helpers to block off the doorway as creepers aren't allowed to join in with the mini-game. After positioning the ladders, Stampy starts to add a layer of dirt for the sheep, and the sheep will not fall down as the ladders will cause it to climb up automatically so all of the sheep will be stuck. As he is expanding the platform one more, Stampy sees Afro Dan91 acting strangely in front of him again, prompting Stampy to tell him that he doesn't trust him anymore, as he was discussing ideas for the mini-game with him before, only for him to end up pushing him off the edge of a tower in the actual video itself. Stampy wonders why his helpers are trying to bully him, since they trapped him in his doghouse and pushed him off the edge of a platform. This causes him to believe it's due to him not paying them enough and that they will go on a strike. Stampy offers bread or porkchops as a possible method of compensation, and then starts to expand on the opposite side.\n\nStampy counts each side, finding that each side has to be four out from the middle, finding one to only be three out and requiring him to expand one further. Additionally, Stampy has to build the barrier for the sheep, commenting that the platform won't look as big as it does from the exterior. Suddenly, Stampy is greeted by the sight of L for Leeeee x having brought him some cake on the primary platform, to his surprise. However, he isn't hungry to eat it, and he plans out the barrier for the platform, thinking to add it on the fourth block out. Stampy thinks to expand another layer outward, telling Afro Dan91 to continue filling the floor in with dirt while he builds one out extra for a barrier. However, he wants to do it in a different colour, doesn't have any other form of generic colours. Stampy decides to stay with black as the primary colour, and starts to build a barrier with the possible desire to replace it with any potential colours.\n\nStampy tells Afro Dan91 to fill in the floor with dirt while he adds the barrier, and then continues that the main part of the mini-game is complete, and the only necessary is to add a mechanism to signify the winner. Stampy plans to add buttons in the top corner accessed via the wool tower, and the buttons are intended to play a tune upon interaction with note blocks, set off with a dispenser to set off the note blocks underneath the ground. Stampy runs out of black wool, thinking Afro Dan91 to have run out as well due to building with red wool instead. However, he realises that he is using red as one of the few colour for the middle platform to correspond with the bases. iBallisticSquid then gives Stampy some black wool, additionally admiring Afro Dan91's intentional use of multiple colours.\n\nStampy says that the design reminds of a circus in some form, and then runs out of dirt. Upon doing so, Stampy describes there to be a barrier to keep the sheep on the main platform, though the player may be able to skirt the outer edges to get out and down, and the ladders will exceed up to where the dirt is. With all of the bases and the main platform near-completed, Stampy describes that his next priority in regards to the mini-game is to finish the unfinished sections, as well as add the note blocks system to finish it in order to play it in the by the end of the next episode.\n\nStampy goes to demonstrate how the game works in that the player will enter inside and pick a team, with him deciding yellow due to his skin, having shears in possession with one corresponding sheep to shear, after which the player can then jump up onto the platform in the middle to climb up to the platform at the top where there will be sheep to dye with the team's respective colour, and then shear them to get enough wool to climb up and reach the button. He is aware that his explanations make it sound confusing, but he himself finds it to make sense. Deeming it the end of the episode, Stampy says that he has run out of time, and then he goes to thank all of his helpers for helping him, surprised by their progress on the mini-game, and then stating once again that he has run out of time, ending the episode with the line \"So I just wanna end as I always do, by saying thank you very much for watching, and I will see you later. Byeeeeee!\"\n\nFeatures[]\n\nCharacters[]\n\nL for Leeeee x\n\nfrogangel666\n\nAfro Dan91\n\niBallisticSquid\n\nBarnaby\n\nLocations[]\n\nStampy's Funland\n\nShear Fun (unidentified)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThis episode and the episode following it, \"Shepherd Stampy\", were released on the same date of 25th May, 2013.\n\nNavigation[]"
