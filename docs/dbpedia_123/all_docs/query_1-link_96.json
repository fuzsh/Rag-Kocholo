        "text": "(Mainly transcript from video)\n\nIn the past year the amount of Speed Cubes on the market has exploded. There are a lot of new cubes on the market, so let’s compare them and see what is best for you. Now this comparison is being done in the spring of 2015. Within a few months there will most likely be another great cube on the market, and by next year we will most likely have to do a whole new video and comparison.\n\nBefore we go through these cubes I want to note that you can be a sub-10 second solver with any of these cubes. None of them will give you a huge jump in times unless you are using anything that would not be considered a “speed cube.”\n\nMost of the cubes have had their stickers replaced with my own shades from TheCubicle (Link down in the description) so I can properly test the cubes. I want to give a big thank you to TheCubicle for donating some of these cubes and allowing me to do this. Stop by their store and use discount code: SpeedCubeReview for 5% off your order.\n\nWe are going to go over\n\n1. Some cubes that are still relevant will not be in my final comparison\n\n2. Quick comparison cubes by the same company\n\n3. Overall comparison of all top cubes on the market today\n\nThe first cube will be the DaYan Zhanchi. The Zhanchi revolutionized the way cubes are made and is partially responsible for many of the great cubes that are available today. It was the cube that held the previous world record of 5.55 seconds by Mats Valk. It is a great cube but compared to the newer ones on the market it is a bit catchy.\n\nAnother cube that is relatively good, but most likely wont be seen as a main for most speedcubers is the Shengshou Aurora. It is incredibly smooth and quite. This is a great cube for those getting into speedcubing because of how controllable it is. For faster solvers it has a tendency to lock up with inaccurate turning. It does boast a low price tag which a slight bonus.\n\nRubik’s came out with a speedcube and has some very nice tiles. This cube is very fast and corner-cutting is just below 45°. Reverse corner-cutting is where this cube faulters. Again you will most likely not see many speedcubers using this as their main, but if you would like a speedcube and want to support the Rubik’s brand this is not a bad cube to get.\n\nWe are not going to include the AoLong Version 1 in this comparison. it is an amazing cube, but it is no longer produced. We will be including the Version 2 though.\n\nNow, lets look at some cubes my MoYu. MoYu has really paved the way for the cubing industry in 2014. The three big cubes available today are the WeiLong, the AoLong, and the recently released HuaLong. The WeiLong came first and has a quite block-y feeling to it. It is very smooth but can catch a bit. Tho AoLong is a bit more bubbly, and can flex a bit more. It has a similar feel as far as speed goes. It is less catchy than then WeiLong, but has a much higher tendency to corner twist at similar tensions. The new HuaLong is said to be an enhanced version of the WeiLong. It is very fast and flexes a ton. It corner cuts as well as the AoLong but without the corner twisting. The WeiLong and AoLong feel a bit similar in terms of weight and speed, while the HauLong cranks it up feeling very airy, light and fast.\n\nAnother cube made by the same company but under the YJ name is the GuanLong. The GuanLong’s claim to fame is its low price tag. You can pick it up for under $5 and is extremely cheap if bought in bulk. It is light and airy, almost like the HuaLong but more so and also without being as fast or flexible. Corner cutting is not as good as other cubes on this list but will still work well for most cubers.\n\nEarlier this year MoYu released a new company for one of it’s designers. The Cong’s Design YueYing is a very interesting cube. It is a tad smaller than the standard 57mm size. The corners have holes in them allowing for amazing corner cutting in both directions. It is not a super speedy cube, but not sluggish my any means. and holds a cubic shape very well, not able to flex very much. This is a very flat feeling 3x3 and if you like that cubic shape this is perfect. Because of the holes in the corner pieces this cube is very loud.\n\nNow, lets take a look at Gans cubes. The two main ones out today are the 357 and newly released 356. The 357 is light, airy, and fast. It also can flex a lot. It is quite similar to the HuaLong. The difference would be in the feeling of the pieces. The Gans 357 has much sharper edges and corners while the HuaLong feel more rounded. The shape of the pieces allows for incredible corner cutting in both direction. As far as the 356 goes, it is quickly becoming many people’s mains. It has a similar shape to the 357 but is heavier, more stable, and not as fast. The internal structure is a bit different with most notably a metal core and pieces that can have weights added to them. I made a video testing that which you should check out if you are interested. A major issue with the 356 is catching on the corner pieces. Normally they slide off the center pieces fine, but if the center pieces twist at all they tend to lock up very easily. This was a major problem on mine and I had to do a lot of sanding to the underside of the corner pieces to resolve the issue. It still can catch, but most of the time pushes through it. Now although some have said they get the catches as well others have said they do not get any.\n\nYuxin released a new 3x3 and 4x4 in the past year. It’s shape of the 3x3 resembles a Gans but internals are more similar to an AoLong. It is not too fast of a cube, but corner cuts very well. Although can flex in place, it is not as much as the Gans 357 or HuaLong. This is a great feeling cube and most notably has a price tag below $10.\n\nFangshi released the GuangYing. It’s former flagship cube was the Shuangren. The Shrengren was fast for it’s time, but the Guangying pumps that up a bit more. The Shrengren was known for being very scratchy. The Guangying has a bit of that, but it is not as prominent. Although the cube is very fast it can not corner cut as well as some of the other on this list.\n\nLastely we have the QiYi Bullfight, also known as the New Island Phoenix. It has an AoLong shape to it, but is a bit lighter and scratchier. This cube boasts a low price tag through QiYi at under $10. Corner cutting is on par with many cubes on this list. Nothing extraordinary, but more than most people will need.\n\nBullFight/Phoenix"
