        "text": "Well, not really, but for those immersed in the saga, Mario Party served as the perfect icebreaker. The series' competitive multiplayer board game set-up made for some fun and tense moments; but let's be real, the reigning champ of any Mario Party experience has always been its mini games. Here are the 11 best Mario Party games out of the whole lot, as we all celebrate Mario Day.\n\nBurnstile – Mario Party 6\n\nBurnstile\n\nAs frustrating as it may be, the \"Burnstile\" mini game from Mario Party 6 is the easiest way to humble an overly-confident Party player. As a spiked arm begins to twist and turn at a rapid rate, you and your partner must time your jumps perfectly and make sure not to fall off the platform into molten lava.\n\nThe tricky 2-v-2 methodology of this mini-game means you and your partner need to give each other space so you don't cause the other to get hit. It's a fast and frenzied mini-game that quickly determines its victor.\n\nSizzling Stakes – Super Mario Party\n\nSizzling Stakes Mario Party\n\nWhile Super Mario Party itself was one of the least successful entries in the franchise, partially due to the wonky Switch schematics, Sizzling Stakes was a fun moment in an otherwise tepid Mario Party game. Fighting against four other players, you must successfully cook a slab of steak before your foes can. The Switch's Joy-Cons were actually perfect for this mini-game and offered quick and snappy control responses that made it easy and fun to flip the beef and sizzle that steak.\n\nWhomp Stomp – Mario Party 9\n\nWhomp Stomp\n\nA few stylistic changes made Mario Party 9 a contentious entry among longtime fans, but the series' 9th offering still had a great handful of mini-games, one of the best being Whomp Stomp. Each player stands on opposite ends of a rotating platform as a gargantuan Whomp lingers closely behind.\n\nFor each round, a player selects either a 1 or a 0, and for every 1 selected, the Whomp rotates about 90 degrees and falls on whoever finds themselves in front of it. It's a gamble of a game that will keep tensions very high.\n\nChump Rope – Mario Party 8\n\nChump Rope Mario Party 8\n\nWhile the Wiimote for Mario Party 8 bred some strange control mechanics, the motion-controlled remote actually came in handy when trying to trip your foes in \"Chump Rope.\" Similar in concept to Mario Party 2's \"Hot Rope Jump,\" the party game's eighth outing actually lets the player control how fast the rope moves, which adds a deceptive element to the mini-game and keeps the jumpers on their toes. Allowing for far more unpredictable results, \"Chump Rope\" is a thrill.\n\nBob-Omb Bogey – Mario Party 10\n\nBob-Omg Bogey\n\nOne of the series' best reaction-focused mini-games, Bob-Omb Bogey from Mario Party 10 places players in front of a hole with a golf club. Each player is then randomly fed either a Bob-Omb or a golf ball. Using your trusty Wiimote, you need to swing if it's the latter and hold off if it's the former, or face total annihilation. With 10 balls in total, it's a race to the finish to see who can hit more balls first.\n\nLog Jam – Mario Party 3\n\nLog Jam Mario Party 3\n\nAnother great reflex-based mini-game, \"Log Jam\" is pretty self-explanatory. Your partner places a block of wood in front of you as you hover an axe over it. The wood has a corresponding button painted on it, and you must quickly mash the requested button in order to chop the wood.\n\nThe player who cuts more wood is deemed the victor, but make sure you're paying attention, as it's easy to get ahead of yourself and hit the wrong button, which causes your axe to get stuck, and places you at a significant disadvantage.\n\nDefuse or Lose – Mario Party 5\n\nDefuse or Lose Mario Party 5\n\nFor those who enjoyed Mario Party's sillier and less stressful offerings, \"Defuse or Lose\" from Mario Party 5 was likely a childhood favorite. Split into teams of two, \"Defuse or Lose\" was about keeping calm and working as a team as you fought to diminish three lit fuses before they set off the Bob-Omb.\n\nHow do you diffuse them? Obviously, with your butt. The silly mini-game does get slightly more stressful if you and your teammate aren't communicative enough, but overall it's an enjoyable romp in an otherwise mediocre Mario Party entry.\n\nApes of Wrath – Mario Party 7\n\nApes of Wrath\n\nA fantastic duel mini-game, three furious monkeys pursue you around a small arena, trying to beat you up. The game is already tense, as you and your enemy run and jump around the map, but the mini-game continues to add more monkeys, making survival more difficult but adding to the mini game's frenzied enjoyment.\n\nBooksquirm – Mario Party 4\n\nBooksquirm Mario Party 4\n\nMario Party 4 had one of the strongest collections of mini-games since the series' initial release back in 1998. While \"Trace Race\" and \"Dungeon Duos\" each deserve a spot on this list, the most enjoyable mini-game by far was \"Booksquirm.\"\n\nPlayers are shrunk down and placed on an open book whose pages are constantly turning. Each page has a different shaped hole cut out of place, and your job is to run around and make sure you find your way to the cut-out gaps and not let the pages crush you. The game is slightly sinister because you can nudge your enemies as you run around, setting them up for failure.\n\nMushroom Mix Up – Mario Party\n\nMushroom Mix Up Mario Party\n\nOne of the most iconic mini-games in the series, the original \"Mushroom Mix Up\" still reigns supreme as one of the most enjoyable outings in the Mario Party universe. A simple but compelling premise, the game merely requires you to stay above water and get to the \"Safe Mushroom\" indicated by Toad. But there usually isn't enough room for all four of you, which makes for some joyful little conflicts along the way.\n\nBumper Balls – Mario Party 2\n\nBumper Balls Mario Party 2\n\nThe reigning champ of Mario Party mini-games, \"Bumper Balls\" is a blast to play to this day. The premise is simple: You and your three other rivals ride bright balls around a small map like bumper cars, trying to knock each other off the stage.\n\nWhile it appeared in the original Mario Party, the mini-games sequel offers a variety of new stages that make for more unexpected moments and, in turn, some of the best moments of our childhood.\n\nWhile the first to offer a variety of game modes and a 4-player split-screen, it was also the first entry in the series to offer weight mechanics, which meant that with multiple characters to choose from, weight helped to determine their skills on the track. Regardless of whether you prefer heavier or lighter characters, here are all the characters of the Mario Kart 64 universe, objectively ranked from worst to best in terms of skill.\n\nWario\n\nWhile Wario may seem like a good choice for players in need of a heavier weight class, the Mario antihero is just not that exciting of a character. He cruises along just fine but offers no defining characteristics that you can't get from one of the game's other characters.\n\nHis frame is clunky, so he never quite revs up to be as fast as the other characters, and while he's smooth at turns, he has to sacrifice speed to do so. He simply is not that good unless you're a die-hard fan of the chunky boy himself.\n\nLuigi\n\nWhile one of the most iconic characters in the Mario universe, Luigi was thrown around every course in Mario Kart 64. He is so lightweight that he drives at times like a ragdoll.\n\nWith that said, he has solid handling, which makes it easy for him to rip around tight corners. However, it's hard for him to build up to top speed, so he wouldn't be the best choice if players want to play competitively online.\n\nPrincess Peach\n\nPrincess Peach is a great choice for those new to Mario Kart. She has fast acceleration, and her lightweight frame makes it easy to dash into an early lead. With that said, she is also quite flimsy and can be beaten back by other characters relatively easily.\n\nHer frame is so lightweight that if she gets thrown around too much she will easily spin out, and frankly, she isn't quite fast enough to catch up to other players once she's behind. She's an easy character to just pick up and play as, but players will soon grow tired of her being thrown off the course so often.\n\nDonkey Kong\n\nDonkey Kong's hulking frame makes him a powerful driver, and one that takes a lot of manpower to drive off course.\n\nHe is also a lot faster than expected from someone of his size and can gain on players quite effectively. For fans of heavier weight classes, Donkey Kong is a great go-to. With that said, his beefy figure means he isn't the most agile driver, so he can sometimes bang up against walls when faced with tight corners.\n\nToad\n\nToad is often a favorite among longtime Mario Kart players, and for good reason. He is one of the most agile characters in the game and can slide and weave between players and around tight corners with relative ease.\n\nThe nimble little guy has amazing handling, and can oftentimes fare well against the bigger competitors. With that said, he moves quickly and requires quick reflexes in order to utilize his talents. For those who aren't fast with the joystick, Toad might be a little too lightweight for you. But if you prefer speed and agility above all else, he is a great option.\n\nMario\n\nMario is probably the best-suited character for beginners. A well-balanced racer, he is an effective turner with great handling, as well as great acceleration and a fast top speed. He is also difficult to knock off a course, and it's really easy for Mario to catch up to first place no matter how big of a lead the winner has. It should surprise no one that the game's namesake is a well-rounded competitor in his own game.\n\nBowser\n\nBowser is by far the best heavyweight character in the game. A brutish force, it's nearly impossible to run him off the track. He is a difficult foe to face, not only because of his stocky build but because his top speed is really, really fast. His handling of tight corners is also impressive, making him an oddly well-balanced racer for those in favor of a heavier driver.\n\nYoshi\n\nRanking Yoshi as the game's top player should come as no surprise to longtime Mario Kart 64 players. He is one of the fastest characters in the game and can put some serious distance between him and other players with relative ease.\n\nWhen knocked off course, he can regain ground incredibly quickly, and even on his top acceleration, can swerve around corners like it's no big deal. His only downfall is that tight corners sometimes slow him down when he's at top speed, but if you take time to learn how to control Yoshi, these setbacks are no big deal.\n\nNo one asked these 14 celebrities to offer these strange endorsements. These are just honest -- though sometimes confusing -- expressions of love for their favorite products.\n\nJessica Simpson - Nicorette Gum\n\nJessica Simpson says that she's never been a smoker, but she knows the power of nicotine addiction. On an episode of The Tonight Show the singer explained to Jay Leno that she was given her first taste of nicotine gum by accident:\n\n\"The first time I ever chewed a piece of Nicorette gum one of my close friends' mother .... thought she was giving me a piece of regular gum. I was chewing it and it was like a party in my mouth. It was like fireworks and 'Oh my god, I'm talking a million miles per hour and I love this gum and what kind of gum is this? I have to have this gum.'\"\n\nShe makes it sound so fun... Still probably not a good idea to develop a Nicorette habit.\n\nDanny DeVito - Limoncello\n\nIn an infamous 2006 appearance on The View, actor-director Danny DeVito gave perhaps the most sincere endorsement of limoncello by confessing that he was up all night drinking the Italian liqueur with his friend George Clooney. Whether the Always Sunny star was exhausted and hung over or possibly still a bit drunk, his loopy energy made for a compelling interview.\n\nIt made such an impact, in fact, that a few months later DeVito launched his own brand of limoncello complete with a catchy jingle and a scratch-and-sniff label. Maybe that's where Clooney got the inspiration for Casamigos.\n\nZendaya - Baby Foot Chemical Peel\n\nBeauty and skincare brands are always looking for glamorous young stars to do some promotion. And Euphoria actor Zendaya is probably near the top of the \"glamorous young star\" list. So you might suspect that Japanese brand Baby Foot paid her to talk about their foot peel \"mask\"... until you read what she had to say:\n\n\"I tried it and was like, 'This is bulls***,' because nothing happened. Then a couple weeks later, I was like, \"What the **** is wrong with my feet!?' They looked a mess and were seriously peeling like crazy. But, it was actually great. It worked really well and my feet were so smooth after! (I'd show you a pictures, but you'd probably throw up!)\"\n\nDoesn't exactly sound appealing.\n\nRobert Pattinson - Cinnamon Toast Crunch\n\nAfter Robert Pattinson's 2012 break-up with Twilight co-star Kristen Stewart, people were desperate to get him talking. On The Daily Show Jon Stewart tried to get him to open up over a couple pints of therapy ice cream, and when that didn't work George Stephanopoulos brought a secret weapon to the set of Good Morning America: Cinnamon Toast Crunch.\n\nThe cereal has been confirmed as Pattinson's favorite, but it wasn't enough to persuade the famously reserved Pattinson to spill the details. Instead, when Stephanopoulos asked him what he wanted his fans to know about the break-up, Pattinson deflected with an impromptu cereal commercial.\n\n\"I'd like my fans to know that Cinnamon toast is just 130 calories.\"\n\nSelena Gomez - Reese's Cups\n\nSelena Gomez loves pickles. The Spring Breakers star has shared her recipe for popcorn with tabasco and pickle juice — which actually sounds kind of tasty — but all the way back in 2009 she shared her love of a much weirder combo. In a move that we're not sure Reese's appreciated, the young star shared this image on her Twitter, noting that \"Reese's and pickles are my favorite together. They just work.\"\n\nWhatever you say, Selena...\n\nJustin Bieber - Rubik's Cubes\n\nIf TV and movies have taught us anything, it's that the ability to quickly solve a Rubik's Cube is irrefutable proof of genius-level intelligence. If that's true (it's not...), then Justin Bieber is probably the smartest celebrity on Earth (he's not).\n\nFrom a young age, the Biebs has been able to solve a Rubik's Cube in under two minutes, and has done so on camera any number of times.\n\nBut what is even more striking than his skill with the famous puzzle is his enthusiasm for it, as evidenced by this installment of The Late Late Show's Carpool Karaoke. When James Corden produces a mixed-up Rubik's Cube for Bieber to solve, the \"Holy\" singer doesn't treat it as a chore. Rather, he responds with, \"Dope. Hell yeah!\" and gets to solving it.\n\nMila Kunis - World of Warcraft\n\nWith the new expansion World of Warcraft: Shadowlands released in November, many recovering WoW addicts are likely to be drawn back to Azeroth to explore the fantasy world's afterlife. Among those who may be tempted is Black Swan star Mila Kunis, who discussed her obsessive relationship with the game on Jimmy Kimmel Live back in 2008.\n\nKunis noted that she had actually had to abandon a character when another player recognized her voice — yet she still kept playing so much that she eventually forced herself to quit entirely. So if Kunis disappears from society for the next few months, the first search party should probably be sent to the shadowlands.\n\nB.J. Novak - Cadbury Creme Eggs\n\nThis one is more of a tough love endorsement. When Cadbury made their Creme Eggs smaller in 2007, they thought they could get away with it. The seasonal treat is only available a few months out of the year, so most people would be unlikely to notice the difference.\n\nOne exception to that rule was Office writer and star B.J. Novak, who loves Cadbury Creme Eggs so much that he keeps a stock frozen for year-round consumption. Cadbury probably didn't appreciate Novak calling out this blatant case of \"shrinkflation\" on national TV, but his devotion to their product was evident nonetheless.\n\nLena Dunham - Neutrogena Light Therapy Acne Mask\n\nGirls creator and star Lena Dunham is not one to withhold the less-than-glamorous details of her life. That's certainly the case with an image she shared on Instagram of her using the $35 Neutrogena Light Therapy Mask for treating acne.\n\nThe accompanying text explained that Dunham \"saw the ad for the light therapy acne mask and became obsessed\" prompting her then-boyfriend Jack Antonoff to buy one for her. In case there was any uncertainty as to whether Neutrogena had approved of the image, Dunham included the hashtags #notanad and #justapsycho.\n\nThe post has since been deleted, though it's not clear if it was purged as a result of Dunham and Antonoff breaking up, or because the light mask has since been recalled for its potential to cause permanent retinal damage...\n\nAnna Kendrick - Angry Birds\n\nMila Kunis is not alone in her addiction to gaming. Back in 2011, Perfect Pitch star Anna Kendrick confessed to an obsession that was extremely 2011. That was the year that Time Magazine listed mobile game developer Peter Vesterbacka as on of their 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nAt the time, Kendrick was so addicted to Vesterbacka's game, Angry Birds that Time used this quote from her in their write up: \"I have three stars on every level. It's sort of disgusting how much I play the game. It's not, Oh, what level am I on? It's, Do I need therapy to break myself from playing Angry Birds?\"\n\nGeorge Clooney - Flowbee\n\nAt some point in your life, you may have had the opportunity to try one of those silly \"As Seen on TV\" infomercial gadgets. Whether it's the Slap Chop, the Shake Weight, or the Tiddy Bear, chances are you won't become quite as devoted to the product as George Clooney is the the bizarre vacuum-powered hair cutting system known as the Flowbee.\n\nThe Ocean's Eleven star recently revealed why he's had an easier time adapting his routine to quarantine. Unlike many celebrities who have gotten shaggy with the advent of social distancing, Clooney hasn't had to worry about missing trips to his stylist. As it turns out, he's been cutting his own hair for decades.\n\nIn a recent interview with CBS's Tracy Smith, the Midnight Sky actor and Tequila Tycoon revealed his secret. \"My hair's, like really like straw, you know? And it's so easy to cut. You can't really make too many mistakes. So years ago I bought a thing called a Flowbee ... It comes with a vacuum cleaner and the clippers? ... Listen, man, it works!\"\n\nClooney has since demonstrated his technique on Jimmy Kimmel Live, making the whole process look easy. But he has noted that the device probably won't work for everyone, noting that he wouldn't risk his wife Amal Clooney's hair to the Flowbee.\n\nChanning Tatum - Cheetos\n\nIn a 2015 Reddit AMA promoting Magic Mike XXL and a rainforest conservation charity, a fan asked Channing Tatum to describe his ideal sandwich. The 21 Jump Street actor didn't hesitate to share his bizarre recipe featuring Cheetos:\n\n\"bread, white. peanut butter, not crunchy, creamy. grape jelly, double portion, more than you think should actually fit on a piece of white bread. bread. and then some cheetos shoved in there, and then you're good to go.\"\n\nNot sure we're gonna try this one at home...\n\nCardi B - Flamin' Hot Cheetos\n\nAnother celebrity who enjoys a strange combination with Cheetos is Cardi B. The \"WAP\" rapper shared this snack in a series of Instagram Stories in may. Dipping Flamin' Hot Cheetos in Tostitos Queso is an interesting choice, but washing it down with a glass of red wine takes it to a whole new level that is so weird it straddles the line between genius and madness.\n\nSandra Bullock - Preparation H\n\nIn the Miss Congeniality series Sandra Bullock plays FBI agent Gracie Hart, who is forced to go under cover and learn to navigate the world of beauty pageants. The Bird Box actor didn't initially know much about that world herself, but she apparently picked up some tricks in the course of production.\n\nIn 2005, when she was doing press for the release of Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous, Bullock shared one tip that was particularly memorable: \"My favorite beauty-pageant secret; I didn't realize that putting hemorrhoid ointment on your face is acceptable in the beauty business. But apparently butt cream does help lines around the eyes.\"\n\nIt's a wonder the brand hasn't adopted that as their slogan.\n\nPredictably, Nintendo has some big plans for their icon's 35th birthday later this year. While they are choosing not to respond to \"rumor and speculation,\" it's being widely reported that those plans will include remastered re-releases of much of the Mario library, including classic games like Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy.\n\nNormally this sort of news would be announced at the annual E3 expo in June, but this year's E3 has already been canceled amid the on-going health crisis, so Nintendo will have to find other ways to get the word out. They are reportedly considering a \"digital showcase\" sometime soon to make the Mario-heavy lineup and release schedule official—though those plans are not yet official.\n\nWhile there are a number of other interesting projects on the horizon—including a new Paper Mario title reportedly in the works for the Switch and a Super Nintendo World being built at Universal theme parks in Orlando and Tokyo—the announcement of classic game re-releases is particularly exciting for older gamers. Not only will we have a chance to replay some of our favorites, tapping into all the fond childhood memories of Mario, we can also school any young gamers in our lives who think they know their way around a controller.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. 35th Anniversary Collection on Nintendo Switch!?www.youtube.com\n\nIn 2015, Nintendo celebrated Mario's 30 birthday with a slew of new Mario merchandise, culminating in the release of Super Mario Maker for the Wii U. So, however Nintendo plans to make their official announcements–whether in one massive digital event or in a trickle of smaller press releases—expect to hear a lot more Mario news in the lead up to September 13th."
