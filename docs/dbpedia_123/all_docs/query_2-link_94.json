(3,674,160 possible combinations)\n\nWe will be using thr same 3yo Beginner Method we use to solve the 3×3. If you haven’t seen our 3×3 Beginner tutorial I recommend you do that first but it’s not absolutely necessary.\n\nHow To Solve 3×3 Rubik’s Cube: So Easy a 3 Year Old Can Do It (Full Tutorial)\n\nSolve Rubik’s Cube 2×2 Intermediate Method\n\nAfter learning to solve the 2×2 Cube with Beginner Method many want to learn how to solve it faster. This Intermediate method goes over all the 2 Look OLLs and PLLs demonstrated on both the 3×3 and 2×2 Cubes. 2×2 IM\n\nUnderstanding the Rubik’s Cube 2×2\n\nFirst, we need to understand that a 2×2 Cube is just a 3×3 without the Center and Edge pieces. It’s just the Corners of a 3×3 which makes it much simpler in most regards.\n\nLike a 3×3, a 2×2 Cube has 6 sides of different colors but unlike a 3×3 the color of the sides are not determined by Center pieces. For the most part the colors are *standardized with the Yellow opposite White, Blue opposite Green and Orange opposite Red. This is important for familiarity and recognition. *(BOGR) Blue, Orange, Green, Red\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nHere we have a disassembled 2 Cube, this is the Core and 8 Corner pieces. Each Corner has 3 Colors. (Show removed corner pieces tossed onto table like in 3×3 vid)\n\nOverview of Layer by Layer Method to Solve 2×2 Cube\n\nTo solve the 2×2 Rubik’s Cube we are going to use the same Layer by Layer Method we use for the 3×3… minus middle layer. For simplicity and familiarity we will make Yellow the Top which will make the Bottom White.\n\nFirst we will solve the First Layer, the Bottom Layer. Its important to notice this isn’t just one side or Face solved but the entire Face and the 4 sides of the Layer.\n\nOn the far right we have the White Face solved and the sides of the White pieces match each other – The White Layer is solve. We start by choosing a Bottom White Corner, an Anchor Piece (White/Orange/Green in our example) and build the Bottom Layer from that Anchor Corner.\n\nNext we solve the Last Layer, the Top Layer in 2 steps.\n\nFirst we get all the Yellows facing up on the Top Layer (OLL). Then we orient them correctly (PLL) , fixing the sides of the Top Layer by shuffling the Corners which solves the entire Cube.\n\nTerminology and Notation\n\nBefore we begin we need to learn some terminology and notation.\n\nFaces\n\nEach of the six sides has a name.\n\nWhichever side is facing you is the Front with all other sides relative to it. From here we have the Right,Left, Back.\n\nThe Top is called Up and the Bottom Down.\n\nA CW and CCW turn is always as if facing the side being turned.\n\nA CCW turn is called Prime or Inverted and is represented with an apostrophe ( ‘ ) or an ( i ) for inverted.\n\n2 means turn that side twice so R2 would be 2 turns whether it be CW or CCW it doesn’t matter it’s a 180deg turn.\n\nNotation of Turns\n\nR = clockwise turn of the Right side.\n\nR’ = counterclockwise turn.\n\nL = clockwise turn of the Left side.\n\nL’ = counterclockwise turn.\n\nU = clockwise turn of the Up or Top side.\n\nU’ = counterclockwise turn.\n\nD = clockwise turn of the Down or Bottom side.\n\nD’ = counter clockwise turn.\n\nB = clockwise turn of the Back side while facing it.\n\nAxis Rotations\n\nNow we have Axis rotations of the entire cube.\n\nAn x rotation means you turn the cube so that the bottom is now the Front and facing you.\n\nAn x’ rotation turns the Top towards you and it now becomes the Front.\n\nA y rotation turns the Right side towards you and it now becomes the Front.\n\nA y’ rotation turns the Left side towards you and it now becomes the Front.\n\nDon’t get too hung up on this notation though as much of what we will do is visual and intuitive.\n\nTo solve the Cube we have to pick a color to make the Bottom. Beginners should always use the same color for simplicity and familiarity.\n\nWe will use White as the bottom, which makes Yellow the top.\n\nNow to solve the cube:\n\nLAYER 1\n\nWe need to build the First Layer with the White pieces. Because we don’t have Centers to determine the color of a side, as a beginner we will just start by finding the White/Orange/Green Corner, let the White be the Bottom and build the layer from there.\n\nNow we need to find the White/Orange or White/Green and place it right above its intended location and insert with the Slap the White Sticker Method – R U R’ if White Sticker is facing the Right or L U’ L’ if White Sticker facing the Left side. Click here for Slap Method video.\n\nLAST LAYER\n\nNow for the Last Layer, the Top Layer, we will learn tricks to flip and orient the pieces the way we want. To do this we will learn two simple sequences called Algorithms. The more you know, the faster you will be able to solve the Cube, but to start with we are only going to use two algorithms to solve the cube as a beginner.\n\n1. Orient Last Layer OLL\n\nNow, we must orient all the Corner pieces so that the Yellow sticker is on Top. (Show Demo) This is called Orient Last Layer, OLL.\n\nThere are only 7 possible arrangements or patterns of the Yellow stickers, each with its own Algorithm to get all the Yellows on Top, facing up.\n\nWe are only going to learn 1 algorithm though forward and backward.\n\n– Fish Patterns\n\nFirst we start with the Fish patterns, which get their name because someone thought this looked like a fish, I don’t see it.\n\nNotice that, although these 2 patterns look the same from the Top, they are different because of the way the Yellow stickers are oriented on the sides. To solve Little Fish we hold the Cube so that the Yellow Top Corner sticker is on the Front Left Top with a Yellow facing us on the Right Front side and perform the Little Fish Algorithm (R U R’ U R U2 R’) which flips the pieces in a way that puts all the Yellows on Top.\n\nIf there’s no sticker right here facing you then you have Big Fish and you have to hold it like this. So for example these 2 look the same but they are different. (Show cubes and pip)\n\nTo solve Big Fishwe place the Yellow Top Corner sticker at the Back Right with a Yellow facing us Left Front side and perform the inverse of the Little Fish Algorithm (R U’2 R’ U’ R U’ R’).\n\nOnce you know an Algorithm well, it becomes intuitive to perform it Forward & backward without much thought or effort.\n\nOne quick practice trick is, if you have this Yellow Top solved and you perform the Little Fish algorithm, it actually makes Big Fish so you just do the inverse to solve it. If you do the Big Fish algorithm it makes Little Fish. So that’s a quick easy way to practice.Performing the Algorithms forward then reverse is a great way to learn the muscle memory.\n\nNow we look at two patterns with no Yellows on Top.\n\nThe first, which we call “Double Fish”, has 2 Yellows on the Left side and 2 on the Right side.\n\nThe second which we call “No Fish”, has 2 Yellows on the Left side, 1 on the Front Right, and 1 on the Back Right.\n\nTo solve Double Fish,place the yellow Corners on the Left and Right sides and perform the Little Fish Algorithm twice hence the name Double Fish (R U R’ U R U2 R’) (R U R’ U R U2 R’)\n\nTo Solve No Fish, place the 2 Yellow Corners that are on the same side to the Left. Later in the video we will explain and learn an easier alg but for now we will perform Little Fish algorithm, which will give us the little Fish pattern. Turn the top to the proper position and perform the Little Fish algorithm again.\n\nSo if we get one of the 3 OLL patterns that we haven’t gone over, just perform the Little Fish algorithm 1 or more times until we get one of the Fish patterns we are familiar with: Little Fish, Big Fish, Double Fish or No Fish. (Bug eyes)This one just became …BF, (Cham bro)this just became DF… (Cham)sometimes when you perform LF you still don’t have one you know, just do it again, Here we have Chameleon, perform Little Fish alg, now we have Chameleon again just oriented differently, Little Fish again, now this one just became No Fish, perform Little Fish one more time, now we have Little Fish. Don’t worry about the inefficiency of all that because it won’t happen that often and when it does its just good practice for learning the Little Fish algorithm anyway. Remember we will learn more efficient methods later in the video.\n\n2. Permutate Last Layer PLL\n\nNow we have our first Layer complete and all the Yellows on Top. We just need to position and shuffle the Top correctly to match the Bottom Layer which will solve the entire Cube.\n\nA quick and simple shortcut is to find a side that has 2 Corners the same Color forming a BAR.\n\nPlace these to the Back and perform an Axis rotation (x) then the algorithm (R’ U R’ D2 R U’ R’ D2 R2 x’) at this point all your corners will be fixed, just rotate the top to match up the colors\n\nOk so one more time a little quicker, find 2 corners the same, you can line them up with the correct color or not (show Orange corners moved to Orange then to Green side for the “or not”),it doesn’t matter (solve orange corners on Green side to the back) Now they are all fixed, so If I want to practice it, just do the algorithm again (do it), find the 2 put em to the back, so you can either turn the whole Cube or… just flick them to the back, then solve it.\n\nIf no side has a BAR or 2 Corners with the same Color, just perform the Algorithm once, then one side will have 2 matching Corners, move them to the Back, then repeat the Algorithm.\n\nNow, turn the Top to line up the 2 layersNow this algorithm looks and sounds more difficult than it really is but it becomes muscle memory plus we are combining several turns into one Step. For example (R’U R’)that’s one Step even though that’s 1, 2, 3 distinct moves. So 12 turns becomes 5 Steps.\n\nAlgorithms\n\nYellow Cross F R U R’ U’ F’\n\nLittle Fish R U R’ U R U2 R’\n\nBig Fish (LF Backwards) R U’2 R’ U’ R U’ R’\n\nDouble Fish (LF x2) R U R’ U R U2 R’ Twice\n\nNo Fish (f R U R’ U’ f’)(F R U R’ U’ F’)\n\nLast layer Corners x R’ U R’ D2 R U’ R’ D2 R2 x’\n\nInsert First Layer Corner\n\nWhite sticker on Right: R U R’\n\nWhite sticker on Left: L’ U’ L\n\n(Slap the white side)\n\nSpace\n\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/shop/kevingittemeier\n\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/KTFG\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kevin_gittemeier\n\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/Percipio_cepi/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/KevinGittemeier\n\nShop: https://www.kevingittemeier.com/shop/\n\nRubik’s Cube & Puzzle Tutorial Youtube Playlist\n\nPlaylist\n\nHelp Support Future Tutorials\n\nThe cubes used in this video were all purchased in full by me, no sponsored products so consider using the links to help support this channel.
