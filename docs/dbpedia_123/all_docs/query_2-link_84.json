        "text": "Are you the kind of puzzler that is looking for a unique challenge? Maybe you're looking for a piece of interactive art to brighten your desk and help you through a tedious Thursday afternoon!\n\nThen check out the new Corner Pocket puzzle from designer Justin Eplett!\n\nAt first glance, this cube looks deceptively easy to scramble and solve, if you approach it with the (incorrect) assumption that it turns like a regular 2x2x2. The true challenge is quickly revealed after a few simple twists radically alter the cubic shape.\n\nThe unpredictable shape changes are produced by a concept called ’bandaging’, combined with a shape transformation technique often referred to as ’modding’. The puzzle is actually a 3x3x3 cube with pieces fused (’bandaged’) together and extended to produce a simpler looking puzzle.\n\nThere are several different solved states that are all indistinguishable from one another, meaning there is more than one solution.\n\nThe puzzle is off-center for turning. Size: 2.36\" x 2.36\" x 2.36\"\n\nUPC: 779090200705\n\nWeight: 7.50 ounces\n\nIn order to add to or manage your existing wish list, you must have an account. If you already do, please login now. If not, click the create account button. The process couldn't be easier. The best part of having a wish list is sharing it with others."
