        "text": "SSE 3x3\n\nThe SSE 3x3 (Superset ENG) is a notation for cubes with 3 layers, such as the Rubik's Cube. The notation is based on the English language. It supports 90° and 180° twists of the layers of the cube. A whole cube can be rotated along its face axes. Permutation and orientation changes of individual cube parts can be specified using permutation cycles.\n\nFace twists: R, R', R2\n\nMove Right Up Front Left Down Back ○○● +90° R U F L D B ○○● -90° R' U' F' L' D' B' ○○● +180&deg R2 U2 F2 L2 D2 B2\n\nClockwise 90° twists of the six faces of the cube are described by the capital letters: R, U, F, L, D and B, (right, up, front, left, down, back). For example, R rotates the right face in clockwise direction as seen from the right face.\n\nCounterclockwise twists and rotations are described by appending the inversion operator ' to a move: R', U', F', ...\n\nIn environments, where the ' character can not be used, the character - can be used as an alternative inversion operator.\n\n180° twists and rotations are described by appending the number 2 to a move: R2, U2, F2, ...\n\nTier twists: TR, TR', TR2\n\nMove Right Up Front Left Down Back ○●● +90° TR TU TF TL TD TB ○●● -90° TR' TU' TF' TL' TD' TB' ○●● +180&deg TR2 TU2 TF2 TL2 TD2 TB2\n\nTwists which go two layers deep (tier twists) are described by prepending the letter T to a face twist: TR, TU', TF2. For example, TR rotates the outer two layers in clockwise direction as seen from the right face.\n\nMid-layer twists: MR, MR', MR2\n\nMove Right Up Front Left Down Back ○●○ +90° MR MU MF ML MD MB ○●○ -90° MR' MU' MF' ML' MD' MB' ○●○ +180&deg MR2 MU2 MF2 ML2 MD2 MB2\n\nTwists of the layer in the middle (mid-layer twists) are described by prepending the letter M to a face twist: MR, MU', MF2. For example, MR rotates the middle layer in clockwise direction as seen from the right face.\n\nSlice twists: SR, SR', SR2\n\nMove Right Up Front Left Down Back ●○● +90° SR SU SF SL SD SB ●○● -90° SR' SU' SF' SL' SD' SB' ●○● +180&deg SR2 SU2 SF2 SL2 SD2 SB2\n\nTwists of opposing faces (slice twists) are described by prepending the letter S to a face twist. For example, SR turns the right face and the opposing left face in clockwise direction as seen from the right face.\n\nCube rotations: CR, CR', CR2\n\nMove Right Up Front Left Down Back ●●● +90° CR CU CF CL CD CB ●●● -90° CR' CU' CF' CL' CD' CB' ●●● +180&deg CR2 CU2 CF2 CL2 CD2 CB2\n\nRotations of the whole cube (cube rotations) are described by prepending the letter C to a face twist. For example, CR rotates the whole cube in clockwise direction as seen from the right face.\n\nGrouping\n\nSequences of moves can be grouped using brackets: (R U F).\n\nRepetition\n\nMoves and groups can be repeated multiple times by appending the number of repetitions to the closing bracket: (R U F)3.\n\nFurther informations"
