        "text": "The Rubik’s Cube is a fascinating, timeless puzzle with quintillions of possible states. As a cube-geek turned AI-enthusiast, and armed with a handful of human-centric algorithms for solving the cube, I decided to try my hands at programming a Rubik’s Cube solver. Perhaps a bit naively, I didn’t outright realize that solving a cube optimally or proving that any cube is solvable in 20 or fewer moves would involve a decent understanding of mathematics, combinatorics, optimization, and group theory. Fun stuff. So I waded through a bunch of papers, brushed off some old math and AI books, and went to work coding up two algorithms. First I implemented Thistlethwaite’s algorithm, which can solve any cube in 52 moves or fewer, and then Korf’s optimal algorithm, a.k.a. “God’s algorithm,” which can solve any cube in 20 or fewer moves.\n\nIn this article I’ll give an overview of some of the data structures I used, and a high-level description of each algorithm. My code is available on GitHub, and at the time of writing version 4.0.0 is the latest release. I also have a video on YouTube that showcases the program (note that version 2.2.0 is shown in the video, and the program has been enhanced since then)."
