        "text": "In Maths or in Geometry, a Cube is a solid three-dimensional figure, which has 6 square faces, 8 vertices and 12 edges. It is also said to be a regular hexahedron. You must have seen 3 × 3 Rubik’s cube, which is the most common example in the real-life and it is helpful to enhance brain power. In the same way, you will come across many real-life examples, such as 6 sided dice, etc. Solid geometry is all about three-dimensional shapes and figures, which have surface areas and volumes. The other solid shapes are cuboid, cylinder, cone, sphere. We will discuss here its definition, properties and its importance in Maths. Also, learn the surface area formula for the cube along with its volume formula.\n\nTable of contents:\n\nDefinition\n\nShape\n\nArea and Volume\n\nProperties\n\nDifference Between Square and Cube\n\nHow to make Cube\n\nExamples\n\nPractice Problems\n\nFAQs\n\nCube Definition\n\nAs discussed earlier, a cube is a 3-D\n\nsolid shape, which has 6 faces. A cube is one of the simplest shapes in three-dimensional space. All the six faces of a cube are squares, a two-dimensional shape.\n\nCube Shape\n\nSometimes, the shape of a cube is considered as “cubic”. We can also say that a cube is considered as a block, where all the length, breadth and height are the same. Along with that, it has 8 vertices and 12 edges such that 3 edges meet at one vertex point. Check the given image below, defining its faces, edges and vertices. It is also known as a square parallelepiped, an equilateral cuboid and a right rhombohedron. The cube is one of the platonic solids and it is considered as the convex polyhedron where all the faces are square. We can say that the cube has octahedral or cubical symmetry. A cube is the special case of the square prism.\n\nIn the above figure, you can see, edge, face and vertex of the cube. Here, L stands for length, B stands for breadth and H stands for height. We can see the length, breadth and height of the cube, which represents the edges of the cube, connected at a single point which is the vertex. The faces of the cube are connected by four vertices. Since the cube is a 3D shape, the two important parameters used to measure the cube are surface area and volume. Now let us discuss the properties of the cube along with the formula for surface area and volume.\n\nSurface Area and Volume Formula For Cube\n\nThe surface area and the volume of the cube are discussed below:\n\nSurface Area of a Cube\n\nWe know that for any shape, the area is defined as the region occupied by it in a plane. A cube is a three-dimensional object, therefore, the area occupied by it will be in a 3d plane. Since a cube has six faces, therefore, we need to calculate the surface area of the cube, covered by each face. The formula to find the surface area can be found as given below.\n\nLet a be the edge of the cube.\n\nArea of one face = Area of a square = a2\n\nWe know that the cube has 6 square shaped faces.\n\nLateral surface area (excluding the top and bottom faces) = 4 × Area of one face\n\nLSA = 4a2\n\nTotal surface area = LSA + Area of the top and bottom faces\n\nTSA = 4a2 + a2 + a2\n\nTSA = 6a2\n\nSurface Area of Cube = 6a2 in a square units\n\nVolume of Cube\n\nThe volume of the cube is the space contained in it. Suppose, if an object is in cubical shape and we need to immerse any material in it, say water, then the measure of water in litres to be kept in the object is calculated by its volume. The formula of the volume is given by:\n\nVolume of cube = a3 cubic units\n\nFor More Information On Volumes of Cubes and Cuboid, Watch The Below Video:\n\nLength of Diagonal of Cube\n\nIf a is the length of the side, then,\n\nLength of Diagonal of Face of the Cube = √2 a\n\nLength of Diagonal of Cube = √3 a\n\nAlso, see:\n\nVolume Of Cube Cuboid Cylinder\n\nSurface Area Of Cuboid\n\nImportant Questions Class 8 Maths Chapter 11 Mensuration\n\nImportant Questions Class 10 Maths Chapter 13 Surface Areas Volume\n\nProperties of Cube\n\nThe following are the important properties of cube:\n\nIt has all its faces in a square shape.\n\nAll the faces or sides have equal dimensions.\n\nThe plane angles of the cube are the right angle.\n\nEach of the faces meets the other four faces.\n\nEach of the vertices meets the three faces and three edges.\n\nThe edges opposite to each other are parallel.\n\nDifference Between Square and Cube\n\nThe major difference between the square and the cube is the square is a two-dimensional figure and it has only two dimensions such as length and breadth, whereas the cube is a three-dimensional figure and its three dimensions are length, breadth and height. The cube is obtained from the shape square.\n\nHow to Make a Cube Shape?\n\nA cube can be formed by folding a net of six squares connected each other as shown in figure given below:\n\nCube Examples\n\nExample 1:\n\nIf the value of the side of the cube is 10 cm, then find its surface area and volume.\n\nSolution:\n\nGiven, side, a = 10 cm\n\nTherefore, by the surface area and volume formula of the cube, we can write;\n\nSurface Area = 6a2 = 6 × 102 = 6 × 100.= 600 cm2\n\nVolume = a3 = 103 = 1000 cm3\n\nExample 2:\n\nFind the side length of a cube whose volume is 512 cm3.\n\nSolution:\n\nGiven: Volume of cube, v = 512 cm2\n\nWe know that the formula for the volume of a cube is a3 cubic units.\n\nTherefore, 512 = a3\n\n512 can be written as 83\n\n83 = a3\n\nTherefore, a= 8\n\nHence, the side length of the cube, a = 8 cm.\n\nPractice Problems\n\nSolve the following problems given below:\n\nThe side length of the cube is 6 cm. Find its surface area.\n\nDetermine the volume of a cube whose side length is 4 cm.\n\nFind the volume of the cube whose surface area is 24 cm2.\n\nFind the diagonal length of the cube when a = 9 cm.\n\nLearn more about different geometrical shapes and figures here at BYJU’S.
