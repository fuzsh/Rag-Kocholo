        "text": "The Rubik’s Cube is a classic puzzle that has captivated millions of people for decades.\n\nThis three-dimensional puzzle often takes the form of a cube, such as the Rubik’s Cube.\n\nInvented by the Hungarian sculptor Ernő Rubik in 1974.\n\nThe Rubik’s cube is made up of smaller cubes that twist and turn to form each of its faces.\n\nThe cube must be solved so that each of its six sides displays a single color (white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow).\n\nFeliks Zemdegs is an Australian Rubik’s cube speed solver and world champion. Thanks to his unrivaled achievements, he holds a Guinness World Record for speedsolving and is regarded as the greatest speed solver of all time in the cubing community.\n\nWhile the original Rubik’s Cube remains popular, there are now numerous variants of this iconic puzzle, each with its own unique twist.\n\nRubik’s cubes are now available in different shapes, sizes, and platforms.\n\nFrom Richfit – THE BOOK THE POWERFUL PEOPLE OF THE FITNESS WORLD DON’T WANT YOU TO READ – The Gym turinabol steroid 3 million transformations based on weight loss and fitness – donna magazine\n\nThese variants range from those that change the number of faces on the cube to those that alter the way it is solved.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the different types of Rubik’s Cube variants. Whether you are a seasoned Rubik’s Cube solver or just starting out, this guide will provide an in-depth look at the different options available.\n\nGet a monthly puzzle subscription box for a brand new puzzle set every month – right to your doorstep!\n\nGET PUZZLCRATE\n\n1.
