        "text": "A 2x2 is a six sided cubic puzzle similar to the 3x3 Rubik's cube, but it only has two layers, with 4 corners on each layer. There are no center or edge pieces. You can use the same steps to solve a 2x2 as you use for the corners of a 3x3. It can be more difficult to recognise cases as there is no center to reference.\n\nThis guide will help you to solve the 2x2 in 3 steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - COMPLETE THE WHITE LAYER\n\nSTEP 2 - COMPLETE THE LAST LAYER CORNERS\n\nSTEP 3 - COMPLETE THE LAST LAYER (ORIENTATION)\n\nDOWNLOAD Print Friendly PDF - How to Solve a 2x2 Beginners Guide\n\nSTEP 1a - COMPLETE THE WHITE BAR\n\nFind the WHITE/RED/GREEN corner and hold the cube with the WHITE/RED/GREEN corner in the front top left position with the WHITE ON TOP. Notice the red side of the corner will be facing you and the green will be on the left.\n\nFind the WHITE/RED/BLUE corner and move it to the bottom front right position. (KEEPING THE WHITE/RED/GREEN CORNER IN PLACE).\n\nChoose one of the 3 colour images below that matches your cube and follow the arrow steps to put the WHITE/RED/BLUE corner in place.\n\nSTEP 1b - COMPLETE THE 3rd WHITE Corner\n\nKeeping the WHITE bar on top, turn the cube so that the WHITE/RED/BLUE corner is now in the front top left position. Notice the blue side of the corner will be facing you and the red will be on the left.\n\nFind the WHITE/BLUE/ORANGE corner and move it to the bottom front right position. (KEEPING THE WHITE BAR IN PLACE).\n\nChoose one of the 3 colour images below that matches your cube and follow the arrow steps to put the WHITE/BLUE/ORANGE corner in place.\n\nResult:\n\nSTEP 1c - COMPLETE THE 4th WHITE Corner\n\nKeeping WHITE on top, turn the cube so that the WHITE/BLUE/ORANGE corner is now in the front top left position.\n\nFind the WHITE/GREEN/ORANGE corner and move it to the bottom front right position (KEEPING THE 3 COMPLETED WHITE PIECES IN PLACE).\n\nChoose one of the 3 colour images below that matches your cube and follow the arrow steps WHITE/GREEN/ORANGE corner in place.\n\nPossible Problem: The corner you are looking for is in the top layer, but in the wrong position or turned the wrong way around. Turn the cube so that the corner is in the front right top corner then move the corner to the bottom layer by following the following steps.\n\nSolution:\n\nPerform these steps , then choose again from steps above to put the corner in place\n\nResult:\n\nSTEP 2 - PLACE LAST LAYER CORNERS IN THE CORRECT POSITION\n\n1. Turn your cube around so that WHITE is now on the bottom.\n\n2. Turn the top layer so that ONLY ONE corner matches the bottom corners colors. Ignoring the White and Yellow colors. The corner may not be the correct way around. (In the example below we placed the YELLOW/ORANGE/GREEN corner on top of the WHITE/ORANGE/GREEN corner.\n\n3. Turn the whole cube so that the correct corner is in the front top right position. The piece is in the correct position, BUT may not be turned the correct way around.\n\nRepeat the sequence above until all the corners are in the correct position, meaning the colors match the bottom corner (excluding white and yellow). The corners may not be the correct way around - that's OK.\n\nPossible Problem1: You have 2 corners in the correct position (matching their bottom colors)\n\nSolution: Keep turning the top Layer (yellow) until only ONE corner is in the correct position.\n\nSTEP 3 - ORIENTATE LAST LAYER CORNERS\n\nThe next steps will turn the corners (one by one) the correct way and ultimately solve the cube.\n\nNOTE: THIS ROUTINE MAY APPEAR TO UPSET THE REST OF THE CUBE. DO NOT DESPAIR AND KEEP THE SAME SIDE FACING YOU IT WILL ONLY BE SOLVED ONCE THE LAST CORNER IS ORIENTATED.\n\nRepeat the moves until the YELLOW side of the corner piece is on top. You may have to do it 2-3 times.\n\nKEEP THE SAME SIDE OF THE BOTTOM LAYER FACING YOU. Rotate the TOP LAYER ONLY until the next corner piece to be rotated is in the top right position. Repeat the above sequence until the YELLOW side of the corner that you are rotating is on top. Continue the process until the cube is complete.\n\nYOU HAVE DONE IT !!!\n\nPuzzle is also known as Pocket Cube, 2x2 Rubix cube, four squares cube, eight squares cube. and 2X2"
