        "text": "In geometry, three-dimensional shapes or 3D shapes are solids that have three dimensions such as length, width and height. Whereas 2d shapes have only two dimensions, i.e. length and width. Examples of three-dimensional objects can be seen in our daily life such as cone-shaped ice cream, cubical box, a ball, etc. Students will come across different 3D shapes models in Maths.\n\nGeometry is one of the practical sections of Mathematics that involves various shapes and sizes of different figures and their properties. Geometry can be divided into two types: plane and solid geometry. Plane geometry deals with flat shapes like lines, curves, polygons, etc., that can be drawn on a piece of paper. On the other hand, solid geometry involves objects of three-dimensional shapes such as cylinders, cubes, spheres, etc. In this article, we are going to learn different 3D shapes models in Maths such as cube, cuboid, cylinder, sphere and so on along with its definitions, properties, formulas and examples in detail.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nThree Dimensional Shapes Definition\n\nFaces, Edges and Vertices\n\nList of Three Dimensional Shapes\n\nCube\n\nCuboid\n\nPrism\n\nPyramid\n\nCylinder\n\nCone\n\nSphere\n\n3D Shapes Model in Maths\n\nSurface Area and Volume Formulas\n\nVideo Lessons\n\nExamples\n\nPractice Questions\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are Three-Dimensional Shapes?\n\nShapes that can be measured in 3 directions are called three-dimensional shapes. These shapes are also called solids. Length, width, and height (or depth or thickness) are the three measurements of three-dimensional shapes. These are the part of three-dimensional geometry. They are different from 2D shapes because they have thickness. Several examples can be found in everyday life. Some of them are:\n\nSolid Shapes in Maths\n\nIn Mathematics, the three-dimensional objects having depth, width and height are called solid shapes. Let us consider a few shapes to learn about them. You can find many examples of solid shapes around you, such as a mobile, notebook or almost everything you can see around is a solid shape.\n\nFaces, Edges, and Vertices of Three Dimensional Shapes\n\nList of Three-dimensional Shapes\n\nThe list of three-dimensional shapes are as follows:\n\nThree-dimensional Shapes Names:\n\nCube\n\nCuboid\n\nCone\n\nCylinder\n\nSphere\n\nPyramid\n\nPrism\n\nHere, we are going to discuss the list of different three-dimensional shapes with their properties and the formulas of different 3D shapes.\n\nCube\n\nA cube is a solid or three-dimensional shape which has 6 square faces. The cube has the following properties.\n\nAll edges are equal\n\n8 vertices\n\n12 edges\n\n6 faces\n\nCuboid\n\nA cuboid is also called a rectangular prism, where the faces of the cuboid are a rectangle in shape. All the angles measure 90 degrees. The cuboid has\n\n8 vertices\n\n12 edges\n\n6 faces\n\nPrism\n\nA prism is a 3D shape which consists of two equal ends, flat surfaces or faces, and also has identical cross-section across its length. Since the cross-section looks like a triangle, the prism is generally called a triangular prism. The prism does not have any curve. Also, a prism has\n\n6 vertices\n\n9 edges\n\n5 faces – 2 triangles and 3 rectangles\n\nPyramid\n\nA pyramid a solid shape, whose outer faces are triangular and meet to a single point on the top. The pyramid base can be of any shape such as triangular, square, quadrilateral or in the shape of any polygon. The most commonly used type of a pyramid is the square pyramid, i.e., it has a square base and four triangular faces. Consider a square pyramid, it has\n\n5 vertices\n\n8 edges\n\n5 faces\n\nCylinder\n\nA cylinder is defined as a three-dimensional geometrical figure which has two circular bases connected by a curved surface. A cylinder has\n\nNo vertex\n\n2 edges\n\n2 flat faces – circles\n\n1 curved face\n\nCone\n\nA cone is a three-dimensional object or solid, which has a circular base and has a single vertex. The cone is a geometrical figure that decreases smoothly from the circular flat base to the top point called the apex. A cone has\n\n1 vertex\n\n1 edge\n\n1 flat face – circle\n\n1 curved face\n\nSphere\n\nA sphere is a three-dimensional solid figure which is perfectly round in shapes and every point on its surface is equidistant from the point is called the center. The fixed distance from the center of the sphere is called a radius of the sphere. A sphere has\n\nNo vertex\n\nNo edges\n\n1 curved face\n\nThree-dimensional Shapes related Articles\n\nAlso, read:\n\nCuboid and Cube\n\nCylinder\n\nCone\n\nPrism\n\npyramid\n\n3D Shapes Model in Maths Project\n\nIf you know what three-dimensional shapes are, it would be easy for you to build a 3d shapes models in Maths such as projects for constructing a house or a building. This would be easy for the students to make as they can measure the rooms easily. Rest all they need is cardboard, glue, scissors and art supplies to make it look exactly like a mini house or building.\n\nSurface Area and Volume of 3D shapes\n\nThe two distinct measures used for defining the 3D shapes are:\n\nSurface Area\n\nVolume\n\nSurface Area is defined as the total area of the surface of the three-dimensional object. It is denoted as “SA”. The surface area is measured in terms of square units. The three different classifications of surface area are defined below. They are:\n\nCurved Surface Area (CSA) is the area of all the curved regions\n\nLateral Surface Area (LSA) is the area of all the curved regions and all the flat surfaces excluding base areas\n\nTotal Surface Area (TSA) is the area of all the surfaces including the base of a 3D object\n\nVolume is defined as the total space occupied by the three-dimensional shape or solid object. The volume is denoted as “V”. It is measured in terms of cubic units.\n\nShapes Surface Area Volume Cube The Surface Area of a Cube = 6a2 square units The volume of a Cube = a3 cubic units Cuboid The Surface Area of a Cuboid = 2(lb+bh+lh) Square units The volume of a Cuboid = lbh Cubic units Cylinder The Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2πr(h +r) Square units\n\nThe curved surface area of a cylinder = 2πrh\n\nThe volume of a Cylinder = πr2 h Cubic units Cone Surface Area of a Cone = πr(r +√(r2+h2) Square units\n\nCurved surface area of a cone =πrl square units\n\nSlant height of a cone = l = √(r2+h2) units\n\nVolume of a Cone = ⅓ πr2h Cubic units Cylinder Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2πr(h +r) Square units\n\nCurved surface area of a cylinder = 2πrh\n\nVolume of a Cylinder = πr2 h Cubic units Sphere Curved Surface Area of a Sphere = 2πr² Square units\n\nTotal Surface Area of a Sphere = 4πr² Square units\n\nVolume of a Sphere = 4/3(πr3) cubic units Pyramid Surface Area of a Pyramid = (Base area) + (1/2) × (Perimeter) × (Slant height) Square units Volume of a Pyramid = 1/3 × (Base Area) × height Cubic units\n\nLearn more about the three-dimensional shapes with BYJU’S – The Learning App. Download the app today and start practice.\n\nVideo Lesson\n\nSolid shapes\n\nTo Know About Nets Of Solid Shapes, Watch The Below Video:\n\nThree Dimensional Shapes Examples (Solved problems)\n\nExample 1:\n\nFind the volume of a cube if its side length is 6 cm.\n\nSolution:\n\nGiven: Side length, a = 6 cm.\n\nWe know that the volume of cube = a3 cubic units.\n\nHence, V = 63 = 216 cm3\n\nHence, the volume of a cube is 216 cm3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nFind the total surface area of a sphere, whose radius is 3 cm. Use (π = 3.14)\n\nSolution:\n\nGiven: Radius, r = 3 cm.\n\nThe formula to calculate the total surface area of a sphere is given by:\n\nTSA of Sphere = 4πr² Square units\n\nTSA of sphere = 4(3.14)(3)2 cm2\n\nTSA of Sphere = 113.04 cm2.\n\nHence, the total surface area of a sphere is 113.04 cm2.\n\nExample 3:\n\nFind the volume of a cuboid, whose dimensions is 4cm × 6 cm × 12 cm.\n\nSolution:\n\nGiven cuboid dimensions = 4cm × 6 cm × 12 cm\n\nWe know that the volume of a cuboid is lbh cubic units.\n\nHence, Volume of cuboid = (4)(6)(12) cm3.\n\nV = 288 cm3\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cuboid is 288 cm3.\n\nPractice Question on 3D Shapes Models in Maths\n\nSolve the following problems on 3D shapes:"
