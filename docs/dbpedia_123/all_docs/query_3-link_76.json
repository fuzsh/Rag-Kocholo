        "text": "If a Rubik Cube is scrambled using only half-turns (i.e., through 180º), then every face will show at most two colours - the original plus the one belonging to the opposite side. A puzzle in that state is not too difficult to restore. Furthermore, this is still a challenging and enjoyable exercise. At the same time you will be learning and practising techniques which remain useful when it comes to solving a completely mixed up cube. The approach described here, involves working up through three well-defined levels of difficulty.\n\nThe Rubik&#39;s cube is a famous puzzle in which faces can be moved and the corresponding movement operations define a group. We consider here a generalization to any $3$-valent map. We prove an upper bound on the size of the corresponding group which we conjecture to be tight.\n\nObsession/addiction may serve as bridges from Sartre’s “being in itself”, as epitomized by the discouraged worker effect of our ex-navy “cuber”, through a cyber-island of “being for itself” where the obsession/addiction of the cube forces externalization (Sartre, 1943 (2003)). Ultimately the need to demonstrate proficiency causes the obsessed to journey across another bridge and identify with a “being for others”. The discussion is situated in a modern world rendered liquid through change and the need to change. The illiquid being in a liquid modernity is insoluble and precipitates. The discouraged worker is such an illiquid being in itself.\n\nBy using two different invariants for the Rubik’s Magic puzzle, one of metric type, the other of topological type, we can dramatically reduce the universe of constructible configurations of the puzzle. Finding the set of actually constructible shapes remains however a challenging task, that we tackle by first reducing the target shapes to specific configurations: the octominoid 3D shapes, with all tiles parallel to one coordinate plane; and the planar “face-up” shapes, with all tiles (considered of infinitesimal width) lying in a common plane and without superposed consecutive tiles. There are still plenty of interesting configurations that do not belong to either of these two collections. The set of constructible configurations (those that can be obtained by manipulation of the undecorated puzzle from the starting situation) is a subset of the set of configurations with vanishing invariants. We were able to actually construct all octominoid shapes with vanishing invariants and most...\n\nThis paper tackled recruitment of computer to solve Rubik&#39;s cube ٣ × ٣ × ٣ through a proposed algorithm generate 4 steps (movements) for each face of Rubik&#39;s cube&#39;s faces resulting from moving second row and second column of center of each face from six faces in original states (configuration) of cube, which represents the row and the column center of each face of the six sides of a cube, which is the color of the face itself. Represent the twentyfour movement generated in the algorithm proposed most of probability positions in correct positions completely to assign correct color of nine cubies for each face of the six sides of a cube and then a solution cube as a whole to make every face of the six of Rubik&#39;s cube covered in one color (red, white, blue, orange, green, yellow), and without violating center position ones in original faces (configuration) in Rubik&#39;s cube. The experimental results in this paper show a flexible easy to solve the Rubik&#39;s cube ٣ × ..."
