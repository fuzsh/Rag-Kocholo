        "text": "GoCube is the classic rubik's cube puzzle game, reimagined and redesigned for the 21st century - a Smart and Connected Cube.\n\nWith its new technology, the Smart Cube offers a new and exciting playing experience for all levels of players, all ages and all capabilities, Including:\n\nFun interactive tutorials for beginners\n\nStatistics and challenges for players who wish to level up their game\n\nThe world's first online cubing league and competition, turning the Rubik's Cube into a social connected world.\n\nMore than that, GoCube offers casual puzzle games that use the rubik's cube as a controller, enabling anyone to enjoy the classic smarty toy, even if they are not interested in learning how to solve it.\n\nGo-Learn (for beginners)\n\nA fun interactive tutorial will safely guide you through the world's most known cube puzzles secrets.\n\nThe tutorials breaks the complex solving challenge into small fun mini-steps, and includes videos, tips and real time feedback (from the GoCube in your hands, to the virtual one on your screen).\n\nWith GoCube YOU CAN solve the rubik's Cube in no time!\n\nGo-Improve (for intermediates & pros) -\n\nPractice and monitor your progress with advanced stats and analytics.\n\nGoCube measures your play down to the milliseconds. It provides accurate data for your cube solve time, speed, and moves.\n\nGoCube will automatically identify your rubik's cube solving algorithm, and will provide you the relevant measurement for each individual step in it.\n\nGo-Compete (for all levels) -\n\nGoCubes matches include various playing modes, from fun scrambling competitions (spaceship racing for all levels) to pro's versus battle matches.\n\nGet into the world's first leaderboard, and join live competitions. Play against your friends or vs strangers.\n\nTo ensure a fair match, GoCube recognizes the starting position of each player and guides them through a unique set of moves to reach a common starting position.\n\nGo-Play-\n\nMini-games, missions and third party games incorporate various aspects of cubing in order to improve handling skills, instincts, or simple games for pure fun.\n\nGoCube is a one-of-a-kind smart connected speed cube, for many hours of fun!\n\nConnect your GoCube to your iPhone or iPad, and start GoCube NOW!\n\n* Be sure that your device meets the following minimum requirements:\n\niPhone 6s or higher\n\nBluetooth version 4.1 or higher.\n\nIssac Myers 2015MYER02 ,\n\nGoCube from a Speed Perspective\n\nI received my GoCube around a month and a half ago and have done around 1,000 times solves so far, in those solves Iâve learned the strengths and weaknesses of the cube.\n\nAs far as how well it works with the app and how the software behaves, itâs fantastic! I could hardly believe that in 100,000+ turns that itâs never missed a single turn input. The cfop reconstruction on the app provides great information that I can use to work on my own solves and having it laid out so conveniently with tps is perfect!\n\nI didnât really bother with the program for learning how to solve the cube but I imagine itâs just as great as the rest of the app.\n\nThe only reason I rate it as a 4/5, is turning of the cube. The magnets are too strong, it turns just a little too fast, (and eats up heavy lube fast enough for the speed to be an actual negative), the pillowed-ness of the cube isnât actually that hard to work with but the final con is the corner cutting. It just feels too snappy and doesnât cut enough for it to be used for times that I could get on normal flagship cubes. Itâs also worth noting that the cube pops once every 250 solve or so.\n\nFor a beginner or intermediate cuber, this is an absolute 5/5, cube functions well enough and the app is perfect for what a cuber needs. For more advanced cubers, you probably wonât be using a Bluetooth cube for serious solves anyways!"
