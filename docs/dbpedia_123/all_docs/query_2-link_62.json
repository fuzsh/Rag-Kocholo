The cubies project arms into a central sphere with tracks to guide their movement.\n\nPatent Number: US4409750 Popular Name: Rubik's Calendar Inventor(s): Marvin A. Silbermintz Date Issued: October 18, 1983\n\nA calendar cube. The patent includes the sticker layout and a solution.\n\nPatent Number: US4421311 Popular Name: Rubik's Revenge Inventor(s): Peter Sebesteny Date Issued: December 20, 1983\n\nA 4x4x4 cube; pieces orbit a central sphere with projecting caps that both holds the face-centers and provides a track for their rotation.\n\nPatent Number: US4437667 Popular Name: Inventor(s): Ronald L. Miller Date Issued: March 20, 1984\n\nJust a 3x3x3 cube, but the patent is for a variety of Scrabble-like games playable on the surface by the use of detachable stickers or markers for the cubie faces.\n\nPatent Number: US4441715 Popular Name: Inventor(s): Stephen C. Titus Date Issued: April 10, 1984\n\nA sphere with 6 interchangeable segments. Like a Masterball without the latitudinal slices.\n\nPatent Number: JP60222076 Popular Name: Master Rainbow Cube Inventor(s): Watanabe Yasunari, Ikegami Yuuji Date Filed: April 18, 1984\n\nThis puzzle is to the Rainbow Cube as the 5x5x5 is to the 3x3x3. Amazing!\n\nPatent Number: US4451039 Popular Name: Inventor(s): Clarence W. Hewlett, Jr. Date Issued: May 29, 1984\n\nAn order-3 face-centered magic octahedron. The tips are non-trivial and none of the exterior pieces are fixed in place. The central mechanism is a stella octangula with rotating tips, surrounded by six corner octahedra, twelve edge octahedra, and twenty four face tetrahedra.\n\nPatent Number: US4453715 Popular Name: Halpern-Meier Pyramid Inventor(s): Benjamin R. Halpern Date Issued: June 12, 1984\n\nThe Halpern-Meier Pyramid. The edges and tips project feet into the center of the tetrahedron which combine to form a sphere. The face-centers connect in the center of the sphere and hold everything together. Also includes a Megaminx variant and a truncated tetrahedron with face centers, corners and edges, and a suggestion for what will later be known as \"bandaging\".\n\nPatent Number: US4473228 Popular Name: Inventor(s): John R. Hart Date Issued: September 25, 1984\n\nA possible mechanism for an Impossiball - an icosahedron on which each \"cap\" of 5 faces may be rotated, allow the faces to migrate around the surface.\n\nPatent Number: US4474376 Popular Name: Impossiball Inventor(s): William O. Gustafson Date Issued: October 2, 1984\n\nThe canonical Impossiball mechanism - an icosahedron on which each \"cap\" of 5 faces may be rotated, allow the faces to migrate around the surface. With one piece removed the toy still holds together and the game turns into a variant of the 15-Puzzle; adjacent triangular pieces may be slid into the gap.\n\nPatent Number: US4474377 Popular Name: Inventor(s): Jonathan J. Ashley Date Issued: October 2, 1984\n\nA combination of a 2x2x2 cube and a Dino cube. The internal mechanism is a stella octangula from a Dino Cube with rotating tips (like an Alexander's Star), but deep-cut with an embedded 2x2x2 mechanism.\n\nPatent Number: US4496155 Popular Name: Star of David Inventor(s): Israel Goldfarb Date Issued: January 9, 1985\n\nThe puzzle has the shape of a stella octangula. The core octahedron has a 2x2x2 mechanism like a modified Pyramorphix, but the tips can rotate as well.\n\nPatent Number: US4500090 Popular Name: Inventor(s): Antoliono Nieto Date Issued: February 19, 1985\n\nVery similar to the Alexander's Star, but with a more complicated mechanism of grooves.\n\nPatent Number: US4506891 Popular Name: Alexander's Star Inventor(s): Adam Alexander Date Issued: March 26, 1985\n\nThe popular Alexander's Star puzzle; a great dodecahedron where each vertex rotates.

Next, a generalized extension mechanism for making a 2x2x(2+1) - and the application of that to polyhedra. Then duplicating the extension to produce a 2x2x(2+2), and the logical follow-on of 2x(2+2)x(2+2) and (2+2)x(2+2)x(2+2) puzzles, and suggestions for polyhedra to embed the mechanism within. It goes on to suggest a possible true 4x4x4 mechanism, but does not give details. Wow!\n\nPatent Number: US4593908 Popular Name: Inventor(s): Baky B. Ibrahim Date Issued: June 10, 1986\n\nA deep-cut order-2 vertex-centered octahedron based on a 2x2x2 embedded within an cuboctahedron with pyramidal tips that rotate on the underlying faces and split along their edges.\n\nPatent Number: US4600199 Popular Name: Professor's Cube Inventor(s): Udo Krell Date Issued: July 15, 1986\n\nAnother hefty patent.
