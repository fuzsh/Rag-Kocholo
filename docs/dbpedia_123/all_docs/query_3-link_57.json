        "text": "Input for Graphical and Text Solutions\n\nIn order to obtain a solution (Graphical or Text), the user must describe the appearance of the puzzle to the computer. This is done by entering the color of the squares on each of the six sides of the cube into the computer. Each side of the Rubik's Cube contains 9 squares--a total of 54 squares. The original Rubik's Cube, produced by Ideal Toy Corporation, along with other similar brands, will have the following six unique colors on its squares: (B)lue, (G)reen, (O)range, (R)ed, (W)hite, and (Y)ellow. If your cube does not have all of these colors, then you first must choose option 4 from the main menu to \"set valid colors\" for the cube before you can input the cube's colors.\n\nThe input routine is the same for the graphic solution option and the text solution option. To begin, place the cube in front of you and designate one side to be the front--it will face you. To input colors on the Rubik's Cube, you will enter the color symbol pertaining to each of the squares, beginning with those on the top, then front, right, back, left, and bottom. For a graphic illustration of these sides, you may want to view the instructions in the program, option 3. If you have set your own valid color symbols through option 4, then the first line of instructions below will differ slightly after displaying \"Press\". The colors on each side are to be input from top to bottom, left to right by pressing the valid color symbol. If you make a mistake, press the left arrow and then press the correct color symbol. The input screen will look like the following after you have entered the colors on the top and part of the front:\n\n+==== Input Colors on Rubik's Cube ====+\n\n| |\n\n| +-------+ |\n\n| | W G G | Press: B, G, O, R, W, Y |\n\n|T| | or Space to remove entry |\n\n|o| G W R | or -> for next square |\n\n|p| | or <- for previous square |\n\n| | R B B | or ESC when finished. |\n\n| +-------+ |\n\n| +-------++-------++-------++-------+ |\n\n|F| Y R _ || _ _ _ || _ _ _ || _ _ _ | |\n\n|r| || || || | |\n\n|o| _ _ _ || _ _ _ || _ _ _ || _ _ _ | |\n\n|n| || || || | |\n\n|t| _ _ _ || _ _ _ || _ _ _ || _ _ _ | |\n\n| +-------++-------++-------++-------+ |\n\n| +-------+ Right Back Left |\n\n|B| _ _ _ | |\n\n|o| | |\n\n|t| _ _ _ | |\n\n|t| | |\n\n|o| _ _ _ | |\n\n|m+-------+ |\n\n+======================================+\n\nIf you press a valid color symbol and it does not display on the screen, then there are already 9 squares entered with that color. You probably mistyped one of the other squares. To make a correction, press the left or right arrow keys until the cursor appears at the square that needs to be corrected; then press the new color.\n\nAfter entering the colors for the top, front, right, back, and left sides, then place the cube so that the front is facing you and the top side is facing up. To enter the color symbols on the bottom, tilt the cube so that the front becomes the top and the bottom becomes the front, temporarily. Now, enter the colors from top to bottom, left to right as you see them on the front. After doing so, tilt the cube back so that it has its original front and top. You may want to check to make sure that everything was entered correctly. If you encounter an error, then you will need to move the cursor to the positions that need to be changed. First clear them by pressing the space bar; then enter the correct color symbols. When you have finished entering, the screen will look similar to the following:\n\n+==== Input Colors on Rubik's Cube ====+\n\n| |\n\n| +-------+ |\n\n| | W G G | Press: B, G, O, R, W, Y |\n\n|T| | or Space to remove entry |\n\n|o| G W R | or -> for next square |\n\n|p| | or <- for previous square |\n\n| | R B B | or ESC when finished. |\n\n| +-------+ |\n\n| +-------++-------++-------++-------+ |\n\n|F| Y R O || Y W W || R O O || B Y B | |\n\n|r| || || || | |\n\n|o| W O O || B B O || Y R Y || B G O | |\n\n|n| || || || | |\n\n|t| G B B || W G O || G Y G || Y R Y | |\n\n| +-------++-------++-------++-------+ |\n\n| +-------+ Right Back Left |\n\n|B| O W R | |\n\n|o| | |\n\n|t| G Y W | |\n\n|t| | |\n\n|o| R R W | |\n\n|m+-------+ |\n\n+======================================+\n\nAt this point, you may press the ESC key. If you press the ESC key before all 54 squares have been filled, then the following message is displayed, \"Input is incomplete. Try again? (Y/N)\". If you enter 'N', then the program returns to the menu. You may continue inputting by pressing 'Y'. If you entered a side in an improper manner, especially the bottom, then this message will display, \"A side is incorrect. Try again? (Y/N)\". To correct your mistakes, press 'Y' and then clear the squares that are incorrect and then re-enter them.\n\nGraphical Solution\n\nAfter ESC is pressed during the input routine, the computer will then generate the entire solution within the next 1 to 2 seconds, if the puzzle can be solved. It is possible to have a Rubik's Cube that is impossible to solve. This can happen if a person takes apart the pieces of the puzzle and puts them back in an improper order. If a person randomly puts back the pieces, then there is only a one in twelve chance that the puzzle has a solution. If no solution is possible the following message is displayed:\n\nAn error has been detected.\n\nPossibly, you have an im-\n\npossible cube.\n\nPress any key.\n\nIf a solution is possible, then the screen will clear and a graphical sketch of the Rubik's Cube will appear along with a new set of instructions (shown below). To see the first move, you must press either the space bar, the right arrow, or the Enter key. One move of the solution will appear in large symbols, underneath the phrase, \"Do the move:\". The number of moves made will appear followed by the total number of moves required in the complete solution. The screen is formatted similarly as show below:\n\nGraphical Solution\n\nDo the move:\n\nT+\n\n------------ A graphical Rubik's\n\nCube will appear here\n\n1 move with the colors currently\n\nout of 134 on the front side after\n\nthe move has been made.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nPress: Space, ->, or Enter and perform\n\nmove shown above, then compare side(s);\n\nor (T, F, R, P, L, B) to view sides;\n\nor <- for previous move; or ESC to quit.\n\nEach move will either: 1) turn one side independently of the others, or 2) rotate the entire cube so that a new side becomes the front.\n\nFirst, most moves will consist of a sides' symbol (T, F, R, L, or B) and a rotation (+, 2, or -). This move means to turn the corresponding side clockwise (if a + follows), or counter- clockwise (if a - follows), or 2 times either way (if a 2 follows). Each move is made as if you are viewing it face to face. For Example, T+ means \"turn the Top side clockwise.\" Furthermore, B- means \"turn the Bottom side counter-clockwise\" as if you are looking at it from the bottom. (See illustrations on next page)\n\nILLUSTRATIONS: The six faces are indicated by their initials: top (T), right (R), front (F), left (L), posterior (P), and bottom (B).\n\nKeeping the front face oriented toward youall clockwise rotations are shown. To make counter-clockwise turns, simply rotate the faces in the opposite directions. All rotations should be made as though you were viewing each face from the front. A clockwise turn would always be a twist to the right as if viewed from the front. See illustrations above.\n\n(Text/Graphic illustrations taken from The Simple Solution to Cubic Puzzles, p. 52)\n\nAnother move might be to Rotate the Cube (RC). RC+ means to rotate the cube clockwise as if you were looking at the top. Therefore, the right side becomes the new front, the front becomes the left side, and the top remains the same. RC- and RC2 mean to rotate the cube counter-clockwise and twice, respectively, as if you are viewing the cube from the top.\n\nAfter completing the move, compare the colors on the side displayed with the colors on the corresponding side of your cube. To view the colors on the other sides, press T, F, R, P, L, or B.\n\nTo see the next move, press either the space bar, right arrow, or Enter key. The colors on the new front side will appear, as a result of making the next move. Compare this side with yours and continue to make moves until your cube is solved. If you make a mistake, then undo the move you made. You may then need to either make the proper move or have to press the left arrow key to view the previous move.\n\nAfter you have completed all the moves, the computer will \"congratulate\" you. If you want to return to the main menu without completing all the moves, then press the ESC key.\n\nText Solution\n\nAfter ESC is pressed during the input routine, the computer will then generate the entire solution within the next 1 to 2 seconds, if the puzzle can be solved. It is possible to have a Rubik's Cube that is impossible to solve. This can happen if a person takes apart the pieces of the puzzle and puts them back in an improper order. If a person randomly puts back the pieces, then there is only a one in twelve chance that the puzzle has a solution. If no solution is possible the following message is displayed:\n\nAn error has been detected.\n\nPossibly, you have an im-\n\npossible cube.\n\nPress any key.\n\nIf a solution is possible, then a new set of instructions will be displayed. To see the first move, you must press either the space bar, the right arrow, or the Enter key. One move of the solution will appear between two arrows as displayed below, underneath the Right and Back sides. The number of moves made will appear followed by \"move out of\" and then the total number of moves required in the complete solution, as show below:\n\n+============ Text Solution ===========+\n\n| |\n\n| +-------+ |\n\n| | R G W | Press: Space, ->,or Enter |\n\n|T| | and peform move shown |\n\n|o| B W G | below then compare sides; |\n\n|p| | or <- for previous move; |\n\n| | B R G | or ESC to quit. |\n\n| +-------+ |\n\n| +-------++-------++-------++-------+ |\n\n|F| Y W W || R O O || B Y B || Y R O | |\n\n|r| || || || | |\n\n|o| W O O || B B O || Y R Y || B G O | |\n\n|n| || || || | |\n\n|t| G B B || W G O || G Y G || Y R Y | |\n\n| +-------++-------++-------++-------+ |\n\n| +-------+ Right Back Left |\n\n|B| O W R | |\n\n|o| | |\n\n|t| G Y W | --> T+ <-- |\n\n|t| | |\n\n|o| R R W | 1 move out of 134|\n\n|m+-------+ |\n\n+======================================+\n\nEach move will either: 1) turn one side independently of the others, or 2) rotate the entire cube so that a new side becomes the front.\n\nFirst, most moves will consist of a sides' symbol (T, F, R, L, or B) and a rotation (+, 2, or -). This move means to turn the corresponding side clockwise (if a + follows), or counter-clockwise (if a - follows), or 2 times either way (if a 2 follows). Each move is made as if you are viewing it face to face. For Example, T+ means \"turn the Top side clockwise.\" Furthermore, B- means \"turn the Bottom side counter-clockwise\" as if you are looking at it from the bottom. (See illustrations of moves under the topic Graphical Solution)\n\nAnother move might be to Rotate the Cube (RC). RC+ means to rotate the cube clockwise as if you were looking at the top. Therefore, the right side becomes the new front, the front becomes the left side, and the top remains the same. RC- and RC2 mean to rotate the cube counter-clockwise and twice, respectively, as if you are viewing the cube from the top.\n\nAfter completing the move, compare the colors on the sides of your cube with the colors on the corresponding sides displayed.\n\nTo see the next move, press either the space bar, right arrow, or Enter key. The colors on the new sides will appear, as a result of making the next move. Compare these sides with yours and continue to make moves until your cube is solved. If you make a mistake, then undo the move you made. You may then need to either make the proper move or have to press the left arrow key to view the previous move.\n\nAfter you have completed all the moves, the computer will \"congratulate\" you. If you want to return to the main menu without completing all the moves, then press the ESC key.\n\nInstructions\n\nChoosing option 3 from the main menu allows the user to view a brief description of each of the menu options. It will also emphasize that the first option that should be chosen (after reading the instructions) is number 4, Set Valid Colors. The program must know the exact colors used on your cube in order to provide a solution.\n\nAfter option 4 is completed, you may then enter the color symbols on the cube into the computer by either choosing option 1 or 2. Both the Graphical Solution and the Text Solution use the same input routine. After describing the cube to the computer, the program will either remain in text mode (if a text solution was desired) or will enter graphics mode (if a graphical solution was desired).\n\nSet Valid Colors\n\nThe cube has six sides, each with a unique color in its original state. However, not all versions of the cube puzzle have the same six unique colors. The original Rubik's Cube, produced by Ideal Toy Corporation, has as its colors, blue, green, orange, red, white, and yellow. Other cubes produced by different corporations have colors such as purple, green, orange, pink, white, and yellow. There many other variations.\n\nThe Computer Oriented Solutions to the Rubik's Cube program solves the puzzle by placing each of the colors on its own side. Thus, the computer needs to know the exact colors used on your cube. Instead of entering the actual name of the color, the computer will accept a one letter color symbol, such as the first letter in the name of the color. Six unique color symbols must be entered in order to properly describe the appearance of the cube.\n\nIf your cube has the same six colors that are on the original Rubik's Cube, then you can press the Enter key six times so that the program defaults to the first letter of the following colors: (B)lue, (G)reen, (O)range, (R)ed, (W)hite, (Y)ellow. If your cube has colors other than these, then you must enter the six color symbols that are on your cube before you can obtain a Graphical or Text Solution. To do so, press a one letter color symbol to replace the default values that are shown that differ. If some of the color symbols match, then press the Enter key to select the default value shown.\n\nTest Program\n\nChoosing option 5 brings you to the routine that tests the program Computer Oriented Solutions to the Rubik's Cube. Furthermore, this option provides statistical facts pertaining to this computer oriented solution. The first command requiring a response is:\n\nEnter # of cubes to solve (1-14): --\n\nYou must enter a number between 1 to 14 indicating the number of imaginary cubes that you want the computer to solve. Suppose you enter 10. The computer will simulate 10 solved cubes within its memory. The next command displayed is:\n\nEnter # of random turns (1-30): --\n\nYou must enter a number between 1 to 30 indicating the number of random turns (or moves) to make to each of the 10 solved puzzles. If you choose a relatively small number, less than 15, then the puzzle will not be very mixed up. However, you may want to gather statistics for solutions to cubes that are not mixed up well. For our sake, let's choose 30 random turns. Each turn is randomly chosen from the following moves:\n\nT+, T2, T-, F+, F2, F-, R+, R2, R-,\n\nL+, L2, L-, B+, B2, B-, RC+, RC2, RC-\n\nThe notation of moves are explained in the Graphical Solution section. With 10 cubes each randomly scrambled, the computer then attempts to solve each one. The program stores the number of moves it took to solve each cube, and then displays the cube number followed by the number of moves it took to solve the puzzle. The program then displays the \"Average # of moves\", \"Most moves\", and \"Least moves\".\n\nStatistically speaking, the program will solve a randomly mixed up cube in an average of 140 moves (including Rotating Cube moves). Without counting Rotation moves, the program will solve a cube in an average of 125 moves (assuming 15 rotations). Other authors of algorithm solutions do not include Rotating Cube moves in their statistics, but only include those moves that permute the colors on the cube. The program solution seems to have an upper limit of approximately 170 moves (including RC's). The least number of moves needed to solve the cube is trivially 0, if the random moves leave the cube unchanged.\n\nAt this point in time, the program will always solve a valid Rubik's Cube. However, in the developmental stages of this program, the computer did not always solve the puzzle correctly. In such cases, this Test Program routine displays the set of random moves the computer made to its puzzle in order for the user to recreate the error and detect the part of the program needing correction.\n\nResearch - History\n\nThe Rubik's Cube, which is also called the Magic Cube, is a three by three by three inch cube. A cube has six sides or faces which contain a different color. Each face is divided up into nine squares. A brilliant inner mechanism of a spring loaded spindle allows sides of the cube to be rotated either vertically or horizontally and independent of the other sides. In the cube's pristine condition it has a solid color on each face, but is mixed up by just a few random moves. The cube comes in six different colors which can then be mixed up. The original Rubik's Cube has these six colors: white, yellow, orange, red, green, and blue. The object is to get the cube back to its original positions so that all six sides have nine identical squares with respect to their colors.\n\nThis great puzzle, the Rubik's Cube, was invented by Erno Rubik, who has held degrees in architectural engineering and interior design and teaches at the Academy of Applied Arts in Budapest, Hungary. From this job of teaching he only earned an estimated $1,820 a year. Although he was licensed the right to the cube at a modest fee, he made $800,000 for 1980-81.\n\nThe summer of 1974 was when Rubik had thought about the laws of geometry and had started playing with the ideas of a three dimensional object that could rotate around any of the three axes. He kept turning the object in his mind till he could turn the theoretical construction gloating in his head into something real. He had a problem and wanted to make a mechanical devise capable of converting all of the complicated movements into simple twists and turns that would change the arrangement of squares on the faces of an actual cube. After working hard on his model he gave a few turns and then found out that he made a puzzle to solve.\n\nWeeks went by and he finally got some of the different sections of the cube back to their starting point. What had started to be an aid for his students to give greater experience in dealing with three dimensional objects turned out to be much more.\n\nIn 1975, he wrote up the details of the cube's construction and obtained a patent. Rubik then interested a small toy-manufacturing co-operative, Polutechnika, in his invention and soon it was in mass production. The original production run of 5000 was shipped to Hungarian stores just before Christmas 1977. Within a few days they had sold out, and 7000 more cubes were rushed off the production line.\n\nIn 1980, cubes were bought at prices from $5 to $15. A total of 30 million of the cubes were purchased worldwide by 1983. These cubes were sold in all kinds of shops. In Rubik's homeland, Hungary, a controlled economy had not kept up with demand for manufacture of the cube, and they tended to buy three or four at a time when they were available. In the United States, Hong Kong, and the Caribbean, by arrangement with Komsumex, one of Hungary's import/export agencies, the Ideal Toy Corp. manufactured 1.5 million cubes every month. Logical Games Inc., of Haymarket, Va., which introduced the puzzle to the United States under the name Magic Cube in 1979, has manufactured the Cube.\n\nOne reason why Ideal Toy Corporation was so successful with the selling of the Rubik's Cube was because they advertised. Helfgart, Towne & Silverstein, were the company's agency for 16 years. The Rubik's Cube showed up at a Toy Fair for the first time in February 1980, but its reception was less than spectacular. Beginning the 4th of July weekend, advertising started with two weeks of television exposure using the 30-second commercial made up of three vignettes, and then four weeks using three 10-second spots, each of which was one of the vignettes. The television advertising was used in four major markets along with small-space newspaper ads. After a respite during the summer, advertising started again in September 1981, and was in 100 spot markets by December 1981.\n\nIdeal Toy Corporation agreed to be acquired by the toy division of CBS Inc. in a transaction valued at about $58 million. Under terms of the proper acquisition, CBS would pay $14.85 a share for the 3.9 million outstanding common shares of Ideal, which is based in Hollis, Queens. For the fiscal year 1981, the first full year to include results from sales of the cube, Ideal reported a net income of $19.1 million or $4.94 a share versus a loss of $15.45 million in 1980 and income of $3.7 million in 1979.\n\nMagic Puzzler, Wonderful Puzzler, and Le Cube, are all variations of Rubik's Cubes except that they do not bear the trademark of the Rubik's Cube and are made by companies other than Ideal. These puzzles retail one-third the price of Rubik's Cube and were selling very well. Ideal had filed dozens of civil suits against cube distributors and retailers across the country. In Federal District Court of Manhattan alone there were seven suits pending, one against the largest distributors, the John Hansen Company of Milbrae California. In May of 1981, Ideal charged Hansen with packaging its cube so that customers would mistake the puzzle for Rubik's Cube. Hansen then sold his cube under the name of Le Cube. Ideal Toy Corporation also filed a suit against United Supply Corporation, claiming unfair competition and trade dress copying of Ideals popular Rubik's Cube. Ideal brought Macy's to court in April of 1981, for displaying hundreds of nameless cubes piled right next to a video screen continuously showing an advertisement for Rubik's Cube. Macy's agreed not to sell nameless cubes in that way anymore, and in return Ideal agreed not to discuss the case publicly.\n\nThe privately held Moleculon Research Corporation of Cambridge filed a $60 million patent infringement suit against Ideal in Federal District Court in Delaware. Moleculon contends that Mr. Nichol's 1972 American patent for a cubic \"pattern-forming puzzle\" which closely resembles the 30 million cubes that Ideal sold worldwide since 1980, beat Rubik's invention by 2 years. Rubik holds a 1974 patent for his devise in Hungary but never applied for one in the United States or elsewhere. Mr. Nichol's said he has been trying to sell his puzzle since 1969 but was rejected because Moleculon did not want to show a prototype until it received a patent protection. Morris & Safford, of Ideal say Moleculon's 1972 patent was invalid because the ideas contained in it were not original and that Mr. Nichol's patent, which primarily describes a cube held together by magnets, did not cover the mechanical devise that enables puzzle mechanical solvers to move each piece of Rubik's Cube independently.\n\nResearch - Competitions\n\nThe first organized cube competition began on January 4, 1980. Kate Fried organized the competition in Budapest, Hungary at the Youth Mathematical Circle and at a Magic Cube Fans Club. Each competitor had to supply his own cube and put it in a cardboard box with his name on it. The judge(s) then scrambled the cubes identically and put them back in their boxes. Viktor Toth, a student, won this first competition in 55 seconds. After this competition, the winner and the runner-up had a play-off in which each scrambled the other's cube. Toth won this competition also.\n\nThe second competition was conducted in March, and over a thousand people came, packing into several rooms. This competition consisted of those people who had previously shown that they can solve the cube in less than 90 seconds. Nine people competed in the competition. The winner solved his cube in 40 seconds.\n\nThe first to try her skill publicly with the cube in America was Zsa Zsa Gabor, who was hired by the Ideal Toy Corporation, to promote the creation of her fellow Hungarian. The first regional competition of the title of the United States Rubik's Cube championship was held on July 25, 1981.\n\nResearch - Solution Manuals\n\nWithout help, solving the Rubik's Cube could have taken several months. For skilled mathematicians it would have taken several weeks to complete a cube. The most advanced computer would have taken 1.4 million years to examine all its 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possible combinations. The solution to the Rubik's Cube, along with many other puzzles, was found by the use of abstract algebra, or group theory. A person did not have to know group theory to solve these puzzles. All a person had to do was learn or memorize a solution given by authors that have written books about the solutions of the puzzles. Once a person had read and learned the book well, that person could usually solve a puzzle with great ease.\n\nJames G. Nourse, a Stanford University Chemist who worked out his formula during his Christmas vacation, gets the Rubik's Cube back to its proper place in one minute. Nourse has sold over one million copies of his solution book, The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube. He is also the author of The Simple Solution to Cubic Puzzles, which teaches the reader how to solve the Pyraminx, Missing Link, the Barrel, Picture Cube, Rubik's Magic Snake, and the Octagon.\n\nThe Hawaiian high school student, Minh Thai, wrote The Winning Solution, which reveals his strategy and racing secrets for the Rubik's Cube. He also wrote a solution book for Rubik's Revenge, a four by four by four cube puzzle. Minh's book, The Winning Solution to Rubik's Revenge, also reveals his strategy and racing secrets for a puzzle. Minh became the U.S. National Champion at the Rubik's Cube-a-Thon aired on ABC's That's Incredible on December 7, 1981, by unscrambling Rubik's Cube in 26.04 seconds. He also restored seven scrambled cubes in under 30 seconds each in a public exhibition in Los Angeles.\n\nAnother author of a solution book was Patrick Bassert. Bassert was only 13 years old when he sold 750,000 copies of his solution book, You Can Do The Cube, in London and earned more than $60,000. The appeal of his book is its relative clarity, and he accompanied his instructions with a system of diagrams and symbols showing how to rotate and move the squares. He and his cousin began charting basic moves on a tattered piece of graph paper that grew quickly into his book. He claims that \"doing the cube depends not so much on math as on logic. You need to think logically and see what's happening to see the logic of the relationships between the various pieces, then it becomes clear.\"\n\nResearch - Group Theory\n\nMost of the people who wrote solutions to various puzzles used group theory. The following is a brief introduction to the group theory used to solve puzzles. A group, G, is a set of elements with a well defined binary operation, (+), such that:\n\n1) If a, b are elements of Group G, then so is a(+)b (closure under operation);\n\n2) There exists an element e of Group G such that a(+)e= a =e(+)a for all a an element of G (identity);\n\n3) If a is an element of G, there exists an element a' of G such that a(+)a'= e =a(+)a (inverse);\n\n4) If a, b, and c are elements of G, then (a(+)b)(+)c= a(+)(b(+)c) (associative law).\n\nA permutation of the cube is a sequence of moves that rearrange the pieces and color squares of the puzzle. There are over 4.3 quintillion unique permutations for a standard Rubiks Cube. Each permutation is considered an element of Group G. The group consists of the collection of all unique permutations of the cube. There are six basic moves or permutations of the cube:\n\nT+, F=, R+, P+, L+, B+,\n\nWhere each letter represents a side of the cube,\n\nAnd + indicates a 90 degree turn clockwise.\n\nBy combining the above moves, all the other elements of the group can be generated. Some other elements include: R+F+, L+B+B+T+.\n\nThe binary operation, (+), is defined as combining two elements in the group, which means to perform them in sequence. If this is a group, then the combination of any two members will result in a permutation that is a member of the collection.\n\nThe permutation that results in no change is called the identity permutation. The order of the permutation is the least number of times that the permutation needs to be performed to get the identity permutation. For example, the permutation element R2F2 has an order of 6 since the identity element is obtained by combining the moves R2F2 six times. No element has an order larger than 1260. The permutation which undoes a given permutation and gives the identity is called its inverse. A group does not have to be commutative, but when the order in which two permutations are combined is not important, it is said to commute. The Group G, of permutations, is not commutative.\n\nAll permutations have cycles which switch certain pieces around; and if this permutation is done enough times, the original permutation shows up again. The length of a cycle is the number of elements in the cycle, and the order of a cycle is its length. A transposition is a cycle of length two. Two cycles are disjoint if there are no common positions which are formed in both. A permutation which is the product of an even number of transpositions is called even, and one which is the product of an odd number of transpositions is called odd. If every completed move of a puzzle is an even permutation and its eventual desired permutation is odd, then the puzzle is impossible to solve.\n\nResearch - Group Theory Solutions\n\nThe basic mathematical objective is to restore the cube from any scrambled pattern back to its original position, where each side has a solid color. In general, it is desirable to obtain a set of moves to obtain a particular pattern from any other valid pattern.\n\nThe group of all possible permutations is as follows. The 8 corner pieces can be permuted among themselves in any way, giving 8! ways (! means factorial), and the 12 edge pieces can be permuted among themselves in any of 12! ways, except that the total permutation of corners and edges must be even. Further, independently of the movement of pieces, it is possible to flip the orientations of any two edge pieces and twist any two corner cubes in opposite directions. This means that it is possible to orientate all but one of the edges or corners--the orientation of the last one being forced. This means there are a total of\n\n8 12\n\n8! 12! 3 2 19\n\nN = ------ x --- x --- = 43252003274489856000 ~ 4.3 x 10\n\n2 3 2\n\n27 14 3 2\n\n= 2 x 3 x 5 x 7 x 11\n\ndifferent patterns. The total number of ways a person can reassemble the cube after taking it apart is indicated by the numerator N. The denominator of 12 indicates that there are 12 distinct orbits of constructible patterns. (An orbit is the set of all patterns reachable from a given pattern by application of our group. It is impossible to get out of one orbit into another by use of the group of motions.) If the cube is taken apart and randomly reassembled, then there is only a 1/12 chance of being able to solve the cube.\n\nThe following people are known for their developments of algorithms to solve the Rubik's Cube by using group theory. Morwen B. Thistlethwaite has done much work in the area of computing to find efficient algorithms. He had his algorithm down to 52 moves to solve the cube, but he was hoping to lower this to 50 by doing more computing. Thistlethwaite believes that it may be reducible to 45 with a lot of effort and researching.\n\nIn an article in the Journal of Recreational Mathematics, John Conway and Dave Benson showed how to always restore the cube in at most 100 moves. They did bottom edges, then bottom corners and middle edges together and then use their tables to first position and then orient the top layer, in at most 13 to 19 moves respectively. Roy Nelson solves the cube by doing the bottom and middle, then orienting top corners, then positioning them, then orienting top edges, then positioning them. Without having a cube, Hanke Bremer produced a solution. He gets corners in place, then oriented, then edges in place then oriented. Michel Daughpin, a sixth year student at a lycee in Luxembourg, has a method similar to Bremer's.\n\n3-D Jackson has compiled \"The Cube Dictionary\" giving about 177 one layer processes. He claims that these allow the following algorithm to produce at most 92 moves: solve bottom edges (10 moves); bottom corners (22); middle edges (28); upper corners in place (8); then orient (14); upper edges (10).\n\nGerzson Keri says he can do two layers in at most 57 moves and that he believes any one layer process can be done in at most 18 moves. He claims to have over 100 one layer processes of at most 15 moves. He has published a lengthy two-part article in Hungary about his solution. One of his methods is entirely tabular--proceeding one piece at a time, seeing where it is and then looking up a process to get it correctly in place. The table contains 24 + 21 + 18 + ... + 6 + 3 + 24 + 22 + 20 + ... + 4 + 2 = 264 entries of which 5 are impossible and 20 are trivial. There are at most 182 moves that are required.\n\nDue to Adam Kertesz, Bill McKeeman has an algorithm which does two layers, then upper corners, then orients upper edges and then upper corners. Kersten Meier has a layer by layer algorithm but does not detail the working for the last layer. Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw's method does the bottom face, then the top corners, then the middle slice edges, then top edges. She claims that the algorithm produces an average of 80 moves.\n\nBased on Penroses algorithm, solving bottom edges, middle slice edges, top edges, then corners in place then oriented, Zoltan Perjes wrote out his own algorithm. He also outlined Rubik's original fast method: down corners, upper corners in place, then oriented, three down edges, three upper edges, the other down and upper edges, then the middle slice edges. Don Taylor does down edges, down corners, middle edges, upper corners in place, upper edges in place, upper corners oriented, then upper edges oriented.\n\nMichael Vaughan-Lee has made a careful study of an edge first process: down edges (13), three middle edges (14), upper edges and last middle edge (17), corners in place (30) and then in orientation (38), but the last two steps can be reduced to 26 + 24, 32 + 22 or 28 + 22, giving a maximum of 98 moves.\n\nDavid Sigmaster's algorithm looks like this:\n\n1) Put all bottom edges correctly in place.\n\n2) Put all bottom corners correctly in place.\n\n3) Put middle slice edges correctly in place.\n\n4) Flip top edges so all upper faces are up.\n\n5) Make top orientation correct.\n\n6) Put top edges correctly in place.\n\n7) Put top corners in their right positions.\n\n8) Twist top corners into their correct orientations.\n\nWill there ever be an algorithm that is the shortest? Trivially, some positions of the cube can be unscrambled in 0, 1, 2, or 3 moves. Given any scrambled cube, what is the least number of moves required to restore the cube to its six sides of solid colors? There are several ways to show that at least 17 moves are required for the most scrambled cube. Can every cube be solved in at most 17 moves? The algorithm that obtains the shortest set of moves is know as Gods algorithm.\n\nDescription of Program Solution Strategy\n\nIf a person is able to solve a puzzle himself in a logical fashion, then a person probably can write a program to solve the puzzle. With this thought as a basis, how does a person solve the Rubik's Cube? There are 12 corner cubes, 8 edge cubes, and 6 center cubes that need to be positioned and oriented correctly so that each of the 6 sides contain a solid color. First, you need an overall strategy or algorithm before considering the smaller details. The following is a brief sketch of the algorithm that I use to solve the Rubik's Cube:\n\n1) Position and orient Top edges\n\n2) Position and orient Top corners\n\n3) Position and orient Vertical edges\n\n4) Position Bottom corners\n\n5) Orient Bottom corners\n\n6) Position Bottom edges\n\n7) Orient Bottom edges\n\nThe center cube on each side does not \"move\", and they determine the color to be restored on their sides'. For each of the above steps, particular cube edges or cube corners need to be located and then positioned and oriented in a certain spot. There are a finite number of places that this particular piece could be in. For each spot, group theory can aid in determining the set of moves to make to the cube to position and/or orient a particular piece without \"messing up\" too much of the rest of the puzzle. Once one piece is put in place, another piece needs to be located on this puzzle and then positioned and oriented.\n\nWith this manual algorithm, I could program the computer to solve the Rubik's Cube. The two biggest questions that I needed answers to were, \"how do I let the computer know what the puzzle looks like?\" and \"how do I tell the computer to move the cube?\"\n\nThe computer needs to know the colors on each of the 54 squares of the puzzle. The program accepts a letter as a color symbol for each of the squares and stores it in the designated array position. The color symbols on the top side are stored in A[1..9], the front side colors are stored in A[10..18], the right in A[19..27], the posterior (back) in A[28..36], the left in A[37..45], and the bottom in A[46..54].\n\nWith the appearance of the puzzle, the computer does a step of the program's overall algorithm and finds a spot that does not have the correct piece. The program then searches for the misplaced cube by asking itself logical \"if-then\" statements regarding the positions and colors of the squares. When it finds the correct piece, it reads a set of moves to position and/or orient this piece. The program then branches to a subroutine that \"moves\" the puzzle. To make a move, the program will actually exchange some of the variables in the array.\n\nAfter all the moves have been made to place the desired piece, the computer will then know the exact appearance of the new puzzle as if a person had actually performed the moves. The program then does the next part of its algorithm and repeats the above process until it has completed each of the seven steps.\n\nPartial Pascal Solution Listing\n\n{ -- SOLUTION.INC}\n\nprocedure SolveTopEdges ({giving} var MoveError: Boolean);\n\n{ -- This procedure will store the moves in Solution to restore top edges. }\n\n{ -- Strategy: Work on front-top edge then rotate cube to next face. }\n\nvar\n\nFace: Integer;\n\nTmid, Fmid: Char;\n\nbegin\n\nfor Face := 1 to 4 do begin\n\nTmid := A[5];

One such cube is called the Pac Man Picture Cube which has Pac Men, ghosts, and keys on the square patches. The difference between the Rubik's Cube and this Picture Cube is that the latter's center could be incorrectly oriented. Because of this variation, this Cube is harder to solve than the Rubik's Cube and has 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 possible combinations.\n\nRubik's Pocket Cube is a two by two by two inch cube that has six sides which contain a different color. The sides of this puzzle move independently of each other. Rubik's Pocket Cube has no center piece on any of its sides and has only 3,674,160 different arrangements.\n\nRubik's Revenge is a four by four by four cube. This is the hardest puzzle on the market because of its incredible number of arrangements: 3.7 x (10 to the 45th power). The Rubik's Cube has approximately 4.3 x (10 to the 19th power). Rubik's Revenge has 8 corner pieces, 24 middle edge pieces, and 24 center pieces.\n\nBibliography\n\nAlexander, Ron, \"A Cube Popular in all Circles\", New York Times, July 21, 1981, III, 6:2.\n\nBorders, William, \"Best-Selling Author, 13, Thanks Rubik's Cube\", New York Times, October 17, 1981, I, 3:5.\n\nCarmichael, Jane, \"Figure This One Out\", Forbes, p. 34, May 1981.\n\nDougherty, Phillip H., \"Ideal Toy's Son of Rubik Cube\", New York Times, July 30, 1981, IV, 19:1.\n\nDubisch, Roy, Introduction to Abstract Algebra, p. 70, Seattle, Washington, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1965.\n\nEditors of Discover, \"Robot Cubist\", Discover, June 1982.\n\nEditors of Time, \"Hot-Selling Hungarian Horror\", Time, p. 83, March 23, 1981.\n\nEwing, John, and Kosniowski, Czes, Puzzle It Out, New York, NY, Cambridge University Press, 1982.\n\nFaludi, Susan C., \"CBS Unit Offers $58 Million for Makers of Rubik's Cube\", New York Times, April 23, 1982, IV, 3:1.\n\nHauptfuhrer, Fred, \"An Obscure Hungarian Professor Transforms America into a Nation of Cubic Rubes\", People, p. 31, May 1981.\n\nNourse, James G., The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube, New York, NY, Bantom Books 1981.\n\nNourse, James G., The Simple Solution to Cubic Puzzles, New York, NY, Bantom Books 1981.\n\nRoman, Mark, \"Rubik's Cube: Ideal Toy Takes on the Knock-Offs\", New York Times, October 4, 1981, III, 21:1.\n\nSanger, David E., \"Rubik's Rival\", NY Times, June 6, 1982, III, 19:4.\n\nSigmaster, David, Notes on Rubik's Magic Cube, Hillside, NJ, Enslow Publishers, 1981.\n\nThai, Minh, The Winning Solution to Rubik's Revenge, pp. 6,7,9, Wayne, Pennsylvania, Banbury Books, Inc., 1982.\n\nWarshofsky, Fred, \"Rubik's Cube: Madness for Millions\", Readers Digest, pp. 138-139, May 1981.\n\nAuthor's Biography\n\nDouglas E.
