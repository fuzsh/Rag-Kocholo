        "text": "I did a PF search to try to see if this was discussed before, and didn't find what I was wanting to ask about (I could have missed it).\n\nI'm writing a Rubik's Cube game C/C# program for fun (starting with a console app and working up through various GUI options). I'd like to use a standard axis representation of the Rubik's cube if it exists already. If it doesn't exist already, I'll just define my own and proceed on.\n\nDoes anybody know of any existing standards? The two images below seem to be pretty common (and they look consistent to me). They would imply that I could define the starting x-y-z planes as G-R-Y, with the origin in the corner of the GRY sub-cube. does that seem like a standard starting origin?\n\nAlso, are all Rubik's Cubes manufactured with the same initial starting position, or can you buy different new Rubik's Cubes with the colors on different sides? No big deal for my programming exercise, but I'm just curious. Maybe there is a Rubik's Cube Standards Body that I don't know about yet.\n\nFinally, can anybody recommend a good quality Rubik's cube for me to buy to play with along with my program? I've owned cheap plastic Rubik's Cubes in the past, and they were very frustrating to work with (very sticky and imprecise in their action). If there were a version with metal bearings, I'd be willing to pay for that (up to a point, of course). I think I've looked through the Amazon offerings in the past, and they all looked like cheap plastic versions.\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT -- Because of a strange forum glitch, there is another image attached at the bottom of my ost. The color oredr appears to be different in that image, but I'm not sure...https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/...yuA_6UMtCcAKjGf7HimnxDa0bqkfJveY93ywMSdna8cPA\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Rubik%E2%80%99s_cube_colors.svg/220px-Rubik%E2%80%99s_cube_colors.svg.png\n\nAttachments\n\nimages?q=tbn:ANd9GcTTkx0UeyuA_6UMtCcAKjGf7HimnxDa0bqkfJveY93ywMSdna8cPA.jpg\n\nrubik-solver.jpg\n\n220px-Rubik%E2%80%99s_cube_colors.svg.png\n\nberkeman said:\n\nAlso, are all Rubik's Cubes manufactured with the same initial starting position\n\nNo, the original Rubik's cubes from the 1980's have white and blue on opposite sides, the newer (2000 or later?) ones white and yellow on opposite sides. This includes the Pocket Cube (2x2x2, all corners), Rubik's Cube (the classic 3x3x3) and Rubik's Revenge (4x4x4). Someone else created a Professor's Cube (5x5x5) back in the 1980's. Now there is a Rubik's 5x5, also (5x5x5).\n\nLinks\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_Cube\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Revenge\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor's_Cube\n\nThe Japanese color scheme in this article shows the color scheme used in the 1980's cubes:\n\nhttps://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/japanese-western-color-schemes\n\nIn addition to the naming conventions shown in the wiki article and mentioned above, the Ideal solution books of the 1980's use a letter and number to identify planes, using \"table\" for the horizontal planes, \"book\" for the front to back vertical planes, and \"window\" for the left to right vertical planes, such as T1 for the top plane, B1 for the front plane, and W1 for the left plane. \"Tables\" are rotated \"left\" or \"right\" (as viewed from the front). \"Books\" are rotated \"up\" or \"down\" as viewed from the front. \"Windows are rotated \"clockwise\" or \"counter-clockwise\" as viewed from the front.\n\nI initially learned how to solve the Rubik's cube by noting the results of a move sequence, then taking it apart and putting it back together solved. My initial method was to solve the corners, then top, middle, bottom edges, but it turned out to be quicker to solve top and bottom edges, then the middle edges, although one of the sequences to swap two opposite edge pieces is a bit longer, which was called Rubik's maneuver.\n\nThis article starts off using down slices, but the original Rubik's maneuver started with up slices, and finished with down slices. The result is the same though.\n\nhttps://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube/Rubik's_Maneuver\n\nThe 4x4x4 version centers are not fixed. It's easier to place the top and bottom center pieces early on, just before or just after solving corners (they're independent, so the order doesn't matter). The edge pieces need to be paired up after which 3x3x3 moves can be used to solve them. With the 4x4x4, it's possible to end up with a flipped pair of edges (a flipped edge is not possible with 3x3x3, unless it's taken apart and put back together \"wrong\"). Fixing this is a somewhat lengthy sequence but fortunately you have visual cues for where you are in the process so it doesn't have to be fully memorized. The 1st and 2nd generation 4x4x4 internals includes a sphere with slots that the \"legs\" of the center pieces hook into. The 3rd generation is a bit different.\n\nThe 5x5x5 cube doesn't require learning any significantly new moves from the 4x4x4. The center \"cross\" pieces can be moved independently of the other pieces and move similar to the center pieces of a 4x4x4. The center edge pieces are the same as 3x3x3, and the outer edge pieces are the same as 4x4x4.\n\nSpeed cubers memorize patterns well enough that they don't need to see the cube state during intermediate steps, so they tend to solve one plane and then turn that plane away from them so that they only see the unsolved part of the cube. I'm only aware of \"speed\" versions of the 3x3x3 (a small amount of petroleum jelly or silicone spray can be used on the original Rubik's 3x3x3 cubes for speed) . The locking mechanism for the 3x3x3 pieces is fairly strong, while the internal locking for 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes is not quite as strong and they tend to \"snag\" mid turn if not precisely lined up, so they're not good for speed solving. Computerized virtual cubes of any size can be \"speed\" solved, but most of the speed solving targets the 3x3x3."
