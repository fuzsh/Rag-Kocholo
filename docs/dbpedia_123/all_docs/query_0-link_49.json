        "text": "At 15 months old, a rubik's cube would not be appropriate.\n\nFirst, it's kind of a complex puzzle. Most adults can't solve it. A 15 month old is going to see it as a brightly colored cube and nothing more. She will get entertainment value out of it by probably trying throw it or eat it (the stickers aren't good to eat and the individual block pieces are choking hazards). She won't even understand the goal of a rubik's cube, much less be interested in accomplishing it.\n\nSecond, most rubik's cubes I've seen are small enough the fit comfortably in an adult's hand. Being so small, she won't have the muscle control to really handle it properly. She won't be able to precisely turn the sides of the cube, much less line it up to be able to turn another side.\n\nKids at that age generally need bigger toys that require less fine motor skills. Go google toddler toys. That should give you a better idea what to look for.\n\nI would not recommend this as a toy, but for a different reason.\n\nAs a brightly colored geometric shape a Rubik's cube would probably be appealing to small children, and at that age they will likely try to put it in their mouths.\n\nMany cubes can be dismantled into separate pieces, which could be small enough to be swallowed. Also, some cubes use colored stickers for the faces which can come off and also be swallowed. That is a strong reason to avoid these as toys in my opinion.\n\nI would recommend a Rubik's Cube for a 15 month old if, and only if, the parent (or nanny or other constant companion) is able to easily solve the cube already.\n\nThis is a slightly odd answer, but I do have some experience: I can solve a Rubik's cube in under two minutes every time (under a minute if I hurry) and my three-year-old son has enjoyed playing with my Rubik's cube for the last year and a half. He doesn't play with it very often, as he has other toys that are of greater interest to him personally—but he enjoys scrambling it (and has for many many months).\n\nAlso, if I do one or two quarter turns away from the solved state and hand the cube to him, he can (if he feels like it) reverse the turns to solve the cube.\n\nSo for most 15-month-old kids, no, this would not be an appropriate gift. However, there are exceptions to that.\n\nAs for other toys, personally, I would go with almost anything from Melissa and Doug, but probably the wooden block set to start with. The set is marked ages 3+, but younger kids (yes, even down to 15 months) will enjoy picking up the smaller blocks and learning to grip (developing dexterity), and these blocks are durable and will last for years and years and years. (Actually I expect they'll last for generations, if you keep them in the family that long.)\n\nNo, a Rubik's cube is not appropriate for such a young child.\n\nObviously, they wouldn't understand what the puzzle is and what the goal is, but that wouldn't matter if they could treat it as just a brightly coloured moving cube. However, they can't treat it as just a brightly coloured moving cube. Rubik's cubes actually have a pretty limited range of movement. The only thing you can do to one is to rotate one of the faces 90°, to make it look like a cube again. If you've partially rotated a face, the only thing you can do is either fix that face or rotate the opposite one. At fifteen months, a child can't even figure out that the square block doesn't fit through the round hole; they're not gonna figure out that the brightly coloured moving cube requires you to rotate faces by 90° at a time.\n\nAdd to that the fact that new cubes are quite stiff and are a good deal larger than a toddler's hands and I'd question whether a toddler would be able to manipulate the cube at all. Net result: it's not a brightly coloured moving cube; it's just a brightly coloured cube.\n\nAnd then we get the safety problems that have been covered in plenty of other answers: peeling stickers and the cube coming apart. If all you wanted to give the child was a brightly coloured cube, you could give them one made of a single piece of plastic that isn't going to come apart. The manufacturer says that the cube is suitable for children of age 8 years and up. Partly, that's because they think that younger children won't be interested in or understand the toy but, partly, it's because it's not built in a way that's safe for much younger children.\n\nI don't think a Rubik's cube is an appropriate gift for a 15-month old child. However, I think you could give it to the child's parents, and tell them, \"Let her play with it when you think she is old enough.\"\n\nThat might be age 3, that might be age 6, that might be age 9. It really depends on when the child will take an interest in that sort of thing, and the parents are the best ones to make that judgement call.\n\nYou don't want to give the child too many things that will be tucked away for months or years (that becomes a storage hassle), but, unless the family lives in a small apartment, I don't think there's anything wrong with a few things being tucked away in a closet for later use.\n\nInsofar as other meaningful learning tools go, a globe might be a good suggestion. It's not a toy per se, but I've seen several young children take an interest in geography at an early age.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for an age-appropriate toy that the child will enjoy now, consider something more along the lines of a shape ball:\n\nThis is completely age appropriate. Toddlers love blocks, toddlers love colors, and toddlers love moving things. Bing bing bing.\n\nEven better toddler's parents hardly ever get a toy that they may play with.\n\nWhat all of the answers on here are missing is that a toddler isn't going to understand what should be done with a Rubik's cube. They don't understand that they need to solve it. It is just a group of blocks that don't fall apart... Until the toddler figure out how to tear the thing apart and figures out the easiest way to solve a Rubik's cube.\n\n(My opinion is biased as I got one for my second birthday and have pictures from 80s of me tugging it around from ages 2-6 and solving it at 4.)"
