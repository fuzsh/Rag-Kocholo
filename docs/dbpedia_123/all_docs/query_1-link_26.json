        "text": "The Rubik’s Cube is a classic colour-matching puzzle that can be enjoyed at home or on the move. The classic 2x2 cube is a highly addictive brain teaser that has fascinated fans all around the world with its iconic play. Also known as the pocket or mini cube, don’t be fooled by the cube’s smaller size, it is still a challenge with 3,674,160 permutations. The smaller puzzle cube features a new and improved mechanism that results in a smoother, faster and more reliable play. The fastest time for solving the 2x2 Rubik’s cube was under 2 seconds - challenge yourself and attempt to beat that record! Gone are the days of Rubik’s Cubes with stickers, we replaced these with colour tiles that will never fall out, never peal and never fade. Packaging may vary. Includes: 1 Rubik's 2x2 Mini"
