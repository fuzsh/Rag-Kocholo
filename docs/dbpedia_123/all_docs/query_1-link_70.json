        "text": "On this quite outdated page (from 2010, next update is not planned) you can see some solving methods for the 2x2x2 Rubik's cube. Principle of both widely used methods (Ortega, CLL) and rather theoretical ones (OFOTA, G-FASSST) is described.\n\nOn this page you will find:\n\nintuitive method\n\nLBL\n\nOrtega\n\nGuimond\n\nSOAP\n\nSortega\n\nCLL\n\npi(g) CLL\n\nOFOTA\n\nEG\n\nSS\n\nBRASS\n\nG-FASST\n\nIntuitive method\n\nBasic characteristics: a method designed for those who don't want to memorize algorithms\n\nAdvantage: no need to memorize algorithms\n\nDisadvantage: usually very high number of moves\n\nTutorial on one possible intuitive solution for a 2x2x2 Rubik's cube\n\nLBL\n\n(Layer By Layer) - basic characteristics: a method designed for beginners, takes three steps, requires 8 algorithms (excluding symmetrical cases)\n\nStep 1: intuitive solution of one layer\n\nStep 2: OLL (Orientation of Last Layer)\n\nStep 3: PLL (Permutation of Last Layer)\n\nAdvantage: relatively frequent skip of the last step\n\nDisadvantage: relatively high number of moves\n\nCuriosity: although this method is generally not recognized as the fastest one, Edouard Chambon from France has been able to break the world record with it in the average time of 3.74 seconds\n\nOrtega\n\nBasic characteristics: a method designed for advanced ones, named after Victor Ortega, takes three steps, requires 11 algorithms (excluding symmetrical cases)\n\nStep 1: intuitive solution of one face\n\nStep 2: orientation of opposite face\n\nStep 3: permutation of both layers\n\nAdvantage: easy-to-memorize method\n\nDisadvantage: on average, higher move count in comparison with a comparable Guimond method\n\nCuriosity: Josef JelÃ­nek from the Czech Republic had merit in method popularization\n\nVideo in which Syuhei Omura from Japan solves a cube in the average time of 3.45 seconds (I got the exactly same result - see a corners-first method), using the Ortega method\n\nGuimond\n\nBasic characteristics: a method designed for experienced ones, named after GaÃ©tan Guimond, takes four steps, requires 13 algorithms (excluding symmetrical cases)\n\nStep 1: intuitive solution of exactly Â¾ of a face that may contain opposite colors\n\nStep 2: orientation of opposite faces that may contain opposite colors\n\nStep 3: correct orientation of both faces\n\nStep 4: permutation of both layers\n\nAdvantage: on average, lower move count in comparison with a comparable Ortega method\n\nDisadvantages: high number of steps. It requires 21 algorithms if symmetrical cases are included. On the contrary, the Ortega method requires only 12 algorithms if symmetrical cases are included\n\nCuriosity: the world record hasn't been ever broken with this method (in case of average solve) unlike the Ortega method, LBL or CLL\n\nVideo in which Gabriel Dechichi Barbar from Brazil solves a cube in the average time of 3.46, using the Guimond method\n\nSOAP\n\n(Separate, Orient All, Permute) - basic characteristics: a method designed for connoisseurs, takes three steps, requires 59 algorithms\n\nStep 1: intuitively separate two opposite colors into respective layers so that at least two adjacent cubies would be correctly oriented\n\nStep 2: orientation of opposite faces\n\nStep 3: permutation of both layers\n\nAdvantage: especially in combination with the SS method it forms a strike weapon for speedsolving. Moreover, the method has a room for further improvement\n\nDisadvantage: longer and not easily executable algorithms in comparison with similar methods\n\nSortega\n\nBasic characteristics: a method designed for artists, named partly after the Ortega method and partly after the English word sort, takes four steps, requires 78 algorithms\n\nStep 1: intuitive creation of a 1x1x2 block of the same color and its placement to the bottom-left position on a cube\n\nStep 2: orientation of opposite faces that may contain opposite colors\n\nStep 3: correct orientation of both faces\n\nStep 4: permutation of both layers\n\nAdvantage: steps 2 and 3 can be always solved using only R and U moves which are quickly executable in general\n\nDisadvantage: if we don't trace cubies while solving, transition from the second to the third step can be quite slow-pacing\n\nCLL (part of the EG method)\n\n(Corners of Last Layer) - basic characteristics: a method designed for connoisseurs, takes two steps, requires 42 algorithms\n\nStep 1: intuitive solution of one layer\n\nStep 2: solution of the second layer\n\nAdvantage: on average, lower number of moves than methods mentioned till now\n\nDisadvantage: more difficult case recognition (in order to execute an algorithm) than methods mentioned till now\n\nCuriosity: the method is currently (2010) very popular among speedcubers\n\nNote: CLL = OLL + PLL\n\nVideo in which Åukasz CiaÅoÅ from Poland solves a cube in the average time of 2.98 seconds, using the CLL method\n\npi(g) CLL (part of the EG method)\n\nBasic characteristics: a method designed for connoisseurs, takes two steps, requires 42 algorithms\n\nStep 1: intuitive solution of Â½ of a layer\n\nStep 2: solution of the second layer + correction of the 1st layer\n\nAdvantage: similar to CLL\n\nDisadvantage: similar to CLL\n\nCuriosity: although the CLL and pi(g) CLL methods are fairly similar, pi(g) CLL has by no means such amount of popularity as CLL\n\nOFOTA\n\n(Orient opposite Face, OrienT, All) â basic characteristics: a method designed for artists, takes three steps, requires 82 algorithms (excluding symmetrical cases)\n\nStep 1: intuitive solution of one face that may contain opposite colors\n\nStep 2: orientation of opposite faces\n\nStep 3: permutation of both layers\n\nAdvantage: including symmetrical cases, the OFOFTA method has the lowest number of algorithms from the best methods\n\nDisadvantage: I cannot think of any ;-)\n\nCuriosity: right now it is rather theoretical method barely used in practice\n\nEG\n\nBasic characteristics: a method designed for experts, named after Erik Akkersdijk and Gunnar Krig, takes two steps, requires 3Â·42 = 126 algorithms (but can be reduced to 2Â·42 using the anti-CLL technique)\n\nStep 1: intuitive solution of one face, Â½ of a layer or one layer\n\nStep 2: permutation of the 1st layer + solution of the second layer\n\nAdvantages: on average, very low number of moves. More experienced cubers are able to solve the puzzle in one look in some cases, the method is very ambitious in terms of speedcubing - it is one of the most commonly used methods by 2x2x2 world speedcubing leaders\n\nDisadvantage: difficult case recognition in order to execute an algorithm\n\nCuriosity: the method has been already known since the 80's of the last century, however, it has been exposed to more detailed analysis as late as around 2005\n\nNote: EG = pi(g) CLL (also known as EG 1) + CLL + a case when only one face is solved in the first step (known as EG 2)\n\nVideo in which Anthony Brooks from the USA solves a cube in the average time of 2.79 seconds, using the EG method\n\nVideo explaining the anti-CLL technique\n\nSS\n\nBasic characteristics: a method designed for experts, named after Timothy Sun and Mitchell Stern, takes three steps, requires 61 algorithms (excluding symmetrical cases)\n\nStep 1: intuitive solution of at least Â¾ of one face\n\nStep 2: orientation of opposite faces\n\nStep 3: permutation of both layers\n\nAdvantage: easier case recognition in order to execute an algorithm in comparison with the CLL, EG, partially OFOTA method\n\nDisadvantage: I cannot think of any ;-)\n\nCuriosity: since Erik Akkersdijk invented this method, it should be properly called ASS. However, this term has already a meaning in English, thus Erik Akkersdijk has been deleted from the name\n\nVideo in which David Woner from the USA solves a cube in the average time of 2.75 seconds, mainly using the SS method\n\nBRASS\n\n(Bar, Reduce, And SS) - basic characteristics: a method designed for experts, takes three steps, requires 114 algorithms\n\nStep 1: intuitive solution of a half of a layer (1x1x2 block) at the bottom-left position + corner permutation at the right-back position\n\nStep 2: cube reduction in such a way so that the next step could be solved only by R and U moves + corner orientation at the right-back-bottom position\n\nStep 3: solution of five remaining corners\n\nAdvantage: similarly to the Sortega or SS method, there are often used R and U moves which are executable very quickly\n\nDisadvantage: time-consuming case recognition\n\nCuriosity: due to its complexity, I am not aware of a person who would use this method as his/her main\n\nG-FASSST\n\n(Guimond - First And Second Steps Squished by Thomas) - basic characteristics: a method designed for magicians, takes three steps, requires 587 algorithms (excluding symmetrical cases)\n\nStep 1: intuitive solution of at least Â¾ of one face that may contain opposite colors\n\nStep 2: orientation of opposite faces\n\nStep 3: permutation of both layers\n\nAdvantage: G-FASSST fully covers the SS (thus also Guimond and Ortega) and OFOTA methods\n\nDisadvantage: absurd number of algorithms\n\nCuriosity: when picking a method name, e.g. these proposals have been suggested: OMFG (Oh My ... Frank Morris), ONLYPHIL (only Phil), 731-132 (Phil method, just under 600 algorithms), ZB++Pocket (more algorithms than ZB [a method designed for the 3x3x3 cube] has, on a pocket cube) or SWOT\n\nFurthermore, after deciding to name it G-FASST, correct English pronunciation has been suggested as well:\n\na) Go fast\n\nb) Je(zus) fast"
