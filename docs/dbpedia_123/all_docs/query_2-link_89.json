        "text": "A combination puzzle, also known as a sequential move puzzle, is a puzzle which consists of a set of pieces which can be manipulated into different combinations by a group of operations.\n\nDescription\n\nA combination puzzle is solved by achieving a particular combination starting from a random (scrambled) combination. Often, the solution is required to be some recognisable pattern such as \"all like colours together\" or \"all numbers in order\". The most famous of these puzzles is the original Rubik's Cube, a cubic puzzle in which each of the six faces can be independently rotated. Each of the six faces is a different colour, but each of the nine pieces on a face is identical in colour, in the solved condition. In the unsolved condition colours are distributed amongst the pieces of the cube. Puzzles like the Rubik's Cube which are manipulated by rotating a section of pieces are popularly called twisty puzzles. They are often face-turning, but commonly exist in corner-turning and edge-turning varieties.\n\nThe mechanical construction of the puzzle will usually define the rules by which the combination of pieces can be altered. This leads to some limitations on what combinations are possible. For instance, in the case of the Rubik's Cube, there are a large number of combinations that can be achieved by randomly placing the coloured stickers on the cube, but not all of these can be achieved by manipulating the cube rotations. Similarly, not all the combinations that are mechanically possible from a disassembled cube are possible by manipulation of the puzzle. Since neither unpeeling the stickers nor disassembling the cube is an allowed operation, the possible operations of rotating various faces limit what can be achieved.\n\nAlthough a mechanical realization of the puzzle is usual, it is not actually necessary. It is only necessary that the rules for the operations are defined. The puzzle can be realized entirely in virtual space or as a set of mathematical statements. In fact, there are some puzzles that can only be realized in virtual space. An example is the 4-dimensional 3×3×3×3 tesseract puzzle, simulated by the MagicCube4D software.\n\nTypes\n\nThere have been many different shapes of Rubik type puzzles constructed. As well as cubes, all of the regular polyhedra and many of the semi-regular and stellated polyhedra have been made.\n\nRegular cuboids\n\nA cuboid is a rectilinear polyhedron. That is, all its edges form right angles. Or in other words (in the majority of cases), a box shape. A regular cuboid, in the context of this article, is a cuboid puzzle where all the pieces are the same size in edge length. Pieces are often referred to as \"cubies\".\n\nPicture Data Comments\n\nCommercial name: Pocket Cube\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 2×2×2\n\nSimpler to solve than the standard cube in that only the algorithms for the corner pieces are required. It is nevertheless surprisingly non-trivial to solve.\n\nCommercial name: Rubik's Cube\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×3\n\nMain article: Rubik's Cube\n\nThe original Rubik's Cube\n\nCommercial name: Rubik's Revenge\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 4×4×4\n\nSolution is much the same as 3×3×3 cube except additional (and relatively simple) algorithm(s) are required to unscramble the centre pieces and edges and additional parity not seen on the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n\nCommercial name: Professor's Cube\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 5×5×5\n\nSolution is much the same as 3×3×3 cube except additional (and relatively simple) algorithm(s) are required to unscramble the centre pieces and edges.\n\nCommercial name: V-CUBE\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 2×2×2 to 11×11×11\n\nPanagiotis Verdes holds a patent to a method which is said to be able to make cubes up to 11×11×11. He has fully working products for 2×2×2 - 9×9×9 cubes.\n\n4-Dimensional puzzle\n\nGeometric shape: Tesseract\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×3×3\n\nThis is the 4-dimensional analog of a cube and thus cannot actually be constructed. However, it can be drawn or represented by a computer. Significantly more difficult to solve than the standard cube, although the techniques follow much the same principles. There are many other sizes of virtual cuboid puzzles ranging from the trivial 3×3 to the 5-dimensional 7×7×7×7×7 which has only been solved twice so far.\n\nSlim Tower or Tower Cube\n\nRubik's Tower\n\n3×4×4\n\n2×2×6\n\nNon-uniform cuboids\n\nGeometric shape: Cuboid\n\nPiece configuration (1st): 2×2×3\n\nPiece configuration (2nd): 2×3×3\n\nPiece configuration (3rd): 3×4×4\n\nPiece configuration (4th): 2×2×6\n\nMost of the puzzles in this class of puzzle are generally custom made in small numbers. Most of them start with the internal mechanism of a standard puzzle. Additional cubie pieces are then added, either modified from standard puzzles or made from scratch. The four shown here are only a sample from a very large number of examples. Those with two or three different numbers of even or odd rows also have the ability to change their shape. The Tower Cube was manufactured by Chronos and distributed by Japanese company Gentosha Education; it is the third \"Okamoto Cube\" (invented by Katsuhiko Okamoto). It does not change form, and the top and bottom colours do not mix with the colours on the sides.\n\nSiamese cubes\n\nGeometric shape: Fused cubes\n\nPiece configuration: two 3×3×3 fused 1×1×3\n\nSiamese cubes are two or more puzzles that are fused so that some pieces are common to both cubes. The picture here shows two 3×3×3 cubes that have been fused. The largest example known to exist is in The Puzzle Museum and consists of three 5×5×5 cubes that are siamese fused 2×2×5 in two places. there is also a \"2 3x3x3 fused 2x2x2\" version called the fused cube. The first Siamese cube was made by Tony Fisher in 1981. This has been credited as the first example of a “handmade modified rotational puzzle”.\n\nExtended cubes\n\nGeometric shape: Box\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×5\n\nThese puzzles are made by bonding additional cubies to an existing puzzle. They therefore do not add to the complexity of the puzzle configuration, they just make it look more complex. Solution strategies remain the same, though a scrambled puzzle can have a strange appearance.\n\nCommercial name: Boob cube\n\nGeometric shape: Box\n\nPiece configuration: 1×1×2\n\nVery possibly the simplest regular cuboid puzzle to solve. Completely trivial solution as the puzzle consists of only two cubies.\n\nCommercial name: Void cube\n\nGeometric shape: Menger Sponge with 1 iteration\n\nPiece configuration: 3x3x3-7.\n\nMain article: Void Cube\n\nSolutions to this cube is similar to a regular 3x3x3 except that odd-parity combinations are possible with this puzzle. This cube uses a special mechanism due to absence of a central core. Commercial name: Over The Top\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 17x17x17\n\nExperimental cube made by 3-D printing of plastic invented by Oskar van Deventer. Corners are much larger in proportion, and edge pieces match that larger dimension; they are narrow, and do not resemble cubes. The rest of the cubelets are 15x15 arrays on each side of the whole cube; as planned, they would be only 4 mm on a side. The original mechanism is a 3x3x3 core, with thin \"vanes\" for the center edges; the rest of the cubelets fill in the gaps. The core has a sphere at its center. As of 2017, it is being mass produced by the Chinese company YuXin.\n\nPattern variations\n\nThere are many puzzles which are mechanically identical to the regular cuboids listed above but have variations in the pattern and colour of design. Some of these are custom made in very small numbers, sometimes for promotional events. The ones listed in the table below are included because the pattern in some way affects the difficulty of the solution or is notable in some other way.\n\nPicture Data Comments\n\nCommercial name: Junior Cube\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 2×2×2\n\nMain article: Pocket Cube § Variants\n\nMechanically identical to the Pocket Cube. However, much easier to solve as it only uses two colours.\n\nCommercial name: Fooler Cube\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×3\n\nMechanically identical to the standard 3×3×3 cube but not a real puzzle since all the faces are the same colour. There are also cubes which have only three colours, either one colour per pair of opposite faces or one colour per layer. Also known as the Dodo cube.\n\nCommercial name: Calendar Cube\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×3\n\nMechanically identical to the standard 3×3×3 cube, but with specially printed stickers for displaying the date. Much easier to solve since five of the six faces are ignored. Ideal produced a commercial version during the initial cube craze. Sticker sets are also available for converting a normal cube into a calendar.\n\nRubik's Cube for the blind\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×3\n\nMechanically identical to the standard 3×3×3 cube. However the pieces are in some way tactile to allow operation by blind persons, or to solve blindfolded. The cube pictured is the original \"Blind Man's Cube\" made by Politechnika. This is coloured the same as the standard cube, but there is an embossed symbol on each square which corresponds to a colour.\n\nCommercial Name: Magic Cube\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×3\n\nMechanically identical to the standard 3×3×3 cube. However, the numbers on the centre pieces force the solver to become aware that each one can be in one of four orientations, thus hugely increasing the total number of combinations. The number of combinations of centre face orientations is 46. However, odd combinations (overall odd number of rotations) of the centre faces cannot be achieved with legal operations. The increase is therefore x211 over the original making the total approximately 1024 combinations. This adds to the difficulty of the puzzle but not astronomically; only one or two additional algorithms are required to effect a solution. Note that the puzzle can be treated as a number magic square puzzle on each of the six faces with the magic constant being 15 in this case.\n\nPatterned cubes\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×3\n\nMechanically identical to the standard 3×3×3 cube. The pattern, which is often a promotional logo or pictures of performers, will usually have the effect of making the orientation of the centre pieces 'count' in the solution. The solution is therefore the same as the 'Magic Square' cube above.\n\nCommercial name: Sudoku Cube\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×3\n\nMain article: Sudoku Cube\n\nIdentical to the Rubik's Cube in mechanical function, it adds another layer of difficulty in that the numbers must all have the same orientation and there are no colours to follow. The name reflects its superficial resemblance to the two-dimensional Sudoku number puzzle.\n\nIrregular cuboids\n\nAn irregular cuboid, in the context of this article, is a cuboid puzzle where not all the pieces are the same size in edge length. This category of puzzle is often made by taking a larger regular cuboid puzzle and fusing together some of the pieces to make larger pieces. In the formulae for piece configuration, the configuration of the fused pieces is given in brackets. Thus, (as a simple regular cuboid example) a 2(2,2)x2(2,2)x2(2,2) is a 2×2×2 puzzle, but it was made by fusing a 4×4×4 puzzle. Puzzles which are constructed in this way are often called \"bandaged\" cubes. However, there are many irregular cuboids that have not (and often could not) be made by bandaging.\n\nPicture Data Comments\n\nCommercial name: Skewb\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 3x3x3\n\nSimilar to the original Rubik's Cube, the Skewb differs in that its four axes of rotation pass through the corners of the cube rather than the centres of the faces. As a result, it is a deep-cut puzzle in which each twist scrambles all six faces.\n\nBandaged Cubes\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nPiece configuration: various\n\nThe example shown in the link is a simple example of a large number of bandaged cubes that have been made.\n\nA bandaged cube is a cube where some of the pieces are stuck together.\n\nCommercial name: Square One\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nA variation on the original Rubik's Cube where it can be turned in such a manner as to distort the cubical shape of the puzzle. The Square One consists of three layers. The upper and lower layers contain kite and triangular pieces. The middle layer contains two trapezoid pieces, which together may form an irregular hexagon or a square. Square One is an example of another very large class of puzzle — cuboid puzzles which have cubies that are not themselves all cuboid.\n\nCommercial name: Tony Fisher's Golden Cube\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nFirst rotational puzzle created that has just one colour, requiring the solver to restore the puzzle to its original cube form without colour aids.\n\nCommercial name: Lan Lan Rex Cube (Flower Box)\n\nGeometric shape: Cube\n\nOther polyhedra\n\nPicture Data Comments\n\nCommercial Name: Pyraminx\n\nGeometric shape: Tetrahedron\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×3\n\nMain article: Pyraminx\n\nTetrahedral-shaped puzzle with axes on the corners and trivial tips. It was invented in 1970 by Uwe Mèffert.\n\nCommercial Name: Pyramorphix\n\nGeometric shape: Tetrahedron\n\nPiece configuration: 2×2×2\n\nMain article: Pyramorphix\n\nEdge turning tetrahedron shaped puzzle with a 2×2×2 cube mechanism.\n\nCommercial Name: Megaminx\n\nGeometric shape: Dodecahedron\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×3\n\n12-sided polyhedron puzzle similar to Rubik's Cube in operation and solution.\n\nCommercial Name: Gigaminx, Teraminx, Petaminx\n\nGeometric shape: Dodecahedron\n\nPiece configuration: gigaminx is 5x5x5, teraminx is 7x7x7, petaminx is 9x9x9\n\nMegaminx variants with multiple layers per face. The Gigaminx has 2 layers per face, for a total of 5 layers per edge; the Teraminx has 3 layers per face, 7 layers per edge; and the Petaminx has 4 layers per face, 9 layers per edge.\n\nCommercial Name: Impossiball\n\nGeometric shape: Rounded icosahedron\n\nPiece configuration: 2x2x2\n\nRounded icosahedron puzzle similar to Pocket Cube in operation and solution.\n\nCommercial Name: Alexander's Star\n\nGeometric shape: Great dodecahedron\n\nPiece configuration: 3x3x3\n\n12-sided Nonconvex uniform polyhedron puzzle similar to Rubik's Cube in operation and solution.\n\nCommercial Name: BrainTwist\n\nGeometric shape: Tetrahedron\n\nPiece configuration: 2x2x2\n\nThe BrainTwist is a unique tetrahedral puzzle with an ability to \"flip\", showing only half of the puzzle at a time.\n\nCommercial Name: Dogic\n\nGeometric shape: Icosahedron\n\nPiece configuration: 4x4x4\n\nThe Dogic is an icosahedron cut into 60 triangular pieces around its 12 tips and 20 face centers.\n\nCommercial Name: Skewb Diamond\n\nGeometric shape: Octahedron\n\nPiece configuration: 3x3x3\n\nAn octahedral variation on the Skewb, it is a deep-cut puzzle very similar to the Skewb and is a dual-polyhedron transformation.\n\nCommercial Name: Skewb Ultimate\n\nGeometric shape: Dodecahedron\n\nPiece configuration: 3x3x3\n\nWhile appearing more difficult than the Skewb Diamond, it is functionally very similar to the Skewb and Skewb Diamond. The puzzle is cut in a different manner but the same solutions can be used to solve it by identifying what pieces are equivalent. Because faces of the Skewb Diamond correspond to corners of the Skewb Ultimate, an additional constraint on the orientation of these pieces appears. Any Skewb Diamond solution thus requires a few additions in order to solve the Skewb Ultimate.\n\nCommercial Name: Barrel Cube\n\nGeometric shape: Octagonal Prism\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×3\n\nMechanically identical to the 3×3×3 cube. It does, however, have an interesting difference in its solution. The vertical corner columns are different colours to the faces and do not match the colours of the vertical face columns. The corner columns can therefore be placed in any corner. On the face of it, this makes the solution easier, however odd combinations of corner columns cannot be achieved by legal moves. The solver may unwittingly attempt an odd combination solution, but will not be aware of this until the last few pieces.\n\nCommercial Name: Diamond Cube\n\nGeometric shape: Rhombicuboctahedron\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×3\n\nMechanically identical to the 3×3×3 cube although the example pictured is easier to solve due to the restricted colour scheme. This puzzle is a rhombicuboctahedron but not a uniform one as the edge pieces are oblong rather than square. There is in existence a similar puzzle actually called Rhombicuboctahedron which is uniform.\n\nCommercial Name: Pyraminx Crystal\n\nGeometric shape: Dodecahedron\n\nPiece configuration: 3x3x3\n\nA dodecahedron cut into 20 corner pieces and 30 edge pieces. It is similar to the Megaminx, but is deeper cut, giving edges that behave differently from the Megaminx's edges when twisted.\n\nCommercial Name: Magic 120-cell\n\nGeometric shape: 120-cell\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×3×3\n\nVirtual 4-dimensional puzzle, the 4-D analogue of the Megaminx.\n\nOther geometric shapes\n\nPicture Data Comments\n\nCommercial Name: Magic Ball\n\nGeometric shape: Sphere\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×3\n\nAlso known as Rubik's Sphere. Mechanically identical to the 3×3×3 cube in operation and solution. The only practical difference is that it is rather hard to grip. This accounts for the poor condition of this specimen, as the coloured stickers tend to get forced off in use.\n\nNon-Rubik style three-dimensional\n\nPicture Data Comments\n\nCommercial Name: Minus Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 2×2×2-1 sliding cubes\n\nThe Minus Cube is a 3D mechanical variant of the n-puzzle. It consists of a bonded transparent plastic box containing seven small cubes. There is an empty space the size of one small cube inside the box and the small cubes are moveable inside the box by tilting the box causing a cube to fall into the space.\n\nCommercial Name: Rubik's Clock\n\nPiece configuration: 3×3×2 12-position dials\n\nRubik's Clock is a two-sided puzzle, each side presenting nine clocks to the puzzler. There are four wheels, one at each corner of the puzzle, each allowing the corresponding corner clock to be rotated directly. There are also four pins next to the center clock, which control the rotation of the four adjacent clock faces.\n\nCommercial Name: Rubik's Snake\n\nPiece configuration: 1x1x24\n\nSome would not count this as a combinational puzzle though it bears the Rubik name. Also known as Rubik's Twist. There is no one solution to this puzzle but multiple different shapes can be made.\n\nCommercial Name: Snake Cube\n\nPiece configuration: 1x1x27 or 1x1x64\n\nThe cubelets are connected by an elastic band running through them. They can rotate freely. The aim of the puzzle is to arrange the chain in such a way that they will form 3 x 3 x 3 or 4 x 4 x 4 cube.\n\nTwo-dimensional\n\nPicture Data Comments\n\nSliding piece puzzle\n\nPiece configuration: 7×7\n\nThese ubiquitous puzzles come in many sizes and designs.
