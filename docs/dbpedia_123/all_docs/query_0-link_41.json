        "text": "So You Want To Solve A Rubik’s Cube…\n\nYou’re in luck! Somehow you’ve stumbled upon the easiest method to solve a cube. Before we begin, you should make sure you’re in the right place.\n\nThis method will NOT make you a speed-solver. (Fastest time with my method is probably about 2 minutes… which is considered really slow in the cubing world)\n\nThis method will NOT be using complex algorithms.\n\nThis method will NOT make you look cool. (Okay, it actually might)\n\nPREFER VIDEOS? CLICK HERE.\n\nJust tell me how to solve already!!!\n\nSo last year, my eight-year-old son handed me a cube and told me to solve it. Of course, I had no clue. Rubik’s cubes are impossible. I went to Youtube and looked at a lot of tutorials. The people on the videos went on and on about just how awesome they were, whipped through a solve, and I still didn’t know what they were doing. I kept shouting, “Just tell me how to solve already!!!”\n\nFinally, I found some videos that were a little slower but… they were still full of complex algorithms.\n\nFun Fact: Cubers will always say that they use “complex algorithms” to solve a Rubik’s cube. (Makes them sound smart).\n\nAdvice: After you start showing off your skills using my easy method, people will ask you how you do it. Just tell them you use “complex algorithms.” (They’ll have no clue how easy it is… unless you tell them.)\n\nSo… I went through the process… kept pausing the video, trying to figure out what was really going on. Finally, I understood what they were trying to say. Once this happened, I wondered why they didn’t explain it simpler. They were making me memorize algorithms that weren’t necessary and steps that I didn’t need. I just wanted to solve it! So… I came up with my own modifications, taught them to my 8 year-old, and he learned quick!\n\nTell me like I’m an 8-year-old\n\nMy steps go very-very slow. I am going to teach as if you are an 8-year-old. It is slow, but you’ll get the cube solved without having to memorize unnecessary junk. You may have to memorize something… but its the minimum–No fancy frills–just solving. My son is 8. This is how he learned. It’s easy. If he can learn this, you can too.\n\nPREFER VIDEOS? CLICK HERE.\n\nThe Basics\n\nKnow What Side You Are On\n\nLook at your cube. Pick a side and then look in the dead center. What color is the middle piece? If the middle piece is red then you are looking at the “red side.” If the center piece was white, you would be on the “white side”. Easy.\n\nEvery Side Has A Permanent Opposite Side\n\nFind the red side (that would be the side that has red in the center.) Then look at the opposite side of the cube. What color is in the middle piece on that side? If you said, “orange” you are correct! After a few minutes of looking at different sides, you might notice that you can guess what color is on the other side without even looking. (but you can look if you want.)\n\nThe Red side is opposite of the Orange side.\n\n(Hot Colors are opposites, that’s awesome!)\n\nThe Blue side is opposite of the Green side.\n\n(Cold Colors are opposites, that’s great!)\n\nThe White side is opposite of the Yellow side.\n\n(Daisy Colors are opposites… that’s… girly)\n\nMiddle pieces don’t move! And That’s a good thing!\n\nBelieve it or not, the middle pieces don’t move. Go ahead, mix it all up. It won’t matter. Blue will still be opposite of green, red will be the opposite of orange, and white will be the opposite of yellow. This makes things a lot easier. If you are looking at the blue side, you can know what the other side is without even looking. There is a 100% chance that the opposite side of the cube is green. Can you solve without knowing this color rule? Yes. But, I think you’ll still find it helpful.\n\nGet A Cube!\n\nSome have wondered what cube I use. Happy to help. I’m use the Classic Rubik’s Cube https://amzn.to/3xiB64y …If that is too old-school, here is the AP-enabled cube, which is pretty cool looking. https://amzn.to/3GYXy7d\n\nSolve the Cube in Eight Simple Steps\n\nI am going to break this down into eight steps. Don’t Rush! Remember, this isn’t for speed, but ease. If you follow the steps, you WILL solve a Rubik’s cube. (Then you can scratch it off your bucket list and move on to skydiving.)\n\nStep 1) The Daisy\n\nStep 2) The White Plus\n\nStep 3) Find the Lost Dogs\n\nStep 4) ABC’s!!!\n\nStep 5) The Furry Yellow Plus\n\nStep 6) The Yellow Fish\n\nStep 7) Thumbs Up For Final Corners\n\nStep 8) Final Move!
