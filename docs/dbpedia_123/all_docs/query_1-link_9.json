        "text": "The Rubik cube is a 3D puzzle with six faces and each side with a different color. Originally, each of the six faces had nine stickers and the colors that are commonly used are yellow, white, blue, red, orange, and green.\n\nWith time, companies that develop Rubik cubes —like Qiyi or LanLan Toys— decided to manufacture each piece in one of the colors instead of adding stickers. This way they avoid having cubes with faded colors or peeling stickers.\n\nOn the first cubes, the position of the colors was not the same for every cube. However, in 1988, the creators designed one model that would standardize all the cubes.\n\nThe model was that white is opposite yellow, blue is opposite green, and orange is opposite red, and the red, white, and blue are arranged in that order in a clockwise arrangement.\n\nAs we all probably know, for this puzzle to be solved, each face must end up having only one color. Similar puzzles have now been produced with various numbers of sides, dimensions, and stickers, not all of them by Rubik.\n\nContinue reading and find out how many types of cubes there are, how to solve each one, what are the main differences between each model, and much more.\n\nKeep in mind that even though the cube is categorized as a toy, it is still a complex puzzle. If you've been trying to solve the cube for a while now and you haven't done it yet then you could always find someone to help you solve it.\n\nFor instance, there are plenty of Rubik's cube tutors right here on Superprof. You can have quick lessons a few times per week and learn more than one method to solve the puzzle.\n\nThe best Rubik's Cube tutors available\n\n5 (106 reviews)\n\nJoseph\n\n$40\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (15 reviews)\n\nLaura\n\n$32\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (30 reviews)\n\nSanjith\n\n$25\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (33 reviews)\n\nMadhulika\n\n$16\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (8 reviews)\n\nJosiah\n\n$15\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (5 reviews)\n\nPallavi\n\n$12\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (4 reviews)\n\nAbdullah\n\n$30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (2 reviews)\n\nLucien\n\n$10\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (106 reviews)\n\nJoseph\n\n$40\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (15 reviews)\n\nLaura\n\n$32\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (30 reviews)\n\nSanjith\n\n$25\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (33 reviews)\n\nMadhulika\n\n$16\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (8 reviews)\n\nJosiah\n\n$15\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (5 reviews)\n\nPallavi\n\n$12\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (4 reviews)\n\nAbdullah\n\n$30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (2 reviews)\n\nLucien\n\n$10\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\nLet's go\n\nHow many types of Rubik's cubes are there?\n\nThe Rubik cube is originally a puzzle that has six faces and each face has one color. However, over the years, many manufacturers —like Qiyi— have developed and created more than one design.\n\nIf you Google \"types of Rubik's cubes\" you'll get a plethora of answers. However, some have grown in popularity given their interesting mechanism, their creative structure, size and method variety, and several other reasons.\n\nLearning how to solve any of these variations of the Rubik cube by doing a simple Google search won't be very helpful. Google will give you basic information but solving these puzzles will take structure, knowledge, and patience.\n\nIf you want to go viral by solving a Rubik's cube in seconds, then you'll need serious training. You could work with a tutor from Superprof and learn everything you need to know to find the solution to the puzzles.\n\nBelow are a few of the cubes that exist in the market.\n\nMirror Cube\n\nThe mirror cube is probably one that has grown in popularity for its inventive design. Almost all the cubes in the mirror cube have different sizes and shapes and the cube is typically the same color — either with reflective gold or silver stickers.\n\nThe mirror cube was invented in 2006 and it is a type of twisty puzzle and shape modification of the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube. The puzzle's internal mechanism is nearly identical to that of the Rubik's Cube, although it differs from normal 3x3\n\nMegaminx\n\nThe megaminx cube has a total of 50 movable pieces (the Rubik cube has 20) and it has a dodecahedron shape. The megaminx used to also be called the magic dodecahedron due to its design.\n\nThis variation of the Rubik cube was created by a number of designers and it has many variations. For instance, some puzzles are designed to be solved only by arranging the corners.\n\nPyraminx\n\nThe pyraminx is another variation and it is a regular tetrahedron puzzle. It was introduced by Tomy Toys of Japan (then the 3rd largest toy company in the world) in 1981.\n\nThe pyraminx is divided into 4 axial pieces, 6 edge pieces, and 4 trivial tips. It has trivial tips or corners and they are called like that because they can be twisted independently of all other pieces, making them trivial to place in a solved position.\n\nPocket Cube\n\nThe pocket cube or 2x2x2 cube was also invented by Erno Rubik and it is considered the \"easy\" version of the Rubik cube.\n\nTo solve the Pocket cube you need to understand the regular 3x3 cube because it is pretty much the same but it doesn't have the edges and the centerpieces. So basically solving the 2x2 cube will be identical to solving only the corners of the 3x3.\n\nSolving the types of Rubik's cubes\n\nMany people collect all the different types of cubes and learn how to solve them as a way of challenging themselves or just to have fun. If you want to learn the solution to each cube then you'll need some help.\n\nYou could hire a private tutor and get the help you need to learn the solution to each design, set a new record for yourself, and even train enough that you set a record on the fastest time a cube is solved.\n\nA tutor will help you figure out a method, they'll take the time to show you a number of great strategies, they'll show you the original architecture and all its variations, and much more.\n\nTo become a talented Rubik's cube solver, you'll need to dedicate some time to learn how to solve each twisty shape invented. And we can't promise you'll be successful if you're doing all your training based on some Google searches.\n\nIf you go on Superprof you'll find a bunch of tutors ready to teach you more than just solving in a few seconds the three times three cube. If you want to be quick, sharp, and become the best, you should train with something other than an online video!\n\nKeep in mind that a tutor can teach you great shortcuts, the different application of each cube, and put you on the top.\n\nWhat makes each type unique?\n\nYou would think that there is one clear difference between each variation of the Rubik cube, however, there are plenty of differences between designs.\n\nFor instance, each design will have its mechanism and application. Some designs will have one layer of movements, others will have more than one layer.\n\nThe three times three cube is a little bigger in size than the two times two, however, they are both solved equally. If you figure out how to solve one then you'll be able to solve the other one.\n\nThe key to solving these puzzles in seconds is understanding the variations in their solutions. If you want to learn more you should also learn about all the benefits of learning the Rubik's cube.\n\nHowever, if you want to get to the top, we recommend you go right ahead and hire a private tutor on Superprof to help you improve your skills and knowledge.\n\nA brief history of the Rubik cube\n\nAs we already mentioned, the Rubik cube is a 3D puzzle and its original frame was invented by a Hungarian sculptor and architecture teacher called Erno Rubik in 1974. Its original name is the Magic Cube.\n\nIn 1980 the Rubik cube won the German Game of the Year for Best Puzzle. The toy gained popularity quite quickly after that and many different companies and designers started creating variations based on the original structure. It was also quick on spreading around the world.\n\nAs of January 2009, 350 million cubes had been sold worldwide, making it the world's bestselling puzzle game and bestselling toy.\n\nIt is rumored that Rubik had designed the cube to teach his students about 3D objects. The actual purpose was to solve the structural problem of moving the parts independently without the entire mechanism falling apart.\n\nIt was reported that he did not realize that he had created a puzzle until the first time he scrambled his new Cube and then tried to restore it."
