        "text": "It is recommended that you first learn to solve the 3x3x3 cube. The resources available for learning the 3x3 are much greater than any other, and the skill and knowledge you gain become the basis for many other puzzles.\n\nFlowchart on which cube you should buy\n\nThis chart is probably most interesting when you already have most of the ones we recommend below.\n\nWhich cube should you buy? - by /u/dobeye\n\nMost recommended puzzles\n\nThose marked in italics are WCA competition category puzzles. If you are interested in speedsolving, check the list of recommended speedcube brands and models.\n\nFirst, an upgrade\n\n3x3 - If you have just learned to solve a 3x3x3, odds are good that you used a Rubik's brand cube. Time to upgrade to a better, faster and smoother turning cube. See this page for recommendations.\n\n2x2 - Get a 2x2 while you are at it. Once you know 3x3, you can solve the 2x2. A good lesson in applying what you know to a new puzzle. See this page for recommendations.\n\nNext, start climbing the ladder of higher order cubes\n\n4x4 - You will need to learn a few new techniques to solve a 4x4. This is also a versatile cube since you can partially scramble and solve it as a 2x2 or as a 3x3.\n\n5x5 - Use what you learned with the 4x4 and apply a few new techniques to solve this. Once you can solve them both you can now solve any higher order cube.\n\nTry something new\n\nPyraminx - Now for something different. But don't worry, it's common for people to develop or discover a solution on their own intuitively with this one.\n\nSkewb - Same for this one.\n\nMirror Cube - This solves just like a 3x3, except by shape instead of color. It is a very impressive looking puzzle. It will really help you polish those 3x3 algorithms.\n\nMastermorphix - A 3x3 shaped into a 4 color pyramid. This adds some new complexity. Also time to learn center orientation.\n\nNow some serious looking cubes\n\nMegaminx - A baseball sized dodecahedron. 12 colors, 50 moving pieces, and a lot of fun. It has some similar properties to a 3x3 cube.\n\nAxis Cube - It solves like a 3x3 but when scrambled it looks like a Picasso painting of a Rubik's cube.\n\nGear Cube Extreme - A fascinating puzzle to play with, but not too complicated to solve. The extreme version adds a bit more challenge.\n\n6x6 and 7x7 - As big as it gets for speedcubing. This size is the sweet spot for solve duration and puzzle cost.\n\nAnd for greater challenge\n\nSquare-1 - Everything you know is now no help. You are back to square one (ha. get it?)\n\nCurvy Copter - A very fun puzzle to solve. Very frequently recommended.\n\nRex Cube - Much like the Curvy Copter, it is fun and challenging.\n\nGhost Cube - This was once only available as a pricey custom made puzzle, but recently was mass produced. It is a 3x3, but no two pieces are the same. Very challenging.\n\nCuboids - This encompasses an entire class of puzzle cubes with unique challenging properties. Very satisfying to solve. /u/quuador has a great write-up on cuboids here.\n\nA more in depth look at popular twisty puzzles\n\nOnce you have been hooked on twisty puzzles you will soon start looking for new challenges and to expand your collection. They come in all kinds of sizes, shapes, and design with many variations and hybrids. This is meant to be an extensive, but not exhaustive list of mass-produced and popular twisty puzzles available.\n\nThose marked with \"*\" are frequently recommended by /r/cubers.\n\n3x3 Variants\n\nThese puzzles are solved using the same methods you already know, but sometimes need a few new algorithms for orientation of the center pieces.\n\nAxised cubes - The core of the cube is rotated or realigned in relation to the outer shape of the cube, altering the shape of the cubies.\n\nFisher cube\n\nWindmill cube\n\nMirror cube* (a.k.a. Bump cube) - Solved based on shape instead of color.\n\nAxis cube*\n\nGhost cube*\n\nShape mods - The outer shape of the 3x3 is no longer a cube.\n\nMastermorhpix*\n\nVarious others shapes including Star, Heart, Egg, Apple\n\nSuper cubes / Sticker mods - The pattern or design on the stickers creates a greater challenge.\n\nPochmann cube\n\nCalendar cube\n\nLSD cube\n\nSudokube\n\nMaze Cube\n\nShepherds Cube\n\nHigher order cubes\n\nHigher order cubes is another way of saying those with more layers. Even layers (4x4, 6x6, 8x8..) introduce a new challenge called parity. Once you can solve a 4x4 and 5x5, you can then solve any of the higher order cubes.\n\n4x4*\n\n5x5*\n\n6x6\n\n7x7*\n\n8x8\n\n9x9\n\n10x10\n\n11X11\n\n13x13\n\nA new twist\n\nThe standard 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, etc.. are face turning puzzles. By changing axis to the vertex (corner) or edge, the puzzle gets different properties and solutions.\n\nVertex Turning - These tend to be simpler than face turning puzzles.\n\nDino Cube\n\nSkewb*\n\nRex Cube*\n\nMaster Skewb\n\nEdge Turning - These add the additional unique element of \"jumbling\", letting pieces swap place into different orbits.\n\nHelicopter Cube\n\nCurvy Copter*\n\nQiyi Clover Cube\n\nSquare-1 & Dihedral\n\nSquare-1*\n\nSuper Square-1\n\nSquare-2\n\nRubik's UFO\n\nCheese wheel\n\nA different shape\n\nIn addition to 6 sided hexahedra, puzzles can take different form via the aforementioned shapemods (changing the outer shell shape), or by changing the core, its number of axes and faces.\n\nDodecahedra 12 sided polyhedra.\n\nMegaminx* - Face turning with similarities to the 3x3. Also the rest of the minx's line: Kilominx (\"FlowerMinx\"), Master Kilominx, Gigaminx, Teraminx, Petaminx\n\nStarminx\n\nDino Dodecahedron - Vertex turning\n\nHelicopter Dodecahedron - Edge turning\n\nBauhinia - Vertex Turning. Like a Rex Cube\n\nTetrahedra 4 sided polyhedra\n\nPyraminx* - Vertex turning pyramid with a history as long as the Rubik's Cube.\n\nJing's Pyraminx\n\nHoberman Braintwist - unique mechanism that lets the faces invert.\n\nOctahedra 8 sided polyhedra\n\nFace Turning Octahedron\n\nTrajber's Octahedron\n\nMaster Trajber's Octahedron\n\nSpheres\n\nMasterball\n\nMarusenko Sphere\n\nTwistball\n\nDreamball\n\nDioctipoid\n\nVarious other polyhedra\n\nTuttminx - 32 sides\n\nDayan Pentahedron series\n\nDayan Gem Series\n\nOther Transmuters\n\nVarious modifiers applied to create new puzzles\n\nDeletion modifiers Omitting or removing an element\n\nVoid cube - The center cubies and core are removed\n\nEdge only cube - centers and corners are removed.\n\nCrazy or Super Cubes Cubes with circle faces that may turn or stay independent from the rest of the face.\n\nmf8 Crazy 3x3 planet series\n\nDaYan Crazy 4x4 series\n\nCrazy 3x3x2\n\nBandaging Binding cubies together to restrict movement. Often regarded as some of the most difficult puzzles, due to their non-formulaic solutions.\n\nCubeTwist Bandaged 3x3x3 DIY Kit\n\n4x4 bandage mods (i.e. Wall cube, AI cube)\n\nBermuda Cube/Bermudaminx series (different difficulties between the different \"planets\" inseries)\n\nMini, Pocket, and full-size Geraniums (planar twisty puzzles. Often regarded as the most difficult)\n\nVarious jumbling puzzles\n\nConjoined Cubes A form of bandaging where 2 or more cubes are fused together to share elements.\n\nVarious arrangements typically found on 2x2 and 3x3 cubes\n\nRestrained movement Turning direction or rotation is limited or blocked. These often share similar traits with bandaging cubes. Also generally very difficult.\n\nLatch cube\n\nLatch cube 2 (quarter cube)\n\nVarious shapemods with blocking parts (i.e. Evil twin puzzles, pocket cube)\n\nConstrained cube series\n\nGear Cubes Puzzles with interlocking gears\n\nGear Cube\n\nGear Cube Extreme\n\nGear Ball\n\nGear Shift\n\nGear Dodecahedron\n\nCuboids\n\nDomino Cuboids\n\n3x3x2*\n\n3x3x4\n\nShapeshifting Cuboids\n\n2x2x4\n\n3x3x5*\n\n4x4x6\n\nBrick Cuboids\n\n2x3x4\n\n3x4x6\n\nUltimate Shapeshifting Cuboids\n\n2x4x6"
