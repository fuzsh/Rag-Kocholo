        "text": "Hello everyone, I learnt to solve rubik's cube(3X3) by myself when I was around 10 years old(now 16). It took about 7 months. We did not have internet in home so when I had to study, which I hated a lot, I would play(right word would be mess up) with rubik's cube. I picked up some steps which would help me and discard most of them. At first, the step to be followed would be vague but slowly I knew what to do. So this way I solved one, two, three and finally six sides. When I solved six sides, I was only practicing solving the three sides faster and was shocked. I did not even touched rubik's cube for two weeks or more than that and wanted to put it in museum. After two weeks, I again started playing with it. Looking back, it is very funny.\n\nSo back to the topic,\n\nWhen I told my friends about it some time before, they did not believe me saying it was impossible. So I wanted to know how common it is for people to solve it by themselves."
