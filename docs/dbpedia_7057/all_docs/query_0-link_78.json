        "text": "Michele G. Wheatly is Professor of Biology at Syracuse University. She currently serves on the Air University Board of Visitors (2022-2025, following appointment by the Secretary of Defense) as well as the External Advisory Committee of the ADVANCE Resource and Coordination Network and an eBoard of the Association for Women in Science.\n\nShe has served as Chief Academic Officer and Provost at two successive Research 1 universities, most recently at Syracuse University (2016-2020) and prior to that at West Virginia University (2009-2014). At both institutions she advanced academic rankings, led comprehensive academic strategic planning, led successful accreditation exercises, and grew faculty ranks through establishing research clusters.\n\nPrior to WVU, Dr. Wheatly was dean of science and math (2002-09) and chair of biology (1994-2002) at Wright State University. Dr. Wheatly ascended the academic ranks at the University of Florida (1984-1994) after completing postdoctoral training at the University of Calgary, Canada, (1980-1984). She earned both a Ph.D. (1980) and B.Sc. (1977) at Birmingham University in the United Kingdom. Born and raised in London, she became a naturalized US citizen in 2003.\n\nAn internationally recognized scholar/educator (and presidential medalist in 1988), Professor Wheatly has been continuously funded by NSF ($29.5 million over 30 years) and has contributed to her academic field of comparative physiology (112 papers, 192 abstracts, 29 colloquia, 22 research students). Her scholarship interests include the comparative physiology of crustaceans, the logic of epithelial Ca transport, biologically inspired adaptive interfaces, bio complexity, access to STEM careers for members of underrepresented groups and women in higher education leadership. She has traveled widely in pursuit of her research agenda, including studying as a Fulbright Scholar in the Middle East, and serving as an EPCOR delegate to Ireland.\n\nDr. Wheatly is recognized as a national thought leader on building partnerships around education, economic development, and healthcare (keynoted at the UEDA and CICEP). She is known nationally for her passion and advocacy for inclusive excellence, promoting access for and the success of women, people of color, and people with disabilities in the knowledge economy. Her work on universal access to STEM has received Congressional recognition (2004) and has been supported through multiple grants from the National Science Foundation. Dr. Wheatly’s signature legacy programs have included establishment of a Women in Science Giving Circle at Wright State University, the Women’s Leadership Initiative at West Virginia University and leading a successful online pivot of the Women in Leadership initiative at Syracuse University (2020-2021)."
