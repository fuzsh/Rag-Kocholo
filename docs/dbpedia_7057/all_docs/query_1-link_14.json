        "text": "Welcome to \"The Unexpected\".\n\nWelcome to Ohio Northern University, where we pursue the undiscovered. Where no one knows you until, suddenly, everyone does. Welcome to the everyday magic of ONU.\n\nJoining the community at Northern means choosing a special blend of phenomenal academics and a 150-year tradition of family. Here, involvement and camaraderie come with the small-town territory. And that territory--from the Tundra to the Green Monster--is truly what we make of it.\n\nONU has a rich history of academic excellence, and we're always evolving to meet society's ever-changing needs. We've most recently been recognized for teaching quality, high graduation rates, commitment to volunteer service and providing a high return on investment for our graduates.\n\nDistinguished by nationally ranked academics and a 96 percent job placement, we are committed to high-impact learning and offer nearly 60 programs in our five colleges: Arts & Sciences, Business, Engineering, Pharmacy, and Law."
