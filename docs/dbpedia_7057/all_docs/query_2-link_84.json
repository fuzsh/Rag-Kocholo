        "text": "OHIO â This week, Mike Duffey, chancellor of the Ohio Department of Higher Education, announced two additions to the list of Collegiate Purple Star campuses: John Carroll University and Ohio Northern University.\n\nThe universities were chosen âfor their efforts to support students with military backgrounds,â according to a Department of Higher Education news release. The total number of schools in this list is now 53.\n\nâMemorial Day is an appropriate time to recognize that military-connected students have different needs in higher education,â Duffey said in the release. âThat is why we are grateful John Carroll and Ohio Northern universities are putting forth the effort for these students. This is the example set by all 53 of Ohioâs Collegiate Purple Star campuses.â\n\nOhio started this collegiate designation in 2022, and itâs similar to a designation offered to preK-12 schools in Ohio by the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce. The release notes Ohio was the first state to offer this designation for colleges.\n\nâCongratulations to these universities on becoming the latest to earn the Collegiate Purple Star,â Gov. Mike DeWine said in the release. âBy providing essential resources to ensure military-connected students can pursue their educational goals with confidence, these institutions exemplify Ohioâs unwavering commitment to supporting our service members.â\n\nInstitutions of higher learning can apply for the designation, which is approved by an advisory committee that consists of members from the following organizations:\n\nOhio Department of Higher Education\n\nOhio Veterans Education Council\n\nOhio Department of Veterans Services\n\nOhio Adjutant Generalâs Department\n\nMilitary Interstate Childrenâs Compact Commission K-12 Purple Star Committee\n\nThereâs various criteria schools must meet in order to be chosen for this designation. That includes:\n\nâHaving a dedicated military/veteran point of contact and/or office on campus\n\nestablishing priority registration for veterans and servicemembers\n\nsurveying student veterans and servicemembers â along with spouses and dependents â about needs and challenges\n\nallowing for the establishment of student-led groups and organizations for veterans and servicemembers\"\n\nThe release also notes they will be accepting applications for a sixth round later this year."
