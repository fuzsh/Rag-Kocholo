Chemistry, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY\n\nAbout Nancy\n\nDr. Savage was named provost and senior vice president for academic affairs in May 2024. She was appointed following a national search in which more than 1,200 potential candidates were engaged during an extensive search process. Dr. Savage was appointed after excelling in an interim capacity for nearly two years, distinguishing herself as a collaborative and data-driven leader.\n\nDuring her interim appointment, Dr. Savage launched the University Interdisciplinary Collaborative to support the development and oversight of cutting-edge and market-responsive cross-college academic programs; implemented policies and processes that support student success; and created the Core Curriculum Innovation Committee. She also launched a new periodic program review process and partnered with the Division of Student Affairs to help enhance the Academic Integrity Policy.\n\nIn addition, she has led the executive committee for the University’s strategic plan implementation, developed an inclusion advocate program for faculty searches, and overseen the selection of several important positions in academic affairs, including the University Librarian, Assistant Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity Initiatives, Director for the Center for Teaching Excellence, and Makerspace Coordinator.\n\nDr. Savage served as deputy provost for six months prior to being appointed interim provost. She previously was associate dean of the Tagliatela College of Engineering, chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical & Biomedical Engineering, and coordinator of the University’s chemistry program. She joined the University as an assistant professor in 2005, earning tenure and promotion to associate professor in 2011, and promotion to rank of professor in 2017.\n\nShe was awarded a National Research Council postdoctoral fellowship that supported her work studying gas sensors at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. She earned her Ph.D. in chemistry from The Ohio State University and her B.S. in chemistry from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\n\nEarlier in her career, Dr. Savage taught at the University of Hartford, the University of Connecticut, the University of Saint Joseph, and Quinnipiac.\n\nProfessor Appointments\n\nProfessor, University of New Haven, Fall 2017 - Present\n\nAssociate Professor, University of New Haven, Fall 2011 - Spring 2017\n\nAssistant Professor, University of New Haven, Fall 2005 - Spring 2011\n\nPublished Books and Articles\n\nAbigail Freyer*, Nancy Ortins Savage‡, Electrospun Silica Nanofiber Mats:Effects of Sol Viscosity and Application to Thin Layer Chromatography.
