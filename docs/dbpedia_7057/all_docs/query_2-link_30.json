        "text": "Private university in Ada, Ohio, U.S.\n\nOhio Northern University (Ohio Northern or ONU) is a private college in Ada, Ohio. Founded by Henry Solomon Lehr in 1871, ONU is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It offers over 60 programs across five colleges and is affiliated with the United Methodist Church.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly years\n\n[edit]\n\nHenry Solomon Lehr founded the Northwestern Ohio Normal School in August 1871. When the college's curriculum grew to include pharmacy, engineering, law and business programs, its name was changed to Ohio Normal University in 1885 and, eventually, in 1903, to Ohio Northern University. In 1899, it became affiliated with the United Methodist Church to reduce debt.[4]\n\nInterwar and post-war education\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore the Great Depression, more than one thousand students were typically enrolled at Ohio Northern every year. Both the Great Depression and the following World War II plunged the school into low enrollment, and the possibility of closure was considered. During World War II, enrollment reached a low of 156 students. Thanks to the G.I. Bill, Ohio Northern was able to bring enrollment back up to nine hundred students by 1946.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, a number of ONU students and faculty/staff participated in the American Civil Rights Movement. ONU hosted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on January 11, 1968, four days before his 39th birthday and just three months before his assassination.[5] During his visit at ONU, King famously spoke regarding the myth that many immigrant and/or ethnic groups successfully pulled themselves up by their bootstraps, whereas African Americans were incapable of doing so.[6][7] ONU honored King and his speech on campus with the unveiling of a statue in his likeness on April 17, 2018.[8][9]\n\nLater 20th century into today\n\n[edit]\n\nGrowth continued under DeBow Freed through the 1980s and 1990s with additions to the Taggart Law Library, Presser Hall, Dukes Memorial, Wilson Art Building, Biggs Engineering, Heterick Memorial Library, and Meyer Hall of Science, and the construction of the Freed Center for the Performing Arts and a new president's on-campus home. Under Kendall Baker, campus additions include Dicke Hall, an expansion of the Robertson-Evans Pharmacy building, the Dial-Roberson Stadium and the Mathile Center for the Natural Sciences. In 2008, Ohio Northern University built and opened The Inn at Ohio Northern University.[10] A new engineering building was opened in October 2019.[11]\n\n2024 Closure of Hill Memorial\n\n[edit]\n\nHill Memorial Building is a historic building on campus. The building was finished in 1879[12][13] and is the second structure built on the grounds. Initially, Hill held administrative offices and classrooms, though many University departments would enter and leave the building throughout its history. The building is currently the oldest on campus and one of the oldest standing structures in Ada.\n\nIn July 2024, the administration of Ohio Northern announced the closure of Hill Building[14]. Citing age and a need of expansive repairs, the building was closed to the students and faculty. Classes and offices were temporarily relocated to the neighboring Dukes Hall while the administration worked to create a plan on how to progress at the site. University Alumni created a Change.org petition to try and save the building amassing more than six-hundred signatures[15]. As of 2024, there is no definitive public plan for the future of the building.\n\nLeadership\n\n[edit]\n\nMelissa J.
