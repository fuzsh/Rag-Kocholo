        "text": "The sports center at Ohio Northern University (ONU) needed a serious makeover. The current gymnasium hosts various collegiate events and basketball games for the team. However, the condition of their bleachers was in disarray. With concerns about safety and longevity, ONU began to look for solutions to revitalize its sports space. Farnham Equipment Company (FEC) met with the University and provided multiple solutions to deliver new, updated seating for their gymnasium to provide a fantastic fan experience for spectators. FEC eventually received a contract to remove the existing seating and provide new telescopic seating from Hussey Seating Company (HSC).\n\nAfter the removal of the existing seating, FEC installed a new 26-tier bank of Maxam+ bleachers on the north side of the gymnasium designed to hold over 1,000 spectators. This was designed to be the main spectator seating for the home team and was specified to have some customized options to enhance the spectator experience. The Courtside seats were selected in a combination of Black and Orange colors. In the middle of this seating bank, FEC provided Hussey’s Metro seats as VIP seating for the best view of games. Auto-rotating aisle rails were installed to provide the maintenance team with less work to set up the bleachers for use. As a school branding option, Hussey provided an Xtreme logo of the ONU Polar Bear to add yet another custom feature to this seating system.\n\nONU opted for a unique set-up for the visitors on the opposite side of the court. A 7-tier portable Maxam bleacher bank was installed that added 237 additional seats and can be flexibly moved as needed around the gym for spectators. Behind the visitor side portable bleachers, FEC installed a large custom ceiling suspended divider curtain from Performance Sports Systems (PSS) with the phrase “Ohio Northern University” in the middle and the school’s Polar Bear logo at each end. This created a large backdrop for the visitor seating and provided a real stadium feel to the new space.\n\nONU was thrilled with the final product. From the custom school logos, to the portable bleachers and divider curtain adding a unique seating experience, the finished product was everything they’d hoped for and more. After completing the installation, FEC received a personal note from the ONU athletic director, Tom Simmons, which reads:\n\n“Sending sincere thanks for the installation of our new bleachers. The crew you sent was outstanding. I enjoyed them and they work so hard, knowing that we were eager to get our facility on line…..Thanks again. I would gladly recommend Farnham Equipment Company to anyone.”\n\nThe full project gallery for Ohio Northern’s new gymnasium is visible below."
