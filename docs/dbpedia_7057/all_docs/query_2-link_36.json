        "text": "With top-ranked programs and opportunities outside the classroom, any path you choose at ONU will be grounded in concrete applications for the future.\n\nBut the best part is that you never really have to choose. Our campus is an open frontier where engineers can be artists and artists can be entrepreneurs. At ONU, we embrace the overlap in every field.\n\nAt Ohio Northern University, we have a 97% job and graduate school placement rate. Our long-standing success is partly because we have excellent professors, partly because we have ambitious students, and partly because we’ve always been rooted in the future. Here, you can get moving toward a career long before you graduate—and our alumni successes prove it.\n\nThe Getty College of Arts and Sciences\n\nThe Getty College of Arts and Sciences offers more than 50 academic programs that provide excellent preparation for careers, advanced training, or top graduate schools. In addition to superior programs in the arts and humanities, the College’s outstanding science programs attract more than 60% of the student body. All of the arts and sciences offer valuable opportunities for research and internships. Student achievement in the sciences has been recognized with a Fulbright award and 13 Goldwater Scholarships over the past 11 years.\n\nThe James F. Dicke College of Business Administration\n\nThe James F. Dicke College of Business Administration creates tomorrow’s leaders who are ethical, entrepreneurial, and engaged. The College is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International).

The College offers several majors, plus minors in Business Administration, Entrepreneurship, Finance, and International Business. Accounting majors can add a fifth year and earn a Master of Science in Accounting.\n\nThe T.J. Smull College of Engineering\n\nThe T.J. Smull College of Engineering offers Engineering and Computer Science students the unique combination of a scientific and technically based major within the context of a liberal arts education. An optional five-year co-op program provides hands-on experience in research, development, or manufacturing; these experiences are integrated with classroom study, and participants earn a salary. Students participate in national competitions such as Baja SAE®, Micro Mouse, ASCE Concrete Canoe, and Robotic Football.\n\nThe Raabe College of Pharmacy\n\nThe Raabe College of Pharmacy has long been recognized as one of the premier colleges of pharmacy in the nation, producing graduates who have successful pharmacy practices and are active in local, state, and national health-related organizations. Students take professional pharmacy courses from day one in the 0–6 direct-admit program leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy.\n\nStudent life and leadership opportunities\n\nWith more than 200 clubs and organizations, students can easily make new friends and lasting memories while pursuing opportunities for leadership roles in the many activities available on campus.
