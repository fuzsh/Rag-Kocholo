        "text": "<p>Hey Weenie,\n\nI have no idea how I find your posts but it seems that I do. My D went to a camp here. It’s very small and very remote. It is in a small town in Ohio, the nearest bigger town is Lima and Lima is not a very desirable town.</p>\n\n<p>My D went to a girls engineering camp, she had a great time. The dorms are pretty nice, adv. dorms. The campus is not as pretty as Denison but it’s not bad. My neighbor who is an engineering professor likes the school, thinks very nice things about the facility. He thought that it was a good school for the kid who needed a lot of nuturing. </p>\n\n<p>Okay these are my reservations about ONU. Other than pharmacy which is very selective because they have a 6 year program where you are admitted directly to the pharmacy school right out of HS, it just not that selective. I don’t want to discourage you, but the kids from my S’s HS who considered ONU are not the students that your S is. My feeling is that it’s a great school for those kids who are not really ready to enter an engineering program at a bigger more rigorous university. I am not talking about MIT but more like Ohio State or Cincinnati.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing that I would have reservations about is that everyone that I knew who considered ONU did because they could play a sport there. I just have a feeling that it’s one of those small schools that kids goto to continue playing. '</p>\n\n<p>Maybe someone else will respond to this and discount my feelings about the school because I’m not painting a very positive picture.</p>\n\n<p>My D has been accepted. Received a Deans scholarship for 10K. Pharmacy and Engineering are the biggest colleges but Biology is the biggest major that isn’t a college. My D is interested in poly sci and international studies. Nice campus of 3900 students with incrdible educational opportunities. The town is lacking immensely and the neighboring towns /cities aren’t the best in terms of metropolis. One has to decide what the next step in personal growth and development is for your student and that will help determine if it is a fit. Academically it is a great school. We have just returned from academic scholarship day and saw people from AL, WI, NY, PA, VA, Il, IN and Ohio. It is not the next level of personal growth and development that my D needs in her next step of independence. IT is however, for many students.</p>\n\n<p>This is currently my D first choice. We have visited many schools and we have been to ONU on several occasions for different events. We are VERY impressed with the personal attention given since we first inquired about this university over a year ago. </p>\n\n<p>My D is top 3 in her class and has a near perfect GPA and very good test scores. ONU is very strong in the sciences but that’s not the area she is currently interested in - she is exploring communications of which they have 4-5 different subareas - great to give her time to explore which facet she may enjoy most. She is currently leaning towards Public Relations - ONU’s program has been recognized nationally and deeply gets their student’s involved professionally as an undergraduate. </p>\n\n<p>True, Ada leaves much to be desired. But in the context of what we were looking for, this was not at the top of our list - EC outside of the campus. We know a few students who attend and the university goes out of their way to encourage/provide lots of activities on campus for students. I disagree on the level of student here. Considering the costs and the location students are choosing to attend here because of the academic setting and quality. The campus is very nice, but no, not to die for. In one year all students living their will be living in suites at the very least. They just opened a special complex for honor students this year which is very attractive and modern. </p>\n\n<p>ONU is listed as #5 in the Midwest Comprehensive Colleges - I believe it fits there. We visited others in the top five (St. Mary’s specifically) and ONU comes out on top for us.</p>\n\n<p>Again, the method to our madness is not to find the “best” college according to tiers, magazines, etc. We want to find the best fit for our daughter and ONU is definitely a major contender.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any other specific questions, please ask - like I said we’ve been their several times and I feel like I know their website as well as my own house!</p>\n\n<p>My daughter will be a Musical Theater major at ONU in the fall. We have visited once briefly, so only have vague positive impressions. She has a couple of friends there right now who seem to really like it. I’ve not been impressed with the website…a bit uncreative.</p>\n\n<p>I’m thinking it looks fairly nurturing (which we want right now…she’s still only 17), but am concerned about the comments that it might be a suitcase school. We are in Columbus, about an hour and a half away and don’t plan on sending her car along freshman year, so though I’m hoping to see her–maybe once a month?–am wanting her to stay on weekends and get acclimated to college.</p>\n\n<p>My brother went there in the 80s and never came home, though it was a 3 and a half hour drive for him.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone heard anything else regarding this or any other info on ONU?</p>\n\n<p>We’ve visited ONU several times (it’s only 75 minutes from us). We know 2 other families pretty well who have students there - one comes home somewhat often, but that’s because he has a girlfriend at home. The other family says their son only comes home about once a month on the weekend.</p>\n\n<p>It sounds like the campus makes a good effort to have weekend activities, but also being realistic it is ADA so if you’re looking for CONSTANT stuff to do and a wide variety it could be difficult. </p>\n\n<p>The fine arts center has LOTS of great performances/opportunities. My D will be in the same building for majority of classes - the Freed Center - since the Communications dept. is located there. She made the final decision to attend there last week - glad we are set with that!</p>\n\n<p>My D is not someone who needs to be socially active all the time. She studies hard and likes to have fun but also enjoys just chilling. She did get accepted into the honors program so she is excited about that - hope it all works out.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like I know LOTS about ONU - feel free to list any other ?'s or PM me…</p>\n\n<p>There are a few places in town - a couple of pizza places, Northern on Main (just across from campus - coffee house type place), a couple fast food (Taco Bell, Subway, KFC) - there also may be a restaurant or two in the small downtown area - we never stopped to check them out. </p>\n\n<p>Lima and Findlay are both about 20ish minutes away. They would both have hotels. </p>\n\n<p>Did you visit the MacIntosh Center when you were there? That is where the cafeteria is. They have since summer added a informal cafe type place there as an option for non-meal times and evenings (called something like the White Bear Inn …or something!) It has booths and is cozy. There is also a bowling alley (a few lanes) in the Center. </p>\n\n<p>I don’t know alot about the sororities - I know they have several including some service sororities. Our first visit there our tour guide was pledging - she seemed very nice, not showy and it all seemed good. My D just felt like this was a place she “belonged”.</p>\n\n<p>I posted on this thread years ago! My D graduated in 2007 with a degree in Public Relations - not a field ONU is specifically known for, but her opportunities there were AWESOME! She became involved with the field nationally in her junior and senior years, they won many, many national awards and she landed a good job right out of school. My point is, even besides engineering and pharm, the smaller depts at ONU seek to excel. </p>\n\n<p>D had MANY friends who were/are completing the 6 year pharm program. A couple in particular were stellar students upon arrival and have had many opportunities - 2 just got matched for a residency year in Ohio this week - if you are interested in pharm, Kroger has an awesome program where they give a nice yearly scholarship (several thousand I believe) in exchange for a certain hours of work each month in a Kroger store (one weekend a month I believe). </p>\n\n<p>I also have a neighbor whose D is a senior at ONU in the art dept. - she was not the best student in high school but has been nurtured and shined at ONU - she too has many opportunities for growth outside of the classroom, including in their dance program.</p>\n\n<p>I have a D who is a sophomore in high school - we would love for her to consider ONU. The biggest drawback is the small rural town if you are looking for lots of activity outside of campus. The housing was good each year - great on-campus apts for junior/senior year. Oh, and the second biggest drawback is the high tuition - crazy. But they do often award nice fin aid packages so it’s a good school to keep in the mix.</p>\n\n<p>My D who graduated from ONU is still VERY attached. She went back to do an alumni presentation two weeks ago and was thrilled to be back on campus. She stays in regular touch with a couple of professors. </p>\n\n<p>Feel free to PM me any other questions.</p>\n\n<p>ONU was near the top of DD’s list and she felt like it was ‘her people.’ During the on-campus scholarship competition day we attended we all agreed the food was excellent; the fine arts and student rec center facilities were most impressive and the obvious care and attention from faculty left us smiling. Our focus was biology. Jr and Sr housing appeared lovely; fresh. and sophomore dorms more basic. ONU has many engineering, pharmacy and pre-med folks who do very well after graduation. Two of daughter’s HS classmates went to ONU as pre-med and both got accepted to med school (tho one took an extra year of higher level science classes to better prepare for MCAT). I would recommend ONU to others. One doesn’t attend this college for off-campus partying; if that’s what you’re interested in, best to look elsewhere.</p>"
