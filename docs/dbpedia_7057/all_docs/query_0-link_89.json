French was transported by Green Township EMS to the Adena Regional Medical Center for minor injuries. French was treated and released. Landman is listed in critical condition.\n\nStinson succumbed to her injures as a result of the fire.\n\nThe Ohio State Fire Marshal was contacted to initiate an investigation of the fire.\n\nMultiple agencies assisted on the scene including the Ross County Sheriff’s Office, Union Township EMS, Union Township Fire Department, Green Township EMS, Concord Township EMS, Scioto Township EMS, and MedFlight.
