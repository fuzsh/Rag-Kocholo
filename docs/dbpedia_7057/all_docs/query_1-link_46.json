It's small, so you basically know everyone in your grade. And, it's not in a big city, so it's a very safe campus.\n\nOhio Northern is a small school in a small town. The campus is nice, and easy to walk to everything. The programs are good and most professors are good and accessible.\n\nAnna from Hilliard, OH\n\nGreat college in a small quiet town. The professors are amazing at their jobs and are very personable. I definitely recommend checking out Ohio Northern University as a choice for future students.\n\nJessica from Farmersville, OH\n\nThe best student tours. The professors took me into all of the labs that I would ever have a class in. My tour was one on one with a professor.\n\nMorgan from Columbia Station, OH\n\nOhio Northern University has a small town feel, which is perfect for me, and the overall community just makes you feel so welcomed. I will be playing softball and all the coaches there are just as welcoming and great as the students, professors and staff.\n\nAlexis from Batavia, OH\n\nONU is a great school! I highly recommend it for anyone who would enjoy a small, tight-knit community, with overall good people.
