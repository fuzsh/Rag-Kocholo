Every person on campus contributes to the “at home” feeling and supports the success of the next. The campus is stunning! There are numerous excellent local eateries that are near to the university. The instructors at ONU are also excellent resources.\n\nView more\n\nThe lecturers are all top-notch. The opportunities for academic and research work are very excellent. So if you detest little communities, stay away. Also, I have found that staying in the freshman dorms is a bad choice. Be prepared for the fire sirens to blare nonstop. Overall, this school is excellent for academics, and because it’s so small, you can really interact with the students. Nonetheless, I believe that living here is frequently tough and unfeasible.\n\nView more\n\nTo put it bluntly, it is a huge privilege to be able to attend a university like Ohio Northern University. I have finally benefited from this institution’s rigorous academic program. Although schoolwork occasionally presents a challenge, I always have resources at my disposal. This group’s members are decent people who actually take the time and make the effort to assist you in becoming the best version of yourself. In order to give students more options and support throughout their academic careers, I want the university to offer more scholarships.\n\nView more\n\nTo be able to attend an institution like Ohio Northern University is a great honor, to put it mildly.
