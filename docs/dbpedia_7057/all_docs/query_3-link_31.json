        "text": "Being a teacher candidate at ONU means being busy. You won’t be a passive learner; you’ll be out there doing, seeing and experiencing. You could study abroad or travel to professional education conferences, develop lesson plans or mentor local students, lead a student organization or embark on a cross-cultural experience. The opportunities are here for you to grab!\n\nKatelyn teaches visual arts, including classes in ceramics, advanced drawing and painting, and art history, for grades 7-12 at Milton Local School District in North Jackson, Ohio. She was named the 2014 Educator of the Year and 2018 Most Inspiring Teacher in Mahoning County.\n\n“I am passionate about the arts, and as an educator I am able to share the everyday value of art in our lives and make the subject matter exciting to learn.”\n\nColleen teaches physical science, forensics, microbiology and life structures at Hilliard Bradley High School, just outside of Columbus, Ohio.\n\n“The best thing about teaching is the impact you make on a student’s life. Whether you are a coach on the tennis court, an advisor for a club or a classroom teacher, you can and will change every student’s life one way or another.”\n\nAdam is the assistant principal at Lima North Middle School, where he taught social studies before moving into administration.\n\n“Working in education, each day is new and interesting. I get to help people (students and teachers) get better. I get to matter.”\n\nJulie is the principal of a non-traditional, urban public high school that serves students ages 17-21 who want to get a high school diploma. Students apply and are interviewed to be admitted to the Metro Nashville Public School, and their stories are incredibly diverse. Julie has won numerous teaching awards throughout her successful career working in urban schools.\n\n“Education is challenging and fulfilling and heartbreaking and hilarious. There is a strange dichotomy of daily rhythm and unpredictability. I problem solve and make adjustments on a moment-by-moment basis.”\n\nCasanova teaches English at Early College Academy, a dropout prevention and recovery high school in Columbus, and he’s an adjunct instructor at Columbus State Community College. He recently received his MFA in creative writing from Reinhardt University in Georgia.\n\n“I love the ‘aha!’ moment that happens in the classroom. I feel the most effective when a student who initially had difficulty with a concept grasps it on his or her own, or when I watch a student who started out unmotivated find success in class.”"
