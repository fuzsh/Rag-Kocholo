        "text": "ADA, Ohio – The No. 2 nationally-ranked Mount Union football team continued its dominance as the Purple Raiders won 45-0 at Ohio Northern in Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) action on Saturday.\n\nIt's the best start for Mount Union in regards to outscoring its opponents since the 2015 championship undefeated season when the Raiders only gave up seven points through the first four games.\n\nRaider senior wide receiver Wayne Ruby Jr. (Pembroke Pines, Fla./Charles W. Flanagan) continued to shine as he tied a career-high with four touchdown receptions, including the first three scores of the game.\n\nMount (4-0, 3-0 OAC) scored on three of its first four possessions, all from senior quarterback Braxton Plunk (Plant City, Fla./Plant City) connecting with Ruby Jr. through the air for a touchdown (from 11, 14, and nine yards out).\n\nSenior kicker Thomas Piccirillo (Findlay, Ohio/Van Buren) kicked a 24-yard field goal, followed by a one-yard touchdown run by Plunk, and Mount Union led 31-0 at halftime.\n\nOhio Northern (1-4, 1-3 OAC) did not enter Mount Union's territory in the first half, while only getting one first down.\n\nRuby grabbed his fourth touchdown of the game in the third, this time from 27 yards out. Senior KJ Redmon (Fairborn, Ohio/Fairborn) capped of the scoring for the Raiders with a 15-yard run.\n\nMount's defense continued its dominance in the second half, only allowing one first down – off a penalty (two first downs total for the game).\n\nThe Raiders outgained the Polar Bears, 506-66 yards (299-45 passing, 207-21 rushing). Plunk finished 21 of 27 for 274 yards and four touchdown passes, to go with a touchdown run. Ruby Jr. had nine catches for 153 yards and caught all four of Plunk's touchdown passes. Senior running back DeAndre Parker (Crystal River, Fla./Crystal River) ran for 132 yards, averaging 7.3 yards per carry, for his first 100-yard rushing game of the season (third of his career).\n\nJunior linebacker Mason McMillen (Wadsworth, Ohio/Wadsworth) led Mount's stout defense with seven tackles (two for a loss). Senior Kaleb Detellem (Batavia, Ohio/Batavia) tied a career-high with six tackles with a half tackle for a loss. Senior Landon Jenkins (Hilton Head, S.C./Hilton Head) added a strip sack and sophomore Von Factor (Fair Haven, N.J./Rumson-Fair Haven) had a half sack. Senior Ian Sexton (Dover, Ohio/Dover) had an interception, the first of his career.\n\nThe Raiders will be back home next Saturday, Oct. 8 versus OAC foe Heidelberg for their Homecoming game. Kickoff is set for 1:30 p.m.\n\nScoring Summary\n\nScoring Summary Scoring Play Visiting Team Score Home Team Score 1st Quarter MOUNT ONU\n\n12:40 - MOUNT - Wayne Ruby Jr. 11 yd pass from Braxton Plunk (T.
