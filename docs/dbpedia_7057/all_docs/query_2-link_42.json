        "text": "#29 in Presence of Female Faculty\n\nONU Law is tied for #29 in terms of the highest percentage of faculty who are female (46.9%).\n\n#51 in Bar Passage Rate\n\nONU Law ranks #51 in terms of bar passage rate among first-time test takers (87.0%), and it outperforms by +11.6% the state of Ohio’s overall bar passage rate of 75.4%. (A national comparison on this metric should be taken in a qualified sense and with caution, because every state has a different bar passage rate.)\n\n#53 in Student to Faculty Ratio\n\nONU Law is tied for #53 in terms of lowest student to faculty ratio (6.1:1).\n\n#70 in Median Undergraduate GPA\n\nONU Law ranks #70 in terms of highest median undergraduate GPA (3.52) among those applicants granted admission who enrolled as full-time students.\n\n#75 in Acceptance Rate\n\nONU Law ranks #75 in terms of student selectivity with an acceptance rate of 42.2% among those who applied for admission.\n\n#78 in Library Size\n\nONU Law ranks #78 in terms of library size with 459,494 volumes or equivalents.\n\n#148 in Median LSAT\n\nONU Law is tied for #148 in terms of the median LSAT score (151) among those applicants granted admission who enrolled as full-time students. The LSAT measures reading comprehension, analytical reasoning, and logical reasoning.\n\n#149 in Presence of Minority Faculty\n\nONU Law ranks #149 in terms of the highest percentage of faculty who are racial or ethnic minority (9.4%).\n\n#153 in Presence of Minority Students\n\nONU Law ranks #153 in terms of the highest percentage of students who are racial or ethnic minority (23.1%).\n\n#160 in Public Sector Salary\n\nONU Law is tied for #160 in terms of median starting salary among graduates working in government jobs or judicial clerkships at the federal or state level ($46,434).\n\n#165 in Private Sector Salary\n\nONU Law is tied for #165 in terms of the median starting salary among graduates working in private practice as law firm associates ($55,000).\n\n#211 in Highest Tuition\n\nONU Law ranks #211 in terms of highest tuition among full-time law students ($29,160). We rank from a total of 283 tuition rates from 194 law schools, ranking twice those law schools that have different in-state and out-of-state tuition rates.\n\nAbout this Report\n\nThis report was released in spring 2019.\n\nGPA & LSAT\n\nReferences to the lowest, median, and highest GPA and LSAT scores reflect those of the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile, respectively, among those applicants granted admission who enrolled as full-time students in fall 2018.\n\nAcceptance Rates\n\nThe acceptance rate is that of applicants granted admission as full-time students for classes commencing in fall 2018. The acceptance rate of the applicants does not reflect actual enrollment rates, a subset figure.\n\nStudent-to-Faculty Ratios\n\nThe student-to-faculty ratio shows the number of students for that class per faculty member. This ratio reflects the applicants granted admission who enrolled as full-time students in fall 2018.\n\nBar Passage Rates\n\nThe bar passage rates reflect those among first-time test takers for the winter and summer 2017 administrations of the bar examinations. The state noted is that in which the greatest number of the law school's graduates took the bar exam for the reported period.\n\nEmployment Rates\n\nThe employment rates shown are those of the 2017 full-time graduates at the time of graduation and ten months after graduation.\n\nLaw Library Volumes\n\nThe data indicate the number of print and microform volumes, as well as volume equivalents.\n\nGender, Race & Ethnicity\n\nThe data shown indicate the percentage of the faculty that are male and female, respectively, and the percentage of the faculty and students that are racial or ethnic minority (Hispanics of any race, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, multiracial, non-resident alien, or unknown race).\n\nSalaries\n\nThe salary statistics are those of full-time, long-term employed law graduates for the class of 2017 at the time of graduation and within ten months after graduation (approximately spring 2018 ), as self-reported by the graduates.\n\nThe salaries indicated for “Median Salary Private” reflect those salaries of the 50th percentile, among those graduates working in private practice as law firm associates. The salaries indicated for “Median Salary Public” reflect those salaries of the 50th percentile, among those graduates working in government jobs or judicial clerkships at the federal or state level.\n\nIn determining median salaries, jobs classified as “JD advantage” have been excluded (i.e., positions in which the employer requires a JD or considers it an advantage to hold such a degree, but in which admission to the bar is not required).\n\nReport Title\n\nThe rationale behind entitling this report as the “2020” report is that our 2020 Law School Rankings report and 2020 Law School Profiles are of considerable interest to prospective law school applicants who seek to enroll in classes commencing in fall 2020. At the time of our publication of this report in spring 2019, these employment statistics reflected the most current data available.\n\nSource: The data have been compiled from a variety of public sources, including data released by the law schools and from the bar examiner offices in each jurisdiction.\n\nNext Release: Our 2021 report is slated for publication in spring 2020.\n\nAbout this Report\n\nThis report was released in spring 2019.\n\nGPA & LSAT\n\nReferences to the lowest, median, and highest GPA and LSAT scores reflect those of the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile, respectively, among those applicants granted admission who enrolled as full-time students in fall 2018.\n\nAcceptance Rates\n\nThe acceptance rate is that of applicants granted admission as full-time students for classes commencing in fall 2018.
