        "text": "Hand colored postcard of the campus of Ohio Normal School, now ONU. Hill Memorial is at right, Dukes Building is at left.\n\nPHOTO from https://theclio.com/entry/119452\n\nLead donor would be needed to save, renovate 1879 structure\n\nBy Paula Pyzik Scott\n\nHill Memorial building, often used as the “face” of Ohio Northern University in promotional materials, has come to a critical moment in its existence. Built in 1879 and the survivor of two major fires, the building will be closed on the last day of July 2024.\n\nFollowing an Icon interview with university representatives, Jason Broge, Vice President for Financial Affairs, and Shannon Spencer, Vice President for Advancement, ONU issued the following statement on the closure of the building.\n\n“Ohio Northern University is still exploring its options as we consider the future of Hill Memorial. No decision has been made. All options – including the repair and renovation of the building – remain under consideration.\n\n“This spring the University completed a comprehensive facilities master plan with BHDP, an architecture and planning firm in Columbus. That process included an analysis of our 38 campus buildings, including Hill.\n\n“Engineers with the firm identified grave problems with Hill’s foundation, exterior and interior, with an estimated repair and renovation cost of more than $9 million. BHDP recommended that Hill be decommissioned and eventually demolished, and offered ideas for different green spaces on the site.\n\n“Out of an abundance of caution, based on the identified structural problems of the building, we will be closing Hill Memorial on July 31, 2024. The building will be maintained to ensure it remains in a suitable condition for possible renovation. Faculty, staff and classes located in the building will move to the Dukes Building for fall.\n\n“The University remains committed to a decision-making process that is respectful of Hill’s history, while balancing what is feasible, practical and best supports our academic mission.”\n\nBroge and Spencer emphasized that a final decision has not been made about the fate of Hill Memorial, but that the university’s fiscal health and educational mission are the administration's leading responsibilities.\n\nCurrently, Hill Memorial is excess to ONU needs for office and classroom space. Some six History and Political Science department offices will be moved to the Dukes Building.\n\nBroge explained that beyond the closure, the building is essentially “on pause” and that there is not yet a timeline for what happens next.\n\nIn terms of historical features, the building has virtually no original interior; it has utilitarian, 20th century finishes including dropped ceilings. The stucco applied to the building exterior c. 1980s has created moisture problems.\n\nTo fund major structural repairs and renovate the building would require the financial support of a lead donor, said Spencer.\n\nSpencer confirmed that alumni are aware of the situation and noted that all but one of the members of the board of trustees are alumni. The demolition of Hill Memorial has been considered since 2014, when the recommendation was first made by consultants in the university’s master plan.\n\nInformation about Hill Memorial’s history is available HERE."
