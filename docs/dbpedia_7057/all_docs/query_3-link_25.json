        "text": "Is Ohio Northern in a huge financial crisis? I want you to hear this loud and clear: No\n\nJulie Hurtig, Ohio Northern University Provost\n\nOn Monday, Ohio Northern University Provost Dr. Julie Hurtig attended a Town Hall to answer student questions. The event was hosted by Student Senate, which has previously hosted Town Hall events with President Melissa Baumann and Financial Vice President Jason Broge. Hurtig sought to directly address an email sent to all ONU students Friday indicating that academic review will result in the removal of some faculty, and will “likely” result in the closing of some programs within the next two years. Hurtig provided clarification to University policies and attitudes about the change, and shared some advice for ONU students. Here’s everything you need to know.\n\nWho is the Provost?\n\nAn academic Provost is a high-ranking administrative position at universities which is usually responsible for overseeing large-scale curriculum decisions. Hurtig’s background is in Electrical Engineering, but her experience with ONU predates professorship; she is a ‘91 alumnus. She says, “I bleed Orange and Black,” and was “certainly” willing to speak to ONU students about the budget.\n\nWhy is Ohio Northern in financial trouble, and how bad is it?\n\nAccording to Hurtig, there are two primary drivers of economic strain for the University. One is a “demographic cliff” which will soon result from a decline in reproduction during the 2008 recession. Hurtig believes the enrollment cliff will last several years: “They’re not saying it was just a one year blip…they’re continuing to not have children.” Second, Hurtig says, is the role of the media in promoting alternatives to a college education, exacerbates a decline in prospective interest.\n\nPresident Baumann’s email says “we will need to reduce the number of faculty and staff and we will likely need to close some of ONU’s academic programs.” Still, Hurtig stresses “that doesn’t necessarily mean a program is going to be cut.” She further emphasizes: “Is Ohio Northern in a huge financial crisis? I want you to hear this loud and clear: No”\n\nHow will faculty be cut?\n\nFaculty are not disappearing in May, let me stress that…they get at least one year’s notice.\n\nJulie Hurtig, Provost\n\nThe process the University is using to determine which faculty are removed is complex. In this process, “the first step is we allow all the faculty to be identified,” which Hurtig says happened at a faculty meeting on Friday. The next step is to give faculty the chance to “be creative” in finding solutions to programming problems, and communicate these to the University. Another student town hall is likely in February, although “it’s going to be pretty quiet” until then. Final decisions will be made in March and announced shortly thereafter. Hurtig says, “you will definitely hear the decision when it comes out, which will likely be in late March…..that’s impossible to hide, let’s be honest.”\n\nStill, Hurtig includes a few points of qualifying clarification. She wants the student body to understand that “faculty are not disappearing in May, let me stress that…they get at least one year’s notice.” Also, when asked about what metrics she might consider, she says, “I will not be using course evaluations…that’s just not how I can let someone go.” However, Hurtig still affirms the value in course evaluations: “they are your voice, use them.” Finally, she confirms “those with Tenure are the last to be looked at [for firing]….that’s just a right of seniority.”\n\nHow will programs be cut?\n\nWhile, again, program cuts are not guaranteed at this stage, Baumann has identified them as “likely.” Hurtig’s comments on program cuts repeatedly cited the phasing out of the German program a few years ago at Ohio Northern as a model of the “Teach Out” method, which is required by the state of Ohio. Under this rule, anyone currently enrolled in a major at ONU is entitled to complete the major, and Hurtig says these final classes can usually be taught with the same faculty who were previously permanently attached to the major.\n\nHurtig also stressed the range of options available. For example, she suggests “maybe we have three electives instead of four in a major.” She also identifies Youth Ministry as a very low-enrollment major that ONU may continue to offer on account of Ohio Northern already offering all of the necessary classes: “We have…classes that serve Youth Ministry that always run.”\n\nThis is the really complex world of how our catalog functions\n\nJulie Hurtig, Provost\n\nWhen asked about the distribution of downsizing across colleges, Hurtig says that the Getty College of Arts and Sciences will likely see the most reduction: “They frankly have the most faculty and have the most majors,” with 45 of Ohio Northern’s 61 majors, or around 75%. Still, Hurtig characterizes A&S as the “backbone” of the University, citing the regular enrollment in A&S classes by students of other colleges. She also stresses that within A&S, majors are “intertwined”: “The History classes are needed by the Engineers, and the PoliSci classes are needed by the Comm Arts.”\n\nFinally, Hurtig encourages the Ohio Northern student body to study hard for finals, and to “try not to worry about us on that front….we know what we’re doing here.”\n\nEditor’s Note: This article has been updated to correct misspellings (12/7/2023)."
