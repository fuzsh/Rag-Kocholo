        "text": "\"I would certainly recommend Ohio Northern University (ONU) to any prospective Doctor of Pharmacy student for several reasons. First, the school offers a \"0-6\" program or a stream-lined degree that combines both the under-graduate and graduate degree. This is beneficial, because once you are in the program your freshman year you are not required to reapply for the graduate school. Second, the preparation I received at the University made me an excellent practitioner once out in the field during my externship. I now play a preceptor role as a licensed pharmacist and am able to see how the ONU students compare to other students and they are always in the front of the pack academically. Last, this program has a long and prestigious track record for pharmacy. They have seen and done it all!\"\n\n\"At a first look, one might think Ohio Northern University is located in the middle of a corn field in northwest Ohio. To a certain extent, you would be correct. However, you are missing the big picture on this small, Division III campus. Located in Ada, OH, Ohio Northern offers top notch academics ranging from an elite business college to a quality engineering program. I majored in Biochemistry and had aspirations to attend medical school. ONU prepared me exceptionally well, through a great student to faculty ratio and advanced courses tailored for Pre-Med students. Overall, I cannot be happier with my selection of an undergraduate education.\"\n\n\"Ohio Northern was a great school for me. The music department was not too big or too small. Classroom size averaged around 15-20 students at times. I feel having the small school experience has benefited me in extraordinary ways. I had the opportunity to play in major ensembles and perform pieces that graduate students would usually play if I went to a bigger school. With the teaching and performing experience I got from Ohio Northern, I am able to do well at a bigger Graduate School because I already received a graduate experience while obtaining my undergraduate. I was able to hit the ground running when I started graduate school. Thanks to Ohio Northern, I'm ahead of other graduate students when it comes to experience. Now I am able to help others without getting behind on practicing or teaching, because I am used to having to teach others and perform difficult pieces as an undergraduate. I can't thank Ohio Northern enough for the experience I was able to achieve. Education classes may show you how to teach, but experience teaches you how to teach. Thank you Ohio Northern!\"\n\n\"Ohio Northern University has, in my opinion, one of the most prestigious pharmacy programs in the country. Founded in 1884, Ohio Northern has a NAPLEX pass rate of 98 percent; that is incredible! Further, the average job placement for pharmacy graduates of Ohio Northern University heralds also at 98 percent. While the curriculum is definitely challenging, the professors and staff are extremely helpful and supportive, encouraging students to not only excel while in school, but to excel in their future careers. Another advantage to Ohio Northern's program is that it is one of only a handful of six-straight pharmaceutical doctorate programs in the country. The advantages of entering the accelerated doctorate program are many, but are especially relevant to graduating high school seniors and those who have decided to enter pharmacy after only a year or two of undergraduate classes. As an alumni of Ohio Northern University I would highly recommend this school to anyone seriously pursuing a degree that will equip, empower, and prepare then to confidently enter the profession of pharmacy.\"\n\n\"At Ohio Northern, students are pushed to their full potential in and out of the classroom. Classes are difficult, but if you take the time to study and go to office hours, you will do well. Professors are always around and are willing to help. Outside of the classroom, their are various activities and groups you can join. There are a lot of club sports as well as varsity sports. There are also many clubs and organizations you can join.\"\n\n\"Ohio Northern University is a college that quickly becomes your new home. Rarely will you go a day walking campus without receiving a friendly gesture, such as a hello or a smile, from a stranger. Here at ONU, we are family. Even more, the pharmacy program is top notch, providing opportunities for both leadership and grown, real-world experience every step of the way, and a high job placement rate after graduation!\"\n\n\"I loved my time at Ohio Northern University and the professors and staff at the college of business. I was able to find a great job due to my time at ONU and feel like any student would be lucky to go there and have the one on one relationships with professors.\""
