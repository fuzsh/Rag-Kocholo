        "text": "Academics\n\nMany students are attracted to Ohio Northern University‘s “prestigious” Raabe College of Pharmacy, a “six-year program” that “is focused on developing the next generation of clinical pharmacists who are well rounded leaders, clinicians, and members of society.” But this comprehensive university offers its 2,900 students lots of other outstanding academic options: “The accounting program is highly ranked,” “it has a great political science program that has sent many students to graduate school and politics,” and “the engineering college is great.” An ONU education provides practical applications for knowledge as well as theoretical ones, with a “wonderful incorporation of current events and timeless business principles.” Students are also drawn to ONU‘s “good financial aid” and “varsity sports,” with one athlete noting that ONU “was my most affordable option of Division III schools where I could play soccer and receive a quality education.” Undergrads feel that their “renowned faculty” “are outstanding and all influential in the field,” but also that their “professors are very friendly and down to earth” and that they “are real and treat students like people not as if they are beneath them, so it is easier to understand material.” In addition to academic performance, “professors care about the student‘s well-being and future endeavors” and “they are always available to help.” “It’s great that even though there are 170-plus senior pharmacy majors, the professors still know my name.” ONU‘s “classes are tough, no doubt about it,” but “my overall academic experience has been above and beyond anything I could‘ve expected.” As a whole, students call ONU “a top-notch education with a family-like atmosphere that is very conducive for learning and excelling in many disciplines.”\n\nStudent Body\n\nAs you might expect, “in a small town, students must get along because there are high chances they will see one another again,” so at ONU, “everyone is very caring toward each other.” The typical ONU student “is committed to academics, to service, and has leadership potential,” and students appreciate that “everyone here finds a supportive group of friends.” Many students are Midwestern and “some denomination of Christian,” with a majority of ONU’s population hailing from “in-state, some surrounding states, and internationals.” Students see themselves as involved and conscientious: ONU students often belong to “several clubs and organizations,” are “always willing to help or mentor younger students, and very concerned about academic success.” One undergrad offers this bit of advice: “Most students are friends with other people in the same activities that they’re involved in, so join something you’re interested in and don’t be shy!”\n\nCampus Life\n\nONU’s hometown of Ada, OH, is a “small town,” but one with “good places to eat and a movie theatre.” There’s also a “big town,” Columbus, 90 minutes away “with a lot of attractions so always something to do if you have the time to drive.” “Because we are in a small town, the students bond together to find fun things to do,” including D3 athletics and “pick-up sports games,” “fraternity house parties and local bars (The Regal Beagle and The Cask Room),” as well as “several university-sponsored events throughout the year.” Socializing and academics mix freely: “People love hanging out with each other, especially when they are trying to get things done.” Social life can be a “mixed bag” of “students who spend all of their time focused on school” and “a good number of students who enjoy having a good time and hanging out with friends”; still “people here are very relaxed—you do what you want and everyone is fine with you being who you are.” “Students usually party on the weekends,” but “hard drugs are rare.” Dorm life is also popular: “It’s easy to have fun in the dorms, especially during winter.”"
