The observatory is primarily used by ONU students in physics and astronomy classes, faculty, and by the ONU Astronomy Club. However, it is also opened up for public events on a semi-regular basis.”\n\nSee the Observatory website for public programming information.\n\n[[ We hope to visit soon and update with our own photos and additional information. ]]"
