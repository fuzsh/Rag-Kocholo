About 1.6% of students at Ohio Northern came from a poor family but became a rich adult.\n\nA new study, based on millions of anonymous tax records, shows that some colleges are even more economically segregated than previously understood, while others are associated with income mobility.\n\nBelow, estimates of how Ohio Northern compares with its peer schools in economic diversity and student outcomes."
