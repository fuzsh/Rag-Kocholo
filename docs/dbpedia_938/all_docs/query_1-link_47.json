        "text": "CONSTRUCTION NOTICE\n\nBayfront Parking Lot Maintenance - a pavement maintenance project for Bayfront Park is scheduled for late July to mid-October, 2024. The park and boat launch ramp will be open at all times. See details below.\n\nGaylord Pacific - several roads near and around Bayside Park are closed due to construction of the Gaylord Pacific Resort and Convention Center. The project impacts access to Bayside Park, some bayfront businesses, and the Bayshore Bikeway. See details below.\n\nCurrent Construction Projects\n\nBayfront Park Parking Lot Maintenance Project\n\nA pavement maintenance project is scheduled for late July to mid-October, 2024. Construction will take place in phases to ensure pedestrian and vehicle access in both travel directions, with traffic control, minimizing public impacts. Below is what the public can expect over the 90-day project.\n\nThe PARK and BOAT LAUNCH will be OPEN at ALL TIMES.\n\nNo detours will be required, but traffic control measures will be in place.\n\nParking will be limited; an adjacent dirt lot can be used.\n\nPhase 1: Late July to mid-August (see map here)\n\nPhase 2: Mid-August to early September\n\nPhase 3: Early September to mid-September\n\nPhase 4: Mid-September to early October\n\nThis project is part of the Port’s yearly Major Maintenance Program. The Board of Port Commissioners awarded a $1.45 million construction contract to Griffith Company in April.\n\nGaylord Pacific Construction\n\nSeveral roads near and around Bayside Park are closed. The project impacts access to Bayside Park, some bayfront businesses, and the Bayshore Bikeway. See details below and check back here for updates.\n\nClick here for current road closures map. Directional and detour signs are posted.\n\nG Street between Marina Parkway and Bayside Parkway is TEMPORARILY CLOSED. To access Bayside Park and Marine Group Boat Works, use H Street to Marina Parkway to Sandpiper Way, which will extend via a temporary access road. (Access to Bayside Park and Marine Group Boat Works is not available from Lagoon Drive.)\n\nQuay Avenue south of G Street; Sandpiper Way between Chula Vista Marina and G Street; and Bayside Parkway between Quay Avenue and Sandpiper Way are PERMANENTLY CLOSED.\n\nFor public safety, public access to Bayside Park will be limited or unavailable at times. Plus, no event permits will be issued.\n\nBayshore Bikeway – the path toward the shoreline will remain open; however, some of the streetside bike lanes will close and detours will direct cyclists to alternate new and existing bike lanes.\n\nFirst Gaylord on the West Coast\n\nGaylord Hotels is the large convention hotel brand of Marriott International. When it opens, Gaylord Pacific will be Gaylord Hotels’ first West Coast location. With its nationally recognized brand, the Gaylord Pacific Resort and Convention Center is expected to spur other development on the 535-acre Chula Vista Bayfront.\n\nAdditional Projects\n\nSweetwater Park\n\nSweetwater Park\n\nConstruction on Sweetwater Park began in fall 2023, and completion is anticipated in late 2024.\n\nThis new park is envisioned as a natural habitat-oriented recreational open space to showcase the unique natural wildlife assets of San Diego Bay, encouraging passive activities to complement the adjacent Sweetwater Marsh National Wildlife Refuge. The 21-acre park was designed with community input and will be enjoyed by residents and visitors for decades to come. Features will include meadows and specialty gardens; mounded grasslands; nature playgrounds; various seating and picnic areas; pedestrian and bicycle paths – some paved and others with softer surfaces; sand dunes; overlooks for bayfront viewing, incorporation of Kumeyaay signage, public art, public restroom facilities, 216 parking spaces, and more. The park will connect visitors with the bayfront’s ecology and provide environmental educational opportunities and family/child-oriented recreational exploration.\n\nSweetwater Park, along with the future Harbor Park, will account for more than half of the new park space planned for the Chula Vista Bayfront.\n\nHarbor Park\n\nHarbor Park\n\nHarbor Park will nearly double the size of the existing Bayside Park and will be developed in phases. Proposed features at full buildout of the park include an enlarged and improved beach; waterside terraced headlands surrounding the beach; a pocket marsh with salt marsh plantings; a portion of the waterfront promenade; a boat launch at the north end for personal watercraft such as kayaks and paddleboards; north and south meadows with paths and picnic tables; formal, multi-use lawns and large public gathering areas at the north and south ends; north promontory providing dramatic views across the bay to the west to downtown San Diego and the Coronado Bridge to the north; pedestrian and bicycle improvements; beach lawn; interactive fountain; children and family play area; café and beach rental building (including restrooms) at the north end; more parking; a new pier at H Street; improvements to address sea level rise; and more. The existing fishing pier will remain and will be in addition to the future H Street pier.\n\nHarbor Park, along with the future Sweetwater Park, will account for more than half of the new park space planned for the Chula Vista Bayfront.\n\nSun Outdoors San Diego Bay RV Resort\n\nSun Outdoors San Diego Bay RV Resort\n\nNow Open!\n\nLocated at E Street and Bay Boulevard, this RV resort includes a mix of RV sites and vacation cottage rentals with a variety of upscale resort amenities including an onside café and bar, indoor/outdoor gym, arcade, welcome center and pool with panoramic views of San Diego Bay. Visitors can also enjoy the Chula Vista Bayfront’s Sweetwater Marsh, Sweetwater Bicycle Path & Promenade, and the Living Coast Discovery Center right next door, plus nearby marinas, bayfront parks, and more.\n\nLearn more at sunrvresorts.com/sun-outdoors-san-diego-bay/.\n\nSweetwater Bicycle Path & Promenade\n\nSweetwater Bicycle Path & Promenade\n\nNow Open!\n\nSweetwater Bicycle Path & Promenade (Sweetwater Path) is a new multi-use pedestrian and bicycle path that connects Bayside Park, the marinas, and more to the northern area of the Chula Vista Bayfront where Sweetwater Marsh, the Living Coast Discovery Center, and the new Sun Outdoors San Diego Bay RV resort are located. Funded by an Urban Greening Grant from the California Natural Resources Agency, Sweetwater Path provides public recreation while protecting the environment and natural resources, is the first phase of a continuous bike and pedestrian path between the northern and southern ends of the Chula Vista Bayfront, and is an important connection to the existing Bayshore Bikeway. The Urban Greening Grant is funded through the California Climate Investments Program. Sweetwater Path supports the Port’s goals of creating a vibrant waterfront destination on the Chula Vista Bayfront and a safe and healthy place for all to visit, work and play.\n\nThe path's primary features include a truss pedestrian bridge spanning the F & G Street Marsh inlet; benches and overlook areas for optimal views of San Diego Bay; native trees, shrubs and ornamental landscaping; and improvements near the bridge to restore a naturalized channel bed and channel stability while also creating new wetland habitat and increasing resiliency of the wetlands to sea level rise.\n\nPacifica\n\nPacifica\n\nPacifica Companies is in the planning stages for a residential, hotel and commercial development to be located on a City of Chula Vista parcel near the marinas. The finished project could include 1,500 condos, the first phase of which would be just under 200 units. There will also be up to 420,000 square feet of commercial space, and a 250-room hotel. ​It’s being designed to be pedestrian friendly incorporating wide public plazas and promenades within the interior and exterior of the community.​\n\nChula Vista Bayfront Master Plan\n\nThe Chula Vista Bayfront Master Plan is a local and state-approved land use plan by the Port of San Diego and City of Chula Vista. The plan envisions:\n\n70 acres of new parks (100 acres total, including existing parks)\n\n120 acres of open space, habitat replacement, wetlands and ecological buffers to protect wildlife habitat, species and other coastal resources\n\nShoreline promenade, walking trails and bicycle path network\n\n2,850 total hotel rooms\n\n600,000 square feet of restaurant, retail and marina-support uses\n\n220,000 square feet of mixed-use commercial recreation/marine-related office uses\n\n1,100 – 3,000 space parking facility\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nCalifornia Coastal Commission unanimously approves Chula Vista Bayfront Master Plan.\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nSouth Bay Power Plant imploded.\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nPort adopts a Natural Resource Management Plan.\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nPort approves Coastal Development Permit for Sweetwater Park.\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nThe City of Chula Vista and the Port of San Diego finalize the bond financing strategy for the Chula Vista Bayfront.\n\nMay 10: The City and Port voted on any remaining documents that were needed to finalize the leasing documents and its contributions to this project.\n\nMay 11: The Chula Vista Bayfront Facilities Financing Authority (“Authority”) voted on a package of documents to authorize any remaining actions needed to issue bonds.\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nAnticipated opening of Sweetwater Park.\n\nToggle Milestone\n\nAnticipated opening of the Gaylord Resort & Convention Center."
