The other 80-90 percent are “the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, and the systems put in place to deal with illness,” known as social determinants of health (SDOH).1 This means that a significant proportion of disease burden within a community is shaped by SDOH, such as distribution of income, housing status, and access to healthcare.\n\nThe Demographic Profiles are a compilation of information relating to demographic characteristics of specific populations in San Diego County, including SDOH. Each Profile contains demographic data for each HHSA Region and subregional area (SRA), including age, gender, race/ethnicity distributions, school enrollment, educational attainment, income, occupation, housing, and other SDOH. Many of these factors have been implicated at the roots of health disparities. The profiles are designed to help HHSA staff in each of the Health and Human Services Regions (Regions) and other local organizations, including Live Well San Diego recognized partners, identify, and prioritize needs within their communities.\n\nThe demographic profiles below contain the most recent demographic and economic data available by Health and Human Services (HHSA) region, city, and supervisorial district in PDF format.
