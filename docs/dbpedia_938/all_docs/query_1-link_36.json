        "text": "ISSUES\n\nSanÂ JosÃ© and SanÂ Diego Have Adopted Plans for Addressing Homelessness but Do Not Completely Report on All of Their Homelessness Funding\n\nKey Points\n\nNeither SanÂ JosÃ© nor SanÂ Diego tracks and reports in one location, such as a spending plan, all of its funding and spending related to homelessness. The citiesâ fragmented reporting limits public transparency and accountability for hundredsÂ of millions of dollars in state, federal, and local funding. It also impedes the citiesâ ability to assess the effectiveness of their spending.\n\nSanÂ JosÃ© did not develop a plan with cityâspecific goals for reducing homelessness until JanuaryÂ 2024. As a result, it has struggled to evaluate the effectiveness of its actions.\n\nSanÂ Diego established a cityâspecific plan for reducing homelessness inÂ 2019. This plan identifies clear strategies and goals that have enabled SanÂ Diego to prioritize the needs of its residents who are experiencing homelessness. The city recently updated its goals to reflect changing conditions.\n\nNeither SanÂ JosÃ© nor SanÂ Diego Centrally Tracks and Reports Its Spending on HomelessnessÂ Efforts\n\nBoth SanÂ JosÃ© and SanÂ Diego identified hundreds of millions of dollars in spending of federal, state, and local funding to respond to the homelessness crisis over the last threeÂ years. However, neither city has established a methodâsuch as a spending planâfor collecting and tracking in a central location information about the homelessness funding it receives and spends. As a result, the cities lack the information necessary to easily assess the effectiveness of their spending. Further, by not providing comprehensive funding and spending information to the public and policymakers, the cities have limited transparency and accountability.\n\nIn our attempt to create a complete list of their homelessness funding and spending, we worked extensively with the twoÂ cities to develop methods to identify from their accounting records the amounts they had received and spent on homelessness efforts from fiscal yearÂ 2020â21 through 2022â23. In the absence of an independent source to verify the amounts of homelessness funding the cities received and spent, we relied upon each city to ensure that they accurately identified the information they provided to us. Therefore, we could not validate the accuracy and completeness of these amounts. During the threeâyear period of our review, the cities were each awarded federal and state grant funding for which they had to apply, as well as federal stimulus funding. Each funding source typically has a deadline by which the cities must spend the funding. Each source also has established eligible uses for the funding, which AppendixÂ A lists. In addition to the federal and state funding they received, both cities allocated local funds for homelessness purposes. For example, SanÂ JosÃ© allocated some Measure E funding for homelessness, as we discuss in theÂ Introduction.\n\nTableÂ 1 shows the aggregate amounts of federal, state, and local funding that SanÂ JosÃ© identified that it had received or allocated for its homelessness efforts in the past threeÂ fiscal years. As the table shows, at the end of fiscal year 2022â23, SanÂ JosÃ© had more than $13Â million remaining of the federal funding and more than $53Â million of the state funding it had received. About $46Â million of that remaining funding related to twoÂ statewide programs: Homekey and the Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention Program (HHAP). The State awarded Homekey funding to SanÂ JosÃ© for specific projects that involve remodeling hotels and motels to create housing. In contrast, SanÂ JosÃ© can use HHAP funding for a number of purposes, which we list in AppendixÂ A. The spending deadlines for both programs are still years away. In fact, the State allocated SanÂ JosÃ© more than $55Â million in additional HHAP funding for RoundsÂ 4 andÂ 5 that it had not yet received during our auditÂ period.\n\nTable 1\n\nAs of June 2023,

Therefore, we present only spent amounts for these funding sources.\n\nÂ§âAward was received prior to the audit period, and remaining balance is as of January 30, 2024. The city did not identify the amount of expenditures for ESGâCV for fiscal year 2020â21.\n\nllâBecause some funding sources do not have award and received amounts we do not include them in the subtotals for those columns.\n\n#âThe remaining balance also accounts for encumbered funds.\n\n**âHEAPâAward was received prior to the audit period and some funds were spent during that period.

As a result, the cityâs accounting records do not include all information.\n\nÂ§Â§âSome local appropriations are multiâyear appropriations and therefore have remaining balances.\n\nll llâLocal funding is generally not awarded from a non-city source, so award or received amounts are not included for local funds.\n\n##âFireâPersonal ServicesâThe fire department estimated its homelessnessârelated expenditures based on the number of homelessnessârelated incidents it responded to.\n\nAt the end of fiscal year 2022â23, SanÂ JosÃ© also had more than $86Â million remaining of the local funds that it had budgeted that year for homelessness purposes. This amount includes its MeasureÂ E funding. Some local appropriations are multiâyear appropriations and therefore have remaining balances. TableÂ 1 identifies the purposes for which the city budgeted that funding. Over the last threeÂ fiscal years, the city spent more than $20Â million in MeasureÂ E funding for purposes related to homelessness. It spent 69Â percent of this amountâor about $14Â millionâin fiscal year 2022â23.\n\nTableÂ 2 similarly shows the aggregate amounts of federal, state and local funding that SanÂ Diego identified that it had received or allocated for its homelessness efforts in the past threeÂ fiscal years. At the end of fiscal year 2022â23, SanÂ Diego had more than $52Â million in funding designated for homelessness efforts still available. The State also allocated SanÂ Diego additional HHAP fundingâabout $52Â millionâthat it had not received during our audit period. From fiscal year 2020â21 through 2022â23, SanÂ Diego spent more than $87Â million of its local funding for homelessness purposes. However, the city does not roll over unspent amounts from local funds, so the table does not include a remaining balance for these funds.\n\nTable 2\n\nSanÂ Diego Had Millions of Dollars in Funding to Reduce Homelessness Remaining\n\nFiscal Years 2020â21 Through 2022â23\n\nDESCRIPTION AWARD AMOUNT* RECEIVEDâ SPENT (3 YR TOTAL) HOMELESSNESS-RELATED REMAINING BALANCE AS OF 6/30/23 SPEND DEADLINE (AS APPLICABLE) FEDERAL Community Development Block Grant Fund (CDBG) â¡ â¡ $8,165,853 â CDBGâFY21 4,124,811 â CDBGâFY22 1,557,047 â CDBGâFY23 2,483,995 â Community Development Block GrantâCARES ActâFY21 â¡ â¡ 4,599,062 $609,938 9/22/26 Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) $3,139,753 $3,139,753 3,091,466 48,287 24 months after HUD signed the agreement with recipient ESGâFY21 1,043,517 1,043,517 1,043,286 231 ESGâFY22 1,047,275 1,047,275 1,047,274 1 ESGâFY23 1,048,961 1,048,961 1,000,906 48,055 Emergency Solutions GrantâCARES Act 26,394,450 26,394,450 25,908,440 486,010 9/30/23 HOME Investment Partnerships American Rescue PlanÂ Program â¡ â¡ â 2,000,000 9/30/30 CARES Act â¡ â¡ 29,274,809 â SubtotalâFederal fundingÂ§ $29,534,203 $29,534,203 $71,039,630 $3,144,235 STATE AB 179âEmergency Shelter for Victims of Domestic Violence $2,000,000 â â $2,000,000 6/30/26 SB 89âCOVID-19 Emergency Homelessness Funding 3,699,316 $3,736,627 $3,736,627 â Must be encumbered by 6/30/20 Encampment Resolution Funding GrantâRound 2 2,446,500 2,446,500 â 2,446,500 Within threeÂ years of appropriation Family Homelessness Challenge Grant 441,151 441,151 â 441,151 6/30/26 Homeless Emergency Aid Program 14,110,398 14,633,673 14,633,673 â Homeless Housing Assistance and Prevention (HHAP) Grant 113,041,368 60,636,117 39,438,869 21,197,247 HHAP Grant 22,491,840 22,522,672 16,716,890 5,805,782 6/30/25 HHAP Grant II 10,632,506 10,632,506 8,090,798 2,541,708 6/30/26 HHAP Grant III 27,480,939 27,480,939 14,631,181 12,849,757 6/30/26 HHAP Grant IV 22,517,490 â â â 6/30/27 HHAP Grant V 29,918,593 â â â 6/30/28 Permanent Local Housing Allocation Program 24,693,854 24,693,854 1,724,184 22,969,670 58 months from appropriation SubtotalâState fundingÂ§ $160,432,587 $106,587,922 $59,533,353 $49,054,568 LOCALll ll General Fund $86,864,918 â Clean SDâOvertime for Police Department 7,897,992 â Contracts & Services 59,675,602 â HSSDâEnergy and Utilities 738,408 â Fringe Benefits 1,523,060 â Homeless Outreach Team (HOT) 10,563,890 â HSSDâInformation Technology 174,610 â General ServicesâMaintenance ExpensesâShelters 394,269 â HSSDâOther Expenses 13,271 â Personnel Costs 3,067,505 â Parks & RecâShigellosis Remediation 1,208,373 â HSSDâSupplies 1,550,605 â Parks & RecâTemporary ShelterâGH Relocation 57,333 â Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund 786,031 â SubtotalâLocal fundingÂ§ $87,650,949 â TOTAL $189,966,790 $136,122,125 $218,223,932 $52,198,803\n\nSource:âSanÂ Diego's approved budgets, grant awards, and financial management systems information.\n\n*âCity was awarded some of the funds before or after our audit period.\n\nâ âAmount received may be larger than award amount due to interest income.

This limitation is in part because their city departments budget for and track homelessness funding in a variety of ways. For example, some departments receive a budget for homelessness services and track that spending so it is clearly distinguishable. However, other departments commingle in a single fund their budget for addressing homelessness with funding for other purposes, such as the BeautifySJ program. In these instances, the cities cannot distinguish the amounts intended for addressing homelessness. Although these types of challenges primarily involve local funding, cities can also use some state and federal funding sources for more than just homelessnessârelated efforts. If cities do not carefully track their usage of these funds for homelessnessâspecific expenditures, it may impede their ability to identify all of their homelessnessârelated spending.\n\nTo inform decisionâmakers and provide transparency, the cities should track and report in a single location all funding they receive and use to reduce homelessness. Tracking this funding will require the cities to create and document a methodology for identifying from their financial systems the amounts of homelessness funding they have received, budgeted, and spent. As part of this process, the cities should develop a spending plan for their homelessness funding that identifies the available funding and how they intend to allocate that funding. For example, the cities could identify the amounts of funding they have available from federal, state, and local sources each year and indicate the amounts of that funding they plan to allocate to specific homelessnessârelated activities, such as developing permanent supportive housing or conducting outreach. The cities should then report on their spending at the end of each year. SanÂ Diegoâs independent budget analystâs office acknowledged that the city needs such a plan when it wrote, âHaving a clear, publicly available spending plan enables the Council and the public to monitor program expenses, ensure that existing funds are being maximized, and provides transparency regarding the cityâs efforts to addressÂ homelessness.â\n\nSanÂ JosÃ© Did Not Develop a CityâSpecific Plan for Addressing Homelessness Until JanuaryÂ 2024\n\nCareful planning is critical to ensuring that a cityâs efforts to address the complex problem of homelessness are effective. As we discuss in the previous section, the cities should develop spending plans to ensure that they maximize their funds and to provide transparency regarding their efforts to address homelessness. However, in addition to spending plans, the cities should also develop action plans with cityâspecific goals that identify the actions they will take to address homelessness. This type of plan enables a city to track its progress and evaluate the effectiveness of the actions it takes to achieve its goals.\n\nThe County Planâs Five Goals for 2025:\n\nAchieve a 30 percent reduction in annual inflow of people becoming homeless.\n\nHouse 20,000 people through the supportive housing system.\n\nExpand the Homelessness Prevention System and other early interventions to serve 2,500 people perÂ year.\n\nDouble interim housing and shelter capacity to reduce the number of people sleeping outside.\n\nAddress the racial inequities present among unhoused people and families and track progress toward reducing disparities.\n\nSource: County plan 2020â2025.\n\nSanÂ JosÃ© has historically relied on the countyâlevel community action plan (county plan) to guide its efforts to address homelessness. A committee led by the SantaÂ Clara County CoC developed the 2020â2025 county plan. The director of SanÂ JosÃ©âs housing department was a member of the county planâs steering committee, and SanÂ JosÃ© had two additional members involved in the county planâs workgroup to gather community input. The text box lists the countyâs homelessnessârelated goals.\n\nAlthough we recognize the value of the county plan, we are concerned that the city council did not adopt a cityâspecific plan for implementing the county plan (implementation plan) until recently. As a consequence, SanÂ JosÃ© lacked the cityâspecific information necessary to assess and, if necessary, adjust its actions to ensure their effectiveness in meeting the specific needs of the cityâs residents who were experiencing homelessness. For example, in 2021 andÂ 2022, SanÂ JosÃ©âs housing department submitted memos to the city council regarding the cityâs spending priorities for its homelessness programs. However, those memos do not include forwardâlooking, measurable goals for the programs. Consequently, the city may not know if its spending and actions met itsÂ needs.\n\nIn addition, in the absence of a cityâspecific implementation plan, the city has not assessed the effectiveness of its actions in achieving the countyâs larger goals. Although the city included programâspecific targets in some grant agreements with service providers, it did not identify or report on how these targets helped or would help it achieve the county planâs larger goals. For example, in fiscal year 2022â23, SanÂ JosÃ©âs housing department approved spending $8Â million in MeasureÂ E funds on the cityâs homelessness prevention system. The cityâs 2022â23 amendment to the agreement with a nonprofit for that system specifies that the cityâs target was to assist 900Â people in staying housed and prevent them from entering homelessness. However, it is unclear how this target specifically fits within the county planâs goal to achieve a 30Â percent reduction in the annual inflow of people becoming homeless because the target does not specify the total number of people the city needs to prevent from entering homelessness to help achieve the 30Â percent reduction. The city auditor reached a similar conclusion in a 2023Â audit, reporting that the cityâs homelessness and housing measures lacked context that would relate them to the broader goals of the county plan.\n\nCity staff explained that SanÂ JosÃ© did not develop a cityâspecific implementation plan for the county plan until recently because the city was focusing its efforts on responding to the COVIDâ19 pandemic. However, the city reported that it took many homelessnessârelated actions in those years. Having an implementation plan with clear goals would have helped the city to evaluate the effectiveness of its actions and measure its progress toward its goals.\n\nIn DecemberÂ 2023, after we began our review, the city presented an implementation plan to its housing commission. In JanuaryÂ 2024, the city council approved that plan. The new implementation plan establishes a direct tie with the county plan, creates accountability by linking the cityâs actions to specific departments, and includes measureable outcomes for the city to report publicly on an annual basis. By establishing accountability and transparency, the implementation plan should better situate the city to evaluate the effectiveness of its future actions to addressÂ homelessness.\n\nIn 2019 SanÂ Diego Established a CityâSpecific Plan That Includes Clear, Measurable Goals\n\nTo reduce and prevent homelessness, SanÂ Diego has followed a cityâspecific community action plan (city action plan) sinceÂ 2019. The Corporation of Supportive Housing (CSH)âa national nonprofit organization focused on homelessness and housingâauthored this plan in partnership with a steering committee consisting of the city, the housing commission, and the Regional Task Force. The plan identifies the need to set targeted goals and implement a systemwide strategic approach to achieve those goals. It also includes analyses of multiple data sources, including demographic characteristics of people experiencing homelessness, current shelter capacity, permanent housing units, and available financial resources forÂ homelessness.\n\nThe Five Strategies in SanÂ Diegoâs Action Plan:\n\nImplement a systemsâlevel approach to homelessÂ planning.\n\nCreate a clientâcentered homeless assistance system.\n\nDecrease inflow into homelessness by increasing prevention and diversion.\n\nImprove the performance of the existing system.\n\nIncrease the production of and access to permanentÂ solutions.\n\nSource: The housing commission.\n\nThe city action plan identifies fiveÂ distinct strategies for addressing homelessness, which the text box presents. Each strategy identifies specific target priorities. For example, to increase the production of and access to permanent housing, the plan prioritizes planning for the development of 3,500Â units of permanent supportive housing over 10Â years. For each of these longerâterm priorities, the city identifies related actions, including the need to establish annual development targets, create a funding pipeline, implement policy changes, and work with partners to coordinate the implementation of thoseÂ changes.\n\nThe plan also includes clear goals to allow SanÂ Diego to track its progress and evaluate the effectiveness of its actions. The housing commission maintains public dashboards on the cityâs progress toward some of its strategic goals. The public dashboards display updates on goals within reach in the next threeÂ years, performance data related to the implementation of the strategic goals, and progress toward housing goals. For example, to measure its progress of ending veteran homelessness, SanÂ Diego used Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) voucher utilization rates, among other metrics. SanÂ Diegoâs dashboard data showed that in each year sinceÂ 2019, SanÂ Diego has issued more of the VASH rental assistance vouchers it received from HUD to veterans experiencing homelessness, increasing its utilization rate from 86Â percent inÂ 2019 to 93Â percent inÂ 2022. TableÂ 3 describes SanÂ Diegoâs progress toward achieving selected goals sinceÂ 2019.\n\nTable 3\n\nSanÂ Diego Tracks the Progress Toward Some of Its Homelessness Strategic Goals\n\nLONG TERM STRATEGIC GOALS PROGRESS TOWARD GOALS Increase the outflow by increasing the production of permanent solutions Develop pipeline plan for 3,500 units of permanent supportive housing (PSH) over 10Â years, including 2,802Â units of supportive housing developed and 701Â supportive housing units leased in private rental market.

As of August 2023, there were 1,207 unsheltered people in downtown SanÂ Diego, which is an increase of 437 people compared to the same month in 2019.

InÂ 2023 CSH used newly available data, trends, and resources to update the city action planâs housing and prevention goals, as well as its financial modeling estimates of required funding to meet those goals. For example, it increased the shelter goal from 390â580Â beds to 465â920Â beds. The updated plan shows that the number of individuals entering homelessness has increased sinceÂ 2019, when the city adopted the plan and determined the need for more homelessness prevention actions. Because SanÂ Diego recently updated its action plan goals in fallÂ 2023, it is too early to evaluate its progress toward meeting the new goals.\n\nNeither SanÂ JosÃ© nor SanÂ Diego HasÂ Consistently Evaluated the Effectiveness of Its HomelessnessÂ Programs\n\nKey Points\n\nSanÂ JosÃ© and SanÂ Diego spend millions of dollars annually on services to address homelessness that are provided through agreements with external providers, such as nonprofits. However, the cities have not consistently monitored and evaluated the performances of their providers to ensure that these agreements represent effective uses of funds.\n\nPeople experiencing unsheltered homelessness face significant health and safety risks, increasing the importance of providing them with effective services. Both SanÂ JosÃ© and SanÂ Diego have established programs to mitigate the risks that these individuals face. However, neither SanÂ JosÃ© nor SanÂ Diego has measured the effectiveness of all of its programs to address the risks of unsheltered homelessness.\n\nSeveral federal and state laws and regulations may impede citiesâ ability to accurately evaluate and track certain information about people experiencing homelessness. Both SanÂ JosÃ© and SanÂ Diego believe that increased access to such data would allow them to better evaluate the services they provide and identify those programs that are mostÂ effective.\n\nSanÂ JosÃ© and SanÂ Diego Have Not Consistently Assessed the Effectiveness of Their Agreements With Service Providers\n\nBoth SanÂ JosÃ© and SanÂ Diego spend tens of millions of dollars on efforts to reduce homelessness through agreements with external service providers, such as nonprofits. Consequently, the citiesâ management of those agreements is especially crucial for establishing accountability and ensuring the effectiveness of their homelessness spending. Nonetheless, the citiesâ agreements with external service providers have not always included performance benchmarks to allow the cities to assess the results of the service providersâ efforts. Moreover, our review found that the two cities did not always establish wellâdefined measures for assessing the performance of their providers or ensure that the providers submitted complete performance reporting.\n\nFor each city, we reviewed 14 agreements for services such as rapid rehousing, encampment outreach, shelter, and homelessness prevention. Relying on the listings of homelessnessârelated agreements the cities provided to us, we selected agreements for review based on their amounts, funding source, and program type. EightÂ of the 14Â agreements for each city included funding from state and federal sources. The remaining six agreements primarily involved funding from local sources, including Measure E funds for SanÂ JosÃ©. We evaluated each cityâs agreements for defined performance measures and provider reporting requirements, and we considered each cityâs assessments of provider services and its documentation of those assessments .\n\nWellâdefined performance measures establish clear expectations for providers. For example, an effective performance measure might specify a number of people to be served per agreement activity. Nonetheless, as TableÂ 4 shows, SanÂ JosÃ© either did not establish or did not clearly define its expected performance measures in the 14Â agreements we reviewed. For example, in a $12Â million agreement for emergency rental assistance, SanÂ JosÃ© established as a performance measure that 80Â percent of program households that the provider surveyed would report improved housing stability after receiving assistance and services. However, the agreement neither specifies the number of households the provider should survey, nor did the provider disclose in its resulting report the number of households it surveyed. We believe that such specificity would provide the context for the surveyâs results and help ensure that those results are an accurate representation of the services provided. The city explained that it recognizes its agreements do not include clearly defined performance measures and that it has been working with an external consultant to improve its monitoring and compliance processes.\n\nTable 4\n\nSan Jose Did Not Always Clearly Define Performance Measures or Ensure It Received Performance Reporting in the Service Provider Agreements We Reviewed\n\nVENDOR /\n\nAGREEMENT NUMBER /\n\nFISCAL YEAR AGREEMENT AMOUNT FUNDING SOURCE(S) SERVICES PERFORMANCE MEASURES CLEARLY DEFINED?

In SanÂ Diego, the housing commission managed 11Â of the 14Â agreements, although the city provided oversight of that management. Nonetheless, the city indicated that it did not generally require that the housing commission set specific targets or goals for the performance measures in those agreements the commission managed, unless the funding source mandated establishing such targets. For example, in a $1.6Â million agreement for interim housing and supportive services, the housing commission did not specify how many people the provider should serve or set a target for shelter occupancy. Housing commission staff explained that attaching goals to certain metrics can create unintended adverse behaviors from service providers to meet those goals, which is why some previous performance metrics have moved to reporting only.\n\nTable 5\n\nSan Diego Did Not Always Clearly Define Performance Measures or Ensure It Received Complete Performance Reporting in the Service Provider Agreements We Reviewed\n\nVENDOR /\n\nAGREEMENT NUMBER /\n\nFISCAL YEAR AGREEMENT AMOUNT FUNDING SOURCE(S) SERVICES PERFORMANCE MEASURES CLEARLY DEFINED?

For example, the city entered into a $415,000 agreement for outreach and engagement services but only required the service provider to report on data on referrals to services and exits to permanent housing; the city did not specify any targets or goals for the performance measures. SanÂ Diego received the report from the provider, but it was incomplete because it did not include exits to permanent housing. However, without consistently defining measurable expectations for service providers, both the city and the housing commission risk those providersâ using city dollars ineffectively and ultimately not reducing homelessness.\n\nAside from not consistently establishing clearly defined performance measures in the agreements they entered into, the cities also did not always ensure that they received required data on provider performance. The agreements required providers to submit reports that present data on the activities they performed and the outcomes of their efforts. For example, SanÂ JosÃ©âs housing departmentâs agreements specify that service providers must submit quarterly performance reports through an online system that the city uses to manage grants (grants system). However, we found that the grants system was incomplete and consequently, upon our request, staff had to search elsewhere for the reporting associated with some of the agreements we reviewed. Similarly, SanÂ Diego did not receive all the necessary reporting for four of the 14Â agreements we reviewed. For example, the reporting it received for oneÂ agreement for outreach services worth about $3.5Â million was incomplete because it lacked a required assessment by the provider of the services in question. Without complete and clear reporting of such data, the citiesâ ability to determine the effectiveness of the services they purchased is limited.\n\nMoreover, we found that when the cities did receive provider performance data, the citiesâ assessments were confusing at times. For example, in one assessment that SanÂ JosÃ© performed of a $2Â million amendment to an agreement for rapid rehousing services, city staff assessed a providerâs performance as âadequate.â However, the city staffâs description in the assessment of the providerâs performance indicated that the provider had failed to meet nearly all activity goals for the year. While the provider did not meet the contract performance targets, the city believes the performance was adequate given difficult circumstances related to moving people from an encampment into housing and agreed that it could have better documented why its assessment of the performance was adequate.\n\nWe identified similar problems with SanÂ Diegoâs performance assessments. The housing commission explained that it uses its monthly data collection tools to compare results of a program to the contracted benchmarks and that it bases these contracted benchmarks on its CoC's community standards and other best practice information. When we reviewed a data collection tool for an interim housing and supportive services contract, we saw that the service provider was consistently not meeting the stated benchmark of 26Â percent exits to permanent housing. In fact, the percentage of exits to permanent housing was 6Â percent during the term of the agreement. Given that the provider was falling significantly short of meeting this benchmark, we would have expected the housing commission to analyze the provider's performance to determine whether the agreement was effective. However, the data collection tool did not include such an analysis from the commission.\n\nAlthough both cities asserted that they monitored or reviewed the performance of their service providers, their staff did not always document overall conclusions about the effectiveness of the service providersâ efforts. OneÂ reason for this gap is that the citiesâ procedures do not require staff to formally document such assessments. These types of assessments are crucial for ensuring accountability and the reduction and prevention of homelessness. SanÂ JosÃ© acknowledged that its agreement management procedures are outdated, and it stated that it is in the process of updating its guidelines to include more direction on how to assess an agreement for effectiveness and how to document that assessment. According to the housing commission, the agreements in which we identified shortcomings were for new programs that had standards that changed or had not yet been developed or the nature of the agreement did not warrant certain performance metrics. The housing commission provided documentation of its efforts to ensure compliance with agreement requirements, such as reviewing samples of program files to assess areas in which providers are performing well or may require additional technical assistance. However, it agreed that it could better document its assessments of the onâgoing performance of these agreements. Sometimes circumstances exist that are beyond the contractor's control that may impact program performance, such as the COVIDâ19 pandemic and housing shortages.\n\nWithout such analyses, it is unclear how the cities and the housing commission decide to renew agreements. The weaknesses we note above have limited the information available to the cities when making such decisions. For example, in fiscal year 2022â23, SanÂ JosÃ© funded an agreement for homelessness prevention services with $8Â million from MeasureÂ E. The service provider reported having vastly exceeded expectations on most requirements, stating that it had provided financial assistance payments to more than 1,200Â households in a threeâmonth period when the goal was onlyÂ 215. Moreover, at the end of the agreement term, the provider reported providing a total of nearly 4,000Â financial assistance payments, when the goal was onlyÂ 860. When we asked city staff to explain how the service provider could have achieved such results within the agreementâs budget constraints, they were initially unable to do so. However, after talking with the service provider, the city conveyed to us the service providerâs explanation that it had reported its total number of financial assistance transactions, rather than the number of unduplicated households it helped.\n\nWhen we reviewed the updated version of the service providerâs results, we found that the provider actually did not meet the goal for the agreement term. In fact, it reported making only 789Â payments during the agreement term. SanÂ JosÃ© had not noticed or investigated the original inflated results in its assessments of the providerâs performance. Nevertheless, the city negotiated an extension to the agreement with the service provider for fiscal year 2023â24 without having accurate performance data.\n\nAgreements with service providers are critical to citiesâ efforts to reduce and prevent homelessness. When the cities either do not establish clear objectives in those agreements or do not monitor providersâ performance in achieving objectives, they risk failing to meet the needs of their residents who are experiencing homelessness.\n\nNeither SanÂ JosÃ© nor SanÂ Diego Has Measured the Effects of All Its Efforts to Mitigate the Health and Safety Risks of Unsheltered Homelessness\n\nPeople experiencing unsheltered homelessness face significant health and safety risks, particularly if they live in encampments. SanÂ JosÃ© has established some programs to mitigate these health and safety risks. However, it has not measured the effectiveness of those programs. SanÂ Diego has allocated resources to programs related to public health and safety and has provided services to mitigate health and safety risks for people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. Nonetheless, SanÂ Diego did not always measure the effectiveness of its programs. The citiesâ lack of clear performance measures leaves them unable to assess whether their health and safety actions have effectively addressed the profound risks that individuals living in encampments face.\n\nBecause the cities have not consistently developed performance measures to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs, we reviewed the data that the cities have collected on program outcomes and on the frequency with which programs have contacted individuals experiencing unsheltered homelessness. Both cities have set some expectations related to frequency and do collect some data, however, they do not use performance measures, such as reductions in the frequency of public healthârelated complaints, to evaluate effectiveness.\n\nAlthough SanÂ JosÃ© Took Actions to Address Health and Safety at Encampments, It Did Not Always Assess the Effectiveness of Those Actions\n\nBeginning during the COVIDâ19 pandemic, SanÂ JosÃ© significantly increased its spending on programs related to the health and safety of people living in encampments and in residences in the surrounding communities. From fiscal years 2020â21 throughÂ 2022â23, SanÂ JosÃ© budgeted a combination of federal, state, and local city funding for encampment siteâspecific services and programs related to the health and safety of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness, as TableÂ 6 shows. Its annual budgeted funding for these purposes increased from $12.7Â million in fiscal year 2020â21 to $19Â million in fiscal year 2022â23.\n\nTable 6\n\nSanÂ JosÃ© Increased Its Budgeted Funding for Health and Safety Programs From Fiscal Years 2020â21 Through 2022â23\n\nFISCAL YEAR PROGRAM AND DEPARTMENT REPORTED OUTCOMES FUNDING SOURCE 2020â21 2021â22 2022â23 Parks Recreation and Neighborhood Services Department BeautifySJ program:\n\nProvides encampment sanitary services, such as regular trash pickâups, and abatements.

Specifically, encampment management best practices indicate that local governments should provide access to safe places to sleep and should provide public health services.Encampment Principles and Best Practices, National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty. In addition, the U.S.Â Interagency Council on Homelessness published principles for addressing encampments that specify that communities should keep encampments away from areas that are unsafe. In alignment with these principles, SanÂ JosÃ© designed its policy to minimize abatements and support people experiencing unsheltered homelessness where they are unless that location presents risk factors, such as reoccurring unsanitary conditions or potential for fire.\n\nNonetheless, San JosÃ© has not adequately evaluated its efforts to mitigate health and safety issues related to encampments. Although the city has set some expectations related to the frequency of the services it provides, it has not developed performance measures to evaluate how well its programs are mitigating health and safety risks. As a result, it is difficult to assess whether its programs are effective.\n\nFor example, SanÂ JosÃ© reported that it took steps during the pandemic to mitigate public health risks at encampments by providing some encampment siteâspecific services, including an enhanced weekly encampment trash program and escalated cleanups and abatements through programs such as BeautifySJ and Services, Outreach, Assistance, and Resources. Under BeautifySJ, the city committed to performing trash pickups on a weekly basis at encampments. The cityâs service data indicate that it completed about 33,600Â service visits at about 250Â encampments from 2020 throughÂ 2023. These visits included about 22,100Â regular trash service visits, about 640Â biowaste cleanups, and about 590Â abatements.\n\nAlthough the city tracks its visits to encampments, our review of its data and reporting did not identify information demonstrating the effectiveness of its encampment services at mitigating health risks, such as a reduction in the number of public health incidents occurring at encampments. SanÂ JosÃ© asserted that it was planning to hire a consultant to develop performance measures for BeautifySJ. The use of performance measures would better allow the city to evaluate whether it is achieving its goal of improving quality of life for unsheltered individuals and of creating healthy neighborhoods for all its residents.\n\nIn addition to its programs focused on mitigating health risks, SanÂ JosÃ© funded twoÂ programs from fiscal years 2020â21 through 2022â23 that provide safety to people experiencing unsheltered homelessness: the Safe Parking program (Safe Parking) and the Overnight Warming Locations program (Warming Locations). As Table 6 describes, Safe Parking involves the city designating parking lots that have overnight security in which individuals can safely sleep in their recreational vehicles (such as motorhomes or trailers), while Warming Locations involves the cityâs opening locations with security on city property for unsheltered individuals during the cold weather months.\n\nSanÂ JosÃ©âs implementation of both of these programs has addressed the safety of a small subset of the people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. For example, SanÂ JosÃ© reported providing Safe Parking at twoÂ cityâowned sites for people who sleep in their recreational vehicles. It stated that the program temporarily served about 162Â individuals during fiscal year 2020â21. However, city staff explained that the city did not renew the agreement with this service provider after it expired in JuneÂ 2021 because the city had changed how it wished to serve people residing in vehicles. The city did not open a new safe parking location until recently, in JulyÂ 2023. This new location currently can serve about 42 recreational vehicles on a daily basis, which is far fewer than the 700 recreational vehicles in which the city estimates people are living.\n\nIn addition, in JuneÂ 2022, SanÂ JosÃ© approved funding for a Safe Parking program for people who sleep in their cars. However, according to city staff, it did not open this location because a site for safe parking could not be identified by the city. Without a sufficient number of safe parking sites, the city increases the safety risks, such as physical or emotional threats, that people who sleep in their vehicles may face.\n\nMoreover, the city was unable to follow through with its plans to abate one of two large encampments by its airport. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandated that for safety reasons, SanÂ JosÃ© must abate an encampment at Guadalupe Gardens because the park is in the airportâs flight path. In OctoberÂ 2022, SanÂ JosÃ© reported to the FAA that it successfully had done so. The city also planned to abate an encampment at Columbus Park, which is adjacent to Guadalupe Gardens, by NovemberÂ 2022. However, it now does not expect to complete this abatement until the end ofÂ 2024 at the earliest. The city indicated that not everyone in the encampment was able to relocate to Safe Parking sites because some did not qualify for the program for reasons including not being able to provide proof of vehicle ownership. Accordingly, the city indicated that Columbus Park has continued to serve as an encampment for more than a dozenÂ vehicles.\n\nAlthough city staff stated that SanÂ JosÃ© Police Department officers accompany the BeautifySJ team during abatements on an onâdemand basis, the city does not have specialized police units dedicated to the concerns of individuals experiencing unsheltered homelessness. InÂ 2018 the SanÂ JosÃ© Police Department received a grant to start a new programâthe Mobile Crises Assessment Teamâthat sends a team of dedicated officers and county behavioral health clinicians to respond immediately to community members experiencing mental health crises. The police department asserted that this program is intended to serve both people who are experiencing unsheltered homelessness and those who are living in residences. However, police department staff explained that the program primarily serves people in residences. In contrast, SanÂ Diego has police units dedicated to working with and providing outreach to people experiencing unsheltered homelessness, as we discuss in the section that follows.\n\nSanÂ JosÃ© also has not established a consistent and formalized process for working with the county health department at encampments. In its fiscal year 2020â21 annual report to a city council committee, the city described its joint efforts with the county health department during the COVIDâ19 pandemic, which included providing vaccines to people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. However, the city staff indicated that the city does not have a contract with the county health department to establish each partyâs roles and responsibilities for mitigating public health risks.\n\nAccording to the city staff, SanÂ JosÃ© relies primarily on its outreach contractors to report to the county public healthârelated risks at encampments. In addition, the city explained that it collaborates with the county to address health concerns such as outbreaks. However, SanÂ JosÃ©âs lack of an established process for working with the countyâs health department to identify and mitigate public health risks at encampments could cause delays in the cityâs response to public health emergencies in the future. The city agreed that it could strengthen or formalize its collaboration with the county on significant public health concerns.\n\nAlthough SanÂ Diego Has Taken Actions to Address Health and Safety at Encampments, It Does Not Measure the Effectiveness of All Its Programs\n\nSanÂ Diegoâs total budgeted funding for public health and safety related to unsheltered homelessness has increased over the last threeÂ fiscal years, as TableÂ 7 shows. From fiscal years 2020â21 through 2022â23, SanÂ Diego increased its budgeted funding for programs that help ensure the health and safety of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness and living in residences in the communities surrounding encampments. Over this period, the cityâs total budgeted funding for these programs grew from $32Â million to $43Â million.\n\nTable 7\n\nSanÂ Diego Increased Its Budgeted Funding for Health and Safety Programs From Fiscal Years 2020â21 Through 2022â23\n\nFISCAL YEAR PROGRAM AND DEPARTMENT REPORTED OUTCOMES FUNDING SOURCE 2020â21 2021â22 2022â23 Environmental Services Department Clean SD program:\n\nConducts litter pickup, addresses instances of illegal dumping, sanitizes sidewalks, conducts curbside community clean ups, and implements abatements.

For example, the Neighborhood Policing Division (NPD) in the SanÂ Diego Police Department provides homelessness outreach and proactive enforcement services for the safety of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness and residents in the surrounding community, as Table 7 shows. City staff explained that NPD collects general data on a daily basis, including the number of people its Homeless Outreach Team reached, assisted, or placed into housing. NPD staff provided data from 2020 throughÂ 2022 that indicate that the NPD Homeless Outreach Team officers reached about 18,000 to 23,000Â people per year and placed about 850Â to 2,300Â people per year into a shelter. However, city staff indicated that these data are not unduplicated and that NPD does not have measures to evaluate the effectiveness of its actions and has identified other potential measures such as the number of individuals directed to mental health services and response times to complaints from residents.\n\nAlthough the city collects data about program actions, SanÂ Diego also has not measured the effectiveness of some of its programs that focus on health. For example, as part of its Clean SD program, SanÂ Diego identified actionsâ such as sanitizing sidewalks and addressing illegal dumpingâthat mitigate health risks to the public, including people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. For example, Clean SD has crews that clean up waste and litter on a daily basis from areas near encampments that pose a public health or environmental concern. Clean SD staff provided data that indicate that from fiscal years 2020â21 through 2022â23, the program annually abated from 1,200Â to 2,300Â encampments, sanitized sidewalks by cleaning about 6,600Â to 8,500Â blocks to reduce the potential presence of bacteria and communicable diseases, and addressed from 5,000Â to 7,000Â encampmentârelated complaints from the public.\n\nAlthough the city tracked these data and set some expectations around the frequency with which Clean SD would provide services, it did not develop performance measures for evaluating the programâs effectiveness, such as a reduction in public health incidents arising from encampments. City staff explained that the city did not develop such measures because Clean SD has always been a collaboration among different city departments and lacked a central manager. According to the city staff, the city did not make Clean SD into a separate division within its Environmental Services Department until fiscal year 2023â24. City staff explained that the city is working with the new divisionâs management to develop performance measures that it can use to evaluate the programâs impact.\n\nSanÂ Diego has measured the number of people served by some cityâfunded programs designed to ensure the health and safety of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. For example, from fiscal years 2020â21 through 2022â23, the city and the housing commission administered programs through agreements with service providers to meet the immediate health and safety needs of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness, including programs that provided safe parking and safe sleeping. The city reported that it has four safe parking locations for recreational vehicles and cars with a total of 233Â parking spots, and its website indicates that it has two safe sleeping locations that can serve 533Â tents. The city reported that its safe parking program served more than 3,000Â people in fiscal years 2020â21 through 2022â23, as Table 7 shows. In addition to the sites it already has, SanÂ Diego has identified options for more safe parking and safe sleeping locations to ensure individualsâ safety while the city searches for other shelter options.\n\nAs the result of a previous public health incident, SanÂ Diego has established formal collaboration with the county for its work on public health. Specifically, the city entered into a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with SanÂ Diego Countyâs Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) inÂ 2020 to clarify their contractual relationship related to public and environmental health services. The city and county took this action following a 2018Â SanÂ Diego County grand jury report that revealed that they did not coordinate their responses during a hepatitis A outbreak in the city among individuals who were experiencing unsheltered homelessness that resulted in 20 deaths.The SanÂ Diego Hepatitis A Epidemic: (Mis)Handling a Public Health Crisis, SanÂ Diego County grand jury, May 2018. The California State Auditorâs 2018 audit report included similar findings.SanÂ Diegoâs Hepatitis A Outbreak: By Acting More Quickly, the County and City of SanÂ Diego Might Have Reduced the Spread of the Disease, Report 2018â116, December 2018.\n\nThe current, collaborative process facilitates the city and the county working together to identify public health risks at encampments and address them in a timely manner. The public health and safety MOA clarifies the cityâs and countyâs roles and responsibilities in their coordinated response to public health matters. In OctoberÂ 2021, SanÂ Diego Countyâs HHSA reported an outbreak of shigellosisâan intestinal infectionâamong people experiencing homelessness in the city. In JanuaryÂ 2022, the city declared the outbreak resolved without any deaths. It credited this outcome to its work with the county, demonstrating the importance of having a coordinated response.\n\nThe Citiesâ Limited Access to HMIS Data May Impede Their Efforts to Evaluate Homelessness Programs\n\nFederal and State Laws and Regulations Limit the Data That Can Be Shared Without Consent\n\nFEDERAL\n\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act: Applies to health plans and certain health care providers. Some protected health information data may be disclosed without consent if the data will only be used for limited purposes.\n\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act: Applies to educational agencies or institutions that receive federal funding. Personally identifiable information from educational records can be disclosed without consent as long as it is used for purposes related to that personâs education.\n\nViolence Against Women Act: Applies to covered housing providers who serve victims of domestic or dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. The providers cannot share a victimâs information without consent of the victim.\n\nHMIS Standards: Client consent is required to share data but not to enter data into HMIS.\n\nSubstance Use Records: Some records can be disclosed without consent in case of medical emergency, research, or audit purposes. Consent form must outline exactly what can be disclosed; can be revoked at any time.\n\nSTATE\n\nConfidentiality of Medical Information Act: Individual must consent to disclosure of medical information by a health care plan or provider unless there is a court order, search warrant, death investigation, or need for diagnosis or treatment.\n\nInformation Privacy Act of 1977: Individual must consent to disclosure of personal information by a state agency unless there is a legal requirement or a medical necessity.\n\nJuvenile Case Records: Files may only be accessed by someone who is related to, works with, or represents the child.\n\nSource: Federal and state laws.\n\nSeveral federal and state laws and regulations may impede the ability of the State and local jurisdictions to accurately assess and track certain information about people who are experiencing homelessness. The text box lists some of these laws, which generally protect the confidentiality of personal information. The limitations to dataâsharing further emphasize the importance of the citiesâ monitoring the performance of their service providers to ensure the success of the programs they fund.\n\nThe main source of data about people experiencing homelessness is HMIS, for which the CoCs are responsible. HMIS is a local information technology system in which recipients and subrecipients of federal funding record and analyze client, service, and housing data for individuals and families at risk of or experiencing homelessness. CoCs must ensure compliance with the federal Privacy and Security Standards for HMIS. These standards allow certain uses of a personâs protected personal information (protected information), including for service provision and coordination, service payment and reimbursement, administrative functions such as audits, and removing duplicate data. Although the standards allow local governments to access data they enter into HMIS, they may not have access to personal information entered by other entities. CoCs use consent forms to allow them to use data provided by people who access homelessnessÂ services.\n\nBoth cities we reviewed indicated that they believe they would benefit from greater access to HMIS data. SanÂ JosÃ© has an agreement with SantaÂ Clara County to have full access to data that the city has entered into the countyâs HMIS. Through this agreement, SanÂ JosÃ© is required to participate in HMIS and must comply with HUD data standards when collecting data. The agreement also requires the city to comply with federal and state confidentiality laws and regulations.\n\nSanÂ JosÃ©âs deputy city manager for homelessness indicated that if the city fully utilized data available in HMIS, it would be able to understand and analyze the data better and make better decisions about its programs for preventing and ending homelessness, and that the city is working with the county to expand its access to HMIS to the City Managerâs Office, as well as other departments whose staff work directly with people experiencing homelessness. He further stated that having access to disaggregated data could enable the city to understand changes in the demographics of the population experiencing homelessness and adjust its approach to better suit their needs. He also stated that the city could track which programs are working and understand additional questions or areas to explore to understand why they are working.\n\nSanÂ Diego also believes that greater access to HMIS would be beneficial. The Regional Task Force operates the HMIS for the SanÂ Diego CoC. The city has a memorandum of understanding with the housing commission that states the housing commission and its contractors will enter data into HMIS. However, the director of SanÂ Diegoâs HSSD noted that the city does not have direct access to this HMIS data because of CoC restrictions. According to the director, SanÂ Diego has direct access to data only for projects it directly oversees, not data for projects run by other entities within the city.\n\nSanÂ Diego explained that its lack of citywide access to HMIS limits its ability to track the impacts of its projects in real time. Instead, the city can receive aggregated reports on its programs every twoÂ to threeÂ weeks. The city asserted that tracking its programs in real time would allow it to coordinate its services more effectively and maximize funding directed to positive outcomes.\n\nAlthough increased dataâsharing would likely have benefits, the State and cities must work within the state and federal laws and regulations that limit the sharing of protected information. Nevertheless, the California Interagency Council on Homelessness (Cal ICH)âthe state entity responsible for coordinating the Stateâs efforts to prevent and end homelessnessâhas begun to facilitate some dataâsharing by making available a dashboard with the anonymized aggregate data that it receives from each of the CoCs. The dashboard includes information such as the number of people accessing particular services. By creating this dashboard, Cal ICH has enabled CoCs to coordinate with cities and other local jurisdictions to analyze the data and compare the outcomes of similar programs without compromising personalÂ information.\n\nTo Better Address Homelessness, SanÂ JosÃ© and SanÂ Diego Will Need to Develop Additional Interim and Permanent Housing\n\nKey Points\n\nIn both SanÂ JosÃ© and SanÂ Diego, more than 85 percent of the placements for individuals experiencing unsheltered homelessness moved those individuals into interim, rather than permanent, housing. Although interim housing serves an important purpose, around 40Â percent of people exiting such placements returned to unsheltered homelessness.\n\nIn recent years, both SanÂ JosÃ© and SanÂ Diego have taken steps to develop additional interim housing sites. However, neither city currently has the capacity it requires.\n\nThe citiesâ efforts to address their lack of permanent housing have not produced enough of such housing to meet the needs of people experiencing homelessness. Although SanÂ JosÃ© has not set a target for the number of permanent supportive housing units it needs, SanÂ Diego has done so. Nevertheless, neither city has a clear, longâterm plan to develop and fund the permanent housing it needs.\n\nAlthough Interim Housing Provides Important Shelter, Most Placements of People Experiencing Unsheltered Homelessness in Interim Housing Do Not End Up in Permanent Housing\n\nTypes of Interim Housing\n\nEmergency Shelter: Any facility with the primary purpose of providing a temporary shelter for the homeless in general or for specific populations of the homeless and which does not require occupants to sign leases or occupancyÂ agreements.\n\nTransitional Housing: Housing that facilitates the movement of homeless individuals and families into permanent housing within 24 months or longer, as determined necessary.\n\nSafe Haven: Supportive housing that serves hardâtoâreach homeless persons with severe mental illness who came from the streets and have been unwilling or unable to participate in supportive services.\n\nSource: Federal regulations.\n\nThe final phase of homelessnessâexiting homelessnessâshould culminate in entering permanent housing, but most placements of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness are into interim housing. HUD defines the types of interim housing available for people experiencing homelessness, as the text box shows. We refer to these threeÂ types of housing collectively as interim housing. Interim housing does not involve a longâterm solution to an individualâs living situation and is considered sheltered homelessness. Nonetheless, interim housing is a critical service that protects people from many of the impacts of unsheltered homelessness, such as the health and safety risks we previously described. An interim housing facility may have multiple beds in a single shared space or may have a number of individual units, each of which has oneÂ or moreÂ beds.\n\nIn both SanÂ JosÃ© and SanÂ Diego, at least 85Â percent of placements for people experiencing unsheltered homelessness move people into interim housing, as FigureÂ 8 shows. These numbers align with the statistics we present in Report 2023-102.1. We used information in the state data system to identify placements moving unsheltered people into housing from JulyÂ 2019 through MarchÂ 2023. This data system has limitations in identifying the location of placements because a provider with multiple sites reports all placements at only the principal site. Additionally, the placements within a city are not necessarily the direct responsibility of that cityâs government.\n\nFigure 8\n\nMost Unsheltered Placements Were Into Interim Housing\n\nSource:âState data system.\n\nNote: Rounding of numbers may prevent percentages from totaling 100.\n\n* City location information in state data is imprecise because reported information may show the principal site of a shelter or housing provider but not show all locations. Additionally, placements within a city do not necessarily indicate that the city government was the entity responsible for those placements.\n\nâ Some placements of individuals showed that the person had not yet exited the program and was still enrolled and receiving shelter or housing services as of the date we obtained the data; therefore, the number of placements is higher than the number of those who exited the program.\n\nâ¡ Category Other can include the following: worker unable to determine, client doesnât know, client prefers not to answer, data not collected, or other.\n\nFigure 8 description:\n\nFigure 8 is composed of two separate horizontal tree diagrams, one for San Jose and one for San Diego, that depict the total placements in each city of individuals experiencing unsheltered homelessness into interim and/or permanent housing types from the fiscal year 2019-20 through March 2023. The San Jose horizontal tree diagram appears first in the figure, with the San Diego diagram appearing directly below it. Each tree diagram, when moving from left to right bifurcates into two main branches, one branch for interim housing placements and the other branch for permanent housing placements. Both of these branches then list and describe the percentages of people who were placed in their specific types of housing. Both the interim and permanent branches then continue to how many total individuals exited the interim or permanent housing placement or placements they received. Finally, the branches culminate in listing the types of destinations individuals could have exited to and the percentages of each exit destination. In the San Jose tree, for example, of the 8,880 placements that entered a type of interim housing, 8,041 placements exited. Of these 8,041 placement exits, 16% returned to experiencing unsheltered homelessness. In the San Diego tree, for example, the diagram depicts that of the 2,640 placements that entered a type of permanent housing, 1,468 placements exited. Of these 1,468 placement exits, 5% returned to experiencing unsheltered homelessness. The text at the bottom of the figure provides more context on the data presented in the tree diagram.\n\nPeople experiencing homelessness access interim housing in a variety of ways that involve multiple entities. In some places, people experiencing homelessness can access a shelter through a hotline established in their area. People can also access shelters by walking directly to them or through contact with outreach teams consisting of county, city, or service provider staff. As we explain in a later section, SanÂ Diego uses a centralized process that places people into shelters that best meet their needs. For SanÂ JosÃ©, the county has a hotline that connects people experiencing homelessness to shelters.\n\nIn contrast, HUD requires CoCs to develop and implement a coordinated entry system that CoC and Emergency Solutions Grant funded projects must use to connect people experiencing homelessness to permanent housing, as FigureÂ 9 shows. A coordinated entry system is a centralized process within a CoC that prioritizes people for permanent housing resources based on their level of need. For SanÂ Diego, the Regional Task Force operates the coordinated entry system, and for SanÂ JosÃ©, SantaÂ Clara County operates the coordinated entry system.\n\nFigure 9\n\nHUD Requires a Coordinated Entry System to Connect People With Permanent Housing\n\nSource:âFederal regulations, HUD, Regional Task Force, and Santa Clara County CoC.\n\nFigure 9 description:\n\nFigure 9 is a flow chart that depicts the coordinated entry system that HUD requires CoCs to use to connect people experiencing homelessness to permanent housing resources. The chart flows from left to right, and the first component of the chart shows how someone experiencing homelessness can enter the coordinated entry system through an access point, such as a hotline. Once a person has entered the system, their information is collected and assessed to determine the person's needs. Once a person's needs are identified, the person is prioritized according to those needs and placed into a queue for the next available housing resource. The last part of the flow chart describes that when a resource becomes available, the person experiencing homelessness is placed in the available permanent housing, such as permanent supportive housing. At the bottom of these four parts of the flow chart, there is a depiction of an individual experiencing homelessness navigating the coordinated entry system. The individual goes from experiencing unsheltered homelessness to being placed in permanent housing by the end of the process.\n\nHousing Placements From\n\nJuly 2019 to March 2023\n\nSan JosÃ©:\n\nNearly 10,500 total placements: nearly 9,000 into interim housing and more than 1,500 into permanent housing.\n\nSan Diego:\n\nNearly 24,000 total placements: more than 21,000 into interim housing and more than 2,600 into permanent housing.\n\nSource: State data system.\n\nIn the absence of available permanent housing, having adequate interim housing is critical to providing people experiencing homelessness with shelter. For example, SanÂ JosÃ© and SanÂ Diego each had a similar number of people experiencing homelessnessâ6,340Â people in SanÂ JosÃ© and 6,500Â in SanÂ Diego, according to the 2023Â PIT count. However, there were significantly more than twice as many placements in SanÂ Diego into interim and permanent housing than in SanÂ JosÃ©, as the text box shows. More people may have been placed in housing in SanÂ Diego in part because significantly more interim housing beds are located within it: 4,000, compared to SanÂ JosÃ©âsÂ 2,500.\n\nHowever, people experiencing unsheltered homelessness who were placed in interim housing had worse outcomes than those placed into permanent housing. As we explain in ReportÂ 2023â102.1, the data show that 84Â percent of exits statewide from permanent housing placements involved individuals reporting that they were moving into permanent housing, while only 13Â percent of exits statewide from interim housing placements involved individuals doing so.People can exit from permanent housing placements. At that time, they generally report their next living situation. For example, HUD defines shortâ or mediumâterm rapid rehousing services as a permanent housing placement. When individuals stop receiving rental assistance or supportive services, they exit that housing. Their next living situation could be another permanent housing location, such as an apartment they rent. Alternatively, it could be a return toÂ homelessness. TheÂ data also show that 44Â percent of the exits from interim housing placements involved individuals reporting that they were returning to homelessness, in comparison to only 4Â percent of the exits from permanent housing placements. Figure 8 shows roughly similar trends for SanÂ JosÃ© and SanÂ Diego.The reported destinations included an Other category that accounted for 35 percent of exits from interim housing placements in SanÂ JosÃ© and 37 percent of exits from interim housing in SanÂ Diego. This category includes the following types of exits: worker unable to determine, client doesn't know, client prefers not to answer, data not collected, or other.\n\nData provided by SanÂ JosÃ© suggest that certain types of interim housing, such as its bridge and emergency interim housing sites, are more effective at leading to permanent placements. We describe these types of interim housing in more detail in the next section. SanÂ JosÃ©âs data indicate that of the 984Â exits from certain bridge and emergency interim housing sites in fiscal years 2020â21 through 2022â23, 478Â exits moved individuals into permanent housing. However, the volume of these exits appear to make up a small portion of the total exits in the city: SanÂ JosÃ© had more than 8,000Â total exits from interim housing placements from fiscal year 2019â20 through March 2023, as Figure 8 shows.\n\nBecause thousands of people continue to experience unsheltered homelessness in both cities, greater capacity to place individuals into interim and permanent housing is needed for homelessness to be significantly reduced. SanÂ Diegoâs unsheltered population decreased from 2,600Â inÂ 2019 to just under 2,500 inÂ 2022 before increasing to nearly 3,300 inÂ 2023. SanÂ JosÃ©âs unsheltered population declined at a rate of nearly 3.5Â percent per year, from 5,100 inÂ 2019 to 4,400 inÂ 2023. The number of placements in both cities fluctuated up and down over these years.\n\nSanÂ JosÃ© and SanÂ Diego Have Established Additional Interim Housing Sites but Still Lack Needed Capacity\n\nAs we previously discuss, individuals who are placed in interim housing tend to have worse outcomes than those placed in permanent housing. Nonetheless, building permanent housing for people experiencing homelessness can take considerable time, making the provision of interim housing a critical step. Within SanÂ JosÃ©âs and SanÂ Diegoâs city limits, multiple entities may fund and operate interim housing sites, including nonprofits. However, the twoÂ cities also have established cityâfunded interim housing sites. SanÂ JosÃ© currently has nineÂ cityâfunded interim housing sites, while SanÂ Diego hasÂ 17. Both cities have plans to establish additional sites over the next several years to meet the needs of their unsheltered populations.\n\nSanÂ JosÃ© Has Not yet Reached Its Goals for Its Provision of Interim Housing\n\nTypes of Interim Housing SanÂ JosÃ© Uses\n\nBridge housing communities: Prefabricated modular units that provide interim housing and supportive services to single adults, couples, and/or families. These communities include individual beds/units and shared use of facilities, such as kitchens.\n\nEmergency interim housing: Prefabricated modular units created as an emergency response to the COVIDâ19 pandemic that provide interim housing and supportive services to single adults, couples, and/or families. This housing includes individual beds/units and shared use of facilities, such as kitchens.\n\nConverted hotels/motels: Primarily a part of the stateâfunded program Homekey, which provides funding for the conversion of underutilized hotels into interim housing.\n\nOvernight warming locations: Overnight shelters located on cityâowned properties during the winter season.\n\nSource: San Jose AB2176 Annual Reports to the Legislature, Housing Department website, and City Council memos.\n\nSanÂ JosÃ© has been working for several years to develop interim housing. InÂ 2019, before the start of the COVIDâ19 pandemic, SanÂ JosÃ© had only one cityâfunded interim housing site. To help address the immediate need to provide individuals experiencing homelessness with shelter and supportive services during the pandemic, the city rapidly increased the number of interim housing sites it had to nineÂ byÂ 2023. The text box describes the different types of interim housing that the city uses.\n\nVarious memos to and from the city council document SanÂ JosÃ©âs approach to developing interim housing. For example, in SeptemberÂ 2021, the mayor and city council members approved a memo recommending that city staff pursue several initiatives aimed at increasing interim housing capacity. The initiatives included exploring funding opportunities, adding more units to existing sites, and identifying sixÂ additional sites for council vote. The memo referenced the cityâs 2017Â goal to have at least oneÂ interim housing facility located in each city council district, and it established a goal to create 1,300Â interim housing units, which included 300Â Homekey units.\n\nAlthough it is making efforts, SanÂ JosÃ© has yet to meet these goals. The city explained that it uses an internal spreadsheet to track data related to interim housing unit counts. Using these data, San JosÃ© reported to us that it had interim housing facilities in fourÂ of its 10Â districts and had completed 589Â units. The city indicated that from the early stages of developing interim housing, adjacent neighborhoods have expressed opposition to almost every site. The city identified that opposition and limited available site options as barriers that have made achieving the goal of oneÂ interim housing site in each city council district difficult.\n\nSanÂ JosÃ© explained that after the city councilâs approval of the SeptemberÂ 2021 memo, it published on its website the Emergency Interim Housing Siting and Evaluation Guidelines and Process (interim siting guidelines) to assist the city in determining the locations of emergency interim housing units. According to staff, they use the interim siting guidelines to assess sites for their feasibility, viability, and practicality. The guidelines state that assessments should use criteria such as plot acreage, shape, gradation, city council district, and the potential for SanÂ JosÃ© to own or control the land. However, it is unclear when the guidelines became effective and to whom they apply because the city council has not formally adopted them.\n\nAs Figure 10 shows, San JosÃ© approved the development of fiveÂ sites (fourÂ additional sites and an expansion at oneÂ existing site) for interim housing as of OctoberÂ 2023, in addition to the nineÂ it had already completed. It identified that twoÂ new sites will involve converted motels or hotels, and twoÂ will be other types of interim housing facilities. The expansion is of an existing emergency interim housing facility. Of these fiveÂ facilities, oneÂ is located on land the city owns. After the completion of these housing projects, SanÂ JosÃ© will have 13Â interim housing facilities. The city stated that these facilities will have a total of more than 1,000Â interim housing units, bringing it closer to its goal of 1,300Â units. Nevertheless, fiveÂ council districts will still lack interim housing facilities. In addition, SanÂ JosÃ© identified seven potential additional sites that the council has approved for staff to consider.\n\nFigure 10\n\nSanÂ JosÃ© Has Identified Five Proposed Sites for Interim Housing\n\nSource:âAnalysis of SanÂ JosÃ©'s website and the city's confirmation of locations.\n\nNote: This map does not include overnight warming locations because the locations of these interim housing facilities change eachÂ year.\n\n* One of these sites in District 2 is a proposed expansion of an existing interim housing facility.\n\nFigure 10 description:\n\nFigure 10 is a map of the city of San Jose depicting the locations of the five proposed sites for interim housing for people experiencing homelessness that San Jose has identified. The map also shows the boundaries of each of San Jose's ten city council districts. In the map, there is one proposed site with an unknown number of units in district 6. In district 3, there is one proposed site with 72 units. In district two, there are two proposed sites with a combined total of 304 units. One of the sites in district 2 is a proposed expansion of an existing interim housing facility. Lastly, the map shows that there is one proposed site in district 10 with 75 units.\n\nWhen we attempted to evaluate the use of the cityâs interim housing beds, we found that SanÂ JosÃ© does not regularly monitor this information. Consequently, it lacks complete and accurate information to assess whether the usage of its existing interim housing units and beds is efficient and whether more beds and units are needed. A month after our request, the city provided utilization data from HMIS for sevenÂ of the nineÂ current interim housing sites. However, after doing so, the city noted problems with the dataâs accuracy. It explained that significant maintenance issues at oneÂ facility left multiple units unavailable for extended periods of time, for example. At another facility, the bed capacity was incorrectly listed in HMIS as less than half of its actual capacity, producing inaccurate utilization rates of more than 100Â percent in the database. Although we could not verify the data because of the aboveânoted issues, they show that the other fiveÂ interim housing facilities had utilization rates from 70Â percent to 100 percent by the end of fiscal year 2022â23.\n\nSanÂ Diego Has Taken Steps to Increase Its Interim Housing but Likely Does Not yet Have Adequate Shelter Capacity\n\nInterim Housing Structures in SanÂ Diego\n\nSprung structure: A tentâlike structure with multiple beds in a shared space.\n\nHotel/motel/apartment building: A repurposed building that provides individual units with one or more beds in each.\n\nBrick and mortar: A building with multiple beds in a sharedÂ space.\n\nSource: HSSD.\n\nIn SanÂ Diego, the cityâs HSSD and housing commission oversee a system of cityâfunded interim housing sites. HSSD is mainly responsible for developing new interim housing sites and administering funding for interim housing services and operations. The housing commission, through a memorandum of understanding with the city, is mainly responsible for overseeing the operations of those interim housing sites. The text box lists the types of interimÂ housing structures that the cityÂ uses.\n\nIn June 2023, San Diego developed a Comprehensive Shelter Strategy (shelter strategy) for expanding its interim housing capacity, but that strategy is missing important details on shelter options and funding. The strategy identifies possible sites for expanding and increasing the cityâs interim housing capacity. However, it does not establish locations, timelines, or budgets for some of the sites. When we asked about this missing information, HSSDâs director explained that the city may not necessarily build every site in the strategy. She explained that the department operates on a funding cycle of one fiscal year that is considered in decisions about which sites to pursue.\n\nAccording to the cityâs website as of March 2024, the city was operating 17Â interim housing sites that provided 1,856Â beds. According to our analysis, the shelter strategy at its release in JuneÂ 2023 proposed 10Â new interim housing sites that, if completed, would provide over 900Â additional interim housing beds. Data provided by the city show that as of SeptemberÂ 2023, it had completed fourÂ of these sites, for a total of 263Â additional beds. It is pursuing fourÂ additional proposed sites that, if completed, would provide at least 245Â beds. Of the four proposed sites, the city owns or controls twoÂ sites, the housing commission owns oneÂ site, and oneÂ site has an undisclosed location to protect the safety of the population itÂ serves.\n\nAs FigureÂ 11 shows, these proposed sites are clustered in just twoÂ council districts, with two of the threeÂ sites in downtown SanÂ Diego. When we asked why the cityâs interim housing facilities are concentrated in downtown, HSSD explained that the city has located interim hou"
