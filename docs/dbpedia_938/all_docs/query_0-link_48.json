        "text": "www.afm257.org Official Journal of the American Federation of <strong>Musicians</strong> AFM Local 257 • 1902-2007 Musician Volume MMVII • Number 2 • April-June 2007 Major By-Law revisions possible, May 30 The Local 257 General Membership Meeting, scheduled 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, May 30, promises to be one of the most important to varied members in recent times. On the agenda are proposals to increase and reformat the Miscellaneous Wage Scale list for Local 257; another to upgrade the Ballet & Opera Pit Scale to match the <strong>Nashville</strong> Symphony Orchestra negotiated scale; and an increase proposal to the Musical Theater/Broadway Show Scale; as follows, with appropriate recommendations by the Executive Board. In addition, Local 257 Secretary-Treasurer Billy Linneman plans discussions at the next General Membership Meeting on credit card costs and possible service fees; imposing of interest charges on late Delegate cites issues considered for a Convention vote in Vegas By LAURA ROSS Local 257 3rd Delegate In Mid-June of this year, June 18-20 to be exact, a contingent of your elected representatives will travel to Las Vegas to attend the AFM Convention. Secretary-Treasurer Billy Linneman, Bobby Ogdin, Bruce Bouton and myself are your elected voting delegates for Local 257. President Harold Bradley will attend in his capacity as Vice President of the AFM and Dave Pomeroy will also be in attendance as a non-voting representative of the Recording <strong>Musicians</strong> <strong>Association</strong>. While many proposals will be addressed at this convention, key legislation dealt with during these three days will focus on how our Federation is funded. Two years ago, I spoke on the Convention floor in favor of Emergency Resolution #1, which was an omnibus financial package that redirected some work dues changes and got rid of one particular fee that was of concern to many of our members – the Special Payments assessment. However, this was only a stop-gap measure. One of the provisions of this Emergency Resolution #1 stated: “In addition to the foregoing amendments to the By-Laws: a. The IEB shall establish a committee to prepare proposals for the 97th Convention to be held in 2007, to define the appropriate relationships among per capita, work dues, and other Federation revenue. The committee will hold its first meeting as soon as is reasonable after January 1, 2006, but no later than March 31, 2006. The committee will be provided with reasonable ac- work dues; and pin-pointing leader/contractor duties. The following proposals are being suggest by fellow union members to the Local 257 By-Laws: Proposal for format and rate increases to the <strong>Nashville</strong> <strong>Association</strong> of <strong>Musicians</strong> Miscellaneous and Steady Engagement Wage Scale and Price List. Whereas, The Miscellaneous and Steady Engagement Wage Scale and Price List for live engagements in Local 257 has overlapping scale designations that have made it difficult to read; and Whereas, It was felt that a reorganization and consolidation of the Price List would make it easier for all members and potential purchasers to read; and Whereas, Certain scales are considered out of date or unnecessary and re- cess to AFM financial records as may be necessary to develop these proposals in a collaborative manner.” I’m sorry to say that the committee took a lot longer to meet and begin deliberating about how these issues should be addressed. In fact there have only been two sets of meetings, one June 12 and 13, 2006, and the second with more committee members in attendance was held last month in <strong>Nashville</strong>, just prior to the IEB’s quarterly meeting. They have now scheduled an additional set of meetings to be held this month on April 16 and 17. From these meetings, I believe we should expect potential changes to all the ways we fund the AFM. I encourage all to read the May issue of the International Musician, which will contain all the resolutions submitted by Convention delegates (including a resolution from the Local 257 Executive Board that per capita dues be increased by $5 per year for two years), as well as the IEB recommendations. I am unsure at this time whether the above mentioned committee’s recommendation will be included in the International Musician. While our schedule is very full for the membership meeting scheduled for Wednesday evening, May 30, I know the Convention delegates also look forward to discussions with you about various proposals, general comments about the convention and the health of the AFM currently. I encourage you all to attend the general membership meeting in May. Come talk to us about your concerns. quire updating; therefore, be it Resolved, That the entire Price List be reorganized (as printed below); and be it further Resolved, That included in that reorganization, the following scale changes also be included: (1) Banquets, Receptions, Conventions, Weddings, Strolling, Mercantile Openings and Fashion Shows; (2) Dances and (3) Staged Shows (up to 90 minutes) have been combined.
