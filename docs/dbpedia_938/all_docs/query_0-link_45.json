        "text": "Introduction: In 2015, with a stated goal of disseminating best teaching practices and developing a community of educational scholars, the Council of Emergency Medicine Directors (CORD) and the Clerkship Directors of Emergency Medicine (CDEM) created an annual Special Issue in Educational Research and Practice (Special Issue) in cooperation with the Western Journal of Emergency Medicine. The intention of this study was to analyze the impact of this effort to date. Methods: Bibliometric data was gathered on all four special issues, 2015-2019, from the Web of Science and then verified with the eScholarship website. Authorship, academic affiliation, date published, article type, and format were tabulated for descriptive analysis. Using metrics from Google Scholar, alternative scholarly impact metrics (altmetrics), and the eScholarship website, the authors identified top articles and grouped them into themes. Results: Of the 136 articles included in the first four years of the Special I...\n\nObjective: To review the available literature investigating effectiveness of flipped classroom (FC) in context to teaching of procedural skills in residency in various medical fields especially in dermatology. Study Design: Systematic review. Place and Duration of Study: Flipped classroom meeting out inclusion criteria published in 9 years from 2012 to 2020. Methodology: Flipped classroom meeting out inclusion criteria published in 9 years from 2012 to 2020 were reviewed by the authors and co-authors as per their feasibility and discussion done by video conferencing by mobile software apps. Results: To review of 25 full-text articles. Strategic organization of course material, wise choice of pre-class activities, usage of Virtual learning environment, class time utilization tailored to learners needs, adherence to timelines, proper training of staff and proper evaluation; are required for successful implementation of flipped classroom. Students had positive perceptions about this te...\n\nThe emergency medicine (EM) clerkship curriculum at Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center includes monthly lectures on pediatric fever and shortness of breath (SOB). This educational innovation evaluated if learning could be enhanced by &quot;priming&quot; the students with educational online videos prior to an in-class session. Factors that impacted completion rates were also evaluated (planned specialty and time given for video viewing). Twenty-minute videos were to be viewed prior to the didactic session. Students were assigned to either the fever or SOB group and received links to those respective videos. All participating students took a pre-test prior to viewing the online lectures. For analysis, test scores were placed into concordant groups (test results on fever questions in the group assigned the fever video and test results on SOB questions in the group assigned the SOB video) and discordant groups (crossover between video assigned and topi...\n\nIntroduction: Electrocardiogram (EKG) interpretation is integral to emergency medicine (EM).1 In 2003 Ginde et al. found 48% of emergency medicine (EM) residency directors supported creating a national EKG curriculum.2 No formal national curriculum exists, and it is unknown whether residents gain sufficient skill from clinical exposure alone. Methods: The authors sought to assess the value of this EKG curriculum, which provides exposure to critical EKG patterns, a framework for EKG interpretation when the diagnosis is not obvious, and implementation guidelines and open access to any interested residency. The Foundations of Emergency Medicine (FoEM) EKG I course launched in January 2016, followed by EKG II in July 2017; they are benchmarked to post-graduate year 1 (PGY) and PGY2 level learners, respectively. Selected topics included 15 published critical EKG diagnoses and 33 selected by the authors.5 Cases included presenting symptoms, EKGs, and Free Open Access Medical Education (FO..."
