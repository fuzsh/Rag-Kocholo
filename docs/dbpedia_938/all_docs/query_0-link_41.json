By WALT TROTT “I have been amazed to see the growth of the recording industry in <strong>Nashville</strong> from my first recording session in 1947,” proclaimed Harold R. Bradley, AFM International Vice President. “I’ve also been amazed at the changes the music business has had to endure since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 made it easy for fewer corporate conglomerates to own more and more radio stations.” Bradley bemoaned the resulting situation in a terse warning while addressing Federal Communications Commissioners in <strong>Nashville</strong>, Dec. 11. <strong>Nashville</strong> was the second of six cities the FCC has targeted in an outreach program to increase public awareness regarding media ownership, while seeking debate on potential rulings. Led by FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin, the commissioners and moderator Henry Rivera met with a diverse group at Belmont University, including Bradley and fellow recording artists George Jones and Porter Wagoner, both members of Opry icon Del Reeves, 74, succumbs By WALT TROTT Colorful Grand Ole Opry singersongwriter Del Reeves, 74, died Jan. 1, at his home in Centerville, Tenn., following a lengthy illness. In recent years, emphysema gave Reeves such breathing difficulties that he curtailed appearances on the Opry, and had to rely on portable oxygen tanks, due to “chronic pulmonary obstruction.” He also suffered from melanoma. Known best for his upbeat signature song “Girl On the Billboard,” which spent two weeks at #1 in May 1965, Reeves charted a total 55 Billboard singles over a 25-year stretch. Among Del’s other memorable Top 10’s were a mixture of honky tonk and trucker-oriented tunes like “Belles of Southern Bell,” “Looking At the World AFM <strong>Nashville</strong> Local 257 (for which Bradley is also president), and AFTRA. More than 400 people attended their session, which received prepared greetings from absent U.S. Senators Bill Frist and Lamar Alexander. The AFM’ers testified, along with such other panelists as contemporary acts Big & Rich (Kenny Alphin and John Rich), Cowboy Troy (Coleman, a self-described hick-hop performer), R&B veteran Dobie Gray, former recording star and TV host Naomi Judd, songwriters Craig Wiseman, Rick Carnes, broadcasters Sharon Kay, Bud Walters, Jenny Toomey and media professors Christopher Yoo and Luke Froeb. (A later panel that day included U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper (D-TN), daily Tennessean newspaper publisher Ellen Leifeld, Harvard University’s Alex Jones, broadcast executive Deborah McDermott and Consumer Union official Gene Kimmelman discussing the state of broadcast and print media.) Concluding his welcoming remarks, <strong>Nashville</strong> Mayor Bill Purcell mused, “Behind me (the panelists) would be every proof of why being Mayor of this city is easily the best job in the world . . . Thank you for the attention you’re bringing to an important issue and to our city, and thank you, quite honestly, for giving me that one additional opportunity, an unfulfilled dream that so many people have had, and that is to open for George Jones!” On a more serious note, Chairman Martin officially opened the hearing with a few choice comments and noted the commission would be receptive to remarks on other than music matters, such as internet-driving communications and Top showman Del Reeves. Through a Windshield,” “Women Do Funny Things To Me” and “Good Time Charlie’s.” Del also landed 17 titles on the Top 40 albums charts, his best efforts being “Del Reeves Sings Girl On the Billboard” (Continued on page 25) effects of the digital age on broadcast media, television included. The five-member FCC commission chaired by Republican Martin, consists of two fellow Republicans Robert McDowell and Deborah Taylor Tate, and Democratic appointees Jonathan S. Edelstein and Michael J. Copps. Since the last FCC review regarding ownership rules, increased broadband penetration has transformed the Internet into a viable platform for streaming fulllength video programming, plus prospects of creating nationwide networks that deliver live video to mobile phones. It’s a changing scene that requires the FCC’s full focus before implementing new rulings. Commissioner Copps stated, “Today’s hearing is the full Commission’s chance - the chance it didn’t take advantage of last time around - to hear from the people who live every day with the effects and consequences of media consolidation - you . . . Your experiences and perspectives are worth several bookshelves of legal submissions from Big Media’s lobbyists.” In 2003, under leadership of Michael Powell, the FCC issued new guidelines that sought to expand the number of media outlets a single company could own in a local market. The new rules were (Continued on page 2) Symphony hails a new conductor Kelly Corcoran was named Assistant Conductor for the <strong>Nashville</strong> Symphony Orchestra (NSO), on Jan. 12.
