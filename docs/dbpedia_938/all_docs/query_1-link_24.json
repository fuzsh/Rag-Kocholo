        "text": "Old Town San Diego is one of San Diego’s most popular destinations. It is conveniently located within walking distance of a major transit center that is close to most restaurants, hotels and shops in Old Town.\n\nOld Town San Diego has a quaint atmosphere, streets filled with the historic culture of the many traditions left behind. This historic area includes three major parks and sits next to the State Park with 32 historic sites, shops and the Presidio, the site of the first mission.\n\nCasa Guadalajara, the popular Old Town restaurant owned and operated by Diane Powers. Food: Casa Guadalajara provided a disappointing experience as my friend’s sister, who has a celery allergy, was assured by the server, Vanessa, 3 times that the poblano rice contained only spinach. However, after taking a few bites, she discovered celery pieces, resulting in a severe allergic reaction.\n\nGreat location in the middle of the marketplace with outdoor seating. Besides the great ambiance the service was excellent – I ordered the chicken mole enchiladas from the specials section and the chicken tortilla soup to warm me up on a chilly night. The soup really hit the spot and was nice and hardy with a lot of crispy tortilla strips on top. The dish also included rice and corn which was a full meal.\n\nOld Town is the location of the first European settlement in California. It is the oldest neighborhood in San Diego located in the heart of San Diego county with 10 hotels to choose from. Old Town is convenient to everything, located next to a major transit center with access to the train, trolley, busses and taxis. Stay in Old Town and you will be ready to experience San Diego and the adventure that is Old Town. Visit California’s first settlement."
