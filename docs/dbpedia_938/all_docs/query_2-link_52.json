Simply provide proof that you are a Veteran and you are eligible for 25% off ABC Title’s service fee. (Discount does not apply to fees payable to the State of Louisiana).\n\nQ. If I am active duty, am I exempt from paying my sales tax on my vehicle in Louisiana?\n\nA. You are exempt from “use” tax only, provided you can prove that you paid sales tax on the vehicle in another state prior to registering your vehicle in Louisiana. Unfortunately, you are not exempt from any initial purchase sales tax.\n\nQ. What documents must I bring with me?\n\nA. This varies on which service you are seeking. Any Disabled Veteran benefits related to the Office of Motor Vehicles require your letter from the Department of Veteran’s Affairs reflecting at least a 50% disability. General Veteran’s services typically require your DD214 or other acceptable proof. There is a link following each product above that outlines the individual requirements for each.\n\n231 N.
