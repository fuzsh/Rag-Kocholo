        "text": "Since August 2022, Chicago has welcomed over 35,000 individuals and families via buses and airplanes sent by Texas Governor Abbott and non-government organizations in Texas, Colorado, and New York. The majority are seeking asylum from Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Caribbean, and the African continent due to US foreign policy that has created unstable economic and political conditions compromising their safety and forcing them to travel thousands of miles to safety. U.S. cities have not traditionally had the infrastructure to resettle high numbers of immigrants and refugees. This is federal responsibility. Seeking asylum is an internationally protected right afforded to everyone.\n\nShelters are open 24/7, with a curfew of 11 pm. Every shelter has onsite case managers that help connect new arrivals to the services they need, including: healthcare, mental health, family reunification, and other supports.\n\nIndividuals at these shelters are focused on rebuilding their lives and creating stability for themselves and their families back home. Many are building new support networks, often with help from case managers, and connect with local faith-based institutions to find community.\n\nThe City of Chicago can provide for both the needs of new arrivals and local residents. This is a both/and operation. In addition to the supports structured for new arrivals, the City continues to invest in new, long-term homeless solutions, including developing new non-congregateâ¯shelterâ¯spacesâ¯andâ¯increasingâ¯permanentâ¯supportiveâ¯housing options.\n\nThe City also invests in housing-first strategies to help house people. The City of Chicago invested over $117 Mâ¯to transform the overall response to homelessness. One of those investments included continuing the investment in rapid rehousing beginning with the Expedited Housing Initiative (EHI), which uses $35 million inâ¯CARES fundingâ¯to house over 1,800 households. Moving forward, another $35 million will be invested to house anotherâ¯1,300â¯households and helpâ¯1,000 currently housed individualsâ¯remain housed.\n\nNon-citizens need authorization from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to work. USCIS requires individuals to apply for an employment authorization document (i.e., EAD/work permit).\n\nAfter submitting and confirming receipt of an asylum application to USCIS, new arrivals must wait 150 days to apply for an EAD to legally work. Working without legal authorization can compromise their chances of obtaining status to lawfully stay in the United States.\n\nOn September 20, 2023, the Department of Homeland Security announced the extension and redesignation of Venezuela for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months. Venezuelan nationals (roughly 75 percent of those who have come to Chicago since August 2022) are afforded TPS if they crossed the border by July 31, 2023. This allows a streamlined process to obtain an EAD and protection from detention and deportation.\n\nThe State of Illinois, City of Chicago, The Resurrection Project, and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) are hosting a series of legal clinics to help those eligible for TPS/EAD submit their applications.\n\nThrough support of the State of Illinois, legal services and case management will be available to help individuals apply for Temporary Protected Status, Employment Authorization Documents (EADs), and Asylum. We will connect individuals to other resources as they become available.\n\nAll new arrivals will remain eligible for the following resources: IDHS public benefits via Victims of Trafficking, Torture, or other serious Crimes (VTTC), a health home via Cook County Health, assistance with school enrollment at Chicago Public Schools, and other resources and supports available through the Illinois Welcoming Center network.\n\nWith winter fast approaching, slower turn around for retrofitting buildings, lack of availability of large spaces like McCormick Place due to scheduled conferences and events, and the frequency of multiple unannounced buses and airplanes of individuals seeking asylum from Texas, base camps provide a temporary stabilization strategy and turnkey solutions to ensure the 2,000 people awaiting shelter in police stations, airports and sleeping outdoors have a safer alternative as they continue their path for self-sufficiency.\n\nThrough City, county, and State databases and with assistance of a real estate broker, the City identifies suitable buildings that could be quickly retrofitted for temporary shelters and vacant land that meets size and infrastructure specs to stand up base camps.\n\nUpon site identification, Alderpersons are notified of the potential use while City staff assess viability of building or land. The City will continue to engage the Alderperson and community stakeholders.\n\nBrick and mortar buildings typically are a shorter timeline, while land for base camps require additional assessment by City departments upon identification. The two paths are outlined below.\n\nBrick and Mortar Temporary Shelters\n\nBuildout and timeline created for necessary renovation to ensure space meets minimum temporary shelter standards.\n\nCalculations made on how many individuals can be sheltered and composition (Families vs. Singles)\n\nAlderperson receives confirmation that site is viable with projected timeline for opening based on how much repair is needed, as well as estimated number and composition of shelter residents.\n\nBase Camp Temporary Shelters\n\nAlderperson receives notification that land is under consideration to stand up a base camp through initial assessment of size (at least 3 acres of vacant land). Before confirmation, a thorough assessment of the infrastructure and land by City departments will take place.\n\nCity Infrastructure departments conduct an assessment and participate in due diligence of the site that may include but not limited to tree trimming, removing dead trees, removing debris, rodent abatement, grading site for hazardous conditions, illuminating areas around the site, repairing alley lighting, determining if there is existing water and sewer lines, repairing catch basins, cleaning catch basins, and performing various environmental assessments.\n\nCalculation made on how many individuals can be sheltered and composition (Families vs. Singles)\n\nAlderperson receives confirmation that site is viable with projected timeline for opening as well as estimated number and composition of shelter residents.\n\nIn both the brick and mortar and land identification, the last step includes: The City works with the Alderperson to support in a community meeting if requested to provide details on temporary shelter opening and answer questions about operations, safety, and wrap around supports.\n\nOnce all assessments have concluded and the environmental assessments are completed/addressed. The City will provide notice to the Contractor to put in the order for the site. It will take at least 96 hours to get equipment/supplies to the site. Once equipment has arrived, it will take several days to erect, outfit, and test systems before welcoming residents. Once the base camp is fully staffed and system tests have passed, the City will begin transitioning residents based on how long people have been waiting at police station and airport staging areas.\n\nDuring the initial building of the facility, equipment acquisition, required utilities, initiating services and construction staff will be provided by GWFS supplemented by local vendors. The work will be coordinated by the City. Once the facility is operational and welcoming asylum seekers and other migrants, a transition will be made to hiring local service providers and Chicago residents.\n\nAs of October 21, 2023, GWFS is accepting applications for workers and attending City hiring fairs. Learn about job opportunities here.\n\nDuring the initial building of the facility, equipment acquisition, required utilities, initiating services and construction staff will be provided by GWFS supplemented by local vendors. The work will be coordinated by the City. Once the facility is operational and welcoming asylum seekers and other migrants, a transition will be made to hiring local service providers and Chicago residents.\n\nCPS has been prioritizing enrolling new arrival students in schools that have existing space in classrooms, bilingual teachers and supports that are nearest to the City’s temporary shelters. CPS is attempting to enroll students in schools that are best positioned to support the critical needs of new arrival children.\n\nNot all schools nearest to temporary shelters are most appropriate for students, so CTA cards (as required for all STLS—Students in Temporary Living Situations) are provided for students who need to travel further to attend school. Because CPS knows which schools have space in classrooms, bilingual staff and other resources, when families attempt to enroll in schools without working with the CPS Office of Language and Cultural Education (OLCE) team, students may end up enrolling in schools that are not best positioned to support their students’ needs immediately. It is critical that families work with CPS to coordinate enrollment.\n\nCPS also allocated additional dollars, based on 20th day enrollment at schools, as they do annually, to schools that have received new students. Those schools whose 20th day enrollment increases reflected additional new arrival students often received additional English Language Program Teacher positions (a half- or full-time additional position) based on the contractual ratios. CPS is continuing to receive requests from principals as approved by network chiefs for additional staff and resources as enrollment of new arrival students continues beyond the 20th day.\n\nThe CPS OLCE continues to coordinate enrollment at schools via the Welcome Center at Clemente High School and CPS mobile staff teams enrolling new arrival students at shelters in coordination with the Mayor’s Office, DFSS, OEMC, the CTU and mutual aid partners. The City is working to set up additional strategic conversations with CPS and 12th ward community leaders.\n\nSince August 2022, Chicagoans across the City have generously contributed through donations, mutual aid, and sheltering through their faith community sponsorships, and have advocated for more federal and State resources for this humanitarian effort. Please visit the 'Donations' tabto learn more about how to help those seeking asylum and other migrants.\n\nAdvocate\n\nContact your congressperson and the White House to urge increased funding that will cover comprehensive sheltering and resettlement work in the City, Cook County, and State.\n\nFive core asks:\n\nNationwide coordination of resettlement to receiving cities/States with a single federal leader,\n\nDonated use of Federal land and buildings for sheltering throughout Illinois such as military bases and training facilities,\n\nFlexible use of federal funding for sheltering operations and overall expenses.\n\nResources and technical assistance for expedited Temporary Protective Status (TPS) and employment authorization document (EAD) processing, and\n\nExpansion of TPS and EAD for all non-citizens.\n\nContact your State Representative and Senator to urge that Illinois:\n\nCreate shelter and resettlement hubs in at least two other municipalities directly supported and operated by the State\n\nIncrease Asylum Seeker Emergency Rental Assistance Program by $50 million\n\nCreate a sustainable funding stream for Chicago to cover 30-40% of costs from shelter to resettlement services.\n\nSupport Chicago Public Schools\n\nIncreased the Students in Temporary Living Situations (STLS) services for all students\n\nAdditional resources and flexibility in licensing of Bilingual educators\n\nExpedite existing capital projects and new construction for replacement purposes\n\nDonate\n\nSupport mutual aid groups helping at police districts\n\nAmazon Wish List: chicago.gov/support\n\nWinter items (new preferred) dropped off at 4401 W.

Contact newarrivalschicago@cityofchicago.org\n\nShelter/Housing Leads\n\nSuggest potential shelters or rental units https://www.chicago.gov/City/en/sites/texas-new-arrivals/home/shelter.html\n\nWe will continue prioritizing the safety and well-being of community residents. Shelter policies – like the curfew policy – are in place to help establish routines and expectations while making sure that the environment inside the shelter is as safe and comfortable as possible. We expect that shelter staff will follow curfew policy while also using their best judgment to determine what is the best course of action in individual instances, recognizing when the most humane course of action – that does not threaten the safety of the individual or others in the shelter - is to make an exception. For example, there are individualswho work 2nd or 3rd shifts who can be exempt from the curfew policy.\n\nThe City identified the land through City, County, and State databases. The location met the initial assessment to stand up a base camp to shelter minimally 1,000 individuals including: over 10 acres of vacant land that may be able to place base camps.\n\nUpon site identification, the Alderperson was notified of the potential use as City departments began preliminary assessments.\n\nFollowing the notification, City Infrastructure departments conducted an assessment and performed due diligence of the site that included thus far: tree trimming, removing dead trees, removing debris, grading site for hazardous conditions, illuminating areas around the site, repairing alley lighting, determining if there is existing water and sewer lines, performing various environmental assessments, and bringing water and sewer to the site.\n\nThe City will work with community-based organizations in the area and City agencies to develop strategies that address community’s needs and answer to safety concerns by standing up a shelter safety committee composed of shelter staff and residents, City departments, Chicago Police Department, representatives from the alderperson’s office, and community partners for ongoing planning and execution of strategies to keep shelter residents and staff safe along with the surrounding community. For example, the City will work with CPS and community organizations to increase the presence of safe passage workers.\n\nThe City will also have ongoing community engagement by meeting with organizations and community members in the area to provide updates and address areas of importance to ensure the safety of people inside the base camp and throughout the 12th Ward.\n\nAdditionally:\n\nWe’re equipping shelters with equipment and resources to maintain secure facilities, including wands and metal detectors.\n\nWe also work across City agencies and departments to ensure that each is part of the planning process. They are working to identify how they can contribute to preventing crime and safety issues, but their responses.\n\nWe’re working to ensure that shelter staff know who to contact and how to reach them to ensure that the right dept/agency is notified when necessary.\n\nWe’re organizing regional safety committees with various voices/perspectives, including community residents. These committees will meet on a regular and ongoing basis to identify issues, determine how best to utilize community assets and address issues in real time.\n\nWe will also continue the strong partnerships we have with Community-Based Organizations and work collaboratively with our city agencies to continue focusing on safety for the entire city of Chicago."
