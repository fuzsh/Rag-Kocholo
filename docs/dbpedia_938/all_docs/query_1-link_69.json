The Commission is made up of three members who serve staggered, three-year terms. A person appointed to the Commission must be of good moral character, a United States citizen, a resident of the City of San Antonio for more than three years, over the age of 25, and have not held a public office within the last three years.

The Commission holds regular meetings on the second Monday of each month.
