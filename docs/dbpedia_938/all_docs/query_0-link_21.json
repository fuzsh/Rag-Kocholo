First, «9 it will give the Public Health Service facilities for cancer therapy which are >,1 too costly to maintain in individual hospitals for the relatively few cancer cases reporting to a single institution for hospitalization. By transferring cancer cases from the 22 general hospitals of the Public Health Service to the Baltimore unit, patients dependent upon the Public Health Service for medical care would be concentrated in a single unit devoted exclusively to the study and application of the best methods of cancer treatment which modern science offers. Second, the National Cancer Institute will be enabled to carry out one il of the primary functions outlined in the provisions of the National Cancer Act of 1937— -that is, study leading to improvement in the diagnosis and treatment I of cancer. One of the most imperative needs for the reduction of cancer mor­ tality is the training of expert personnel in the use of m o d e m methods of treatment. The National Cancer Institute will, in the model center at Baltimore, be able to play its part in improving medical care for cancerous patients by teaching and demonstrating the better methods of treatment to personnel of the Public Health Service and to other physicians who may take advantage of an opportunity for study and observation at the Baltimore clinic. The Marine Hospital at Baltimore, situated along the southeastern border yf of Wyman Park, is a 450-bed institution with adjacent quarters for officers and nurses, a research laboratory in addition to the laboratory for routine clinical V « I examinations, facilities for X-ray diagnosis, physiotherapy, dental and eye— earno se-and-throat clinics. . : 3 One of the important medical centers of this country, Baltimore, offers the proposed cancer treatment unit the advantage of co-operation and consulta­ tion with such famed cancer clinics as the Eoward-Kelly Institute and with the numerous specializing surgeons of that city. Proximity to the future home of the National Oancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, was another factor in tho selection of the Baltimore hospital. It is about 30 miles from the Bethesda site where buildings of the National Institute of Health are already under construction. According to present plans, both in-patient and out-patient services will be maintained at the new cancer treatment center. will be accepted at the clinic. Approximately 100 bed-patients The second floor of the hospital will be devoted to the care of cancer bed-patients and to the admission of out-patients. Rooms in the basement will be equipped for X-ray and radium therapyt and the pathological work of detecting cancerous tissue will bo done in the research laboratory of the hospital. Marine hospital patients, amenable to ambulatory treatment, may also be sent to Baltimore, but they will have to idsido in the city at their own expense and report to the clinic for treatment. The staff of specialists planned will include a clinical director specially trained in cancer surgery, X-ray and radium therapy. He will head the cancer unit but will be responsible to the Medical Director of the hospital. A pathologist specializing in the detection of cancerous tissue, a roentgenologist skilled in deep therapy technique and a physicist with special knowledge of radium will complete the special staff of the cancer unit, but the regular staff of other departments of the hospital together with its numerous consulting specialists will at all times be available to the clinical director of the cancer treatment center.

The rooms of the hospital which will he assigned for the handling of X-rays and radium will he altered and equipped for adequate protection hy the use of lead-impregnated v/alls and glass. It is estimated that the purchase of the radium and X-ray equip­ ment, together;with the necessary structural alterations will cost approxi­ mately $30,000o Since the treatment center will he one of its authorized activities, the National Cancer Institute will hear those costs. oOc— OHIO TEXAS Robert L.

The Commissioner directed that field divisions undertake eorrespondence or office audits in certain selected cases where the questions in­ volved appeared susceptible of discussion without the necessity for an exhaustive investigation. The Commissioner also authorized the heads of the thirty-eight revenue agents1 divisions located at various points throughout the country to issue final deficiency notices in all cases where taxpayers fail to make a timely response to the Agents* invitation to execute an agreement or to file a protest against proposed deficiencies. The field men are instructed to supply taxpayers with complete information as to the basis of the claimed deficiencies, and to offer them every opportunity to pre­ sent any evidence or argument they wish against the proposed adjustment. These instructions are also designed to supplement the acceleration program directed by Secretary Morgenthau more than a year ago. To accom­ plish the Secretary*s wishes, the work of audit and investigation must be completed within fifteen months following the last date for filing for a particular year period. The benefits to the taxpayer and to the Government as a result of the rule have been so apparent and so universally approved that the Commissioner emphasized to the field forces his expectation that the work upon the 1936 and 1937 returns be completed on time.
