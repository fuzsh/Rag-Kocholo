        "text": "In a widely-watched video that’s become a battle cry for some Mid-City residents, revelers shout and scream as round after round of fireworks explode in rapid succession into the dark night sky, fizzling and hissing while embers sprinkle down.\n\nThe YouTube video, shot in 2007, pans down to a large pile of Christmas trees that have been set afire, as spectators circle around them, bellowing and chucking objects to feed a blaze that reaches several feet into the air. Later, hundreds watch while others run laps and dance around the fiery pit, laughing and holding beers or go-cups in the air.\n\nAt the end, some of the dancers have shed their clothes and are leaping around the flames naked as the crowd chants a few rounds of “Who Dat.”\n\nThe Orleans Avenue bonfire has been described as a beloved, if not a bit rowdy, tradition that was carried on for decades every New Year’s Eve when residents from Mid-City dragged old Christmas trees onto the neutral ground and set them in ceremonial ablaze.\n\nIt’s been eight years since the Mid-City bonfire – which was never exactly legal – took form in a fashion similar to what’s seen in the video, and seven since a more regulated, City of New Orleans-approved version went down in the same spot between City Park and Carrollton Avenue.\n\nYet this past year, thanks in part to what some Mid-City residents call an “overkill” of police and firefighter presence in Mid-City, the issue of the bonfires has once again been reignited, calling into question exactly who should be able to use areas of Orleans Avenue and Bayou St. John, and for what.\n\n“People are really pretty mad,” said Jennifer Farwell, a Mid-City resident and former president of the Mid-City Neighborhood Organization, adding that anger level rose when she and other residents saw several police cars “just sitting” on the neutral ground in the dark as she drove by Orleans Avenue on New Year’s Eve, presumably waiting to catch residents trying to start bonfires of their own.\n\nThe police presence sparked a bevy of concerns on various social media sites in the week after New Year’s, some of which are slated to be brought up at a special forum held by the Mid-City Neighborhood Organization on Monday, Farwell said.\n\nFarwell said residents are questioning what kind of burning is allowed, if any, especially when it comes to private fires in people’s backyards on New Year’s Eve and beyond.\n\nOn discussion groups held by websites like Yahoo and NextDoor, neighbors also wonder why bonfires were targeted when gunfire continues to be a problem, and other residents openly shoot off large-display fireworks, which are also illegal under city law.\n\nAnd residents wondered if the bonfires would ever be allowed in Mid-City again, perhaps in a more controlled form, like what was organized by various city agencies and private organizations in 2008. The conversation is ripe for discussion, Farwell said, since bonfires are still held in December right across the river in Algiers.\n\n“If they can have one every year, then why can’t we?” she mused, reflecting the concerns of her neighbors. “Maybe we could have something that’s legal.”\n\nMonday’s forum could be a flashback to 2009, when more than 100 residents gathered with city officials during a heated discussion over whether the annual bonfire should be saved. While some residents described the tradition as harmless fun, others argued it had become an unruly event marked by dangerous environments and piles of trash, and deserved to be extinguished.\n\nThe year before, the bonfire had been permitted with restrictions, but cost about $8,000 and lacked spontaneity, residents said, leading some to question whether a controlled event would be worth it at all again in the future.\n\n“Bringin em back…they’d be breathin down your neck so hard,” Michael Patrick Welch, a local writer and journalist who lives in Algiers, said in a discussion thread online. “It was only fun cause it was lawless, and you knew it couldn’t last. Just glad no one ever got seriously injured.”\n\nThe issue of the bonfires was this reignited in late December, residents said, when firefighters and police began taking a “proactive” approach by going door to door to hang 2,100 notices in Mid-City warning residents not to start the fires.\n\nThe note said the New Orleans Fire Department had partnered with the Louisiana State Fire Marshal’s Office, the New Orleans Police Department and the Department of Sanitation in an effort to discourage people from participating in what they called a “very dangerous New Year’s Eve ritual.”\n\nIn an interview with WGNO, Fire Supt. Tim McConnell told a reporter that the city had seen four different incidents involving bonfires in 2014 alone. The illegal fires are unsafe, he said, because they tie up resources that would be crucial in the event of a house fire nearby.\n\n“We had an issue last year where people had accumulated many, many Christmas trees and dragged them out here and ignited them on the neutral ground,” McConnell told the TV station. “”In addition to the damage it causes to public property with fires on the neutral ground, the embers that become airborne from these can fly and travel great distances.”\n\nAt a recent Faubourg St. John Neighborhood Association meeting, the only comment made about New Year’s Eve involved a stray bullet that had fallen into a woman’s solar panel. But former and current MCNO members said they had heard a variety of complaints, starting with the fire department’s request to tell authorities on neighbors if they were even seen gathering items “traditionally used as New Year’s Eve bonfire materials.”\n\nThe police presence in Mid-City just brought insult to injury, Farwell said, adding that she saw three police cars on Orleans Avenue around 10:45, even though the neutral ground was quiet and dark. Other residents reported seeing as many as six in the surrounding area.\n\n“They were determined to not let us have a bonfire, and I understand that they may think it’s not safe or whatever,” Farwell said. “But when we are struggling as a city with so much crime, and we have a known deficit, policing a dark empty neutral ground just seems a waste of resource.”\n\nTyler Gamble, spokesman for the New Orleans Police Department, told Mid-City Messenger that just one unit was paired with the Fire Department on New Year’s Eve in the Bayou St. John area, and that no arrests were made in connection with bonfires.\n\nDuring a citywide Comstat meeting on Wednesday, NOPD Third District Commander Gary Marchese reported that his officers “assisted” NOFD and fire marshal with watching for bonfires on New Year’s Eve and that everything “went smoothly.”\n\nThe commander added that officers had been looking for indications of potential bonfires before they were lit, like trees being piled up, so they never needed a lot of personnel.\n\n“They were nipping it before they started,” Marchese said.\n\nJim Olsen, chair of the Mid-City Security District, also said that additional MCSD vehicles were in the area on New Year’s Eve, other than usual patrols, but only because they were responding to two disturbance calls.\n\n“MCSD was not involved in any ‘overwhelming’ presence on the Bayou,” Olsen said, adding that the organization didn’t send out cars to the area to monitor for illegal activity like fireworks or bonfires because the security district “is responsible is to patrol the entire MCSD district, not act as special assignment.”\n\nAlong with members of the New Orleans Fire Department and the New Orleans Police Department, Olsen is being invited to Monday’s forum.\n\nHe didn’t indicate what he might say at such a gathering, but did say when it comes to protecting the neighborhood and the area’s residents, district officers are trained to monitor for illegal activity on New Year’s Eve and in general in Mid-City.\n\n“Anything that involves illegal, criminal activity, or the safety of the residents or their property is a concern,” Olsen said.\n\nFarwell, in the meantime, said she’s hoping the city can find some kind of balance when it comes to safety versus “overpolicing.”\n\n“How much of a big brother do you want here?” she asked.\n\nThis article has been updated to correctly reflect when the Algiers bonfires occur.\n\nThe Mid-City Neighborhood Organization’s monthly meeting is slated for 6:30 p.m Monday at Warren Easton Charter High School, located at 3019 Canal St."
