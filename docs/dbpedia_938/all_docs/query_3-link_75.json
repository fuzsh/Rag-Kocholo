        "text": "Vehicle Titles Mid-City\n\nGentilly Alert\n\nHave you found a buyer for your car, but you can't find the Title? Trying to get a Title Loan, but can remember where you placed it? Or, maybe you were recently married and would like to change your name on your vehicle Title and Registration. ABC Title of Mid-City can help!\n\nABC Title of Mid-City - VEHICLE TITLES\n\nSEE BELOW FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS.\n\n1) DUPLICATE TITLES\n\nIf you have misplaced your Title, don’t worry because ABC Title of Mid-City can assist you in obtaining a duplicate. Simply come in with your VIN number, Driver’s License, and lien release (if applicable) and we can have a duplicate mailed to you in three to five business days.\n\n2) NAME CHANGES\n\nHave you recently married or divorced? Do you want to change your name on your Title and Vehicle Registration? If your car is paid off, ABC Title of Mid-City can help! Bring your Original Title, proof of insurance, your Driver’s License, and a copy of your Marriage Certificate or Judgment of Divorce and we will get you updated in under 30 minutes\n\n3) RECONSTRUCTED/SALVAGED TITLES\n\nDid you buy your vehicle back from your insurance company after it was declared a “Total Loss”? ABC Title of Mid-City can assist you in applying for a “Reconstructed Title” and issuing your new plate. Generally, you will need the Title, Physical Inspection, receipts for repairs (if available), and proof of insurance. We will prepare the rest of the documents required and get your vehicle legal and back on the road in no time.\n\n4) RELEASE/RECORD LIENS\n\nHave you recently paid off your vehicle? ABC Title of Mid-City can assist you in removing the Lienholder from the face of the Title, making it easier to sell later (and easier to order a duplicate if it is ever misplaced). We can also assist you in recording a lien on a vehicle when it is being used as collateral for a loan. Simply bring the Original Title with Lien Release or Security Instrument and photo ID.\n\n5) NOTARIZE TITLE ONLY\n\nAre you selling or donating a car to someone in another state, or to someone who wants to handle their own registration at the Louisiana DMV? Let ABC Title of Mid-City protect you. We can prepare and notarize the appropriate documents, cancel your plate, and notify the state of the sale. This protects you from liability and potential flags. The best part is that this is traditionally paid for by the buyer/donee.\n\n6) TITLE CORRECTIONS\n\nABC Title of Mid-City can assist in title corrections such as odometer errors, name misspellings, and color changes. If you were recently married or divorced and you are not financing your vehicle, we can also change your name on the title and registration to reflect your current legal name. Simply bring the original title and supporting legal documents and we will be happy to assist you.\n\n7) SALVAGE RETENTION\n\nIf your vehicle is considered a total loss after being involved in an accident and subsequent insurance claim, you must apply for a salvaged and reconstructed title and get a new license plate. ABC Title of Mid-City can get you road-ready and will walk you through the process. You will need a physical inspection done by a licensed state police officer and other documents depending upon the nature of the repairs. We are here to guide you through the policies on Rebuilt Salvaged Vehicles and Salvage Retention. Contact one of our friendly representatives for assistance.\n\nFAQs\n\nQ. What forms of payment do you accept?\n\nA. We accept cash, debit, and all major credit cards (including AMEX). Note there is an additional 3% fee for credit card payments. We do not accept personal checks.\n\nQ. Where can I get a lien release for my vehicle loan?\n\nA. You must contact the Lender who financed your vehicle and have them fax it to our office (504-302-1599). If your Lender demands a request in writing, we can help! Click here and follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nQ. If my vehicle is \"co-owned\", must the other owner co-apply for a duplicate?\n\nA. Yes, if there are two owners listed on a vehicle, then both must sign a duplicate Title affidavit before a Notary. (Ask an ABC of Mid-City Agent about other options if a Co-Owner is unable to physically appear to apply).\n\nQ. I am paying notes on my vehicle and was recently married or divorced. Can I change my name on the title?\n\nA. Only if your Lender is willing to cooperate by releasing the Original Title for correction.\n\nQ. Where can I get a \"physical inspection\" for my vehicle?\n\nA. Visit this page to find a location or call the Louisiana State Police for an additional list of locations.\n\nQ. If the \"titled owner\" of a vehicle is deceased, can I order a duplicate title so the vehicle can be sold?\n\nA. A Duplicate Title cannot be ordered if the Owner is deceased. Contact ABC Title of Mid-City for additional information if you are an “Heir”.\n\nQ. Can I transfer a vehicle without the title?\n\nA. Generally not. A Duplicate Title must be ordered prior to completing a Sale or Donation.\n\n231 N.
