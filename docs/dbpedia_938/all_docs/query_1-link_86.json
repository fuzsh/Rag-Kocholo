Parking in front of the San Diego Zoo and smaller lots throughout the Park tend to fill up quickly. For easiest access in and out of the Park, Inspiration Point (on the east side of Park Blvd, at the intersection of President’s Way) is a great option.\n\nThe free Balboa Park tram can transport you within a 10-minute walk to many of the Cultural District's most popular destinations. Trams stop at each location approximately every 15 minutes. Trams are ADA accessible and include room for strollers. Summer tram hours in effect from 6/2 - 10/31 are from 9:00 am - 8:00 pm daily. From 11/2 - 5/31, tram hours are 9:00 am - 6:00 pm daily. Find tram stops on the Park map here.\n\nThere are several accessible parking spaces at all parking lots in the Balboa Park Cultural District. If you cannot find a parking space in the smaller lots, the main lot at Inspiration Point is serviced by free trams that are wheelchair capable with ramps or lifts. See the Directions and Parking section above about tram schedules. If you have additional questions about the tram, please contact the tram manager with City Parks and Recreation at (619) 235-1124.\n\nThe Balboa Park Visitors Center has two manual wheelchairs and two three-wheel electric mobility scooters available for daily rental use within the Park (Zoo excluded). Rental rates vary depending on length of rental and type of wheeled device used. Reservations, though not required, may be made in advance through Mobility Source at (619) 234-9505. The Balboa Park Visitors Center is located at the House of Hospitality in the center of the park at 1549 El Prado, 92101. For wheelchair accessible entrance, enter via the north side along El Prado Rd.\n\nEach Explorer participating museum has their own policy for Caregiver access. Be sure to contact each venue to learn about their Caregiver policy before visiting.\n\nThe Balboa Park Explorer Pass does not offer a Caregiver Pass due to the requirements of the individual musuems."
