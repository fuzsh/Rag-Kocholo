        "text": "It is no wonder thousands of people move to the suburbs of San Diego County every year. It has unbeatable weather, rich history, and a vast array of famous attractions. Who wouldn’t want to join the ranks of these lucky Southern Californians?\n\nWith living options ranging from beachfront properties and city apartments to gated neighborhoods and large custom homes, there is a place for just about every taste and lifestyle.\n\nIf you are one of the lucky ones who will make your way to this beautiful county soon, the next step will be choosing the city where you will plant your roots.\n\nAs one of the best-rated movers in San Diego, Move Central is here for you. Contact us today if you’re planning a move or need help packing!\n\nTo ensure you have everything you need to know about the area, we’ve put together this comprehensive guide and list of all of the cities in San Diego County. Read on to see which will make the perfect home for your needs.\n\nCounty History\n\nAs with many parts of the western United States, the history of San Diego County is full of ancient Native American tribes who have lived there for thousands of years. A few of the most well-known groups in this area include the Kumeyaay, the Cupeño, and the Luiseño. They lived there for centuries until the mid-1500s, when the first Spanish conquistadors arrived.\n\nAfter looking at what is now known as Mission Bay, a Spaniard decided to name the region after Saint Didacus, who more commonly went by the name San Diego.\n\nOnce the Mexican Declaration of Independence from Spain was passed, this area remained a part of Mexico until 1848. At that time, the Mexican-American War came to an end thanks to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Shortly thereafter, it become part of the state of California in 1850.\n\nUnfortunately, this wasn’t the last war that directly affected the San Diego area. Before the turn of the century, the Spanish-American War of 1898 brought the need for a navy to be established. It was closely followed by both World Wars, leading to a total of seven naval bases being built around the county during those times.\n\nSince then, the area has grown into a thriving region. It plays a key role in the tuna fishing and aerospace manufacturing industries. It’s home to multiple universities, and much more.\n\nArea Geography & Climate\n\nOver the years, San Diego County has been broken into smaller pieces that have been re-established as new counties. At one point, it was the only county along the Mexican border, extending all the way over to the Colorado River. Though it used to cover a much larger geographical area, San Diego County still stands as one of the top ten largest counties in the state.\n\nWith a coverage area of about 4,526 square miles, the county has a lot more to offer than just sandy beaches along the coast. In fact, on the eastern side, you’ll find yourself in a portion of the Sonoran Desert. And between the two, you’ll find a vast array of rolling hills, shallow canyons, and even mountains with snowy tips during the winter time.\n\nThere is little to be said about the county’s climate beyond the notion that it offers some of the most comfortable and coveted weather in the entire world.\n\nYou will experience dry, hot summers and mild winters near the desert areas. But the closer you get to the Pacific Coast, a light t-shirt and shorts are commonplace for most locals thanks to temperatures averaging between 45°F and 80°F all year long.\n\nHow Fast Is the San Diego County Population Growing?\n\nThe area grew very slowly during its first decade, though it spiked briefly around 1849 due to the Gold Rush. From 1848 to 1860, the San Diego population rose from 650 to a mere 731 residents. But as you might have guessed, it didn’t take much longer for people to recognize the great weather and immense opportunity the region had to offer.\n\nWith fast-growing cities like San Diego, Chula Vista, and Oceanside at the helm, the county is now home to more than 3.3 million people. The population has risen by 0.61 percent so far this year.\n\nThat metric has been met or exceeded every year for the past decade, resulting in a population expansion of over 8 percent since 2010. The area is also known for its diversity, with people from a variety of backgrounds and ethnicities moving here every year.\n\nAnd while English is the primary spoken language, about 23 percent of citizens in San Diego County are bilingual. Many of these individuals speak Spanish or Asian dialects, as well as a handful of Pacific Island languages.\n\nTop Cities in San Diego County\n\nSome of the largest San Diego County cities include San Diego, Chula Vista, Oceanside, Escondido, and Carlsbad, all of which are home to at least 100,000.\n\nSan Diego gives residents the big city feel with a population eclipsing 1.3 million. Lovingly referred to “America’s Finest City”, it fits the bill with white sandy beaches, fun activities, and beautiful weather.\n\nPeople living in Chula Vista know it as the lemon capital of the world. Between its family-friendly neighborhoods and comparably low cost of living, it’s a popular place in the county to raise children.\n\nEverything about Oceanside screams California living. Gorgeous beaches, great places to eat, and oceanview neighborhoods all come standard with this San Diego suburb.\n\nEscondido is marketed as the “City of Choice”. On the outskirts of the big city, you’ll experience less traffic and fewer people. However, this spot still retains the beauty and essence of living in southern California.\n\nThere’s nothing bad to say about Carlsbad. As one of the fastest-growing cities in California for many years, it has charm in all the right places. Most residences offer a view of the ocean with a quick look out your door or window.\n\nA Tourism and Vacation Hot Spot\n\nIt’s not difficult to find a wide variety of fun things to do around the San Diego suburbs. In the heart of San Diego, you’ll find popular attractions like Sea World, Balboa Park, and the world-famous San Diego Zoo.\n\nIf you find yourself in Escondido, visiting the breathtaking Safari Park may be in order. A weekend in Oceanside gives you access to the weekly Sunset Market and the longest wooden pier along the entire west coast.\n\nBeautiful beaches line almost the entire 70 miles of the San Diego coast, giving you plenty of opportunities for fun in the sun and access to the ocean. Surfers find their happy place in local spots such as Black’s Beach in La Jolla, Swami’s State Beach in Encinitas, or Sunset Cliffs next to the Point Loma neighborhood in San Diego.\n\nCities In San
