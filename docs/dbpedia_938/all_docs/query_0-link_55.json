Certain things can be run through the time machine over and over again and still come out fresh and new. This is due to the fact that everyone acquires their own personal values from the past. This fifty-fifth volume of the L'Aca- dien explores the development of U.S.L. so that it may become more apparent to each of us how far this institution has come through the years. An effort has been made to contrast the past with the present through the use of photographs from the archives of Dupre Library. Unfortunately unless otherwise indicated the identification of these \"faces from the past\" has been lost. We would like to ask you to help us learn who these people are. If, while thumbing through your book, you should recognize your grandmother ... let us know too. This way each of us can help restore the fresco of our past. 1900's \"THE PAST IS A FOREIGN COUNTRY THEY DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY THERE\" L. P.

V 4 4 Yep, the party system was back into effect for the Student Government Elections at U.S.L. during the spring of '73, and what a sweeping effect they had! Out of the twenty-nine del- egates on the ACTION ticket, twenty-eight of them won their desired positions in S.G.A. ... a fantastic number when considering the law of averages. It was the first time in three years that the party system was in effect, for various people simply ran for independent offices before. Could such results as these mean a more unified Student Government at U.S.L.??? 18 Top Far Left: Pleased Floyd Collins, SGA treasurer, upon announcement of his victory.

They picked their four greatest priests And they began to speak They said: \"Lord, a plague is on the world Lord, no man is free The temples that we built to you Have tumbled to the sea Lord, if you won't take care of us Won't you please let us be?\" And the Lord said: And the Lord said: \"I burn down your cities — how blind must you be I take from you your children and you say how blessed are we You all must be crazy to put your Faith in me That's why I love mankind You really need me That's why I love mankind\" \"God's Song\" Randy Newman Randy Newman Sings Randy Newman Randy Newman made his recording debut some six or seven years ago. Since that time he has continually met with critical praise for his sharp wit and his great poignancy. He has been acclaimed as an extraordinary songwriter. But Newman's talent has been overlooked by the vast majority of music audiences. Last spring Randy Newman paid a belated visit to Lafay- ette to entertain USL students, and the turnout could have been much greater. Newman was able to evoke swells of laughter from his audience and then effectively alter their moods with pene- trating and contemplative lyrics. The tone of the evening was lightened, when Newman performed \"God's Song,\", \"A Lover's Prayer\" and \"Sail Away\" and then moods were tem- pered with the despair of \"Old Man\" and one of Newman's most respected works, \"Think It's Going to Rain Today.\" The concert was a representation of the music and lyrics of one of the best contemporary artists working in the music industry today. Buddy Rich: A Survivor Of Musical Changes Buddy Rich's career is a remarkable one. While other big band drummers such as Louis Belson, Max Roach and the late Gene Krupa simply did not survive the stormy transitions of musical styles over the past twenty years, Rich has. And he has done so with perseverence, talent and an impressive versatility. He is an exciting and dynamic performer. But, unfortu- nately, last spring, the students who made the effort to attend the Union Entertainment Committee's Buddy Rich concert were very unimpressive in number. Rich's performance, however, did not suffer, despite the small turnout. He is a solid entertainer. The Municipal Auditorium swelled with the driving modern jazz sounds of Rich and his vibrant band. I Didn't Know About This. . .Did YOU? February 6, 1 973 and April 6, 1 973 — two dates on which campus activities were held for all those interested. Do these dates ring a bell to any of you? For those who attended the Nei- man-Marcus Style Show, the first date might sound familiar . . . those 1 000 or more students that attended the Bridal Fair might remember the second date. In any case, for those of us who do not know, both activities were sponsored by the U.S.L. Union Hospitality Committee, members of which sen/e two major functions on campus. First of all, they are ambassadors for the university, representing U.S.L. as hostesses for various on and off campus activities such as the Acadiana Trade Fair and the Miss University Pag- eant. Secondly, some members of the committee gain modeling experience by participating in fashion shows such as the activi- ties mentioned earlier ... the Neiman-Marcus Style Show and the Bridal Fair. Now, a little bit about the Bridal Fair and its intermittent style shows . . . these activities were held in the Union Ballroom and were open to anyone who wanted to stroll through. Booth spaces were sold to local and national companies and were set up around the stage in the ballroom. Although the committee was promised that ten national companies would participate, only four came, one of them being Corningware. The Fair went on throughout the day, and the style shows were presented at 2:00 and 7:00. The student attendance certainly rewarded those responsible for the activity . . . they surely worked hard to present it. Top Right: Betsy Campbell, a participant in the Bridal Fair Style Show.

J Osibisa — Criss Cross Rhythms That Explode V 9m *» v ■■■ Ins: ft Vivacious . . . unique . . . awesome . . . mov- ing . . .a few words which only partially describe this group known as \"Osibisa.\" Anyone at all familiar with the group but had never seen them perform would, without a doubt, be eager to see just \"how they do it.\" In one song in particular, \"The Dawn,\" the assemblage of instruments and noises depict perfectly the dawn in a rain forest. All of the members in the group are from coun- tries in and around Africa and wear native cos- tumes to perform. They are so full of life and movement that it would be almost impossible to be passive as a member of the audience. The U.S.L. audience was no exception ... we were all exhausted after the concert ended. They Say One Learns Through Experience Did I hear you ask, \"Is my university actually involved in a federally-operated program?\" We surely are, and it's called U.Y.A. (University Year for Action). Under the appointed direction of Dr. Leon Beasley of the College of Education at U.S.L., thirty-nine U.S.L. students have been involved in this program since it began on January 1 5, 1 973. For those who do not know, here's how U.Y.A. got started at U.S.L. . . . U.Y.A. began shortly after the formation of ACTION, a federal agency set up to establish new methods by which to extract more volunteers from the population to aid low-income communities throughout the country. U.Y.A. is a yearly program which must be renewed each year, if the university desires to do so. The program is made up of selected volunteers who are enrolled in the university. Although these students work for the agency full-time, forty hours a week, arrangements are made between the college and the agency to provide a full year's credit toward each student's curriculum. Each student-volunteer is supervised throughout the year. Colleges are selected to partici- pate in the program according to the number of low-income families in surrounding areas and according to the resources avail- able to successfully provide for the program at the university. Presently, the students involved in U.Y.A. are working in conjunction with the city on a Home Improvement Project. The Tru- man sub-division has been the center of much activity for this project. A mini-park with such equipment as old tires and swings to provide the neighborhood children with a small playground of their own and a mobile dental unit have been set up in this area, to name a few of the activities in which our students have been involved. The thirty-nine U.S.L. students involved in the 73 program are as follows: Terry Barfield, Joseph Chaillot, Pamela Rigsby, Holly Hayden, Michael Hurston, Juliette Hynes, Donna Smith, John Smith, John Schoen, David Schoen, Donna Robicheaux, Mona Richard, Wayne Dauterive, Janet Egle, Jane E. Larue, Lynda Surcouf, Jan Voorhies, Rosabella Bellard, Sandra Dixon, Durinda Robinson, Deane Bertrand, Babette Abadie, Anice Hilton, Jack Hourcade, Charlotte Smith, Steve Lund, Luceia Ledoux, Christine Bouzon, Stacey Boudreaux, Martin Barcelona, Frank Herdliska, Michael Holly, James Whitmore, Douglas Winn, and Lynda Landry.

Blue-framed glasses decorated with glitter and bobbie socks may be out, but, as the photographs reflect, graduation today is merely a carbon copy of 1930 graduations, and, who knows, U.S.L. students may have been forced to attend then also. So, to make this copy a little more informative than the usual \"As we each go our separate way ...\" stuff, a list of the progression in enrollment and curriculum addi- tions at U.S.L. is here for you . . . 1930 Undergraduates Liberal Arts — 26 Education — 54 2-year Teacher Training — 1 48 3-year Teacher Training — 34 1951 Undergraduates Liberal Arts — 184 Education — 253 Agriculture — 106 Engineering — 59 £ 3 mt iff i.

Colours Return To USL It was back in the Fall of 1972 when a group by the name of Colours performed with John Hartford for USL students in Municipal Auditorium. Colours made a favorable impression on students, and in late June last year they were back in Lafayette again to provide their audiences with their own special blend of country and rock. 32 Newgrass Performed By Red, White And Bluegrass \"We are not trying to change bluegrass,\" insisted lead guitarist Grant Boatwright. \"We're iust playing it the way we feel it.\" And Red, White and Bluegrass did just that last summer here at USL. Performing what they refer to as newgrass, the four-member group exhibited fine harmony while using some instruments not ordinarily associated with bluegrass such as an electric bass and strings. The group is very talented, and their concert here was quite good. 33 The Headaches Of Registration USL students may differ in some ways from year to year, but there is one aspect of attending our uni- versity which usually destroys any line of distinc- tion drawn between most students. The process of registration almost always induces the same feelings in students when they must register for classes. There is despondency, tension, frustration, and there are a number of other unwel- come feelings which evince themselves in registrants who do not take advantage of pre-registration. There are never-ending lines which plod along in our humid Louisiana heat. There are the computer cards which always seem to get misplaced. And then there are the closed classes. It is a trying proc- ess, and it's a shame that some people employed by the university and also some students run so short of patience during the last few days of registration. 'J 4 35 BS&T, Rock, Jazz, Heat & Sweat Hitting their audi- ence hard with rock 'n roll rhythms and proving their ability to produce a semblance of modern jazz, \"Blood, Sweat and Tears\" had Blackham Coliseum pulsating with their own brand of music on a warm and muggy Septem- ber evening last year. The audience, comprised mostly of USL students, gave the nine-member group an adequate southern welcome, and the response intensified as the group began to sat- isfy their audience with somewhat modi- fied versions of some of their old material. Jerry Fisher, who replaced David Clay- ton-Thomas as the lead singer for BS&T, is a husky and burly man who lacks the fine vocal quality which Clayton- Thomas had. Fisher's voice is sometimes a bit harsh, of course. This does afford him the capability of effec- tively performing some rock 'n roll material, but Clayton- Thomas' versatile range is missing, and the absence is very apparent. The audience seemed to be satis- fied with the BS&T show, despite the obvious musical and vocal changes which the group has under- gone. 36 Good Ole Slapstick Comedy Fun At USL I Who says that anyone accused of a crime is innocent until proven guilty? Certainly not the 12-member jury of Kangaroo Kourt, which was \"in session\" on October 1 9, 1 973 in the U.S.L. Union. This \"mock court\" is an annual activity sponsored by members of the service organization of Circle K here on campus. The \"accused\" are summoned to court by Circle K members and include freshman guys who are running for SGA offices, guys who had outstanding high school records from various high schools in this area, and outstanding freshman guys from fraternities on campus. The crowd attending Kangaroo Kourt is pri- marily made up of those involved in fraternities and sororities at U.S.L. Kangaroo Kourt is certainly a \"hell-raising\" activity . . . everyone has a great time. All accused are guilty before proven guilty and are accused of such crimes as molesting the swan in Cypress Lake and indecent exposure in front of Martin Hall. For pun- ishment, the accused have to stand there while scrumptious pies are thrown at them, and lie on their backs and sing, to name a few. The judge this year was none other than Dr. Pat Rickels of the English Department at U.S.L. and, when asked about her feelings in regard to the trial, she replied, \"I believe in the prevalence of justice.\" H Top Far Left and Right: Before and after shots of one of the activities inflicted upon \"the accused\" at Kangaroo Kourt, a pie-throwing incident.

Sybil Leek: Sybil Leek, a witch and one of the world's foremost authorities on the occult, gave an intriguing talk before a very large crowd in the Union Ballroom last October. Ms. Leek, who proudly admitted that there is an eight-hundred-year his- tory of involvement with the occult in her family, made it perfectly clear that she is not the Billy Graham of witchcraft. The evening moved quickly, as Ms. Leek discussed a variety of subjects. She explained her belief in a supreme being which encompas- ses all life forces, while she firmly stated that she does not believe in Satan, which is in distinct opposi- tion to the majority of American witches who worship the devil. She also offered some insight into the science of astrology and then declared her strong belief in uni- dentified flying objects. Sybil Leek, a rotund and very large lady, reflected a gentleness, a warmth and sincerity which earned her a standing ovation at the end of her talk. But if rumors which circu- lated around campus for sometime after Ms. Leek's visit were to be believed, then there was a certain religious group who could not accept Ms Leek endearingly. There were rumors to the effect that there was a meeting of prayer on campus on the same evening of Ms. Leek's talk. It was in opposition to her phi- losophies. Mort Sahl: Satire And Politics Last November Mort Sahl, political sati- rist and comedian, spoke before a full house in the USL Union Ballroom. Sahl's program was ninety minutes of rather tactful derision of every major figure in American politics today. He offered a very humorous analysis of Gerald Ford's inept line of interrogation during the Warren Commission's investi- gation of John F. Kennedy's assassina- tion. There was a very witty account of Hubert Humphrey's everchanging 1968 campaign speeches on bussing. And then Sahl rendered very funny comments on a host of other politicians, including Spiro Agnew and Richard Nixon. 41 Mike Williams Returns To USL You can't be good and righteous When your lungs are full of sin. And once you start, you're finished, 'Cause the weed always wins. excerpt from \"The Weed Always Wins\" by Mike Williams Mike Williams, a gifted vocalist and composer, appeared in the USL Union Ballroom.on three consecutive evenings last Sep- tember. The rugged singer per- formed country-flavored mate- rial, the majority being his own original work. Williams offered several humorous songs such as \"The Weed Always Wins\" and \"Trapeze Lady.\" And he also received much applause for a number of more serious compos- itions he sang. The most notable of these being John Denver's \"Catch Another Butterfly\" and his \"Decisions.\" Mike Williams is no longer a stranger to USL students, since he also appeared in Lafayette a couple of years ago with a group called Colours. He also paid another visit to the university last October. Williams returned for an outdoor concert on campus. Katie And Mary . . The transition today among most musical artists — whether they be single performing artists, duos, trios, or large groups — is the establishment of a closeness, a personal feeling between themselves and their audi- ences. They do not only wish to perform for us, but also with us, so to speak. Since those who do attend con- certs are usually really into music and regard it as a vital part of their lives, a type of invisible bond is created between us, the viewers, and them, the performers. It's such a nice feeling . . . In relation to the Coffeehouse Circuit, this \"together- ness\" is easier to achieve since the musician(s) are dealing with a much smaller group. Katie and Mary achieved this unity here at U.S.L. the week of Novem- ber 5-9 when they performed at various places on cam- pus. They were very informal in their delivery . . . they sang, together and alone, they cracked jokes, espe- cially Katie who was the \"card\" of the duo, and some- times they just rapped with the audience. Mary was originally from Texas, then moved to Den- ver, Colorado where she met up with Katie and got involved in the Coffeehouse Circuit, which sends them to various college campuses across the country. After leaving U.S.L. , they went to L.S.U. to perform for a week. Although Katie and Mary had only been together a very short time, it would be impossible to know it by sitting through their performances . . . they're so natu- ral with each other and contribute equally to the duo. Both of them sing. Mary plays the guitar; Katie plays the guitar, banjo, and dobro. By the way, they enjoyed us as much as we enjoyed them, for the Union Entertainment Committee received a letter from Katie and Mary's manager telling us so, which was quite unusual. •Ml Z ■ r Rallies In early November of last year the U.S. government was in a chaotic and very critical state. The minds of Americans had become saturated with the issues concerning Watergate, while the hear- ings in Washington continued. Spiro T. Agnew had been indicted on committing a number of federal offenses and had lost his position as Vice-President. Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox supposedly was fired by the President because he demanded that Nixon turn over certain Watergate tapes to a federal grand jury. Deputy Attorney General William Ruck- leshaus supposedly was also fired by Nixon when he refused to follow Presi- dential orders to fire Cox. Talk of Nixon's impeachment grew stronger as a number of congressional representatives spoke of their support of any measures which would be taken to impeach the President. The great turmoil in the American polit- ical system finally resulted in national demonstrations in opposition to President Nixon's procedure in regard to Water- gate. Not unlike many other universities around the country, USL staged their demonstrations against the President's policies. A group of university students took part in two very quiet demonstra- tions calling for the impeachment of Rich- ard Nixon. The gatherings were the first of their kind in a long time on this cam- pus. The people who congregated at the two rallies managed to reflect some signs of dissatisfaction with the President, but, on the whole, the crowds were passive and, at times, disappointingly seemed apathetic. 44 Defense For Women Students Last fall women students were able to participate in a course called Self Defense for Women. The course, taught by Patricia Johnson, assistant professor of health and physical education, informed girls on the principles and techniques for self defense. The students learned how to throw their attackers off bal- ance long enough for escape. Dur- ing the fall semester self defense students gave an exhibition of their skills.

To others, it was a boring exposition of meaningless activities. It was a significant and enjoyable few days to seme people, while certain people regarded it as a ludi- crous waste of time. There were a number of panty raids during Homecom- ing week. The girls' dorms were besieged by countless numbers of male students demanding panties. Girls were hanging outside of their win- dows and screaming wildly, as they dangled their lingerie before the crowd of guys below. A Homecoming parade moved slowly through cam- pus on Friday afternoon. The parade consisted mostly of trucks carrying members of fraternities and sororities. There were representatives from many university organi- zations included in the parade, along with the cheer- leaders who led cheers perched atop a Budweiser truck. On Friday evening, fire- works exploded across a black sky, while students ate red beans and rice in the cool autumn air. Later that eve- ning, there was a spectacular show of gluttony, when several students gorged them- selves in a pie eating contest. Before it was all over, there was pie flying in all directions. Homecoming was climaxed by the Saturday night football game. It was, unfortunately, another defeat for the Bull- dogs. Nevertheless, all things considered, USL's Homecom- ing of 1973 was, in the minds of some, a huge success. A Contest For Gluttons? Top: The first-place winner of the pie eating con- test.

Right Guys? . . .610 games of lightning chess . . . from 9 a.m. Thursday, November 8 to 1 2:03 a.m. Monday, November 1 2 . . . passed world record by 5 hours and 31 minutes ... 5 minute break every hour ... 45 students served as judges . . . and what do all these fig- ures mean? They tell us the simple story of two U.S.L. students, Vinny Alu and Pat Brown, who wanted to break the world record for chess playing, and they did. It's really as simple as that . . . they both dig chess and just WANTED TO DO IT. So, they went to Mel Wood, the U.S.L. Union Program Chairman, and he made the necessary arrangements to make it possible. It's a shame more people didn't know about it when it was taking place since it did represent a change in the year after year traditional homecoming activities of bonfire after bonfire and pie-eating after pie-eating. Dr. Nellie Derise of the U.S.L. Home Economics Department devised a par- ticular menu for Vinny and Pat that would provide them with as much energy as possible. Catering Manage- ment supplied the food. And I bet the first question by the majority of U.S.L. students upon the completion of the tournament was . . . \"How many NO DOZ tablets did they take?\" or \"How much coffee did they drink?\". . . RIGHT? ANSWER . . . none. A very reliable source has told me that Pat and Vinny used no addi- tional stimulus to stay awake. The min- imal amount of caffeine in the Pepsi Colas they drank to wash down their food sure can't be counted as a source of stimulus. Also, we hear that Vinny was hallucinating toward the end of the tournament from lack of sleep. He kept talking about Christmas and seemed to forget how to play the game. Yep, Vinny kept playin', and Vinny kept losin'. But they had fun. Above Vinny Alu contemplating one of the billion moves made during the tournament.

Students may just simply go out and have a good time with friends, or they may spend their time in a more intense manner, pursuing their own special interests. But whatever their preferences may be, every USL student, such as those pictured on these two pages, needs to escape the drudgery of studies and just relax.

Weather Report Presents Their Own Jazz Sounds In late October last year Weather Report, a modern jazz ensemble, offered USL stu- dents a fine presentation of their progressive musical styles. Jazz is nothing new to Weather Report members. Miroslav Vitous, the bassist for the group, has played with Herbie Mann and Stan Getz. Wayne Shorter, saxophonist, has performed with Miles Davis. And Josef Zaw- inul, the group's keyboard man, has per- formed with Cannonball Adderly and Miles Davis. The group was formed some three years ago, and their first album \"Weather Report\" won for them Downbeat Magazine's Record of the Year Award. During the past several years, Weather Report members have con- sistently improved their jazz styles, and last fall they gave university students an enter- taining concert exhibiting unmatched con- temporary jazz.

Students decorated the campus, and typical Louisi- ana weather (on again — off again winter) didn't seem to destroy their spirit. Students exchanged amia- ble wishes for the holidays, and Christmas mail began arriving at the university post office The End Of A Semester The fall semester came to a welcome close on a Tuesday in mid-December last year. A semester which seemed too long for some and too short for others was finally over. Students looked forward to a month's vacation. The break between the fall and spring semesters would be used for relaxation at home or travel. On an overcast afternoon students hurriedly loaded their belongings into cars, trucks and vans and proceeded to make their way back home. By Wednesday morning the campus was deserted and quiet. It was all over. rare well. WM Although we have barely started the Spring of '74 semester, here I am writing a \"Farewell\" to all USL students and faculty since the L 'Acadien has to be completed early so that we may all get our yearbooks BEFORE the end of the semester. How's THAT for a run-on sentence?! In any case, I'm not going to write about all the tearful, sorrowful faces which will appear on May 8, 1974 because the truth of the matter is . . . we will all be ricocheting off the campus walls with joy on May 8, 1974. College is a kick lots of the time, but we'll be ready for a change of scenery after the semes- ter. And as much as we complain during the course of the semester and ask ourselves, \"Why in the hell are we here, anyway?\", three- fourths of us will be right back here in the Fall of '74. Unknown Music Student dCdDCMia Commerce Students Applied Theories The College of Commerce prepared students for business professions. Seniors in office administration were placed in offices throughout the campus to gain on-the-job training during their final semester at USL Video tape teaching techniques were used in the typing classes for variation. A secretary's review course was offered to those students who have already completed their training and are on the job. Merchandising majors received on-the-job training by working in local dress shops. Students learned about buying, selling, and even window decorating. Commerce students learned some of the practical aspects of business by learning to use various business machines, as well as, examining the current ups and downs of the stock market. Stu- dents examined business theories through class dis- cussions and by case studies. Some of the future man- agement problems that will be encountered were examined by classes.

Students working on the USL Farm used three methods of culture: soil culture, hydro- ponic culture, and trough culture. The purpose of experimenting with different cultures was to find the cheapest and best methods of producing crops. The Department of Horticulture offered a new course in Ornamental Horticulture for the Home. Home Economists moved toward a new image. Students no longer simply \"sewed and stewed.\" Research became increasingly impor- tant. Nutrition labs conducted experiments using rats. Textile students tested fibers to determine their characteristics. Methods students in Home Economics Education published a newsletter that was circulated to area Home Economists. Dietet- ics majors gained experience in Hamilton School cafeteria. 87 Liberal Arts Educated Students Along Broad Lines Of Learning This Page, Above: Greg McGear, Andrew LeBlanc, Barbara Modad, Michael Meir, Steven Shea, and Greg Crendall acted out a French play for Foreign Language lab.

A screening committee made up of faculty, students, and alumni was set up within the College of Liberal Arts to select a new dean for the college. Dean Sammie Cosper had been appointed as the new Vice-President for Academic Affairs for the University. The curriculum within the College of Liberal Arts was shortened from 133 hours to 125 hours. Two new degrees were offered. Students were able to pursue a Master's degree in Speech and Hearing Therapy. A two-year Law Enforcement Associates degree was also offered. A new English course on motion pictures was highly successful. Students really enjoyed watching old mov- ies and evaluating the trends that have evolved in motion pictures. Many students even became involved in making their own motion pictures as a result of the course. The School of Art and Architecture was accredited. Plans for the new art and architecture building were started this year. 91 Artists Chose Many Modes Of Expression Student Projects Exhibited For Nursing Day Students in the College of Nursing had a variety of learning experiences. They worked in all the area nurs- ing homes and hospitals as well as the mental and pub- lic health clinics. Students also did one semester's work at the Southeast Mental Hospital for Psychiatry in Man- derville. Upperclassmen were allowed to give total patient care. They functioned just as professional nurses would while under the guidance of a faculty member at all times. Student nurses participated in a project sponsored by the Civil Defense in Lafayette. The project served as a training session for all emer- gency units such as ambulances and firetrucks, within the city.

In the College of Education students served as paraprofes- sionals as early as their second year in college. This early expo- sure made education more rele- vant. It also determined at an early stage which students were not capable of being teachers. Education courses were placed in professional blocks to allow teachers in different disciplines to work together. An in-service training program for college pro- fessors on career education was started. Finally, an in-depth study of performance-based teacher education was conducted by the College of Education.

Education Majors Prepared To Teach Engineering Projects Stressed Realism Electrical Engineering Students con- ducted a special project this year. They repaired the digital computers which were donated to the College of Engineering. The Mechanical Engineering Department intro- duced freshman design projects into the curriculum. These projects allowed fresh- men to develop innovative approaches to engineering problems and to get more real- istic ideas as to what engineering really is. Throughout the college more emphasis was placed on continuing education. Review courses were given to prepare engineers to receive professional registration. In keeping up with the times a course in metric units was offered. Above: Trudy Latalier, Charles Bush, John Johnson, Robert Hasling, and Ronald Mistrot demonstrated a bicycle generator constructed by electrical engineering majors. By pedaling the bicycle as fast as possible 10 to 12 warts of power was generated. The light bulb went on and the demonstration was a success!!

A new President, Dr. Ray Authement, was appointed. Three Vice-Presidential posts were created. Dr. James Oliver serves as the new Vice-President for Administrative Affairs. Dr. Sammy Cosper serves as the Vice-President for Academic Affairs. Dr. Jack Testerman serves as Vice-President for University Relations. The three offices were created to cover all university operations. Above: Dr. Clyde L. Rougeou, President of USL, con- ferred with the newly appointed president, Dr. Ray Authement.

Such is a brief but typical conversation experienced by all yearbook workers, and the answer is, \"We do everything!\" \"The World of Yearbook\" is extremely technical, but, most importantly, it is challenging. A person in charge of a particular section is responsible for all picture-taking, arrangement of material on the pages, and alf written information. The more one learns about a yearbook and \"what makes it tick,\" the more there is to learn. Come on by . . .

Featuring news (which derives from North, East, West, and South), editorials (sly, witty, and insane), a few \"good sport\" pages, and an entertainment section which has all the pomp and splendor of a stale bologna and marshmallow sandwich, the stu- dent newspaper provides U.S.L. readers with a viable answer to the question: \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\" Marvin Gardens, assistant entertainment editor, who moonlights as a pooka, sums up the Vermillion's role at U.S.L. when he says, \"The Vermillion is the only newspaper in the country that submitted its name for inclusion on the list of the enemies of President Nixon and was refused.\" But then, coupons are coupons.

Bernard Crocker again served as the executive director of the station, while Floyd Bernard was the chief engineer. There were no major changes in pro- gramming last year at the campus television station. Home Economics shows were prod- uced again, along with certain shows hosted by faculty members. There was also a French series presented by CODOFIL. WBJ continued their news and campus cov- erage. Top: Michelle Bonis rehearses for a Home Economics program. At Left: Yolande Allen focuses her camera for a close shot. Ill KRVS Improves Its Programming Under the faculty direction of Dr. Thomas Spann, KRVS, the campus radio station, made strides in programming this year. Dr. Spann introduced a bet- ter organization to KRVS which helped in the improve- ment of production. Bill Wells was program director. News director was Larry Chiri. Sports director was Phil Rodrigue, and production director was David Melton. KRVS tried to broaden its scope of programming. The most successful result of this was the weekday afternoon program \"Soul Unlimited.\" The show gathered a strong and faithful following. Top: David Melton puts in his hours in the new production room ot the KRVS station. Bottom: Bill Wells checks a late-breaking news story. Down The Yellow Brick Road With Dorothy \"The Wizard of Oz,\" one of the best-loved of all chil- dren's stories, was the first 1973 spring theatre prod- uction at USL. The Speech Department chose Anne Martens' \"The Wizard of Oz,\" which is a somewhat different version than that of the film with which all children are more familiar. But the production was successful, and it proved that Burke Hall is interested in forming a stronger foundation in the area of children's theatre here at the university. Top: Belinda, the bad witch (Kathy Hammill) and her cats (Marilyn Pulwers, Debbie Wilson and Pauline Cole) plot against Dorothy. Mid- dle: Belinda (Kathy Hammill) torments Dorothy (Sou Garrett) by cap- turing the Scarecrow (Keith Cravey), the Lion (Ray Gaspard) and the Tin Woodman (Marshall Schwalbach). Bottom Left: Dorothy (Sou Garrett) and the Tin Woodman (Marshall Schwalbach) finally meet the Wizard (Alan Sonnier). Bottom Right: Dorothy (Sou Garrett) helps the Scarecrow (Keith Cravey) to take a few steps. 1 1 3 Shakespearian Drama Returns To USL William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" is a work of complexity which can also be enjoyed on a more simplistic level. The highly dramatic and moving play was presented by the USL Speech Department to receptive audiences last spring. Dr. Ronald C. Kern, director ot the play, chose \"Hamlet\" as the university's official entry into the American College Theatre Festival. The play was also presented this fall to several high schools to promote the interest of high school students in the field of speech. Set designer and technical director for the show was Richard Zimmerman. 1 Top: Hamlet (Joe Daigre) is consoled by his mother, Gertrude (Leslie Eppler) and his father, Claudius (Bill Corcoran) upon the death of his father.

The John Van Druten play, which spawned the successful television series, \"Bew- itched,\" was chosen by Richard C. Zimmerman as the USL Speech Department's summer offering this year. Comedies have been successful fare for the summer months here at the university, however, \"Bell, Book and Candle\" failed to draw the audi- ences that previous Burke Hall comedies have. Richard Zimmerman directed the play which fea- tured: Chris Peterson, Don Ardoin, Kathy Hammill, Mike Jones and Donald Hebert. Right: Gillian (Chris Peterson) finds herself able to concentrate on only one thing, her deep fondness for the attractive neighbor, Shepherd Henderson. Below: Nicky (Mike Jones), Gillian (Chris Peterson) and Miss Holroyd (Kathy Hammill) take pleasure in casting another of their enigmatic spells. \"Freudian Slip\" A Farcical Play \"Girl in the Freudian Slip\" by William F. Brown was presented on October 10-14 this past tall to capacity crowds at Burke Hall Theatre. \"Freudian Slip\" was a very contrived and slap- stick comedy that expectedly proved successtul with Lafayette audiences. The central character, Dr. Dewey Maugham, a psychiatrist, writes a play about himself and a nymphomaniac he is treating. Alec, Maugham's best friend, then submits the play to his publisher who just happens to be the same nymphomaniac Dr. Maugham had been counseling. The play was entertaining at times, but it was also undeniably farcical and too often ludicrous due to the slapstick humor. Right: Dr. Dewey Maugham (Bill Corcoran) accidentally rips the blouse oft ot his ex-patient, Barbara Leonard (Candi Baham). Bottom: Alec and Barbara insist that Dewey's play be published immediately. From Left: Alex (George Bertrand), Dewey (Bill Corcoran), Barbara (Candi Baham) and Dewey's wife, Paula (Karen Wheeler). 118 Inherit The Wind The second fall production presented by the Southwestern Players last year was the powerful Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee drama, \"Inherit the Wind.\" There were a few comments expressing dissatisfaction with the production, but the majority of the other statements made by audiences attending the show were favorable. The play did suffer in a couple of spots, when it became a bit too maudlin, due to some performances and the direction. But the drama was generally impressive and very good. b.b.

Opera Guild. Dr. Paul Nolan of the U.S.L. English Department wrote the lyrics, and Dr. James Burke of the Music Department composed the music. The opera was alle- gorical with individuals playing the roles of mice, Lord Sun and Lord Breeze, to name a few. The plot was simple, revolving around the relationship between two mice, making it an extremely enjoyable production. \"Squeak to Me of Love\" was a colorful production with such impressive cos- tumes and scenery that it seems unbelievable to have cost only $300.00. Such a cost as this was certainly a decline when compared to a past opera, \"Faust,\" on which $3600.00 was spent. In addition, the entire cast of \"Squeak to Me of Love\" was asked by the Louisiana Counsel for Music and the Performing Arts to perform for the school children in Ham- mond and Covington. The counsel provided the Opera Guild with a grant in order to finance the road show.

Guys And Dolls Creates A Success Participants in the U.S.L. Opera Guild's productions have performed before approximately 99,000 people since their first production, \"The Telephone,\" in 1958 up to the year 1970. Needless to say, the Guild has come a long way since its establishment, further exemplified by their summer jof 73 production of the ever-popular \"Guys and Dolls.\" Over $1000.00 was spent on royalties lalone for this production, and it was worth every penny of it. The opera, presented at the Lafayette Municipal Auditorium, was well received at both of its performances, and it brought the total number 'of Guild productions to forty-eight. An interesting bit of information about this U.S.L. production: The Sunday night before its open- ling, several of the \"gangsters\" in the cast sang a popular number from \"Guys and Dolls\" entitled |\"l've Got the Horse Right Here\" on the racetrack of Evangeline Downs Raceway. This was to pro- mote the upcoming performance at the Auditorium and served as a precedent to the feature race on July 1 5 called the Guys and Dolls Purse Race.

It was certainly different from the film version of \"Romeo and Juliet\" and quite lengthy at times, but, after all, it was the first time the U.S.L. Opera Guild had done an opera in a language different from our own. \"Romeo and Juliet\" was performed entirely in French, a commendable accomplishment for those involved in the production, to say the least. The opera was very well organized, thanks to its three-fold direction — Dr. James Burke, conductor; Mr. G. S. Beaman Griffin, producer- director; Mrs. Muriel Moreland, choreographer. Although it proved to be a very colorful production with excellent voices, the question of age, especially in connection with the leading roles, should definitely have been considered crucial to the development of the mood and plot of the production . . but it wasn't. 1 A Top Left: An adorable portrayal of Gertrude, Juliette's nurse, by Edna Perkin as she silences the crowd outside Juliette's balcony.

The USL Dance Concert of 1 973 was a representation of modern choreography as well as a revival of the dance styles of those years known as \"the Big Band Era.\" The variety of the concert was a great success as the Angelle Hall audi- ence was very receptive. The contrasting tones of the con- cert were best represented by Camille Olivier's \"Kaliedescope\" and Joe Stewart's nostalgiac romp. Camille's performance was an exhibition of extremely modern choreographic techniques, while Stewart's number, \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,\" satirized entertainers of the thirties and forties by depict- ing such personalities as; Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire, Shirley Tem- ple and above all, the Andrew Sis- ters. The concert was the second of three programs presented by the USL Dance Department each year, and it was under the direction of Mrs. Muriel Moreland.

Dance is a very defi- nite form of art and includes an infinite number of themes, interpretations, and ways of expression. U.S.L. has a dance group that it should, without a doubt, be proud of. On November 27, a Fall Dance Concert was presented free of charge to anyone who wanted to attend in Angelle Hall. It was, to put it mildly, quite a strange and unique production, and very modernistic in its approach. However, too much of the same thing gets old fast. We, the audience, needed a break from the continuous dimly-lit stage, and \"slow motion\" dances which comprised almost the entire concert. Nevertheless, the tal- ent and creativity of all those concerned was superbly expressed. Above and left: Shots of various members of the U.S.L. Dance Company, busily practicing in Alumni Hall. 130 New Director — New Stimulation Dr. Brian Bush is the new director of our U.S.L. chorus. Any performing group needs to be directed by an enthusiast who will stimulate the participants, for we all know how monotonous and repulsive a class becomes when the instruc- tor appears to be as apathetic about his course as you are, right? It was wonderful to see that Dr. Bush was feeling every bit of the same nervous- ness that his singers were feeling on the night of December 9, 1 973. This was the date of their third and final choral concert in the Fall of 73, held at Our Lady of Fatima Church. You know he cares The 19-member Chamber Choir sang first, fol- lowed by the large U.S.L. Chorale. Both groups had been practicing for approximately one month, the Chorale practicing three times a week and the Chamber Choir practicing twice a week. Each of the singers received one credit for partici- pating in the chorus. A very enjoyable performing group. . . The above picture of the U.S.L. Chorale was taken on the night of December 9, 1973 at Our Lady of Fatima Church during their Christmas performance. 131 Yes, this is the back of Dr. James Burke's head, the faithful and extremely competent director of our U.S.L. Symphonic Orchestra. The orchestra members play for all U.S.L. Guild productions, for Lafayette's Mardi Gras festivities, and hold their own perform- |ances . . . a very capable and talented ™ group of musicians. The U.S.L. Chamber Symphony Orchestra Same Pictures . . . Different Band \"We've come a long way, baby?\" . . . that may be a sick expression, but it's a pleasant fact in respect to the U.S.L. band. Did you know that the band has tripled in size over the past three years? And what about the fact that our band is the second largest in the state next to L.S.U. and has 200 members? AND . . . most remarkable of all . . . did you know that more than 50% of the band members aren't even music majors and WANT to be members of the band because they enjoy it? They certainly couldn't be in the band for the money, since they only get $75.00 a year, or for a scholarship, since none are offered to band members. And they surely wouldn't be doing it for the single credit they get each semester for being a member. It has taken U.S.L. a long time to build a band of this caliber, but, says director James Goodman, it has truly been worth it. The result is a skillful band as well as a devoted one. Above: The U.S.L. Band during \"Days of Future Passed.\" Right: Lucieu Bertrand, a former member of the U.S.L. Band of long ago. Gone . . . But Not Forgotten! School's Winningest Coach Asked To Resign r Thirteen years of coaching USL football, including team conference titles, guiding all-conference stars, switching from Gulf States Conference to Southland Conference, and jump- ing into a field of major college oppo- nents, 1 973 finalized Russ Faulkinber- ry's career as Head Mentor. One week prior to a 0-1 0 season finale, Toby Warren, newly appointed Athletic Director, requested and received a resignation from Coach Faulkinberry, once his own coach. The remaining game of the season was left to Assist- ant Head Coach Dan \"Sonny\" Roy, until Augie Tammariello was named as the CAJUNS' new head coach. Mixed emotions were expressed by many! After a long hard season, this ultimate resignation caused a definite stir in the student body, football play- ers and practically the whole commu- nity.

Victory was not so easy for the INDIANS, as USL put the 1st points on the scoreboard with but three minutes gone in the game to boast a 6-0 lead with Rolando Surita engineering a 63-yard long CAJUN drive for the score. On the warpath due to this feat, ASU took revenge and 1 st quarter action ended 7-6 in favor of the INDIANS. As true BULLDOGS fight back, Freshman Raymond Lation demonstrated his New Orleans scoring style on a 14-yard run after the CAJUNS' Robert Fletcher of Franklin grabbed an ASU fumble. Houston's Rick Azios connected for the PAT, and the CAJUNS led 1 3-7. The antics of ASU's QB now left the BULLDOGS \"pale- faced\" as they produced three more TD's to end the game 27-13. Surita, an Eagle Pass, TX native, led the USL attack with 1 73 total yards on offense, hitting five of 1 5 pass receivers while junior college transfer Kenny Boynick connected on two of five. Each had one interception. Nate Thornton, TB, from Vacherie had 56 yards in 1 3 tries and Lake Charles' Delbert DeVille added 30 yards in five tries. Other CAJUN standouts included Danny Clement of Thi- bodeaux, Safety, grabbing an ASU pass after a tip from New Iberia's David Neustrom which sent the ball sailing high in the air killing the drive.

Much to the bad fortune of our home team, the LA TECH \"BULLDOGS\" overcame a host of mechanical errors and put forth a fantastic defensive effort to blank the USL RAGIN' CAJUNS 23-0. The Southland Conference match took place at Joe Aillet Stadium in Ruston, LA, on September 22, 1 973. Continually granted offensive errors by TECH, the CAJUNS could not overcome the stout TECH defense who at two different intervals produced impressive, but discouraging goal-line stands. Nate Thornton was USL's leading ground gainer with 47 yards on 14 carries. Rolando Surita and Metairie's Paul Hub- bell gained 1 3 and 1 4 yards, respectively. The powerful TECH offense made mistake after mistake, but the CAJUNS of Southwestern Louisiana could not take advantage of them with TECH's defense performing so well. TECH scored in every way imaginable, as their offensive stars sparkled, and once again the CAJUNS went to the locker room defeated, this time 23-0 at the merciless hands of LA TECH UNIVERSITY. Though TECH was thought to be one of the best defensive and offensive teams the CAJUNS were to face this season, the task to prepare for our next opponent was now under- way. Greater pressure persisted as the CAJUNS prepared for their 1 st home encounter at CAJUN FIELD. .et's Get It Together B Rolando Surita attempts to break away from TECH's LB Joe McNeely and go on to gain 1 3 yards rush- g in this contest. . . .

Cleo Samuels took the spotlight as he returned a XAVIER punt 81 yards from his own 19-yard line, with Azios again collecting the PAT. The 14-0 CAJUN lead was proof of USL's control of the game until disaster struck again! A XAVIER field goal and two additional combination TD-conversions wee cessful in enabling XAVIER to take over the game 17-14, as another UflV game ended in defeat.

Ron Gomez, performing his usual task at the microphone, kept listeners tuned in with his accurate account of play-by-play action from Nipped Stadium, home of the BEARCATS, October 1 3, 1 973. The outcome was the fifth consecutive loss for the RAGIN' CAJUNS. Cincinnati's defense bottled up the CAJUN permitting only 14 yards in 46 carries and four yards in the air as Rick Azios, quarterbacking for the CAJUNS, com pleted one of ten pass attempts. The CAJUNS were blanked 27-0. This loss marked the end of the season's first half with a 0-5 record for the squa suffering with injuries and inexperience. Though crowned once again with defeat, the team boasted a \"never give up' pride; a pride to be tested throughout the remaining second half of the season. This second half was to mark a histo uncommon to USL's past 1 3 years of successful athletic performances in RAGIN' CAJUN/BULLDOG football.

All hopes for victory were shattered though, as the CAJUNS fell 20-10 at the hands of the NORTHWEST- ERN STATE UNIVERSITY \"DEMONS.\" QB Boynick led a drive early in the 2nd quarter which enabled Robert Gill to score from three yards out, for the first score of the game. Azios' PAT was good and the CAJUNS led 7-0 at the half. 3rd and 4th quarter action was controlled by the DEMONS as they allowed only a CAJUN Field Goal by Rick Azios for 39 yards. The game was not only a Homecoming spoiler, but USL's eighth straight loss.

Nate Thornton climaxed a 67-yard drive with a 6-yard run for the only CAJUN score. A two-point conversion failed as Kenny Boynick s pass into the ena zone was incomplete. Mike Menard led defensive action with nine individual tackles, and CAJUN David Neustrom finished with eight. Robert Fletcher, Steve Johnson, and Bill Hairston prompted excitement on defense, as well as Steve Judice as he intercepted a MSU pass. Coach Russ Faulkinberry resigned following the MSU-USL game at the request of newly appointed Athletic Director Toby Warren (replacing acting AD Duane Blumberg, who was appointed by President Ray Authement after the resignation of former Athletic £>i rector A. G. \"Whitey\" Urban). Coach Faulkinberry head#d USL football linger than any other coach in USL football hfstdry and also is the school's winningest coach. His teams took conference championships in 1965 (co- champs), 1988, and 1969. Defensive coordinator Dan \"Sonny\" Roy was named interim coach until a new head coach was named.

The USL Soccer Team received much publicity to stir interest in an area dominated by tootball, basketball and track tans. Referred to as a \"friendly kind of fighting,\" soccer first evolved with goals two miles apart; games played in streets from one end of the town to the other, balls lodged in gutters and rooftop; several hundreds of people taking part, with the game lasting all day and into the night. USL Soccer has existed since 1968. Capturing the imagination of the American spectator was slow, but just as foosball (a type of miniature soccer which came to Acadiana) their curiosity was aroused. Under the International Federation of Football Association, the organization is made up of a versatile group of indi- viduals coming from all over the world. Aware that Soccer demands and develops stamina, coordination, agility, speed, courage, determination, initiative, resourcefulness and many other basic qualities, USL can proudly boast a sport uniting individuals from many nationalities to form a team of such high standards of physical and mental alert- ness working together as one unit. : • : w ? -em am ■ \" *\"W!r^«t .A Michel Timmermons, Back, advances the ball into the scoring area for another Bulldog score A*' ■GUM USL Soccer Team, (kneeling, left to right) Coach-player Mohammed Abdesselam, Algeria; Pedro Sierra, Honduras; Brad Theriot, Texas; Garland Camp- bell, Lafayette; and David Montree, Hong Kong, (standing, left to right) David Fend, Hong Kong; Avery Gaudin, Lafayette; John Rogers, Honduras; Mike McCarron, New Orleans; Marian Bose, Illinois; Andrew Ching, Hong Kong; James Trahan, Eunice; and Dutch Donlon, Lafayette.

In three years, Coach Simmons brought USL Men's Tennis from a 0-12 losing season (prior to his arrival) to a recent 1973 South- land Conference Runner-Up title with John \"Skipper\" Hunt named to the All-Conference team. Not only outstanding as tennis players, the USL Men's Tennis Team can boast at least a 2.8 overall grade point average for each individual academically.

Though not directly under the Athletic Department, USL's fortune is centered around young women who volunteer their time and talents to compete in a sport whose popularity is continually increasing. This type of recruiting is pleasurable, since most women join for the enjoy- ment and challenges tennis has to offer them. 163 USL Women's Athletics Alive And Well Thanks to Miss Linda Nance of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, USL does have basketball and volleyball teams.

A record of 1 4 wins and 1 2 losses, USL's volleyball team begins practice in early September, with the season end- ing in November. At this time, women's basketball commences and lasts through March. Besides competition in Louisiana, these USL coeds travel to Mississippi, Texas, and Oklahoma.

A truly united group of girls, Tri Sig has earned an air of respect among sororities in USL Women's Activities. Tributes USL can proudly boast two faculty members who have played an enormous role in establishing student involvement in an intramural program on campus, for students not already in some sort of inter-collegiate athletics. Miss Sandra Wilkinson, an assistant professor of Women's Health and Physical Education, and Mr. Mitchell Thibodeaus, an instructor of Men's Health and Physical Education, have both successfully organized and executed programs in intra- collegiate activities involving independents, sororities, frater- nities, and dormitories. Our school continues to maintain its level of respect .among students when such activity exists. ■ MC€9 i Faces We are nameless, faceless nothings rushing about in our own small crystal teardrop and all is calm. Shake the teardrop and all is distorted and the wild winds bash us about on the seas of our own depression. But you in this crowd have a face and a name. I see by your lines where you have been, tell me that I may know myself. Let me touch you again that I may know that we are all just a little more than nameless, faceless, nothings. Directing a play can be a rewarding expe- rience. One reads the play many times try- ing to perceive how it will sound and envi- sion what it will look like on the stage. Franti- cally, one tries to write the images and vibra- tions down, have tryouts to determine who will play the parts, and leans over the prompt book trying to impart ideas and pic- tures to the actors.

Time passes and actions and lines are repeated over and over. Then something sparks and the play becomes true and meaningful. This conveying of emotions and thoughts from a director to actors can be paralleled to the imparting of knowledge from teacher to students. ■ |\\|ot only does a theatre on the stage but he puts in a lot of work to get it built. The technical side of theatre is one of the responsibilities of a theatre major. He must put in 36 hours a semester with a least 18 hours per show. These hours ar spent on set construction. Under the supervision of USL's two tech- nical directors, Mr. Richard C. Zimmerman and Dr. Stewart Hoch, a theatre major learns aspects of the theatre such as which nails are used for what types of stocks, to the construction and rigging of 14-ft. flats Set construction is hard and aggravating work but useful. It enables a major to express his talents in other ways and widen his knowledge of the theatre. Some do not think the technical side of theatre is all that necessary for a major but without this, who would run the lights or sound for a show or fly the scenery or even build the set? To me, the technicalities are just as important and can be just as much fun as acting. The one difference between acting and technical work is th"
