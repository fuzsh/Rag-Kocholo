        "text": "YouthSource Center\n\nFor up-to-date programs and opportunities, including how to apply and resources, CLICK HERE.\n\nThe purpose of this program is to provide both educational and career support to at-risk youth. CYP provides services to youth, ages 16-24, in two areas of the City of Los Angeles – West Los Angeles and Central Los Angeles, including the Pico-Union communities near downtown Los Angeles, extending into Hollywood and mid-city Los Angeles. CYP operates two of the City’s YouthSource centers that provide a variety of programs and services for both in school and out-of-school youth. The activities of the program are focused on low income youth and young adults who have not graduated from high school, who are not engaged in the workforce, or who are not pursuing secondary education.\n\nThe two youth centers (West LA and Central LA) house a center manager, a team of case managers, and college student program assistants. A Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) pupil services counselor is co-located at each center to help assess the needs of individual youth and to provide access to LAUSD educational services as appropriate. Services offered at both centers include the following:\n\nwork readiness training\n\ninternship opportunities\n\npaid work experience\n\njob placement\n\nfinancial literacy\n\ncomputer literacy\n\ntutoring and homework assistance\n\nmentoring and basic skills remediation\n\nyouth leadership development\n\npreparation for post-secondary education\n\nThere are both federal and local measures for this program. Examples of the measures include placement in higher education or employment, attainment of a high school diploma or vocational credential, and customer satisfaction. CYP has consistently met the required program outcomes and secured consistent funding for over 30 years.\n\nLA Youth at Work, Student to Student, and Angeleno Corps\n\nBecause CYP operates two of the City-funded YouthSource Centers, CYP is automatically eligible to receive funding for a number of other youth workforce development initiatives. Each of these programs has a slightly different design but all of them target young people, ages 14 to 24, and mandate a paid internship. The number of youth involved vary each year depending on funding; we have had as many as 600 youth enrolled in just one summer from all areas of the City. Internship sites vary greatly depending on the interest of the young person. Approximately 100 youth work on the UCLA campus each summer. UCLA worksites include UCLA Facilities, Ronald Reagan Hospital and other medical offices, academic departments, and a wide variety of administrative offices. Off-campus worksites include City of Los Angeles departments, offices of elected officials, City & County Parks and Recreation programs, and other community-based organizations.\n\nLA RISE\n\nAs part of Los Angeles City’s commitment to reduce homelessness, the City has chosen to use some of its allotted Measure H funding to provide work readiness training and transition subsidized employment to homeless youth up to age 30. CYP was selected to provide these services in the West Los Angeles and Hollywood areas. With this funding, CYP case managers develop internships and provide a work readiness curriculum to approximately 80 young people annually. Supportive services such as transportation assistance and referrals to other social services are also available. The goal is to transition the youth into unsubsidized permanent employment, further education and stable housing. We collaborate with several agencies in this endeavor: Los Angeles LGBT Center, the Right Way Foundation and Safe Place for Youth.\n\nCYP operates after school programs in LA Unified School District (LAUSD) schools through a contract with their Beyond the Bell (BTB) Branch. LAUSD funding comes from the California Department of Education. The purpose of the grant is to provide safe and enriching after-school experiences for students.\n\nCYP after-school programs operate in the following schools:\n\nFranklin High School in Highland Park\n\nFranklin Middle School in Highland Park\n\nSotomayor Learning Center in Glassell Park\n\nJefferson High School in south Los Angeles\n\nNava College Prep in south Los Angeles\n\nHamilton High School in west Los Angeles\n\nUniversity High School in west Los Angeles\n\nUCLA Community School in Koreatown (elementary school program)\n\nA full-time site director heads each UCLA After-School program. Staff includes college students who work as tutors and program assistants, teachers, coaches and arts specialists.\n\nProgram activities are designed to meet the needs of the individual schools. Program activities must include academic support, enrichment and recreation. On-going discussions with school administrators, as well as surveys of students, faculty and families, help determine program offerings.\n\nAfter-school program offerings include:\n\nTutoring and homework assistance\n\nCollege preparation, including personal statement and application workshops\n\nTheater production\n\nDrumline\n\nMusic classes\n\nColor Guard and Drill Team\n\nDance\n\nLeadership\n\nSports clubs\n\nFitness training\n\nMentoring\n\nCyber security\n\nCollege classes in partnership with community colleges\n\nActivities developed specifically for English language learners\n\nJK Livin’ Fitness Program, offered at Hamilton High School to introduce students to healthy living, funded by Just Keep Livin’ Foundation\n\nCYP has many partner agencies and varying degrees of collaboration with each. In addition to our many individual relationships, CYP is a leading agency in a new initiative. The City Economic and Workforce Development Department (EWDD) has organized a pilot program called P3, the goal of which is to leverage resources of many agencies to provide holistic services to each youth. All of the City and County agencies have signed on to this initiative. UCLA CYP is the lead agency/facilitator for the west and central regions of Los Angeles. We meet once a month to discuss new programs available to youth, new processes for referrals and collaboration and actual case studies of youth that need services.\n\nThe group includes about 30 agencies including:\n\nYouthBuild\n\nLA County Office of Education\n\nLA County Department of Public Social Services\n\nLA County Dept. of Mental Health\n\nVolunteers of America\n\nCalifornia Employment Development Department\n\nSafe Place for Youth\n\nVenice YouthBuild\n\nUCLA Guardian Scholars\n\nJewish Vocational Services\n\nLAUSD\n\n1735 Family Crisis Center\n\nLA LGBT Center\n\nCentral City Neighborhood Partners\n\nWestside Children’s Center\n\nSoCal Crossroads\n\nHospitality Training Academy\n\nRightWay Foundation\n\nHelper Foundation\n\nPlus, several others who attend sporadically"
