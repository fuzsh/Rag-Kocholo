They are also less likely to have a primary care provider and have higher chronic conditions (i.e., heart disease, diabetes, cancer, asthma, and HIV). Over time, we hope to be instrumental in preventing illnesses and improving the quality of life of our clients and have helped many to cope with chronic diseases. As a collective, we hope to bring greater diversity to the health industry, and we work to reduce the number of uninsured Americans and address health disparities.\n\nIf you are in medical, public health, nutrition, or behavioral health and are passionate about helping our community by serving on this advisory board, please send an email to kea@sdul.org.\n\nThe Community Health Worker Vaccination Assistance, Communication, and Outreach Services (“Project”) has established a relationship with the County of San Diego as a contractor for the Project. Using a promotoras model, community health workers, considered trusted messengers, provided wellness check-ins with community members to educate them about COVID and encourage vaccinations and testing. The Urban League of San Diego County serves as a sub-contractor under Mid-City CAN execute the services. The County of San Diego has awarded Mid-City CAN Contract 564614 Community Health Worker Vaccination Assistance, Communication, and Outreach Services because of its expertise in community-based communication and outreach by utilizing the Community Health Worker (CHW) Promotores model.

ULSDC’s partners include the African American Association of Educators (AAE); Mental Health of America, San Diego; the NAACP San Diego Branch, and many others. Health and wellness outreach efforts are among ULSDC’s core work.
