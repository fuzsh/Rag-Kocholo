        "text": "Legislative definitions of an agency of the federal government of the United States are varied, and even contradictory. The official United States Government Manual offers no definition. While the Administrative Procedure Act definition of \"agency\" applies to most executive branch agencies, Congress may define an agency however it chooses in enabling legislation, and through subsequent litigation often involving the Freedom of Information Act and the Government in the Sunshine Act. These further cloud attempts to enumerate a list of agencies.\n\nThe executive branch of the federal government includes the Executive Office of the President and the United States federal executive departments (whose secretaries belong to the Cabinet). Employees of the majority of these agencies are considered civil servants.\n\nThe majority of the independent agencies of the United States government are also classified as executive agencies (they are independent in that they are not subordinated under a Cabinet position). There are a small number of independent agencies that are not considered part of the executive branch, such as the Congressional Research Service and the United States Sentencing Commission, which are legislative and judicial agencies, respectively.\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nMain article: United States Congress\n\nThe U.S. Congress is the bicameral legislature of the United States government, and is made up of two chambers: the United States Senate (the upper chamber) and the United States House of Representatives (the lower chamber). Together, the two chambers exercise authority over the following legislative agencies:\n\nThe legislature also oversees the Library of Congress (LOC), a national library dedicated to national records, which administers various programs, agencies, and services including:\n\nGlobal Legal Information Network (GLIN)\n\nCongressional Research Service (CRS)\n\nUnited States Copyright Office (USCO) and the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB)\n\nNational Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled\n\nThe federal judiciary consists of courts established under Article Three of the United States Constitution. These are the\n\nSupreme Court\n\nCircuit Courts of Appeals\n\nDistrict Courts\n\nJudicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation\n\nCourt of International Trade\n\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court\n\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, and\n\nAlien Terrorist Removal Court.\n\nThe United States bankruptcy courts, while not established as Article III courts, are legally designated as \"units of the district courts.\"[5]\n\nThe judicial branch includes the following agencies:\n\nFederal Judicial Center\n\nFederal Public Defender Organizations\n\nJudicial Conference of the United States\n\nAdministrative Office of the United States Courts\n\nOffice of Court Administration\n\nOffice of Defender Services\n\nOffice of Facilities and Security\n\nOffice of Finance and Budget\n\nOffice of the General Counsel\n\nOffice of Human Resources\n\nOffice of Information Technology\n\nOffice of Internal Services\n\nOffice of the Judicial Conference Executive Secretariat\n\nOffice of Legislative Affairs\n\nOffice of Judges Programs\n\nProbation and Pretrial Services System\n\nOffice of Public Affairs\n\nMarshal of the United States Supreme Court\n\nSupreme Court Police\n\nUnited States Sentencing Commission\n\nThe President of the United States is the chief executive of the federal government. He is in charge of executing federal laws and approving, or vetoing, new legislation passed by Congress. The President resides in the Executive Residence (EXR) maintained by the Office of Administration (OA).\n\nTo effectively run the country's affairs, the President also maintains councils regarding various issues, including:\n\nAgency Principal executive Incumbent National Security Council Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan National Space Council Executive Secretary of the National Space Council Chirag Parikh[6] Homeland Security Council[a] Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism[b] Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall Council of Economic Advisers Chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Cecilia Rouse Council on Environmental Quality Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality Brenda Mallory President's Intelligence Advisory Board Chairman of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board TBD Executive Residence Staff and Operations White House Chief Usher Robert B.
