        "text": "The general objective of tree pruning is to prune a tree’s branches so that it will remain in compliance with the minimum clearance requirements for the annual cycle. SDG&E will return to the same area the following year to inspect the trees for compliance. Generally, your tree will be pruned to a clearance of at least 10 feet from the power lines. Required clearances can be much greater due to growth, the presence of a hazardous condition or to achieve proper pruning cuts.\n\nSDG&E prunes trees for safety, compliance, and tree health, not for aesthetics. Some trees are candidates for removal rather than pruning. There are several possible reasons. A tree may be a fast-growing species requiring continuous pruning, or it could be diseased, dying or pose a significant threat to the power lines.\n\nAll pruned branches smaller than approximately 5 inches in diameter are chipped into mulch on-site. The property owner has the option of keeping the mulch chips, or the contractor will haul them away. Tree branches and logs larger than approximately 5 inches in diameter are cut into rounds small enough to be moved and left on the property for use by the property owner.\n\nWe understand that property owners value their privacy. You’re likely to see a Pre-Inspector, who inspects each of the 500,000 trees along our power lines, every year. When tree pruning is required, the tree pruning contractor will notify a customer approximately 2-3 months after the inspection activity. If there are utility poles on your property that require clearing, you will also receive a visit from a Pole Clearing crew that clears a 10-foot radius around each pole down to bare mineral soil. This pole clearing work is often re-inspected and re-cleared more than once per year. You may also see Quality Assurance inspectors inspect a sampling of all work previously performed."
