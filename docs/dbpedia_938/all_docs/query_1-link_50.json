        "text": "“Bilingual and Culturally-Relevant Services”\n\nSocial Services provides a broad range of programs that aim to improve the well-being of individuals, families and communities, while maintaining an affordable pricing model for our community members. Our programs include:\n\nSocial Services at our Andrea Skorepa Social Services Office:\n\nIncome tax assistance\n\nHousing referrals and services\n\nPassport applications\n\nSentri/ and Global Entry application assistance\n\nPublic benefits enrollment assistance\n\nTranslation services and emergency services\n\nBasic immigration benefit applications assistance by our DOJ certified team.\n\nSenior Services: “Taking Care of Our Elders”\n\nCasa Familiar is dedicated to serving older adults by providing wraparound services at senior residential centers throughout the community. We provide onsite social services, personal development classes and workshops, assistance with social benefit program applications and advocacy, and physical and recreational activities to nurture a happier and healthier senior community.\n\nSenior Social Services\n\nMedicare & Medi-Cal Application and Advocacy Assistance\n\nTechnology Use and Literacy Workshops\n\nTranslation and assistance with correspondence, bill-pay and utility pricing assistance, and budgeting\n\nResources for a variety of State and Federal Programs for Seniors and Low Income Individuals\n\nSenior Social/Emotional Support Activities*\n\nDance Exercise & Fitness Classes\n\nBingo and Lotería\n\nBook Clubs\n\nArts & Crafts\n\nFood delivery programs and partnerships\n\nSocial Interaction Activities\n\n“Lifelong Learning”\n\nCasa Familiar’s education programs serve as lifelong learning opportunities ranging from naturalization classes to self-care including creative workshops and seasonal classes for youth, adults and seniors. Casa recognizes the need for continued virtual and in person educational programming to best suit the needs of the community. We continue to address the digital divide in much of our direct services while integrating technology education in various aspects of our work, especially with our most vulnerable populations. Access to Internet, devices, and the ability to manage connectivity enhances communication with supportive networks as well as services or informative updates offered by both County and City of San Diego.\n\nYouth Services\n\nWe champion each child’s unique potential by offering a chance for advocacy, cultural enrichment and artistic exploration through these diverse avenues. We aim to cultivate confidence, creativity, leadership skills, and a sense of community. As we connect youth with community resources, we integrate key community partners to provide comprehensive youth programs.\n\nYouth Programs include:\n\nJuvenile Diversion: Provides comprehensive case plans and assessments for youths aged 6-18 and their caregivers, ensuring they receive necessary resources to steer clear of the juvenile justice system.\n\nHigher Education: We offer guidance and resources to support youth’s pursuit of post-secondary education, and career exploration ensuring they are well-equipped and empowered to take their next steps toward higher learning and future success.\n\nCommunity Service: Opportunities for youth to enhance their community using aquired leadership and advocacy skills.\n\nS.T.E.A.M. Projects: Foster imagination in science while considering a cultural lens and the support of key community partners.\n\nYouth Summer Camp: Outdoor adventures and enriching activities which build long lasting memories. Explore creativity, confidence and friendship in a supportive environment.\n\nDomestic Violence Prevention\n\nThe Domestic Violence (DV) Prevention Program at Casa Familiar, in collaboration with local community partners, works to end the cycle of violence and build awareness around DV. We provide access to resources and space to begin the process of healing.\n\nOne of our projects, is the intentional discussion guide connected to Etapas de Valor, a play curated within the San Ysidro Domestic Violence Prevention Collaborative, that spreads awareness, breaks traumatic cycles, pushes for accountability, inspires, affirms, and motivates victims and survivors of DV. The guide offers a prevention course of action, and serves as a mental, emotional, physical support system.\n\nClaiming Our Right to a Safe & Sustainable Environment\n\nEnvironmental Justice is critical to address the impacts of climate change in the most vulnerable communities. Casa Familiar leverages community engagement, data and resources to focus on the environmental challenges specific to our border region.\n\nOur goal is to foster a healthy and sustainable quality of life through advocacy, transportation justice, equitable climate policies and green workforce development programs.\n\nAir Quality\n\nAir pollution is one of the biggest concerns for San Ysidro. The community is dissected by three highways and situated at the busiest land port of entry in the Western Hemisphere. As a result, San Ysidro has the highest traffic count in California with over 60,000 cars crossing the border daily, leaving the community with a disproportionate amount of negative health impacts. Since 2008, Casa Familiar has conducted air quality studies to access resources and implement strategies that will reduce air pollution.\n\nCasa Verde Initiative\n\nCasa Verde is a workforce development program designed to give extensive training on Environmental Justice principles, community organizing, and climate change impacts at the border region. Through this program, interns undertake service-learning projects that empower them with hands-on experience to address and advocate for environmental concerns. This program serves as an entry point to the environmental justice movement and connection to green jobs and opportunities.\n\nWe want to help connect you with trainings and entry level opportunities within the environment science field.

Our portfolio includes sole owned properties in National City, Chula Vista, and San Ysidro including residential and mixed use commercial properties. Casa is experienced in mid-sized development projects using the New Markets Tax Credit finance structure as well as GMP in several Low-Income Tax Credit projects.\n\nCasa’s current focus and advocacy efforts include the development of a Community Land Trust and permanent affordable housing solutions. We independently own 12 properties in the South Bay region of San Diego.\n\nInquire about our waiting list for affordable housing opportunties:\n\nEmail Our Property Manager »"
