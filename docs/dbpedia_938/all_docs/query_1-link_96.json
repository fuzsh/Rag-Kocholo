San Diego has a mild Mediterranean climate with year-round sunshine that allows for outdoor activities such as hiking, golfing, and beach-going throughout the year.

The San Diego area lies between a Mediterranean climate to the north and a semi-arid climate to the south and east. As a result, the area enjoys beautiful weather, including warm, dry summers and cool, mild winters. Many consider San Diego to have one of the best summer climates in America. Like the rest of Southern California, San Diego's coastal location provides the area with several microclimates. During early summer, the beach typically experiences a thick marine layer, creating a cloudy, foggy effect, while just five miles inland, the sun is shining brightly. The coast also serves as a moderating influence for San Diego therefore it experiences less temperature fluctuations than communities further inland.\n\nSan Diego lies on approximately 200 deep canyons and hills separated by mesas, creating a hilly landscape throughout the city. Residents of active adult communities in the San Diego area also enjoy fabulous views of the mountain peaks that include Cowles Mountain, Black Mountain, the Cuyamaca Mountains, and the Laguna Mountains. Active adults in the San Diego area can also enjoy the Cleveland National Forest which is just thirty minutes away.\n\nRecreation, Culture & Entertainment Near San Diego\n\nThe available activities in the San Diego area are plentiful.

History buffs can wander through the USS Midway Museum before enjoying dinner at one of the city's highly-regarded restaurants. Sports fans can enjoy a game at the park with the San Diego Padres or the San Diego Chargers.\n\nMany areas in the San Diego area offer their own unique attractions. Old Encinitas Historic Downtown District is one popular destination that is full of interesting boutiques and moderately-priced restaurants. Other nearby Southern California attractions include the San Diego Zoo, Sea World, the Wild Animal Park and Seaport Village.\n\nSan Diego Cost of Living & Taxes\n\nSan Diego, like the rest of the state, is more expensive than the rest of the country. On average, San Diego's cost of living is 25.7 percent more than the national average but is 4.2 percent less expensive than California as a whole. San Diego has an 8 percent sales tax, a 1.7 percent property tax rate, and taxes pension income.
