        "text": "This November, we celebrate one year of Trolley service to UTC along the UC San Diego Blue Line extension. The Mid-Coast extension has proven to be a popular route, with the UC San Diego Blue Line seeing a 73% increase in ridership since its opening. Over 53,000 trips have occurred and 1.7 million car miles which would be equal to going to the moon and back 3.5 times! 19% of Blue Line ridership takes place along the Mid-Coast extension and accounts for 12% of all Trolley trips.\n\nOpportunity\n\nFor 40 years, the San Diego Trolley has been creating new opportunities for people. And now, it is linking our most dynamic communities in San Diego. The Trolley’s UC San Diego Blue Line will go from the border with Mexico, through downtown and all the way to UTC. It connects people with opportunities for jobs, education, healthcare, shopping and entertainment. Take an awe-inspiring ride and experience all the opportunities for yourself.\n\nView the Trolley schedule and connecting bus schedules:\n\nBus and Trolley Schedules\n\nApproximate times between top destinations along the UC San Diego Blue Line include:\n\nRoute Trip Time San Ysidro – UTC 1 hour 23 minutes Chula Vista (H Street) – UTC 1 hour 7 minutes Old Town – UTC 26 minutes National City (8th Street) – UC San Diego 53 minutes Downtown (Santa Fe Depot) – UC San Diego 29 minutes Balboa Ave – UC San Diego 11 minutes\n\nBetter Bus Connections\n\nMTS listened to the community through an extensive rider and public outreach effort between 2018-2021 to collect ideas about improving bus service to coincide with the UC San Diego Blue Line Trolley opening. As a result, MTS enhanced the existing bus network by modifying more than 30 bus route schedules to include better frequencies, better beach access, faster service and more!
