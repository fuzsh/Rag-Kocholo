The best private sector organizations understand that increased employee engagement and satisfaction lead to better performance and outcomes, and federal leaders need to follow suit by placing greater emphasis on improving the workforce and the workplace culture.\n\nThe 2023 government-wide Best Places to Work employee engagement and satisfaction score is 65.7 out of 100, a 2.3-point increase from 2022 that reverses the general trend of declining scores since 2020."
