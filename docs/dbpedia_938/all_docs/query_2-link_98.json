A quorum of the council shall consist of seven (7) members and any member may call for a roll call on the question of the presence of a quorum.

The decision of the chair may be appealed, but no appeal shall be considered unless properly seconded. No other business except a motion to adjourn or to lie on the table shall be in order until the question on appeal has been decided. Prior to the vote, the proponent of the motion, order or resolution shall have three (3) minutes to explain the issue and the need for the City Council to take action on the matter.

Items not acted upon at that week’s meeting will not be included in the minutes of the meeting and remain in committee for action at a later time through the regular committee report process. Committee chairs wanting to take action on matters included in this portion of the agenda shall call for the item during that portion of the meeting and ask for action and present a committee chair report recommending action at the meeting. The committee report will be entered into the record of the meeting.

If the Clerk’s Office decides to post only a portion of an agenda item due to length, they must make a note on the attachment that the attachment is incomplete, and direct viewers to contact their office for the full document. Revised or amended dockets and late file matters shall be posted with the meeting minutes within forty-eight (48) hours of the conclusion of the meeting.\n\nCorrections as to Form\n\nRule 14. The clerk, with the assistance of corporation counsel if necessary, may make changes to correct the form of legislation once passed, but prior to its presentation to the mayor, provided however that its substance is not affected.\n\nItems of the Same Matter\n\nRule 15. In the event that an ordinance, order, resolution, petition, amendment, authorization, agreement or motion concerning the same or similar subjects are filed with the clerk for consideration by the council, the clerk, in consultation with the council president, shall cause to have entered on the agenda only that resolution or order which was first filed. The name of the sponsor(s) to the similar resolution or order may be added as a sponsoring member to the resolution or order which is placed on the agenda if at the same meeting. Such action, however, shall not preclude any member from offering an amendment to the resolution or order.\n\nRemoval from the Consent Agenda\n\nRule 16. Resolutions of condolences and congratulations filed in accordance with Rule 37 shall be listed upon the consent agenda. Any member of the council may object to the clerk upon such a filing. The matter being objected to shall be removed from the consent agenda and placed on the agenda of the regular council business. No such resolution shall bear the name of any councilor not indicating consent to sponsorship.\n\nAll matters contained on the consent agenda shall be read as one and the question of adoption and passage of all said matters shall be by a single motion. The question shall be put as follows:\n\n\"The question now comes on approval of the various matters contained within the consent agenda.\"\n\nOrder of Business and Debate\n\nRule 17.

A motion to adjourn shall be in order at any time except on an immediate repetition or pending a verification of a vote; and that motion, the motion to lie on the table, the motion to take from the table, and the motion for the previous question shall be decided without debate.\n\nRemanding Matters to the Mayor\n\nRule 21. Any order, ordinance, resolution, vote, or other measure submitted by the mayor shall be rejected without prejudice, unless when it is filed with the clerk, it bears the certificate of the corporation counsel that, if adopted or passed in the form submitted by the mayor, it will be in accordance with the law.

Any member offering a filing referred to a committee may request that the chair of the committee set, within thirty days, a mutually agreeable date for a hearing. No hearing may be scheduled or conducted without the consent of the chair or council president, and presence of the Chair, Vice-Chair or assigned designee by the chair or council president to conduct the hearing.\n\nCalling of Matters in Committee\n\nRule 24.

Only that specific item(s) for which a committee of the whole meeting, working session, or hearing has been called shall be in order at such meeting, working session, or hearing.\n\nOnly a committee chair may schedule a meeting, policy briefing, working session, or hearing or reserve time on the council’s calendar for a meeting, policy briefing, working session, or hearing to be scheduled. Notice of all scheduled meetings, policy briefings, hearings, working sessions shall be posted by the clerk indicating the date, time and place in accordance with the requirements of the open meeting law. In addition, the notice shall include the item(s) or subject(s) to be discussed. Electronic notice shall be delivered to each councilor and other interested parties by council staff. The chair and members of any committee shall speak and question witnesses for not more than ten minutes at a time. The conduct of members of the public at council meetings, and committee meetings, policy briefings, working sessions, and hearings, including those present to testify, shall be governed by Rules 41, 42 and 43 and shall be enforced by the council staff assigned to the meeting, policy briefing, working session, or hearing.\n\nIn the event a hearing is expected to last three or more hours, the chair shall allow members of the public, in the order in which they sign up, to offer testimony at the beginning, middle and end of the hearing. It shall be at the discretion of the chair to determine the appropriate time and how many individuals shall testify at the beginning and during the hearing with the remaining individuals being allowed to testify at the end of the hearing.\n\nNo committee, unless authorized by an order of the council, shall incur any expense, including, but not limited to, advertising and stenographic costs. Committee chairs requesting interpreter services will work with the staff director, recognizing there are budgetary limitations, to arrange for such services at the time the meeting, policy briefing, working session, or hearing is scheduled. No committee meeting, policy briefing, working session, or hearing, except the committee of the whole, the committee on rules and administration, and the committee on ways and means, shall be conducted on the day of any regular meeting of the council. No committee, except the committee of the whole, committee on ways and means, or committee on rules and administration shall be allowed to schedule or conduct a meeting, policy briefing, working session, or hearing on the same day and time as a previously scheduled meeting, policy briefing, working session, or hearing of another committee. No committee will hold any hearing, policy briefing, working session, or meeting after the last regular council meeting of the municipal year\n\nCommittee Action\n\nRule 35. Each item listed on the weekly agenda that is to be reported out of committee must be accompanied by a report. The committee chair shall draft the report with the assistance of central staff committee liaisons. Committee liaisons will be responsible for keeping minutes of committee hearings, working sessions, meetings, and policy briefings in accordance with open meeting and public records requirements. Minutes shall include the following information: name of the committee, title of the event (meeting, working session, hearing, policy briefing), date, time of the call of the event, start time, end time, location, subject, committee/council members present, a summary of the discussion held, any decisions made, next steps to be taken, or votes taken, a list of all correspondence, documents, or exhibits presented at the event, and items requested by councilors. The minutes are to be prepared by the committee liaison and presented to the chair for review and signature and filed within a reasonable timeframe of the conclusion of the hearing, meeting, policy briefing, or working session, but in no case later than the committee’s next hearing, meeting, policy briefing, or working session on the relevant topic, except if a more suitable timeframe is determined by the council president or central staff director. Reports of the committee chair or the committee must contain the following information: docket number, title, date referred, sponsor, date(s) of hearing, meeting, policy briefing, or working session (where applicable), a discussion of the provisions of the legislation, summary of information received at the hearing, meeting, policy briefing, or working session, and in the case of amended or substituted language, a discussion of the changes and the impacts on the original legislation, and the rationale for the recommended action.\n\nThe committee chair may issue an interim report to provide to the council information received regarding the topic or the status of a docket. This interim committee report does not recommend a final disposition of the docket, and will not dispose of the docket. The interim report will be filed in the same manner as all other documents. It will be filed as part of the Reports of Committee portion of the agenda, and will be placed on file. The docket remains in the assigned committee until final disposition.\n\nCommittee Hearings, Meetings, Policy Briefings, and Working Sessions\n\nRule 35A. Committee hearings refer to formal sessions of a committee at which representatives from the Administration, experts, or others from the public are invited to discuss and answer questions regarding a particular docket or subject matter as articulated in the hearing order assigned to that committee. A public comment period is required and subject to Rule 34.\n\nCommittee chairs or a quorum of committee members may schedule a meeting for the purpose of discussing ideas related to committee work, particular dockets, or other topics within the subject matter of that committee. For committee meetings, public testimony is at the discretion of the Chair of the committee.\n\nCommittee policy briefings refer to less formal sessions in which a chair of a committee invites representatives from the Administration, experts and others from the public to participate in an open discussion about a particular policy issue. While there is no formal public comment period, members of the public are encouraged to attend policy briefings, and participate in the discussion.\n\nCommittee chairs may schedule working sessions for the purpose of revising legislation in committee, reviewing a proposed committee report, or to discuss with the committee the content of a piece of legislation. The committee chair may schedule a working session under the requirements of the open meeting law and process established in Rule 34. The purpose of the working session will be to discuss and deliberate on proposed changes to the legislation before the committee. The changes outlined at that working session would then be incorporated into the legislation, and included in the committee report regarding the legislation. More than one working session may be held on the same legislation and working sessions may be scheduled to review more than one piece of legislation at the same time. Subject to the will of the chair, working sessions may be scheduled to occur at times separate from the hearings, or directly afterward. While members of the public may attend working sessions, there will be no public comment period. Public participation and draft materials at working sessions shall be limited to councilors and chair invitees.\n\nCommittee Appointment, Structure, and Role\n\nRule 36. All councilors shall be considered as members of each standing committee. The president of the council shall name those members of each committee, including its chair and vice-chair, who are authorized to vote on matters in the committee. Communication shall be filed with the City Clerk detailing the named chairs, vice-chairs, and members who are assigned and authorized to vote on matters in each committee. All other members of each committee are not authorized to vote on such matters in the committee. A quorum of the committee shall be determined on the basis of voting members only.\n\nThe role of each committee shall be to provide a forum for in-depth review and analysis of all matters that come before city departments, boards, and agencies, and to provide a means for residents to address their concerns with regard to services provided by the city.\n\nCommittees shall focus upon: (1) public policy, (2) efficiency of service delivery, (3) equity with respect to that service delivery, (4) equity with respect to outcome and impact in order to address disparities, (5) cost containment, it being the goal of the city government to provide appropriate services while ensuring that public monies, which derive from our citizenry, are appropriated wisely and cautiously.\n\nCommittees of the Council\n\nThere shall be the following committees:\n\nCommittee on Arts, Culture, Entertainment, Tourism, & Special Events, which shall concern itself with the encouragement of arts, culture, and the creative economy, including cultural development, humanities, performing arts, visual arts, film and filmmaking, music, public art, museums, arts education, arts organizations, tourism, entertainment, creative-based companies, the support and funding of art and cultural amenities, opportunities to display and/or present works, and special events.
