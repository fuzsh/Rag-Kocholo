Mid City Community Advocacy Network approached me with an audacious vision: to collaborate with their youth council to create a mural for #schoolsnotprisons, a campaign with the objective of dismantling institutional policies that are constructed in a way that criminalizes and imprisons youth. By giving youth resources to change these policies, they can pave the way toward juvenile justice reform and end the school to prison pipeline. This mural is just one of the many ways they’ve chosen to get the message out.

The mural concept attempts to pay homage to the 45+ languages spoken in San Diego’s most diverse community via a “graphic garden” of culturally significant flora and fauna, breaking through a concrete message of empowerment: “I am Possible”.
