        "text": "Editor-in-Chief of Israeli news site Yedioth Ahronoth quit this week, fueling speculation that investigators are closing in one of the controversial corruption cases of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu involving the publication.\n\nThe case revolves around an apparent quid pro quo arrangement struck by Netanyahu with the the owner of the publication, Arnon Moses, to provide favorable coverage to the prime minister in exchange for political favors that would benefit Yedioth, which also over other media outlets.\n\nWhile the editor-in-chief, Ron Yaron, did not cite the reason for his departure, he did issue a statement internally to company employees that explicitly referred to the troubling corruption case.\n\n“It’s no secret that in the last year and a half the paper has been going through tough times. Case 2000 landed on me, landed on all of us, out of the clear blue sky,” Yaron wrote.\n\n“The full facts have still not become clear, but enough has come out that we all need to do some soul searching,” he added.\n\nPolice believe that Netanyahu offered to intercede into the affairs of one newspaper in order to give commercial benefit to its competitor.\n\nIn 2017, sensational recordings leaked in which Netanyahu and Yedioth Aharonot owner Noni Mozes are apparently heard agreeing for the Israel’s prime minister to urge US casino mogul Sheldon Adelson to trim the weekend edition of his free Israel Hayom broadsheet -- a deadly competitor to Yedioth -- in return for more positive coverage of the PM and government.\n\nPolice have recommended to the state prosecutor to lodge charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust against Netanyahu in Case 2000. Mozes should also be indicted, they said.\n\nBack when the leaked recordings first surfaced, Yaron wrote a cover editorial piece stating that he was unaware of the arrangement between Netanyahu and Mozes and that he would never concede to such an arrangement that would require the paper to provide positive spin of the premier.\n\n“This newspaper would not have survived that earthquake,” he wrote at the time, as Yedioth is often critical of Netanyahu.\n\nCase 2000 is one of a number of cases ensnaring the Israeli premier and his family.\n\nLast Friday, Netanyahu was was questioned for the tenth and possibly last time in Case 4000 over allegations that Netanyahu made concessions benefiting telecom giant Bezeq's controlling shareholder Shaul Elovitch in exchange for positive media coverage of him and his wife Sara on Elovitch's popular news website Walla.\n\nMedia reports indicate that police are leaning towards recommending a bribery indictment against the prime minister in the case. An anonymous source told Hadashot news on Friday that the evidence is likely to be sufficient to charge the premier."
