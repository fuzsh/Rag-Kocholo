        "text": "Interviewer\n\nLike everything is good for the article, I like it that we can publish everything.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes. I don't have a meeting after this, so we can just go on if you don't have somewhere else (to be)…\n\nInterviewer\n\nYou know, I asked Abigail maybe if she wants to go straight to the top of the tower to make a photo of what we think… because then you see all the Tel Aviv…\n\nInterviewer\n\nI read about you that humor is the first thing that you use.\n\nInterviewer\n\nI think it's a good agenda because during the Corona time… If we can start, you see the question before, yes?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, I did.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo if you want to answer one by one, like you got it.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nI think we can do it normal flow.\n\nInterviewer\n\nPerfect.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nI mean, there are questions that my staff says I should minimize my answers, like commenting to your PM or MPs.\n\nInterviewer\n\nExactly.\n\nAbby Lee\n\nNo comment on domestic politics.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, we're not interfering with domestic politics.\n\nAbby Lee\n\nWe only share our experience in Taiwan.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes. We'll just talk about… And in our experience in Taiwan, really, there's nothing off limits, I will share everything. But I don't yet understand your politics well enough to comment on your PM or MPs.\n\nInterviewer\n\nF-I-M-I. FIMI, it's nice.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, because especially in Mandarin in Taiwan, if we translate fake news, sometimes it translates to the news that the politicians don't like. And that's not a good posture with journalists.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah. And also, journalists, I think… journalism really is the perfect antidote against FIMI. Journalism to FIMI is like epidemiology to coronavirus. So, I hold journalists to very high esteem. Both of my parents are journalists.\n\nInterviewer\n\nOh.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nExactly.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThis is the platform V…(?)\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nNo, this is called Cofacts. It's also a g0v or GovZero initiative. But Cofacts is entirely in the social sector. It's civil society. It's not government run. It's not government funded. But they are the Cofacts people, like Wikipedia, but instead of editing articles, they edit fact checks.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nAnd we found it's not the fact check reports that protects the mind against polarization. It's a process of going through fact checking that inoculates a mind against polarization. So, if all the students can get the experience, like a journalist do, right? Checking the sources, checking the biases, making sure they're two uncorrelated sources before saying something really happened and so on. If they go through this basic journalism one-on-one training, then they become immune or inoculated against polarization.\n\nInterviewer\n\nWow. Very interesting. I read that you have… You made the v- How do you call this?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nvTaiwan?\n\nInterviewer\n\nYes.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIn 2014. Yes.\n\nInterviewer\n\nNational.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's relaxed.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, it's relaxed.\n\nInterviewer\n\nYes.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\n24?\n\nInterviewer\n\nYour age, 24.\n\nInterviewer\n\nYes.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nAnd the doctors tell me that I have a natural level of testosterone between normal female and normal male. So similar to, I remember he said, like an 80-year-old man or something like that.\n\nInterviewer\n\nWow.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, I'm really somewhere in between.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, the test blood gives the evidence that what you feel is correct?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes. So, I don't have in my mind this idea that half of population is similar to me and half is different. To me, everybody is of equal distance.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's very important what you said because most of the… now I made another article with a young, different story, with the young guys, 18, 17, that wants to be transgender…\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nTransgender?\n\nInterviewer\n\nTransgender, yes. And the big problem in school was the families, they left the house, the parents are not happy. And it's not black and white. There is some kind of much nicer with the children, but the grandmother and the grandfather, they are very against this. And we can see this in Israel. There are much more cases that we can say, “thank God, they are okay, they are happy, the family is happy with the decision of the child, the girl, the son.”\n\nInterviewer\n\nBut what you tell, if you are telling all the story and go to check it with doctors and open, open that it's not an issue.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nMy grandma supported me throughout.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThat's perfect.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nMy dad's parents, my paternal grandma and grandpa, are both Catholic. They are very devout Catholic people. And my grandparents helped raise me because my parents are journalists, very busy journalists. So, my grandparents raised me.\n\nInterviewer\n\nBoth of the parents, also the mother?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, my mother is a very well-known journalist.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIn Taiwan?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes.\n\nInterviewer\n\nMaybe give us the name and we give her respect. What are the names of your parents?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, my father is Tang Guanghua.\n\nInterviewer\n\nYou give me the name, right? I will not make a mistake.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nWell, it's on my Wikipedia page, so just look it up.\n\nInterviewer\n\nI will make a mistake if I look it up. You are spelling it out, also the mother. I have to tell the truth, I am the daughter of a very, very special and famous journalist.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nI see.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIn Israel and also in Europe. Noah Klieger is his name. He's not with us anymore. He died four years ago; he was 93. He's very, very nice. I spoke with Abby about the story about the Holocaust and that's one of the questions that I want to ask on this article that we made with you.\n\nInterviewer\n\nHolocaust for Jewish, for Israel, it's one of the most important historic sites. It's one of our, you know, during our life, we together made stories with the survivors every year on Holocaust Day. It's going to be, you know, it's finished. They are old, they are going to disappear. And the witnesses, the witnesses that went through the Holocaust, they are going to, how can I say it, they have died almost.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThey are walking out.\n\nInterviewer\n\nAnd books of history and Iran for the other side that ignored that there was, they were not Holocaust. I spoke a little bit with Abby about Taiwan attitude and I was so happy to hear that in school, there is in history lessons, in books, there is a part that spoke about Holocaust, about the murder of six million Jewish…\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nDefinitely.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThat's so important and now it's connected to your job. Because when there is a story against Holocaust, against Jewish, antisemitic issues, when the media, the Instagram, the Facebook, the Twitter, all what we need, what we have now… I will not use the words in the article fake news because you are not using it.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYou are a journalist, so you get to use it.\n\nInterviewer\n\nFor me, I can use it.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThank you.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIt takes a journalist to say something is fake news.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nExactly.\n\nInterviewer\n\nBut then you fix me and it has nothing to do with me. I'm a good student. I learned a new thing.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, but we are the government officials. Once we start saying this news is fake or not fake, it becomes interference from the public sector against journalism. This is something we never do in Taiwan because it's a slippery slope.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThe next thing would be the ministers wanting to force journalists to change headlines and we don't want to go there.\n\nPhotographer\n\nIt's very important. They are asking us to hear this because in Israel, it's the opposite, the other way around. They are blaming and they are chatting journalists and blaming journalists with fake news.\n\nPhotographer\n\nAnd, it's exactly what you say because in the beginning it's fake news and then they want to shut down the...\n\nInterviewer\n\nTo take out the titles… Our job... I feel that every day I'm going to prison because when I say something, maybe immediately they will say it's fake news, we don't check, I don't check and I don’t do research. But it depends how forces, like what she said, will take it to the opposite and to say it's not real, when it's real.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, what I mean in this reality in the world, what we have in Ukraine, in Russia, in America, in Israel, how do I know at the end of the day that your people in Taiwan got the real message, the real reality, that when they see in the TV...\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah. We don't have an anti-vax political faction. Everybody got vaccinated.\n\nInterviewer\n\nBut when you have in the media, texting like this or photo imaging, and... pictures… in Gaza. A child in Gaza that the army killed him when he was 2 or 3 years. And this is the article, but this is not the real story.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThe real story for this example is that this child was around the bomb, a very big bomb, that the terrorists used this child against Israel to send this bomb. So, when you see this fake... It's not fake news. This is the reality. But when we got it from the media around the world...\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIt's a different frame.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nMy current job.\n\nInterviewer\n\nLike bots.\n\nInterviewer\n\nYes.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, the idea is that if we take things down, it actually fuels conspiracy theories. But if we don't take it down, but add clarification, it's like mRNA, right, who is a vaccine. So people get the virus, but they also get the antidote. And then they become fellow fact-checkers that can contribute to the community.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, this is the secret behind the success of Corona taking care of a new country.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, this is how we fought the infodemic.\n\nInterviewer\n\nProbably this is the secret, like you explained now. It’s amazing…\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, I think the infodemic, according to WHO…\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt’s friendly It's much more friendly than to get the vaccination without asking nothing and without checking the facts. You know, you speak, and my mind says, but Israel, we know that our country is famous with the technology, the high tech, the cyber.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, with the best startups.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, is it right that Taiwan, with the connection that we have with the country, is a good connection because of you?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nBecause of our perfect ambassador. I said that on record.\n\nInterviewer\n\nWe need also a picture with Abby, by the way, I forgot to tell you… We have also, it's okay, we have a picture.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSuddenly it's about you. Would you like to be part of it?\n\nInterviewer\n\nShe is the host, but it's hospitality here, so we have to keep her.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, she is the host.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, what I mean, when you have the connection with the Israelis, the relationship between the countries, you give a lot of fame, information now that we're adopting Israel, I think, because we're the biggest newspaper in Israel. So, when I publish this, it's going to be, wow, huge.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nBig news.\n\nInterviewer\n\nBig news, and it's going to be like a rally, because when I publish this, and you say this, and you're important people for us, that you come and give us this statement, one year from now I will sign you, that we will see this, that we adopt some of the things, the tools that you use in your country.\n\nInterviewer\n\nBut what I want to ask you, if there are tools from Israel you already adopt, or when you come here to visit, if there is kind of a vision of this.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, it's a win-win…\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, we just before this interview visited a great Israeli startup.\n\nInterviewer\n\nPerfect! Can I write it?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIt's just upstairs.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIs it the same building?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, they're neighbors.\n\nInterviewer\n\nOkay.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThey're called Chain Reaction.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThat's nice.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIt's something, I think, really a very good invention, that says, currently, as you know, if we want some big companies to train machine learning models, like ChatGPT, they absorb all the data, they control how to train it, and then they only share it with their subscribers, or people who agree to their term of service.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nBut if I have some private information, and I want to get it into ChatGPT 4, currently I have to share this private information with somebody with the computers that can do the training. But this is private, so I don't want to share it, but this means that I cannot enjoy language models, or latest AI for the private data.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's going to be also in the medicine, probably, or biometric ID.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, exactly. So, for me, personally, I use a very expensive MacBook with 96 gigabytes of RAM to train the model on my MacBook, so it doesn't leave my MacBook.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, according to this method, are you believing that it's important, like we saw in the corona in Israel, for example, the government use the follow me about our telephone, if we were not being insulated at home, if we go to work or to the supermarket, they can catch us that we did something wrong.\n\nInterviewer\n\nDo you believe that when you… with your people in your country, it's needed to use these tools to follow people, because it's against the privacy? So, from one side, you keep the private information, but on the other side, you can use it for following, so what is the limit?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, during the pandemic, that is a life and death question for the Taiwanese people, because on one hand, we want to receive exposure notification, if we enter a venue that has infected people. On the other hand, nobody wants the government, or even the venue owner to know my telephone number. So, this is the dilemma everybody was struggling with. And again, the GovZero community, g0v, created this zero-knowledge way of contact tracing.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThe idea I can explain very simply in one minute. You go to a venue, you see a QR code, and the QR code is a random number. You scan the QR code or you type the random number, and you text an SMS, just regular message. My grandma can use it to 1922, which is your telecom. So, the telecom, yes, it's just it.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo easy and simple?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah. So, you just scan, hit send, and it's done. And the venue owner never learns about your telephone number. If the venue owner is very careful, they will insist that you show that you have sent a message, but because your screen has nothing about you, just a random number they already know anyway, so they learn nothing about you, zero knowledge.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nAnd your telecom already has your phone number anyway, right? So, they don't learn anything new, and they don't know which venue it is because it's a random number.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's not against the privacy.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes.\n\nInterviewer\n\nOkay, nice.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo only when there is an infection, do the...\n\nInterviewer\n\nWhat could be instead of baby? I think you're explaining very nicely.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, yes. So, you receive notification but you don’t sacrifice your privacy. So often it takes startups, innovators, to think of ideas like this, but I'm sure Taiwan is not the only place where the startup people came up with their solution.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nWe read it in online forums in many jurisdictions, but only in Taiwan do we, after three days of somebody proposing this, do we just implement it nationwide with millions of venues, all voluntary. And if they want to still use pen and paper, they can still use it. So, it's all voluntary, but we did that in three days.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, my point is that privacy and public good need not fight against each other. We just need to find the people with the innovation and let them participate, let them direct the policy, let them have the good ideas and amplify it.\n\nInterviewer\n\nI have to ask you, which age do you remember that you start with this agenda, that it's coming to me, that what you're speaking with me all the time, to keep equal, all the time equal between people, to respect people, to think about this kind and this kind in equal way, not from this way.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nNot top down.\n\nInterviewer\n\nNot top down. Because everything that you say, it's giving me this impression that it should be from very small age, not from the last couple years. Is that right?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, I was this way since I have memory. I was always this kind of kid. Because as I mentioned, I was raised by my grandparents, but also by my aunt, uncle, and so on. So, it's a big band.\n\nInterviewer\n\nInterviewer: And brothers?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, a younger brother, one. So, it's a big band that raises me. And because of that, my ideas of what is equal takes care of all the perspectives. So, my saying is that I take all the sides. So, if there is a side in the big family that I don't understand, I just try to understand it, instead of forcing them to accept my view. And I carry that to my politics as well.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIn Taiwan, there are 20 national languages, 16 of which are Pacific Island languages.\n\nInterviewer\n\nHow many languages?!\n\nAudrey Tang\n\n20.\n\nInterviewer\n\n20?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nNational languages.\n\nInterviewer\n\nWow!\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIt's not just Mandarin, you know.\n\nInterviewer\n\nI thought in France there were 10 different... It's French, but it's a different accent.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, my grandma spoke Daiyu to me when I was a child.\n\nInterviewer\n\nWow. How many do you know?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nWell, nowadays, maybe just JavaScript.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nI think in English now.\n\nInterviewer\n\nYou think, you dream in English also.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nI dream in JavaScript.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nBut my point is that if I see a petition from a Pacific Island community, or a couple of months ago, from the immigrant workers in offshore fishing boats, they also want Wi-Fi, of course, and come to ask me about satellite and so on. So, any time I feel I cannot understand what they're saying, I always think it's my problem, it's not their problem.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's a different attitude.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nGo there, stay with them.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt is your problem now. You take the responsibility.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, I go there and stay with them and mingle with them until I can see the world from their perspective. So, that's what taking oversights means.\n\nInterviewer\n\nI don't know if it was in the question, because I don't know if you know a little bit about...\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nWe ignore that anyway. Just ask whatever.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThere is in the government now, because this is the right in the government, there are people there… There are a lot of religious ministers in our government, and one of the big problems is that the religious are very fanatic. The religious are against the lesbian and gay, and all the world... It's terrible.\n\nInterviewer\n\nBut what I want to ask you, on this attitude that you say that you listen to all the people, the different minds, and thinking, this is good to adapt, first of all, even if they are so catholic.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, my grandma is catholic. We talked for hours.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's a passion. What is the tip that you can give us that the people will be much friendly to each other, and even if they think in the Bible it's written, this is against the Bible, against what God wants. This is their belief. We cannot judge them, but they are not respecting our...\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes. My grandma is almost 90 years old now. But I still visit her, or at least video conference her, every week. And back in 2018, she would tell me...\n\nInterviewer\n\nShe lived far away from you?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nNot very far. Maybe about an hour's drive. But I video conference when I'm on the airplane, or in Tel Aviv.\n\nInterviewer\n\nShow her the nice guys in the beach.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nI will actually video conference my parents, and also my grandma, on my flight back to Taiwan. So, we'll see how the satellite connection works.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThat's good.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, during the video calls or visits, she would tell me, my grandma would tell me that, back in 2018, referendum about marriage equality, she would say that her church friends tell her this and that. But she understands I have my perspective.\n\nInterviewer\n\nTo respect your...\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, so we went back and forth many times. And I think they eventually understood that both the people who were fighting for the rights, and the church friends of her, they both care deeply about family, about a stable relationship. So, actually they have more in common than the other people who don't care about family.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, they are actually neighbors, in the ideas place. So, I think the point is that we need to keep building bridges, keep communicating. And this is what Be Taiwan and POTUS is about. It's about giving a voice to the bridge builders. This is like the contact tracing, right?\n\nInterviewer\n\nNot too afraid to make the voice…\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nTo make the voice of the bridge builders heard. Because during the contact tracing, there are many people very loud about privacy. Many people very loud about public health, but we need to give extra voice to the bridge builders that says, oh, we can have both.\n\nInterviewer\n\nFantastic. Thank you so much.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThank you.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo interesting. I think about what happened now with the treatment that we have from Iran. Not just Israel, all the world, I think. What is your attitude when we have the cyber-attacks, also the digital, the banks… not just in newspaper, the banks, the security office, the academic, the institute of hospitals? What are the tools that you think in the digital…\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes. If we collect too much personal data in the same place, imagine if instead of the SMS contact tracing, imagine if all the venues are required to report to the same state database, every visit, every phone number. Then that becomes very attractive to cyber criminals. You just hack into that computer and you know everybody everywhere at once.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's like in a movies…\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nBut because we choose the way to decentralize, to give the privacy in the contact tracing, there's no such hotspots for the hackers, the militia hackers to enter. Now the same applies to all the information collection points, if you overly aggregate private data, there's always a risk of cyber-attack.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nAnd startups like Chain Reaction, their main contribution is to make sure that they only aggregate encrypted data. Even if the hacker, the bad hacker, gets into the data center of a hospital, for example, all they get is encrypted data and they cannot do anything with it. It's like a random number that I just said. So, we need to apply those privacy-enhancing technologies to make sure that when the criminals break into a system, there's very limited or zero damage that they can harm. This is my main agenda.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's also, if I take the tourist department, if I see pictures about places in Taiwan and hostels and restaurants, what is going to be not fake news when I arrive to the hotel and I find, “oh, it's ugly, it's dirty, it's not like in the picture.” How you can take this example that it's also in your cover image, that when we got the information here in Israel, and one of my departments is to publish tourism, to encourage tourism to go from here to Taiwan, I do it also. So, it's very important to me to understand when I'm collecting the database, to find with booking, with all the links that I got, if I can trust it, or there is a lot of problems.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nExactly. And you're talking about aggregated information, that's statistics, evidence for your reporting. But you probably do not need the registration detail of each guest to a hotel, right?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, the point here is to make very clear the delineation between personal data, private data on one side, and non-personal data on the other side. In many digital systems, these two mixes together, so you would say that, “oh, we've de-identified, we've removed sensitive information,” but it turns out from the periphery of those data, you can reassemble who there is.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nAnd if you do that too much and re-identify, then, you know, like a journalist who accidentally reveals her sources, then if you do that for a while, you cannot practice as a journalist anymore because no source will trust you.\n\nInterviewer\n\nYeah, nobody trusts me anymore.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nExactly. So, you need to keep the trust. This is the value of your work, right?\n\nInterviewer\n\nExactly. So, the same for the... Especially this year, you know, because we have so many details and so many forces to take, to collect. But if you make a mistake in this and you base it on something that cheats you, and it's again fake news or fake details that they give to the readers, so nobody wants to read anymore.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nExactly.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThey don't trust me anymore.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah. So, the same for our statistics department and audit departments. Our main idea here is to make sure that we publish data that can be analyzed independently, but with no sacrifice to the privacy of the sources.\n\nInterviewer\n\nYeah, exactly. We are almost finished.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThat's okay. I can do this for days.\n\nInterviewer\n\nI think the time is much more than you give me. You're so interesting.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's a hard one. I need you for... You are now age 20?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\n42.\n\nInterviewer\n\nWhat? No way! What are you eating? 42?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nI sleep for 8 hours every day.\n\nInterviewer\n\nOkay, that's good. Without pills?\n\nInterviewer\n\nWithout pills, no pills. Without weed.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nNo.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, what are you going to tell me 5 years from now? Where are you going to be? In the same job? You're going to be the prime minister of Taiwan? What are your dreams?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, I will keep building bridges. 7 years ago, when I first became a cabinet minister without portfolio, there was an HR forum. And on the gender field, I feel in ‘Wu’, or not applicable, like none. And in the party field, also, none. So, I'm non-affiliated or non-binary when it comes to gender, or party, or ethnic group, or whatever. So, basically non-binary in everything.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nAnd I think 5 years from now, this politics of building bridges, of what I call plurality, building collaboration across diversity, I think will become much more mainstream. It will become an acceptable, or even preferred, political attitude, not just in Taiwan, but in all the liberal democracies.\n\nInterviewer\n\nBut, in this process, could you imagine that because of the bot got inside our life, so much less people will have work, because the computers, the bot, take care of everything inside. So, what are we going to be? We don't have a job, the mind of us will be with the robot. How is it going to be? Because it's already happened.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nWell, automation, to me, I call it assistive intelligence. It's just assisting us, right? It's like this assistive technology I'm wearing, it's my eyeglass. My eyeglass is, to me, a perfect example of assistive technology, because it's very transparent.\n\nInterviewer\n\nVery nice one.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIt just helps me to see you better. It's not pushing advertisement to my retina. It would not be an eyeglass if it just...\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt doesn't have a political...\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, it doesn't have a political agenda.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, and if it has bias, meaning that if it's skewered or somehow broken, I can repair it with super glue, I actually did. [laughter]\n\nInterviewer\n\nOr send it to a fixer.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, I'll send it to a fixer down the road, and they don't have to sign an NDA, they don't have to pay fines for reverse engineering.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThis is a very good example, to use it like a tool for what it needs to be. Very simple.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes. So, all AI need to be assistive intelligence, and we should reject the kind of AI that's authoritarian, instead of assistive.\n\nInterviewer\n\nNice. Thank you so much.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThank you.\n\nInterviewer\n\nReally, it's a pleasure to be here with you. If there is... To be on the safe side, because I didn't write everything because I just like the conversation.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nI can send you the transcript.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThank you so much."
