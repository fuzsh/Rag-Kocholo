Translated from Hebrew, the newspaper's name means «Latest News». Founded in 1939 by a local investor, the newspaper was published in the afternoon and thus became the first evening newspaper in the region. For the first 10 years, the newspaper was published irregularly due to financial problems, it was something like a local diary, it was published if «there was something to tell and something to print».\n\nA new stage of development awaited the newspaper in 1948, when due to a conflict of interests, part of its editorial staff split off to publish its own newspaper, «Yedioth Maariv». A real competition for leadership has developed between these two publications for many years to come. For the first 10 years, it was significantly inferior to its competitor in popularity, but then it was able to become a leader. «Yedioth Ahronoth» remained the second-largest daily newspaper in Israel until 1995. Today, she is known as a major critic of Netanyahu. Another editorial project is the financial newspaper «כלכליסט‎» (The Economist).\n\nTranslate the latest edition of the Israeli newspaper «יְדִיעוֹת אַחֲרוֹנוֹת» (Yedioth Ahronoth)\n\nLatest issue of the «יְדִיעוֹת אַחֲרוֹנוֹת» (The Last News) may be translated in English language now.\n\nFor request latest edition of this media, click «Translate» button in front of the selected translator.\n\nTranslation result will be opened in your browser on new window (or tab).\n\nSelect one of the translators below.\n\navailable 3 translators\n\n⇓\n\nTranslate «יְדִיעוֹת אַחֲרוֹנוֹת / Yedioth Ahronoth / The Last News / yediot.co.il» newspaper into English by Google Translate\n\nClick on this button to begin translation of the media ⇒\n\nRead «יְדִיעוֹת אַחֲרוֹנוֹת / Yedioth Ahronoth / The Last News / yediot.co.il» newspaper online in English with translation by Yandex Translate\n\nFor request translation result click on this button ⇒\n\n«יְדִיעוֹת אַחֲרוֹנוֹת / Yedioth Ahronoth / The Last News / yediot.co.il» in English by Bing Translator\n\nClick on button this for translate media ⇒\n\n...\n\nEnglish version of «יְדִיעוֹת אַחֲרוֹנוֹת / Yedioth Ahronoth / The Last News / yediot.co.il», latest issue from SysTran Translation Service\n\nTranslator currently not available x\n\nEnglish edition of «יְדִיעוֹת אַחֲרוֹנוֹת / Yedioth Ahronoth / The Last News / yediot.co.il», fresh translation by PROMT Trans\n\nTranslator currently not available x"
