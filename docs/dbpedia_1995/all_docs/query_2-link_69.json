        "text": "Of all the relationships in government, the one that usually creates the most tension is with the media. Politicians often fear media owners and act accordingly. This edited extract is from Eric Beecher’s new book The Men Who Killed The News.\n\nHenry Luce, then head of the Time magazine empire, was once asked how he felt about president John F. Kennedy. “He seduces me,” replied Luce. “When I’m with him I feel like a whore.”\n\nThere’s a complicated dance that takes place between media magnates and political leaders. It’s the kind of dance that was witnessed by the legendary London Sunday Times journalist Phillip Knightley early in his career as a reporter for Keith Murdoch’s Melbourne Herald in the late 1940s.\n\nKnightley travelled with Murdoch on a visit to Australia’s ‘bush capital’, Canberra, accompanied by a youthful Rupert, who had just finished school. Knightley told the story in his memoir A Hack’s Progress: “Murdoch [senior] had lunch with the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, and I went along to hand out the cigars and field telephone calls. Then he dictated a letter to his fellow newspaper proprietor, Sir Lloyd Dumas, of Adelaide. It gave a summary of what had been discussed over luncheon, including four or five paragraphs on what the Prime Minister had said about the likelihood of an alteration in the currency exchange rate between Britain and Australia and advice on what Dumas should do to take advantage of the inside information.”\n\nThe world “is governed by go-betweens”, according to Edmund Burke, the 18th-century statesman and philosopher. Lord Beaverbrook, one of history’s great media manipulators, memorised Burke’s thesis and spent a professional lifetime applying it. Beaverbrook was obsessed with the exercise of political power. ‘He has an artist’s interest in it, in its use and transfer, the means by which men can be bent to its purpose, the subtle courses by which it can be directed in this way or that,’ wrote the British editor and academic Francis Williams.\n\nIn a remarkably frank speech in 1926, Beaverbrook described the power of the press as “a flaming sword that will cut through any political armour . . . [W]hen skillfully employed at the psychological moment, no politician of any party can resist it”. He went on: “That is not to say that any great newspaper or group of newspapers can enforce policies or make or unmake governments at will just because it is a great newspaper. Many such newspapers are harmless because they do not know how to strike or when to strike. They are, in themselves, unloaded guns. But teach the man behind them how to load and what to shoot at, and they become deadly. It is only genius that can so load and point. The risks of its control are, therefore, limited, seeing that genius is rare. And this is as well, for so great is the potency of the weapon that if it ever fell into the hands of a thoroughly unscrupulous man of genius, there is no limit to the harm it might do.”\n\nMedia dictators have been brandishing the flaming sword ever since Thomas Barnes, editor of The Times for 24 years during the 19th century, was described by Lord Lyndhurst, England’s Lord High Chancellor as “the most powerful man in the country”.\n\n“Barnes was consulted about ministerial appointments. He was privy to official secrets. The proudest peer in England, Lord Durham, waited in the editor’s outer room to intercede on behalf of a crowned head, King Leopold of the Belgians,” wrote Piers Brendon in The Life and Death of the Press Barons.\n\nThe dance of the go-betweens is an exercise in mutual self-interest. Because political leaders in democracies are transfixed by media coverage, they are easy prey for moguls seeking inside information, favoured treatment, advantageous policy decisions, or all three.\n\nRupert Murdoch wasn’t born when Beaverbrook raised the spectre of a ‘thoroughly unscrupulous man of genius’ in control of newspapers. But little more than half a century later, British prime ministers, Tory and Labour alike, ‘were so scared of blackmail by headline they gave him whatever he asked’, observed former Times editor Harold Evans in 2011.\n\nMurdoch explained his approach to political supervision to his biographer Tom Kiernan in the mid-1980s: ‘You tell these bloody politicians whatever they want to hear, and once the deal is done you don’t worry about it. They’re not going to chase after you later if they suddenly decide what you said was not what they wanted to hear. Otherwise, they’re made to look bad, and they can’t abide that. So they just stick their heads up their asses and wait for the blow to pass.’\n\nProminent British Labour politician Tom Watson, a member of the parliamentary committee that investigated News Corp’s illegal phone hacking, told the House of Commons in 2010: “The barons of the media, with their red-topped assassins, are the biggest beasts in the modern jungle. They have no predators. They are untouchable. They laugh at the law. They sneer at Parliament. They have the power to hurt us, and they do, with gusto and precision, with joy and criminality. Prime ministers quail before them, and that is how they like it. That indeed has become how they insist upon it, and we are powerless in the face of them. We are afraid. That is the tawdry secret that dare not speak its name.”\n\nFormer Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd assiduously courted Murdoch while in power, but attacked him mercilessly after leaving politics. “Everyone’s frightened of Murdoch,” he told an Australian parliamentary inquiry into media ownership in early 2021. “There’s a culture of fear across the country. The truth is, as prime minister I was still fearful of the Murdoch media beast. When did I stop being fearful? Probably when I walked out of the building in 2013.”\n\nRudd initiated a parliamentary petition in 2020 that called for a government inquiry into Australian media ownership and bias. It was signed by 501,876 people, the largest petition response ever recorded on the national parliament’s website. Of course, there has been no inquiry because no Australian government in power would dare risk incurring the wrath of the country’s most powerful family.\n\nOf all the lethal instruments in a media owner’s toolkit, the most effective one for managing politicians is fear — the emotion that “preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails”, as described by Niccolò Machiavelli. And it was surely fear that was running through the minds of British politicians as they observed The Sun demolish Labour cabinet minister Clare Short in the mid-1980s after she criticised the paper’s use of photographs of topless women to sell more copies. ‘Killjoy Clare’, ‘Fat’, ‘Jealous’, ‘Ugly, ‘Short on looks’, ‘Short on brains’ were among The Sun’s headlines during its jihad, which included distributing free car stickers (‘Stop Crazy Clare’), sending half-naked women to her home, and running a beauty contest asking readers whether they would prefer to see Short’s face or the back of a bus.\n\nRupert Murdoch began playing the fear card from his earliest days as a media proprietor. In the 1960s, when he owned Western Australia’s Sunday Times and dabbled in other investments on the side, he met with the mining magnate Lang Hancock to discuss a joint purchase of mineral prospects in a remote Western Australian desert, a deal that was being blocked by the state government. Hancock’s biographer, Robert Duffield, described how Murdoch dealt with the political roadblock. ‘If I can get a certain politician to negotiate, will you sell me a piece of the cake?’ Murdoch apparently asked Hancock. “Yes, by all means,” replied the miner. At ten o’clock that night, there was a knock on Hancock’s door. It was Murdoch. “You’re in!” he told Hancock, who asked: “How on earth did you manage that?” to which Murdoch replied: “Simple . . . I told him: look you can have a headline a day or a bucket of shit every day. What’s it to be?”\n\nHeadlines-or-a-bucket-of-shit became standard Murdoch operating procedure. In 1992, the British prime minister John Major telephoned The Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie to ask whether the paper would be supporting the government during a crisis over the European exchange rate mechanism. “Well John, let me put it this way,” MacKenzie told the PM. “I’ve got a large bucket of shit lying on my desk and tomorrow morning I’m going to pour it all over your head.”\n\nAbusing and haranguing prime ministers and presidents is business as usual for many media owners and their henchmen. When Lords Northcliffe and Rothermere owned the Daily Mail, they acted at times as though they also owned the British government. In 1918, when Northcliffe offered prime minister Lloyd George editorial support in the Mail’s overseas edition, which was widely read by soldiers returning from World War One, he added a condition: “I do not propose to use my newspapers and personal influence unless I know definitely, and in writing, and can consciously approve, the personal constitution of the government.” Lloyd George immediately turned him down, as he did the following year when Northcliffe demanded an appointment to the British delegation to the Versailles Peace Conference. When Lloyd George rejected that second diktat, Northcliffe’s newspapers turned against the government mercilessly. After Rothermere took over running the Daily Mail group following his brother’s death, he informed the opposition leader Stanley Baldwin that he wouldn’t get his papers’ support “unless I am acquainted with the names of at least eight, or ten, of his most prominent colleagues in the next Ministry”. Baldwin was appalled, telling a special meeting of the Conservative Party that “a more preposterous and insolent demand was never made on the leader of any political Party”.\n\nThe insidious power of the media is a permanent feature of political life in most Western democracies. When Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in 2019, it was in part because he allegedly met with media owners to trade favourable coverage in return for government assistance for their businesses. According to the charges laid by Israel’s attorney-general, Netanyahu and Arnon Mozes, who controlled one of Israel’s largest-selling newspapers, Yedioth Ahronoth, discussed in a series of meetings “the promotion of their common interests: improving the coverage that Mr Netanyahu received in the Yedioth Ahronoth media group” and the “imposition of restrictions” by the government on Mozes’s competitor, Israel Hayom. Netanyahu was also charged with proposing a “reciprocal arrangement” with the news website Walla to favourably cover his government in return for the prime minister using “his powers and authorities as a public servant” to promote the business interests of its owner Bezeq, Israel’s biggest telecommunications company."
