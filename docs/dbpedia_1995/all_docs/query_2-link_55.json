        "text": "On February 7th, the Center on National Security hosted a discussion with author Ronen Bergman moderated by David A. Andelman.\n\nIn this page-turning, eye-opening book, journalist and military analyst Ronen Bergman offers a riveting inside account of the targeted killing programs—their successes, their failures, and the moral and political price exacted on the men and women who approved and carried out the missions.\n\nRonen Bergman is the senior correspondent for military and intelligence affairs for Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel’s largest daily paid newspaper, and a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine, where he reports on intelligence, national security, terrorism, and nuclear issues.\n\nDavid A. Andelman is a veteran foreign correspondent, author and commentator who contributes frequently to CNN on global affairs. He is member of the Board of Contributors of USA Today and served for more than seven years as Editor & Publisher of World Policy Journal."
