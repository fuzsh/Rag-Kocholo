        "text": "JERUSALEM\n\nIsrael is spending billions of shekels per day to maintain its military campaign against Gaza, an Israeli newspaper reported on Thursday.\n\n\"The army has purchased equipment on an unprecedented scale for the possibility of a multi-front war at the same time as the planned ground operation in Gaza is underway,\" according to the Yedioth Ahronoth.\n\n\"It is a major armament process never seen before that includes tens of thousands of missiles, bombs, radars, night vision devices, radios, vehicles, drones, and various types of weapons being transported by air to Israel around the clock,\" added the daily.\n\nThe report comes amid relentless Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip following a cross-border attack by Palestinian group Hamas on Oct. 7.\n\nAlso, the Israeli army has amassed tanks and thousands of troops near the border with the besieged enclave in preparation of a ground operation into the enclave.\n\nIsrael and the US are also worried about the possible expansion of the conflict, dragging in countries like Iran and allied groups like the Lebanese Hezbollah and Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nAccording to the Yedioth Ahronoth, Israeli defense industries froze contracts worth billions of dollars for the production and supply of ammunition to foreign armies, at the request of the country's Defense Ministry, while activating \"a special clause in the contracts that allows the transfer of ammunition to the Israeli army in case of emergency.\"\n\n\"The war budget is estimated at billions of shekels per day, net of basic expenses,\" said the newspaper.\n\n\"At this stage, the army intends to keep the 300,000-350,000 reserve soldiers who were recruited at least three weeks ago until next January.\"\n\nThe conflict in Gaza began when Hamas initiated Operation Al-Aqsa Flood — a multi-pronged surprise attack on Oct. 7 that included a barrage of rocket launches and infiltrations into Israel by land, sea, and air.\n\nHamas said the incursion was in retaliation for the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and growing violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians.\n\nThe Israeli military then launched a relentless bombardment campaign on the Gaza Strip.\n\nNearly 8,000 people have been killed in the conflict, including at least 6,546 Palestinians and 1,400 Israelis.\n\nGaza's 2.3 million residents have been running out of food, water, medicine, and fuel, and aid convoys allowed into Gaza have carried only a fraction of what is needed."
