This is according to a survey by TGI, the organization that measures media exposure in Israel.\n\nAccording to the updated survey published on July 31, 2023, Calcalist has reached an exposure of 11.5 percent, compared to 4.4 percent for The Marker and 3.7 percent for Globes.\n\nCalcalist is a financial daily and website, part of the Yedioth Ahronoth Media Corp. – Israel's largest media group. Among others, the group publishes the highly influential and most circulated daily in the country. Calcalist holds a strong bearing on public opinion in Israel.
