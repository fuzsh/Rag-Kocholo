The event will be held at the Streicker Center, co-sponsored by UJA Federation of NY, and my guest will be Amir Tibon on the official launch date of his book The Gates of Gaza: A Story of Betrayal, Survival, and Hope in Israel's Borderlands.\n\nIn his new book, Amir tells the gripping story of the Tibon familyâs ordeal at Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7 and the heroic rescue by Amirâs father, retired General Noam Tibon. Woven throughout the book is Amirâs own expertise as a longtime journalist in Israel and in Washington, the history of Kibbutz Nahal Oz, and the conflict between Israel and Gaza.\n\nThe story has previously been featured on 60 Minutes and it is also being developed in a feature film by Avi Issacharoff and Lior Raz.\n\nWe are excited to bring this program â with our partners at The Streicker Center and UJA Federation of NY â to the Call Me Back audience. To register, please go to streicker.nyc/events/tibon-senor\n\nTODAYâS EPISODE:\n\nTensions have been high in Israel over the past week, as Israelis brace for a response from Iran and Hezbollah, following last weekâs assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and Fuad Shukr in Lebanon.\n\nThis attack was anticipated to have already taken place, and may happen at any moment.\n\nTo help us understand the extent to which Israel and the U.S. have prepared for this new phase, we are joined by Nadav Eyal and Matt Levitt.\n\nNadav Eyal is a columnist for Yediot. He has been covering Middle-Eastern and international politics for the last two decades for Israeli radio, print and television news.\n\nDr. Matthew Levitt is the director of the Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He served as deputy assistant secretary for intelligence and analysis at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. During his tenure at Treasury, he played a central role in efforts to protect the U.S. financial system from abuse and to deny terrorists, weapons proliferators, and other rogue actors the ability to finance threats to U.S. national security. He later served as a counterterrorism advisor to the special envoy for Middle East regional security. Previously, Matt was a counterterrorism intelligence analyst at the FBI, where he provided tactical and strategic analytical support for counterterrorism operations, focusing on fundraising and logistical support networks for Middle Eastern terrorist groups. He is the author of several books and monographs, including Hamas: Politics, Charity and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad (Yale University Press, 2006), and Hezbollah: The Global Footprint of Lebanon's Party of God (Georgetown University Press, 2013). He is the host of the podcast series, Breaking Hezbollah's Golden Rule.\n\nMatt Levittâs Books:\n\nHezbollah: The Global Footprint of Lebanonâs Party of God - https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/hezbollah-matthew-levitt/1114960198?ean=9781626162013\n\nNegotiating Under Fire: Preserving Peace Talks in the Face of Terror Attacks - https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/negotiating-under-fire-matthew-levitt/1100301395?ean=9780742551626\n\n*** Share episode on X: https://tinyurl.com/43epx79k ***\n\nThis past weekend we saw a major and brazen escalation against Israel by Hezbollah. This war front is not new, but it will now come into much sharper focus.\n\nAnd with the slaughter of Druze children, we have received a number of questions about Israelâs Druze community in Israelâs North, as well as questions about the options for Israeli decision-makers now.\n\nTo help us unpack all of this, we are joined by Matti Friedman, who is one of the most thoughtful writers when it comes to all matters related to Israel, the broader Middle East, and also trends in the world of journalism. He is a columnist for The Free Press: https://www.thefp.com/\n\nMattiâs most recent book is called âWho by Fire: Leonard Cohen in the Sinai.â Before that he published \"Spies of No Country: Secret Lives at the Birth of Israel,\" and before that \"Pumpkinflowers: A Soldierâs Story of a Forgotten War.â Mattiâs army service included tours in Lebanon. His work as a reporter has taken him from Israel to Lebanon, and other hotspots across the Middle East and around the world. He is a former Associated Press correspondent and essayist for the New York Times opinion section.\n\nMatti Friedman's published works that are relevant to this episode:\n\n-âThe Wisdom of Hamasâ â The Free Press â https://www.thefp.com/p/matti-friedman-the-wisdom-of-hamas\n\n-âWhat if the Real War in Israel Hasnât Even Started?â â The Free Press â https://www.thefp.com/p/matti-friedman-israel-hezbollah-war\n\n-\"There Is No 'Israeli-Palestinian Conflict'\" -- The New York Times -- https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/opinion/israeli-palestinian-conflict-matti-friedman.htm\n\n-\"An Insiderâs Guide to the Most Important Story on Earth\" -- Tablet Magazine -- https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/israel-insider-guide\n\n-\"What The Media Gets Wrong About Israel\" -- The Atlantic -- https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/11/how-the-media-makes-the-israel-story/383262/\n\n-âPumpkinflowers: A Soldierâs Story of a Forgotten Warâ â https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/pumpkinflowers-matti-friedman/1122279367?ean=9781616206918\n\n*** Share episode on X: https://tinyurl.com/3rwv5yzu ***\n\nA lot has happened over this past weekend, again.\n\nPresident Biden has dropped out of the presidential race, endorsing Vice-President Kamala Harris, who has been systematically locking up endorsements from most of her possible opponents. The ascendancy of V.P. Harris occurs at the exact time that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrives in Washington in advance of his address before Congress on Wednesday. We will discuss all of these issues in our next episode later this week.\n\nAlso this weekend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to bring Israel back to the negotiating table this week for a hostages-for-ceasefire deal in Gaza, ahead of his departure to the U.S. This comes despite a letter from eight Likud MKs objecting to the possible deal.\n\nFinally, and the topic of our conversation today - on Saturday at 3:30 AM Israel time, a drone packed with explosives flew into a building in Tel Aviv, a few blocks away from the American consulate, and caused a large explosion that claimed the life of an Israeli citizen. This drone flew more than 2000 km (about 1200 miles) all the way from Yemen, and was one of four drones sent by the Houthis. The other three were shot down by U.S. forces in the Red Sea.\n\nLater on Saturday, Israel retaliated by attacking the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah, in Yemen. The targets of the attack were oil installations and refineries, the Ras Katib power plant, the HQ of the Yemen Economic Corporation, as well as the national security and military police buildings in the north of Hodeidah. The attack caused a complete power outage in all the neighborhoods in Hodeida district and disruptions in the communication network. This port was the main import access point for weapons into Yemen for the Houthis.\n\nWhile this low intensity war with the Houthis has been ongoing since October 7th, we have not focused much of our attention to this third Iranian tentacle. Who are the Houthis? How did Iran turn this rebel group into its proxy? And what could we expect from this third front?\n\nTo make sense of all of this, we have Ronen Bergman of Yediot Ahranot and the New York Times Magazine. Ronen is a pulitzer-prize winning journalist.\n\nAlso, one housekeeping note:\n\nSince October 7th, we are frequently asked for ways to ask questions, send comments and episode ideas. Listeners are also often asking for transcripts of our podcasts episodes. And many of you also want to know if thereâs a way to subscribe for podcast updates. We are in the process of building a website, Ark Media. To visit the website, go to ArkMedia.Org,\n\nBy visiting the website, you can:\n\n- Get in touch with the Call me Back team and share your thoughts, questions, or suggestions.\n\n- Access full transcripts to each episode, including links to external resources that will expand your understanding of the topics covered in each conversation.\n\n- And sign up for our regular updates on new episodes and live events."
