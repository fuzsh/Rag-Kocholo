        "text": "In the age of globalization, the role of mass media and the process through which news, especially transnational news, is produced is very important. The key players -- those who control the global news system, compared to those who do not -- have the advantage of satisfying their own needs and achieving their own goals. Using many indirect techniques, mass media impose a sense of reality on individuals’ daily lives and affect public opinion about political issues. Inconsistent with the idea of globalization is the fact that mass media in the developing countries, including the Arab countries, hold a position unequal to that of the developed countries. Coverage of transnational news on the one side is, to a great extent, different from that on the other. This paper compares two newspapers of two different political systems -- Al-Ahram, a national Egyptian newspaper, representing a developing country, and The Globe and Mail, a national Canadian newspaper, representing a developed one -- on the basis of their coverage of a specific event in the Arab-Israeli conflict: the entrance of Ariel Sharon, the Israeli right-wing Likud party leader at that time and the current Israeli Prime Minister, into the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Palestine on September 28th, 2000. The main objective of this paper is to compare how two major newspapers, representing the North and the South, portrayed and delivered transnational news about a specific event in two different ways. Both quantitative and qualitative content analyses are conducted to illustrate the two sides of information flow and the main sources on which the newspapers depend. From both newspapers over a defined period of time, a total of 282 transnational news items covering the most significant events, actions, and conflicts and their consequences are analyzed. Findings of the study show significant imbalance in the flow of information between developed and developing countries in both volume and content. Events which happen in developing countries attract greater interest inside these countries than they do in the developed world. While newspapers of both sides play an effective role in directing their audience's attention towards specific areas of interest consistent with the entire policy of the political system, both sides are biased in their concerns. At the same time, however, both sides depend on sources foreign to them. Above all, reality -- in this case “conflict” -- has been represented in different discourses.\n\nThe purpose of this research is to present the role of the Western media on non-Western public perceptions. This research focuses on Turkish image and identity in the Korean media. For this study, South Korean English dailies, The Korea Herald and The Korea Times, were classified for three months in 2007 by using content analysis. This period is an appropriate time scale to identify Turkish image in the Korean media. In this research, we used content analysis technique to classify newspaper articles according to mentioned impact types. Our findings indicate that Western media has profound effects on Korean news media and extensively exerts cultural imperialism. Moreover, we found that Western originated news, published in Korean media, communicate less positive message about Turkey. This research clearly indicates that non-Western (Korean) people learn and inquire about another non-Western nation (Turkey) and its identity via Western cultural representation.\n\nThe mainstream media in the U.S, regardless of the platform, have severely deviated from reporting international news, and have mainly focused on the political divide within America. The election of Donald Trump, and the rise of the alt-right have brought forth an age of media that has moved away from covering foreign affairs, somewhat isolating the immigrant population in America from their families and friends abroad. In this essay, I will address the implications of pushing aside foreign politics, by using the recent example of the turmoil in Ethiopia, and the War in Afghanistan. I will also address the importance of relating public policy to the extent of journalism. The use of framing is also essential in explaining the approaches in reporting significant events. Historical context will also be provided in order to explain to readers the significance of By observing the conflicts within the Horn of Africa and the Middle East, I will demonstrate how the Western Media should at...\n\n\"Political Communications, International Communications, News Sociology, all claim to offer an explanation for what shapes the news, but provide extremely different, if not contradictory suggestions. Political communications almost takes for granted the fact that official actors have a major role in shaping news stories at the national level. International Communications points at several possibilities: structural economic imbalances lead to unidirectional news flows from rich countries towards poor countries; globalization causes news to become homogenized on a worldwide scale; news is geared to the tastes of local audiences by national news producers. News sociology, instead, argues that the news product of each media organization is the unique output of patterns of social interactions among media professionals. An international comparative study of the elite press framing of 9/11 in the US, Italy, France, and Pakistan reveals the limits of these approaches: none of them alone is able to explain the patterns of news contents that were detected in the empirical investigation.The analysis suggests that the content of press coverage in the newspapers under analysis is more effectively explained in terms of selection of newsworthy sources, guided by national interest, journalistic culture, and editorial policy. The study points to the benefit of adopting international comparative research designs and fundamentally argues that, if we want to explain news in the information age, we need to approach its study in a multidisciplinary perspective. \""
