Belgium's King Albert II has asked former prime minister Wilfried Martens to mediate among different stakeholders and explore possible solutions to the country's political crisis, Belgian broadcaster VRT reported Tuesday.

Martens, 72, will try to sound out the possibilities of putting together a new government after the one led by Prime Minister Yves Leterme resigned Friday amid allegations of political interference in justice.

Martens, a Flemish Christian Democrat like Leterme, is expected to seek common ground among the major parties and try to form a new coalition as soon as possible to tackle urgent issues at a time of financial crisis and economic downturn.

He is expected to meet the speaker of the lower house of parliament, Herman Van Rompuy, and Senate chairman Armand De Decker Tuesday. He will also contact Leterme and leaders of the five parties of the outgoing coalition.

Leterme submitted his government's resignation after the Belgian supreme court said there were "strong indications" that his office had tried to prevent a Brussels court from blocking the breakup of financial services group Fortis.

King Albert II accepted the resignation Monday evening after three days of negotiations with relevant parties failed to keep the coalition intact.

The Leterme government, meanwhile, has been asked to assume a caretaker role and handle the administration's day-to-day business.

Leterme has denied any wrongdoing but admitted one of his staff members had contacted the husband of one of the Brussels appeal court judges in the Fortis case.

Leterme and outgoing Justice Minister Jo Vandeurzen have said they would not return to government.

Candidates reportedly being considered for the premiership include former prime ministers Jean-Luc Dehaene and Guy Verhofstadt, as well as lower house speaker Van Rompuy.
