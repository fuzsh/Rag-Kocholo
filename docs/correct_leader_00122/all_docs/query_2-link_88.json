        "text": "CzechTrade is the offical Government Trade Promotion Agency of the Czech Republic. Its main objective is to develop international trade and cooperation between Czech and foreign entities. Wherever in the world you are, the agency is your official contact partner when looking for qualified Czech-based manufacturers and services providers.\n\nCzechTrade Belgium assists Belgian companies in their research for Czech suppliers. We publish your request on a specialized website and send it to potential Czech business partners. The most requested sectors are machinery, glass and ceramic industry and furniture. We also create platforms for B2B meetings and organise bilateral business meetings.\n\nLast but not least, you can join us at incoming trade missions to Belgium and meet Czech companies interested in doing business in Belgium.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\"When we started with CzechTrade many years ago, we did not realise just how much we would come to value the wide range of services CzechTrade offers to entrepreneurs. Thanks to all the deals that have been concluded and progress in expanding into foreign markets, we are now convinced that the key to any export success lies in making sure the mix of activities and the timing are just right.”\n\nMartin Mokroš, Chairman of the Board of Directors at Galatek a.s.\n\nWe use cookies.
