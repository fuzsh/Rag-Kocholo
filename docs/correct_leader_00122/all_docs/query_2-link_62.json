        "text": "Summary\n\nThe Kingdom of Belgium declared its independence from the Kingdom of the Netherlands on October 4, 1830. Most of the European powers recognized de facto independence on December 20, 1830. However, it was not until the Netherlands signed the Treaty of London on April 19, 1839 that the former ruler recognized Brussels as a sovereign state. Belgium had attempted to remain a neutral country for much of its history; however, the German invasions in the first and second World Wars made this impossible. Today, Belgium is a member of the European Union and NATO.\n\nModern Flag of Belgium\n\nHistory of Diplomatic Relations\n\nEstablishment of Diplomatic Relations, .\n\nDiplomatic relations were established on June 18, 1832, when Baron D.
