        "text": "Amazon Web Services has announced it will open its first office in Belgium in 2017. The Brussels-based office will support government organizations and businesses of all sizes, from start-ups to Europe’s oldest and most established enterprises, as they make the transition to the AWS Cloud. The new office will provide a hub with account managers, solutions architects, partner managers, and other functions for all customers to directly engage with AWS in their local setting. Belgian customers looking to learn more about working with AWS should visit this website.\n\n\"We are seeing rapid adoption of cloud computing by the organizations in Belgium,” said Max Peterson, Head of EMEA Public Sector, Amazon Web Services. “Brussels hosts a large number of European Union institutions and by bringing an AWS office to Belgium we want to support the organizations driving innovation while maintaining high levels of reliability and security with the AWS Cloud. Cloud is a major catalyst helping Public Sector organizations save money and deliver innovative digital solutions focused on making Europe a better place for citizens to live and work.”\n\nBelgian politicians welcomed the news of the new AWS office coming to the country. Alexander De Croo, Vice-Prime Minister of Belgium said: “The digitization of our economy will be defining for our future welfare, and Belgium has the ambition to become one of the leading digital countries in Europe by 2020. Hence we are pleased to welcome a pioneering company such as Amazon Web Services to Belgium.”\n\nCustomers also welcomed the news. Amongst them, Belgium based startup Showpad, a content activation platform designed to improve their clients' sales and marketing productivity. “AWS supports our continued growth in Belgium and around the world” said Maarten Mortier, Chief Architect at Showpad. “We are glad to learn that AWS will open office in Brussels as using Amazon Web Services is part of our overall business strategy.”\n\nThe Brussels AWS office opening comes as Amazon continues its investment in, and expansion not only across Europe but also across the Middle East and Africa. In 2015 Amazon created over 10,000 new jobs in this region. People looking to apply for a role in Belgium, or any of Amazon’s businesses around the world, can apply online."
