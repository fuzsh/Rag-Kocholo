        "text": "A company based abroad may post its employees to Belgium, or in other words, employ employees in Belgium on a temporary basis. During the period of posting, the employer is obliged to comply with certain Belgian working conditions.\n\nPosting refers to the situation where an employee who usually works in one or more countries other than Belgium, or who has been recruited in a country other than Belgium, carries out work in Belgium on a temporary basis.\n\nThe term employee refers to a salaried worker. This means a person who, on the basis of a contract, performs work in return for remuneration under the direction of the undertaking company which posts him. The employment relationship between the foreign company which posts the employee and the salaried posted employee must already exist prior to the posting to Belgium and must be maintained for the duration of the posting.\n\nWhen employees are posted to Belgium, certain formalities apply.\n\nAccess to the labour market (work permit)\n\nThe granting and issuing of work permits falls within the competence of the regional Belgian authorities.\n\nAccess to the territory and residence\n\nIf the posted employee is a national of a country whose nationals are subject to visa requirements, the visa must have been obtained before the employee enters Belgium.\n\nThe posted employee needs to register with the local authority of the place where they reside.\n\nMore information can be found on the page about posting and access to the territory on the Federal Public Service Employment, Labour and Social Dialogue website.\n\nLIMOSA declaration\n\nThe foreign employer (or the employer’s authorised representative) who posts employees to Belgium must complete a Limosa declaration which can be found on the Limosa page of the Working in Belgium website. The declaration needs to be done before these employees are employed in Belgium.\n\nThe Limosa declaration contains specific information regarding the employee and the employer (place of employment, duration of posting, work schedules, etc.) and the liaison person designated by the employer.\n\nAnyone who is coming to Belgium for temporary or part-time employment, while not subject to the Belgian social security system, must be able to present proof of a Limosa declaration, in order to avoid criminal and administrative sanctions.\n\nSome categories of persons are exempt from completing a Limosa declaration. For example, artists, diplomats, employees working in the international transport sector or attending a scientific convention...\n\nMore information about the mandatory Limosa declaration can be found on the Limosa page of the Working in Belgium website or via the Limosa contact centre on telephone number +32(0)2 788 51 57, or via an email to limosa@eranova.fgov.be.\n\nLiaison person\n\nAn employer posting employees to Belgium must provide the Belgian Labour Inspectorate with details of the liaison person.\n\nMore information on the procedure concerning information details of the liaison person can be found on the page about Communication of the identification and contact details of the liaison person of the Federal Public Service Employment, Labour and Social Dialogue website.\n\nDocuments to be provided at the request of the Belgian Labour Inspectorate\n\nThe Belgian Labour Inspectorate may, under certain conditions, ask the company which is posting employees to Belgium to provide certain documents from the country of origin. These need to be equivalent to the Belgian employment documents concerning salary as well as other documents referred to in the Belgian Act of 5 March 2002. This act deals with the working, wage and employment conditions that apply to the posting of employees to Belgium and compliance therewith.\n\nMore information on these documents can be found on the page Documents to be delivered on request of the Belgian Labour Inspection on the FPS Employment, Labour and Social Dialogue website.\n\nA1 – Certificate of coverage\n\nWhen an employee is going to work in another member state, an A1 certificate or Certificate of Coverage is required to confirm the country in which this employee enjoys social security coverage.\n\nPlease refer to your local social security institution for A1 certificates for your non-Belgian employees."
