        "text": "Today, on 21 July, it is Belgian National Day 🇧🇪. Belgium commemorates the investiture of Leopold I as the first King of Belgium on 21 July 1831 after gaining its independence in 1830. In Brussels, the National Day is celebrated with a military and civil parade with participation of King Philippe and the Royal Family. The festivities continue in several spots throughout the city, featuring musical highlights, and traditionally close with fireworks in the evening. 🎆 Happy celebrations to everyone! 🎉\n\nThis week, we travelled to Strasbourg 🇫🇷🇪🇺 for the opening session of the new legislative mandate of the European Parliament. Besides following the elections of Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament, and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, we had the pleasure of exchanging with German MEPs David McAllister, Christine Schneider, Michael Gahler, Prof. Dr. Andrea Wechsler, Verena Mertens and Alexandra Mehnert to discuss upcoming projects and further fields of cooperation! 🇩🇪🇪🇺 We look forward to continuing our work in Brussels, Strasbourg and beyond, focusing on the topics that will remain or become relevant for the EU and its citizens. #EuropeanParliament #Strasbourg #KAS\n\nThe KAS European Office congratulates Ursula von der Leyen on her re-election as President of the European Commission! 🇪🇺 This afternoon, she received the majority of votes in the European Parliament in Strasbourg and will lead the European Commission for another 5-year term. In her statement she prioritised the following aspects for her term: ➕ Prosperity & competitiveness: the Commission will present a \"clean industrial deal\" in the first 100 days of her presidency and reduce administrative burdens to boost competitiveness; turbo charge investment in qualifications, digitalisation, agriculture etc. to create an \"Investment Commission\"; propose a savings & investment union ➕ Security & defence: establishment of a \"true European defence union\" complementing NATO and national efforts by bundling efforts; an EU commissioner for defence; and a white paper on European defence in the first 100 days of her presidency; the goal of tripled Frontex personnel up to 30,000 to protect EU borders ➕ Ukraine: \"Europe will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes\" and has to give Ukraine everything it needs - both to withstand and to win ➕ Democracy: Proposal of a new \"European Democracy Shield\" to counter disinformation and foreign interference; strengthen rule of law and liberal democracy by widening budget conditionality We wish President Ursula von der Leyen and her Team all the best for the challenges ahead!

Part of this process was to elect the EP presidency, which will be chaired by Roberta Metsola for the upcoming 2.5 years.\n\nLast weekend, we had the great pleasure of hosting the seminar „Defending the Eastern Flank“ in Tallinn/Estonia 🇪🇪🇪🇺. In cooperation with EDN - European Defence Network we gathered 15 young professionals and students from the security and defence field ⚔️ to discuss the Baltic Defence Strategy and cyberdefence in the Baltic states. We also had the chance to visit Tapa Military Base, the largest military base in the country and home to the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence multinational battle group in Estonia. 🪖 In our conversations with military and civilian experts it became obvious that the threat of a Russian aggression in the region is real and that it can occur in various forms. According to them, much will depend on the outcome of the war in Ukraine 🇺🇦 but the history of the Baltic states has proven that in times of aggression not fighting is not the better option. Thank you very much to the team of EDN - European Defence Network for the excellent cooperation as well as to all participants for making this seminar a success and for actively contributing to very insightful discussions! 🙂 We would also like to thank our colleagues at KAS Baltic States for facilitating the practical preparations on the ground. 🤝🏻 #DefenceSeminar #KAS #EDN #Estonia\n\nLast week, the future director of our foundation's Israel office, Michael Rimmel, paid a visit to our European Office to meet key stakeholders, decision-makers, and experts in Brussels. Christina Baade, Desk Officer for the MENA region in our Berlin HQ, accompanied him to the visits, as well as our director Dr. Beatrice Gorawantschy and our colleague Tom Körner. We learned a lot about the European perspective on EU-Israel relations and their development over the past months and years, the escalating conflict in Gaza, past and current peace processes as well as social education and reconciliation efforts. We are grateful for the insightful exchanges with H.E. Haim Regev, Ambassador of Israel to the EU. and all the other representatives and partners from the European Parliament, European External Action Service, European Commission, DG ECHO, DG NEAR, European Policy Centre, NATO, AJC, ELNET, the private sector, etc.\n\nTwo days after the early Parliamentary Elections in France 🇫🇷🇪🇺, we were delighted to welcome Anja Czymmeck, Director of the KAS Office in France, and Nele Wissmann, Policy Advisor at KAS France, to our virtual election format “The Morning After”. 🗳️ They underlined that the “Front républicain” against the far-right “Rassemblement National” worked, since RN only became third strongest party behind the left-leaning “New Popular Front” (NFP) and “Ensemble”, the party coalition around President Emmanuel Macron, after having won the first round with a considerable margin. 📊 However, since no party formation arrived even close to an absolute majority in the Assemblée Nationale, it remains to be seen if and how a majority can be found in a country that does not have a tradition of cross-party coalitions in parliament. 🤝 Furthermore, parts of NFP remain extremist, anti-European and anti-German, which could lead to further problems regarding the role of France in the EU and the Franco-German friendship. President Macron, who had called the elections after the poor performance of his own party in the European Elections earlier this year, will in any case be weakened on the national and European stage. 🇪🇺 Merci beaucoup à Anja Czymmeck and Nele Wissmann for their insightful presentation and explanations as well as to 100 participants who joined the discussion and enriched it with excellent questions and comments! 🙂 #TheMorningAfter #Elections #KAS\n\nYesterday we visited Luxembourg 🇱🇺 Throughout the day, we had a lot of great conversations about current topics in Luxembourg, in Europe and the world 🗺️ Among others we met with member of parliament, major of Esch and CSV vice-president Christian Weis, member of parliament Nathalie Morgenthaler member of parliament and CSV secretary general Françoise Kemp our partner party CSV - Chrëschtlech Sozial Vollekspartei and CSJ‘s president Metty Steinmetz and secretary general Laurent Braun the political director Véronique Dockendorf at the foreign ministry and German Ambassador Dr. Heike Peitsch 🇩🇪. We are very grateful for the warm reception and thankful for the perspectives shared with us. We will be back soon! As KAS Europe office, we cover EU affairs and the Benelux countries."
