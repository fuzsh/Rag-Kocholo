        "text": "6 October 2013\n\nDear Prime Minister,\n\nOn behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Singapore, I extend our deepest condolences on the passing of Mr Wilfried Martens.\n\nMr Martens served Belgium with distinction. He was a savvy leader who held successive government coalitions together in the 1980s, and unified Belgium’s linguistic groups. He also enacted reforms which set Belgium on the path to federalism. As a founding father of the European People’s Party, he strongly believed in European integration and worked hard to rally support for integration across the continent. Our thoughts are with you and the people of Belgium during this sad time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLEE HSIEN LOONG"
