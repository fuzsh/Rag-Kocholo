To file a counter-notification with us, you must provide a written communication (by fax, mail or email) that sets forth all of the items required by sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that an activity is not infringing the copyrights of others.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nExcept as otherwise set forth in these Terms of Use, the CGRS Parties make no representations or warranties and disclaim all liability for: (a) the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Services and any Content available on the Services, including on the Technical Assistance Library, Expert Witness Database, and Expert Witness Resource Library; (b) any of Your Content that you, another user, or a third party creates, uploads, posts, sends, receives or stores on or through the Services; (c) any claims arising from interactions with other Users (including Experts) or dealings with or services procured from or provided by Experts or other third parties; (d) any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services; (e) whether the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure or error-free basis; and (f) the deletion of, or the failure to store or transmit, Your Content and other communications maintained by the Services. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from CGRS Parties or through the Services, will create any representation or warranty not expressly made herein. ANY USE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY RELIANCE UPON OR USE OF ANY OF THE CONTENT OR INFORMATION THEREIN AND ANY INTERACTIONS OR DEALINGS WITH ANY EXPERTS, SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND (ALL OF WHICH ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED), WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE LAWS OF CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING NEW JERSEY, DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.\n\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE CGRS PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, USE, OR DATA, IN EACH CASE ARISING UNDER ANY THEORY, INCLUDING UNDER WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHER THEORY, EVEN IF SUCH CGRS PARTY IS AWARE OF OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND/OR RISK. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.\n\nTHE CGRS PARTIES’ TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY CLAIMING THROUGH YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE CONTENT OR SERVICES IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (I) THE AMOUNTS, IF ANY, YOU PAID TO CGRS RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE CONTENT AND/OR SERVICES IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY, AND (II) $100.\n\nINDEMNITY\n\nYou agree to indemnify and hold harmless the CGRS Parties from and against all losses, liabilities, expenses, damages, claims, judgments, demands and all costs and expenses in connection therewith, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs, due to or arising from: (a) any violation of these Terms of Use or any applicable law, rule or regulation; (b) Your Content; (c) your negligence or willful misconduct or any intentional or willful violation of any rights of another or harm you may have caused to another; (d) your interactions with other Users (including Experts) or dealings with or services provided by an Expert; or (e) your use or provision of any services in connection with the Services. If you are obligated to indemnify any CGRS Party hereunder, then you agree that UC Law SF on behalf of CGRS (or, at its discretion, the applicable CGRS Party) will have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding and to determine whether CGRS wishes to settle, and if so, on what terms, and you agree to fully cooperate with UC Law SF on behalf of CGRS in the defense or settlement of such claim.\n\nNOTICE\n\nBy using the Services, you consent to receive electronic communications from CGRS (via email or via a posting on the Services), and you agree that any such communications satisfy any legal requirement to make such communications in writing. You also agree that CGRS may communicate any notices to you under these Terms of Use through electronic mail, regular mail or posting the notices on the Services. All notices to CGRS must be provided by either sending: (i) an email to cgrs@uclawsf.edu; or (ii) a letter, first class certified mail, to CGRS, 200 McAllister Street, San Francisco, CA 94102, Attention: Deputy Director. Such notices will be deemed delivered upon receipt.\n\nENTIRE AGREEMENT\n\nThese Terms of Use and other agreements, rules, and policies incorporated by reference to this Terms, constitutes the entire agreement between you and CGRS with respect to the subject matter hereof and your use of the Services, and supersedes all other agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between CGRS and you with respect to the subject matter hereof. Additional terms and conditions may exist between you and third parties, including service providers and others. You represent and warrant that those third-party agreements do not interfere with your obligations and duties to CGRS under these Terms of Use.\n\nARBITRATION; NO CLASS ACTIONS\n\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\n\nYou and CGRS agree that in the event of any dispute between you and the CGRS Parties, either party will first contact the other party and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation, any court action, after first allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond. Both you and CGRS agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration against the other party, including any CGRS Party.\n\nAfter the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to the Services and/or Content, and any use or access or lack of access thereto, will be resolved by arbitration, including threshold questions of arbitrability of the Claim. You and CGRS Parties agree that any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms). If these Terms and this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit. Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you are waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.\n\nPayment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses will be governed by the JAMS Rules, except that if you demonstrate that any such costs and expenses owed by you under those rules would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, CGRS will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to possible reimbursement as set forth below). Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse CGRS for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the applicable rules. If you prevail in the arbitration and are awarded an amount that is less than the last written settlement amount offered by CGRS before the arbitrator was appointed, CGRS will pay you the amount it offered in settlement. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.\n\nYou have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to cgrs@uclawsf.edu. The notice must be sent to CGRS within 30 days of your first registering to use the Services or agreeing to these Terms; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes on a non-class basis in accordance with these Terms. If you opt-out of only the arbitration provisions, and not also the class action waiver, the class action waiver still applies. You may not opt-out of only the class action waiver and not also the arbitration provisions. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, CGRS also will not be bound by them.\n\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDING TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, OR CONTROVERSY WILL BE BROUGHT AND CONDUCTED ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS PART OF ANY CLASS (OR PURPORTED CLASS), CONSOLIDATED, MULTIPLE-PLAINTIFF, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING (“CLASS ACTION”). YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION. YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY FORUM. IF THE DISPUTE IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMBINE OR AGGREGATE CLAIMS, CONDUCT A CLASS ACTION, OR MAKE AN AWARD TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION.

IF A COURT DECIDES THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH ARE DEEMED INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION MUST BE BROUGHT IN A COURT OF PROPER JURISDICTION AND NOT IN ARBITRATION.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\nIf you breach any term of this Terms of Use or other agreement with the CGRS Parties, CGRS Parties may pursue any legal or equitable remedy available, including but not limited to, direct, consequential, and punitive damages and injunctive relief. CGRS Parties’ remedies are cumulative and not exclusive. Failure of any CGRS Party to exercise any remedy or enforce any portion of the Terms of Use at any time shall not operate as a waiver of any remedy or of the right to enforce any portion of the Terms of Use at any time thereafter.
