It represents ESA to the EU institutions, in particular the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, and facilitates close cooperation between them and the Agency.\n\nThe office was established in 1991 by an agreement between ESA and the Belgian Government and is located in the heart of the European Quarter of Brussels. Staff members here follow and report on the development and implementation of European space policy and work with ESA Directorates to represent the Agency’s interests within those institutions.\n\nIt also liaises with national Permanent Representations to the EU and the Committee of Permanent Representatives to ensure that ESA’s views are continuously voiced in the decision-making process."
