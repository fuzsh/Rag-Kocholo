If the Agreement exempts you from Belgian coverage, you and your employer may wish to arrange for alternative benefit protection.\n\nReturn to Totalization Agreements overview\n\nEliminating dual coverage for self-employment\n\nSelf-employed workers who work only in the United States are assigned U.S. coverage. Self-employed workers who work only in Belgium are assigned Belgian coverage. Self-employed workers who work in both countries but reside in the United States are assigned U.S. coverage. Self-employed workers who work in both countries but reside in Belgium are assigned Belgian coverage.\n\nReturn to Totalization Agreements overview\n\nBelgian certificates for employees\n\nEmployers must request a certificate of coverage to establish an exemption from U.S. Social Security contributions at the below address:\n\nNational Social Security Office\n\nVictor Hortaplein 11\n\nB-1060 Brussels\n\nBELGIUM\n\nPlease provide the following information:\n\nWorker's full name (including maiden name);\n\nWorker's date of birth;\n\nWorker's place of birth;\n\nWorker's country of citizenship;\n\nWorker's country of permanent residence;\n\nWorker's United States and Belgian social security numbers;\n\nDate of hire;\n\nCountry of hire;\n\nName and address of the employer in the United States and the Agreement country; and\n\nDate of transfer and anticipated date of return of employment in the Agreement country.\n\nU.S. employers should retain certificates of coverage in case of an audit by the IRS.

For example, in 2022, you receive one credit for each $1,410 of your covered annual earnings up to a maximum of four credits per year. The amount needed to earn a work credit goes up slightly each year.\n\nThe Belgian system measures credits in months. To simplify the information, the table shows requirements in years of credits.\n\n*Full retirement age is 66 for people born in 1943-1954 and will gradually increase to age 67 for people born in 1960 or later.\n\n*Full retirement age is 66 for people born in 1943-1954 and will gradually increase to age 67 for people born in 1960 or later.\n\nUnited States\n\nBelgium\n\nSpouse—Full benefit at full retirement age* or at any age if caring for the worker’s entitled child under age 16 (or dis- abled before age 22).

However, a retired worker with a dependent spouse may receive a spouse’s supplement.\n\nDivorced spouse—Full benefit at full retirement age.* Reduced benefit as early as age 62. Must be unmarried and have been married to worker for at least 10 years.\n\nDivorced spouse—To be entitled to a divorced wife’s pension, you must:\n\nBe entitled to your retirement pension;\n\nNot be deprived of parental authority;\n\nNot have been sentenced for having attempted the life of your ex-spouse;\n\nNot be remarried, unless this new marriage has been dissolved after death or divorce.\n\nChildren—If unmarried, up to age 18 (age 19 if in an elementary or secondary school full time) or any age if dis- abled before age 22.\n\nChildren—No provision. However, benefits may be payable under the Family Allowance Program.\n\n*Full retirement age is 66 for people born in 1943-1954 and will gradually increase to age 67 for people born in 1960 or later.\n\nSurvivors benefits\n\nUnited States\n\nBelgium\n\nSurviving Spouse—Full benefit at full retirement age* or at any age if caring for deceased’s entitled child under age 16 (or disabled before age 22). Reduced benefit as early as age 60 (or age 50 if disabled) if not caring for a child. Benefits may be continued if remarriage occurs after age 60 (or age 50 if disabled).\n\nSurviving Spouse—Benefit payable at age 45 or at any age if either caring for a child(ren) or at least two-thirds disabled; must have been married to deceased for at least one year. Pension ceases on remarriage, or if the deceased worked in underground mines for at least 20 years.\n\nNOTE: The survivors benefits age is increasing from 45 to the age 50. Reference the Federal Pensions Services website at https://www.sfpd.fgov.be/fr/droit-a-la-pension/pension-de-survie.\n\nDivorced Surviving Spouse—Same as surviving spouse if marriage lasted at least 10 years.\n\nDivorced Wife—Full benefit at age 65 or reduced benefit as early as age 60.

Therefore, a surviving spouse of a legal same-sex marriage may receive Belgian social security benefits. However, registered partnerships (heterosexual and same-sex couples) remain separate for tax and social security purposes. Therefore, they do not receive any Belgian social security benefits.\n\nNote: Belgium accords a divorced spouse of a previous legal same-sex marriage the same rights as a heterosexual divorced spouse.\n\nReturn to Totalization Agreements overview\n\nHow benefits can be paid\n\nIf you have social security credits in both the United States and Belgium, you may be eligible for benefits from one or both countries. If you meet all the basic requirements under one country’s system, you will get a regular benefit from that country. If you do not meet the basic requirements, the Agreement may help you qualify for a benefit as explained below.\n\nBenefits from the United States - If you do not have enough work credits under the U.S. system to qualify for regular benefits, you may qualify for a partial benefit from the United States based on both United States and Belgian credits. However, you must have earned at least six credits (generally one and one-half years of work) under the U.S. system for the United States to count your Belgian credits. If you already have enough credits under the U.S. system to qualify for a benefit, the United States cannot count your Belgian credits.\n\nBenefits from Belgium- Belgium also can count social security credits from both countries when necessary, to meet the eligibility requirements for Belgian benefits. To be eligible to have your United States and Belgian credits counted, you must have at least 18 months of coverage under the Belgian system.\n\nReturn to Totalization Agreements overview\n\nClaims for benefits\n\nIf you live in the United States and wish to apply for United States or Belgian benefits:\n\nVisit or write any U.S. Social Security office.\n\nPhone our toll-free number, 1-800-772-1213, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Friday. People who are deaf or hard of hearing may call our toll-free TTY number, 1-800-325-0778.\n\nComplete SSA-2490-BK (Application for Benefits Under a U.S. International Social Security Agreement) and mail to your local Social Security Administration office.\n\nIf you live in Belgium and wish to apply for U.S. or Belgian benefits, contact:\n\nFederal Benefits Unit\n\nUnited States Embassy\n\n42 Elgin Road\n\nBallsbridge\n\nDublin 4\n\nIRELAND\n\nFBU Inquiry Form - U.S. Mission Ireland (usembassy.gov)\n\nVisit or write any Belgian social security office.\n\nYou can apply with one country and ask to have your application considered as a claim for benefits from the other country.\n\nInformation from your application then will be sent to the other country. Each country will process the claim under its own laws, count credits from the other country when appropriate, and notify you of its decision.\n\nIf you have not applied for benefits before, you may need to provide certain information and documents when you apply. These may include:\n\nThe worker’s United States and Belgian social security numbers.\n\nProof of age for all claimants.\n\nEvidence of the worker’s U.S. earnings in the past 24 months.\n\nInformation about the worker’s coverage under the Belgian system.\n\nYou may wish to call the social security office before you go there to see if you need any other information.\n\nReturn to Totalization Agreements overview\n\nPayment of benefits\n\nEach country pays its own benefit. The U.S. Department of the Treasury issues U.S. payments each month covering benefits for the preceding month. Belgium makes payments at different times for different periods depending on the type of benefits.
