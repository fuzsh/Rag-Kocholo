Some also arrange visits for schools and organisations and provide premises for EU related activities. Aside from Representations, various EU agencies have their offices in Member States.\n\nThe Commission also maintains Europe Direct Information Centres (EDICs)\n\nThe EU also has 139 offices outside the EU, known as EU Delegations. They are managed by the European External Action Service. They present, explain and carry out the EU’s foreign policies. They also analyse and report on policies and negotiate for the EU."
