        "text": "To register an establishment unit in Belgium, the following data\n\nand documents are required:\n\nRequired data:\n\n- a description of the activities of the establishment unit\n\n(in line with the objects of the parent company);\n\n- the bank account number of the parent company;\n\n- the residence details (private address) of a director of the mother company;\n\n- the contact details (emal and telephone number of the director of the parent company);\n\n- the address of the establishment unit;\n\nIf also a VAT-number is required for the establishment unit:\n\n- the estimated annual turnover of the establishment unit;\n\n- the % intra-community deliveries\n\nRequired documents:\n\n- a recent company extract;\n\n- the memorandum and articles of association, and all amending deed of the parent company\n\n- a translation of the above documents to Dutch (unless they are available in Dutch, French, German,\n\nor English\n\n- a copy of the passport or identity card of a director of the parent company\n\n- proof of knowledge of managerial skills of a director of the parent company (this is only required if\n\nthe establishment unit is located in Brussels or Wallonia, but is not required in Flanders);\n\n- proof of professional knowledge of the director (only applicable to regulated activities if the\n\nestablishment unit is located in Brussels or Wallonia, but is not required in Flanders);\n\n- a power of attorney to Coventis to set up the Belgian establishment unit (to be drawn up by us).\n\nAfter processing the application, a Belgian company number will be assigned to the foreign parent company and the Belgisan establishment unit will be registered.\n\nAn establishment unit with commercial activities in Belgium will be subject to the provisions of the Bookkeeping Act in Belgium and is required to keep books and accounting documents with respect to the establishment unit in Belgium.\n\nThis does not mean that the material transactions for the registration and processing of the data have to take place in Belgium, but that the books and accounting documents of the establishment units are directly accessible in Belgium.\n\nA foreign parent company which has an establishment unit in Belgium is NOT required to file its annual accounts with the National Bank of Belgium if it has no securities traded on the Belgian stock exchange.\n\nCOMPANY SOCIAL SECURITY AFFILIATION\n\nEvery company, which is subject to Belgian corporate income tax or non-resident tax, must join a social security fund within three months and pay the annual corporate contribution.\n\nSMEs (including establishment units of foreign companies) with commercial activities are exempt from the corporate contribution during the first three years from their formation if, during the 10-year period prior to their formation, the managers or directors and the majority of the working partners (who are not manager or director) have not been self-empoyed in Belgium for more than 3 years.\n\nDIRECTOR SOCIAL SECURITY AFFILIATION\n\nIf the director of a foreign company does not reside in Belgium and receives no income in Belgium from the Belgian establishment unit, he is not required to join a social security fund in Belgium, and will remain subject to the social security fund in his country of origin.\n\nOn the other hand, if the director of a foreign parent company resides in Belgium and/or derives income from the Belgian establishment unit, he is considered self-employed and must join a social security fund at the latest on the day of the start of the activity in Belgium. That means in principle before the registration of the establishment unit. In practice, the affiliation of a director usually takes place within the quarter of opening the establishment unit.\n\nAs a self-employed person you pay social security contributions every quarter through a social security fund. This is how you build up the right to a pension, child benefits, health care, etc.\n\nThe social security funds bases the calculation of social security contributions on the data provided by the tax authorities. This concerns the gross professional income, minus the operating expenses, charges and losses, determined in accordance with the legislation on income tax.\n\nYour social security contributions are calculated on the basis of your income from three years ago. Afterwards, these contributions are, if necessary, regularized on your income for the current year.\n\nIf a director has a self-employed status and resides in another EU-member state and realizes a minimum of 25% of the turnover, working time and income from the activity of the parent company, there is a good chance that he is not liable for social security in Belgium. He must request form A1 from the authority responsible for the social security of the self-employed in his own country. This agency will inform the Belgian RSVZ and the countries consult each other (within 6 months) to determine to wihch legislation the person concerned is subject."
