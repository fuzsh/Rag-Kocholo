        "text": "Belgium, with its open and strongly globalized economy, lies in the heart of the European Union (EU). Its capital, Brussels, is home to the EU headquarters and is a host to many international organisations and multinationals, including the headquarters of NATO. High speed trains connect Brussels directly with Paris, London, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. The city of Antwerp has the second-largest European port and the second largest chemical cluster in the world. It is also the world’s largest diamond centre.\n\nBelgium’s three official languages are Dutch, French and German. The two main regions in Belgium are Flanders; the Dutch-speaking portion in the North, and Wallonia; the predominantly French speaking region in the South.
