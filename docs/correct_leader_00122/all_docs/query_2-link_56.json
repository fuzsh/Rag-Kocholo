The Office in Europe was created in Paris in 1948 to serve as observer and personal representative of the Managing Director at these new institutions. Over time, the functions of the office expanded to include wider liaison with European-based institutions, external relations, and outreach to academic institutions, NGOs, and the public.\n\nThe IMF Europe Office was established in 2013, comprising the Paris Office and the newly created Brussels Office"
