That vision was a socio-political approach called communism entailing an economy which was fair, equal and that provided opportunities for the masses. It did not really ever work, and communism took forms of authoritarian regimes and economic incompetence, and was finally buried in Europe.\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day – What does it mean to be a humanitarian in Europe?\n\nWhat does it mean to be ‘a humanitarian’ working in Greece – a country in Europe that, notwithstanding its economic crisis, does not fit the bill of the classic ‘emergency’ context? How does the response in Greece challenge our assumptions about what it means to be a humanitarian?\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day – What does it mean to be a humanitarian in Europe?\n\nWhat does it mean to be ‘a humanitarian’ working in Greece – a country in Europe that, notwithstanding its economic crisis, does not fit the bill of the classic ‘emergency’ context? How does the response in Greece challenge our assumptions about what it means to be a humanitarian?"
